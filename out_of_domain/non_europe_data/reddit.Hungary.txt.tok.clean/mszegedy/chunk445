  hi , no need to worry , i got it working !, 
  the problem was that ` / boot ` was never mounted . 
  thank you for everything !, 
  hi , no need to worry , i got it working !, 
  the problem was that ` / boot ` was never mounted . 
  thank you for everything !, 
  the problem for me , it turns out , was that ` / boot ` was n't mounted when the kernel was updated ( it 's not in my ` fstab ` so it does n't get mounted automatically ; why do the sample ` fstab ` s on the wiki not have ` / boot ` ? ) . 
  i hope this solution works for you too !, 
  hmm , my problem was ` / boot ` was never mounted when ` linux ` was getting updated , so the kernel only got overwritten when i mounted it manually from the liveusb . 
  your symptoms do n't match up with that though , since if ` / boot ` were n't mounted , a ` mkinitcpio ` would n't have fixed it . 
  this is really widespread afaik . 
  there 's been at least one paper published about it : `` a focus account for contrastive reduplication : prototypicality and contrastivity '' by binna lee and chungmin lee , at seoul national university . 
  nguyens are at least common enough that people are eventually compelled to make an effort . 
  although why they went with `` win '' rather than `` ween '' is beyond me . 
  edit :, 
   the screaming anti-sjw ness of this post is also really rubbing me the wrong way . 
  it 's pointing out a legitimate dumb assertion what . 
  `` i feel bad for the people whose names get bastardized in other languages ... except english ones , because that literally never happens . '', 
  is n't part of the entire point of social justice the recognition of experiences that you may not have had ? 
  the tumblr post is antithetical to that . 
  ipa is your friend : [ \u014b\u02b7\u01d0\u02c0\u0259n ] ( the tone diactritic is a little hard to make out , but it 's falling ), 
  i just learned it from wikipedia and tables , but memrise probably has some stuff , like [ this ] ( http://www.memrise.com/course/391320/international-phonetic-alphabet-ipa-2/ ) course . 
  any time you 're looking to rote-memorize a bunch of vocabulary or orthography , check if there 's a memrise course for it ; it 'll make your life a lot easier . 
  that one 's guy fieri , not violent j, 
  yeah , that !, 
  for some reason they never care for it . 
  possibly because i start all the wars . 
  - ethnically turkic, 
  - identity-wise uralic, 
  - linguistically uralic, 
  - genetically slavic, 
  - culturally , a westernized mix of slavic , germanic , and turkic influences, 
  - politically post-soviet, 
  - neighbors insist we 're mongolic, 
  i thought i was confused in my ethnic identity because i had lived in so many places , but it turns out it 's just good old carpathian shenanigans, 
  this needs to be a monty python sketch, 
  in the stupid post-ww2 treaty the opposite of the first vienna award happened . 
  you 're welcome for removing avar kebab, 
  these are good ideas for reducing micromanagement , but honestly i see a more pressing need for a better ui . 
  if anyone here 's played civ , you know how much more informative and clean that better ui mod made it ? 
  we need that sort of thing for eu4 . 
  even simple things like etas for colonies and other random processes are left out , as well as more complex things like optimal trading configurations . 
  and how about that really informative screen of belligerents during wars ? 
  could n't we get the same thing before declaring war , instead of having to compile it all from the ledger ? 
  and where 's my list of countries sorted by their net number of reasons for allying me , or marrying me , or supporting my independence , etc ? 
  there are so many little things you have to multiply out by hand . 
  it should n't be that way . 
  - ethnically : the collective identity and passing down of customs continuously from one generation to the next originates from the same place as the rest of the turkic peoples , central asia . 
  there were a couple major disruptions along the way ( getting conquered by the magyars , whose identity and language we adopted , and getting nearly wiped out by the mongols and later to a lesser extent the turks ) , but there existed a core continuous lineage of ethnic identity the entire time . 
  - genetic : looking at y-haplogroups and things , we are descended mostly from the same people as our slavic neighbors , as a result of getting wiped out multiple times and typical interbreeding . 
  that 's why we look white , and not asian like other turkic peoples ( e.g. 
  - id-wise : we are typically listed under uralic peoples , and not turkic peoples . 
  you saw for yourself in the comment i replied to that we typically identify as uralic , not turkic , although that varies . 
  this is because we inherited the ethnic identity of the magyars when they conquered us . 
  the bulgars are in the same boat , but they got slavic languages and identity instead . 
  the hungarians and the bulgars both adopted these other cultures , obviously , to disguise ourselves from serbia . 
  if you were using lisp this would be supported out of the box . 
  they are thugs , not administrators . 
  their `` state '' is short-lived . 
  then again it * has * happened historically that thugs became the rulers of countries . 
  back then i guess the only job requirement was that you had to be able to seize and hold power . 
  nowadays though they 're probably just gon na get their asses kicked by states that want to keep status quo , or maintain prestige , or want to help out the people having to live under their terrible standard of living ( oh wait , the kurds are n't a state !, 
  strange . 
  most hungarians i 've seen could probably pass for polish or serbian . 
  the exotic ones are usually gypsies . 
  that would be wonderful !, 
  i 'll see if i can obtain higher-res ones from gis stuff , though . 
  thank you !, 
  neither the field of cs nor the field of linguistics supports this . 
  whose idea was it ? 
  * the super mario bros super show !, 
  * did fine with characterizing the protagonists . 
  although that might have been concurrent with the rpgs , which did some characterization already . 
  i 'd wait before passing judgement . 
  i want to put normal nations in spots as accurate as possible ( although there will be problems that i 'll have to circumvent by being inaccurate ; e.g. , in the cretaceous , most of europe and anatolia are underwater ) . 
  it seems everybody wants pangaea , so i 'll do that , although i 'm slightly sad , as i do n't think that offers too much interesting gameplay . 
  exactly . 
  if you 're on linux you can use evince , or if you 're okay with having a bunch of kde dependencies then you can install the far better okular . 
  windows has foxit . 
  mac already comes with preview , and you can probably find something better , too . 
  wait , what ? 
  \\* could care * fewer *, 
  i actually have a gilded comment at -6 , and the most downvoted comment on reddit , [ karmanaut 's explanation of why they took down bad luck brian 's ama , ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/s5guk/iam_bad_luck_brian_ama/c4b8m3u ) got gilded . 
  i think you mean either highest gold-to-upvote ratio , or lowest upvote-to-gold ratio though . 
  i did n't mean to , though . 
  i genuinely do n't see why it 's hard to write something that people do n't understand , or why you 'd want to . 
  both encounters were fairly brutal . 
  sorry , lol . 
  it 's just that it 's all extremely memorable . 
  have you read pizarro 's memoirs ? 
  he arrives in qosqo with like 150 guys , meets the king , shows him the bible , and captures him , fighting off the entire cusque\u00f1o army ( totaling * 80,000 * men ) and killing * half * of them . 
  he proceeds to ransom him for an absolutely ridiculous amount of gold , and then * executes * him . 
  i can only imagine that this sort of ruthless dedication to acquiring money is similar to that required to run most large companies today . 
  whee , thanks !, 
  - slightly brutal : killing the king and his court , and usurping power ; e.g. 
  crimean khanate vs theodoro, 
  - fairly brutal : capturing the king , killing tens of thousands of his men , executing the king , and usurping power ; e.g. 
  pizarro vs qosqo/the incan empire , initial encounter, 
  - brutal : completely depopulating the capital , usurping power , and eventually committing genocide on some of the minorities ; e.g. 
  ottomans vs the orthodox world/byzantine empire,
