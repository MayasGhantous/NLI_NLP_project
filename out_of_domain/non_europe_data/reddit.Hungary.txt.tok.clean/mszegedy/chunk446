  of course , the username gag itself is so obvious that there 's no need to tag it .

   is there any icons or other symbols this current generation understand while ignoring the origin ? 
  every chinese or japanese character . 
  hell , every writing system ; even all the characters derived from the phoenician alphabet , like the latin alphabet , can be traced back to pictographs , specifically egyptian hieroglyphs . 
  not sure about the brahmic scripts though or more obscure ones . 
  oh man , who wants to parody the beginning ?

  fascism, 
  and economic downturn,

  you have got to share your technique . 
  if they were patronizing you , you would n't have gotten that many upvotes and gold !,

  the theming 's accurate, 
  presumably they 'd observe it for more than a day, 
  yes , i 'm agreeing with / u/fredschwartz 's subtext, 
  add collagen to water and just stir, 
  no i understood it , i was agreeing with you . 
  it 's actually in [ the jargon file page ] ( http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/r/real-programmer.html ) about `` real programmers '' i linked elsewhere in this thread . 
  do you know where it originated ? 
  historically this has n't much been the case .

  you think it would purposely capture the output of the error , feed it back into the post , * and * add code tags to every line of it for good measure ? 
  in hungarian you say `` nincs mit '' , i.e. 
  `` there is n't what [ acc ] '' . 
  this is because `` mit '' is short for `` ak\u00e1rmit '' ( `` anything [ acc ] '' ) , so it is stating `` there is n't anything ( to thank ) '' . 
  ( `` ak\u00e1rmi '' becomes `` mi '' in certain contexts such as that one . 
  this is similar to how in latin after `` si '' , `` nisi '' , `` num '' , and `` ne '' , `` aliquid '' becomes `` quid '' . ), 
  nah , that 's accurate as far as word processors go !, 
  let 's talk about that weird directory structure instead ... 
  mfw we know planets that orbit pulsars . 
  that 's crazy . 
   especially jj abrams movies, 
  the new star trek movies were n't quite like that , they tended to be somewhat twistier . 
  in fact i found them somewhat confusing * because * they departed from the formula ( and i had n't had any previous exposure to star trek ... sue me ) . 
  spot on though for most of his other movies . 
  looks more like slj from pulp fiction honestly ( ndt is stouter ) , but it 's a common style . 
  you just ca n't see the face very well so it 's hard to match him up . 
  i dunno , looks like something my classmates would have easily written in 6th grade ( the year they made my class in america do this ) . 
  not me though , i did n't know to write english, 
  in modern speech `` layperson '' usually just means the average , perhaps uneducated person . 
  in that sense a knight would n't be a layperson , as they were very rich . 
  edit : although , they probably meant your definition, 
  i think it might be the fact that `` right ? '', 
  seems more natural , or that it was followed up by a joke in the next comment . 
  maybe eventually `` this '' will migrate into irl speech and it 'll be less weird online,

  [ no , really ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kriegsspiel_%28wargame%29 ) , / u/tiger8255 can believe what he wants, 
   a story about the troll equivalent of awkward teenaged romance, 
  basically a5a1 . 
  so the question becomes * more * troll teen romance , which ... does n't change a thing, 
  let 's assume that humans ca n't get enough air at speeds faster than that , as that 's the original claim , and the only one that makes physical sense for a speed as opposed to an acceleration . 
  let 's then also say that they start getting lightheaded and losing consciousness at 20 mph and up , to varying degrees . 
  we would n't be able to use horses effectively , so none of the eurasian nomad empires would have formed . 
  china might have expanded further , rome 's equivalent would probably still have fallen , but would have lasted longer ( no gothic invasion ) ; europe would be more culturally homogenous . 
  in steppes , a new empire might emerge , or they might just get conquered by neighboring european , persian , indian , and/or chinese empires . 
  speaking of which , egypt never fights the hyksos ( or fights them successfully anyway ) , so they might form another empire over north and/or west africa ( suffering from the same instability as all the other empires , but anyway they 'd be in the same sphere ) . 
  india also never gets conquered by the aryans , but i do n't know enough about indian history to speculate about the consequences . 
  and persia never gets conquered by the hittites , either , but it 's not like that really did anything . 
  when the old world finally met the new , they 'd be on somewhat more equal footing , literally , since again , the conquistador and company would have to fight the natives on the ground . 
  this would be a lot later than nowadays , though , since it would be hard to make a voyage across the atlantic ocean without getting over-speed relative to the air . 
  maybe it only happens when europe or africa invents functionally airtight ships . 
  meanwhile , the austronesians do not spread all over the pacific , islam never reaches southeast asia ( hinduism probably does though ) , and brunei never becomes a great power . 
  the only part of se asia to get populated is the west ( no negritos/papuans anywhere , and no malagasy in madagascar for that matter ) , which gets visited by the europeans much later than the americas , unless in the meantime they bothered to get in touch with china . 
  once we figure out making airtight vehicles , though , it 's pretty much the same . 
  overall you get more stability , since nomads do n't have advantages over empires and are simply soft targets for conquerors , and less human expansion due to less naval travel . 
  look at pre-columbian america to see what that looks like . 
  edit : also , populating exceptionally windy places like hurricane basins is harder , but not impossible , since , barring a cyclone , wind speeds wo n't get over ~ 20 mph ( ~ 10 m/s ) on average even in the windiest places . 
  and we 've managed to populate environments a lot more hostile than that , so we 're probably good for crossing the land bridge from asia to the new world in prehistoric times . 
  originally the idea was that humans ca n't breathe at that speed , so your relevant factor is speed with respect to the air . 
  i think most style guides would say `` windows 's '' , but that 's all meaningless anyhow , as those sorts of rules originate in the deliberate invention of rules in victorian stvle guides to be signs of prestige, 
  no , i mean windows ' vs windows 's, 
  [ apparently this thing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/garbage_disposal_unit ) , although it sounds like it would be really loud anyway, 
  the * magyars * did . 
  modern-day hungarians are the result of interbreeding between the turkic people already in pannonia when the magyars conquered it , and the neighboring slavs . 
  it 's the former whose origin is uncertain . 
  they might have been hunnic , but who knows . 
  what 's wrong with the other ones ?
