  i understand xbox one ~ ~ has horrible amounts of drm ~ ~ sucks for other reasons , but what about the ps4 ? 
  edit : my takeaway : few exclusives , and pcs are better for the non-exclusives . 
  thx everyone, 
  why does everyone always take india and only india ? 
  it 's not particularly soft -- the bahmanis tend to blob into a big cyan blob in the south , and delhi or jaunpur tend to blob in the north . 
  it 's also not particularly high in basetax ; the chinese coast is much more valuable . 
  the only good provinces are in the doab region , next to the himalayas . 
  i might just be misinformed, 
  it 's an omen, 
  now form that other nation with the eagle !, 
  i 'm sure that 's what iran was asking as well when it got invaded by the usa way back when, 
  they were also a fucking joke , apparently once in a war against the ottomans they got drunk and fought themselves . 
  they also * lost * to the italians . 
  landj\u00e4ger-munching target practice , that 's what they are, 
   forum roleplays are ladies as far as the eye can see . 
  men are unicorns . 
  except the nation roleplay ones , those tend to be mostly/all male, 
  move to hungary !, 
  we always appreciate a good butcher, 
  that it 's reconstructed, 
  it 's been `` possibly apocryphal '' on wikipedia for a while . 
  the tragedy lives on in our hearts though, 
  ` c-x ` is pretty convenient with a dvorak keyboard , though ; ` x ` is right in the middle of the bottom row, 
  at least j and k are next to each other :\\, 
  the best one there is !, 
  this is the delay between things that happen in vic 2 and when they make the newspapers, 
  taking a pic of your screen rather than screenshotting ? 
  hungary always allies france for some reason , pulls all the aggro during the hundred years ' war , and gets its ass kicked by its neighbors later anyway . 
  thank you this is fantastic, 
  it should be on your keyboard . 
  but there 's other ways to activate the screenshot executable, 
  it was a joke, 
  for shame , linking such a low-res image !, 
  how are we supposed to admire the clay 's sexiness ? 
  [ here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/sedimentary-clay-mountain.jpg/1280px-sedimentary-clay-mountain.jpg ), 
  bad ... linguistic anthropology ? 
  while we do produce a lot of loonies , even people who publish ridiculous things like `` the ugric-altaic-sumerian family '' , that 's not much worse than a lot of other languages ( sanskrit , anyone ? ) . 
  and most hungarians i 've had the chance to talk with hungarian word relations with call it a finno-ugric or uralic language . 
  admittedly , my sampling may have been biased , since many were family friends , and my mother studied linguistics . 
  just wanted to ask , since neither this post nor / u/snickeringshadow 's directly answers it , why did atahualpa fall for the ambush ? 
  just a single case of bad judgement ? 
  oh sure , base knowledge about it is bad , but if you talk to 100 randomly selected native english speakers , they 'd probably say a lot of stupid shit too . 
  few people know english is ie ( and what that means ) , few people know hungarian is uralic ( and what that means ) . 
  we 're by no means behind the curve . 
  our badling does tend to come more snowflake-flavored due to our mixed-up history , but i do n't think badling overall is more prevalent . 
  each language will have its own unique distribution of types of badling , after all . 
  sometimes when you need to defeat a specific greater power , it can be beneficial to get vassalized . 
  `` support independence '' is very powerful , and you can get lots of europe to beat the crap out of the ottomans for you . 
  the tough part is declaring war on them and making them accept vassalization as part of your tribute . 
  burgundy is dutch ? 
  are n't they a minority ? 
  you have to realize though that language frequently bears relationship to neither the cultural nor the genetic lineage of people . 
  obvious example : central and south america . 
  while there 's lots of people there with even partial western ancestry and cultural heritage , there 's also many 100 % american people there . 
  and some of them speak nothing but spanish . 
  are you kidding ? 
  even in western europe you get shitty doors like these . 
  have you ever been to belgium ? 
  schweiz + aria ... ahahaha that actually * is * hilarious, 
  i think england crushed france 's rebels . 
  edit : nope, 
  hmm , bullshit detector 's bleeping , but w/e ... 
  you live in * svalbard ? 
  * what do you do all day there ? 
  play eu4 and reddit ? 
  bah , dark blue is different enough from dark turquoise . 
  now , if you 're playing as sulu , * then * they have cause to be afraid . 
  but multiplayer v2 is impossible . 
  my friend and i tried to get it working for three hours straight one time . 
  not a peep . 
  unfortunately this does n't help . 
  i tried both with ` v2game.exe ` and ` victoria2.exe ` . 
  one thing that 's strange to me is that no cache files get created in steam 's v2 directory ; they only ever appear in my own v2 directory . 
  yup , after giving up trying to manually forward ports . 
  :\\ we could n't see each other through it . 
  edit : sorry , not hamachi , i meant tunngle, 
  that 's what we ( tried to ) use , after trying some other stuff, 
  no , but i doubt it would help . 
  it took a lot to even get it to not crash ; i do n't want to go through that again . 
  if you think it might help , though , i 'll try it . 
  \\  implying the earliest human hunter-gatherers ate bananas, 
  i once went to a mcdonalds as a kid ( in austria , i think ) that had two posts near the entrance that , for each post , had a screen and gc controller on each of its four sides , all connected to the same gc . 
  they played super smash bros melee . 
  this was about when it was released in europe , 2002 . 
  surprisingly , i do n't remember the controllers being that greasy . 
  i pondered over that pun occasionally for years as a kid . 
  :( i guess `` diagon '' just was n't similar enough to `` diurn '' for me to make the connection . 
  oh , i guess that works too . 
  but the words being opposites is a neater contrast , rather than both just being - ally adverbs . 
  it was probably a little of both . 
  ( ortgon alley would have been too/not enough obvious and/or not british enough ? 
  is `` horton alley '' close enough ? 
  it certainly does n't sound evil enough . ), 
  edit : my favorite candidate is now `` ordgone alley '' . 
  it sounds evil , british , and very close to the word it 's supposed to resemble . 
  besides how bad the phonetic writing is anyway , what can be made out of it 's frequently flat-out wrong , even for how people pronounce it in english . 
  for example , nobody puts the stress on the last syllable for `` budapest '' ( and in hungarian , stress is always initial ) , and english speakers do most commonly say [ \u02c8p\u00e6k\u0268st\u00e6n ] , while in urdu there is light stress on the final syllable . 
  i like the ones for english place names , though . 
  `` melb ` n '' is a pretty good phonetic transcription . 
  next step : use pattern-matching and/or bayesian classifiers to match the captions to the posts !,
