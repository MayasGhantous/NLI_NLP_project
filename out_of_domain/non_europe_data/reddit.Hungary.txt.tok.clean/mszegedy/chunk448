  it 's in the metadata , op was required to add a name when he made the meme, 
  there 's an analogous phrase in hungarian , too : `` menj a pics\u00e1ba '', 
  i 'm all for sandbox mechanics , but the guy you replied to 's argument instantly popped into my head when i read the thread . 
  it 's important to keep the purposes of different mechanics clear and distinct , so that you do n't wind up breaking one thing while attempting to change another , and so that you can work on just one angle of gameplay at a time . 
  the historical friends mechanic is there to nudge history in particular directions , and should n't be co-opted . 
  it 's fine to add another mechanic , though , or change an existing one that does what op describes ( namely trust ) . 
  i think `` trust '' already does a decent job with this , but would do well being represented in the opinion modifier as well . 
  ( my personal ux complaint here : why do n't we have a way to view our trust points directly ? 
  or other things that we can find out by inference , like how much debt a country has ? 
  this is part of the reason why eu4 could really use a ui overhaul mod like civ 5 has . ), 
  it 's frequently political , like the ( lack of ) difference between norwegian and danish . 
  so miss angel is collecting people who are looking for redemption , and getting them to do her bidding . 
  since forge was concerned that people should do good in the moment rather than weigh net consequences , said bidding will probably involve some kind of charity work , maybe volunteering at a local hospital or something . 
  ( if the answer turns out to be `` take down the activity consortium because they 're consequentialist '' , i 'll be really disappointed at the hypocrisy ),

  hungarian national identity is a complex subject , and impossible to understand by examining just a linear history of how it evolved . 
  a good place to start , though , is the labeling of hungarians as a `` uralic people '' . 
  this is uncontroversial ( except in hungary , hah ) , and is backed up by mounds of archaeological and linguistic evidence . 
  the original magyars lived on the eastern side of the urals until the early first millennium , when they migrated to the west side . 
  not satisfied , they soon took off further to the west , and embarked on an epic couple-hundred-year trek that led them to pannonia in the late 800s or so . 
  the path that they took in the meantime is [ still under debate ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/hungarian_migration.png ) , but there 's definite linguistic evidence for passage through persia and bashkiria . 
  ( [ a large contingent ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/magna_hungaria ) actually stayed in bashkiria until the 1200s , when they got wiped out by the mongols , or more accurately the tatars . 
  this becomes important later . ), 
  when the magyars arrived in pannonia , they ousted the avars , and established strict control over the population pretty quickly . 
  by the 1200s , most people in the carpathian basin considered themselves magyar . 
  but then , the mongols arrived , and wiped the original magyars out . 
  or possibly it was n't just the mongols . 
  all we know is , [ not even a statistically significant trace ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18373723 ) remains of their genes in today 's hungary . 
  not their culture either , which , like sami culture , would have revolved primarily around reindeer anyway ( not a common sight in hungary ) ; we have a couple rhymes which may refer to pagan rituals , but that 's pretty much it . 
  so , present-day `` magyars '' are neither genetically nor culturally uralic . 
  linguistically , though , we are straight-up uralic and therefore eastern , which is what was relevant in my conversation with / u/lumidaub . 
  despite no genetic relation , there is much similarity between hungarian and japanese , starting with agglutinativity and topic-prominence , and ending with phonology . 
  but that 's not what i was arguing , nor what you asked about . 
  the question remains : if today 's `` magyars '' are n't culturally or genetically uralic , then what are they ? 
  take two . 
  the carpathian basin , circa 600 ad . 
  you are a peasant living in the city that will one day become \u00d3buda . 
  you are ruled over by the avars . 
  who are you ? 
  you are not avar , but you are turkic . 
  it 's possible that you 're a descendant of the huns , who occupied pannonia less than two centuries ago . 
  it 's possible that you 're some other turkic tribe , who recently migrated there . 
  one thing is for certain , though : by contemporary analysis , [ you are hungarian !, 
  ] ( http://ahea.net/e-journal/volume-6-2013/6 ) yes , it is your descendants who will one day get to drive trabants across the glorious land of magyarorsz\u00e1g , and get to say stupid shit like `` hungarian is the last surviving descendant of sumerian , and also somehow altaic '' . 
  you will get conquered by the magyars soon , but that wo n't really make a cultural impact on you , because in your heart of hearts you are still roaming the steppes of central asia and 360-noscoping scrubs from horseback . 
  because of your traditions , hungarians will go on to invent hussars , and to hold [ `` cultural heritage festivals '' ] ( http://kurultaj.hu/ ) where they do very impressive tricks involving horses and other culturally significant items . 
  it seems hungarians * are * eastern , originating from central asia like the rest of the turkic peoples . 
  but there are stronger cultural influences than magyars , and stronger genetic influences than ancestors from over a millennium ago . 
  while hungarians are ultimately turkic , we are clearly no longer steppe nomads , and also clearly do n't have obvious characteristics identifying us as central asian , such as eastern eyes . 
  this has to do with the ongoing process of assimilation into europe that started the moment we arrived there , and was hastened by the threat of living on the edge of europe ( although even by 1000 ad we were [ mostly genetically slavic ] ( http://www.matud.iif.hu/08okt/02.html ) ) . 
  the post-magyar architects of hungarian history are the mongols , byzantium , the habsburgs and ottomans , and finally the soviet union . 
  all of these shaped hungarian identity in the direction of identifying as eastern or central european along with everyone else in the region , primarily because none of them could tell us apart from the slavs . 
  byzantium came first , and taught us the latin alphabet ( and latin , which we used as our government 's language until it pissed off the austrians too much in the 1800s ) , and also showed us jesus . 
  christianity was our european passport , and before we knew it , our dynasty was mingling with the habsburgs , converting to catholicism , and maintaining diplomatic relations with poland . 
  ( and probably bohemia . 
  i do n't actually know exactly what europe looked like back then . ), 
  at some point , however , the mongols struck !, 
  they wiped out a fair chunk of the hungarian population , and [ the king was forced to repopulate hungary from the surrounding peoples ( slavs and cumans ) . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%a9la_iv_of_hungary#.22second_founder_of_the_state.22_.281242.e2.80.9361.29 ) hence , why we look white . 
  only a couple centuries later , we got conquered and depopulated again , by the ottomans , but this time the conquerors had the audacity to stay a full century before getting routed by the holy army . 
  this further diluted the original turkic genes of the hungarians , but also exacerbated another factor , which by this point had been in play for a good half millennium -- habsburg influence . 
  we were dependent on the habsburgs for military support ( even retaking our own capital ) , and all manner of government , especially kings . 
  if germany was as western as it got , then so were we . 
  eventually austria just straight-up inherited us , so we * were * greater germany . 
  this german cultural influence manifests itself in such stunning examples today as that i like simulator games , and get really excited about scale-model train set expos . 
  i do n't know much about hungarian history after 1848 , so i do n't have as much to say about the soviets . 
  did we really need more slavic cultural influence ? 
  maybe . 
  we were pretty german . 
  but the fact is that other than imposing russian cultural ideals on hungary , soviet sphering also had the ( absolutely intended ) side effect of making us identify more closely with our neighbors , as we were all starving together in the `` eastern bloc '' . 
  it also had the side effect of including us in the cold war at large , sorting all nations of the world into `` american-influenced '' and `` soviet-influenced '' , leading to some really weird national kinships , such as the hungarian-cuban kinship brought up in [ this american cultural importation . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/lqv2sn4zpl8 ), 
  all-in-all ? 
  hungarians are turkic by origin , uralic by language and identity , slavic by genetics , and * incredibly confusing * ( but mostly german and slavic ) by culture . 
  you might compare us to many victims of imperialism like the countries of south america , except ahead of the game by a few centuries ( and therefore less poor ) .
