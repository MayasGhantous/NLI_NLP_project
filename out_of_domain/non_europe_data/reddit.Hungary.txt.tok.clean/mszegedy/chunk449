  edit : bonus : all our neighbors tell us to `` go back to mongolia '' , which is technically valid . 
  this is also what i was alluding to in my reference to invading japan by sea ( which the mongols tried and failed to do ) . 
  edit 2 : it would be ironic if we * were * descendants of the huns , because that would mean that proto-hungarians ( the huns ) ruled over proto-germans ( the goths ) !, 
  funnily enough , no additional lithium formed afterwards ever , as far as we know . 
  ( it 's a step in some nuclear reactions , but it 's so quick that the amount of lithium in that phase at any given moment is negligible . ), 
  it * is * exceedingly rare , and this is called the [ `` cosmic lithium problem '' ] ( http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3551 ) ( pop sci article [ here ] ( http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/the-universes-lost-lithium/ ) ) , as its abundance in old stars is about a third of what you 'd expect from big bang nucleosynthesis . 
  part of the problem is that its nuclear binding energy is [ very low ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isotopes_of_lithium ) , so that it will very easily become helium . 
  the statement that no additional lithium was formed later is n't completely true ; younger stars can produce it ( wikipedia cites oxford university press 's * nature 's building blocks * as a source ) , but as it 's only barely stable , this is only in very small amounts . 
  superglue handles to the side and fasten them to the table via bar clamps ? 
  but if his goal is to get harry to defect , he is n't . 
  the reason i do n't have a problem with `` back round '' is that it does n't imply that it would be a `` regression '' on some scale of progress , just more similar to how things were historically than they are now . 
  otherwise , it would be saying something like , `` devolve back to writing in hieroglyphs '' . 
  without that , it 's not incorrect , especially since it 's possible that the latin alphabet is descended from hieroglyphs ( specifically , if proto-sinaitic was as well ) . 
   * pictographic * writing systems ... an example is egyptian hieroglyphs, 
  that 's what / u/pyromane _ wapusk was complaining about , though : it was n't . 
  it was n't even quite logographic ( although it did have elements like that ) ; it was more of an abjad than anything , reflected by how the egyptians could write it using the hieratic and demotic scripts as well , which used a limited set of glyphs . 
  you 'd be right for very early egyptian , though , and the meme in question is close to the mark in that sense . 
  ( who would bother adding an `` early '' qualifier to a meme ? ), 
  huh ? 
  wow , a few years ago they had 1 , but not 2 . 
  interesting . 
  not that it needs to be said , but red , while they have a point , is essentially wrong . 
  you need collections of alternative hypotheses to make scientific progress , but once you 've conclusively demonstrated that one theory is more probable than the other , you do n't keep using the less probable one . 
  sapir-whorf may not have lost all credibility , but strong sapir-whorf like the article was talking about is pretty much dead . 
  and red said as much , but why did they assume yellow meant all sapir-whorf ever , when yellow was clearly talking about it with respect to the article ? 
  that 's just being needlessly confrontational . 
  ( to be fair , yellow spoke dismissively of `` that whole sapir whorf stuff '' , so red 's reaction is somewhat understandable . ), 
  the problem is , org-mode does n't sync with my phone , and i ca n't edit it on there either . 
  the answer to your post would be the holy grail for me , since easily-editable universally-synchronized plaintext notes are pretty much all i want out of my phone , emacs , and life in general , but sadly i asked on this subreddit , and there 's no good way to edit org-mode on your phone . 
  in the distant future , if i have free time , i might try to write such an editor , but there 's a lot of other projects in the way , and i 'm not the best man for it . 
  re : stigmatization of double negation vs operations on formal numbers :, 
  the semantic inconsistency these people are pointing out is n't in terms of multiplication , but in terms of propositional logic , whose whole purpose is to model statements about the world , just like declarative statements in language , and is thus perfectly natural to consider when thinking about semantics . 
  and in pl , \u00ac ( \u00ac p ) does indeed evaluate to p . that said , language of course does n't necessarily have to map 1:1 onto pl when considering its syntactic structure , as evidenced by the many negative concord lects in use today , such as the ones you mentioned ( or my confusing native language , hungarian ... `` nem csin\u00e1lok semmit se '' , what does the `` se '' there even mean ? 
  not much clearly , since it 's optional in modern parlance ) . 
  hmm . 
  i guess most people are thinking about the logic part of it , but do n't know propositional logic , so make the argument of multiplying negatives instead . 
  well , uruguay is n't landlocked, 
  what about bengal ? 
   most annoying , difficult , frustrating thing in ksp . 
  what about tylo landings or eve launches ? 
  for me it 's mainly an issue of framerate and timescale . 
  it took me 45 minutes to learn to dock , because the crafts were simple and the computer ran completely smoothly throughout . 
  to go to eve and back , however , it took 200 hours , because asparagus-staging everything in the editor was extremely tedious and difficult and buggy , and getting to eve in between tests also took a bunch of time , mainly because launch was like 1 fps and extremely unstable . 
  ( i suppose this was before the stability enhancements of 0.22 . ), 
  pie only had an active and middle voice , with interesting repercussions for all its descendants . 
  [ alas , my phone ca n't run * anything * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jeakr2r.png ), 
  no we can create lots of great art using computers . 
  even really simple algorithms can produce beautiful stuff ; see for example [ `` the sierpinski triangle page to end most sierpinski triangle pages '' ] ( http://www.oftenpaper.net/sierpinski.htm ) , which derives some really cool pictures by generalizing algorithms that make the sierpinski triangle , such as [ this ] ( http://www.oftenpaper.net/img/sierrander1x.png ) and [ this ] ( http://www.oftenpaper.net/img/sier3drander12.png ) and [ this ] ( http://www.oftenpaper.net/img/sierranderparam9.png ) ( but there 's really so many great ones to choose from , some of which might do it for you far better than these three samples ) . 
  or take a look at [ this page ] ( http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/22144/images-with-all-colors ) where programmers try to write a creative algorithm that generates a picture that includes every color to a certain depth exactly once . 
  there 's some really great stuff there , like the [ top answer ] ( http://i.stack.imgur.com/mlil8.png ) or the [ second-best answer ] ( http://i.stack.imgur.com/er15o.jpg ) . 
  i believe the pioneer of getting computers to make art was benoit b. mandelbrot , who played around with computers in the 80s and 90s until they produced pretty fractals . 
  you can of course argue that it 's people writing the algorithms that produce the art , but you could say the same for chess . 
  i do n't think they were meant to be regular cells, 
  no , they 're not normal cells . 
  they 're a special kind of cell biologists use to model human cells , originating from the tumor of one woman from the 60s , henrietta lacks ( who unfortunately died from it ) . 
  most human cells will eventually die out if you try and culture them , because their chromosomes degrade every time you copy them , but cancer cells will happily grow indefinitely , which is why we use these things . 
  like any cancer cell , though , they 're crazy messed up ; here 's their [ disgusting karyotype ] ( http://www.htcl.cytspb.rssi.ru/tomors/hela-s3.files/image003.jpg ) . 
  well , of just one of them ; there 's probably lots of genetic variation between all the different ones in laboratories around the world . 
  exactly how many you have of each chromosome does n't matter so much when you 're all roided up already anyway . 
  ( figuratively ; to be clear , they have nothing to do with steroids ), 
  i liked it all , even though it was almost purely exposition . 
  sometimes you can include a good monologue ( or sesquilogue \\* , more like ) , and there 's nothing too weird about it . 
  the most hamfisted moment imo was the `` ad hominem tu quoque '' moment . 
  that just felt so didactic and awkward , even if it was n't intended to be that . 
  maybe because `` points out logical fallacies '' is a common stereotype of a rationalist . 
  \\* although `` sesqui - '' is latin while `` mono - '' is greek , i do n't know what the ancient greek for `` one and a half '' is , and even if i did , it would probably be overly long and/or unintelligible . 
  hooray !, 
  it 's strange , i 've observed surgeries in person and shrugged , but even thinking about cancer cells , especially their dna , creeps me the fuck out, 
  edit : and when i think about how i share almost all of my dna with the creepy little fuckers ... ugh, 
  salty as hell though . 
  that 's not very healthy , and also makes it impossible to enjoy them after continuously munching on them for upwards of 10 minutes . 
  holy shit , thanks !, 
  i love gold . 
  american intervention in iran may have been horrible , but it sure improved their flag, 
  i 'm miffed only one of these was included in the original post, 
  is the venn diagram of / r/paradoxplaza and / r/polandball just a circle now ??!?!, 
  `` karyotype '' is a picture of all their chromosomes , i.e. 
  the dna in each cell . 
  you see how they have three of most of them , and even four of some of them ? 
  that should not be happening ; they should only have two . 
  as a consequence of having too many copies of each gene , * every * gene in those cells is overactive , making the cells crazy and able to divide as much as they like . 
  most of the normal biochemical processes that should be going on in regular human cells are probably atrophied in them , and only a few basic things work , but that seems to be enough . 
  hey np !, 
  it 's hard to pinpoint just one cause of why the processes stop working . 
  epigenetics is an extremely rickety and difficult business , and stuff can fail for no apparent reason , or every apparent reason . 
  each gene may be dependent on several other genes to work , and several other genes to * not * work , and the timing on working and not working can be critical , so you get something like , the inhibitor of a particular gene 's dose is upped to twice its normal concentration , so the gene now gets inhibited pretty much all the time , but this gene was * also * an inhibitor of a rarely-used gene , so now this * new * protein is getting made , which might stimulate yet another gene ... it 's an uncoordinated mess . 
  in that case it will turn out monroe was betrothed to ginny, 
   harry will somehow persuade quirrell to use the stone to make himself not a sociopath . 
  the only tom riddle that actually enjoys life is the tom that can care about other people ; this is probably not coincidence . 
  he might not even have to convince him . 
  consider riddle sr stoning himself into harry , and killing harry to take his place . \\* this would be a convenient plan for a number of reasons , such as that quirrel 's death would be plausible . 
  however , if quirrel copies harry 's form to a sufficient degree , it will also copy his neural patterns that make him not a sociopath . 
  so , if he does n't kill harry first ( it 's unlikely that he 'd kill him first , since having an original to compare the copy to is useful ) , he might not kill harry at all , or anyone else ever . 
  \\* not that riddle sr , and not that stoning ( or that stoning ) . 
  no , then there 'd be two peaks for the two t 's, 
  possibly . 
  looks slightly different from his usual style though, 
  ah , it 's great but why not load the gun headfirst !, 
  they 'd be terrible at actually spying , but at least they have the mental capacity for it .
