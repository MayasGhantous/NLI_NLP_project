  alternatively elephants . 
  hungarian would be better for that , though , hah . 
  ( and when you 're in hungary , use english , [ huehuehuehue ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/english_foreign_and_second_language_eu.jpg ) ), 
  what color ? 
  we have to know !, 
  your austronesian neighbors would be disappointed if they saw you spell it `` oi '' rather than `` oy '', 
  what 's your opener ? 
  i 'd abandon iberia by taking southeast ireland and from there taking east frisia . 
  then take over the hre , etc. 
  and of course , the one time i played as the ottos , the timurids were somehow able to keep persia without releasing them , and also took over the entirety of india and formed the mughals . 
  then they started blobbing into arabia . 
  the only good thing was that they were allied to me . 
  i might have wrought it myself by constantly paying off their loans . 
  sukhotai , and you 're doing okay-ish . 
  you should have grabbed stuff in the new world to westernize with . 
  hmm , i 'm skeptical , as sulu i usually got exploration around 1480 ... but anyway , congrats on the conquest of ayutthaya !, 
  i 'm not sure of the particulars ( there seems to be no contrastive stress , for example ) , but it 's hard to beat the related [ marshallese ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshallese_language ) for ridiculous vowel clusters . 
  this is primarily because it abounds with semivowels , and because it 's an inverse , more complicated , symmetric russian -- whereas in russian , there are two kinds of vowels ( soft and hard ) , and consonants allophonize depending on what kind of vowel comes after them , in marshallese , there are * three * kinds of * consonants * ( palatalized , velarized , and labialized ) , and vowels allophonize to unique diphthongs depending on what kinds of consonants are on * both * ends of them . 
  this leads to hilarity such as ailinginae atoll , whose name is apparently pronounced [ \u0251\u032f\u0251\u0361\u00e6el\u02b2e\u0361\u0264\u014b\u026f\u0361in\u02b2 - \u0251\u032f\u0251\u0361\u00e6\u025b\u025b\u032f ] \\ ( orthographically realized as ael\u014dn\u0304in - ae ) . 
  you might find some of the shorter ones more impressive , though :, 
  - amerika , [ \u0251\u032f\u0251\u0361\u00e6m\u02b2\u025br\u032a\u02b2 ( \u025b\u0361\u028c ) \u0261\u0251\u0251\u032f ] \\ ( amedka ), 
  your post took a while to figure out , because all three names you use usually refer to the same person , i.e. 
  the immortal stargazing entity, 
  how ? 
  hopefully not on the level of the map reveal bug ? 
  if the user id ends in a w, 
  this is because the basetax is 0 . 
  did you just get cop and open an old save ? 
  sorry , even if it 's true , from our perspective it 's more likely you made it up . 
  it 's exactly like those stories where people say , `` and then the whole restaurant burst into applause ! '', 
  then again , it 's also like those weird things people actually do when they get very mad . 
  but made-up stories are more common on the internet by far . 
  the inside of the elephant is highly pressurized, 
   primitive tech groups can no longer build ships, 
  whyyy ? 
  no basis in reality , no discernible added challenge . 
  i recently went on vacation to constantinople , and then baluchistan !, 
  no , but hunter-gatherers in general absolutely did n't not build ships . 
  otherwise you 'd have a hell of a time explaining malayo-polynesia , or madagascar , or the maldives , or the caribbean . 
  could you please explain the difference ? 
  is it something like :, 
  - hp readers were * informed * that dumbledore is an accomplished chessmaster , and in the story , his plots tended to work very often by author fiat , even if it seemed extremely improbable , whereas, 
  - in hpmor , dumbledore is an intelligent agent operating reasonably well given the universe he 's in , i.e. 
  closer to an actual person rather than a storytelling device ? 
  ( sorry , that was n't a good explanation ), 
  honestly i 'd like espionage to be a lot , lot more powerful in this game in general , in the same manner that espionage was/is powerful irl . 
  do n't give me a ledger !, 
  make me have to spy on countries for troop numbers !, 
  let me steal tech , sabotage military operations , etc. 
  there could be so much more . 
  there 's a difference , but if you take away ships entirely , then there 's no naval travel at all , meaning no exploration , or transportation of armies . 
  just nerf the ships ' combat ability by a ton instead . 
  that 's not the point . 
  you do n't get to those places and * then * develop ships . 
  the fact that those places got populated means that tribal societies are frequently navally capable . 
  i also want to be able to sabotage individual streams of intelligence ; i.e. , concealing where my troops are , preventing * their * troops from receiving orders . 
  this could be represented as being able to exile the enemy 's troops , and being able to create fog of war . 
  however , this will probably never happen unless paradox independently becomes convinced that it 's necessary . 
  too cumbersome to implement . 
  not if you could also have counter-counterintelligence . 
  an easy limiting mechanic would be to give each country some sort of arbitrarily-scaled `` spy power '' based on their stability , advisors , how much they spend on intelligence , etc. 
  if your `` spy power '' is too far below another country 's , you ca n't conduct these sorts of ops . 
   plus there 's a fair amount of linguists who think uralic part of the ie family anyway ... 
  they 're closer to the turkic languages than the ie languages at all , but there 's no good evidence linking them to either . 
  plus , there 's known loanwords from pu into pie , so there 's already grounds for believing that that similarity is due to loaning . 
  giving those claims of relation credibility is bad linguistics . 
  i was !, 
  i learned it from * the cartoon guide to the history of the universe 2 * , which used it to describe what the romans ( or carthaginians ? ), 
  did to some of the people they conquered . 
  there was no mention of it not having such a technical meaning nowadays , just that the romans decimated whoever and that meaning that they killed 1/10th of them . 
  subsequently i was later confused/annoyed when the definition did n't hold up in stuff i read later . 
  we know all the countries of 16th-century indochina , in order of east to west , but for contemporary countries ? 
  there 's , um , thailand , and lao , and vietnam , and khmer , and burma , and cham ... 
  edit : also , ceylon should be green , as should the papal state and most of indonesia ( either because it 's not named malaya or because they 're not named majapahit , makassar , and so on ) , india should be light blue striped with green ( as it 's somehow not named hindustan ) , and singapore should be red . 
  edit 2 : actually , if you look very closely , the ps * is * green . 
  imo that could refer to as much as the entire latter half of a month, 
  what about crises if you 're not a great power ? 
  the extra tension can be crucial, 
  unless it 's v getting what he wants . 
  but he was getting that anyway . 
  i would have liked perenelle for the final boss , even if she was only fully introduced as a character in the final arc . 
  she seems like an interesting foe to go up against . 
  in many central and eastern european languages , the word for `` punch line '' comes from german `` pointe '' , itself a loan from french and ultimately from latin `` punctum '' ( pricked thing ) , from which the english word `` pun '' also comes . 
  some of these can end up looking quite like `` pun '' :, 
  - hungarian : po\u00e9n, 
  - polish : puenta, 
  - serbo-croatian : poenta, 
  as far as i can tell , there 's no cognate in turkish , but op may have learned one of these languages ( probably german ) and extrapolated based on that . 
  admittedly , even after speaking english for over a decade , it 's still difficult for me to disentangle english `` pun '' from my hungarian notion of `` po\u00e9n '' . 
  lol , this is a fantastic word . 
  brb , notifying linguists all over the world to somehow incorporate this into their terminology . 
  ( the word you 're looking for is `` agglutinating '' . ), 
  i think the problem is less that turkish is agglutinating and more that it 's polysynthetic . 
  finnish works horribly too , even though it 's not very agglutinative , but it still has a million cases and nine billion verb endings . 
  tagalog , on the other hand , works reasonably well , even though it 's highly agglutinative , but barely inflecting . 
  in a sufficiently dense medium , you 're right !, 
  ah , finally , a historical brunei ^ * sob *, 
  yes , niger is known for its mangroves, 
  ** tl ; dr : ** i am working on a game in which the map is extremely huge -- at the very least three 2.2 mb pngs -- and i need to update vast swathes of it very quickly , ideally several times a second ( but it can be slower ) . 
  ** can anyone suggest ways to optimize ?
