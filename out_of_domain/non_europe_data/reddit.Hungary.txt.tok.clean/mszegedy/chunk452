  i tried the same thing pre-ed with the country that speaks the most conservative austronesian language available on the map , sulu ( who speak tausug ) , but the objective was to conquer spain as well . 
  the takeover of all of sea asia ( plus madagascar ) was basically just a coincidence . 
  ^ ( disclaimer : i do n't speak finnish ), 
  everything is real . 
  because i did n't know about it . 
  i set it up manually . 
  i gave myself cores on all gold provinces . 
  originally i wanted to start by owning every gold province , but it turned out that there were simply too many , so i just gave myself cores on them . 
  `` lihapiirakka '' canonically refers to a pastry stuffed with ground meat , but really is used to describe a broad range of dishes , which you can investigate by google image search-ing [ `` lihapiirakka hot dog '' ] ( https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=791&amp;q=lihapiirakka+hot+dog&amp;oq=lihapiirakka+hot+dog&amp;gs_l=img.3...5513.15250.0.15474.20.19.1.0.0.0.225.2333.0j17j1.18.0.clfrh...0...1.1.62.img..8.12.1511.yk0ffy9pedy ) . 
  other than being an actual meat pie , it can also be very close to being an american hot dog , and certain lihapiirakkas probably match up exactly with certain hot dogs . 
  i was out of bread and relish , so mine was made with two sausages , ketchup , mustard , mayonnaise , and `` bajan seasoning '' ( some sort of garlic thing ) . 
  well , * that 's * somewhat historical . 
  there 's no more goths or old prussians around these days , for example . 
  they 're all the worst, 
  except for the part where they upvote shitty things to the front page, 
  just provinces i own . 
  ( i got them using the '' ` own ` '' command . 
  they 're also cored . ), 
  i am currently writing such a thing . 
  how do you go about province rendering ? 
  what i have going is pretty solid , but i 'm curious . 
   south joisey, 
  thank you !, 
  the gc controller is about the shape of the 360 controller , so i do n't think there 's much to improve in that area , but i 'll have a look !, 
  and thank you for the cream , i 'll recommend it to her . 
  i have repeatedly heard finns call dishes such as [ this ] ( http://vuodatus-media-3.vuodatus.net/g/34108/1406213.jpg ) or [ this ] ( https://saxsilverain.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/lihapiirakka.jpg ) are lihapiirakka . 
  granted , it does n't look anything like the traditional dish , but what else am i supposed to say ih is then ? 
  oh no , i did not mean to imply that it 's called a hot dog , sorry !, 
  that was just the google search query that showed pictures of it . 
  for some reason just googling `` lihapiirakka '' returns pictures of the actual meat pie . 
  f , for france ? 
  you mean foix , right ? 
  *** fewer *** , not less , god , fucking , dammit !, 
  in subtractive color mixing ( i.e. 
  what happens with paints ) , cyan and magenta make red , and so blue and red make purple , ish . 
  / u/alynnidalar was talking about additive color mixing , where you mix light ( in the manner that computer screens do ) , instead of things that reflect the light , and all of the mixing is backwards -- red and blue make magenta , green and red make yellow , etc. 
  so he sees pink as red , plus white light to make it lighter , and some extra blue to make it closer to magenta than red . 
  while these guys are dumb , i do n't like the title 's sentiment . 
  if you * know * linguistics and how to do research for it , you should feel free to do research . 
  this applies to any science . 
   or are there contexts where the different semantic uses might not be so clear and the orthographic differences are necessary ? 
  it 's possible to construct such contexts , but they 're not common at all . 
  orthographies do n't have to be elegant , though , and at least in this case the three different usages are thankfully completely distinct and not complicated by weird usage rules . 
  not the rock itself , but the act of throwing the rock ? 
  well , more like , that 's how it was standardized , but yeah . 
  the point is , though , it does n't matter either way . 
  i 've already thought of this idea , but imo we must go deeper . 
  train a naive bayesian classifier to sort the posts instead . 
  \\* * world 's largest shrug * \\*, 
  it is not the sexy kind of nsfw, 
  i read somewhere that it 's staged , but i ca n't remember now whether it was a credible source . 
  damn it you could have made the title flow so much better . 
  `` pop tart top part pop art '' . 
  * interregnum intensifies *, 
  it could also be lao or khmer ( probably not the latter -- in fact , it 's probably thai ) . 
  you said it does n't look like you 'll finish in time , but blob growth is multiplicative . 
  if you blob big enough , you 'll be able to take large swathes of land at once and knock out maybe 20 provinces per war , at least . 
  ( note that this aar would have been easier if you had simply done a wc as austria . 
  even as aragon , though , you need to take over the hre asap . ), 
  keep in mind , if harry comes back to teach dada , that would technically fulfill his wish , too . 
  or memory charmed riddle . 
  i live in berkeley , sucks to be you guys !, 
  except i do n't want to go to a wrap party . 
  too embarrassing . 
  my impression is that non-syllabic [ \u00e6 ] is essentially [ j ] , and non-syllabic [ \u0251 ] is essentially [ \u0270 ] . 
  there 's also restaurants and a university, 
  it 's mostly a joke , and it has been almost immediately since it first came up and eliezer telegraphed the answer to it with his post . 
  that said , i want to play devil 's advocate . 
  1 , 3 , and 5 are irrelevant . 
  it 's a problem that needs solving , regardless of how it 's perceived from the outside . 
  as for 2 , it matters because it might not be exactly the same thing . 
  maybe harry will wake up in a few hours , for whatever reason ( e.g. 
  getting woken up by someone else from the outside , or just as a consequence of how the mirror works ) . 
  maybe the reality will randomly cease to exist in half a week , when the harry in front of the mirror dies of thirst . 
  maybe the mirror has computational constraints on it that are n't present in the real world . 
  4 is an acceptable casualty in the face of actually solving an important problem . 
   assuming the `` until death '' clause of that vow has n't released her ,, 
  oh , that 's a good point . 
  that seems likely . 
  yes , happened to one of my mesoamerican tech custom nations . 
  they 're not irrelevant to how to solve the problem , but they are irrelevant to * whether * you should solve the problem . 
  the problem is there and it is important . 
  in that case , why is it divisible by 12 ? 
  it could be a coincidence , but it * is * suspicious . 
  from the context you should infer that it 's the scrabble dictionary, 
  nj confirmed . 
  ( also probably where / u/maxcheater64 is from -- it is a rather populous state after all ), 
  does that thing really look like it has ailerons ? 
  it 's between italy and greater germany , of course it will be more progressive than the slavs stuck in the east, 
  historically , the greeks and phoenicians were [ fucking amazing colonists ] ( http://www.ancient.eu/uploads/images/108.jpg ? ) . 
  i guess in this period they 'd be colonizing africa or something .
