  when i play ottos , the damn portuguese always get to africa before me , but perhaps with a well-seized colony , some eastern land taken , and/or luck they can manage it . 
  even cutoff at the corners of the houses with arched roofs ... great job !, 
   most evolved, 
  that phrase makes no sense . 
  they * were * , however , at one point the most intelligent . 
  they invented neurons !, 
  nope . 
  hungarian and finnish are uralic languages . 
  here is how it goes :, 
  - ** micro-altaic ** ( discredited , was somewhat popular half a century ago ) : turkic , mongolic , tungusic languages ; e.g. 
  turkish , mongolian , and manchu, 
  - ** macro-altaic ** ( discredited , and even more ridiculous ) : all those plus japonic , koreanic , ainu languages ; e.g. 
  japanese , korean , and ainu, 
  - ** ural-altaic ** ( discredited , was somewhat popular half a century ago ) : all those plus uralic ; e.g. 
  finnish, 
  - ** eurasiatic ** ( discredited , recently renewed in credibility ) : all those plus indo-european , and a handful of other families ; e.g. 
  french , german , gaelic , russian , albanian , persian , hindustani . 
  does not include the dravidian languages such as tamil , the afro-asiatic languages such as arabic and hebrew , or the asiatic languages such as vietnamese , or the sinitic languages such as mandarin . 
  there is no doubt that a lot of words between these are similar , though . 
  the hypotheses strictly concern the idea that there was once a single language from which these all descended . 
  some of the evidence is especially compelling , though ; really basic words such as pronouns are suspiciously similar between the three . 
  for example , compare the following three words for `` who '' :, 
  - hungarian : ki, 
  - turkish : kim, 
  these are nearly identical to their proto-indo-european , proto-uralic , and proto-turkic equivalents ( the only reason i did n't list those instead is i do n't know what the proto-turkic one is ) . 
  the other pronouns also look similar . 
  regardless , it could entirely be just borrowings . 
  hungary-austria ... or just hungary really,

  the [ original flash version ] ( http://palaceofchairs.deviantart.com/art/s-john-just-lose-it-288486225 ) was posted well over a year ago !, 
  checkmate !, 
  ah , i thought you were implying that that was the only other time it was ever posted here . 
  is n't it weird how this is `` old '' , and yet includes the alpha kids ? 
  exactly !, 
  they 're like barnacles, 
  and champagne is a big , important place in its own right -- what 's the use of the reference to paris ? 
  i really wish there was one with just random colored noise \u00e0 la missingno , that would be awesome . 
  but i really like a lot of these too . 
  source : lived in hesse for long while ; my father 's side of the family fled there from communist hungary during the cold war, 
  that 's the pixel slur filter for you, 
  that 's why you write `` champagne , france '', 
  the united states of usa, 
  exactly , which is why i listed it as an example of an ie or dravidian language . 
  ( the only dravidian example among those is tamil ; the rest are ie ), 
  aw , thanks !, 
  i keep a carpet of moss on my desk . 
  it 's great ( and also literally dank ), 
  maybe it does ? 
  i found [ this ] ( http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/2751/vowel-harmony-in-spanish ) using google, 
  no , they 're related because they 're both descended from proto-uralic . 
  pu was spoken by the uralic peoples on the eastern side of the ural mountains . 
  being nomadic , these peoples eventually migrated all over the place . 
  some migrated west and became the finns , estonians , karelians , and sami . 
  some migrated east and became the samoyeds ( these people migrated away first ) .
