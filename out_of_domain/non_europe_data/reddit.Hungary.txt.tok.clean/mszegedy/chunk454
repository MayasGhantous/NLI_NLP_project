  some did n't migrate much at all , and became all the finnic peoples stuck in russia today -- the komi , the mordvins , the khantys and mansis , etc. 
  and the magyars , they migrated southwest , taking a rather circuitous route through persia and bashkiria that landed them in the modern carpathian basin . 
  they managed to impose their language on the carpathian locals ( part of whom became the hungarians ) , and then died out . 
  finnish is actually the most conservative of the uralic languages , and hungarian perhaps one of the least ( although that title might go to one of the samoyedic languages instead ) . 
  compare this [ list of selected cognates ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uralic_languages#selected_cognates ) on wikipedia . 
  often i 'll put thousands of characters of effort into a post in an obscure thread in a small subreddit , and check back frequently for the next couple days to see whether anyone noticed it . 
  once i got gilded for one of those , though , so i ca n't complain . 
  this post ( and op 's comments ) are a dead ringer for / r/hailcorporate , but it 's also entirely believable that op just happened to want to share their love for a grocery store . 
  people do talk this way , and it 's really unnerving . 
  edit : what 's more interesting is that it made the front page . 
  how ?? 
  something something delete the lawyer, 
  where did you actually grow up ? 
  everybody knows north dakota does n't actually exist . 
  ( it 's all a conspiracy by the organization known as sie . ), 
  zee, 
  i 'll bet it works great in the south, 
  honestly , though , cknd has a point . 
  we 've already * got * telepathy . 
  it 's just that there 's drawbacks . 
  in messages , you can set the game to pause and give a message if something or other has arrived . 
  that does n't stop your blockades from dying , but it is helpful in other situations . 
  you allied hungary ??? 
  unless they 've actually taken austria , as it appears in the picture ... 
  that 's not a permanent position . 
  itt : agglutinative languages ( but mostly german ), 
  mind you , manufacturing a certain amount of glass makes a certain amount of co2 . 
  it 's not trivial which one 's more environmental . 
  meh , this is the issue with many ted talks . 
  they 're never especially informative if you have any clue about the subject . 
  but the shelves have a finite lifetime . 
  it 's possible that the co2 cost incurred by making and transporting the door over is greater than the overall co2 cost of having a leaky shelf for x amount of time . 
  and the glass doors do n't last forever , either ; while after a certain amount of time spent having a leaky shelf , you will definitely have lost enough energy equivalent to getting * one * round of doors , you do have to replace doors every so often when they get broken . 
  in the end you ca n't really know , unless you multiply it out . 
  maybe making glass produces a surprisingly large amount of co2 . 
  maybe using electricity uses surprisingly little . 
  maybe it 's the other way around . 
  yes !, 
  for aesthetics in general , i reccommend turkish , but if you 're a fan of prosody , tourism , and beginner-friendly literature , i reccommend italian . 
  cool !, 
  fyi , duolingo should be getting turkish soon , so there should n't be much of a problem with accessibility . 
  if you meant ease of learning in general , yeah , it 's highly synthetic , unlike english , german , or italian , but it 's structurally similar to most of the languages of asia ( like mine , hungarian !, 
  ) , so it 's really useful to learn if you plan to learn any more . 
  this is my ulm game right now . 
  ( getting invaded by bohemians ), 
  i do n't . 
  as an arch user , what makes systemd so terrible ? 
   poland can into lucky nation, 
  any reason why this might be ? 
  historically they did get rekt pretty often . 
  that i can get behind . 
  eww , tab is made with sugar substitutes ? 
  yes please , god . 
  if the amount of [ x ] 's does n't get fixed , i 'm posting a parody to / r/conlangscirclejerk, 
  o singlish , why did you have to be the one english-based creole without inclusive/exclusive first person pronoun distinction ? 
  the superstrate languages have it , even hokkien !, 
  long austria, 
  portugal looks too weak to seriously consider colonization . 
  the uk looks like it just lost some war , judging by released cornwall * and * scotland . 
  which one is that , by the way ? 
  also , many of them are * de facto * independent ( well , sphered by neighboring countries , but still ) :, 
  - north cyprus, 
  - south ossetia ? 
  - chechnya ??? 
  - not kurdistan , that 's for sure, 
  by the way , they forgot venice ( which may actually become independent ) and transylvania/szeklerland ( which never will ) . 
  do it !, 
  it worked with singapore, 
  what the hell did austria inherit ? 
  nope . 
  itt is commonly understood to stand for `` in this thread '' . 
  it 's a piece of art ; if you 're looking for accuracy , you 're better off with a textbook . 
  the amount of reddit tropes in this is off the fucking charts ... see you on the front page !, 
  everything is just [ m ], 
  purple blob in southern mesoamerica , ~ 1520s, 
  & gt ; a lot, 
  ha , ha , hah . 
  but seriously though , i super empathize with you . 
  the game tries to punish military expansion in any way possible , which is reasonable considering map painting is the point of the game . 
  you 'll continue picking up tricks for the next several hundred hours to come . 
  in this case , what could have saved you was aggressive expansion management , hiring tons and tons of mercs and going into debt , and taking large chunks of north africa while it was still a bunch of tiny states . 
  as portugal , killing france early on is also feasible , but probably too advanced for a beginner . 
  a state demonstrably does n't have to be a nationstate to be successful/feasible / `` real '' , though . 
  the usa for example , as is written about in many sources , is made up of a number of large nations , and it still gets by fine . 
  ( there was a separatist war a while back , but that was resolved . ), 
  what probably helps is that the usa is a federation , as opposed to a monolithic state . 
  that is absolutely not what i am talking about . 
  there are texts on the substantial regional differences between parts of the usa , most notably garreau 's book [ * the nine nations of north america * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_nine_nations_of_north_america ) and woodard 's more easily digestible [ 11 nations ] ( http://www.tufts.edu/alumni/magazine/fall2013/features/up-in-arms.html ) . 
  believe me when i say an entire continent is not even roughly culturally homogeneous !, 
  have you met americans , though ? 
  they will definitely clarify -- usually to little effect -- what state they are from . 
  cobol never changes, 
  while i agree with all of this , your post seems a bit myopic , focusing on a single sentence while dismissing the entire thing . 
  the rest deserves its own rebuttal . 
  arab dick ? 
  the us * really is n't * a nationstate in the same way that most european countries are nationstates . 
  semantic arguments go nowhere , and i 'm too tired for a well-researched rebuttal , so i 'll hand you this [ map of country heterogeneity \\* ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/ethnic_diversity.jpg ) and note that 150 years ago , the entire southern half of the us waged a war of separatism . 
  it 's true that nowadays the us is n't as divided anymore as it was back then , but you can totally still see the seismic faults , especially if you go visit for yourself multiple such parts . 
  ( i am an immigrant to the us , and i did a trip across the us a few months ago , so maybe i just have this on my mind . ), 
  you do n't even have to leave reddit -- about a day ago , there was [ a / r/facepalm post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/2z1bf3/i_grew_up_in_the_united_states_which_apparently/ ) in which somebody claimed that americans should consider the confederate battle flag their heritage , and / r/facepalm disagreed , saying that the confederate flag is part of * southern * heritage , which is separate from * northern * heritage .
