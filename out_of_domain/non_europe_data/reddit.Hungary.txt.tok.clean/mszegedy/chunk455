  ( apparently westerners got shafted here . ), 
  or you can read every single / r/news post , where everything gets blamed on `` those idiots in the south '' . 
  claiming that the us is culturally homogeneous enough to be considered a nationstate is sort of like , in a world where germany encompassed switzerland , austria , and luxembourg also , is homogeneous enough to be considered a nationstate , because they all speak the same language , more or less , and share a national identity . 
  race is another thing entirely , because it is n't completely geographic , but another important distinction ( that i wo n't talk about much because i do n't know much about it ) that shows the heterogeneity of the us . 
  generally when talking about national identity , we disregard minorities , because they are , well , a minority , but black people constitute about an eighth of the us , and have a curious separate identity all of their own , with their own media and dialect and so on . 
  they definitely do n't feel like they `` belong together '' with the rest of the us , and the recent race riots in ferguson , missouri show that somewhat . 
  \\* the map is n't really helpful to support my argument in any way , since ultimately you 're just relying on the authority of whoever made it , but it is still cool . 
  some parts are dumb , like china being an allegedly completely homogeneous nationstate , but overall it 's nice . 
  ( also , they forgot to color in belize . ), 
  you know , i just realized that i 've been reading your name wrong all this time . 
  it is not `` taong kalye '' , which makes little sense , but `` tao ng kalye '' , `` man of the street '' !, 
  \\ # 7 in population is n't that important . 
  go to the 7th largest city in pretty much any country , it 's guaranteed to be really irrelevant . 
  besides the us , then . 
  for example , in my country , hungary , i am from ( and am currently in ) the 7th largest city by population , miskolc , and who 's heard of us ? 
  even inside our country , we are known for very little , besides having large amounts of gypsies ( and i 'm not sure where that comes from ) . 
  we used to produce iron , and that 's pretty much it . 
  not always . 
  this happens in google chrome on ios , for example , and why would they do it ? 
  even if it tangibly made google money , which it does n't , the company is too decentralized for that . 
  how would you do it ? 
  there 's two basic options -- allow the user to access the webpage while it 's loading , or do n't . 
  each has its disadvantages . 
  the first one appears snappier to the user , and is sometimes more convenient , but results in users accidentally clicking on ads . 
  the second one has the user accessing the page as it was originally designed , and in an unchanging fashion , but users are impatient , and often a page will never load completely , or will be fit for use long before it 's finished completely loading . 
  imo i 'd put some sort of translucent overlay over the page while it 's loading , and have the user be able to tap the overlay once to get it to disappear early . 
  probably david tennant as barty crouch jr. in the 4th film . 
  how often actually are adjectives postpositioned in tagalog ? 
  i always hear them first . 
  that would be nice , but the `` layout '' you 're talking about is the html and css ( and php , and js i guess ) , and that , while specifying many parts of what things look like , does n't usually include the actual sizes of the pictures . 
  i 'm not sure if you can get just the picture sizes by loading only part of the picture , but that would necessarily depend on the file format . 
  wayyy too long . 
  ottoman african state in iraq and syria , or oasis for short . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  the * guys who control the implementation of google chrome on ios ? 
   the south did not feel they were a seperate nation whose people should be allowed to rule themselves . 
  they wanted to keep slaves . 
  that 's just wrong . 
  you 've got to go and read their history books . 
  some of them even call it the `` war of northern aggression '' , although i do n't know how widespread that is anymore . 
   if black people were to be given equal representation to white people ( i.e. 
  in government , the police force , proportional amounts of inmates , ... ) the us ' race problem would be over . 
  oh ho ho ho ho you fucking wish . 
  if it were that simple ... 
  unfortunately i am too tired to argue any further . 
  i concede that the us does n't suffer from the same problems as belgium . 
  ( which was sort of my original point . 
  if a non-nation-state is a state which suffers particular problems from having more than one nation , then the argument is circular and our walls of text were pointless . ), 
  but it 's not obligatory , nor should it be . 
  this stuff 's automatic for a reason .

  op 's post was actually my household about a decade ago , but the dude was my father , and the game was ... online go . 
  i 'm not even kidding . 
  we 'd go to vacation in france , and he 'd find the nearest internet cafe , boot up gokgs , and hole up . 
  i think you 've got it . 
  even before he started and after he stopped playing it 24/7 , there were a lot of problems with his inattentiveness regarding the marriage . 
  ( they 're still together , funnily enough , but i 'm worried about the marriage 's stability after my sister leaves home for university . ), 
  oh , pick one .

  did poland inherit bosnia ? 
  the ie language family originates from ruthenia , though . 
  so a hilarious and accurate comic would involve ukraine using the pan , and suddenly being bigger than russia . 
  ( in fact , encompassing it . ), 
  alternatively , lithuanian is the most conservative ie language , so ie belongs to it in that sense . 
  less joke potential , though . 
  that 's realistic unless you control sinai though, 
  strange . 
  i thought it was from the nearest port , not the capital . 
  i 'm curious , why is conquering india imperative as ryukyu ? 
  should n't you be going after east africa or imploded china ? 
   ( unified islam has a lot more impact on the gameplay than this ) . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  hmm , i ca n't take the time to dig one up for you , but it 's strange how sparse they are . 
  i swear it 's mentioned in passing in a bunch of places , like [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indo-european_languages#important_languages_for_reconstruction ) , but nobody actually cites some sort of comparison of the ie languages . 
  look into it yourself , i 'm sure you 'll find something !, 
  not necessarily grounded in reality . 
  see haiti for example . 
  the trouble is , eu4 has no pops .
