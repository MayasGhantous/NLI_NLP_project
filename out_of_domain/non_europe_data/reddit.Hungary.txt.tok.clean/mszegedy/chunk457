  the sz\u00e9kely flag was created in 1601 , near the reunification of transylvania with the rest of hungary . 
  that `` sieben b\u00fcrgen '' flag , though , was the state 's flag , not a flag to represent the german minority . 
  get your own !, 
  preferably with green and white !, 
  nope nope nope . 
  unless hungarian is broken slovak , which it is not !, 
  ( loanwords from another language do not that language make . 
  there are languages that have to put up with having a lot more loanwords than english does , e.g. 
  everybody in or next to china besides the chinese , everybody in russia besides the russians , and really most people besides those who belonged to a big empire at some point . ), 
  well , there 's other countries besides romania . 
  sweden and norway have sami , and slovakia has significant numbers of hungarians ( while serbia has * in * significant numbers of hungarians ) . 
  my understanding is they 're unwilling, 
  interesting , i 'll have to try that , thanks !, 
  no , it needed to be a country . 
  thanks for the suggestion though . 
  you 're gon na wait a loooot in between my pb comics , and the next two i have lined up are definitely intended to provoke discussion rather than humor !, 
  papal state popped in riga/livonian order/wherever, 
  papal state decided it needs land , possibly to prevent this from happening ever again, 
  papal state conquers finland and the baltic states , and also somehow the netherlands, 
  nope , does n't work . 
  strange, 
  but then why would it go on a conquering spree in the northeast ? 
  i think it can be a provinc any catholic country , but my source might have been simplifying . 
  the arrow appears orange and cute on my phone, 
  that 's an amazing idea . 
  oh not by the slovak people , by the slovak government . 
  e.g. , the suppression of the hungarian language by banning it in business interactions , and so forth . 
  your government does n't like us very much . 
  ( but slovaks are fine !, 
  i 'm from miskolc myself . 
  we used to pop over to slovakia and buy kofola and string cheese . ), 
  paging / r/badlinguistics, 
  and actually / r/badhistory too, 
  i 've never met a `` sanskrit is the mother of all languages '' nationalist before . 
  hungary , besides you , finland , and estonia , all the uralic languages are in russia . 
  are there any other states with with many uralics ? 
  ah , i just met this charming guy in another pb thread . 
  given that he used the word `` retard '' ( in my convo ) , i think he 's a kid . 
  not sure if he 's just trolling because he 's bored , or actually serious , but he 's sure not doing his country any favors . 
  most asian languages are agglutinative . 
  finnish is n't related to the dravidian languages . 
  noooooooooooo !, 
  you 're cherry-picking . 
  - neighbors :, 
  - historical friends and enemies :, 
  - turkish : macaristan, 
  - persian : \u0645\u062c\u0627\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 ( mad\u017earstan or something ), 
  - fellow uralic language speakers :, 
  the adjective : neesh, 
  the noun : nitch, 
  i picked up most of my english in central new jersey . 
  latitude does n't have much to do with temperature , though . 
  most of europe is further north than the entire us . 
  we do n't really . 
  depending on the dialect , we have more of palatal affricates -- [ c\u0361\u00e7 ] and [ \u025f\u0361\u029d ] . 
  i 've learned to pronounce the stops separately . 
  it boils off . 
  once , wilf had the idea of obscuring their eyesight with a paintball gun . 
  the paint just boiled and disappeared . 
  you were pretty far from it anyway , unless you live in germany, 
  interesting . 
  in hungary we call it `` turkish sitting '' . 
  wow , i just realized one can copy files with cat . 
  i 'm dummmmmb . 
  thanks !, 
  they * would * be that creative . 
  for programming , we have / r/programming for programming and / r/itsaunixsystem for inaccurate portrayal of programming . 
  but for chemistry , we do n't need such complications !, 
  we put them all in / r/chemistry , maybe hoping they 'll undergo a replacement reaction . 
  it 's wonderful !, 
  ( i really do not have any problem with it ; it 's just funny ), 
  a house ? 
  lego is made from [ abs plastic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene ) . 
  it 's a very tough resin , but according to one unsourced line in that wikipedia article , it `` should n't be used in medical implants '' , so , short of doing more research , i 'd stay on the safe side if i were you . 
  edit : or else you could just test it . 
  what you want is a `` btex/tpa '' test kit , like the `` petroleum hydrocarbons '' section of [ this thing ] ( http://www.modernwater.com/monitoring/environment/test-kits ) , except less expensive . 
  unfortunately i could n't find one that did n't cost astronomical amounts ( or have `` request quote '' ) , though . 
  edit 2 : [ this ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/app.1968.070120405/abstract?systemmessage=wiley+online+library+will+be+disrupted+on+21st+march+from+10%3a30+gmt+%2806%3a30+edt%29+for+up+to+six+hours+for+essential+maintenance.++apologies+for+the+inconvenience . ), 
  may be the article you want . 
  a house looks kinda like [ this ] ( http://images.nationalgeographic.com/wpf/media-live/photos/000/106/cache/octopus-inside-coconut_10655_600x450.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.oceanwideimages.com/images/17466/large/veined-octopus-24m1634-24d.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/i0000wzcxgr8uufy/s/750/750/sgj-lembeh-strait-2432.jpg ), 
  it 's okay , it 's syntactically correct perl ( then again anything is ), 
  my first thought was rot13 , but nope , that 's gibberish, 
  confidentiality is totally a thing , and creeps on the internet are absolutely definitely a thing . 
  it does n't matter if it did n't happen ; his story is very plausible . 
  absurdly low sample sizes are very typical for casual experiments . 
  often people do n't realize just how few data points they have for some sort of phenomenon they are investigating . 
  it ca n't be helped ; there 's not enough time and resources to investigate systematically . 
  the original blob king was charlemagne, 
  that 's a terrible flag !, 
  they should quarter the portuguese coat of arms with [ charles i 's coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/greater_coat_of_arms_of_charles_i_of_spain%2c_charles_v_as_holy_roman_emperor_%281530-1556%29.svg ) instead, 
  never mind that he spoke a franconian ( i.e. 
  dutch ) laguage , charlemagne was freeeeeench !, 
  imo it 's just you . 
  exposure to this sub makes you a whole lot more cynical of everybody 's posts , even your own , especially those that try to be informative , use longer words or phrases , talk about the poster themselves , or use synonyms instead of the most obvious word/phrase . 
  i notice it whenever i go on here . 
  ( i do n't know about these comments in particular . 
  i have n't read many of them . ), 
  you come out of this sub wanting to post everything to it . 
  that 's one of my favorite berndmades !, 
  the decision to make into a comic was excellent .
