  depends on the school . 
  i took 5 aps junior year of high school ( did n't know english so well then , either !, 
  ) , and it was a total breeze . 
  only had a couple teachers who assigned real work . 
  latin and greek ? 
  then interpret the question as being in the context of sound changes only , although the languages i mentioned do have more similar morphology to the original language ( finnish preserves the pu case system pretty well , tagalog preserves the complex pan verb system pretty well , lithuanian preserves the pie case system mildly better than other ie languages ) . 
  i apologize for mentioning lithuanian ; i just said it because it 's the go-to conservative ie language . 
  if you 're worried about me supporting my question , then just answer the first one . 
  what makes some languages more conservative than others ? 
  or if that 's too broad , what makes * finnish * more conservative * in its vocabulary * ? 
   why not ? 
  if you pick a language family and a feature to investigate , you will probably find that some languages in that family are more conservative with regards to that feature than others . 
  what i 'm curious about is , why did nearly every sound change fail to occur in finnish ? 
   you have three examples of languages that are more conservative in some respect that are spoken closer to the postulated proto-language urheimat . 
  what about other language families ? 
  what about other languages that are spoken closer , or farther away ? 
  tagalog , for example , is spoken in the philippines , not taiwan ; what about the formosan languages that are in taiwan ? 
  i asked about languages i knew enough about to claim that they are conservative . 
  i know very little about the formosan languages , for example , or the slavic languages . 
  the uralic languages admittedly do n't support the hypothesis that distance from urheimhat correlates with language change . 
  really , it was dumb to phrase the question like that ; it 's not a whole hypothesis i 've developed , it 's just what i 've noticed from my limited linguistic knowledge . 
  it should have been , `` why do the more phonetically conservative languages i know about seem to be closer to the urheimhat than other languages in their families ? 
  '' , to which the answer should have been , `` you have a small sample size . '', 
   this is a massive question !, 
  then focus on sound change in particular . 
  so conqs/explorers do get worse stats !, 
  open up debug/cheats mode , and disable gravity !, 
   because of the intricacy of their reproductive ritual , trolls have extraordinarily long refractory periods , especially as adolescents . 
  where was this stated ? 
  is this a well-researched theory ? 
  it sounds plausible , but then that would imply that language change rate correlates inversely with how many other speakers the average speaker would communicate with in their lifetime , and that 's not supported by my limited knowledge . 
   why are you ruling out random variation ? 
  that is , why do you assume that there is a reason that finnish has undergone fewer sound changes other than chance ? 
  some languages will naturally undergo more changes than others because there is nothing to hold rates of change constant across different languages . 
  there is a large element of chance . 
  there 's an element of chance , but assuming non-sequential sound changes are more or less independent from each other , it 's exceedingly unlikely that almost none of them will happen . 
  it 's hard to determine how unlikely without coming up with a model , but if you look at how often sound changes happened historically , then you can get a sense of how often they generally happened . 
   also -- there is no way to answer your question without solving the actuation problem . 
  that is , while we can find plausible explanations for many sound changes , none of these explanations are deterministic ; their presence does n't guarantee a change . 
  just like / \u03b8 / is likely to turn to / f / , but many varieties of english still have / \u03b8 / . 
  why does finnish -- if it is more conservative -- have cases in its history where it did n't undergo the same sound change as other uralic languages , even if the same factors were present ? 
  we simply do not know . 
  well , you can model it probabilistically -- say that there is a continuous , flat probability distribution of a particular sound change occurring , say a 1 % chance per year . 
  this does n't point towards a way of explaining rates of sound change , but sometimes it 's possible to come up with a larger-scale explanation without knowing how exactly the smaller things work . 
  back when it fired more often , people complained about it being nearly a scripted event and thus making the game more boring . 
  what does it take to please you guys ? 
  admittedly `` almost no '' is an overstatement , but the number * is * vastly less than you typically see in other languages . 
  looking at single words , it only takes a few sound changes to get from pu to finnish , while typically in a language every phoneme of a word is different from the few-thousand-years-ago version . 
  and it 's not like finnish has an exceptionally big phonology , either . 
  maybe it * is * just chance , but it sure is remarkable . 
  i do n't see why the only way to explain sound change rate is to explain why any individual sound change happened when it did . 
  i know comparing fuzzier fields to hard science is pass\u00e9 , but surely you see the value in a comparison to a physicist saying that one ca n't make any statements about thermodynamics until one can predict the movement of individual particles . 
   you 're now making a weaker claim than '' [ finnish ] preserves most proto-uralic roots almost exactly '' ; we 've moved on to `` it only takes a few sound changes to get from pu to finnish . '', 
  this is n't surprising to me at all , because the same is true , for example , of many pie roots in contemporary indo-european languages . 
  before agreeing that finnish is as extremely conservative as you claim -- because it does n't seem that way to me -- i would like to see this conservativity quanitified in a meaningful way . 
  this question really was n't meant to get this technical . 
  [ look at this list of pu terms , and their cognates in uralic languages . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uralic_languages#selected_cognates ) why do the finnish ones resemble the pu almost exactly ? 
  5/15 ( or 6/15 if you reconstruct < \u015b  as [ s ] ) are exactly the same thing , and most of the other ones are explained by a single sound change ( such as intervocalic lenition of [ t ] to [ s ] , or lowering of [ \u026f ] to [ a ] and [ i ] to [ e ] ) . 
  you could typically hardly do this well if you were specifically trying to pick words that resemble the ancient roots in a particular language , never mind if you were trying to build an example list of cognates across the entire family . 
  does this have to do with how pu was reconstructed ? 
  or is it just a huge coincidence ? 
  if you honestly think it 's a coincidence , i 'll accept it , but it 's hard to swallow . 
  dude i tried this and it was a brilliant idea , thanks !, 
  - with rice : 8/10, 
  - with teff : 9/10, 
  - ( with [ semolina ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semolina ) / flour : 10/10 , it 's simply the perfect consistency ... maybe i should try this with teff flour , and maybe accidentally make injera ), 
  ugh , the puppeteer is so creepy . 
  poor jeff . 
  i tried it both ways , and one of the attempts came out halfway decent . 
  still nothing satisfactory , though . 
  i think i 'll hold off on making injera for now .

  not feeling bad here . 
  in practice , i do n't think russia in any sense viewed the annexed or satellite states as `` family '' . 
  they treated us terribly . 
  then again , if you dot a dotted note , then it does n't become ( 3/2 ) ^ 2 = 9/4 times as long,

  i thought that was the irish !, 
  even so , each package is obviously more money than how much all the things in it are worth , tickets included .
