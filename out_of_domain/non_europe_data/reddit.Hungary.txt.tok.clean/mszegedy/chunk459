  cyriak just got a boner, 
  my favorite 's [ this drawing ] ( https://images.encyclopediadramatica.se/9/91/loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooongcat.jpg ) , available at encyclopedia dramatica . 
  ( i 'd put a `` big picture '' warning here , but actually it 's only half a mb ... such are the wonders of decade-old image compression . 
  for reference , that 's the size of the original super mario world rom , and a tenth of the size of the seagate [ st-506 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st-506 ) from 1980 , which cost $ 1500 at the time ), 
  you can find that on 4chan too though, 
  not sea stars , brittle stars !, 
  weird little creatures . 
  second highest on the echinoderm coolness scale , between [ sea cucumbers ] ( http://www.centralcoastbiodiversity.org/uploads/1/4/9/9/14993002/6981886_orig.jpg ) in 3rd place and [ basket stars ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/basket_star_feeding_at_night_at_the_red_sea.jpg ) in 1st place . 
  they are even less edible than sea stars , though , unfortunately . 
  0/10 can not pronounce latin, 
  just joking , your understanding of iam as a discourse particle reflects deep knowledge of latin, 
  edit : i mixed it up . 
  `` iam '' is decent as a word to mean `` now '' , but you know what this really needs ? 
  discourse particles !, 
  add a `` vero '' and you 're golden . 
  which one ? 
  `` an '' preceding `` iam '' being incorrect is because of the `` i '' being an approximant rather than a vowel , making the same sound as consonantal `` y '' in english . 
  ** i was wrong about use of `` iam '' as a discourse particle , i was thinking of `` nam '' . 
  ( although it did probably have such a usage . ), 
  i will explain anyway . 
  ** use of discourse particles , however , is usually not something you 'll hear about in even later latin education , because you tend to study poems , where you do n't hear words used that way as much . 
  in every language you get a set of words which are `` dust '' added to a sentence with no straightforward meaning . 
  for example , in english , beginning a sentence with `` now '' and a pause means roughly , `` what i am about to say is especially important and you should listen up , '' or `` what i am about to say is in a different direction than what i have said leading up to this point , '' but you would never actually replace it with that . 
  in latin , one can identify several such particles , such as `` enim '' and `` vero '' . 
  the former , which normally meant `` for '' ( in the sense of , `` for , is n't it * okay * for me to screw my wife 's sister ? 
  '' ) , as a particle meant that the speaker wanted the audience to agree with them , like english `` y' know ? 
  '' , `` is n't it ? 
  '' , and `` i mean , ... '' . 
  i particularly like `` i mean '' as an equivalent , because that also gets to be used as a `` for '' - like conjunction , in addition to being used as a particle inviting agreement . 
  they also sound similar . 
  `` vero '' , also said `` verum '' , on the other hand , while normally meaning `` but '' ( and derived from a meaning of `` in truth '' ) , indicates commitment to the statement on the part of the * speaker * , like a pause followed by a downward-tone `` really '' in english , or appending `` and you can take my word for it '' . 
  particles are a funny bunch of words , and useful at that . 
  source : `` a framework for the description of latin discourse markers '' , caroline croon, 
  yeah but you can get the game to automate that . 
  also , it kills your ability to multiplayer . 
  wait , what ? 
  the one where you die ? 
   cannibalism, 
  why has n't anyone heard about this ? 
  sadly they 're no good , they mostly fall under the `` poorly-written erotica '' section . 
   hitman sites, 
  how do you know they 're still active ? 
  anyone with half a brain knows that those would make for the easiest sting op ever, 
   human trafficking, 
  whole sites ? 
  i 'd figure traffickers would keep everything more underground than that , but i 'll take your word for it . 
  have we actually found any ? 
  ( other than anything the us government has said about it , since they lie blatantly about the internet very often . ), 
  half my family is from there , same, 
  eu4 provinces are usually named after loosely-defined regions or prominent cities . 
  they would n't have too much of a problem, 
  when austria gets it , in my experince it tends to be the other way around , that spain and austria tear france apart . 
  it added a 0 and made it 750 !, 
  maybe sollux , jane , and jake ? 
  you might have visited a non-english version of the steam store in the past . 
  i see it as portuguese , because i visited some portuguese site to secure h0t d34lz on a piece of dlc in the steam store , and at some point it sent me to portuguese steam . 
  now the entire site is always in portuguese for me . 
  i made this in minecraft once !, 
  looking forward to an actual game, 
  thank you but i prefer portuguese !, 
  i studied latin in high school and observing the sound changes from vulgate is interesting, 
  having used all the reddit apps in the android app store , alien blue is definitely the best reddit app out there . 
  it can display tables properly , it can keep a list of subreddits i like without actually being subscribed to them , there 's tons of gestures i can use , there 's fullscreen mode and yet an immediate orangered indicator ... it 's great . 
  the only edge any of the android apps have over alien blue is the card layout if you 're into that , and the ability to display strikethrough properly and superscript semi-properly . 
  communist brunei ? 
  for lofa county , to symbolize a river , you could have taken a cue from the nearby [ gambia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_gambia ), 
  i tried to represent hungary 's heritage here , whether it 's good or bad . 
  - the magyars : the crest in the middle , especially the 8-striped flag, 
  - the ottomans , and the hungarians as a turkic people : flag structure , being mostly red except for a circle in the middle , bearing similarity not only to the ottoman flag but also many other turkic flags, 
  - iran ( where the magyars passed through , and first learned about everything that being uralic nomads did n't involve ) : green , white , and red, 
  - the habsburgs and austria : the black and gold stripes at the bottom ; also , red and white, 
  - the soviet union/russia : a mostly red flag , and also similar in structure to many of russia 's federal subjects , e.g. 
  [ yakutia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_sakha_republic ), 
  i 'm not pleased with it , but honestly i do n't think i 'll be pleased with anything , given that i hate not including red , white , and green , hate using more than three colors , and hate not using the habsburg colors somewhere , resulting in a contradiction in preference . 
  this flag does n't include angevin rule , or our 1000 years of mingling with the slavs ( either of which would have required me to add yet another color , blue ) . 
  edit : [ perhaps a slightly better version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jecbnpr.png ), 
  one not on there is the [ sz\u00e9kely flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/flag_of_szekely_land.svg ) , possibly because it 's also used for a region ( but not an administrative division ) . 
  or star wars ep 4, 
  technically the edges are cut off , so it 's more like 80 % of the movie, 
  so who are the great powers nowadays ? 
  usa , russia , germany , china , india ? , who else ? 
  when there 's lots of units , op 's method is more efficient, 
   `` * ut incepit fidelis sic permanet * '' ( ` loyal she began , loyal she remains ' ), 
  more literally , `` how she started loyal is the way that she remains . '', 
  hence `` thus '' in your translation . 
  did n't they ever think at one point , `` maybe , i * should n't * put a horsecock on my heraldry ? '', 
  also , is the name of the vay family literally `` butter '' but with aristocratic spelling ? 
  or are they named after something else and it 's just a coincidence ? 
  strange , should be vajay then, 
  that 's true . 
  various russian federal subjects also have their flags there . 
  * bene . 
  good god i wish sbc had made it more clear that the movie had nothing to do with the actual kazakhstan , or made it a fake country . 
  it 's not that hard to do !, 
  * papers , please * had `` obristan '' . 
  and in * the dictator * he managed to have wadiya instead of eritrea . 
  well , most cultures have songs like that . 
  many dutch songs , for example , such as [ `` merck toch hoe sterck '' ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/merck_toch_hoe_sterck_%28lied%29 ) , revolve around kicking spanish ass . 
  you can date these songs by who the enemy is . 
  you could have at least changed the title ... then again , your name is / u/mrredditkarma,
