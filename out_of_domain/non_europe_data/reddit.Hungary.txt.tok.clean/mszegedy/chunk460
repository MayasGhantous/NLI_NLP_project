  actually it stands for `` rwanda '', 
  it 's important to note that culture and technology is * not * a scalar quantity , and does not `` progress '' towards or converge on some sort of ideal . 
  a more appropriate question would be , `` what caused muggle and wizard society to develop differently , culturally and technologically speaking ? '', 
  hackertyper has most of those features though . 
  admittedly this implementation is nice . 
  what do you think canada uses ? 
  francs ? 
  edit : thought the guy before you said `` us , '' sorry, 
  i like max 's principles , but i fear he may have alienated isaac . 
  a better solution would have been to tell him that that 's not how friendship works , but keep him around anyway , because he needs full-time friends , not just a single moralistic part-time one . 
  at this rate , in a few million years the amount of progress will have changed significantly !, 
  it 's like that shitty light sensor on smartphones -- technically a third camera , but only good for telling the light level . 
  relatedly , coming up with a more `` realistic '' and dynamic concept for a history simulator put a damper on my ability to enjoy my favorite map-painting simulator . 
  now there is not even something i can play , just a mountain of c++ to patiently chip away at in my limited free time, 
  both turkic loanwords . 
  there 's also a couple crazy tengriists around here nowadays , so i suppose `` tengri '' is also a word in hungarian . 
  do n't worry australia , go to hong kong , they are best anglo, 
  yeah , but that 's not the one in [ the picture ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/sculpture+park/@48.006671,17.160846,2a,90y,90t/data=!3m5!1e2!3m3!1s81239526!2e1!3e10!4m6!1m3!3m2!1s0x4741e76cbfdf46bb:0xb7f9917af5ce63cc!2smemento+park!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x12d5760153e51943!6m1!1e1 ), 
  it 's not . 
  it 's indo-european , but not indo-aryan . 
  and that has nothing to do with being aryan , either in the way that historians mean it or in the way that the nazis meant it . 
  what huge difference is there between flags and `` corporate logos '' ? 
  it even follows the rules of tincture . 
  it 's two colors , with a neat design between them that 's not too different from many designs found on other flags historically ( see for example the maori flag for something vaguely similar ) . 
  nope . 
  ia is a [ well-defined language family ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indo-aryan_languages ) with [ its own proto-language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vedic_sanskrit ) ( not vedic sanskrit itself , but its recent ancestor ) . 
  it does n't come anywhere close to describing the ie language family and no educated linguist would use it that way . 
  either you badly misunderstood something , or you 're one of those idiotic indian nationalists who claim everything is descended from sanskrit . 
  [ masica ] ( http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/the%20indo-aryan%20languages_masica.pdf ) already refers to them by the modern definition in 1991 , so the modern classification ca n't be very recent . 
  it is not generally accepted that the ie languages developed from proto-aryan . 
  it is generally accepted that they developed from [ pie . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proto-indo-european_language ) pia is by definition whatever the ia languages developed from . 
  they 're horrible , pls no keep, 
  yuo are worst meme, 
  oops . 
  did n't take it seriously cause april fool 's . 
  it 's alright, 
  it would be more realistic , considering burgundy was n't really a unified state so much as a mess of pus . 
  do the snes next !, 
  same amount of registers . 
  this is because aq qoyonlu was the home of the white sheep turkomans , while qara qoyonlu was the home of the black sheep turkomans . 
  [ op posted a higher res ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/3173fb/harry_potter_promo_shots/cpz6wa5 ), 
  true, 
  immediately knew there was something wrong when central borneo was n't a wasteland and aceh blobbed . 
  the question is , though , how did you tell it apart from the extended timeline map and the player using the ` own ` command to make borders look nicer ? 
  the fourth wall is the front one ; the back one is the second, 
  exactly, 
   is it possible that earth is receiving signals from outer space which could be that of some extra terrestrial life source ? 
  a new research paper has not ruled out this possibility . 
  * that * is * exactly * how you do sensationalism . 
  take notes everybody . 
  sometimes you do n't want to read it more critically , though . 
  `` let 's just fuck tincture shall we ? '', 
  how did you get it to type the unicode symbols ? 
  i 've made my own custom keyboard , but in order to get it to type non-qwerty symbols , i had to make it type out compose key combos for them , and had to insert all my own compose key combinations for ipa symbols . 
  ( fun fact : the schwa is already on there as e + e. ), 
  this is an inelegant hack that decreases the amount of space i have for actual compose key combos . 
  you 're biologically incapable of that . 
  having a non-24-hour sleep pattern is considered a [ disorder ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-24-hour_sleep\u2013wake_disorder ) . 
  without exposure to light , humans ' sleep cycles extend slightly to some 26 or so hours , but 30 would definitely be a stretch even if the sun were n't involved . 
  what do you mean ? 
  you 'd have a 30-hour day/night cycle but still a 24-hour ( or 26-hour ) sleep cycle ? 
  ( it 's sort of a moot point , since by the time we can move to such planets our bioengineering capabilities will probably allow us to control the circadian clock , but still . ), 
   kievlithuania, 
  but how do you code it ? 
  i use the ` evdev ` package in python , and as far as i 'm aware all that can do is send keypresses . 
  once the computer knows what you 've hit , how does it type it out ? 
  i forgot about those !, 
  thank you !, 
  glad i could help :p, 
  historically accurate-ish habsburgs , except for the fact that they should n't have the british isles, 
  [ just for you ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k0vxbvp.png ), 
  it should say `` there is no god '', 
  i got similar costs just playing as sulu , westernizing , and always being ridiculously behind on tech compared to my neighbors . 
  hell , once they went down to the double digits . 
  no , instead i look at them with dread thinking , `` if i did n't abandon every game after a few years , this would happen -- how boring '' . 
  i know i 'm not * terrible * at the game , since i managed to conquer most of the southern hemisphere as sulu . 
  i have yet to unlock the secret of early blobbing , though . 
  i know the lettering looks clumsy , but inkscape exported the letters to png at different positions than i had them in the svg . 
  how terrible !, 
  this is a mashup of the following two files :, 
  - [ current czech presidential standard ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/flag_of_the_president_of_the_czech_republic.svg ) , although it would n't have made a difference if i 'd used an older one from czechoslovakia or the interwar czech/slovak states . 
  - [ the coat of arms of the philippines ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/coat_of_arms_of_the_philippines.svg ) . 
  weird how they have the symbols of the colonizers . 
  i wanted to use a national motto instead of just `` republika ng pilipinas '' , and there were three main choices :, 
  - `` ang katotohanan ay makapanaig '' , a translation of the badass czech motto , `` truth will prevail '', 
  - `` maka-diyos , maka-tao , makakalikasan at makabansa '' , the current motto of the philippines, 
  - `` isang bansa , isang diwa '' , the slightly older motto of the philippines, 
  i went with the last one , because it 's the shortest . 
  historically this was the case with northeast south america . 
  there 's venezuela ( spanish guyana ) , guyana ( british guyana ) , suriname ( dutch guyana ) , french guyana , and amap\u00e1 ( brazilian guyana ) . 
  also , the entire scramble for africa . 
  do i look like i know what a png is ? 
  what the fuck guys . 
  when ottawa changed its flag , you all complained that it looked like a corporate logo , despite it following pretty much all rules of good vexillological design ( it even had three colors and good tincture ) . 
  and then with this flag , which i swear to god has appeared on some of my bottled water before , you all are just like `` nice '' ? 
  this is some fucking bullshit . 
  is the actual design based on anything though ? 
  where in europe ? 
  i 'm thinking of doing a series of these .
