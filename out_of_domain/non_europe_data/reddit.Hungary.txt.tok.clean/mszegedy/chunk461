  czech/moroccan ? 
   and it were part of a quinquaginary system, 
  ftfy, 
  also if it only had 12 member states or it did n't care to represent the federal government on its flag . 
  fuck that , check out that flappy double triangle at the bottom right, 
  they manufacture chocolate, 
   back in the day, 
  reddit has tons of extremely racist subs , this is still a thing . 
  exactly . 
  '' / r/thebutton ... so , the new april fool 's thing revolves around this button ? 
  what does it do ? 
  better find out . 
  whoah , what , there 's two layers of pressing ? 
  well , anyway , i pressed it . 
  what now ? 
  oh , i see , there 's a countdown . 
  good luck reaching the bottom of that , guys . '', 
  and then mfw i see the posts in this sub ... 
  i actually really like the netherlands ', 
  matching colours ? 
  where ? 
  making it look like beer would have breaken the rules of tincture, 
  you were n't there for ottawa . 
  they literally complained that it was `` evil '' . 
  not quite . 
  the magyars migrated from the ural mountains . 
  the original pannonians whom the hungarians are descended from , an unnamed turkic people , however , originated in central asia like the mongols . 
  nowadays we 're mostly slavic though . 
  cuttlefish , yes . 
  but what 's on her leg looks like a jellyfish , which have pretty much the simplest nervous systems in existence . 
  ( at first i thought it was a nautilus , which are one of the dumbest cephalopods , but it 's not . ), 
  well , what else do people know about nepal , besides the fact that they 've got sherpas who will help you climb the tallest mountain on earth ? 
  and it fits their flag , too . 
  clearly you 've never seen [ this ] ( http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpffcq9ass1r0i8wko1_500.jpg ) much-reposted image of finns waiting at a bus stop . 
  ( and then someone asks , `` how do they reproduce ? '', 
  and then someone answers , `` spores . / pollen . '' ), 
  no , the avars ruled over these guys . 
  we know tons about the avars , like how they were originally a segment of the g\u00f6kt\u00fcrk khanate . 
  have you been ? 
  damn , now that you mention it , there 's flags with weed on them ... 
  i did n't do that for two reasons :, 
  - i do n't like using devices that do n't already exist somewhere, 
  - weed is more of an amsterdam stereotype than a dutch stereotype, 
  but it seems weed as a device is already a thing . 
  which only leaves the second point . 
  what 's x ? 
  does n't look like south africa or luxembourg . 
  is it some district of china ? 
  [ yes , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afroasiatic_languages ) [ it is !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/egyptian_language#history ), 
  [ one of the top submissions of all time ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/19g88y/ocwhat_if_the_flags_of_all_countries_were_based/ ) actually has a windmill for the netherlands , as well as a polder-looking thing . 
  i added it to the album . 
  i just wrote `` moon landing '', 
  thanks , np !, 
  wikipedia has it usually, 
  the symbolism of all the others is wrecked too , you think i 'd make an exception ? 
  what can i say , the existing us flag was conducive to this particular stereotype . 
  the reason why i was hesitant to make a stereotype flag for it was that it was difficult to do any of the standard stereotypes without editing the flag too much or being super unclear ( like i was in russia 's ) , but then i realized that i was only thinking of negative stereotypes ( fat , hamburgers , dumb , nationalist ) , while the ones i already did are fairly neutral . 
  also trying to depict nationalism is probably not a good idea , since it 's an ultra widespread stereotype . 
  hah , but the style 's really well-done , is n't it ? 
  that 's only from the perspective of machines that work with dna ( polymerases etc ) . 
  there 's loads of other information in even a single sperm cell -- what proteins are present , for example , and in what state . 
  when you get down to it , the complete physical configuration of your ballsack is enormously complex to describe and is far more than 8 pb . 
  using the [ bekenstein bound ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bekenstein_bound ) we can get an approximate estimate on the upper bound of the amount of information stored in your ballsack , whose number of bits is 2.577 \u00d7 10 ^ ( 43 ) times its mass in kilos times the radius of its bounding sphere in meters . 
  the average white guy 's testicle is about 18 cc , so the volume of the whole scrotum is about 36 cc , meaning that the radius of the bounding sphere is about cbrt ( 36 / ( \u03c0 \\* 4/3 ) ) = ~ 2 cm ( making our model scrotum about the size of a golf ball ) . 
  it probably has roughly the density of water , and so weighs about 36 grams . 
  this shitty approximation altogether gives us 2.577 \u00d7 10 ^ ( 43 ) \u00d7 0.036 \u00d7 0.02 = ~ 2 \u00d7 10 ^ ( 40 ) bits , or about 2.5 \u00d7 10 ^ ( 39 ) bytes , or about 2500 quintillion exabytes ( an exabyte is a quintillion bytes ) . 
  edit : keep in mind that this is the upper bound of the information you can * store * in your ballsack . 
  the information to describe it , however , given the right encoding scheme , can be a lot less . 
  it 's still a huge amount , however , since there 's so many molecular details . 
  thank you for existing so much . 
  most games on here , i have no idea what they are . 
  have you got it for common as well ? 
  it 's great !, 
  it looks middle eastern by accident !, 
  it 's actually a really nice flag though . 
  do you make parts of your flags look like existing slavic flags on purpose ? 
  this one looks like ukraine , the italian one looks like bulgaria , and i believe the french one looked like russia . 
  thank you , i will crosspost . 
  that was the original intention , but i forgot that by the time i wrote the question . 
  i wanted to say a partially-recognized state just to be an ass , but they actually all have great flags, 
  do n't you dare badmouth your flag . 
  it 's one of my favorites :(, 
  edit : no wait i confused you with newfoundland . 
  hate it all you want it 's a terrible flag, 
  yay , thanks !, 
  it 's mostly nonsense , but '' - j\u00e4nk\u00e4 '' means `` bog '' ( and stupidly has no cognates in hungarian ), 
  `` bot '' is probably hungarian , meaning `` stick '' . 
  dunnoabout `` slavic '' though . 
  he said he does n't want high school math , but wow , this is such a great one , it probably does n't even matter . 
  edit : jesus guys i get it , it 's apparently not high school math . 
  relatedly , humans are roughly of genus 1 . 
  the digestive tract is a very important `` hole '' in the body . 
  dunno , iirc every year my high school math had a unit on it , with algebraic series and such . 
  my education was not the usual , though ( half of it took place in the us , half of it in hungary ) . 
  tbf it * is * an obvious comment to make if you know the meme . 
  i was about to post the same thing . 
  shame , shame !, 
  try this much more legible version instead :, 
   finland m\u00e4n is laik tis .
