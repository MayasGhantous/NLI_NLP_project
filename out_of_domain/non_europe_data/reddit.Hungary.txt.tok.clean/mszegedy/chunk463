  not tell anybody , because is shame . 
  check emails . 
  then die . 
  this was finland man . 
  well , strictly speaking , we 've got a very large genus , and we are n't even made up of a single surface . 
  but the first thing that happens in the development of every animal is the formation of that tube . 
  we 're toroids , i tell you !, 
  exactly !, 
  and here we see the [ stage iii ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/tvtropeswillruinyourlife ) of [ tvtropes addiction . 
  ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/tvtropesasagatewaydrug ) at this point , the [ memetic ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/fountainofmemes ) [ language ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/justforfun/tvtropeswillruinyourvocabulary ) has thoroughly pervaded the psyche , and the victim can not think in terms of anything but tvtropes pages . 
  characteristic symptoms are obsessive [ insertion of links ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/pothole ) to tvtropes pages , gratuitous use of [ bullet point lists , ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/administrivia/exampleindentationintropelists ) and inability to [ discuss ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/conversationaltroping ) subjects not pertaining to tvtropes . 
  [ further progression ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/darthwiki/tvtropesruinedyourlife ) of the disease will lead to complete breakdown of non-tvtropes-related cognitive abilities , and the victim will die of inability to nourish themselves . 
  not enough snakes 6/10, 
  wtf did you do to this game ? 
  this does n't just happen naturally, 
  but no gameblay mods ? 
  besides the possibility that he wrote it as a memo , it could also be that he has an earlier copy lying around , and he 'll later have dave retrieve the edited version of that from the future . 
  \u0ca0_\u0ca0 necroposting to misunderstand a hyperbolic joke ? 
  pls, 
  in hungarian , this rapper could be `` gender-gender '' , or `` not-gender '' , or a pun on `` eminem '' implying that this guy is not eminem . 
  also , `` nemiszerv '' is `` genitals '' ( `` gender-organ '' ) , so our hypothetical rapper 's name would have connotations of `` penis '' . 
  the latin version almost works , but his name would be pronounced `` neminay '' , kind of ruining the pun . 
  or seeing something similar on tv . 
  as a kid , cartoons were how i learned to dry my back using a towel, 
  what language do you speak , out of curiosity ? 
  it seems to be a custom nation ; that color does n't appear anywhere else on the map . 
   and of course , only a certain amount of units can actually fight in a battle . 
  when it 's 100k troops v 50k , and the combat-width is 20 , 60k of your troops ( assuming you have a 50/50 cannon vs non-cannon ratio ) will be sitting twiddling their thumbs and taking morale damage while the 40k get slaughtered . 
  this wo n't happen if you use trickle tactics properly . 
  keep the reserve troops waiting in adjacent provinces ; do n't just stuff them all in one place . 
  this is pretty much always possible unless you 're cornered . 
  s ` all good man, 
  it 's easier said than done , though . 
  without complete understanding of the battle cycle , you run the risk of leaving too early , or accidentally winning the battle . 
  vowels followed by m at the end of words and before fricatives ( s and f ) turn into their respective long versions , nasalized . 
  the m does n't get pronounced as a separate phoneme . 
  this is part of the reason why nearly every romance language lost case inflection : first the long u and a lost their nazalization , and then they merged with long o and short a / `` long '' ae respectively . 
  there 's also / r/shittypopanalysis if you 're interested, 
  should 've conquered easterer, 
  [ france ] ( #green - text ), 
  [ small ] ( #green - text ), 
  english `` ay '' is [ e\u026a ] , while long e in latin is [ e  . 
  make of it what you will, 
  that 's why you should actually write everything in metafont . 
  then you can unambiguously specify what you want to be shown . 
  cool !, 
  [ we call them the same in hungarian . 
  you 're the big blue blob !, 
  * and * you own corsica !, 
  my favorite is the analysis of `` timber '' because it actually sounds plausible until you step back and look at the song . 
  too bad the sub 's dead nowadays . 
  `` u wot m8 '' and `` uwotm8 '' are idioms of their own , though . 
  they 're difficult to understand without knowing the meaning of the complete idiom . 
  reddit is usually so negative , it 's nice to see you on top for a change, 
  ah yes forgot to mention the graphics card 's model . 
  yeah , it 's got to be something like that if your oses consistently fail . 
   also the driver you need is probably not the latest driver but the recently legacy one . 
  i saw a tutorial that had one use ` nvidia-331 ` or something . 
  what do you use ? 
   also using nvidia driver will require setting up xorg file . 
  thank you , but well duh . 
  did you read what i wrote ? 
  have you tried dual-booting windows to see if that works ? 
  surely , though , this is / r/archlinux and not the world jewish congress ? 
  absolutely haram, 
  i 've recently been trying to make a program that will recognize hand gestures via a webcam and convert them to keystrokes ( mainly for my arthritic mother ) . 
  it relies on a glove i colored in with sharpies . 
  ( btw , is `` geppetto '' a good name or dumb name for it ? ), 
  this is because everybody does their hacking in the server room . 
  computering in the dark causes eye strain , but it 's not terrible . 
  on the other hand , i still loathe doing it . 
   just, 
  look into a `` keyboard mapping '' software for your os . 
  on windows there 's sharpkeys, 
  is this counting that mass of water in the mantle under east asia ? 
  `` ac '' is also `` and '' in latin . 
  ( it 's a shorter version of `` atque '' , which is put together from `` at '' , meaning `` but '' , and '' - que '' , which also means `` and '' , and is more emphatic than either `` et '' or '' - que '' ), 
  `` swiss '' is easier to say , and pretty close to `` schweiz '' . 
  hungary has less basetax than france . 
  maybe you 're happy with them because they gave you an excuse to take your clay ? 
  you frequently do n't know who gave you gold , in which case this is the only way to thank them . 
  wait , how did you vassalize everyone and still have bird points ? 
   it is uneccesary, 
  but it is n't . 
  if someone gives you a thing , you thank them . 
  it only detracts from the post because you perceive it that way . 
  but some of these are clearly not hre princes , such as hejaz . 
  edit : nvm , there 's only a small number of non-hre ones . 
  bohemian anatolia is really funny though . 
  wait , so there 's actually only a limited number of non-hre vassals in this picture ? 
  i count :, 
  - iraq, 
  - funj, 
  - bulgaria ? 
  hm , i guess that 's not that bad . 
  they 're siphonophores , not jellyfish . 
  ( although there is a siphonophore with that name . ), 
  spalish, 
  everybody 's saying it 's of the wrong degree , but this is a guy 's head we 're talking about after all . 
  r = m\u03d1 + b would be fine i think,
