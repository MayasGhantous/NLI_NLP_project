  i will generally be happy if there 's an english analogue , even if it 's obscure , and will be sure to mention it as an example . 
  now i want to see a modern-day newt suit, 
  add it to [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/2gimav/idea_for_a_conlang_words_inflect_but_its_all/ ), 
  wow , way better visibility than when i went there . 
  did you freeze to death ? 
  the ideas * are . 
  * which is why they are considered memes . 
  language is a meme . 
  [ shenryr did it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lydkjclc2pm&amp;list=plllkimddgsne3oepwwnduubc00xzg8jp9 ) as part of an introductory tutorial on victoria 2, 
   launch !, 
  yeah , right . 
  did they have any contact with the uralic peoples . 
  and , if so , did one learn skiing from the other ? 
  what about the spray can ? 
  it 's been used before , but looks kinda terrible . 
  ( i 'm sure that , in the infinite space of art , there 's a way to use them that makes aesthetically pleasing art , but i have n't found it yet . ), 
  am a `` german '' tourist , can confirm . 
  if you are n't fully-booked , no , * double * - booked , on your vacation , you obviously are n't having fun . 
  the problem with clinton 's logo is that it does n't follow the rules of tincture . 
  blue and red without a light color between them ? 
  nope . 
  that 's why your redesign works so well . 
  but why bother changing the color of the arrow ? 
  maybe make it brighter , but blue ? 
  now hussie is just deliberately trying to make us sad with how much awesome stuff is * not * going to get shown onscreen in an aesthetically pleasing format . 
  sponges ride rocks ... there 's a whole host of genuine nonsense in there , but pls do n't misunderstand the oceanography jokes :(, 
  i 'm still waiting for someone to use `` half maximum '' as an average . 
  the only use i know of is [ fwhm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/full_width_at_half_maximum ) . 
  this does n't work when nobody would even think to write such a paper in the languages you know , though . 
  i 'm fluent in hungarian and decent at tagalog . 
  one is spoken by apparently the least english-speaking country in europe besides turkey ( and presumably you want to write a literature essay ) , and the other is really difficult to find on the internet . 
  plus , the literary traditions of both languages are vastly different from those of the us , and an essay structured in , say , a hungarian fashion will be very grating for any american literature professor . 
  if it 's a bacteriophage , it 's mandatory that you name it sb129-sigma or something, 
  \\  american measurements, 
  \\  using points for both thousands separators and decimal separators, 
  \\  `` milong '', 
  what kind of third-world shit is this ? 
  * three, 
  eheheheh . 
  you 're not gon na win against the italians by trying to marry them , austria . 
  ( but seriously , the kuk armee was legendarily bad . 
  they lost against italy , and apparently once fought themselves when invading the ottomans . ), 
  adblock plus is corrupt and sometimes ineffective, 
  also predecessor of the much-more-badass-ly-named [ mountainous republic of the northern caucasus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mountainous_republic_of_the_northern_caucasus ) , aka the mountain republic . 
  nowadays minecraft is mostly vegetarian anyways, 
  edit : or at least halal, 
  [ ] ( / obvious ), 
  incoming : 3 million remove kebab jokes, 
  gold white gold probably, 
  no , union as in pauline newman or eugene v debs . 
  the other kind of union ( or even the soviet union ) might work too though , depending on the poster . 
  this is stupid . 
  not wanting to look at ads on reddit does n't make you a bad person , and in fact is n't even necessarily immoral , since ads are n't the only way reddit gets revenue . 
  and even if you never click on ads and never buy or get gold , you * still * should n't feel obligated to somehow contribute to reddit 's existence unless you think both of the following are true :, 
  - reddit in particular is a good thing that should stay around for everyone, 
  - you 're similar enough to the average person who wants reddit to continue existing that they 'd make the same decisions for the same reasons, 
  if you 're not very attached to reddit in particular and think any other social networking site would do the job as well , or if you 're just passing through and do n't intend to use it regularly , then you have no reason to support it . 
  you should really channel your negativity into shaming people for not contributing to causes that * everyone * can get behind , like alleviation of economic inequality or conservation of the environment . 
  nope . 
  only conlangers . 
  holy shit . 
  700 + pages . 
  way to go !, 
  i figured out that i could get large amounts of light by trying to catch the light from the wildshield ( which was usuall other cars ' brake lights , or headlights of cars in the opposite lane ) . 
  cue getting told to stay out of the way of the rear-view-mirror . 
  but this situation is completely symmetrical . 
  tia thinks they know better than us , thinks we 're a bad sub , and thinks we 're stupid/bad people . 
  we think we know better than tia , think they 're a bad sub , and think they 're stupid/bad people . 
  there 's an obvious disconnect/misunderstanding here . 
  ( formatting the submission title exactly like an srs post probably did n't help . ), 
  however , we , being linguists or at least experienced in linguistics , can at least be confident that we know about linguistics-related issues . 
  i 'm not sure if tia has any particular expertise . 
  and i at least ca n't help being mad at people who say stupid things like the linked post . 
  not only . 
  the imgur community does create oc and share things for the sake of the imgur community seeing it . 
  the oc can be complete cancer though . 
  in various agglutinative languages ( such as hungarian ^ cough ^ cough ^ cough ) it is possible to make arbitrarily long words , by combining affixes until you arrive at the same part of speech you started with . 
  in this case , usually people brag about the longest attested word , or the longest word you can make without repeating an affix . 
  the longest known continuous protein chain , and the most complex known molecule . 
  ( if there were a more complex one , it would have a longer name . ), 
  whatever it is , that 's not their flag . 
  ah , i was just looking for any thread about this gif the other day . 
  i want to find out what game this is and play it . 
  ( apparently it 's * trackmania 2 * . ), 
  wow , perfect !, 
  too bad it 's no longer spoken this way . 
  funnily enough in hungarian , since our language is cobbled together from like ten other ones , our word for 10 is `` t\u00edz '' , and our word for 1000 is `` ezer '' . 
  both of these come from old persian , which is indo-european like english . 
  ( `` t\u00edz '' resembles spanish `` dies '' more than persian `` dah '' or whatever though . ), 
  the finnish one would be basically the same in ipa, 
  it 's already been used , to make the sbahjifier, 
  meh , if we act smartly we can delay it for several billion years , which sounds like enough time for anything . 
  look up `` ribozymes '' . 
  you can unite over your love of very flat pastries, 
  this is the most realistic answer . 
  they should have asked / r/biology , not / r/chemistry !, 
  however , i believe methane explodes , not burns . 
  meh , i wish the taliban the best of luck in particular . 
  they 're a lot less bad . 
  i do n't really understand the joke .
