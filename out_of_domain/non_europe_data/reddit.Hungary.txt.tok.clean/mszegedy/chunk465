  it seems to have to do with the mh370 and mh17 disasters , but how ? 
  right , but how does that make a joke ? 
   provided you 're good at fighting bad odds wars, 
  how to git gud ? 
  are you giving the ai anonymity to spare its good name ? 
  you dropped this : _, 
  actually you dropped another _ the first time ( and this time ) . 
  that 's not fixable without backslashes . 
  it looks like [ `` thick borders and recolored water '' ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=297339191 ), 
   venetian, 
  italy is a scary , scary place, 
  also 99 % accurate v2 hungary, 
  what about in the philippines ? 
  i mean , it 's poor , but afaik it 's tolerant ( despite the catholicism ) . 
  i just did this in victoria 2 , so i 'm sure it 's possible . 
  spain would have to get rid of it early , to give it time to acquire momentum . 
  possibly if they take cues from china and become communist in the early 20th century , then they can build up raw industrial capacity to become economically powerful , as well as quash religious movements like milf . 
   however applying those methods in real history would not work well as it did in your game . 
  hah , that 's not what i did in the game . 
  in the game i just conquered all of southeast asia and most of africa . 
   there is no good reason for spain to get rid of it during the nineteenth century . 
  i 'm sure it 's possible to invent one . 
  losing a war , getting a weird ruler ... it can happen . 
   [ communism would not seem attractive ], 
  \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af it was just an offhand suggestion . 
  you know better than i do . 
  but keep in mind that there have been several very religious communist states , such as [ angola . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people%27s_republic_of_angola ), 
   ps : those groups are not only religious movements but also separatist groups . 
  separatist primarily for religious reasons . 
  not since you were genocided as well !, 
   ever, 
  found the american !, 
  my god , even with gifv the first one 's a slideshow, 
  eh , what about jewish ? 
  i swear i 've seen this exact comment on this sub before . 
  just in vic 2, 
  but only to goats, 
  the jewish are like rare earth metals . 
  many in number but very evenly distributed . 
  when it 's written , how do you tell apart n and \u043f , u and \u0438 ? 
  edit : and m vs \u0442 ? 
  or else you become grease ? 
  you mean they would die instantly, 
  one reason not to get aow : kebab would just sortie the garrison on you here , afaik, 
  good question . 
  can anybody attest ? 
  i 've done that too . 
  simple explanation : the words have different connotations . 
  holy shit ? 
  civ 5 and upwards radically changed how units stack ( or rather , do n't ) in order to avoid the deathstacks of previous games . 
  units now take damage attacking a city . 
  however , if a unit is strong enough to take a city , it 'll take the city and survive with at least 1 hp regardless . 
  arguably a zero-stack is n't powerful enough though . 
  * molecular driving forces * is a good intro . 
  skip to the relevant parts . 
  obliviousness ? 
  this can be a polandball comic, 
  this can be a polandball comic, 
  it was intended to sound that way but it 's become a lot more standardized since then , as people picked up tics and writing techniques from each other . 
  now it 's more of an inventory of modal particles and things ( such as adding `` though '' at the end or changing capitalization halfway through a sentence ) . 
  hell , i 'm sure it would be easy to write up a descriptive grammar guide to it . 
  that sounds very reactionary though . 
  this argument gets made over and over again for a variety of fields , and the actual outcome is almost always decent . 
  the key thing to realize here is that there 's lots of ways to make money , and lots of better ways to make money than paid mods . 
  people who do go and make mods must care at least a little . 
  i 'm still against it , though , for three reasons :, 
  - a 75 % cut is completely ridiculous . 
  what service is valve providing that 's worth 75 % of the profit ? 
  it might give me a better margin to sell it by myself on another website . 
  - i am selfish , and do n't want to pay for anything . 
  - the market is currently vastly overpriced . 
  mods only worth a couple of cents get sold for $ 1 or more . 
  maybe i should make a decent mod and then sell it for 5 cents . 
  might start a trend . 
  also piracy, 
  you just invented comment sections segregated by topic . 
  yes , reddit needs these . 
  you could emulate it if it were possible to submit a post to more than one subreddit . 
  then you could submit it both to / r/jokesaboutrussia and / r/infoaboutrussia , and have the separate discussions there . 
  really , this is already possible , but clumsy and ineffective ( what if it gets submitted to one of the subreddits with a different link ? 
  then you ca n't see it under `` other discussions '' !, 
  ) , and very few people use the `` other discussions '' tab . 
  although i suppose that last bit is more a feature than a bug . 
  you 'd want the people who care about humor to stay in / r/funny and the people who care about information about russia to stay in / r/russia or wherever . 
  yes the soft edges are giving my eyes cancer, 
  braid , bastion , portals 1/2 , antichamber , journey, 
  also not necessarily a masterpiece but a lot of shorter games are art games , like eversion, 
  what a shame that `` really '' does n't mean `` actually '' anymore but `` very '', 
  it still does in some degree . 
  `` on this very soil '' and so forth, 
  but they ca n't touch each other at all without jake accidentally prototyping himseltf . 
  how tragic, 
  they 're far from meaningless , and certainly do n't represent completely different sounds . 
  that 's the whole point of ipa . 
  it 's phonetic and universal . 
  the only inaccuracy is that of transcription . 
  we write / d / to represent sounds * close to * `` ideal '' / d / , and / \u00f0 / to represent sounds * close to * `` ideal '' / \u00f0 / . 
  there 's also diacritics one can use for increasing accuracy , but the broader description we get by just writing / d / or / \u00f0 / is usually good enough . 
  but ... brackets indicate that it 's an even more precise transcription , i.e.
