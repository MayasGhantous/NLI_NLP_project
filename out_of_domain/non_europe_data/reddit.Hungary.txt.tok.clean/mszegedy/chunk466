  most uralic peoples live in russia, 
  fuck , this gets posted * every * time , and it * always * makes top comment . 
  what , we 're not supposed to give money to homeless people with funny signs now ? 
  mod is dead . 
  i meant with each traditionally distinct uralic people counting equally . 
  the finns , hungarians , and estonians get their own states ( although the hungarians are ethnically turkic ; the actual magyars mostly died out long ago ) , and the sami get to live mostly in scandinavia , but the bulk of uralic diversity is subsumed in russia . 
  you 'd think the magyars would at least make some genetic impact on the locals , but the [ y haplogroup data ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarians#ethnic_affiliations_and_genetic_origins ) suggests that hungarians are descended from the local turkic people who took up the mantle of magyar identity , and then interbred with the slavs for several hundred years . 
  just enjoy it . 
  all the ideas in it are really fun, 
  shakespeare sure lived long did n't he, 
  would n't have looked nearly as good, 
  is it somewhat lateralized ? 
  edit : no , apparently it 's an ejective ? 
  chill we 're just making fun of typos, 
  i thought that was diminished fifth ? 
  cool !, 
  where 'd you get that map , and are there any variants with larger coverage ? 
  i imagine we have n't quite genetically sampled every country on earth , but if we 've got data for [ this thing ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/world_map_of_y-dna_haplogroups.png ) , surely we have data for that . 
  but the train , thalis , * does * go through belgium . 
  i 've ridden it . 
  what about the guyanas in south america ? 
  - spanish guyana ( part of venezuela ), 
  - ( british ) guyana, 
  - dutch guyana ( suriname ), 
  - french guyana, 
  - brazilian/portuguese guyana ( the state of amap\u00e1 ), 
  while it 's true that ipa representations between slashes are pre-allophony , individual phonemes between slashes are just phonemes . 
  we usually use those to say that said phoneme exists in a language , or in a word ( pre-allophony ) . 
  that phoneme may have allophones , but it 's ridiculous to say that it 's `` meaningless '' without context . 
  in this case , what we were saying is that < \u00f0  produces the sound / \u00f0 / in icelandic . 
  now , it * could * have allophones , but none were mentioned , so until they 're discussed , we just assume there are none . 
  in danish , it so happens that < d  in syllable codas produces / \u00f0\u031e\u02c0 / . 
  this might have allophones -- e.g. , the glottal stop can disappear -- but they 're necessarily rarer , and that 's not a `` completely different '' sound from / \u00f0\u031e\u02c0 / . 
  and if you do n't want to make things too complicated for the person you 're talking do , you do n't tell them that the allophones even exist . 
  if you do , then you use brackets when you tell them the allophone . 
  but if slashed phonemes were misleading , we would n't use them . 
  ( on the other hand , whole words between slashes can be pretty different from their actual post-allophony forms . 
  but that 's just because there 's more phonemes . 
  and we were just talking about single phonemes . ), 
  you should watch more sci fi !, 
  there 's some really good ones out there ; recently out of popular titles i liked * looper * , for example . 
  it does n't have a twist per se , but the plot 's unusual enough to keep you guessing . 
  the problem is if you watch enough , though , you 'll end up totally expecting certain things . 
  the `` 5d time aliens '' were really obviously humans to anyone who 's watched their share of time travel movies ( and movies that use relativity as an excuse to violate causality ) . 
  i still really liked * interstellar * though . 
  it was beautiful . 
  now we just need him to do an adaptation of * the picture of dorian gray * , and cameo as a magic painting in a * harry potter * movie . 
  wow , a blog post , really ? 
  what trash . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/14/10/philippines-celebrates-historic-pacquiao-victory ) the referenced article . 
  it has almost exactly the same time travel model as bttf . 
  what 's wrong with it ? 
  ( also , check out http://qntm.org/looper ), 
  that would be too exploitable , especially to the ai . 
  remember how far over its forcelimits france keeps its armies ? 
  imagine them doing that with colonization . 
  move capital to a province of that culture , destabilize country , click button . 
  this is a great analysis !, 
  but i was talking about the ai being too * good * at it . 
  the ai tends to throw lots of money at problems like this that then screw the player over ; the example of this that i used was that france overspends on its army to raise it to twice the forcelimit , making them really hard to defeat for the player . 
  if it could do this with colonies , then that would be a whole lot worse , because colonies are first-come-first-served unless you want to go to war . 
  a self-fulfilling prophecy, 
  you 're doing it right . 
  you deserve it . 
  it 's best understood as a modal particle, 
  why not just dilute the intensity of the exclamation point , and have multiple exclamation points signal increasing intensity ? 
  pretty sure this is what happened naturally, 
  this specific flash might be a parody , of the revelation sequences in the saw movies , which use the same music . 
  this * is * the correct use of the word hack , though , in the modern sense . 
  `` gain unauthorized electronic access to '' is how people use it . 
  i did n't actually know that `` illicit '' meant `` illegal '' . 
  i thought it meant something like `` secret '' . 
  i changed it to `` unauthorized '' . 
  it should definitely be divided into muscovite and novgorodian if the rest of these are divided so . 
  there was a linguistic divide too , for example , although only a dialectual one . 
   i agree !!, 
  ftfy, 
  huh . 
  what did sg1 apophis do to merit an apocalyptic asteroid being named after him ? 
  the big snake after all is an appropriate reference . 
  arguably also redditors that browse / r/all, 
  chill , [ w ] is a semivowel, 
  this sounds like my mother when she got mad at me when i was little . \\* i am eagerly awaiting parenthood , when i 'll see whether she just was unusually angry , or little kids really are that annoying . 
  \\* ( e.g. , once i did n't know how to americanize names , so i told the school that my middle name , stef\u00e1n , was stephanie . 
  this was especially insulting to my mother , whose maiden name it was , so she yelled at me a whole lot and made me write out my full name in cursive 100 times . ), 
   western culture, 
  american culture , you mean . 
  a large part of europe takes a more conservative view of it , and the scandinavian and german interpretations are different altogether . 
  i used to understand this quote . 
  i used to have a problem , think of solving it with regex , and then fail to immediately think of the appropriate regex . 
  but nowadays regex comes naturally to me . 
  is it because i 'm doing simpler regex ? 
  or is it because i 've evolved ?
