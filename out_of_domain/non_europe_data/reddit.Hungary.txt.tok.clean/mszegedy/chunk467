  also , it says vd instead of std or sti, 
  harry potter does n't do much with the fact that it takes place side-by-side with the contemporary non-magical world , until perhaps the 7th book . 
  the main effects of the two worlds coexisting we see are inventions from the past couple centuries given a magical nature -- magic tents , spyglasses , lighters , cameras , etc. , and one or two bewitched flying vehicles . 
  the magical society views the non-magical one with somewhere between mild anthropological interest and complete disdain , so you rarely see any truly interesting modern inventions in a magical context , except perhaps administrative ideas like representative democracy ( ? ), 
  or modern education . 
  that said , worldbuilding is one of the major strong points of the hp series , perhaps the greatest , so i do recommend it if you like magical worldbuilding . 
  thankfully i do n't know what product it is, 
  bats are interesting !, 
  they 're like mice but they have wings and are at least as unclean . 
  they piss and shit onto/into whatever they eat and drink , and there 's like a jillion diseases you can get from them . 
  pretty standard fare for both bats and mice . 
  cool but irrelevant . 
  if you leave your water and food supply unprotected , bats will contaminate it . 
  this has caused all sorts of disease outbreaks , some of which are used as case studies for epidemiology courses . 
  obviously you did n't get fluent enough in it . 
  i do n't see what that has to do with anything . 
  the point is that bats are a disease vector for a lot of things , and the method of transmission is that they piss and shit on things you put in your mouth . 
  ( although i would n't touch a bat , either . ), 
  just write stuff down all the time and file stuff appropriately !, 
  if you truly commit to this and you still forget things then you need help , but do n't knock it until you 've really tried it, 
  \\  implying liberland is a real country, 
  do it !, 
  what about when i 'm supposed to already know all those things ? 
  there 's books on this i 'm sure i just do n't know them, 
  ah , for everyone bothered by something there 's another everyone who are not bothered by it at all !, 
  if i got mad when people did n't listen then i would have murdered everybody close to me already, 
  q : what are one friend say other friend ? 
  a : premise ridiculous . 
  who have two friend ? 
  i had python do the math :, 
     for y in range ( 2,13 ) :, 
  ... x * = 1-0 .07 * y, 
  about 1 in six thousand . 
  what was your siege modifier at the start ? 
  trying to start a new copypasta ? 
  learn to identify jokes , pls !, 
  huh , it calls mine `` linux '', 
  i used chrome on arch linux . 
  interesting . 
   also , first mention of sburb in almost 2500 pages . 
  first * by name * mention of sburb in almost 2500 pages . 
  they referenced the whole situation surrounding it several times , but they usually used euphemisms . 
   london, 
   thief, 
  sounds bout right ??? 
  they do !, 
  the word might even be derived by analogy to it ( but more probably just from babytalk or general corruption ) . 
  the first one 's the `` do n't end up inheriting ebonics '' one , right ? 
  it 's the same thing but with different problems and prettier formatting . 
  i prefer the first ed . 
  russian version . 
  i do n't understand why we have to make pages glossy these days ; regular paper is so much easier on the fingers . 
  you use machine learning when you have little idea of what 's the correct path to procede along . 
  eventually we 'll hit a problem too hard to be solved in reasonable time by ml algorithms , and what then ? 
  this is why we sometimes need to put real thought into problem-solving instead of just throwing something genetic/learning at it . 
  gofai has its merits . 
  portal 2 meanwhile had ample opportunities, 
  * amazon * pissed them off . 
  you did nothing wrong . 
  12 bucks jesus h christ . 
  well , a certain kind of person prefers the factorials . 
  the venetians made the crusade happen the way it did though, 
   louis xiv of france, 
   pacahuti the earth shaker of inca, 
  you give the earth shaker his rightful title but not the sun king ? 
  relatedly , hungarian is just backwards/badly-transcribed tagalog . 
  wake up sheeple !, 
  - sov or osv vs vso or vos ( although you can have others in both ), 
  - `` van '' vs `` may '' for `` there is '', 
  - '' - ni '' vs '' - in '' for infinitives and imperatives ( although '' - ni '' is very imperious in hu as an imperative ), 
  - `` az '' vs `` ay '' for reversed sentence order, 
  - `` itt '' vs `` heto '' for `` here '' ( although the tl word is only used in the comment ), 
  - '' - ok '' vs `` ko '' for 1st person singular subjects, 
  - '' - ja / - je '' vs '' ( ni ) ya '' for 3sg possession, 
  - '' - ik '' vs `` ika - '' for ordinals, 
  - '' - s '' vs `` ma - '' for forming adjectives ( going on opposite ends of a word ), 
  - no copula in 3rd person ( and informally in other persons ) vs nearly no copula at all, 
  - caudal case markers vs initial case markers, 
  - loads of latin loanwords vs loads of spanish loanwords, 
  - `` persze '' vs `` siyempre '' for `` of course '', 
  - `` t\u00e9nyleg '' vs `` talaga '' for `` really '', 
  - `` kell '' vs `` kailangan '' for `` be needed '', 
  - `` anya '' and `` apa '' vs `` ina '' and `` ama '' for parents ( i realize parents ' names are false cognates worldwide due to having similar etymologies , but these are decidedly more similar to each other ), 
  - both have a first person dual ( i * verb * you ) , but no other dual, 
  - both have topic-comment structure, 
  - both are agglutinative, 
  - both genderless, 
  - both express having and needing with impersonal verbs, 
  of course , this is all a huge joke and a coincidence . 
  i 'm not actually arguing that they 're related ( although non-sino-tibetan asian languages , even ie ones , tend to be agglutinative , like one huge areal feature ; i do n't think the structural similarity is 100 % coincidental ) . 
  that would be silly . 
  edit : also , in komi , the 3sg and 3pl pronouns are respectively `` siy\u00f6 '' and `` nay\u00f6 '' . 
  compare with the direct and indirect forms of the 3sg pronoun in tl , `` siya '' and `` niya '' . 
  ( also `` we '' is `` ti '' and `` this '' is `` tay\u00f6 '' in komi ; compare with 1pl inclusive pronoun `` tayo '' in tl . ), 
  someday i will organize all of these silly observations into a list , and publish a big long stupid book that / r/badlinguistics will eat up . 
  if somebody could write volumes about how tamil is related to every language under the sun , or about how arabic is related to every language under the sun , it can totally be done for a `` uralonesian '' family hypothesis . 
  edit 2 : there 's some legitimate bad linguistics in this thread , though . 
  comparing languages to programming languages ? 
  japanese is `` object-oriented '' ? 
  the far more common construction is the use of the comma as a thousands separator .
