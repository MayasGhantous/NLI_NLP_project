  use something unambiguous . 
  use something unambiguous in the * translation * , which you are producing for a primarily * english-speaking * audience . 
  if you use german punctuation , they will not understand you . 
  it 's better for it to not be uncertain . 
  i do n't doubt that the post was made completely honestly by someone who actually wanted to share it , but damn is that machine creepy . 
  i 'm not sure how much more strongly you can cultivate brand loyalty by getting someone to hug a freakin ' monolith plastered with your brand . 
  and as a reward they get your product !, 
  joy !, 
  to start off the thread , here 's my case for `` hungarian is just backwards/badly-transcribed tagalog . '', 
  wake up sheeple !, 
  - sov or osv vs vso or vos ( although you can have others in both ), 
  - `` van '' vs `` may '' for `` there is '', 
  - '' - ni '' vs '' - in '' for infinitives and imperatives ( although '' - ni '' is very imperious in hu as an imperative ), 
  - `` az '' vs `` ay '' for reversed sentence order, 
  - `` itt '' vs `` heto '' for `` here '' ( although the tl word is only used in the comment ), 
  - '' - ok '' vs `` ko '' for 1st person singular subjects, 
  - '' - ja / - je '' vs '' ( ni ) ya '' for 3sg possession, 
  - '' - ik '' vs `` ika - '' for ordinals, 
  - '' - s '' vs `` ma - '' for forming adjectives ( going on opposite ends of a word ), 
  - no copula in 3rd person ( and informally in other persons ) vs nearly no copula at all, 
  - caudal case markers vs initial case markers, 
  - loads of latin loanwords vs loads of spanish loanwords, 
  - `` persze '' vs `` siyempre '' for `` of course '', 
  - `` t\u00e9nyleg '' vs `` talaga '' for `` really '', 
  - `` anya '' and `` apa '' vs `` ina '' and `` ama '' for parents ( i realize parents ' names are false cognates worldwide due to having similar etymologies , but these are decidedly more similar to each other ), 
  - both have a first person dual ( i * verb * you ) , but no other dual, 
  - both have topic-comment structure, 
  - both are agglutinative, 
  - both genderless, 
  tbf the `` original '' form did n't include any fricatives at all , and stayed near the front of the mouth . 
  the article 's utter rubbish , though . 
  this just was n't made for piano sonata # 14 mvt . 
  3 . :p the flourishes do n't translate very well into keyboard mashing . 
  ah , you were lucky . 
  my sister had terrible judgment in boyfriends . 
  now she 's in college and is n't fond of dating . 
  yeah doxxing 's not cool . 
  if they knew each other irl beforehand though , then that 's a different story, 
  it 's arabic . 
  there 's a wide variety of languages that use that alphabet , but the words are arabic . 
  i 'm going to make one of these for hungary and be as inclusive as possible . 
  a pound sign . 
  the image in the post said that the timeline is in the shape of the original sign . 
  i do n't believe you . 
  would n't you just get an initial epenthetic vowel , e.g. 
  `` isquid '' ? 
  although , what a terrible map . 
  pm the mods or something !, 
  i 'd support it . 
  out of the possible ways this could have gone , though , this is above-average . 
  usually you get the top comment reading something like `` lol look at all of those diacritics in whatever language that is '' and the actual post even saying what it is gets buried, 
  to be fair a significant percentage of it is desert . 
  i mean it 's an entire continent full of people of course it 's extremely diverse but also a big portion of it 's ridiculously uninhabitable . 
  it 's sad though that even in western ( ized ) countries where you 're supposed to have a comprehensive and worldly education people are surprised by the diversity of continents . 
  other , smaller diverse regions people should check out are the caucasus , russia , the indian subcontinent ( although most people probably know it 's really diverse ) , any islands on the pacific ocean ( especially papua and the surrounding islands ) , and central/south america ( which is , admittedly , actually a continent ) . 
  this is n't really true at all though . 
  [ japanese has plenty allophony rules . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japanese_phonology ) ( allophony is when sounds change in different contexts ), 
  i upvoted just for the alliteration . 
  it 's beautiful, 
  also uncontacted humans !, 
  that 's in georgia , not louisiana, 
  extremely technically , it was actually a slightly different flag . 
  the placement of the circle was adjusted very slightly towards the center not long ago . 
  ( although i believe that was actually a restoration of an older flag , so it could have been the same . ), 
  yes and i am deliberately misunderstanding your joke because it 's funny to do so, 
  you have a much better field of view , and have equilibrioception ( a feeling of which way you 're oriented ) and proprioception ( a feeling of where your body parts are ) to help you out irl . 
  it 's risky but not extremely difficult . 
  people generally use aave ( or a poor imitation of it ) around here , and [ aave does n't inflect verbs for person ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/african_american_vernacular_english#other_grammatical_characteristics ) ( see the second bullet point ), 
  what good is steak that does n't burn your mouth ? 
  serious question . 
  steak that is n't rather hot tends to create a clammy and unpleasant experience for me . 
  \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af some things i ca n't stand any other way . 
  relatedly i prefer most foods extremely spicy by western standards . 
  probably has to do with the cuisine i grew up with ( hungarian ) . 
  just noticed your username !, 
  what drowns in fjords and is equivalent to the axiom of choice ? 
  zorn 's lemming !, 
  not this one , this really does n't seem like the kind of marketing espn would employ , and it * is * a good logo for calligraphy, 
  the fakeness would drive me insane after a couple months, 
  i loved it when it came out but in retrospect it was n't that good . 
  the dialogue was great and it hit the target audience very well but compared to even the other marvel movies it lacked maturity or something important to say . 
  which is generally * fine , * except it makes the movie less interesting . 
  what flag do you have there , anyway ? 
  i only know of the old sultanate of brunei that has that flag . 
  edit : [ it 's the ayyubids ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ayyubid_dynasty ) . 
  wow , how long has it been since egypt was ruled by egyptians ? 
   beyond just catholic power, 
  beyond catholic power they have what ? 
  relatively large sums of money ? 
   will, 
  do they plan to release this data ? 
  well yeah , or else the keys scratch the phone and/or the wallet . 
  the wallet and the phone do n't get put together because they do n't fit and/or are inconvenient to individually tease out . 
  it 's always the same pockets because consistency is useful . 
  well i mean , if afghanistan needed an orphanage , what was he supposed to do ? 
  not build them an orphanage ? 
  to play devil 's advocate , we do n't see the positive results of the program . 
  without it the frequency might be vastly higher . 
  but realistically putting such a massive violation of privacy in the hands of the government is pretty unjustifiable , even if the us government is by far not the most evil one that could end up with it .
