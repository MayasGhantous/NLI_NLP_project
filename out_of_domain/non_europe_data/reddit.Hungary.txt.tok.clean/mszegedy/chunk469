  you 're * really * giving them too much credit, 
  edit : nvm , confused espn with a major sports store chain , feel dumb now . 
  i 'd say it 's 50/50, 
  no , i mean better to be in a real tropical paradise . 
  would it seriously not bother you if everything were made of plastic ? 
  if it all felt and smelled the same ? 
  if for months on end you 'd look at the same wall and the exact same painted landscape , and observe that the brush strokes you noticed on day 3 in that tree in the distance are exactly the same as they were yesterday , and the day before , and the week before , and the month before , and that that rock formation on the wall is still the exact same three shades of orange ? 
  there 's few ways to make a nuclear apocalypse or confinement in a small space suck less , and this * is * one of them , but it does n't make it not suck . 
  maybe dave 's face while roxy 's quizzing him is & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; ? 
   sardinia controlled by tunis, 
  cato did n't die for this, 
  this is a really pretty document !, 
  tell us more about the orthography of cindri and the phonology of yuk\u0169a | fla\u0137a \u00dct\u00e6k | qval\u0331sa . 
  actually , tell us more about flaka/qvalsa in general , it looks strange . 
  are the prefixes case markers or somthing ? 
  and granada 's owned by spain, 
  we were part of austria for hundreds of years and our language is n't even included in the list ? 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; i guess hungary really has gained independence, 
  i find it really easy to rap in hungarian because , despite its relatively large phoneme inventory , it has vowel harmony . 
  it is also agglutinative and prefers suffixes for inflection , so there 's a limited number of syllables with which to end a word , which even overlap for nouns and verbs . 
  so you 'd look for a language with few phonemes ( especially vowels ) , restricted syllable clusters , vowel harmony ( or other kinds of harmony , but especially vowel ) , and maybe agglutinativity and suffixes . 
  amazingly the world phonotactics database does n't keep data on harmony , so i ca n't single out this language . 
  as a native speaker of hungarian , same, 
   the romance languages moved away from cases . 
  english , at least , moved away from grammatical gender , cases , and complex verb conjugations . 
  north germanic languages moved away from cases and complex verb conjugations , etc. 
  so did the slavic languages . 
  are we eventually going to get cases back in ie languages ? 
  i just noticed , verbix gives the wrong flag for haiti , they added an ugly coat of arms in 1986 when they met liechtenstein at the olympics and realized they had the same flag . 
  i ca n't really blame verbix for preferring the original, 
  i 'm only teasing , it was a fun survey, 
  wow , they are . 
  still waiting on tagalog ... 
  tagalog is n't even on there yet . 
  no one 's even working on it , god, 
  closest 's `` jung machen '' , `` to make young '' . 
  but that 's what it looks like , not sounds like , since `` ch '' makes somewhere between a `` h '' and `` sh '' sound in german , as opposed to a `` ch '' sound . 
  inb4 someone says quenya or solresol, 
  my god , what a great idea . 
  how was this done , at what start date ? 
  edit : oh , it 's a random nations start . 
  what a disappointment . 
  gon na try and make this real now . 
  guyenne is * also * called guyana ? 
  in an unrelated etymology to the regions in northern south america ? 
  r u kidding me m8, 
  much better than the [ actual one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/flag_of_ethiopia_%281987%e2%80%931991%29.svg ), 
  ca n't someone come up with a better one ? 
  savoy 's a shithole , how did they help ? 
  huh . 
  eh , that is pretty much what octopuses look like outside of water, 
  even the bigger ones . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=68e_1364664200 ) is one of the internet 's favorite octopus videos . 
  although now looking at it , it does seem somewhat flatter, 
  edit : you tell 'em !, 
  fuck the haters !, 
  come join us at / r/cephalopods , we love octopuses, 
  `` octopi '' is considered incorrect seeing as, 
  - it 's not latin , it 's greek, 
  - the greek plural is '' - podes '', 
  so if you want to not be `` wrong '' , say `` octopuses '' or `` octopodes '', 
  yeah . 
  the biggest problem is that it has like 10 different colors . 
  although many colors can occasionally look good ; see this [ pan-uralic flag ] ( http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs24/f/2008/024/f/8/hu_fi_ud_by_varpho.png ) . 
  or for that matter the [ flag of seychelles ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/flag_of_seychelles.svg/2000px-flag_of_seychelles.svg.png ) , although there 's mixed opinions about that one and i 'm not sure how i feel about it myself . 
  but the colors are way better ( although , as every eu4 player knows , they did used to have [ red and gold ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/flag_of_morocco_1258_1659.svg ) ), 
  hey , you take that back about the flag of the old roc !, 
  looking at that pan-celtic flag again , the colors are n't actually too terrible . 
  black and white , blue , cyan , two slightly different shades of green , two slightly different shades of maroon , and orange . 
  7 in total , and they 're kinda similar . 
  could be made to work . 
  it also depends on what was played . 
  specific individual tones or combinations of tones might sound terrible , while the rest of the instrument sounds fine . 
  mental breakdown is the video , lux aeterna is the audio, 
  [ ] ( / yourewelcome ), 
  hungary ( although it did n't really count , i never even unpaused the game , just looked around for an hour or two ) . 
  then ottomans . 
  then sulu . 
  then perm . 
  now demak . 
  the res shows up pixelated because the website hates hotlinking . 
  ( as far as i can tell , it actually takes * more * work to pixelate it and then show it , but never mind . ), 
  [ here 's ] ( http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/anewhopeposter.jpg ) a good hi-res one found using google images . 
  especially the last one . 
  these all have the saturation turned up to 12 . 
  apparently [ these ] ( http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/w/waking_the_cadaver/chased_through_the_woods_by_a_rapist.html ) are the actual lyrics . 
  i 'm almost sure that those were n't actually what they recorded when making that `` song . '', 
  i 'm pretty sure he meant to say `` alphabets '' . 
  do you know how many writing systems there are surrounding earth ? 
  sure !, 
  i 'll do a writeup this week . 
  what 's with the extra blob near london ? 
  generic migration to the capital ? 
  speed of sound then, 
  of course , just trying to be accountable :p, 
  true , but they 're related and both are worth mentioning . 
  sometimes it 's okay to have fun for an hour or two, 
  and mother , if he 's the same as b1 dad !, 
  well , it could be the same by author 's fiat . 
  hussie 'd totally do it , too .
