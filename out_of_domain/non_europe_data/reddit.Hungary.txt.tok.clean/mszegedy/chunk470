  thankfully that does n't have any consequences for the genetics, 
  i see it : `` kuh-nay-uh '', 
  i love upside-down bohemia . 
  their flag is , after all , the polish flag with the blue chevron , and the polish flag is n't white-red ... 
  i * the * myself he/she/it died , get it right !, 
  or how about we just burn them to ash ? 
  really , i 'm surprised no one 's ever thought of this before . 
  would having el dorado prevent you from exploring manually ? 
  anything that saves you monarch points is the best , and the mughals have at least four of them . 
  also you get claims on all of india , which further reduces the amount of monarch points you spend . 
  the catholic controller node is much more economical , it fits on one dude 's head . 
  you think the popemobile is to protect the * pope ? 
  the cham are an ethnic minority in vietnam and are austronesian , like the malays and filipinos . 
  they are strange and rare nowadays .

  reverse triathlon, 
  this is exactly what i originally wanted to become a diver for as a kid . 
  now i 've been certified for over a decade and a half and still have n't done this . 
  it is unsafe , because not only do you have to hold your breath for it , but also because you have to spit out your regulator and let water into your mouth . 
  that said , still doing it when i get the chance . 
  it 's super cool and actually the reason i originally became interested in diving , but it is also massively unsafe . 
  opinions ? 
   please do n't actually harass these people with downvoting or insults . 
  what the hell did you think was going to happen ? 
  it is unclear whether the bubbles are coming out because he 's deliberately exhaling them , or simply because his mask is releasing air because of poor fit . 
  typically , how a diver would do this is :, 
  - stop breathing, 
  - take out regulator, 
  - fill mouth with water, 
  at which point you 're only one small disaster away from drowning . 
  does the flush function of the regulator work when you have already breathed in water into your lungs ? 
  eu3 events mod ? 
  huh . 
  new opening plan for spain : get down to -3 stab and stay that way . 
  ruler dies , you get `` illegitimate ruler '' for five years , which gives you +2 revolt risk and -1 legit/yr, 
  but conventional color is three-dimensional , while these people with colorblindness get only two-dimensional color . 
  how does that carry over ? 
  ( there 's ways to map 3d onto 2d with no loss of information , but none of them are elegant or intuitive . ), 
  you won a war against austria ? 
  who were your allies ? 
  nice !, 
  everybody is calling it a dlc , but are they really leaving such drastic changes to a paid thing rather than an update ? 
  click the `` go home at war '' option !, 
  it does n't solve the whole problem because sometimes you really need that trade income , but they wo n't die , at least . 
  banned for switching to a different dialect ? 
  smh, 
  also , there 's a tiny serbia there, 
  \\ / r/lookslikeandrewhussie ` swork, 
  you have to check `` americans ca n't speak english '', 
  the first one looks like / u/440hertz 's [ redesign ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/19g88y/ocwhat_if_the_flags_of_all_countries_were_based/ ) of the flag of the philippines, 
  portal gun confirmed for relativity violation, 
  his dreamself was already knocked out , but would n't it have woken up if his regular self had been subsequently knocked out ? 
  given that permanently getting that body is n't really any different . 
  i guess the mechanics are a little fuzzy on that . 
  imo sending his head was a greater risk . 
  yes , denaturing a protein does n't change its flavor . 
  not like that 's where the flavor comes from anyway . 
  but ... it would still be him doing it . 
  well , also the medium is full of air ( maybe ? 
  ) , which most certainly did * not * fuse to dirk . 
  then again it did n't fuse to the meteor either which was apparently traveling at the speed of light ( iirc ) . 
  the reason i figured that it was lightspeed or something was :, 
  - dirk was traveling at the same speed as jack, 
  - jack was probably traveling at the same speed as the meteor, 
  - the meteor was traveling at `` c '' ( although it seemed to have slowed down by the time it got to the b2 session ; iirc the narration even commented on it ), 
  most storytelling in homestuck indicates that lightspeed is very slow in the medium ( e.g. , it takes jade 's ship 3 ns to travel one yard in hussie 's house , which is consistent with lightspeed as we know it , but when it 's back in the medium , it seems to be going a lot slower ) , but if that were the case , lots of physical phenomena would be different , so i dunno . 
  so what i really meant was that the portal gun can break the speed limit of the medium , whatever it is . 
  even when there 's an actual choice , it does n't mean you ca n't see the whole thing . 
  you just have to read the pages enough times until you 've read all of them and taken all the paths . 
  ( although some paths are more boring than others . 
  if a path loops back on itself then you can just keep going around forever . ), 
  he necessarily ca n't know for sure , since he has n't seen or heard of a regular self dying specifically while the dreamself is knocked out . 
  which is exactly what killing himself * was n't . 
  * he might have had time to try out the double-knocked-out thing before , but he definitely had n't died and gotten woken up before . 
  the important part of `` gravity '' though is acceleration relative to your immediate surroundings , and there 's indeed none of that in orbit, 
  they 're both partially recognized states , at least, 
  well , the source video was on partially recognized states anyway . 
  they also gave abkhazia taiwan 's flag , so i dunno, 
  i maintain that falling really is a lot more important to us than orbiting . 
  ( not that they are n't really the same phenomenon . ), 
  we did n't even realize orbiting existed the way it does until newton formalized gravity . 
  of course we 'd all be dead if the earth did n't orbit the sun , or for that matter the sun were n't held together by gravity , but there 's thousands of things like that that rarely concern people , and just because orbits belong to that group of things does n't make them `` important '' except if you are explicitly thinking in terms of physics or things which would kill us if they did n't exist , which is not the case here . 
  ( a person who wants to know about what it 's like to live in space is not thinking in terms of either of those things . 
  they 're thinking in terms of , like you said , `` everyday life '' . ), 
   and even still , an astronaut would make a distinction between feeling weightless and `` no gravity acting on something . '', 
  that 's probably true , but there 's a difference between that and the usual pedantry surrounding microgravity which max2407 seemed to be invoking . 
  ^ ( also , the post was talking about * imagining * no gravity acting , but whatever . ), 
  he may read this comment , so good luck . 
  that 's the worst protestant reformation i 've ever seen, 
   standard iberia, 
   no spain, 
  the ai does n't really seem to be into the iberian wedding nowadays . 
  dunno why . 
  he already has `` cool rock '' and `` hot rock '' in his diagram so i do n't think that he will get the mechanism wrong . 
  plus `` convection '' is a very elementary mistake to make . 
  ( while `` cool rock sinks '' is a simplified model , we * are * talking about a book that only uses the 1000 most common words in the english language . ), 
  i think it 's a newer borrowing from aave , and yes . 
  it 's documented since [ at least the 90s ] ( https://books.google.com/books?id=gmqhl_ifbdoc&amp;pg=pa144&amp;dq=%22throw+shade%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=5g5wvdiomjllsatnrohyag&amp;ved=0ccsq6aewag#v=onepage&amp;q=%22throw%20shade%22&amp;f=false ) but it might go back much farther . 
  there 's not a lot of good written sources on aave , although there 's a couple , which are mainly novels with black characters in them where the author is questionably fluent in the dialect . 
  what if someone forcibly lobotomizes me ?
