  hussie said he wo n't do another flash as long . 
  he does tend to go back on his word in terms of length , but maybe not this time . 
  on the other hand , he 'll probably do many shorter ones . 
  he probably does n't know too much english . 
  for the record , this is how you would write it in hungarian ( op 's first language ) , more or less ( noun phrase + `` that '' conjunction + question sentence ) , although it would be more like `` the best example of which that why do chemists wear lab coats '' , or `` the best example about ( which ) that why do chemists wear lab coats '' . 
  hungary 's actually got the second-lowest english literacy rate in europe , and that 's only if you count turkey as european . 
  as a ta :, 
  - talks like dracula ( brilliant that they identified the accent correctly ), 
  - dresses weirdly ( i like bright colors ), 
  that 's it . 
  :\\ rmp is n't very useful apparently . 
  although the accent thing is relevant i guess for rating understandability .

  ( no , most surnames in hungarian are just a place name + - i / - y.

  what the hell was this guy 's problem ? 
  edit : i suppose he could have been foreign, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  `` nigga '' is a pronoun in aave , and that is how the gym instructor was using it . 
  it might have been awkward if he 'd just been using `` nigga '' as a pronoun without knowing how to speak the rest of aave , but presumably he was n't dumb enough to do that .

  your analogy does n't work for the exact reason why i originally made my comment . 
  said guy , being american , should have * known * that if a black guy says `` nigga '' or anything close to it , they are far more likely to be speaking aave than to be using a racial slur . 
  especially as a friendly greeting . 
  especially near other contextualizing words that are also indicative of aave , like `` what 's up ? '', 
  or whatever the rest of the greeting was . 
  if he could n't immediately identify it as aave , he either grew up very sheltered , or far away from american culture . 
  ( or both . ), 
  if he * did * immediately identify it as aave , then his reaction was needlessly obtuse and provocative . 
  ask / u/languagejones ? 
  edit : i guess it would be more accurate to call it a form of address , while `` ma nigga '' would be an actual pronoun ( as well as `` a nigga '' , and `` my/your/etc 's ass '' ), 
  yes, 
  that 's true ( although i 'd like to see a dialect of aave that does n't use it !, 
  ) , but when part of a greeting ( from a black person no less ) , it should be clear that it 's being used in the same sense as aave uses it .

  alright , but when you say it 's a `` historical linguistics survey '' , people expect it to be about hl in general . 
  this is just english historical linguistics . 
  if you want it to be more representative of the field of historical linguistics in general , you can ask about cognates , loanwords , and how much different languages are related to each other . 
  ( or you can make it just about english , but then call it an `` english '' historical linguistics survey or something . ), 
  speaking a language with no present/future tenses , i have to nitpick that you can still talk about the future in such languages , it 's just context-dependent . 
  they do n't know how to use character encoding properly apparently .

  yeah , i never would have been able to do my sulu run without it . 
  what i want to know is , why ca n't you split up the sphere into the two subsets of `` every other '' point and `` every other other '' point ? 
  or , anyway , the two subsets that end up becoming the two spheres ? 
  why 's it got to be 5 or more pieces ? 
  but the banach-tarski decomposition ca n't work like the former example , because then there is only one , say , point that is at the top of the sphere , that will eventually be missing from one sphere or the other . 
  i guess what allows you to do this is rotation , which allows you to plug the gaps missing from the split , and for which you indeed need more than two pieces to be worthwhile . 
  ( this is analogous in the decomposition of [ 0,1 ] to adding an offset to each number . 
  if you add a certain amount to an irrational number , it can after all become rational and plug those gaps . 
  but rational/irrational might not be the only way to separate them . ), 
  this still does n't explain why you need 5 , as opposed to , say , 4 , but the explanation for that probably is n't easy .
