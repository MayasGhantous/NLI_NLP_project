  more like hungarian-croatian commonwealth, 
  and what about the five or so characters in armenian that resemble latin , but the rest of which would be completely original ? 
  basing it entirely on visual similarity , unless they are defined to be and thought of as the same character , is duuuuumb . 
  tbf that 's because we use the word `` botany '' and not the word `` wortlore '' . 
  learning english in new jersey , i always just pronounced it [ \u02c8a\u026a\u0279\u0259n ] , until i was taught that the metal is [ \u02c8a\u026a\u0279\u0259n ] and the tool is [ \u02c8a\u026a\u025an ] . 
  also , i was taught that [ \u02c8k\u02b0\u028c\u0271f\u025atb\u026b\u0329 ] or whatever is incorrect , and [ \u02c8k\u02b0\u028c\u0271ft\u025ab\u026b\u0329 ] is the only correct pronunciation . 
  one man 's `` talking like stupid children '' is another man 's `` not talking like stupid children '' , i guess . 
  well , since < r  gets treated like a consonant in english and < en  is a common coda producing [ \u0259n ] or [ n\u0329 ] , [ \u02c8a\u026a\u0279\u0259n ] makes more sense to most speakers than [ \u02c8a\u026a\u025an ] . 
  it 's just that [ \u0279\u0259 ] can easily become [ \u025a ] by elision of the [ \u0259 ] . 
  right , but the linked post was arguing that we should make `` wortlore '' the standard because it 's easier to understand on first hearing it . 
  so to truly test their hypothesis , you 'd need to ask only 6-year-olds that have n't heard either before . 
  and really , they 're imagining an anglish-only world , so they 're supposing that the kids learned the word `` wort '' instead of `` plant '' , and maybe also heard the word `` lore '' before to describe other fields that we 'd normally use latin or greek names for . 
  in this world , `` wortlore '' might actually be easier to understand upon first hearing it . 
  the actual reason that they 're being dumb is n't that the kids of today would n't understand `` wortlore '' better ; it 's that it does n't really matter how easy or hard certain words are to learn . 
  take it from an agglutinative language speaker , it does n't make a difference . 
  to is way too high . 
  muscovy is too high because while they have good ideas , positional advantage is more important , and they * do * have that , but they can get stomped early-game if they get declared on by more than one country a the same time ( e.g. 
  the hordes ) . 
  that 's true and a very good point , but the purported advantage of anglish is that some of the roots we already use and are familiar with would become more ubiquitous in compounds , rather than forming the words from latin loans or greek components which do n't have to do with the core vocabulary . 
  where language purism departs from prescriptivism for the sake of education is that they 'd also try to replace roots for no good reason , like `` plant '' and `` study '' like you mentioned . 
  purists just ca n't differentiate loanwords from advanced vocabulary . 
  that would be kind of an interesting project , actually , turning the more advanced terms in english into a bunch of compounds formed from the x most frequent words ( where x is about 1,000 ) . 
  * germanic agglutinativity : the revenge * . 
  this is basically what we do to moles in hungary, 
  edit : [ but apparently it 's a bad idea ] ( http://www.vakondstop.hu/vedekezes-a-vakond-ellen.html#13 ), 
  what i love about that song is that it 's a very old example of what is otherwise a fairly modern phenomenon : http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/stupidstatementdancemix, 
  russia is a nebula . 
  gas giants are ridiculously dense on the inside , and that 's only true of russia if you mean the * other * kind of dense . 
  new nations , occasionally , like isis, 
  plus the kernels appeared in exactly the same spot then which could have messed things up . 
  or maybe hussie did n't have anything in mind and it does n't really matter what we believe about it . 
  i did n't like that blog post very much and was slightly disappointed to see it get to the top of / r/programming . 
  it argues against having multiple code points for visually similar letters in a number of scripts , which is really silly considering that that would do things like erase a third ( but only a third ) of the armenian alphabet , whose characters are assuredly different things than latin ones and are semi-commonly used together with them . 
  no , i was an engineering major . 
  i know , i know , `` death of the author '' , `` reader-response criticism '' , `` new criticism '' , et cetera . 
  there 's lots of schools of criticism that treat the intent of the author as irrelevant . 
  but given that hussie is still alive and actively adding to the homestuck canon , and given that the fanbase is mostly made up of teenagers with little/no experience in literary criticism , i figured that the nature of our speculations is generally that we try and predict what hussie will say about that part of canon , not a more abstract attempt to provide an interpretation of the work based on the content provided or something like that . 
  if i were to provide a serious literary interpretation of * homestuck * , i 'd probably use new criticism , but here i was just responding to existing criticism in the theoretical framework that i supposed that they were already in . 
  ( i guess * you * were n't doing any author-centric literary analysis , but i 'm not so convinced about the majority of people who care about what happened to caliborn 's sprites . 
  these * are * people who are trying to figure out what `` really '' happened , after all , while there was n't really anything that happened apart from that hussie made a flash with a flashing kernel in it that turned into a black hole . 
  they 've got to be assuming * some * sort of existence of a one true interpretation . ), 
  we 've had the ammonium dichromate volcano here before , actually !, 
  i believe it also had mercury thiocyanate or something similar on the inside as well . 
  the group as we know it came about partially because the chechen terrorists melded with an existing proto-isis group in syria, 
  or just dirk powers, 
  they 're about as different as `` hot '' and `` hate '' in english , which is to say very, 
   but in your efforts to cut cost, 
  more like keep up supply . 
  the mcd network is massive . 
  every time they add a meal or change a minor thing they have to seriously consider whether there 's enough food in the world for it to be possible . 
  fwiw mcd in hungary is decent from what i remember , although i have n't had it in a few years . 
  this attitude is n't good though . 
  lots of people forget that works of fiction are n't real life and everything needed a deliberate decision to be put in , resulting in threads on reddit like [ this one ] ( http://www.np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/35q4fz/how_two_days_one_night_uses_frames_within_frames/ ) where someone points out symbolism that would otherwise be obvious ( like [ this shot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vjxb6np.png ) , or [ this shot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kpww8jj.png ) ) and everyone dismisses it as `` trying too hard '' or `` overanalyzing '' . 
  in real life , they 're all believable coincidences ( which is usually the whole point of symbolism -- if it ca n't be interpreted as coincidence , then it loses its subtlety and the characters start to notice , among other artless consequences ) , but when they 're in a * television show * where people * put together the entire set themselves * and they * put the cameras in particular places * and they * evaluated all of the blocking in the scenes , * then it 's a wonder when a part of the composition * is n't * thought about . 
  this principle applies to all fiction and it 's disappointing to see reddit miss it . 
  sorry if it sounds like i 'm picking on you in particular , that 's totally not it . 
  i can totally empathize with literature instructors forcing you to go over every detail of a work and making claims about symbolism that sound very spurious , and it can make somebody hate a literature course very fast . 
  it 's just that with a certain mindset , you can make life a lot harder and less interesting for yourself . 
  and if there 's several thousand of you , you can totally ruin a / r/movies thread . 
   that said , `` death of the author '' does not require a literal author death , and if it did , we got one in the comic already so it 's all good . 
  oh , haha , that 's not what i meant by `` still alive '' ... maybe i should have said `` still active '' . 
  croatia 's got rakija , too, 
  what did you bastards do to pannonia ?? 
  you 're not misunderstanding , the guy really was suggesting that we should combine those . 
  and you bring up a good point -- this would make uppercase/lowercase conversion a lot more confusing . 
  what 's the uppercase version of `` h '' ? 
  well , it depends on the language , so i 've got to specify it in advance ? 
  how do i do that , pass an extra parameter ? 
  what 's in the parameter , a string with the iso language code ? 
  it 's a mess . 
  the advantage is ... less redundancy ? 
  i do n't really know . 
  no one said it all has to be symbolic , just have a purpose . 
  otherwise it would n't be there in the first place !, 
  and symbolism is one of the easiest purposes to look for ( our brains are great at drawing connections ) , and is also cheap to put in , so it crops up a lot . 
  if you 're theorizing about what the author specifically was thinking about when they put stuff in , you can generate some false positives with symbolic interpretations , but that 's generally not why people do it , and `` creates atmosphere ( har har , literally ) '' is going to be a more likely interpretation for a cigarette than `` we wanted to use a smoke machine '' . 
  now , if you see a coke can , on the other hand ... 
  is that possible if you have no fuel left nor some ridiculous lithobraking equipment ? 
  i know kerbals have been known to bounce , but i thought that was fixed . 
   have you * read * ayn rand ? 
  my theory is that the purpose of most of her writing is to actively try and kill you , whether by boring you to death or making you commit suicide when you realize that there 's tons of people who read this stuff and totally buy into it . 
   anyway , you ca n't discount the null hypothesis : hussie 's making it up as he goes along . 
  there might not be any clear rules about kernelsprites until he needs there to be . 
  so long as they fit what we 've already seen , his makeshituppedness is indistinguishable from foreshadowing . 
  well , there 's a purpose to that too !, 
  creating a lighthearted tone is important for hussie and * homestuck * , and there 's essays to be written about it . 
  but iirc apparently he does do `` foreshadowing '' of sorts , he tried to fill the earlier part of the comic with as much random shit as possible to potentially do callbacks to or make relevant later . 
  i 'm so happy this is the top comment , i was really starting to think i was the only one given how not even the internet seemed to recognize the possibility, 
  and the horrible part was , some of the text is pictures , so it did n't work on them, 
  she does n't , this was misdrawn by accident . 
  op corrected it elsewhere in the thread, 
   is n't hurting anyone, 
  tell that to anyone who 's ever used it for tattoos . 
  yes, 
  they could have done a lot worse , though, 
  that 's strange . 
  try blowing more air through on the alveolar part ? 
  if there 's one thing that wo n't get changed , it 's that , since they 're shifting to monthly modifiers, 
   have own language, 
  mostly because they mispronounce all of the names .
