  my god . 
  ( i dunno about the rest . 
  i appreciated the straightforward delivery . ), 
  to be fair the linked posts are actually terrible . 
  but , wow , if these subscribers are so much smarter than these people , i thought they 'd at least know about `` hypocrisy '' . 
  bulgaria , and ... slovenia ? 
  who ? 
  what is that sentence supposed to mean ? 
  neither are accusative , and an apposition or an ablative * familia * both seem unlikely interpretations . 
  what a strange combination of languages to use for a stereotype . 
  i think there 's maybe a thousand people in the world who would ever code-switch between chinese , spanish , and english . 
  i dunno about his , but mine runs linux , so i felt a little pain in my heart when the first step was to download a . exe, 
  well , honestly the culture itself is n't too different , and if they had their own culture group nobody would ever come even close to accepting them . 
  i 'm just glad that the identity of hungarians as uralic has enough impetus to prevent us from being in the same culture group as the czechs and slovaks , even though there 's few real differences between our cultures ( and genes for that matter ) . 
  pretending to be unique is fun . 
  i dunno , they mock people for thinking they 're smarter than they are , and for mocking people as a consequence of that . 
  these people think they 're smarter than they are , and mock people as a consequence of that . 
  sounds like hypocrisy to me . 
  oh , i thought it was a sentence we 're supposed to plug into gtranslate to see how bad the translation is, 
  it 's more of an angry advice mallard or a morpheus, 
  more like fuzz with fuzz, 
  oh my god , who made this ? 
  why not just a video ? 
  / r/shittytumblrgifs would have a field day with this thing, 
  sorry , i do n't play ck2 , what is unusual about this picture ? 
  does the heir have unusually good stats in combination with some sort of modifier that makes him likely to die ? 
  ( i see the two 100 's at the top left , i 'm guessing those are parent-child relations ? ), 
  45 ** - ** x % in madrid , is n't it ? 
  spain 's already getting nerfed !, 
  but ... syphilis came from the americas & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  when i 'm annexing central america i play `` livin ' the vida loca '' on repeat, 
  and before someone asks why : bmps are stored bottom-up , and i guess they wanted it top-to-bottom ? 
  because nobody cares about southern africa , argentina , and australia ? 
  i meant getting nerfed in the future . 
  common sense will nerf spain . 
  among other things , seville is no longer an end node , france is buffed in various ways , and spain gets a new disaster , the spanish civil war . 
  there 's far more genetic diversity in syphilis in the americas than in europe . 
  i would not put any stock into claims that the spread to europe was not recent . 
  downvoting 's rude . 
  it does n't matter , you should n't do it . 
  it serves a social purpose . 
  not understanding what voting on someone 's comment communicates to them is on par with not understanding a comment because it contains a `` grammar mistake '' . 
  it 's also a consequence of being finnish . 
  but there 's a way to sort better comments towards the top without going so far as downvoting , namely just upvoting the good comments . 
  you can get the best of both worlds . 
  a popular theory of origin for the spanish flu is that it originated in france . 
  it was just a joke about [ management by perkele ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/management_by_perkele ), 
  nope, 
  no , but you 're thinking outside the box somewhat , which is good ... 
  it 's not the orange blob , which is amago . 
  but you 're correct that the ai would n't be able to unite it that quickly . 
  the cream color country is epirus . 
  but lots of other countries normally contained inside blobs have exploded out . 
  no on the country , yes on the time . 
  the game has been severely abused , though , so fucked-up ottos might not mean that i was next to them , considering that ming , timurids , and mamluks are also fucked up . 
  iraq * is * shia , though . 
  they oppress their sunnis , sort of . 
  this is ironman . 
  i * was * . 
  i used a gigantic exploit found recently . 
  that 's pretty `` unnatural '' . 
  not najd , but you got the year right, 
  in a roundabout way , yes . 
  i used [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/372i17/someone_on_steam_found_pretty_huge_nation/ ) exploit . 
  you can annex almost arbitrary amounts of land at the game start , but not only is it uncored for you , it also nukes the cores of whatever country originally owned it . 
  very impressive analysis , but i [ used an exploit . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/37w7xl/what_year_is_it_and_who_am_i_playing_as_its_not/crqazkj ) and there 's only [ one situation ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/37w7xl/what_year_is_it_and_who_am_i_playing_as_its_not/crqbbkw ) in which people condone using exploits this big !, 
  this was the aftermath of the opener of an attempt at `` three mountains '' using [ this exploit . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/372i17/someone_on_steam_found_pretty_huge_nation/ ) the country is ryukyu and the date is jan 1 , 1449 . 
  [ good guess , but i used an exploit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/37w7xl/what_year_is_it_and_who_am_i_playing_as_its_not/crqbbkw ), 
  i mainly tried to use it as a way to break up blobs ( especially ming ) and to annex japan early . 
  this attempt went wrong , as the particularists left two provinces in japan unsieged , which got sieged by amago rebels who enforced their demands . 
  at the moment i 'm mainly exploring the possibilities and limits of this exploit , rather than having a set plan . 
  there 's a lot of potential here , since it dramatically revises the start conditions . 
  0 ae would be one of the tricks that i use to do a ryukyu run , along with the small nations missions trick and others . 
  [ you got the year right !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/37w7xl/what_year_is_it_and_who_am_i_playing_as_its_not/crqbbkw ), 
  they warned you !, 
  they warned you about carthaginians , rome !, 
  is it a loanword from persian ? 
  why do n't you just link to the page directly instead of going through stupid io9, 
  / r/vaporwaveaesthetics ? 
  i 'm new to this, 
   ... large.jpg, 
  no it is n't . 
  yes , that is what i was taught . 
  i was only commenting on the french thing because it was relevant to the thread . 
  the initial impression everyone had was that it was french , right ? 
  so impossible then , unless i add a custom nation to it . 
  damn . 
  oh , i had no idea the english word `` emerald '' was directly descended from it , thanks !, 
  for the record wikitionary usually has good etymologies for languages other than english . 
  in this case [ it agrees . 
  ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/smaragdus ) funnily enough if you go to the greek entry , it lists a whole bunch of cognates in other languages as descendants , even ones that are inherited through other languages ( such as all the latin loans in eastern europe : `` szmaragd '' in polish , `` smaragd '' in hungarian ) . 
  weirdly , arabic and hebrew are listed as loans . 
  the hebrew one really is an obvious loan because it contains an epenthetic softening vowel at the beginning ( `` izmaragd '' rather than `` zmaragd '' , since the syllable onset `` zm '' is hard to pronounce for hebrew speakers ) , and i guess the arabic must be one too . 
  this points to a non-semitic root for the word , possibly from the pre-greek substrate . 
  that 's what he meant probably, 
  oh wow that is a brilliant thought . 
  i 'll have to see whether that actually works .
