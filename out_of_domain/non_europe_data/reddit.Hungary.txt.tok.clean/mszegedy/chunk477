  but i do n't think they 're equally elaborate . 
  the people who construct fantasy maps are n't very good at fractal geometry . 
  they can get the most general details mostly right ( realistic positioning and size of landmasses ) , and the smallest details right ( little archipelagos and rivers and things ) , but they fudge everything else in between . 
  asia , for all its size , does n't look like a blob ; it 's got the indian triangle sticking out , and the chinese semicircle and the malay splinter , not to mention the arabian trapezoid and the indochinese teardrop . 
  south america does n't look like a blob , either ; it 's round on one side and tapers on the other . 
  it also does n't help that , despite what i said about good size and positioning , the warcraft map looks like a big h . the top right continent has a very decent , organic shape , but the way it 's positioned makes it look weird and blocky . 
  all the continents fit in the same bounding box , and the whole layout is symmetrical . 
  despite that , though , it could be worse . 
  it * is * chemical reactions , it 's just really complicated ones . 
  then again , most of these are mediated by proteins , which imo are better understood as physical entities . 
  is that more likely than that someone just genuinely wanted this question answered ? 
  did n't you get the memo ? 
  you can embed java in anything , including the fabric of spacetime, 
  fixed, 
  there are no stupid questions . 
  it 's not a crime to be underinformed about computers , and it 's nice that they 'd actually be asking questions . 
  plus , maybe it was about aesthetics , as mentioned above . 
  but it 's * not * actually taught in schools , and many people went to school before computers became mainstream . 
  nope . 
  the word is from latin `` oriens '' , which means `` rising '' . 
  since the sun rises in the east . 
  the other direction is `` occidental '' , where the sun perishes ( from `` occidens '' , `` perishing '' ) . 
  edit : your edit is correct, 
  thank you for this , i used this trick to play as shaman perm recently . 
  it was all thanks to you . 
  unfortunately i have n't achieved my end goal yet ( conquer every place ever inhabited by uralic people and culture-convert them to uralic if necessary ) , and 1.12 will soon make it much harder , as you need a cb to take a capital . 
  however , it 's not impossible ; i can just wait for russia to annex perm , and then attack them for their formerly-perm lands and release perm from those . 
  you can do something similar to get jewish germany by waiting for an hre nation to get annexed , taking the lands formerly theirs , and releasing them from those . 
  this is more annoying , though , because you have to wait for the ai to do something , which might take a while . 
  but not on linux, 
  as a hungarian , i thought this was normal for the history of everyone in europe ? 
  ottomans , to relearn the mechanics with . 
  [ apparently ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/393vfo/english_wax_and_to_wax_and_germandutch_cognates/cs055md ) that etymology is only a conjecture, 
  well , if you compare it to only france , one of the most stable countries in europe ever , then of course . 
  but i meant in general . 
  succession crises and foreign invasions are kind of everyone 's business , are n't they ? 
  the n is `` silent '' and nasalizes the preceding vowel . 
  thus , a nasally `` wheee '' . 
  he meant `` modern '' as in `` contemporary '' , not referring to the art movement . 
  / r/badlinguistics, 
  the heat is proportional to the amount of capsaicin you can extract . 
  this method is slow and only works on chilis you already have , though . 
  even so it 's not hard to just buy a small amount of each . 
  i personally do n't like it , because while i get what it 's trying to say , a prescriptivist would n't be able to tell the first and third apart , and would just use `` pragmatism '' as an excuse . 
  also , it presents prescriptivism and descriptive linguistics as opposing arguments , when really they 're about as irrelevant to each other as creationism and the study of evolution . 
  this is sort of a general problem with smbc comics in other fields as well . 
  once , weiner had the idea to hold a `` festival '' where people gave presentations on bad ad-hoc evolutionary hypotheses , such as `` babies are physically resilient because early humans would football-punt them to other villages to spread their genes '' . 
  he called it `` bahfest '' . 
  unfortunately , if you google it now , you come up almost entirely with creationist websites that think that it 's evidence against evolution . 
  this is fine when we can ignore the creationists , but the majority of smbc 's audience is likely to be prescriptivists . 
  plus , bahfest was at least funny , whereas this comic is rather threadbare . 
  [ see my rant ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/39782a/joke_recent_smbc_on_linguistic_philosophies/cs0x89z ), 
  alternatively `` wordwisely '' , brought to you by austro-hungarian calques, 
  when i went to america for the summer , my friend 's house there would have this already rather old macintosh that ran mac os 7 or something . 
  it ran in 256 colors and had * risk * and some other , inferior games . 
  i had played tabletop * risk * before ( and had made my own knockoffs at home ) , but i liked this one better because it did all the dice-rolling for you , so your 50-stack blitzkriegs really were lightning speed . 
  we played so much on that thing . 
  it was fun to play with a friend , but i still like the game on its own . 
  i downloaded it and played it in a vm recently and it has n't lost its charm . 
  although the ai is easier to beat than i remember . 
  the old version was n't quite flawless for me but it was pretty close . 
  it would only run once . 
  if i tried to run it again , my entire computer would freeze , although if i started playing music before , then it would keep playing . 
  edit : oh my , your edit makes it work correctly . 
  up until it crashes after the loading screen anyway . 
  thanks !?!, 
  edit 2 : but it only `` worked '' once !, 
  but do all his readers ? 
  have you read [ my rant ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/39782a/joke_recent_smbc_on_linguistic_philosophies/cs0x89z ) plus i did n't post this here to make fun of it ; i posted this here because this community likes linguistics jokes . 
  the fact that i do n't like this comic is a separate issue . 
   if you came here to post a joke that we 'd like , why are you tearing it down in the same thread ? 
  because i have opinions , that are appropriate to post in a thread about whatever i have opinions about . 
  basic internet etiquette . 
  i am not `` ignoring the context '' ; if anything , you are . 
  the context is that smbc has a readership of millions , most of which are unlikely to be familiar with linguistics . 
  for most , this is an * introduction * , equal parts didactic and funny . 
  i 've been reading smbc for a long time , and he does comics like this relatively often , where he represents different fields or philosophies using humor . 
  if they 're supposed to be entirely inaccurate , then it is lost on everybody . 
  they come off as much more of a funny shorthand or mnemonic than just a joke . 
  and anyway you did n't address the last part of the rant . 
  inaccurate but funny is passable . 
  inaccurate but unfunny holds a lot less water . 
  this comic is only funny if this is really your model of these different `` linguistic philosophies '' . 
  any answer would be context-dependent . 
  do we really have the capacity to write a catch-all ? 
  well , it comes down to the audience . 
  i picture the smbc audience as essentially reddit . 
  and when i imagine reddit reading the comic , i do n't imagine them thinking , `` haha , i know it does n't really work like that , but that 's a funny one . '', 
  instead i think it 's much more likely that they 'll just run off to correct people with renewed glee , thinking they 've found a justification for prescriptivism . 
  that 's bad . 
   you 're seriously trying to tell me what i should find funny ? 
  that 's the worst sort of prescriptivism . 
  generally people agree enough on what is and is n't funny to confidently talk about it . 
  the only way i can think of * this * one being funny is if one really thought of linguistics in this way , and you enjoyed this as an informal ( and therefore funny ) description of it . 
  maybe there 's other ways , i dunno . 
  do n't get too offended if someone calls something you like unfunny , though -- it happens really often . 
   i do n't know why you act like you 're some `` true fan '' of smbc qualified to judge the content . 
  that 's a hyperbolic misunderstanding . 
  what i 'm saying is , i 've read enough smbc to gauge weiner 's tone .
