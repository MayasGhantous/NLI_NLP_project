  hey , i 've been here !, 
  ( or maybe at the good-natured knockoff in hajd\u00faszoboszl\u00f3 . 
  it 's exactly the same , down to the german signage . ), 
  nice to see it on here , i 'd completely forgotten about it . 
  you have to climb all the way to the top of the building to get to the entrance , and the slide does n't end anywhere near the base of its stairs , so repeat trips are slow . 
  we 've been able to save submissions for a long time . 
  comments are more recent ( although that was always available to gold and res users ) , but slut_nuggets was saving a submission, 
  brunei can not into country , malaysia make kill of brunei , crush like skull of pig, 
  remember to mark the comic as redditormade rather than berndmade !, 
  sure but snakes have those too . 
  a penis is more appropriate , but you ca n't rule out a good ol' snake, 
  what i do n't understand is people ever bothering with it for submissions ( ever since we got the ability to save them , which was before i created my account ) . 
  are there simply that many people who overlooked the save button , but are inventive enough to figure out a way to save it anyway ? 
  well , `` appropriation '' is constructively used to mean when you take elements from a culture that you do n't respect . 
  like munching tacos while yelling at guatemalan immigrants to go back to mexico . 
  the problem is , it 's subjective whether you respect a culture enough for it to not be appropriation . 
  i always figured `` ayyy '' was pronounced [ e\u026a\u02d0 ] . 
  and also pronounced `` lmao '' as [ ' \u025bl.ma\u028a ] or [ \u025bl . 
  ` ma\u028a ] , but knew nobody else did, 
  but v2 makes it vso , not sov . 
  subordinate clauses are sov though, 
  it would make a decent tricolor flag for reddit . 
  although then the brown in the middle should be substituted with white or something, 
  yeah , for some reason mens ' wallets are n't made to handle change . 
  it 's actually rather weird . 
   the problem is , it 's subjective whether you respect a culture enough for it to not be appropriation . 
  to be honest what `` they '' ^ ^ [ who ? ], 
  mean is kinda overboard though, 
  the sample size is relatively tiny , so there 's going to be a lot of variation . 
  i do n't know how many inspectors michelin sends , but they ca n't be many ( although their evaluations * are * pretty thorough ) . 
  even a * few thousand * people reviewing a restaurant does n't generate consistent results , although if michelin keeps using the same method for selecting reviewers , it can be a lot more consistent than just random selection . 
  and san pellegrino uses a board of just * 35 * members for the top 50 ( not sure about the top 100 ) , who are selected completely differently from the michelin reviewers . 
  it would be a small miracle if they coincided at all . 
  english dictionaries in america usually use some sort of homebrewed phonetic spelling systems rather than ipa , i 'm afraid . 
  while they mean something , they spit in the face of glorious ipa, 
  ... * two * folders ? 
  thanks for the heads up !, 
  i forgot about the paradox folder . 
  unfortunately , it still does n't work . 
  i should try reinstalling now, 
  well , besides the code-switching done in families that have one of them as an heritage language and the other as a country language , and besides what people who learn one language or the other as a second language speak , there 's probably a few creole languages that fit the bill . 
  suriname 's unofficial national language is [ sranan tongo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sranan_tongo ) , which mixes english and * dutch * with the many native languages . 
  unlike most `` english-based '' creoles , it is completely incomprehensible to english speakers , partly because of all the core dutch vocabulary . 
  also , papua new guinea had some german creoles , such as [ unserdeutsch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unserdeutsch_language ) , which presumably later hybridized with the english creoles in the area . 
  i do n't believe unserdeutsch itself has many english elements , though . 
  ( or had . 
  it went extinct recently . ), 
  edit : oh yeah , and there 's [ texas german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/texas_german ) and [ pennsylvania german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pennsylvania_german_language ) . 
  also in the other direction , [ pennsylvania dutch english ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pennsylvania_dutch_english ) which is really the closest thing to what you 're looking for . 
  and there was [ jersey dutch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jersey_dutch ) but we do n't know much about it . 
  there 's a variety of ways to detect them . 
  besides the gravitational way , you can also look at whether the star dims periodically from getting covered by the planet . 
  here , they observed the light of the star when it was covered by the planet , and divined the atmospheric data from the quantities of the different wavelengths of infrared light present . 
  oh boy , i 've fixed it . 
  - trying to email paradox led me to the support forums instead, 
  - the support forums told me that i should try the ` - skiplauncher ` flag, 
  - the ` -- skiplauncher ` flag ( with two dashes , mind you ) worked in console but not in steam, 
  - then i noticed that when it worked in the console , there were still mods i could select from, 
  - so i searched my entire hard drive for directories named ` mod `, 
  - and i found a * third * ` mod ` directory i was unaware of : ` / home/mszegedy / . local/share/paradox interactive/europa universalis iv/mod `, 
  - i deleted this , and it worked !, 
  dunno , i 've always wanted to read something written in textspeak . 
  every register of every language has literary merit . 
  but it should n't have any of this school-taught capitalization and punctuation bullshit !, 
  i want * basilectal * textspeak , using periods as modal particles and capitalization as a way to indicate tonality and volume !, 
  this belongs in / u/mildlyamusing, 
  ah , * that 's * why he looks hungarian . 
  mystery solved !, 
  i 've been testing out whether conquering , culture-converting , and religion-converting eastern europe as sapmi is feasible . 
  i was originally going to do it as perm , which may or may not be easier , but they 're not shamanist , so they 're kind of meh . 
  it may be possible to start as sapmi ( well , start as sweden , but you get the idea ) , annex perm , and then release them as a vassal and play as them , at which point they may or may not become shamanist . 
  this takes time though and might not be possible to do before they convert all their provinces . 
  ( heathen vassals do n't take your religion anymore , sadly . ), 
  you ? 
  they * did * use spectroscopy . 
  infrared spectroscopy . 
  i just was n't sure whether / u/i _ heart_snacks was familiar with it , so i described it instead . 
  i do n't know if they found titanium oxide specifically ; i did n't read that far into the paper . 
  yeah , but the regalia !, 
  i dunno , i 'm guessing they did n't try to separate them mechanically . 
  the paper only mentioned data analysis . 
  i think you 've got to know how the equipment actually works to figure out that bit . 
  they used [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wide_field_camera_3 ) camera , for what it 's worth . 
  edit : this is their description of their observations :, 
   two occultations of wasp-33 were observed on november 25 , 2012 and january 14 ,, 
  we used wfc3 's infrared g141 grism , which provides slitless spectra from 1.1 \u00b5m to, 
  1.7 \u00b5m at a resolving power of 130 ( dressel 2012 ) . 
  each target was allocated 5 hst orbits ,, 
  which was sufficient to cover a single planetary occultation while including periods of the, 
  orbit both before and after occultation . 
  well , calling charles belgian is kind of like calling george bush a californo-texan . 
  technically he originated from the region to which the demonym refers , but it does n't point to a unified culture . 
  you can call charles flemish instead . 
  i can personally attest that playing anyone in indochina is fun , especially champa ( who have a difficult starting position ) . 
  if you 're looking for an easier game , try taking over the indonesian archipelago as brunei . 
  in mainland asia , uniting the manchu hordes and then conquering korea and ming is always fun ; i usually do it with yeren , but haixi is the easiest choice . 
  ( the hardest choice is buryatia . 
  they 're tengri , though , so if you like spreading obscure religions , try it ! ), 
  if you want to play as a central asian horde , uzbek is the easiest ( besides the timurids ) , but if you want a really interesting game you can play as one of its released vassals , sibir or kazakh . 
  make sure to release the other vassal first before releasing yourself , though .
