  - genoa and venice have the best trade-related starting positions , but it 's not easy to expand as genoa , and venice has other problems ( e.g. 
  kebab and weisswurst , although you can probably ally the latter ) . 
  - england has the best potential within their own node . 
  if you conquer all the english channel land , you can make mad cash . 
  edit : as pointed out below , similarly for the dutch countries . 
  - kilwa and mutapa have the most interesting trade-related gameplay , because they can get to the rich zanzibar node early , and struggle to hold it for the rest of the game . 
  you can also turn the game into a pan-african conquest , if you 're brave enough . 
  you shoulda controlled for everyone 's rulers , if there 's an easy way to do that . 
  maybe polotsk and hungary just had a ton of surplus mana from having good rulers . 
  give everyone a permanent 3/3/3 . 
  of course , it should n't matter in the long run , since it 's a random process , but it 's more reliable that way . 
  ( what you ca n't stop is advisors . ), 
  go into the region mapmode . 
  achievement conditions usually relate to specific regions . 
  thank you for doing this , this is nice information to know . 
  hah , i mean conquest-based gameplay gets old sometimes . 
  that 's true . 
  that 's a better way of saying it . 
  edit : i forgot about the netherlands because they 're not available at the start . 
  whoops . 
  honestly black holes look pretty cool now , but once you get used to it it 's just like looking at stuff through your glass of water, 
  ottomans , because they 're easy . 
  i still kinda wan na play another game as ottomans . 
  the dirty thing is , if sapmi appears , they do n't automatically get cores on all sami provinces . 
  they have to be given those cores by rebels . 
  right , but if you play as them , you do n't have reconquest cb on anyone who holds provinces of sami culture , which is a shame . 
  i wish . 
  and somehow it still never manages to form bharat/hindustan . 
  probably started as tabarestan and formed persia later, 
   a single s is pronounced like english z. 
  this is an incomplete answer . 
  it can also be pronounced like english `` sh '' , such as in `` strasse '' , or like unvoiced english `` s '' , such as in `` lachs '' . 
  it is similar to english `` s '' in that regard , which can be pronounced like unvoiced `` s '' as in `` street '' , voiced `` s '' as in `` things '' , or voiced `` sh '' as in `` invasion '' . 
  even in orthographies that claim to be phonetic , everybody always forgets about allophony rules . 
  i speak hungarian , and everybody swears up and down that its orthography is phonetic ( if you treat the digraphs and trigraphs as single glyphs ) . 
  the truth is , the orthography will get you 95 % of the way there , but nobody will ever tell you that `` nj '' is actually pronounced the same as `` ny '' , or that `` gy '' and `` ty '' represent affricates rather than stops ( or , worse , stops + approximants ) , or that `` dt '' is typically pronounced the same as `` t '' or `` tt '' , or that in certain contexts `` h '' is pronounced the same as german `` ch '' , or that there is retrogressional voicing allophony on damn near everything so that `` sd '' is actually pronounced like `` zsd '' ... nobody ever notices any of that . 
  as a related problem , people often forget about syllabic stress , too . 
  i 've heard many speakers of many languages with contrastive stress claim that their orthography that does n't encode stress gives you the entire pronunciation of a word . 
  it 's not that easy to convert the province , since zoroastrianism subtracts 2 % from the local missionary strength . 
  hints , [ rot13 ] ( http://www.rot13.com/index.php ) 'd to avoid spoilers :, 
  hint 1 : v nz n bar cebivapr zvabe . 
  nope !, 
  i believe that 's the kurdish country of ardalan . 
  that 's so cool !, 
  [ my experience with h\u03b1 ] ( http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/36900000/pink-colour-pink-color-36912356-2560-1440.jpg ), 
  it was a really tiny telescope , though , so ymmv . 
  that is a good guess . 
  although stranger things have happened to muscovy this patch ; frequently , some random opm like nn or perm conquers the whole thing . 
  this is the first time i 've seen bashkortostan , though . 
  if it were easy , then ... it would be easy . 
  this is a hard one , and i think that is fine . 
  although , there are definite , rather large clues , so it 's not impossible , either . 
  communismrules123 noticed , probably without even looking at the hints . 
  f10 and nope . 
  good guess but nope . 
  they 're doing very well , though -- at least , they * were * until they got inherited by blobhemia in 1480 . 
  ( you got the time almost right , though . ), 
  the date is correct , but i am not in germany at all . 
  if i were , guessing would be basically impossible . 
  no , very good guess though !, 
  i 'm in the region . 
  welp , i might be ending this prematurely , but i 've got ta sleep . 
  the answer is ... ( rot13 'd ), 
  yes , to begii annexation . 
  [ no , ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/3aof1z/when_is_it_who_am_i_and_what_am_i_doing/csekljr ) but they * are * doing really well , are n't they ? 
  the hammer is spectral , therefore it passes through jeff , just like the ghosts . 
  but ... it 's portuguese that does n't have the sound change [ f ] -  [ h ] -  ( nothing ) before back vowels !, 
  spanish has `` hacer '' , while portuguese has `` fazer '' . 
  well , saying that it 's `` primarily to blame on the africans '' is short-sighted . 
  they would n't be in this situation if not for contact with the colonial powers , especially because most modern african states descend from colonial states . 
  if they were to descend from the original african states , with the borders drawn along ethnic lines and the government being one that was n't installed 10 years ago by some rebels , then africa would be a lot less of a poor shithole . 
  ( although you ca n't do much about local beliefs . 
  those do n't change overnight , not even if you randomly impose an education system with a western curriculum . ), 
  well that 's not very true . 
  languages are rarely truly closer to an ancestor than one another , and people often end up looking at only phonology or only grammar or only vocabulary and concluding that one language has n't changed as much just because there have been fewer changes in that area . 
  portuguese , while not having the [ f ] -  [ h ] sound change and a couple other consonant sound changes spanish has , does have a variety of vowel sound changes specific to it , most famously the [ a : nu  -  [ a : no ] -  [ \u00e3w ] \\ ( pardon my poor ipa , the [ u  and [ w ] should be nasalized ) sound change , and the strange ( [ \u025bw ] and other sequences ) -  ( near close near back unrounded vowel ) change , among many others . 
  it is about the same in terms of vocabulary ; the loanwords and contracted prepositions present in spanish are typically also present in portuguese , although portuguese has the additional hilarity of shuffling around its pronoun system ( which is usually the most conservative part of a language 's vocabulary ) , with `` voc\u00ea '' recently becoming the 2nd person singular pronoun of choice in brazil , and the possessive pronouns changing meanings , with `` seu '' becoming 2nd person and `` dele '' replacing it . 
  the grammar 's also about the same , although i find it funny that portuguese innovated a conjugated infinitive ; my first language , hungarian , also has one . 
  i do n't understand why you 're getting downvoted . 
  why waste money ? 
  i think they were asking about why it 's possible to wc with anything in 1.11 . 
  more importantly , in 1.12, 
  not really . 
  it 's not shared with any other pieces of music . 
  mine is east timor , so yes, 
  yes , surely the independence movement was collectively envisioned by 100 % of the population of each state , and not carried out by an armed , rich minority hungry for power ... 
  that 's a good definition . 
  did `` pink cat '' ever appear anywhere ? 
  but bordeaux is a color too, 
  shh do n't tell anyone , you 'll ruin my perm aar, 
  at least the middle east is historical . 
  no , wait , what 's that blue thing where najd is supposed to be ? 
  is that ... is that * qara qoyunlu ? 
  there 's actually [ an official manual . 
  ] ( http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/236850/manuals/europauniversalisiv_manual_english.pdf?t=1410804554 ) it 's pretty helpful . 
  `` most numbers have the digit 9 in them somewhere . '', 
  officially no . 
  in practice , it depends on the house rules . 
  edit : what do you people have against house rules ? 
  in generalized american , they 're supposed to be the same sound .
