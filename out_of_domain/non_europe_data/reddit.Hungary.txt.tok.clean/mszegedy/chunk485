  in dialects where they contrast , the word written with an o is usually supposed to be pronounced with [ \u0254 ] , which is fairly different from [ \u0251 ] and is not present in generalized american . 
  my problem is with [ \u00e6 ] , [ \u026a ] , [ \u025b ] , and [ e ] . 
  when i try to say short [ \u00e6 ] or [ \u026a ] , it always sounds like [ \u025b ] , and when i try to say short [ e ] , it always sounds like [ \u026a ] or [ \u025b ] . 
  in english , to preserve the distinction , i have resorted to extending the vowels , which makes it clear which one i 'm using , but makes it sound like i have a `` southern drawl '' . 
  at least i have [ \u025b ] down . 
  ( english does n't have short [ e ] though . 
  these vowels mainly cause me trouble in finnish and russian . ), 
  paprika , garlic powder , bitter cocoa powder . 
  i 'm not sure if vassal income in general works . 
  often i get no vassal income , for no discernible reason ( i.e. 
  they 're neither marches nor disloyal ) . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  of course they 're not open to interpretation . 
  that 's not what house rules are . 
  house rules are just ... rules , which the house makes . 
  since people complain about this rule , sometimes it 's house-ruled out . 
  * swimming to the bottom ? 
  * your poor face ... and eyes ... and neck ... and , well , everything ... 
  vic players hate that for some reason , they think it 's too gamey, 
  citation needed ? 
   i 'd even say that there are dialects of modern norwegian which i would have a harder time with !, 
  such as danish ( zing ! ), 
  japan was on that list !, 
  do n't forget the weeaboos . 
  or actual japanese people . 
  the only thing wrong with it is you probably do n't have that much inflation yet, 
  now sell some stuff to genoa, 
  that 's true . 
  people usually ask about the latter . 
  i meant when you usually play ayutthaya . 
  i know when i played it , i never needed the inflation reduction . 
  hooray , sapmi gets some , for a game specifically oriented around converting everyone to shamanism !, 
  i do n't object !, 
  i just do n't know much about it as a sub , and i do n't have much faith in large subs , but if you think the question would go over well with them , be my guest . 
  big hungry neighbor ? 
  you called ? 
  there 's also various stab cost modifiers that can make it much higher , some of which come from buddhist events and are thus relevant to ayutthaya,

  you were smarter when you were part of our kingdom, 
  the radio show just said `` fuck '', 
  but ... nobody cares * except * rms . 
  well the * old * prussians were harmless baltic folk . 
  the * teutons * , on the other hand , were dangerous bloodthirsty germans . 
  tongue-twisters are the best . 
  in hungarian we also have a variety of food-centric ones , such as this one which discusses the botany of wild cherries :, 
  soundalike phrases are often humorous . 
  i do n't see what 's not funny about melting jet fuel . 
  if anything , the fact that it 's illogical makes it funnier . 
  the comment in question is wittier than half the `` funny '' comments on reddit . 
  was gon na post it too . 
  the explanation is actually pretty good , too . 
  except ms paint, 
  huh , kinda like how hungarians are secretly turkic in origin but call themselves uralic, 
  most people would call all of these bugs, 
  like an aquarium, 
  \\  you are golden horde, 
  even if you did n't directly have a hand in this , there is no way you did n't influence this somehow . 
  exactly, 
  technically yes . 
  now , tagalog on the other hand ... 
  [ the slightly less unnecessary but great deal shittier ( due to technical difficulties ) hungarian translation ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jxxg3qn.jpg ), 
  60 % of the philippines speaks english ; it 's practically diglossia ( or triglossia , when a region speaks their native language , filipino , * and * english concurrently ) . 
  on the other hand , the only country in europe with a smaller proportion of english speakers than hungary , who has 20 % , is turkey , with 19 % . 
  you do n't find many tagalog-language resources on the internet for precisely this reason ; while there 's some resources for learners , there 's a much smaller body of native-language media than you 'd typically find for a language , since most of the media everyone consumes is just in english . 
  out of the [ 9 highest-grossing films in the philippines , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_highest-grossing_films_in_the_philippines ) 6 were american films in english , and you can bet they were neither dubbed nor subtitled . 
  also , * it takes a man and a woman * code-switched frequently between english and filipino . 
  i am not sure about the other two , since i have n't seen them . 
  in hungary we have the opposite `` problem '' . 
  every single piece of foreign media gets dubbed into hungarian , even things like looney tunes cartoons . 
  as such , learning english is frequently seen as unnecessary . 
  it 's more than just that !, 
  are there any parts of filipino at all that are taken from philippine languages other tagalog ? 
  whereas r does , although in conventional orthography it is paired with `` i '' or `` e '' ( when it is paired with back vowels , it is pronounced as an approximant ) . 
  oh , oh , it 's a click system , i know this !, 
  ( however , modern-day hungarians are turkic in origin , like the bulgars . ), 
  but that 's what dave said in this update , that bro thought that his shitty parenting would toughen dave up . 
  but apparently it did n't , according to him . 
  you can say it in / r/motorcycles . 
  now , / r/calamariraceteam ... 
  i 've seen the movie mentioned tons of times , but never this joke . 
  it sure is funny when you 're not expecting it, 
  it was terrible , but i think it could have been a whole lot better if the casting were decent and the special fx budget were bigger . 
  the script was n't actually that bad , and i personally like the idea of firebending needing a source like the other 3 elements . 
  chinese masterrace, 
   seems to me invading russia is even more horrible now . 
  if there are good forts in the area , siege them with an enormous stack because fort mechanics , with fort attrition , shitty russian region supply in winter ? 
  manpower relying armies are not gon na make it . 
  it was never the russian doomstacks of straw that was the problem , but the crippling attrition . 
  the canonical solution is to use mercenaries . 
  the reinforcement costs are minimal if you 've raised war taxes . 
   old as fuck, 
  you do n't say :p, 
  sadly paraguay is too proud for mercs, 
  more like, 
   ... is requesting that you come to their aid in the multiple conflicts they are engaged in against france , burgundy , austria , portugal , ming , mughal , alsace , sweden , aragon , and ulm . 
  france is allied with netherlands , castile , and england . 
  burgundy is allied with netherlands , provence , savoy , and denmark . 
  austria is allied with hungary , brandenburg , saxony , commonwealth , venice , and the ottomans . 
  portugal is allied with castile , navarra , and scotland . 
  ming is allied with manchu and oirat .
