   if we decline this call to arms , we will lose 25 prestige . 
  there 's plenty mechanics independent of mana though . 
  such as trade and colonization ( once you have a colonist , anyway ) . 
  also hiring advisors costs money only . 
  but i do agree we need more power pools , because it feels rather fudged right now . 
  or france, 
  the only way that i can see it being remotely understandable is if they want the names in german . 
  after all , it 's kinda hard to recognize that `` cologne '' and `` k\u00f6ln '' are the same thing , as are `` gda\u0144sk '' and `` danzig '' . 
  but wanting it in norwegian ? 
  how picky, 
  delete all of your mods . 
  what kind of computer do you have ? 
  on linux they 're stored in * three * places . 
  you do n't get a one-time hit for releasing them . 
  instead , the more princes are in the hre , the faster your ia accumulates . 
  m in qwerty is m in dvorak . 
  that and a are the only two letter keys that stay the same . 
  w is directly to the right of m , and she is definitely not hitting that . 
  diaspora communities eventually lose their language to the prestige language . 
  see the decline of texas german , for example . 
  the jao is neither jewish nor yiddish-speaking . 
  less than 1 % of its population is ethnically jewish , and less than 2,000 people there practice judaism . 
  and the entirety of russia contains slightly more than 1,500 yiddish speakers , presumably partially concentrated in the jao . 
  yes , but the guy / u/xlee145 was replying to was implicitly proposing to rename that stage of english to it . 
  i agree . 
  if she thinks yelling at herself is fair play , then she 's free to do it . 
  she 's the one who knows how to talk to herself , after all . 
  this is between herself and herself , and no one else . 
  the only wrinkle is that ( vriska ) is n't really her . 
  they 've diverged enough that they 're different people in most ways that matter . 
  but vriska has n't figured that out yet . 
  and even if she does , that probably wo n't stop her from talking to her like that . 
  that sounds like it should be permissible . 
  if one of my students wrote `` byelok '' instead of `` protein '' , or `` evoluci\u00f3n '' instead of `` evolution '' , i would not mark them down ( although i 'd question the latter student 's lack of ability to find simple , consistent correspondences between english and spanish vocabulary ) . 
  ( note : if they wrote `` white '' instead of `` protein '' , though , i 'd mark them down unless they talked to me about it and reassured me that they meant the right thing . ), 
  but the student was only asked to enumerate states in this case , not give in-depth summaries . 
  and it 's not like they need to know these states for the future ; they can safely forget these names after the test . 
  what 's more is , other than for large , important states like saxony or bavaria , the names are the same or very similar . 
  ( now i 'm curious . 
  what 's holstein called in norwegian ? ), 
  edit : huh , even in bokm\u00e5l , it 's `` holstein '' , whereas in danish it 's `` holsten '' . 
  i guess bokm\u00e5l is different from danish after all . 
  to start with , do n't make it a circle . 
  people are terrible at estimating ( even the relative ) sizes of circles , never mind the weird arbitrarily-shaped pieces of it . 
  make it a stacked bar chart , or something . 
  they 're really not . 
  determining whether two languages are separate things is a tediously arbitrary exercise . 
  there are languages with mutually unintelligible dialects , such as german , hindustani , and arabic . 
  there are pairs of languages that are considered separate but are highly mutually intelligible , such as norwegian and danish . 
  there are creole languages that are difficult to separate from their vocabulary base , and form a continuum across social strata , such as singlish . 
  there are languages inconsistently classified as dialects or separate languages , such as serbo-croato-bosnian or whatever it 's called these days , or the entire family of chinese languages . 
  there are language families that form a really neat but really wide dialect continuum , subsets of which we treat as different languages , such as the family of inuit languages . 
  language-ness is very relative . 
  this makes it hard to create diagrams based on them , because we 're not sure whether we need to write just `` arabic '' or also write `` moroccan arabic '' , `` egyptian arabic '' , and `` lebanese arabic '' . 
  as an example here , people disagree with whoever made the above diagram 's segmentation of the chinese languages ( namely , none at all ) . 
  there are ways to get around this , such as dividing up the population into units of 1 million people or so and coloring them so that more differently-colored units can understand each other less well , or using your own semi-arbitrary divisions but indicating homogeneity on them somehow , but it 's not a great position to be in , trying to diagram it . 
  colemak is rather similar to qwerty , though , so that 's relatively unsurprising, 
  that 's smart .

  wow , from the title it looked like you were trying to say `` victory '' in some obscure mon-khmer language . 
  that sounds like a good title for an aar , now ...
