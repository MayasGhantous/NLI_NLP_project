  or younger and meaner, 
  that 's france, 
   ( not 4chan , if you 're offended by 4chan then you do n't understand what 4chan is ), 
  ) teens ? 
  who 's that ? 
  huh . 
  i saw that movie , too , i feel dumb for not recognizing him now . 
  that 's amazing . 
  i approve of this, 
  hungary 's accurate too, 
  you can always tell because everyone always writes `` you motherfucker '' or something after it . 
  `` that 's arabic . 
  no idea what it means though '', 
  we had a lot of forts known as `` v\u00e9gv\u00e1r `` s ( `` end forts '' ) scattered across the country in this time period . 
  they were to protect against kebab . 
  are n't adjectives postpositioned in polish , so that this would be `` bratanki dwa '' ? 
  but , numbers are adjectives , at least when you 're using them distributively ( `` kett\u0151 '' is not an adjective , but `` k\u00e9t '' is ) . 
  to say `` two hundred years '' , you write `` lat dwie\u015bcie '' in polish , so it 's interesting that `` dwa '' goes in front here . 
  there must be some sort of exception for small numbers . 
  i have an irrational dislike for `` i feel like '' . 
  i ca n't explain it . 
  but anyway you * should * just say your opinions without needing to add a qualifier . 
  real opinions do n't feel like opinions , they feel like fact , like the way the world is . 
  you need to find the distinction and convey it . 
  if someone disagrees with your model of the world , then they can say so . 
  it just makes me so mad how badly they butcher it . 
  i ca n't even understand most of it . 
  they 're usually pretty underwhelming . 
  most evidentials i have experience with are basically equivalent to `` supposedly '' or `` they say '' , which is vague enough to get flagged on wikipedia at least . 
  then there 's also the ones that are equivalent to `` i saw '' or `` i heard '' , which are like two or three syllables in english anyway . 
  word order in latin was very , very free ( although in practice it tended to only be so varied in poetry ) . 
  i 'd be surprised if any australian language had more free word order , although i can imagine adpositions being more so . 
  hmm very weird . 
  one of the prevailing pieces of common knowledge about polish grammar is postpositioned adjectives : `` dzie\u0144 dobry '' , not `` dobry dzie\u0144 '' . 
  i dunno the rules then . 
  the adjectives do have to agree with the nouns in gender and number , so maybe you can put it on either side , like in latin . 
  ah i was n't using the term technically :p i meant that you should n't need to qualify your statements with `` in my opinion '' etc, 
  although i do n't think any company would bother advertising in a tiny sub like this , much less in an actually hip manner, 
  an interesting * optional * feature, 
  right , i 'm not disputing that . 
  i 'm saying you should n't feel obligated to use it . 
  when you have an opinion you really believe , then it does n't feel like an opinion , it feels like fact . 
  omitting `` imo '' or `` i feel like '' forces you to think critically about whether you truly believe what you 're saying . 
  ( politicians get a free pass , of course . ), 
  wait , i know what 's confusing us . 
  i meant `` you '' as in general `` you '' , as in `` az ember '' , as in `` one '' . 
  i do n't have a problem with you specifically , lol . 
  i know !, 
  but the post itself seemed / r/hailcorporate-y, 
  to make sword mana useful . 
  also , to put sword mana as an abstraction for your country 's military capability to use . 
  - enough amino acids to be useful , but not so many that it would be hard to find the right sequence via evolution, 
  - fixed word size , which is easy to process, 
  - words of such size and variety that lots of combinations mean the same thing ( so that one mutation does n't necessarily kill a gene ) , but no letter/position is totally redundant, 
  - as small an alphabet as possible to make the above happen , so that it 's easy to read, 
  jc that 's detailed . 
  i love it, 
  is ... this ... good news ? 
  since the captured towns are at least liberated ? 
  [ more elaborate source ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/paraglider-cheats-death-in-thunderstorm/ ), 
  put a backslash before the period , otherwise reddit interprets your comment as the first item in a numbered list ( regardless of the fact that it starts with 40 ), 
  ancient anatolians are hittites . 
  the term you want is `` the bloodthirsty turk '' . 
  you could always just * make * them explode by taking espionage ideas and using `` sow discontent '' on them . 
  that seems like it 's specifically a function geared towards making ming explode now , since it attacks its legitimacy ( which makes it eventually lose the mandate of heaven ) , and gives it +5 unrest ( which cancels out the effect of having the mandate of heaven ) . 
  edit : ah , it seems `` sow discontent '' only gives +3, 
  more like just poor critical thinking skills . 
  but fbaguy is probably actually very decent at critical thinking and just had a lapse here, 
  technically you could do this to any word ( as long as the numbers are in english ) , since the length of any word is a number, 
  was this because he did n't trust anyone else to run the us ? 
  this is a hard question ; most songs are not in english . 
  [ `` t\u00e4\u00e4ll\u00e4 pohjant\u00e4hden alla '' by petri laaksonen ] ( https://youtu.be/qzxgdy8et30 ) is pretty good , although you can find many similar choral songs ( some in english even ) . 
  this one is special to me though , since it is sung in a language just barely close enough to mine to sound familiar ( and to be intuitively intelligible once you have learned the meanings and grammars of the words ) , as well as one with a small enough amount of consonants to be ridiculously melodic . 
  it is named after an eponymous trilogy , which chronicles the life of a finnish family throughout the first half of the 20th century , and is said to capture the finnish spirit very well . 
  both the book and the song are very well-known . 
  how am i supposed to pronounce that anyway ? 
  and here we see it in the wild , a phenomenon almost completely unknown to english : reduplicating to pluralize, 
  how do you switch gov type with bankruptcy ? 
  no but seriously, 
  and apparently the pagan religions will work like that now , too, 
  i mean pretty much all religions are wrong but theres wrong and then theres wrong, 
  as in zero chance you are ever proven right about even a single thing dude , ever ever ever, 
  unfortunately there 's still not enough carbon to build buildings out of , though ( other than the small percentage of co2 that comprises most building materials ), 
   it turns out that what seemed to be the most promising one initially ( centrifugation ) was actually not very feasible with the technology of the time ( and would not be until around the 1960s or so ), 
  what made it feasible later on ? 
  gravitational lensing . 
  i get the same effect every morning in my glass of water . 
  and the reddit administration, 
  yes this is yuralic, 
  oh , but that 's only post 1750 is n't it, 
  fuck my stove is also from 50s america but it sucks really hard . 
  i 'd complain that it 's a fire hazard but i do n't think it even gets hot enough to be one . 
  this one looks really nice ( and properly insulated ), 
  this is how you tell apart americans from brits . 
  the americans will quote forrest gump , while the brits will quote monty python ( ? 
  i deliberately said `` quote '' in a pejorative fashion , as i hold that it 's about as original and funny as quoting . 
  the comment that started this thread was asking about eu4 ; it 's okay , i missed it too, 
  unify islam !,

  seriously , this campaign is almost suspiciously bad .
