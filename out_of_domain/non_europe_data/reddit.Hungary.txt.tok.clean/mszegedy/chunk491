  an actually hungarian would never give hungary the trianon borders , that 's the point, 
  homestuck taught me the difference between violent j and guy fieri . 
  sadly it does n't incorporate smash mouth guy as far as i 'm aware, 
  but where 's your degree in the dunning-kruger effect , huh ? 
  i wonder where people get the idea that aradia 's supposed to be curvy . 
  that would avert every `` ghost '' stereotype ever . 
  ( i 'm not one to say whether she is , but i still find it unlikely . ), 
  we can infer stuff about their relationship based on nanna 's and grandpa 's relationships with her . 
  nanna did n't like her , so `` poppop '' probably did n't either . 
  i do n't know , is she fat enough to qualify as fat ? 
  i think it 's just vibrating really fast ? 
  what 's important about this is that it might happen * in vivo * and produce proteins we have n't considered yet . 
  probably helps justify their exorbitant rates, 
  is this just poorly-labeled gis data ? 
  not every language and not every phrase works on propositional logic . 
  standard american english does n't have compulsory multiple negatives , so that 's fine . 
  but `` do n't you '' does something other than negating a sentence , which messed you up . 
  `` do n't you wish for me to repeat ? '', 
  and `` do you wish for me to repeat ? '', 
  are both answered with `` no , i do not , '' if you do n't want them to repeat , so it does n't negate . 
  the sentence has 4 actual negatives in it , which all stack with each other , making the final result positive . 
  link should answer , `` no . '', 
  ( this is when prescriptivists start to whine , `` that 's so illoooogical !, 
  languages without compulsory multiple negatives are objectively better than languages with compulsory multiple negatives because they mesh with propositional logic better ! '', 
  these people are completely wrong . 
  languages often repeat speech elements in order to make sure they are understood , and negating elements are n't any different . 
  people who complain that it 's `` illogical '' are making the mistake of analyzing the negating word ( s ) as a boolean negator , rather than a word that obeys its own rules . ), 
  ( as a side note , `` do n't you '' used for assurance is n't an example of repeating elements for understanding ; it 's just a construction that does n't sound like it makes sense anymore due to english losing the `` yea/yes '' and `` nay/no '' distinction , where you 'd use `` yea '' to affirm a positive , and `` yes '' to contradict a negative , like `` ja '' vs `` doch '' in german or `` igen '' vs `` de '' in hungarian . 
  `` yea '' and `` yes '' merged , and now `` do n't you '' looks confusing when picked apart . 
  if you want the distinction again , i vote `` but yes '' or `` but '' as the new phrase to contradict a negative . ), 
  it 's a joke, 
  pretty sure that he was a character in * the poisoner 's handbook * as a result, 
  just say no to walls of text in video games !, 
  you have n't met the authors of some of my textbooks . 
  they use parenthetical statements * three paragraphs long , regularly . 
  * guess how often they forget a parenthesis ? 
  it 's a little unnecessary imo . 
  the information is already contained in the question ; having a 3 - or 4-form system would be redundant . 
  and while redundancy helps clear communication , as a regular speaker of hungarian , which has a 3-form system , you 'd be surprised at how never the redundancy helps . 
  maybe he changed the name, 
   ( i also do recognize the purpose of parentheses as being a side comment or explanation/extension of the main comment or main ` thread ' of the context of the text , but this is reddit brah , not that professional textbook . 
  i use correct grammar and spelling and punctuation in my texts to friends cause i 'm neurotic/anxious like that but you do n't need to emulate an educational book in terms of conventions on a reddit post ), 
  i use whatever seems to get the point across . 
  in this case , showing that the second two paragraphs are less important than the first was necessary , and parentheses do the trick . 
  \\  thread about figuring out the world is n't a safe place, 
  \\  replies with example about papua new guinea, 
  you 'd think you 'd have figured it out earlier, 
   ( also did you even get my joke i could n't tell ), 
  ( of course i did :p ), 
  aww , cheer up !, 
  we 've met over the internet , that 's something , is n't it ? 
  if it makes you feel any better , there probably is n't a language with a 3 - or 4-form system that 's had it since the beginning of time ; certainly in german and hungarian the word is very obviously just derived from the word for `` but '' , and latin did n't have a 3-form system , so french had to innovate it at some point . 
  so english can ( re ) acquire it at some point in the future if it wants ( and then lose it again , etc ) . 
  i tried to find a creole or dialect of english for you that already has it , but if any have it then it 's not well-documented . 
  that one 's understandable though . 
  she 's royalty after all . 
  sure , but textbooks can be several hundred pages long . 
  the one i 'm thinking of is around 550 ( over 600 if you count the preface and title pages ) , a comprehensive writeup of the grammar of tagalog compiled in a joint effort by ucla and philippine normal college . 
  i understand that big books are hard to typeset , but i 've found tens of typography errors , mostly involving parentheses except for [ this one particularly horrible error ] ( https://books.google.hu/books?id=e8tapluny94c&amp;lpg=pa338&amp;dq=nagoaoabiid&amp;pg=pa338#v=onepage&amp;q=nagoaoabiid&amp;f=false ) where the typist 's entire right hand shifted a key left for an entire word , causing `` magpapanood '' to become `` nagoaoabiid '' . 
  i fantasize about collecting these typography errors , and ransoming them to the publishers in exchange for them telling me where the section about participles and gerunds is located . 
  my sole aim is to destroy the untied states of gramerica, 
  so , play the long con ? 
  but i aim to conquer and convert all the way down to hungary , so i ca n't wait too long . 
  but i need to convert to shamanism before growing . 
  since when is taking jokey sayings literally humor ?

  how could you leave that out of the title ? 
  `` hi , are you poland ? '', 
  `` tak '', 
  no , i got the joke . 
  it 's not funny . 
  that ... does n't usually work, 
  also , i believe it was dickrhino who once made [ this simple shading tutorial . 
  yes , everyone who grew up in the eastern bloc and went to school learned it in school . 
  most people forgot it straight afterwards though . 
   it 's what people do to them in preparation, 
  wait , what specifically are you talking about ? 
  chips ? 
  if you have any other questions , just ask at / r/polandballarena, 
  sorry , i meant fries . 
  most of the time i 've had potato , especially with steak , it 's been baked , boiled , or mashed , so i was wondering what 's wrong with that . 
  have you got a higher resolution picture ? 
  it must be beautiful up close !, 
  edit : also , you 're apparently jordan montgomery ( or a liar ), 
  because of the shitty 3 key on my house phone , i often accidentally dial random people in metro manila when i mean to dial people in hungary . 
  i have learned basic tagalog to compensate . 
  inb4 someone cluelessly announces that `` arigato '' and `` obrigado '' are cognates, 
  between vowels , english `` dd '' / `` tt '' ( and sometimes `` d '' and `` t '' , depending on your dialect ) are pronounced exactly like spanish `` r '' ( but not `` rr '' ) . 
  spanish 's vowels are relatively weird . 
  they do / e / and / o / wrong . 
  well , vaguely anyway . 
  in eastern europe we say , `` your whore mother '' / `` your mother 's a whore '' , which does n't resemble the american `` i fucked your mom '' very closely . 
  if the only criterion is that the guy 's mother is involved in the insult , then it 's a pretty obvious conclusion that most cultures have an insult involving one 's mother ( and maybe sex ) . 
  landline, 
  i 've always wondered whether it was the slavic languages that loaned `` ikra '' from japanese , or the other way around . 
  i guess it makes sense that it would be the other way around . 
  yes , especially in portugal people will gleefully tell you about it, 
  at ikaw ?
