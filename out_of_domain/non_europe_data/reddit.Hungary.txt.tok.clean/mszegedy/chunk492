  i tried to figure out what construction is `` besides that '' , but i could n't . 
  ( in hungarian , we use the equivalent of `` ganoon '' , or a phrase that literally translated means `` sa iba '' . ), 
  for the record , how ? 
  well , `` wrong '' in the tongue in cheek sense . 
  spanish 's equivalents of / e / and / o / are a lot further away from them than the majority of languages ' . 
  what really makes it different from other , more straightforward phonologies , though , is the frication of most of its former stops . 
  that 's unusual , even among iberian languages . 
  sorry , i thought it was a dialectal variation . 
  :p i know how you feel , it is rather annoying for me too . 
  even email is pretty meh . 
  face-to-face or bust . 
  blah , `` bukod '' was in my grammar textbook , i should have remembered it . 
  although i distinctly remember it as a preposition , `` bukod sa '' . 
  you meant to write `` bukod din '' , right ? 
  since your here , could you please tell me how to form participles ? 
  especially complex phrases with them , e.g. , `` speaking a little czech , she 'd smile nicely '' . 
  i understand `` she 'd smile nicely '' is something to the effect of `` ngumingiti sana siya mabait '' or perhaps `` ngumingiti sana siya maganda '' , but i 'm lost as to how to do the initial phrase . 
  if you 're smart you twist around backwards . 
  there 's always light coming from the front of the car , usually from the tail lights of the car in front of you . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  i 've managed to accidentally switch to polish in the middle of a sentence when speaking czech , but how do you switch from spanish to japanese just because they have vaguely similar vowel systems ? 
  yeah i checked , it goes all the way back to pie , which had the remarkably similar '' * ik\u02b7 ( e ) r '' . 
  cognate to english `` roe '' . 
  cool !, 
  wait , present-contrary-to-fact clauses are n't formed with `` sana '' ? 
  everything i know is a lie :(, 
  so , `` dun '' is a contraction of `` doon '' ? 
  the `` upside-down '' strings are really just a bunch of ipa characters . 
  you should just test for the entirety of ipa instead . 
  it 's probably that ulm nerf mod, 
  yes , but :, 
   at a time when regional cultures fought over the rule . 
  sort of . 
  but at the time when the mongols invaded , [ half of china was conquered by the manchu . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jin%e2%80%93song_wars ), 
  a dictatorship ? 
  who calls it that ? 
  who would be the dictator ? 
  thank you !, 
  yes , a e i o u are romanized the same , but they 're not the same vowels . 
  ( although they 're pretty close . 
  the only one japanese does differently is `` u '' . ), 
  and japanese has phonemic vowel length ( and diphthongs ? 
  i do n't know much about japanese vowels ) , whereas spanish is syllable-timed . 
  image macros , but they 're commonly just called `` memes '', 
  nope , we 're apes . 
  monkeys have tails . 
  come to hungary , we have tons of very well-preserved loans from latin . 
  to say `` of course '' , we say `` persze '' , which comes from `` per se igitur '' , meaning `` it is understood through itself '' in latin . 
  ( `` sz '' is just pronounced like `` s '' in `` fast '' ; i 'll leave the rest to your imagination ), 
  france looks weak, 
  [ that pattern ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/titius%e2%80%93bode_law ) is discredited . 
  i ca n't find evidence of a ban on the internet , so maybe it 's just an urban legend . 
  \u00e6 does n't work . 
  it 's pronounced like `` a '' in `` hat '' . 
  `` somethng lack thiss '', 
  word of mouth in the northeast has it that it 's banned . 
  it probably is n't actually , now that i 've spent an hour googling it . 
  i got it from the butcher closest to my house . 
  it 's called `` b\u00e9lsz\u00edn '' ( `` gut color '' ) !, 
  you can say `` b\u00e9lsz\u00ednt k\u00e9rek '' or `` legyen sz\u00edves b\u00e9lsz\u00ednt adni '' ( the first \u00ed is pronounced short ) . 
  full disclosure : i 'm not sure if it is translated to english with `` tenderloin '' or `` sirloin '' ; american cuts are somewhat different than hungarian ones . 
  why did you move to hungary ? 
  hungarians love to feel oppressed . 
  in danish , norwegian , and ipa ( and some minor languages with danish-derived or ipa-derived orthography ) , you pronounce it as `` a '' in `` hat '' . 
  in danish and norwegian , it is the equivalent of swedish '' \u00e4 '' . 
  icelandic has both \u00e6 and \u00e4 ? 
  sure is !, 
  i see !, 
  ( whoa , deja vu ) come to miskolc sometime . 
  i occasionally make appearances at f\u00f6ldes gimn\u00e1zium as a native english speaker , and the kids are very impressed . 
  we 're seriously behind in english education in hungary . 
  meh , in the us , they teach kids spanish for years and the only people who retain anything meaningful are the ones who study it through high school . 
  it 's probably just a matter of caring . 
  ( unless by 1-4 you mean high school 1-4 . 
  that * is * weird . ), 
  yup , but it 's a given name initial plus a surname , so more like em-segedy, 
  superman does n't get many comics in smbc . 
  this is the only really good one . 
  the rest are kind of corny . 
  i 'd rank them :, 
  god, 
  random philosophical kid, 
  there are few characters in smbc with a completely consistent identity , though . 
  there 's god , some superheroes , and a couple historical figures . 
  god 's the only one with a lot of comics as far as i remember . 
  latin 's sister language ? 
  greek is a language isolate within the indo-european family , belonging to its own family , hellenic . 
  latin and greek are about as related to each other as english and latin ( or english and greek ) . 
  they did end up with some half-coincidental grammatical similarities though . 
  ( half-coincidental instead of completely coincidental because , well , they * are * both indo-european . ), 
  if anything 's a sister language to greek , it 's tsakonian , but not everyone considers it a separate language . 
  latin also eventually became the only member of the italic family ; there were others , like umbrian , but they died out . 
  that 's not to say that there 's not historical reasons to consider them `` friends '' or anything , in the sense that they often appear together . 
  latin loaned a lot of words from greek , even up until the 10th century ad ( today 's featured wikipedia article is [ hermeneutic style latin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hermeneutic_style ) ) , and the byzantine empire 's two official languages were greek and latin . 
  but they 're not closely related or anything . 
  huh , it received an update, 
  i meant comics where he 's the main character . 
  that one is n't made great by the characterization of superman ; it 's made great by the characterization of the male kid . 
  to be fair , i did forget about this one .
