  it means `` upper shelf '' , but i think what he was going for was `` upper police '' ( which btw would be `` horn\u00ed policie '' ) . 
  in other words it 's probably a pun . 
  the rest of them only use umlauts or \u00e6\u00f8\u00e5,

  some stereotypes are more true than others . 
  the teeth one is nonsense , at the very least nowadays . 
  the fat one is true . 
  the alcoholism one is true-ish . 
  just because it 's a stereotype does n't mean that you need to believe it applies broadly . 
  the person you were replying to knew that . 
   when the wind is hard ( can you say that in english ? ), 
  nah , in english wind is strong , not hard ; `` when the wind is strong '' , `` when there 's strong winds '' . 
  but `` hard '' is also an adverb , so you can say , `` when the wind is blowing hard '' .

  thanks !, 
  so this makes avocado sauce `` ahuaca-mole '' , ~ ~ with the latter part being a spanish loan . ~ ~ interesting . 
  i just wonder how the spanish got `` vo '' from `` hua '' in `` avocado '' ; usually nobody is * this * bad at loaning words . 
  edit : no , wait , `` mole '' was loaned into spanish from classical nahuatl , not the other way around . 
  that 's hilarious , i thought for sure it would have come from latin `` mollis '' ( `` soft '' ) . 
  so the actual word is `` ahuaca-molli '' , `` molli '' being the original classical nahuatl word for `` sauce '' . 
  that 's even more convoluted . 
  whose stupid idea was it to pronounce it `` avocado '' then ? 
  ( i looked it up . 
  apparently , english accidentally loaned the actual spanish word `` avocado '' , as in the one that means `` lawyer '' , rather than `` aguacate '' . 
  well , that can be explained mostly by hebrew not allowing too many consonants in a row , and not allowing h at the front . 
  the x at the end is weird though . 
  do you really have words that end in x but not k ? 
  ( assuming x represents a sound kind of like `` h '' , as opposed to `` ks '' ), 
  * yes , that , but you did n't always used to say it that way !, 
  ( although , mind you , i 'm studying tagalog , and that managed to loan `` abogado '' instead of `` avocado '' , which is pretty impressive considering that tagalog loans are usually from 16th-century spanish . 
  maybe it loaned a transitional form `` avogado '' and converted the `` v '' to a `` b '' when it loaned it , seeing as though tagalog has no `` v '' . ), 
  okay , everybody replying to me is getting confused as to what i 'm trying to say . 
  timeline :, 
  - ~ 0 ad : latin has the word `` advocatus '' , coming from `` advocare '' , meaning `` spoken for '' . 
  - ~ 500 ad : vulgar latin gets `` advocato '' from `` advocatum '' , the accusative form of `` advocatus '' . 
  - ~ 1000 ad : old spanish simplifies `` dv '' to `` v '' and voices the `` t '' to `` d '' , resulting in `` avocado '' . 
  this spelling persists for centuries . 
  - ~ 1500 ad : spanish now pronounces `` avocado '' as `` avogado '' , but still spells it `` avocado '' . 
  meanwhile , spain meets the aztecs and loans their word for avocado as `` aguacate '' . 
  when english tries to loan this word , it ends up loaning `` avocado '' instead . 
  hilarity ensues . 
  when tagalog tries to loan `` avocado '' , it loans it by sound , so it ends up deriving the form `` abogado '' a couple hundred years early . 
  - sometime after : spanish reforms its spelling to compensate for the frication of intervocalic `` b '' , replacing many instances of `` v '' with `` b '' ( not that it matters for pronunciation now ) . 
  also apparently compensates for voicing , turning instances where `` c '' would be voiced to `` g '' . 
  this turns `` avocado '' into `` abogado '' . 
  - ~ 2000 ad : someone on the internet learns that english `` avocado '' is loaned from 16th century spanish `` avocado '' . 
  said person shares this information . 
  spanish speakers become confused , because they know it 's spelled `` abogado '' . 
  internet ensues . 
  edit : apparently `` sometime after '' is 1815 .
