  the point is ie languages always have pretty much the same number of cases . 
  uralic languages do too , but it 's a * different * number !, 
  ( and , well , actually we do have a greater variety in number of cases , since pu did n't have that many ; most of our cases were innovated later by agglutination . 
  among well-known uralic languages , though , it 's always around 15 . ), 
  they definitely would 've , all molluscs taste brilliant, 
  no , it 's freaking all of them . 
  dual number is only present in a couple slavic languages . 
  the largest amount of cases an ie language has ever had has been 8 , and they 've always ever been suffixes . 
  practically every ie language ever has gender , even english with he/she/it . 
  they 're all boring rehashes of the same thing . 
  it can make perfect sense , in a number of ways ( e.g. 
  local rulers can pay more attention to local matters ) . 
  but the real in-game reason is more rulers = more mana = more development . 
  are turkish minor ideas any good ? 
  better advisors ? 
  he 'd be someone really ancient not expected to live through the next year . 
  yeah , grandpa harley is right, 
  they 're colored like their flag < 3, 
  cross your eyes , it 'll be 3d !, 
  ... ... ... wait . 
  no , it wo n't . 
  this is utterly pointless . 
  and there goes the ignorant amerifat , unaware of foreign customs ... 
  banat can get independent ? 
  but [ holy shit , it was actually independent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banat_republic ) until serbia could n't let something so beautiful exist of course . 
  dude , the mongol conquests killed 40 million people ( many of whom were of my people ) , and set back the development of at the very least the middle east with the sack of baghdad . 
  saying that they 're only viewed negatively because they `` lost '' is kind of like saying hitler is only viewed negatively because he lost , except a whole lot worse . 
  * genghis khan * was better at it . 
  the mongols were never particularly notable among steppe nomads until they took over most of asia . 
  his successors were just riding off of the benefits of his material gains . 
  and , well , yeah , it was only a matter of time until steppe nomad culture produced someone like him , but that does n't excuse him . 
  killing that many people is really bad . 
  he wiped out a lot of different peoples that way . 
  you ca n't frame it as `` well really history is written by the winners , the mongols killing pointlessly large amounts of people in order to exact tribute can be either a positive or a negative depending on how you look at it '' . 
  war is n't just war , there 's more and less destructive ways to go about it . 
  the mongols did it decisively more destructively than most others . 
  you can bet your ass if someone else had conquered baghdad , they would n't have burned it like the mongols did . 
  they 're from ruthenia , probably . 
  god , you 're not one of those indian nationalists , are you ? 
  i know the octopus is metaphorical , but how cool would that be ? 
  unfortunately , your self is n't the same as your future self . 
  i always curse myself when i open up personal code from several years ago with little to no comments . 
  i do n't know much about those people . 
  napoleon was impressive for conquering most of europe , but if he killed ridiculously large amounts of people doing it , then that makes him a terrible person ( all the more inexcusable because of the fact that he was from post-enlightenment france ) . 
  same with alexander the great ( and honestly , based on his time period , i do n't have very high hopes for him ) . 
  it 'll look even more beautiful when it 's underwater in a couple decades . 
  since the soviet invade , nothing is life :(, 
  what 's up with friuli ? 
  do they speak something else ? 
  hungarian 's pattern is actually more interesting :, 
  the words for 8 and 9 are actually also derived from the word for 10 . 
  the `` c '' at the end of `` nyolc '' and `` kilenc '' ( pronounced `` ts '' ) is a shortened version of the word `` t\u00edz '' . 
  what 's interesting about this is that `` t\u00edz '' is a relatively recent loan from old persian ; before that , our word for `` ten '' was something to the effect of '' \\* lav '' or '' \\* lov '' . 
  in mansi , a relatively closely related language , the same pattern is preserved with the original root :, 
  - 8 : nyololow, 
  - 9 : ontolow, 
  - 10 : low, 
  notice how it preserves the prefix `` nyol - '' for 8 . 
  in khanty , it 's only 9 and 10 :, 
  and other finno-ugric languages preserve similar patterns . 
  in the finnic languages , the words for 8 and 9 are the words for 2 and 1 respectively paired with some variation of the word `` teksan '' . 
  finnish :, 
  estonian :, 
  however , their words for 10 are of a different root . 
  all of this is what makes it so hard to reconstruct numbers for proto-uralic . 
  they vary wildly between the uralic languages . 
  edit : i 've figured out the hungarian and mansi prefixes , with the help of the [ sz\u00f3kincsh\u00e1l\u00f3 etymological dictionary ] ( http://www.szokincshalo.hu/szotar/?qbetu=n&amp;qsearch=&amp;qdetail=7895 ) . 
  the entry for 8 reads :, 
  in english :, 
   probably formed from a `` nyol - '' element in the old hungarian era , to which later compounded the '' - c '' element by analogy with `` kilenc '' . 
  the first element likely corresponds to the ugric era 's `` nyal\u00e1b '' root word , meaning `` together , altogether '' . 
  we must consider that a base 7 system was in use for long in the finno-ugric era , therefore 8 was the first instance of a new , higher unit ; it was n't uncommon among fishing-hunting peoples that they identify some bunch or collection of leather or dried fish with an important number . 
  the article for 9 , meanwhile , confirms that it 's `` 10 '' with a prefix , the prefix coming from `` k\u00edv\u00fcl '' , meaning `` outside '' . 
  so all this complexity comes from clumsily adapting a base 7 system to a base 10 system with a couple extra numbers !, 
  the only time i do n't use insane amounts of garlic is when i have guests . 
  then i minimize it , so as to prevent bad breath . 
  you would n't believe the complaints i 've gotten . 
  my personal speculation is that they may have to do with 4 and 2 ( notice how mansi 4 is `` nyila '' ) , but honestly i dunno . 
  edit : apparently the `` nyol - '' prefix used to mean something like `` altogether '' , and `` kilen - '' has to do with `` k\u00edv\u00fcl '' -  `` ki\u00fcl - '' -  `` kil - '' meaning `` outside '' .

  they can be your religion , but they do n't convert land . 
  which is kinda stupid ( but intentional , to prevent abuse ) . 
  that 's a completely unscientific observation . 
  high prestige and low prestige varieties of a language do n't correlate with pitch , or anything , really . 
  the wikipedia article on [ prestige in sociolinguistics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prestige_ ( sociolinguistics \\ ) ) is a decent overview of the subject . 
  \\  chemicals, 
  \\  healthy, 
  but mainly bad legal advice . 
  you can make an accurate orthography without using excessive amounts of diacritics ( and having the `` z '' sound be written `` d '' , while there is no letter `` z '' in the alphabet ) . 
  you totally can ; just use digraphs . 
  i [ challenged ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/37ag9i/challenge_design_an_alphabet_for_vietnamese_that/ ) / r/conlangs to it a while ago and they [ came up with something super reasonable . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/37ag9i/challenge_design_an_alphabet_for_vietnamese_that/crl6y1q ), 
  why would you write it as `` d '' , still ? 
  `` z '' is a much better letter for [ j ] than `` d '' . 
  meanwhile the letter that actually makes a d-like sound is '' \u00f0 '' or something similar that i ca n't type ... ( although it made sense at the time , as it stood for [ \u00f0 ] ), 
  diacritics . 
  just not too many . 
  but there 's only four , not counting the two glottalized ones which you could indicate in a different way ... 
  the game 's model would need to radically change before it would be able to tell us meaningful things about history . 
  great for teaching geography , though .
