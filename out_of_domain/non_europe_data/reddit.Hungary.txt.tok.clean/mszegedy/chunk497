  there 's , like , three germanic words in that sentence . 
  there , that 's it , that 's your germanic . 
  mongolia is terrible at drawing maps . 
  probably ca n't see very well out of those slanty eyes . 
  why ? 
  `` i 'm ... i 'm a jew ? 
  then ... i must do the logical thing ... and kill the only jew i can legally kill ... '' bang, 
  is the food at least good ? 
  come on , it 's indonesia , there is no way the food can be bad, 
  it 's called a circus, 
  i thought it was always tupinamba , who are also famous for going to war with france frequently and winning, 
   metathesis, 
  that would n't be metathesis , it would be placement dissimilation . 
  know your sound change types !, 
  of all books , why the oed ? 
  what 's it ever done to you ? 
  that 's called animism , that 's different, 
  this is mean to autists . 
  this is kind of a visual representation of why i like using really bare-bones linux distros , like arch . 
  and unlike this car , arch is safe !, 
  remember the subreddit you 're on, 
  this place needs to appreciate pedant submissions more . 
  they deserve it , the bastards . 
  i dunno , i think it happened more because english speakers were uncomfortable with the [ ts ] consonant cluster ( perhaps going through a medial form [ \u0294s ] before [ ks ] ) , and moved the stop . 
  the analogy interpretation is reasonable though . 
  indonesia is one of the few countries who will understand our love of spicy food, 
  i have n't played minecraft in nearly five years . 
  what the * fuck * is this ? 
  can you do that in english too , use the word `` tail '' as a euphemism for `` penis '' ? 
  i 've heard `` part '' or `` parts '' used that way , before , but only in a very awkward situation . 
  i love the paradox players ' obsession with ryukyu , because it makes them far more likely to agree with me when i tell them that the okinawan islands have their own language , culture , religious history , etc. 
  together we can piss off every japanese in / r/paradoxplaza by telling them that the modern okinawan islands should be independent !, 
  so , mods ? 
  i remember when they introduced redstone-activated pistons , but this seems to be on a whole other level . 
  so , assad is in direct conflict with isis ... and is also alleged to be supplying them monetarily ? 
  i thought that was `` cauda '' ( `` caudum '' ? ), 
   neutrino smallest particle, 
  well , do you know any smaller ones ? 
  they probably meant lightest . 
  this is brilliant , thank you for sharing . 
  i was getting used to having no support , as is typical for our demographic . 
  it 's a good , relatively detailed timeline ( with some contestable spots ) , but my main gripe is that it starts all the way in 2011 , never bothering to explain why there was an arab spring in the first place . 
  you can trace the instability in the middle east far further back . 
  i had it once and it was very good . 
  however , where i usually buy ice cream ( which is hungary ; we 're a pretty ice cream-impoverished place , considering that we live next to italy ) , it 's far more likely that it would be plum-flavored or elderberry-flavored or something . 
  or maybe grape-flavored ; i swear i 've seen a greyish ice cream around here that ended up being some sort of purple fruit . 
  it 's absolutely beautiful ( and it does n't have a legend ), 
  reddit : where the only replies to your joke are people not getting it, 
  there must be a comic !, 
  get him an eye-tracking device !, 
  ohh that makes a lot of sense now . 
  kind of a weird scheme though ; i would n't associate majors with hardness and minors with softness . 
  haiti loves conquering random bits of the world . 
  in my games they frequently conquer japan . 
  but then would n't austria hate op too ? 
  `` pops '' , where paradox terminology and confectionery terminology collide, 
   always operated with [ shitposts ], 
  not true . 
  a few years ago , shitposts were unusual , and i even created / r/truehomestuck ( a naming scheme that was a fad at the time ) in case the sub ever became too shitty . 
  but now it 's both that we 're used to the shitposts and do n't consider them shitty , and that i 'm too busy/lazy to actually mod / r/truehomestuck , so i never raised the issue . 
  but i do remember when the `` dave-sprite '' pun was the top voted submission , and we understood that it only got such a high score because it was a pun , and not a `` usual '' submission ( like a discussion post or something ) . 
  if anything i ca n't believe the css has n't significantly changed since then . 
  this subreddit has a hell of a good css design . 
  * although , vlad the impaler was a wallachian , and bram stoker thought that the sz\u00e9kelys were some weird breed of balkan , considering that dracula insisted that his ancestors were bolyars . 
  on the other hand , dracula was also definitely partially inspired by the blood countess/b \u00e1thory erzs\u00e9bet , who was definitely hungarian ( and has her own eu4 event ! ) . 
  in summary , louis ck is a vampire . 
   the cameraman working relationship , extraordinary notice was released today . 
  ahh , good old maglish . 
  yes , although we call it `` magyar '' . 
  the name of our people and language comes from a group of uralic invaders who settled here in the 800s or so and gave us their language , culture , religion , and identity ( although not long for the religion ; pretty much immediately after the germans converted us to catholicism ) . 
  the european name `` hungarian '' probably comes from a turkic tribe associated with the area . 
  we 're mostly descended from the turkic tribe , along with a bunch of slavs we imported after we got genocided by the mongols and then the turks , but we still call ourselves magyars , because they 're way cooler . 
  ( they once punched the whole of europe in the face . 
  how neat is that ? ), 
  ( btw , i wrote `` maglish '' since the `` g '' in `` magyar '' conveniently intersected with the `` g '' in `` english '' , but the sound made by `` gy '' ( which is considered a single letter ) is n't like `` g '' at all ; it is like halfway between `` j '' as in `` jack '' and `` g '' as in `` gap '' , and is pronounced at the same place as `` y '' as in `` yap '' . 
  you can fake it by saying `` madyar '' , which is what the czech 'n' slovaks do . ), 
  no problem !, 
  just wait until some nationalist reads it and tries to claim that we 're descended from god himself , or something, 
  [ we 're pretty certain . 
  ] ( http://www.eupedia.com/europe/haplogroup_n1c_y-dna.shtml ) by tracking haplogroups , we 've determined that barely any of the uralic genes got passed on to the hungarians . 
  y haplogroup n1c is associated with uralic people ( look how many russians are descended from them !, 
  ) , but it 's hardly present in hungary at all . 
  what 's worth noting is that we have a special variety of n1c that 's * only * present among places where the magyars settled , namely hungary and random bits of asia , called n1c1a1a2b , but it 's rare . 
  it seems the magyars just up and died . 
  this is what you get when you get your gene pool nearly wiped out by mongols , i tell you !, 
  hey no problem !, 
  nah , they did n't take over any russians , it 's the reverse . 
  i mean , being an ethnic minority in russia is literally the status quo for every uralic people right now outside of the hungarians , finns , estonians , s\u00e1mi , and i guess the livonians . 
  the russians conquered all the uralic people , and subsequently interbred with them . 
  now the majority of people with uralic ancestry call themselves russian . 
  the history of the uralic peoples goes like this : approximately 11k years ago , they were some random tribe in western or southern china or possibly indochina , as is confirmed by the fact that most of n1c 's relatives are located around the area . 
  sometime after that but before 5k years ago , they migrated to western siberia . 
  5k years ago , some part of ( in fact , probably a majority of ) the uralic peoples spoke [ proto-uralic , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proto-uralic_language ) a language which every living uralic language is descended from . 
  ( alternatively , modern uralic languages are descended from a multitude of languages spoken by these people at the time , which borrowed enough from each other to look like the same language family by the present day . 
  this is a minority hypothesis , however . ), 
  by this time , they were living somewhere around the ob river near the ural mountains , hence the name . 
  they were shamanists and reindeer herders , and made some [ kickass pottery . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pit%e2%80%93comb_ware_culture ), 
  over the next few thousand years , they expanded across most of modern-day russia ( minus far eastern siberia ) , bordering the indo-europeans who were busy conquering europe , persia , and northern india . 
  at one point , they expanded as far as the balts , hence the high concentration of n1c there , but they got overridden pretty quickly by the indo-europeans .
