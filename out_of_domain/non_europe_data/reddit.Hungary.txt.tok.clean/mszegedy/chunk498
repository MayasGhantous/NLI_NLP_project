  by the 9th century , though , they were still as far as [ belarus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volga_finns ) . 
  at this point , after crossing the ural mountains and deciding that they did n't like the west side any better than the east side , the magyars packed up and left the urals altogether , traveling across persia , bashkiria , and tatar crimea , and eventually arriving in the carpathian basin . 
  they then proceeded to [ raid all europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_invasions_of_europe ) for no good reason at all . 
  after getting that out of their system , after a couple hundred years , they got murdered by the mongols , at which point the [ king ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%a9la_iv_of_hungary ) had to import some slavs from up north so that he 'd have subjects . 
  meanwhile , the russians had conquered a lot of modern-day european russia , and then * they * got decimated by the mongols too . 
  a side effect of the mongol invasions was the complete extermination of hungarian speakers outside of europe , and i 'm sure many other uralic languages besides , which is why hungarian is very distant from the rest of the uralic languages today . 
  since then , the uralic peoples have mostly gotten their asses kicked . 
  sweden conquered finland ( and eventually gave it back ) , the ottomans and later austria controlled hungary for hundreds of years ( and gave it back under [ the most unfortunate of circumstances ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_trianon ) ) , and everybody else was subsumed in the russian empire . 
  estonia was eventually kicked out in the bolshevik revolution , and [ the komis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_perm ) managed to be briefly independent in the 1400s , but in general , we 've had it rough . 
  and now most of the uralic languages are going to die out in russia . 
  it 's pretty sad . 
  oh well , that 's what we get for herding reindeer instead of riding horses or something . 
  at least we get sympathy from the turkic and mongolic peoples , who are in a similar position . 
  this is mostly a sign of being human, 
  you 're forgetting estonia , how dare you !, 
  also pls . 
  typologically , the uralic languages are one of the most similar families to the indo-european languages . 
  our cases are nothing more than glorified postpositions , and proto-uralic actually had * less * cases than proto-indo-european . 
  the one thing you can point to that 's unusual for ie languages is that we 've never had a gender system , but nobody points at a language and goes , `` it * does n't have a gender system !, 
  * how confusing and counterintuitive ! '', 
  we do have vowel harmony , though , but it makes things easier , not harder ( since a word can only contain up to 5 different vowels , despite that we have a lot more than that ) . 
  so , he has a higher body count than hearts ? 
  i believe that , i just mean that it 's not saying much , since half of the midnight crew has worn rings . 
  and even discounting the kills from the ring , dd 's killed dave and a couple members of the felt , which i think puts his killcount above cd 's in that regard . 
  now you 're thinking with liberty, 
   if not all, 
  bet you five bucks the vatican is n't, 
  the problem with online economies is usually the massive inflation rate . 
  does anyone know whether this affected eq ? 
  now mount a lid on it and fly it into kerbol, 
  do n't worry , websites are never * intentionally * shitty . 
  these guys just hate writing mobile websites . 
   reverse-imported, 
  the technical term is `` reborrowed '', 
  overthrowing the republic probably, 
  i do n't really like xkcd 's occasional psa comics . 
  they 're not funny , and they generally just inspire the readers ( such as most of reddit ) to be meaner than necessary to anybody who does n't follow the philosophy of that comic . 
  and some of them come off as just smacking down a strawman . 
  it will be interesting to see how reddit reacts to this one , though , since they were generally on the prescriptivist side . 
  probably now , every time someone posts something about `` could care less '' being `` wrong '' , instead of a long argument , someone will just reply with the comic instead and get a bazillion upvotes . 
  that 's probably a better use of everyone 's time anyway . 
  [ sam hughes has the same opinion . 
  ] ( http://qntm.org/oblivion ) ( what happened , anyway ? 
  reddit used to love him . ), 
  yeah this is one of the more harmless ones , although it 's a little hoity-toity . 
  but some of the other ones are downright mean-spirited , like [ this one . 
  ] ( http://xkcd.com/1314/ ) i do n't really like munroe rubbing how much better he knows than use in our faces , even if he 's right . 
  i mean , he 's writing a comic for god 's sake . 
  those are n't supposed to be condescending . 
  what do you mean how is it mean-spirited ? 
  - person has opinion ( not even a terrible one ; `` i wish people would experience stuff more thoroughly , i bet they 'd enjoy it better that way '' ), 
  - person is wrong and must be told off with multiple panels of monologue, 
  - person is just so * thoroughly defeated * by le logic that they ca n't formulate a counterargument, 
  - ironically make fun of person by doing something person does n't like, 
  an intellectually honest comic would at least have a dialogue in which each argument is represented in its strongest form , like the sanus/amencia dialogues in existentialcomics . 
  i do n't care for munroe 's `` strawman  monologue  strawman looks dumb '' formula . 
  it does n't matter what hat guy 's opinion is , he could have been saying `` gas the jews '' for all i care . 
  ( but yeah , i really do n't think `` these people could be enjoying life more '' is a rude stance to have . ), 
  it 's how he barely gets a word in before being steamrolled by the munroe-logue . 
  you need to respect whoever you 're debating against . 
  these comics are the equivalent of constantly talking over your opponent . 
  nobody 's mind is going to be changed by these comics ; people with the opinion attacked in the comic will just be angry over how much of a jackass munroe was to them . 
  and most everyone else will just think , `` yeah , what a great counterargument ! '', 
  and spam the comic every time someone has the opposing opinion . 
  it does n't solve anything , it just makes people on the `` right '' side feel good . 
  inheritin ' stuff, 
  ahh damn , `` unusable '' violins can usually be fixed relatively cheaply . 
  i feel sorry for that poor violin . 
  it 's absolutely perfect . 
  except for the french in england . 
  my god your indochina is even worse than modern indochina, 
  poor florence :(, 
  japanese must suck horribly for insults if * english * of all languages surprises a japanese with its variety, 
  people keep independently inventing the idea after seeing the original flowchart . 
  [ i actually made my own variant ] ( http://imgur.com/z4r4mr2 ) and posted it deep in some reddit thread a while ago , but i never thought to submit it here . 
  edit : [ found the thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3ac27q/not_even_wd40_will_fix_that/csbb4wt ), 
  the guy who wrote the phrase got it wrong . 
  `` fututus '' means `` fucked '' ( as in , the participle/adjective ) , and ca n't mean `` fuck off '' . 
  but i do n't really know what would , since `` futuere '' is n't idiomatic in latin the same way `` fuck '' is in english . 
  that would be `` futuere '' , but i do n't think that was a common insult in latin either . 
  / r/forwardsfromgrandma, 
  get a degree in visual design or something, 
  intern or freelance, 
  i do n't really know , but i wanted reddit 's first response to you to be something helpful , not dickish, 
  whoah , hold on . 
  `` well , one of us has to change '' is a whole * expression ? 
  * the only other time i 've heard it was in 2005 in an [ el goonish shive comic . 
  ] ( http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=700 ) i remember it because it confused me a lot then , when i had a worse grasp of english . 
  now it turns out it 's a whole thing ? 
  is it a quote from a movie or something ? 
  if it is , then it does n't show up on imdb . 
  pls help , this is mind-blowing . 
  edit : maybe it 's from seinfeld ? 
  egs calls it a `` sitcom-ish routine '' . 
  yeah , someone could have written something unhelpful or even mean, 
  first response to the post , i meant, 
  it eventually happens to everyone , posting in the wrong thread, 
  same here , but `` she '' feels less wrong . 
  and i 've been speaking english fluently for two decades , and i * still * mix up `` he '' and `` she '' . 
  fuck , man , life 's only been here for 3-4 billion years .
