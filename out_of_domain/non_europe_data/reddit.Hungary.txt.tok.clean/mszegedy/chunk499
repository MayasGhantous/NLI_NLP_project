  it 's not even predicted to survive for another billion ? 
  that 's disheartening . 
  hopefully something can be done about that . 
  edit : also , `` most words extinct '' is inaccurate for 1k years in the future . 
  typically we can reconstruct words 5k-ish years back ( and of course those words had etymologies too , just usually unknown ones ) , but it 's unclear how new media will affect language change . 
  we might end up wiring ourselves into some kind of net and foregoing words altogether . 
  but then again the whole image is hypothetical and has points like `` y chromosome extinct '' and so on , so that 's an acceptable break . 
  but i 'd still put `` most words extinct '' at least 5k years in the future , and put a blurb saying something like `` most modern words unreconstructable using contemporary comparative methods '' . 
  of course , that depends on * which * words we 're talking about ; words from widely-spoken languages would be reconstructable , whereas extinct languages without descendants are already completely underivable from existing languages . 
  or also we could move stuff, 
  yeah but that 's way in the future . 
  by then nobody will care . 
  but 1 billion more years is barely any time at all . 
  / r/frugal _ jerk is leaking, 
  you believed that kid in elementary school who said thumbs are n't fingers ? 
  the hilarious thing about the liberian county flags is that you ca n't tell how horrible they are in polandball , because we draw everything in ms paint anyway . 
  if england formed gb , it would be three . 
  * frist, 
  no , it 's a cultural union that would be located in spain in this game . 
  \\  not liberating the rest of the uralic peoples, 
  ( but wow , what a fantastic aar , you are my role model for my shaman perm run ), 
  but we 're returning the co2 to the atmosphere right now , so at least that 's pretty much a solved problem . 
  conquer 'em , genocide them for their crimes, 
  just tested this . 
  with a heavy heart , i have to say it 's not true . 
  even if they occupy the capital , neither enforcing their demands nor breaking the country will convert the state religion . 
  dear god a joke contains an inaccuracy ? 
  what is reddit coming to, 
  in hungarian , we have an expression , `` kutya baj '' , literally `` dog problem '' . 
  it is what we call something really annoying that somebody seems to bear really well . 
  `` kutya baja volt '' means `` he/she had a dog problem '' , meaning `` he/she was completely fine afterwards , considering what he/she went through . 
  what a tough guy . '', 
  i never really understood the sentiment until i went to take my shih-tzu to get shots . 
  he acted like it was n't even happening . 
  good dog . 
   +0.1 army tradition, 
  itt : people who do n't understand that your second paragraph means that you do n't believe in phrenology, 
  hmm , * maybe *, 
  your second paragraph is genius , i never thought of that . 
  this might make my shaman perm run more viable , if i immediately beeline for sakhalin ... 
  well , the key thing is , it looks better when everything else surrounding it is ms paint, 
  `` bloody '' is right, 
  the trick is , fuck allies . 
  aggressively use the climate and your enemies ' stupidity against them , and backstab your neighbors when they 're fighting wars against each other . 
  try to get a large vassal , and then later integrate them . 
  conquer manchuria , and then conquer stuff outside of manchuria , does n't have to be china . 
  just take your time ; china will always be there to exploit . 
  unless they westernize . 
  then you 're fucked . 
  this is also genius . 
  holy fucken shit . 
  edit : also , the conversion time thing is no problem , i 'll just keep them at war long enough that they wo n't have money for missionaries . 
  the hilarious thing is that non-funded missionaries would still convert the province before rebels rose up , but the ai is too afraid of rebels to try that ( and possibly unable to control the funding of missionaries at all ) . 
  if you ca n't see humans with the naked eye , you are almost certainly legally blind, 
  oh fuck come on . 
  they disabled the vote trimming a few weeks ago , and everybody complained about their front pages getting stale . 
  so they re-enabled it , and now everybody 's forgotten why the trimming 's there in the first place . 
  `` weird '' indeed . 
  sorry , i could n't reply to your comment because i was too busy * implementing your solution and holy shit it worked . 
  * thank you so , so , so so much , this is amazing . 
  ( not shown : the fact that every province in muscovy is shamanist , and of course the fact that i am shamanist ), 
  ( also , barely noticeable : i released estonia from the livonian order , so no genocide for them !, 
  they 're allied with the plc , so they 've got it good ), 
  it 's gooey , it ca n't stick to your hand for long :(, 
  that is as predictable as you are british and france is french,

  to the inevitable complaints about how short it is : i do n't have time to make long installments , and this episode is only meant to show the opening strategy anyway . 
  i am so hyped to be finally doing this !, 
  i 've struggled through five patches with an opening strategy , and thanks to / u/pabst _ blue_gibbon , i 've finally got one that works . 
  what he did to the black king is non-canon . 
  but what he did to nepeta , for example , entirely is . 
  it 's totally canon that he did * something * surprisingly effective , but it 's never made clear what . 
  probably dutch , which is why it looks like afrikaans, 
  huh , must be afrikaans then . 
  it 's definitely not finnish , i can say that much , although the double vowels would have you think so . 
  wait , the fuck ? 
  your source says pelym should still be independent in 1444 . 
  that 's the whole point of the custom nations designer though . 
  but then the prestige element is lost . 
  which is why i 'm doing it with perm !, 
  even according to your source , though , yugra was never one independent country , rather three ob-ugric principalities . 
  that russia 's name placement must suck if we do n't get to see any of it in this screenshot . 
  mystery solved !, 
  i once wrote out my complaints in long form . 
  maybe i should have just written this instead . 
  maybe ? 
  i do n't remember that happening , but it could have . 
  yeah . 
  the `` szegedy '' in my username means `` from szeged '' , which itself is named in some way after the river that runs through it ( either `` island '' or `` corner ( in the river 's path ) '' , no one 's sure anymore ) . 
  either way , it derives from the word `` szeg '' , which derives from proto-ugric ** se\u014bkv * , meaning `` wedge '' , of uncertain etymology . 
  ( proto-uralic had ** tola * for `` wedge '' . ), 
  but that 's just an exclave, 
  do n't forget the soviets !, 
  nah , it 's fairly structurally useless as far as amino acids go , which is why you do n't see it around a lot . 
  it 's too damn big . 
  i do n't even need to watch either gif to know exactly what took place here, 
  this exactly . 
  the name is usually pronounced - eye - in english , but the comic seems to indicate - ee - . 
  to be fair , not everyone understands typing .
