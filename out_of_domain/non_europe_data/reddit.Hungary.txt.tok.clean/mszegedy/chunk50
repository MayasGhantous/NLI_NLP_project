  i do n't think i even remember , but i 'm pretty sure it was one of the sermons . 
  but ... `` the dream lord was * me * ! '', 
  monsters inc. 
  you spelled his name wrong !, 
  what kind of university are you ? 
  sorry , i 'm christian . 
  :d perhaps a different kind ? 
  that 's true !, 
  truth to be told , it does n't look to me like wazowski is actually making that face . 
  hey , now that i do think about it all of my childhood memories of * antz * really are about it being boring !, 
  so , if my brain is anything to go by , yup , boring . 
  for a moment there i got a heart attack from thinking that i had failed to quote a relevant part of the bible on / r/atheism, 
  from the bible , phd in praying and inane facebook posts , pope 's hat in background ? 
  ( i 'm catholic ), 
  well , one 's a word anyway . 
  why do you especially much too having mocked even taken place to would like been that under clearly have make want had as saying to well good ? 
  or , all of the theist 's pieces are invisible , and he just makes up board-states for every position that you have . 
  like , you open d3 ... bam took your queen, 
  also , american . 
  it 's john 's theme . 
  what sort of sheet music would you like , and for what instruments ? 
  i can actually smell it . 
  let me guess , you use a dvorak keyboard ? 
  meet the vrillyhoo popamatic !, 
  dave used it when he and jade got in a fight with bec noir while they were collecting frogs . 
  sorry , i did n't see your post . 
  i did n't really want to submit it in the , `` lol this is hilarious '' context , rather the `` guys , this is like my only choice , help pls '' context . 
  maybe i should have used a different picture !, 
  but , okay . 
  thanks for letting me know !, 
  help , i ca n't find what stage i am !, 
  i 've listened to mahler , bruckner , twelve-tone , and modern a lot ( the last one especially because i have a friend at juliard who got accepted as a composer ) , but i 'm too casual to be listed as anything above any of those . 
  then again , i * only * listen to classical music , so maybe i 'm not that casual ? 
  you fail at making real links for this subreddit you tool, 
  why would it need to do anything else ? 
  seed , so we can check whether it 's legit ? 
  why do you mistype all of your words ? 
  ( although `` whale '' seems like a decent sea creature pun ), 
  wait , * 95 % * of people have never heard of french ? 
  ** ... still technically correct !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ well ^ ^ ^ ^ shit, 
  url = extactly the same, 
  jeb add ents as a mob nao jebjebjebjbejbejbebjbejbejebjbejbebjebjeb, 
  well , `` in the entire world '' with `` on the entire internet '' . 
  and here , this is because homestuck is a webcomic , so any fan has to use the internet regularly . 
  posts actually garner one less karma than the number they display . 
  so , you get negative karma if you un-upvote your own post . 
  to be fair , though , you forgot `` your entire family '' off of heaven , and `` giant lake of fire to burn in for eternity '' off of hell . 
  he could still go to hell !, 
  does he attend church regularly ? 
  aww , but vivaldi is in heaven ... 
  i was imagining the book on back of the third book in the city of ember series , * the prophet of yonwood * . 
  i 'm not sure why , because it 's wrapped in plastic and not musty at all , and probably not leather either . 
  two things on a df player 's mind :, 
  fuck mayors, 
  fuck elves, 
  especially funny seeing as you are male . 
  \\  gets mad when they are produced, 
  i hope i will someday have a hilarious story to tell about it . 
  it 's a verb ... 
  '' [ ` n\u03b5pit\u028c ] '' ? 
  really ? 
  get the reddit enhancement suite , it will solve all of your problems . 
  ( and includes separate options for being subscribed to a subreddit and having it in the front page . ), 
  so no porn stars either ? 
  you have something against adverbs being segregated from the rest of the clause by a comma to indicate a pause when used in the context of a slight afterthought ? 
  wow . 
  i wish my catholic faith was like this . 
  ... this changes everything . 
  so we * should n't * try to amend peoples ' manner if they do n't seem to follow christian ideals perfectly enough , or indeed at all ? 
  but it 's not * every * subreddit . 
  what 's the logic behind the color lettering of `` feeedom '' ? 
  being catholic , i upvoted the shit outta this . 
  and quotes . 
  so many quotes . 
  once i need a good fix of link karma , i 'll google `` atheism quotes '' , slap it on any background whatsoever , and post it as a picture . 
  because pictures are for words . 
  wait , what ? 
  who 's committing suicide ? 
  how did you have the resolve to get to part 3 ? 
  :o i could n't even sit through half of the first part . 
  coming from someone who could n't even get through the first part , wait , that 's a legit quote ? 
  but ... are n't the definitions arbitrary and invented by humans ? 
  except not . 
  i think . 
  shit , i do n't know . 
  i think `` birds '' simply * meant * flying creatures . 
  some of them . 
  there is a single iota of difference . 
  they were told not to , were n't they ? 
  but it could have been true for * their * definition of a bird . 
  they got to define it . 
  then the point of a subreddit is circlejerking . 
  they could have . 
  by `` see reason '' , i mean `` be an atheist '' . 
  we 'll probably get more updates later today . 
  there 's the weeping angels mod . 
  jake is jake , and dirk is jake . 
  he 's alone with himself in his dream bubble . 
  but the `` hundreds of years in the future '' thing is indeed a bit suspicious .
