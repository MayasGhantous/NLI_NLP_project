  when you write on paper , you do n't necessarily think of separating sentences as , `` okay ; period , space , next letter '' . 
  unless you grew up typing , in which case that 's probably how you think of it . 
  should also say mongol horde for hungary , at least according to our neighbors !, 
  i always figured that the noun , as in `` ecological niche '' , is `` nitch '' , while the adjective , as in `` niche clothing '' is `` neesh '' . 
  / r/aww, 
  translated to latin :, 
   considerationes obiectivae phenomenarum contemporariarum compellent conclusionem, 
  ah fuck it you get the idea, 
  also , poland somehow managed to conquer riga . 
  tl ; dr the brake fluid contains a lot of small , flammable hydrocarbons and sugars stuck together with some oxygen atoms . 
  the chlorine attaches to the oxygen , and the hydrocarbons peel off and catch fire . 
  definitely not where i 'm from . 
  finnish russia ? 
  it 's like a moldy doughnut, 
  ladies and gentlemen , this is what a clickbait title looks like in german . 
  op did it much better . 
  `` tifu by convincing myself that i was the world 's number one superpower '', 
  you have good company . 
  but it did n't touch hungary !, 
  oh , of course , everyone always forgets about austria ... 
  meanwhile long austria, 
  i do n't think that was supposed to be deliberately bad . 
  or was there official confirmation ? 
  yes ( `` both in saber and in drink '' ) . 
  there are different versions floating around in hungarian and polish , but the general idea is always that hungary and poland are best friends who fight and drink together . 
  most people in hungary and poland know it in at least one language , and many people know it in both languages . 
  i happen to know a couple different versions in both . 
  this is n't my favorite one , since it does n't make a ton of sense ( thanks to the need to rhyme ) , but it 's the one i learned first , and it 's very similar to the first version i learned in hungarian ( magyar , lengyel , j\u00f3 bar\u00e1t , egy\u00fctt v\u00edv \u00e9s egy\u00fctt pi\u00e1l !, 
  well , it * was * third in the list . 
  by the 1812 campaign , austria had been an ally for over 5 years . 
  it 's true they were n't at an ally at the start , but it 's not like he did n't have any help , either . 
  so they 're pretty much uncorrelated ? 
  interesting , my phone wo n't even attempt to load the theme in the original link ; all it is is a white background , and black arial text , and the pictures . 
  ohh , what you posted * is * the mobile link . 
  i see . 
  still looks very normal ( i.e. 
  black and white ) on my phone !, 
  otherwise i would n't have confused them . 
  or cyan sometimes, 
  that * is * pretty hard to convert , though . 
  even if the freezing and boiling points of water are n't the most intuitive things to center your temperature scale around , it would at least be convenient if the two temperature scales were scaled the same way and/or had the same centers . 
  it 's bad enough that neither 5 nor 9 divide nicely into most numbers , but then you have to go and fiddle around with an addition/subtraction afterwards too . 
  it 's not like i ca n't do math in my head , but fraction addition and subtraction is about where i draw the line for convenience . 
  well , anyone older would n't even remember that undergrads exist, 
  this is also what happens when you start getting enough sleep again , and it 's great . 
  do n't worry , most people get it , as you can see from the vote distribution, 
  that 's a really nice brittany, 
  aww :( the french minors are always the best to see succeed, 
  wtf are ustyug and uglich ? 
  it 's a really cool map , though . 
  ohhh , that 's real cool . 
  1.13-compatible ? 
  i wan na say it 's about education ? 
  except at least where i 'm from , the education system is n't nearly as efficient as this looks . 
  maybe it 's different in japan . 
  that 's standard high german . 
  german in general is a very diverse dialect continuum , and one end of it ( schleswig ) is mostly mutually unintelligible with the other end of it ( switzerland ) . 
  it did n't used to be . 
  that was how i learned calculus back in the very early days of w | a. 
  the great memories i have of the step-by-step feature are what make me so pissed off that it 's a premium feature now . 
  i imagined him wearing heelies .

  the author never had any mental breakdowns , but his goals with the work did shift over the years . 
  in 2010 , it was supposed to be done by 2011 . 
  in 2012 , it was supposed to be done by april 13th , 2014 . 
  now , it 's supposed to be done soon \u2122 ( apparently it 's 99 % finished , and the only thing left is the finale ; this is a credible statement , because now , it 's a lot more coordinated than before , and the author has other things he wants to work on ) . 
  but their purple looks exactly like malaya 's !, 
  aha , but terezi has n't got kamina shades !, 
  i absolutely love the visuals though . 
  dirk 's colorful collection must be fun to draw . 
  has he ever actually been seen with puppet strings though ? 
  ( not that i do n't get why they 're there ; the comparison with terezi 's hanging thing is nice ), 
  \\  modern indie 2d games like terraria , bastion , and transistor, 
  \\  not resource-intensive, 
  \\  not resource-intensive , are you fucking kidding me ? 
  my terraria likes to skip frames and freeze for seconds at a time , and do n't even get me started on bastion/transistor . 
  they 're definitely not as bad , though , as europa universalis , for example , which i can only play for an hour at a time because otherwise the computer overheats and dies . 
  and this is a 3-year-old thinkpad we 're talking about , running integrated graphics ( or possibly the discrete gfx card on the inside ; i 'm terrible with this graphics driver stuff ) . 
  says nice things ? 
  admittedly , the second part is on point . 
  disclaimer : i speak english and german , not dutch . 
  the above comment was done using wiktionary and google translate . 
  that said , i do n't know about you , but having over half the thread be `` hurr durr i do n't know dutch '' is really fucking annoying . 
  the only way to stop that from happening again is not getting the posts to the front page . 
  that 's actually really cool . 
  gives me great ideas for things to print and frame . 
  once there was a discussion in / r/vim about how : wq feels `` more natural '' , where people who thought otherwise were downvoted . 
  imo it 's hugely chauvinistic bullshit , but it does seem to be the majority opinion . 
  strange . 
  possibly op did n't own a torch , and thought that large torches were a thing ? 
  there 's also [ ries ] ( http://mrob.com/pub/ries/ ) , which has the advantage of being downloadable . 
  that 's in my post . 
  i really hate how the colors for links ( especially already-visited links ) and the colors for normal text have become nigh-indistinguishable . 
  i know tvtropes at least has the courtesy to give you the option to underline all links ( as the people there are used to this issue ) . 
  well yeah , but nobody reads the text in the picture .
