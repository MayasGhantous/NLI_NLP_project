  they were brought over in the indo-european invasions several thousand years ago .

   ( is it just me or do people tend to think that german grammar is `` strict '' just because they do n't understand declensions ? ), 
  they think it 's strict because germans are le ordnung nazis . 
  which itself comes from the word for moon . 
  efficient !, 
  however we have exactly as much of a variety of onomatopoeic verbs as you guys , so * suck it *, 
  tl ; dr why are n't my vassals culture-converting stuff ? 
  they have every reason to, 
  fuck , i ca n't believe all the chemicals they 're putting these days in foods that used to be so natural, 
  no , that 's the whole point of all the math and feeding particular provinces to them in a particular order . 
  in a recent game posted here , they converted estonia even though estonian was accepted . 
  i 'm not sure what my estonia 's excuse is . 
  maybe vassals do n't convert ? 
  i * could * , but it would be against the spirit of the game . 
  if i wanted to use the console , then i would n't have to go to this accepted culture business in the first place . 
  at el goonish shive we have been enjoying this since the entire millennium,

  imo it looks like a fire with a really poor resolution,

  what is this from ? 
  you do n't understand , we hate him for unrelated reasons . 
  more generally we always hate whoever 's in power at the moment, 
   hack, 
  but anyway , i had no idea monkeys have agglutinativity . 
  i am totally bringing this up next time i hear someone call agglutinative languages weird . 
  90 % of `` hackers '' are script kiddies , so is n't it unfair to call them not real hackers ? 
  depends on the tomato . 
  the big ones you cut up for sandwiches taste terrible raw , but smaller ones like cherry tomatoes can be amazing .

  uh , we wo n't , cause everyone does it ?

  - state school with more independence = magnet school, 
  - private school = private school, 
  - public school = private school ( we have some pretty old private schools , from the colonial period even , but no distinct category for them ),

  programs are never `` well made '' , though , and the older they are the harder they are to maintain ( since they 're poorly documented and nobody knows how to work with them anymore ) . 
  the only reason older machines are still used to do anything is because nobody sees any immediate reason to replace them , and replacing them would be expensive . 
  paypal sounds like papal , so papal state .

  i 'm probably the only person on earth who did n't notice the pun . 
  such a missed opportunity . 
  `` admit it : you 've had this nightmare before . '', 
  was brilliant though , and the `` terrible doctor '' joke . 
  how do you know it does n't need maintenance ? 
  even besides the fact that it 's evidently not completely reliable ( since they have to call up the original programmer sometimes , apparently ) , it 's very probable that , like most systems , it develops minor issues frequently that the school has learned to fix on its own . 
  `` well-made '' in computing does not mean that if you use it the same way all the time then it will keep doing the same thing . 
  of course it does that . 
  that 's what computers do . 
  computers reliably work under certain conditions , and reliably fail under certain conditions . 
  ( but the conditions might be difficult to pin down . ), 
  `` well-made '' code is a mythical beast that programmers never get to see , but spend a lot of time fantasizing about . 
  it 's code that does n't break no matter what bullshit you put into it , and it 's code that 's easy to modify and build on , and it 's code that 's easy to maintain and transfer to new systems if need be . 
  code like that does n't exist . 
  anything bigger than a few thousand lines will inevitably become difficult-to-understand spaghetti ( although it * can * become * carefully-managed * spaghetti ) , and even smaller things can contain confusing idiosyncrasies . 
  the code in the article in question was written by a high-schooler . 
  what are the odds that it 's properly commented , and written in the simplest way possible ? 
  not a lot , i bet . 
  if the original writer gets hit by a truck tomorrow , that school district might be in a lot of trouble , because there 's no longer anyone to maintain the code . 
  edit : and there 's no such thing as code that does n't need maintenance , either . 
  what about when the school district wants to add a new room ? 
  or some other unforeseen complexity ? 
  complete military takeover of the rest of the world . 
  if they do n't put up a fight , it 's their problem !, 
  it 's a register . 
  i was kind of joking though , it 's not a real agglutinative grammar unless you can put the same suffix on different words ( among other things ) . 
  this is * exactly * why they should have gone with a republic . 
  i think he means the vodka, 
  let me introduce you to turkish, 
  george orwell 's [ newspeak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/newspeak ) fits the bill pretty well ( although he wrote about it at a time when he still knew little of linguistics , and he later apologized for some linguistic errors he made in its description ) . 
  language as we understand it is far and away unique to humans . 
  if you want a more specific answer , you 'll unfortunately have to consult a specialist ( or wikipedia  ) . 
  long story short , it is an agglutinative language that managed to not inherit much irregularity , with regular sound changes affecting all of its agglutinative morphemes evenly . 
  it is often claimed that there is only one or perhaps two irregular verbs in turkish , and the nouns and pronouns are even more regular than that .
