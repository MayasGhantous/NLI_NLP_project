  where have you been since patch 1.9 or so ? 
  muslims ca n't form pus now . 
  this is a cool way to make up for the fact that they could only use a limited amount of colors at a time,

  why , would you say it 's far ? 
  [ `` pressure '' by disasterpeace ] ( http://music.disasterpeace.com/track/pressure ) from fez . 
  how do i get that bass rumble ? 
  i 've tried making various instruments way too low , i 've tried reducing the resolution , etc. 
  it 's not working . 
  ahahahahaha that 's what you * think . 
  * i 've already been to bangladesh , i should know . 
  there 's [ this ] ( http://brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/2012/10/26/443-dark-versions/ ) illustration by matthew taranto , it 's pretty close to what you might want on a propaganda poster with olimar on it, 
  i mean , i have blood vessels in my fingers , but like ... 
  hopefully he gets a happier ending than plato, 
  holy shit , this sub loves to downvote . 
  i had the same question , and i 'm happy someone asked it , okay ? 
  do n't be douchebags . 
  what , you think paradox uses four bits for ruler mana ? 
  but anyway , it 's just a feature of tribes . 
  no , but eu4 is legendarily poorly documented . 
  you used to be able to see many -1 rulers in tribal nations when going through the start dates . 
  they 've been normalized to 0 ( and the overpowered 7/7/7 ruler of air or some other west african country has also been nerfed ) , but i guess it 's still possible with pretender rebels . 
  i dunno if the fact that op 's a tribe has anything to do with it anymore , but it fits the existing data . 
  if df had a ui like eu4 's , it would only be about as complex , or maybe even less so . 
  it 's kind of a shame , but also i like the aesthetic . 
  i do n't even know what work of fiction you 're referring to , but i think you just also described the simurgh 's method of perception from * worm *, 
  \\  implying at&t of all service providers would have coverage, 
  it was officially confirmed ; it was the last strip of that arc or something, 
  edit : [ here you go , ] ( http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=1699 ) it 's not like he literally says `` i am jerry '' but it 's pretty obvious that it 's him, 
  that looks more like one of those things the optometrist has .

  my mom bought me condoms well before i started having sex . 
  she bought a variety , so that i could `` try on '' various kinds to see which ones i liked best . 
  it was n't the most embarrassing moment of my teenage life , but only because nobody knew about it but me and my sister . 
  edit : and because the embarrassment was mitigated somewhat by the good feeling of actually owning condoms . 
  we were the only two children in the household . 
  we told each other everything . 
  we did live near saarland once , which has a similar reputation regarding incest . 
  no , i mean documented as a game , not as a codebase . 
  the wiki is usually incomplete and occasionally years out of date , and important tidbits are buried in forum posts ( which frequently are n't indexed by search engines ) . 
  it was either telling you , or letting the majority of reddit wonder what 's so special about saarland . 
  unless you mean that you know where we lived , in which case you really should have helped out opa in his last few months . 
  that 's what it * sounds * like , but it 's not , or else i would have been able to replicate it already . 
  i thought maybe it 's just a deep low-res wave ( disasterpeace is really fond of low-res ) , but that does n't really work either . 
  it 's got ta be at least * part * noise , but i have n't been able to hit on the combination yet . 
  i think it 's a little different from disasterpeace 's other stuff in that it sounds more like a snes-quality sample commonly heard in a variety of music to give a low , hot , industrial ambiance , but i 'm pretty sure he just used basic instruments , not a sample . 
  that 's what i do , except i can never remember what phrases are actually common . 
  then why am i a virgin :(, 
  \\  implying the only thing i fantasize about is stimulation of my dick, 
  it was a joke anyway, 
   serving volleyballs with it ? 
  goddamn you 've discovered my secret favorite pastime, 
  no , just traveling a lot with it , which is extremely unavoidable . 
  and obviously i understand that there 's going to have to be some sort of tradeoff weightwise , and if you 'll read my descriptions of the candidates i found , i called a 2kg laptop `` light '' , but i feel that for several thousand dollars i should really be able to find something that fits my needs . 
  the underpoweredness in general of the rugged laptop market is disappointing , although if it 's possible to swap the graphics card , then i 'm happy ( which is what you guys are for , to recommend stuff like that ) . 
  i do treat them with care in most situations , but i travel a lot , and damage is unavoidable then . 
  it looks good ( if a little overpriced and overfeatured ) , but what i 'm worried about is the hinges , and heat damage , and water damage , especially to the screen and kb . 
  i 'll try to get in touch with someone who 's had one for a while , and see how it 's held up . 
  thanks !, 
  i do n't think so , otherwise i 'd make perm a tribe . 
  what the question should really be is , `` is english or a closely related language the * main * language spoken '' or something like that . 
  with a separate category for countries where the only official language is english , in which case engrish is totally haram . 
  the goal is n't to reflect the target language 's grammar . 
  english with estonian grammar looks and sounds horrible . 
  not fun at all . 
  putting umlauts where they screw up the pronunciation might annoy you , but most readers have no idea how those letters are pronounced ; diacritics other than the ones used in their own language are just text decoration to them . 
  making the diacritics phonetically make sense is only optional . 
  it says :, 
   gives a ** `` flavor '' ** of native grammar and vocabulary . 
  it does n't say :, 
   uses the native grammar instead of the english grammar . 
  or anything similar . 
  it is super careful about that . 
  did you see any of the three quotes mentioning native grammar ? 
  good engrish has a flow and feel . 
  borrowing the native grammar wholesale fucks that up completely . 
  i dare you to write some engrish with estonian grammar that is both comprehensible and funny . 
  oh , wait , you ca n't . 
  i 'm not convinced that any inspiration at all from the native language 's grammar is a good thing . 
  you suggested not using `` of '' in estonian-inspired engrish . 
  what are you going to use instead ? 
  you ca n't just add '' - en '' or something to the end of an english word and expect people to understand it as the genitive . 
  edit : or , i guess , since this is a south finnic language , '' - ( j ) e '' . 
  oh my god , i played this a few years ago !, 
  kaizo hacks are a lot of fun if you have a lot of time and patience . 
  the complete co-opting of smw into a puzzle game is really impressive and one of the best things that ever happened to the genre . 
  although the fucking wall jumps are the worst thing , no thinking , just timing ... but everything else , awesome . 
  the edit 's close enough , dude . 
  a hungarian would n't get on my case if i referred to the hungarian genitive as '' - ja/je '' , despite that it can also be '' - a/e '' . 
  i do too know `` anything about grammar or languages '' , but that 's not really relevant here . 
  what 's relevant is that the shapes of other languages * ( like estonian ) * can be a poor fit for engrish . 
  how are you going to write comprehensible and funny engrish with a language with cases and postpositions ? 
  putting `` of '' after the word might work , except even that ends up kind of terrible a lot of the time when there 's another phrase following it . 
  ( tangent : our language family could have made pretty good engrish , actually , if we had n't borrowed a bunch of syntax from the ie languages in the past few centuries . 
  we did n't used to have conjunctions , and preferred verbal nouns instead . 
  while i have n't tried it , that sounds like good engrish to me . ), 
  i did n't even notice the arrow . 
  the wonders of mobile !, 
  honestly we should just fold ` zerodivisionerror ` into it :p,
