  blame the greeks , they were the ones with philippos, 
  it 's part of a broader central-eastern european mathematical sprachbund . 
  we call it that in hungarian , too . 
  this one 's pretty intuitive , though . 
  i have n't ever combed a hairy ball , but i can vividly picture not being able to comb it flat . 
  last time this was posted to / r/math , everyone agreed that he 's paying for the labor cost and not so much the ingredients , and therefore his argument is invalid . 
  ( everyone was also disappointed about the post not actually having to do with bt , so they did n't like it very much . ), 
  but imo , making two burritos is n't much more labor than double-wrapping one . 
  i do n't think a doubling of the price is warranted , except with the justification that `` the amount of labor is n't comparable anyway , so we 're going to peg the price to the number of burritos produced , for lack of a better plan . '', 
  it might not be weird in that it 's imaginary , but it 's definitely weird in that it 's got an infinite number of answers !, 
  but making a burrito is a routine task . 
  is it too much to assume that making two smaller burritos is not too different ? 
  also , another one of his friends is ryan north , who is taller than you . 
  oh my god that fish looks delicious for some reason, 
  besides the hashing stuff , i think they just want to make sure you do n't forget your password . 
  is n't * l'esprit * `` the spirit '' ? 
  if it 's just the previous 5 passwords , just reset it to 5 dummy passwords and then put in the password you want . 
  the worse situation is when it 's * any * password in the history of the account , like with google . 
  editing websites using your browser , and then taking screencaps of them . 
  ( but it only edits your copy of the page . 
  if you refresh it , it goes back to normal . ), 
  this could make a good advertising campaign against adblock . 
  why ? 
  times square looks super boring in this picture . 
  i wish i could use the internet to gain a simple understanding of how to make lo mein . 
  no matter how many articles i read on it , i never get better at it . 
  tl ; dr it 's simpler to just use one distro 's packages , the distro is n't as stable as it could be , and it 's probably one of the least secure distros out there . 
  i 'd personally add that managing packages from so many sources could probably get confusing and chaotic . 
  was gon na suggest this , glad to see someone 's beat me to it . 
  although as far as actual features go , it 's fairly generic ( other than the fact that it somehow spies on the user , which is to be expected ) . 
  the rest are unnecessary imo , which i guess is why someone cropped it in the first place . 
  creative url , but everybody can recognize dqw4 ... !, 
  also when she 's telling your sibling to go do something , suddenly it 's `` y' all go walk the dog . '', 
  and then of course it 's actually unnecessary for two people to go walk the dog at the same time , so * i * ended up doing it ... 
  i 'm starting to think my mother just did n't know how to conjugate verbs, 
  using two of the bits for palettes still counts as 8-bit imo . 
  well , the `` more stable '' distributions they list are debian and red hat , and arguably anything is relatively unstable compared to those two . 
  i swear it was a map in reach, 
  exactly , that one !, 
  yeah , this one looks like an unsuccessful troll, 
  it would be easier to go into reach and screenshot the map in a way that looks like your picture . 
  i found it by googling `` lua 3spooky '' as seen in the htop . 
  observe : the more socially acceptable way of saying `` repost ! '', 
  language games are n't specific to girls , but this one seems to be . 
  some countries always get the same joke over and over again irl . 
  the worst ones possibly are the homophones , like hungary and turkey . 
  `` solum humana '' is in the sense of `` the only human here '' and is declined wrong . 
  i 'd say `` homo modo '' , which has the bonus of rolling off the tongue nicely . 
  the phrase can also be translated `` just a person '' . 
  i think adverbs like * modo * can be either head-initial or head-final , but my impression is that when describing something , latin prefers head-initial constructions . 
  plus , in this case , * modo * is acting more as an adjective than an adverb , and we * all * know which head-directionality latin prefers for noun-adjective constructions . 
  ( also , even if head-final is the norm , the atypicality of the word order would call attention to the first element , which would be cool . 
  but i think head-initial is the idiomatic construction . ), 
  keep in mind that according to the repo , this is linux native , not cygwin !, 
  to be fair the entirety of hawaii ( counting all the atolls and stuff west of kauai ) is wider than mainland alaska by a fair margin, 
  the dude speaking japanese with his accent sounds vaguely like danorwegianish as certain points in the beginning . 
  i think it 's the intonation and how he keeps opening up his o 's, 
  i can do whatever i want with the damn islands and no one can stop me, 
  listen , if they did n't want me to count them , then they should have spoken up about it . 
  i 'm 99 % sure they secretly wanted it, 
  yeah , what ottomans ? 
  everyone knows they were eliminated in the early 1500s by the resurgent byzantine empire !, 
  i concur , there seems to be a distinct gap in her side too, 
  the difference is , the etymologies there are commonly known , and the original meaning is often used alongside the newer one . 
  ( especially with 4chan 's `` op is a faggot '' ~ `` op literally can not stop sucking dicks '' spectrum . ), 
  not many people know the etymology of `` fuckboy '' . 
  extremadura does n't have an independence movement ? 
  the world is full of surprises, 
  til samoyeds are also a kind of dog, 
  what language is this in ? 
  it sounds northernish germanic ... 
   this is because it 's still in beta . 
  there 's nothing inherent about it to necessarily make a 1.0 release any what lacking in stability . 
  if anything , it 's the opposite : bedrock linux is naturally resilient to things that would take more traditional distros down . 
  for example , if your init system breaks on a traditional distro you 're in trouble ; with bedrock linux , you can just boot with the init from another distro . 
  understood . 
  i pondered for a while how to phrase that part , because in essence what i got from the faq was `` it 's not as stable as debian or red hat , so if you are looking for a distro as stable as possible , use those instead . '', 
  that does n't sound like an actual con to me , more just a genuine warning as to what the distro is not the best for . 
  glad you could come and explain it further . 
   it 's just bedrock linux gives you the option to shoot yourself in the foot by getting stuff from wherever , while other more limited distros get some security benefits as a side-effect of the fact they do n't let you shoot yourself in the foot quite as easily . 
  personally , i 'd call that lack of security . 
  i do n't think * any * linux distro is particularly insecure out-of-the-box , besides my lfs distro from 2005 . :p, 
  my friend would just wake me up . 
  honestly i kinda still appreciate it, 
  how many seconds between each frame ? 
  is using convoluted means to get teeth out an american thing ? 
  when i wanted to get them out , i just grabbed and twisted , and as far as i was aware everyone else did the same thing . 
  but if you have excessive body hair , then you can make patterns out of it !, 
  is n't that cool ??

  i 'm fairly sure / \u025b\u0303 / is higher ( more close ) than / \u00e6 / ...

  when i watched the movie as a kid , i thought forrest was a genius . 
  i think it 's had a negative effect on me in the long run ... 
  this is bullshit - you 're oversimplifying a complex situation to the point of no longer adding anything useful to the discussion . 
  growing ? 
  in that case you 'd need `   ` , not `  ` , but i do n't think ` . exe ` files work that way anyway . 
  this is n't rocket science . 
  there 's a reason pr and marketing is n't just `` present your position honestly '' . 
  having a stallman beard * does * make people associate him with people who have socially unacceptable lifestyles , and it * does * make him less widely appealing .
