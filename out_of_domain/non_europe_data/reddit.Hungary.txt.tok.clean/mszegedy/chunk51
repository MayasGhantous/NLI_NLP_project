  i can only assume it refers to the event the memory is based on , rather than the reliving of the memory itself . 
  is the `` bach double concerto '' the one in d minor ? 
  or , uh , it starts on d. i ca n't remember whether it 's actually d minor . 
  ah , so you remember that thread as well . 
  nokias used to be a running gag here .

  wow .

  ] ( / sgt ), 
  [ gt : what ? 
  ] ( / sgt ), 
  [ gt : i mean ... what ? 
  whos jack ? 
  ] ( / sgt ), 
  personally i think splinter!dirk was just fucking with him , though . 
  why would they make more accounts , then ? 
  or what if jake is actually meenah, 
  is n't it `` muphry '' ? 
  could n't they just have been liars or people trying too hard ? 
  i do n't think i have the choice of * not * doing it , seeing how on board the superintendent is !, 
  hmm , that might just be a bad implementation . 
  they were introduced a year or two ago at a school i know , and as far as i know they work perfectly . 
  they are used with the upper middle schoolers as an occasional thing for class , like to view a particular video and discuss it in small groups , or to have a couple people take notes on a particular lesson . 
  here , though , i think he wants to use them to replace textbooks , which might backfire in the manner you described . 
  i love how it actually fits along with the bedrock . 
  maybe it actually deleted blocks ? 
  if so , maybe you can find a way to the void ? 
  who got the mouths ? 
  or under that . 
  exactly how many panels do you want this to go on for ? 
  over 9000 ? 
  wants that . 
  nobody even wants to hear the phrase `` over 9000 . '', 
  the entire point of karkat 's blood is that it is red . 
  how is it supposed to do that ? 
  hussie will somehow be indebted with more pages than currently compose homestuck , and ... and ... be challenged to write as many pages as can be multiplied by itself to reproduce the current number of pages ? 
  wait , that 's - x - \u221a - x. 
  that 's a complex number . 
  shit . 
  if jack starts pissing everywhere , i 'm gon na be ... really annoyed . 
  not even stone ? 
  lack of punctuation --  ambiguity --  win,
