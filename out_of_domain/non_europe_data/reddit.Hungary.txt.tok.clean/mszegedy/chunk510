  it 's not that everyone 's dumb . 
  it 's more that most of everyone will never find out much more about stallman than his photo , and will never think about him much more than `` dude has a crazy beard '' . 
  who 's to say ours are objectively better ? 
  that is where small pockets of turkic people ( tatars in particular ) live . 
  i guess the idea is [ living place of any altaic people ] = greater turkey, 
  not only that , you can claim most of the world , where the indo-european language family is spoken , as well as places where languages are spoken whose families are spuriously related to ie , such as uralic . 
  ( we 're not related to you , fuck off . ), 
  and turkic is n't related at all to tungusic , yet the turanists include the evenki lands . 
  \\  fish, 
  this is sami erasure, 
  wonderful , your success story with i3 gives me strength to try it . 
  i do n't like the look of chrome though . 
  how does one get rid of the ugly cutoff ? 
  that 's different . 
  sri lanka is in india ( the * indian region * for pedants ) . 
  romania is in europe . 
  everybody knows europe . 
  not many people know india . 
  and not many of them are on this website .

  edit : why the hell does support for combining diacritics suck everywhere , it 's 2015 guys and everybody in the industry knows about this problem, 
  if a person who believes people are jealous of karma can exist , so can people who are jealous of karma, 
  china does n't write my rendering engine, 
  i thought i 've seen every possible internet pedant, 
  edit : the pedants replying to this post , i 've already seen the type of , so thank you for trying to add to the catalog , but i 've already got you thanks, 
  well , in hungary , transylvania is regarded as the stronghold of protestantism ( the rest of us are catholic ) , so it 's not too far off . 
  still weird though . 
  honestly i always identified shakespeare 's `` bohemia '' as aragon . 
  the geography fits , and of course so do the close ties with naples . 
  `` polixenes '' even sounds vaguely aragonese . 
  but dual monarchy is one king over two states , not two kings over two states , is n't it ? 
  i just assumed it 's oil, 
  still , the revolutionaries felt pretty betrayed for some reason . 
  you 're a plurality though, 
  should n't the cat be able to smell him ? 
  hugely impressive . 
  given that this is eu4 , `` semper '' would be more accurate here :p, 
  but anyway 8/10 still better than modern india . 
  if sind were cleaned up the entirety of asia would be better than modern times , except maybe indochina, 
  mr. bigs are far more common in canada than the us . 
  ( we have them in hungary too , though . ), 
  for everyone , this is incredibly accurate, 
  that is a sexy scandinavia . 
  needs more sami though, 
  assembly 's fine , fortran can go suck a cock ( although i hear it 's not actually bad once you 're used to it ) . 
  i wish voyager had been a lisp machine instead , that 's one ancient programming language i 'd love to maintain code for, 
  you only started noticing it a year ago . 
  unnecessarily screenshotting things is as old as screenshotting itself, 
  this is a place to relax . 
  i 'm fine with relaxed titles . 
  sadly i do n't think we 'll see technology like that in our lifetimes, 
  hungary thanks you for getting the kingdom borders right, 
  nooo , that ca n't be it ... 
  i know , but given the circumstances ... 
  not even stack exchange websites can manage that, 
  eugh , i did n't think there were any adherents to gg&s here . 
  you know most historians hate that book , right ? 
  anthropologists are generally fine with it ; it 's historians who take issue with his methodology ( or lack of a rigorous one thereof ) . 
  i can only find published responses to * collapse * , and not gg&s , but they cover much of the same ground . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/36rkdi/has_jared_diamond_ever_engaged_with_the_heaps_of_criticism_on_his_guns_germs_and_steel/crgmqds ) a list of them ; i 'd recommend * questioning collapse * also . 
  if you 're just looking to get a general overview of what historians think about it , then / r/askhistorians actually has a [ section ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/wiki/historians_views#wiki_historians.27_views_of_other_historians ) dedicated to that . 
  also , / r/badhistory does single-chapter dissections sometimes , like [ chapter 11 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2cfhon/guns_germs_and_steel_chapter_11_lethal_gift_of/ ) and [ chapter 3 ( long one ) ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2bv2yf/guns_germs_and_steel_chapter_3_collision_at/ ) . 
  mind you , i [ wrote up ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/2lpe5o/mod_idea_a_more_reductionist_approach_to_culture/ ) a better tech system as well ages ago . 
  it 's just that any time i hear anyone mention ggs positively , i 'm horrified , because eurocentrism should be gone by now . 
   they just take issue with his removal of human agency from the question of , `` why did europeans invade as opposed to the other way around ? '', 
  actually , i think i know which comment you got this from . 
  this is by far not the only problem with his works . 
  try the [ chapter 3 dissection ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2bv2yf/guns_germs_and_steel_chapter_3_collision_at/ ) from / r/badhistory , it 's really entertaining , and it gives a much better sense of what makes his view of colonialism so skewed . 
  bass ( ii ) reporting in , no note is too low for me . 
  i think i understand what creaky voice is in theory and can produce it pretty well on demand , but i do n't think i 've ever heard it . 
  on the other hand , i 'm very familiar with quotative `` like '' and uptalk , which are generally criticized alongside vocal fry . 
  what am i missing here ? 
  unrelatedly , how do you sing a song in a language in which creaky voice phonation is phonemic ? 
  that would be terrible, 
  finally , someone harasses someone other than women for oh fuck it this is worse . 
  thankfully , op is ottomans , so i guess that 's the confounding element here . 
  historical moments in polandball : the first recorded comic where the inversion of poland 's flag actually works against the joke . 
  yeah , reddit wo n't be up forever . 
  information gets wiped off the face of the internet surprisingly fast , though , even considering attrition you can account for over time ( like websites not getting maintained anymore ) ; it was pretty jarring , for example , when megaupload got taken down . 
  i 'd assume the immortals were interfering with the spell, 
  mind you , corsican * is * fairly phonologically conservative , but it 's no more latin than any other romance language, 
  the logic of it is understandable : people from those subs are far more likely to bring their prejudice here than not ; the ban is preemptive . 
  but honestly blanket tactics like this are only warranted for actually big subs , not relatively small ones like this one where there 's only two new threads every day . 
  if the ability of the mods to keep up with the content is stressed , it 's because there are n't enough mods , not because their policies are too personal/case-by-case . 
  smbc [ also did one ] ( http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3799 ) ( the floabc comic predates it though ), 
  in true dw fashion , it would probably be resolved by an event that forces them to leave anyways, 
  why would n't they use a dummy ? 
  they need someone to activate the chute ? 
  this is why every modern slavic country is a wasteland, 
  ah , i * am * confusing it with sardinian . 
  then honestly i do n't know anything about corsican , although i 'd expect it to have most of the same areal developments as sardinian . 
  from the first episode , in fact, 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sardinian_language#phonology ) has a brief overview of archaic features preserved in sardinian . 
  i 'd say the most interesting one is preservation of the velars ; this is already a more conservative treatment of consonants than most romance languages , although they do have that annoying retroflex consonant < dd  , as well as a number of fairly typical sound changes . 
  you say the game is not a historical simulator , but you describe what happens as though it were a simulated history . 
  the game is a game . 
  if it looks like history , that 's because it was made to look like it . 
  the question of whether to make the game look like history in particular ways is generally an aesthetic one ( for example , there are not many universal gameplay ramifications of having russia colonize the philippines instead of spain ) . 
  we generally prefer to make it look like history as much as possible , because it gives a sense of direction for the flavor of the game . 
  i personally do n't feel strongly about the game looking like history ; that would be like complaining that a game of monopoly does n't accurately simulate the stock market .
