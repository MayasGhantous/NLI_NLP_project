  but i would n't be opposed to this change . 
  after all , if we 're going to add mechanics or minor features to the game , why not this one ? 
  using asterisks to emphasize predates using them for italics . 
  see [ the jargon file 's description ] ( http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/writing-style.html ) of the usage . 
  this article was written in 1991 , 13 years before markdown was invented ( and only a couple months before civilization was invented ) . 
  i believe the first markup language to use asterisks for emphasis was [ setext , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/setext ) from 1992 , although it used it for bolding , not italics . 
  the adoption of setext by usenet popularized the idea of putting emphatic characters in markup languages , and it also taught new users to use emphatic characters in general . 
  generally , before markup languages became common , ` / text / ` used to be interpreted as faking italics , ` * text * ` ( and ` ~ text ~ ` , ` ! text ! ` , ` @text @ ` , etc. ), 
  used to be interpreted as generally emphasizing text , and ` _ text _ ` used to be interpreted as faking underlining . 
  then markdown became common and now the paradigm has shifted . 
  although , emacs org-mode still uses ` / ` for italics , ` * ` for bold , and ` _ ` for underline . 
  where does one read more about this ? 
  there seems to be no centralized list of exploits, 
  that would be really cool , yeah !, 
  i 'm still hoping to uncover an exploit community or a lasting exploit database though, 
  the point of camping is to avoid paying for a hotel . 
  super mario is an allegory for the struggle between stalin and trotsky, 
  but it 's not !, 
  the people who live there clearly have more in common with the japanese ( or the ainu anyway ) than the russians !, 
  maybe it should just be independent ( or independent-ish , like greenland ) . 
  edit : itt : people who do n't understand that i was talking about eu4-era sakhalin . 
  you 're right , modern sakhalin is disgustingly russian and modern hokkaido is disgustingly japanese . 
  incredibly cool , but where are the rebels from ... ? 
  no , it 's far worse, 
  most of japan appears to be descended from the ainu though . 
  and in the game 's timespan , hokkaido is still ainu . 
  not during the game !, 
  but you 're right , nowadays it 's mostly full of russians . 
  bit ridiculous honestly , europeans are like an infection . 
  eww , needs a nice nzxt case, 
  edit : joking . 
  but , does n't the inner pc builder in some of you irrationally go , `` for god 's sake why are all of those parts uncovered ? '', 
  if my experience is worth anything , you 're not in a very happy place right now , and this gave your emotions an outlet . 
  hope you 're okay man . 
  that sounds * hard *, 
  could be worse, 
  fuck , being hungarian is worse . 
  we 're the only uralic people who regularly die from heatwaves . 
  most of asia has one big areal tendency to be agglutinative , and to have topic-comment structure . 
  this determines a lot of things about the rest of the structure of a language , which makes everything else more similar . 
  so yes . 
  so close ? 
  or berber , or even slavic, 
  edit : i forgot the most important one , nux\u00e1lk or the salishan languages in general, 
  not in `` fiai\u00e9i '' . 
  hungarian is the go-to example for languages with many consecutive vowels for people who do n't know about finnish . 
  100 rebels in iberia ? 
  or where ? 
  that 's the main problem with * regular * construction . 
  when you 're building something the size of a death star , materials start to become an issue . 
  someone probably owns those asteroids . 
  are you just going to claim them as eminent domain or something ? 
  i mean , why 's it only japan everyone cares about ? 
  sri lanka and the philippines are missing , for one . 
  ( and everybody always forgets palawan in particular for some reason . 
  randall munroe 's `` map drawn by americans who turned out to be unexpectedly good at geography '' left it out , my bedsheets in college did n't have it , most maps in / r/shittymapporn leave it out ... i do n't know what makes palawan so invisible but it is . ), 
  for that matter , if you believe michael fortescue , the eskimo-aleut languages are so recently crossed that it 's possible to link them to the uralic languages . 
  nice job hedging with `` most '' ; if you had n't included it then * empire * would have been a counterexample , not to mention all those `` planet earth '' films, 
  spot on, 
  god damn , can this guy write any less clearly ? 
  so , what , he 's saying that since the greeks loaned it as / b / , it could n't have been / w / ? 
  never mind that he lists the loans with / u / * right afterwards , * why ca n't greek loan / w / as / b / ? 
  and as to the `` inverted f '' comment , has this guy ever heard of [ the digamma/waw ? 
  edit : / u / , not / o /, 
  oi , we * make fun of * smug pricks . 
  but nah bad linguistics just makes us really angry or entertained, 
   arguably the most-used conjugation, 
  nah , that is n't it, 
  yes . 
  asl is generally thought of as a creole between martha 's vineyard sign language and french sign language , whereas bsl belongs to a different family entirely . 
  the fact that there 's a relatively large number of signs cognate between asl and bsl ( about 30 % iirc ) is astounding imo . 
  dunno , i always thought the language 's name was nux\u00e1lk and never questioned it . 
  [ the wikipedia article on the salishan languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salishan_languages ) has it as `` nux\u00e1lk '' , although the article on the language itself does n't seem to have the diacritic anywhere . 
  thankfully , `` he had in his possession a bunchberry plant '' is a complete sentence . 
  but iirc / ou / only recently became / u / , did n't it ? 
  [ everything in it is literally in the `` classification '' section of the wikipedia article on asl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_sign_language#classification ), 
  although apparently recent research suggests asl is n't very creole-like , at least not anymore . 
  sorry , i thought the creole thing was fairly uncontroversial . 
  the way i 've read `` cognate '' used in literature , borrowings being `` cognate '' to stuff is fine , at the very least as long as the borrowing was of an earlier form . 
  wiktionary uses it this way often ; it will note , for example , that hungarian `` eszik '' and finnish `` sy\u00f6d\u00e4 '' are `` cognate '' to english `` chew '' , on account of an early borrowing from pie ( or was it proto-balto-slavic ? ), 
  for someone who actually knows se asia 's larger islands , it should n't be that hard . 
  malayndonesia is made of five parts ( minus western papua ) : the peninsula , sumatra ( and the andamans ) , borneo , java ( and bali and co. ) , and sumatra ( and the moluccas ) . 
  then there 's papua . 
  then there 's the philippines and taiwan ; taiwan is in one piece , while the philippines is made up of luzon , the visayas , mindanao ( and the sulu islands ) , * and palawan * ( considered part of the luzon region ) . 
  like , if you 're gon na go to the effort to get every single one of the other large islands right , what 's stopping you from getting palawan in particular ? 
  i see otherwise perfectly okay maps that are missing palawan , like the xkcd one i mentioned . 
  if you think of it all as a blobby mess , then you make mistakes with the other islands , too . 
  but people seem to leave palawan * and only palawan * out . 
  maybe it has to do with shitty mapmakers copying each others ' shitty maps , and it just being a mistake perpetuated throughout the shitty mapmaking industry for decades . 
  although , often irl large muscles on young men look * swollen * instead of buff, 
  funnily enough new jersey is independent ... 
  this is , what , the second time they 've changed the registry system in the past two years ? 
  lmao * see to it that you do .

  poe 's law says a parody will eventually look like the source . 
  but at that point , what makes it parody ? 
  knuth thinks it 's possible p = np , but the polynomial times associated with hard problems would be uselessly vast anyway . 
  in that case , not much changes in crypto from a practical standpoint even if a constructive proof is found .
