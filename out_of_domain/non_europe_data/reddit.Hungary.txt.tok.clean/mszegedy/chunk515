  ed is generous enough to flag errors , yet prudent enough not to overwhelm the novice with verbosity . 
  yeah , the reason i love that segment in particular so much is that it almost perfectly mimics my first ` ed ` session ( asking for help -  pressing enter -  trying to quit using `` quit '' and `` exit '' -  cussing out the editor -  trying to quit using \\ ^ c and \\ ^ d ) aside from finally remembering that vim is built on ` ed ` commands and successfully using `` q '' to quit . 
  although i think i started cussing out the editor * after * \\ ^ d did n't work . 
  ext3 ? 
  what 's wrong with ext4 ? 
  it looks exactly like yuan-era chinese seals , such as [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/phagspa_imperial_edict_dragon_year.jpg ) or [ this one , ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/ghazanseal1302lettertobonifaceviii.jpg ) and by extension most seals of mongolian dynasties , like [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/imperial_seal_of_bogd_khan.jpg ) from the last mongolian khagan , bogd khan , whose reign began in 1911 .

  what the fuck ? 
  ( everyone calls them that ), 
  youtube managed to figure out and recommend that to me, 
  dna is closer to machine code/assembly , but arguably i 'd forget the computer analogy on that level , since the dna is usually describing the structure of an rna or protein , which does n't fit into the computer analogy . 
  epigenetics is kind of like computer code , but even then it 's its own flavor of regulatory system , which i 'd compare most closely to neural nets . 
  wait , are n't these usually read, 
  i dunno about the responses in this thread , i do n't think computer code is an appropriate analogy at all for dna . 
  dna generally describes a structure , while computer code is a series of commands . 
  it 's true that dna is also technically a series of commands , to build a structure , but that 's not a meaningful similarity , since that 's vastly different from the sorts of commands computers contain ( which are a turing-complete set of tools for manipulating data ) . 
  yes , the resulting structures often manipulate molecules , `` data '' , but that 's like saying a schematic for a tool and the toolmaker are together ( like ) a computer . 
  technically right , but uselessly vague . 
  what does * emerge * from the * interaction * of these structures created by dna ( and the regions of dna that deal with epigenetics , like promoters ) is a lot more like a computer ( but not so much like computer * code * ) , with structural elements passing messages to each other and reacting to certain environmental factors . 
  but even then it 's a decentralized concurrent sort of interaction of very simple elements in a very complex network that is n't really present in computing apart from neural net stuff . 
  even message-passing haskell modules are individually a lot more complex , and in a system a lot less complex , than any epigenetic element . 
  and at that point you can just abstract away the dna anyway , so it 's not like the dna itself is `` like computer code '' . 
  i 'd say at no point does anything in biology really resemble computing as programmers know it , with a series of commands being executed by one or more processors/interpreters to manipulate some sort of `` data '' in complex ways . 
  there * are * things that resemble neural nets and therefore computers in general ( like epigenetics , and the nervous system 's literal neural net ) , but those are very nonstandard and structurally totally different from what most people think of when they think of `` computer * code * '' . 
  but anyway i think most people here are thinking specifically of translation , which i do n't think is even like a computer , never mind computer code . 
  in the late victorian era ( or maybe the early 20th century ? 
  ) , the human brain was described as similar to a factory , since they had `` stuff goes in , stuff comes out ( continuously ) '' in common . 
  nowadays we see the comparison as a little naive , because we can instead describe it as a computer , since they have the more specific `` data goes in , data comes out ( continuously ) '' in common . 
  i 've heard this shift in perspective criticized as essentially being the result of changing `` fads '' ; that is , since factories were the big thing around 1900 , the brain was modeled as a factory , while since computers are the big thing around 2000 , the brain is now modeled as a computer . 
  i think this idea is kind of ridiculous , since the computational model is clearly an improvement over the original interpretation , and has led to great advances in both the fields of neuroscience and computer science . 
  translation is like a computer in that data goes in , but it 's unlike a computer in that data does n't come out . 
  let 's not fuel the idea that we 're prone to use `` hip '' models by needlessly describing a `` data goes in '' process as a computer when there 's more apt ( but less hip ) comparisons available . 
  man , they could be going about this so much better . 
  * first * you have to come up with a wide variety of bodies you 'd want to test the form on . 
  this will give you a means for deriving metrics that tell you how good your form is : the combined sexiness of trying it on the different bodies , the uniformity of the sexiness of trying it on the different bodies , etc. 
  you do n't just wing it !, 
  ohh that makes much more sense, 
  i 'd assume it 's just easier to use the isp 's shell than to try and install your own, 
  am i going blind , or is this actually a watercolor painting ? 
  i do n't mind the growth . 
  now , when i encounter a problem , chances are someone 's already found a workaround . 
  depends on the linux you use , though . 
  although with expertise , perspective , and possibly preparation , even arch can become a simpler install than windows . 
  i wish this were universally true , but sometimes they 'll just write , `` oh , i fixed it !, 
  you just have to baz the qux '' , and you have to figure out what that exactly means . 
  more often than not it 'll be something you think you understand pretty well -- `` you just have to install and configure the dkms version of the module '' or something , but then you do it how you thought it 's done , and that does n't fix your problem and you 're left wondering if you did it wrong or if your problem is of a different nature . 
  there are n't afaik ( most superhero geeks are fans of both ) , but the marvel and dc universes are very different , and every fan is acutely aware of the distinction between the two . 
  i once heard it summed up as , `` dc comics are about heroes trying to be people . 
  marvel comics are about people trying to be heroes . '', 
  dc is spectacle and fights between beings of incredible power . 
  dc characters ' most developed identities tend to be their masked ones . 
  on the other hand , marvel characters are , on the whole , an order of magnitude less powerful than dc characters , and a greater part of the dramatic tension comes from interpersonal stuff rather than hero stuff . 
  by far the most developed part of any marvel character is their civilian identity , and the mask is a much thinner layer over that . 
  mind you , this is by no means the only interpretation , and it 's entirely possible that someone will swoop in and write an essay refuting it . 
  but it 's a widely understood one , and i 'm sticking to it . 
  high * equality * ; inequality lowers your ihdi, 
  oh , it 's proto-germanic , i know this !, 
  here , let me try to communicate :, 
  it 's old old old icelandic . 
  also old old old english . 
  i ca n't understand your second sentence . 
  thank you, 
  but bacalhau the food is the dried and salted cod , right ? 
  it looks disgusting, 
  huh , so they actually * were * able to win some engagements ? 
  oh , wait , austro - * german * , never mind, 
  once they catch on , social media will be filled with this exact pun . 
  did you come up with it ? 
  ( so that i can feel suitably hipster when the time comes ), 
  are you kidding ? 
  they take almost a minute to load , of course we noticed . 
  wait , what 's going on in this thread ? 
  this design was replaced approximately yesterday . 
  why do people hate it all of a sudden ? 
  they do n't , usually . 
  this one just happened to get framed that way .

  i do n't know about general relativity , but that 's not how newtonian orbital mechanics work, 
  but it does n't really count , since that 's what the humans captured them for !,

  what was the coptic church doing in ireland ? 
  the difference is , not all of britain was iced over in the last glacial maximum , just the upper half, 
  possibly introduced by settlers !, 
  would n't put it past them . 
  although that makes me wonder how snakes managed to never get introduced to ireland .

  she 's probably the kid of a beggar and/or refugee . 
  i doubt she 's too familiar with the concept, 
  yeah , that 's the whole point of a compiler . 
  and nobody hand-optimizes in 2015 anyway, 
  is n't germany where the turks live ? 
  and are n't turks just another way of referring to arabs ? 
  but the hydraulic analogy is the single most common one . 
  the comic 's supposed to be making fun of idiotic homebrewed analogies for electric current . 
  the hydraulic analogy , meanwhile , has been in use for centuries and has given generations of students a rudimentary understanding of electricity .
