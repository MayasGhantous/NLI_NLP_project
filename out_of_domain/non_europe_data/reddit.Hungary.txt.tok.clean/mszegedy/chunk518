  to be fair , the americas do this to our planet too . 
  they 're just not so ... linear . 
  i like 50 . 
  fuck you , pacific ocean !, 
  we want land !, 
  oops , did n't see the first ` windows.exe ` i think , i see what you 're getting at, 
  r , or something newer and hipper that fills the same niche . 
  it might be useful to learn a language from southeast asia that acts as a lingua franca for a large region . 
  i recommend indonesian malay ( for malayndonesia and brunei ) or tok pisin ( for papua ) . 
  ( the philippines mostly knows english already , so no worries there . 
  in my experience , speaking tagalog gets you a discount , though . ), 
  if just homestuck migrated to html5 , i 'd be happy . 
  i 'd hate for one of my favorite works to be based on an obsolete technology . 
  ( maybe someone can adapt it ? ), 
  i see it as a computer-assisted boardgame, 
  june ... 1st . 
  almost !, 
  how bad are his burns ? 
  have we adopted anything from fp * other * than the good bits ? 
  having a few fp constructs/functions ( lambda , map , reduce ) does n't make your language functional . 
  clearly * someone * has n't memorized every fetish in existence yet !, 
  this will buy you ~ 2 eu4 dlcs / vent, 
  the game 's far off from being even remotely realistic , so i do n't think `` realism '' is a talking point . 
  instead , do the rebels make the game more fun , and maybe more immersive ? 
  i think so . 
  just steamrolling over eurasia gets boring . 
  quick , which stereotype do the tzynn fit ? 
  i 'm going with the american upper class . 
   learn the difference between various types of onions, 
  you mean garlic vs scallions vs the round ones , or do you mean red onions vs white onions ? 
  unfortunately the difference only matters if you have a silk touch pickaxe . 
  ( or if it 's somehow more practical for you to place smooth stone like this rather than just use a furnace on cobble . ), 
  huh , til . 
  this may actually end up saving me time !,

  sarkozy ( `` s\u00e1rk\u00f6zy '' ) in english is `` from between the mud '' ( more precisely , `` from ( the village of ) s\u00e1rk\u00f6z '' , where `` s\u00e1rk\u00f6z '' translates to `` between the mud '' ) . 
  i guess it made sense at the time , but now it 's a pretty hilarious name for a politician . 
  yes and they taste disgusting . 
  central europe has some of the shittiest regional products ever . 
  the good ones are :, 
  - ( good ) fanta , all around, 
  that 's it , the rest is fucking garbage, 
  honestly , ukip 's britain just sounds like ... historical britain , minus the empire . 
  europe 's isolated zoo of socially backwards snobs . 
  jello used to be a really popular food in the us . 
  i guess it stuck with utah ? 
  the atp should by far have run out by now . 
  there is a ridiculously small amount of atp in such a small amount of flesh , and a ridiculously small amount of energy in one molecule . 
  that said , ca n't offer any other explanation . 
  you can activate nerves with salt ( and cardiac tissue does n't even need that ) , but contractions need an actual power source . 
   calling melanesians `` black '', 
  you are fucking terrible at racism, 
  to be fair , mg is a non sequitur there , unless you meant it as an example of a nominated game , in which case it should have been something like , '' ... as , ** say , ** mgsv '' . 
  that said :, 
  - i 'm not enthralled by the undertale soundtrack either ; the good parts are basically the boss themes and the waterfall ambiance music , the rest is uninteresting if cute . 
  i 'd say it 's still better than the mgsv soundtrack , which has even less good music, 
  - those awards are kind of a joke anyway, 
  tfw your history only starts when you come into contact with the europeans, 
  with undertale , a wide range of people seem to love the soundtrack in particular . 
  i think op ( and i ) just have different taste from them . 
  specifically the masks of the [ toa mahri ] ( http://biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/toa_mahri ), 
  exactly . 
  - step 0 : inherit burgundy, 
  - step 1 : inherit hungarian throne, 
  - step 2 : immediately lose nearly all hungarian land to the turks, 
  - step 3 : play the european balance of power game, 
  personally , i 'm looking for the type safety of python , the speed of scala , and the ease of c. 
  sh , anglophones ca n't pronounce that easily anyway, 
  i doubt that analysis was what the writers of the passage were going for when they wrote it . 
  heaven sounds surprisingly hot , though . 
  why ca n't my laptop have this kind of keyboard ? 
  i 'd prefer it so much to the shitty membrane keyboard i have right now . 
  it was a joke about imagining a language that eschews usability and safety for speed , chill, 
  st nicholas was `` roman '' insofar as he lived in the roman empire , so there 's that . 
  wait what ? 
  no it is n't . 
  exactly , although you need a lot of money for this to be an option, 
  it 's well withing op 's budget , yes , but what i 'm saying is that it 's not a universal exploit . 
  i know * i * do n't usually have 0.6 % of my manpower in ducats . 
  it was too shitty a joke to believe it 's a joke, 
  is the beat meant to be so sparse ? 
  most of it is `` silence '' . 
  not in , say , hungary . 
  we have `` log '' or `` lg '' for log10 , while natural log is `` ln '' . 
  although academic articles might have `` log '' for natural log . 
  the best is the field of theoretical computer science , where the base of the logarithm usually does n't matter , because it 's in a big o expression . 
  google translate ? 
  yeah , but did he use google translate on it ? 
  `` niemcy '' comes from the old common slavic word for `` mute '' . 
  because germany is full of idiots who ca n't speak slavic . 
  `` mute '' in polish is `` niemy '' . 
  the weird scale * is * what i 'd call `` cartoonish '' , though . 
  like you 're playing with toys ( with unbreakable landing legs ) rather than rockets . 
  wait , what ? 
  taught sign language in what sense ? 
  as far as i know we know , there 's no animal with the linguistic capability of humans . 
  koko does n't use grammar . 
  that 's not `` knows sign language '' . 
  i guess `` can recognize signs '' is a plausible interpretation of the phrase in this context . 
  no it is n't,
