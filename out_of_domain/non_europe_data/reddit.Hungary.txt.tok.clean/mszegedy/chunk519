  what 's the elephant in the room ? 
  something to do with the fact that sarah used to date elliot ? 
  ohh . 
  it makes sense to say sportsball here because we 're sort of looking at it from a redditor 's perspective . 
  also we do n't know what sport they 're playing, 
  wait he forgot a thing,

  i 'm a pretty big one though . 
  a tapeworm 's brain has more cells than the first several stages of a zygote .

  `` ancaps '' is pretty broad, 
  why ? 
  you may want to take a look at these previous threads on this topic :, 
  - [ how did the basques maintain their language through roman occupation and influence , and up until the modern era ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3ir0b2/how_did_the_basques_maintain_their_language/ ),

  - [ considering the length of time the basque area was under roman rule why is their culture/language so different from their neighbors ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/19h9wp/considering_the_length_of_time_the_basque_area/ ), 
  the consensus seems to be that the mountainous geography of basque country played a large role . 
  in the first thread , / u/tiako and / u/keyilan note that mountainous regions are historically good at preserving linguistic diversity , and compare basque to paleo-sardinian , another non-ie language and possible language isolate spoken in a mountainous area that became extinct in the 2nd century ad or so . 
  the ie languages did n't start encroaching into the urheimhat of the uralic languages ( being western siberia and thereabouts ) until the russians started colonizing the area in the 16th and 17th centuries , and the magyars only migrated to europe a little over a thousand years ago . 
  it 's completely unremarkable that the uralic languages still exist , except to the extent that they did n't get wiped out by a nomad invasion at some point ( although , to be fair , they would probably be far more diverse if the mongols had n't invaded eurasia ; the magyars alone had [ several contingents in asia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_hungarians ) documented by friar julian that were completely wiped out by the mongols , and the pannonian magyars themselves were nearly so ) . 
  the ie invasions simply did n't push into siberia . 
  it 's short for `` gasoline '' . 
  no one 's impressed with `` lel americans speak dum '' . 
  there 's a lot of poor parts , we 're grateful for it, 
  i ca n't believe this is not in hungary . 
  our cuisine is very meat-heavy ( and paprika heavy ) and this would find its home fast in some sort of folk festival . 
  funnily enough hungarians and finns are welcome , however . 
  they 're not very good at being racist ; they 're pretty much http://i.imgur.com/u8sifd4.jpg, 
  it is . 
  it 's also a broader central european ( i.e. 
  former hre ) thing as well ; my family is hungarian and we do this . 
  now that they mention it , a christmas song describing the christmas shopping experience would be kind of nice . 
  but not like this ... not like this ... 
  and it turns out he 's just a clone of falco, 
  edit : actually , of samus . 
  he could alternate between ahab 's crosshairs eridan and science wwand eridan like samus alternates between zss and samus . 
  and smw was half a mb . 
  and your image is compressed badly , it should be under 2 kb . 
  you could say you 've conquered everything that was formerly under a glacier 20k years ago , but then iberia happened ... well anyway , glory to perm !,

  i 'm assuming we 'll make another thread then, 
  [ ] \\ ( / caucasian ), 
  i do , but that 's because i get rid of the preceding / n / and nasalize the preceding vowel instead . 
  in sae , there 's a consonant directly adjoining it , so it would be [ d ] . 
  * that 's * why !, 
  the dymaxion projection is alright if you want to pretend that sailing and flight are completely irrelevant to why you 're looking at the map, 
   blue horde, 
  the g\u00f6kt\u00fcrks ? 
  as much as i like this ... / r/shittytumblrgifs, 
  the jitteriness of the short periods of the gifs is just so jarring . 
  ( this is gon na get buried is n't it ), 
  counterpoint : i 've been using a thinkpad for years now and i feel that it 's pretty flimsy and low-powered . 
  - the case is made of plastic , like any other laptop 's . 
  it 's way vulnerable to cracking on impact , especially the back corners . 
  as we speak the back left vent on my laptop is destroyed . 
  - the roll cage is n't effective , and is pretty small . 
  when i bought a 2tb hard drive ( that was a little thicker or something ) , it only fit if i did n't put the rubber siding on . 
  even then that part of the laptop now bulges with a big seam . 
  - the keyboard is shit . 
  it 's in one flimsy piece held in by a couple easily bent pegs . 
  the keys are just another membrane keyboard with no real substance to them , and the enter key is n't highlighted like on the older tps . 
  i wish i could have a keyboard that 's like a desktop 's keyboard , like 90s laptops used to have . 
  - the discrete graphics card is mid-tier at best , and drains the battery in two hours at most . 
  with integrated graphics , the laptop lasts five hours . 
  ( the battery 's lost 12 % of its capacity by now anyway . ), 
  - changing the hdd and ram is pretty easy , but god help you if you want to clean the fan , or install a new processor . 
  you 'll have to basically take apart the whole thing , and there 's little hope that you 'll put it back together right . 
  strong points :, 
  - metal hinges . 
  the corners may break , but they 're not essential ; the hinges are . 
  they wo n't break , although the plastic holding them in place might . 
  - large screen . 
  1600x900 pixels is the * minimum * you 'd expect from a laptop in this era . 
  unlike many , the thinkpad actually meets this standard . 
  - two graphics `` cards '' ( one of them is ig ) . 
  while the battery 's kind of shit , the power savings are still immense . 
  nice way to get gaming-tier power without sacrificing battery life . 
  - while the case breaks fairly easily , it still does so less often than in less well-built laptops . 
  - extensible ; the optical drive is replaceable , the hard drive is replaceable ( poorly ) , and there 's a slot for an msata sdd . 
  - extended warranty covers practically every form of damage , and allows unlimited repairs . 
  just make sure to eschew responsibility . 
  i 'd give it 6.5 / 10 . 
  next laptop i 'm buying will be rugged or semi-rugged . 
  still trying to decide which one . 
  the downside to the truly rugged ones is that , as badass as they are , they 're usually really heavy , have low-powered components , have a shitty rubbery membraney watertight keyboard , and occasionally have shit battery life , not to mention a tiny screen . 
  it seems there is no such thing as a thinkpad made out of metal with a better graphics card and bigger battery . 
  ( and rubber sealing and a less shitty keyboard . ), 
  ah the switcharoo, 
  mrrico , in keeping with berber customs, 
  and once again , trans people do n't exist :(, 
  it really does, 
  does it need to be ?
