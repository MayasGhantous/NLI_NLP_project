  ahh . 
  how did liberal/conservative enter into this ? 
  and why does everyone have to have an `` agenda '' ? 
  and they are paid just the same as the good ones . 
  finally , someone says it . 
  with the apostrophe after the a ? 
  yeah , me neither . 
  pitchfork : wrong hand !, 
  it 's missing a tooth !, 
  once-in-a-lifetime if you missed the first one . 
  that is , last-time-in-a-lifetime . 
  i might say it 's a little bigger than that . 
  wow . 
  you 're so clever . 
  but you 'd use a diamond shovel for the dirt !, 
  does that change anything ? 
  how much dirt is there on average per chunk ? 
  when was that , again ? 
  when he was dealing with dad ? 
  i do n't remember him making that face at that time ... though obviously i did know about [ s ] jack : ascend . 
   macs are overpriced . 
  if you were to buy the parts seperately , you would save thousands . 
  and anyone who calls os xa `` superior '' system is probably technologically impaired . 
  os x is basically `` computer for kids '' . 
  some of that is valid , but ... 
  \\* sadly closes safari *, 
  [ but ... ] ( http://tinyurl.com/6qawvq3 ), 
  you also said `` right ** out of ** the bat '' , which is unusual for my area at least . 
  `` right ** off ** the bat . '', 
  looks more like literally a cobblestone wall , though . 
  usually the motherboard speaker ( `` mobo speaker '' ), 
   that does n't mean everyone knows how it works . 
  redditor headgear you mean . 
  that was indeed my goal . 
  ... because it is reading scratches off the disk that encode the sound ? 
  yes . 
  16x6 you gogless ashole, 
  just look around you, 
  might be good against creationists , but how about evolutionists ? 
  but atoms, 
  they come from somewear do n't they, 
  it 's saturn !, 
  the planet with rings !, 
  devil 's advocate . 
  a really stupid one . 
  u disaponit, 
  exactly . 
  i meant , guided evolutionists . 
  that happened to me once with a molex , too . 
  i plugged it in the right way , but the system was currently on . 
  it killed the hard drive i meant to plug in . 
  ( farewell old emachine ), 
  well , so , what i 'm saying , in a more civilized manner , is , why ca n't god have incited the big bang , and guided the particles into this \\* miraculous * arrangement we have today ? 
  you know , the one with the life and stuff ? 
  like , it may make sense against the argument that humans were created from the ground up by a god , but not against the argument that humans had `` evolved '' and the hand of god only guided the process ( thus allowing for some imperfections ) . 
  yup !, 
  he gave us the bible , which is true because it says it is . 
  does it really , though ? 
  how do we know for sure without a control group , and without knowing whether we 're in it ? 
  fucking incredible, 
  upvote for complement, 
  it 's `` sord ... '' ; get it right !, 
  ( but seriously , that 's a really crappy job , dude . 
  i did , did n't you see it, 
  doing a shitty job at making it look more shitty is n't very shitty at all ( i 'm sure it would have been more shitty if you had just left the title shitty like it was supposed to be ) . 
  basically , it would 've been shittier if you 'd left them in, 
  good , that is exactly right, 
  me too !, 
  i was real excited too , because my update watcher had n't caught it yet . 
  yeah . 
  okay , first thing we 're gon na do is upvote each others ' last update submissions out of sympathy . 
  [ come ] ( / dunkass ), 
  [ on ] ( / dunkass ), 
  well , * i * did , anyway . 
  beautiful , so thought-provoking, 
  do n't worry this happens to me all the time, 
  i 'd characterise her as a `` huge bitch , moreso than any canine that would n't collapse below its schwarzchild radius due to gravity '' . 
  she 's probably more evil than that , though . 
  well , do you ever see your karma increase after making a bunch of posts ? 
  what tecxnure pack, 
  this is n't natural , my reasoning for this is below . 
  so basically , the title is a lie - , -, 
  oh , and read before you downvote . 
  1 : look at the 3rd pond to the right that has 3 lily pads . 
  the tree next to it has 2 trunks , with one floating . 
  trees do n't generate directly next to each other, 
  2 : that is a jungle biome . 
  lily pads do n't generate in jungles . 
  proof it is n't a jungle since the tex pack can change colors ? 
  there 's two types of wild grass , regular and ferns , you can see both in that picture . 
  swamps only generate the regular , not ferns , while jungles generate both . 
  also , theres vines growing on the grass , not connected to anything . 
  that means you modified this , so it 's not naturally generated . 
  too bad you ca n't take that out of the title . 
  also , if you modified this to make it look pretty , then do n't claim it 's natural in the title . 
  that leads to people falsely upvoting it thinking it 's 100 % natural . 
  i feel most deeply for you , sir . 
  take all of my karma . 
  whoever did this is a cunt and should be doused in a flammable substance and burned alive in front of his children . 
  ladies and gentlemen , to your pitchforks !,
