  all current known writing systems descend from just three , but surely some minor ones got wiped out among the way . 
  ( also , what about cuneiform ? 
  it was invented independently of egyptian hieroglyphs , and has no living child scripts . 
  that would point to writing getting invented * four * times . 
  the article says that it 's only geoffrey sampson who believes that cuneiform `` probably influenced '' hieroglyphs , and that his view is `` strongly contested '' by other scholars . ), 
  when you crush snow it sticks to itself and other things , like wet sand . 
  unlike wet sand , however , it 's light enough that you can stick that much to a tree without it collapsing under its own weight . 
  in fact , this has more to do with how strongly it sticks to itself . 
  the tighter you pack snow , the denser it gets , but it also gets much more strongly stuck to itself . 
  the strength of the packing grows faster than the density of the packed snow ( in fact , the density barely grows at all ) , so the tighter you pack it , the more stable structures you can build out of it . 
  you do n't need to pack it particularly hard to get it like it is in the picture , though . 
  just about as hard as you pack a sandcastle . 
  ( you ca n't pack things much harder with your hands than that anyway . ), 
  well , they saw the problem , and scheduled maintenance . 
  what 's the problem ? 
  do n't listen to the picture , they are actually pure slavshit, 
  as we all know , the problem happened for long before the maintenance . 
  lame , not much substance other than `` lightsabers are black cock '', 
  cubic , not that it diminishes your point . 
  there 's tons of humans outside the cave , surely * one * is willing to donate their soul on event of accidental death, 
  exponential growth is o ( e ^ ( x ) ) . 
  cubic growth is o ( x ^ ( 3 ) ) . 
  exponential growth is a lot faster than cubic growth . 
  i can play the accordion but this is on another level, 
  excellent !, 
  but why is n't it in all caps ? 
  it 's illegible this way :(, 
  a large part of us , like me , only learned to read all-caps wingdings , since that 's likely how gaster spoke . 
  this is mostly going off of the river guide 's referring to him as `` the man who speaks in hands '' ; all the hand-signs are in capital wingdings ( letters a-i ) . 
  it ultimately does n't matter , since at least 90 % of the people here ca n't read wingdings , but i 'm still sad that i ca n't read it . 
  reddit was inaccessible to various degrees the whole day yesterday . 
  the `` scheduled maintenance '' happened several hours after the problems started , so i suppose they could have scheduled the maintenance for then . 
  but it 's just tongue-in-cheek and i feel bad for explaining the joke, 
  i do n't understand , is that somehow a common trope ? 
  or was it written specifically for homestuck ? 
  granted , the only other things i 've read with vampires are * dracula * and the twilight series , but the latter does n't seem to fit . 
  the worst copypastas are the ones that can only be reused as entire new posts, 
  well , i 'm sure * someone * memorized the lowercase letters here . 
  it 's just not the majority of wingding learners , lol . 
  really wants that pan-uralic playthrough, 
  i * knew * the spectrograms were bullshit, 
  type iii or iv ? 
  because with type i you can get all the way to old age without getting diagnosed . 
  well , the whole theme of the skeletons ' speech is that they talk in annoying fonts , so mission accomplished i guess, 
  i still do n't really understand it . 
  if both the paths were linear , like cars on a highway , then it would n't look like retrograde motion ; mars would just appear to be going backwards with respect to us ( as long as we both maintained a constant speed ) . 
  what is it about the curvature of the orbit that makes retrograde motion appear ? 
   / \u014bg / initially, 
  wow , i 've seen initial / \u014b / , but never an entire initial / \u014bg / ( which is probably what most people imagine in their heads when seeing words beginning with `` ng '' ) . 
  that 's really cool . 
   too bad we are n't really allowed to talk about it right now, 
  huh ? 
  huh . 
  anyone wan na meet up for an undertale party in mongolia ? 
  or cambodia . 
  or ~ ~ billby 's ~ ~ i mean belize, 
  i played it for 5 hours , got the true humanist ending , and decided that it would be cruel to reset it . 
  and that includes making multiple tours through the underground at various points in the game to see if i missed anything , * and * beating the credits . 
  what the hell are you people doing that takes 60 hours, 
  yeah , that makes the genocide run only 2.5 actually challenging fights ( does muffet count ? 
  as a shitpost veteran i 'd say this subreddit is far less shitposty than early 2015 / r/homestuck , nevermind / r/jontron . 
  it 's about as shitposty as current / r/homestuck , although it 's got a far wider range of authors, 
  well , you also one-shot sans . 
  before humans started cutting up and throwing coconuts into the sea , they used to use shells . 
  the octopuses are presumably grateful , since this seems like somewhat of an upgrade . 
  the common theme is , germany is always better, 
  i can understand a genocide run taking another 4 or so hours , and i can understand 2-3 hours per run to find extra endings . 
  ( it took me 3 hours to get to the neutral ending part , and that was at a very relaxed pace . ), 
  toss in another 10 or so hours to make up for the fact that they might not be as good at bullet hell stuff . 
  even at a conservative estimate , that comes out to 15 runs . 
  do people do that ? 
  man , flowey was right, 
  `` i do n't like dirt . 
  it 's coarse and irritating and it gets everywhere . '', 
  there will be pc versions but they will include spyware . 
  if you try to uninstall it , it will just install more spyware .

  you could post a gif of a flying toaster and i 'd upvote it, 
  for which america is entirely responsible . 
  and do n't think having some boats at one time entitles you to america 's achievements !, 
  they achieved what they did because they * specifically did n't want to be like you !, 
  * taking credit for it would be like the carthaginians taking credit for the foundation of rome . 
  nah it 's a pretty okay way to get the point across , to use smaller words you 'd need to either use too many of them or give up some precision, 
  now this is a kenm . 
  with replies . 
  i just wish the replies were stupider . 
  `` wow , we sure like how the government of britain has a strong monarchy and a standing army , and how popular representation in their government is limited . 
  that 's why we 're going to build a government where the power is balanced to the point of uselessness , and which is entirely representative and relies on short terms . 
  also , let 's not have a standing army . 
  because britain 's government is just so great ! '', 
  seriously , just read [ `` common sense '' ] ( http://www.gutenberg.org/files/147/147-h/147-h.htm ) by thomas paine , it was pretty pivotal in the american revolution and it 's not that long . 
  what the hell do they teach you britbongs in school, 
  holy crap , you 're right . 
  well , $ 14.99 as of the time of this writing, 
  why the hell does finnish `` pusu '' mean the same thing as hungarian `` puszi '' ? 
  if they were descended from the same word , then the hungarian would start with `` f\u00fa - '' .
