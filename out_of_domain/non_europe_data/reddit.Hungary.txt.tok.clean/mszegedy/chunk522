  edit : [ sz\u00f3kincsh\u00e1l\u00f3 ] ( http://www.szokincshalo.hu/szotar/?qbetu=p&amp;qsearch=&amp;qdetail=9300 ) says that the hungarian is from onomatopoeia . 
  sure is similar to the finnish sense of onomatopoeia . 
  when we arrived in europe , we could n't pronounce syllables with more than one consonant next to each other . 
  look at what you 've done to us !, 
  ^ ( although the only place here ) ^ ^ where ^ ^ there 's ^ ^ a ^ ^ consonant ^ ^ cluster ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ syllable ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ '' - \u00fcnk '', 
  [ heck no . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nemzeti_dal ) although , it does rank third as a statement of hungarian national identity . 
  ( the first two are the anthem and the not-anthem . ), 
  yup . 
  the difference is context :, 
  - the anthem and not-anthem are both protest songs against the austrians , written 20 years apart . 
  - the `` national poem '' is a speech that started the revolution against the austrians . 
  we really hated the austrians for some reason . 
  poo 's yellow , which is a combination of red and green light , but the water 's absorbed the red light at this depth . 
  thus , green . 
  ( fun fact : at this depth , your blood will look green . 
  the first time i got cut at this depth , i was like , `` did i accidentally get some algae on me ? '' ), 
  either way , now i have information about the movie ( namely , that * that * is n't going to happen ) . 
  dammit . 
  but we hated you since before napoleon , even . 
  it only took a couple years between when austria liberated hungary from the turks in the years leading up to 1699 to giving y' all the middle finger and trying for independence in the r\u00e1k\u00f3czi ii conflicts ^ ( or whatever it is in english ) . 
  eventually the 12 demands summarized our grievances in 1848 pretty well ( censorship , unequal taxes , unequal rights , having to fight austria 's wars , no army/bank/gentry of our own ) , but that does n't capture the 150 years of not liking austrian rule leading up to it . 
  ( i know austria settled a bunch of austrians in hungary in the early 1700s ... i guess that must have been something that pissed everyone off . ), 
  we hated the austrians for losing wwi so much that we were already writing protest songs against them in the 1820s, 
  no , but yellow is, 
  why ca n't i find any fucking research on this ? 
  i specifically asked / r/linguistics for papers on it , and they basically just shrugged and showed me some tangentially-related stuff ( like the distribution of who uses various kinds of emoticons , which is still pretty cool i guess ) . 
  if someone 's done research on this , * where is it ? 
  exactly , just like you pronounce `` 1,234 '' as `` one two three four '' . 
  7 times ? 
  that ca n't be accurate , france is huge . 
  i 'd be willing to believe 3 at most .

  ugh ggs is a terrible source for this . 
  fortunately / r/badhistory did a full review of [ that exact chapter ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2bv2yf/guns_germs_and_steel_chapter_3_collision_at/ ), 
  fair enough . 
  i 'd have a problem with the tone if it were n't for their criticisms being completely reasonable and well backed-up . 
  it 's good !, 
  the biggest problem i have with it is that too many of the attacks are fakeouts or just plain easy for the fight to be anywhere near hard , and to justify the life reverse-fakeout . 
  the space attack is by far the best and most interesting one in there , and by far on another level compared to the rest , both skill-wise and design-wise . 
  ( on another note : you have to use the fight button to make progress ? 
  the only in-game character that requires that is asgore . ), 
  there were a bunch of other minor problems i noticed , like the guns being too loud ( guns * are * loud , but not in video games ) , but they 're not as important , and chances are you 're working on them . 
  oh god i ca n't stop looking at it, 
  huh . 
  i completely forgot the squiddles album existed . 
  these are exactly what i would pick . 
  ^ ( well , except zillyhoo . 
  gregorian chants are an entire genre . 
  you ca n't call a song one of the worst in there just because it 's a genre you do n't like . ), 
  the only sane person here is sara, 
  venice decided to attack them , genoa took advantage of the situation , and serbia and candar ate the rest . 
  i do n't think subtractive mixing works on a computer screen . 
  the whole reason computer screens work is because light mixes additively . 
  ( but they might mix subtractively for other reasons , like how they are rendered . 
  i have no idea . ), 
  i could see hungary doing this at some point . 
  when the cumans arrived , we dedicated a low-population-density area to them ( where their descendants still reside ) . 
  oh no he used an extra letter e , completely incomprehensible pdox pls fix, 
  \u0107yng, 
  either way it 's a colonial organism, 
  probably just a naming convention for a derivational suffix, 
  penag has the russian flag ? 
  k \\* e ^ t is the solution to y = dy/dt , so i would n't say it 's wrong . 
  however , i meant y = dy/d * x * , since the solution to that is k \\* e ^ ( x ) , which is the most widely understood way to express the exponential function . 
  it 's just that having t instead of x as the variable that was getting differentiated by tripped me up . 
  i see now that you were trying to present a condition under which the original equation given would still be graphed as shown . 
  i thought you were presenting it as a replacement , in which context it looked like nonsense . 
  imo y = y ' is still the easiest way to express the shape in the image . 
  it 's got not one but two solutions for it on it . 
  i was confused for a good half minute until i figured out that you meant a * mouth * harmonica . 
  / r/deeplyunsatisfying, 
  normally i try to be understanding of this stuff , but how are people * this * illiterate ? 
  or unable to write , anyway . 
  how do i make a cultural minority in my country the majority , if that 's possible ? 
  [ also red hair ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_hair#geographic_distribution ), 
  do n't forget serbia on op 's side and the two sicilies on the other side . 
  the ottomans are about to get shrekt . 
  a long time ago i wondered why nobody uses those containers to smuggle drugs . 
  then i realized that because you can only carry a certain amount in a plane , it would n't be profitable . 
  ( palimpsests are , in fact , a tablet you write on , and then later shave the surface off of to erase . 
  equeon was thinking of a palindrome . ), 
  i mean , that would be pretty nice, 
  no , americans pronounce `` ya '' like how a german would pronounce the second syllable in `` sehe '' ( and americans would pronounce `` zeya '' almost exactly the same way as germans pronounce `` sehe '' itself ) . 
  you 're thinking of what is better phonetically written as `` yah '' . 
  ( confusingly , this works better for american english than received pronunciation , but whatever . ), 
  the painful unfunniness is what lets it annoy everybody, 
  you are terrible at spelling / r/jailbait, 
  `` jesus '' is a bit of a misnomer for central europe . 
  it is entirely true that he brings presents during christmas ( on the evening or midnight of dec 24 ) , but we do also have santa claus ( saint nicholas ) . 
  it 's just that santa claus brings presents on the night between dec 5 and 6 . 
  dec 6 is saint nicholas day , which is one of the only saint 's days we celebrate with things outside of church . 
  santa claus usually brings presents about ten times less valuable than the ones jesus brings . 
  kids find out that santa claus does n't exist pretty early , but they never find out jesus does n't exist , if they 're lucky . 
  i wonder who brings presents to sz\u00e9kelys . 
  not only do they live in romania , but their jesus is also fake , since they are reformed . 
  i wrote it for a german . 
  you probably do n't speak german , which is why you 're confused . 
  `` sehe '' is a simple german word , the second syllable of which is pronounced like how americans pronounce `` ya '' . 
  the whole word is pronounced like how americans would pronounce `` zeya '' .
