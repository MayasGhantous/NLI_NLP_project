  i am telling this to the person i replied to , so that they understand how americans would normally pronounce `` ya '' , because they seemed to be thinking of a different pronunciation . 
  but it loads real fast on my phone, 
   advertise it on cosmo ? 
  this one is the closest to actually being sensible, 
  of coss, 
  stopper it up with a new patch, 
  exactly . 
  good luck telling your kids jesus does n't exist . 
  backwards is almost as annoying . 
  i finally managed to hammer a regular sleep schedule into myself over the past couple months . 
  i was looking forward to waking up early during the vacation and having a lot of time during the day . 
  come december 23rd , i sleep until 3 pm . 
  why ? 
  this is the kind of depth that cook 's blogposts lack, 
  six remarkably content-light paragraphs . 
  i do n't disagree with anything he says , but it 's not like i gained more insight from reading the post than just reading the title . 
  and they still own that one province next to lithuania, 
  is it too much to ask for a post with real content ? 
   i wonder if there was some sort of sequence of years that were all divisible by 5 , so mathematicians are losing a streak of fun years . 
  not sure if you 're joking , but every fifth year is divisible by 5 . 
  a sequence of numbers divisible by 5 * would * be very fun for mathematicians , on account of making no sense . 
  is the phonology intentionally similar to english 's ? 
  gallium has the same melting point as chocolate . 
  how do you explain those truffles i bought in the new orleans , huh ? 
  go eat a hungary , and form the glorious dwa bratanky commonwealth, 
  what 's happening to the bread ? 
  it looks like it just flies off of the belt by itself . 
  ah , i see , now that you mention it you can briefly see them returning to their place . 
  i was looking for something to the right of them . 
  thanks !, 
  fun fact : on reddit sync , your flair is in between `` 4 '' and `` points '' in the points indicator . 
  i can see what the unicode spec was going for , but damn rtl text is hard . 
  hungary was divided . 
  strangely , the * eastern * half , transylvania , was the protestant part . 
  this was because of austria 's firm catholic grip on the west , in contrast to the turks ' lack of care for the pathetic religion of their infidel subjects .

   destroy your fort in greece, 
  which one ? 
  the only part of this joke that has n't aged well is the national vs. foreign lightbulbs, 
  i do n't understand those boards , by which i mean that i ca n't physically stand under them, 
  it 's sad that you do n't get to see their reaction to the strike, 
  there 's consistent editorial policy , but a lot of it is really unhelpful . 
  i think it 's about hardware vendors ? 
  i ca n't find a context for it either, 
  sadly , finland brought along with itself plenty of swedes, 
  sit ? 
  it 's weird that both of the languages that i am fluent in ( english and hungarian ) have no close relatives ( except scots ) , and are wildly different from their closest relatives due to a thousand years of loans from europeans . 
  it 's hard for me to imagine what it 's like to try to understand the other side of a dialect continuum or anything . 
  still , though , english has a lot of diversity tied up in its various dialects ( and scots ) . 
  and the gap between english and german is so incomparable to the vast gulf between hungarian and mansi that i often find myself looking at a sentence of german and thinking `` this is english '' . 
  holy crap there is unicode for frogs, 
  i 'd consider frisian not so close , on account of missing a lot of french loanwords and insular developments . 
  the kind of `` close '' i 'm thinking of is partial mutual intelligibility due to a shared history and geographic area . 
  english has too many french loanwords to understand frisian , and to an extent scots . 
  it 's not even more efficient . 
  sunlight goes at ~ 6 % at best with photosynthesis , while solar cells have it at 20 % or so . 
  obviously , having undergone an assimilation process means that your language has n't changed since the dawn of time . 
  wait , that 's an actual achievement ? 
  awesome !, 
  oh jesus i 've spent months on this . 
  [ here 's a post i wrote a couple months ago outlining the various possibilities . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/3kpies/great_perm_run_venting_post/ ) maybe it 's different in this patch . 
  for my aar ( which i still need to start up again , but i need cossacks for , which is $ 20 ) i just started as muscovy , it was much better . 
  downside is , no achievement . 
  edit : should note , the table assumes you want to convert to shamanism . 
  fortunately , even without that the run is f % # & ing impossible . 
  novgorod almost always supports your independence , which is why that factor is left out of the table . 
  but they are n't strong enough to beat muscovy on their own , and fighting an independence war with just them on your side will just make muscovy stronger ( and weaken a potential ally ) , which will make subsequent independence wars harder . 
  so the table is for choosing which supporter * in addition * to novgorod you 'll get . 
  huh , i 've never been able to win an independence war with just novgorod on my side . 
  either it changed in the patch , or you 're just better at warfare with an unreliable ally than i am . 
  there 's a lot wrong with this guide . 
  many entries could be replaced with variations on a bar chart , which by far gives the best sense of relative size out of any of those charts . 
  what stick out especially are the polar area diagrams -- i do n't care if your data is cyclical , it 's absolutely ass for most purposes and does n't give any sense of relative scale at all . 
  just use a bar chart and read edward tufte 's * the visual display of quantitative data . 
  that said , it 's not a * terrible * guide . 
  most of the decisions it advocates for are sensible . 
  you do n't think you could be just imagining that he 's `` slower '' than average ? 
  the horns effect is real and strong . 
  and even if his body language * is * slow , that 's absolutely no reason to conclude that someone 's stupid . 
  you can see the jpeg, 
  joke 's on you my reaction time is too slow, 
   this is gross and possibly bad for your health .

  and in the vein of salt , msg , although it 's not as universally helpful . 
  tried that once , got the gluey gross tasting thing , ended up making latkes/placki/brambor \u00e1ky . 
  you would hate cursive cyrillic or cursive ipa , they all look like the same damn thing, 
  so that you can write it fast and so that it does n't look like shit when you try to handwrite it . 
  it fell out of use in the early 20th century . 
  it looked like [ this .
