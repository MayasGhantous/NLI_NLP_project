  it 's terrible . 
  [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/vsmn6wj.jpg ) was on the front page of / r/conlangs a few days ago . 
  never have i seen / \u0251 / so horribly mutilated ; i thought it was a backwards thorn . 
  and / \u0279 / looks like / \u026c / ... it 's just not worth it man , a standardized orthography is a wonderful thing . 
  cursive is legible , if you know cursive . 
  just because you ca n't read it does n't mean it 's `` shitty '' . 
  lots of people ca n't read english cursive either , but that 's because they never learned it , not because it 's inherently bad . 
  some people take anime to mean `` japanese cartoons '' as opposed to `` cartoons in the anime style '', 
  that 's the whole point of cursive , though , that the letters are connected . 
  if you knew ipa you 'd find the cursive much easier to read , on account of knowing what the letters are supposed to look like . 
  and if you knew the cursive , then , well , you 'd be able to read it as easily as print text . 
  it 's like knocking arabic because you ca n't tell where the letters are , when arabic readers are perfectly capable of it . 
  ( although people do do that , but people will always be terrible at accepting other peoples ' language and orthography . ), 
  it 's not clear-cut , but there are definitely a lot of distinctive properties that are commonly used together that roughly constitute some sort of style associated with anime . 
  i would n't say that spongebob is an anime , if it were produced by japan . 
  ^ ( dear god that was too many hedging words in one sentence ), 
  eh , that 's just the nature of cursive . 
  in hastily-written english cursive , `` t '' looks like `` l '' , `` f '' looks like `` b '' , and * everything * looks like `` e '' . 
  ipa has a larger character set , so naturally it would contain more similarities between characters that are already pretty similar anyway ( such as / c \u0255 \u00e7 \u0254 / , / t \u0288 f \u025f / , or every freaking vowel ) . 
  if you 're just writing a single language , though , you 're only going to use a relatively small subset of these characters . 
  the `` north wind and the sun '' transcription above is * really * well-penned , and i dare you to say anything bad about that , because the different characters are really distinct . 
  spin the wheel of classification !, 
  - romance, 
  - germanic, 
  - almost slavic, 
  - all of the above ?? 
  - none of the above ??!? 
  ( if it turns out to be austronesian or something i ` mma commit suicide ), 
  do you wan na have a smooth time ? 
  can you explain the inspiration for cseban and give a gloss ? 
  it looks interesting . 
  its ' calld a piracy u dumb cock, 
  i 'd like to high-five you over `` sz '' and `` cz '' . 
  in hungary we often say that our orthography is backwards from polish , since we have / s / for `` sz '' while polish has / \u0282 / for it . 
  but polish maintains an internal contrast between / \u0255 / and / \u0282 / , and for that matter / t\u0361\u0255 / and / \u0288\u0361\u0282 / . 
  so , you 've developed another way to have your orthography backwards from polish\u01c3, 
  btw , do n't you think alveolo-palatal and palato-alveolar is kind of a close distinction for two sibilants to have ? 
  i can barely tell apart any of the sibilants between the alveolar ridge and the palate , never mind two that are right next to each other . 
  your glossing is fine . 
  some people have ascii memorized, 
  ah , i see , i usually call / \u0255 / `` palato-alveolar '' and / \u0283 / `` post-alveolar '', 
  no no , you 're right , i was mis-remembering wikipedia myself, 
  seconded, 
  also hungarians , because we have an inflated image of italy due to geographical proximity and them being richer than us . 
  i imagine this applies to central europe in general, 
  we never should have * had * 9-year-old anakin , it was completely pointless . 
  make * the phantom menace * about teenage anakin instead . 
  this is why we should n't pollute our bars with plastic , it 'll hurt the wildlife, 
  the czechs and slovaks have a surprisingly cordial relationship . 
  that result at least is supported by real-world evidence . 
  and they did n't even do it right , it 's the lapps who fuck reindeer, 
  except that that 's not relevant , he 's poetically stating that he does n't want to know people who * have * seen it and do n't like it, 
  with a shadow being cast on him !, 
  pay attention to that !, 
  british people do n't know any spanish , so they do n't post about it, 
  i mean , even our parents were amorphous blobs of cells at some point, 
  or it 's a pun, 
  real talk : i ca n't find any good books on conflict resolution between individuals ( not necessarily as a mediator ) . 
  care to recommend any ? 
  that would be the anatolians , like the hittites . 
  and probably for a brief period a bunch of semites . 
  anatolia is a conga line of migrants . 
  i say the semites because some of the ( for example , them akkadians ) migrated to persia at some point , so they might have briefly inhabited anatolia in between . 
  it 's possible to reconstruct approximate migration times from haplogroup and linguistic data , but honestly the only ones who care are anthropologists , nationalists , and racists . 
  not at sea level or higher , you do n't, 
  that was because it was n't available , unless you 're thinking of a different one than me, 
  oh my god i forgot that particular piece of bullshit . 
  how can the prequels be * so * bad ? 
  unrelatedly , the linked post is almost surely a troll . 
  oh god the lack of vowel harmony , it hurts . 
  what 's it like , having an aesthetically inferior language to finnish and hungarian ? 
  ( and turkish , but fuck the turks ), 
  well , except that imaginary prescriptivist english is a dialect of it 's own , so arguably there 's no reason to hate it . 
  this subreddit 's submissions are the perfect training data for one, 
  i doubt this was done with newton 's method . 
  probably just an elaborate print command, 
  every time i read the title i have to look twice to realize that it 's not '' ) : '', 
  wait , is it that post itself ? 
  it would make sense , but that was only a day ago ... 
  edit : ohhh , they 're not saying we 're one of the best subreddits , they 're saying we did a best of post !, 
  * yes * to all of these . 
  i 've personally experienced more than half the problems listed . 
  i like this list . 
  at least its drivers work, 
  it went on the fritz for me last year but it seems alright since a month or so ago when i switched my wm from mate/metacity to i3 , and tweaked my xorg a bit . 
  but that 's not what it entailed . 
  the zeroes are organized into rows and columns . 
  so it 's a little more complicated than that . 
  more to the point , i 'd say / \u0278 / sounds and is much closer to / f / than / h / , but it 's understandable that it can be used in place of / h / . 
  i mean , schizophrenia also has a catatonic form where you `` space out '' for long periods of time . 
  i 'd connect periods of inactivity more to schizophrenia than depression . 
  ( but schizophrenia is n't the only dissociative disorder out there . ), 
  the actual movie definitely rang more for depression for me than schizophrenia , but if the only symptoms i heard of in someone were periods of unresponsiveness/inactivity , then i 'd much more suspect catatonic schizophrenia , not depression . 
  2015 did n't produce any good ones as far as i know . 
  we managed to spit out 5/7 at the end , which is a terrible meme imo . 
  the year * did * see the peak and death of montage parody videos , though , which was great . 
  hungarian here : what the hell is chicken paprikash ? 
  is it chicken and nokedli with sour cream/paprika sauce on it ? 
  this process is backwards for tennant and capaldi/smith . 
  tennant was hated very early on but everyone then realized he 's doing a brilliant job , it 's just that `` christmas invasion '' was poorly written .
