  ( it 's one of the few uralic languages with articles , for example , and coordinating conjunctions are very prevalent nowadays . 
  we even clumsily borrowed gender distinctions onto certain words , like `` tan\u00e1r '' vs `` tan\u00e1rn\u0151 '' , literally `` teacher '' and `` teacherwoman '' . ), 
  well , he does n't just look asian , he looks like a racist caricature of an asian . 
  it 's impossible * not * to identify that as asian . 
  depends on if you want to know what happened in between . 
  one thing led to another , and the next day i was sitting on the toilet , taking a shit . '', 
  what do you do with it ? 
  you ca n't move the fingers . 
  well , the neo-nazism is weird , but are you really surprised that / r/duolingo of all places is terrible at linguistics ? 
  also / r/badperson , how dare you remove glorious sz\u00e9kely, 
  it 's the same vowel for me ( central jersey and some other influences ) . 
  i always assumed cot/caught was [ k\u02b0\u0254t ] vs [ k\u02b0\u0251t ] in dialects that did n't merge it , and father/bother was [ \u02c8f\u0251\u02d1\u00f0\u025d ] vs [ \u02c8b\u0254\u00f0\u025d ] . 
  but what about the aw in paw ? 
  i have an inkling that it 's supposed to be / \u0252 / or / \u0254 / ... 
  people who follow a different historiography than you do are n't necessarily wrong . 
  it 's why history can thrive as a discipline , because there 's endless room to reinterpret . 
  it 's about fast, 
  maybe it 's cheaper ? 
  you know , i 'm kind of worried that snoke will turn out to be an evil yoda , i.e. 
  a tiny mentor dude who is the most powerful force user on their side of the force . 
  i hope they come up with a more interesting character design than that . 
  sometimes it does !, 
  usually languages change the spelling of loanwords when they borrow them , to fit their native writing system . 
  english is fairly unusual in that it barely bothers changing the spelling of loanwords , especially french ones . 
  back when the letter was first introduced to turkish , it represented / \u0270 / . 
  that realization still exists sporadically among elderly speakers , but generally now it takes a vocalic value . 
  which is funny , because apparently turkish is considered a syllable-timed language ( and not even a mora-timed one ) . 
  the prestige aspect very much contributes to it , yes . 
  the normans had absolutely no plans to adapt the spelling of their words to english orthography . 
  if anything , they brought about a frenchification of the whole english orthography . 
  huh . 
  whenever i feel like i 'm overgeared for a boss fight , posts like this one come along to make me feel better about it . 
  hallowed repeater with cursed/ichor arrows is the way to go . 
  just fly/run/float / jump in one direction , firing backwards . 
  you ca n't quite outrun them unless you 're on asphalt/frozen slime blocks , but you can outmaneuver them vertically . 
  you can stack hallowed armor with ironskin and regen potions to buff your defense , but if you 're good at dodging it almost should n't matter . 
  either way , though , hallowed armor is good for the speed bonus . 
  there might be other ways to beat them , but this is the most foolproof one i 've found . 
  pretty slow , though . 
  you can kill the destroyer without getting hurt , too . 
  all you need is a nimbus rod and patience !, 
  a note though , jungle vines seem to be immune to corruption . 
  already-corrupted vines can indeed spread it though . 
  as a kid i loved echinoderms , and once i got a field guide i was overjoyed to discover how many different kinds there were besides the four well-known ones , but dismayed that i was n't going to see them easily snorkeling . 
  for years and years i gradually checked the `` exotic '' echinoderms off of my list . 
  crinoids i think were the second one , in malta . 
  they 're really fun to touch . 
  they 'll try to shake your hand . 
  ( the one that took the longest was basket stars . 
  i had to do a night dive on bonaire . 
  they 're beautiful . ), 
  funnier than the post, 
  this is the reddit narrative , but in my experience when i suppress negative emotions it 's got nothing to do with not wanting to appear weak , or heaven forbid wanting to appear '' * manly * '' . 
  i do n't think i 've worried about manliness in my life * once . 
  * suppressing negative emotions just seems like the easiest/least painful choice . 
  sadness is painful , so trying not to be sad is less painful than being sad , nahmsayin ? 
  have you seen the kinds of things people post here ? 
  the funny thing is , this sounds like it could be a philippine conlang 's language . 
  the word for `` know '' in tagalog is `` al\u00e1m '' , and the most common and general nominal suffix is '' - an '' . 
  so you could just imagine a word `` alam\u00e1n '' that means something to the effect of `` knowledge '' . 
  and your word is just one vowel reduction away from that !, 
  ( however , your word sounds more connected to thinking , not knowing , but stranger things have happened ), 
   calling a graeco-latin word with many reflexes among other languages `` the most english word in all of english '', 
  oh i know it 's not a real word , just offering a possible derivation . 
  that 's every language . 
  most loanwords into english are either romance or norse . 
  i like this because i ca n't tell whether it 's supposed to be `` nuances '' or `` nuisances '' , which is appropriate, 
  wait , i thought michael giacchino was going to do the soundtrack ? 
  when did it become john williams ? 
  you ca n't play that you fuck , nowhere near enough land, 
  well , official canon is important , because future films are free to disregard anything outside it . 
  if you try to embrace a wider view of the canon , you may find internal inconsistencies . 
  `` stop * tearing up * the pentateuch , asshole ! '', 
  seconded , we would really rather have less frequent updates than see you overwork yourself !, 
  it 's almost as if language is n't owned , and is barely even controlled . 
  both crimea and hungary still alive ? 
  impressive, 
  edit : and ... ragusa, 
  tbf , from what i 've seen on this sub , you 're supposed to be able to wc with austria if you 're good , not just conquer most of europe, 
  more specifically , the article 's writers are probably basing their opinion on ie languages , which are characterized the presence of a noun class system . 
  that 's presentism if i 've ever seen it . 
  the guy who replied to you with a wall of text is right . 
  tbf , what were they gon na do ? 
  everyone knows it makes the most money if the guy 's white . 
  [ the next fucking monty python line ], 
  blob harder !, 
  eventually your army will number several hundred thousand , and you 'll think , `` wtf do i do with all these ? '', 
  named after a lake , even, 
  today , we are * all * donuts . 
  the gainful employment i have found in cooking gulasch for the viennese begs to differ, 
  this essentially happened the last time i played . 
  i landed on free parking three times , and we were using the rule where every time someone gets free parking , it 's auto-replenished with a bunch of money . 
  cue curb stomping everyone . 
  it 's hard and annoying and you often accidentally input something in the process . 
  for my printer , a ppd file * is * available , but does n't seem to work . 
  * you * try living somewhere where you 're a cultural and linguistic minority . 
  it 's really fun ( not ) . 
  it 's a drumstick . 
  it 's a * rocket * drumstick , and schweiz is the flames . 
  this is sami erasure,
