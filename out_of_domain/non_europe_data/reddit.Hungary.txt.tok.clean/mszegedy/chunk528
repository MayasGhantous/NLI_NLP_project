  not really the generals ' fault , the soldiers did n't really speak each other 's languages or the generals ' languages . 
  this was a constant problem for the austrian army for centuries . 
  is that in the levant , or egypt ? 
  i remember conquering it with the ottomans at some point , but i do n't remember when ... kinda * sounds * egyptian ? 
  or greek , anyway . 
  arabic does n't even have a ` p ' sound . '', 
  i 'm not trying to be political either . 
  is n't my comment * kinda * funny by virtue of complaining about the erasure of all five sami who live there ? 
  not this time , it did n't !, 
  do n't forget stir fry , that 's also cooked at 600 \u00b0 f on a good day . 
  i just wait until the ( avocado ) oil starts smoking and then fry . 
  ( but the idea of using * butter * for anything ridiculously hot is kind of ridiculous . ), 
  blow a winning strategy he had been saving for something else ? 
  i hate when people say `` i 'm spanish '' like no that 's a country not a nationality . 
  call yourselves castilian/catalonian/asturian / basque/whatever , assholes, 
  edit : oops , should have remembered / r/tumblrinaction ca n't identify satire , my bad, 
  we still call them that ... 
  that 's related to the broken window fallacy !, 
  that 's what vms are for, 
  used to , but food is n't exactly plentiful there still . 
  which is a shame , because ethiopian and somali food is some of the best food ever . 
  we do this often in hungary . 
  not considered tacky here , it 's almost a running joke, 
  i 'd say it 's closest to indian food , but honestly it 's so different from anything that the comparison is n't very useful . 
  it uses less spices and more meat than indian food . 
  a long time ago i figured out that the best european food was all developed after colonialism . 
  italian food is made of tomato . 
  central and eastern european food is made of potato and paprika . 
  spanish food is made of peppers and rice . 
  and indian food is good , but you need like 60 spices before you get anything that tastes decent . 
  ethiopian food really impressed me by restricting itself to local ingredients , and not too many spices , and still managing to taste incredible . 
  it can be spicy , too , which i love . 
  the best part is that it 's all eaten wrapped in this spongy `` bread '' that is perhaps the best food to ever resemble a pancake that i 've ever seen , touched , or tasted . 
  pancakes , meat , and seasoning , you can never go wrong with that . 
  edit : since people seem to be missing this information from here , the bread is called `` injera '' in amharic and `` canjeero '' in somali . 
  if there were a family of pancakes that included french crepes and american pancake , this would be in it and would be the outgroup . 
  raw teff seed , which it is ultimately made from ( although it 's ground into a flour first ) , can be a delicious ingiedient too , substituting for any cereal grain . 
  i use it as a rice substitute in milchreis and i am much happier for it . 
  ha , i know the name , i just did n't think it mattered in the context . 
  what 's ethiopia like these days ? 
  where 's all the pollution from ? 
  china can blame its pollution problems on the air settling on the plateau , but i do n't know anything about ethiopian geography that would make it especially vulnerable . 
  have you traveled around the country much ? 
  also , please tell everyone in ethiopia for me that their food is fantastic and that their forerunners are geniuses for inventing it . 
  thanks !, 
  yes !, 
  the point is , all my favorite italian dishes , and all the stereotypical italian dishes , use tomato . 
  there 's a few that do n't -- like spaghetti in aglio e olio -- but they 're not what you think of when you think `` italian food is tasty '' . 
  american food is made of ground beef and cheese with the caveat that tex-mex is also american and also includes tortillas and peppers . 
  edit : and i would n't say it 's a `` western '' view ; in hungary , we also view italian food as `` pizza tortellini ravioli spaghetti lasagna '' . 
  face it , they never exported the delicious local seafood . 
  ( delicious local seafood also applies to the iberian peninsula . 
  but without rice , you 'd never get paella ... ), 
  would n't it be one of the cpu 's registers processing the text ? 
  although admittedly you 'd have to wonder then how it got this far ... 
  it 's also because you 're not getting enough sleep !, 
  it was really masturbatory tbh . 
  like a thinly veiled fantasy disguised as an actual movie . 
  that said i * can * quote it : eywa has heard you jake, 
  wait , have you seen a * lot * of suicidal drivers ? 
  my father and i occasionally lecture in flip flops . 
  undergrads are n't going to give us shit for it . 
  my username on / r/circlebroke is in comic sans and i am proud of this, 
  edit : oh no , they reverted it :(, 
  what 's wrong with / r/undelete ? 
  does n't look bad enough to warrant banning basically everyone who 's ever posted there, 
  edit : oh , wait , it 's to mess with them , gotcha, 
  what about usenet and irc/bash . org ? 
  i would n't call them `` hateful nerd boys '' , but they do seem like direct ancestors of reddit, 
  [ implying jade would n't cut her hair to cosplay rose ] ( / greentext ), 
  and perhaps dye it , but it 's not easy with hair that dark ... 
  so they 're paranoid . 
  honestly , have you seen the rest of reddit ? 
  they 're much worse . 
  i am from hungary and have been to austria many times , i 've never seen these . 
  very believable though , it 's basically virsli/w \u00fcrstel with the components arranged into a sandwich, 
  yet some reconstructed languages are clearly more analytic than their descendants . 
  proto-uralic had ~ six cases , head-initial clause structure ( in particular , postpositions ) , and few conjunctions , preferring to express things with verbal nouns ( it seems to not have had a word for `` and '' , for example ) . 
  pre-proto-uralic had only one number and perhaps one case . 
  proto-uralic verb endings and possessive endings also obviously come from agglutinated pronouns , so verbs were presumably also much less inflected at some point . 
  modern uralic languages are ridiculously agglutinative , having tens of cases that come from agglutinated postpositions and phrases , and a bazillion verb endings . 
  i guess head-initial clause structure and suffixal agglutinativity is a potent recipe for becoming more synthetic over time . 
  let 's see this pitted against that other til post that made it sound like every language has the same word for this . 
  fight , fight , fight !, 
  so that 's where all our airplanes went after we shut down our airlines . 
  * western * roman empire . 
  they were the ones who let too many immigrants in . 
  byzantium was just straight up conquered . 
  the whole of / u/rugbyandperl has no understanding of idioms , let alone a word for it . 
  it 's from `` proto-uralic comparative-historical morphosyntax '' by alo raun , who calls both the theories of the * numerus absolutus * and * casus absolutus * `` fairly generally accepted '' . 
  on the * numerus absolutus , * he cites fokos d\u00e1vid 's 1961 paper `` ur\u00e1li \u00e9s altaji \u00f6sszehasonl\u00edt\u00f3 szintaktikai tanulm\u00e1nyok '' ( `` uralic and altaic comparative syntactic studies '' ) , chapter 6 , `` a numerus absolutus v. indefinitus haszn\u00e1lata '' ( `` the usage of the numerus absolutus v. indefinitus '' ) . 
  no problem !, 
  be warned , alo raun does n't go in depth -- it 's a three-sentence throwaway . 
  i ca n't speak for fokos , but the subject matter does n't sound like pre-proto-uralic morphosyntax . 
  feels good/dopamine release, 
  yup, 
  i 'll throw in with `` yes , either that or we 'll prove that there are n't that many . '', 
  10 guy is usually `` hey i wan na coin a new phrase '', 
  reddit from 4 or 5 years ago was almost as reddity as current reddit ( although it predates a lot of really reddity things like faces of atheism , the fappening , the whole ellen pao fiasco , etc. ) . 
  i 'm not sure i could pinpoint a time when the reddit front page was dominated by meaningful intellectual discussion .
