  if you look at / r/reddit . com , already then most comments were a single line that does n't add to the discussion much . 
  and if you go back * too * far , to before the digg exodus , then there simply are n't comments . 
  that said , this * is * amazing and it 's very nice to see such a rare thing occur . 
  anakin dying a jedi was the whole point of the old trilogy , or at the very least rotj . 
  it was n't called * return of the jedi * for nothing . 
  it 's a travesty that lucas replaced shaw with christensen at the end of rotj in the special edition , since it seems to nullify all of anakin 's character growth . 
  we saw him a few minutes ago , though . 
  are we going to completely ignore context and the existence of idioms ? 
  what 's the last time you heard the phrase `` having an affair '' where it did n't mean `` cheating on someone '' ? 
  well , cane sugar . 
  hfcs is also sugar , just a slightly different kind . 
  they went on sale on steam this holiday season , i got a bunch of them and replayed them . 
  did you know the steam versions pack an entire copy of scummvm with them , leading them to be compatible with all platforms ( but kinda bloated ) ? 
  and if you press f5 , you can mess around with the rendering settings . 
  going back and playing them , they 're a lot simpler than they felt as a kid . 
  smb3 i still feel like i do n't completely understand , but pp goes to the moon i feel like i completely memorized after one playthrough . 
  ( some of the games are randomized , though , like ps3 , so you need multiple playthroughs to discover all of them . ), 
  also , the quality of the audio and animation is really , really impressive in hindsight , having worked with games from that era . 
  imagine those barbershop intro themes , they actually got together a choir to record them , and then they jammed them on a tiny rom along tons of graphics and dialogue and * it still sounded decent . 
  * amazing . 
  wow , amazing coincidence . 
  sega megadrive was the shit . 
  great audio system ( although it sucked at smooth sounds ), 
  they can bond over how shitty it is to rule hungary, 
  where 's the gif from ? 
  does this have historical basis ? 
  no , 95 % of the posts there are awkwardly arranged text , it desperately needs more original content, 
  the terrible thing is , those phonotactics are normally absolutely haram in finnish . 
  the `` f '' sound is used in certain loanwords , but beginning a word with two consecutive consonants * and * including the `` f '' sound ... how disgusting . 
  ( interestingly , the finnish managed to import both european phonotactics * and * the f sound for loanwords , while the philippine languages only managed to import the former of the two . 
  this is probably because finnish has been next to swedish for almost a millennium , while the philippine languages have only been in contact with spanish and english for about four centuries . ), 
  you 'd be hard-pressed to overdose on lsd, 
  `` toronto '' sounds japanese anyway, 
  wait , there 's * ten ? 
  * i always thought there were , like , four . 
  let me try :, 
  - alberta, 
  - northwest british something-or-other, 
  edit : conflated nwt and bc . 
  forgot about yukon and ontario , which is a crime , since yukon was in c&h and ontario is in a song . 
  turns out nunavut really is named that ( i thought that it was just a city ) . 
  knew about saskatchewan but forgot the name ( it is famous for almost but not quite being rectangular ) . 
  thought nova scotia was just an island , not a province . 
  overall score : ~ ~ 5/10 ~ ~ 4/10 . 
  shit . 
  4/10 then . 
  what are the other two ? 
  it 's fine . 
  for a lang with a history , you may want some fossilized irregular forms ; for example , in hungarian , we have `` amerikai '' , `` budapesti '' , `` k\u00ednai '' , but also `` angol '' , `` osztr\u00e1k '' , `` orosz '' . 
  this is fine for ie languages . 
  latin did it . 
  comprehensible . 
  i have a background in multiple slavic languages , though , so it may take a speaker of just one a little longer to figure it out . 
  ( when learning ocs , it took me embarrassingly long to figure out that `` vo '' was the equivalent of czech 'n' slovak `` ve '' . 
  speaking of which , if this is an auxlang , remember that ocs was used as a slavic auxlang for a long while . ), 
  just my luck , my ming did it every time ... 
  i thought / r/noisygifs could only be gifs with sfx , but here comes one that you ca n't watch without a sarcastic also sprach zarathustra playing in your head . 
  which collection has comments on it ? 
  i have the complete collection , and it just has dates . 
  well , it lasts longer if it 's a ball . 
  before opening this thread i was convinced that this would be the top post . 
  ca n't believe it is n't . 
  + points for how well-done it is , - points for lack of originality . 
  no , there 's an even longer dash than an em dash . 
  we use it in hungary to indicate that people are talking ( like quotes in the us ) . 
  so bangla is ... sunni side up ? 
  this . 
  only make comments that are extremely unlikely to annoy anyone . 
  this . 
  it was fine . 
  i dunno about our cousins across the bering strait , but in siberia it was the same old hunting and gathering and being shamanists stuff . 
  you socialize , you get hobbies , you go outside sometimes to hunt or mess around . 
  sometimes there 's drama . 
  there 's endless forest to hunt in , so you 're almost always in familiar terrain . 
  and it 's not like you 're alone ; you 're well aware of where many other people live around you . 
  in modern siberia , the rural life is slightly more depressing , slightly bigger , and much more christian , but not fundamentally different . 
  the town life is like town life anywhere else . 
  that said , my people 's ancestors , the magyars , packed up and left siberia as soon as they learned about the central asian lifestyle . 
  it just barely saved us from extinction by the mongols a few centuries later , but it also directly led to the death and displacement of a number of europeans . 
  i went back to the `` homeland '' around the river ob , and while it did n't look like a * bad * place to live , i kind of missed the carpathian basin all the same . 
  well , few people really `` pronounce '' cheat codes , and i doubt the ones that do have anywhere near a consensus, 
  but why would that `` forget '' it ? 
  holy shit , this sub actually produces something vaguely funny . 
  i never thought i 'd see the day . 
  in hungary , every year we get heatwaves in the upper 30s . 
  then a few old and weak people die . 
  we 're the only uralic people to regularly die from heatwaves . 
  or hard drive, 
  oh man it 's like a cellular automaton or something . 
  i wonder how it was designed, 
  which one ? 
  the romans would have fallen anyway, 
  maybe for men to not rape people ? 
  yeah children are too dumb to know that they 're age group * is ** the one to blame, 
  suspending kids for aave ? 
  that 's fucking idiotic, 
  ( on the other hand the kids in the post totally deserved it ), 
  i ca n't remember . 
  maybe icq ? 
  or iwiw,
