  jeb fix this, 
  mac os 8 = =d, 
  right . 
  like , `` god '' does n't really make people anyway . 
  * people * make people , * naturally * , within themselves . 
  i do n't understand what they 'd have against clones , who were simply conceived a different way than most other humans . 
  ( but they definitely would . 
  :( it 's just terrible reasoning . ), 
   icy what you did there . 
  ftfy, 
  well , he probably inked it after doodling it , for the internetz . 
  cascade is a pretty terrible choice , to be honest . 
  for my sister , something as simple as [ s ] dave : accelerate . 
  worked , but i doubt that it 's good for most people . 
  maybe [ s ] descend . 
  heh , once my friends that i showed homestuck actually * finish * homestuck i 'll show them that . 
  seer of time . 
  he 'd put up with the ridiculous codpiece ? 
  i always thought that `` blood '' meant `` unity '' , and that the `` witch '' aspect gave one acute control over their aspect . 
  so , you 'll have acute control over unity . 
  create and destroy allegiances as you wish !, 
  that 's pretty damn scary . 
  why do i have you tagged as `` am not from moscow . '', 
  in blue ? 
  i have a really great one at 00:1 f :5 b : b6 : c9 :93, 
  that was actually a pretty good one . 
  i hope you die . 
  they 're both actually canonically the same design . 
  wow , you even got all the lusus !, 
  ahahaha , i 've already received two downvotes for talking about tags !, 
  ( jerks ) i 'm tagging you as `` tagged me as ` confused tagger ' in red . '', 
  in red . 
  yup !, 
  haha , that was awesome . 
  magnetic screwdriver & amp ; & amp ; sonic toothbrush = [ do i really have to say it ? ], 
  sonic screwdriver | | iphone = sonic idriver, 
  sonic idriver | | amp = vox director [ now we 're getting somewhere ], 
  vox director | | violin bow = archetier 's wand [ finally ], 
  toy pistol & & copper bar | | gunpowder = pistol, 
  2xpistolkind | | microscope = cyclotron, 
  cyclotron & & archetier 's wand = higgs ' arousal, 
  yeah . 
  it 's also really convenient how i have a sonic screwdriver lying around ... ( actually i do , but it 's nowhere near powerful enough to do anything useful besides be a flashlight and annoy people ; it was a fun engineering project , though ), 
  [ this has in fact happened before . 
  ] ( http://darwinawards.com/stupid/stupid2004-01.html ), 
  is n't he being at least somewhat sarcastic about it ? 
  i am going to crosspost this to / r/atheism before you do , out of spite . 
  what is even the point of this . 
  what do they * gain * by this ? 
  why do i feel that i 've seen this exact comment before . 
  xpost . 
  from / r/athiesm, 
  i before the e, 
  i might have preferred that he explain that using self-reference to prove something is a fallacy , rather than making a comparison . 
  but this works very well , too . 
  are you new to these parts of reddit ? 
  the thumb is a finger . 
  we 're lucky to have it opposing all of the other fingers . 
  but it 's still a finger . 
  and if someone says to you that it 's because it has one less joint , the backmost joint is hidden beneath the skin and manifests as a bulge in the side of your palm directly following your wrist . 
  i looked in his comment history to see whether he was really trolling people . 
  he seems to be a legit user , though . 
  edit : i may have to eat my words . 
  a while ago , he posted this :, 
   nice ... 
  i said i from honduras and yet i am across the globe . 
  like i said , i 'm not undermining the cultural contributions made by americans !, 
  i do n't know where you get that from !, 
  i am one of the biggest fans of american pop culture , its music , its films , and its folklore , if you can call it that . 
  i 'm just saying that americans as a whole , more so than any other people from any other `` first world '' country i 've been to , and i 've been to many , seem to be less informed , or willing to become informed , about cultures other than their own , geography and `` worldly '' subjects like you would call them . 
  and even though some , in my experience , are just plain stupid , they have this attitude of `` i 'm better than you simply because i 'm from the u.s. ohh , and by the way do they have running water in your country ? 
  do you live in houses or are there only shacks ? 
  cars ? 
  heard of those ? '', 
  that 's not to say there are n't smart or informed americans !, 
  of course there are . 
  but this does n't seem to be the norm , at least in the youths . 
  people seem to be consumed by the pop culture which undeniably includes tv shows and music that do n't contribute whatsoever to the intellect of young americans . 
  it 's like those dystopian novels in which , even though the society is super advanced , its inhabitants have been dumbed down by all the comfort they enjoy and all the information they have access to , even though it is mostly unused . 
  tell me that is n't longer than the post he criticized as `` tl ; dr lol '' . 
   it does n't make a difference , no . 
  but it 's a little detail that is wrong . 
  listen to yourself . 
  well , i mean the joints that you `` feel for '' in the hands . 
  they 'll be like , `` see , all the other ones have three , but this one only has two !, 
  what now ? '', 
  it 's okay , my next one will be completely original . 
  holy shit , that really is way the hell down ... 
  i do n't think you deserve * that * . 
  i , for one , definitely remember the christmas of that year , because of temporal proximity to 9/11 . 
  then again , no one said it was n't . 
  it 's still funny . 
  do i smell a flash approaching ? 
  ( please let it be `` knife 's edge '' from * strife * ), 
  this is ingenious !, 
  i 'm not sure how well it catches the wind , though . 
  well , you * are * the seer of plots , so ... 
  i believe . 
  heh , someone liked temporal shenanigans , did they ? 
  well , i 'm not sure how i 'd do outfits , but i totally know how i 'd do computation :,
