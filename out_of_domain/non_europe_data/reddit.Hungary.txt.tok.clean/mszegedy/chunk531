  what did you do with all your money ? 
  the amount of internet you managed to squeeze into such a short shitpost is incredible, 
  thank you for your sacrifice , and godspeed . 
  is n't that sort of the original definition ? 
  the `` amin love with you '' also works for biochemists and beginner tagalog students,

  i guess someone was tired of people pronouncing his name phonetically ? 
  alas , with incremental games , the one thing they 're not is interesting, 
  wait , it was deleted ? 
  dammit, 
  i 'm pretty sure fat people outweigh most things, 
  how many fat people you need depends on the size of the boulder , but sure, 
  also smog , fuck smog, 
  wow , i really thought it was gon na be a rickroll, 
  oh man i still remember the first time . 
  we should open up a betting pool behind your back for the third, 
  * everybody * knows tamil came first you ignorant fuck, 
  a different , creative take on `` i hate my southern neighbor '' , cool !, 
  now all that 's left is for the inuits to commit suicide . 
  actually , for * everybody * in the arctic to commit suicide . 
  i 'd rather aradia , because her powers and role are closer to sans 's . 
  what ??? 
  there 's still uralic , samoyed , and `` ostyak '' , presumably . 
  yeah , the guy you replied to was thinking of crackers, 
  bosch seems to have never seen a naked man , but plenty of naked women, 
  seriously , where do you get ahold of people who will do illegal things to protect you , in exchange for money ?

   this was back when opening an attachment on an email was not completely insane . 
  the 70s ? 
  and in proto-uralic , it meant `` face-down '' , and has cognates in nearly every living uralic language . 
  this is irrelevant , but very interesting . 
  here 's what i do n't get . 
  when i go scuba diving , the system that my air in is sealed , right ? 
  there 's me , my bcd , my regulator , a bunch of tubes , and the tank . 
  some parts of this system are soft , e.g. 
  the bcd , my chest , the tubes , some parts of my regulator , but generally the airflow between them is regulated , so that most of the time they 're closed off from everything else . 
  so then what component is it that lets the water pressure affect the air in the system ? 
  because everyone knows that the deeper you dive , the more your air compresses , the faster you go through it , etc etc etc. 
  but why ? 
  the only two things i can think of that are big and soft enough to react to pressure are my body and the bcd , but the bcd seems to be sealed off from everything else , and my body certainly does n't feel like it 's compressing . 
  is there some component on the regulator that lets the pressure in ? 
  did n't they change their name recently ? 
  thanks but i know that . 
  i 'm asking why it compresses in the first place . 
  the air 's `` container '' is mostly rigid , and where it is n't , it does n't seem like compressing it would make the air compress in proportion with the water pressure . 
  now we 're getting somewhere . 
  how is the water pushing on my lungs ? 
  they 're inside me . 
  my skin is outside me , which can in turn push on my lungs , but it does n't feel like my skin is particularly compressing , and it 's held up by my skeleton anyway . 
  puffing up my chest does n't seem harder underwater than on the surface , although in both cases it 's a little abnormally harder because of the wet suit . 
  in retrospect , i guess the point at which the water pressure affects the density of the air has to be on my body somewhere . 
  otherwise , your lungs swelling up and bursting when you 're ascending would n't be a problem . 
  interesting , i have absolutely no interest in * the office * and have never googled anything related to it , but the dwight picture is second for me . 
  must be a geographic thing . 
  the opposite would have been much worse . 
  see : the etherkiller, 
  in an app on my phone, 
  / r/all, 
  shoulda loaned the latin for `` ton '' instead . 
  in hungarian it 's `` tonhal '' , while `` ton '' is `` tonna '', 
  heh , i guess i picked the right subreddit to ask in . 
  i understand fluid pressure in general , but the case of the scuba diver i find confusing . 
  i think it 's because your body * seems * like a rigid container , but it 's not . 
  your lungs get compressed , which you learn in the diver 's manual , but moreover your whole * body * gets compressed . 
  you 'd think your skeleton would hold your skin and internal organs in shape , but i guess your skin 's more elastic than it seems . 
  something interesting to look out for next time i go diving . 
  damn , now you 've got me wondering how pumps actually work . 
  it 's certainly on wikipedia , but just looking it up does n't seem fun . 
  geologically space tends to be * somewhat * different from earth , because a lot of our geology is influenced by all the life that 's lived here . 
  that said , the moon 's probably the most geologically normal celestial body that 's anywhere close to us, 
  i do n't think so . 
  what i do think contributed is that i followed a link in this thread , instead of searching it on my own . 
  have you seen how much metadata google stuffs in the url ? 
  in hungary , the words `` b\u00f6ng\u00e9sz\u0151 '' and `` browser ( brauszer/br \u00e1uz\u00f6r / whatever ) '' fight to the death, 
  ironically , rationalwiki would tell you that reversed stupidity is n't intelligence, 
  cantonesingaporean stir fry and char siu pork . 
  will edit with recipe , but essentially the stir fry is done by drowning jiangmen noodles in curry powder and ridicolously hot avocado oil , and the pork is done by drowning loin in hoisin sauce and honey . 
  char siu is not a secret though , it 's just how i do it . 
  protein engineering ( my job ) : what are you working on right now ? 
  ( most people ca n't fake enthusiasm about a molecule or two ), 
  linguistics ( my hobby ) : what 's the primary language family of english , and what are its branches ? 
  ( basic litmus test ; most decisive piece of info is whether they remember to include anatolian ), 
  uralic linguistics ( also my hobby ) : draw me a uralic family tree . 
  ( uralic linguistics has n't really agreed on a family tree ; it 's interesting to see even an expert 's response to this ), 
  if you notice , the roman chestplates actually do n't have well-defined abs . 
  that 's because they preferred the javelin thrower 's physique , with strong pecs but a flat abdomen . 
  outlier . 
  see the examples on the [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muscle_cuirass ), 
   hungarian ( which is considered sae ), 
  by haspelmath , whose classification i 'm dubious of . 
  hungarian is pretty well-integrated into the european sprachbund , but not * that * well-integrated . 
  since i 'm interested in reviewing how european hungarian is anyway , let 's walk through [ his list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/standard_average_european#standard_average_european_as_a_sprachbund ) :, 
  definite and indefinite articles : yes , uniquely so for uralic languages, 
  postnominal relative clauses with inflected relative pronouns : yes , although this is a widespread uralic trait, 
  periphrastic perfect with `` have '' : no, 
  experiencers as subjects : not usually , although there is definitely a european influence ( e.g. 
  passive construction formed with a participle and a copula : it exists , but is barely used . 
  far more common is a passive affix on the verb,
