  anticausative verbs with both inchoative and causative meanings : no , the causative form usually has at least an affix, 
  dative external possessors : yes , and this is an unusual trait for a uralic language , where there are three common types of possession , two of which are found in hungarian, 
  verbal negation with a negative indefinite : yes , although it 's accompanied by a particle meaning `` not even '', 
  comparative particle like `` than '' : yes , and it even follows a similar pattern of usage to latin 's, 
  use of an adverb to indicate an equative construction : no , it has a construction unique among european languages that uses the aforementioned comparative particle, 
  obligatory subject : no , and how is this `` euroversal '' ? 
  differentiation between intensive and reflexive pronouns : yes , with multiple kinds of both . 
  however , polite pronouns are undifferentiated from reflexive pronouns, 
  overall score : ~ 6/12 , which is n't very promising . 
  these are supposed to be nearly universal among sae languages . 
  with the list of characteristics that are unusual outside of europe , it scores about the same :, 
  vso or vos in yes/no questions : not as such , sentences are frequently vso anyway and questions are frequently svo, 
  comparative inflection for adjectives : yes , but this is an extremely widespread trait in uralic languages , and the hungarian comparative suffix is descended directly from a proto-uralic suffix that became a comparative suffix in many other uralic languages, 
  conjunction construction `` a , b , and c '' : yes , unambiguously borrowed from indo-europeans, 
  combined comitative/sociative and instrumental cases : yes , although relatively recently, 
  suppletivism in `` second '' vs `` two '' : yes ; the horribly weird thing is , `` first '' vs `` one '' * does n't * exhibit suppletivism , although it is irregular, 
  no alienable/inalienable possession distinction : no , which i understand is kind of strange for a uralic language ? 
  no inclusive/exclusive distiction : yes , although this was a trait of proto-uralic as well, 
  no productive usage of reduplication : no, 
  topic and focus expressed by intonation and word order : yes, 
  svo word order : no, 
  only one gerund , preference for finite subordinate clauses : no , yes ; the latter is an unambiguous borrowing from europe, 
  `` neither-nor '' construction : yes , very likely borrowed, 
  phrasal adverbs : no, 
  tendency towards replacement of past by perfect : no , does n't even have a perfect tense, 
  overall score : 8/15 counting the features descended from the uralic period , 5/15 not . 
  finally , let 's take a look at the other , more optional criteria ( mostly phonological ) :, 
  - no velar/uvular contrast : yes, 
  - voicing contrast : yes , unusual but not unheard of for uralic languages, 
  - initial consonant clusters of the type `` stop + sonorant '' : no , unless you count affricates, 
  - only pulmonic consonants : yes , but this is arguably not relevant since it 's also a trait of 100 % of uralic languages and many other families, 
  - at least three degrees of vowel height contrast : yes , although this as a feature of all uralic languages and forms the basis of their vowel harmony systems, 
  - no lateral fricatives or affricates : yes , although proto-uralic probably did n't have any either, 
  - predominantly suffixing morphology : yes , but this is a feature of all uralic languages and a distinguishing feature of the entire language family, 
  - moderately synthetic fusional morphology : depends on your point of view ; it is far less fusional than any european language , but not completely agglutinative ; i 'd say no , at least not in the way that haspelmath was thinking, 
  - nom-acc alignment : yes , although this is a universal uralic feature, 
  overall score : 7/9 counting the pan-uralic features , 2/9 not . 
  this might have been what convinced haspelmath to consider hungarian sae , but imo it highlights the similarity between the ie and uralic families more than anything . 
  if you were trying to pigeonhole hungarian as typologically european , there are a couple more features you could point out , such as the lack of a negative verb ( although there 's still the modal distiction of * nem * , `` not '' , vs * ne * , `` do n't '' ) ... which is in fact the opposite of the change that happened to spoken english , which now has a negative verb . 
  as a whole , though , it definitely comes across as more of a uralic language that is in the process of being absorbed into the sprachbund , than a chameleon . 
   developing object incorporation, 
  we 've had it for at least a thousand years , there 's no `` developing '' about it . 
  tbf many kids do this . 
  kids are shits . 
  no problem !, 
   i like this . 
  -  i ** do n't ** like this . 
   she like ** s ** this . 
  -  she ** does n't ** like this . 
  this is a negative verb . 
  it inflects for person , instead of the actual verb . 
  compare the finnish negative verb :, 
   l\u00e4hd ** en ** . 
  most uralic languages have a negative verb , but hungarian lost it . 
  english did n't used to have a negative verb , but now it has a very robust one . 
  he has a pretty risqu\u00e9 tumblr , iirc, 
  the english negative verb developed from `` do/does/did not '' . 
  i 'm not sure when it developed , unfortunately ; there 's probably a paper on it somewhere . 
  the phasing out of the uncontracted form was probably very gradual , though . 
  it 's not limited to spoken language , but while in spoken language it 's practically obligatory , in written language it 's a colloquialism at best . 
  i 'm referring to * does n't / do n't / did n't * . 
  imo the presence of do/does/did in the language as an auxiliary verb is weirder , but seeing an ie language with a negative verb is also pretty weird . 
  ah , that was john mcwhorter 's idea , was n't it ? 
  very probably , there 's no reason to doubt it based on the evidence he gives . 
  sorry , i edited my response . 
  it seems to be a john mcwhorter thing . 
  h i s t o r i c a l, 
  why 's the earth so huge compared to the moon ? 
  should n't they have similar sizes at this distance ? 
  sure , but the satellite is also very very far away . 
  the moon is already very far away from the earth , and the satellite is four times * that * distance off . 
  n\u0254t, 
  it 's the loops that get you, 
  i wonder how many proteins i could actually identify offhand ? 
  amyloid fiber , collagen , actin , hemoglobin ( as long as there 's four of it ) , ubiquitin , proteosomes , that synthase that looks like a ring , the two walking motor proteins whose names i forget , atp synthase , and the protein i work on ... this is n't a bad party idea if you 're ultra-nerds, 
   statehood, 
  probably not for the whole thing , though . 
  maybe three or four states . 
  unfortunately i 'm a huge linguistics enthusiast , so i 'm an outlier, 
  scribbling proteins : hard, 
  reciting their amino acid sequence : very very hard, 
  reciting their dna sequence : impossible, 
  the thing is , if you did know the sequences offhand , it would actually be a cool challenge . 
  you can use your favorite arpeggio . 
  i 've seen both , but the upside-down letters primarily in the us , and the logical symbols primarily in hungary . 
  i guess it 's a central/eastern euro thing, 
  one of the few advantages of being a grower, 
  doubt it , it 's not like we 're known for inventing new notation, 
  it 's not god-awful , how dare you ? 
  there 's still one at ewr ? 
  i think ? 
  new ( a ) rk, 
  beats me . 
  probably because there 's a million other places that begin with `` new '' . 
  / r/montageparodies just ran out of content . 
  it only `` went to shit '' because it started retreading the same ground and boring everyone . 
  it 's * my * go-to for a form of entertainment with enough potential that it lasted for a while , but not enough to last more than a year . 
  also the lifesaver `` qat '' , which i at least tend to pronounce with / q /, 
  that might be sae and rp , at least for english dialects, 
  also break up kola by drawing a nice horizontal line .
