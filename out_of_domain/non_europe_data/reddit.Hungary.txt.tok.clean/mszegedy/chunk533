  make the northern part sami , and the southern part novgorodian . 
  something all the uralic peoples can unite over : getting terrorized by the russians, 
  well , us hungarians were also terrorized by the austrians and ottomans more , but we 're not gon na discount 1848 , 1949-1991 , etc. 
  although the 1960s onward were relatively cordial . 
  i 'm mostly salty on behalf of karelia , though . 
  but ... * everyone * in southeast asia is partially descended from the java man , are n't they ? 
  is this guy like that extremely drug-tolerant artist who had exceptionally large amounts of neanderthal dna ? 
  0.6 sdes !, 
  yes !, 
  sounds like the original jersey, 
  this is bad for your uterus i think ? 
  i seriously doubt that microsoft shills make a significant impact on votes any of the time, 
  i am a hungarian who used to live on the slovak border . 
  here are some 130 % true facts about slovaks :, 
  - they are all conceived , birthed , and baptised in barns . 
  - they drink 10 liters of alcohol for every liter of water they drink . 
  - this alcohol is often in the form of p\u00e1linka , but slovaks would never admit to liking something hungarian . 
  - slovaks ski and skate often , and get pointlessly upset about hockey , which is an inconsequential sport for morons . 
  they do this skiing and skating in popr\u00e1d , which is where everyone else goes for a winter holiday as well ( if austria is too expensive ) . 
  - they hate the fact that the southern third of the country is made of hungarians , so they do whatever they can to be able to pretend that they do n't exist . 
  - slovak is not a real language . 
  it is just badly spoken czech . 
  - similarly , slovak is not a real nationality , either . 
  slovaks are just a lineage of czechs who had hereditary mental illnesses and were concentrated by force in the south . 
  i thought it was caviar, 
  the slivers thing is kind of like going scuba diving in a place where there are bioluminescent plankton . 
  fun . 
  there 's something about the aesthetic that 's so cool . 
  keep doing this !, 
  ( i like hockey very much , but not understanding why people get all worked up about hockey is integral to stereotyping slovakia ), 
  well , there 's rakija and so on , and it would be foolish to pretend that it did n't originate in the carpathian basin or even the balkans somewhere , but claiming that it 's hungarian is a vital component of hungarian nationalism , which i was trying to emulate here somewhat . 
  yes , and it 's also a [ nationalist song 's lyrics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ortfuczkpo0 ), 
  i know which map you 're talking about , it was in cod4 . 
  ca n't remember name either, 
  wow , people on the internet are terrible at differentiating what is meant to be funny from what is meant to be factual, 
  would n't the odds be significantly greater because of this process ? 
  nice of it to take the little crevice instead of a seat, 
  huh ? 
  13/14 = 92.8 , which on the standard american grading scale is an a. 
  and that 's if you round down both sides . 
  damn , is this from the first scene of * rebel without a cause * ? 
  that 's an * old * reference . 
  wait shit no, 
  i guess it depends on how you grade it . 
  i personally would n't square it , that 's cruel . 
  hell , west of the danube . 
  it would n't look out of place in western hungary . 
  wait i never read this but i know it 's well-regarded . 
  why should i read it ? 
  is it entertainingly bad ? 
   rounding down the numerator decreases the fraction 's value . 
   rounding down the denominator increases the fraction 's value . 
  indeed , but the numerator has a fractional component of 0.6 or so , while the denominator has a fractional component less than 0.1 . 
  it 's all probably within the margin of error . 
  if i truly had to grade it , i 'd give it a 100 % . 
  what ? 
  ( it 's one fourth of ( 2 cm ) ^ ( 2 ) , but that 's entirely not what 's being discussed here . ), 
  i thought i might have missed the original measurements being some linear component , in which case squaring would make some amount of sense , but they 're not . 
  it 's just two areas . 
  so squaring it makes no sense at all . 
  the more obvious badling here is that they 're not recognizing the cultural and historical value of linguistic diversity . 
  the extinction of all the world 's languages would be extremely sad . 
  unrelatedly : is n't news article comments sort of low-hanging fruit ? 
  technical limitations, 
  ### comments, 
  title explains everything . 
  neat how they form a belt across asia and across the western americas . 
  notice that wikipedia does n't like tagging african or philippine languages as agglutinative , for some reason , even though both locations contain an abundance of them . 
  meanwhile they tagged every single obscure andamanese language , including sentinelese which we know nothing about ? 
  tsk tsk tsk . 
  also , glottolog 's locations are * very * approximate sometimes . 
  you 'd be hard-pressed to find a mansi speaker north of where the ob splits in two , and west of yugorsk , yet look where the hell it puts it . 
  again , though , it freaking nails the andamanese languages , which do n't even exist anymore ... 
  ### disclaimer, 
  `` agglutinative '' is a subjective judgement , and wikipedia is not the best at linguistics . 
  the article `` old european hydronymy '' is tagged as an agglutinative language ffs . 
  wals online has a less subjective dataset that goes on two axes ( affixation and fusion , basically ) , but it 's even sparser than this one . 
  ### recipe, 
  i used scripts to make this , but they were all in the console . 
  here 's the gist of it :, 
  ask wikipedia to export the `` agglutinative languages '' category, 
  ask glottolog for the languoids csv file, 
  run the following python :, 
  import subprocess, 
  ids = subprocess.call ( r `` cat wikipedia-20160206071531 . xml | grep - o - e ` glotto = [ a-z ] \\ + [ 0-9 ] \\ + ' | grep - o - e ' [ a-z ] \\ + [ 0-9 ] \\ + ' '' , shell = true ), 
  out = '', 
  for id in ids :, 
  try :, 
  location = subprocess.check _ output ( r `` cat languoid.csv | grep '' + id + r '' | grep - o - e ' , - \\ ? [ 0-9 . ] \\ + , language , - \\ ? [ 0-9 . 
  ] \\ + ' '' , shell = true ), 
  location = location.split ( ), 
  out + = location [ 0 ] + '' '' + location [ 1 ], 
  out + = '' { '' + subprocess.check _ output ( r `` cat languoid.csv | grep '' + id + r '' | grep - o - e ' , language , [ ^ , ] * , [ ^ , ] * , [ ^ , ] \\ + ' | grep - o - e ' [ ^ , ] \\ + $ ' '' , shell = true ) [ : -1 ] + '' } \\ n '', 
  pass, 
  file = open ( `` out.txt '' , `` w '' ), 
  file.write ( out ), 
  file.close ( ), 
  then just copy and paste the contents of the file into the `` bulk add '' box of mapcustomizer , and there you have it . 
  this could be done for any wikipedia category that contains languages . 
  i do n't recommend it , though , because wikipedia is not the best at linguistics ( although it certainly tries ) .
