  if you want , tomorrow i 'll do a comparison for you between a text in english , hungarian , and tagalog . 
  ( probably `` the north wind and the sun '' . ), 
  ultimately this is a very abstract argument that only has merit as far as finding a useful definition of `` agglutinative '' , but i do feel that there are significant structural similarities between philippine languages and ( other ) agglutinative languages that are n't present elsewhere . 
  \\  turkey and india, 
  \\  remotely the same thing, 
  it 's from [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/3kqecs/theory_the_god_squad_and_fusion/ ), 
  he 's overly critical , he never listens ... he just does n't understand !, 
  no it 's just the `` textese '' in the book is * bad * . 
  like they could have written it realistically and idiomatically , but they did n't because they do n't know the first thing about it . 
  a redditor who browses / r/cringepics or something could do better, 
  but methane is nonpolar . 
  i feel like one of the defining characteristics of being `` wet '' is that it clings to your skin and gets everywhere . 
  the trick is giving up on ever being able to use teff flour properly and just thickening it with regular flour instead, 
  as soon as ethiopia pulled out the fork and knife you could tell she had no intention of actually eating anything, 
  the etymologies are related , but backwards . 
  `` hindistan '' or `` hindustan '' is a cross-linguistically common name for india , originally meaning `` land of the hindus '' ( or somewhat more literally `` hindu-ia '' ) . 
  turkeys were * later * named `` hindi '' in turkish , after the location . 
  / r/shittytumblrgifs , bow down to your lord, 
  if it 's the former , he [ lives in orlando ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ecf12tt.png ), 
  that too , although really a youtube video would be best . 
  every legit shitty tumblr gif could be crossposted to / r/gifsthatendtoosoon though really, 
  yeah , this post is a product of its society if you know what i mean, 
  but damn , they sang with actual harmony !, 
  must have been hard to teach them that, 
  did you know if you google the word `` gullible '' your reddit profile is the first result ? 
  most things felt tacked on in 40k . 
  in the grim darkness of the far future , there is no coherent design philosophy , only war !, 
  it 's alright no one reads this buzzfeed-oid garbage, 
  / r/explainlikeimcalvin, 
  least socially-acceptable ? 
  i 'd tell you some less socially-acceptable ones , but they 're too socially-unnaceptable to say out loud . 
  ( hint : they involve racial slurs ), 
  edit : you see , they 're so socially-unacceptable that even mentioning them gets downvotes !, 
  well , 'cause it used to not be a slur , and some people still have n't caught up with the language change . 
  personally i like to hop ahead on the euphemism treadmill by using `` differently abled '' as a slur, 
  there are many things wrong with this statement , but mostly it 's that that 's not what a slur is . 
  slurs are insults . 
  `` retarded '' was a diagnosis . 
  but `` nigger '' was always a slur . 
  it just became less socially acceptable . 
  similar process , but the difference is that it was always derogatory . 
  chocolate melts at body temperature or so . 
  anything above 100 \u00b0 f will do the job . 
  exactly what i was thinking . 
  `` wow , this guy was organized . '', 
  doing it to get votes is shrewd and not very socially acceptable , but there 's nothing inherently wrong with changing your accent . 
  what 's worse is `` unang ginoo '' is * five * syllables, 
  i mean , i desire beijing too . 
  not to core it , but to * have * it . 
  also most importantly it comes first in the alphabet, 
  it 's not slang in any sense , but it has n't gone out of style in millennia , so i doubt it would now, 
  sounds like a risqu\u00e9 kevin & kell strip, 
  is that ... kebab baguette ? 
  muh franco-ottoman alliance, 
  the comet dumped nutrients into the lake duh . 
  although what dumping nutrients into a lake would actually get you is an algal bloom, 
  genius !, 
  i speak tagalog , the third most spoken language in nevada , but i do n't think that would help too much, 
  some people casually make pop culture references to famous works . 
  lotr is up there with star wars as one of the most popularly quoted works . 
  hey it 's like you 've met chris christie, 
  wow , for once , a version of this picture that is n't saturated all to hell . 
  good job !, 
  i 'm on low-power-mode on my phone , does n't make a difference, 
  ah yes , the judgemental one is n't the one who calls people `` judgemental bitches '' and shits on liberal arts degrees . 
  how about just no one bothers anyone about their jobs ? 
  depends where he lives . 
  the prediction is dead wrong for , say , eastern europe , but maybe he lives in california or something ( although come to think of it most high schools in the bay area still have pretty traditional architecture ) . 
  it 's russian . 
  older versions of windows encoded russian with the win-1251 codepage . 
  now it uses codepages 1252-1256 , breaking backwards compatibility . 
  to make it comprehensible again , change the parts of the registry that point to the codepages 1252-1256 to all point to 1251 , or just replace the codepage files themselves in system32 with 1251 's . 
  ( hilariously , neither of the languages you listed have any diacritics . 
  try vietnamese , or an obscure north american language like navajo ), 
  yes it 's a joke good job, 
  this thread was fun , but seriously , language change * very rarely * or * never * happens for a reason like that . 
   i ` vve never seen reddit congeal around rejecting a modern definition before ; usually the collective opinion of the commenters is summed up by one guy who responds `` it 's almost like languages and meanings change over time '' and that 's the end of it . 
  it happens , like , every day here . 
  the worst threads are the askreddit threads titled something like `` what 's a word everyone uses wrong '', 
  i think the hate for aave would fall under that , as well as the hate for `` literally '' ( which has been used emphatically for hundreds of years ) . 
  rule 6 : what ??? 
  just what the titlicking christ ? 
  how would arabic not having a phoneme from the english name of palestine have anything to do with the state at all ? 
  is this like the eddie izzard `` no flag , no country '' routine , except with pronounceable english names ? 
  have you ever heard about the philippines or finland , both of whose official languages do n't natively have the / f / phoneme and yet have it in their name ? 
  it 's a joke, 
  will they finally learn how to patch kde2 under freebsd ? 
  i ca n't read the article on mobile , thank you, 
  silly , the alveolar approximant is actually the alveolar trill , the americans pronounce it wrong, 
  google ca n't pronounce my work , for various reasons :, 
  - latex markup, 
  - long , weird , technical words, 
  - people with strange names cited, 
  also sometimes i write linguistics papers , and those do n't work because they contain more than just english . 
  `` should we make it alphabetical order ? '', 
  \\* starts organizing the pictures into alphabetical order while waiting for a response \\*, 
  make a second , identical decision that then activates that does n't give the prestige boost, 
  he was pushed back by surprise , spiders are light, 
  wait , there was a f4 movie last year ? 
  what kind of lenovo keyboard still has those bulgy keys ?
