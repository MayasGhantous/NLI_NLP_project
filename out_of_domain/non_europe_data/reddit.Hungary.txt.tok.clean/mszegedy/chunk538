  but there remains the problem of `` painting '' the hexes . 
  if i do n't print the design on them , then how do i do it ? 
  if regular printers can handle cardstock , then i can print it , but fifty sheets of colored tiles would take lots of toner . 
  i have colored markers that i can use to scribble on them by hand , but that does n't sound worth it . 
  well , you can sell your account to companies to use as a shill account , but other than that , i do n't know, 
  oops , ah , you 're right . 
  i forgot that they were being tiled badly instead of normally . 
  edit : i strongly suspect that it 's impossible to fit more than 6 on one sheet . 
  see [ this ] ( http://www.packomania.com/ ) website on optimal packings of circles . 
  if it were 11.5 `` x8 .5 '' , you 'd suddenly be able to fit 7 easily . 
  edit : legal-sized should fit 8 easily , however , possibly 9 . 
  edit : i strongly suspect that it 's impossible to fit more than 8 on one legal sheet . 
  as someone who 's okay at understanding spanish , the english translation does n't lose much imo . 
  sure , but not today . 
  generally it 's just pronouns moonlighting in both roles and eventually getting grammaticalized . 
  for example , following malcolm ross 's reconstruction , the `` genitive 1 '' form of the personal pronouns in proto-austronesian became the ergative case in tagalog and many other philippine languages , and retained its genitive function as well . 
  this resulted in a system like what you described , except the morpheme is still treated as a separate word . 
  it 's relatively rare to observe this in action , though . 
  in proto-uralic , the possessive endings and personal verb endings were already more or less identical , clearly both coming from agglutinated personal pronouns . 
  the personal verb endings became the definite ( read : ergative ) verb endings in the ugric languages ( this is not the whole story , but it 's true for hungarian ) , and they ended up with a broadly similar system . 
  the real question here is why the uralic personal suffixes ended up as the ugric definite endings rather than the indefinite endings . 
  the indefinite endings , at least in hungarian , are probably derived from various aspect affixes , at least according to alo raun . 
  these tend to be frequentative/habitual sorts of affixes , which are used without an object far more frequently than with . 
  i suppose this is how they were able to edge out the established personal affixes . 
  as for the philippine example , the absolutive pronouns are descended from the austronesian nominative pronouns and sometimes other cases . 
  based on these two examples i 'd conclude that the absolutive subject is more prone to grammaticalization and replacement with random tenuously-related morphemes , while the ergative subject is more stable and thus is more likely to remain similar to the possessive form ( which is also stable and has a parallel origin ) . 
  what you get is an ergative morpheme that resembles the possessive morphemes more than an absolutive morpheme . 
  ha , once one or two people tried to do this to me . 
  they did n't even get ten pages in before giving up . 
  `` and i went back in time and bribed the architect ! '', 
  on another subreddit , i saw someone float the idea of a website where recipes still had stories with them , but the stories were thematically tied to the food . 
  for example , a fried chicken recipe in the style of a southern gothic novel . 
  for real , though , the harder something is , the more easily it shatters, 
  still is , for a certain genre of recipes . 
  really annoying . 
  the squareness gives it away, 
  but it 's * organized *, 
  what do the wingdings say ? 
  wow , i did not expect to see hungary at the top of this thread . 
  very sorry to hear that that happened to you . 
  how did hungary get so many troops as a vassal ? 
  i 'm not sure , but it looks like you 're right . 
  still , that 's a lot of troops for hungary . 
  not just win it . 
  according to nate silver , assuming sanders and clinton are tied , massachusetts needs to be won by 11 % to be on track to beat clinton . 
  hungarian : guly\u00e1s is good when it is hot , spicy , and red . 
  your lukewarm beef soup is not impressive . 
  based on polls and things , i believe it will be a 5 % win or so, 
  i know , but he was 5 % behind the benchmark in nevada , and 6 % behind the benchmark in sc ( if memory serves right ) . 
  it would be odd to lose massachusetts that badly . 
  as a young kid i figured out a truer version of this : if you ca n't see their pupils , they ca n't see your pupils . 
  it sounds useless , but it 's great when everything below your neck is hidden by an obstacle , because chances are that if they see your pupils , then they see the rest of your head , too ( and the converse is also true if you keep your gaze pointed toward them ) . 
  so , you can use their pupils to gauge whether they 've seen you . 
  that 's terrible . 
  you 're using it correctly . 
  na , i * knew * this was hungarian . 
  i wonder if there 's anyone geographically close who does the same kinds of designs . 
  this is going to be a very `` 2010s '' thing in a few decades, 
  wait ... how did you get the soup out ? 
  through the little hole ? 
  it was delivered in [ classical japanese , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/classical_japanese_language ) which is essentially [ early middle japanese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_middle_japanese ) with some extra changes accumulated over time ( but nowhere near as many as actual , spoken japanese had ) . 
  it 's a few centuries older than middle english , but it 's still a good comparison , since pre-1066 english is radically different in vocabulary than post-1066 english . 
  imagine chaucer giving an address , after he had spent about a month in the present day with an old , educated guy . 
  why, 
  i definitely prefer go , mainly because of the excellent music, 
  indeed , the central european version has always done that . 
  it 's nice to see it in the american version as well . 
  how does this bot work ? 
  simple pattern-matching , or some sort of classifier ? 
  i bet a bayesian one would work really well, 
  people love justifying their existence , though, 
  why not both ? 
  they both suck . 
  i have n't tasted a sugar substitute that was nearly as good as sugar itself . 
  the closest i 've tasted is one chocolate made with stevia . 
  that was indistinguishable from chocolate with sugar .

  one of the more obscure and annoying variants of this is `` jak kinase '' . 
  i mean , i get it , and it would sound silly to just say `` jak '' , but the fact remains that expanded , it 's `` just another kinase kinase '' . 
  it 's not helped by the fact that there are literal kinase kinases out there . 
  dunno , i do n't think he created knives, 
  well , clearly something about them does n't work , because tons of immigrants are illegal . 
  it 's more common in porkchop , but it happens occasionally . 
  i 've never been sold one , though ; it 's always my friends and family making it . 
  what i do to solve this is as soon as i hit a corner where a car 's about to go across , i turn 90 \u00b0 and walk that way . 
  the car will go straight across . 
  sometimes this leads me to walking around the car . 
  out of all the wobbly and subjective linguistic statements i 've heard , that 's got to be one of the wobbliest and most subjective . 
  but plants are constantly losing water . 
  makes me want to try using hot glue as thermal paste, 
  me too thanks, 
  truly the pinnacle of evolution, 
  how do you account for the diversity of pilots , then ? 
  apparently mayonnaise works really well , too . 
  you know , if you ever find yourself in that situation again . 
  / w / is labio-velar . 
  the labial approximant would be / \u03b2\u031e / . 
  the articulation of / w / has a strong velar component . 
  because of this , you get sound changes of / w / to other velar consonants , like / w / to / g / in armenian ( where pie `` dwo '' became `` dgo ''  `` rgu ''  `` erku '' ) , or change of initial / w / to / g / in old french , which later formed w/g pairs in english , where french loans coexist with germanic cognates ( warranty/guarantee , ward/guard , wit/guide , wile/guile , and , perhaps the least transparently , wise/guise ) . 
  it 's probably all a persistent joke,
