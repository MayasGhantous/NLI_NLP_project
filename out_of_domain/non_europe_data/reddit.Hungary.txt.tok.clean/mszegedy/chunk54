  originally , because he predicted tavrisprite . 
  and by `` power '' , we mean it in the loosest sense of the word . 
  edit : aw , come on , you 've got to admit it . 
  redstone mechanics make barely any sense . 
  if a torch 's purpose is to generate power , then it creates an infinite amount of it ; if its purpose is to store and supply it in the manner of a battery , then it never runs out . 
  if redstone signals are like power , then adding more of it wo n't do more work . 
  the best way to think of it is a sort of bitwise data input ... there 's no power to be found here . 
  the machines do that on their own . 
  i feel that i 'm missing something critical here . 
  the same kind of furnace that you smelt iron in ? 
  ... what ? 
  i love the crafting tables . 
  handy . 
  well , then , does n't something need to change ? 
  ( sorry ; i actually like this post ), 
  what a coincidence . 
  i have cooked salmon in a pottery kiln . 
  game design ? 
  anyway , i just thought i could let the person know that it does n't have any of the quantitative connotations of `` power '' , which is generally thought of as something you can run out of and distribute around . 
  really ? 
  examples ? 
  ( not skeptical , just curious ), 
  as soon as i can !, 
  that 's different !, 
  who does n't like a nice , gritty steak ? 
  or , depending on how the furnace actually smelts , fried steak . 
  but i do n't want any grit in my dough . 
  that 's just wrong . 
  i select the only blank item slot very often , especially when i am using equivalent exchange . 
  not that this guy is , but my point still stands . 
  sometimes keeping a blank slot is quite handy . 
  actually , it 's very likely . 
  you 've been `` lucky '' not to notice at least one of these by now . 
  smp does n't show the seed . 
  he 'd have to ask the sysadmin . 
  especially ones with * damage values * . 
  nostalgia , mostly . 
  that 's what makes * me * want to buy it , at least , and i own the original console * and * the virtual content * and * an illegal rom !, 
  ( that i hacked the shit out of , but new copies of those are literally free ), 
  i do n't get it . 
  you did n't actually have to * type in * `` atheism '' . 
  how could you have spelt it wrong ? 
  why not tuna roe caviar ? 
  or kittens ? 
  this is ironic considering your username . 
  one would figure you 'd appreciate how concise this is . 
  another jerseyan reporting here . 
  hey , anyone here irritated by the popular worldwide impression of us ? 
  ( it 's just not the same since they translated jersey shore into croatian ), 
  now that you mention it , i remember my mother showing me this exact distinction when she first became a teacher . 
  ( i 'm from new jersey as well ), 
  or not abrahamaic, 
  ( or , i could think of two other possibilities : monotheist or polytheist/atheist , christian or non-christian ), 
  it would be in the media , and then the fundies would start complaining . 
  i like your message alot !, 
  bacon chests, 
  both , but mostly the former . 
   also , that seems a bit unnatural in formation . 
  do you have any idea how much of a shit minecraft worldgen does n't give about such low-resolution details ? 
  the food , or the salute ? 
  the last line is from ~ ~ king lear ~ ~ derp , hamlet , by ~ ~ ophelia ~ ~ nope , hamlet , towards the end of the play . 
  the rest , i have n't heard up until when i read it in homestuck . 
  i think it might have been hussie that wrote it . 
  ~ ~ ... or ca n't `` god 's forge '' be alluding to that she has the forge ? ~ ~ i 'm an idiot . 
  it 's jake 's ; his dreamself died , and that 's why . 
  three posts means three times the karma , amirite ? 
  because caps lock is cruise control for cool , lol amirite , lol amirite ? 
  please post something that clarifies that you 're not a dick . 
  because , as an outside observer , to me , your post reflects * really badly * on you . 
  did you post to the wrong subreddit just now ? 
  this is an offshoot subreddit from there . 
  everyone in this subreddit saw that one first . 
  i did n't realize how much of smwc knew about homestuck . 
  anyone have a picture of the original poster ? 
  no , actually , i 'll [ provide it myself . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tr70f.jpg ) for those of you who ca n't remember , it 's from world war i. 
  edit : wait , that 's not what eight balls look like . 
  i think it 's just your monitor .
