  i 'm not sure what the trick itself was , because i changed pretty much everything about how we were doing it . 
  we used to use these short and stubby noodles ; i use only pansit kanton or jiangmen noodles for the noodles now , because it 's long , stringy , and becomes really crispy . 
  we used to use unseasoned chicken as the meat ; i use pork braised with hoisin and honey ^ and ^ five-spice ^ ^ and ^ ^ soy ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ oyster ^ ^ ^ sauce ^ ^ ^ ^ etc , and shrimp marinated in fish sauce and garlic . 
  we used to be really nervous about burning the oil ; i wait until the oil is smoking , and then start frying . 
  i am also the first to try adding curry powder during the frying . 
  it 's just all different . 
  imo the curry powder especially sells it . 
  as someone who has n't heard of it , what 's the difference between space engineers and ksp ? 
  jesus , has this kid never played a video game where there 's a thing that follows a periodic path that you have to avoid ? 
  off the top of my head , frogger , super mario , nearly every online flash platformer , portal ... 
  good puu ? 
  ^ ^ p.s. 
  ^ ^ our ^ ^ cognate : ^ ^ `` fa . '', 
  ^ ^ much ^ ^ love , ^ ^ hungary, 
  ca n't you also do this by just using ( \u0393 ( r ) / \u0393 ( r-n ) ) \\* x ^ ( r-n ) on the taylor expansion ? 
  of course , you 'd have to find the series first , which is another annoying step . 
  what a weird selection of languages . 
  it would be cool to have this for more things ( although it 's essentially a digitized etymology dictionary ; maybe some of the bigger digital ones could be converted to this format ) . 
  where does one report errors ? 
  `` lag\u00fana '' in kildin sami is listed as `` no evidence for borrowing '' , even though the russian source is listed right next to it . 
  out of all the posts in this thread i do n't understand , i do n't understand this one the most . 
  yeah , but this was from an askreddit thread . 
  you 're supposed to use the loin , but so far i 've just used whatever cut we had on hand . 
  it turned out okay , but things like chops do n't produce a lot of meat . 
  croatia is like a cheaper version of italy . 
  i drive there sometimes for vacation , because it 's the perfect balance of perks ( sea shore , tourist accommodations , best region of the balkans ) and economy ( best region of the balkans ) . 
  i 'm doing the list of oscar submissions bottom-up next , so this was actually the next one i was gon na watch . 
  my only worry is the language in it may be formal or dated , which does n't help me learn . 
  i went on pikabu.ru to get insulted . 
  i knew the insults because basic russian education and google translate . 
  it can happen . 
  and it 's not even the whole croatia , it 's just dalmatia and some inland stuff . 
  i think there 's a slovene province or two in there ? 
  your assessment went from `` interesting '' to `` stupid '' real fast , lol . 
  it 's like , `` well , i should probably be diplomatic about it , the author is clearly having an off day actually nope lol they can have my cold , unvarnished opinion . '', 
  i mean , technically this meme paints her as self-consistent . 
  she 's rich , the system benefited her , and now she says that the system benefited her . 
  do n't , everyone knows those belong to the hungarians, 
  this is actually one of the nicest vic2 europes i 've seen , apart from the belgium, 
  belgium countermeasure 05 activated : protocol `` the initial solution '', 
  - friesland ceded to the netherlands . 
  - wallonia ceded to france . 
  - brussels ceded to israel . 
  it 's hard to choose between a slav and a slav that does n't understand jokes, 
  the diary first appeared in 5.1 , i think , but excerpts and the rest of the troll ancestor stuff only appeared at the end of 5.2 . 
  you doubt they 'd know literally the only japanese cognate in that post ? 
  so , like australian `` cunt '' ? 
  never knew `` nigga '' was only for men, 
  your comment is an utter disaster . 
  60 % of the people who read it see `` with all due respect '' as a very condescending phrase and hate your comment for it , 40 % of the people who read it see `` with all due respect '' as a very polite phrase and are confused by the people who do n't , and 30 % of the people who read it hate your comment because it sounds like you 're trying to convince someone to vote differently ( which only complete assholes do , i guess ) . 
  i can see that you just wanted to know why someone would like sanders 's direction for the future and still not vote for him , but i think you should just give up and quit default subreddits . 
  hungary is just upside-down monarchist iran . 
  we should totally take a leaf out of their book and add text near the inside border , that would look rad . 
  but it 'll still be nigh-indistinguishable from mali , ghana , etc.

  does toby fox count ? 
  interestingly , i 'm on mobile and it loaded nearly instantly . 
  no idea why . 
  i mean , they 're obviously different flags , but despite that they 'd blend into each other in your head as having the stoplight/rasta colors anyway,

  you mean the area around new brunswick ? 
  new jersey has three strata , from north to south :, 
  - rich people living in the northern hills , actually good beaches , and the nj turnpike, 
  - princeton and rutgers , indian and polish immigrants , and farms, 
  - nearly philly , buncha conservatives , ghettos, 
  yeah , you and i have been double-bluffed, 
  in addition , the explanation she starts giving for the batteries sounds kind of like the same kind of reaction the mushroom uses , so maybe snake is on to something here ? 
  side note , never knew there were mushrooms with luciferase . 
  i always thought that was just a firefly thing . 
  you 've not seen the kind of game where the base game is incomplete and does n't cost much , and the dlc completes it but costs mountains of money . 
  europa universalis is kind of like that . 
  caesar overthrowing don king is probably exactly what 'll happen anyway . 
  imo yiddish is the aave of german , right down to the stigma, 
  i know several fluent speakers , so it 's probably not dead, 
  it 's especially annoying , because when it was just sanders , some people did n't mind the front page because they supported sanders , but now that it 's both sanders and trump , * everyone * is annoyed by * something * on the front page . 
  honestly , though , it 's mostly white . 
  it 's not very representative . 
  it 'd be interesting to see the article where they called it the `` most diverse '' state in america ... is it just natives ? 
  edit : ah , it 's immigrants, 
  the timestamp disagrees  :(, 
  see the third paragraph of `` extralinguistic trills '' for clarification, 
   ( my computer seems to occasionally copy a backup of the ironman savefile on its own ... very odd ), 
  i actually wrote a script to do this automatically , which really narrowed the difference on my computer between non-ironman and ironman . 
  all good fun though . 
  your conlang looks ... austronesian , specifically philippine-type , except for the ie-ish gender system ? 
  edit : no , wait , i mistook one of the translations as belonging to a different sentence . 
  now i have no clue . 
  `` bach '' as a 1s pronoun is vaguely similar to turkic pronouns , i guess ? 
  edit 2 : also :, 
  which color is_liked 1sg . dat, 
  that guy looks like a saudi , isis hates them . 
  i actually have n't seen pictures of many isis members wearing headscarves at all , their heads are usually bare with a huge beard, 
  these ads are making me rethink my purchase of a steel bubble tea straw, 
  the same reason as in every other sci-fi that bothers to explain it , they have a common ancestor or they were designed by the same people ( the real explanation usually being a combination of both ), 
  ** bwhmmmp **, 
  argh i ca n't not hear the voice of the halo reach announcer in my head when i read that book 's name, 
  modern egyptian * arabic * . 
  the latest stage of the egyptian language , coptic , is still written with vowels , ever since the greeks showed up .
