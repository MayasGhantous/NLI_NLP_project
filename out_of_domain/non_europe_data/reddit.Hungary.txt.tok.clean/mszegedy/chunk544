  i am in the same situation as you , except for never figuring out how to aim with my left eye . 
  2500 % * as much as * you did . 
  he paid 2400 % more . 
  but yes, 
  sorta like scapegoat from * worm *, 
  too bad , that seems very likely at this point . 
  but lots of plots are like that , and many of them are good , so it 's fine . 
  my main concern with all the ideological stuff is that it very much does n't mesh with the tone of the rest of the series . 
  like there 's 100 pages of funny hijinks and then all of the sudden we get the debate of the century between spender and forge and it 's hard to care about without a proper buildup . 
  i am infected , on `` sad violin '' i thought of `` jasper 's chorale '' , not the montage parody sad violin song whatever it is, 
  only 100k ? 
  one time , the hs fandom numbered over a million , now it 's less than 6 figures ? 
  hopefully , fans just have n't heard, 
  probably less than a day , seeing as it crashed * megaupload ... *, 
  wth is a `` transylvanian '' culture ? 
  that 's like making `` banat '' a culture,

  fun fact , i actually found out through / r/all , not my frontpage . 
   a look at the oldest known speakers of the language [ of sanskrit ], 
  how is this * not * misleading ? 
  close , it takes you to flushing . 
  to get to chinatown you want n/r/q, 
  yes , but the title specifically states that the mittani were the oldest known speakers of the sanskrit language . 
  even if we call the syrian sanskrit speakers mittani , if you do n't know that the mittani mostly spoke their own , unrelated language , then it sounds like sanskrit was their language . 
  copied from my other comment :, 
   ... the title specifically states that the mittani were the oldest known speakers of the sanskrit language .

   surviving descendants . 
  linguistic evolution actually follows certain predictable rules . 
  looking at the pronunciation of french , spanish , italian etc can give us some clues and constraints on how latin was probably spoken . 
  mind you though , modern romance languages share a common ancestor with classical latin and are greatly influenced by it , but are not descended from it . 
  proto-romance was some sort of precursor to vulgar latin . 
  classical latin essentially died with the roman elite , and was immortalized as church latin . 
  with this said , phonologically , proto-romance and classical latin were n't significantly different ( and i 'm no expert on how they were ; i believe the [ appendix probi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/appendix_probi ) provides a good overview , which you seemed to touch on in your post ) . 
  to my understanding the big gulf between the two is vocabulary , as is common for varying sociolects . 
  what even was slick 's motivation for that ? 
  fear of doc scratch ? 
  i doubt i 'll ever stop being a subscriber here, 
   planning vacations that last less than a menstrual cycle, 
  i hope i can stay in academia forever, 
  ( assuming stress on the first a , and a reading of the u as \u0447 ), 
  only handwritten ; when it 's next to an actual printed \u0438 , you 're far more liable to consider it a \u0447, 
  this is my biggest pet peeve as well . 
  they 've actually got a couple in later starts but they 're useless . 
  i know , that 's why we 're only buying the base game !, 
  wu , the france of chinese minors, 
  that 's usually eaten dry or with yoghurt . 
  the one picture example they have is pretty weird . 
  ( not to mention it 's not really the same as cereal ), 
  does n't it get kinda too soggy ? 
  i mean , i guess you could say the same for any cereal-like thing , but one of the best things about muesli is the crunch ... 
  even your momma thinks your mind is gone ? 
  i think because the first half of the comment essentially paraphrases the line , while still scanning, 
  it 's a european thing, 
  having lived in both the us and hungary , and having traveled around the rest of europe ( and visited many history museums , which usually say which century an item is from ) , i can definitively say yes . 
  we use roman numerals for this in hungary , and i 'm guessing the rest of german-influenced central/eastern europe as well . \\* i have also seen them used to describe centuries as far west as portugal . 
  it is definitely a widespread practice in europe , if probably not universal . 
  comparatively , i 've never seen it in the us , at least not that i remember . 
  \\* i was going to link the hungarian wikipedia as an example , which i know used them at some point in the past , but interestingly they seem to have switched to `` 1 . century '' , `` 2 . century '' , etc. 
  this is more `` regular '' , as `` 1 . 
  '' , for example , is unambiguously read as `` first '' when there 's no special context . 
  you 'll just have to take my word for it that roman numeral-numbered centuries appear in our history books and casual writings . 
  they 're 1st worlders is what they are , with all the goddamn bpa and other estrogen mimickers leaching into their food from their plastic whatevers and giving them periods at -2 years old or some shit, 
  the programmers who write those really cancerous uninstallable malware things, 
  perfect armenian, 
  this is not a hill i want to die on . 
  most times i 've seen centuries referred to in europe , it was with roman numerals . 
  every time i 've seen centuries referred to in the us , it was with arabic numerals . 
  this is my basis for calling it a `` european thing '' . 
  your mileage may vary . 
  but what did they eat with pre-chopsticks ? 
  just knives ? 
  do you stab your food and lift it into your mouth with the knife ? 
  maybe confucius had a point , that is pretty barbaric-looking . 
  i think it 's just because i 'm from hungary , where roman numerals are overwhelmingly more common . 
  see what happens when you search the word `` century '' on our largest internet forum [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=pinc%c3%a9rulti&amp;oq=pinc%c3%a9rulti&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.4759j0j4&amp;client=ms-android-att-us&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=utf-8#q=site:forum.index.hu+sz%c3%a1zad ) these people are not being pretentious , they are just doing what people in hungary do . 
  my sample size for other european countries is limited , and i extrapolated based on what i had and the assumption that hungary is not unique ( it rarely ever is ) . 
  the person we were originally arguing about said it was `` polish '' , and it 's reasonable that poland would use the same convention ( `` polak wengier dwa bratanky ... '' ) . 
  edit : mind you , while index.hu is n't * trying * to be pretentious , they 're still often pretty cancerous, 
  god fucking dammit, 
  if it were codominance , you 'd see an evenly mixed pattern . 
  this looks more like a chimera . 
  well , me too . 
  they 're 80-90 % of what we use in hungary . 
  i doubt we 're the only ones .

  britain would just test it overseas .
