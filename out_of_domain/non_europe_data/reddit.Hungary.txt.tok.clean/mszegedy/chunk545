  it is actually 2016 \u00e1prilis 10 . !, 
  not exactly ; you 're assuming $ 1 per 1000 views , which is kind of lowballing it considering that the rate is $ 18 per 1000 ad views . 
  apparently only about half of youtube viewers use adblock , so an upper limit on this is about $ 99k , which is pretty insane . 
  but adblock is n't the only reason a view can not correspond to an ad view ; unfortunately , there 's less hard data on the other ones ( like repeated viewing by the same person ) . 
  i 'd say about $ 70k is realistic . 
  wow , that 's still such a ridiculous number . 
  you 're getting downvoted because americans think you 're using . 
  as a decimal marker rather than a thousands marker , making your comment look like you mean $ 11 . 
  you should probably either fix that or educate the americans . 
  np , but did n't the extra zero seem odd to you ? 
  the internet 's not smart like a person , though , and more generally is n't enough like a person for `` smartness '' to apply to it very meaningfully . 
  it 's just a medium through which information tends to go viral , or at least tends to be filtered through many eyes . 
  you ca n't ask the internet a difficult question and get a reliable answer , like you would want from something or someone smart . 
  what you * can * expect is for an assertion made on the internet to be scrutinized by many people , few of whom can assess the assertion in a useful way . 
  some of those people may have a problem with what you said , and if they 're convincing enough to everyone else , then the problem catches on . 
  the internet 's a lot easier and at the same time a lot harder to fool than one `` smart '' person . 
  this is also where whitespacey languages like python shine . 
  you 'd have to deliberately indent the statement to get it to be part of the ` if ` , and the ` if ` will also throw an error if there 's no indented block after it . 
  the proto-germanic masculine ending makes a fashionable return ? 
  does n't it sort of naturally form one , since piles of sand are basically really flat cones ? 
  lmao the cherokee syllabary is the best . 
  one of the few known instances of someone from a pre-literate culture inventing a writing system without knowing how to write . 
  the weirdness of how letters do n't correspond to their values in other languages is really cool, 
  ey bby can sum furgiv ? 
  have you got a version without the text ? 
  it 's the navy seal copypasta , perhaps the most popular copypasta on the internet, 
  well , it does illustrate the small range of angles they 're at . 
  the pitcher always faces somewhere between south and west . 
  the sun in the batter 's eyes would be an issue in most of those stadiums . 
  wait , also , hi vanderzwan , fancy seeing you here . 
  i think so , but what 's the last time you 've needed to teach voronoi polygons to kids ? 
  pfft , they 're ruled out by our current understanding of qm , did n't you know ? 
  np , if you 're interested it has a sub : / r/navysealcopypasta, 
  also a thread on / r/circlejerkcopypasta : https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/16aho4/coll_gorilla_warfarenavy_seal_variations/, 
  why is it that every time i see a sample of scots , it 's totally different ? 
  i mean i get that it forms a dialect continuum with english , but even the fuzziest of dialect continua ( e.g. 
  arabic , singlish , german ) do n't have this issue . 
  also , the orthography 's always different . 
  italians are arabs and greeks are turks . 
  they 're the least white europeans apart from the people in the balkans !, 
  well , i 'll be damned . 
  steve ballmer is known for this kinda stuff, 
  factorials of negative integers are undefined , but factorials of every other negative number are . 
  technically though they 're not factorials but the [ gamma function ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gamma_function ) . 
  joke 's on them , i use a laser jammer . 
  fascinating . 
  thank you for doing all this documentation ; i 've tried to learn about scots on the internet in the past and failed . 
  your material is better than anything i 've come across . 
  ( work on your voice acting skills , though . 
  i was just comically insulting them , it 's not really meant to be taken seriously . 
  that said , take a look at some [ haplogroup-based genetic anthropological data ] ( http://www.eupedia.com/europe/origins_haplogroups_europe.shtml ) . 
  modern greeks and turks mostly descend from the same people ( as evidenced by similar genetic breakdowns ) , and there 's a lot of semitic ancestry in southern italy ( as evidenced by the high portion of the t haplogroup there ) . 
  well , i meant tuscans in particular , but it was also a joke . 
  palau 's flag is actually the moon , is n't it ? 
  not the sun ? 
  this would be more entertaining if ~ ~ algeria ~ ~ libya still had their all-green flag, 
  oops yeah thx, 
  but they 're not mothballed , and op is not at war , so presumably op keeps them active perpetually ( or has just finished a war ) . 
  yeah , but now it 's not, 
   rainier ... `` rayneer '', 
  but then how do you pronounce the other one ? 
  homophonous in my dialect, 
  but now would have been the time to do it . 
  i 'll reserve judgement until act 7 , but i doubt the opportunity to do it as naturally will arise again . 
  edit : huh , it happened . 
  polish and russian are relatively easy to tell apart , for a number of reasons ( e.g. 
  palatalized dental stops became alveolo-palatal affricates , and velar l became / w / in polish ; also , russian contains retroflex sibilants but not affricates , while polish contains both ) . 
  now , when you have to decide between serbian and croatian , that 's when you give up . 
  it 's indo-european !, 
  how could you not understand it ? 
  eh , it closely resembles noun classes in other noun class-heavy languages , e.g. 
  most niger-congo languages . 
  it 's very passable . 
  whoa . 
  many thoughts about this , at once . 
  - homestuck 's finally an anime . 
  this is really great art . 
  - this was not in the top 10 songs i would have predicted to be the song in the ending flash . 
  it works very well . 
  - can town has ascended , like many other things in homestuck . 
  - the resolution with lord english , caliborn , and vriska is unclear . 
  so lord english just died ? 
  due to ... some sort of shockwave induced by a house ? 
  where did vriska end up ? 
  why do we care about caliborn in this flash , since he 's a past version of another character in the flash ? 
  - did pm and wv repopulate a whole planet by themselves ? 
  i guess that 's not an issue for carapacians ? 
  - what about everyone 's character arcs ? 
  - thanks to * interstellar * , people can now draw black holes decently . 
  if it is , it seems to be resistant to googling . 
  i mean i searched for ` `` i waited * years for this ? '', 
  avatar the last airbender ` , and that turned up nothing relevant . 
  i 'd go and view the episodes to look it up , but i need sleep now . 
  i 'm personally about 2/3 fine with this aspect of the ending . 
  it would have been better if the ending were interesting plotwise , but then again there are limited options for what plotwise interesting things to do in it :, 
  - ** weird plot shit : ** homestuck 's plot is complicated enough as it is , although '' [ s ] cascade . '', 
  handled the tying up of various loose ends in a not-quite-expected way pretty well . 
  the first and most obvious choice for making act 7 interesting . 
  - ** character arc resolution : ** in a linear flash ? 
  there 's not much you can develop about a character in a flash , even a long one ; many flashes have done * some * character development , with some of the best examples being '' [ s ] make her pay . '',
