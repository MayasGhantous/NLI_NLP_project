  once upon a time , reddit upvoted literal dog shit to the front page . 
  this looks pretty great !, 
  what makes it much more durable than a thinkpad , though ? 
  but . 
  how durable is it ? 
  that 's most of the point of wanting a `` rugged laptop '' . 
  otherwise i 'd just be on the market for any `` gaming laptop '' . 
  not that it does n't look like a good gaming laptop . 
  how would you do that ? 
  visibility is crap in lakes . 
  ^ ( ( interestingly , the stiller the water in a place is , the finer particles of mud/sand/whatever you will find there , more or less because a stronger current would carry away anything smaller . 
  hence , lakes are muddy , while beaches are just sandy . 
  i mean , there 's models that specifically have pci/pcie slots in them and stuff like that . 
  it 's just that they 're really heavy . 
  i 'd like to find a middle ground . 
  ** tl ; dr : need a small , durable , nice-looking usb for a usb necklace . 
  suggestions ? 
  i 'm a grad student whose work mostly involves running back and forth between a few computers and doing work on them . 
  i 've recently taken to wearing a lanyard with a bunch of keys and a flashlight at the end . 
  i 've slowly come to realize , however , that it looks pretty dumb , and is noisy to boot . 
  so , i have decided to replace it with something similarly useful , but with much more potential for elegance : a high-capacity usb drive . 
  the idea behind the usb drive is that it 'll contain an install of knoppix or arch or something , on which i 'll do most of my work , rather than signing in to the university 's computers ( which are n't terrible to use by any means , but i prefer my `` home turf '' ) . 
  i 'd also like to put all the partitions from my rescue drive on it ( several install and recovery disks and an install of backbox ) and bind it all together with a syslinux chainloader . \\*, 
  this means that it needs to be high-capacity ( \u2265 64 gb ) , preferably high transfer rate as well , and should be able to be removed from my neck easily . 
  whether i 'll accomplish the latter with a special chain or a special usb remains to be determined , but it 's a matter of consideration either way . 
  what 's really important , though , is that it be stylish , and fairly durable . 
  i run from place to place a lot and live in a fairly humid climate , so a degree of not-shaking-apartness and waterproofing is a must . 
  and , well , i want it to look natural , like a genuine piece of jewelry , not just a random tool hanging from my neck . 
  like , i 'd just get a [ kingston datatraveller , ] ( http://www.amazon.com/kingston-digital-datatraveler-dtse9g2-64gb/dp/b00sol9z1m ) but it looks pretty dorky , and if i put a sticker on it , it would only look slightly less dorky . 
  maybe there 's something i can laser-etch ? 
  help me out here . 
  ^ ( * the technical details are n't too relevant , but i 'm excited about them , so here they are . ), 
  edit : currently looking at the [ lacie xtremkey . 
  ] ( http://www.amazon.com/lacie-xtremkey-usb-3-0-128gb/dp/b00h3beth4/ ) anybody know whether it 's any good ? 
  and perhaps how to get it laser engraved or otherwise designed ? 
  huh , did n't realize they 're a real country now, 
  not ryukyu , japan gets a mission to conquer them . 
  probably not a north american tribe ; the colonizers typically end up conquering na . 
  i 've been staying away from it because i assumed it would be hilariously incompatible with most wms compared to x. 
  ( also , i am already embroiled in x to a ridiculous degree . 
  like , i have custom scripts that inject stuff into the x event stream . ), 
  how usable is wayland actually ? 
  i do n't think sollux and kanaya have ever had a conversation , had they ? 
  are you thinking of sollux and karkat ? 
  huh , i only searched act 5 . 
  did n't realize they had one in act 4 . 
  in my junior year , every single class of mine was at the same lecture hall with the same people doing the same degree program as me . 
  i lived about 50 meters from this lecture hall . 
  it was like attending a very small boarding high school . 
  `` homestuck has literal trolls guise lol '' .

  [ that 's in tunisia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tataouine ), 
  also i 'm totally posting this to / r/copypasta, 
  i 'm not your pal , buddy . 
  tolja . 
  now that i 'm thinking about it , i probably should have censored your username . 
  interesting , * worm * took me 1-2 weeks to read . 
  sadly i do n't have a comparable hs reading time since i 've been following it more or less since the beginning , but my rereads have been about that long , and i assume a first reading would have gone slower . 
  are you thinking of `` hebbit kerrih '' ? 
  `` n '' does n't count as its own syllable afaik, 
  ah , freaken mora-timed languages . 
  bionicle/other technic set community ? 
  found it : https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/2j625c/blowese_the_language_of_well/, 
  two , then, 
  yeah , if you have n't figured it out yet , i do n't give a fuck about super-pacs . 
  edit : jokes :(, 
  thing is , every one of those tagalog speakers also speaks english, 
  what about it is scary ? 
  affix fusion is scary because it obscures the individual elements , but there 's almost none of that in tagalog . 
  nearly every affix is fully agglutinative . 
  the only ones i can think of that are n't are man - and pan - , which modify * one consonant * in the subsequent root ( e.g. 
  ymmv but tagalog affixes are very straightforward . 
   tacos, 
   spanish, 
  you are walking a thin line , hombre, 
  it would be an okay fit for the caucasus if there were n't so many vowels, 
  looks like its long form is long / \u00e6 / . 
  this happens ; in hungarian , `` e '' is / \u025b / , while '' \u00e9 '' is long / e / . 
  similar thing for `` a '' vs '' \u00e1 '' ( ca n't be bothered to type out the ipa rn , but it 's something like the [ open back vowel ] vs the [ open mid vowel ] ), 
  how does he breathe, 
  actually it 's impossible to nest hats deeper than 6 levels . 
  the hydraulic press guy tried it but the hats just broke, 
  how does one bin in this situation ? 
  it 's happened to me more times than i can count, 
  there 's no voiced fricatives or stops , period, 
  it actually looks like a very uralic phonology , if only there were n't labialized or aspirated consonants . 
  but anything can happen, 
  hah , i use that recipe !, 
  the cutting instructions for it are pretty weird though, 
  this is my guess as well, 
  you absolute madman, 
  ooh , which ones ? 
  phonemic vowel length is pan-uralic , but counterparts with different vowel qualities are distinctly hungarian . 
  / \u00e6 / was in proto-uralic but now it 's generally associated with the finnic family . 
  lack of voicing distinction is finnic , too ( or proto-uralic ) . 
  darn , when we moved to the us we found jack shit , since we lived in the suburbs . 
  to this day i never hunt mushrooms west of the danube . 
  i guess , but it 's not very normal . 
  also that 's a pretty weird vowel and consonant count for chechen , i 'd analyse the pharyngealization at least as consonant clusters rather than actual separate consonants,
