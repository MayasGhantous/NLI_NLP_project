  holy crap , maggi , did n't realize it existed outside of hungary, 
  edit : looking at wikipedia , it seems to be a thing across central europe , southeast asia , central america , and west africa, 
  scots is a completely different language from english and very mutually unintelligible with it . 
  you 're thinking of scottish english . 
  my favorite comparative text , the navy seal copypasta , is reproduced [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/navysealcopypasta/comments/4buwzw/copy_pasta_in_the_endangered_scots_language/ ) in a scots instructor 's somewhat divergent native dialect . 
  listen to the recording , it 's really fun ( and completely mutually unintelligible except for the random `` an ` ats jus ' ma hans !, 
  hmm , in hungarian , kinship is generally inalienable , although it does n't come up very much . 
  it 's pretty fun to compare alienable vs inalienable possession across languages that make the distinction . 
  is it just me or is that regex in the title-text invalid ? 
  there 's a special close paren with no corresponding open paren . 
  i guess there 's no reason it * should * be valid ; lord knows it takes me multiple attempts to get a regex right . 
  but it 's still odd . 
  some of them even change the dialogue depending on certain factors . 
  if you spare sans and die , for example , next run he makes a comment about how it seems you did n't care enough not to come back . 
  asgore also is the appropriate amount of horrified depending on how much you 've died to him already . 
  thank you . 
  does it physically fit , though ? 
  and are any of the important keys not functional ? 
  ( say , any of the membraned keys ), 
   voiced spirants, 
   finnish, 
  edit : or for that matter , voiced pretty much anything . 
  list of voiced things in finnish : vowels , approximants , / r / , / d / , loanword phonemes . 
  that 's all folks, 
  it 's absurdly relevant to most fiction, 
  huh , i first heard about this in greenlandic . 
  makes it inconvenient for linguists for sure . 
  it 's one of the things that makes me trust fortescue 's * language relations across the bering strait * more than i otherwise would . 
  birds on a cob ? 
  did n't you die ? 
  i am stupid , where is the texas carbon ? 
  as someone who does n't watch this sport , what is going on here ? 
  apples , oranges , etc, 
  it 's a stattracker !, 
  the forums were targeted by syrian hackers iirc, 
  thanks , this is great !, 
  you 're a real last word kinda guy , huh ? 
  it does n't come in desktop background sizes :(, 
  wait the original and cog dis used sound hacks ? 
  wow , i had no idea we had that technology available to us at the time . 
  although i suppose the smw hacking community figured out sound hacking a couple years before 2011 ... 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's just searching the path tree in parallel , yeah, 
  the diagram does , for sure , but the fusili has undetermined bases/turn, 
  interesting , i find myself more often telling people how to spell , not pronounce my name . 
  right ? 
  just * try * to figure out where germany 's borders are , or who owns the low countries , or where china 's western and southern borders are . 
  it 's freakin ' impossible . 
  hell , it 's hard to think of countries where this * is n't * true . 
  the us ? 
  japan ? 
  sound hacking in general is n't new , but it took until ~ 2008 to develop addmusic for smw , the oldest snes game in existence , and even then it was a rickety piece of crap for a while . 
  in particular , adding custom samples , as would be required to change the original soundfont , barely worked until sometime after homestuck started . 
  snes sound hacking is pretty hard and i wonder how the earthbound hackers fared with it . 
  the strawberry squid !, 
  ever since the pictures first came out , i 've wanted to make a graphic like [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f4krnbs.jpg ) for it . 
  it really does like a strawberry with squid parts attached , does n't it ? 
  it 's a very common expression in english but it never fails to sound a little weird to me, 
  neither ? 
  ( irl the lego brick of course , as anyone who 's run over one will be able to tell you ), 
  but who picks those ? 
  but in this case , would n't * not * getting married be playing it safe ? 
  unironically though this sub really is pretty toxic in the community sense . 
  i rarely see two comments or submissions that agree with each other . 
  it goes like this :, 
  `` hi i have a problem with oblidisk precession '', 
  `` you did n't calibrate the gyroscopes and i am absolutely sure of this '', 
  `` other guy is an idiot , you need a new oblidisk motor and i am absolutely sure of this '', 
  `` everyone itt is a moron and i wo n't say why '', 
  i think it happens to most q&a communities eventually . 
  just look at stackoverflow . 
  it 's a cow l'bau, 
  source : lived in southern france , there is an overpopulation problem with them there . 
  every spring equinox there is a festival held where they are cut down for their meat , which is subsequently sent to bavaria and austria to make wei\u00dfwurst, 
  natatakot ako na too small for even that . 
  must go deeper , kumuha ng nmr machine upang perform crystal spectroscopy . 
  ( actually proteasomes do look kinda like dicks , but then again so does anything vaguely elongated ), 
  i mean i was just using it as a silly example ; you can find real examples in every single thread . 
  it 's pretty bad . 
  not literally every thread , but tell me you do n't see a question with three wildly conflicting answers every day in this sub . 
  ah , many thanks , makes sense . 
  i 'll report back on whether it fixed other applications as well . 
  edit : fixed okular but not much else . 
  problem appears to be qt3 , but ` qtconfig-qt3 ` does n't have a gtk + option for the appearance . 
  thank you very much , i 'll work that part out on my own . 
  oh nothing , i just have it installed alongside 4 because something required it . 
  so it 's not per-application ? 
  every qt application on my computer will use the latest version of qt i have installed ? 
  it 's because imgur truncates gifs . 
  never upload to imgur if you want a complete gif , people . 
  it 's a meme , in the sense of an idea that spreads . 
  def not an image macro though, 
  a comic where things are n't * sufficiently * exaggerated . 
  a rare breed !, 
  / r/absolutelynotme _ irl, 
  break it open over yourself it will give you superpowers, 
  it 's almost certainly ridiculously sterile on the inside, 
  that 's a snowclone , a kind of meme, 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/blackpeopletwitter/comments/4gnw7u/when_the_white_kid_spares_your_life/d2jf71h ), 
  but whose father makes pb & j sandwiches for lunch ? 
  i demand realism !,
