  hilariously `` coach '' is a loan of the hungarian word `` kocsi '' , pronounced `` coachy '' . 
  so you 've accidentally brought back an earlier form !, 
  that is also from the hungarian . 
  it is one of the very few words we have managed to loan to other languages . 
  it means `` from kocs '' . 
  [ kocs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kocs ) is the village where steel-spring suspension carriages were first invented . 
  planeshift is about as old as 9/11, 
  probably denatured to shit by the high temperatures required for the formation of the rock . 
  you want ice for those , not stone, 
  that 's the great pacific garbage patch . 
  large , floating piles of garbage are always round because there is equal force pushing them together on every side . 
  deja vu , i swear i saw this at the top of an askreddit thread once before . 
  and i remember thinking then too , `` how could someone dislike tuna ? '', 
  the original did n't have it either, 
  it 's in the html tag . 
  it 's literally the html attribute called the `` title '' . 
  mousing over the comic , or failing to load it , or inspect element-ing it will all reveal the comic 's title . 
  it is also in the name of the comic 's file . 
  it was n't supposed to be an all - / r/wellthatsucks album ; it 's just some dude 's album of images he like he posted to imgur . 
  there is / r/ignorantimgur , now meet / r/ignorantreddit, 
  exactly . 
  i ca n't concentrate enough to keep talking if i 'm focused on looking at their face , either . 
  this is sacha baron cohen 's fault, 
  it 's harder for english speakers because english 's phonology is pretty unusual , and there 's no geographically close languages that share its unusual characteristics . 
  as a hungarian speaker , i can hear the local slovaks speak and get an impression of what hungarian would sound like to a foreigner , because while slovak and hungarian are completely unrelated languages , areal sound changes have conspired to make their phonologies similar over time . 
  ( the phonologies still are n't exactly the same though . 
  they 're missing two vowels compared to us , and pronounce < a  differently unless you 're a pal\u00f3c . 
  they also have consonants next to each other more often than hungarian does , etc. . . ), 
  makes me wonder where the hell you 'd find a language phonologically similar to english . 
  different regions have different shticks and none of them sound like they 'd produce something with a bazillion diphthongs , voicing distinction , ( non-phonemic ) aspiration , and freaken ' * rhotic vowels * . 
  what the hell , english ? 
  maybe ... maybe south-eastern india ? 
  they have rhotic vowels , and sometimes aspiration ... 
  yeah , it is perhaps the most strongly protected form of protected speech . 
  thing is , it does look like a script . 
  a truly disguised script needs to be not linear . 
  i 'll have to disagree with you on that last one . 
  jk are n't too bad because they 're right next to each other ( although they force you to use your left hand instead ) , but hl are placed really inconveniently . 
  yes , but without the rhyming, 
  which is the point of the piece . 
  everyone consuming at the rate that first world countries do would be incredibly unsustainable . 
  the first-worlders are getting more than their fair share , so to speak . 
  nah they 're fine . 
  pretty much every writing system has two glyphs that are at least as close as these two . 
  this article just looks like it 's talking about gays being obnoxious to bi and trans people , claiming that they 're just gay . 
  this happens a lot , and it sucks . 
  edit : oh wait it 's everyday feminism . 
  fuck those people with a rusty dildo . 
  thistle tea or how ? 
  is n't c the * pointer * to an array ? 
  or since an array of chars is informally known as a string , that ? 
  i guess the question needs a little context . 
  why would i claim that ` c * = = c ` ? 
  i 'm trying to understand the semantics of the question . 
  i guess there is nothing else to be called the array but ` c ` , but come on , really , that is such an obtuse way of interpreting it . 
  imo the more sensible definition is : ` c ` is the pointer to the beginning of the array . 
  ` c [ 0 ] ` through ` c [ n ] ` constitute the array . 
  ` char no [ 2 ] = `` no '' ; ` does n't work , but ` char no [ ] = `` no '' ; ` does . 
  how do you explain char arrays not being called `` strings '' when there is the `` cstring '' library that deals with them ? 
  [ nope .

  seriously , every armenian inscription looks like `` ulquhpmu nlhm numlhq nulplmqhnulh '' . 
  marinade is n't for just getting into the meat , it is also for performing certain chemical reactions on it ( generally ones that break down the collagen and soften the meat ) . 
  the films feature some of the best of philip glass . 
  it 's a joke, 
  some things are original enough to be interesting . 
  this is n't . 
  silesia is what you get if you take bohemia , real poland , and some nazis and put them in a blender . 
  no , wait , you just get blood . 
  i 'm not sure then . 
  ohmagawd , really cool and kind of disgusting-looking . 
  the nucleus and part of the megakaryocyte survive , right ? 
  edit : wikipedia to the rescue :, 
   after budding off platelets , what remains is mainly the cell nucleus . 
  this crosses the bone marrow barrier to the blood and is consumed in the lung by alveolar macrophages . 
  the consonantal part certainly . 
  i make a throwaway reference to it in the description . 
  this is not accidental . 
  i 'm currently learning tagalog . 
  did n't think anyone would actually pull tagalog out of it though . 
  strange minds think alike ? 
  if i were proficient at it , believe me ... 
  dammit , i never got tagalog on that website . 
  kill me ? 
  edit : for the sample sentence , it says `` czech or english '' . 
  well , how about you go str\u010d prst skrz krk ... 
  and on reddit it 's usually `` ugh , those imgur people are using our website ! '' . 
  why ca n't we all just get along ? 
  used to be , a few centuries ago . 
  comes from `` god 's wounds '' , so it 's pronounced `` zoonds '' . 
  twinkies are n't made anymore, 
  it 's fine , my reference grammar book and lurking on / r/philippines do most of the legwork . 
  it basically asks which letters are present , and , secondarily , in what combination . 
  it defaults to tagalog most of the time , because almost all texts contain all of the letters that are usually present in tagalog ( which has a small phonology ) . 
  i definitely found it wtf . 
  have you ever seen that thing bite someone 's hand off ? 
  ca n't believe someone would fuck with a moray like that . 
  i can understand and regurgitate most of the stuff in / r/philippines at this point . 
  of course though you do n't need a tagalog education to understand `` dutertard '', 
  sunglasses ?
