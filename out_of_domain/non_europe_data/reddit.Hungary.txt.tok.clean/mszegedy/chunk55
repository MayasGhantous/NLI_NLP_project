  ( ftfy ), 
  sorry ( no , really ) ; i thought you had the utmost well-meaning in your first post . 
  i just did n't think it would be fair if people thought that you were a dick because of poor wording and/or lack of context . 
  whatever is worth posting is worth verifying . 
  that 's because here you can express things nonverbally but anonymously , with an upvote . 
  but i ca n't seem to find a dealer !, 
  edit : are these downvotes suggesting that i should make it in my basement ? 
  same . 
  why do they stand still in the video ? 
  hey guys !, 
  this person believes in a higher reality !, 
  downvote him if you 're religious !, 
  unless it 's competitive . 
  seriously , why * did * you ? 
  i would love to hear the details of his story as well . 
  thank you so much . 
  i will use this constantly . 
  some people advocate the former as well , and some people forget the latter . 
  read the username , people . 
  why `` have studied science '' ? 
  this comes up most often in the field of literature . 
  but the rest is exact and good , so upvoted !, 
  ( although i did n't know that there were people who needed this explained . ), 
  all morals are man-made . 
  oh my god , that would be amazing . 
  ahh . 
  i thought you meant that it is people who study science that would most commonly be familiar with that term . 
  okay !, 
  mind if i link it there ? 
  the rest translate into `` about '' , such as * de situ et origine syracusarum * , where the preposition `` de '' can mean `` down from '' or `` about '' . 
  writing a story backwards is really hard . 
  ^ ^ ^ \\* tucks ^ ^ ^ away ^ ^ ^ idea ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ future ^ ^ ^ narrative *, 
  lol , noise, 
  *** lawn = = mown ***, 
  ** so brave **, 
  ** my username * is n't * relevant but i 'll mention it anyways **, 
  i watched that * over 9,000 * times . 
  ** did not disappoint **, 
  your incorrect spelling of `` phial '' makes your comment invalid , fuckin ` murricans . 
  get it right , britfag !, 
  ^ ^ \\ ( le ^ ^ hungarian ), 
  i am prepared for downvotes , but i think most of you will find it to be truthful . 
  you stand out because of the '' [ +52 ] '' next to your name . 
  jesus , i did n't even know you guys browsed this place . 
  hi , what 's up ? 
  same , slacking on a history paper that actually includes a homestuck reference : `` tim\u00e6us wanted to write about history . 
  all history . 
  some might say his taste in history was eclectic , but in truth it was nothing short of totally indiscriminate . '', 
  doubt it ; hussie said tuesday at the earliest . 
  til . 
  latest news update at [mspaintadventures.com ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com ) . 
  op is * literally * a dick . 
  if this is survival , then i 'm mightily impressed . 
  care to show your house ? 
  alt-21 on numpad + k ( it works anywhere * but * minecraft ), 
  lol fig fail, 
  ... i finally understand that comic , after about three years . 
  ... why did you make google think i searched that ? 
  breaking character for a moment , hungarian time is actually yyyy/mm/dd . 
  her dreamself did the lifey thing and is n't dead anymore . 
  more like \u05d0n lol amirite, 
  suddenly , i do n't think i do . 
  worrying comes from when you * do n't know * whether you can solve your problem . 
  [ memeticized !, 
  actually , i forgot to mention that the entire idea for the history paper is based on homestuck . 
  i know timaeustestified is actually about plato 's tim\u00e6us , but that 's where th paper comes from nevertheless . 
  fuck you , you just made me watch all of the weather man . 
  gaaaaah . 
  do n't you mean it the other way around ? 
  ~ ~ exactly . 
  read it * one * more time ... ~ ~ oh, 
  i thought you meant work with redstone !, 
  everything suddenly makes sense . 
  ... you sound like you 're still , ahem , `` ic '' . 
  you live in mississippi ? 
  you need a pickaxe for that . 
  yes . 
  i am not kidding . 
  yes . 
  although , now that fire 's nerfed , maybe not as much as it could be . 
  she could have stopped to listen for * one fucking minute * . 
  it 's not a question of what she was listening to ; could have been mahler for all we know . 
  it 's * why * . 
  this is gold !, 
  i 'd also prefer some bad * composition * , though , rather that performance ( thank you for reminding me that word exists suddenly ; `` performance '' , that is ) . 
  ahahah , i embarked on an aquifer and did well for a couple of years before dying of thirst . 
  ( i 'm am idiot . ), 
  i 'm just glad that i can replace those damn pump stacks . 
  [ the wiki has an entire index of these . 
  ] ( http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/df2012:stupid_dwarf_trick ) ( i actually do the dpu trick quite early , though , within a year or two . ), 
  although i do like the suggestion of `` build something pointlessly large and fill it with magma '' . 
  no , the dwarven processing unit , or dwarven ai . 
  have a guy locked in a box forever that contains all the levers that control your fortress . 
  either have him be a vampire or dump food down to him . 
  response time on fortress lockdown commands become amazing . 
  doted . 
   christian dubstep, 
  i 'd love to hear this . 
  you did n't hear this from me , but there may actually be homestuck charcter mods around . 
  observe how he is worshipped on even the furthest worlds !,
