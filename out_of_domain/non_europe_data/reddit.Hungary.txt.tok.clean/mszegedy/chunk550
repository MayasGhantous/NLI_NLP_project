  meme tally in this reply thread as of my comment :, 
  - sokka cactus juice scene ( * avatar : the last airbender * ), 
  - squanchy ( * rick & morty * ), 
  - brawndo , the thirst mutilator ( * idiocracy * and youtube ), 
  probably my pork/shrimp stir fry . 
  it is fantastic and far better than anything else i can cook , and is n't too heavy either . 
  i 'd have to shop for ingredients beforehand though . 
  i think it might just literally go through the alphabet of every language , and see which one has the highest percentage of letters that are in the text . 
  if that 's the case , then it 's impressively simple , even if it 's prone to this pitfall . 
  to be fair , about 30-40 % of that could pass for tagalog if you knew only its phonology and orthography , and none of its vocabulary . 
  hell , `` laksit '' is probably a word in tagalog , and `` ba '' definitely is . 
  you need to get in the visayan timewarp to understand them, 
  what is it lol, 
  the problem with it is that the potential energy function of any protein is horrendously jagged and irregular at every level . 
  it 's hard to pull anything mathematically interesting out of them . 
  but was n't `` nazi '' also among the list of keywords ? 
  also , people like to say `` hitler mods '' a lot, 
  qm is mostly infeasible on the scale of proteins , but it does n't have huge relevance . 
  proteins behave mostly newtonianly ( as far as we know ) . 
  it 's just that their motion is so complex that it 's hard to model . 
  thermal motion is a bitch . 
  i mean , he did get things done . 
  he was better at his job than most . 
  the same might not hold true for hillary , of course . 
  fraser island !, 
  driving there as a tourist for two weeks was not fun . 
  well , it was a little fun . 
  camping was a lot more so , though . 
  i thought it was the panama canal, 
  and is ... is that ... palawan ? 
  no , it ca n't be , nobody remembers palawan on maps . 
  code is always spaghetti . 
  unless it is less than 300 lines or comes from nasa . 
  then it has a chance . 
  huh , there is [ a similar-looking limestone cave ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aggtelek_national_park ) where i lived in hungary . 
  it was the first national park in the country . 
  it is somewhat more done up and touristy than lumiang cave . 
  there are paths and railings . 
  at one of the exits , they installed a light-show ; unnecessary yata . 
  i will be sure to visit these caves if i 'm in the area . 
  to be fair the scientific method in its modern form was invented by kevin bacon, 
  k og k ?

  expected relativity joke, 
  got race joke, 
  i wonder if any of those employees were hospitalized for unstoppaple fits of laughter, 
  efficiency as a drive is a poor term here ; whether it 's isp or twr should be specified . 
  watch me go kill someone with an ion drive ... by slugging them in the head with it ... 
  feel free to construct your own version of it . 
  i 'm generally not too keen on vocabulary generation for languages without etymologies ( since it just boils down to putting phonemes in phonotactically correct combinations ) . 
  how does one convert to a pagan religion , other than by bankrupting themselves as an opm ? 
  well , that is literally the technical vocabulary used to refer to the difference between them . 
  is it inspired by armenian ? 
  i spy several letters and a couple punctuation marks in common between the two, 
  huh , that used to not work . 
  i 'll be sure to try it out . 
  there is also significantly more than one country studying german . 
  edit : oh , either i misread it or that 's corrected now, 
  what 's this from ? 
  that 's a pretty weird-looking weasel, 
  ape ( it 's got no tail ), 
  [ ] ( / mspareader ), 
  what 's the little fuchsia blob near syria ? 
  germany has an army ? 
  are you kidding ? 
  this person talks like a native speaker .

  [ top kek ] ( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130824204929/lost-episode-creepypasta/images/8/84/fb,6684,72,eti-topkek-meyveli-40gr-24-lu-koli-biskuvi-kraker-urunleri-eti.jpg ), 
  [ you can do ] ( http://sciencenotes.org/homemade-black-snake-fireworks/ ) something similar using sugar , baking soda , and something that burns . 
  you mean marketing ? 
  maybe ? 
  the baking soda version of the reaction works because the bicarbonate decomposes into hot co2 . 
  hcl would n't do that , but maybe there 's another way . 
  the sugar needs to turn into ash first , so the assembly would fall into the fire before getting snakey . 
  i would n't even get to the last question , because i 'd be so careful about the other ones, 
  i wonder if any of his works actually get bingo on this card, 
  david benatar ? 
  have you * seen * italian administration ? 
  it has absolutely no work put into it, 
  whose vomit is bright , neon orange ? 
  is he throwing up because he ate too many magic shrooms ? 
  or did he down too much paint ? 
  but there 's no punchline, 
  there does n't have to be a punchline , but punchlines usually make things better . 
  i am a dedicated fan of smbc but this is one of my problems with it , that it seemingly unintentionally wavers between having a funny punchline that 's a natural part of a comic ( [ ex ] ( http://smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=2597 ) ) , an ad-hoc punchline just thrown in there that does n't really fit a high-concept or otherwise philosophical comic ( [ ex ] ( http://smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=2596 ) ) , and no punchline at all ( [ ex ] ( http://smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=2603 ) ) . 
  you never know what to expect , even if it 's a philosophical comic . 
  magic shrooms are n't really what i was looking for . 
  what i meant were the very orange edible mushrooms i 've encountered sometimes mushroom picking . 
  eh , as a berkeley resident , sf is * okay *, 
  ( `` thou hadst to take '' , but since when has faking early modern english authentically ever been important in this sub ? 
  it 's not even the right time period , so imo we do n't need to bother ), 
  pseudo-early modern english . 
  old english is extremely mutually unintelligible with modern english . 
  a large part of it is the fault of the damned french . 
  there is n't really enough time left for that anyway , afaik, 
  there 's a pixel for each foot . 
  how did you figure out that it 's crocs ? 
   annoying, 
  hah , you listed two that are n't native to europe !,
