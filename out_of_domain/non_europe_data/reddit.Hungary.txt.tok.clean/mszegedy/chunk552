  am make research of philippines . 
  i 've had cygwin for at least a decade , but it 's a pain to use . 
  the terminal has so many problems compared to the linux ones ( e.g. 
  a complete inability to handle wrapping properly ) . 
  having to `` reinstall '' it whenever i want to add stuff is n't a fun quirk either . 
  what does my workflow look with git for windows ? 
  i just installed it , but it looks like i 'll have to either use the command prompt ( which does n't mesh with cygwin ) or do stuff with the mouse ( which is typically slow and terrible ) . 
  heaven help you for making a race joke targeting 99 % of reddit, 
  fuck , my grandmother lived in the hungarian midwest and this * still * is appropriate, 
  hmm , this might be a problem with whatever device ( s ) the sound goes through , like your tv . 
  i watched it on a really old tv incapable of doing any mixing , and the sound was just fine . 
  that sounds great , but i 'd need to become a windows insider to get it for now . 
  i 'll wait until the anniversary update comes out . 
  i 'm desperately trying to figure out if you 're serious , but at the bottom of my heart , i already know the cold truth . 
  i just do n't want to admit it . 
  so , you 're suggesting i do everything in cygwin ? 
  cygwin is kind of annoying but i guess it can work . 
  the main issue is that if a `` windows version '' of a compiler , interpreter , or library is offered , then there does n't seem to be a guarantee that it 'll work in cygwin . 
  if i install , say , [ pywin32 ] ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/ ) , then should i expect it to `` just work '' in cygwin or will it only work in the command prompt ? 
  i mean , i can just find that out experimentally , but i do n't want to have to do that every time i want to install something , and what if it * does n't * work ? 
  linux has a centralized python install and a centralized python library folder . 
  this is true for every language i 'd ever want to work with . 
  cygwin introduces a sort of duality that makes it uncertain what you 'll get when you install stuff . 
  also cognate to `` video '', 
  yeah , i guess command prompt will do , until the `` linux subsystem '' that 's supposed to become a thing becomes a reasonable alternative . 
  thanks !, 
   but one problem of cygwin carries over to msys2 since the posix api is implemented on top of win32 : bad i/o performance . 
  very noticeable when scrolling vim buffers . 
  but otherwise this looks great and i 'll definitely try it . 
  thanks !, 
  nope , it 's still going strong . 
  if anything it 's massively more popular because of the bible, 
  are they friends or ... ? 
  huh . 
  it could be music for some video game . 
  reminds me of dkc 's music, 
  funnily enough that was an imgur post first , and was later crossposted to reddit . 
  still pretty legendary though, 
   samoyedic languages, 
  it 's not a primary language family . 
  there are people who have tried to classify it as altaic rather than uralic ? 
  admittedly , the samoyeds as a whole are n't very ethnically uralic , and nganasan in particular demonstrates some sort of obscure substrate , but the languages themselves not being uralic ? 
  not so much recorded , as having small amounts of vocabulary reconstructed from place names . 
  it 's kind of weird how little data we have on them considering that they went extinct relatively recently in the late 1st millennium . 
  i 'd like to interject for a moment, 
  [ this ] ( http://www.usu.edu/westcent/microstructure_food/cheese.htm ) website gives a very detailed description of how cheeses are structured , but the tl ; dr version is :, 
  - milk contains many largeish proteins , called casein , enveloped by fat . 
  casein is round and blobby , because calcium ions hold the casein molecules together at the center . 
  casein can only be enveloped by fat so long as it 's round and blobby . 
  the casein blobs can only be suspended in the milk so long as they 're enveloped by fat . 
  - rennet and acid are added to the milk . 
  rennet cleaves the casein in half . 
  the acid changes the shape of the casein-halves so that they spring open and ruin the fat envelope . 
  the casein-halves , no longer kept separate by the fat , stick together into a gel with the fat , rennet , and other contents of the milk trapped in it . 
  this is cheese curd . 
  [ here ] ( http://image.slidesharecdn.com/cheeseproduction-140729003318-phpapp02/95/cheese-production-24-638.jpg?cb=1406594065 ) is a diagram . 
  - at this point , you can do whatever you want to the cheese curd to turn it into the cheese you like . 
  it can be baked or dried , strained , kneaded , washed or soaked , ripened by bacteria , etc. 
  take your pick . 
  where cream cheese comes into this is that you just add acid to very fatty milk ( cream , it 's in the name ) and leave it at that , rather than adding rennet as well . 
  this destabilizes the casein enough that the cheese sticks together somewhat , but not as solidly as if it had also been cleaved by rennet . 
  the cheese also becomes `` slimier '' as opposed to waterier than normal , since you 're using more fat than usual . 
  so you get a very creamy and not-quite-solid cheese . 
  ( it 's fine to call it cheese . ), 
  damn , this is making me really hungry . 
  cheese is so tasty . 
  they 're some rather archaic trig functions that are n't really used today, 
   macrons in german, 
  absolutely verboten, 
  my family had to drag me to do this as a kid , because we had to do it really early in the morning so that we could get to the mushrooms first . 
  now i live in the sf bay area , where there is no decent source of mushrooms in 30 minutes but there 's also nobody who goes and picks all the mushrooms at dawn . 
  i 'd love to go picking mushrooms sometime . 
  yeah , nearly every alphabet descends from phoenician , which is really cool, 
  also one 's free, 
  a third part of me wants to move to northern siberia and start a family * there *, 
  fiji is , like , on the opposite side of the world from the congo though, 
   lower-class tourist, 
  according to the rest of this thread , does not compute, 
  nowhere near full-ride, 
  i 've had success with messageease ; it 's a little slower than default , but the keys are like nine times bigger so i 'm okay with the tradeoff, 
  funnily enough i have . 
  that 's what a lot of this thread misses ; there 's a lot of incredibly cheap locations, 
  well , and look at what you did ? 
  you spelled it wrong . 
  maybe they should have named it / r/flagporn after all . 
  ( on the other hand , / r/geology is n't named / r/earthporn , and / r/astronomy is n't named / r/spaceporn and so on , so really calling it / r/flagporn would be breaking the pattern if anything . ), 
  point taken , but / r/earthporn serves a completely different purpose than / r/geology . 
  / r/spaceporn 's content overlaps with / r/astronomy 's a lot more , but there 's still the difference that the / r/xporn subreddit covers pictures about x , while / r/xology covers everything related to x ( with a lot of pictures thrown in ) . 
  / r/vexillology does contain a lot of pictures of flags , but it 's also a place to discuss flag design , hold contests , etc. 
  you could theoretically create / r/flagporn and have different , somewhat narrower content than / r/vexillology . 
  probably the moderators of / r/vexillology created it and set it to private so that it ca n't compete with the main sub . 
  or someone created it a long time ago , figured he did n't want to moderate a dead sub anymore , and closed up shop . 
  who knows, 
  that does n't look like the transylvanian [ flag ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/sz%c3%a9kely_z%c3%a1szl%c3%b3#/media/file:flag_of_szekely_land.svg ) to me , friendo, 
   locs of smoked salmon, 
  i wish i had a keyboard that made puns whenever i mistyped something, 
  huh , they sound pretty similar in pie too, 
  we 've had evidence that tedd 's powers are a distinct `` thing '' ever since the magic-eater told him , `` no , you are a far more dangerous variety . '', 
  your characterization of them makes huge amounts of sense , though . 
  i wonder whom he 'll end up having to `` hunt '' .
