  the deck can gain a lot from card draw and consistency . 
  misdirection may or may not be runnable ; maybe sub for 2x powershot . 
  2x fiery bat is an interesting choice , and i 'd personally replace it with 1x oth and 1x arcane shot , but it 's not out of the question if you can get it to stick . 
  i look forward to your long-term appraisal . 
  ah well , i said that because there certainly * were * a couple people running longbow , but i do n't regard their decks as optimized . 
  it 's way too slow , and is better replaced with an early-game removal . 
   flamestrike or consecrate, 
  this is constructed not arena frienderino 8 < ), 
  in all seriousness , i 'm not sure how playable cat trick is yet . 
  bear trap is good because you get a taunt and it fuels your yogg , but cat trick just gets you a mildly difficult to remove 4/2 ( and it fuels your yogg ) . 
  given the disparity in awareness in the community about explosive trap , i ca n't help but wonder what the obvious * is . 
  * most people who have n't had to think about it too deeply think it 's great . 
  sign me up bro ! ), 
  many people who have , think it 's trash and run powershot instead . 
  / u/bigtallguy , who reached high legend two months ago , ran none , and apparently still beat the crap out of zoo . 
  i am between the two camps ; i think it 's playable as a board clear , and supplements hunter 's ( and especially ynl 's ) lack of ability to clear board . 
  but i also think it 's more generally terrible , and it 's definitely not worth running * two * of unless you 're having a third of your deck consist of secrets like a chump . 
  what about a miniony lnl allows you to run kill command ? 
  it 's not like anything you 'd put in it would be a beast . 
  i mean , i almost always throw explosive trap in when i 'm lnl-ing , but the disadvantage to using it is huge . 
  there are more cards than i can count that can circumvent it even when there 's minions on board , while when there 's no minions on board the entire druid hero power , or even just a * weapon , * can pop it . 
  it 's really weak . 
  powershot has none of these problems , and only costs one more mana . 
  what about while dolphin kicking ? 
  one of my friends has a steam name that 's a fruit in the genus * prunus . 
  * anyone know the name of this group so i can induct him ? 
  board clear and draw cards and do random bullshit . 
  best card . 
  just make sure you 've played spells . 
  i think that might be literally impossible unless your opponent has ice block in their deck, 
  edit : i mean if * you 're * the one playing yogg, 
  i think it 's scary because it 's symbolic of a violent uprising . 
  oh , i forgot yogg could summon sylvanas for your opponent . 
  good call . 
  huh , nice . 
  looks similar to most `` traditional '' ynl decklists except for the substitution of elekk with thalnos and secretkeeper . 
  i wonder if it 's better or worse than a traditional one . 
  ( also , explosive shot is great targeted big minion removal in a deck that does n't run kill command . 
  highly recommend . ), 
  last season i reached 10 without putting in any real work . 
  the season before that , i reached 3 with a strange variant that ran suboptimal cards like multi-shot ( i lacked a couple cards ) . 
  the season before that , / u/bigtallguy placed rank 8 legend with a very fine-tuned version of the deck . 
  that was a different meta , though . 
  secret paladin was actually a threat , so he ran flare , for example . 
  it is a * very * fun deck to play , perhaps the funnest . 
  control decks in general are fun , because you have more cards in your hand , and so more power . 
  but also yogg is a very fun card , even when he betrays you ( 10-20 % chance of this in ynl ) . 
  i highly recommend this deck . 
  if all you play is this deck , though , then you will get fatigued from it . 
  after playing it a lot , i had a game against a warlock where i coined into nothing , and traded tokens before killing the enemy cult master . 
  i have no explanation , but taking a day off helped things immensely . 
  i would n't call it tilt ; i was on a winning streak . 
  i guess it was more carelessness . 
  cheers , man !, 
  hope you enjoy it !, 
  yogg and lnl are only both relevant when you 're facing heavy control anyway , in which you need both kinds of card draw to stay at a card advantage and to beat fatigue . 
  ( astral communion is the worst thing that can happen to you there , but luckily it 's not a large chance . ), 
  in other matchups , you 'll care about lnl less the more aggro your opponent is , and yogg will usually only be relevant as a board clear , rather than as card draw , and especially not as a win condition . 
  how liberally you play cards is inversely proportional to how strong of a lnl turn you want , and proportional to how aggro the deck you are facing is . 
  yogg does n't enter into it because your few measly other card cycles do n't do anything other than cycle ( except for flare , but who runs flare ? 
  this is 2016 ) , and are so few in number that they 're not worth keeping around just for a lnl turn . 
  drawing yogg should never be a necessity except vs heavy , heavy control , and is just a card for the off chance that you have managed to lose advantage either in cards or on board . 
  maybe got it off lnl ? 
  unlikely, 
  bear trap 's actual trigger is , `` when your hero takes damage from getting attacked . '', 
  actual `` when your hero is attacked '' triggers work before the damage , like explosive and misdirection . 
  i was in siberia like two days ago . 
  it certainly is not even mostly on fire . 
  edit : oh , i see , it 's more on fire than usual . 
  health and psychology , law , history , politics , places they have n't been to, 
  apologies for the mostly terrible pictures . 
  i wanted to show something special about each trap . 
  - ** pitfall trap : ** catches the biggest , slowest , stupidest animals . 
  ( mostly moose and elk . 
  maybe 10,000 years ago , mammoths too . ), 
  - ** fox trap : ** the fox tries to catch the food on the wheel , but the wheel turns and the fox falls in the v-shaped crevasse and ca n't get out . 
  very useful because it keeps the fox alive , unlike other traps . 
  - ** fish trap : ** selectively permits small fish to swim back out . 
  specificity is important to any trap , but as a protein engineer i like the design very much , because the design works on the molecular scale as well ( although less well ) . 
  - ** den trap : ** deadfall placed over a fox 's den . 
  catches the animal when it comes out . 
  there were a couple other traps i did n't bother making , like the deadfall fowl trap and the deadfall bear trap , mostly because they were n't very interesting and bear trap is already a card . 
  i mean , kazakhs also look asian ... 
  like a 6 mana lock n load, 
  an it dropout would at least know how futile web security is, 
  wait . 
  why not attack face with death 's bite * first , * then play leeroy ? 
  or am i missing something here ? 
  edit : oops , that 's battle rage , not inner rage . 
  still , seems better than the alternative ... 
   knows about ddos, 
   thinks it 's a security issue, 
  lightbomb ? 
  by the way , are you aware that your name is nearly [ a delicious siberian food ? 
  you inspired me to [ make some . 
  http://gen.lib.rus.ec is a modern day library of alexandria, 
  expansions have n't had themes for a while now , though, 
  tagalog has a relatively small alphabet . 
  it probably figured out that since 100 % of the letters in the tagalog alphabet are present in this , it 's probably tagalog . 
  now that i think about it , shaman has more or less the second worst board clears after rogue .
