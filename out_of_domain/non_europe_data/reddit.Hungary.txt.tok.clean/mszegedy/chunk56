  aha , i knew that first part , but i never knew having larger chambers would make it less laggy ( because does n't it still pump it at the same rate ? 
  ) , but i get it now ( pump it from a block not touching a wall ! ) . 
  brilliant !,

  is it safe to say the dwarven kidneys are located in the neck or some bs like that ?

  [ rose : this is not even to speak of the chronological peculiarities . 
  after traveling some distance , we could discover we were suddenly tailgating our own meteor from several days ago . 
  [ rose : if we are particularly unfortunate , we might even collide in an intersection of spacetime with a meteor piloted by our future selves . 
  [ rose : and if we looked closely at that meteor before impact , we might notice a very large dent in it , which it originally suffered during the very collision we were about to experience . 
  well , anything that 's different from one universe to the next is scratch 's design . 
  and my point is that one of the things that is different is the sufferer 's biology . 
  how about not this again .

  no , i destroyed it quite a few times !, 
  the mothertree lost all of its leaves when i accidentally right-clicked with a red matter katar , and its base received quite a few blasts from a variety of different explosions ( no nuclear ones though ) . 
  but the destruction you see here was controlled . 
  first , i used quarries ... then my red matter morningstar ... and then , once i got infernal armor , i just kept spamming c. it 's supposed to float like that !,

  second time in 24 hours that i get to correct someone on latin versus greek !, 
  ( i 'm a student of both ancient languages . ), 
  `` liber '' is latin for a bunch of annoying , seemingly-unrelated things : it can be the adjective for `` free '' , and as a noun it can be `` book '' ; also , `` liber\u012b '' means `` children '' , the verb `` liber\u014d '' means `` to free '' , and `` libert\u0101s '' means `` freedom '' . 
  '' \u0392\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ( biblos ) '' , on the other hand , is the ancient greek word for `` book '' , also '' \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03bd ( biblion ) '' or '' \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd ( bibliophorion ) '' . 
  the word `` bibliotheque '' comes from ancient greek '' \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b7 ( bibliotheke ) '' , which means `` bookcase '' . 
  latin for `` leaf '' is `` f\u014dlium '' , while ancient greek for `` leaf '' is '' \u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd ( phullon ) '' . 
  edit : spelled '' \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd '' with a pi rather than a phi , and put the accent on the wrong omicron . 
  now , fixed . 
  i still do n't get it . 
  i mean , it 's obviously stairs because it 's in the title and everything is sideways ... but i do n't get how the op got sideways . 
  there 's no way i know of to rotate yourself , or even the view in vanilla minecraft ...
