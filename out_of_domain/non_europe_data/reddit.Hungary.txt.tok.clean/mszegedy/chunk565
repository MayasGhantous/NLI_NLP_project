  - bell peppers , tomato , or both, 
  - probably onions, 
  - salami ? 
  - eggplant ? 
  or octopus tentacle slices ? 
  - some kind of herbal seasoning and some kind of broth . 
  the broth is made of something orange , either carrots or sweet potato . 
  for the seasoning , i 'll take a wild guess and say it 's oregano , but i ca n't really tell, 
  otherwise , i dunno , man . 
  edit : i get it i get it , salami was a dumb guess lol, 
  it 's closest to central asia , but `` central asia '' evokes steppe nomads ... 
  but how often will your enemy have the counter ? 
  who even runs kodo except in arena ? 
  maybe it 's slightly overcosted , but it 's a great card . 
  every card . 
  in the game . 
  every other card everywhere gets deleted from the servers and replaced with this . 
  spare parts can freeze, 
  hey !, 
  it 's mszegedy # 1229 , i think . 
  i 'll double-check when i get home . 
  i do n't play as often as i used to , because now i have gotten into better online tcgs , like duelyst and eternal . 
  ( also , my favorite deck , yogg n load , was nerfed into the ground . ), 
  hearthstone is still fun and very watchable though . 
  how long have you been playing ? 
  it ca n't be 1444 , the ottos and austria ate hungary, 
  i do hope we 'll get some new interesting cards . 
  too bad i 'm too f2p to afford any of them , heh ... 
  ah yeah , the 6 mana 5/5 guy, 
  that 's a different book, 
  who were they part of for hundreds of years again ? 
  oh , right , hungary and then austria ... 
  also john mcafee, 
  they 've got common ancestry with the czechs . 
  they just live somewhere else . 
  should cost 4 or 5 , versus other minion removals like assassinate and flame lance . 
  well , that and weapon synergies like blade flurry . 
  come to think of it , the ability to have a card like this is one advantage of the hated blade flurry nerf . 
  the question is , do we want `` deal damage to it equal to its attack , '' or `` it deals damage to itself equal to its attack '' ? 
  the second one is marginally more interesting imo . 
  if there 's nothing else on board , he has a 1 in 200 trillion chance of otking your opponent from 30 health . 
  maddest bomber op please nerf, 
  yeah , this is a `` take an extra turn '' card for miracle rogue . 
  yeah , but that 's a different style and quantity of shitty reviews than steam . 
  on amazon , if you look at the first five reviews or so , they 're all usually very helpful . 
  on steam , four out of those five are probably shitty one-liner jokes . 
  looks like kind of like a mushroom from genus [ * morchella ;*] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morchella ) check out [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/longnek1.jpg ) young morel . 
  i think it worked once in an anime ... ? 
  what about wallachia ? 
  hilariously , potassium is like the one element they * do n't * export, 
  reddit is never critical of the daily mail or the sun except in one comment thread per post . 
  they make it to the front page daily . 
  this is great !, 
  one small typesetting question : why serifs for the text , but sans-serif for the title at the bottom ? 
  it looks a little weird . 
  [ they did !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antimony#top_producers_and_production_volumes ) in 2010 , anyway . 
  not on linux !, 
  unless it does now . 
  i have n't played in a while . 
  it was a ronald reagan thing before it was a donald trump thing , so ... depends on when the event was made ? 
  i 'm a fan of the uralo-siberian hypothesis , let 's be friends, 
  shaman . 
  any kind of shaman . 
  this needs to be in / r/whitepeoplegifs , they 'd love it, 
  edit : yup , someone already crossposted , good job, 
  explosive is not a good t1 draw vs shaman . 
  ( it 's not a very good card in general , but shaman does n't run buff cards afaik so it 's okay . ), 
  cat trick is decent , but it wo n't reliably trigger before the totem golem gets value . 
  you 'll want specifically freezing trap going first , and specifically snipe going second . 
  of course , there 's situations where they do n't topdeck totem golem immediately , but it 's less predictable in that case . 
  but anyway , hunter in general sucks vs shaman in general , especially if the shaman techs eater of secrets ( which is n't by any means common , but is relevant to the op ) . 
  it 's a bad matchup for hunter for the same reasons zoo is a bad matchup for hunter : it runs too many minions for hunter to be able to get rid of all of them effectively . 
  * except , * hunter has removals that can kill zoo really dead if the hunter chooses to run them ( powershot , unleash the hounds , quickshot , even explosive trap , explosive shot , and multi-shot ) , not to mention highmanes , cats , and grandmothers that trade up in that matchup , whereas shaman 's minions have slightly too much health for effective removal . 
  you play quickshot on a 1-drop ( or trade your 2-drop in ) , you play snipe on a 2-drop , you trade highmane into a 0-drop , and you 've removed only like half their minions . 
  70 % is an impressive winrate vs shamans , and i 'm curious about how you manage it . 
  is it a standard malygos hunter list ? 
  the link does n't appear in some mobile browsers due to the formatting .

  [ mourad : new moroccan ] ( https://www.amazon.com/dp/1579654290/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_kbkfybc4bsjd9 ), 
  i just wan na play this smw hack, 
  they almost certainly knew , on the principle that if there 's something funny in a comedy movie , it 's probably there on purpose, 
  funnily enough though , the `` zs '' digraph is only found in hungarian, 
  voted for the kazakh dude . 
  got ta stick up for the fellow ex-soviet satellite states ( although kazakhstan was part of the ussr proper , unlike my country of hungary ) . 
  he lost narrowly !, 
  oh well , it 's hs , rng happens, 
  hallazeal/fatigue/concede shaman totally * is * a control deck . 
  it has a silly win con , but it 's control . 
  it 's completely reactive . 
  you can tech violet illusionist against it . 
  what if two ice blocks just * is n't enough ? 
  buff . 
  you 'd almost never pull it off of itself . 
  i 'm not into a girl unless i 've known them a while , like half a year or more . 
  in my time since i started college up until now ( a few years into grad school ) , i 've gotten to know maybe six girls my age well , and was only into one of them ( whom i dated for a long time , and then broke up with a couple years ago ) . 
  i 'm not sure if i have the time or desire to be more proactive about this . 
  or also gobwin knob to invade the mk . 
  they might even provisionally ally together , to stop the censure . 
  i find the situation comparable to the comments tom moderates personally at gunnerkrigg , except he 's somehow managed to still keep doing it ( in batches at a time ) and only suffer * one * ( two ? ),
