  breakdown in the process . 
  it should be a 0 mana destroy , like sacrificial pact . 
  4 attack is way too situational for a 1 mana destroy card . 
  they can still get a carnymancer to do the portal . 
  the rationale behind holding off on that was , `` it 's a great idea , but we do n't need to right now and we do n't trust carnies . '', 
  when the very existence of your side is on the line , that rationale changes . 
  til neutron stars are supposed to have an internal structure . 
  i thought that they were just uniform hyperdense balls . 
  great explanation , but you may have wanted to reply to [ this guy , ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5am6o8/scientists_confirm_a_structural_similarity_found/d9i0tsy/ ) not me . 
  probably mixed it up with lw\u00f3w , silly ukrainians, 
  kind of undermined by the fact that he 's clearly going for the fists though, 
  what about ` ch ** __ 4 __ ** ` is n't simple and intuitive for you , geez ? 
  ( does that even work anymore ? 
  sick meme, 
  no , i want a subscript , which used to be possible on this sub, 
  ah , i misremembered the number of asterisks and underscores . 
  good call !, 
  sure , i never implied the difference was bad . 
  it 's just interesting to see how moderating comments can get to an author . 
  you would n't think it 's such a big deal , but empirically it is . 
  \\* checks out prequel \\* whoa , it 's the another homestuck style thing , complete with the arrow and [ s ] stuff . 
  hussie really started a genre did n't he, 
  i mean , technically we are n't . 
  `` allergic '' means it provokes an immune response if you come into contact with it . 
  time does not do this . 
  ( before someone tells me about being fun at parties : you brought this upon yourselves ! ), 
  i am not normally one for conspiracy theories , but it seems likely that the guy who made fandral had insider knowledge . 
  the expansion dropped shortly thereafter , so the card was already designed and tested by then . 
  * to be fair , * i did not directly say that he is wrong . 
  but i do n't think we 're `` literally '' allergic to time , either . 
  what 's that even supposed to mean ? 
  i do n't think i 've heard it in the us . 
  the last time i heard it was late at night in a small restaurant in khanty-mansiysk , russia . 
   every detail is as medically accurate as possible, 
  not true . 
  this is stylized so that the mechanisms can be easily shown . 
  a real cell is jam-packed with proteins and things , and all motion is random and thermal . 
  those kinesins would n't be stepping in rhythm in real life ; their `` feet '' would be undergoing random motion until they found the next `` rung '' . 
  ( also , all of this is in false color , but everyone probably knew that already ), 
  dialup is way faster than 0.07 millibytes per second , and way slower than 0.07 megabytes per second , so either way you interpreted it ... 
  wow i 'm pretty surprised mercy had the damage to pull off that kill, 
  maybe not the damage itself , but the amount of it ... especially considering that she 's using that shitty blaster, 
  reminds me of [ david goodsell 's ] ( http://mgl.scripps.edu/people/goodsell/ ) drawings of cells and macromolecules , but with a more vibrant color palette and more depth . 
  good job !, 
  it 's every second-rate social/political commentary newspaper comic ever . 
  in / r/100yearsago we get comics often , and they 're exactly as subtle as this one . 
  i like using cursive when learning a new writing system , simply because if you have a table of glyphs in front of you , the stroke order is often way more obvious if the glyphs are cursive than if they are in print , and it 's usually an easy , consistent , and nice-looking stroke order . 
  both my ipa and my cyrillic looked illegible and awkward until i learned their cursive versions . 
  writing them in cursive did wonders for my consistency and legibility . 
  ( there are exceptions of course . 
  cursive versions of writing systems with a lot of glyphs usually suck , like cursive egyptian hieroglyphs , i.e. 
  hieratic and demotic , and cursive mayan glyphs , which are basically the same as the carved versions but differentiated by less details . ), 
  ha , i had to write that with my off hand , on account of a broken right hand . 
  it was in the more recent era where we had to reproduce an email , as well . 
  i 'm glad they 're gon na have a viable deck now , probably, 
  so far , the bingo square that comes to mind is `` a 0-mana minion '' , which kun fulfills to a t. 
  jake 's pistols do a surprising amount of damage, 
  and thing from below is a 6 mana 5/5 and arcane giant is a 12 mana 8/8 , but they were explicitly the minions that that bingo square had in mind , and you know why . 
  welp :( it was a good guess , but this * is * hearthstone ... 
  it is very relatable , and i am glad you showed me it . 
  thank you . 
  it is still active , right ? 
  that 's good , though , since you can run two of those and they cost half the dust . 
  eat indochina . 
  kick ass . 
  and the existence of thailand , uganda , latin empire , etc, 
  i 'd say she has an equal amount of flexibility ; while her mechanic is more consistent than reno 's , with reno you are guaranteed a full heal once his condition is met , so you can do things like run him in a mill deck with all 2-ofs and still get value , which does n't work with tyrande . 
  unless it * only * counts 1-ofs . 
  like innervate with an extra draw and `` every turn '' tick , balanced by the fact that you have to deal all of your damage before playing it . 
  this is pretty cool . 
  edit : also balanced by the fact that you can only play it later in the game , unlike innervate which lets you potentially cheat out a 5-drop or 6-drop on turn 1 . 
  sure , but once you do play him , he 's functionally a 0-mana minion . 
  not every 0-mana condition can be as broken as `` lose 1 cost every time you do something you do all the time '' . 
  how would this interact with jaraxxus ? 
  if you kill yourself by playing it , do you lose ? 
  from elsewhere in the thread :, 
   unless it * only * counts 1-ofs . 
  your interpretation makes more sense , but honestly , that 's really op and is just a card that 's straight up not a good idea to print . 
  wait , this is n't what you 're supposed to say ? 
  dammit !, 
  did you start as mzab or tlimsan ? 
  the latter may be easier , but i imagine the former is more rewarding ... 
  i imagine , but is the warlock 's health getting drained to 0 sufficient to kill the player ? 
  i 'm sure someone 's already tested this with mirror entity + knife juggler , although maybe that would deal damage to jaraxxus , not the warlock . 
  what i do n't understand is that the address is hungarian , but the english placeholder text is in english and the sign on the left is in english . 
  the address is the only thing that makes me think that this is somewhere in budapest near/at the nemzeti lev\u00e9lt\u00e1r , rather than a construction site in the hungarian quarter of a city in some english-speaking country . 
  i do n't know if it 's still true , but a couple years ago we had the second lowest recorded percentage of english speakers in europe , and the lowest was turkey which is n't even in europe for the most part . 
  `` no one speaks english here '' is very accurate if you interpret it as hyperbole , like you ought to . 
  i 'm removing all of my / r/all filters and watching the fireworks . 
  wow , i ca n't believe you guessed my exa -- i mean , of course , well memed . 
  [ popular ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/azathoth.jpg ) in the lovecraft mythos , yeah, 
  you know english , close enough, 
  holy crap that 's a lot of speakers considering the speaking community 's been cut off for nearly a thousand years , and has n't had a state of their own for a while now . 
  i 'm jealous . 
  [ \u0150 yes ] ( http://smbc-comics.com/comics/20130709after.gif ), 
  joke # 2016 ? 
  i do n't think the bipartisan system will change unless the us replaces fptp voting with some other system , like preferential voting . 
  who cares if he writes in unless he 's in a swing state ? 
  my vote for president entirely did not matter yesterday , because i am registered in a blue state . 
  clinton won in my state by a margin of millions .
