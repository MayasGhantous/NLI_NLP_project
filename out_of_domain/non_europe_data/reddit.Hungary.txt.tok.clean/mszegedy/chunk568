  only reason i 'm not making it every day is it 's freaking expensive , especially if you buy farm-raised tuna . 
   the star in the center of the frame does n't move . 
  this is polaris - the `` north star '' . 
  well , none of them do ... 
  heh , i was just teasing , i 'm sure most people understood what you meant . 
  how is that a tram ? 
  there 's no wires overhead . 
   ca n't be translated, 
  i 'm tired of this meme and more broadly any claims of this or that being untranslateable . 
  in this case , how about `` the appropriate amount '' ? 
  some of us have heard of it , but forgot . 
  it was a while ago . 
  no recognition for middle english `` acsen '' :(, 
  op 's from the caucasus, 
  then how do you explain all the other uralic language speakers , or all the austronesian language speakers , huh ? 
  that 's kind of funny . 
  i know this post is talking about grammar , but versus learning widely-spoken languages like english , i 've always thought that it 's kind of unfortunate that many * linguae francae * have an unusual amount of cross-linguistically rare phonological characteristics . 
  spanish is pretty generic , except for maybe the dental fricatives , but english , mandarin , arabic , and russian all have a couple weird things about them . 
  - english and mandarin both have a bazillion possible vowel nuclei , most of them diphthongs , and have r-colored vowels and aspirated consonants . 
  mandarin also has 5-way tone distinction on every syllable , which is n't exactly common . 
  - arabic has 8-way placement distinction on consonants , and pharyngealization distinction on certain dentals and alveolars in particular . 
  it , however , mostly lacks voicing distinction , and distinguishes only 3 vowels . 
  - russian has 5-way placement distinction on consonants , and distinguishes palatalization and voicing on every single one of them ( except for / x / and / j / ) . 
  it has 5 phonemic vowels , but around 23 vowel phones . 
  i mean , not every language has a simple and generic phonology , but it 's silly that we got stuck with stuff like r-colored vowels for our universal languages . 
  is diane an alternate-universe susan ? 
  but then how do we have her birth records , which universe is it , etc. 
  maybe they really are just half-sisters . 
  then type `` ss '' , not `` b '' !, 
  otherwise you give german speakers cancer, 
  hmm , but this has you turn your wheels while standing still . 
  yeah , that 's what i mean by placement . 
  in arabic , you have labial , labio-dental , dental , alveolar , palatal , velar , uvular , pharyngeal , and glottal . 
  also known as a lot . 
  r-colored vowels are uncommon . 
  wikipedia says they occur in less than 1 % of the world 's languages , citing [ * sounds of the world 's languages * ] ( https://books.google.com/books?id=h1byjz_rwucc ) as a source . 
  the best ones are found in south india . 
  [ badaga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/badaga_language ) used to distinguish three degrees of r-coloring . 
  edit : [ another , possibly better link , with voice samples ] ( http://www.phonetics.ucla.edu/appendix/languages/badaga/badaga.html ), 
  that 's a letter in serbian cyrillic , pronounced `` dz '' . 
  there is also i in there , which is n't in russian cyrillic , but is part of the ukrainian alphabet and pronounced like \u0418 . i 'm at a loss as to the g , d , f , and l though . 
  formal finnish has gender distinction ? 
  that 's very unusual for a uralic language .

  i 'm nay ^ ( ( any ?

  the first two lines are the lyrics to leonard cohen 's `` the old revolution '' , somewhat garbled . 
  some notes :, 
  - you need to be consistent with which side the vowels go on . 
  i 'll accept n\u0320 as a special glyph for `` and '' , but n\u033c for `` in '' and v\u0302 / v\u0307\u0302 for `` of '' is simply inconsistent with how the dummy o is used elsewhere , such as with o\u0304sk for `` ask '' . 
  i guess you could argue that since english does n't permit words to end in lax vowels anyway , the usage is unambiguous , but then why bother having o\u0304z for `` as '' ? 
  except for that one place ... 
  - you also need to be consistent with s vs z. w\u0302s and k\u0307\u014bs ( although the actual lyric is just `` king '' ) are not consistent with having z in `` as '' . 
  - what 's the deal with / \u0268 / , / \u026a / , and / i / ? 
  granted , the pronunciation varies somewhat between english dialects , but \u25cc \u0320 and \u25cc \u0307 seem to basically interchangeably refer to these three phonemes . 
  \u25cc \u0320 is used more frequently for / \u0268 / and / \u026a / than \u25cc \u0307 , but not exclusively . 
  \u25cc \u0307 is used for / i / exclusively , though ... except in `` any '' at the bottom , if that 's what that word is . 
  ( but a received pronunciation speaker would pronounce it / \u02c8\u00e6n\u026a / , so maybe it 's consistent ? 
  if you 're british ? 
  but then what about the entire rest of the sample ? ), 
  - you may want to get a different glyph for / \u03b8 / , since the current one looks like the dummy o with a line through it . 
  i recommend cursive theta [ ( the one on the right ) ] ( http://www.foundalis.com/lan/hw/hwlq.gif ) . 
  - what 's the logic behind the vertical bar in `` side '' ? 
  the double accent already marks / a\u026a / . 
  edit : actually , maybe that 's `` i 'm an english ... '' at the bottom , as an unfinished phrase , with the line under n indicating that it 's `` an '' and not ... dunno , still does n't make sense . 
  maybe the line under was just an accident ? 
  * caught you !, 
  wait maybe this is one of those things we can blame the muslims for . 
  after all , arabic is written right to left . 
  wow , flashbacks to the hungarization movement we had in the turn of the 20th century in hungary . 
  the literate elite insisted we use `` t\u00e1vbesz\u00e9l\u0151 '' ( far-talker ) instead of `` telefon '' and things like that . 
  success was partial , as seems to be the case here . 
  a comparative study would be really interesting . 
   although it is not directly incorporated into proteins , hydroxyproline comprises roughly 4 % of all amino acids found in animal tissue , an amount greater than seven other amino acids that are translationally incorporated . 
   hydroxyproline is found in few proteins other than collagen . 
  for this reason , hydroxyproline content has been used as an indicator to determine collagen and/or gelatin amount . 
  huh . 
  left side is :, 
  - latvian, 
  - lithuanian, 
  - georgian, 
  - ukrainian, 
  right side is :, 
  - estonian, 
  - armenian, 
  - also ukrainian ??? 
  bottom is russian . 
  you can mostly tell the apart by the alphabets . 
  but i do n't know of a language written with cyrillic that commonly uses hyphens ; it 's probably some random language from siberia . 
  ( although the use of \u0426 and \u0414 makes that seem unlikely too , since neither of those sounds are common in siberia . 
  maybe a tungusic language ? ), 
  also the bottom two both look like ukrainian . 
  maybe one of them is belarussian or rusyn or something , but i see no reason that either of those languages would be acknowledged , considering rusyn did n't have a republic associated with it and belarus is russian-speaking for the most part . 
  how does one get that sound ? 
  it looks protein-coding though . 
  every other residue is an acid , and there 's a tryptophan in there , which is pretty indicative of this being somewhere in the middle of a beta sheet . 
  edit : a really long beta sheet .
