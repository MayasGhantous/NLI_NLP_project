  maybe . 
  i do n't think i saw any glycines in there , so i dunno . 
  the [ glottolog page ] ( http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/wakh1245 ) may be a good place to look , although it appears / u/t9c-gars has done most of the looking for you . 
  edit : libgen has [ * on the ghalgach languages * ] ( http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=27384afaa4ffa0f8c80c03c32086d314 ) , which has a basic grammar sketch , a couple samples , and a decent dictionary . 
  thank god for libgen . 
  edit 2 : it 's 140 years out of date , though . 
  yes, 
  i am not the original guy , i just made an educated guess, 
  does it bother anyone else that the second air vent was n't active ? 
  now those viennettas are n't going to have the chocolate properly spread out in that layer . 
  itt : americans who have never cheated before, 
  [ reddit enhancement suite ] ( http://redditenhancementsuite.com `` also / r/enhancement '' ), 
  it varies , but the us is certainly on the low end of the spectrum . 
  edit : i wish i had harder data , but the best thing i could find at the moment is [ this study ] ( http://fortune.com/2016/06/06/foreign-students-cheating/ ) which found that foreign students in the us had a higher rate of cheating than domestic students . 
  but that 's hardly persuasive . 
  i 'm mainly basing my claim on conversations i 've had with a total of 15 or so students from central/eastern europe , the middle east/north africa , south asia , east asia , and southeast asia , in which the students talked about how often kids cheat where they 're from . 
  it seems to get more prevalent the further east you go . 
  no fair , back when i posted this i did n't see any, 
  p r o t o c o m m u n i s m, 
  i 've had a lot of success starting as ayutthaya . 
  then you just ruin yourself , annex sukhothai one way or another , and release them as a vassal , selecting `` play as vassal '' . 
  this is the strangest fact in the thread . 
  what the hell is up with that ? 
  well , skanderbeg here or there , albania * is * one of the best examples of why the ottoman army is ultimately unstoppable . 
  that and rhodes . 
  and every other place they conquered . 
  they conquered so many remote , well-defended places , it 's amazing . 
  maybe they 're more familiar with ogg than with trevor . 
  also , it gave them an opportunity to explain what game it 's from . 
   maybe they 're more familiar with ogg than with trevor . 
  why does that make it special enough to get counted ? 
  usually you 'd either count just lexemes , or count all the inflections . 
  counting citation forms of lexemes and things that are more than one inflection of something is strange and useless . 
  then you always get to count '' < verb  ed '' and '' < verb  ing '' for every weak verb , just because they 're both participles in addition to something else , despite that the two inflections represented by each form never differ from one another except in strong verbs . 
  and even then , - ing will always represent both the present participle and the gerund . 
  do they really count , then ? 
  either way , it 's more likely that op did n't bother to be consistent than that they were following some sort of arcane schema where they singled out inflections with only one meaning as the thing that they do n't count . 
  or you plug the electricity in backwards , and the dna runs off the backside . 
  it is !, 
  sequence the protein via mass spectrometry or something, 
  develop and synthesize a gene that codes for that protein, 
  transfect gene to bacteria, 
  absolutely foolproof , quick , and inexpensive i tell you, 
  1 mana cycle is never balanced . 
  i guess unless it 's 3 mana . 
  maybe he 's a troll then ? 
  yeah , but they had by far the most favorable prediction out there . 
  every * other * prediction gave 99 % to clinton . 
  silver and co. are now being praised for being prophets . 
  i 'm sure you could build some kind of machine that copies proteins , though . 
  it 'd have to be complicated because you 'd have to disentangle it into a string , which involves snipping cys-cys bonds and stuff , and also there 's no obvious way to match like amino acids up with like ( maybe with special bracket molecules , playing a similar role as trnas do in translation ) , but it 's theoretically possible . 
  too bad we suck at building stuff . 
  there is n't any preexisting thing to rip off here . 
  it 's actually a green * three * python , so glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate . 
  edit : or maybe we misheard and it 's a green * free * python , so green fluorescent protein . 
  but they 're so messy . 
  i 'd write numbers . 
   the `` reverse '' part of reverse polish notation means that the operator comes at the end : ` r1 r1 add ` . 
  which is why the guy you replied to called it `` polish notation '' , not `` reverse polish notation '' . 
  either that or he edited it . 
  do grad students count as students ? 
  looks like the steppes are still firmly under the control of the h\u00e5rds, 
  ca n't they also get in through your eyes ? 
  is it chemically relevant that this is a halogen ? 
  ( not that it 's a problem if it is n't . ), 
  no doubt it can exist long enough to do chemistry , but would we expect it to have any of the disinguishing behaviors of a halogen ? 
  you 're talking to a guy whose heaviest element he normally works with is sulfur . 
  you got downvoted but you 're right , `` exiled to siberia '' generally meant somewhere in siberia proper , not the far east . 
  the gulags furthest east were probably the ones in kolyma , like the one in \u00d6ym\u00f6k\u00f6\u00f6n . 
  which , granted , is in the far east , but represents an outlier . 
  that 's fair , looks like there 's a good amount of them where the poles are located in the op . 
  also , a pair of them costs 20 times less than other legendaries . 
  ... when else would you eat lunch ? 
  approximate times at which i eat meals , for example :, 
  - breakfast : 9 am, 
  - brunch : noon, 
  - lunch : 3 pm, 
  - another lunch : 6 pm, 
  - dinner : 9 pm, 
  yeah , but the appearance of anatolians has n't really changed since the 4th century , which is why picturing a modern turkish dude is probably the most accurate thing you can do . 
  ( also , it was n't * much * later ; turkic settlement of anatolia began in the 6th century . 
  it was the balkans that remained mostly turk-free for a long time until the ottomans conquered them . ), 
  edit : ( with the exception of the bulgars ), 
  i am hungarian, 
  edit : to be fair , i am currently a grad student in america , but i think americans eat differently . 
  they have less meals but larger ones , with dinner at 7 pm or so . 
  i have lunch together with everyone else , though , around 3 pm . 
  but that may be influenced by our class and lab schedules . 
  ah , around `` lunch '' time we are working , and thus have lunch at `` light snack '' time instead . 
  makes sense . 
  on days when we do n't work at noon , i have brunch by myself , which i guess is why i have n't observed the americans having lunch then . 
  ( the guy who played the master in season 3 of new who ), 
  oh , nice , i did n't know about this package . 
  the only linguistics-related package i 've actually used is ` gb4e ` , for glosses , and it 's kind of a pain . 
  wikibooks has got a [ list ] ( https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/latex/linguistics ) of them . 
   hunter, 
   viable spell-heavy deck, 
  i got to legend with yogg-n-load pre-nerf , and i still would n't call control hunter viable . 
  maybe now it can be ? 
  but every hunter spell is a removal spell .
