  '' ] ( http://qntm.org/option ), 
  good job at offending everyone in this thread . 
  usually comments like yours either make people think that they 're so much more intelligent than their peers , something which all people like to think , and they upvote . 
  or , it offends them because there is n't enough presence as was mentioned and they believe the commenter was referring to them , and they downvote . 
  yours has clearly done the latter . 
  do you have any idea how difficult it was to actually make it look like this ? 
  this is not simply a matter of making it a 3d set and popping it into blender . 
  it 's the rest that makes it a worthwhile render . 
  try rendering , and if you do n't like it , you 'll at least gain some perspective . 
  that did used to be the correct spelling . 
  [ you fail at google images ?

  oh , okay then !, 
  i take back everything i said . 
  i do n't know if i want that program to be released or not ; it really does sound like a karma-printing machine . 
  post it to / r/redstone !, 
  ( or whatever it 's called ) you are a true ... what am i even supposed to call you . 
  point is , i am really impressed with your workaround for `` outsourcing '' the random number generator . 
  it takes a lot of thinking ( or an epiphany ! ), 
  to come up with this kind of brilliant piece of engineering . 
  thank you so much for this ; will use !, 
  i do n't remember . 
  was n't it , like , g and h or something ? 
  and romanians !, 
  really ? 
  how come ? 
  ( we hate you because all of your land used to be ours and we 're still butthurt about the 1920 treaty of trianon . ), 
  how is that possible ? 
  that 's really cool !, 
  kinda blurry , though , enough so that i ca n't tell which doctor it is . 
  is it eccleston ? 
  hello , lokianeule !, 
  [ have you forgotten already ? 
  ( also i can make a dialect with more tenses and moods and noun classes ( ughhhhhhhh ) if you like ! ), 
  ( i think noun classes are really pointless , unless they are useful ), 
  ( wait , it already has too many moods , what am i saying ), 
  ( yeah , it needs more ... not tenses , we 've got enough of those ; aspects , though , it does , as well as ... \\* shudder * ... noun classes ), 
  i 'm guessing he was having clientside difficulties commenting , because he commented back to nfreni again . 
  [ here !, 
  not based on japanese , but completely independent !, 
  i must have forgotten something ? 
  what is this referencing ? 
  numbers in succession are always reported and abbreviated least to greatest ( especially in britain , which uses the dd/mm/yy date format ) . 
  that 's what i thought , but why is his coat black ( leather ? 
  ) , then ? 
  is this directly post-regeneration ? 
  attached to a bunny , which will get hanged when the doctor leaves !, 
  i * was * translating [ this ] ( http://www.unilang.org/viewtopic.php?f=85&amp;t=35353 ) poem into it , but i do n't know where the goddamn hell all of my work for it went . 
  or maybe the bad quality just distorts the colors ? 
  i am extremely jealous . 
  this is practically my dream build , and it would have cost me much more !, 
  like with samus aran/zero suit samus . 
  as the creator of the language , i get to make them up !, 
  also , i have an architecture set already for pronouns anyway . 
  wait , there 's a difference ? 
  i suppose the word `` ignorance '' implies a simple lack of knowledge , while `` stupidity '' means it is of their own volition ? 
  just recently , he posted this :, 
   what you 're suggesting can be accomplished by the means of arbitration . 
  unfortunately , this is not the course of action the two parties have decided to take . 
  it is n't reckless or stupid because , ideally , the most unbiased verdict could be ruled by such people only . 
   in their eyes , both google and oracle are just two companies who are having a dispute , that needs to be resolved . 
   to a guy related to the industry , oracle is this great big evil company , who ruthlessly enforces ip and does little for the open-source world . 
  google is this cool company , which apparently contributes , is well disposed to open-source tech and whose unoffical motto is `` do n't be evil '' , which is nice . 
   with these `` regular people '' , the playing field is levelled for both google and oracle and now its anyone 's ball game . 
  both have to present their case , explain their stand and make sure that the jury understands what they are supposed to understand to rule in their favor . 
  with `` joe six packs '' in the jury sitting `` cluelessly '' on this trial , it all comes down to the strength of the case and the skill of the lawyer to present his case and all the necessary background . 
   ideally , this is how it should be imo . 
   and , undermining the intelligence of the public is not correct and insulting imo . 
  the public and people are smarter than you think and have the ability to understand anything when explained properly . 
   edit : grammer , spelling , structure and content, 
  long enough to make me think he 's trolling here . 
  what 's the ipv6 localhost address ? 
  i think he means `` meme '' , but you used it correctly , so i 'm going to assume `` summary '' . 
  there is no thread . 
  karma on this post was 1025 , so sad to upset the balance, 
  ** karmaception **, 
  yeah , those stutid skytheists are inherenetly idiots !, 
  it is obvoisly that anyone who believes things are a complete moron , through and through !, 
  he was n't necessarily referring to post-scratch jade . 
  black queen = bq, 
  b is the second letter of the alphabet , and a q looks like a 0 with a 1 attached to it, 
  half life 3 confirmed, 
  ( also , bq is probably dead . ), 
  edit : also , alternate proof :, 
  black queen = bq, 
  bbq is a popular acronym, 
  bbq has 3 letters, 
  half life 3 confirmed, 
  i am thinking of it in the traditional sense as well . 
  you can call pretty much anything a `` meme '' ; the modern usage is technically correct as well , even if it only accounts for memes that become used repeatedly by a wide variety of people . 
  ... i do linguistics , and the motto of that field is also `` descriptive , not prescriptive '' . 
  i wonder which fields you can say that about and which you ca n't ? 
  you ca n't say it about particle physics , certainly : although it is descriptive to a great degree , our standard model predicts particles we have n't even found solid evidence for yet . 
  i dunno , it usually just makes me feel worse . 
  ** so brave **, 
  it 's an overplayed meme from / r/gaming ; give them the credit . 
  edit : to the two people who downvoted , do you realize that i 'm the one who posted the joke in the first place ? 
  it 's not like i 'm trying to discredit the poster . 
  i 'm basically fucking him . 
  i am the star .
