  except for the ones that are n't , which are mostly trash ( except for tracking and a couple secrets ) . 
  it 's like freeze mage , but less consistent !, 
  muphry 's law : if you write anything criticizing editing or proofreading , there will be a fault of some kind in what you have written . 
  ( also , you wanted an em dash , not a hyphen . ), 
  that is brunch . 
  in hungarian we call it the '' ( thing that is of ) ten o'clock '' . 
  but ten o'clock is usually too early , at least for me . 
  growing up , it was usually a slice of bread with something on it , generally bologna ( `` parizer '' ) and cheese , maybe with a side of pickles or something . 
  these days , what is on the slice of bread is smoked salmon .

   the medical community 's slow acceptance of prions as disease vectors, 
  is that a thing ? 
  i thought it was basically common knowledge that they 're disease vectors . 
  i 'm not allowed to donate blood in the usa because of prions . 
  i probably should have clarified in the original post , but i did n't think it would be that weird , and now i ca n't think of a concise way to put it in . 
  in math , yes , but even in logic arrow diagrams , you have it ? 
  why break the convention ? 
  i think that 's an octopus tentacle , though, 
  i have , between 1980 and the present day , spent more than 5 cumulative years in europe ( mostly hungary ) . 
  [ this makes me ineligible to donate . 
  ] ( http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/eligibility-requirements/eligibility-criteria-alphabetical-listing#arc5 ), 
   there is no test for vcjd in humans that could be used to screen blood donors and to protect the blood supply . 
  this means that blood programs must take special precautions to keep vcjd out of the blood supply by avoiding collections from those who have been where this disease is found . 
  no , blood from europe is just not banned in europe . 
  the usa can afford to ban europeans from giving blood , since we represent a small minority of its population , but for europe , it would be impractically paranoid . 
  see for example the guidelines for giving blood in the website of the [ hungarian red cross . 
  ] ( http://www.veradas.hu/a-veradasrol/ki-adhat-vert ) it says that 1800 people donate daily , and you can bet they 're all hungarians . 
  edit : ( click the `` english version '' button in the bottom left corner ), 
  all minions in all games of hearthstone , forever ? 
  the power level of this is nearly blood manos-tier . 
  actually , i just realized , andorra is n't on that list . 
  so , all of europe , minus andorra ( and the state of vatican city , but everyone who lives there would be ineligible for physiological reasons as well , i think ) . 
  variant creutzfeldt-jacob disease, 
  considering deadly shot is 3 mana , and 5-mana explosive shot is a 1-of in control hunter because of its cost , this is only viable at 4 mana . 
  maybe change the effect to `` shuffle a copy of this into your deck '' so that you ca n't pull off stupid wombocombos with it . 
  6 mana , trigger knife juggler twice . 
  there 's a lot of muslims in india , though , which is kind of an important thing to some people . 
  sorry , you 're right , but the turn-to-turn reusability is still too strong for ( what for hunter is ) a large removal . 
  the strongest `` infinite removal '' currently in the game is mind shatter , and that only deals 3 , and requires you to draw both copies of a card . 
  ( alternatively , steamweedle sniper + justicar trueheart for hunter , but that 's temporary and kind of terrible . ), 
  i do n't think nerfing the mana cost would solve any problems with the card , anyway ; it would just create additional ones . 
  what is it about windows that makes it slow down over time ? 
  i 've never experienced this on linux , but it happens to every one of my windows installs . 
  i try to remove bloat , and i try to defrag disk drives , but it never helps . 
  it happens to me , and i 'm very conservative about installing anything on windows ( and know malware when i see it , thanks ) . 
  whereas on linux , i 've probably got thousands of packages installed by now , if not tens of thousands , and it runs like a charm . 
  jeeeez , two guys with funny slogans on their clothing , and both read `` make * xyz * great again '' . 
  i wonder how long we 'll be stuck with this meme . 
  i hope not , that would be tiring . 
  wait , yerevan is a holy site for copts ? 
  how come ? 
  oh , i guess that makes sense . 
  strange to lump them together , though , but yeah , that 's been a thing in eu4 since forever . 
  the editing in this video is superb . 
  watching this video was more exciting than watching the animation this song was originally featured in . 
  to be fair , the guy 's name is probably pronounced something like [ p\u026a\u03c7n\u0254s ] ( based on [ the phonology section of the wikipedia article for nuxalk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuxalk_language#phonology ) ) , which is pretty bad ass, 
  ~ ~ no , those are n't even clams , they 're barnacles . 
  these are clams with siphons . 
  every clam has some manner of siphon , and some clams are large , so they have large siphons . ~ ~, 
  edit : apologies , i forgot that `` geoduck '' is n't just another name for [ gooseneck barnacles . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goose_barnacle ) geoduck are indeed clams . 
  dunno if those are it though ; they do n't have to be . 
  a lot of clams have large siphons . 
  also the philippines , france , italy, 
   you can not hit anything you couldnt theoretically already target, 
  technically false . 
  you can hit stealthed enemy minions . 
  more like , you * can * hit any enemy . 
  also , the bagger 288 is just one vehicle in a family of bucket wheel excavators , which all share certain world records for size . 
  for example , specifically the record for the tallest land vehicle is held jointly by the bagger 288 and the bagger 293 . 
  bear is for fite ? 
  or people who * are * irrational germophobes !, 
  why would you touch the part of the door that the most people use , when you could touch the part that less people use ? 
  i was on the other end of this . 
  at the shadows over innistrad prerelease , i got two avacyns and a sigarda , and a pile of very decent drafting cards . 
  it was , however , my first time playing magic , so i never won a single game . 
  how i wish i could do it over . 
  it thought the last two words were `` gets it '' , and i was waiting for the flower to rebel in some way a la / r/firstworldanarchists . 
  it should be noted , slavic languages have either / g / or / h / in native words but not both , and they correspond to each other . 
  in russian you 'll have '' \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e '' while in czech you 'll have `` mnoho '' . 
  ( russian also had / g /  / v / in certain places , but they 're still written with \u0433 , so you can tell where they were . ), 
  i see no reason for loanwords to have / g / rather than / x / , though . 
  the latter is strictly more similar ; while / g / is close to / h / in placement , / x / is equally close in placement and also shares method of articulation and voicing with / h / , which / g / does n't . 
  when russian speakers who ca n't pronounce / h / speak english , they substitute it with / x / , so at least that makes sense . 
  maybe the loanwords thing was by analogy with how cognates in other slavic languages work ? 
  but that 's not usually how loanwords work . 
  my bet is that there was some sort of planning/prescription behind this . 
  does anyone who know about the history of russian care to comment ? 
  your kidneys and liver make sure there 's the right amount of stuff in your blood , do n't worry . 
  that sounds like something a person who did n't natively have / x / would say . 
  i natively have both / x / and / g / and neither seems to take less effort than the other . 
  but byzantine purple is tyrian purple-ish . 
  it 's almost magenta . 
  ( why do people hate that emoticon so much ? 
  it 's the only regularly-used emoticon out there that also consistently gets downvotes on reddit . 
  i see nothing wrong with it ; the face/emotion that it corresponds to is common and does n't have an alternative emoticon associated with it . ), 
  wait , so what actually happened here ? 
  - you , 1 : pass, 
  - them , 1 : coin ship 's cannon, 
  - you , 2 : guy ?
