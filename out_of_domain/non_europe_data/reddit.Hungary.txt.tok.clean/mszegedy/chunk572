  huh ? 
  would n't it be ( 1/3 ) ^ ( 30 ) ? 
  that comes out to one in 205\u00a0891\u00a0132\u00a0094 649 , which is 205 trillion or so . 
  oh , man , i did n't even consider the implication that the infiltrates get activated immediately when they come into play . 
  the way wump is worded , it sounds like wump deals the damage , not the yeti that comes into play . 
  way more power this way . 
  ( although he probably still is n't viable yet . ), 
  [ `` it 's a fricken noodle !,

  too true . 
  that 's why i 've progressed from feln control to feln-stonescar control ( grixis control ? ) . 
  too many damn times , my opponent has some kind of big weapon and i ca n't throw burn at face . 
  also , with smuggler 's stash you can have a second go at using last word , or another heal-for-five with staff of stories or umbren reaper ( if you run it ) . 
  same . 
  it 's one of the small things i appreciated about hearthstone as well , that not only did they reprint it ( as much as they could ) but they also called it the same . 
  i mean , it 's * readable , * but what if you want to make a minor change to this , such as making it work for more/less arguments ? 
  the mayan languages are a primary language family with a lot of branches and languages . 
  that said , most pre-colonial mayan texts were written in a literary language we call classical maya , based on a mayan language called ch ` olti ' . 
  ch ` olti ' itself is dead , but its close relative ch ` orti ' , and slightly less close relatives chontal and ch ` ol , survive ( with a very minimal base of speakers ) . 
  yucatec mayan , the most widely-spoken mayan language , is also relatively close among the mayan languages to the extinct ch ` olti ' , and most researchers who decipher mayan texts base their analysis on a working knowledge of yucatec ( and knowledge of regular sound correspondences between yucatec and ch ` olti ' ) . 
  what other important things are there ? 
  i remember that some stuff that used to produce lists or something now produces generators , and i think they got rid of one of the functional programming bits ( either ` map ` or ` reduce ` , or maybe something else ) . 
  that 's an alright comparison . 
  modern ch ` orti ' has a lot of new sound changes and a large stratum of romance loanwords , neither of which ch ` olti ' had . 
  modern english has a lot of new sound changes and a large stratum of romance loanwords , neither of which old english had . 
  but there 's a key difference in that ch ` orti ' is n't descended from ch ` olti ' , they just share a recent common ancestor , whereas english is descended from old english . 
  so genetically , the relationship is more like the relationship between modern frisian and old english . 
  another decent comparison is any modern romance language vs classical latin . 
  classical latin has no surviving descendants ( apart from church latin , which is a liturgical language rather than something people actually speak ) ; every modern romance language is descended from vulgar latin , which was spoken alongside classical latin by the common people . 
  but the relationship between classical maya and ch ` orti 's ancestor that was contemporary with it is n't quite the same as the relationship between classical latin and vulgar latin , since classical latin was the prestige and literary dialect of the commonly-spoken vulgar latin , while classical maya was the prestige and literary dialect of the commonly-spoken ( classic ) ch ` olti ' , which was n't the same thing as the ancestor of ch ` orti ' ( although it was close ) . 
  in fact , ch ` olti ' survived well into the 17th century at least alongside ch ` orti ' , although it 's understandably poorly attested after the spanish showed up . 
  we have exactly one post-colonial attestation of it , the 92-page mor\u00e1n manuscript , written sometime before 1695 . 
  it was written in spanish to give a brief overview of the history , language , and customs of the ch ` olti ' people , and contains several ( mostly religious ) spanish sentences translated into ch ` olti ' , and a short spanish-ch ` olti ' dictionary in the back . 
  francisco mor\u00e1n was n't a native speaker of ch ` olti ' , and so was n't very good at transcribing it , but it 's much better than nothing , and we can mostly fill in the gaps he left . 
  finally someone posts it . 
  yeah , weiner conceived this exact situation, 
  none of which appear to be part of present-day hungary ... that one in the east and the one way in the north are obvious , then the one below nitra seems to be pozsony ( part of modern slovakia ) , and the pair in the south seem to be vojvodina ( part of modern serbia ) . 
  that ungrateful piece of malware . 
  install overwatch to scare it into behaving !, 
  and if someone 's opposed to the idea of msg in their food , i typically substitute it with fish sauce . 
  it 's such a versatile addition , and it contains sodium and glutamate anyway . 
  i. . . do n't think i know anyone who refuses to eat msg but would eat doritos ... 
  small , red , translucent . 
  tastes terrible . 
  if you live in the northeastern us , or eastern canada , you 've got these . 
  wow , i thought he was n't speaking english up until this point . 
  still ca n't hear `` secret agent , coming through '' in what he 's saying unless i try really hard , but damn . 
  it 's the only one i was able to do !, 
  c'thun priest with tournament medic and the guy who buffs your c'thun if you heal something are essentials . 
  also , you can run brann and emperor , so late into the orc matchup when you have total board control , you can drop emperor for two ticks , and then brann + c'thun once you kill the orc . 
  also , jade druid or c'thun druid might be able to do it nowadays . 
  the united states has aldi ? 
  i 've never seen one, 
  wait , what neutral weapon did karazhan give us ? 
  wow , did n't even realize that was a card, 
  it 's trash , but you almost would n't figure it from the card . 
  on paper , it 's like a 4-mana or 5-mana flamestrike or elemental destruction when combo 'd with a whirlwind effect , which warrior has a few of . 
  science is n't about * why , * it 's about * why not !,

  i ca n't not see it . 
  got ta try real hard to see rays, 
  how in the hell did that evolve ? 
  they 're mammals !, 
  thanks , that was informative !, 
  so , tl ; dr , y translocated onto x ? 
  that 's fascinating . 
  i forgot about terezi and thought op was hyperbolically talking about jane . 
  ( i mean , what did op expect , using cyan text like that ? ), 
  she wears glasses you chump , that 's `` blind '' if you 're trying to insult someone !, 
  one of these is not like the others :\\, 
  or until you read the title of this fucking thread, 
  this is why i love time decks . 
  when you finally kill your opponent , you do n't just kill him , you completely obliterate his life total and scar him for the rest of his life . 
  you lethal him with , like , five games ' worth of lethal . 
  or , hell , even ~ ~ suprasegmental ~ ~ phrasal tone . 
  when 's the last time you 've seen a conlanger post an analysis of the various tone melodies found in their language for different kinds of sentences ? 
  tone is often overlooked . 
  edit : a word, 
   jumbo zippered dive log, 
  how dare you , they 're great !, 
  much prefer it to just letting the flimsy piece of crap float around and get smooshed . 
  america 's first orange president ... ? 
   suprasegmental, 
  oops , sorry , i guess i meant phrasal . 
  somehow misremembered `` suprasegmental '' as referring to `` larger than a syllable '' . 
  so that 's the country this is supposed to be . 
  the futuristic architecture made me think symmetra is responsible , so it must be india , but then i saw the arabic letters and thought , `` pakistan then i guess ... ? '', 
  egypt makes a hundred times as much sense . 
  ( also you definitely already know this , but ftr , egyptian is n't much of a language anymore ), 
  this is the best form of this meme i 've seen probably, 
  elsewhere in the thread they 're saying it 's in iraq ? 
  or possibly it 's dubai ? 
  either way it 's somewhere in the arab world . 
  still remember the name of the guy who wrote the epic multi-part tifu where he 's a wealthy brogrammer working for tesla motors and his wife is cheating on him ? 
  who has n't played tony yet , anyway, 
  probably a quote from * 20k leagues * ? 
  not that i remember it ever being in that book, 
  edit : actually , `` filled with acid and crude oil '' definitely did n't occur in that book , so i have no freaking idea .
