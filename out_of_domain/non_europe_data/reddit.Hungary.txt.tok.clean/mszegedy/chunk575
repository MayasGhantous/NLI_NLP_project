  although , coincidentally , `` vo '' does look like an n. 
  this is the letter vo : \u0578, 
  this is the letter n : n, 
  how does one make animated pixel art with so many different parts cycling at once ? 
  i once tried to make a pixel art animation representation of dna replication , but i never finished it because it took so damn long to make all the frames , because the various parts of the animation took different amounts of frames to cycle , and the finished animation would have to have as many frames as the lowest common multiple of all the cycle lengths ( which was some ridiculous number in the hundreds or thousands ) . 
  there 's got ta be some sort of software out there that makes it all easy . 
  what about sylvanas , though ? 
  she can possess people , so you can choose any body to have sex with . 
  that 's based on sea cucumbers , which spit their whitish , sticky [ respiratory organs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuvierian_tubules ) out as a form of self defense . 
  ( echinoderms in general are fans of ... externalizing ... their organs . 
  starfish turn their stomachs inside out to eat . ), 
  i mean , sure , it 's kinda hard , but it 's hardly as impressive as , say , putting a new satellite in orbit of kerbin . 
  but why would anyone do it in the first place ? 
  jeans are n't cold weather gear , and surely nobody would bring non-cold weather gear skiing without knowing it 's a bad idea . 
  where 's the original ? 
  it sounded decent, 
  did you run earth shock or something to counter their own weasels , though ? 
  ftm surgical procedures are garbage is one reason , unless you include pre-ops in which case it 's a pretty even split, 
  also , that would make two dragons who have a highlander requirement ( the other being kazakus ) . 
  i 'm not sure if it would be run . 
  it 's not like controlock needs more draw . 
  edit : zoo might run it ? 
  the earth would n't be able to chemically interact normally with the inside of your mouth on account of being too small , so it might not taste like much . 
  ( i do n't wan na think about nanoscale earth dust sloshing around the inside of my mouth , yuck . ), 
  but it would definitely be very hot . 
  well , the real reason is because it would be way unbalanced if an entire class could be perfectly countered with one card . 
  ( i mean , i guess people would go back to playing as thrall . ), 
  but in-universe , i guess morgl is too smart/powerful to be vulnerable to crabs . 
  jaraxxus is powerful , but so is sacrificial pact versus demons . 
  yeah , but morgl is a hundred times more vulnerable than jaraxxus . 
  sac pact is only able to obtained by rng , by only a handful of classes ( four out of eight classes can obtain it from a single non-yogg card ) , and you 're only jaraxxus for an average six turns or so . 
  hungry crab is a neutral card , and morgl is morgl for the entire game , unless he becomes jaraxxus i guess . 
  hungry crab plus would push morgl out of the meta if he were the only shaman hero , but since thrall exists , all the interaction would do is make people switch back to thrall . 
  the `` meaning '' of a word is how people use it . 
  if most people who speak english use a word a certain way , and you use it a different way , then all you 're accomplishing is not being able to communicate with most people who speak english . 
  `` caucasian '' is still used to describe the region in the context of geography , ethnography , etc. , but in other contexts it is used it is used to mean '' ( racially ) white '' . 
  you can tell people that they should n't use it that way because you want it to keep only meaning the geographical term , maybe because you do n't like it when people start using a word in a way they were n't using it before , but the process has been going on for all of human history and probably wo n't stop for you , so why bother ? 
  so , all words have always had the same meaning ? 
  uh ... [ good luck with that ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semantic_change ), 
  but , wait , i do n't think i understand your position then . 
  is n't your whole argument that words ' meanings do n't change over time ? 
  because ... they do . 
  all the time . 
  and that 's all i 'm saying . 
  wait , `` artificial collagen '' is nearly an oxymoron . 
  this is very interesting . 
  how are these casings made ? 
  well , in the usa , if you have spent a certain amount of time anywhere overseas ( exact length depends on the region ) , you are no longer eligible to donate blood . 
  they 're remarkably picky . 
  / u/voorface said halfway * through season 1 * . 
  that 's six or seven episodes , depending on how you round . 
  it 's still a relatively large time investment , though . 
  i was almost certain he died in the 80s . 
  turns out that that was brezhnev . 
  mind = blown . 
   and then he goes on to talk about how he 's a `` night owl '' . 
  the thing is , that 's likely artificial , a result of years of staying up far too late doing things he enjoyed . 
  the end result is that , yeah , he works better at night , but * most humans generally do n't . 
  i know plenty of `` night owls , '' and am one myself . 
  do we not deserve accommodation , just for being a ( large ) minority ? 
  morays do n't live in creeks , though . 
  well , if you 're trying to keep a secret , you should act in the same way you 'd act if the secret did n't exist , since anything that happens differently from normal if the secret exists is evidence for the secret . 
  elliot would be mostly cool with people accusing him of being a girl even if he did n't have the secret , so he should act cool with it now that he 's trying to keep it . 
  but you ca n't really expect elliot to think about it so much . 
  his strategy is also alright , but it hinges on people either not being able to predict his behavior ( aka not knowing him very well ) or people not being able to infer stuff properly from evidence . 
  thankfully , dan shive hates misunderstanding as a source of conflict , so maybe that will be avoided . 
  `` they 're eating ~ ~ her ~ ~ him !, 
  and then they 're gon na eat meee !!! '', 
  very nice . 
  what is it ? 
  i mean , the thing with the holes in it sure is a breadboard . 
  but what about the wires , ic , and display ? 
  clearly , it 's meant to be doing something . 
  it 's how zach weiner depicts a universe . 
  it 's a torus . 
  eh , any impression that tedd gets of elliot not being cool with people turning into girls would rely on him interpreting elliot 's attitude as genuine , rather than as a fake cover . 
  this is one of those bits of drama that could be just sidestepped if elliot took five seconds to explain to tedd that he 's doing it to deflect attention , and i do n't think dan would allow that kind of drama to happen . 
  but there 's still potential for drama even if tedd knows elliot 's faking it . 
  he might start feeling as though elliot 's fake attitude reflects a real , prevailing attitude among other people , which would still make him very sad . 
  but yeah , we 'll find out by the end of the week where this is going . 
  / r/cephalopods is your home, 
  in which dan shive accidentally reveals that he is british/japanese, 
  then the united states can be like warhammer 40k . 
  the legendary god-emperor rules over everyone from a distant planet . 
  unfortunately i doubt trump would go anywhere where there 's a twelve minute delay on tweets . 
  same . 
  hunter is my only golden class , entirely because of ynl . 
  playing l&l and a bunch of thaurissan-discounted spells is a 10x better feeling than plopping down gadgetzan in rogue or druid and drawing your whole deck in one turn . 
  conversely , playing more than one cheap spell a turn without l&l makes you feel 10x worse as ynl hunter than prepping something without gadgetzan as rogue does . 
  arcane shot is a strictly better holy smite , because it 's got that cool little reticle . 
  \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 : `` holy immortal '' ( literally , `` holy without-death-adj '' ), 
  \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0443\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0441 : `` lord , have mercy '' ( literally , `` have_mercy_on us '' ), 
  it 's how the thrice holy hymn is sung in old church slavonic . 
  ( google translate does n't know ocs , which is probably why you did n't get very far with it . ), 
  it 's so beautiful, 
  mind if i roll neeeeeeeeeed ?? 
  they 're glyphs we write with . 
  that 's a little different from being a toy franchise . 
  edit : wait , you were being sarcastic , nvm, 
  or , you know , roll need on all the trees,
