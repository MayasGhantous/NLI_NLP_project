  or summoning a 1/1 copy of a minion from your deck instead of the actual thing . 
  keep in mind that full value costs 12 mana , if you decide to pay the flare . 
  but yeah , this is on a similar power level to cotw . 
  pretentious as hell ? 
  come on , it 's just a thorough explanation , where 's the pretentiousness ? 
  it 's written * less * fomally and verbosely than a paper on the subject , which is basically all the practice anyone gets writing about this kinda stuff . 
  ( the `` sugar dissolving faster in hot water '' thing is probably the reason he said '' * partially * incorrect '' , but it coulda benefited from being said out loud , i admit . ), 
  top guy 's right , though . 
  sugar will eventually dissolve in cold tea , but it takes way too long . 
  the fact that the iced tea is served with the sugar on the side is a disgrace to the vast majority of people who prefer the tea sweet . 
  that would be a really cool gimmick, 
  you know what i find weird and inconsistent about the last word ? 
  the rule has been stated as , `` if your relic weapon has a property , then all your spells have that property has well . '', 
  hence , deadly lightning storm , deadly vara 's favor , etc. 
  but then the weapon 's ultimate says , `` make the last word deadly to players . '', 
  according to the rule that distributes your weapon 's property to your spells , this should make your spells deadly to players as well . 
  but if you ult your last word and vara 's favor your opponent 's face , they do n't die . 
  what 's up with that ? 
  ( you could argue that it specifically only works for keywords , but `` deadly to players '' sounds like a version of `` deadly '' . ), 
  nope , not even if it 's ulted . 
  which is really weird , imo . 
  budget ancient harbinger , lol, 
  if you see the animation of whatever it is hitting their face , then it can be blocked by aegising their face . 
  i 've azindel 's gifted an aegis exactly once . 
  no , i mean if the animation * normally * hits their face , then you can expect it to be stopped by an aegis . 
  subvert specifically has a little purple wisp hitting their face , and pops a face aegis if there is one . 
  i 've never played spell swipe , so i do n't know what the animation is like , but i 'm willing to bet it involves something hitting the opponent 's face . 
  following this heuristic , the only time you should n't be able to figure out whether an effect is stopped by a face aegis is if you do n't know or remember what it looks like , maybe because you 've never played it before . 
  but most effects that do n't target a minion target the opponent instead . 
  or with a hyphen , like in most austronesian languages : `` sing-sing '', 
  ah , yes . 
  now that 's just inconsistent . 
  edit : although , to be fair , never in a million years would you expect that to be an effect applied to a face , rather than individual minions . 
  but the animation is just inconsistent with how animations normally work . 
  feln would be much more consistent with weaker tutors for small cards , yeah . 
  for example , a 3-cost or 4-cost card that can draw you lightning storm would n't go unappreciated . 
  i 'd say that feln has several decent wincons to choose from . 
  azindel 's gift + last word is a very secure wincon that kills slower decks dead . 
  snowcrush animist kills faster decks dead . 
  scourge of frosthome kills burn and control . 
  you run two of these , and you kill everyone . 
  ( touch of the umbren is also a funny tech versus stonescar burn . 
  you can play it on their umbren reaper for massive damage and life gain . ), 
  4x harsh rule , 4x withering witch . 
  delicious full board clear . 
  you can also mix and match languages , although for maximum compatibility you should only use those that can be typed using the letter keys on a qwerty keyboard . 
  fuckin ' miracle , dude . 
  i do n't wan na pretend i know more about ccg design than wotc , but * why * did anyone think it 'd be a fun mechanic ? 
  it just makes topdecks feel twice as bad . 
  it 'd have to be non-rhotic , for a start . 
  then the first vowel is `` ah '' in both cases . 
  edit : i can see it . 
  if you have trouble hearing the `` s '' at the beginning and the `` ng '' at the end , then it 's `` tahp yellih '' . 
  `` t '' sounds like `` d '' , and `` p '' sounds like `` k '' . 
  `` ah '' is the same as `` ar '' if your dialect of english is non-rhotic . 
  and there 's only one english word that starts with `` yell '' and ends in a vowel , which is `` yellow '' . 
  ( `` ing '' might even sound like two vowels , in the same way that `` ow '' is two vowels ; `` i '' is the first one , and `` ng '' sounds like a second one . 
  in my first language , hungarian , `` ng '' actually became a vowel in many different words a long time ago ; for example , very long ago , there was the word `` wangeew '' , which meant `` nephew '' . 
  from it , we have the modern stem `` vey - '' , meaning `` son-in-law '' . 
  [ note that spellings are english-ified here ; the stems would be written as `` w\u00e4ngiw '' and `` vej - '' respectively normally ] ) . 
  the least convincing bit here is not being able to hear the `` s '' in `` st '' . 
  who does that ? 
  i thought the dude on the left was her mom . 
  it was pretty confusing, 
  i added a guy after a cool control mirror , and together we spent 15 minutes figuring out what the hell happens if your deck runs out . 
  it was brilliant . 
  if you run out of cards , at the end of your turn , you lose the game . 
   it 's, 
  that 's brilliant , i think you may be right . 
  fantastic video ; really enjoyable to watch . 
  as someone who played yogg 'n' load to legend this past summer , though , i 'm a little disappointed he never mentioned it in the control hunter bit . 
  he specifically said that hunter lacked two things that control decks needed : board clears , and healing . 
  i would add card draw to this list . 
  yogg did all of these things ( although not so much healing ) , which is a huge reason why ynl could eke out its meager existence . 
  it 's kinda funny ; despite how many good things came to control hunter in wotog , the deck still sucked . 
  call of the wild could be used as a fairly strong win condition , although it was n't very helpful in control matchups , where it could often be answered with a board clear . \\* lock n load could be used as pseudo card draw , and yogg could be used as actual card draw , not to mention as a full board clear ( ish ; it was kind of unreliable ) . 
  the only problem was that its removal was slow , inflexible , and overcosted . 
  combine that with a complete lack of healing , and you have a very inconsistent deck on your hands that relies on drawing a few key cards in the right order to beat you on value . 
  ( and also relies on getting pressure cards off of lnl in slower matchups . ), 
  and of course , then the three strongest cards in ynl were nerfed , in a deck that was already hanging by just a thread , and it was ash . 
  * ^ ( it was lucky that the only two kinds of control decks popular on the ladder were warrior and druid . 
  warrior 's board clear left a minion alive , usually , and druid just did n't have any board clears to begin with . 
  renolock was also slightly a thing , but their problem was that their health was typically so low after you cotwed them , that they were worried about getting kill commanded to death if they cleared , so they would play reno instead of clearing . 
  i was able to take many wins off of renolocks , even with the very limited and easily clearable pressure present in ynl , just because they were unfamiliar with the matchup and played it too conservatively . ), 
  ah , you are the one who made the video !, 
  your attentiveness to this thread is greatly appreciated . 
  as one who missed out on the huntertaker meta , i look forward to the hunter history video . 
  unfortunately , i do n't think i have much to contribute to the discord server . 
  ynl is all i know , hah . 
  also , if you defender of argus it , then you have a really cheap 1/9 taunt . 
  it seems only fair that it has some downside . 
  ( discovering inner fire for this from kabal courier is devastating . 
  this would have been good about a year ago ( maybe a little further back ) . 
  but undercosted , overstatted minions that do n't otherwise do anything board-wise fell out of the tempo meta exactly when shaman stopped running 4 mana 7/7 . 
  turns out , there 's more broken cards out there . 
  you even know a finnish meme !, 
  great going !, 
  ^ ( you do n't tell me what to do !, 
  in all seriousness , i 'd clarify `` hard '' means `` difficult '' , as opposed to `` clearly-defined '' here . 
  edit : thx,
