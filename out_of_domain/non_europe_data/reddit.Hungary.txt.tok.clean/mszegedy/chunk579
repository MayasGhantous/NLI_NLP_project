  i think it may be too dangerous , but there 's probably a metagame where this could see play . 
  i did n't say it makes it not overpowered . 
  but it does make a difference . 
  well , that 's part of the reason why this is n't a card . 
  the only color of deck that ca n't answer it at fast speed is mono justice , but even that runs flying units in the form of valkyrie enforcers , which can be preemptively put down as blockers . 
  here are the best/most common fast ways to answer it for each color :, 
  ** fire : ** torch ( or the rarely-run temper ), 
  ** time : ** scorpion wasp, 
  ** primal : ** lightning strike , levitate on a blocker, 
  ** shadow : ** deathstrike ( note that , assuming you are running it , preemptive azindel 's gift is a much more efficient solution ), 
   kingdom of god, 
   gives empire rank, 
  oh shit , you 're right . 
  and it sure would n't make sense for a dragon trainer to be a dragon . 
  but how did you not immediately figure out that it was unplayable ? 
  a googol to the power of 60 , more or less, 
  oh yeah , that 's a good idea , thanks !, 
  yeah , i looked for it to put in the deck , but found only flash freeze . 
  sad day . 
  ( assuming you mean sabotage ) what would you take out to put it in ? 
  eh , one ie language versus another , what 's the difference ? 
  the idea is to stall for a turn or two until i drop stray into darkness on them . 
  the problem with bloodcaster and lightning storm is that they remove the units in such a way that they can be brought back , i.e. 
  conventionally . 
  having more opportunities to deactivate haunting scream and dark return is generally better ( and funnier ) , since that 's what they 're not expecting . 
  that said , you 're probably still right about it improving winrate . 
  i just do n't like it so much , because if the only three cards you play the whole game are three copies of lightning storm , they 'll just think you were feln control with a good draw . 
  yes , but overkill is funny, 
  i mean , that one at least makes sense, 
  aha , i get it , because the two smallest primes for which nearly nobody knows the divisibility tests are 7 and 13 . 
  but it 's 3 less than 60 !, 
  no , something that prevents the opponent from applying an effect to their creature . 
  like / u/sharuumium said , teleport is the closest thing to this currently . 
  heyy , they finally made a `` deathrattle : put this card in your hand and it gets bigger '' card !, 
  it 's even a phoenix and a mage card !, 
  it took me over a minute to find out where the 2th is . 
  ( it 's the big black text in the gray box . 
  `` development diary february 22th '' . ), 
  the problem is , it needs to survive a turn for you to death it . 
  protip : if you only run one kalis , you ca n't draw multiple of it !, 
  ( but seriously , running both multiple kalises and scraptanks is excessive ), 
  or you can just run ruin , decay , and , to a lesser extent , furnace mage . 
  then curve out . 
  my praxis deck easily destroyed him . 
  i deleted the deck , so i 'm not sure if i 'm remembering this right , but i tested it out and still crushed him . 
  the idea is to hard mulligan for ruin or decay , remove his first few minions with torch , then once the board is clear drop your minions and get the warcry gravy train going . 
  ( note : this deck is better with any of the seats and maybe some of the sigils replaced with praxis banners , but i did n't want to spend the shiftstone to craft them . ), 
  ( also note : i ran exactly as many charchain flails and flame blasts as i had in my collection . 
  if you have more , run them and take out something expensive and useless , like decay . 
  if you have less , replace them with something else that hits hard , like obliterate , or a big , undercosted time minion . 
  or more scorpion wasps , or even more swords of icaria . ), 
  edit : oh , man , i forgot , finest hour is definitely a card you want to run in this deck . 
  -2 seek power -2 decay +4 finest hour is a good deal . 
  sorry , that 's what i meant . 
  the only secure way is majordomo  death  amara , but that 's a 17 mana combo . 
  even ancestor 's call  death  amara ( inconsistent and requires a wild shaman card ) requires 12 mana . 
  something something can play a role in the modulation of something via regulation of something something . 
   mattis as secdef and his replacement for flynn being the others, 
  what about killing the trans-pacific partnership ? 
  but , but , a population count of 1 does n't literally represent one person , more like ten !, 
  so actually the number of natives is ... 0 \u00d7 10 ... oh ... 
  yes , unless he meant * eternal sunshine of the spotless mind * , where instead of the sun it 's a grill, 
  but we do n't know the position of each grain in the hourglass , whereas we know the position of every gear in the wristwatch . 
  counting single grains of sand as distinct parts is like counting single molecules as distinct parts . 
  ( which movements we can and ca n't track is actually thermodynamically meaningful . 
  that 's the difference between sound , which can be turned into work , and heat , which ca n't ; both are vibrations of molecules , but one is ordered and able to be tracked and one is unordered and unable to be tracked . 
  also , sound will turn into heat if you let it disperse far enough , but you ca n't turn thermal vibrations into sound , i.e. 
  make them ordered , unless you commit some energy . 
  ( note that heat * difference * is something that * can * be turned into work , but that 's not what i 'm talking about here . ) ), 
  usually not . 
  pops in vic ii , for example , are commonly understood to represent a nuclear family , i.e. 
  four people . 
  i dunno the actual conversion rate for eu4 natives , but there 's no way it 's 1:1 . 
   people like cards similar to babbling book because they do n't put as much pressure on you and there is still a lot to work with in that space . 
  nah , they like them because they are positive and generous , and can be played for practically nothing . 
  it 's a million times preferable to undertaker or small-time buccaneer, 
  i want to like casino mage , but there 's so much degeneracy in the fact that a large amount of the deck 's power comes from comboing flamewaker with spare parts , tempo mage-style . 
  it just does n't feel good to watch flamewaker pulverize the opponent 's board . 
  ah , brm-era casino mage was annoyingly similar to tempo mage . 
  spare parts cards and piloted shredder were both technically random effects , so you were justified in running them , as well as of course flamewaker . 
  the result was the same disgusting turns tempo mage could pull , where you played flamewaker and like three spare parts in one turn , for a healthy 6 random damage and a 2/4 ( or 3/4 , 2/5 , 3/5 , etc ) . 
  at least you could n't run i wan na be just like you . 
  the nice thing is , nowadays spare parts synergize with yogg , so they have a unique synergy with the deck ( in addition to the annoying one from tempo mage ) . 
  rocks : pretty universal , it turns out, 
  charlie has `` gardened '' recently . 
  presumably it 's some sort of virtual substitute ? 
  or he did n't follow through on the deal , or there was a loophole ( we were never shown the exact wording of that part ) . 
  crystalline solids , in any case, 
   without patches would n't see nearly as much success . 
  toast 's patches video has winrates well under 50 % for every pirate deck on the condition that they draw patches , so without patches the archetype may not even be viable . 
  ( of course , drawing patches in a meta where other decks have patches is significantly worse than playing a pirate deck without patches in a meta where nobody else has patches either , but they 're still fairly comparable ), 
  in a ccg where a deck is only 30 cards and does n't run any lands , it feels * really * bad having your cards taken . 
   every card starts as a common, 
  except for the 4 rares . 
  that 's a clever way of getting around having to wait for a sausage to ferment to get its insides acidic enough to kill bacteria . 
  just use your own stomach acid instead !, 
  have any humans tried this ? 
  bananas originate from borneo , where there are many , many different varieties of a large number of shapes , tastes , sizes , and colors . 
   utd, 
  unleash the dogs ?
