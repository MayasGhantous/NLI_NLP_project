  it 's me . 
  wait , the clouds move west !, 
  [ i dunno , i was able to diagram it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/syebf.jpg ), 
  karkat and his ancestor would have been [ lime blood ] ( / lime ) , which is around a quarter ways up the hemospectrum . 
  he is by no means the lowest blood color .

  the other 10 % is updates and fanart . 
  it looks like my hair . 
  try leaving the quotes in . 
  the upside of silver is that it 's less difficult to produce than steel . 
  it 's also better for serrated disks . 
  i downvoted you because this is n't true if the reason for downvoting is self-evident . 
  which , if there is a significant presence of downvotes , can only be one thing for a particular post . 
  you should definitely post this to / r/classicalmusic . 
  because creepers used to be teh failed model for pigs !, 
  seed plz, 
  lol 69 karma so upset to upvote, 
  i do n't think he 's an asshole , but i do dislike him a lot and completely succeed at hating xkcd . 
  sorry , meant to say `` would have had '' . 
  this does n't make red the lowest color . 
  it does n't make it a quarter of the way up , either , i guess , but my point still stands . 
  i dunno , for me it 's usually the opposite . 
  the traders are more than happy to unload their entire fucking caravan for a few bars of gold , or a wooden artifact or something . 
  i do n't even need their shit , i just buy it 'cause i can . 
  he 's included only in name , though . 
  why does someone got ta do it ? 
  i am fine with you voicing your opinions , no matter how unpopular they might be . 
  in fact , i encourage it !, 
  if you * want * to have your thoughts be heard , by all means , do ; it 's much better than censoring it . 
  but if it is only because you feel it 's your * duty * , then do n't : it 's not . 
  no one is specifically * requesting * that they hear demeaning opinions . 
  if you do n't have a good reason , we 'd all rather you keep it to yourself . 
  but seriously , yes . 
  it is . 
  not going to freak out over it again . 
  ah good then . 
  yeah , i do suppose the people here do need and deserve a little inustion . 
  uh , inurement . 
  whatever . 
  it 's important to recognize the diversity of opinions ; reddit is a good place to do it . 
  not true , it stole my goddamn cell phone the other day !, 
  there 's a map for that , if you leave off `` to scale '' . 
  exactly !, 
  play the seed `` literally hitler '' . 
  it 's quite exhilarating . 
  complaining about it ? 
  also overdone . 
  [ it was on a day or two ago . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/tk6ch/build_awesome_spawn_city_i_made_for_a_server/ ), 
  i assumed it was only because of the selection box from mousing over it . 
  it still looks to me as though if he moved his mouse , it would be whole ... 
  nice !, 
  i love it when redstoners use colored wool . 
  one question though , why a hole in the void and not just lava ? 
  i like it !, 
  but dafuq is that thing in the very top-right corner of the chest ? 
  in fact , it 's a karma-whoring joke * about a karma-whoring joke * . 
  i can feel your mind getting blown all the way over here . 
  in fact , it reads on my seismometer . 
  not in practicality . 
  i thought he was undressing for a different reason . 
  the last panel confirmed my suspicions until i got here . 
  bye , i am off to have alboneurosurgery .

  edit : woops , meant to reply to the comment you replied to , not you . 
  eh , whatever . 
  it helps if you audiate the words , since `` allowed '' and `` aloud '' are almost perfect homophones ( except `` allowed '' technically has a long [ l  ) . 
  i 've seen this particular variation so many times that i thought nothing of it , but i can only imagine how brain-wrenching it must be for you !, 
  how come ? 
  about noah 's ark : do n't worry , it did n't have to be * every * species : apparently , there were `` about fifty '' different dinosaurs on board to account for every different kind . 
  according to the creation museum . 
  oh , i thought that was just because perspective ? 
  would n't they be able to fix that ? 
  in 40 years ? 
  they look stupid * now * . 
  which one ? 
  can not unsee . 
  i like it better this way . 
  heh , i have yet to receive mine , but following that they will go on everything . 
  almostnever must have had a bit of a laugh , as i live in a us town called hillsborough , as well . 
  just a different state . 
  ( i understand that you leave off the `` ugh '' . 
  to people here , that kind of spelling seems needlessly newfangled ; what does my spelling seem like to you ? ),

  i know . 
  thanks !, 
  silver penetrates armor better , and if a serrated disk hits armor it ca n't penetrate , all of its damage is converted into much less effective blunt damage . 
  qed , use silver . 
  also , the a1 session * was * a null session . 
  i love how the keyboard is german . 
  should replace the sh with an eszett , though !, 
  for more numbers , or do they encode a string of letters ? 
  they do n't follow the pattern of any string of numbers that i know , at least . 
  i feel at this point it would be prudent to mention that godwin 's law . 
  ... what ?
