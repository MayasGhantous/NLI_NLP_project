  they 've got plenty of italian cultural tradition there . 
  has there * ever * been a relevant/important post-chapter comic ? 
  ( apart from mort fun time , obviously ), 
  are ... are those two things similar ? 
  or that violin one, 
  although , renolock was pretty low-tier until msog, 
  like wrathion, 
  wait , i have seen this a lot in america . 
  what exactly is `` breakfast for dinner '' and what 's great about it ? 
  i am not sure if i 've ever thought at 8 pm , `` i could sure eat some scrambled eggs right now . '', 
  he draws ... weasel tunneler ? 
  and even wrathion barely sees play . 
  spending 2 mana to draw is n't so bad , though ; having a button that does it is considered the best thing about the warlock class . 
  * blook you , will grook you, 
  `` blook '' is one of the few hozen words we know . 
  it means `` kill '' . 
  well , there 's a lot of mountains there . 
  what i mean is , he was making the point that 6 mana for 4/5 taunt and a draw is better value than 2 mana draw . 
  i do n't think 2 mana to draw is too shabby , however . 
  it 's doomhammer 's keyword, 
  while a spell that gets lands is a `` land fetch '', 
  yeah , kripp did a video on it after the latest charge nerf hit . 
  what , are you kidding ? 
  it 's run in every control warrior . 
  it 's godly . 
  5 mana 2/7 , battlecry : drown in armor . 
  it 's some meme deck streamers like to play on twitch, 
  wait , was its name actually invented as pes\u00e4 + pallo ( or bo + ballo ) and the fact that the first half sounds like `` base '' is a coincidence , or is it an english loan that happens to sound like two existing words ? 
  or was it invented to be a pun ? 
  that 's really weird, 
  if you want him to actually get around to letting you die , at * least * 10.000 forints #justhungarianthings, 
  well , except `` pes\u00e4 '' is `` nest '' , and the swedish cognate is also `` nestball '' . 
  so what i 'm asking is , what was the thought process behind the name ? 
  was `` pes\u00e4 '' picked to start it purely because it sounds like `` base '' , or purely because the guy who named it wanted to name it after nests , or a combination of both ( a pun ) ? 
  `` pes\u00e4 '' is one of the few finnish words i know , on account of it having a hungarian cognate in `` f\u00e9szek '' , so i 'd appreciate it if someone 'd humor me here . 
  if you want to get into the detailed physics of it , i found leimkuhler and matthews 's 2015 text `` molecular dynamics '' a wonderful treatment of the subject . 
  it 's [ available on libgen , ] ( http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=184b60613985acbc52cfc2d9cacd6efb ) and it covers everything from various approximations of the physics , to integration techniques specific to the field , to error analysis and conservation of energy , to thermostats and barostats , to stochastic methods , and more . 
  it 's a little unnecessarily detailed in the math , imo -- i find that a lot of the proofs and derivations i learned from the book ultimately do n't bear too much relevance to actually building a simulator , but one can always just skip them , and they 're really nice to have around in case you want to do some fiddling with the math of your own . 
  the book does n't specifically cover proteins , but it 's completely applicable , and gives you a very firm grasp of the `` world '' of molecular dynamics simulations . 
  on the other hand , if you really like being disappointed , you can read basically any modern paper on protein dynamics , and discover that it 's really popular to use horrifyingly `` coarse-grained '' methods to get a general idea of a possible structure for a protein , rather than just straight-up fold it . 
  there 's geometric models , pure elastic-network models , markov models , neural nets ... there 's a whole lot of ways to bypass actually having to fold a protein using real physics . 
  as someone who needs a lot of accuracy in his protein structures , it makes me sad that most of the folding methods floating around are n't relevant to me , but i ca n't deny their usefulness for investigative stuff . 
  if you want to get a glimpse of what kind of programs are out there , there 's again [ on libgen ] ( http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=e96e605557bae4494b756ce39faa6ec2 ) a compilation of papers from 2014 where several labs write very basic introductions to what they worked on ( and how to use their program or replicate their experiment ) . 
  you wo n't learn too much about implementation details from it -- for that , you want to look at individual papers . 
  but it gets you a good sense of the field as it looked in 2014 , and it has n't changed drastically since then . 
  that 's a really weird-lookin fox, 
  really . 
  it 's an easy fix to the format , too :, 
  - events for people without a y chromosome, 
  - events for people with a y chromosome, 
  no discussion of gender needed . 
  screw that , tear out the pages and shove them down their throat . 
  eventually they 'll suffocate . 
  this is the best option . 
  sorry , i know coarse-grained methods are really useful and that my distaste for them is irrational . 
  it 's just that having to resort to very unphysical models for * a priori * structure prediction feels bad , since our models only behave like proteins in the most abstract of senses . 
  it 's part of why i 'm trying to write my own composite algorithms , to see if this kinda stuff ca n't be optimized by integrating information from multiple levels of abstraction . 
  i now realize that an md textbook may not have been the most relevant recommendation for protein folding . 
  it has its place , though , and is useful in other respects , such as studying reaction dynamics . 
  what 's the reference , again ? 
  the disjoint option seems lazier , but the simplicity of `` battlecry : gain all adapts '' is so attractive that they might go out of their way to implement that . 
  well , `` biologically speaking '' they do n't get to pick their adaptations , the poor bastards . 
  ( but maybe kaleidosaur biology is different ? ), 
  the moat lurker synergy !,

  5 mana 4/4 , battlecry : put 5 secrets from your deck into play . 
  eh just anything that has been frozen is n't quite good enough . 
  you want it colder than the temperature of your typical freezer , at -20 - something \u00b0 c. 
  the longer you freeze it for , the more sure you can be the bacteria are dead . 
  `` notice how the ` a ' in ` bat ' is lower pitched than in ` pat ' ... '', 
  there 's a specific gene for beta amyloid ? 
  what ? 
  i know , but `` amyloid '' is n't a specific protein . 
  any protein can take on amyloid structure , a big beta sheet spiral , if it decides to , and the tendency of proteins to do this if you leave them lying around long enough is one of the best reasons to clean them up . 
  you do n't even really need one fiber to consist of the same kind of protein ; it 's purely secondary structure-based . 
  ( the configuration is generally very energetically favorable , from what i 've read , which makes sense since every base gets to hydrogen bond to another base . ), 
  the formation of amyloid is the accepted mechanism of action of prions , which are really just a very stable amyloid form of an existing protein , and which encourage correctly folded forms of that protein to bind to the amyloid and extend it , just by virtue of being around and being sticky . 
  i always thought beta amyloid was just random proteins not getting cleaned up , not a specific protein that liked to form amyloid fibers . 
  guess not . 
  do we know what the protein is supposed to do when it 's not forming amyloid and killing brain cells ? 
  ( also , actually not much dna is protein coding . 
  most of the dna that matters codes for regulatory sequences , or occasionally for structurally useful rnas like rrnas , trnas , sirnas , etc. 
  i know what you mean though , and the 1 % of dna that does code for proteins is definitely some of the most important dna there is , although i 'd put the rrna-coding dna ahead of it . ), 
  edit : huh . 
  according to wikipedia , amyloid beta peptides do n't do much , although they 're made on purpose . 
  however , amyloid precursor protein , the protein cleaved to make amyloid beta peptides , is `` ancient and highly conserved '' , and is involved in synaptic formation , among other things . 
  yeah , writing it up , i knew it was n't particularly good , but memes . 
  what about golden tome , 5 mana 7/7 taunt , battlecry : replace your hand and deck with mage secrets ? 
  i mean , that 's also bad because you do n't have a wincon , but on the plus side , they probably wo n't ever be able to remove it , on account of endless counterspells/spellbenders/effigies / duplicates . 
  to be fair , regardless of quality content , kripp 's video titles really are almost always a superlative . 
  it 's always the `` most insane x ever '' , `` worst x ever '' , or something . 
  like , the shtick just does n't really work anymore when your channel has hundreds of videos on it . 
  it just makes it sound overhyped . 
  i really like his more original titles , like `` the cursed spectate '' and such . 
  tbf , mind control is a common . 
  lots of priests have it . 
  but yeah ... 
  this is such a good card . 
  it 's like a powercreeped mad scientist , although he did put the secret into play immediately . 
  whoah , did n't mean to offend anyone , it 's not a big deal .
