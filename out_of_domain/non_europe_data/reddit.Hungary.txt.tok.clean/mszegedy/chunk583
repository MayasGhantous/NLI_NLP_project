  just an observation i made . 
  i think one can complain about his titles while he puts out so much quality content because the titles and the content are ... different things ? 
  again , it 's not important . 
  the 3/30 statistic is interesting . 
  youtube i think recommends the superlative-titled ones to me at least as often as the non-superlative-titled ones . 
  maybe those do better ? 
  i dunno about the superlative titles being fitting . 
  taking the most recent example , we 've all seen our share of bonkers arena decks , and 8-board-clear priest with two legendaries is certainly crazy , but it 's hard to justify calling it the craziest arena deck * ever . 
  * i mean , kripp probably gets sniped weekly by decks just as good . 
  that 's kinda the problem with superlative titles , they 're generally subjective , and it 's pretty easy to find competing examples . 
  but , deathrattle and one less health . 
  how relevant is the cheating effect , really ? 
  new jersey inverted the color scheme , so they have at least that going for them ? 
  the biggest problem with it is the inconsistent baseline . 
  the way none of the letters are aligned makes reading large amounts of comic sans really unpleasant . 
  a local restaurant where i used to live uses a version of comic sans for their menu , where someone fixed the baseline to be consistent . 
  it looks really , really nice . 
  gahz ` rilla + bouncing blade ( + commanding shout ) ? 
  you could get it off of grimestreet informant . 
  unless the brawl is standard-only . 
  i know about comic neue , and i 've spent a lot of time wondering if it is , but whenever i 'm there i always forget to do a direct comparison . 
  key is i * used to * live there ; now i live on the other side of the continent . 
  the restaurant is [ mamoun 's falafel in new brunswick . 
  ] ( http://mamouns.com/locations#new_brunswick_nj ) unfortunately , none of the pictures in that slideshow show the large sign on the back wall with their menu on it . 
  ( yeah , they have two menus , directly facing each other . 
  they put the second , comic sans-y one up one or two years ago , after i moved away . 
  maybe they 've gotten rid of the one over the counter by now . ), 
  there 's actually [ a picture ] ( https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/onp6cmguo3yzscssozhjzw/348s.jpg ) of it on the web , although it 's apparently from the princeton one ; the small text is the pseudo-comic sans . 
  sorry , i really wish there were a way to verify it further . 
  edit : hold your phone , i found a picture where it 's actually visible !, 
  ] ( http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/3/4/a/highres_263981802.jpeg ) look at how even the sizes of those letters are . 
  it looks so nice . 
  hmmm , that 's not totally convincing . 
  who lived there who would have called it that ? 
  proto-uralic through proto-finno-permic ( if there ever was such a thing ) have \\* kolmv for three and \\* kota for `` village/settlement '' , neither of which would get loaned the way they appear in the name ( \\* kolmv almost , but why \u0445 rather than \u043a ? 
  analogy with the russian word ? ) . 
  and then once it turns into the permic languages , their reflex for \\* kota is `` ku '' or something , which resembles \u0433\u043e\u0440\u044b even less . 
  was it loaned from karelian or a sami language or something ? 
  they might have something that sounds like that . 
  edit : wikipedia has this to say about it :, 
   the name is derived from the finnish kalmom\u00e4ki for `` corpse hill '' ( `` cemetery '' ) . 
  apparently it 's \u0445\u043e\u043b\u043c\u043e instead of \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043c\u043e on account of a sound change that occured in russian after the word was loaned . 
  kind of a weird way to loan a word , but sure . 
  os x 's monospace is pretty bland , i agree . 
  imo the novelty of the cs being `` fixed '' in the menu is what elevates it to being aesthetically pleasing . 
  it 's just so cool to be able to look at cs and not have your eyes hurt . 
  well , that 's just straight from \\* kolmv for `` three '' and \\* maa for `` land '' , and is literally how you 'd say it in finnish . 
  but see my edit . 
  [ it 's supposed to be . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tone_ ( linguistics \\ ) #origin ), 
  second paragraph :, 
   in a nontonal language , voiced consonants commonly cause following vowels to be pronounced at a lower pitch than other consonants . 
  that is usually a minor phonetic detail of voicing . 
  however , if consonant voicing is subsequently lost , that incidental pitch difference may be left over to carry the distinction that the voicing had carried and thus becomes meaningful ( phonemic ) . 
  that happened in punjabi : the punjabi murmured ( voiced aspirate ) consonants have disappeared and left tone in their wake . 
  if the murmured consonant was at the beginning of a word , it left behind a low tone ; at the end , it left behind a high tone . 
  if there was no such consonant , the pitch was unaffected ; however , the unaffected words are limited in pitch and did not interfere with the low and high tones . 
  that produced a tone of its own , mid tone . 
  the historical connection is so regular that punjabi is still written as if it had murmured consonants , and tone is not marked . 
  the written consonants tell the reader which tone to use . 
  does n't talk about english specifically . 
  not sure if i 'd trust an observation made in isolation ; it 's easy to overthink these things . 
  but it 's possible that english is exempt from this effect for some reason . 
  welp here we go, 
  unplayable , deactivates quickshot / s, 
  they 're all arginines, 
  it 's not the etymology of the name `` berlin '' , but it * is * probably the origin of the coat of arms . 
  [ canting arms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canting_arms ) are a whole thing . 
  but it already has ch -- oh . 
  it 's very possible it was a mono-time deck . 
  but also , it can be difficult to judge whether a hand is below average compared to a post-mulligan hand . 
  your opponent probably looked at the hand and thought , `` well , it 's a bad hand , but i guess you ca n't be too picky about these things . 
  hopefully i draw into more power . '', 
  and then they did n't draw into more power . 
  maybe the sort of inhabitants that build houses on the ceiling are also the sort who do n't need roads ? 
  imagine grom + blood to ichor + this . 
  three cards , 15 damage . 
  wheee, 
  reminds me of jace , the mind sculptor , one of the most balanced mtg cards to ever get printed, 
  eh , compared to babbling book , which sees play , it 's about as strong . 
  it 's fine . 
  is n't it a little greedy to run so many big minions ? 
  breath , breathe , although the vowel changes as well, 
  conversely again , it 's always really weird to see two very similar phonemes and think `` oh these ca n't possibly contrast in any language . 
  nope , wait , they contrast in serbo-croatian/kukuya/moldavian romanian/whatever , jesus christ . '', 
  grom is 8 mana , and i 'm considering the hypothetical where this card is 1 mana . 
  that 's true , i guess you could theoretically run so many in astro druid . 
  but there were definitely a lot of people upset about it at the time . 
  and look how nice it looks now !, 
  ah yes , but what if i suck at telling apart red from green and yellow ? 
  tom has helped me then !, 
  2 mana spell : muster for snakes ? 
  the wording was infected by mtg , possibly . 
  it 's not double the babbling book effect . 
  this puts the spells into your deck , rather than your hand . 
  that 's worth almost nothing . 
  often less than nothing , because it denies you a two draws for a card that was actually good enough to put in your deck , and gives you some other mediocre cards instead ( although these are mage spells , which generally have high-ish card quality ) . 
  on average , though , it 's probably a net positive . 
   top 3 most powerful sets ever released, 
  so what * are * those sets ?
