  gvg , loe , and msog ? 
  or maybe naxx instead of loe . 
  edit : wait a minute , naxx had undertaker , mad scientist , * and * avenge . 
  dunno , i 've heard `` antimeme '' used to describe ideas that compel someone * not * to share them , versus a meme , which is an idea that does compel someone to share it ( or at least that 's what the word meant until the early 2000s ; nowadays its meaning is closer to `` internet joke '' ) . 
  that usage of `` antimeme '' makes more sense , at least to my ears which are used to the 20th century usage of `` meme '' . 
  minions are like ... a backwards meme ? 
  but still a meme . 
  wait , sjow is his * favorite ? 
  * has this guy never seen * hook * ? 
  as soon as you said `` gadgetzan '' , i could already hear the sax theme, 
  pioneered there by one of my favorite sci-fi authors , sam hughes . 
  the term was invented/popularized by internet sci-fi author sam hughes ( website [ here ] ( http://qntm.org ) , scp wiki author page [ here ] ( http://www.scp-wiki.net/qntm-s-author-page ) ) . 
  given that a meme is an idea that makes people want to share it , an antimeme is then an idea that makes people want to not share it . 
  in the real world , this includes any secret , anything that people do n't like to think about and especially do n't like to talk about , ideas that are so good or so dangerous that you want to keep them to yourself , codes , passwords , credit card numbers , etc. 
  in hughes 's science fiction , however , he writes about much stronger antimemes ; [ objects ] ( http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-055 ) where you do n't remember what they are if you 're not looking at them , [ creatures ] ( http://www.scp-wiki.net/we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five ) where you do n't notice them existing even if they 're in plain sight , [ creatures ] ( http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2256 ) where any recorded information about them eventually degrades , that kind of stuff . 
  he also writes about [ weaponizing ] ( https://qntm.org/science ) this sort of thing ( scroll down to `` ghosts '' ) ; turning someone or something into an antimeme , erasing them from everyone 's perception forever . 
  ( this one is sort of actually [ possible ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/damnatio_memoriae ) to [ do  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nonperson ) stalin , for example , famously `` un-personed '' his enemies . ), 
  he really likes his memory-based sci-fi concepts , hughes . 
  i know you were probably looking for nonfiction stuff , but there 's very little about antimemes . 
  the concept of antimemes as a whole has n't spread very far beyond the scp wiki . 
  mostly , serious people write about memes . 
  the field of studying memes is [ `` memetics '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/memetics ) , and a decent overview is [ * the meme machine * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_meme_machine ) by susan blackmoore . 
  nobody wants to know about your whole life , so yes . 
  that 's a forbidden apm technique , i do n't think most players are at that skill level, 
  you 're supposed to do it like this :, 
  but if it has no attack , it does n't kill stuff . 
  you 'd need defender of argus . 
  i 'm tempted to say this is overpowered , because it 'll almost surely be undercosted for its statline , but we live in a world where shaman has a 0 mana 5/5 taunt and warrior has a 0 mana 3/3 taunt . 
  so iunno . 
  wait , the belyayev kind of domesticated fox ? 
  ~ ~ ( the only truly domesticated kind ? 
  ) ~ ~ those things are * rare . 
  * are n't they supposed to have floppy ears ? 
  edit : huh , elsewhere in this thread , [ someone linked ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/623hth/a_white_domesticated_fox/dfjogut/ ) to a [ blog article ] ( http://theartfulfox.tumblr.com/post/61131776543/russian-domesticated-foxes-myths-uncovered ) pointing out that at this point , bred , tame foxes from breeders other than belyayev 's institute are n't actually much different from belyayev 's foxes . 
  very interesting . 
  huh , that 's a really interesting article on belyayev-type domesticated foxes . 
  the only bullet point i do n't get is the `` genetic differences '' one . 
  how would you quantify that ? 
  if you sequenced the entire genome of each fox , you 're liable to find forty differences just in the coding parts between two individuals of the * same breed * , never mind two different subspecies . 
  edit : also , that point about floppy ears being a `` genetic defect due to inbreeding '' : that describes literally every trait acquired from selective breeding , and floppy ears in particular tend to show up when you selectively breed animals for tameness . 
  so , it * is * a sign that a fox has undergone some amount of domestication . 
  however , to be fair to the article , its point seems to be that floppy ears are far from guaranteeing that a fox will be completely docile and domesticated . 
  but , then , since floppy ears * are * reliably connected to many of the sorts of changes you want in domesticated animals ( such as smaller limbic systems ) , presumably due to some obscure pleiotropy , does n't that kinda make even that claim dishonest ? 
  the gist of the idea it 's supposed to refute is basically correct , it 's just that maybe sometimes people take the conclusion too far and expect floppy-eared foxes to be perfect angels compared to non-floppy-eared foxes . 
  that 's a fair criticism . 
  to be honest , i do n't think it 's actually really relevant to the author 's point whether they understand the scientific discoveries made by the belyayev experiment . 
  the overall claim they were making was that the floppy ears on the belyayev foxes are n't the ultimate indicator that they are a completely domesticated , house-ready breed , which is n't wrong , and its truth does n't depend on the role the floppy ears played in belyayev 's findings . 
  the problem is , the author * does * also unnecessarily make a claim that makes it sound like floppy ears do n't correlate with how much domestication a breed has undergone , and that 's the part where they 're wrong . 
  if they 'd just said something like , `` floppy ears are an early side effect of the domestication process and do n't mean that belyayev foxes are much more domesticated than other selectively bred varieties , '' the issue could have been sidestepped altogether . 
  well , my definition of `` truly '' domesticated has a very low bar . 
  they just need to have been selectively bred for several generations until the typical phenotypes associated with domestication arose . 
  i thought the belyayev experiment was the only time that someone did that to foxes , but turns out modern fox breeders have also done pretty much the same thing , and it does n't improve quality of life for a fox owner very much . 
  of course , but it makes you wonder whether the reason we do n't have foxes that are as domesticated as dogs is that they ca n't get that domesticated . 
  lots of countries have done orthographical reform , but what makes hungary truly great is our commitment to * vocabulary * reform . 
  what is the etymology of `` higany '' , for example ? 
  let 's see [ what wiktionary has to say  ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/higany ), 
   created by p\u00e1l bug\u00e1t during the hungarian language reform which took place in the 18th -- 19th centuries . 
  it 's got a * name * attached to it . 
  a * specific person * went and came up with it . 
  we have bug\u00e1t p\u00e1l to thank for the fact that we do n't have to pronounce `` hydrargyrum/h \u00fcdrarg\u00fcrum '' , and this will be immortalized in our etymology dictionaries forever . 
  way to go , p\u00e1l !, 
  specifically ukraine, 
  does n't malta speak arabic , uh i mean `` maltese '' ? 
  and probably italian , i dunno . 
  this is cultural, 
  and wallachia 's such a shitrectangle , too , it would fit perfectly into this picture, 
  i 'd probably think , `` what a shit mondrian imitation ; you 're not supposed to have so many colored parts touching in such a big blob . '', 
   gon na need to brew a whole new deck for azindel, 
  what about `` esper '' control , i.e. 
  feln control splashing find the way , desert wasp , and lumen defender ? 
  ( and sometimes decay ? ), 
  `` esper '' control has available to it mana sinks in the form of :, 
  - last word , which can sink as much as 20 mana ( play + activate + backlash ) or even 25 mana ( play + activate + backlash + lightning storm/crystallize ) \\*, 
  - feln bloodcaster as a 10 mana card , plus maybe you want to do other stuff that turn such as play the cards you drew, 
  - azindel 's gift, 
  - copper conduit, 
  - channel the tempest ( but who plays it ? ), 
  - touch of the umbren , i guess ( it beats umbren reaper , anyway ), 
  - leaving up extra mana for deathstrike , annihilate , backlash , wisdom, 
  it 's also possible to set up two pairs of echoed second sights with excavate and that one primal card that gives the top spell of your deck echo in order to draw as many cards as your mana can handle , but that combo is just not worth it to run in any deck . 
  \\* possibly my favorite moment of eternal i 've had so far is a control mirror where i was playing sjp control . 
  my opponent played scourge of frosthome , and i stalled for about five turns with chump blocks , while my opponent kept extending onto the board with harbingers and other big units , and i just kept topdecking sigils . 
  i was down to my last health point and ran out of blockers , and i thought all hope had been lost . 
  however , i drew into last word , which allowed me to kill scourge , and , because of the 14 + mana i had accumulated , play harsh rule the same turn to save the game . 
  i went on to win the game the next turn . 
  it was beautiful . 
  edit : me dumb , word does n't give harbinger deadly, 
  edit 2 : footnote, 
  yeah , but who wants a deck name as boring as `` stp control '' ? 
  what 's it saying ? 
   nb-ir . t-\u02e4nkh b-\u010d-d `` shape '' . det-qd, 
   ( some more stuff ), 
  anyone who studied egyptian wan na comment on whether they make any sense ? 
  right ? 
  all the best ones are in combrei . 
  - a new tomorrow, 
  - siraf, 
  - marshal ironthorn as a 20-drop, 
  quick , complain about steward of the past, 
  what is echovate , and how did echo decks get nerfed ?
