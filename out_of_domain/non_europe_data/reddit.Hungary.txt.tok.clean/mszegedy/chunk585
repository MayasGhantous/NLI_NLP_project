  edit : ah wait , echo excavate , gotcha yeah, 
  no fair , i really enjoy playing against armory , even if it 's a bad matchup for my main deck , sjp control . 
  there 's a lot of interesting back-and-forth , and i get to steal stuff with bloodcaster . 
  oh yeah i remember , true enough . 
  thanks for the writeup !, 
  char siu pork can be made without it ; you just have to mix up a complicated marinade with honey , hoisin sauce , soy sauce , shaoxing wine , five spice powder , etc. 
  wait , i expected something shaped like a bread roll , not something shaped like a brick . 
  what 's the backstory ? 
  not to humans , but best of luck, 
  now druid has a way to go infinite and beat fatigue !, 
  pretty sure they mean fondant, 
  well , if they want to , good luck to them . 
  unfortunately i think you 're right . 
  it 's okay , infinite 9 mana 9/7s are probably too powerful to give to druid anyway . 
  reduced deck slots to 9, 
  that 's the frequentist formula . 
  yeah , although i still do n't really understand the ending . 
  paul kim was a physical manifestation of 3125 , and wheeler blew up the bomb in his face , thereby saving the world ? 
  or was there no 3125 in the first place , just paul , and belief in 3125 is a side effect of paul 's memetic powers ? 
  or was paul just another person infected by 3125 , meaning that blowing up the bomb did basically nothing other than erase site 41 , and that the world is still completely doomed ? 
  why would blowing up the bomb in not-paul 's face do anything useful , unless he were a memetic anomaly small enough to completely fit within the range of the bomb ? 
  and if that 's the case , is 3125 not real , or not a problem ? 
  was paul ever a real person ? 
  ambiguous endings have their place in fiction , but i feel like i was supposed to get some kind of closure from that ending . 
  steward of the past created a strategy that revolved around trying to counter void decks in one turn without requiring any cards on the board . 
  fighting for board control and battles between different archetypes make an overall game of eternal more fun and compelling , but having your entire deck countered by one card is not particularly fun or interactive . 
  heyyy , homebrewed a spj control deck and it runs all these cards !, 
  never homebrewed a deck before , so i 'm really prouda myself . 
  except in warlock . 
  would you rather get warlock spells ? 
  wait a minute , i 've heard this story . 
  the big site was furaffinity , right ? 
  did n't they also have problems with stability or something ? 
  like , they 're both the biggest furry site on the internet , but also somehow of low repute . 
  what happened to make everyone distrust them ? 
  maybe they meant nato ? 
  no , i mean furries themselves make lists like `` list of alternatives to furaffinity '' . 
  probably android mobile , it does n't show up on that platform as far as i 'm aware, 
  that 's what she said :(, 
  ahhh the good ole `` everybody 's passwords got stolen '' thing . 
  it 's hard to think of an example where it ended up hurting a website in the long run , tbh . 
  yahoo , maybe ? 
  people certainly still use adobe 's products , and their cloud model is more popular than ever , so * they 're * not an example . 
  so , isaac 's word `` deiform '' might actually have been a spell ? 
  although the wording of the spell sounds a little more dnd than erfworld , so maybe not . 
  but if it was n't a spell , why would he say it , and then subsequently wind up looking like a string-god ? 
  but clearly they wrote * themselves * out of history already . 
  florist . 
   dialect, 
  good word , but it 's actually a register, 
  it 's also possible he 's asking , `` why ( did this guy think there ) could n't have been a third rail ? '', 
  but the answer to that one is really straightforward ( `` he 's got eyes '' ) , so maybe not . 
  ~ ~ kiritimati/christmas island ? ~ ~ wrong way, 
  `` mfw '' was `` mfw '' long before 2011 . 
  as the other guy said , it 's a joke . 
  i 'd definitely rather use `` electro-rope '', 
  to be fair , my arch recovery media runs off of a ramdisk . 
  ah , reminds me of this markov model for rocket design i posted here a while ago : https://i.imgur.com/xecivv2.png, 
  the same thing happens on cooking forums . 
  `` i do n't have butter , is there a substitute i can use ? '', 
  `` hmm what if there were a card that exclusively punished umbren reaper ? '', 
   immfeiately, 
  ftfy, 
  it was drawn using a textured trackpad and gimp , but i * do * suck at aiming a pipet compared to my colleagues, 
  this was already after naxx came out , so the game was far from new . 
  guilty as charged , although technically what i do nowadays is `` quantitative biomedicine '', 
  i 'll ask the department to consider it , but we just renamed ourselves a year or two ago . 
  the shower at my parents ' place in new jersey is really , really simple . 
  you twist a dedicated knob to turn it on or off . 
  there is another dedicated knob for temperature . 
  wan na change the temperature ? 
  sorry , not gon na happen . 
  that temperature knob 's been stuck in that position since the early 2000s . 
  people who assume it 's a joke or heavily censored , i guess, 
  for example , miracle rogue . 
  its name comes from an mtg deck , miracle gro ( which itself was named after a brand of fertilizer in the usa ) , which would grow its minions to very large sizes over multiple turns . 
  original miracle rogue would conceal a questing adventurer for multiple turns ( this is before conceal got nerfed to only last for a turn ) , and grow it to a large size . 
  hence the pun on the mtg deck . 
  but then questing ended up not being the main point of the deck , and nowadays what survives of the deck is gadgetzan auctioneer . 
  so nowadays `` miracle '' in a deck means it has gadgetzan auctioneer in it . 
  sarcasm is a form of irony . 
  in english , we call it `` verbal irony . '', 
  ( in my native language of hungarian , we do n't even have a special word for it ; `` sarcasm '' is `` ir\u00f3nia '' , and `` sarcastic '' is `` ir\u00f3nikus '' . ), 
  `` qara '' meaning `` black '' is also the story behind the name of [ qara qoyunlu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kara_koyunlu ) , or the black sheep turkomans , who were a federation of oghuz turks who used to be the buffer state between the ottomans and persia . 
  aargh the page created some kind of popup of a scam on facebook , and i 'm in a reddit app 's browser on my phone , so it replaced the page with the comic entirely instead of opening in a new window . 
  zach whyyy, 
  specifically the [ top post of all time ] ( https://i.imgur.com/idcqkwy.mp4 ), 
  ca n't open the link rn , but i 'm guessing it 's [ san-nakji ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/san-nakji ) that octopus must be * really * tasty for people to risk death like that eating it . 
  ( also there 's the much-more-well-known fugu , and apparently it really does taste amazing . ), 
  yeah that 's the idea . 
  it kills one or two tourists a year , mostly drunk ones who suck at chewing ( notice the article says it 's often served with soju ) . 
  it 's not a popular dish by any means , but it exists and everything . 
  which illustration was that ? 
  not that i do n't believe you , just it sounds cool to see . 
  any reasonable implementation would just have a lookup table for every possible combination ( precomputed combinatorically ) . 
  i do n't think there 's that many . 
  let 's say there 's about 40 of each cost of card from 0 to 10 , right . 
  11 has 5 such partitions for two cards , 15 such partitions for three cards , and 26 such partitions for four cards . 
  that makes a total of 5 \\* 40 \\* 39 + 15 \\* 40 \\* 39 \\* 38 + 26 \\* 40 \\* 39 \\* 38 = 2.5 million combinations .
