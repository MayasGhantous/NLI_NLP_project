  say it takes 20 bytes to store a combination ( 4 bytes each for the index and each card , although you do n't really need the index ) , then that 's 50 million bytes , or 50 mb . 
  it 's a lot of mb for one card , but it 's insignificant compared to the multiple gb that hearthstone already is . 
  edit : forgot to add \\* 37 for the last term ; turns out it 's more like 58 million combinations . 
  that 's ... a bit too many . 
  like , with that shitty compression scheme i just mentioned , that makes the table 1.1 gb . 
  can someone get a more accurate calculation ? 
  i think with some cleverness it 's still feasiible . 
  edit 2 : to balance the 3 mana cost , you could restrict the card pool to only general cards , or general cards and rogue cards , or rogue cards , or non-rogue class cards , or cards from your opponent 's class ( blizzard 's favorite ) . 
  this dramatically reduces the size of the lookup table . 
  edit 3 : you can also partially compress the lookup tables by ignoring 0 mana cards and just generating their combinations from the possible combinations of one less card plus the 0 mana card . 
  the question , though , then becomes how the rng is implemented , but i 'm pretty sure that that can be done with phantom indices beyond the length of the table . 
   drawling, 
  wow , epenthetic l. never thought i 'd see that one in the wild ( or in standard ) . 
  either the number pi or silverback patriarch, 
  ^ ^ \\ ( or ^ ^ homestuck , ^ ^ or ^ ^ at ^ ^ least ^ ^ one ^ ^ other ^ ^ thing ^ ^ i ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ know ^ ^ of ), 
  good ol' tjp boardlock, 
  all * enemies . 
  * it does at least 10 face damage . 
  that 's often better than deathwing . 
  shitty phone number entry methods are / r/softwaregore 's biggest meme, 
  areal/cultural difference . 
  like how in central/eastern europe , we indicate numbers with our fingers by starting from the thumb , rather than starting from the index finger like in the usa . 
  ( this was a plot point in * inglourious basterds * , where an american spy was found out by the germans because he ordered three beers with his middle three fingers , not his thumb-side three fingers . ), 
  edit : [ apparently ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/643qgi/eminem_has_never_won_a_game_of_rock_paper/dfzlklo/ ) the spy was british , and he was ordering whisky , not beers . 
  so i guess now we know that the uk does it from their index finger as well . 
  i do know from personal experience , however , that the us likewise counts from their index finger . 
  edit 2 : australian commenter below says they count from the index finger in australia . 
  maybe that style is widespread in the english-speaking world ? 
  have you never seen a hearing person use their fingers to indicate numbers ? 
  maybe hunter, 
  are you sure it was whisky ? 
  i distictly remember him saying `` drei bieren '' , rathern `` drei gl\u00e4ser ( whisky ) '' or `` drei whiskys '' . 
  but you 're probably right and it 's not like it matters to the point , so anyway thank you !, 
  in the uk , then , counting is done from the index finger ? 
  it 's really weird how much the internet has done to affect my perception of the sauce . 
  when it first came up in the episode , i thought , `` well , i understand the nostalgia value , but there 's no way a mcdonald 's sauce could be even remotely as good as what i can make at home . 
  they probably just mix corn syrup with some spices and thickeners . '', 
  i had absolutely no desire to try it . 
  now that it 's been all over reddit for a week , i kinda wan na try it just for the hype . 
  i do n't even go to mcdonald 's . 
  but they did n't invent it , they had it all the same and had no clue where it came from , just like us !, 
  the rabbit hole never ends !, 
  i think americans do that too . 
  none of them are well-supported afaik . 
  i 'm a uralicist by hobby , and possibly the most common common proposal for outside groupings for ie is indo-uralic ( or often also indo-uralo-altaic ) . 
  everything i 've read in support of that is kind of garbage , considering that ie and uralic languages get * less * similar as you go further back in time . 
  pu did n't even have conjunctions , and had a wildly different phonology from pie . 
  ( as far as para-uralic hypotheses go , i have a soft spot for michael fortescue 's uralo-siberian hypothesis , which is supported fairly well by morphology and , to a degree , anthropology , but i 'll concede that the sound correspondences he proposes are n't very regular . ), 
  ( what 's with antihydrogen in the corner ? ), 
  but ... why antihydrogen ? 
  it seems really random . 
  we must be missing some context to this picture . 
  edit : [ found it , ] ( https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2013/05/01/measuring-the-effect-of-gravity-on-antimatter/ ) turns out they were measuring the effect of gravity on antimatter and it seems to be the same as the effect of gravity on regular matter . 
  so the reason it 's there is n't contrast at all , though it was a good guess given the ( lack of ) information, 
  it 's not so bad, 
  i think they meant it in the sense of `` almost as extensive '', 
  although i think that more refers to pouring champagne into the sink, 
  thematically it should be incremental . 
  if they play acolyte of pain , you get to be fatigue shaman . 
  adventurers get more hp . 
  commoners are the ones who have about 4 . 
  ah come on dude , everyone should think of themselves as a pc . 
  have you tried * not * being in control of your life ? 
  it sucks . 
  her voice line is epic and maybe my favorite in hearthstone . 
  i do n't think she will make it into the final meta , however . 
  a majority of the spells you draw off of her are straight-up useless , and also generally if the game has gotten to turn 7 for you to drop her with radiant and have a value turn , you 've already won anyway . 
  sweden is part of the eastern bloc since when ? 
  it 's too early to say whether it 'll make any of the decks in the solved meta , but it 's incredibly powerful in a vacuum . 
  i was expecting this ( or `` what kinda asshole puts mustard on a hot dog '' ) to be the top comment , not the sixth highest . 
  pleasantly disappointed . 
  not completely unrelated . 
  the sausage in a hot dog is pretty similar to viennese sausage , and one can be used as a substitute for the other ( although it 's not pleasant ) . 
  edit : wait , i was thinking of w\u00fcrstel / wirschli . 
  what the hell does schnitzel have to do with this ? 
  it 's been interesting to see the shift over time from ebonics to aavl to aave to aae . 
  i am not sure what to call it nowadays . 
  personally i do not like saying `` aae '' or `` aal '' out loud ; they are made entirely out of very similar vowels and approximants , which is hard to pronounce . 
  but neither do i want to use an older and less standard term . 
  and expanding any of the acronyms is just too long . 
  so then i am stuck with [ e\u026ae\u026a\u02c8i\u02d0 ] . 
  perhaps i should not be complaining , being the native speaker of a language where `` fiai\u00e9i '' is a word that sees regular usage . 
  i wonder what cards/characters people will miss next rotation . 
  n'zoth ? 
  not kazakus . 
  he effectively rotated out just now . 
  uh ... patches i guess ? 
  how old is this article ? 
  it was very informative . 
  is it really topdecking if it 's literally the last card in your deck ? 
  either way , nice game . 
  coulda been even sweeter if he 'd had 13 health . 
  tbh , `` to topdeck something '' basically means `` to draw something when you need it ( because it was on the top of your deck when you drew ) '' . 
  he did draw it exactly when he needed it , so his usage is totally spot on . 
  it 's just ... not so amazing , when it was the whole deck to begin with . 
  what i guess * is * amazing is that it was n't drawn earlier and discarded by deathwing . 
  so we 'd like to say something instead that means , `` to not draw something * until * you need it '' . 
  which is also good , but generally not implied by the term `` topdeck '' . 
  so we can say ... `` bottomdeck '' ? 
  generally that means that what you need is buried in your deck , but in this case that turned out to be a good thing , so i think that would be as good a term to use here , if not better .
