   similarly a rag that only hits minions would n't necessarily be better than the rag we have now , because sometimes face really is the place . 
  you almost always want ragnaros to hit minions , though . 
  it 's okay , i understood the reference , have an upvote, 
  those do n't typically have a translation , or have an `` officialest '' language to a degree that it 's mostly obvious what language their flag is supposed to represent . 
  an example of the former is basically any country in sub-saharan africa , and an example of the latter is india . 
  the most ambiguous case i can think of that actually occurs sometimes is south africa . 
  it 's presumably not english , since that 'd be represented by the british or american flag . 
  but is it afrikaans ? 
  or zulu ? 
  who 'd bother to translate their website into zulu when there nearly are n't any zulu monolinguals ? 
  it 's got ta be afrikaans ... oh , turns out it 's south african english . 
  who bothered with * that ? 
  * etc. 
   oh , it 's going to slowly evolve into a bunch of new languages ? 
  or does she think that people just stopped speaking latin ? 
  to be fair , people really did `` just stop speaking '' classical latin . 
  modern romance languages are from basolectal vulgar latin . 
  dunno , really slowly ? 
  ca n't take more time than prison for life . 
  oh , really , then whose country actually gets localizations on the sorts of websites that use flags to represent languages , and actually has multiple candidates for which language their flag could represent ? 
  i 've never seen a flag-based language selection tool that included a more obscure country than , i dunno , indonesia . 
  ( which * does * have a bazillion languages , but there 's no chance that their flag is n't there to represent bahasa indonesia . ), 
  the real loser here is most of africa ; they 'd actually be good candidates for being screwed over in this fashion , but nobody bothers to localize for them , except for competent places that write out language names . 
  do we have any record of friendly infiltrates triggering on the enemy 's turn ? 
  this seems more like a general rule that that ca n't happen . 
  poor france , he just wants to wipe all languages out besides metropolitan french . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  aww , but you do look so happy !, 
  to be fair , in the modern age of spacemacs , stuff is very discoverable, 
  learned english in central new jersey . 
  pronounce it [ s\u0258\u0303\u02d1s ] , occasionally [ s\u025b\u0303\u02d1s ] . 
  i think most people around that tri-state area have it as [ s\u025bns ~ s\u025b\u0279\u0303s ] , homophonous with `` sense '' . 
  ( note that / \u0279 / actually represents the alveolar approximant here , not / \u0279\u0320\u02b7 / . 
  what i 'm trying to get across with it is that it is like / n / , but the tongue does n't completely touch the alveolar ridge . ), 
  edit : just asked my housemate , who grew up in north jersey . 
  he says [ s\u026ans ] , and never [ s\u025bns ] ( `` that 's a different word '' ) . 
  i might import your mandolin slicer idea for hungarian potato gratin . 
  [ we make it with thick slices . 
  spherified whatever . 
  all you need sodium alignate , calcium lactate , some kind of mold , and enough time to freeze stuff . 
  then you can make mango juice spheres that look like egg yolks , or little bits of pop boba , or basically anything you can think of . 
  i like to do this to strong teas , and then put sugar on top or drizzle it with honey . 
   showing each ephemeral wisp coming into play ( really tedious when multiple are coming back ), 
  or the reverse , azindel 's gift discarding every single card in someone 's hand . 
  i mean , i like that it 's easy to see and process what was in my opponent 's hand , but it takes a while , and sometimes i do n't care , especially when it was full of power sigils . 
  maybe add the ability to click through animations , like in hearthstone ? 
  i am hungarian , but do not make paprik\u00e1s csirke often . 
  in theory , it varies only slightly from many dishes such as lecs\u00f3 and p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt , though ; it begins with frying onions and then peppers in a pot , but then you proceed to chicken and more peppers , then sour cream . 
  the details after the peppers phase are lost on me , though , so you should consult a hungarian recipe ( just google `` paprik\u00e1s csirke '' ; the first several results are legit , although one of them has you making galuska from scratch , which is kind of a waste of time if you can just buy it in a store ) . 
  it is generally served with galuska , a kind of egg noodle , so if you can find and boil some , then you are already halfway there . 
  ( neutrally-flavored rice , such as white rice of any kind , is an acceptable and delicious substitute . 
  you want it to soak up the sauce . ), 
  that 's not relevant for azindel 's gift , at least ; if you 're on the discarding side , it just shows all your cards getting dumped into the void at once . 
  but you 're right in general . 
  `` wow in the 5 and a half years since act 6 came out during which i have picked up homestuck-related paraphernalia like lint i have not once seen this chart '', 
  -- no one ever, 
  you can also just remember that aae is non-rhotic at the ends of words , so `` in some near '' is almost homophonous with `` insomnia '' . 
  this also opens up the possibility that this guy was using voice recognition , and that the voice recognition was listening for some kinda non-rhotic dialect of english . 
  ( like in rp , i think `` in some near '' and `` insomnia '' only differ in tonality ; they 're both [ \u026an.s\u0254m.ni\u0259 ] , maybe [ ni\u025c ] for `` near '' . ), 
  good job, 
  she read it 23 times . 
  then she read it another time and realized what it means . 
  your comment made me curious , so i looked up [ a map of skyscrapers worldwide . 
  ] ( http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/maps/ ) turns out baku is the only place in the caucasus to have skyscrapers , at least according to this map . 
  but this recipe is playing properly ... 
  pfft , but you can still clearly see that it 's a flounder . 
  nice try buddy but a 2-year-old has better hide-and-seek skills than you . 
  dude , nostalgia for * 2011 . 
  * that 's remarkable . 
  edit : chill out , certain repliers . 
  i said remarkable , not * wrong . 
  do n't forget off-by-one errors, 
  wait , actually ? 
  adopt : summon a 1/1 copy of something . 
  this works great for rephrasing certain existing cards , and has a lot of unexplored potential as a mechanic , e.g. 
  `` adopt all minions . 
  '' , `` discover and adopt a deathrattle minion . '', 
  you must be fun at parties , using the `` you must be fun at parties '' line like that . 
  0 seconds ? 
  i was n't saying they 're not allowed to feel nostalgia , just remarking on how 2011 seems like it happened so recently and yet it was such a different world for a lot of people . 
  remember , barnes too . 
  single father of 1 , poor guy . 
  no you 're right , it 's bullshit, 
  ... throw a 2 year old into a lake ? 
  if you threw the flounder into a lake , i do n't think you 'd ever find it . 
  unless it were a really , really small lake with very clear water . 
  i guess you could cheat and tag it . 
  i mean to be honest the kid would n't resurface either . 
  yeah . 
  the countries this does n't work for include ~ ~ the uk , ~ ~ switzerland , japan , palau , bangladesh ~ ~ ( for this and palau , technically it 's not the same if you turn it upside down , but you ca n't really tell unless you 're looking at it up close ) ~ ~ , austria , nigeria , peru ( unless it 's got the crest ) , scotland , england , jamaica , ~ ~ trinidad + tobago , panama , ~ ~ honduras ( ? 
  ) , and probably a bunch of others . 
  honestly , for a bunch of island nations , central america has a lot of rotationally symmetric flags . 
  i guess they do n't have this convention . 
  edit : people have pointed out below that flying a flag upside down has to be a vertical reflection , not a rotation by 180 \u00b0 . 
  this means that some of the flags i listed do work . 
  this , however , also means that flags such as the french and italian flag do n't work , which makes the comment i replied to wrong . 
  probably the first one . 
  plasma screens have n't got large enough pixel density to avoide moire patterns afaik, 
  ah that 's what i was missing . 
  using the two triggers on two different creatures .
