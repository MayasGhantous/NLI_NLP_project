  fuck yeah , time flair !, 
  also , who is the `` sgrubarrow '' ? 
  we all know `` hussiehead '' ... 
  philstatisticist ? 
  also , your name looks weird with the blue op bar . 
  [ be a rebel , like me !, 
  ] ( / r/firstworldanarchists ), 
  i have gotten a concussion this way . 
  it 's the only concussion i 've ever had , actually , and i also split my goddamn forehead right open . 
  i do not recommend it . 
  i know , right ? 
  it 's like , who the hell even are they ? 
  i ca n't find a single such person . 
  let 's never tell anyone what it actually said !, 
  ... wayta reply to me three times in one minute . 
  that 's like replying to me 4,320 times in one day . 
  to be fair , sometimes it 's rather hard to tell whether someone is working at a particular place or not . 
  it 's always the most embarrassing thing when you ask someone a store-specific question and they respond with , `` sorry , i do n't work here ! '', 
  so much humiliation ... :(, 
  it just means that you 've replied to me a lot . 
  and do n't be silly , no one hates you here !, 
  woosh, 
  did ... did you take a * photo * of your screen ? 
  last time i checked , it was something stupid like 49 % or something . 
  no , he is n't . 
  he just looked like he was on a tiny iphone screen with the brightness turned all the way down moments after i had woken up . 
  my mistake , sorry . 
  simile . 
  ah , makes sense . 
  cool then !, 
  i 'm on an iphone . 
  ( wait what ? ), 
  god dammit , accidentally submitted mine twice ( having forgotten that i had submitted it the first time ) . 
  why does n't this delete duplicates ? 
  now the canon is especially established !, 
  it 's a sgrub sign now !, 
  what now, 
  you 're welcome . 
  what font is that ? 
  it 's too good . 
  one is an egg , and the other is a cork from a bottle ( the bottle itself is seen in [ s ] wv : ascend and [ s ] enter ) . 
  they match the kids ' items that they got when they used their pre-punched cards . 
  also , you can claim pretty much * any * blocky object is shaped like a sack of flour . 
  right before your post was about to become unreachable !, 
  you should post this to / r/minecraft . 
  took me a while too, 
  [ generic post complaining about how this is shit and / r/minecraft has really gone downhill lately . ], 
  what the hell dude , this is pretty cool !, 
  i 'd never think to build something like a petrified tree . 
  he made the world in 1.7 , then upgraded as minecraft went along . 
  i 'm assuming this chunk was generated when it was still minecraft 1.7 . 
  infdev . 
  the front side has op on it . 
  the joker is implying that he is a `` creeper '' . 
  the second movement of beethoven 's seventh symphony , because it starts out ^ ^ ^ ^ so . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ damn . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ soft . 
  would n't that rather be dave ? 
  hopy shit, 
  this is horrifying . 
  yet , i still laughed at the sbahj quotes . 
  i thought of doing something like this after i noticed that many comics end with jeff creepily staring at bro for several panels , and then that the whole fucking comic is actually just jeff being a massive dick to bro . 
  but i was lazy . 
  and this turned out way better than i could have come up with anyway , thank god !, 
  i await more chapters . 
  i ca n't comprehend it either , but that 's because i 'm sleep deprived at a [ 5 ] right now, 
  do * you * remember that / r/minecraft post ? 
  because i do . 
  edit : what ? 
  it was an awesome post . 
  that 's really all there is to say on the matter . 
  you do n't just kill them outright ? 
  / r/all will love this . 
  i must watch it right now tomorrow . 
  - niel degrass tyson, 
  ~ ~ do n't upvote this only for teh jebz , there 's clearly leonardo decapreio in there too !, 
  and do n't think i spent days making this , because it was obviously closer to literally hitler . 
  what i actially did was recode the world generator so that every world is now generated out of this . 
  but it wo n't work on your computer because it only works for me . ~ ~, 
  upboats to the left !!!! 1 !, 
  edit : edited to be more concise and politically correct, 
  it took six pickaxes or sone shit to minne, 
  i meant , just set the army on them . 
  if a dwarf is insane , then they are selectable . 
  i am in every subreddit , especially homestuck, 
  have we had `` hallowed tombs defiled '' yet ? 
  ( and , well , the nobles session definitely involves tombs , so ... ), 
  slacker . 
  i can identify with being bad at watching tv . 
  especially considering that jake has a sacred urn ripe for toppling !, 
  [ check the panel in dirk 's flashback where the condesce takes over new york . 
  goddammit hussie i wanted to see what that ring did, 
  ( oh well , i do n't have to wait much longer i guess ), 
  like this ? 
  i love it !, 
  one question , who is that third from the left ? 
  and directly to the left of the dalek ? 
  ( under the shape-shifting flying creature whose name i ca n't remember but actually appeared in an episode with k9 ? ), 
  must have been with 10 . 
  on the other hand , it 's extremely hard to get any of them to undress for you .
