  sometimes they have thalnos . 
  handlock is n't really viable nowadays . 
  not that they have the 3/6 statline , but who could hear `` 5-mana taunt '' without remembering [ [ sludge belcher ] ] and [ [ tar lurker ] ] ? 
  it 's the eyes is n't it, 
  handpriest ? 
   explore un ` goro, 
  this one tells you almost everything except how much the spell costs , though . 
   once hunter gets good control tools, 
  we 'll wait forever for that to happen, 
  we had one ... :( [ [ yogg-saron , hope 's end ] ], 
  edit : and i disagree with this assessment . 
  hunter 's removal is overcosted and situational , and they do n't have any healing , so they have to keep removing everything all the time for no actual benefit other than not dying . 
  hunter needs a full set of real control tools to get a viable control deck , not just card draw and aoe . 
  remember though , it 's the worst class in standard . 
  in wild it 's tier one . 
  they get subbed for one another in wild renolock . 
  although personally i 'd still rate belcher as the stronger card . 
  no but , priest that runs a bunch of handlock cards , like ancient watcher , humongous razorleaf , sunfury protector , faceless shambler, 
  edit : also , alexstrasza is almost always better , unless you 're trying to use this guy to clear board, 
  or `` give a character -5 health . '', 
  this is very cancerous . 
  it 's a better unnerfed leeroy and unnerfed arcane golem . 
   * kazakus but he does n't count, 
  wrathion too , then . 
  by the power of ragnaros , i have rotated !, 
  edit : you could pull off exodia paladin with this card , dinosize , two tuskboars , and patches/southsea deckhand . 
  better hope there 's no taunts, 
  these are cool and well thought-out , but you gave two non-healing classes , warlock and hunter , healing . 
  i mean in hearthstone . 
  giving warlock healing would give them an easy way to circumvent the downside of their hero power , which would break control warlock . 
  meanwhile , giving hunter healing would make control hunter marginally viable , and we ca n't have that lul . 
  what word even activated the filter ? 
  with those mage cards , i count up to 8 ice blocks reliably available to one deck . 
  dear lord . 
  you would n't , but you could otk someone with it , and it requires five cards ( not counting thaurissan ) . 
  did n't know `` exodia '' is commonly understood to mean `` infinite damage '' rather than `` five-card otk combo '' , sorry . 
  so , what if i use dark avacyn to kill an opponent 's sludge belcher/thing with `` summon plants '' adapt/whatever with enough attack to kill my avacyn , which activates my opponent 's knife juggler , which kills my 1-health auchenai soulpriest ? 
  does the deathrattle trigger or not ? 
  wiktionary says about \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 :, 
   borrowing from old church slavonic \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u044a ( gr\u00e1d\u016d ) , which is a reflex of proto-slavic * gord\u044a ( `` settlement , enclosed place '' ) . 
  doublet of \u0433\u043e\u0301\u0440\u043e\u0434 ( g\u00f3rod ) which was normally inherited by pleophony . 
  old church slavonic word shows liquid metathesis characteristic of south slavic area . 
  so it seems it 's an older way of naming cities , based on ocs ( which is from the south slavic area like the above commenter said ) . 
  `` grad '' is old and also a borrowing ( from ocs , the liturgical language of russian orthodoxy ) . 
  `` gorod '' is the native russian reflex . 
  dunno , more official-sounding ? 
  they 're synonyms , so the difference has to be entirely in connotation . 
  and hunter has infinity reduction with cloaked huntress . 
  imagine this + lock n load + a 1-mana spell . 
  the value !, 
  raw ... x y , as in two axes ? 
  idgi, 
  but `` istanbul '' comes from the greeks anyway ( from `` eis ten polin '' , `` to the city '' ), 
  i smuggle about one stick of salami per year from hungary to the us . 
  then i eat it . 
  you mean unicode combining diacritics !, 
  sometimes paladins mill themselves to death with it , so that 's something to like about it, 
  draws two more cards, 
  weapons ? 
  everybody knows priest is the primary weapon class in hearthstone, 
  hmm , i do n't know if the downside is bad enough that this can be allowed to be a druid removal , but then again recycle is a card . 
  it 's cool how similar it is to naturalize . 
  but it dies to basically every warlock aoe except demonwrath, 
  shaman card, 
  but d\u00f6ner is still on skewer , just not served on skewer, 
  do not know how to read this intonation-wise help, 
  i mean what 's it gon na do ? 
  poor thing looks too traumatized to even bite, 
  well there you go, 
  ah , this is implementation-dependent . 
  on my computer the `` cooking '' emoji shows as a bowl and whisk . 
  `` delicious spider liqueur '' comes to mind, 
  edit : licquer  liqueur, 
  of course , he proceeded to topdeck dr. boom and grom , so he recovered pretty easily . 
  ( although he was quite a ways into his deck , so the fact that he drew them was n't so amazing . ), 
  for the meme , reveal dr. boom , war golem , or kun ( or many others ), 
  mind games always plays a minion from your opponent 's deck , whereas this will always be a minion from your deck . 
  i 'd compare it more to barnes . 
  it might even make muster for battle playable !, 
  preemptively saying this before someone clarifies that `` strictly better '' does n't mean `` absolutely always better '' : you 're right , this is a real downside given that miracle rogue is on the ladder . 
  remember recycle ? 
  that was overcosted as well , compared to similar cards that outperformed it . 
  being overcosted is part of the `` druid removal '' identity . 
  have you ever seen that thing win a joust ? 
  how do you determine that ? 
  * often ? 
  * i definitely would n't rely on it . 
  boom and up , on the other hand ... 
  plus , swashburglar is a burglar, 
  when was the last time most english speakers even used that word, 
  with jokes , it is taken for granted that none of it ever happened . 
  with 4chan stories , you can never be 100 % sure, 
  that 's unfair , she probably just wants to look nice, 
  aside from the quest , bounce a bunch of weasel tunnelers into your deck i guess . 
  takes absolutely forever . 
  then there 's that 1 drop you can bounce with brewmaster ? 
  edit : c'thun with doomcaller !, 
  i think they did n't want to follow up cloaked huntress with a similar card . 
  spiritsinger umbra works around that , but i do n't actually know, 
  oh man , you 're right .
