  using paper efficiently , duh, 
  when was that ? 
  they were in the meta at the same time last summer , but pirate warrior was also very minor . 
  ... or doulos sil , which is what is often used when one is typesetting something in xelatex . 
  natural languages have a lot of accumulated irregularities , phonological , lexical , and grammatical borrowings and reborrowings , and weirdly distributed phonemes from a history of language contact and language change . 
  if the ones you put into your language do n't feel convincing enough to you , you can take your language and `` evolve '' it for a few millennia in some sorta fake world , and get more authentic changes . 
  if you get carried away with this , you can make a whole world with many different language families that all co-evolve and contact each other in various ways , and then you 'll end up with many natural-looking languages . 
  if you get * really * carried away with this , you can write an epic high-fantasy trilogy set in your world that becomes one of the best ever selling book series and achieve almost universal renown . 
   your romanization is just outstandingly awful and makes no sense . 
  it 's really terrible . 
  i 'd suggest changing it to be usable instead of just pretentious twaddle . 
  jeez . 
  what is so wrong with it ? 
  - implosives indicated by g is novel , but kind of clever given that implosives involve a motion in the throat , which is close to where / g / is pronounced, 
  - lax vowels indicated by h makes sense ( like english ) , especially if / a / is truly / a / and not / \u00e4 /, 
  - sh/th and voiced counterparts are in the tradition of english, 
  - x as an unvoiced fricative towards the back makes sense for obvious reasons, 
  - r makes sense both as / \u0280 / ( like french ) and as an alveolar approximant ( similar to english , swedish in certain codas , and pinyin ), 
  - ch makes sense as / \u0280\u0325 / ( on account of it being widely used for / x / , which is only a step away from / \u03c7 / , which is often found in free variation with / \u0280\u0325 / ), 
  - tc is a little odd , but ch is taken , and romanizations are allowed to be a little odd ; it reminds one of tx in parts of iberia , and is actually used for / t\u0283 / in tanzania, 
  - td is odder , but ultimately not very different from tt and dd indicating [ \u027e ] in american english ; it works best if / r / is a marginal phoneme compared to / \u0280 ~ \u0279 / , and we can give op the benefit of the doubt on that, 
  - lh is logical for / \u026c / , although funny in the context of / \u026c / being widely indicated by hl among bantu languages and lh indicating / \u028e / in portuguese, 
  i would have switched x and ch ; / h ~ \u00e7 / is reminiscent of german 's / x ~ \u00e7 / , which is indicated by ch . 
  definitely last summer , and magni was definitely almost solely for control warrior . 
  but i totally did see a lot of garroshes as some flavor of tank up pass warrior . 
  i think the fact that magni 's a paid skin makes the difference . 
  everyone on the team runs to different corners of the map, 
  the problem is , then you 're just a worse genji . 
  but still very relatable . 
   the fact that you have to go to such lengths to explain it away is telling . 
  calm down . 
  i mean do you not expect a bullet point for each grapheme or what ? 
  are the only good romanizations the ones that can be explained in one sentence as '' [ existing orthography ] but with [ weird phoneme ] represented by [ weird grapheme ] '' ? 
  a romanization that tries to avoid diacritics completely will always require some explaining if your language 's phonology is n't exactly like english 's or latin 's , and there 's nothing wrong with that . 
   everybody can do with some constructive criticism . 
  the whole reason i asked was because you never gave a hint as to what you found `` outstandingly awful '' and `` pretentious '' . 
  that 's the furthest thing from constructive criticism , and deserves a rebuttal or at least a calling out . 
  silver nitrate will turn you blue , so there 's that i guess ? 
  also `` we made it ! '', 
  that 's hilarious ; the alternate abbreviation is cp , which is often used to refer to child porn . 
  you ca n't win . 
  ( not that cp does n't have myriad uses as a serious abbreviation as well . ), 
  [ whoa turn 5\u00a04/8 ga with 2 procs is good ?? 
  ] ( #spoiler ), 
  ( sarcasm aside , thank you , it really is nice to know ), 
  wow that opponent super overtraded . 
  the 10/10 + jades only went face ... once ? 
  i think ? 
  kodo rider is * not * a priority target compared to face in that situation . 
  oh well , hindsight is 20/20 . 
  before playing the potion , when he had the elephant up , he needed two hits without healing . 
  so either he relies on you having no healing , trades the 10/10 with kodo rider , and lets that and the 11/11 finish you off next turn ... or plays around a lot of healing by hitting face , and setting up 21 more damage next turn . 
  he did n't have to play around removal ; you 'd already used both . 
  your board does n't trade with either of his guys , not even if you drop garrison commander ( which was often run in inspire priest , so it 's a relevant thing to play around from his perspective ) . 
  it 's true that in the super long game , he had you , but in the meantime all he had to do was stutter on a draw or two to not make a jade every turn ( and he inevitably would have had to shuffle one turn anyway ) and get out-tempoed . 
  you had the consistency of the hero power damage , and were fortunate enough to draw into your top end . 
  but inspire priest 's top end is slow . 
  you beat it by going face . 
  edit : wait , killing the kodo rider that turn plays around sw :p . now i 'm not sure . 
  if you 'd had it , though , i think you 'd have used it the turn before to remove the elephant , so i believe not playing around that was probably the correct play ( although maybe not , considering that from his perspective it was one of the best topdecks you could have gotten , with so few cards remaining in your deck ) . 
  everyone always expects fallout , i guess . 
  the parts outside the carpathian basin are fine , they can have those, 
  what kind of terrible player does n't have harsh rule on 1 ? 
  your best shot at survival is with the following hand :, 
  - seat of glory, 
  - justice sigil, 
  - 3x trail stories, 
  - harsh rule, 
  - 2x who cares ( trail stories + light the fuse gives you a shot at lethal lul ), 
  turn 1 : seat of glory into grenadin drone , to chump block with . 
  turn 2 : justice sigil into 3x trail stories on the harsh rule , play harsh rule . 
  you survive with 15 health ( assuming no chargers ) and clear board ( assuming no aegises ) . 
  if your hand includes another trail stories , you can play it on the harsh rule to make room for a 1 mana play on turn 2 , e.g. 
  oni ronin with charge or something . 
  i generally use the name of whatever country has those colors as its flag , but there 's no damn flag with just green , blue , and black ( definitely not purple , nobody puts that on their flags for some reason ) , so i call it `` tanzanian '' . 
  this is way , way better . 
  wait , what about them sounds like pixar movie names ? 
  the funny thing is , harvest golem gained the mech tribe in gvg and ended up with actual tribal synergy, 
  it 's okay , it 's been replaced by an even more overpowered shaman card lul, 
  it would be an interesting deckbuilding challenge to build a deck that maximizes your chance to draw into these and can also actually win gauntlet . 
  well , you can also stuff your deck with sigils to exploit the redraw mechanic , but let 's be honest , if we 're going that route , is this really the combo we want to draw into ? 
  truth . 
  by heritage i am `` greek catholic '' or `` byzantine catholic '' , which is a hybrid of greek orthodoxy and catholicism . 
  i 've owned a blessed dog , a blessed car , and two blessed desktop computers . 
  tailless primates native to the old world is my understanding of it , which includes humans . 
  wikipedia identifies it with the superfamily [ hominoidea , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ape ) but among similar articles mentions the obsolete family [ pongidae , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pongidae ) which contains what were once called the `` great apes '' , and is basically hominids minus humans . 
  actually typing `` great apes '' redirects you to [ hominidae , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hominidae ) however . 
  edit : even more confusingly , under its page for paraphyletic taxa , it [ lists apes as an example , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paraphyly#examples_of_paraphyletic_groups ) missing humans , with hominoidea as the corresponding monophyletic taxon . 
  so ... maybe ? 
  it seems both `` apes '' and `` great apes '' used to exclude humans specifically , but recently have become conflated with the corresponding taxa that do n't . 
  * exactly , * it 's completely overpowered in mage, 
  i mean , you * can * do anything , the question is what things will and wo n't make people leave obnoxious reports . 
  the arch wiki is the deciding factor in me not switching to gentoo . 
  if you 're gon na have a distro that needs a lot of maintenance , you 're gon na want a lot of community support if you do n't want to spend all your time debugging stuff in the most painful and meticulous way possible . 
  ( not that gentoo does n't have a significant community , but my understanding is it 's smaller than arch 's . ), 
  i imagine , but the last several times i experienced a bug on my relatively nonstandard setup ( thinkpad with nvidia optimus ) , there was always exactly one line on the arch wiki that revealed the nature of the bug well enough for me to fix it , even if it took a little digging . 
  for example , i recently switched back to the ` modesetting ` video driver to get optimus working again ( after a period when i was using the nvidia card exclusively , on account of a faulty integrated graphics chip ) , and a couple weeks later i noticed i could n't change the brightness anymore . 
  i determined that ` xbacklight ` was the weak link , went to the wiki , and after some searching , found the super-important line `` xbacklight currently does not work with the modesetting driver '' . 
  followed shortly by a list of 8 alternatives . 
  it was really great being able to get on with my life instead of debugging ` xbacklight ` .
