  it takes less work just to look at porn . 
  ah , the old reddit switcheroo ... wait , nevermind . 
  i support this . 
  do n't worry , i thought sherlock was 4 until you pointed it out . 
  he even had a damn scarf and everything . 
  as well as here . 
  that seems more like a portmanteau than a pun . 
  you do n't get it . 
  barty crouch jr. was played by tennant . 
   there is no hive mind, 
  you , sir , are unfortunately wrong . 
  reddit is extremely predictable . 
  it still took lots of effort to make , i 'll bet . 
  the guy deserves respect . 
  do n't worry , there 's not * nearly * enough fourteen-year-olds in this subreddit for that to happen . 
  this would make a terrible novelty account . 
  `` turn 52 '' ? 
  i 'm going to play the devil 's idiot here . 
  haow ???!?!?!?!?!? 1 ! 11 ? 1 ! 1 !? 1 ?!!? 1 ?! 1 ?! 1 !? 1 !? 1 ? 
  fromhungarywithlove tends to have the videos up quite early . 
  goddamn , that is creepier . 
  good work !, 
  meanwhile , mine remains the sgrubarrow ... dammit . 
  or the pigment of their skin ( melanin for us ) is too thick for the blood to show through . 
  the skin itself does n't have to be so thick . 
  i wish the hammer of zillyhoo was overpowered elsewhere as well than just the skyrim mod . 
  that would be so much fun . 
  do you know about economics ? 
  i * thought * it was a repost ... 
  the version that they use is much less sophisticated than present-day dwarf fortress , though , so that 's why more modern stories might be better . 
  explain ? 
  ( been playing df for years , never had a manager ), 
  the christians here are missing the point . 
  a cell on a distant planet would be considered life , yes . 
  but a zygote is * also * considered life . 
  just not sapient , intelligent life , with human rights . 
  neither is the alien cell , and neither are the cells in your mouth . 
  this is why they are considered expendable . 
  they have no human rights , so you can kill them . 
  they do n't meet the criteria . 
  however , at what point does one * become * sapient and intelligent ? 
  if sapience is the criterion for receiving human rights , then at what point is one sapient ? 
  sapience is defined as the ability to act with judgement . 
  * but how much judgement ? 
  * a newborn , who , legally , has all of the rights of a human , has practically no judgement at all , and is easily outmatched by , say , a german shepherd , which can judge * at the very least * by pavlovian psychology . 
  so then , is it the * potential * for intelligent judgement that makes this newborn a legal human ? 
  but then what of the zygote : does it not have the same potential as well ? 
  then why should n't it have the same rights ? 
  goddammit , ethics . 
  both are really intellectually polluted means of communication . 
  you do n't have to bring up all such things . 
  it works ( does n't work ? ), 
  for me in alien blue . 
  i 'm having the same problem . 
  what 's a bclk ? 
  atheists  god  everything, 
  where is your god now, 
  because religious people are dumbfucks, 
  and now : ** downvotes **, 
  ** ~ ~ russia ~ ~ ~ ~ japan ~ ~ france ** , amirite ? 
  hahaha math , you must be an atheist like me, 
  ... i do n't even read / r/funny . 
  or , actually , any of the default subreddits , except / r/worldnews , / r/politics , and / r/atheism ( because i am a christian ) . 
  i recently unsubscribed from / r/gaming , and occasionally browse / r/all . 
  and you do have a point : the hivemind is less strong on on the smaller subreddits . 
  actually , it 's only visible to any significant degree on the larger subreddits . 
  perhaps we could make the hypothesis that the predictability of a subreddit is directly and linearly proportional to its size . 
  actually , this would be a very interesting hypothesis to test . 
  let 's design an experiment . 
  something to do with posting links . 
  our afferent variable should be population . 
  our efferent variable should be link karma , of course . 
  it should involve making several test accounts ( the larger the sample size the better ) , each commanded by a different person . 
  and each person should be handed a list of subreddits ( constant across each person ) , and spend a given number of hours browsing each subreddit . 
  then , they should post a link in each subreddit at exactly the same time of day as the other people posted it that they think would garner the most karma ; something that conforms to the general perceived hivemindedness of each subreddit . 
  then , as the numbers roll in , we put them on a scatter plot ( x is subreddit population , and y is percentage of the truncated mean of the first 25 top submissions of the subreddit ) and draw a best-fit line . 
  genius . 
  one question , why 100.9 ? 
  no , i changed it since then for another post . 
  i thought you saw this one already !, 
  i plan to change it back to sgrubarrow as soon as possible . 
  do n't mind me , just commenting for future reference . 
  both of the links on there are quite amazing . 
  teach me your ways !, 
  for the record , i picture lopan like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ipo1y.jpg ) , but with pyramids instead of skyscrapers . 
  actually , lem me make a fanart request . 
  and now you 're sad that it 's very impractical to use your laptop like that . 
  i do n't use twitter . 
  are these in reverse chronological order ? 
  also , he communicates like a schizophreniac with access to a typewriter . 
  edit : i 'm serious ; i 'm not just saying this because of his name . 
  attempts to communicate by severe schizophreniacs are often fragmented , and lack a clear train of thought and proper grammar . 
  the words tumble over each other , trying to show an idea , an inference , but they 're just terrible at using words , and intellection in general . 
  but that 's just speech . 
  if you give a schizophreniac access to a medium where he can write on his own time , then the grammatical imperfections flying all over the place can be veiled behind a proper sentence structure . 
  but the thoughts themselves will still be illogical to a sane observer . 
  and * that 's * what seems to be happening here . 
  edit 2 : for the record , my previous edit was made before i was replied to . 
  i am sad about the spreading of salt to fresh water thing . 
  maybe he could make it produce brackish water instead ?
