  maybe so anyone trying it at home would fail ? 
  not sure if there 's too much danger of people trying it at home . 
  so you 'd have to use feign death or something . 
  finally , hunter gets healing !, 
  was it clear that it was in a chemistry context ? 
  maybe they just meant that it 's strong enough to dissolve a lot of stuff , i.e. 
  strong in the non-technical sense . 
  terrible choice of words if that 's the case , though . 
  is that you in the picture ? 
  how did you train them to roll over like that ? 
  honestly , if we had a big database of starcraft games where the entire game state over time was stored ( like we do for go ) , then we would have already cracked good starcraft ai with machine learning ( like we did for go ) . 
  and he has the letters b e l o in his name !, 
  the consipracy thickens !, 
  what is this from ? 
  fun fact for those not in the know : [ k and p spoken simultaneously , as well as g and b spoken simultaneously , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/labial%e2%80%93velar_consonant ) are common phonemes in west africa , and contrast with `` k '' and `` p '' or `` g '' and `` b '' spoken one after another . 
  you have `` gb '' in the name of the major nigerian language of igbo , for example , which used to be spelled `` ibo '' on account of `` gb '' sounding like `` b '' . 
  thanks !, 
  why does it have to be in malaysia ? 
  there is also a flag of indonesia and of brunei to the right , and in all three of those countries you 'd write `` dorong '' on a door if you wanted people to push it . 
  ( to the right of brunei 's flag , i think that may be thailand , but this is definitely not in thailand . ), 
  edit : that indonesian flag is actually an indonesian flag and a flag of singapore . 
  since the indonesian flag is the furthest to the left , i 'd say that this is in indonesia . 
  well , a more practical and mostly equivalent thing would be to change your hero power to `` 0 mana : draw a card . 
  you may use your hero power an unlimited amount of times per turn . '', 
  does n't immediately get you to fatigue , though . 
  if anja were about to say , `` he 's actually a really nice guy , '' i do n't think she 'd lead with `` it 's much worse than that ... '' and have such a despairing look on her face . 
  it 's called the caverns * below . 
  * tfb is a thing from * below . 
  * apparently , everything below is a 5/5 . 
  that is what op ( and the other post ) are highlighting . 
  you have to connect the dots yourself , otherwise it 's not funny . 
  this is the first time i 've seen alex jones . 
  dude was n't lying when he said he was a performer . 
  by $ ony picture $ entertainment , no less , so you know it 'll have all the marks of a soulless cash grab , such as product placement, 
  well , bvs had more problems than that . 
  how about showing the same flashback four times ? 
  that one 's at least an * enjoyable * music video ( assuming you 're talking about * legacy * ), 
  it is , but it 's a movie , not a music video . 
  well , it 's supposed to be that , but i think trolden would accept the first one as well . 
  bit strapped for content these days . 
  you can run both !, 
  wow !, 
  mage actually has enough random-themed cards available to it that you can afford not to run garbage like servant . 
  on the other hand , you definitely need to run flamewaker , as well as maybe an early spare parts minion for flamewaker synergy . 
  but you ca n't run apprentice sadly , which is by far the biggest disadvantage compared to regular tempo mage . 
  crossover with / r/avasdemon , or is this a coincidence/a common origin ? 
  part of what made the harry potter universe so exciting ( and popular ) was the idea that its magic was very `` studyable '' , consisting of words and wand movements . 
  it 's weird that that is not a more common thing for fictional magic . 
  tangent : in the real life case specifically , it 's necessary for people to say `` you have to feel it '' , because if you tell people that they should feel something , they will , versus if you claim some physical phenomenon , that probably wo n't happen for you . 
  i guess the properties of most fictional magic descend from this . 
  zach 's not fooling anyone !, 
  you * can , * but it 's not random-themed . 
  if you try to make a casino mage deck that 's actually good without restricting yourself to random-themed cards , then it just turns into tempo mage , which defeats the purpose kinda . 
  ( this does n't stop people from including non-random cards in their casino mage decks ; see the reno variant below . 
  so the `` random-themed only '' philosophy is definitely not the only one , but imo the best way to play casino mage is when something random is happening every turn . ), 
  especially one with the cot-caught merger, 
  in the part of new jersey where we do n't merge them , they sound almost the same , but the vowel in `` caught '' starts out a little more rounded and closed than the rest of the vowel , kinda like `` cwot '' . 
  i 'm not sure if people with the merger even notice . 
  well , the english do a completely different thing from anyone in the us , so no surprise there . 
   i also ... enjoy ... how people with a jersey accent pronounce jersey as if it were spelled joisey . 
  there is no `` oi '' in jersey ... it kills me . 
  people do n't do that , though . 
  who do you know who does that ? 
  maybe someone from brooklyn . 
  unfortunately i ca n't stream video on the shitty connection i have right now . 
  i think the stereotype comes from the nyc area , but even the people i know from nj who live near there , in newark or lyndhurst , have a rhotic accent . 
  and everyone in the rest of the state until you get to philly in pa , besides certain immigrants and certain black communities , also speaks with a rhotic accent . 
  see [ rick aschmann 's map , ] ( http://aschmann.net/ameng/#smallmapunitedstates ) which supports my claim ; the areas bounded in green are non-rhotic , and all of nj is left out except for a small section of the shore in the north . 
  funniest part of the whole video, 
  3 mana 1/4 taunt , your taunt minions have +1 attack, 
  yeah , turning the hre into a big blob is early modern cartography 101 . 
  no remark to make here . 
  so then what is the specific mechanism proposed behind countries with mcdonald ` ses not going to war with each other ? 
  such countries are typically close trading partners with each other , and so their politicians worry that going to war with a trading partner will be economically costly ? 
  if they are both getting their supply from a third source , then regardless of whether it 's the same source , it should n't matter whether they are at war , right ? 
  or directly into anomalus, 
  edit : and then got bounced , so it 's no longer zerus-shiny, 
  warlock has always had the best board clears . 
  its other cards have been more or less garbage , but its board clears are always the best in the game . 
  i 'd actually like to see that card . 
  seems unfair to give both of the only real tutors in the game to priest , though ( the other being shadow visions ) . 
  rule 1 : / r/hearthstone is always wrong . 
  unless ramp druid forces jades out of the meta . 
  we can only hope ... 
  i am right there with you ; that song is odd . 
  but it 's all subjective , and the song is nice to listen to , i guess . 
  i said more or less . 
  there 's definitely several outliers ( even un ` goro had ravenous pterrordax and bloodbloom ) , but the board clears are the only consistently good kind of card that warlock gets . 
  and wins vs jades . 
  that 's the most important part . 
  it 's simple . 
  i 'm wrong . 
  the 3 mana prince might have a place in some sort of combo later on . 
  the 4 mana one is completely terrible , though . 
  like a stronger , slower antique healbot with a gigantic downside . 
  ironically , wild shamans get absolutely no benefit from it , even though they have the best way to cheat out minions . 
  that might actually be good , in any class other than warrior, 
  [ they have hardcoded it :\\ ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6q54je/live_frozen_throne_card_reveal_w_day9/dkv0431/ ), 
  the more stuff i read by vim users on the internet , the more it seems nobody knows that ` : x ` is a synonym for ` : wq ` . 
  wait a minute , do what ?
