  sure , it 's not the government making this kind of content , but glorifying our leaders makes me feel really uncomfortable , even if it 's done as a joke . 
  or vaguely like a neutral open the waygate . 
  all you need is the cost reduction to be `` reduced by 2 for every spell you play that did n't start in your deck '' . 
  well , it used to be , but blizzard felt discarding your opponent 's cards was unfun , especially as a neutral option . 
  which is fair enough . 
  pretty surprising , though , that they later gave both treachery and howlfiend to warlock in the same expansion , and printed dirty rat two expansions prior . 
  from english , we have borrowed `` hamburger '' and `` western '' as spelling pronunciations \\* , [ \u02c8h\u0252mburg\u025br ] and [ ` v\u025bst\u025brn ] . 
  at the moment i ca n't think of any other english loans with / \u0259 / or anything close to it in them ; there is the pronunciation of * ketchup * as [ \u02c8k\u025bt\u0361\u0283\u00f8p ] ( i do n't know if it 's universal ; i hear it in the northeast ) , but i think that might be because it was loaned from german [ \u02c8k\u025bt\u0361\u0283\u028ap ] , if that 's even how german speakers pronounce it . 
  i think in general hungarian likes to loan words from english as spelling pronunciations \\* ; the oldest english loan i know of is * szmoking * , from `` smoking jacket '' , pronounced [ ` smoki\u014bg ] . 
  the only romanian word containing / \u0259 / that i am sure was loaned directly into hungarian is * afin\u0103 * ( blueberry ) , which was loaned as [ \u02c8a\u0308\u02d0fo\u0272\u0252 ] . 
  if we are to believe that * pl\u0103cint\u0103 * ( cr\u00eape ) was also loaned directly , then that is another example , in [ \u02c8p\u0252l\u0252t\u0361\u0283int\u0252 ] . 
  both examples suggest that romanian / \u0259 / is loaned as / \u0252 / in hungarian . 
  ( i personally do n't consider / \u0252 / , which is standard , to be a very impressive transcription ; it might be more accurate for some dialects in the west , but generally it sounds more like [ \u0251\u033d ] to me , which is closer in pronunciation to / \u0259 / . ), 
  \\* disclaimer on spelling pronunciations : a `` true '' spelling pronunciation would have loaned \u27e8 s \u27e9 as / \u0283 / . 
  this has n't occurred in hungarian for many centuries , because hungarians figure that \u27e8 s \u27e9 is more often pronounced as / s / rather than / \u0283 / outside of hungary . 
  for loaning latin words by spelling , we used to use german pronunciation rules for \u27e8 s \u27e9 . 
  we are more to the west , near princeton . 
  personally i have since moved to the sf bay area , but still talk with my family , who remain in new jersey . 
  about loans vs code-switching : i 'd call it code-switching , because the english word 's pronunciation is not hungarian-ified . 
  sometimes it will be an entire noun phrase in english , even . 
  for example , we have a friend called `` jonathan '' . 
  to ask whether someone wants to go to jonathan 's , one might ask :, 
  but for a suffix with no rounded form , e.g. 
  - val/vel , there is no new class . 
  so to ask whether someone wants to go * with * jonathan , they would just say :, 
  as opposed to creating a new ending '' - n\u0259l '' . 
  we also just sometimes call him `` jonat\u00e1n '' , as in the apple . 
   you speak of the three vowel forms being for different cases - is there analysis of whether one of those is the underlying/default version , and the other two follow ` if-then ' versions ? 
  i do n't see a clear victor . 
  front unrounded is the most common , but it gets merged with front rounded often enough , and the merged ending sometimes has characteristic vowel / \u025b / as though it were front unrounded ( e.g. 
  comitative-instrumental - val/vel , illative - ba/be ) and sometimes has characteristic vowel / \u00f8 / as though it were front rounded ( e.g. 
  this suggests that maybe the back vowel class is default , except there 's still a two-way distinction after the merger . 
  some endings merge those two too , but there is no clear pattern to their vowels and they sometimes use vowels that do n't even appear in other endings ( such as terminative - ig ) . 
   and somewhat relatedly , was there ever any disagreement between people as to which one to use - ( even if not actually an argument , just simply different people falling into different usages ) ? 
  not really , we 've given up altogether on remarking on nonstandard pronunciation , because we make mistakes relatively frequently . 
  ( by `` mistake '' , i mean that we want to say one thing , but accidentally say another thing that we do n't like the sound of , such as accidentally applying the wrong suffix . 
  not that we do something nonstandard but regular , such as the subject of the post . ), 
  overall , however , our pronunciation is n't noticeably different from that used in northeast hungary , which is probably owed to us visiting yearly for weeks at a time . 
   anyway ... 
  i already have about 7 other questions in my mind , but thank you for telling us about this !, 
  no problem . 
  i 'd be happy to answer more questions . 
  i 've always wondered how fusional languages manage to apply their endings to recent loans . 
  from what i 've heard , latin was sometimes not very good at it . 
  what happens to english words that do n't belong to a clear polish noun class ? 
  is there a `` default '' one that they get slotted into anyway ? 
  the post is about how to make a gear mechanism with irregular , organic-looking gears . 
  the first step is to come up with an irregular , organic-looking gear . 
  then you have to derive the shapes of the rest of the gears the way the post tells you to . 
  but the first gear is more or less arbitrary . 
  do indeclinables cause a lot of ambiguities ? 
  or can you just back them up with prepositions and word order ? 
  i guess it 's less of a problem when your language has only got 7 cases . 
  ah okay , i would n't know . 
  what is a `` blueberry bush '' in romanian ? 
  i hear '' \u00e1fonya '' or the attributive '' \u00e1fony\u00e1s '' discussed much more in hungarian than the plural '' \u00e1fony\u00e1k '' , and that is because there are multiple related things to blueberries that we discuss , such as '' \u00e1fonyasz\u00f6rp '' ( blueberry syrup ) , '' \u00e1fony\u00e1s lep\u00e9ny '' ( a kind of pastry containing blueberries ) , and '' \u00e1fonyabokor '' ( blueberry bush ) . 
  i do n't think necessarily hungarians would just go and loan the plural form out of context ( although that sort of thing has happened before , in other languages ) . 
  another thing that might confound the correspondence is that the loans are old enough that back when they were getting made , / \u0259 / may not have yet been a phoneme in romanian . 
  but i do n't know the language 's history , or the actual time period of the loans . 
  hungarians arrived in the carpathian basin sometime between 700 and 800 ce iirc , when vulgar latin was still more or less of a thing . 
  the fact that it does n't look completely terrible is a hint that it 's not comic sans . 
  listen , if * you * were reviewing these adoptions , would * you * wan na be the one who stops 366 people from being a loving family , and also some kind of world record ? 
  greatness , at any cost ? 
  what actually is the smuggler 's run art ? 
  it just looks like a blue and yellow blur in my memory . 
  some guys on a car ? 
  kinda broken considering that you 're basically guaranteed to get rewinder somewhere , and considering that raza dk priest can abuse this to get a bazillion damage from hand . 
  maybe make it a class card for a class where this ca n't be abused , like shaman ? 
  i know it 'd look better without the 0 mana thing , but hearthcards is n't capable of it . 
  inspired by this week 's brawl . 
  considered giving this card to priest instead , but that would have been too strong . 
  warlock is the only class in which this is reasonably not completely broken . 
  it can also be considered shield block minus healing touch . 
  what the heck is a tumor cell ? 
  edit : wait , it 's a joke . 
  but it costs 0 mana rather than 2 mana . 
  spell damage synergy !, 
  i feel like i just watched a silent film from the 20s . 
  `` the marketing boys say i need a logo . 
  if i 'm to have a symbol it shall be one i respect . '', 
  i kinda like it . 
  but then , i kinda do n't . 
  accidentally posted this to / r/vexillologycirclejerk first . 
  i kinda like it . 
  but then , i kinda do n't . 
  see how many different uralic flags you can pick out . 
  the big three , hungary , finland , and estonia , are included pretty well , but the rest are in it alright too . 
  the komi republic and xmao are there in the adjacent green and blue stripes ; \u042fhao is there in the blue stripe ; udmurtia is there in the adjacent black and red stripes ; and it 's even got the black cross for nationalist karelia ( but also the colors for its regular flag ) . 
  mordvinia is also there kind of , but the red and blue stripes are n't adjacent , so their inclusion is second-class . 
  perhaps the most poorly represented uralic flag is [ that of mari el . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/flag_of_mari_el.svg ) it 's also missing yellow for the sami and the izhorians , but it has all their other colors . 
  oh well , you ca n't have everything . 
  why ???? 
  number one summer destination in russia . 
  complete with palm trees . 
  everyone wants to visit sochi . 
  i just wanted to make `` shield block minus ice barrier/healing touch '' . 
  and here it is . 
  turns out it 's pretty boring . 
  it is truly incredible .
