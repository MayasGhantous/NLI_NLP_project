  so he must have been traveling . 
  the mystery deepens . 
   edit : wow , there are a lot of dudes here eager to assert that jennifer lawrence is nothing special . 
  i think people are just sick of hearing her mentioned as some kind of modern-day helen . 
  men are generally pretty open/opinionated about what they do and do n't consider attractive , and it must be really irritating to hear most of the us repeating an opinion that you feel ca n't possibly be right . 
  it 's not perlin noise , though . 
  perlin noise is cloudy . 
  this has ripples . 
  the algorithmic approach is probably the best here ; most pretty images generated using math that i know of have no closed form , just an iterated algorithmic one . 
  that said , while there 's something to your approach , it unfortunately does n't quite work here ; it does n't generate any concentric patterns of ripples , just random ridges . 
  if you up the frequency of the sine , all it does is make the peaks sharper somehow ; not quite sure how that works . 
  here 's some examples , with z having a range of 0 to 1 :, 
  ( sorry for the mouse in the first one , i kinda spaced out . ), 
  i wonder if our methods are n't too ad-hoc . 
  this seemed like a completely decent approach . 
  the mathematica for this approach , if anyone is interested , can be found here :, 
  resolution : = 20 ;, 
  with [, 
  bsplinefunction [ randomreal [ 1 , { resolution , resolution , 1 } ] ] } ,, 
  hmm , real weird . 
  your code indeed does the thing , although it looks somewhat jagged compared to the original . 
  oh well , i blame ` bsplinefunction ` . 
  maybe someone will come along and figure out the problem . 
  got ta sleep . 
  that 's amazing . 
  ah , yes , you 're right , the second link does have patterns like op 's . 
  it 's the same basic idea as / u/troyunrau 's : take some kind of continuous noise , and pipe it into a high-frequency periodic function ( high-frequency wrt to the feature size anyway ) . 
  but here , instead of a spline fit to random noise being piped to the sine function , it 's perlin noise being piped to the fractional part function . 
  when you put it that way , perlin noise does seem like the obvious and best choice for the underlying noise , for the reasons you stated . 
  ( best except for maybe simplex noise , but that algorithm 's proprietary iirc . ), 
  i guess we can call this question answered . 
  for clarity , the best answer we 've found in this thread so far is :, 
  find a continuous noise function with a uniform feature size . 
  perlin noise works . 
  find a nice-looking periodic function , with a high frequency compared to the feature size of the noise function . 
  sin ( * kx * ) with * k * adjusted to be large is a good one . 
  apply the periodic function to the output of the noise . 
  see the bottom two images in / u/wyrelyre 's second link or the images generated by / u/troyunrau for some good examples of this in practice . 
  but who names their kid g\u00e1bor outside of hungary ? 
  this is the nicest and most granular set of maps like this i 've ever seen . 
  fantastic job to whoever made them . 
  now , for the important question : why the hell is `` bubbler '' used in two totally different places ? 
  was there an exodus west from new england or something ? 
  it 's weird how some of these isoglosses cut through wide swathes of the entire north of the us , only to end up bisecting new jersey once they reach the east coast . 
  as someone who learned english in almost the dead center of new jersey , both sides of these isoglosses usually seem interchangeable to me . 
  ( except for `` pork roll '' . 
  that sounds like a kind of bread . 
  but i 've never actually seen this dish . 
  starting to think the whole thing is made-up , like drop bears . ), 
  somewhat relatedly , the harvard dialect survey [ says ] ( https://www4.uwm.edu/fll/linguistics/dialect/staticmaps/q_15.html ) that new jersey and connecticut are the only two states where no part of the mary-merry-marry merger consistently happens . 
  the idea is that you present yourself as having the same ideas as your opposition , but with a couple `` concerns '' about those ideas , in order to invite support from those `` on the side of '' the opposition . 
  this is considered dishonest when you are ideologically far from the opposition in many ways , because it 's probably those ideologies that are motivating the `` concerns '' . 
  although it really is a problem in theory , people tend to call any behavior that makes someone look like they 're not `` on their side '' concern trolling , which does n't really engage the argument in any way . 
  that 's maybe where you got the impression that it 's made up . 
  this example kind of works , though . 
  you 've got someone who 's probably an alt-rightist framing their argument as one inspired by liberal values . 
  to be fair , documentaries are totally considered a serious art form , and apparently people complain about politics in those , too . 
  so complaining about politics in games is , in some way , taking them seriously as an art form . 
  sez you buddy . 
  if you read [ the wikipedia page  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pork_roll ), 
   in north jersey , residents continue to use the term taylor ham , while south jersey residents generally use the term pork roll , with central jersey residents using a mix of the two . 
  to be honest , as someone whose english is from new jersey , `` sneakers '' evokes a different kind of shoe than `` gym shoes '' or `` tennis shoes '' for me . 
  `` sneakers '' are those padded sports shoes with indentations on the sides and thick , curved soles , usually nike or adidas . 
  they are acceptable casual wear . 
  `` tennis shoes '' and `` gym shoes '' are the flat-bottomed , white-soled canvas shoes that i had to wear to gym class back in elementary school , and which people probably wore to the gym back before sneakers were invented . 
  they are not acceptable casual wear , and are smelly . 
  edit : i 've changed my mind . 
  `` gym shoes '' are just whatever shoes you , personally , wear to the gym . 
  when someone says `` gym shoes '' , though , i picture what i described for `` tennis shoes '' . 
  someday , i 'm going to post an album of ever ` thing r\u00f3\u017calski has ever painted to this subreddit , and get * so much karma . 
  - mary : [ me\u02d1\u0279i ], 
  - marry : [ m\u00e6\u02d1\u0279i ], 
  even `` marry '' ? 
  pretty weird . 
   i think with standardised spellings , there will not have been any language evolution , 
  english and french have had standardized spelling for a long while , and have still undergone plenty of language change . 
  it 's part of the reason why their orthographies look so weird , because they were originally devised for an earlier stage of the language . 
  the similarity to redtube is all i can think about whenever i hear `` youtube red '' . 
   you have a difficult to study system and an easy to study system and if you can find that the basic governing math of the two systems , after sufficient massaging , is in fact the same , then you can perform experiments on the simple system to learn about the hard system . 
  in a very abstract sense , that 's what all computer-based experimentation is , in fact . 
  good on you two . 
  that was way easier to read than an actual argument , and accomplished exactly the same thing . 
  `` whenever you summon an elemental , give it charge . '', 
  man , as somebody who is super bad at remembering the names of things , every instance of this meme is a 10 + second ride . 
  `` okay , okay , so what is the dude on ? 
  it 's a. . . * fence , * okay , he 's on the fence . 
  now , this guy looks familiar so i 've probably seen him a lot before . 
  clearly a politician , looks kinda like a freddy ... obviously he 's not a freddy , who the hell is freddy ? 
  anyway i 've definitely seen him before . 
  who 's the whitest politician i know ? 
  oh yeah the vp , he 's ... mike ... pence !, 
  it 's pence on a fence !, 
  i did it ! '', 
  wait , i do n't get it . 
  how is armorsmith an ace ? 
  i guess if aces come after kings , and you number the face cards as they go up after 10 , then aces are 14 , and armorsmith 's stats are 1/4 , but that explanation seems like a stretch . 
  the guy was n't making any claim about the average life expectancy , just that there were people who died at age 30 . 
  he 's correct ; you should n't avoid disinfecting stuff because it 's `` unnatural '' , because infections kill people . 
  we 're not going to breed alcohol-resistant diseases by killing them with alcohol ; it 's just too destructive . 
  the actual problem is antibiotics , and probably where / u/souldust got the idea for their post from .
