  their mechanisms have to be very specific , because the drugs go inside you , so they have to kill just the infectious cells and not your cells . 
  specific mechanisms are easy to evolve out of . 
  hence the arms race . 
  ( the arms race that we 're losing , partly thanks to overprescription of antibiotics by people who do n't know any better or just do n't care . 
  it 's a big problem in south asia , for example . ), 
  like patches , but less good . 
  it 's pretty cool . 
  not even that stopped phonological change in english and french . 
  most french spellings are from old french ( i think ? 
  someone fact check me on this ) , which was very different phonologically , and most english spellings are from either the early modern period or the middle period , which both had fairly different vowel systems from any modern dialect , plus some other miscellaneous changes . 
  i dunno , even after having spent a couple years on this sub , i ca n't decide which discipline i 'm familiar with has the most crackpots . 
  sure the public generally knows less linguistics ( and often outright * wrong * linguistics ) compared to most sciences , but that 's different from having honest-to-god crackpots , with entire belief systems built on faulty information . 
  i work in biomedicine and biomolecular engineering . 
  do you know just how many people completely reject even basic biological and medical principles ? 
  like , okay , the same way that there 's a ton of prescriptivists and a ton of `` sanskrit/tamil was the first language '' people because they do n't know any better , there 's also a ton of creationists ( not technically medicine , i know ) and a lot of anti-vaxxers because they do n't know any better . 
  but then there 's also the entire `` alternative medicine '' movement . 
  there 's homeopaths , there 's traditional eastern medicine people , there 's crystal healers , magnet healers , chiropractors ... there 's something like millions of people who figure that they do n't need to go to the doctor , because my entire field is a sham , and they buy into some stupid placebo ( or at best plants containing active ingredients ) instead . 
  if that does n't make them crackpots , i dunno what does . 
  my other other field i 've studied is physics . 
  physics is famous for its crackpots , but i think they mostly died out around the 70s and 80s , and honestly there probably were n't that many to begin with . 
  do `` aliens '' crackpots count as physics crackpots , or astronomy crackpots , or what ? 
  my grandfather was an aliens crackpot , and said that they used physically inexplicable phenomena to travel and stuff . 
  ( very tangential note , because i 've never discussed this with someone : for the past three times that i 've gotten a massage in hungary , my masseur/euse figured out that i 'm a biochemist , and started trying to debate evolution with me . 
  they were always nice about it , though . 
  maybe i should try traveling down to the american south and getting a massage there . ), 
  from the resident guy-who 's - pretty-good-at-tagalog-phonology : they would be roughly [ serkol ] and [ merkol ] . 
  or * monarchist iran . 
  * down with the islamic republic !, 
  ( not really , please do n't imprison me iran \u2639 ), 
  fun fact , the eszett originates as a ligature of s and z , but back when they looked like [ this . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/theuerdank_szlig.png ), 
  it 's not a good idea to make all the wild cards relevant to standard . 
  you should n't have to know all the wild cards to play standard ; that 's a huge barrier of entry for new players . 
  ( that said , this card would still be fun . 
  it just would n't be fun to have played against you if you 've just gotten into hearthstone . ), 
  no , if someone played it * against * you . 
  you have no idea what to play around . 
  unless they print some kind of card like `` your hero is immune this turn '' . 
  ( i dunno , would this work if it died at the same time as violet illusionist ? ), 
  oh my god , you 're right . 
  it 's a shaman card . 
  it 's impressive that you managed to find the perfect card art . 
  how ? 
  consistenly in priest ? 
  but even then . 
  where do these come from ? 
  reminds me of this little-known movie called * moonrise kingdom *, 
  man , this is the most obvious one of all time , but it still took me like 5 secs to figure it out ... the name of the pill is written * right there ... *, 
  so , the mice are transylvanian saxons . 
  this makes sense !, 
  oops , for some reason i thought this was a priest card . 
  probably because of that `` ultimate mind blast '' or whatever priest card that was posted in another thread . 
  would n't it be cool if cards drawn by golden cards turned gold ? 
  not that the current system does n't make just as much sense ( if not more ) . 
  velen does n't work with lifesteal minions , does he ? 
  it 's a feature associated specifically with ie languages , although there 's other primary language families that have noun class systems , such as the niger-congo languages . 
  the most famous case , and most likely the inspiration for what happened in season 4 , was [ rosemary kennedy 's lobotomy . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rosemary_kennedy#lobotomy ) she ended up way worse than beatrice 's mom , though . 
  also , in s4e11 , when beatrice shows up at young tv star bojack 's house , his refrigerator is almost completely filled with lemons . 
  honestly i do n't really like comic papyrus , even as a joke . 
  it 's just comic sans but grainier . 
  it could have been so much more interesting !, 
  or you could have gotten a freezing potion off of kabal courier , the kabal potions guy , or one of priest 's copy-cards-from-your-opponent 's - deck cards ( but who runs freezing potion ? 
  i have `` nt '' as [ n ] or [ n\u02c0 ] in most places , so that 's basically how i pronounce it anyway ( but more like `` grannid '' ) . 
  english speaker here , no clue what `` auld lang syne '' means . 
  what does it mean ? 
  ( presumably `` auld '' means `` old '' , but even knowing some stuff about the phonological history of the west germanic languages does n't help with `` lang syne '' ; probably neither of the words are `` time '' , since that was `` tide '' in middle english , and that 's pretty much all i 've got ), 
  i 've always wondered what 's the deal with creolists . 
  turns out the deal is john mcwhorter . 
  wow , never knew that about gelatin . 
  what property of gelatin makes it a good emulsifier ? 
  is it very hydrophilic ? 
  at this point , i think the ones that are n't are an endangered species . 
  especially in transylvania . 
  maybe a paladin secret ? 
  fits with the theme of paladin secrets having to do with dudes and their morals ( like get down ) , and ensures that it 's not just an overcosted doomsayer . 
  i mean , it 's already super annoying when rogue gets sacrificial pact versus warlock . 
  rogue 's burgle effects generate so many random cards that one card interaction can turn a significant percentage of games into bullshit . 
  iceblock specifically says `` if you take fatal damage , * then * it 's prevented and you 're immune '' , though . 
  the four horsemen do n't do fatal damage at all ; they 're a destroy effect . 
  on the other hand , the interaction can be tested by playing deathspeaker on something and then playing twisting nether . 
  oh , in that case i stand corrected . 
  cool . 
  no , i never said any of that . 
  just wanted to point out that it 's not as stupid of a reason to object to it as it appears . 
  a stronger argument against it is design space . 
  printing this card means you ca n't print neutral or rogue continuous spell reduction . 
  ( or you can , if you want to allow rogue to occasionally do some big wombo-combo where they play this 5 times and then edwin . 
  it 's not that overpowered . ), 
  to be fair , the advantage of this is that you 're not spending any of the other cards in your deck when you play it . 
  if you 're comboing off with gadgetzan auctioneer , you can do an ultimate infestation-level swing where you get auctioneer and your spell reducer in play , then clear your opponent 's board of 1-health minions and immediately refill your hand . 
  dammit , i know the line from * watchmen * is `` pagliacci '' , but that 's italian for `` clowns '' !, 
  a singular clown is a `` pagliaccio '' . 
  ( the whole thing comes from this great opera called * pagliacci , * where the wife in a husband-and-wife clown team cheats on the husband , making him very sad . 
  the most famous part of the opera is his solo , `` vesti la giubba '' , where he sings about how he has to perform even though he is heartbroken . ), 
  do you really want people to be able to run two of a neutral babbling book ? 
  also , its effect is pretty special ; afaik there 's no other ( neutral ? ), 
  card that can generate * any * other card . 
  never , ever .
