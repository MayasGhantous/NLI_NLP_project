  thoughts ? 
  ** tl ; dr 4d black people **, 
  new trolls are pre_srahct anectesreots , 
  turns out i actually have to draw something for the rest of the medium renders . 
  i need a cloud cover for lowas and lofaf , and ... 
  i think i can ~ ~ steal ~ ~ the rest actually . 
  any tips on where to start ? 
  ~ ~ also , can anyone identify the mineral that lolar resembles ? ~ ~, 
  oh , and on a completely irrelevant note , i 've figured out the reddit alien 's class and aspect : thief of time . 
  edit : or i could just write my own terrain generation algorithms for the lowas and lofaf continents and stuff . 
  i guess that 's not too hard . 
  now to learn how to save a png file in c. . . ( i hate bitmaps ), 
  im clever for inventing mining cuebs upbeoteasaaaaaa, 
  real professional . 
  my motherboard is atx form factor , and i only need one internal bay and one external bay ( on for the hard drive , one for the dvd drive ( which is gigantic , by the way ) ) . 
  will it really matter which kind of case i get ? 
  can someone point me in the direction of a cheap one , and a cheap power supply to go with it ? 
  i 'm building a long-lasting amd computer for my grandfather , with an asrock 870 extreme3 motherboard , which has no sata2 ports . 
  we both agreed that an ssd would be good for the thing , so i started poking around for ssds that use sata3 ( i do n't want to compromise for sata2 ) , and are 3.5 '' and sane ( none of that laptop nonsense ) . 
  i had a lot of trouble !, 
  eventually , though , i settled for a semi-obscure ( not listed on pcpartspicker ) 64gb samsung 3.5 '' ssd , read speed 520 mb/s , write speed 160 mb/s . 
  but then , just now , browsing this site , i see several people gleefully sticking 2.5 '' ssds in their desktop computers . 
  how do i do this and would this be a stupid thing to do as a sole hard drive ? 
  i just realized that the graphics card that i picked out for my cheap , gaming-oriented build is somewhat underkill : the asus radeon 5450 . 
  the card i 'm sticking in my * grandfather 's * desktop is twice better , although primarily because our budget for that particular build is 200 000 ft ( a bit more than $ 1000 ) . 
  this card costs $ 35 , and i 'm already somewhat over my budget of $ 500 . 
  i mean , i 'm not gon na run crysis on the damn thing . 
  i want to be able to play minecraft well , and portal with a real framerate ( that is , 5 and over ) . 
  what do you suggest for such a low-budget build ? 
  ( preferably from newegg , and preferably with  = 1gb of memory ), 
  so , exactly what do i need to buy for cooling ? 
  the way i understand it , i need a cpu cooler , which needs thermal paste , both of which come with my cpu in my situation , and i also need any number of ventilators , typically cooler master , it seems . 
  i also obviously need a psu , which i suppose impacts cooling somehow ? 
  would someone please clarify this for me ? 
  my grandfather has commissioned me to build a pc for him with a budget of 200 000 huf , which is around $ 1000 . 
  he wants it to hold a few thousand emails at a time plus around a hundred pictures ; he will pipe them over to a usb if the hard drive fills ) , to play sound files at the highest possible quality , and to allow him to watch videos on a high-quality monitor . 
  he wants it to be long-lasting ( hence my choice of an ssd ) . 
  he wants to be able to hide the whole thing inside a displaced cabinet ( or `` spajz '' ) , with no wires showing . 
  we do n't have any preexisting parts . 
  a good monitor costs upwards of 50 000 ft. 
  here 's what i have so far ( i apologize for my lack of formatting ; i have only become familiar with this subreddit on the iphone , and do not know what it is supposed to look like ) :, 
  motherboard :, 
  processor :, 
  amd athlon ii x3 3.3 ghz ( he will become the fifth person i know , including me , to have owned one, 
  memory :, 
  hard drive :, 
  my initial choice was n't very good at all , but it should be an ssd, 
  graphics card :, 
  asus eah6450 silent/di/1gd3 ( lp ) radeon hd 6450 1gb 64-bit ddr3 pci express 2.1 x16 ( this is way darn overkill , i know ), 
  advice ? 
  we figure we 'll just buy the psu and case in hungary , so that the voltages are compatible and stuff . 
  i have been on a macbook for a couple of years now , and have gotten kind of fed up with the number of programs it wo n't run , and its pitiful graphics card ( 144 mb of vram ) which makes running minecraft slightly torturous and running portal literally impossible . 
  i switched out the ram a year or two ago from 2 gb to 4 gb , and around eight months or so ago i switched out the hard drive to a 500 gb 7200 rpm hitachi disk that recently failed on me . 
  i realized that it 's kind of ridiculous that my family has not a single windows computer in the house . 
  i decided to build one . 
  i was given a $ 500 budget , which i have now already overstepped ( that is , there 's no way i 'll finish the build under the limit , except if i drop the graphics card , which is not happening for the world ) . 
  i have ample mice inside the house ( they all happen to live in the garage ) , but for want of a keyboard , i think i will buy one of those highly-touted `` logitech wireless '' thingamabobs . 
  i have no need of a monitor , as i will simply plug it into the tv inside of my room with beautiful hdmi , and browse from the hammock facing it . 
  i have n't bought everything , yet . 
  what i have now is the processor , the motherboard , the ram ( stupidly a single stick , but i have no complaints ) , the wireless adapter ( sans the three 1/4 '' port antenn\u00e6 ) , and the hard drive . 
  here is my list of parts ( painstakingly typed by hand on an iphone , from what examples i can glean from the other posts ) :,

  should i get an aftermarket fan for this , and if so , how can i do this * really * thriftily ? 
  lololol so adminium olny super = amdins cacn mien, 
  just `` god blahblahbalh '' here , `` niggers blahblahblah '' there, 
  i 've heard this is possible with large worlds , but all the ones i 've generated are a hot/cold gradient .

  for the ram , dave 's computers is a tiny comp shop that has opened very recently in the neighborhood , right across from the five guys that has opened very recently in the neighborhood . 
  i must also admit , the cpu cooler and windows have n't actually been ordered yet . 
  but everything else has either [ already arrived ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hwgru.jpg ) or is on its way .
