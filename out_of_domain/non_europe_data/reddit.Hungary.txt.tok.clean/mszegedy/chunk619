  can i first put the fan that came with my cpu on it , and then later ( by some weeks ) switch it out for an aftermarket fan with a different paste , or will it be more effective just to wait for the aftermarket fan ? 
  ( never mind why , i 'm tired ), 
  lik seris guize, 
  exactly how does this affect my pc ? 
  how do i measure it ? 
  which is better , high or low ? 
  ( i assume high ; i do n't want my electricity flowin ' all over the goddamn place . ), 
  welp , all of my parts have arrived save for the case , the extra thermal paste , and two case fans . 
  i thought that at this point it would be fun to try to put it together `` on the tabletop '' , with lots of standoffs , of course . 
  i put it together with great care , the motherboard stood off by five bare [ staedtler ] ( http://www.staedtler.com/mars_plastic_gb ) erasers . 
  i switched the psu on , everything plugged in , and ... nothing !, 
  is this because i need to attach a system panel to the header , as well , and push the on button to turn everything on ? 
  is there a way to tell whether it 's working besides ? 
  pushing the `` open/close '' button on the dvd drive does nothing ; should i be worried ? 
  and no , i have n't actually checked whether it 's `` on '' by plugging it in to a screen . 
  the psu does make a bit of a faint buzzing noise when turned on and plugged in , though . 
  edit : also , here 's the breakdown if anyone 's interested :,

  i set up my computer , as far as i can tell , perfectly , on five staedtler erasers and a small table . 
  when i short the two bootup pins , it behaves exactly like a computer should , fans going and everything everywhere ... but no video , from any port , be they on my graphics card , or on my onboard video . 
  i have tried different ports on the monitor ( actually a tv ) as well ; they all read , `` no signal '' . 
  i have tried ( on my motherboard ) two hdmi ports , two dvi ports , and a vga port , and none work . 
  here is my build , for reference :,

  welp , you may have seen [ this thread ] ( http://redd.it/r1l8y ) . 
  i have now put the computer properly in a case , and the video still does n't work . 
  it shows all sorts of life signs , including a green pled , but i ca n't get it to display a damn thing . 
  help ? 
  edit : also , the motherboard speaker speaks nothing !, 
  and i 'm certain it 's the right way around . 
  nobody ever downvotes !, 
  this is my favorite part !, 
  everyone here is so amiable , but it astounds me how little downvotes occur here ... it 's unbelievable . 
  keep at it !, 
  the mods here are especially nice . 
  they participate in the discussion all the time , and i 'm just like , `` wow , a mod posted here with a compliment ! '', 
  with every single post . 
  they really take care of the subreddit , and are yet equal to its inhabitants as well . 
  the discussion is sane !, 
  all of the other places i 've seen where homestuck is discussed are completely off-the-wall , and abound with weird and rabid people . 
  but here , i get to listen to reasonable voices discuss a masterpiece with great love ... there are n't even any `` haters '' to dampen the discussion . 
  this has become my homestuck discourse source above any other !, 
  so , just a big thank-you to all you guys for making this subreddit so awesome . 
  thanks a lot , everyone !, 
  especially the mods !, 
  i do n't think this requires too much explanation , so i 'll just copy/paste :,
