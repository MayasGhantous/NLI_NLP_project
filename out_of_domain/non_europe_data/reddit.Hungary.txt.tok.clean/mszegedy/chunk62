  and if anyone starts drawing pictures of adamantine , i have them killed . 
  if you 're having trouble remembering things like which troll is which , i suggest you restart at the beginning of act 4 or act 5 . 
  it 's a joke . 
  wow . 
  second time this revelation was posted . 
  i downvoted the first one ; [ are you next ? 
  ] ( / dunkass ) [ ( this is what the refrance ) ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/sweetbroandhellajeff/?cid=023.jpg ), 
  ... was that because it 's a fetish ? 
  half hour ? 
  bitch , please . 
  you 're on * reddit * . 
  try 1025 instead . 
  i legitimately want to know whether this is true . 
  well , you were only making something worse . 
  okay , this is definitely . 
  you did n't have to delete it though , it 's not like a bit of lost karma matters in the grand scheme of things . 
  fuck , it misses the east coast entirely . 
  ca n't wait to move to berkely . 
  edit : turns out that the next annular solar eclipse that 'll happen there will be the same one that happens here , in 2023 . 
  that 's just great . 
  edit 2 : turns out that 's not as bad as sweden ( where i will be living by then ) ; the next annular solar eclipse there is in 121 years . 
  i 'll have seen the next transit of venus by then !, 
  much , much better !, 
  now that i can actually see the miner , i must let you know that his pickaxe-drawing-back movement seems a little jerky !, 
  very jerky , actually ; but i ca n't visualize it a better way , so i 'll just call it a good job . 
  i must find out more about masterwork . 
  you can never have enough shit in df !, 
  the day that it has every conceivable item ever is the day that it * still is n't finished * . 
  beautiful , heartwrenching . 
  thank you for underestimating me , it made me feel much better . 
  oh wait , who gives a shit . 
  link to a quickmeme mockup of post featuring almost-politically correct redneck ; steep karma gains because copying and pasting things together mutually amplifies humor . 
  it 's totally safe, 
  as long as we all know what it actually is !, 
  you 'll find it in the thread in the top submissions of all time . 
  start a new serial work , like a webcomic , or a band . 
  if it 's good ( and you have some decent advertising ) , then its fanbase will grow . 
  you , or someone else , can make a subreddit for this fanbase , and bam - a new reddit community is born . 
  yes . 
  there 's at least four other references it in homestuck , like [ she has the cargo ] ( / dunkass ) and [ he has the karma ] ( / dunkass ) . 
  neither of my examples are the big man . 
  both times , the object starts with `` kar '' , and the big man uses `` hass '' rather than `` has '' . 
  i do n't think dd would waste time letting people stroll around helping his enemies . 
  he 'd kill them straightaway . 
  i like it !, 
  will it wear off ? 
  this is because immigrants to your fortress are now historical figures * whenever possible * , and historical figures tend to have families , which they bring along with them . 
  so now immigrant waves are comprised of at least 50 % children , those bastards . 
  would n't you rather just have an automatic decay period , so that you do n't have to bother with that ? 
  or maybe even an applet that checks homestuck updates , and runs based on whether homestuck has been updated or not . 
  give me a break , i was in the middle of something important . 
  makes much more sense . 
  cool !, 
  where ? 
  it 's the gristwidget 's grist gutter , not gristtorrent 's . 
  i 'll bet some of that grist fell down that hole . 
  work on your capitalization !, 
  so do i. 
  i want this . 
  right now . 
  actually , i can summarize my feelings :, 
  take my money, 
  of course it is . 
  why would n't disney have built a * working * giant fire hydrant ? 
  ( note what follows isnt any form of music whatsoever ), 
  that thing will fucking streak over the entire nation, 
  its basically our own private spectacle, 
  a stellar goddamn script commisioned by uncle sam just for the residents of his personal pimp crib, 
  its like its forrest fucking gump tracking his ass in this huge ugly line all across the whole country, 
  whoring everyones eyeballs wherever he bothers to mosey , his transcontinental cruise making worldwide fucking headlines, 
  idaho will only be the goddamn jersey turnpike on its way to fucking new york, 
  its like its barely even worth mentioning, 
  dude has big plans, 
  i 'd rather [ sbahj : the bok ] ( / dunkass ) , or [ sbahaj : the bok ] ( / dunkass ) . 
  a popular one i 'd think would be [ sbhaj : the booc ] ( / dunkass ) ( [ sbhaj : the booce ] ( / dunkass ) ? 
  ) , or [ sbahj : the boonk ] ( / dunkass ) . 
  oh , and [ sbhahj : the boopck ] ( / dunkass ) . 
  [ sbhahj : the boopck : the shirst ] ( / dunkass ) . 
  yeah , same . 
  i believe it happens to everyone after a while . 
  hmm , it 's a bit clunky atm ( changing the flair after already having a flair does n't immediately update the flair , just after you reload the page ; it does , however , put that tag , in blue , after the post 's original tag ) . 
  but it 's not like i expected it to be perfect or anything !, 
  so what are the implications of this ? 
  the dwarf will pick any fight on the map ? 
  or is it more useful than that ? 
  i burn discs because , while i have this gigantic stack of 1 gb dvds i bought over half a decade ago , and is still completely usable and far from depletion , i have a single usb drive that is also from the same era . 
  it 's 16 mb . 
  ( once , i misread it as 16 gb , and tried to make it a bootable lion disk . 
  i could n't understand what was going wrong . ), 
  i had a slightly newer one that was , like , 4 gb or something , but it got damaged due to heat . 
  post it for more karma !, 
  or , the computer 's browsing history is completely nuked . 
  opt to do it from the command line , using cd and ls ( assuming it 's a unix-based computer ) . 
  that link in which your other comment was was actually quite good . 
  when did it have imps before prototyping ... ? 
  was there something in act 1 that i missed , on prospit or derse ? 
  what happened here ? 
  '' [ i told you about ** them ** stairs bro ] ( / dunkass ) '' ? 
  ... huh . 
  47 seconds dammit !,
