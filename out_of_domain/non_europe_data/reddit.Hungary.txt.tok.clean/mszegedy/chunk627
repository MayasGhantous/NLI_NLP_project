  slugs, 
  holy fuck there . 
  i 'm done . 
  have i forgotten anything important ? 
  it exceeds my expectations in every way . 
  i 'm very happy with it !, 
  [ obligatory pics ( sorry i 'm too busy to do part breakdown ) . 
  i know , cable management !, 
  that tape is so the thermometer keeps being oriented more or less the right way . 
  i honestly did n't think there 'd be that many people . 
  it 's going to be split up into three 45-minute sessions of ten kids . 
  my budget is essentially nil ... what 's the cheapest build i could go with that still demonstrates all the essentials ? 
  i may be able to rope rutgers into lending me some , but i 'm not getting my hopes up or anything . 
  i want to show them how to install a pci card as well ... 
  i thought , maybe a graphics card . 
  i might do a mini-itx thing , that already has wi-fi built in ... then again , perhaps a full atx is in order . 
  i also want to teach them how to install a 5.25 '' drive , and i 'm bringing the os in on a dvd anyway ( that fedora 16 dvd has n't seen a single lasting install yet , as it kept replacing my damn windows ) . 
  so , i put together this build just now :,

  most of these are , `` okay this is cheapest i 'll get that '' , but they were still carefully reviewed , even the dvd drive , which is only cheaper than anything else by one cent . 
  i was too scared to decide on a psu at all . 
  please , guys , what do you recommend ? 
  i do n't want this stuff to start failing all over the place ... 
  edit : and also what case ? 
  cheap , impressive-looking , and non-fiddly ? 
  is there even such a thing ? 
  edit 2 : aw hell the sempron does n't come with a cooler . 
  gog dammit ... 
  when i plug my ram into the cup holder the hard drive stops processing windows exel ; i cant axcess my acount bcuase fuck you, 
  i 'll be doing a short workshop with some fifth and sixth graders at the local science fair about building a computer , and i need some computers to work on . 
  i ca n't afford to spend several hundred dollars on a bunch of machines that will never be used again ; do you have any parts i could use ( the newer the better ; i want the methods they learn to be up-to-date ) ? 
  after my thread for my `` build a pc for 5th and 6th graders '' workshop , i decided that the best course of action to pay for the resulting pc was to hold a raffle !, 
  i do n't know whether this is feasible , yet , though . 
  who would be interested in this ? 
  here 's the build :,

  that am3 socket had a lot of potential , and the board is n't actually that bad . 
  if you swap out a few parts , you 've actually got a decent pc on your hands !, 
  okay , so i just built this beautiful amd computer with a tad outdated asrock mobo . 
  i did this in the confidence that asrock is the best brand for motherboards . 
  only now , having completed my build , have i learned that asrock is , in fact , inferior to gigabyte . 
  i checked the gigabyte boards , and , sure enough , they had several cheaper boards which far outstripped my own . 
  i 'm pretty happy with my setup ( a bit sad about the lack of sata3 , and of a spare pcie x16 port ) , but i do n't want to experience this again . 
  what is the best brand for every single kind of computer part ? 
  i have already established :, 
  - processors : intel ( although i personally like amd better ), 
  - motherboards : gigabyte, 
  - hdds : western digital ( and samsung ? 
  really ? ), 
  - psu : seasonic, 
  - cases : nzxt ( an opinion of mine i think this community shares ), 
  what else ? 
  the first time i installed portal on this computer ( essentially the entire reason i built it ) , it booted up excellently , and i played for nearly an hour . 
  then i tried to install fedora several times , which overwrote my windows , so i had to reinstall it . 
  i am running my most recent install of windows . 
  whenever i try to boot up portal , it plays fine for a minute or two , and the crashes and forces me to quit . 
  then i 'll get really glitchy video and applications crashing all over the place until i reboot the computer . 
  the only difference between this and the first install is that my bios is 1.20 , not 1.00 . 
  i have tried reinstalling both portal and my video driver . 
  does this sound familiar to anyone ? 
  if so , how was the problem resolved ? 
  so , my normally very tech-minded friend managed to break his last build ( what i got from him was '' [ something something ] cooler master [ something something ] shit psus '' ) , and this time around he 's going all-out . 
  he 's commissioned me as a friend to put it together . 
  [ and this is what i came up with . 
  ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/p/6srm ) he wants a 128-gig ssd ( but 120 is fine , like in my build ) , with 2 1tb hard drives , one for backing up to the other . 
  what he does , mostly , is program , play minecraft , crysis , everything by valve , and , most recently , battlefield 3 . 
  he wants 60 fps always , on his tri-screen setup ( i do n't know the resolution ) . 
  he wants to overclock his cpu by around 40 % , and his ram by \\* some * . 
  we both agreed that the lanboy air is the sexiest case for such a hardcore job . 
  is there anything that is in dire need of switching out , or can be paralleled or beaten for less money ? 
  ( he insists on the pair of gpus . 
  :d i mean how does he even have the money . ), 
  i 'm composing one for the string quartet plus a harpsichord based on a contemporary theme .
