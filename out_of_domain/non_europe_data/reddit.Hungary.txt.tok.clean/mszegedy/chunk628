  i have listened to a ton of them ( chiefly bach and vivaldi , shut up bach is baroque ) , but when i try to compose them i either feel it does n't fit the period or that i 'm plagiarizing another composer of the period . 
  what are some things that i should and should n't do ? 
  i 'm looking especially for tips for the third movement . 
  ( what i have is , three movements : fast , slow , faster , minor thirds at the end of scales are a no , start trills from the upper note , do n't make the cello too conspicuous , make sure to have at least one section with a violin solo consisting entirely of melodic sixteenth notes , and stick it between two repetitions of the main theme . ), 
  movement progression :, 
  here is my build :,

  it 's breadboard , and wo n't boot up . 
  that is , when i short the power pins , nothing works , not even the psu fans . 
  what 's wrong ? 
  here 's a list of things i have checked off :, 
  - ram in wrong slot, 
  - power switch on psu not turned on, 
  - ram not plugged in well enough, 
  - psu cable not plugged in well enough ( the psu end was n't plugged in well at first , but the computer still does n't work ) . 
  - cpu not installed correctly, 
  - atx cables not tight enough ( both mobo and cpu ), 
  - shorting the wrong pins ( read mobo manual , those are the pins , alright ), 
  - motherboard not on insulated surface ( it 's elevated by some foam peanuts ; before , it was on a wooden table ), 
  thoughts ? 
  edit : no , wait , the hard drive is a hitachi deskstar . 
  i know nothing about it yet , though . 
  edit : apparently , the formatted memory is 74 gb . 
  which makes it 80 i guess ? 
  i found a really good picture of dave for allegro vivace , an okay picture that fits the clockwork theme for andante , but i 'm having trouble finding a picture of dirk for the last movement , vivace grandioso . 
  does anyone know a good one for dirk that fits a concerto themed for the renaissance era ? 
  i 'd also appreciate a swap for andante . 
  if it helps , the concertanti for the latter are the violin and and cello , but predominantly the cello . 
  i 'd link the two that i have , but i 'm on an iphone and deviantart is veeeeeeery limited on it , and i have no desire to look up the links again through my messages . 
  it 's past 4 am and tomorrow 's a school day , anyway . 
  could it be that they 'll fix each other 's flaws ? 
  vriska 's flaws are arrogance and malice , while tavros ' are submission and hesitation . 
  and he 's a really sweet guy . 
  so maybe this is n't such a bad thing and gamzee 's created someone incredibly helpful ... ? 
  i 'm new to this subreddit , and i have a question about the formalities and courtesies observed here . 
  i made a post in [ this thread ] ( http://redd.it/sf3ly ) , stating something to the effect of `` tennant is still my favorite doctor '' . 
  my karma for that particular comment briefly dipped below zero , and is now 2 , with , i think , 4 downvotes and 6 upvotes . 
  my question is , did i get downvoted because no one fucking cares what doctor i like ( which i totally understand and agree with , i 'll make sure not to do it again et cetera ) , or because those people disagreed with me ( which is a cause i like less , but hey , the upvote/downvote system is what you make of it ) ? 
  the day this shows up as lowercase i will cry tears of jeb, 
  war, 
  i 've been a really bad end-user , and once brought in a dead home laptop that failed during the middle of class . 
  he fixed it up with disk warrior for free . 
  he rarely speaks besides , though , and i 've never seen him smile . 
  i have this feeling that i 'm inadequate as all hell . 
  i just wanted to say i 'm sorry !, 
  i do n't like some of the atheists on this site very much ; they can be a bit insulting and somewhat antipathetic towards theists in their words . 
  [ but i hate these fuckers who commented in the article from that other thread so much more that i had to make an entire self post out of it . 
  ] ( http://www.theblaze.com/stories/air-force-bows-to-atheist-complaints-will-remove-bible-requirement-for-on-base-lodging/ ) hopy shit , just reading these is making me want to give up my religion a hundred times more than anything i have read here . 
  i mean , seriously , if this is how christians represent themselves , then no wonder everyone here has a bone to pick with them !, 
  as a christian , it makes me so angry that these people would have the gall to say such things . 
  just , what the hell , christians ? 
  so , yeah , now i have a new level of sympathy for you guys . 
  just wanted to let you know . 
  i 'm catholic , and want to see if anything can make me see reason . 
  reading the bible end-to-end ought to do it , but i want to hear your story first . 
  hey , remember how i posted a while ago how i was going to have a workshop at the local science ~ ~ fair ~ ~ convention , and it was going to be about computers ? 
  it happened !, 
  and let me tell you , it was great . 
  first of all , i 'd like to thank eb86 for his donation of $ 60 and a dvd drive - it really helped ; the kids were very impressed by the breadboarding !, 
  i think it 's great that you 'll donate a substantial sum to someone you ca n't be sure of even exists , just because it 's for a cause that you care about !, 
  we need more people like you . 
  i assure you you have all my gratitude !, 
  eventually , we got four computers , none of which were especially modern : two dells from rutgers that i need to give back to them , one ibm thinkcentre from a friend that totally kicked ass ( but came without a hard drive ) , and my very own emachine ( unfortunately , its samsung spinpoint ( ? ), 
  died due to internal bleeding the day before the event , but at least the computer was functional and everything ) that was so old it did n't even have a cpu cable . 
  not having worked with such old computers before , i was all `` til about pata cables looking exactly the fucking same as floppy cables '' , but it was all sorted out . 
  the management even found someone to help me out , one of the local bus drivers ( who aspires to be a physics teacher in a few years ) , who was indeed very helpful throughout the entire event , helping the kids with their cables and overall making the entire operation run more smoothly . 
  so , the event itself . 
  a surprising number of people did n't show up : out of three classes of ten , i had seven-eight-seven people . 
  turns out that a lot of people just sign up for it because it 's free , and just decide not to go in the morning . 
  out of around 150 people , this was 30 or so . 
  we still had fun , though !, 
  due to time constraints , and one of the dells actually having an unremovable mobo and processor , i decided to cut out installing the cpu and its fan , as well as actually screwing in the psu ( i demoed it with my sister , who 's about their age , and it took her around fifteen minutes while i played yakety sax ) . 
  i showed it to them on my breadboard setup ( once again , thank you eb86 !, 
  ) , though , and they were all quite impressed . 
  i regret not having showed them an lga socket , though , which was in the thinkcentre ( how modern ! ) . 
  ah well , we did n't have time for that anyways . 
  every group built their own computer correctly , and did n't break anything . 
  however , due to a huge derp on my part with the system panel of one of the dells ( the same one with the unremovable processor fan ) , that one would n't turn on when you pressed the button . 
  i only found this out later , though , so this was a missed opportunity . 
  those groups were so sad when their computer did n't work !, 
  i felt so bad for them . 
  at one point , the superintendent himself showed up !, 
  understand , he is very obsessed with technology : he is the one who introduced smartboards into every classroom , plans to upgrade all school computers ( to * imacs * ) , and provide each student an ipad . 
  this probably is n't an entirely good thing , but it 's not like i run the school district . 
  anyway , he was * very , very * impressed . 
  apparently he was very enthusiastic about it to the arranger of the event . 
  two times was it when someone walked in , and i thought both were parents , so i 'm not even sure what he saw !, 
  but it 's all good , apparently . 
  the other thing that went slightly worse than according to plan was the packet i intended to distribute that told them how to build their own computer at home : it was never finishe and therefore never got distributed .
