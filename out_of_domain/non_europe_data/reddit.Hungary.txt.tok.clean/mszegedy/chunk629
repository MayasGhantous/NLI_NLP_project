  i have an insurmountable amount of work i need to do , all due on tuesday , so i just was n't able to do it . 
  but i suppose no one misses it !, 
  it 's too bad about it , though . 
  so yeah !, 
  that 's how cool the whole thing was . 
  everyone really enjoyed it !, 
  oh , and i got to keep the thinkcentre , and my ps/2 keyboard is still sitting in that darn classroom . 
  ** tl ; dr got canceled because of bomb scare **, 
  i 'm trying to find out more about this ibm thinkcentre that i now own . 
  this is extremely difficult though , as i am not in a position to check the model number or take pictures of the machine , the hard drve is corrupt but it will try to boot into it anyway ( and i ca n't figure out how to get into bios so i could change the boot drive to dvd ) , and no current model of thinkcentre even remotely resembles it . 
  it 's kind of an elongated black box , very flat and kind of thin on the sides but quite long depth-wise , like a dvd player . 
  it has a front panel , with a rigid plastic flap that opens down to reveal the button for the dvd drive . 
  all of the ports are located in the back . 
  near the front , on the sides ( like a pinball machine ) , there are two buttons , which , when pressed in unison , allow the top of the computer to open up . 
  at first , much is obscured by the drive bays , their carriage containing two sliding switches that unlock the drives from their position , but that section is mobile and can be tilted forward so that the drives and the front panel face down . 
  there is one 5.25 '' drive bay , one 3.5 '' drive bay ( for which i had to supply the hard drive myself ) , and one extremely thin , possible 2.5 '' one that contains a floppy drive with a curious pinless , headless ribbon cable . 
  underneath it ( when the carriage is in its proper position ) , there is the cpu , which is masked by a large copper heatsink without a fan . 
  the cpu is some sort of socket lga , a kind of pentium ht if the sticker on the case is to be believed . 
  the motherboard is unlike any i have seen before : it is elongated to fit the case , and is not perfectly rectangular ; instead , one edge on the sides curves around to make room for things such as the psu , located in the back right corner when facing the machine head-on . 
  the two ram sticks are apparently 512 mb each , and are definitely 240-pin ddr3 ( with no empty slots ) . 
  the pci slots are the most fascinating , as , on the motherboard itself , there is a single pci slot , but plugged into it vertically and screwed to the edge of the case is a card with two more on it . 
  i can only presume that that is considered part of the motherboard as well . 
  situated in the middle of the board are two sata ports , without anything around the initial male l connector to steady the sata connector itself . 
  for starters , can anyone tell me what form-factor the motherboard is ? 
  lenovo only lists `` small '' or `` ultra-small '' , which really tells me nothing . 
  or is this form-factor particular to the thinkcentre ? 
  in that vein , is it possible to upgrade that pci component to one with a pcie x16 slot ? 
  also , what kind of floppy drive is that ? 
  and is there any documentation on the bios so i could open that particular damn thing ? 
  any help is appreciated . 
  i have noticed that i do n't actually know any * bad * composers or pieces . 
  i mean , i know lots that i personally do n't care for , but not any that are * unanimously * agreed on to be terrible . 
  like , the kind that you go , `` turn it off turn it off '' to . 
  would someone please direct me to a set of composers or pieces that upon performance elicit the sole accompaniment of retching ? 
  it would be amusing to bring it up in topical conversation , and to sometimes unexpectedly put it in to hear pleading cries of `` turn this shit off ! '', 
  karma , please !, 
  so , i just told someone that i picture lopan like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ipo1y.jpg ) , but with pyramids instead of skyscrapers . 
  i think that would actually be really cool to see , but i ca n't draw for shit . 
  could someone please sketch this for me ? 
  i think we 'd all enjoy it . 
  i saw it mentioned once on this subreddit . 
  now that i have processor time to dedicate to folding@home, i 'd like to do this ; but i 've forgotten the seller 's name !, 
  anyone know about this ? 
  i came up with one , but am unhappy with it . 
  could we all get together and design a better one , and [ make this hapen ? 
  ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/sweetbroandhellajeff/?cid=005.jpg ) here is mine :, 
  we round up at least ten volunteers , but more ideally twenty or so . 
  call the number of people * n * . 
  they are each given a list of subreddits . 
  they each have the same list . 
  this list is comprised of * n * subreddits , each proportionally decreasing in population ( i.e. , the number of subscribers ) . 
  on a schedule , no two people doing the same subreddit at once , they will first research their subreddit assigned for the day for three hours , observing exactly what the community is most responsive to in terms of karma , and drawing a conclusion about what links the subreddit is most likely to upvote . 
  based on this knowledge , ** at the exact same time of day as all of the other posters who had previously posted in that subreddit , ** ( say , 6:00 pm utc-4 , though this is n't optimal ) , they will post a link based on that conclusion , and directly thereafter record the population of that particular subreddit . 
  after a week , the karma of that link will be measured and recorded . 
  this continues for * n * days ( not weeks at a time , obviously ) . 
  with the data recorded , we can do whatever the hell we want , i guess . 
  what i was planning to do , though , was put them on a scatter plot , with * x * being the population of the subreddit in which it was posted at the time it was posted , and * y * being the karma percentage of the arithmetic mean of the top twenty-five links of all time of the subreddit to which they were posted . 
  the hypothesis here is that the best-fit line will be linear , and will slope downwards . 
  we could use this data for other things , though , like analyzing how being a default subreddit affects its predictability . 
  we might have to adjust our sample subreddits for that , though , if we want any conclusive data . 
  this is a bad experiment for a number of reasons , even ignoring the logistical difficulties [ invovled ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/sweetbroandhellajeff/?cid=011.jpg ) in making it take place . 
  most obviously , is the karma of these links a valid indicator of the predictability of the subreddit ? 
  that is , ( as this does go by this name ) , * is the sole method of karma-whoring to appeal to the predictability of a subreddit ? 
  * we may need to define predictability better in order to answer this question . 
  and then , our second most obvious problem : what happens when the appointed volunteers are `` bad '' at either :, 
  determining what subjects a subreddit finds most appealing . 
  manufacturing links containing such subjects . 
  this can not be overlooked . 
  however , i think it would lead us to profound insight upon these people themselves , and we could discern archetypes , for those exhibit flatter lines on the graph described earlier , and those in possession of steeper lines . 
  then again , this works best for large sample sizes , something with which we are not priveleged here . 
  my main goal is to find the correlation between subreddit size and predictability . 
  is anyone willing to help ?

  hey / r/homestuck !, 
  a while ago , i posted about a terrain generator for a sburb roguelike . 
  now , the part of the terrain generator that picks properties is nearly complete !, 
  after one friday afternoon of applying myself , i came up with the ideal way to do it , and rendered it as code . 
  however , right now , i have only the skeleton of it : the actual program that does stuff . 
  the list of properties , terrain.sburb , is still cooking !, 
  it 's designed so that you , as a user , can easily edit what sorts of properties a planet can have for each category . 
  i 'll give you the lowdown , copied and pasted from my text file :, 
  you 've got the six variables light , heat , architecture , life , fantasy , and chaos , k ? 
  how it works is , based on all your statistics ( seed , class , aspect , items , and gm intervention ) , it generates a precise integer value , from 0 to 999 , for each variable . 
  then , for each category , in which each item has an exact value for any or all of the six variables as well , it finds the item ( s ) that match these values in the closest manner ( by plotting them six-dimensionally and taking the distance between the `` ideal '' and the object 's , assuming 499 for items that are n't there ) , and puts those for the category . 
  it treats all of phase 2 as a single category , and chooses the top five . 
  there is also a tag system . 
  some items have tags , like dry and glacier . 
  you can do two things with these : prefixing a tag like ~ tag with a tilde will make the generator thereafter refuse to pick up any items with tag . 
  prefixing a tag like + tag with a plus sign makes the generator * only * pick up items with tag . 
  if the generator receives multiple + commands , like + tagone and + tagtwo , then it will pick up * both * items with tagone * and/or * tagtwo . 
  one may also do ~ tag ( category ) and + tag ( category ) , which means that that command will only apply in that particular category . 
  if you want multiple categories , then you have to have ~ tag ( categoryone ) ~ tag ( categorytwo ) . 
  the third and final modifier \\* tag ( `` words '' ) sends the special message `` words '' to the generator , to be printed after any particular consequent instance of tag . 
  for example , * ice ( `` you wonder why it refuses to melt . '' ), 
  might be put after certain high temperatures ( given a high enough fantasy value , of course ) . 
  now , in this standalone version , you 'll get to define these values yourself , obviously , since there is no gm , you have n't taken on a class and aspect yet , and you have no room in which to place objects . 
  well , bottom line is , i 've got [ this huge list of properties ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/rp9d9/a_terrain_generation_paradigm_for_my_rpg/ ) , and i just realized that i actually suck at coming up with values , but especially descriptions for all of these . 
  like , check out the terrain.sburb that i used for testing :, 
  / / light ( l ) , heat ( h ) , architecture ( a ) , life ( v ) , fantasy ( f ) , chaos ( c ) !,
