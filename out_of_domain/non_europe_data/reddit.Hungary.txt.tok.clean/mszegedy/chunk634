  a few posts down in this subreddit , i read that the `` traditional '' route is to take engineering undergrad , then a `` bioengineering program '' . 
  however , i am actually a high school student interested in taking biomedical engineering as a major in undergrad , maybe a double major with cell biology or chemical engineering depending on where i go . 
  my question is , is this the best course of action ? 
  or should i do what , i infer , nearly everybody else does and do engineering first ? 
  i managed to go a long time oblivious to the albums , and '' [ s ] john . 
  rise up . '', 
  was the first time i heard `` savior of the waking world '' . 
  it was really amazing , and totally defined `` doctor '' for me for every iteration to come . 
  having heard `` savior of the dreaming dead '' already took away from '' [ s ] cascade . '', 
  for me , though , i think ( though holy shit that was a pretty amazing thing ; it was a bit hard to get excited about * homestuck * again after going for so long without it , but that flash drew me right back in ) , and having heard `` even in death '' positively nullified '' [ s ] roxy : sleepwalk . '', 
  for me . 
  similarly , '' [ s ] prince of heart : rise up . '', 
  came out the day after i decided to listen to the * strife * album literally over twenty-five times in a row . 
  it was still really awesome , though . 
  :d i was glad that they decided to use an unreleased pair of pieces for '' [ s ] jane : enter . 
  '' , and i was actually pretty elated that they used `` rain '' from the * medium * album for locah , since i had n't heard it in a while and it was pretty overdue ( `` ruins ( with strings ) '' was a pretty cheap shot , though ; it needs to be used in a bigger flash ) . 
  i am now sad that both the new flashes will , with all likelihood , use already-released music ; i am betting on something from the newest album for the first ; `` crystalmethequins '' would fit it , certainly , but i 'm hoping that that will be used in a more vriska-oriented flash , and am instead looking for something else in that album that 's flash-worthy ( it would be a shame if the second 8/9 of `` a taste for adventure '' never became part of a flash ) . 
  for the second one , i 'd be happy with `` revered return '' or the like , but i 'm straying off topic . 
  the point is , would you rather have already heard the pieces used in flashes when they are released , or would you rather that the music is new along with the flash ? 
  once this realization happens ( as it can happen with gifts , books in multi-book packages , not-very-careful purchases ) , what do you do with said book ? 
  assume you want to give it away . 
  how can you tell whether it is good for learning the material , if you do n't personally experience learning from it ? 
  on one hand , it 's really annoying when people `` karma-whore '' . 
  on the other hand , if someone says something inappropriate , irrelevant , unconstructive , etc. , downvoting them would discourage them from doing it again , because they are afraid of losing karma . 
  i think it boils down to the voters . 
  if voting genuinely puts good content at the top and bad content at the bottom , karma could be a good incentive to make good content rather than bad content . 
  however , if upvotes are easy to manipulate , and bad deeds go unpunished ( or worse , are upvoted ) , then we would rather have people disregard the karma system and do what they feel like doing . 
  as it stands , i think it 's the latter that 's the case . 
  maybe i 'm just pessimistic , though . 
  - what are cherubs , and what is their relation to lil cal other than resemblance ? 
  - why does calliope have sufferer cufflinks ? 
  - what universe do cherubs live in , and how did it come into being ? 
  - assuming lord english is caliborn , how did he acquire the sort of power that made him grotesquely muscular , have billiard-ball eyes , have green sun powers , able to travel to any point anywhere anytime , and able to crack the fabric of paradox space ? 
  what does it have to do with the green sun ? 
  - what are calliope 's and caliborn 's jujus ? 
  ( i 'm betting they have something to do with the previous mystery . ), 
  - how did the kids ' meteor end up on calliope 's and caliborn 's planet ? 
  - how did the juju chains system get installed in the meteor ? 
  - how did gamzee get godtier ? 
  - how did gamzee get into the b2 session before the meteor he was travleing on ? 
  ( or , how did he travel back in time to that point ? ), 
  - where does andrew hussie live , and how did spades slick and ms. 
  paint get there ? 
  vriska and tavros ? 
  - what 's lord english 's weakness ? 
  - how did the condesce hop between the b1 and b2 universes ? 
  for that matter , how did she get into universe b at all ? 
  ( this may already be answered in the form of lord english . ), 
  - who typed those commands into wv 's console before he got there ? 
  why was the station low on power ? 
  ( i 'm betting it was the condesce . ), 
  - how did minihoof get so tiny ? 
  - what are the p , t , and m in lopan , lotak , and lomax ? 
  what will their significance be ? 
  - are all those obliterated ghosts coming back ? 
  - is calliope coming back ? 
  does saying her name to lord english still work , assuming he 's caliborn ? 
  - what are all the names and faces of the a1 trolls ? 
  do we even care about that ? 
  as someone who wants to dedicate his life to the field ( medical phd , then research until i drop dead ) , i thought that this would be a pretty good question to ask . 
  here 's the copy/pasted criteria :, 
  - salary, 
  - major of highest degree, 
  - field, 
  - job position and/or brief work description, 
  - years of experience, 
  - highest degree ( bs , ba , ms , phd ), 
  - location, 
  - job satisfaction ( 1-10 ), 
  so , i posted a question to askreddit that went like this : [ as a european , i just went to visit the usa , and i thought it was totally okay . 
  reddit , what makes the usa so bad ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/xk9ly/as_a_european_i_just_went_to_visit_the_usa_and_i/ ) this was just a ploy to incite an anti-us circlejerk so that i could laugh at it , of course , but the response that i got was a bit unexpected in that my submission was downvoted and there were several comments haughtily telling me that i 'm basing my opinion on incomplete information . 
  i guess i should have expected this , but , well , i did n't . 
  it 's too bad , too , because the question was sort of in earnest !, 
  though i do n't really need askreddit to tell me what they think is wrong with america . 
  one comment sums it up very well :, 
   if we are talking about normal everyday life then the united states is a perfectly nice place to live ( depending on the area you live in , ymmv ) . 
  people are free to go about their day to day lives buying and consuming and doing , more or less , whatever they like . 
  it all seems wonderful . 
  however , once you take in to account things like the ever increasing inequality , a for-profit healthcare system that risks bankrupting people who get sick , a for-profit prison system , a public education system that continually lacks behind the rest of the developed world , ailing and failing infrastructure , the war on whistleblowers , the ever expanding surveillance state , sopa acta ttp and all the cyber security bills to follow , endless wars , dropping bombs on countries we are n't at war with , signature strikes ( and drone strikes in general ) , the war on drugs , the war on terror and a political class that cares more about arguing with each other than actually trying to fix any of this problems , or worse yet actually agrees that a lot of these things are ok or even noble efforts ( the war on drugs , the war on terror , war on whistleblowers , drone strikes to name a few ) you tend to become more than a little jaded about `` the greatest country in the world '' , to say the least . 
  i guess that 's really all there is to say on the matter . 
  what if it cost karma to make a comment ? 
  and you could n't vote on yourself ? 
  posts would begin with zero karma , and each additional karma point gained would go to a user 's `` karma bank '' ( essentially the current karma counter ) . 
  posting * another * comment would drain one karma point from that bank . 
  posting a link would drain more ; maybe five or ten points . 
  or you could choose to use link karma , for one link karma point per link post ( this might need improvement ) . 
  new users would begin with 10 karma , and your account will be deleted at -5 . 
  i think this would be an improvement , because it will motivate people to make posts that would be received better , and would completely stop `` negative karma whores '' . 
  the only cheap thing in this is that a person could delete some of their negative comments to regain karma , but that 's already a flaw in the system anyway . 
  thoughts ? 
  the first part ( link at bottom ) has the introduction . 
  enjoy !,
