  ~ ~ pieces that i remember having been used in flashes will have a [ [ s ] ] ( / gt ) next to them . ~ ~ ^ to ^ be ^ added . 
  as a general rule , melodies are named after the first piece that included them , unless they have enough remixes to have an associated name ( examples include `` clockwork '' , `` crystal '' , `` ebonpyre '' , `` sburban '' , and `` skaia '' ) . 
  pieces with unique melodies will not be listed , and neither will melodies with only two pieces to their name . 
  one piece may be listed under multiple melodies , even if these melodies are only present for a moment . 
  in order to propose the addition of an entirely new melody , you must show me at least three examples of it .
