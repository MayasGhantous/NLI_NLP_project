  see , his last name is english , and he has lord english gear , and apparently he 's supposed to be a killer , and dae know what a male noble is ? 
  lord . 
  lord english . 
  my logic is irrefutable !, 
  i 'm bilingual , speaking hungarian and english . 
  my family also speaks both languages , and we employ code-switching a lot to talk about terms best conceptualized in either language . 
  recently , i have spoken this sentence : `` hol van itt a * recycling * ? '', 
  the former hungarian part means `` where is there here the '' , and so the whole question means , essentially , `` where 's the recycling here ? '', 
  when i speak either language , i use their own phonologies : `` recycling '' was pronounced the american way , while the hungarian was pronounced the hungarian way . 
  except . 
  * except . 
  * in hungarian , primary stress is always on the first syllable of a word . 
  whereas , in english , stress is n't exactly lexical , but definitely much more complicated . 
  ( you can probably tell me exactly what it is . ), 
  when i said `` recycling '' , i was n't putting the stress on the middle syllable , like an english speaker . 
  i was putting stress on the * first * syllable , like in hungarian !, 
  the important thing is that i * did n't notice it . 
  * i thought i was speaking completely correct english !, 
  so , my question is : when people communicate with code-switching , have there been similar instances observed where speaking languages in succession has unconsciously altered their understanding of the grammar or phonology of one or another ? 
  here , syllable stress rules `` leaked '' from one language to the next . 
  what sorts of similar things happen , when , and how frequently ? 
  the atheism jerk ( not just confined to / r/atheism , but also / r/childfree , / r/worldnews , and pretty much everywhere else ) seems quite fond of these lately . 
  apparently , being atheist ( and any other neckbeard quality , like childfree , drugfree , debtfree , relationshipfree , petfree , et cetera ) demonstrates * more * of these than not having these . 
  point is , mentioning critical thinking skills an increasingly popular way of feeling superior to people with different opinions , lifestyles , and beliefs than you . 
  it 's the kings ' sceptres as well . 
  it 's clear that lord english has a version of one of these . 
  but , while the orbs ( in the middle ) of the kings ' sceptres point to skaia , lord english 's points to the green sun . 
  what 's this imply ? 
  well , for one , he gets the green sun powers from the sceptre . 
  but it might explain some other things as well . 
  but i 'm not sure what ...

  i keep the ashes deep in the ruins which is where i think she liked it best . 
  ] ( / sgt ), 
  unless he means the ruins of his former house , then there is no way his kernelsprite is coming into contact with those ashes . 
  the temple ruins were n't taken into the medium with him , the derse transportalizer to it was blocked in the avalanche , and i really doubt that he 'd bring the sprite all the way over to prospit and back to earth . 
  how would that even work , temporally ?

  it 's kind of ridiculous . 
  here are some choice excerpts :, 
   reddit is beautiful because it 's a solace , self-regulating solace which bans stupidity and encourages all those qualitites of humans our race seems to forget about . 
  it 's like in the old days of the internet when it was still a bit too hard for children to operate in those artificial environments : islands full of experts , people passionate about their hobbies , people willing to talk and exchange opinions without all those damn , crazy qualities of modern internet users : self-absorption , mindless hate and spite , envy , etc. , etc. 
  `` experts , people passionate about their hobbies . '', 
  does he mean neckbeards passionate about it ? 
  what ? 
   what i mean is that reddit is the only place i know which stays free from overwhelming stupidity and is filled with people who not only think and create but are willing to think and create . 
  not `` create '' in terms of art but ... to create something of value : something distinguishable in the constant flood of lowered standards that the internet has to offer . 
  and by `` something of value '' he means memes , right ? 
  and by `` create '' , he means repost , right ? 
   there was a guy in the / r/gaming subreddit who posted a photo of his girlfriend in a sexy cosplay outfit . 
  posting this anywhere else he would get a shitstorm of `` show us her tits now '' and stuff like that but instead he was asked some decent , relevant questions ( `` would n't you feel weird knowing that every male is going to look at your girlfriend 's ass at this comiccon that you 're headed to ? 
  '' , `` would n't you be jelaous ? '' ), 
  and plenty of enocuragment for his girlfriend for doing this . 
  someone even said that she 's very pretty . 
  pretty , that was the word . 
  how often in this world of extreme words , the internet , do you hear that anything is ... just pretty ? 
  clearly he is too idealistic about the motives of redditors .
