   am i the only one that hates this meme ? 
  the rest is just a harmless nostalgia-jerk . 
  `` reddit , what controversial opinion do you hold ? '', 
  threads end up being the same opinions , over and over . 
  i want to see some fresh answers . 
  redditors tend to hold a lot of opinions that are controversial to the general population . 
  this is never a surprise . 
  instead , i want to find out opinions that you think would meet * genuine disapproval * here . 
  to restate the question , reddit , what opinions do you hold that are controversial * on reddit * ? 
  i am not a fan of image macros . 
  i also dislike xkcd . 
  edit : i am also byzantine catholic , but i do n't think this is an especially controversial thing to say . 
  i create and man an account named / u/theuntroll . 
  ( check ), 
  use this account to compliment other redditors , and make them feel generally good about themselves . 
  gain recognition and belovedness until i am effectively reddit 's best friend . 
  let it slip , maybe during an ama or something , that despite how nice i am , i have never made a single donation , for lack of money . 
  allow a redditor ( maybe a sockpuppet if no one else comes forward ) to suggest the idea for reddit to raise money for me to donate . 
  raise a ridiculous amount of money , maybe $ 800k or so . 
  host a vote on what charities to spend this on . 
  donate money in some distribution to the top 10 or 15 charities that get voted . 
  i have a few ideas for the distribution ; if * x * is the rank of the charity , then donate 1/2 ^ ( * x * + 1 ) of the money to it . 
  or , if * n * is the number of charities we 're donating to , then each charity gets * x * ! / * n * !, 
  of the money . 
  success !, 
  step down as the untroll , claiming that reddit has gotten in the way of your life . 
  ( probably true . ), 
  if so , do you live in miskolc , or near it ? 
  i know of two fans in this country that exist : myself , and a youtube user named [ fromhungarywithlove ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/fromhungarywithlove ) ( coincidentally , or maybe not coincidentally , also the name of [ an obscure anecdotal book about hungarian corruption ] ( http://www.libri.hu/konyv/magyarorszagrol-szeretettel.html ) ) . 
  maybe ... just maybe ... there 's one or two more ? 
  sorry for not following up with a story , but i do n't think i 've ever done anything particularly extraordinary for someone . 
  :( there 's always time , though , and i certainly want to !, 
  so , i was rereading john 's spiel about captchalogue codes , and once again noticed the part where he states that `` simpler codes will produce more complex items '' . 
  by this , he means that when you & & items , they will trend towards a card completely devoid of holes , and when you | | them , they will trend towards a card completely saturated with holes , and both of these operations make more complex items than the ones they were initially supplied with . 
  based on john 's definition of `` simple '' , i 've created a measly compression rule for storing the information of cards . 
  it 's as follows :, 
  there is one initial bit , and this determines which card you 're using as a template : 0 for blank , 1 for all-punched . 
  imagine the 64 possible holes as numbered from 0 to 63 . 
  using 000000 for 0 , 000001 for 1 , 000010 for 2 , etc. , list all of the holes that are exceptions to the template card ; i.e. , they 're unpunched if it 's a 1 card , or punched if it 's a 0 card . 
  keep doing this until you 've listed all of the exceptions . 
  and then you 're done !, 
  best-case performance is an all-blank or all-full card , which is 1 bit . 
  worst-case is a card that 's 32 punched , 32 blank , which takes 193 bits to store . 
  this rule is better than the usual 64-bit compression when the number of punched holes is either 0-10 or 54-64 , or 184,144,458,889 / 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 , or roughly a millionth of a percent of the time . 
  pretty bad !, 
  i 'm sure that there 's a way to improve this , but i would n't bother with it . 
  i hardly know a thing about computational science anyway . 
  edit : i 'm an idiot , the number i quoted for the amount of times that it works should be twice that . 
  so , slightly less shy of two millionths of a percent , or one in fifty million . 
  it still sucks , though . 
  damara is a breed of sheep , and was suggested for aradia . 
  she 's the megido ancestor . 
  the wiki also says that she 's the witch of time , but i do n't know where that was ever stated . 
  mituna was suggested for sollux . 
  it means `` couple '' in sanskrit . 
  ( thanks , / u/vantaskarkat ! ), 
  he 's the captor ancestor . 
  meulin was suggested for nepeta . 
  also , it 's phonologically similar to the word `` mew '' , a sound that cats are known for making . 
  she 's the leijon ancestor .
