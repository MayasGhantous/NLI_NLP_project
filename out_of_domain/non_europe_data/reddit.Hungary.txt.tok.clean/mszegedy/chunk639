   this has nothing to do with gay rights . 
  downvoted . 
  [ next one 's a pun , thankfully not followed up with a pun thread  ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/z5zti/science_gives_me_a/c61qnq4 ),

   ok , that 's just tachy . 
  and the rest is similarly mixed , about 4/5 complaining and 1/5 puns . 
  but most mindbogglingly of all , it has 1,322 upvotes . 
  like a lot of other posts , it illustrates very well the disconnect between the commenters and voters . 
  all of the people with * voices * are railing against it ... but the * voters * frontpaged it . 
  how does this happen and how can we measure it ? 
  it seems that this new round of trolls corresponds much less ( if at all ) to their astrological signs , instead focusing on mirroring their roles as ancestors , to some extent . 
  the post-scratch trolls corresponded very well with their signs : vriska was spider-themed , equius was horse-themed , karkat was crabby all the time ( heheheh ) , nepeta was cat-themed , terezi was obsessed with law , et cetera . 
  but these new ancestors have very little , if anything at all , to do with their signs . 
  kankri has nothing to do with crabs , in any vague form whatsoever . 
  latula could n't care less about law . 
  aranea has nothing `` spidery '' about her . 
  porrim stays somewhat relevant to her sign by being its opposite , being promiscuous as opposed to celibate . 
  the best case can be made for meenah , who goes around making fish puns , but even this is somewhat out of obligation to her being a seadweller . 
  rather , the characters were dictated much more by their post-scratch stories , aside from maybe aranea and latula . 
  porrim goes around talking to everyone in a motherly but also slightly flirtation fashion ( see the instances when she told karkat he had `` said all [ he ] needed to say '' , or when she fussed about kankri 's sweater ) . 
  kankri is , besides being a hilarious walking parody of the social justice warriors on tumblr , also definitely the type who would be aghast at alternian culture and would try to go around gaining disciples and teaching everyone about equality ( and later dying for their sins ) . 
  meenah is full of self-esteem and likes shiny things of great monetary value . 
  she seems exactly like someone who would take the role of the absolute ruler of alternia , where she could effect any change she desired instantly , rather than the ornamental role on beforus that she regarded as being a `` glorified slave '' . 
  this change is n't , of course , for the worse . 
  we want * new * characters , not ones that are similar to the old ones in some superficial and boring way . 
  a new take on the signs would of course be cool , but not necessary . 
  in some ways it 's best that andrew has decided to depart from that template . 
  sorry for the circlejerky title , but really wow . 
  i think hating children for essentially this reason is , at some not-entirely-deep level , because the redditors * identify * with the child and expect him/her to conform to their neckbeard norms . 
  it 's like `` why is this person so stupid , le faith in humanity lost '' but with the lowest-possible-hanging-fruit . 
  and what infuriates them even more is * every * child is like this !, 
  it 's , like , an entire sort of people that 's * all stupid * !, 
  and for some reason * everyone likes them * !, 
  this registers as exceptionally unfair for le poor and misunderstood redditor neckbeards , so much smarter than everyone else and yet so disliked . 
  no wonder they hate them . 
  edit : also , despite all this , they are too lazy to have a child and * teach * it , attempt to improve what they perceive as bad character . 
  shitty_watercolor , shitty_watercolor , shitty_watercolor !,

  [ the post in question . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/zwmop/he_who_does_not_reason/ ) it 's kind of like a parody , really : the word `` reason '' is the biggest and most conspicuous out of all . 
  this continues to justify the common practice of ironically saying `` atheism = = logic/reason lol '' . 
  so , to get the thread started , the top post [ mocks `` fundies '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/zwmop/he_who_does_not_reason/c68ckbf ) , and is followed up by a thread tangentially about satanism but mostly dominated by [ some sort of novelty account that spouts logical fallacies and acts like it invalidates your argument . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/logicusfallacious ) the next thread is some nitpicking about the sort of picture the quote is embedded on . 
  i do n't mind this that much . 
  then there is [ a comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/zwmop/he_who_does_not_reason/c68g0jb ) that provides a short rebuttal , but then gets followed up by [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/zwmop/he_who_does_not_reason/c68ivvi ) implying that you can be rational about most things but not religion . 
  and then we have the usual [ `` i am a christian and i totally agree with this '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/zwmop/he_who_does_not_reason/c68gf4j ) , but then adds , `` how is this related to atheism ? 
  '' , which gives the ratheists as opportunity to smugly tell him that `` because religion is irrational '' . 
  fortunately , the [ top reply ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/zwmop/he_who_does_not_reason/c68hpzo ) is completely decent , and for once [ the neckbeard ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/zwmop/he_who_does_not_reason/c68gvem ) is downvoted . 
  then some [ circlejerk posts ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/zwmop/he_who_does_not_reason/c68gfzt ) that no one needs . 
  the rest are essentially dissenters mocking the post , except [ this quote thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/zwmop/he_who_does_not_reason/c68hfes ) . 
  a quote thread !, 
  i find its existence very interesting . 
  i 'm not actually angry about anything in here , so sorry that i could n't mock it with a bit more vitriol , but it 's still a premium example for the ways in which / r/atheism * still * resembles a logic/reason circlejerk . 
  hooray ? 
  nowadays i feel that every post in here is just a karma grab . 
  ya know ? 
  i suggest we try putting actual content in here . 
  the people who were polluting the sub previously ( everyone but you ) are stupid bigots , and from now on you should downvote them . 
  they do n't deserve to be in our sub . 
  we are an accepting and intelligent community , so really they can just go fuck off . 
  if you make a comment in this thread pointing out what i just said , you will get upvoted to the top . 
  feel free to ignore everything i said starting tomorrow . 
  they 'd be cool , useful , and , above all , fun . 
  i ca n't figure out what the refrance . 
  it would be useful , because i broke my hand and ca n't write numbers for a while . 
  so , i have a modeling program that goes as follows :, 
  pick a natural number ( a large one like 5,000 or so ) , name it * n * . 
  pick a variable * k * . 
  this starts out as zero . 
  * n * times :, 
  perform a series of bernoulli trials with * p * probability until one of them comes back false . 
  increment * k * by however many bernoulli trials were successful . 
  my problem is , how much does * p * need to be exactly in order for * n * = e [ * k * ] ? 
  1/2 turned out to be too little , and 0.55 to be too much . 
  initially i thought it to be e ^ -1 or e ^ -1 / 2 , but that 's about 0.38 and 0.607 respectively . 
  i 'm using 0.51 currently , but it still seems like it 's just a little bit not enough . 
  can anyone help ?
