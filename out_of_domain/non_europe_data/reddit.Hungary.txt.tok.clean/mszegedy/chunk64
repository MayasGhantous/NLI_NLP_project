  actually , language in general is . 
  ambiguity is just a byproduct . 
  i also do n't like lojban in general , but i might be able to express exactly why when i do so when i 'm more well rested . 
  '' [ schizobrother ] ( / u/schizobrother ) '' , methinks . 
  in / r/environment . 
  [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/triqr/in_the_last_few_weeks_beekeepers_have_reported/c4p8xsn ), 
  i do n't get it . 
  what motivates people to keep clicking links ? 
  woops , sorry , did n't mean to delete my comment . 
  it was something along the lines of `` no . '', 
  [ if you end it in 1 , then the second digit will also be 1 . 
  i guess then it just does n't work on me ? 
  i 've read through entire definitions without clicking on a link . 
  this is why when my sister reads homestuck , it is always under my close supervision . 
  she is currently at the first page of the intermission . 
  ( the intermission . ), 
  there is definitely enough of that . 
  this . 
  i choose to believe this . 
  how do you know the post was n't edited ? 
  the asterisk only appears if the post was upvoted in the time between posting and the edit , and/or it 's been three minutes . 
  maybe it 's comparable . 
  chest or double chest ? 
  / r/karmaconspiracy is `` op did it for the karma '' , not `` op did it for the pun '' . 
  plato ? 
  why not hofstadter ? 
  a tunnel ? 
  not a bridge ? 
  ( the two philosophies !, 
  mining , or crafting ? 
  i 'd say mining ; it 's more profitable . ), 
  you can even fly through it . 
  is this a biblical reference ? 
  *** the *** ** intermission . 
  you lied !!!, 
  obviously a butthurt fundie ; your imaginary sky fairy is telling you not true things , do n't spread the lies . 
  by sagan , it does !, 
  sorry , just the first one was already submitted and i could n't submit it !, 
  hey , the other person with the sgrubarrow !, 
  it 's a link to a recent sbahj comic . 
  i would n't be surprised if it really had been submitted . 
  it does n't ; it only makes it so that it only affects mobs ( including the player , tnt , minecarts , etc. ) . 
  but area damage , yeah . 
  wait , i do n't get it . 
  is this guy vechs ? 
  because tnt when put down is a block . 
  if the tnt is activated , then it 's a mob , and it can be affected . 
  hence , tnt cannons . 
  i am overcome with an overwhelming impulse to play this map . 
  like , it just blew my mind so completely that i can not put my opinion into words in english . 
  just ... fucking incredible . 
  when is it coming out ? 
  huh . 
  so , then , tinyurl is okay for obfuscating reposts to reddit ? 
  why are people downvoting this guy ? 
  the ipad version is really free ? 
  news to me . 
  yeah , entity . 
  :d it was much simpler back when everything that move was called a sprite ... 
  [ thread . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/o9sjl/idea_random_ores/ ), 
  okay . 
  by four hours ? 
  not having seen the antecedent link , i literally ca n't think of any other way to interpret this . 
  that just makes it better . 
  as one with a severe speech impairment : stammer and stutter are n't synonymous . 
  when someone stutters , they repeat syllables or parts of words . 
  when someone stammers , the word does n't come out at all ; you just have this huge fucking tension in your throat , and sit there , opening your mouth like a goldfish , and people think you 're stupid and have forgotten what to say next . 
  i took an acting class , and was often told that i needed to put more effort into memorizing my lines . 
  what do you mean ? 
  it fits like a glove . 
  the nearest microcenter to me is over an hour away . 
  :( i only go there on special occasions . 
  also : [ i have the card ] ( http://mspaintadventures.com/sweetbroandhellajeff/?cid=007.jpg ), 
  ( meaning , my card has the same chipset ! ), 
  i 'd say , just count the lexemes , approximating `` which one has the biggest dictionary '' . 
  i 'd count german , and other similar agglutinative languages , as having a theoretically infinite number of lexemes , under that rule , though . 
  so , instead of just `` the number of lexemes '' , count `` the number of lexemes used by at least .001 % of the speaking population '' , or something similar . 
  pretty impossible to actually count , but that 's demographics for ya . 
  i love how you got 63 karma for a single , lowercase , extremely commonly-used character . 
  :d karma-to-character ratio for you = 63:1 ; i have a similar amount , but it 's eight characters , so k : c = 8:1 . 
  much less efficient . 
  no , i 'm with you here . 
  this seems the most plausible . 
  might explain the blood thing as well . 
  although their dreamselves clearly have independent blood colors . 
  what does `` soylent '' mean ? 
  i did n't get that title for that particular theory , and do n't see how hussie could be alluding to it either . 
  especially mops . 
  * all along !, 
  he 's about to fuck aome shit up for those drones , not betray dirk . 
  however , your interpretation is really just as valid a way to look at it . 
  thanks for opening up my mind !, 
  now i eagerly await to see the next update of him . 
  it does n't have to be a weird sexual ritual . 
  maybe they do n't even have any control over it . 
  but yeah , the rest was the conclusion that i came to myself . 
  because he laughed at this horribly scarring ponography , or because he never laughed out loud at homestuck before ? 
  how have you never laughed out loud at homestuck ?
