   your comment hurts because there is a large section of the population that sees that as a fact and not sarcasm .

  further down in that comment thread we also have [ this gem ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1n7bh5/the_curiosity_rover_just_found_water_on_mars/ccg75fo ) , as a bonus . 
  elsewhere we find people with the uncanny ability to predict the future ( and bonus eugenics jerk ) :, 
   [ immortality ] would never be know to more than a few . 
   humans need to either die , or stop breeding . 
  i 'd gladly lose the lads for immortality , but they ai n't going to offer to serialized the world .

  at 33 points , we have a fairly innocent but still very erroneous top comment :, 
   please please please please please find some kind of microbial life next . 
  neither the shitstorm that would generate or the kick-start that would give space exploration in general can be in any way understated .

  this person also has the ability to predict the future . 
  the space exploration that it would kick-start ca n't be overstated ( presumably what he meant to say ) ? 
  no , i think it can be very overstated . 
  if i said that it would directly motivate us to land a person on mars , i 'd be overstating it . 
  just ship up a few probes with a couple tools ( e.g. 
  microscopes , centrifuges ) , and it 's a done deal . 
  i do n't want to devolve into predicting the future myself , but let me say that there is no profit in analyzing mars microbes ( unless one of them happens to turn carbon dioxide into crude oil , and breeds well , but we 've already got those ) . 
  space travel is not automatically going to get so much more funding because they 're there . 
  i am tired of this thread . 
  look through it for yourselves . 
  recently , i 've been building a very very big ship ( intended to go to eve and back in a single launch , using only stock parts ) , and about 19/20 of it is made of struts . 
  ( i 'm actually not sure how much of it is struts . 
  i 'll count it up at the end of this post . ), 
  unfortunately , there is a bug that makes the struts not connect to stuff , and makes the parts that they are attached to not selectable . 
  more importantly , this affects my fuel lines , too . 
  a severe case of strut insubstantiation syndrome can be treated by reattaching a base part , but this does n't bring all the struts ( and fuel lines ) back . 
  is there any way to alleviate this ( other than removing parts ) ? 
  would waiting for 0.22 fix this ? 
  ^ ( how many struts ? 
  well , the part count is about 2300 . 
  i have 50 orange tanks , 42 mansails , 2 quad-couplers , 80 double-length normal-size tanks , 40 atomic rockets , 1 large decoupler , 9 small decouplers , 8 large rcs tanks , 40 linear rcs ports , 50 rcs thruster blocks , 3 small rcs tanks , 1 command pod , and 4 radioisotopic generators , making a total of 330 parts that are n't struts or fuel lines , making a total of about 1900 parts that are either struts or fuel lines ( i overestimated the initial part count ) ^ ) ^ ( or about 85 % struts or fuel lines . ), 
  i 've never been good at making tugs . 
  my last tug that actually worked had a skipper in the middle ringed by eight atomics , and the skipper drew from the atomics ' fuel supply . 
  i did that pretty idiotically . 
  anyway , i 'm designing a new tug now , which has to push about five orange tanks ' worth of mass . 
  it is nine half-orange tanks arranged in a square . 
  i put nine skippers on it because those have relatively good isp and a lot of thrust . 
  my question is , would i be better off replacing the skippers with four atomics each ? 
  it sure would use less fuel ( i think , i have n't checked the stats ) but is the poor t/w going to throw it off ? 
  unfortunately i ca n't afford to make the tug much heavier , because my lifter is struggling as it is . 
  a lot of people have said that i advance through ksp really fast . 
  here is a catalog of the first 24 hours :, 
  - 0:00 - 1:00 : find out how to make things that get off the ground, 
  - 0:10 : build some sort of weird cross out of girders that moves across the ground because of fidgety girders, 
  - 1:00 - 4:00 : try to get to orbit, 
  - 3:00 : discover that i do n't need to cover my rocket in wings to keep it stable, 
  - 4:00 - 6:00 : give up getting into orbit ; successfully go to mun instead ( but not back ), 
  - 4:30 : discover that kerbin rotates with respect to mun, 
  - 6:00 - 12:00 : try to retrieve people from mun ( no survivors ), 
  - 8:00 : decide i need a rover to accomplish this, 
  - 11:00 : blow up my fourth rover model, 
  - 12:00 : run out of kerbals to retrieve, 
  - 12:00 - 18:00 : try to build a space station, 
  - 13:00 : dock two things together, 
  - 13:00 - 15:00 : try to dock two more things together, 
  - 18:00 : add tenth part to space station , get bored, 
  - 18:00 - 24:00 : try to build big space ships, 
  - 19:00 : discover asparagus staging, 
  - 19:10 : discover struts, 
  - 20:00 - 21:00 : finish first lifter , fly it to duna, 
  - 21:00 : realize i can go bigger, 
  - 21:30 : finish second lifter ; realize it looks like a swastika, 
  - 22:00 : finish third lifter, 
  - 22:00 - 24:00 : land on eve , duna , and laythe using third lifter, 
  landing gear : girders attached to girders, 
  radial parachutes : radially attached girders with parachutes attached to them, 
  batteries : more command pods, 
  reaction wheels : more command pods, 
  got any more ? 
  it is surprisingly hard to find this out via the internet . 
  did they do anything notable in that time ? 
  `` jesus , has the mansail always been * that * huge ? '', 
  i left bill stranded on laythe , and i want him back . 
  i once saw really good instructions for landing precisely at the space center on here . 
  after reading it , i felt like i could do a precision landing everywhere . 
  unfortunately , i forgot everything in it . 
  i can not find those instructions anymore , so could anyone please give me a rundown on how to land at a particular marked site that you want ? 
  i am tired of my calculator screen being grey and having a tiny resolution and not being big enough to show to many people at once . 
  so what i am doing is creating a teaching tool : a raspberry pi plus a teeny-tiny bluetooth keyboard plus batteries plus a projector ( or maybe screen ? ), 
  plus mathematica , strapped to one 's wrist . 
  my question is , what projector or screen do you recommend ? 
  i am leaning towards using a projector , and there 's some great ones on the market , but those have abominable battery lives , and a screen would have a higher resolution . 
  do you know any tiny screens or projectors that might fit the job ? 
  i am thinking that this device is roughly 15 cm lengthways ( the length of the keyboard ) . 
  its bottom has more drag than its top , so it always faces prograde on atmospheric entry , until the parachutes open and the whole thing flies apart from the shock . 
  it 's too late for a redesign . 
  when changing the syle of my xfce , two of my panel applets , cpu graph and notification area , remain white , despite my theme being black . 
  what is causing this and how do i fix it ? 
  i 've been thinking about doing something like this for a long time , and my schedule 's cleared up enough that i might be able to get all the materials ready by february or so . 
  a course on proteins , about 12 weeks long . 
  - this is not `` introduction to proteins '' , or `` proteins i '' , or `` protein structure and function '' , just whatever about proteins that fits into 12 weeks . 
  - topics discussed would be :, 
  - how proteins are organized, 
  - what kind of different proteins there are,
