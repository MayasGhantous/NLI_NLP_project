  - important proteins, 
  - how proteins evolve, 
  - and of course by what mechanism they complete their jobs, 
  - i 'm also thinking of including a minimal amount of material about irl tools used to examine/study proteins, 
  - all of the lectures would be recorded in advance ; the most i can do input-wise after the course has started is answer questions about the material and set deadlines for quizzes . 
  - the course would be based on * how proteins work * by mike williamson . 
  ( which is really expensive to buy for oneself . 
  part of my motivation for making this course is to make part of that material available for free . ), 
  - background knowledge would be basic chemistry : what acids and bases are , how atoms bond to each other in organic molecules . 
  what would be useful to know but is explained in supplemental material is the central dogma of molecular biology : transcription and translation and such . 
  is anybody interested in this ? 
  i mean , tiny molecular machines are interesting , right ? 
  edit : does 15 upvotes mean 15 people would want to join ? 
  i 'd need a lot more than that , for this amount of work ... 
  i 'd say at least 30 dedicated people is good enough for me, 
  i know you guys think about proteins in a completely different context than biologists , but i figure that this is worth a shot . 
  i am a biomedical engineering grad student studying proteins , and i want to teach a / r/universityofreddit course on them . 
  besides being a ( presumably ) important component of one 's diet , they 're also the very fascinating tools that cells use to make chemical reactions happen , store molecules , hold your body together , and many other things . 
  i 'd be covering that aspect of proteins . 
  some things to note about the course :, 
  - this is not `` introduction to proteins '' , or `` proteins i '' , or `` protein structure and function '' , just whatever about proteins that fits into 12 weeks . 
  - topics discussed would be :, 
  - how proteins are organized, 
  - what kind of different proteins there are, 
  - how proteins are regulated, 
  - important proteins, 
  - how proteins evolve, 
  - and of course by what mechanism they complete their jobs,

  at the very least , you 'll gain an appreciation for life on the molecular level !,

  my favorite kind of art style is fez 's kind , my favorite kind of world is a metroidvania-type one like fez 's , and my favorite kind of gameplay is platformer puzzles , like in fez . 
  fez has all of these ; is there any other game that does ? 
  ( the music and excuse plot were both also really to my liking , although i like plot . ), 
  i own a wii , too . 
  ( and i have played super paper mario , which is similar to fez in these respects , although with a more complex plot and a more significant combat system . ), 
  i can barely get anything to orbit now without it exploding partway . 
  previously totally stable craft now have 95 % chances of dissociating randomly in multiple illogical places . 
  hilariously , sometimes the exploding craft appears in map view . 
  arch linux , kernel version 3.12.6.1-arch , with an intel core i5-3320m running at 2.60 ghz ( i do n't dare overclock ) , and a nvidia nvs 5400m with driver ` bumblebee-nvidia `, 
  mods installed include mechjeb and universe replacer , as well as obsolete versions of kethane and kas, 
  i recently went to some very good , very american restaurants ( although neither of them were intended to be especially good ) , and i 've figured out that most of my favorite american food relies on molten cheese , e.g. 
  french fries in cheese sauce , philly cheesesteaks , nachos . 
  the problem is , whenever i melt cheese over my food , by the time i start eating it has hardened . 
  this is not a problem for cheesesteaks , but it makes fries and nachos stick together . 
  how do i make a thick , cohesive , flavorful , but * liquid * cheese sauce for these dishes ? 
  edit : thanks guys !, 
  i will first try making bechamel sauce with cornstarch instead of flour , and add cheese . 
  hi , i 'm a first-year grad student who is going to compose and teach a 12-week course on proteins on university of reddit sometime in the spring . 
  since i am not very experienced in creating my own courses , it will be paraphrased 70-80 % from the fantastic book * how proteins work * by mike williamson , with supporting material from * protein structure and function * by petsko and ringe . 
  i have just started writing the lectures and ppts for the first couple of weeks . 
  is there any written material on proteins that it is absolutely critical that i have read before continuing to write lectures for the course ? 
  is this normal ? 
  if i do n't do that , then when it boots into lightdm , i am not able to input anything whatsoever . 
  no keyboard or mouse , in any form . 
  i ca n't even switch tty and try booting up openbox myself . 
  also , when it 's booting , there is a telltale flash of the thinkpad logo tiled across the screen in ( what i am guessing is ) 640x480 a few times . 
  ( it 's a thinkpad laptop . ), 
  probably something with evdev . 
  not x itself , since stuff still displays . 
  there 's only been one kernel update so far where i have n't had to do it , and it was a kernel update that broke a lot more things than normal . 
  while i can live with this , i 'd prefer not to . 
  i 've always had my liveusb ( really a livesd , shh do n't tell the computer ) on hand , but a time might come when i do n't . 
  i 've thought about putting the liveusb software on a separate partition of my hard drive , but that 's kind of needlessly overcomplicating things and wasting space . 
  also , i have n't fucked around with parted in a while , and i 'm afraid i might accidentally delete something . 
  i have to get [ a 1.5 ton payload ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dh0yxwr.png ) to eve orbit . 
  ( a tiny shuttle , with 1.4 km/s of \u0394v , plus a kerbal . ), 
  i am trying as hard as possible to maximize the craft 's \u0394v while minimizing its mass , but it 's getting unfortunately [ * really * big ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5z5l9mh.png ) . 
  70 tons ; it gets me about 8 km/s of \u0394v . 
  tsiolkovsky says that if it were an ideal rocket , i should be getting [ about 11km/s at that isp and gravity ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=300s+*++9.8+m%2fs%5e2+*+ln%2870%2f1.5%29 ) .
