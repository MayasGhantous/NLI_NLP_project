  i know [ the little rockomax engines ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wademkd.png ) have very good twrs and excellent isps , but they 're not helping as much as i 'd like . 
  is there some more efficient way i could go about this ? 
  or do i just keep adding fuel tanks and thrusters ? 
  i do n't need the full 11.5 km/s to get to orbit ; i 'll be landing at eve 's highest point . 
  maybe i could even reduce the payload size ? 
  edit : misunderstood the concept of specific impulse, 
  the little ball that tells me which way my maneuver node is pointing is absent when i am a kerbal . 
  this is a tragedy . 
  how do you guys do it ? 
  do you just eyeball which way is prograde and extrapolate the rest ? 
  it 's like orange tanks are made of ni3 or something . 
  when the rocket is going up , there is usually no problem . 
  in fact , the outer stages peel off just fine , with few hitches . 
  but when i get to the last few -- when i 'm making my gravity turn , so the rocket is tilted -- whenever i stage , there 's like a 2/3 chance some of the tanks will explode . 
  it has something to do with the fact that the tanks touch , * lightly , * a little , but that 's no excuse for them to be so extremely fragile . 
  i tried putting sepratrons on them , but they still explode . 
  i think it 's a problem with orange tanks in particular ( because of their inertia ??? 
  ) , since my smaller crafts do n't explode . 
  help ? 
  i am looking to use capsaicin extract as a theft deterrent for some of my property . 
  if somebody attempts to steal it , they get sprayed in the face with a slightly dilute solution ( capsaicin dissolved in water ) . 
  basically pepper spray but more potent . 
  then they do n't steal again . 
  my question is , would this have any lasting repercussions ( besides psychological ones ) ? 
  apparently it can not cause blindness , which is good . 
  back when i first played ksp , i did n't really understand the uselessness of twr in orbit . 
  i heard , however , that nukes are great for interplanetary stages . 
  so i built the worst transfer stage possible in existence : an orange tank , with a skipper attached to the end , surrounded by the long and thin tanks with nukes at the end , asparagus-staged . 
  the fuel efficiency is shit , and the twr is n't good enough to circularize either . 
  but i was n't doing any far-reaching missions , so i never replaced it until 0.22 . 
  i estimate i could have saved over 100 hours if i had n't kept using the damned thing . 
  i had to start one of the stages of my experiment over . 
  it was kind of frustrating . 
  i am constructing phylogenies based on virus dna . 
  what would be a better model , transition-transversion or all 6 types of substitution being different ? 
  is 6 categorically better if time constraints are ignored ? 
  i went to berkeley from nj via car for some inane reason last august . 
  now i am going back to nj , and i figured i 'd actually have some fun with it this time . 
  i am a hungarian immigrant to the us ; the only states that i 've ever slept in in the us are new jersey , california , maryland , and maine ( in the order of amount of times ) . 
  the south is like a foreign country to me ; i know it is full of gnostic protestants , alligators , creationists , black people , and hot sauce , and that it once declared independence from the us on account of the abolition of slavery , but not much beyond that . 
  my trip will go through the grand canyon ; albuquerque , nm ; dallas , tx ; new orleans , la ; atlanta , ga ; charlotte , nc ; and not much else ( richmond , va is too far out of the way and i can reach it relatively easily from nj ) . 
  i will arrive at the new orleans 2 days after independence day ; my original plan accidentally had me arriving * on * independence day , and there was no place to stay . 
  any advice for things to see/do/bring ? 
  i ca n't spend more than a couple hours in each city if i want to get home at a reasonable time , except for the new orleans , where i will rest for a whole day . 
  one thing i know i am doing is bringing my bogr\u00e1cs ( a kind of pot you hang over a fire ) , with which i will make bogr\u00e1csguly\u00e1s using southern spices/hot sauces . 
  i 'm making a road trip from one end of the us to the other ( from berkeley to princeton ) , and i have never visited most of it , especially any of the south . 
  ( i grew up in hungary , went to college in new jersey , and now live in california . ), 
  i will therefore visit most of the south on my road trip . 
  i will be staying in dallas for one night , july 5th ; i get there from santa fe , and from there i go to the new orleans the next day . 
  in the brief afternoon and evening i have to explore dallas , is there anything you can recommend that i do ? 
  texas is the state that i am looking most forward to visiting , because it is the most exotic . 
  i know texas is the state that likes guns the most . 
  is there a place in dallas where i can pay for a brief hands-on introduction to using them ?

   and just as they were almost to the huge white front of the gringotts building , professor quirrell said :, 
  of course . 
  i see it now . 
  let me guess , the weasley twins ? '', 
   `` what ? '', 
  said harry , his voice going up another octave in pitch . 
  `` how ? '', 
   `` i 'm afraid i could n't say . '', 
   '' ... that is not fair . '', 
   `` i think it is extremely fair , '' said professor quirrell , and they entered through the bronze doors . 
  did quirrell figure out the mechanism for the trick , and combine it with some sort of additional knowledge of the weasley twins , like that they know a competent memory charmer or something ? 
  ( is ambrosius flume good at memory charms ? ), 
  it 's been about a week . 
  the problem started when i updated chromium . 
  if i go to ` chrome : / / plugins / ` then there 's no flash plugin there at all . 
  ( there 's `` chromoting viewer '' and `` native client '' . ), 
  i tried installing ` chromium-pepper-flash ` , but that did n't change anything . 
  i also tried installing ` chromium-pepper-flash-dev ` , but that did n't change anything , either . 
  i tried starting chromium using ` chromium - plugins-enabled ` , with ` chromium-pepper-flash ` installed , but that also did n't change anything ( although i did n't expect it to ) . 
  i also tried clicking the `` install missing plugin ... '' link and installing the ` . tar.gz ` file provided by adobe ( by copying its contents into ` / usr ` ) . 
  this did nothing ; in fact , all the files in it were already in place . 
  edit : the problem magically fixed itself when i restarted the computer . 
  i do n't know exactly what happened , because i * was * restarting chromium between installs of pepper , and before restarting the computer i updated everything . 
  oh well , it works now . 
  anything better than `` nunc '' or `` iam '' ? 
  in english we can say , `` he comes , '' or change the aspect of the verb and say , `` here he comes . '', 
  i understand that the original formulation of the phrase was probably to mean , `` he comes hither , '' i.e. 
  but now it means more like that the coming is taking place right now , and maybe we should prepare for it . 
  is there any way to express the same thing in latin ? 
  `` iam venit '' is close , but not quite that . 
  i understand p-adic numbers , and want other people to do so as well ( so i can use it as an example of an alternative counting system ) . 
  the explanations i find on the internet , however , are overly technical ( papers ) , not comprehensive enough ( mathworld ) , or terribly written ( wikipedia ) . 
  is there an actually good explanation of what they are on the internet ? 
  on the assumption that the mapping transfiguration imposes from one thing to another is as straightforward as possible ( something like an isometric isomorphism , for example ) , and that the `` small internal changes '' that happen in objects over time are mostly on the atomic scale , getting transfigured into some sort of inert solid and then getting transfigured back again is roughly the same as getting severe radiation poisoning . 
  while there are no apparent macroscopic consequences , it damages more delicate molecular machinery , e.g. 
  dna , proteins , and rna , which eventually kills the irradiated/transfigured organism . 
  two or so years ago stephan rafler came up with `` smoothlife '' , a family of generalizations of conway 's game of life where either the grid is continuous , time is continuous , or both . 
  [ you can see the fully-continuous version of it in action here . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kje9h6qs82i ) you can see how it has its own spaceships and still lifes and oscillators , but there is much less variety . 
  recently i discovered that the simulator for it that i downloaded , [ ready ] ( https://code.google.com/p/reaction-diffusion/ ) , actually worked on my computer ; some sort of update or expansion i downloaded in the meantime must have fixed it , because last time i checked it did n't work . 
  so i booted up smoothlifel and ran a few simulations of it , and guess what i found : a very stable still life that is larger than anything i 've seen before , and is a source of new oscillators , and might be a source of large spaceships as well . 
  [ it 's that larger blob in the center right . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zw5fdf7.png ) lots of stuff crashed into it throughout the simulation , but the blob remained stable throughout . 
  ( well , it got a little misshapen . 
  but apart from that it 's fine . ),
