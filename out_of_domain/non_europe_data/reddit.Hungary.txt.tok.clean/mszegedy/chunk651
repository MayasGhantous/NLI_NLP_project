  one or two other blobs also got generated , and one of them actually disappeared ( after which nearly the whole board was filled up , which hints at there being something like chemical energy in this game ) , while the other got a glider stuck to it and became the oscillator on the left .

  it 's not too interesting , though . 
  anyone know a subreddit this post might be a better fit for ? 
  two or so years ago stephan rafler came up with `` smoothlife '' , a family of generalizations of conway 's game of life where either the grid is continuous , time is continuous , or both . 
  [ you can see the fully-continuous version of it in action here . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kje9h6qs82i ) you can see how it has its own spaceships and still lifes and oscillators , but there is much less variety than regular cgol . 
  recently i discovered that the simulator for it that i downloaded , [ ready ] ( https://code.google.com/p/reaction-diffusion/ ) , actually worked on my computer ; some sort of update or expansion i downloaded in the meantime must have fixed it , because last time i checked it did n't work . 
  so i booted up smoothlifel and ran a few simulations of it , and guess what i found : a very stable still life that is larger than anything i 've seen before , and is a source of new oscillators , and might be a source of large spaceships as well . 
  [ it 's that larger blob in the center right . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zw5fdf7.png ) lots of stuff crashed into it throughout the simulation , but the blob remained stable throughout . 
  ( well , it got a little misshapen . 
  but apart from that it 's fine . ), 
  one or two other blobs also got generated , and one of them actually disappeared ( after which nearly the whole board was filled up , which hints at there being something like chemical energy in this game ) , while the other got a glider stuck to it and became the oscillator on the left . 
  this is , as far as i know , unprecedented .

  the only mods i 'm aware of having are the astronomer 's visual pack v3 beta and universereplacer . 
  edit : checked the part.cfg file for mk1pod , the science part looks the same as for the solidbooster ( which does appear ) . 
  since people are always already themselves , you might just say it 's whichever episode he gets the most screentime , but that episode might not give the best representative sample of how that doctor typically acts ( e.g. , `` the waters of mars '' ) . 
  i 'm particularly interested in one for ten , because i think he 's a good doctor to watch a standalone episode about . 
  tl ; dr : is there a hungarian-language mod for ksp ? 
  or a mod that simplifies the gui ? 
  i volunteer at the local hospital as a sort of `` friend '' to the kids there ( since it 's the only hospital in a relatively large radius , their parents do n't visit them often , because they live far away ) . 
  today i brought in my laptop for them to play ksp . 
  it was very fun for them , they even counted down to the launches and kids from the neighboring wards came to watch . 
  however , i think the language barrier is getting in the way a little . 
  they ca n't tell the difference between `` revert flight '' and `` resume '' , and they do n't know what all the different parts do because they ca n't read the descriptions . 
  ( i 'm much more competent at explaining things than this makes me sound like !, 
  it 's just that there 's so many parts , and so little time . 
  they need to know what the parts do instantly ; they get impatient if i explain things first . ), 
  to that end , is there a hungarian-language mod for ksp ? 
  i 'd make one myself , but i do n't have the time . 
  in general , what mods would make the experience better for these kids ? 
  i killed the destroyer in mobile ( ios ) but it did n't drop any hallowed bars .

  i have n't been a regular poster here for well over a year . 
  and it 's not like this place has as much raw upvoting power as , say , / r/pics or / r/videos , both of where i 'd gotten comments with four-digit karma scores . 
  i thought that the amount of karma you got at a subreddit was basically the amount of comments you 've made there times the amount of subscribers it has times some constant , but i could n't have posted on here that much , could i ? 
  for that matter , how did the philippines ? 
  it would be an answer to a question no one asked : `` how can a language look synthetic , but actually be analytical ? '', 
  like super-english on hyper-steroids . 
  ( or mega-german on lsd . ), 
  - verbs would inflect for person and number of both the subject and the object , but sentences would still require noun phrases for the subject ( and , if there is one , the object ) , and some person/number combinations would have the same inflection as each other . 
  - nouns would have gender , and adjectives and prepositions would have to agree with them . 
  - prepositions circumfix the noun phrase that 's their object ( with neither prefix parts nor suffix parts being unique ) , but the noun would also have to inflect into the prepositional case . 
  - number would be done with a unique adjective for each , with an adjective meaning `` one '' , an adjective meaning `` between two and nine '' , and an adjective meaning `` ten or more '' . 
  however , the article of the noun would inflect for number , but only for singular and plural . 
  - speaking of which , you can also chose demonstratives for articles ( so , a separate article for `` a '' , a separate article for `` the '' , a separate article for `` this '' , a separate article for `` that ( of yours ) '' , and a separate article for `` that ( over there ) '' ) , but nouns only inflect for indefiniteness and definiteness . 
  - the article also has to agree with the class of the clause 's verb . 
  - tense and mood are expressed with auxiliary verbs , but they have to agree with a * different * kind of verb class as articles agree with . 
  more abominable examples ?

  i 've got \u041c\u0430\u0434\u0436\u044d\u0440 , which is supposed to be whatever would have happened to the hungarian language over there if the tatars had n't wiped out magna hungaria . 
  ( no hard feelings , tatars , we would 've done the same to you ), 
  ugh , you ( we ? ), 
  have been making fun of these for years and years , but i need some sane ( r ) people to comment on how horrible this thread is because jesus christ . 
  i 'm going to keep this short because :, 
  - i do n't like singling out particular comments , and therefore users, 
  - i 'm busy, 
  - it would be basically a rehash of everything this subreddit 's already said about eugenics discussions on reddit, 
  my main problem with the thread is two things :, 
  number one , the laughable claim that `` eugenics would solve nearly everything '' . 
  wow yes you know that because you 're a sociologist or historian and know what motivates human behavior ? 
  and you happen to know a lot of metaethics as well and you 're confident that that 's an ethical thing to do ? 
  number two , the attitude that `` the biggest problem with eugenics is that people ca n't agree on what criteria to do it based on '' . 
  they somehow entirely forget to evaluate eugenics itself as a practice , and jump straight to problems with * implementing * it . 
  i guess because their belief that eugenics is a good thing feels like reality , and you would n't question reality , would you ? 
  they try to look for problems , but end up accidentally grabbing other people 's problems with it instead and not really even absorbing those either , because they 've got a blind spot where their * own * belief is . 
  more desirable would be if they 'd say `` the biggest problem with eugenics is that criteria are difficult to define '' , or the much stronger `` the biggest problem with eugenics is that criteria are impossible to define '' . 
  is there a subreddit like this for natlangs ? 
  like , where people post about particularly interesting grammatical features of whatever language they know/are studying , or some funny vocabulary , or some language history ?

  i know there 's mounds of unprocessed data to process and cross-reference , but exactly what does the data ecosystem look like , and are there any obvious holes in it ? 
  my ideas are to use the oldest iranian/persiaj flag i can find , or a pattern from sumerian pottery . 
  i asked the mods too , but they seem to be busy answering approval requests or something . 
  this is based on how i speak english . 
  ## vowels, 
  ** monophthongs : **, 
  vowels can long . 
  vowels can be chained indefinitely to form clusters , although in practice this only occurs with two , sometimes three , very occasionally four vowels at a time . 
  vowels can be nasalized , but only either all or none of the vowels in a cluster may be nasalized . 
  ## consonants, 
  stops other than / \u0294 / may only be used to begin words ; the only consonants allowed between vowels are fricatives and / \u0294 / .
