  but you wouldnt , you couldnt , and now youre goddamned too far decided as yet of the still pay , you idiot price . 
  i will drown shit fury in you . 
  your dead are fucking you , kiddo . 
  there 's a comic i 've been trying to get out a long time now . 
  it 's basically as follows :, 
  - five panels of progressively older examples of cooperation , captioned with something to the effect of `` cooperation is an enduring and useful human trait , '' with the panels being :, 
  - the eu, 
  - the mongols, 
  ( see below ), 
  - a tribe of proto-humans attacking some boars, 
  - two cells exchanging dna, 
  - a much larger panel artistically depicting the cold war and its many fronts , with the caption , `` so why ca n't we do it now ? '', 
  i 've already finished most of this comic , but i still need help with two things . 
  i 'm having trouble deciding what the middle panel in the first part should be . 
  first , i did ancient egypt building the pyramids , because they had an actual flag and a well-known accomplishment , but when i got to drawing the slaves i realized that they are a terrible example of cooperation . 
  then i tried doing early mesopotamia ( the earlier the better ; as time went on , their society got more and more stratified ) , but it ended up not looking so impressive , and liable to make people go , `` what 's that panel supposed to be ? '', 
  taking examples from that far back makes it too similar to the panel before it . 
  so what should i use instead ? 
  i was thinking of the delian league , but that was really just a ploy so that athens could backstab everyone . 
  also the flags are n't recognizable again , although giving them greek helmets might go some ways . 
  ** warning gigantic rant about color follows , you should probably just help me with the first problem **, 
  i am also not happy with the palette of the first five panels , and i 'm probably going to have to redraw them wholesale . 
  the panels have got the following colors :, 
  - light blue sky , light green and yellow terrain , multicolored balls, 
  - cerulean blue sky with blue , white , and red mongol insignia superimposed over it , darkish brown terrain , multicolored balls, 
  - light , grayish cloudy blue sky , with yellowish green terrain and purple balls, 
  - cool pastels : different shades of light blue , light purple , light green ; mainly turquoise and blue, 
  the only panel whose palette i 'm happy with is the last one . 
  there should be a chromatic cohesion between the first five panels , containing colors of similar saturation and similar spacing with respect to brightness , but of different combinations of similar hues for each panel ( for example , so that there 's a red panel , followed by a blue panel , followed by a yellow panel , followed by a green panel ) . 
  i ca n't figure out how to make each panel only consist of a limited set of similar hues , though . 
  ( forget the balls !, 
  i 'm only talking about the terrain . ), 
  an egypt panel would be easy ; you can use yellow hues . 
  the last panel uses bluish hues . 
  i want each panel to be overall kind of pastel . 
  my ideas for each panel :, 
  - no idea , this one 's the hardest . 
  i kind of like the panel the way it is , and i might just leave it like that at the expense of making the comic a little less aesthetically pleasing . 
  - based on [ literally one of the first google images results for mongolia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/rider_in_mongolia,_2012.jpg ) , i could probably use pastel green here . 
  the only issues are that pastel green is a pretty major component of the previous panel , and having the same colors in succession looks bad when you 're artistically supposed to be emphasizing the contrast between the panels , especially if the sky 's going to be pastel blue too ( like the previous panel ) , and also if i make the sky pastel then i wo n't be able to blend the mongol empire 's flag into the background . 
  that second one 's probably unavoidable though because i 'm supposed to be using pastels one way or the other , and there 's no place for real blue . 
  - depends on what i get for this one . 
  if i do use the delian league example it could probably be blue , except that 's the same color as the last panel so that 's bad . 
  i might have to start looking for examples that allow me to use red or something . 
  where in the world is there red earth ? 
  or maybe i could draw the forbidden palace ? 
  but that was n't built until the ming dynasty . 
  this is supposed to be a very early example . 
  or i could try mesopotamia again and pretend their mud was reddish ? 
  - i could do ... green again ? 
  but a different shade of green . 
  like , the mongol panel can have shades of green and blue , and this one can have shades of green and ... yellow i guess . 
  if the balls take up sufficient amounts of space , i can make it purple . 
  i 'll probably have to have the jungle cover up the sky so that i do n't have yet another panel with blue . 
  ugh , that means i 'll have to draw jungle close up . 
  - this one 's blue , turquoise , and purple . 
  what i could possibly do is have them be alternating colors : blue , green , blue , green , blue . 
  but i also have the panels on alternating sides of the comic , left , right , left , right , left , and it would look kind of weird and unbalanced for all the blue panels to be on the left and all the green panels to be on the right . 
  maybe blue-green-red/yellow-green blue ? 
  but that still leaves all the greens on the right side . 
  thoughts ? 
  i ca n't believe you read all that . 
  say , how would the interpretations of sunni islam of 15th century ottomans and 15th century bruneians differ from each other ? 
  ( new player ) i never bothered to figure out how to do the timurids in 1.7 , and now i 'm paying the price as i do n't know what changed in 1.8 . 
  can you still use roughly the same strategy as originally ? 
  i 've tried releasing persia as a vassal and warring kashmir , punjab , delhi , etc. , but i always get overwhelmed with rebels ( and my stupid advisors resigning ) . 
  could i possibly 100 % autonomy all the taken provinces ? 
  release 'em as vassals and annex them later , so that i can spend my admin points on tech and stab instead of coring ? 
  instead of having technologies , national ideas , and culture , why not just have a bunch of ideas provinces can randomly get based on a number of factors ( such as what ideas they already have ) , with the culture based on it ? 
  why not have the same system for religion , too ? 
  ## foreword, 
  i usually irrationally hate reading mod/game ideas , because almost nothing ever comes of it , and it seems a little arrogant to basically tell devs how to do their jobs . 
  but i 'd appreciate your thoughts on this , as long as you understand that it 's purely speculation , probably is n't a good idea , and almost certainly takes more work than anybody can be bothered to put into it . 
  i 'm also not sure what the limitations of modding are in eu4 , so it might be impossible altogether .
