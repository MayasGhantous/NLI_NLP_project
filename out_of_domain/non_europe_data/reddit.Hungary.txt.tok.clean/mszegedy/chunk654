  but such websites are hard to come by ; coursera has a biomolecular modeling course in russian , but it 's perpetually stagnant . 
  do you know of anything that could help my friend ? 
  he has an undergraduate education in microbiology , and speaks english , german , and russian . 
  everybody says lkh was very bad in lots of ways . 
  but , like most doctor who episodes , it left me only with a feeling of apathy . 
  i am curious as to what elements shaped everyone 's opinions about it , since they seem so negative . 
  i particularly enjoyed * an untitled story * . 
  i also enjoyed * fez * very much , which is n't quite a metroidvania but close enough to be relevant . 
  i have n't played too many others , but i know what i 'm looking for ( all but the first three are just preferences , and i realize that a game that conforms to all of them probably does n't even exist ) :, 
  - decentralized and very diverse world, 
  - nonlinear but very present plot, 
  - involves skill upgrades ( like all metroidvanias ought to ) , preferably with a proper skilltree, 
  - scrolling rather than having `` rooms '', 
  - platformer ( i have yet to play * aquaria * or * insanely twisted shadow planet * , but i like platformers ), 
  - relaxed pace ; no non-renewable resources , no time limits , etc, 
  - a world populated with characters ( this is what bugs me about games like * aus * and * fez * , it 's all empty and depressing ; rpgs do it right ), 
  i like both platforming challenges and puzzles . 
  i do n't like just plowing through enemies , unless it 's a puzzle in and of itself . 
  i 'd prefer longer games to shorter ones , but who would n't ? 
  any suggestions ? 
  thank you for your time . 
  i 'm not even talking about how * i * got downvoted ; people reasonably misunderstood my tone there . 
  just , in many threads i see , there 's one or two mildly dissenting comments that are downvoted quite heavily ( like -9 , -7 , -11 , etc ) . 
  wtf happened to this place ? 
  it used to be that even comments with upwards of fifty points did n't have a single downvote . \\* i do n't want to get on anyone 's case for their voting habits ( although imo downvoting stuff just because you disagree with it , especially in a community as purportedly friendly as this one , is mean and hurts discussion ) ; i just want an * explanation . 
  \\* which is quite amazing because the reddit engine itself adds downvotes to heavily-upvoted posts . 
  maybe it does n't start doing it until there 's at least one downvote on the post ? 
  or it copies the voting habits of the subreddit the post 's in ? 
  swadesh lists and the like are too nominalist imo . 
  what if i * do n't * want my language to have words that have a 1-1 correspondence with english ? 
  is there any place that has lists of commonly-used , but vocabulary-wise diverse sentences ? 
  about 10-20 years ago , as a kid , i went to the greek island of milos for vacation . 
  one of the beaches we visited had large-ish rocks ( about the size of one 's fist ) , and digging around a little i noticed a weird ribbon-like invertebrate attached to them . 
  - the invertebrate was made up of thin , featureless ribbons about 1 cm across . 
  i could n't identify either end of each ribbon . 
  - the ribbons were probably tan . 
  i recall them being vaguely translucent towards the middle , but my memory might have made that up . 
  - the ribbons were gripping the undersides of the rocks . 
  - it is not clear whether the ribbons were attached to each other , attached to the same organism , or attached to separate organisms . 
  - whenever i touched the ribbons or moved the rocks too much , they 'd start recoiling deeper into the pile . 
  eventually they all went away , so i could n't investigate the organism . 
  - when i grabbed onto the ribbon , the organism pulled on it until that end broke . 
  the other side also broke , as a result of being trapped between the rocks . 
  the resulting piece did not continue to move , and was in fact quite uninteresting . 
  - it was twilight . 
  thoughts on what it might have been ? 
  there 's probably something bigger on the other side , considering the strength with which it pulled , and the apparent disposability of part of the ribbons . 
  it could be a mollusc , except it was n't a cephalopod , because their tentacles are n't flat and featureless , so i do n't know what kind of mollusc it would be . 
  since it was able to sense me touching it , it probably has neurons , at least , but that 's uselessly vague . 
  just look that [ impressive phonology !, 
  i like being able to work on stuff both on my computer and my phone . 
  that 's why i keep everything important on a dropbox . 
  but my favorite medium for storing notes and lists is emacs org files . 
  they 're really a joy to edit on a computer . 
  however , how do i edit these from my android phone ? 
  i can think of two general strategies :, 
  - use emacs for android : not a good idea , because the port kind of sucks , and it wo n't have my . emacs.d anyway ; god intended emacs for use with keyboards, 
  - use a regular text editor for android : better , but wo n't auto-wrap at 80 columns and does n't have all the org mode bells and whistles like easy list item creation, 
  is there any android editor that 'll allow me to edit org mode files well ? 
  if not , writing it may become my new project , because how dare platform diversity interfere with my workflow . 
  edit : there 's [ mobileorg ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.matburt.mobileorg&hl=en ) , apparently ; i 'll try it out and report back, 
  edit 2 : the staging scheme is kinda confusing , but i got through it . 
  i do n't like it for a number of reasons , though , most importantly because the editor 's interface is weird and not flexible .

  i started a sulu run , and everything was going really well . 
  i conquered borneo and java ( vassalizing majapahit ) , colonized manila and moved my capital there , westernized in the mid-1500s using the colony seizure trick , and got a bunch of cores in the caribbean that i was going to later use to springboard off of into europe to core everything there . 
  however , one of the catholic colonies i seized and finished kept spawning catholic zealot rebels . 
  and i thought , well ... they 're right , are n't they ? 
  the philippines is supposed to be catholic . 
  it does n't matter that it came from spanish colonialism , the point is it 's the word of the lord and manila is currently missing out on it . 
  so i set out to convert to catholic . 
  i sold every province except manila in asia to majapahit , and moved my capital to les cayes , the catholic , formerly spanish province . 
  i gave them a missionary , and sure enough , soon a bunch of rebels spawned . 
  they sat on the capital for a bit , and in just 2 years , enforced their demands . 
  however , we did n't convert !, 
  it turned out that all they did was raise the autonomy by 25 % in les cayes , and give me -33 presige ( or was it -50 ? ) . 
  and since les cayes was the capital , they did n't even raise the autonomy . 
  the state religion remained sunni , and i am very disappointed . 
  how am i going to pu france now ? 
  any suggestions ? 
  should i try selling majapahit the rest of my provinces as well ? 
  i 'm trying to make kitfo for the first time , and the recipe for the awaze paste for it calls for some sort of alcohol , but it 's unclear which .
