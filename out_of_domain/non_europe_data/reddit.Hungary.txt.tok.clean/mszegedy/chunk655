  the cookbook says red wine , the internet says whiskey , and i 'm fairly sure ethiopians normally drink t\u00ebj . 
  i do n't have any whiskey at home ( nor have i ever had any ) , so i will probably go with the red wine , but i 'd have a better idea of what i 'm doing if i knew what the alcohol was for . 
  in addition to the red wine , i have rum , tequila , sake , and p\u00e1linka . 
  it would be logical , but i ca n't prove it , so maybe it does n't . 
  it seems like a silly question , but most things i 've edited with emacs have been source code files , . tex files , and . org files . 
  what utilities are there if i want to just edit a regular text file ? 
  imagine i want to make one of those walkthroughs on gamefaqs . 
  i know about automatic line wrapping and that one plugin for parentheses . 
  anything else ? 
  edit : thanks guys !, 
  this community 's awesome and responsive . 
  what parts of history could easily have gone one way or the other ? 
  i do n't so much mean events in the lives of particular people , but the fates of particular states and such . 
  would france surely have unified ? 
  would the mongols surely have taken over most of asia ? 
  that kind of stuff . 
  i 've got a note 4 . 
  i 'm new to android . 
  i do n't like how it lags , and i also do n't like the 50 or so preinstalled apps . 
  is cm right for me ? 
  if so , when can i get it ? 
  n00b here . 
  i have a n910a note 4 , but all the custom roms are for the international variant n910f , or some other version . 
  ( there was a really good one i saw for the t mobile version , for example . ), 
  does it matter if i install one not specifically for mine ? 
  some of them have warnings for other versions , e.g. 
  6th gear , but most do n't mention . 
  the ones it has are great , but they 're pretty small in number and not very varied . 
  could we brainstorm some more in this thread ? 
  here 's a couple i came up with just now , mostly based on top posts from this sub :, 
  - this post has , like , three germanic words in it . 
  that 's it , that 's your germanic . 
  the rest is french . 
  - you only think this post is dumb because it contains untranslatable words . 
  - i simply want this post to change over to speaking basque ( or tamil ) as its first language for its own good . 
  - i 'm getting a little tired of the linguistic field pronouncing that they have a better understanding of what constitutes a good post and what does n't . 
  - sorry if i want to preserve our grammar so that future posts do n't end up inheriting ebonics . 
  [ need to get in a better dig at aave than this , any ideas ? ], 
  - the most challenging language only for the strong and the brave is polish . 
  most others are easy in comparison . 
  [ need to add a reference to the post for this one , any ideas ? ], 
  they had many similar factors affecting them -- many resources , bordering `` barbarian '' hordes , positioned at the edge of a continent -- but they developed differently enough that qing china got crushed by the europeans when they met . 
  what gives ? 
  hi , i have obtained a bunch of gis data ( specifically [ wwf 's data about the `` terrestrial ecoregions of the world '' ] ( http://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/terrestrial-ecoregions-of-the-world ) ) and i 'd like to write a program ( in python , but i might move to c++ later ) that reads in the data . 
  what utilities/libraries are there for processing it ? 
  what are the various file extensions for ? 
  it seems that the bulk of the data is stored in binary in the ` . shp ` file , and the labels are stored in roughly human-readable format in the ` . dbf ` file . 
  i ca n't say exactly what i need it for , as i 'll probably use it for a variety of purposes . 
  i 'd like to at least be able to render a png of it , though . 
  i was going to post this to / r/programming , but i was n't sure how it would be received , so it ended up here instead . 
  whenever i look at unhighlighted code , typically in ` less ` or pastebin , it looks highlighted to me . 
  with the pastebin ones i ca n't even be sure , unless i blew it up to huge size , or get a friend to look at it . 
  is this common ? 
  i think it would be , since it probably arises from the faintness of typical syntax highlighting , and a lack of ability to properly perceive the text , resulting in your brain filling in the rest with a best guess . 
  the lack of ability to perceive might be more specific to me , as i 've had a number of problems seeing properly over the years ( e.g. 
  i am excellent at the violin , but i can not read a score while simultaneously playing it ; it all blurs together ) . 
  - lenovo thinkpad t430s, 
  - intel core i5 [ unknown rate ], 
  - bios mode, 
  - separate boot partition, 
  - ` bbswitch ` for nvidia optimus setup, 
  - nothing special about setup really , as far as i can tell it 's core input modules that are broken, 
  i 've been trying for hours to get this thing working from emergency mode , to no avail . 
  the problem seems to be that while all the modules are stored in the directory for ` 3.18.5-1-arch ` , the actual kernel loaded , and given by ` uname - r ` , is ` 3.17.6-1-arch ` ( my old kernel ) , despite the fact that i have updated the ` linux ` package to ` 3.18.5-1 ` . 
  why is n't the new kernel loaded on boot , when supposedly the entire precompiled image was copied to ` / boot ` when ` pacman ` updated it ? 
  why does ` chroot ` ing in from a liveusb and performing ` mkinitcpio ` fix everything ? 
  and most importantly , how do i get the new kernel to load ? 
  ( i tried ` mkinitcpio - k [ new kernel ] - p linux ` just in case , but that did n't work . ), 
  i asked about how to stop needing the liveusb here a year ago , and the consensus was that i should get dkms versions of some of my hardware-specific drivers , but that did n't do anything , so i remained complacent . 
  also , there 's an unrelated issue where if i press the down key in any environment other than xorg , like a separate tty or emergency mode , it does n't work . 
  it 's just that one key . 
  what gives ? 
  edit : thank you everyone !, 
  the problem was that ` / boot ` was n't getting mounted . 
  i mounted it and installed over it , and everything worked . 
  i will add it to my ` fstab ` . 
  thanks for all the help !, 
  would n't it be fun if you could play on a map where north america was still split in two along the middle ? 
  or one where the mediterranean was still a huge , arid desert ? 
  or for that matter where europe was a bunch of islands ? 
  is anyone interested in a map mod like this ? 
  if so , what time period ? 
  personally i like the [ mid/late cretaceous ] ( http://www.scotese.com/images/094.jpg ) for the western interior seaway , the archipelago-ization of europe , the weird placement of india , and the union of sea asia with the rest of east asia . 
  i can make all the province map data relatively easily with some scripts ( assuming there 's even rough gis maps of the time period ; i know some tricks ) , but i 'd need help putting together which countries go where , as that requires some thinking . 
  i also have no interest in maintaining it across versions , although if the differences are fairly minor then of course i 'd update it . 
  opinions ? 
  both sound and rumble for messages seem to be tied to notifications , and while i can get sound for calls , rumble seems to be gone altogether ( even though intensity for incoming calls is set to max , and the volume is n't set to silent ) . 
  a subset of the threads from the old subreddit [ remain archived ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.reddit.com/r/historicalwhatif/comments/* ) at wayback machine . 
  however , by far not all of them . 
  what threads from the old subreddit would you like to see make a comeback ? 
  i personally really appreciated the brilliant , in-depth answer i got for my `` sunset invasion '' question , but not even google remembers that thread . 
  [ this ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/app/42960/discussions/0/34093781540464716/ ) frantic steam post describes my problem exactly . 
  it 's all light blue , except the water , which is a slightly different shade of light blue . 
  if i look really closely , i can see province names and borders in white . 
  how do i fix this ? 
  deleting the cache like the posters on steam suggested did n't help . 
  i am running vic 2 with all the expansions in a virtualbox windows 8 vm on arch linux . 
  i have all the extra modules installed for vbox , as far as i can tell . 
  my graphics setup is a combination of the integrated graphics on my intel i5 and the discrete gfx on my nvidia 5400m . 
  austria idiotically declared a coalition war on me , and i was able to nab krain from it .
