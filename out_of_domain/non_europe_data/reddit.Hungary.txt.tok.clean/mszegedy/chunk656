  ( i also got moravia from bohemia , but i accidentally gave it back when austria demanded it ... after i 'd spent 137 paper mana coring it ! ), 
  should i release opm styria and feed its cores back to it , or just absorb austria outright ? 
  i 've already cored it , so it might not be worth it . 
  i 'm shot on manpower atm though , and the only ally of byzantium , so it might be a good idea to have at least some sort of military capability . 
  i do n't have aow , and the situation looks like [ this . 
  edit : [ never mind this is glorious ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tffbbtu.jpg ), 
  i 'm talking about [ this ] ( http://funny-pictures-quotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glypihchs.jpg ) , which makes the rounds on reddit every so often . 
  i think it 's decent if you do n't take the thesis seriously . 
  it recognizes emojis as distinct orthographical elements we use for communication , and the fact that technology is changing how we use language . 
  it also does n't comment on whether the language change is good or bad , just that it 's funny . 
  i ca n't stand it , not having that beautiful answer to look at around anymore . 
  therefore , i 'd like you guys to write me a new one , because you seem to be into that sort of thing . 
  what would it take to make ck2 and eu4 's `` sunset invasion '' happen ? 
  in case you do n't know , this means that the aztecs invade europe , rather than the other way around , and you 're not allowed to change european history . 
  ( although i 'd be entertained by that as well . ), 
  the sidebar only lists resources for cursive . 
  however , i 'd rather just improve my print , since not everybody can read cursive . 
  ( part of the problem is that i need to show written documents to both american and hungarian audiences , whom are taught different kinds of cursive . 
  however , they also tend to be rather young . ), 
  my mother has arthritis , but still wants to be able to play a gamecube . 
  how do i make this possible ? 
  currently , with the standard gc controller ( actually , with the special-edition ssb4 controller from last year ) , her hands hurt after less than an hour of * paper mario * . 
  she does n't play mechanically-intensive games like ssb , but does need some timing and coordination ability , such as required for the aforementioned pm , or for * sm sunshine * . 
  i was thinking of making a box to run dolphin on , and connecting something like the [ madcatz stick ] ( http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?item=n82e16826618025 ) to it , or some sort of [ gaming keypad ] ( http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?item=n82e16823114033 ) , but i 'm afraid those might not be much better . 
  is there something made specifically for arthritic people ? 
  maybe even such a gc controller ? 
  ( if there is n't anything , i do own an eeg and a webcam . 
  i could do something based on computer sight with colored gloves and her fingertips , or set up something with , like , her eyelids or the like with the eeg . ),

  # undeskrajbd, 
  the ** undeskraibd language ** ( \u04d8\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439\u0431\u0434 \u0431\u0430\u0448\u0441\u0430 , \u0259ndeskrajbd ba\u0161sa ) , also known as ** nonutink ** , is a language of the anrlated-langij-islets language family , and the language of the indiznis people living in iryelvanit-syitol autonomous okrug in russia . 
  in 1993 it was spoken by 200 people . 
  ## classification, 
  undeskrajbd does not appear to be related to any other living language , making it a language isolate . 
  for classification convenience , it is included in the group of anrlated-langij-islets languages . 
  the term nonutinkic family may be used to refer to a language family with undeskrajbd as its only living member ; related languages have disappeared in the last couple of centuries . 
  attempts have been made to link it to the horsppl family , to the now-extinct wolnvrno language of siberia ( scherbakov , 1955 ) , and to the much larger hypothetical undokymentd family . 
  ## phonology, 
  the undeskrajbd language includes about 6 vowels and 14 consonants . 
  ### vowels, 
  front | back, 
  \u04d9 / \u0259 / | \u043e / ( \u02b2 ) o ~ \u0250 /, 
  ### consonants, 
  ( dento - ) labial | alveolar | retroflex | palatal | velar, 
  | | \u0447 / \u0288\u0361\u0282 / | |, 
  | \u0440 / t ~ d ~ \u027e ~ l / | | |,

  i while back , when i was trying to make injera , i naively ignored my recipes ' warnings to use already powdered teff , thinking that surely my vitamix can handle it , and now i am left with a bunch of whole teff seeds . 
  i 've tried using them as breading in schnitzel , but i do n't like the texture . 
  what dishes is whole teff actually used for/good in ? 
  they sell it in stores , so it must have * some * use . 
  unless it 's only for people who prefer the challenge of grinding their own teff . 
  my stir fry always comes out watery and stew-like , and i suspect that it is because i do n't get the wok hot enough . 
  how do i go about solving this problem ? 
  would a flamb\u00e9 work ? 
  for example , in the uralic language family , finnish is conservative . 
  * extremely * conservative . 
  it preserves most proto-uralic roots almost exactly , and even pie borrowings . 
  it 's also spoken relatively close to the ural mountains , although not as close as most of the rest of the uralic languages minus hungarian . 
  why is it so conservative , when there are some very divergent uralic languages ( such as the samoyedic languages or hungarian ) ? 
  naively i 'd assume it 's just because finns do n't talk to each other very much , but that does n't fit . 
  or in the austronesian language family , you have languages closer to taiwan such as tagalog that preserve many roots as well as the morphology closely , while the further east you go they get more divergent ( e.g. 
  hawaiian or maori ) . 
  or for ie languages , you get lithuanian , which is n't * very * conservative , but is somewhat more conservative than other ie languages , being close in form and morphology to older ie languages like latin and sanskrit , and is spoken rather close to the postulated ie urheimhat ( somewhere in ruthenia ) . 
  why ? 
  what drives language change , to create such huge differences and also such a lack of differences ? 
  it ca n't be a * coincidence * that finnish is so conservative . 
  edit : ** i 'm interested in sound change especially . 
  ** sorry i forgot to mention that ; this post was written hastily . 
  also , the second question has been answered already , so i 'd just like to know : what makes some languages have more sound changes than others ? 
  i 'm writing a simulation game and i need to ( crudely ) model this . 
  what do we know about how late hominids thought , compared to humans ? 
  i 'm particularly interested in * homo erectus * , neanderthals , and the denisovans , but more obscure ones are welcome as well , especially the australopithecines . 
  i understand that there 's very little evidence that attests to this , but surely we can make conjectures based on found tools and possibly cranial volume/shape .

  for years now i 've been trying to get this dumb ~ ~ hdmi ~ ~ ** displayport ** port to work on my lenovo t430s , and i 'd really appreciate it if somebody who knows about optimus-enabled laptops could help out . 
  how can i use it ? 
  not just while maintaining bumblebee functions , but really use it at all ? 
  here 's things i 've tried :, 
  ## trying to get it to boot using only the discrete graphics card :, 
  - ** enabling only the discrete graphics card in the bios : ** arch linux wo n't even boot up properly . 
  it hangs on some inconsequential step early in the bootup process . 
  i have n't tried this with an ` xorg.conf ` that could actually make use of the driver , but the bootup process by far does n't get to the point of starting x anyway . 
  - ** reconfiguring my xorg to use the ` nvidia ` driver instead of the ` intel ` driver : ** no matter how i generate this file ( by hand or with ` nvidia-xconfig ` ) , x simply ca n't connect to the display , and i 'm just left with a command prompt . 
  i 'd suspect the ` nvidia ` driver of being somehow broken , except for the fact that bumblebee works fine , which would be impossible without a working ` nvidia ` driver * somehow * . 
  i 've triple-checked the ` busid ` , but i swear up and down that xorg is told the correct pci port . 
  ## trying to get it to boot while using bumblebee :, 
  - ** simply doing ` optirun arandr ` or ` primusrun arandr ` and checking for the hdmi port : ** the hdmi port does n't show up , sadly . 
  i 've tried this with different devices on the other end to make sure . 
  - ** booting a new , separate x server with the ` nvidia ` driver and a custom ` xorg.conf ` as [ suggested on the wiki  ( https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/lenovo_thinkpad_t420s#using_multiple_monitors_with_nvidia-optimus ) ** i get basically the same result as when i edit my ` xorg.conf ` to only use the ` nvidia ` driver , namely a dead x. 
  it seems ` nvidia ` simply ca n't handle the responsibility of having an entire x server dedicated to it , instead of just individual processes . 
  i actually have n't tried this with the nvidia card 's ` busid ` added to the custom ` xorg.conf ` , but that should n't change anything . 
  i 'll try it just to be safe , though . 
  edit : does n't work .
