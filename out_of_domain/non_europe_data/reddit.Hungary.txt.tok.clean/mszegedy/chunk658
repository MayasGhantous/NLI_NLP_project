  - the plural is marked by '' - ** k ** '' , again with the appropriate harmonic vowel inserted if necessary . 
  - second person singular possession is marked by '' - ** d ** '' , again with the appropriate harmonic vowel inserted if necessary . 
  possession endings are inserted onto the ends of words ; so , `` haza '' means `` home '' , while `` haz\u00e1 * d * '' means `` your home '' . 
  - third person singular posession is marked by '' - ( j ) < ** e ** / a  '' , depending on vowel harmony . 
  - the word for `` deed '' is , naturally , just the past passive participle of `` tesz '' , namely '' ** tett ** '' . 
  - the word for `` culprit '' is '' ** tettes ** '' , which literally means `` deed-haver '' . 
  - the word for `` pretend '' is '' ** tettet ** '' , which you might notice is just `` tesz '' plus the causative infix '' - tet - '' , so it would literally mean `` makes to be done '' . 
  the meaning of `` pretend '' is far more common than the other one , but they both exist . 
  ( with the past/ppp infix of '' - t ( t ) - '' , this means that `` pretended '' is `` tettetett '' . ), 
  - the word for `` this '' is '' ** e ** '' or `` ez '' . 
  normally it would match the case of whatever it modifies and would also be followed by the definite article `` a ( z ) '' , but in its shortened form of `` e '' it does n't do either of those things . 
  - the word for `` but '' is '' ** de ** '' . 
  - the word for `` do n't '' is '' ** ne ** '' , and the word for `` neither '' ( as in the conjection , not the adjective ) is '' ** se ** '' . 
  - the word for `` because '' is '' ** mert ** '' , and can be shortened to `` mer '' ( which might have looked more amusing here ) . 
  - hungarian has no copula ( word for `` is '' ) in the the third person . 
  informally , we also have no copula in the other persons . 
  i am here to pontificate for your amusement on the genetics of all of the characters from the kids ' sessions . 
  namely :, 
  - the alpha kids ( jane , jake , roxy , dirk ), 
  - the beta kids ( john , rose , dave , jade ), 
  - b1 dad ( john 's adoptive dad ), 
  - b2 dad ( jane 's adoptive dad ), 
  - b1 jane 's husband ( b1 dad 's dad ) ; i 'll call him `` s1 '' ( spouse 1 ), 
  - b2 john 's wife ( b2 dad 's mom ) ; i 'll call her `` s2 '' ( spouse 2 ), 
  how each of these got their genes is the following :, 
  - ** the alpha kids : ** appearified from their own future selves . 
  this means that their genes have no source and loop endlessly around in time . 
  none of them necessarily share any dna . 
  - ** john and jade : ** recombined from jane and jake . 
  this means that approximately half of their genes come from jane , and half from jake . 
  - ** rose and dave : ** same , but with roxy and dirk . 
  - ** b1 dad : ** probably the biological son of jane , so ~ 50 % of his dna comes from jane and ~ 50 % from s1 . 
  may be genetically identical to b2 dad , in which case things get strange . 
  - ** b2 dad : ** probably the biological son of john , so ~ 50 % of his dna comes from john and ~ 50 % from s2 . 
  may be genetically identical to b2 dad , in which case things get strange . 
  - ** s1 : ** parentage completely unknown . 
  however , shares dna with john if the dads are identical ; see below . 
  - ** s2 : ** parentage completely unknown . 
  however , shares dna with jane if the dads ane identical ; see below . 
  the kids are less interesting than the dads and spouses . 
  it 's actually all very straightforward . 
  the alpha kids ' genes are completely sourceless . 
  let 's call the sets of genes of jane , jake , roxy , and dirk * gg * , * gt * , * tg * , and * tt * respectively . 
  then for the beta kids :, 
  - ** john : ** about 50/50 * gg * and * gt * . 
  necessarily gets his y chromosome from * gt * , and thus is composed of slightly more * gg * than * gt * , as the y chromosome is quite a bit smaller than the x chromosome . 
  also necessarily gets his mitochondrial dna from * gg * , since that is inherited exclusively through the female line . 
  - ** jade : ** same deal as john , except she does n't get a y chromosome from * gt * ( instead necessarily inheriting the x chromosome ) , so her genes are split a lot more evenly between the two sources . 
  however , she still inherits mtdna from * gg * only . 
  - ** rose : ** same deal as jade , but with * tg * and * tt * rather than * gg * and * gt * . 
  - ** dave : ** same deal as john , but with * tg * and * tt * rather than * gg * and * gt * . 
  now let 's talk about dad and the spouses . 
  ### in the event that the dads are both adopted, 
  then their genes are all of an unknown source and therefore boring . 
  ### in the event that the dads are both sons of their respective sburb-player parents , but not genetically identical, 
  in that case it 's relatively simple . 
  - ** b1 dad : ** his mother is jane , so ~ 50 % of his dna is * gg * , and ~ 50 % of his dna is from s1 , whose dna is from an unknown source . 
  he shares on average slightly more than a quarter of his dna with john , necessarily including his mtdna ( which had to come from jane ) but not his ydna ( which had to come from s1 ) . 
  his final genetic makeup :, 
  - somewhere between ~ 0 % and ~ 50 % * gg * that both john and jane have ; necessarily nonzero due to the fact that they must share mtdna, 
  - somewhere between 0 % and ~ 50 % * gg * that only jane has ; if you add this and the previous category together , then you get slightly more than 50 % ; it 's possible for this category to be absolutely none, 
  - ~ 50 % from s1 , unknown and uninteresting in origin, 
  - ** b2 dad : ** this guy 's more complicated . 
  his father is john , so ~ 50 % of his dna is * gg * or * gt * , and ~ 50 % of his dna is from s2 . 
  his y chromosome is from * gt * , passed down from jake to john and then from john to him . 
  his mtdna is from s2 . 
  due to the fact that his father 's a beta kid , there 's no doubt about how much dna he has in common with jane or john , or for that matter jake ; all * gg * dna belongs to jane , so 25 % of his dna is shared with jane , and john 's his father , so ( slightly less than ) 50 % of his dna is shared with john . 
  final breakdown :, 
  - 0 - ~ 50 % * gg * dna , shared with jane and john, 
  - ~ 0 - ~ 50 % * gt * dna , shared with jake and john ; includes his ydna ; added together with the previous category , they constitute about half his genome, 
  - ~ 50 % dna from s2 , of unknown and uninteresting origin, 
  - ** the spouses : ** genes are still all from an unknown source and therefore boring . 
  ### in the event that the dads are both sons of their respective sburb-player parents , and are genetically identical, 
  to start off with , this means that dad both :, 
  - shares ~ 50 % of his dna with jane , including his mtdna , and, 
  - shares ~ 50 % of his dna with john , including his ydna, 
  but :, 
  - john shares ~ 50 % of his dna with jane , and, 
  - john shares ~ 50 % of his dna with jake , including his ydna, 
  meaning :, 
  - dad 's dna must be composed of somewhere between ~ 50 % and ~ 100 % * gg * , including his mtdna , and, 
  - dad 's dna must be composed of somewhere between ~ 0 % and ~ 50 % * gt * , including his ydna , and, 
  - dad 's dna is composed of somewhere between 0 % and ~ 50 % unknown dna from s1 and s2, 
  dad inherits ~ 50 % * gg * dna from jane , and up to ~ 50 % * gg * dna from john . 
  these might not overlap at all , causing up to nearly 100 % of his dna to be * gg * ( with the most extreme case making him just jane with one of her x chromosomes swapped out for jake 's y chromosome ) , or they might overlap completely , in which case ~ 50 % of his dna is free to be inherited from the spouses . 
  if we call the percent overlap between the * gg * dna inherited from jane and john x % ( x = 50 being complete overlap ) , and the percent non - * gg * ( that is , * gt * ) dna inherited from john y % ( which is most 50-x ) , his genetic composition is the following :, 
  - ( ~ 100 - ( x+y ) ) % * gg * , including mtdna, 
  - y % * gt * , including ydna, 
  - x % unknown from s1 and s2 ( more about the distribution later ), 
  the overlap has to be made up for by new genes from the spouses . 
  let 's call this x % `` outside '' dna * xx * . 
  due to dad 's double parentage , i ca n't write a comprehensive breakdown for him detailing how much dna he shares with everyone , but read on for an examination of his parents . 
  the consequences for dad are less interesting than the consequences for s1 and s2 . 
  dad can inherit up to 100 % sburb-player dna , but in either given universe can only inherit ~ 50 % of it directly from a sburb player . 
  the rest must be provided by the spouses . 
  which part of the rest depends on the universe . 
  - ** universe b1 : ** dad gets ~ 50 % of the * gg * dna he needs from jane including the mtdna , but still needs ( ~ 50 - ( x+y ) ) % * gg * dna , y % * gt * dna , and x % * xx * dna from s1 , including the ydna . 
  - ** universe b2 : ** dad gets all the y % * gt * dna he needs from john including the ydna , as well as ( ~ 50-y ) % of the * gg * dna , but needs ( ~ 50-x ) % more * gg * dna and x % * xx * dna from s2 , including the mtdna . 
  this gives the following genetic breakdowns for s1 and s2 :, 
  - ** ( ~ 50 + x ) % ** of his genes , which does not include his ydna but does include his mtdna , comes from an unknown source .
