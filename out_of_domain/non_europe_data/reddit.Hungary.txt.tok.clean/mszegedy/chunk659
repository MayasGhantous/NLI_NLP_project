  we call the part that he passes on to dad * xx * , which comprises x % of s1 's , s2 's , and dad 's genomes . 
  he shares this same part with s2 , who will * also * pass it on to dad in universe b2 . 
  dad 's genes do , after all , have to remain constant between the two timelines , including the foreign part . 
  - ** ( ~ 50 - ( x+y ) ) % ** of his genes , which does not include his mtdna , comes from * gg * , and he will pass it on to dad . 
  he shares between 0 % and nearly all of it with john ( the rest of the ( ~ 50-y ) % * gg * dna dad shares with john being passed on to him by jane ) , and he shares the rest of it with s2 , who has exactly the ( ~ 50-x ) % * gg * dna that dad * does n't * get from john . 
  - ** y % ** of his genes , which includes his ydna , comes from * gt * . 
  he shares all of this with john , and none of it with s2 . 
  - ** ( ~ 50 + x ) % ** of her genes are of unknown origin , with x % of them being * xx * . 
  the deal here is exactly the same as with s1 , except for her , her mtdna is n't part of this category . 
  - ** ( ~ 50-x ) % ** of her genes are * gg * genes that john does n't pass on to dad , but which dad got from jane . 
  this includes at least her mtdna . 
  ta-da !, 
  boy , that was complicated . 
  let 's imagine some extreme scenarios :, 
  - ** x = ~ 0 , y = ~ 0 : ** john only shares his mitochondrial dna with dad , and dad only inherits jake 's y chromosome from john 's * gt * dna . 
  the result is that adult jane only shares ~ 50 % of her dna with s1 , adult john shares up to ~ 50 % of his dna with s2 , but dad ends up almost a perfect clone of jane , except for his y chromosome , which is from jake . 
  - ** x = ~ 0 , y = ~ 50 : ** john passes on only * gt * dna to dad . 
  the consequences for the amount of genes shared between jane and john and their respective spouses is the same , but dad 's genetic makeup changes to ~ 50 % * gg * dna and ~ 50 % * gt * dna -- in other words , sharing anywhere between ~ 50 % and the entire 100 % of his dna with john , and being approximately a brother to jade ( while being a weird half-clone to john ) . 
  - ** x = ~ 50 , y = ~ 0 : ** every gene that john passes on to dad is a * gg * gene that jane * also * passes on to dad . 
  this means that adult jane shares 0 % of her dna with s1 ( who , however , still has jake 's y chromosome ) , and adult john shares almost 0 % of his dna with s2 ( who , however , still has jane 's and therefore john 's mtdna ) , but dad only gets ~ 50 % of his genes from jane and john combined , while getting the other ~ 50 % from the spouses . 
  a happy medium . 
  this kind of genetics is quite weird , but it 's fun to imagine it being the norm . 
  you 'd have four parents !, 
  there 's also the scenarios where one dad is the son of the sburb player in one universe , but adopted in the other , but those are kind of boring and i 'm tired . 
  i hoped you guys found this funny and confusing . 
  edit : i just realized , this assumes that slime mixing still only transmits mtdna through the female line . 
  if it 's not , then the genetic makeup of the dads and spouses is n't affected ( since dad gets his mtdna biologically from jane herself and s2 ) , but it means the beta kids did n't necessarily inherit their mtdna from jane and roxy , rather the harlegberts from jane * or * jake , and the strilondes from roxy * or * dirk . 
  it would n't have burned a life , and his regular body would have entered the medium safely pretty much immediately anyway . 
  come to think of it , he could even ask squarewave to do it , since it might be hard to do on your own . 
  a couple years ago i had the horrible idea of making an abugida out of latin letters and diacritics . 
  it has finally come to fruition . 
  th 's 's st.nd | d am ' | ` cn ` ngl ` sh ab!g `` da . 
  the consonants remain unchanged . 
  the vowels , however , now go like this :, 
  short-ish vowels :, 
  - [ \u0259 ] : inherent vowel ; indicated with <a at the ends and beginnings of words, 
  - [ \u025a ] and [ \u025d ] : < |  ; when preceding the syllable nucleus , <r, 
  - [ \u026a ] and [ \u025b ] : < ' , 
  - [ \u028a ] and [ \u028c ] : < \\* , 
  long-ish vowels :, 
  - [ a\u028a ] , [ o\u028a ] , and [ ( j ) u\u02d0 ] : < ! , 
  - [ e\u026a ] : < ; , 
  - [ a\u026a ] : < : , 
  - also <e is sometimes used to show softened consonants when needed , eg < st | ; nge |  , `` stranger '' . 
  i was going to use more combining diacritics , but that was hard to type , so you get this instead . 
  a number of common words that have a commonly softened vowel are written with no vowel .

  is it overwhelmingly common to have descending tone be the `` default '' ? 
  is it overwhelmingly common for questions to contain an upward inflection ? 
  is there an upper limit on the complexity of tone melodies ? 
  also , unrelatedly , how does semantic tone affect intonation ? 
  does a two-tone system make large jumps in intonation infeasible , for example ( since a too-large jump would confuse the low and high tones ) ? 
  i heard a comment here claim this a month ago , but i have n't been able to find a source for it , and anecdotally i ca n't see it either . 
  i * did * find [ this ] ( http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00705/abstract ) paper , but it investigates l2 ability , not l1 . 
  also , i find it strange that they found better l2 ability versus age as well , because if both the hypothesis in this post and the conclusion of the paper are true , then what do the younger siblings speak ? 
  nothing ? 
  on miller 's planet : i thought of tides at first as the most likely explanation , but the brief period ( ~ 3 hrs ) between the two waves makes it doubtful . 
  either the planet 's rotating really fast , or there 's more than two peaks . 
  all of that water abrading against the surface of miller 's planet should have slowed down its rotation a lot , to way less than 6 hrs/day . 
  ( a couple people here have even noted that the abrasion from the waves would logically be what makes that planet so ridiculously flat . ), 
  the `` more than two peaks '' thing , on the other hand , just makes no sense for how tides work . 
  the shape of the waves also does n't really point to tides ; they would have to have been huge and rather elliptical , feeling more like a noticeable gradual rise and fall in the sea level with little/no detectable slope rather than just two big brief waves . 
  i 'm far from an astrogeologist , though , so there might be a way to make this work . 
  on mann 's planet : i 'm aware that it 's iceland . 
  i 've been there . 
  but i find the vertical structure really interesting , and i 'm curious as to whether anyone 's bothered imagining more of it . 
  from what i can gather , they involve :, 
  - pastel colors , especially light magenta , light cyan , and light gray or white . 
  ( yellow and the rest seem to be less important . ), 
  alternatively , pastel rainbows . 
  - abstract designs , especially various lines pointing in arbitrary directions , gradients , and pixel grids, 
  - 90s american computing , particularly computers and 3d renders from the period . 
  also wordart like in the subreddit logo . 
  and the submissions are usually from japan . 
  in general i can get behind this . 
  i am a fan of pastel secondary and primary colors , pixel art , and simple abstract shapes . 
  i do like products from 90s america , especially computers and tracksuits . 
  i think the occasional addition of a marble statue can be an entirely classy move that makes or breaks a piece of art . 
  but this subreddit seems to be built around arousing some sort of very particular and difficult to grasp passion that i just ca n't get a sense of . 
  for example , one of the top submissions of all time is [ an animation of a cd turning over . 
  i can see that it is japanese , and i can see that the cd is a 90s sort of thing , and i can see that the colors are pretty light , but what is there about it that turns on the lightbulb in your brain that tells you , `` aha !, 
  this is extremely vaporwave !, 
  that really hit the spot ! '', 
  i just see an anime . 
  and where did this originate ? 
  wikipedia says vaporwave * music * originated on 4chan in 2011 , but the visual aesthetic must have coalesced somehow on its own , even if in parallel . 
  there had to have been some sort of seed or precursor in everyone 's consciousness , probably some sort of sense of 90s aesthetics , but this is different and unique and more specific . 
  where does the marble thing come from in particular ? 
  the rest all have to do with 90s video gaming but the marble statues i just ca n't quite figure out . 
  not to say i do n't like it .
