  - i do n't have expansion or exploration ideas , i have administrative . 
  to be fair , i have n't sunk any points into them yet , but would the sacrifice of swapping them out for exp/exp ideas allow me to become powerful enough ?

  i could stand to wait 6 years , and then declare war on someone and wipe out bashkiria 's army in the process , but that 's tricky to set up and they 'll convert all my precious shamanist provinces by then . 
  one insidious idea i thought of was driving up * my * unrest , and letting the vassals take care of the rebels , thereby lowering their liberty desire , but that would take too long to happen , and might weaken me in turn , driving the ld back up . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xhl5mfn.png ) is the situation i am currently in . 
  i sold bashkiria all of my provinces except one , and i bankrupted myself so that i could become shamanist . 
  however , i can only start annexing bashkiria in feb 1480 , and every time , by then they build up their army enough to have ~ 55 % liberty desire . 
  - my bankruptcy lasts until 1486 , so i ca n't go to war until then . 
  ( all my stupid allies ditched me when i went bankrupt . 
  thankfully , muscovy is currently occupied with kicking novgorod 's ass . ), 
  - i can only `` placate local rulers '' if my prestige is 0 or above , and i ca n't recover significant amounts of prestige without going to war . 
  - i do n't have any diplomatic reputation advisors available , and even if i did , one would only lower the liberty desire by ~ 2.2 % , which is n't enough . 
  - i 've tried building my army past the forcelimit , but it does n't seem to work . 
  - i dumped all of my monarch points before bankruptcy into development , so now it would cost heaps of points to improve cheldyn enough to support a significantly larger army . 
  - nizhny novgorod is far too valuable a march to let go . 
  i 'd rather wait 6 more years . 
  - the unrest in bashkiria is too low to spawn any rebels . 
  their only positive-unrest province is whichever they 're currently converting to sunni , but they 're shamanist provinces , so they go quickly , and will never result in rebels . 
  i suppose they could get one of those events that spawns rebels , but that 's far from reliable . 
  - enabling scutage does n't seem to reduce the size of their army , even if i do it while they 're still loyal ( i.e. 
  at 48.9 % ld , but whatever ) . 
  - i do n't have expansion or exploration ideas , i have administrative . 
  to be fair , i have n't sunk any points into them yet , but would the sacrifice of swapping them out for exp/exp ideas allow me to become powerful enough ? 
  and would it be worth it in the long run ?

  stuff that even in hindsight seems unlikely . 
  individual strange decisions by leaders that brought about national consequences , or freak weather that turned the tides of wars , that kind of stuff . 
  there 's been at least one thread like this before , but the mechanics have changed significantly since then . 
  the top answer , `` invading russia is doomed to fail '' , is also no longer true , since muscovy was nerfed this patch . 
  edit : itt : either `` everything in this game is unrealistic '' or `` everything in this game is realistic '', 
  edit 2 : the former edit is no longer true, 
  for example , as orthodox perm , i levied a church tax . 
  when i bankrupted myself , i still had the church tax modifier , despite being shaman . 
  since so many religions have missionary strength modifiers , it might be interesting to see how one can max out missionary strength . 
  i am a hungarian learning tagalog . 
  in hungary and the surrounding countries we have a thriving folk music scene which i like . 
  one of my favorite folk musicians , for example , is jarom\u00edr nohavica , a czech guy . 
  he does beautiful songs about nature and life in eastern europe , such as [ `` t\u011b\u0161\u00ednsk\u00e1 '' ] ( http://www.nohavica.cz/cz/tvorba/texty/tesinska.htm ) , about what it would have been like to live in t\u011b\u0161\u00edn 100 years ago ( `` and i would have probably loved her for 200 years '' ) . 
  music is a good way to learn ( parts of ) a language and i thought i might listen to some folk music in tagalog . 
  but they do n't seem to include these long-form pastoral songs or ballads . 
  instead they are mainly short and about specific topics , or no topic at all . 
  this is because they are songs that were passed down , not songs with known authors ; the same distinction exists in eastern europe , too . 
  this is fine and i will gladly listen to them , but is n't there at least * one * person writing longer folk music in ballad form ? 
  i understand that the wikipedia article on the topic [ literally says ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philippine_folk_music#popularity ) that it is not as popular as in hungary or the czech republic , but tagalog has 80 million speakers . 
  surely someone has come up with something . 
  besides ` ack ` 's website itself there is like practically nothing on the internet about it , despite it being a fairly ubiquitous programming tool . 
  i 'd like to learn how to use ` ack ` effectively ( instead of ... ` sed ` ? 
  or ` grep ` ? 
  i 'm not good at either of those ) , and i 'm disappointed that the only information on it available seems to be the documentation , which is good for reference , not learning . 
  does anyone know any tutorials ? 
  i 'm sure there are some but google is n't returning anything, 
  edit : i have made a mistake, 
  what led to the popularity of [ tuk-tuks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/auto_rickshaw ) in developing countries ? 
  is it especially cheap ? 
  also , why are there so many in lisbon ? 
  i 've seen the occasional post here where ai perm has conquered all of russia . 
  if ai perm can do it , then so can you , right ? 
  except not really , not at all . 
  i even have the additional goal of converting to shamanism asap , but muscovy and novgorod or some horde kill me every time , especially when the golden horde breaks its alliance with me/stops supporting my independence for no good reason . 
  how do i get a good start as perm ? 
  my basic strategy is :, 
  - get novgorod to support my independence, 
  - not count on lithuania ( they always seem to get in a pu under poland , despite them almost never doing that when i 'm not playing perm ), 
  - wait until russia 's army weakens in a war with kazan, 
  - get the golden horde to support my independence, 
  - get diplo ideas, 
  - declare independence, 
  - not die, 
  - take some land that i can release a vassal from , like bashkiria or parts of nizhny novgorod, 
  - release vassal , sell all my land to them, 
  - start integrating my vassal, 
  - go bankrupt exactly when the integration completes, 
  - ** not die ** ( this is the part i am having trouble with ), 
  i 've pulled off some really impressive things in these failed runs , like getting to 25 % warscore in an independence war without funding my army or having any allies using fabian strategy and timing my war when russia had rebels ( i still lost though , fucken '' -89 relative strength of alliances '' modifier ) , but i always lose . 
  could someone please help me out ? 
  i took another several stabs at reuniting the uralic peoples and failed again . 
  in this post , i will vent about the different factors that need to go right for a great perm run . 
  muscovy 's first target | lithuania 's attitude towards muscovy | gh 's attitude towards muscovy | kazan 's attitude towards muscovy | polish-lithuanian union | best +1 dip advisor | outcome, 
  ( any ) | ( any ) | ( any ) | ( any ) | ( any ) | neither relations nor dip rep | run is a wash , restart . 
  ( any ) | neutral | neutral | neutral | ( any ) | ( any ) | run is a wash , restart . 
  ( any ) | neutral | neutral | rival | ( any ) | ( any ) | pray that kazan attacks muscovy before muscovy attacks novgorod , then watch miserably as muscovy crushes both . 
  novgorod | neutral | rival | ( any ) | ( any ) | relations | hope that the war with novgorod weakens muscovy enough that gh will consider supporting your independence , then watch miserably as muscovy crushes both . 
  novgorod | neutral | rival | ( any ) | ( any ) | dip rep | see previous row . 
  novgorod | rival | neutral | ( any ) | yes | relations | try to get lithuania 's support before they get pu 'd or novgorod gets crushed , then watch miserably as they get pu 'd far before when you have their support . 
  novgorod | rival | neutral | ( any ) | yes | dip rep | try to get lithuania 's support before they get pu 'd or novgorod gets crushed , then watch miserably as they get pu 'd exactly when you declare war . 
  novgorod | rival | rival | ( any ) | yes | relations | forget lithuania , hope that the war with novgorod weakens muscovy enough that gh will consider supporting your independence , then watch miserably as muscovy crushes both . 
  novgorod | rival | rival | ( any ) | yes | dip rep | see previous row . 
  kazan | neutral | rival | ( any ) | yes | relations | the second most typical great perm run . 
  hope the war with kazan will weaken muscovy enough for gh to consider supporting you , and hope that gh does n't get in a war in the meantime . 
  if the independence war succeeds , you still need to somehow seize land with a releasable vassal , and then later not die next to a strong muscovy and novgorod . 
  if muscovy goes to war with you again , they 'll probably vassalize you again , and this time you wo n't be able to get anyone to support you , because you 're shamanist . 
  kazan | neutral | rival | ( any ) | yes | dip rep | you might not need muscovy to attack kazan to be able to get gh 's support , but otherwise it 's the same thing . 
  kazan | rival | neutral | ( any ) | yes | relations | try to get lithuania 's support before they get pu 'd , then watch miserably as they get pu 'd far before when you have their support .
