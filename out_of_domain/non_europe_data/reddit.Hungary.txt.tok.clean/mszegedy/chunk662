  forget lithuania , hope the war with kazan will weaken muscovy enough for gh to consider supporting you , and hope that gh does n't get in a war in the meantime . 
  if the independence war succeeds , you still need to somehow seize land with a releasable vassal , and then later not die next to a strong muscovy and novgorod . 
  if muscovy goes to war with you again , they 'll probably vassalize you again , and this time you wo n't be able to get anyone to support you , because you 're shamanist . 
  kazan | rival | rival | ( any ) | yes | dip rep | you might not need muscovy to attack kazan to be able to get gh 's support , but otherwise it 's the same thing . 
  ( any ) | neutral | ( any ) | ( any ) | no | ( any ) | plays out as though the union had happened anyway . 
  see appropriate row . 
  novgorod | rival | ( any ) | ( any ) | no | relations | panic when muscovy attacks novgorod while you 're still their vassal . 
  wait for ld to tick up to 50 , declare war , then watch in amazement as you and lithuania get crushed .

  in the event that you can declare war on muscovy before they go after novgorod , you might have a chance ...

  it sucks , so hard !, 
  ( and no , `` great perm '' is not an achievement . 
  it 's my term for a run where you control all the uralic peoples as shamanist perm . ), 
  or really , the fact that they committed the murders at all . 
  eridan 's at least a little believable ; he 's spent his whole life wanting to kill everyone , and getting continually frustrated by feferi . 
  it makes sense that pushing him would result in her death . 
  but vriska does n't make much sense in general . 
  yes , she was always an asshole to tavros , but she only killed people she did n't know or have any sympathy for . 
  she knew tavros as a person , and was even romantically interested in him . 
  granted , she could have been angry at him for letting her bleed out on the quest cocoon , but i get the impression that she was pretty much over that by that point . 
  and then * neither * of them feel significant amounts of remorse , for killing one of their only friends . 
  this is the sort of thing that historically tears people apart , even if they 're used to killing other people . 
  troll psychology has been shown to be pretty much the exact same thing as human psychology in other respects , so that cop-out does n't work . 
  they might be terrible people , but they still have feelings , especially vriska ( who is in all other respects a very well-developed character ) . 
  or there could just be some key conversation or two i 'm not remembering . 
  it 's been a long time since i 've read homestuck . 
  in my perm game , i want to give modern mainland sweden and norway to sapmi , the rest of modern finland ( minus \u00c5land ) to finland , and all of the livonian order and riga to estonia . 
  however , i would like them to culture-convert this land to whatever their culture is . 
  this is not a trivial task , because the ai only culture-converts under specific circumstances . 
  it is most likely to convert when a culture in a province is not accepted . 
  so i 'd need to feed provinces to them in such an order that the culture they 're trying to convert is always unaccepted . 
  for all three cases , the only way to actually do this is to boost their development before feeding them the provinces , because their initial development is so low that * any * province fed to them would make their culture become accepted .

  the monarch point values are experimentally determined . 
  it 's interesting that sapmi 's boost costs the most , when it 's got the least value added . 
  anyway , i tried this out in a test game , and nobody 's converting anything . 
  the provinces are the right religion , the nations of the primary cultures do n't exist , they have enough diplo points ... in fact , i tagged over myself , and it 's possible to click the button . 
  what gives ? 
  i mean , i can be patient , but converting one province at a time nonstop , it would take sapmi 90 years to convert all of the scandinavian provinces i want it to , and i ran the game for over 10 years and they did n't even start converting anything . 
  a 10 year delay between provinces is unacceptable !, 
  how do i get the ai to culture-convert ?
