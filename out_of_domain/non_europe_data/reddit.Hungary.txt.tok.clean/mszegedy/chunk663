  the monarch point values are experimentally determined . 
  it 's interesting that sapmi 's boost costs the most , when it 's got the least value added . 
  anyway , i tried this out in a test game , and nobody 's converting anything . 
  the provinces are the right religion , the nations of the primary cultures do n't exist , they have enough diplo points ... in fact , i tagged over myself , and it 's possible to click the button . 
  what gives ? 
  i mean , i can be patient , but converting one province at a time nonstop , it would take sapmi 90 years to convert all of the scandinavian provinces i want it to , and i ran the game for over 10 years and they did n't even start converting anything . 
  a 10 year delay between provinces is unacceptable !, 
  how do i get the ai to culture-convert ? 
  brothers , i need help with getting a rig . 
  i would finally like to dump several thousand dollars on the rig of my dreams . 
  but i am not like most of you . 
  i do n't like pc towers , no matter how powerful they are . 
  you ca n't use those on a plane , or at a lecture , or at the beach , or in a billion other situations . 
  this is why i prefer laptops , because they can do all of those things . 
  however , i tend to use my laptops so much that even the fairly durable ones suffer wear and tear . 
  i currently own a lenovo thinkpad t430s . 
  in the two or so years that i 've owned it , i have sent it in to get repaired 5 times , and it currently has an extremely badly abraded corner as well as several parts that are n't quite put together properly , because i 'm a little embarrassed to send it in to get it fixed * again * and put * yet another * new plastic case on it . 
  that 's why my rig of my dreams is a rugged laptop . 
  but i use my computer all the time , especially for gaming . 
  i 'm not going to compromise on performance or battery life when i 'm going to spend an unspecified huge amount of money on this rig . 
  i want it to be at the very least equal to , or ideally exceed my current laptop in pretty much every way . 
  and , lastly , the most difficult requirement : ** it ca n't be too heavy . 
  ** part of it 's that i do n't want to lug around a heavy laptop all the time , but the main reason is that i like to lay on back on a bed or couch and use my laptop like that . 
  that would become really uncomfortable if it were crushing my stomach . 
  to sum it up :, 
  - at the very least an i5 processor , better an i7, 
  - big-ish screen , at least 1600x900 pixels but i 'll settle for similar resolutions, 
  - discrete graphics card that can be switched off in favor of integrated graphics to conserve power ( and it should be a * good * card , my nvidia nvs 5400m struggles a lot on programs that should be fairly graphics-light , like transistor and terraria ), 
  - space for both an ssd and a magnet hard drive ( for both fast bootup , and lots of storage space ), 
  - long battery life ( my thinkpad can surf the internet for 6-ish hours ), 
  - keyboard and mouse that do n't suck to use ( the more bulgey the better , but the most rugged ones understandably only have membranes ; still , even those vary in quality ), 
  - light enough to keep on my stomach for long periods of time, 
  - very rugged , of course , especially temperature-resistant ( in both directions ), 
  i 've found a couple laptops that meet most of the specifications , but not all of them . 
  - ** getac x500 : ** high-performance , expansible , rugged , but fuckin ' heavy , and battery life and input apparently both suck ( need to get my hands on one , investigate further ), 
  - ** getac v110 : ** light , very long battery life , rugged , but does n't have a real graphics card and its screen is kinda small ; also , liable to have same input problems as x500 , and its single hinge is kind of unconvincing in its ruggedness, 
  - ** dell 14 '' rugged extreme : ** fairly high-performance , very rugged , keyboard and mouse are pretty okay , good battery life if you get the 9-cell , but it 's pretty heavy , the screen 's small , and it looks somewhat less badass than the getac laptops, 
  - ** dell 14 '' rugged : ** has similar specs to the rugged extreme , $ 1000 cheaper , and half a kg lighter , but less rugged , not even completely dustproof , and still pretty heavy, 
  i 'm leaning towards the dell 14 '' rugged extreme . 
  does anyone have advice or suggestions ? 
  how do the graphics cards compare ? 
  i have noticed that i and my younger relatives speak somewhat different dialects of textspeak . 
  some differences include :, 
  - emoticons vs emojis, 
  - use of / / , \\ _ \\ _ , \\*\\* , and allcaps vs allcaps and inconsistent allcaps to emphasize, 
  - a couple lexical differences like `` plox '' vs `` pls/plz '', 
  - use of 4chan arrows vs use of hashtags, 
  - absence vs presence of lexical innovations like `` smh '' and `` ik '', 
  - presence vs absence of register innovations like '' !! 1 ! '', 
  and '' \\* roleplaying \\* '', 
  together they create a very clear divide between us , and i 'm interested in learning about the origins of our respective dialects . 
  i 'm assuming mine is mostly influenced by usenet and all-text platforms like irc , while theirs is more modern texting language developed around 2008 with the advent of smartphones . 
  has anyone written papers about the diachronic development of english textspeak and its various dialects ? 
  ( or perhaps just a comparison of english as used on various social networking sites . ), 
  the paper in question is `` the history of uralic linguistics '' , not that it matters much . 
  while i know about the pre-germanic substrate , i would n't think a big chunk of untraceable vocabulary would stop people from classifying proto-germanic as indo-european . 
  it sure did n't stop hungarian from getting classified as uralic . 
  edit : no , wait , i 'm accusing the wrong guy . 
  the citation is `` the problem of the ural-altaic relationship , '' denis sinor , 1988 . 
  he writes :, 
   when one considers that the position of, 
  germanic ( not to mention tokharian ! ), 
  among the indo-european, 
  languages is still the subject of controversy , the obscurity of the uralic, 
  and altaic relationship becomes less surprising . 
  reading it again , it 's actually a little ambiguous ; it looks like he could have just meant germanic 's classification * within * ie , but the way he phrased it makes that sound a little less likely . 
  edit 2 : completely unrelatedly , how did ** dw - * become * erk - * in armenian ? 
  i can sort of see / d / and / r / , and the / e / can be explained as anaptyxis , but the / k / ?
