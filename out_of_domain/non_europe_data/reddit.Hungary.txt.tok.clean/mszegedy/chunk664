  perhaps dw -  edw -  erd ( w ) -  ertk -  erk - ? 
  i dunno , it seems to me that one of these has to be true :, 
  - the comparative method attributes too many differences to different consonants, 
  - languages with more consonants are more prone to survival, 
  - the limited amount of proto-languages we 've reconstructed happen to have more consonants than usual for their families, 
  i have seen this phenomenon happen with pie , pu , pan , proto-mansi , and proto-yukagir . 
  it 's weird and it makes me trust the comparative method less . 
  what the fuck did you just fucking say about yukaghir , you little bitch ? 
  i 'll have you know it 's the most widely-considered external classification for uralic , and it 's been implicated in numerous uralic loans in evenki , and it has over 300 confirmed uralic cognates . 
  it has foul harmony and it 's the most typologically uralic language in the entirety of siberia . 
  proto-uralo-yukaghir is nothing to me but just another node . 
  i will reconstruct it the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet ? 
  think again , fucker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of uralicists across finland and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm , maggot . 
  the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your comparative method . 
  you 're fucking dead , kid . 
  proto-uralo-yukaghir can be anywhere , anytime , and it can be reconstructed in over seven hundred ways , and that 's just with bare morphemes . 
  not only is its morphology extensively well-motivated , but it is supported by the entire arsenal of janhunen 's uralic glossary and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable hypothesis off the face of the continent , you little shit . 
  if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking tongue . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , you goddamn idiot . 
  i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it . 
  you 're fucking dead , kiddo . 
  the culture mechanic from cossacks will be infinitely useful for this aar . 
  i 'm especially hoping it 'll let me convert provinces back to samoyed and yukaghir after i 've colonized them . 
  also it might let me `` unmigrate '' the hungarians ; i 'll experiment the feasibility of that once the patch is actually out .

  title says all . 
  are there innovations that affected both ? 
  they seem to have vaguely similar phoneme inventories , for example . 
  i 'd also like to hear about the western arabic varieties like maghrebi , since they 're in the region . 
  i 'm migrating to a keyboard-only layout , and i 've been wondering how to replace all of my tray icons . 
  clock and battery are simple because they do n't need mousing over , but i regularly click my ` nm-applet ` wi-fi icon to connect to networks and turn my wi-fi on and off . 
  what 's a keyboard-only solution to managing networks ( that is n't as unnecessarily complicated as using ` ifconfig ` or whatever , and is n't as butt-ugly as ` wifi-menu ` ) ? 
  for reference , i 'm probably gon na be using i3 as my wm and i3-bar or dzen as my bar ( with applets from conky ) . 
  as an amateur uralicist i 'd probably pick either 6kya or the eve of the mongol invasions . 
  the first one because i 'd get to observe proto-uralic and its relatives in the flesh ( as well as pre-ie europe ) , and the second one because the mongol invasions were a major extinction event for the uralic languages and many other families . 
  as a bonus , i 'd also get to observe america right before the europeans arrived . 
  due to hardware issues , i 'm currently having to use windows 10 off of a magnetic disk ( rather than linux off of an ssd , which works fine ) . 
  i 've been getting crashes every time i try to load a 3rd world . 
  it even crashes steam with itself . 
  steps to reproduce :, 
  - load a world, 
  - save and exit, 
  - load another world, 
  - save and exit, 
  - ( try to ) load yet another world, 
  is this a known issue ? 
  edit : occasionally , just saving and exiting from the second world does it . 
  [ removed ], 
  i find paul 's notes a nice reference and occasional refresher . 
  however , now they are completely overwhelmed during the day . 
  any alternatives ? 
  i 've ended up homebrewing a relatively simple wargame for my friends , improvising using what resources we have available . 
  it uses hexes , but is closer to a miniatures game than a h&c one , since units are essentially treated individually . 
  in it , lots of things happen on every xth turn . 
  every 3rd turn , a city produces a unit . 
  every 2nd turn , a workshop produces a unit . 
  after 3 turns , an `` erupting volcano '' tile turns back into a `` dormant volcano '' tile . 
  and so on . 
  there are also a few turn-by-turn probabilities to keep track of . 
  for example , at the start of each turn , every dormant volcano tile has a 1 % chance of erupting . 
  i am bad at keeping track of all of these things . 
  is there a webapp that would let me keep track of them ? 
  i can write one , but i want to know if there 's already something in place . 
  ( it 's also to just do this by pencil and paper . 
  just keep track of the turn number , and write in a period and an offset for periodic things . 
  but a webapp would be more helpful . ), 
  i am making a wargame for my friends , for which we need terrain hex tiles . 
  ( normally you 'd use a board with hexes printed on it , but this game involves a terra incognita system . ), 
  i know blank cardstock hexes are dirt cheap . 
  i know getting someone to print your designs on cardstock hexes is less cheap but also doable . 
  however , would n't it be cheaper to not customize , than to get your own designs printed ? 
  is there some place that sells standard terrain hex tiles ? 
  the rates i 'm looking at are $ 20-30 per 60 hexes . 
  i thought i 'd start top-down with the list of highest-grossing films in the philippines , but it 's generally garbage by adam standards . 
  so i 'm at the mercy of you guys now . 
  i sort of enjoyed * metro manila * at least , although i had just watched * el norte * prior to it , so the beginning just felt boring in comparison . 
  when windows repairs itself , it stupidly overwrites the mbr of every bootable disk to look for ` bootmgr ` , and installs the windows boot components on every bootable disk . 
  this is known . 
  i performed windows repair on my dual-boot system , and now i want my mbr back . 
  first , after booting from my systemrescuecd , i deleted the superfluous windows boot components from my linux boot partition ( the `` real '' windows boot partition is on another disk entirely ) . 
  if i boot the system in this state , it tells me , `` bootmgr is missing ; press any key to restart '' . 
  then , i had trouble writing the mbr to the disk . 
  the basic idea of it , according to the wiki and some older posts in the arch forums , is :, 
  dd bs = 440 count = 1 conv = notrunc if = usr/lib/syslinux / bios/mbr . bin of = / dev/sdb, 
  the ` conv = notrunc ` , as i understand it , is optional . 
  i 've tried this method using the ` mbr.bin ` from ` / usr/lib/syslinux ` on my ( mounted ) actual arch install , and the ` mbr.bin ` from a downloaded syslinux package from the arch package repository . 
  neither of them changed the situation ; the computer still tells me `` bootmgr is missing '' , even though i make sure to boot from the disk where i have purportedly reoverwritten the mbr . 
  my next step will be creating an arch install disk somehow and running part of the syslinux bootstrapper , but before i waste an hour on that , i wanted to get / r/archlinux 's opinion on the issue . 
  i was doing mtg for the first time , and since i did n't know enough about the game to create a strong deck , i decided to try a themed deck instead .
