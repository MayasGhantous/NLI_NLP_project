  cue getting two avacyns and one sigarda . 
  ( both very powerful cards , but the latter restricting me to a white-green deck , which is not good themewise . ), 
  eventually i figured i could go without sigarda to build the white-black deck my heart desired , and naturally got creamed in the first round . 
  my opponent was very helpful and nice , and helped me with some strategy as well as putting together a good white-green deck for me . 
  ( themewise , still weird , but the overpoweredness made up for it by plenty . ), 
  unlike sarah , however , i did n't go on to help someone discover the nature of sexism , win a couple times , and get a date . 
  i lost every subsequent game instead . 
  but i had a lot of fun !, 
  thanks a lot to dan to accidentally prepping me for this . 
  i 'm looking to buy eu4 for a few friends of mine . 
  ( just the base game ; they 're not the sort to play anything but multiplayer . ), 
  has there in recorded eu4 history ever been some sort of `` family pack '' of 3-4 steam keys at a bulk discount ? 
  or should i just wait for the next sale ? 
  everything happened in the way that you would have expected it to from the past rest of the story . 
  perhaps the biggest surprise was the new earth being populated solely by carapacians , and neither humans nor trolls ( apart from the players ) . 
  but everything else was very straightforward . 
  given that this is not usually what somebody wants out of an ending , are we happy with this ? 
  one very common complaint about act 7 is that it failed to resolve any character arcs . 
  it seems hussie did n't think any of them needed resolving at that point ; that is , that they had already been resolved previously . 
  this would shed light on a perspective on act 7 that i have n't really seen yet : that it feels unsatisfying because we did n't realize earlier that everyone 's character arcs were closing , and we expected it to happen now . 
  assuming this interpretation , we can go back and look at homestuck to try to point out when characters ' arcs supposedly got resolved . 
  let 's try :, 
  ## kids, 
  - ** rose : ** honestly , ca n't think of a good one . 
  copying and pasting is easy , though . 
  - ** dave : ** [ 03/31/16 - '' [ a6a6i5 ] = = = =  '' ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=009940 ) or [ 04/06/16 - '' [ s ] collide . 
  - ** jade : ** starting at [ 03/30/16 - '' [ a6a6i5 ] = = = =  '' ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=009897 ), 
  - ** jane : ** pretty much never ; she seemed to stop being a round character sometime around the gigapause, 
  - ** jake : ** eh , the best resolution that he got was [ 04/06/16 - '' [ s ] collide . '' ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=009987 ) . 
  i agree that it is unsatisfactory . 
  - ** dirk : ** starting at [ 03/31/16 - '' [ a6a6i5 ] = = = =  '' ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=009934 ), 
  - ** davesprite : ** starting at [ 03/30/16 - '' [ a6a6i5 ] = = = =  '' ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=009897 ), 
  - ** karkat : ** eh , the best resolution he got was [ 04/06/16 - '' [ s ] collide . '' ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=009987 ) . 
  i agree that it is unsatisfactory . 
  - ** kanaya : ** hard to think of a good one . 
  - ** terezi : ** [ 07/27/15 - '' [ s ] terezi : remem8er . 
  - ** vriska : ** [ 07/27/15 - '' [ s ] terezi : remem8er . 
  '' ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=009859 ) or [ 04/13/16 - '' [ s ] act 7 '' ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=010027 ) . 
  i personally feel that this is fine and that the comic has spent too much time exploring her character already . 
  ## calliope and caliborn :, 
  [ 04/13/16 - '' [ s ] act 7 '' ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=010027 ) i guess . 
  ## pm and wv :, 
  [ 04/13/16 - '' [ s ] act 7 '' ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=010027 ) or immediately preceding it . 
  my current laptop ( lenovo thinkpad t430s with some custom improvements ) has been getting fairly beaten up . 
  i think i 'd like my next laptop to be one that i do n't need to get serviced just because it fell from the first story balcony onto pavement and smashed part of the case . \\* something made of aluminum , or titanium , or `` magnesium alloy '' . 
  something resistant to cold weather , warm weather , glare , and especially sand ( i do n't like sand ) . 
  something like what 's produced by amrel or getac . 
  however , most/all of these laptops are * terrible * for gaming . 
  they either straight-up do n't have a discrete graphics card , or have a small screen , or both . 
  their battery life also tends to be fairly terrible , but that 's less avoidable and also not really a gaming issue . 
  and the ones that do have a graphics card tend to weigh like 3 kilos . 
  is there some kind of rugged laptop that is good for gaming , yet is not a hulking monstrosity ? 
  my budget is basically unlimited . 
  ^ ( * this scenario is hypothetical . ), 
  i built the fucking pyramids . 
  i am not your garden variety arab . 
  no sir . 
  i am not ahmed . 
  i am omri the syrian israeli jew . 
  the double whammy in murica . 
  my english is shit . 
  i look like i come from the sands of tatooine ( or whatever it is called ) my accent makes people think im am going to behead them . 
  my ethnic foods smell so bad i get cops sent over . 
  and i get searched extra at the airport . 
  bit hey !, 
  i do n't mind . 
  i enjoy not worrying about suicide bombings and i like eating crappy fast foods . 
  and i like me some american women . 
  omri ferretrape is happy to be here in america . 
  now just do n't call ins on me . 
  i have my papers . 
  i am legal ... ish . 
  title says all . 
  i dislike the t430 keyboard and want to switch it out with an older one . 
  not sure if that 's advisable though . 
  like okular . 
  in most applications , if i open a pane , it will use arc for the buttons and things , as i set in ` lxappearance ` a while ago . 
  but okular looks like [ windows freakin ' 98 ] ( http://imgur.com/ib4azq0 ) . 
  and so do a few other applications , like mathematica and matlab . 
  and they all use slightly different ugly gtk themes , that i know are among the gtk themes installed on my computer . 
  okular happens to look the worst . 
  what 's wrong with them ? 
  the idea is to extend the syllable nucleus and put lots of tonal information in it , and follow it up with a ridiculous , unvoiced consonant cluster . 
  additionally , to put mostly odd phonemes as syllable nuclei . 
  it would be pronounceable if it were n't for the fact that it requires more air than your lungs can hold . 
  sample phonology and grammar :, 
  the language is mora-timed . 
  syllable is cv [ v. . v ] [ c. . c ] . 
  `` v [ v. . v ] '' stands for any permitted syllable nucleus repeated any number of times , with any tone on each mora of it . 
  '' [ c. . c ] '' meanwhile stands for any combination of permitted ending consonants . 
  `` words '' are only permitted to be one `` syllable '' long , but may carry enough information for an entire clause . 
  ## phonemes, 
  starting consonants ( one per syllable ) :, 
  labial | dental/alveolar | velar | uvular | glottal, 
  p b | t d | k g | q \u0262 | \u0294, 
  possible nuclei ( only one phoneme permitted per syllable , but repeated arbitrarily many times ) :, 
  front | near-front | center | near-back | back, 
  y | i | \u0268 | \u026f | u, 
  v | \u00f0 | z * | \u0292 * |, 
  r | \u026e | | \u027b | \u0280,
