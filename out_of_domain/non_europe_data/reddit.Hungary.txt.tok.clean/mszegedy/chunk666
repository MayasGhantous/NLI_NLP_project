  ## sample morphophonology and grammar, 
  ( at this point i 'm switching into full `` fake linguistics paper '' mode , read at your own risk to your sanity ), 
  each `` syllable '' stands for a univalent clause . 
  the consonants correspond to a univalent word , while the nuclei and tonemes correspond to the word it takes as an argument ( usually a noun ) . 
  examples of such pairs are verbs and their subjects , prepositions and their objects , adjectives and their nouns , and case markers and their nouns . 
  nouns fall into 5 noun classes :, 
  - y/i and \u0268 / u : animate things, 
  - i/y and \u026f / u : exceptional inanimate things and finished goods, 
  - v / \u00f0 and \u0292 / z : other inanimate things, 
  - \u026e / r and \u027b / \u0280 : abstract things i, 
  - m/n and \u0272 / \u0274 : abstract things ii, 
  the contrast marked by the slash is the singular/plural contrast . 
  the contrast marked by the `` and '' is the harmony group ; if the initial consonant of the syllable is labial , dental , or alveolar , the first pair of contrasting vowels is used , while if the initial consonant is not , the second pairt is used . 
  thus , the following are acceptable ways to begin a syllable :, 
  pyy ... 
  h\u0292\u0292 ... 
  q\u0274\u0274 ... 
  ... while the following are not :, 
  * p\u0292\u0292 ... 
  * qnn ... 
  sample nouns ( singular of front harmony group used ) :, 
  y\u02e6y\u02e6y\u02e5y\u02e5y\u02e8 `` woman '', 
  i\u02e5i\u02e7i\u02e5i\u02e7 `` sea '', 
  v\u02e7v\u02e7v\u02e7v\u02e9v\u02e9v\u02e8 `` ice '', 
  m\u02e8m\u02e7m\u02e8 `` love ( n. ) '', 
  there are also dummy nouns that serve syntactic purposes , akin to pronouns or adverbs . 
  \u026e\u02e8\u026e\u02e6 `` that '' ( in the sense of , `` i want ** that ** you be happy '' ; verb of subordinate clause is formed around this , with additional arguments specified in a new syllable ), 
  \u026e\u02e6\u026e\u02e8 `` that '' ( in the sense of , `` i want the ice cream ** that ** is mint flavored '' ), 
  y\u02e7 ( nil , used for not-nouns that serve syntactic purposes ; e.g. 
  \u0294\u0268\u02e7th , meaning `` and '' ), 
  y\u02e7y\u02e9 ( nil , used for not-nouns that serve adverbial purposes ), 
  v\u02e9 ( nil , used for verbs where the subject is indicated on the verb and there is no object ), 
  personal pronouns are `` not-nouns '' and generally have y\u02e7y\u02e9 as their nucleus . 
  they only appear as objects ; when a verb has a person as its subject , morphology is used to indicate this instead . 
  ### not-nouns, 
  verbs have the most complex morphology . 
  the consonant up front may decide just the aspect , but it may also decide the subject of the verb . 
  if it decides the subject of the verb as well , then the argument of the verb becomes its object , not its subject . 
  only three kinds of subjects can be distinguished with conjugation : ego , not-ego , and verb argument ; i.e. 
  1st person singular , non-1st person singular , and the noun taken by the verb . 
  the aspect , meanwhile , is subject to either a 2-way or 3-way distinction . 
  if the subject is ego , then the distinction is just complete/incomplete , but if it is n't , then the distinction is usually complete/incomplete/unstarted , depending on the verb class . 
  a complete conjugation table for one verb class is :, 
  subject | complete | incomplete | unstarted, 
  1s | p - | b - | --, 
  ~ 1s | t - | d - | \u03b8 -, 
  argument | k - | g - | x -, 
  the last row may be velar , uvular , or glottal depending on the verb class . 
  the glottal class only distinguishes complete/incomplete , with \u0294 - being complete and h - being incomplete . 
  the verb class usually gives additional information about the aspect of the verb , and one verb usually has multiple , similar versions that belong to different classes . 
  examples are discussed below . 
  the ending consonants constitute the verb root . 
  each verb has at least two roots , a definite root and an indefinite root . 
  the use of the definite root implies that the argument is definite , while the use of the indefinite root implies that the argument is indefinite . 
  certain verbs ( `` strong verbs '' ) also use different roots depending on whether the argument is the subject or the object , having a total of four roots . 
  ( there is only one verb with three roots , h. . tq/h . . qt/h . . \u03b8q , `` to do '' . 
  when the argument is the subject , h. . \u03b8q is used as the root regardless of whether the subject is indefinite or definite . ), 
  different roots of a verb are often related by lenition , reduplication , or metathesis . 
  one meaning can give rise to many interrelated verb roots . 
  see for example the family around the intransitive weak verb k. . p\u0283csht , `` to shine '' :, 
  - k. . p\u0283csht / k. . pp\u0283csht `` to shine '', 
  - q. . k\u0283csht / q. . kp\u0283csht / q. . x\u0283csht / q. . xp\u0283csht `` to flash '', 
  - h. . p\u0283csht / h. . pp\u0283csht `` to glow ( for a long time ) '', 
  - k. . f\u0283csht / k. . fp\u0283csht / k. . ftf\u0283csht / k. . fpfp\u0283csht `` to shine ( transitive ) '', 
  #### adjectives, 
  there are n't really adjectives at all . 
  there are verbs meaning to be in a particular state , such at h. . st\u0361stch , meaning `` to be green '' . 
  they are overwhelmingly often glottal class . 
  #### adverbs, 
  they are placed after the verb phrase they modify . 
  multiple adverbs in a row may be interpreted as either modifying each other or the verb phrase ; there is no way to disambiguate this . 
  adverbs come with a small family of nuclei that modify the adverb in trivial ways . 
  some of these are :, 
  - y\u02e7y\u02e9 : basic, 
  - y\u02e7y\u02e9y\u02e6 : diminutive, 
  - \u026e\u02e5\u026e\u02e7 : adverb derived from a verb/adjective, 
  - i\u02e7i\u02e9 : another diminutive, 
  there is no strict comparative/superlative form of an adverb . 
  reduplicating the nucleus produces a stronger form of the adverb . 
  generally , one reduplication is taken as the comparative form , and two is taken to be the superlative form , but there is nothing stopping additional reduplications . 
  pronouns that are objects are treated as adverbs . 
  pronouns as objects are somewhat more richly featured than pronouns as subjects ; there is a 1/2/3 s/pl distinction as in ie languages . 
  they have `` direct '' and `` indirect '' forms akin to the accusative vs. dative cases in ie . 
  here they are as a table :, 
  person | direct | indirect, 
  3 | \u0294\u0272\u02e6\u0272\u02e9t , \u0294\u0274\u02e6\u0274\u02e9t | h\u0272\u02e6\u0272\u02e9t , h\u0274\u02e6\u0274\u02e9t,
