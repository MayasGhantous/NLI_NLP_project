  ## sample morphophonology and grammar, 
  the phonotactics are n't weird enough that a morphophonology and grammar would be interesting to construct . 
  it works like pretty much any other language with a cvc structure . 
  have you tried tagalog ? 
  this is part of my on-going `` avant-garde phonologies '' series , in which i try to come up with phonologies that have a snowball 's chance in hell of arising but are n't completely impossible . 
  that is to say , phonologies where if someone told you it belonged to a real language , you 'd hesitate for a few nanoseconds before calling bullshit . 
  so far , there are 4 entries in this series .

  sample phonology and grammar :, 
  ## phonotactics and prosody, 
  syllables are [ v ] cv , with an additional possible [ v ] at the end of a word . 
  vowels are allowed to occur next to each other , such that a vcvvcv word is both possible and likely . 
  some assimilation does occur in these words , covered below under `` allophony '' . 
  in words that begin vcv , stress is on the second vowel . 
  in words that begin cv , stress is on the first vowel . 
  ## phonemes, 
  vowels :, 
  twenty-one vowel phonemes , counting the voicing and nasalization difference . 
  if only place of articulation is considered , then eleven . 
  front | near-front | center | near-back | back, 
  i\u0303 | | a\u0303 | | u\u0303, 
  i\u0325 i | y | \u0268\u0325 \u0268 | \u026f\u0325 \u026f | u\u0325 u, 
  e\u0325 e | \u00e6 | a\u0308\u0325 a\u0308 | o | \u0251\u0325 \u0251, 
  consonants :, 
  five consonant phonemes :, 
  front | center | back, 
  p | t | k, 
  m | n |, 
  while these are described as having a particular voicing , in practice the voicing varies depending on allophony ; see below . 
  in each [ v ] cv syllable , the voicing of the consonant assimilates to the following vowel . 
  similarly , in diphthongs , the voicing of the first vowel assimilates to that of the second . 
  this assimilation does not , however , extend to the preceding consonant , so one can say that a diphthong merely moves the voicing from the vowel to the consonant . 
  two of the same vowel is treated as a phonemically long vowel . 
  it is not perceived as taking up the same time as two vowels ( as it would in a mora-timed language ) , simply as a long version of that vowel sound . 
  before front consonants , isolated back and near-back vowels lenit to the following system :, 
  near-back | back, 
  | \u028a\u0303, 
  \u026f\u0325 \u026f | \u028a\u0325 \u028a, 
  \u0259 | \u0250\u0325 \u0250, 
  ## sample words, 
  / mu\u0325ty\u02d0tym\u025ay / -  [ \u02c8m\u0325u\u0325dy\u02d0dym\u025ay ], 
  / \u025anu\u0325\u00e6t\u0251\u0325pu\u0303 / -  [ \u025a\u02c8n\u0325u\u00e6t\u0250\u0325bu\u0303 ],

  # sample phonology :, 
  ## phonotactics and prosody, 
  syllables are cv [ c ] . 
  the coda of a syllable may not be the same consonant as the onset of the next syllable . 
  stress is on the last syllable , unless the vowel of the second to last syllable is part of its associated allophony group ( see below ) , in which case stress is on the second to last syllable . 
  ## phonemes, 
  ### vowels :, 
  five phonemic vowels :, 
  front | center | back, 
  i | | u, 
  e | \u0259 | o, 
  ### consonants :, 
  six phonemic consonants :, 
  p | t | | k, 
  m | n | \u0272 |, 
  each phoneme has four allophones , which fall into groups together . 
  each group is associated with a particular kind of phoneme : stops , nasals , front vowels , or back vowels . 
  the associated groups are respectively called s , n , f , and b. 
  the specific allophones of each phoneme are described further below . 
  ### the rules, 
  which phoneme is expressed as which allophone is nontrivial , and is subject to a number of rules . 
  the number of each kind of allophone depends on the number of the associated phonemes . 
  there must be as many s allophones as phonemic stops , as many n allophones as phonemic nasals , etc. 
  which groups can follow each other in the word depends on which kinds of phonemes follow each other in a word . 
  in general , if there is a phoneme associated with group x followed by a phoneme associated with group y , then in the allophony there may be an instance of a group x allophone next to an allophone from the group `` opposite '' group y ( s and n being opposites , f and b likewise ) . 
  so , for example , if there is a stop followed by a nasal in the word , then there may be an s allophone next to another s allophone . 
  or if there is a front vowel followed by a stop , then there may be an f allophone next to an n allophone . 
  note these three things :, 
  this only describes what is permitted , not what is actually in the word . 
  usually , not all permitted combinations will make it into the word . 
  there is no restriction on the order of the allophones . 
  in the second example above , the order of the allophones may be fn or nf . 
  each pair of adjacent phonemes only permits one pair of adjacent allophones . 
  if there are two instances of an n and an f allophone next to each other , there need to be two corresponding instances of a nasal followed by a back vowel or a front vowel followed by a stop . 
  the first phoneme of the word is preferably expressed as the allophony group associated with its type ; that is , if it is a phonemic stop , it should preferably be in group s , and so on . 
  but this is not always possible . 
  if the first phoneme can not be of its group , then the next preferred arrangement is where the second phoneme is of its group , and so on . 
  the final pronunciation of a word is any that conforms to the above rules . 
  most words have more than one possible and maximally preferred pronunciation ; these are used interchangeably . 
  it is easily possible to imagine combinations of phonemes that have no possible pronunciation , but there are no such words in the language . 
  ### allophony group s :, 
  associated with stops . 
  characterized by unvoiced geminated stops , trilled or flapped nasals , fronted back vowels , and advanced tongue root front vowels . 
  vowels :, 
  front | center | `` back '', 
  i | | y,
