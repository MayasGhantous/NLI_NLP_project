  ## sample morphophonology and grammar :, 
  fuck i dunno , it 's got ta be isolating right ? 
  firefox is dropping flash support next month . 
  chrome is dropping it next january . 
  this will make several key parts of homestuck illegible . 
  by then , we must put together a version of homestuck with these replaced with html5 or something . 
  yogg 'n' load is my favorite deck , and i can tell you the purpose of every card in every variant of it . 
  and in the past i have recommended against adding more minions to various ynl decks , for a variety of reasons . 
  but today i want to talk about cloaked huntress . 
  as a rule , good yogg 'n' load decks tend to be very , very light on minions . 
  ( which is part of why i like it so much . 
  it 's a very `` pure '' yogg deck . 
  you always get entertainingly long yoggs with it . ), 
  the minion backbone of a yogg 'n' load deck is yogg , thaurissan , and king 's elekk . 
  the rest is just your 27 favorite hunter spells with a bow or two thrown in . 
  over time , many minions have come up as possible good additions to yogg 'n' load . 
  some of them are :, 
  - bloodmage thalnos, 
  - harrison jones, 
  - savannah highmane, 
  - malygos, 
  but sub-6-cost minions are generally a bad idea , because they dilute elekk 's draw greatly . 
  elekk 's draw is ridiculously reliable and valuable in a minion-lite yogg 'n' load deck . 
  and expensive minions like malygos ( or ragnaros , i 've seen him too ) are just not worth the slot for other reasons ; malygos , for example , does n't really translate into a win condition , because you have very few spells actually capable of going face . 
  ( unless you run kill command , but why are you running kill command in a deck where you 'll only have a beast in hand 40 % of the time , and even then it will usually be a bad idea to play it ? ), 
  the arcane giant , which releases next week , is worth consideration , but drawing it would ultimately be much less useful than drawing either thaurissan or yogg . 
  but how many times can you say `` it 's a great card , but it would ruin the elekk draw '' ? 
  cloaked huntress can get great value with lock & load . 
  the lnl turns in yogg 'n' load as it is are reminiscent of secret paladin 's secret turn ; you play one card , and barf all your secrets into play . 
  i think at least a third of the spells i 've ever played during a lnl turn were secrets , and half of those were secrets generated by lnl . 
  imagine if they all cost 0 !, 
  you can play 2-5 secrets in one turn , and still get to play 5-8 mana 's worth of other spells !, 
  long have i held out with my 26-spell ynl deck , but i think it may be time to look for variants which include the minions we 've wanted to include , and ditch the elekk draw for it . 
  edit : added sentence about arcane giant , thanks for the reminder that it exists . 
  not one phonology , but * several * of the highest-quality , most interesting , * most completely original phonologies ever devised .

  ## an actual conlang to go with it, 
  english , except each word is replaced with / \u0259 / for as many moras as its index in the oxford english dictionary . 
  so , the first word in the oed would be / \u0259 / , the second / \u0259\u0259 / , the third / \u0259\u0259\u0259 / , etc. 
  better than english , since there are no homonyms , and there 's no polysemy .
