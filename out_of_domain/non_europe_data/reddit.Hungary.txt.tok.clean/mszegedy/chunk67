  that 's what my violin case weighs . 
  :d apparently , it can survive being run over with a car . 
  an intel thinkcentre !, 
  :d i recently acquired one of these . 
  it 's awesome . 
  ... huh . 
  ah , i thought it was a clientside problem . 
  silly me , restarting my routers all over the place . 
  fucking fundie does n't believe in neil degrasse tyson , see how we'yre being persucted ???????????? 
  dont listen to them , , traitors are holes !, 
  please do n't kill yourself . 
  i love you . 
  hahahaha , you do n't have the whole thing saved to your hard drive , like me !, 
  my pity for you is great !, 
  when is three years nsfw ? 
  i want to see those parts . 
  ( strictly unscientific reasons , of course . ), 
  edit : wait nvm i found one, 
  [ is it supposed to render like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oqmrt.jpg ), 
  who is the guy to the left of charles dutton ? 
  ( i mean , that ~ ~ grey ~ ~ ~ ~ gray ~ ~ ~ ~ greay ~ ~ ~ ~ graey ~ ~ ** monochrome ** thing . ), 
  my interpretation was `` hooooooooshhhflssztg '' . 
  but it 's way more convenient to just make a solar panel . 
  at first i thought you said `` what the refrance '' . 
  now i 'm sad . 
  also i have no clue either . 
  maybe avengers ? 
  ( as soneone who has n't seen it ), 
  wget ? 
  what about cavern lakes ? 
  just ... type ... `` wget - r - l 0 http://mspaintadventures.com '' . 
  into terminal . 
  yeah , it works . 
  this sounds more like you rationalizing your point than supporting it . 
  your `` evidence '' is almost entirely made up of assumptions . 
  the mailbox one was a good point , though ; i thought it blew up when jane got the mail , but if it existed back in jane : enter , then that 's pretty weird . 
  but anyway , fedorafreak is the gent of piss , and a player ; but jane 's dad , as far as we know , does n't have a dreamself , and did n't enter the game through means of installing sburb , connecting with a server player , crafting your own pre-punched item , et cetera . 
  also :, 
   fedorafreak : consumed final swallow of carefully rationed urine . 
  soon to seek water elsewhere in exotic new surroundings . 
   sounds like there is n't much water where he is . 
  [ there is clearly water essentially everywhere . 
  i did n't know moirallegiance was n't commutative . 
  what did i miss ? 
  do you deny that fedorafreak is a player ? 
  i do n't see -- oh ahahahaha . 
  though , to be honest , that could 've been anyone 's high-heeled foot . 
  build more !, 
  if you have advanced machines , you can craft them into low/medium/high voltage solar arrays . 
  and build mark ii reactors as well . 
  you 'll never have to use a geothermal generator again !, 
  maybe to you . 
  not that i support the person you are replying to . 
  thank you for pressing f2 for your post !!, 
  i would have ** literally ** died without it . 
  i just realized , but this appears not to have been a coincidence , given the amount of orange soda that dirk has experienced . 
  the software ... * how * ? 
  i added them afterwards . 
  i managed to forget about them !, 
  but they 're totally regular posters here , are n't they . 
  so , any guesses as to who created it ? 
  b1/2 kids anyone ? 
  holy fucking shit . 
  definitely him . 
  thanks !, 
  each universe is made by another one . 
  the trolls made the kids ' universe . 
  a 48-player ~ ~ squiddle ~ ~ session made the troll universe . 
  so where does this fit in ? 
  it seems to me :, 
  48 --  12 --  4 , or 8 since they team up --  2, 
  ( that 's 2184 jeb 's , and 8435 characters . ), 
  yeah , and it 's been compared to friendship , which * is * commutative . 
  ( '' [ that 's what moirails are for , right ? 
  maybe i 'm just on reddit too much and you 're on it less and the slowness is relative . 
  i hope that the fact that we do n't know what they look like yet will curb it somewhat . 
  oh , wow , now i understand the seven gates thing !, 
  i thought there were seven gates total , which totally confused me for years ( well okay how many years , homestuck 's only been going on for a few ) , but now i see it . 
  the pre-scratch troll one also counts , which makes it five . 
  we 've seen two of them already , b1 and b2 . 
  my first language is n't english either ; hungarian . 
  no one 's heard of homestuck in this country . 
  you ? 
  i think being on that list is what motivates people to post . 
  well , it 's clearly not capable of supporting life . 
  ~ ~ broken link !, 
  you ca n't just link to gmail like that !, 
  dammit , i 'm really curious now . ~ ~, 
  jeez , wow . 
  i am going to have trouble implementing this in my game . 
  well , technically it had some grass , but i mean that it 's the seed for creativity or whatever , where you 're supposed to pop the genesis frog . 
  well , okay , fair point . 
  :d whatever comes after breeding it . 
  ... there 's * one * player tower on prospit . 
  there is no chance that this is a twelve player session . 
  what 's a pastebin ? 
  ( yes i know , heresy ), 
  time shenanigans . 
  they just received contact from them in that time ; it does n't necessarily mean that the universe has to be created by then . 
  still , very good point .
