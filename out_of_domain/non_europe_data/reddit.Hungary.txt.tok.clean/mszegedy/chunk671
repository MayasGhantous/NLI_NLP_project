  english orthography-wise , but with this phonology . 
  how do i build a vessel that can survive reentry ? 
  i 'm currently working on a 15-ton vessel that holds 8 kerbals , and is designed for the sole purpose of bringing kerbals back from a space station . 
  it consists of two of the 3-kerbal command pods held together by a 2-kerbal lander can . 
  the chutes are four radial-mount chutes and four radial-mount drogue chutes , all on one end . 
  i went through these iterations :, 
  - both ends covered with 2.5 m heat shields . 
  lander can protected by structural panels . 
  - the above , but the chutes are additionally protected by structural panels , and are by all accounts nearly fully enclosed . 
  in both variations the chutes exploded on deorbiting . 
  how do you make a vessel with chutes that survive reentry ? 
  edit : i have n't tried enclosing the whole thing in a fairing , but the kerbals would n't be able to get in then . 
  i know this subreddit does n't like yogg very much , but i find it fun to map out the theoretical extent of the capabilities of yogg . 
  with brann , you can get up to 60 spells . 
  what could you do with 60 arbitrary spells ? 
  ( note : some of these have side effects . 
  things get a lot more difficult if you avoid side effects ), 
  - summon yourself any minion !, 
  - ( innervate  ) forbidden shaping  ( evolve ), 
  - in wild : unstable portal  ancestor 's call, 
  - summon your opponent any minion !, 
  ( so long as they have 9 or less cards in hand , and the format is wild ), 
  - forbidden shaping  mulch  ancestor 's call, 
  - put up to 19 arbitrary minions into your opponent 's deck at their full cost !, 
  ( so long as they have 9 or less cards in hand , and the format is wild ), 
  - unstable portal a dreadsteed  ancestor 's call it  [ mulch  ancestor 's call  recycle ] x 19, 
  - put up to 19 arbitrary minions into your deck at their full cost !, 
  ( so long as your opponent has 9 or less cards in hand , and the format is wild ), 
  - the above , but with recycle replaced with entomb, 
  - give your opponent control of yogg !, 
  ( so long as your opponent has 9 or less cards in hand , and the format is wild ), 
  - forbidden shaping  mulch , giving your opponent a sylvanas  ancestor 's call it  assassinate the sylvanas , who steals yogg, 
  - this can be done in standard if your opponent has a sylvanas in their deck , with mindgames  assassinate , or if it 's in play , with just assassinate . 
  unfortunately , i do n't see any way to put it from their hand into the battlefield , otherwise you could combo it with mulch and give them a sylvanas in nearly any situation . 
  as far as i 'm aware there 's no other way to give your opponent control of one of your minions without * being * them . 
  - draw you up to 240 cards !, 
  - sprint x 60, 
  - although whispers  doom sounds like a better combo here , it is actually less efficient ; even if yogg plays it onto a full board , it only draws 217 cards . 
  - there may be a way to draw even more cards , perhaps by summoning a bunch of northshire clerics and just playing whirlwind and circle of healing over and over again . 
  i just do n't know exactly how many cards that would draw . 
  a possible most efficient way to do it is :, 
  - doom !, 
   wisps of the old gods  evolve , roll a northshire cleric on * every treant *  [ whirlwind  circle of healing ] x 28, 
  - if each iteration draws you 49 cards , like i 'm guessing , then that 's 1372 cards drawn, 
  - deal anywhere between 0 and 638 damage to arbitrary targets !, 
  - anywhere between 0 and 590 can be done by arbitrarily combining all of the damage spells in the game, 
  - 591 : pyroblast x 59  moonfire, 
  - 592 : pyroblast x 59  holy smite/arcane shot, 
  - 593 : pyroblast x 45  innervate  forbidden shaping a bloodmage thalnos  pyroblast x 13, 
  - the rest of the numbers between 594 and 638 can be done in the same fashion , just switch the order around, 
  - numbers higher than 638 are certainly possible , but an exhaustive list of which ones would be tedious to create, 
  - deal up to 65280 damage to an arbitrary target !, 
  ( so long as you have 9 or less cards in hand , in wild ; credit / u/timetravelersa ), 
  - twisting nether  wisps of the old gods  evolve x 7 , roll a prophet velen on * every wisp *  pyroblast x 51, 
  - skip everyone 's turn until the end of the game !, 
  ( so long as you have 9 or less cards in hand , in wild ; credit / u/timetravelersa ), 
  - twisting nether  force of nature x 2  evolve x 5 , roll a prophet velen on * every wisp *  unstable portal a malygos  ancestor 's call it  arcane missiles x 50, 
  - this gets you 19200 missiles, 
  - kill any minion while still activating its deathrattle !, 
  - twisting nether, 
  - discard up to your entire deck !, 
  ( the maximum deck size is 60 ), 
  - sprint x 15  astral communion, 
  - put any non-warlock card into your hand !, 
  ( thanks , / u/kklear ! ), 
  - unstable portal a warlock minion  renounce darkness, 
  - does this work with the worthless imps generated by sense demons ? 
  it 's bound to have happened to someone by now, 
  - fill your deck with arbitrary non-warlock cards , discounted 1 !, 
  - maelstrom portal a warlock 1-drop  gang up x 20  renounce darkness, 
  - even if you start with 60 cards , it takes 16 spells to mill them all ( see above ) , and 22 spells to fill your deck with 60 new ones . 
  since this adds up to only 38 spells , the same can easily be done to your opponent , for only an extra 4 spells ( and since it involves your opponent taking control of yogg , as always , it can only be done when your opponent has 9 or less cards in hand , and is playing wild ) . 
  - it 's possible to completely replace both your deck of 30 cards and your opponent 's deck of 30 cards with one yogg :, 
  - sprint x 8  astral communion  maelstrom portal a warlock minion  gang up x 10  renounce darkness  forbidden shaping  mulch it , giving your opponent a sylvanas  ancestor 's call the sylvanas  assassinate the sylvanas , who steals your yogg  sprint x 8  astral communion  gang up x 10 ( the warlock minion is still alive , no need to summon another one )  renounce darkness, 
  - this is only 45 spells , so it 's possible to do even more cards . 
  but you ca n't do a full deck of 60 on both sides , sadly . 
  things i have n't figured out how to get yogg to do :, 
  - get your opponent to discard cards in their hand if they have 10 non-minion cards in hand, 
  - summon your opponent an arbitrary minion in standard, 
  - put arbitrary non-minion cards into anyone 's deck, 
  - can be done with an extension of / u/kklear 's method, 
  - put arbitrary non-minion cards into anyone 's hand ( cabalist 's tome gets you mage spells , burgle gets you spells and weapons from the opponent 's class , and that 's pretty much it ; possibly let 's negotiate guy can help here ? ), 
  - / u/kklear offers the brilliant out of unstable portal a warlock minion  renounce darkness !, 
  it ca n't get warlock cards , but it can get everything else !, 
  - activate battlecries, 
  hi , not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this in , but i could n't think of a better one . 
  i 'm writing a physics engine , and i 've been making sure to document the theoretical background of it very well in the code , partly by writing the relevant equations in the comments . 
  however , lately my notation has gotten a little ugly and difficult to work with , and as much as i like to make cute little hand-aligned comments with ascii art , typesetting these equations by hand to look nice has taken up a significant chunk of my time . 
  is there a program that 'll do this automatically for me ? 
  like , take in latex or something , and output ascii art ? 
  like turning, 
  \\ frac { dx } { dt } = k _ { 1 } x, 
  into, 
  -- = k_1 * x, 
  -- = k * x, 
  should preferably be able to typeset matrices . 
  [ removed ], 
  [ this really bothers me . 
  \\ begin { equation * }, 
  \\ dot { x } = - \\ frac { \\ mathcal { d } ha },
