  i 'd appreciate it if anyone could help me out , but totally understand if you do n't . 
  when ottawa changed its flag to [ this , ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/flag_of_ottawa%2c_ontario.svg ) people on this sub complained that it looked like a logo rather than a flag . 
  what makes it do that ? 
  is it the cutesy curves and the solo jazz-style color scheme ? 
  or what ? 
  i ask because the may contest flags were just posted to / r/programmerhumor , and i noticed a lot of them look like logos rather than flags . 
  this is kind of difficult to avoid , since two logical things to base a programming language flag on are the language 's logo and typographic characters , and both of those are things used in modern logos ( especially programming languages ' logos , they love making their language 's logo one letter or something ) . 
  i ca n't quite put my finger on what visual characteristics make them look like that , though . 
  i ca n't play kft at the moment due to bad internet , so this is purely theorycrafting , but i 'm excited to bring a new kind of evil to the wild ladder as soon as possible : millock . 
  i think wild warlock has the tools to make this work , at least a little . 
  let 's see what 's available to us :, 
  the mill package, 
  - coldlight oracle, 
  - violet illusionist, 
  this is not all you can do to mill your opponent as warlock , but these are the core cards that make milling possible . 
  especially important is the coldlight + illusionist combo ( maybe with brann ) once your opponent has hit fatigue . 
  it can turn into a very high-damage burst combo at that point . 
  meme mill package 1, 
  as a card that destroys your opponent 's cards , it 's a natural fit for a mill deck . 
  not sure if it 's actually good , though . 
  probably improves winrate against jade druid , secret paladin , and maybe even pirates ( nah ... ) . 
  would like to try this , at least . 
  meme mill package 2, 
  a three-card combo , but very rewarding in terms of milling your opponent . 
  must only be done with a follow-up plan , and constitutes a huge tempo loss . 
  ideally you play twisting nether the next turn . 
  n'zoth package, 
  - infested tauren ? 
  - n'zoth , the corruptor, 
  you 're handlock . 
  of course you taunt up . 
  and sylvanas is a good card , especially if you run shadowflame . 
  arfus and tauren , ehhh whatever . 
  arfus especially seems redundant in this deck , but if you 're running n'zoth , you might want to run good deathrattles . 
  board clears, 
  - defile, 
  - hellfire, 
  - shadowflame ? 
  - twisting nether, 
  with defile , we can now have a board clear practically every turn . 
  i 'm not sure if you actually want to run demonwrath ; it 's kinda crap compared to the other options . 
  shadowflame is n't particularly great either on account of this deck not having too many disposable minions in it , but it can be run alongside sylvanas . 
  removals ( and minor healing ), 
  - mortal coil, 
  - drain soul, 
  since you can run two siphon souls , i doubt you 'd also run blastcrystal potion . 
  drain soul is pretty great , so i think it 's worthwhile . 
  the handlock package ( micro edition ), 
  - mountain giant, 
  - faceless shambler, 
  - twilight drake, 
  you probably ca n't fit all of this in , but it 's pretty important for survivability , and pressuring your opponent at all . 
  miscellaneous good cards, 
  - sir finley ? 
  - bloodbloom, 
  - gluttonous ooze, 
  - king mukla ? 
  - the curator ? 
  - primordial drake ? 
  - the lich king, 
  sir finley seems logical , as your hero power opposes your game plan ( but enables your handlock cards , so maybe do n't run him ) . 
  bloodbloom can get you out of otherwise unwinnable board states early in the game by allowing you to cheat out twisting nether or siphon soul . 
  gluttonous ooze is an important tech , and heals you as well . 
  emperor thaurissan improves your comboing ability in many ways , and enables brann + illusionist + 2x coldlight in matchups where you need it . 
  mukla + curator is an interesting little package , but i 'm not sure if you can actually fit it . 
  primordial drake is a great control card , but maybe not in handlock . 
  the lich king provides a lot of value , even if certain dk cards are pretty unplayable for you ( but then death grip actively helps your mill plan ) , and is an 8/8 taunt , which is exactly the kind of thing you want to play in handlock . 
  thoughts ? 
  improvements ? 
  anybody have actual experience with the deck ? 
  one of the best things about hearthstone is its flavorful voice lines , but not all of us are native english speakers , and not all voice lines are very clear in what they say . 
  which voice lines can and ca n't you understand well ? 
  for me it 's :, 
  most intelligible :, 
  - patches : `` i 'm in charge now ! '', 
  - raza : `` surrender your will to the kabal . '', 
  - tinkmaster overspark : `` this time for sure ! '', 
  - mysterious challenger : `` who am i ? 
  none of your business ! '', 
  as well as `` stop asking questions ! '', 
  - every old god 's voice lines, 
  - ysera : `` i dream and the world trembles . '', 
  - kabal talonpriest : `` do you wish to live forever ? '', 
  and `` your soul ... '', 
  - most of the dk heros , although the intros are a little obscured by the music, 
  - saronite chain gang : `` how long can this go on ? '', 
  the fact that you get to hear it twice adds to the intelligibility . 
  there 's actually a lot of fairly intelligible voice lines out there , but for the legendaries at least , they 're partially drowned out by music . 
  least intelligible :, 
  - drakonid operative : for a long time i did n't know it was in english ; it sounded like `` sinkulation , komnuu ! '', 
  - aya blackpaw : her attack line is apparently `` you die now !, 
  '' , but i can still only hear `` you going now ! '', 
  - jinyu waterspeaker : apparently he says , `` may your feet never brine . '', 
  - alexstrasza : `` i bring life and blaaargh . '', 
  i 'm not the first to point this out . 
  - the msog mage 1 mana 2/1 that makes a secret cost 0 : the entry voice line ends in `` kabal '' , but what about the rest of it ? 
  please help round this section out with non-msog cards ; dunno why so many ended up in here . 
  edit : still could n't get aya 's attack line right . 
  fixed . 
  really minor thing , but i thought i 'd share it with y' all since i have no one else to share it with .
