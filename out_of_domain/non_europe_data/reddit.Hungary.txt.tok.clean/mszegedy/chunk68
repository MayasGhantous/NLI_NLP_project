  if this is the kids ' universe , does that ensure their success ? 
  i thought that * you * were thinking of a null session . 
  also , derse * always * wins the war . 
  ... what ? 
  no , i 'm saying that it gets less as it goes on . 
  i 'm not saying that the whole thing is a 48-player session . 
  the session that * spawned * this whole clusterfuck was a 48-player one . 
  probably a totally legit one with no hitches . 
  edit : wtf ? 
  you ca n't downvote yourself ? 
  that 's ... 
  i 'll use a politically incorrect and extremely immature expression : * gay * . 
  no , derse [ * always wins the war * ] ( http://h.dropcanvas.com/yzebt/screen%20shot%202012-05-26%20at%206.01.53%20pm.png ) . 
  then they trigger the reckoning . 
  also , why are the prospitians and dersites all wearing each others ' clothes ? 
  wtf ? 
  it 's a tree , though , not a cycle . 
  well , it could be a cycle : we 've certainly seen enough of those , but [ it just does n't fit with the philosophy of sburb  ( http://mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006601 ), 
  [ rose : biologically speaking , it 's to be expected that null sessions far outnumber the successful ones . 
  when it comes to reproductive systems , overwhelming redundancy is commonplace . 
  [ rose : a universe has a reproductive system that spreads many seeds , as it were , most of which never come to fruition . 
  so we should n't feel too bad about our results , really . 
  it was quite par for the course . 
  my point being :, 
  [ many seeds ] ( / tt ), 
  i think they were just created that way . 
  the point is to make moar universes . 
  you can never have enough universes . 
  wait , i 'll draw you a cosmology diagram . 
  [ okay heres the diragn .

  right . 
  but i mean , one that we know that exists . 
  [ this is what the eror ] ( http://h.dropcanvas.com/yzebt/thisiswhattheeror.png ), 
  this is even better if you have redpower , because then you have waterless redstone and can summon your pack from anywhere . 
  it 's incredible that you missed that it 's a joke and still got so many upvotes . 
  i tip my hat to you fine sir . 
  you 're not allowed to post title screens . 
  read what the red box tells you to read . 
  now it 's only chronophilia who has to show up . 
  should i add rangersix ? 
  i see him around here a lot .

  edit : no seriously , i fixed it . 
  ah , ok , did n't know . 
  okay . 
  ( do n't take what follows as gospel ; it 's obviously not a guide or anything , i just wanted to give you a list of things having to do with compatability ), 
  basically , decide on a motherboard first . 
  everything you buy has to be compatible with it , so you do n't want to end up choosing it last and being limited to a very specific one that fits all your items . 
  essentially this is what you want to look out for :, 
  - form factor : this is the size of the motherboard . 
  there 's really only two options here , despite the existence of other kinds ( which are more specialized and should not be considered for a comp on a $ 1000 budget ) : atx is bigger , and more stuff fits on it . 
  micro atx is smaller , and less stuff fits on it . 
  this limits what case you can buy . 
  most of them support both , but if you get a micro atx mobo then you can buy a smaller case . 
  - processor socket : this is the part where you put the processor . 
  for amd processors , there 's am3 , for older processors , and am3 + , for newer ones . 
  like with micro atx and atx , you can put am3 processors into am3 + sockets ( but not the other way around ) . 
  for intel processors there 's lga1155 and lga1156 ( i do n't know the difference , or whether they are interchangeable ; check [ http://pcpartpicker.com] ( http://pcpartpicker.com ) for which processors have which ) , as well as lga1366 ( higher-end core i7 processors ) and lga2011 ( really highest-end core i7 processors ) . 
  - ram : this basically should n't be a problem , but i 'll mention it anyway : make sure you have enough ram sockets as the amount of sticks of ram you have . 
  also , check how much ram the mobo supports . 
  - pci and pcie slots : this is where you put various cards to enhance your computer . 
  pcie is for graphics cards and sound cards , while pci is for everything else , like wireless adapters , ethernet adapters , and tv controllers or whatever . 
  make sure you make a distinction between pcie x16 and x1 : x16 is really long and is usually used by graphics cards , and x1 is really tiny and usually used by sound cards . 
  there 's also 4x4 but i know nothing about it . 
  - sata connectors and ide/pata connectors : this is what you plug your various drives ( hard drives , dvd drives , floppy disk drives ) into . 
  check whether your drives use sata or ide ( or floppy ! ), 
  connectors . 
  sata is the newest , and has had 3 revisions , all compatible with each other and each one twice as fast as the last : sata , sataii , and sataiii . 
  they 're all compatible with each other , but if you plug a slower one into a faster one then the speed will be limited to the slower . 
  make sure your mobo has enough slots to support all your drives . 
  two more things for compatibility :, 
  - your psu needs to have enough power cables for all your drives and things . 
  this really should n't be a problem . 
  on the subject of psus , get a modular one ; you only need to plug in the cables that you need . 
  - make sure your case has enough bays for your drives . 
  if you have a 2.5 '' drive , like an ssd , but your case only has 3.5 '' drives , do n't worry ; there are plenty of real cool drive brackets you can buy to make it fit . 
  i know !, 
  at least * someone * follows the rediquette . 
  exactly . 
  * player * towers . 
  on the moons . 
  there 's four towers for the four players that play it . 
  huh . 
  at first i thought it was to be divided by four , but then rejected it because 4/4 ca n't happen , and 12/4 ! = 8 anyway . 
  but your idea is interesting . 
  could you clarify ? 
  i do n't follow . 
  i 'm asshole is why . 
  actually , though , i 'm not the one who downvoted this one ; it seems that downvoting your comment only sets it to 0 upvotes , 0 downvotes . 
  someone thought that my above comment was n't worthwhile . 
  i dunno ; i 'm not a goddamn psychologist . 
  edit : [ also , proof after refreshing that downvoting does n't work . 
  ] ( http://h.dropcanvas.com/yzebt/screen%20shot%202012-05-26%20at%209.30.35%20pm.png ), 
  yeah , but you ca n't cram 12 players into just two player towers ( or if you disregard inductive logic , maybe derse does n't even have a tower so it 's just one tower ; or , derse could have eleven towers and there 's in fact room for twelve ; but i prefer induction ) . 
  there 's basically no way that it 's a twelve-player session . 
  two towers , two players . 
  that 's how it 's always been . 
  i 'm not simply jumping to a conclusion based on `` hints '' ; everything points to that uu was the only one on prospit and uu was the only one on derse . 
  it 's simply silly to think otherwise .
