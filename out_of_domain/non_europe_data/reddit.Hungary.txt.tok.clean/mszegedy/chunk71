  ( i , myself , like to catch up every month or so ), 
  if i 'd compare myself to aranea , i 'd feel like i 'm giving myself too much credit . 
  how does one keep up writing * and * performing * popular * music for 40 + years ? 
  i do n't really `` catch up '' , just see what sorts of things the guys are outraged about currently . 
  i unsubscribed a while ago . 
  ... geez , that was a surprisingly comprehensive description . 
  i 'm learning so much from you guys !,

  so it 's no * truuuuuuuuue * atheist !, 
  in fact , why would you even click this link . 
  are * you * out of high school yet ? 
  that was the buddhism at the time that he lived , yes . 
  but religion * changes * . 
  and one of the major sects was mahayana buddhism . 
  it deified the buddha . 
  [ read this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mahayana#liberation ) from its wikipedia page . 
  if you do n't like wikipedia , read its source . 
  they looked upon buddha as a god . 
  suffer endless homestuck posts and circlejerking !, 
  did ... did you downvote yourself ? 
  snow golems ? 
  ah , okay then !, 
  thanks for clearing that up for me . 
  never mind then . 
  you should probably edit your original post to include this information , so that you appear less ignorant . 
  please ? 
  i agree . 
  his post replying to you definitely had the tones of a douchebag . 
  no , i mean edit it with those links you provided so that people who thought what i did would go `` ohhhh '' and have their minds changed . 
  wait , that sentence sounded less awkwardly-worded in my head . 
  eh , whatever . 
  point is , people need a little clarification and i think it would help if your additional backup was more visible . 
  [ especially since induction is impossible anyway .
