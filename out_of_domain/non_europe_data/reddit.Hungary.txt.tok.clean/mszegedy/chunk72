  some guy made it completely out of pants a while ago . 
  do n't remember any keywords , though ( `` tennant suit pants '' does n't work ) . 
  cost him a hell lot of money , like # 10,000 or something . 
  sadly , op does n't know whether it was moving , as [ the picture is n't his .

  might 've included the overcoat as well or something . 
  excellent work . 
  i 'd be too lazy at photoshop to do this to a gif file .

  4 ^ number ^ of ^ characters + 4 ^ number ^ of ^ characters + 6351579 ( yes , you can auspistice yourself , and although it normally would matter that auspistice is n't commutative , it does n't matter at the left because all the people are the same person ; the additional 4 ^ n is for auspistices between two people , where it * does * matter whether it 's commutative or not , and there 's four possible combinations , namely `` 1 c3 < 2 + 2 '' , `` 2 c3 < 1 + 2 '' , `` 1 c3 < 2 + 1 '' , and `` 2 c3 < 1 + 1 '' , assuming the lower half is commutative ), 
  or , simplified :,

  100 miles . 
  it 's always fun to guess what math class it is in the doodle pics . 
  i 'd say ... precalc ? 
  or if you 're in college probably a math refresher of some sort . 
  i see a safe , secluded spot in the middle of the mountains . 
  dwarfiness level = 7 . 
  now , embarking in a spot * between * three of them and killing them with magma ? 
  dwarfiness level = 11 . 
  is n't there a thing in the world gen settings ? 
  wait , you can turn those off ? 
  how ? 
  / have n't actually played that version of df yet, 
  nonononono you 're right !, 
  a berserk dwarf will just kill people until he dies . 
  an enraged dwarf , what your friend was thinking of , is much more effective in battle , ignoring pain and whatnot . 
  these wear off . 
  tantrums are when dwarves may * temporarily * hurt fellow dwarves , and induce negative feelings in them . 
  then they calm down . 
  why is * inception * confusing ? 
  they just go to deeper levels of dreams within dreams ( three , to be precise ) , until someone dies and they skip to the bottom level . 
  twice , because another guy dies as well . 
  i mean really ? 
  wait , which map of his is this ? 
  i do n't remember ever seeing this , having played all of his maps except sunburn islands and the ssp maps ( the jungle one , black desert , nightmare realm , and legendary ) . 
  geez , that 's emerald ? 
  looks like glass . 
  wow . 
  vechs has been busy . 
  your purpose is to destroy the result of hours of creative effort . 
  take pride in it . 
  not to mention you live in sweden . 
  i know because i live in sweden . 
  the problem is , i was half asleep during that movie . 
  not being an electrician , what does this tool do ? 
  maybe res could account for misspellings ? 
  100 miles . 
  10 inches . 
  12 feet . 
  11 yards . 
  c'mon bots , make it happen . 
  it 's almost always possible to tell from context . 
  there 's been two threads about that here already . 
  search it . 
  they 're not ais ; they 're users being paid a number of cents to post positive things . 
  maybe i should secede from the internet . 
  or maybe they just do n't browse this subreddit ? 
  actually , could you torrent me this ? 
  the copy that wget creates is n't really browsable . 
  those are the maps that i * have * played . 
  i have n't played the sunburn islands or the ssp maps , and i forgot about kaizo caverns and infernal sky . 
  i 'm excited that he 's remaking black desert , 'cause i loved that map !, 
  that 's okay , it was syntactically rather awkward . 
  [ then this is the most i can do for you .

  i am going to major in biomedical engineering . 
  i already know roughly what to look forward to , but could you give me some propaganda anyway ? 
  what 's the official difference ? 
  ahh , i 'm not who you think i am !, 
  i was just wondering . 
  i wo n't be able to start seeding again until 4:00 pm est , but seeya !, 
  you 're a weird person . 
  also , i was the opposite way with xkcd . 
  i still despise it and its fandom . 
  mother fuckers . 
  but , that flash came out basically yesterday . 
  exactly how many times have you done this ? 
  as a student of both latin and japanese ( but especially latin ) that name you said right there made my brain explode . 
  i blame the person who created it . 
  if i were a creationist , i 'd argue that it 's more like believing that 1 + 1 = 2 , but that 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 ... ca n't possibly equal 2,000 . 
  faith in humantity = restored, 
  what 're those sails made out of ? 
  wait , are you ravenzomg ? 
  ` k , as should be obvious to you by now , i 've started seeding !, 
  hooray !, 
  do n't worry , it will all be over in one more gigabyte . 
  no problem !, 
  this explodes when i click on it in res . 
  that 's also where the downvotes are . 
  oops . 
  i do n't know why you would care for * any * amount of karma . 
  they 're just numbers after all . 
  not like there 's any reward for 'em . 
  sorry , forgot to answer your question : no , i do n't think you care . 
  i think most people on here are smart enough not to care . 
  wait , are you asking me to construct a language ? 
  because that 's , like , one of the two things that i 'm good at . 
  where will * you * be ?
