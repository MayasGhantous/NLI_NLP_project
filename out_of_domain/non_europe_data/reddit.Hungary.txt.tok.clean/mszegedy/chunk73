  ( also , [ relevant / r/theoryofreddit link ] ( http://redd.it/l8id4 ) . ), 
  ~ ~ but then the karma wo n't carry over ! ~ ~, 
  i know , it was just a joke . 
  :d i think the voting system is good for reddit , and karma-whoring is just a necessary side-effect . 
  any time you implement something like this , there 's always going to be people who will want to exploit it to indiscernible ends . 
  i 'm fine with that as long as they do n't get in my way . 
  whee , thanks !, 
  it 's a bit gigantic , and it 's not ascii , but it 'll do for now !, 
  thanks for taking a stab at it !, 
  are you intentionally karma-whoring ? 
  because this is , like , the laziest comment i 've ever read , unless it 's sarcasm . 
  and a traditional karma-whoring tactic is to say the first dumb thing that comes into your head , and , well ... 
  edit : [ douchebaggery ] no , wait , downvote me more . 
  maybe if you do it enough , you 'll cleanse reddit of the evil idiocy that is me !, 
  [ / douchebaggery ] also , res is fucking lying when it says that this comment has no children . 
  not anymore !, 
  is n't co-opting english terminology fun ? 
  and yet , i play tekkit , 'cause advanced machines 'n' shit . 
  eh , good enough !, 
  i was thinking of something thatt fits in a terminal window , but i 'll take it !, 
  edit : actually , it 's great ; thanks !, 
  i mighta made it even smaller , but who cares . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  i 'd use less words , but language sucks . 
  just wanted to find out whether the guy was doing it for the karma . 
  i like it a lot !, 
  maybe his two hands are on a bit of an awkward angle from each other , but it 's not like it 's a big deal . 
  although , did n't he already have the facepaint on before he became sober ( not that it matters ) ? 
  no , it is n't . 
  some people who use the site have actually risen above the need to acquire pointless numbers . 
  they 're mostly located in the smaller subreddits . 
  this is a medium-sized subreddit , so i figured there 's like a fifty-fifty chance that this guy is a karma-whore . 
  if you think that reddit only operates because of karma , you 're unaware of its true purpose , which is to aggregate good content . 
  karma is just an incentive among many . 
  where ? 
  about what ? 
  i was n't trying to be patronizing at all . 
  the first half of the comment was for the benefit of the person to whom i was replying , asking him whether he was karma-whoring with a popular tactic . 
  the second part was for the benefit of the onlookers , who might not have been familiar with that tactic . 
  this is why it reads as though it would be stupid to have in real-life conversation : a real conversation does n't have an audience . 
  no problem !, 
  unfortunately , we are condemned to this as denizens of the internet . 
  my sarcasm is usually lost as well ... 
  ... wow . 
  and you did that without specialized forensics equipment ? 
  how have n't you mentioned mayonnaise yet ? 
  it 's the best of all of the things tom 's hardware reviewed that are n't actually thermal paste ( the worst was chocolate ) , and actually kept temps at around 40 \u00b0 c. 
  the mobo looks fixable . 
  i feel the same way , but i 've heard it so much used this way that i think it 's officially part of the language now . 
  although i know that what you are saying is ironic , i must mention that it is certainly possible to obtain pictures of stars from billions of years in the past , given the extremely sluggish speed of light nowadays . 
  ( i say nowadays , because previously , you could cross a larger fraction of the universe in less time , traveling at the speed of light . ), 
  end ve ken zee yu , yu dzirty kepitlist pig . 
  i thought it was a firework ? 
   according to one responder , ** circlejerk ** . 
  how did he make the ` b ' ? 
  would n't it be basically impossible to bite the kernels off the corn ? 
  also , terrible kerning . 
  i ** dare ** any onlookers to reference the xkcd . 
  if i may make a comparison , so far i am completely okay with the fact that i will never reach true happiness . 
  actually , i 'm completely okay with essentially everything that negatively affects me . 
  except myself . 
  i fucking hate that asshole . 
  especially the past us ( the plural of `` me '' is `` us '' ! ) . 
  they 're the biggest douchebags of me all . 
  but i 'm happy !, 
  really !, 
  it 's just that there 's still things to amend , and life is too short for me to fix all of the world 's problems in eighty-odd years . 
  it 's no big deal . 
  and i 'm not going to go out of my way to try to change it . 
  i 'm just a person . 
  so , accepting that there 's still things wrong with the world is n't sad . 
  you can only become as sad as you let yourself be . 
  it still bothers me , of course . 
  i 'm just not sad about it . 
  and neither does anyone else have to be who thinks this way . 
  hmm . 
  how many people ? 
  make it yourself ; it 's pretty easy if you have the ingredients , already know how to make chai tea ( if you do n't , it 's simple to learn this as well ) , and do n't fuck up in obvious ways like letting the `` bubbles '' stick together in the pot . 
  first time i learned to make it was pretty interesting for me , because i had to buy a bunch of exotic things like `` tapioca '' and straws with the very large diameter ( like , over 4 mm ; i got a hundred pack when i visited budapest ) . 
  but now i know where to buy tapioca ( what even is that stuff anyway ? 
  ) , and a hundred pack of straws will never run out ( and if it does , i can either make another trip to budapest , which i do often anyway , or just go on without it ) . 
  so really there 's not that much to it !, 
  they 've made me think twice on occasion . 
  so i 'd say , by very unstable induction , yes . 
  [ lol snork ;d ] ( / stg ), 
  i 'm personally glad that meenah decided to cut to the chase , because otherwise the exposition would have been drawn out over several updates , and would have been interrupted tediously over and over again , so that nothing actually got done . 
  this way , we get to hear shit . 
  6900 looks as though it will provide some exposition about the big man himself . 
  i thought it was a pretty unlikely conclusion , but it just seemed to fit so perfectly with the karma whoring paradigm that i had to ask !, 
  a notable karma whore recently did a guide to karma whoring on / r/theoryofreddit , and this was a point that he made : early , simple , not well-thought-out = =  karma !, 
  i tried it out myself ; it became the too comment for the thread , but the thread itself never really took off and it only netted me 11 points ( not that i actually care about points ; it was just a fun exercise ) . 
  sorry if i sounded rude ; only the first sentence was really meant for you . 
  i hate the internet , because you type out what you want to say , realize that there 's no nuance to it , and type out an explanation to the nuance , and then you look condescending and people make comments like `` you 'd sound so annoying irl '' . 
  maybe i should leave it . 
  edit : ( also , i downvoted this comment , not for any real reason , but it fits the pattern of the rest of my comments , anyway , so why the hell not ; i 'm already a public enemy here , so it 's not like i expect people to think differently about this comment than any of the other ones . ), 
  nonono , it 's in the edit , i downvoted myself . 
  so that the irony is that when the hivemind comes to downvote me for disagreeing with them , i 'm actually agreeing with them and they do n't know it !, 
  it 's pointless , but karma does n't matter to me . 
  oh my god there 's so many good ones i could pick out from here .
