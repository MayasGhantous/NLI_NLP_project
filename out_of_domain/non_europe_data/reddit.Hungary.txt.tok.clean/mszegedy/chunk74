  [ woops ] ( http://h.dropcanvas.com/yzebt/screen%20shot%202012-05-30%20at%204.16.21%20pm.png ) and [ woops ] ( http://h.dropcanvas.com/yzebt/screen%20shot%202012-05-30%20at%204.16.54%20pm.png ), 
  ... wow . 
  having been unaffected by watching avatar : having nothing to do with the movie ( but we have our own movie ) ( i do n't watch tv , and it does n't air here anyway ) , i like it , a lot !, 
  interesting to see a voice actor voice act . 
  so meta, 
  the first one made the number of subscribers to be the classic `` number of the devil '' , while the second one ruined a perfectly good round number . 
  ( as in i accidentally did a bad thing ), 
  i accidentally upset a pair of numbers , which is an accidental bad thing , which merits a `` woops '' . 
  okay , let me in on your secret : was it the patch tool or was it content-aware fill ? 
  learn economics ; you 're thinking of nominal value , which is actually where the supply and demand curves of the buyers meet ( that is , the price at which the buyers are willing to buy the same amount that the sellers are willing to sell ) . 
  real value is ... more complicated . 
  you have to compare it to a cpi ( consumer price index ) , which is the value of a bunch of goods in a metaphorical basket . 
  you can use it to measure real value because the more things you put in it , the less the value is likely to deviate over time . 
  it 's usually used for calculating gdp , but you can use it as a comparison for the real value of pretty much anything . 
  a popular mini-cpi is the big mac index , which measures the value of things in big macs ; that is , how much a big mac costs in that particular country , which is astoundingly constant . 
  how many big macs would * you * give for a cromenco ? 
  i. . . what ? 
  okay , is system 32 the only one that makes your computer slower ? 
  i ' ve deleter it , but forgot to copy it ; could you put your system 1 up for dowload pels, 
  reply to the wrong thing ? 
  actually , it only returns 72 pages of results , despite what it says at the top . 
  precisely , 712 results . 
  if you search with omitted results included , it stops at page 100 . 
  so , more around a thousand results or so . 
  ( the however many million that comes up at the top is a complete lie ; after you get a ways in to the results , it gives you a much more precise number . 
  i was able to get to the end of yours without that even happening . ), 
  though , why would a believer in censorship conclusively be a sociopath ? 
  sociopathy is normally characterized by the lack of ability to tell the difference between right and wrong . 
  sociopaths usually still seem like normal people . 
  this guy looks like the opposite - knows the difference between right and wrong , is a total creep about it . 
   you 're annoying . 
   yours ,, 
   lemon pjb, 
  ftfyx2 ? 
   nothing on reddit is or ever will be me . 
  my response is , `` what about * sandals * ? '', 
  i 've spent months crafting it . 
  help me out here . 
  woot !, 
  i can see it , clear as day . 
  this is great !, 
  i 'd like to keep it at that number for a bit , so if you do n't mind if it tips over i 'm unsubscribing . 
  hammer of zillyhoo ? 
  vrillyhoo pop-a-matic ? 
  is knockback a thing in whatever game this is ? 
  i can believe that * that * could n't be held , but they must have a value for instakill , right ? 
  it was also the last happy major flash . 
  [ s ] john : rise up . 
  comes close , but the ending kills it . 
  the last happy flash , period , was the one that introduced the land of light and rain . 
  here :, 
  r = w \u2022 k \u2022 p, 
  r is the number of references, 
  w is the number of works, 
  k is the average number of keywords unique to each work, 
  p is the percentage of those keywords that can be represented by the name generation engine, 
  nonono , if you read the website , apparently its contents were * dictated * to him by `` the beloved one '' , that is , jesus . 
  [ ( my source ) ] ( http://h.dropcanvas.com/yzebt/screen%20shot%202012-05-30%20at%2010.38.18%20pm.png ), 
  well ... duh . 
  [ ( by the way , i made him into a link ) ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/ud71z/get_a_load_of_this_guy_he_posts_sometimes_in/ ), 
  correction : he thinks he 's the second coming of jesus christ . 
  do n't worry , he was never a link there . 
  y' all lucky cs5 users . 
  i still have cs4 . 
  my equation is actually useless ; it 's modeled on the similarly useless drake equation . 
  wtf , since when ? 
  obligatory rose quote ? 
  ... dammit , i 'm on an iphone .
