  could someone find it and post it for me ? 
  i think it goes somethin like :, 
  [ tt : i think i have figured out the true objective of this game : to get as many qualifiers to precede our names as possible . 
  ... huh . 
  ... shonor bangla is a font for bangla , is n't it ? 
  you think this is bad ? 
  try doc scratch . 
  ... huh . 
  you 're right . 
  no , she does n't have vriska 's quirk . 
  she only replaces her b 's with [ 8 ] ( / ag ) 's . 
  vriska also replaces diphthong [ e\u026a ] and the sometimes-ensuing [ t ] with [ 8 ] ( / ag ) . 
  aranea has n't done that until now . 
  no , listen , we got something * important * from this update : confirmation that the last names of the trolls are constant throughout the scratch !, 
  whatever , we already know most of it , except how she gets into the scratch session . 
  i call dibs on the [ thoerie ] ( / dunkass ) that she was the one who typed the commands into the terminal that were inexplicably there before wv got to it ... it was either her or their manufacturer , which i think would be mom . 
  but then how did she get into the [ * hunan * ] ( / dunkass ) session ? 
  a diphthong is two vowels that are pronounced together as one sound . 
  english [ looooooooves ] ( / ag ) diphthongs : [ o\u028a ] in `` hoe '' ( it 's triphthong [ \u0259o\u028a ] if you 're british !, 
  ) , [ a\u026a ] in `` tie '' , [ e\u026a ] in `` may '' , and , this one usually is usually just annotated as [ u ] , but screw it [ \u028fu ] in `` too '' . 
  [ e ] is pronounced ... uh , do you speak any other languages ? 
  wait , i 'll start backwards : [ \u026a ] is pronounced like a short `` ih '' , without the h or anything . 
  it 's the symbol that universally represents that sound . 
  just subtract [ \u026a ] from [ e\u026a ] and you get [ e ] , a vowel that appears in almost all languages ( including english , if you count it separately from the diphthong ) . 
  i really think ipa should be taught in schools . 
  and the rest of linguistics , really . 
  [ some exposition by me on linguistics taht might gain you some insight into its nature . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/sfh0j/i_composed_a_grammar_and_vocabulary_system_for/c4dnf4y ), 
  well , if she thought it was cool in * one * universe ... 
  ( also you left off killing the entire human race ), 
  i like this a lot . 
  and how could we not know what rogues do ? 
  we 've had a bunch of exposition by uu on the matter . 
  [ tg : like what does it mean to be a rogue of void ] ( / stg ), 
  [ tg : thats what i am rite ] ( / stg ), 
  i can tell you plenty about that . 
  [ uu : a rogue is a passive class . 
  you see , there are passive ( + ) and active ( - ) classes . 
  some more strongly passive or active than others . 
  [ uu : the + / - distinction can mean many things , but could be quite roughly summed up in this way : active classes exploit their aspect to benefit themselves , while passive classes allow their aspect to benefit others . 
  [ uu : but of course there 's plenty more to it , and that rule is in no way absolute . 
  only a starting point for understanding the dichotomy . 
  [ tg : you mean kinda like ] ( / stg ), 
  [ tg : offensive vs defesive magic in an rpg ] ( / stg ), 
  [ uu : that 's another fine way of looking at it . 
  [ uu : classes always come in + / - pairs , with significant disparity between them . 
  [ uu : while a rogue is passive , a thief would be its far more active counterpart . 
  [ uu : the rogue and thief classes tend to be assigned to females . 
  not exclusively , but commonly !, 
  [ uu : other classes lean more toward male assignment , while others are exclusively male , and just as many are exclusively female . 
  [ uu : that 's a bit of a tangent though . 
  to answer your question about being a rogue , i should tell you both classes in + / - pairs tend to have very similar descriptions . 
  [ uu : in this case , a rogue or a thief is `` one who steals . '', 
  quite simple , really !, 
  [ uu : but whether the class is + or - makes all the difference . 
  it is a great indicator as to how a hero will make use of the aspect . 
  [ tg : so basically ] ( / stg ), 
  [ tg : a thief is like the asshole class ] ( / stg ), 
  [ tg : the player who says step off shits mine suckas ] ( / stg ), 
  [ tg : whereas ] ( / stg ), 
  [ tg : is bascially robin hood ] ( / stg ), 
  [ uu : if that reference to your culture provides a suitable comparison , then absolutely . 
  [ tg : so im essantially the robin hood of void ] ( / stg ), 
  [ tg : im still not sure ] ( / stg ), 
  [ tg : wtf that actually means ] ( / stg ), 
  yeah ... 
  are you aware that your language 's vowel phonology is made up almost * entirely * of diphthongs ? 
  ( like seriously it 's [ fucking incredible ] ( / dunkass ) . 
  i think the two vowels in your language that are n't diphthongs are [ \u00e6 ] and [ \u028c ] . 
  oh and lets not forget [ \u0251\u02d0 ] . 
  and if you 're british which you are n't then also [ \u0250\u02d0 ] . ), 
  edit : ( noo , [ \u00e6\u02d0 ] does n't count as a separate vowel , cheater . ), 
  edit2 : ( oh and for you brits i forgot [ \u0254 ] ), 
  maybe he 's actually serious ? 
  ( i wo n't call him `` ironic '' . 
  he does n't merit it . ), 
  okay . 
  we definitely do need to revise the education system from the ground up , but i would n't be quite as pessimistic as you are being here . 
  then bds_uhs should become a comedian ? 
  i ca n't access his profile at the moment in a reasonable way . 
  what are some of his most notable deeds ? 
  hmm , then . 
  i have no idea about the downvotes . 
  edit : no , guys , you do n't understand . 
  he was at like -8 or something ridiculous . 
  i forget , can ponds be magma ? 
  ( not that it matters because pastures are more useful for that sort of thing anyway , and to be honest most of the value of this fix is comedic ), 
  what 's a dwarrow again ? 
  you expressed an interest in my conlang i made for the dwarves !, 
  i was a bit confused as to why i remember your name as `` chastricox '' , and then i realized that that was because it was declined !, 
  heh , those were fun times ... 
  also , front page ? 
  never . 
  :p except of course the infamous 4d dwarf fortress . 
  right , but how do i know that these are easily identifiable minerals that i 'm finding ? 
  i 'd prefer to be as inobscure as possible . 
  i love the phrasing of how you referred to the theory . 
  no , i was n't being sarcastic !, 
  i actually like your comment a lot . 
  it 's kind of hilarious actually .
