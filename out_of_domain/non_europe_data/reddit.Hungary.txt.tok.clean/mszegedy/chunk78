  it took me less than a day . 
  ( i was supposed to be studying for exams . ), 
  ... hmm ? 
  was that sentence supposed to be phrased that way ? 
  because it * sounds * stupid , and has been co-opted by teenagers into an excuse to do stupid things . 
  also fu , latin is awesome !, 
  chef boyardee is a pirate ? 
  becomes christian, 
  wastes an hour or two each sunday for the rest of his life, 
  about sums it up . 
  as one who measures himself only in regard to intellgence and morality , i kind of really hate the general attitude that males are disadvantaged in those two areas . 
  it makes me really hate myself . 
  adolf hitler for god !, 
  okay , start by learning about fifty symbols . 
  then , learn all of the materials associated with them . 
  then , all the alchemical processes associated with them . 
  meanwhile , also learn the theory of equivalent exchange and the alchemical cycle . 
  i dunno , i 'm kinda ambivalent on this one . 
  i do n't mind learning it , but i wo n't do it on my own . 
  of what ? 
  hell , she killed john , too . 
  but it took about as long to win back his trust as it did to win it in the first place , which was like a few lines . 
  or rule34.com it . 
  if it 's a . com extension . 
  i would n't know . 
  just like no one 's ever taking my sgrubarrow . 
  read the wiki sometime ? 
  top 3 most fucked up :, 
  dave, 
  jack noir ( all of them at once ), 
  yeah , but in that case you 're still either male or female ; it goes :, 
  have y chromosome ? 
  - yes . 
  = =  male . 
  = =  female . 
  goddamn that = =  arrow is so beautiful . 
  [ * beatuiful ] ( / stg ), 
  i 'm going to do the survey again , and this time actually put my ( admittedly embarrassing ) age rather than answering `` prefer not to say '' . 
  i missed pretty much all of them except the most recent one with dirk . 
  they are genetically abnormal . 
  xy females are conceivable ; all that has to happen is that the y chromosome gets `` turned off '' somehow . 
  but xx males ? 
  never heard ` fem . 
  point is , expressing the y chromosome is what makes one male . 
  aww no , but are n't those sad ? 
  and generating history is going to take an eternity . 
  i 'm using a relatively recent version of df , and i still have to dump all the damn stone ... how did you run out ? 
  ... dammit . 
  so proficiency in mining is just time now ? 
  can i send my novice miners to pick up that adamantine ? 
  on the scale of roughly half a year . 
  ( i 'm actually a christian playing along . 
  i go to church every sunday as well !, 
  it 's alone , though . ), 
  he knows that terezi killed dave . 
  ... i never knew that . 
  first time i found adamantine was a glacier embark . 
  only two months had passed ; it was right there in the cavern . 
  i did n't mine it because my miners were all ( both of them ; not a single migrant wave had come yet ) pretty inexperienced . 
  then i bumped into some company ( ??? ), 
  and died . 
   find other friends, 
  one does not simply rearrange relationships on a whim , unless he never forms meaningful ones in the first place . 
  ( however , i do n't use facebook anyway . ), 
  why would i try to figure out why anyone 's pissing me off ? 
  i 'm never pissed off . 
  the fact that `` yolo '' is a stupid phrase is an immutable fact that i 'm stating for the record . 
  it does not mean that getting pissed off is what 's happening here . 
  sorry , i 'm too stupid to connect the dots , being a mac user . 
  are you saying we 're dumb and like to spend money pointlessly ? 
  wait , is n't this just how it was in cascade ? 
  with which there is nothing wrong , of course , but it 's not ... new . 
  of course . 
  they 're unusual . 
  i know i 've seen the bottom left one somewhere . 
  anyone tell me what it is ? 
  eheh , how ` bout we do n't turn this into a gunnerkrigg thing . 
  ... huh . 
  a backwards karma train . 
  someone make the next post !, 
  i 'll bet it 'll make nearly 50 karma !, 
  what 's the rate of growth of the number of first-order elements with each iteration ? 
  i 'm too lazy to count .

  have you seen that soldering job ? 
  greetings from hungary . 
  we have eighteen cases , show definiteness on verbs ( multiplying the number of verb endings by two ) , have three moods , and tons over tons of agglutinative affixes besides , all of which ( cases , verb endings , affixes , you name it ) inflect with vowel harmony . 
  some nouns have strong declension , and exhibit a different stem for endings than in the nominative ( like your 3rd declension ) , t\u00f3 , tavak , lake , lakes being an example . 
  our longest word is formed of a ton of affixes : `` megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9gesked\u00e9seitek\u00e9rt '' ( wow it looks way longer typed out than it is in my head , i promise that it 's not that long ) , and means `` on account of [ think the latin preposition `` pr\u014d '' ] your [ plural your ] ongoing actions regarding inability to be made free of being sainted '' . 
  that 's not even something to brag about . 
  the language fula , or fulfude , spoken primarily in west africa , has 25 noun classes ( that 's `` declensions '' to you guys , consolidated with genders ; actually , most languages do n't separate noun classes and genders in the way that latin does ) , and verbs express compulsory evidentiality , meaning you always have to include a suffix on the verb indicating how you know that that action took place .
