  this is on top of moods . 
  latin amounts to nothing . 
  i hated it when people complained in russian class about having seven cases and three genders , hated it in german class when people complained about inconsistent morphology , hated it in latin class when people complained about morphology in general , hated it in ancient greek class when people did the same . 
  stop complaining . 
  synthetic languages are by far the most widespread ( by number of languages , not number of speakers ; in the latter case english and chinese trounce all others , and are both analytical languages ) , and are a wonderfully efficient way of communicating things . 
  if you do n't like them , then that 's your problem . 
  wow , why do my posts on language alway have to be so goddamn * [ long ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/sfh0j/i_composed_a_grammar_and_vocabulary_system_for/c4dnf4y ) * ? 
  yes . 
  huh . 
  so , f ( n ^ 92 ) ? 
  i did n't notice ; i assumed it was some bipedal character . 
  you can sit out a few hours to a day . 
  peoples ' jobs involve that shit all the time , especially those involving rendering . 
  but we 're talking the scale of , like , toady comes out with a new major update before you can finish generating a world for the previous version . 
  i mean , god daaaaaaaaaamn . 
  \\* gets overrun with demons *, 
  it 's 47 exposures of 30 seconds each superimposed over one another - the question is why are there lines , not blinking things . 
  so then metaphorically what does uu ragequitting ( for you go players , performing a nuclear tesuji ) mean ? 
  why do they need to start a new pester every time one talks to the other ? 
  nepeta is way too short . 
  plus that thing about gamzee . 
  besides that , i like it !, 
  imagine playing a ctm map with * this * bitch . 
  til that logs smelt the same as planks . 
  i 'm stupid , how did i not notice this after using them for smelting ? 
  i thought they smelted six . 
  but all superflat worlds are basically the same . 
  ohhh . 
  well , should n't be too hard to find ... 
  this is on the web . 
  it 's just with safari reader enabled . 
  is n't the eye-friendly font hilariously out of place ? 
  welp , now i know where to always find this image . 
  huh . 
  the island itself is n't an obstacle ; it makes no difference for ships , and no one would settle there to need roads in the first place . 
  if you mean that players would settle there to * be * obstacles , then the island is also unnecessary -- roads ( in this case , ships ) are a much cheaper way to be an obstacle , and , as has already previously been discussed , it does n't matter to the player whether the island is there in those terms . 
  yeah . 
  no , i just thought that they were n't going fast enough for 30 second exposures over each other to appear as lines , in the manner that long exposures normally do . 
  ( by the way , you can edit posts by clicking `` edit '' ; no need to make a new one ), 
  i explain it a ways down in [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/sfh0j/i_composed_a_grammar_and_vocabulary_system_for/c4dnf4y ) epic dialogue . 
  i knew that figure , but i figured it would n't be so impressive that far from the surface of the earth . 
  english is analytical . 
  it hardly inflects at all . 
  we have three verb stems , but the latter two are always the same and formed from the first with the same ending except for strong verbs , and the only ending we ever use for inflection is the letter < s  , accompanied by an apostrophe in the possessive case of nouns . 
  it only ever appears in the present tense on verbs , and only in the third person singular at that . 
  our pronouns inflect in three cases , the subjective , objective , and possessive , and their inflection is irregular , but there 's not that many of them . 
  there is no memorizing which adpositions attract which case ; in fact , the subjective and possessive cases each only have one specific use . 
  the most tedious concept to memorize in the language is phrasal/prepositional verbs , and there is a limited number of those , none of them especially common . 
  so far , writing this message , i have n't used a single one . 
  respect it , love it . 
  do n't berate it . 
  no double l 's ? 
  are you forgetting ille , illa , illud ? 
  also , greek loanwords have y 's . 
  but yeah it looks like a load of bunk . 
  yeah , but is n't this theory mutually exclusive with that theory ? 
  sorry , i think you were trolled . 
  at the very least , `` ra '' is n't a word ( and i think we can all agree that that 's what that particular word reads ) , and the plenitude of w 's is also disclosing in that latin never uses them . 
  quick , let 's get a roman catholic up here ; does it appear in church latin ? 
  ooh , this is good . 
  a valid interpretation here , we 've got . 
  someone give this man a hand for deciphering that handwriting and not coming to the conclusion that this is a load of bs !, 
   declined languages, 
  synthetic languages . 
  naw , they have shadow powers , unlike the hs version . 
  the midnight crew that dave follows is the one that you 're thinking of ; that flash is for them , and they are separate in canon from the trolls ' midnight crew . 
  also where the hammer of zillyhoo originated from . 
  ... ah , you 're right . 
  if we develop efficient terraforming technology before interstellar travel , mars might be worth it for living space . 
  look at the size of that goddamn red spot . 
  jesus dick that resolution . 
  did i say after ? 
  i meant before . 
  edit : ohhh . 
  well . 
  good point . 
  but it 's especially worth it if it 's one of our only shots . 
  reminds me of [ this meme ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pantskat ) . 
  eheheh , i posted that link . 
  [ it is in fact the poster image for ragequit on tvtropes . 
  was that sarcasm ? 
  these were 2008/9 winter midterms we 're talking about , for me ; specifically , the date of 2009.1.16 , as you 'd say it here ( 1/16/09 in america ) . 
  it also technically was n't finished yet . 
  you ? 
  well , not * ever * . 
  the universe is a big place . 
  mail him a box of dildos ? 
  so , for certain definitions of `` ever '' . 
  well , it seems that dream selves do n't need sustenance , so could n't they just pop ( like the planets ) at the same time that the player arrives on earth , and age with the player ? 
  occam 's razor applies here . 
  if homestuck is over , and this has n't happened , then we should do ot ourselves . 
  i think he mentioned once that at that point he had no plans for the ancestors . 
  i ca n't find the source , though ( actually i have n't looked , but i 'm on an iphone so i should get a free pass or something ) . 
  however , this does n't entirely contradict the assumption for which your question is seeking validation ; hussie could have planned for four completely different kids , and retroactively decided to make them the ancestors . 
  but , why does n't he fix them ? 
  i support this . 
  oh , i do n't care !, 
  i 'm glad i showed someone something amusing . 
  [ listen , what he 's suggesting is n't that complicated either .
