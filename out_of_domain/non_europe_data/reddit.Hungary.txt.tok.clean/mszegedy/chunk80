  destructive red tentacles . 
  [ the theory is n't that it 's the condesce 's red miles .

  yeah , also , if you make larger chambers ( with the magma being pumped out of 3x3 chambers instead of 1x1s ) , then the lag essentially disappears , since the lag comes mostly from recalculating the temperature of the walls every time magma is taken out of/put into the chamber . 
  !! science !, 
  [ ] ( / sweetcatch ), 
  but seriously [ sorry i thought it was obvious ] ( / ga ), 
  wait , is n't the entering order going to be the same , though ( egbert/crocker , lalonde , strider , harley/english ) ? 
  so not `` gg --  tt --  gt --  tg '' , but gg , tg , tt , gt ?

  did n't captor already have a hoodie ? 
  maybe hocus is 3rd or 4th declension !, 
  edit : huh , hocere . 
  wait , keep it that way . 
  it 's brilliant . 
  none of the ancestors are , for that matter . 
  yes , that is true . 
  eh , i 'm not talented enough for that , and i do n't have permission to do it anyway . 
  plus i might want to use that length later . 
  so , how do you launch it ? 
  i apologize if this is too obvious . 
  that 's really cool , but how does it get up there in the first place ? 
  and vriska 's quirk is just unpredictable .

  why are you using zeroes , asshole ? 
  are you dead ? 
  have you finally pulled an aradia and kicked the fucking filial pail ? 
  i am so glad that i wo n't have to put up with you . 
  `` shall '' is only to be used in the first person . 
  anyone who does otherwise is misusing it . 
  you have inspired me !, 
  brb , making something cool . 
  come on , the color matches from this angle . 
  much better than wood , if that 's what you 're suggesting . 
  and it 's too smooth on the regular thing to have wooden texture anyway . 
  it 's fine the way it is . 
  ~ ~ now put some emerald ore on there . ~ ~, 
  what do you have in mind ?

  yup . 
  and shakespeare , too . 
  although it might not have been incorrect back then . 
  are you sure you know what `` schizophrenic '' means ?

  wrong grammar , not wrong word . 
  \\* shrug * that 's what i 've been taught in english class , anyway . 
  and i went to america and asked a literacy teacher there , and she confirmed it . 
  i do n't doubt you , but care to cite your source ? 
  ah , but it does n't cite the source !, 
  whatever , though ; i believe you . 
  though , if i were to attempt to prove this to a teacher , then they would n't accept it !, 
  or they would dismiss it . 
  anyway , i 'm for descriptivism , so who cares about some bullshit `` 1st person '' rule in the context of today 's use .
