  excuse me for trying to do something nice for all of us . 
  asshole . 
  or it could be a red herring . 
  but the last time i thought something was a red herring ( dirk + roxy live in atlantis future ) , i was wrong . 
  so i 'm playing it safe here ; you do n't ignore such a huge pile of evidence . 
  he has usurped karkat as the shittiest artist . 
  so , top 3 shittiest artists are :, 
  [ terezi ] ( / gc ), 
  ( edit : top 3 best :, 
  it 's abstract ; each differently-colored line represents its respective character . 
  [ orange ] ( / stt ) is dirk . 
  [ gunmetal ] ( / uu ) is uu . 
  [ red ] ( / tg ) is the shades . 
  [ cyan ] ( / sgg ) is jane . 
  [ pink ] ( / stg ) is roxy . 
  the paths of the lines represent the paths of the characters . 
  but i agree on the swirly cheeks anyway . 
  ... which are the b1 arc number . 
  that is n't a thing that that changes . 
  not souix . 
  you 've offended some people there !, 
  does anyone mind of i go `` lol '' ? 
  because i really did . 
  i laughed out loud . 
  it was extremely funny . 
  [ _ ] ( / docscratch ), 
  [ _ ] ( / docscratch ), 
  [ _ ] ( / docscratch ), 
  [ _ ] ( / docscratch ), 
  i hate the fandom . 
  [ _ ] ( / docscratch ), 
  lol . 
  \uff28\uff21\uff29\uff2c \uff23\uff34\uff28\uff35\uff2c\uff35, 
  dave stated that he was the worst artist out of any of the characters , after he made the legendary shipping diagram . 
  you do n't argue with dave . 
  you * do n't * argue with dave . 
  also , one can be ironic on such a level that their statements are still true . 
  that actually happens every other level of irony . 
  my friends and i call it `` even irony '' , as opposed to `` odd irony '' ( 'cause it 's an even number of levels , see ? 
  calling it now : crystalmethequins will be used in a flash . 
  further speculation : this flash will be the big , dramatic entrance of vriska and tavros , after they had decided to '' [ fuck shit up . 
  ] ( / ag ) '' they will appear at the point that the floaty crystal melody turns into the serious downward sequence synth . 
  the rest of the piece is them fucking shit up . 
  ... wow , i did n't know you frequented this subreddit . 
  the only time i ever saw you was on / r/talesfromtechsupport . 
  you were the guy who am not from moscow . 
  you do n't have to repost every image from the comic . 
  i 'm going to be cynical here and assume that this is a karma grab , whether you admit it or not . 
  if uu , then it was in the latest update . 
  but okay ( the effort is multiplied for me , since i am on iphone ) :, 
  top 3 worst :, 
  [ karkat ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/matingdiagramformorons.gif ), 
  top 3 best :, 
  [ uu ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/dirkisthisyou.gif ), 
  watch it be something completely different . 
  or not , is more likely . 
  as did i. 
  it was much more painful to listen to , at least . 
  i felt that it was `` so bad it 's worse '' . 
  i had to force myself not to skip it ( it was worth it ) . 
  [ for those who do n't get the reference . 
  ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/extras/ps000013.html ), 
  this makes john and jade black as well then ? 
  like `` gamegirl ( 1993 edition ) '' ? 
  it takes no responsibility for this debacle . 
  `` a friend of mine '' ; yeah , right . 
  `` so , the majority of these attacks were incited by ... '', 
  '' ... young muslims . '', 
  `` well , shit . '', 
  is that a quote ? 
  i want to reuse this , and attribute it properly . 
  you did n't put the worst one in the title : $ 105 for bottled water . 
  why ya got ta mention he 's gay ? 
  it 's basically irrelevant , and any qualifiers suggest that you 're disparaging him on account of those qualifiers . 
  edit : typo -  fixed . 
  this is the internet . 
  we pull numbers out of our heads . 
  \\* god * damn * i 'm quotable *, 
  their source is the daily mail . 
  really ? 
  fuck you . 
  seriously , just fuck you , you worthless piece of shit . 
  this . 
  * this * is / r/nottheonion content . 
  fermentation adds impact , amirite ? 
  oh my god , looking back on this i ca n't believe i wasted so much time typing out this pointless garbage . 
  i mean , who is it for ? 
  who 's going to read it ? 
  it 's never going to serve any fucking purpose . 
  i have better things to do than yell at my own fucking self all day . 
  woops , shit , there are no days here , am i right ? 
  well , fuck me for that mistake . 
  no , wait , fuck you . 
  fuck you for making me type all this out . 
  it 's all bullshit . 
  i 'm leaving . 
  ... i could sort of copy and paste your comment into mine . 
  i do n't get it . 
  are you trolling me or something ? 
  what would this `` flame war '' even be about ?
