  why would i want to waste my time taking part in it ? 
  you 're being extremely irrational , or assuming that i am . 
  also , the manner in which you replied to me is very immature , and i do n't appreciate it . 
  this is n't what the internet is for . 
  if you have a problem with that , leave . 
  naw , i know . 
  just mentioning a couple interesting consequences . 
  and i do n't really give a fuck either way , either . 
  characters are characters . 
  race would have basically no further impact on the story . 
  and that 's how i like it . 
  i know i 'm preaching to the choir here , but do n't read into my post so much . 
  no , what i 'm saying is that i would have like to seen their reactions when they found out that their results are n't politically correct . 
  they appear to be posters . 
  unless it 's stated otherwise ? 
  either way , along the course of the depicted events from the story , she has n't been observed drawing anything . 
  although this would still count if i had conclusive evidence she drew it . 
  oh , and i think it deserves this :, 
  [ ] ( / sweetcatch ), 
  i just made that up , actually . 
  is gunmetal actually an official name for it ? 
  ... what ? 
  your theory sounds cool but i 'm having trouble comprehending it . 
  huh . 
  hmm . 
  i 'm trying to decide whether she 's better than uu . 
  heheh , musta been a bit embarrassing . 
  so , how 's this look ?

  let me guess ... he suggested jeb/redstonehelper equivalence ? 
  it is a funny thought !, 
  i laughed as well , although i 'm a bit sad that it 's probably not true , as it was reported by the daily mail . 
  i just do n't see why you had to mention `` gay '' . 
  as i said earlier , any qualifiers you added to your coworker as you were disparaging him gave the impression that you were disparaging him on account of those qualifiers . 
  now it looks like you 're a homophobe , which i would n't assume of anyone unless they explicitly demonstrated it . 
  i just do n't think it was a smart move . 
  but then the way you replied to my message was ... 
  i mean really , caps lock ? 
  and you accused me of trying to incite a flame war , which is pretty much the opposite of my personal philosophy . 
  and then you rejoice at having offended me . 
  there are better ways to start conversations than offending people . 
  you do n't * have * to inspire enmity to communicate . 
  this is why , as it stands , i do n't like you very much . 
  but we should n't have to strive for each others ' approval anyway ; neither of us should feel guilty at being disliked by the other , because it bears no consequence upon us in any way . 
  and i do n't think that either of us feel so . 
  so , really , this is just a typical exchange on the internet , is n't it ? 
  and we can take away from it what we want . 
  that 's what 's awesome in * my * books . 
  what i am saying is that you used the word `` gay '' in the place of an actual insult . 
  if you had used an insult in the place of an insult , i would have been fine with it because it 's an insult that 's being used as an insult , the way insults should be . 
  but construing a word that is not inherently an insult , moreover , one that is commonly and distastefully construed as an insult , is not a thing that is okay . 
  i would have acted the same way had you said `` the bicyclist '' in the cubicle next to you , although in a less hostile manner , since using `` bicyclist '' as an insult does n't have the same connotation as using `` gay '' as an insult . 
  you may not actually have wanted to use it as an insult , but that 's how it came off . 
  i think the original was better . 
  plus , the best part about crystalmethequins is the big reveal , and this video skipped straight to it . 
  that 's not really a problem , though . 
  sooner or later , everyone figures out that acting in one 's own interest can still work out for others . 
  ~ ~ but i 'm too smart to fall to cognitive bias ! ~ ~, 
  allow me to be the one who states the obvious : romance languages have nothing to do with the concept of romance . 
  now i just have to wait for chastric to show up and get on my side ... 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i said b1 . 
  eheheh , my mother hated it the first time it came out . 
  ( except it 's not a ninja edit , 'cause there 's that asterisk there ! ), 
  i do n't know anything about either . 
  the problem is , i do n't know * anything * about either . 
  other than that avengers has * all of * the superheroes in it ( plus the hulk ) , and a few faces from adventure time ( like the main characters 'n' shit , plus the general noodly art style ) . 
  adventure time airs here in hungary , though , but i never watch tv , except the news on m1 and occasionally an old movie on rtl klub . 
  oh , and i watch movies on m1 nonstop on the first of may , but those are pretty much the same ones every year . 
  well , that got off topic . 
  too late . 
  it was 415 at the time that i went to check . 
  i unupvoted , so now it 's 414 . 
  [ she has canonically been referred to as the thief of life . 
  ] ( http://mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006678 ) it is indisputable that she is such . 
  i just did act 6 search and searched for `` thief of life '' . 
  how do you know what timezone he 's in ? 
  for example , it 's eight in the morning here , and it is * extremely imperative * that i should go to bed ( but school 's out motherfuckers !, 
  i 'm pulling a karkat right now because it 's * eight thirty in the morning and i 'm not asleep yet * , and i regularly pull a karkat by sending hatemail to my future self !, 
  ( the bastard has yet to receive any of it . ), 
  that 's the * best phrase * . 
  too bad about it , too ; it looks like it was a nice rig . 
  well , it 's still fixable ... just start up the air compressor ... 
  \\* raises hand slowly *, 
  i know * no * bands whatsoever . 
  a few people that sing and produce albums together , i guess . 
  even gamegrl and gamebro ? 
  also , for some reason , this is my favorite piece in the whole album . 
  i mean wtf . 
  counter-argument : cheeburger-cheeburger is even better . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i 've ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ never ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ actually ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ been ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ there . 
  link please ? 
  aaaaand how about the original walk-stab-walk ? 
  is n't the remix superior to it in every way ? 
  the joke is the opposite -- that the only one he got right was stevie wonder , and the rest were composers . 
  rather than that all of the things he wrote were composers , and somehow he managed to stick stevie wonder in there . 
  yes . 
  i feel like i 've heard this before ... anyway , great piece . 
  i 'm not into the more modern composers too much , but this is certainly redemption for all those microtonal pieces that my friend 's put me through .
