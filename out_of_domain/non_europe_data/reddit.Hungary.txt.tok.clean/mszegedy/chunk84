  ( by the way , the '' 's '' is a contraction for `` has '' ; i know english grammar . ), 
  i do n't think you 're the only one . 
  but wsw-beatdown definitely ruined walk-stab-walk for a lot of people . 
   based off, 
  i have no choice but to turn to descriptivism . 
  this is officially an english phrase now . 
  there is nothing else it can be . 
  i mean , this ca n't happen on accident ... right ? 
  like , the glasses , the hair , the weird ghostly tail , the orange color ... that 's just [ fucking incredible ] ( / dunkass ) . 
  edit : oh and also the pose . 
  like , totally . 
  to be fair , that has several other remixes as well . 
  remixes that i ca n't tell apart . 
  and then you also get entirely new things like trepidation . 
  why would you ? 
  they 're both so crappy !, 
  yes . 
  i think their [ fucking shit up ] ( / ag ) will be directly relevant to the characters , and they will make an epic debut in a flash set to crystalmethequins . 
  they will make their entrance to the other characters in the part of the piece where it changes from the floaty melody to the rest of the piece , to be specific . 
  but that 's just me . 
  we are rereading at basically the exact same point , and if i may guess , the exact same pace . 
  the only difference is ( and this is conjectural ) , i 'm rereading in 1080p . 
  so , which one did you decide to use , anyway ? 
  [ ahahaha the art pile does n't stop from getting taller ] ( / dunkass ), 
  oh , i remember this !, 
  aww ... < 3, 
  i did n't get this one . 
  virgo . 
  also , her modus is chastity ( because virgo ) . 
  the problem is that a couple are out of character . 
  especially jade , like what was that about ? 
  two different flairs , bro . 
  also look at me , i 'm fucking with you . 
  i still do n't get it ? 
  does it relate to his codpiece or something ? 
  plus , karma, 
  ohh . 
  no , why would you do that ? 
  some other people might have the same question . 
  aww , the top left one is so sad . 
  ; - ; also the bottom right but not as much because he came back immediately afterwards , with fireworks and things . 
  yes . 
  edit : come on , this is the third time the past 48 hours that i 've begun a `` yes , hell yes , hell . 
  yes '' chain and nobody 's reciprocated !, 
  it 's like putting your hand up for a high-five , and everyone just leaving it there hanging . 
  you 're right . 
  though , [ pir8tes ] ( / ag ) in general do , in popular culture ... 
  not again !, 
  why do i have to see this again ?!, 
  enough , i say !, 
  [ _ ] ( / docscratch ), 
  eheh . 
  barbershop . 
  problem is it could be any old dude with any old two common symbols next to him . 
  it 's definitely homestuck , but just barely . 
  what ? 
  why is it bad ? 
  do n't tell me that i ca n't end my sentence with a preposition . 
  and that 's a very common contraction ; i only put the explanation on the bottom so that people do n't think i 'm being an ignorant douche , since audiating the sentence like people usually do makes it sound like it 's more likely that i meant plural `` friends '' , and fucked up like an idiot . 
  edit : fixed a comma splice . 
  fuckin ' grammar cops 're everywhere . 
  oh , whoops , i 've been pronouncing it `` noymuh '' all this time . 
  this is exactly what i have been looking for . 
  this , and a way to create chrome themes . 
  dammit . 
  deleting now . 
  no , wikipedia gives [ nju\u02d0m ] , which is basically how you are pronouncing it . 
  bluh , this is the one ipa convention for english that irks me ; it should really be written [ nj\u028fum ] . 
  it 's a diphthong/glide , not a long [ u\u02d0 ] !, 
  whatever . 
  though , i 'm sure killing a horrorterror is n't as simple as shooting it through the heart . 
  they probably do n't even * have * hearts . 
  okay , * someone * make art of two sollux godtiers fighting each other , * pronto * . 
  huh . 
  it comes out as aids . 
  [ ~ ~ go search for it ~ ~ ] ( http://i.imgur.com/grogq.png ), 
  he 'd be english , assuming nominal inheritance works the same way it future earth as it does now . 
   [ then you are saying some rude a-hole is killin our frog ] ( / stg ), 
  roxy ... 
  gets it !!!, 
  there is no better feeling than this . 
  we 'll leave one to tumblr , the other to hsg . 
  i do n't think so . 
  really ? 
  [ omg it does . 
  ] ( http://www.andrewhussie.com/comic.php?sec=archive&amp;auth=andrew&amp;cid=aids/00001.jpg ), 
  [ john : you are like a furry now , but not really the weird kind that people on the internet like to have sex with in their imagination . 
  and * especially * wheatly . 
  you could do a naming scheme based entirely on internet cats . 
  nyan_cat , longcat , ceiling_cat , lolcat ... 
  wait for it ... * wait for it ... * oh shit there goes cascade, 
  not really , but it 's real cool anyway . 
  i 'm not sure what to think about that . 
  cool !, 
  if very brutal . 
  `` we pass the time by burning several animals live over a short period of time ! '', 
  could you give an explanation for those that do n't get it ( like me ) ? 
  ( hint : i 'm not 20_percent_cooler ; i 'm way less cool than that . 
  i guess it 's okay if you were addressing him , though . ), 
  yes !!,
