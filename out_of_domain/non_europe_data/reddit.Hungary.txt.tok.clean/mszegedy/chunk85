  yes !!, 
  i still have `` seer of plots '' . 
  we have successfully broken into sbahj symbolism !, 
  now , on the topic , i think geromy represents dd . 
  ( not really ; dave would n't 've known about him , unless he came to earth at any point . ), 
  why is everyone calling her `` trickster '' roxy ? 
  what is this a reference to that i 'm unaware of ? 
  ohhh , i forgot about that . 
  thanks !, 
  eheheh , i forgot about this !, 
  or , well , it was floating around as a half-remembered concept in my head , but i definitely did n't remember the name . 
  seed or it did n't happen, 
  if you all just wanted `` update '' , i could make a bot that does it , and fill out a hundred accounts for it so that it would be impossible to ban them all for a long time . 
  i 've seen many shops in my day . 
  hughes has a new series up , * ra * . 
  take a look at it , it might turn out to be better than * fine structure * !, 
  also , since then , i 've discovered numerous additional imperfections . 
  ~ ~ but i popularized it ! ~ ~, 
  ( link karma edition ), 
  the year that i leave the u.s. 
  perfect . 
  i mean post-scratch dave . 
  but if i create them all at once , and they only show their faces one by one when new updates come along , then it will take 100 updates to ban 100 accounts !, 
  ( but i do n't intend to do this ! ), 
  he 's the master !, 
  ( not really ), 
  why is he melting ? 
  ahhh the thumbnail it burns, 
  it needs some blacking out , yo . 
  someone call roxy !, 
  but seroiusly why is n't there an udtaep bot ? 
  ( dammit i ca n't type today oh well ), 
  nvm then . 
  amazingly relevant to todays ` update ? 
  sorry that was meant to be an exvlamtion point . 
  ( my fingers suvk today and i do n't have the energy to corretc my typos ), 
  well , the denizens do n't go around killing authors . 
  edit : also , this iteragion of le exploded out of scratch , so we definitely know that uu does n't `` grow up '' to be that particular le . 
  eheh , i just finished editing my post ; could you take a look at it ? 
  i 'm not arguing against it . 
  i 'm asking why you find it fun . 
  ( sorry , i should add that to the original . ), 
  naw , man , i was perfectly normal when i wrote this . 
  it 's really not that hard to come up with !, 
  one dimension is already represented by flipping through with a pair of keys , so why not add another one ? 
  it 's purely hypothetical anyway , although in terms of coding it is completely realistic . 
  i 'm not that creative , and not that logical . 
  but i do occasionally have ideas . 
  ( no animosity is being directed towards you whatsoever here !, 
  i do n't mean to sound offended or anything ; i 'm just explaining things . 
  by the way , is mania more common as a part of bipolar disorder , or did you just forget that it comes on its own as well ? 
  no , i mean that doc scratch went directly to being le . 
  we know for sure that that particular anglicogenesis did n't happen by uu looking similar to calliope ( i will call her that , dammit ) growing and becoming lord english . 
  that might 've happened for a different instance of lord english , but ours was created when doc scratch exploded . 
  uu could still become the first ( or simply another ) lord english , or maybe his ancestor or something , but the timeline of the lord english that killed hussie began as scratch . 
  he did n't devolve into uu/uu in the meantime . 
  so there 's someone else already running around who is a master class ? 
  ... you started with that ? 
  anglicogenesis just means `` the birth of english '' . 
  i do n't think english and `` angel '' have the same etymological roots . 
  that 's true . 
  i do n't think hussie would reuse something like that , though . 
  this is why i stress that i am referring to * our * le , i.e. , the le that has been running around since he exploded out of scratch . 
  now , who believed him ? 
  ~ ~ cause i did . ~ ~, 
  i came to the conclusion that they are another race a while ago , when it became clear that they were the only two people in their session . 
  i never would have suspected that they are the same race as lord english . 
  what does the green sun have to do with dave ? 
  surely you 're not suggesting that it 's because it exploded in his face when he went godtier ? 
  then she would n't ask for it , in the rare case that roxy knew it . 
  he probably saw that davesprite ( [ hehehe ] ( / dunkass ) ) was the most upvoted thing in the subreddit , and attempted to get karma by imitating it . 
  the wikipedia article for the muse calliope . 
  where did you get * that * from ? 
  oh and i have to ask , who then are those people who wear fursuits ? 
  ( i 'm assuming you 're an expert on furryology ), 
  no , he was n't assuming that you have a terrible fanfic . 
  the 4th person in english can be represented as either `` one '' , or , more colloquially and in much more common use , `` you '' . 
  he was using the 4th person , not the 2nd person . 
  ( it could also be interpreted as the 0th person , but i prefer 4th because that 's what it 's called when you study finnish . 
  hey , look , i just used it !, 
  ... wtf ? 
  where did you even get callinus from if you are n't even studying ancient greek ? 
  ( sorry if you 're not the person who posted it initially ; i ca n't see it from here ), 
  oh it 's \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb-fuck i ca n't type the iota with the arc-thingy-\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 !, 
  anyway , what i mean is , how did you hear about him in the first place ? 
  people do n't usually go looking up greek poets ... ( sorry if i sounded hostile , i was just really confused because of the above ), 
  uh , do you know ipa ? 
  are you sure ? 
  it 's sort of , [ kal-lee-oh-pay ] . 
  ( although actually the wikipedia gives / \u0259 / for the first vowel rather than / \u00e6 / . ), 
  i 've always been torn on whether it 's / l\u026al k\u00e6l / , / l\u026a\u0294\u0259l k\u00e6l / , or / l\u026a\u027e\u0259l k\u00e6l / ( i.e. 
  / l\u026at\u0259l k\u00e6l / ) . 
  i meant specifically people who wear fursuits . 
  i mean , that shit 's weird , man . 
  but okay . 
  bard is passive , dummy . 
  calypso was a female nymph , like callisto . 
  they 're equally ( un ) likely . 
  thank you ; that is exacty what i 'm asking . 
  i wanted to have the [ green sun ] ( / gg ) in the bottom-right corner , but i had to flip it both turn-ways and flat-ways to get it to be even in the picture on smaller resolutions .
