  what do you mean by `` does n't into any other '' ? 
  thank you very much for putting my thoughts into words . 
  why this is still taught is beyond me . 
  however , i also have n't the faintest idea of how to start teaching the truth . 
  ... really ? 
  d : it 's a huge picture !, 
  i could make an obscenely large one tomorrow , but i do n't know how i 'll do the bar at the top . 
  oh well , got ta think of something !, 
  ( also , the size i quoted was 1600x900px ; it should work fine for that width ; height is n't really a limiting factor here ), 
  that 's brilliant in every way , but lord \u00c6nglisc has legs . 
  too soon , i think . 
  head to / r/circlejerk . 
  the top bar is always 30px high , and gets cut in width as the window gets less wide . 
  the image that i have is actually 2043x39 , but scaled down , it 's roughly the same ratio as 1600x30 , and i * do * assume it scales . 
  the particular image that i used for that has a relatively very low ratio ( and is 2043px in width ; not sure how high ) , and that 's pretty much what 's limiting me in making a longer header image . 
  woops , i could have sworn that i said / r/circlejerk . 
  ~ ~ upgrade to chrome . ~ ~ you know what , i 'll figure out how tomorrow , especially for you . 
  oh ok , that works . 
  yeah , i got ta make a bigger one then . 
  do n't worry , i 'll be on it tomorrow . 
  ( or i can be lazy and just do left-align , which also works . 
  i think i 'll do both . ), 
  which one 's karkat ? 
  by the emoticon in the title , it seems that you were suggesting that they look like tavros . 
  or , and i have no problem with this theory , since i was never fully satisfied with how they came into existence ( actually i 'll post a link about that right now ) , you 're suggesting that they all look vaguely like cherubs . 
  i do n't think he was comparing it to the pickup lines , just offhandedly mentioning terrible fanfics . 
  whoa . 
  sudden flashback to every time that i 've had to interpret ancient scripture . 
  never again . 
  but chrome also has addons , and they 're available in one nice store ... 
  i could 've forgotten that . 
  i ca n't check now , but * maybe * . 
  huh . 
  well , anyway , `` callinus '' is a romanized version ; the greeks would 've spelled it `` kallinos '' , which is what i was doing . 
  done . 
  actually , no !, 
  i got ta go back and see ... 
  well , it 's sort of inherent ; the greeks did n't have the letter c , just like the romans did n't have the letter k , and the greeks used the masculine ending - \u03bf\u03c2 , as opposed to roman - us , so that 's basically it for greek vs roman spelling . 
  oh , and instead of roman diphthong \u00e6 ( pronounced very similarly to `` eye '' ) , the greeks used \u03b1\u03b9 , so when i did a paper on greek historian ( a very bad historian ) tim\u00e6us , his contemporaries would 've called him \u03a4\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 ( timaios ) . 
  that 's all !, 
  [ ok , fixed it for you !, 
  ] ( http://www.chrometheme.net/node/26060 ) it 's in the bottom right now , too , like i originally wanted . 
  ` k , this shit looks complicated . 
  what exactly do you have in mind ? 
  because i can change basically anything in the interface here , it looks like . 
  who told you that ? 
  do you know what a meme is ? 
  do you know what `` nerd culture '' is ? 
  and how does it make this post tantamount to misogyny ? 
  no , wait , i see what you 're saying . 
  i would n't say it 's especially misogynistic , though . 
  based on this evidence , you really should n't date chicks that are `` crazy '' . 
  or , ahem , those that seem especially liable to commit unpredictable acts . 
  yes , you could , and it 's * very * painful . 
  but it 'll allow me to work on the insides of hard drives in enclosed , dust-free spaces , right ? 
  so , do i repost it there , or should i count this as the repost ? 
  bluh , sorry , but it 's really complicated . 
  :( like , someone should write an application that allows you to do these quickly . 
  [ i mean holy shit . 
  ] ( https://developer.mozilla.org/en/building_a_theme ) sorry , but you 're on your own here !, 
  i can give you the [ ~ ~ two ~ ~ three ] ( http://imgur.com/a/h08ze ) images that i used for the chrome theme , though . 
  that was horrific !, 
  also , cue 2:52 ... `` this can only end well ... '', 
  aradia later used the music boxes as a time machine , like dave used his turntables as a time machine . 
  the human universe 's beat mesa was the human hero of time 's time machine , just big , so the troll universe 's beat mesa was the troll hero of time 's time machine , just big . 
  all this means is that the handmaid used the same sort of time machine that aradia did , which makes sense . 
  it took me a brief while to get that aradia 's time machines are those turny cranky music things ; i.e. , music boxes . 
  so , you 're not alone !, 
  just like i have to spell `` pronunciation '' `` pro-noun/nun-see-ay - shun '' to show its pronunciation ? 
  great twist, 
  clearly this means that jake is le !, 
  indisputably !, 
  i dunno , i think it 's pretty cool . 
  incredibly . 
  there 's no way i could have done better . 
  ( i really suck at drawing , though ), 
  maybe 900 math sat . 
  i just took the image , flipped it , and attached it to itself . 
  i can not believe how well it works ( particularly with the chain ) . 
  same . 
  i 'd feel sort of guilty otherwise . 
  once i buy an mspa thing from topotaco , though , i 'll rationalize turning it back off , since i gave andrew more money than he 'd ever make from me clicking ads . 
  that was n't supposed to happen . 
  there should be no way that that number can go up . 
  i accidentally the ratio ; the bottom number is supposed to be all the votes , rather than just the downvotes . 
  although the way i had it originally would be an interesting way to do it as well . 
  what the formula really should be , is [ this . 
  ] ( http://h.dropcanvas.com/qoyr3/karmaformulafixed.png ) thanks for taking the time to try it out , though !, 
  do recognize that the upvotes vs. downvotes are currently fuzzed some , however . 
  he 's the commie because his cables spell out the russian flag . 
  `` mmcmxci '' ? 
  are you missing an m , or did you mean to refer to the year 2991 ? 
  this is known as `` tentabulge '' . 
  my opinion is that it 's unoriginal . 
  `` wow , they 've got * tentacles * !, 
  in * naughty places * !, 
  cause they 're aliens !!! '', 
  this could mean anything with the spriteflipping . 
  also , although i do accept the existence of homestuck-coincidences ( one thing having multiple possible causes that are really pointless to distinguish from one another , yadda yadda ) , i must point out that le needed the peg leg because andrew tore off scratch 's leg when he was `` dancing '' with him , so the end of that leg was n't attached to the original body that le grew out of . 
  it 's # 666666 ( karkat 's is # 696969 , and uu 's is # 999999 ) .
