  i can confirm that they are the same thing . 
  we do not abide by fantrolls other than [ callie ohpeee ] ( / lime ) . 
  skipper plumbthroat is n't missing a leg, 
  this is ... 
  i 'm sorry , but this is incredibly obvious . 
  ** they 're points . 
  they do n't do anything . 
  karma increases over time . 
  it 's not exactly hard to engineer posts that gain or lose karma . 
  ** everyone knows this . 
  everyone still likes to see their karma score go up . 
  almost no one thinks that their karma score means anything significant , except the amount that the content they had produced has been liked by reddit . 
  it does n't take a genius to figure this out . 
  welcome to the club . 
  let 's pose as a team . 
  the world is real . 
  the data about the rate of karma gain vs. rate of karma loss is interesting , though . 
  it 's very statistically insignificant , though ; we 'd need a much larger sample size to pull any meaningful data out . 
  let 's have at least nine more people repeat this experiment ( i ca n't do it , currently ; i 'm not going to have free time for over a month ) . 
  then we can see . 
  proof i 'm real, 
  sturgeon 's law : 90 % of everything is shit . 
  noir is basically an animal now . 
  there 's little to stop him . 
  ... holy shit , you 're right . 
  i mean , i knew that lil cal is the most important character in homestuck . 
  after all ( you might want to skip the rest of this sentence ; the end is the red word ) , he was used to create doc scratch , who became lord english , who trained the condesce , who inspired dave to post the `` miracles '' video , which inspired gamzee to create the accursed mascot , which made john draw pictures of harlequins , which made his father think that he likes harlequins , so he got him the giant harlequin doll , which was prototyped , which inspired the black queen give the dersites harlequin clothes , which made jack resent the queen so much that he killed her and fucked up two game [ sessions . 
  ] ( / tg ) but i did n't realize that hussie was actually referring to him , when he showed that panel of the `` most important character in homestuck '' that had gamzee in it . 
  lil cal was also there . 
  watching . 
  mvc ? 
  aww , he likes her !, 
  6:11 am here . 
  did someone say police ? 
  ( what country is it again that uses 611 as an emergency dial ? ), 
  edit : `` emergeny '', 
  [ * lime * ] ( / lime ) green . 
  the humans do it too . 
  go back to all the pre-scratch kids ' letters . 
  ... calliope is the devil ? 
  are we certain ? 
  seer is a confirmed passive class , and sylph is all but . 
  sorry , but you 're shit outta luck . 
  nice try , karmanaut !, 
  shit , i should actually do this . 
  cal is infused with the spirits of calliope and uu !, 
  this is the most accurate theory i 've ever heard . 
  in fact , i 'm not going to even call it a theory . 
  it 's complete fact . 
  although , the cherub session is a void session , given that their prospit has no prototyping towers . 
  plus , you know . 
  the dark skaia hypothesis . 
  [ sorry i thought it was obvious ] ( / ga ) ; however , almost no natural selection exists here . 
  the red queen hypothesis , therefore , * also * does n't apply . 
  in fact , the universes barely interact whatsoever . 
  * homestuck * is a rare instance of them doing so . 
  what 's to make the universes evolve , i.e. , pick out `` better '' universes over `` worse '' universes ? 
  the environment is constant , too . 
  unless it takes the environment multiple eternities to exhibit any noticeable change , which is possible , but ordered time does n't really apply in paradox space . 
  sburb is n't literally the frog ... the frog is n't a game . 
  i support this theory . 
  i had no good explanation for the auctoricide previously ; le just randomly showed up and started fucking shit up . 
  but now we 've got motivation . 
  i 'm accepting this as true until i find evidence otherwise . 
  but why would oh, 
  edit : so wait , the evolutionary objective of sburb is to create universes with players in it that can beat it ? 
  is n't that a little ... self-referential ? 
  edit 2 : specifically , why does n't sburb just make itself easier , then ? 
  it 's my pet name for the theory that their dark skaia ca n't support life ; that is , it 's impossible to grow the genesis frog in it . 
  not just you . 
  i think . 
  i may be connecting the wrong things . 
  aradia sheep ? 
  why ? 
  four kids play an extremely high-stakes cooperative video game , but it is n't really a `` video '' game at all , and is in fact an engine for ** [ redacted ] ** . 
  it turns out there 's lots more players , and lots of people who are n't players . 
  the community is currently agonizing over the identity of a particular player , in fact . 
  most of these people , players or not , die several times . 
  there 's time travel involved . 
  a lot of times it 's really funny . 
  the other times , it 's serious or sad . 
  but that does n't make sburb a frog . 
  why is it the thing that he does ? 
  ** [ redacted ] **, 
  this is good advice . 
  i will remember it always . 
  ( my only advice is 1 . read the pesterlogs , they 're the goddamn dialogue , why do people seem to think that they can just go ahead and leave these out , and 2 . do n't spoil any part whatsoever for yourself , instead read and be amazed , it 's seriously better this way ), 
  yes , definitely . 
  jeez , you 're really receptive . 
  dude , you serious ? 
  it 's [ ] ( / spoiler `` the creation of universes . '' ), 
  assuming i did the spoiler right . 
  hussie himself said that doc scratch is a devil figure . 
  that 's a * means * ? 
  `` future '' ? 
  paradox space is more complcated than that !, 
  by a different universe altogether , maybe she means simply an alternate timeline ? 
  but yeah , that [ sbahj morch ] ( / dunkass ) is so indestructible that it exists in other universes . 
  they should make houses out of the stuff . 
  jaypegs ?
