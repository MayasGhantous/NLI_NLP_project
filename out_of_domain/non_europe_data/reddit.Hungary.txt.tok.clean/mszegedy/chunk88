  not jpegs ? 
  [ jpogs ] ( / dunkass ) ? 
  i know , right ? 
  pay no attention to the '' ^ cake '' language , either . 
  no , that 's thbbbbbbbbpphppphppppbbbbhbbpppppphh . 
  edit : well shit . 
  i only decided to take a look at it a week or two ago , and it looked like this . 
  you mean to tell me it was different before ? 
  ... this is news to me . 
  the blood-like substance is wv 's blood . 
  the prototyping rings let them use red miles . 
  tge two are unrelated . 
  blue fathoms . 
  or blue leagues . 
  it was the major thing that distinguished the past version of jack from the future version in the trolls ' universe . 
  jack could n't have gone into the trolls ' universe until he got his hand bloody , so there were `` two '' of him running around until that happened . 
  the fandom was waiting for the event , and it came in cascade . 
  or just a backslash . 
  i screwed up . 
  you can use a backslash to escape pretty much everything ( except the police ) . 
  yeah . 
  what 's the unicode number for those , again ? 
  [ \\* le sign * ] ( / stg ), 
  [ you fat nasty trash ] ( / dunkass ), 
  it did . 
  it summoned lord english . 
  you think a black hole the mass of two universes would matter to paradox space so much that it would wipe everything out ? 
  that 's like saying that irl , a black hole the mass of two stars would be the end of the entire universe . 
  [ i mean come on ] ( / dunkass ), 
  but yeah , lil cal is the bad guy . 
  he has already led to the creation of scratch and english . 
  or , just use a tiny sticky note . 
  i warned you about karma , bro !, 
  how about ... ... . all the 13 year olds, 
  and you, 
  no , that 's what i did . 
  i just ca n't remember the unicode number for that particular character . 
  that 's just a `` hook '' that he leaves so that he could come back to it later . 
  * especially * in sweden . 
  this is a circlejerk subreddit . 
  what causes this ? 
  why are some of the < b  's < 8  's ? 
  ... but not all of them are replaced ? 
  i thpught it was mountains from the thumbnail . 
  like you 're doing ? 
  making cute little criticisms sometimes has a sobering effect . 
  yes . 
  ... uu is actually getting better at drawing . 
  jake is just ko 'd . 
  dirk 's dreamself is probably going to die while ko 'd . 
  homestuck is being written by hussie . 
  and you could tell the shape of her hair . 
  similarly , dirk 's glasses were relatively obvious . 
  both jake and dirk are relatively far from being dead ( especially jake ) , we know roxy survives because she continues to void out the session , and we know jane survives because lopah scripture indicates that she will at least survive to be alive after roxy and dirk die ( not completely , just one of their normal or dreamselves ; up until now it was assumed that their dreamselves were the ones that had to die , but apparently either any self dying constitutes a lantern going out , or roxy and dirk are both going to dream-die ) . 
  he knows about it , but does n't watch it . 
  he 's not stupid , either ; he 's in touch with his fanbase enough that he knows what to reference . 
  [ \\* cannon ] ( / dunkass ), 
  just change the url to the next entry . 
  i 'm on an ios device as well . 
  i say yes , to the cheeks as well . 
  no , i know that you 're not op . 
  i was just suggesting a method better than simply being told what happened . 
  you suggested the links in the update thread , so i thought it would be appropriate to mention an alternate way , one that i think is better , in fact . 
  no one said that . 
  i did n't even imply it . 
  i was making a general statement . 
  unless i am mistaken , it 's a counterexample ? 
  sorry for the url shortener !, 
  it would n't let me submit it otherwise . 
  also sorry to spoil it for you but it 's satire . 
  yes . 
  it 's sort of a complaint about how shitty the view was from my seat on the plane . 
  then why did you act like public knowledge was of the contrary ? 
  do n't assume things about your readers if you have no idea who they are . 
  dude , this is now my desktop pic . 
  * fuck * yes . 
  dirkxdave dialogue , right here right now . 
  but , on the other hand , if they start * dying * , then it does show up . 
  hmm ... shit . 
  [ sorry i thought it was obvious ] ( / ga ), 
  ( but they 're a bit off , either way ; i believe jade 's is true green , or # 00ff00 , rather than whatever you have there ( probably something like # 20fb1c or something ) ), 
  edit : woops fixed, 
  what , really ? 
  ... wow . 
  that is * extremely * shitty . 
  seconded . 
  [ s ] dave : mental breakdown . 
  though , he should 've made it a scratched disc sign , not a shades sign . 
  ohpeee . 
  as opposed to ophee . 
  yeah . 
  my preferred term is `` nonefold '' . 
  if i get bored of it , i say `` nullfold '' . 
  thirteen , amirite , amirite ? 
  hmm , this sounds like an opportunity for karma . 
  piss off * all * of the teenagers . 
  all of them . 
  turn reddit into something that they hate , with the least possible consequence to other people . 
  they 'd leave , and form a deeply negative opinion of reddit that should keep them off until they are mature enough until they realize hiw stupid it was to get upset over that . 
  it 's the perfect crime .
