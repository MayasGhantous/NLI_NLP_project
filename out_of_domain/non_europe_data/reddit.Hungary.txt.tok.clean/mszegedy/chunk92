  but right now , it 's painful , bloody , and hazardous to health , so i 'm against it . 
  ( by the way , it 's nice debating you . 
  i 'm here to have my opinions challenged , and you 're doing a good job of it ! ), 
  i still got lots of karma for it . 
  :d plus , it 's the thought that counts . 
  is the message board homestuck-themed ? 
  source : http://www.mspaintadventures.com/sweetbroandhellajeff, 
  so-bad-its-good needs context ? 
  whenever someone asks me why i am downvoting myself , i either say `` cause i 'm an asshole '' or outright `` self hate '' . 
  [ oh , that explains newgrounds . 
  ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ltlw42aqcu1r0efodo1_500.png ), 
  i listened to it all the way through . 
  wow this is different . 
  and * good * . 
  i know . 
  just saying . 
  also , you do n't actually get any karma for upvoting yourself . 
  you just lose karma if you unupvote yourself . 
  try it out ; make an alt account and post a lot . 
  see whether your karma score changes significantly . 
  now downvote a bunch of them . 
  ( not from the profile ; that only unupvotes it ; you have to click `` context '' and try it from there ) your karma will instantly decrease . 
  did someone say [ s ] ? 
  i cry evertim, 
  cause she 's an auxiliatrix amirite, 
  what the flying fuck is this ? 
  shit , that 's what i thought he was [ refrancing ] ( / dunkass ) too . 
  i think it 's more likely that it 's a parody . 
  this is true , but this is like saying john did n't understand her nanna . 
  bec was jade 's guardian , not poppop or whoever . 
  i ~ ~ discovered ~ ~ ahem confirmed that i have no patience for any music in any sort of major . 
  it 's too bad about it ; it was a really nice and jumpy tune , too . 
  i like the piece insofar as composition !, 
  it 's just not my style . 
  what the * flying * fuck . 
  all the nasals, 
  all the front vowels, 
  ahh why you mention the [ ] ( / spoiler `` universe creation myth '' ) . 
  that 's spoiler . 
  you 're bad and you should feel bad . 
  ahahaha it cascades . 
  what 's a jrpg ? 
   defy some laws of nature, 
  which is why they are useful !, 
   dave made a fucking skateboard that hovered into the sky . 
  holy shit you 're right !, 
  it 's possible to create shitty jpegs that are lighter than air !, 
  this stuff is like adamantine in dwarf fortress ... man , we could easily replace kevlar with it . 
  what the fuck did i just read ? 
  i refuse to accept that i will ever be you . 
  and how do you know that ? 
  just because it sounds dramatic does n't mean that it 's true . 
  yup . 
  yup . 
  oh wait they are all hidden . 
  how do i unhide posts ? 
  that 's terrible . 
  in relation to homestuck i mean . 
  thank you !, 
  now the subreddit is back to normal . 
  well , reddit idolizes 4chan . 
  by that logic irrational numbers are literally irrational . 
  they are shitty by name , so called because they are shitty-looking . 
  but why does that have to make them literally ( well not completely literally ) shitty ? 
  ( same applies to irrational numbers ; they are irrational by name , so called because they are irrational-looking . 
  also because the greeks thought that their existence was actually irrational . 
  but why does that have to make them literally irrational ? ), 
  we ddos 'd newgrounds just by watching cascade . 
  in fact , newgrounds went down before anybody actually got to finish cascade ; i believe the figure was 6 minutes , as opposed to the thirteen and a half minutes cascade takes . 
  then hussie put it up on a few other sites and those crashed too . 
  also within the amount of time it actually takes to watch cascade . 
  pimp of bears !, 
  did you get that from me ? 
  ( i am so proud ), 
  i know , i know . 
  :p but ca n't we take a moment to appreciate how much potential this technology had ? 
  point . 
  although i do n't think bro ( post-scratch ; same as dave ) had access to artifact grist to make his inventions . 
   going into this subreddit is the first personal interaction i 've had with the fanbase, 
  thank god . 
  stay away from tumblr and 4chan . 
  this is very true . 
  one day i was like , `` wait holy hell we are actually big , and stupid , so much that there 's not a definitive list of particularly active members that i can keep track of '' . 
  then , `` aww , homestuck has grown up '' . 
  edit : and then `` aww shit , now we got ta deal with the rest of the world '' . 
  [ a pair of good introductions ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfgdfmxzl5y ) [ to the rest of the fanbase . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkbcpowxbb4&amp;feature=relmfu ), 
  [ cause i added `` bears '' as a joke aspect to this list just for humor . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/v7rj2/additional_classes_and_aspects/ ), 
  \\* eyeroll * fine , i concede about that particular example . 
  i wonder what else i can use . 
  english language 's full ` f 'em . 
  the one who made a pun ? 
  no but seriously . 
  research . 
  my case is from the * bottom * of the bargain bin . 
  dust ? 
  at least he was honest about it . 
  lol so randum amireti, 
  ... which 90 '' ?
