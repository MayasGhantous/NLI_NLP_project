  i was recently at a 90 '' that could be described as such . 
  the bok 90 '' / 2.3 m , at kitt peak near tuscon , az. 
  through which i saw ( but did n't take a picture of ) saturn . 
  it 's also the only 90 '' that i know of with an eyepiece . 
  eheheh . 
  whenever i take out a solar telescope , i somehow always fali to see such a great deal of sunspots . 
  exactly !, 
  who * are * you ? 
  edit : wait . 
  you even went to the lbt with us !, 
  who * are * you ? 
  you know why i was there , considering i mentioned the lbt as well ( in a different comment ) !, 
  how awkward . 
  ~ ~ ( i was looking for spectra on quasars ) ~ ~, 
  no , camper !, 
  have i found a camper or a counselor ? 
  edit : counselor by the looks of it . 
  hello !, 
  i 'm scrolling through , admiring the pretty art , and i suddenly run into my own work . 
  wtf . 
  anyway , how is # 7 honestuck-related ? 
  26 and 27 . 
  i 'm pretty ashamed of 26 . 
  however , i 'm also pretty proud of 27 . 
  it looks, 
  [ so ] ( / gg ), 
  [ cool ] ( / gg ), 
  edit : found out what the refrance for # 7 with google reverse image search . 
  it 's drawn by shelby cragg , who also does prints for what pumpkin . 
  edit 2 : in fact , as i suspected from the art style ( color highlighted noses and certain joints ) , she 's actually the one who does calliope 's art , and the one who did the cover art for the universe a and b albums . 
  bro ( post-scratch dave ) found a way to create 3d jpeg artifacts . 
  * and * , they were so cheap to make that their cost was negative , so he made tons of money off of producing them . 
  no fair , they made clip a sound exactly like it was written by a computer on purpose . 
  [ i mean like , the way i 'd think it is from experience . 
  ] ( http://tones.wolfram.com/generate/ ) they tend to have repeating parts , often scales . 
  [ like here 's one i made right now to illustrate my point . 
  ] ( http://tones.wolfram.com/gen/guea1bug2wot6sawg69dfw0qg2sxblm5ujmnsjqrzdf8 ) i thought they 'd build a better generator than c. ( i happened to know a , though , so i did n't pick it . ), 
  27 is the one in the green sun chrome theme !, 
  ( which i made !, 
  whee , thanks for using ! ), 
  the only thing that i 've ever used 26 for is my facebook timeline cover ( i wanted something unique ) , and i am looking to quickly replace it with a version of 27 . 
  ( i can crank out 27-like images really fast . 
  i could post a tutorial on that particular thing if you like . ), 
  dude , i 'm interested in what you did with that picture after i gave it to you . 
  apparently it 's popping up in `` like every homestuck wallpaper collection [ thatzeraguy has ] seen '' . 
  :p obviously i 'm not mad ; i 'm happy that so many people like it !, 
  i just want to find out [ where do you even get sick exposure like that . 
  exposure like that is unreal .

  edit : no wait never mind , i just gave you the theme . 
  you never got ahold of the actual image . 
  musta been dendrago who did it , then !, 
  \\ # 36 is from shelby cragg , the person who also does calliope 's art . 
  ( i think !, 
  do n't kill me if it is n't ! ), 
  ` fraid not . 
  ` k , we do n't know for sure . 
  but we 're very sure of the fact that * dirk * is n't ironic about his [ fetishes . 
  ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006368 ) the narration even [ shies ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006429 ) [ away ] ( http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=006431 ) from discussing it . 
  nowhere is it stated outright , but it 's a very , very obvious inference that you 're supposed to make . 
  / r/buildapc turns out good ones a lot . 
  why , thank you , sir . 
  the first time , it gave me a sort of error . 
  apparently reddit was lying about the comment not having been posted . 
  i shall now delete the other comment . 
  a2 was destroyed by green sun energy , though , not red miles . 
  go away you fucking faggot, 
  we ca n't have intellectual conversations around here with all these damn kids fucking everything up with their circlejerk . 
  * this . 
  ( redditors ' upvotes are like sex with women : you have to show confidence to get it . ), 
  that 's backwards , dumpass . 
  learn yourf fucking conversions . 
  ea is responsible for the death of everyone ever . 
  the secret to immortality is actually being kept from us by those greedy capitalist corportations . 
   if i had more time to play with , and did nothing but look at this garbage , i 'd probably make 50 or 60 alt accounts and control the content myself . 
  yes . 
  hell yes . 
  better , in terms of pissing off redditors ( not as opposed to stopping reposts , but this is still a brilliant idea ) : get a dedicated server . 
  it does n't need to be big ; just devoted . 
  even a raspberry pi will do , the cheapest computer in the world , at $ 15 . 
  install something like fedora on it . 
  or damn small linux , or * whatever * . 
  a lightweight , free operating system . 
  route the server through proxify , so ip banning is n't possible . 
  make 60 different reddit accounts , all with unique names and passwords . 
  write a script that downloads and formats data ( comment threads , specifically ) from all of the default subreddits , and saves the contents of comments , the karma of comments , the organization of comments , and the subreddit that said comment was posted in , as a csv file . 
  in this csv , the comments are organized as a gigantic tree , one for each subreddit : all of the top-level comments , organized from most karma ( on average ; duplicates are removed ) to least , with all of the second level replies to each of those comments as branches to those comments , organized also from most karma to least , etc. 
  do this for the past 30 days . 
  now create one bot that looks at comment threads on reddit default subreddits . 
  using these alts , it randomly posts top-level comments , and selectively posts replies to non-top-level comments , based on which comment in its database has the most karma , with some noise . 
  these replies will also be made to itself ; however , it will check whether the account that it 's posting to is exactly the same as the account that it 's trying to post with . 
  if it is n't , then it goes ahead . 
  it evolves by updating its database with which comments that it had posted gained the most karma , as well as scouring ( top-level ) replies to it for potential additions to its database . 
  it 's the perfect crime .
