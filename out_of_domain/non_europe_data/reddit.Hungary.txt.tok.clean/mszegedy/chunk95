  good job . 
  ( neither am i ; just / r/circlebroke . 
  take a look ; there 's a lot of good stuff on there to be angry about . 
  you would n't believe how stupid reddit users can be . ), 
  i find it funny how they transcribed the upsilon as a v , rather than a u. i wonder when the latin name of that stop was coined ; i 've never seen them do that before . 
  it would at least be tauros , if not taurus . 
  fuck your terrible grammar1 !, 
  place a torch ... 
  [ bo\u028al ], 
  dude , have you read act 5 or not ? 
  newton 's third law ? 
  or am i missing something here ? 
  what purpose does the water serve ? 
  it depends on the size of the subreddits you visit . 
  well , it is . 
  and his post history . 
  apparently all he does is visit large subs and become angry . 
  why are you here ? 
   i 'll also be immensely perplexed if you tell me you think i actually get angry writing these things . 
  you sure seem to put a lot of effort into disliking reddit for one who actually has no emotional motivation for doing so . 
  that 's not my point . 
  edit : is it too late to say that i was joking ... ? 
  just get a [ microcontroller ] ( http://raspberrypi.org ) , stick any old [ large , reliable hard drive ] ( http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?item=n82e16822136748 ) in it ( well , on it ) , give it a usb wireless adapter ( local radio shack ) , program an [ api ] ( http://linuxfromscratch.org ) for it , and you 're set . 
  damn , i never realized why the upvote/downvote buttons were the way they are now . 
  good call !, 
  no , nice people who are n't stupid . 
  i know . 
  i was using my imagination . 
  i do n't like how this topic has turned into `` what would you change about reddit '' , which was already discussed . 
  it 's `` if you could have the perfect reddit experience , what would it be like ? '' . 
  mine does n't include racism or sexism . 
  nothing much to the content itself ( besides the obvious `` lol building living spaces '' thing ) , but do n't you find it a bit ironic how there 's a homestuck fan walking around who devoted his life to that aspect of homestuck ( building ) ? 
  ** and religion . 
  fuck religion up in its circumcised ass . 
  he lets it slip at the very end . 
  hmm . 
  coming from a person who also mainly reads textbooks , are you sure you 're not just rationalizing feeling superior to those who insulted you , a.k.a. 
  `` butthurt '' ? 
  catch-22 ? 
  the reason i said `` feel superior '' was because it seemed like you felt your perspective was a broader and more intelligent one ; that is , you are a better person than those `` pretentious '' assholes . 
  but yeah i can definitely see that you 're mad . 
  or maybe it 'll start a sweden antijerk . 
  this . 
  ( literally . ), 
  how come ? 
  i do n't yell at people over the internet . 
  it 's pretty hard for me to get upset over anything at all . 
  ( i only pretend to do so in / r/circlejerk . 
  it 's fun . 
  i have an entire [ subreddit ] ( / r/karkat ) devoted to allcaps . ), 
  huh . 
  `` shoving it into place '' does n't do my method justice . 
  ah , an ibm thinkcentre !, 
  i have one of those ; it runs linux now . 
  ~ ~ did it crash newgrounds ? ~ ~, 
  but yes , i 'm starting to believe every person and every company has a huge , tangled pile of cables in a bin in their basement . 
  ( assuming they have a basement ; if not , then it 's usually in the attic . ), 
  i do it with water . 
  i run the water through some copper pipes that i tossed in a river next to my house . 
  how about you just do n't mention it at all . 
  it 's how the space between letters is dynamically adjusted depending on what two letters the space is between . 
  edit : sue me all you want , but i was on an iphone . 
  it 's impossible to discern this shit when the letters are so damn small . 
  i blame the iphone 's keming . 
  is it deliberate ? 
  i 'm not sure about that . 
  the letters would look pretty damn wibbly . 
  i think he means `` double '' sarcastic . 
  as in , the first layer is obvious -- it 's calling out the other person on being hypocritical about being superior , given that he 's ( assumedly ) only a year older . 
  however , what if the poster is being sarcastic about * that * statement ? 
  and that 's what was being asked . 
  = people upvote, 
  / r/spaceclop, 
  / r/pics , / r/funny , and / r/wtf are interchangeable . 
  . . why ? 
  all of the defaults . 
  what about / u/krugmanisapuppet ? 
  edit : dammit , what is his name ? 
  this link fails to work . 
  edit 2 : okay there it is . 
  is everyone on reddit suddenly a homestuck fan ? 
  probably because it 's such a stupid pun . 
  i could have sworn ; when i opened my inbox , do you know who replied to me in circlebroke ? 
  almostnever . 
  instant downvote . 
  a lot of things would work better , though . 
  like lava . 
  really ? 
  make the lava well two blocks deep . 
  the trap that i 'm actually trying to convey is : one block sand/gravel , one block tnt , one block air/one torch , one cobweb , two blocks lava , ground . 
  edit :, 
  [ ] ( / gravel ), 
  [ ] ( / tnt_side ), 
  [ ] ( / torch ), 
  [ ] ( / l_bucket ), 
  [ ] ( / stone ), 
  [ ] ( / stone ), 
  etc. . . 
  but it 's just from a few days ago ... 
  i stole it from the jerseystuck facebook group .
