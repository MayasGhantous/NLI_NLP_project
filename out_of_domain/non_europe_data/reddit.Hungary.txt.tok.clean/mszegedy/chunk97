  selection sort is kinda broken ( well , not broken , but unfairly biased ) on this one because it starts by sorting the myriad zero values . 
  they 'll mine the tnt straight out of it . 
  still better than bogosort . 
  and selection , and shell . 
  wow . 
  ( as a hungarian , i 'm entertained by this . ), 
  there 's worse things than / r/spacedicks . 
  look up the i 'm offended page of encyclopedia dramatica . 
  sure , blame the child for not buying a repair plan , and requesting support when he ran out warranty ( because a kid should carefully keep track of * all * his warranties !, 
  ) , and not knowing what the limitations of fixing hardware are . 
  you 're either seriously overestimating the kid 's age , or a massive dick . 
  the schwarzcrotum radius !, 
  guys . 
  first submission material . 
  right here . 
  unless you live in a country where they button the bottom button ? 
  wait , that 's an actual thing ? 
  i did n't see it on their website ( where i went to check the last time i saw it ) . 
  i want all that filling so desperately . 
  ahaha you assume i 'm not already a child, 
  i was assuming that epic was a noun , and together with `` belgariad '' it was an apposition ... 
  i think maybe his eyes look like shades ? 
  that would certainly be a [ shitty twist ] ( / uu ) . 
  really cool drawing ( i like the style and shading and everything !, 
  this sort of style is one of my favorites , anyone have a name for it ? 
  ) , but what 's that on john 's shirt ? 
  but dude . 
  i use a mac , but that much fucking money ? 
  the only upside is , theoretically , that you get to keep the warranty , but they never noticed * my * custom ram upgrade for the entire two-year duration of my applecare protection plan . 
  well , they probably noticed it , but were n't sadist enough to void my warranty on account of it . 
  well , then you would n't . 
  but cheap video cards exist for a reason , and it 's exactly that -- pc games not available on console . 
  does anything rival them laptop-wise ? 
  fuck he 's old , but that notwithstanding , i sort of love the posture you have here . 
  i am the opposite of an expert on drawing , but it seems pretty hard to draw !, 
  did you use a poseable mannequin or what ? 
  also , it 's a slick way to hide his hands , which i have a bit of an issue with because they are dough blobs . 
  i do n't know whether this would look consistent with the style , but he needs some detail on that . 
  finally , is he wearing socks , or are the shoes for four aces suited just that awkward to draw ? 
  as npc 's , it seems to be in our script to upvote this, 
  does no one here know how to use backslashes ? 
  watch :, 
  * \\ \\* \\ \\* becomes \\*\\*\\*, 
  * \\ \\* \\ \\* \\ \\* becomes \\*\\*\\* \\*, 
  * \\ \\* \\ \\* \\ \\* \\ \\* becomes \\*\\*\\* \\*\\*, 
  etc. . . 
  edit : the fuck ? 
  apparently , i do n't know how they work either . 
  it was worth a try !, 
  here 's a question . 
  what ? 
  i have been reading since problem sleuth was ending . 
  what i 'm saying is that we can blame the kid for actually dropping it into the water , but not any of the other things mentioned in this post :, 
   wow . 
  not buying a repair plan . 
  running out of warranty . 
  drops it in water . 
  it 's your fault !, 
  he is too young to know what a repair plan or warranty is , let alone buy one . 
  he is also too young to know that it 's impossible to fix it after it 's been dropped in water . 
  this commenter was acting like it 's the kid 's fault !, 
  yeah , but the breath symbol is different from what you drew . 
  yours looks more like if someone | | - alchemized the libra sign with an approximately-equal-to sign . 
  we are not getting into console vs. pc here . 
  exactly . 
  i think the kid meant that it was the tech 's fault that he could n't fix it , not that it was broken in the first place . 
  oh right i forgot to mention '' [ s ] make her pay . '' !, 
  but that was n't one of my favorite flashes at all anyway , and it took a while for `` crystamanthequins '' to grow on me before that . 
  the fact that i had heard the music before made the flash more tolerable , at least . 
  edit : aha !, 
  i think you have seen the logical inconsistency here . 
  if i had n't heard the albums before '' [ s ] john . 
  rise up . 
  '' , how could i have heard `` crystamanthequins '' before seeing '' [ s ] make her pay . '' ? 
  well , i have a friend who i like to hang out with sometimes , as friends often do . 
  he knew of the albums well before me ( and yet failed to mention their nature to me ) , and at one point he put on `` crystamanthequins '' , claiming it was `` homestuck music '' . 
  i thought he meant fanmusic , and i inquired no further . 
  he played it afterwards another time , too , but we were talking about something else at the moment , so the subject was n't even brought up . 
  ( then later he would actually introduce the albums to me . ), 
  why would they perform better on older cards just because they are part of a console ? 
  yeah , these tests are outdated . 
  : / i am making a much better electronic one that generates much , much more [ conplex ] ( / dunkass ) lands . 
  edit : dunkass 'd the typo . 
  ahahaha , the bad grammar pile does n't stop from getting taller . 
  dude , once a subreddit becomes shitty enough , subreddits dedicated to it pop up all over the goddamn place . 
  they 're like one of those super funguses that will grow anywhere under the sun , and spread at like a million miles per second . 
  subreddit critical shittiness is a very deadly line to cross . 
  you must not have been there during the primaries . 
  ron paul jerk was in full force . 
  i. . . where 's the other one ? 
  i ca n't look it up right now , but she says this to john while he 's wandering through a dark castle on skaia , the one in which his ( adoptive ) parents had been killed . 
  as you may imagine , it 's some ways before '' [ s ] seer : descend . '', 
  some are italicized . 
  spectra reveal chemical makeup . 
  i remember being obsessed with gliese 581g a few years ago . 
  i 'd love to point a spectrometer at that thing , just to get a look . 
  you sure about that ? 
  you should google both spellings , and see which returns more results . 
  the however many million it shows you is a complete lie ; you have to get a ways into them before it gives you an exact total . 
  this ... is n't even funny .
