  is it some wisdom , advising to live a `` more fulfilling self-actualizing life '' instead of a boring family life ? 
  or is it a warning against living in a given city because the bars are boring in the area ? 
  the translation depends on * many * things . 
  translation is not only about substituting words based on a dictionary . 
  depends on the person . 
  do you like art and museums ? 
  history ? 
  ( medieval ? 
  20th century ? ), 
  bars and pubs ? 
  hiking ? 
  but if you 're going for the default tourist checklist , then i 'd say, 
  * buda castle -  nice view of the danube , the bridges and landmarks from above, 
  * parliament ( at least the exterior , interior may take too long ) -  iconic building, 
  * heroes ' square ( and perhaps the city park nearby ) -  huge square with statues of historic heroes and a nice park, 
  * great market hall -  to buy some hungarian things or just to look around, 
  not sure how much you want to do in one day , this seems to fill a day already , depending on how fast you go . 
  i 'd say avoid v\u00e1ci street , lot of scams happening there with naive tourists ( very high restaurant bills etc ) . 
  it 's fine , but choose the restaurant beforehand ( inspect the menu ) . 
  some places may just have fried cheese from the freezer ( like if they are a specialized fish or beef restaurant or something ) . 
  in general , nothing to worry about . 
  what 's wrong with a salad ? 
  i 'd argue that things are not all beautiful . 
  i think current western culture tries to force us to put a positive spin on everything . 
  hungary is not really like this ( yet ? 
  ) , here complaining is not just accepted but expected . 
  if you ca n't list a lot of problems in your life that you 're going through , it 's assumed you 're either some masochist who enjoys their misery or you have no problems , which in turn means you 're probably rich from some shady business etc. 
  here people bond by telling stories of misfortune and empathizing ( and telling another one ) . 
  now i 'm not saying this is good or healthy , but it certainly enhances the contrast with american culture ( i do n't know much about australia ) , where everything must be `` awesome '' , and anything less than `` great '' ca n't be a topic of casual conversation , it kills the mood etc. 
  which makes people repress their own bad feelings and force them to wear an `` everything 's fine '' mask even when things are shit . 
  for example an old grandma in hungary would have no problem with finding a neighbor to complain about their back pain or how the doctor was rude last time , just getting these thoughts out of the head ( of course physical pain does n't go away , but the mental part can be reduced ) , but maybe in the us it would n't be socially acceptable to talk like that unless they know each other very well . 
  just as an example , take [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urwmao-mjtm ) ( she 's some mormon missionary , but that 's not the point ) . 
  i mean her whole enthusiasm comes off as fake to me , this kind of forced smile ... and again at 10 seconds ( `` i love learning about hungarian history '' ) you see this wide smile with the naive eyes , speaking in this `` oh the rich history of this cute little people , it 's so fascinating ! '' . 
  i mean , most of recent ( several centuries ) history is about oppression , bloody revolutions , lost wars and destruction . 
  there 's nothing about it that makes you smile and look with such baby eyes . 
  anyway , it 's just exactly how i would have imagined a stereotypical american talking . 
  it 's lightyears from the hungarian style . 
  we 're a lot more down-to-earth and straight-to-the-point . 
  for example around 0:45 she explains how older people were `` a little hesitant '' to talk to them and a `` little more closed off '' , well no , they just straight up rejected all the bullshit because they have real problems going on in their lives beyond choosing the theme of the restaurant where they 'll eat tonight ( and have no need for some rich and naive american to preach to them about jesus christ ) . 
  go and live a month in avas residential area of miskolc next to some big gypsy family and try to find beauty in that . 
  or live in a poor village and try to find the romantic ideal of poverty when you * actually * have no money at the end of the month and ca n't move forward in life and you 're stuck . 
  i mean , sure , some people are doing okay , i 'm just saying all this as a reaction to forced beauty-seeking . 
   belarusz does n't sound quite as right as a nation adjective . 
  that 's just because you 're not used to it . 
  why does * any * nation adjective sound better ? 
  there is no pattern to them . 
  also , jap\u00e1n ( japanese ) , francia ( french ) and portug\u00e1l ( portuguese ) already sound like the * county name * in many lanugages , so belarusz is perfectly fine for the nation adjective . 
  google things like `` belarusz nyelv '' ( belarusian language ) , `` belarusz emberek '' ( belarusian people ) , `` belarusz v\u00edzum '' ( belarusian visa ) , `` belaruszok '' ( belarusians ) etc. 
  for the country `` belaruszia '' or `` belarusszia '' are both okay for me . 
  but forced language change is a petty thing and mostly asked by countries with national identity and confidence issues and inferiority complex .

  would you say it is safe to blindly run across a street without looking left and right ? 
  in your terminology , it could be safe if there are no cars , we simply do n't know . 
  so safety and running blindly onto roads can coexist . 
  you may be safe , you just do n't know whether that 's the case ( by your logic ) . 
  or playing russian roulette may be safe as well . 
  if the bullet is not there , we just simply do n't know . 
  safety and russian roulette may therefore coexist ( by your logic ) . 
  i think this is n't how we use the word `` safety '' , nor `` privacy '' . 
  the two are very different and neither can be used in place of the other . 
  your dictionary is wrong or you did n't read it correctly .

  there 's no sharp distinction between action and occurrence and it 's certainly not marked in the actual grammar . 
  i know it is a distinction used in school books , but the actual hungarian language could n't care less whether you classify verbs as action or occurrence . 
  it 's simply a philosophical thing not a linguistic thing . 
  do you consider digesting , falling , getting lost , getting surprised , standing , living , yawning , sneezing , coughing etc. 
  actions or occurrences ? 
  it 's a philosophical debate . 
  grammatically they work the same way as singing , jumping , shooting etc. 
  they are conjugated the same way , used in the same way etc. 
  some very intelligent discussion :, 
  m\u00f3nika : thanks for coming . 
  oh , you look so hard on your son , why ? 
  mother ( gabriella ) : eh , nothing ... 
  m\u00f3nika : your partner will now say what he would like to start and help you with . 
  father : you two should make peace , you are angry all the time , this conflict is bad for your health . 
  mother : what did this filthy child say about me ?!, 
  what did you say , j\u00f3ska child , talk now !, 
  m\u00f3nika : he did n't say anything . 
  mother : me and your father beat you with baseball ( b\u00e9ldzb\u00f3z ) bats ? 
  son ( j\u00f3ska ) : i never said that . 
  mother : why ? 
  do n't lie you faggot , i 'll kick you !, 
  son : i did n't say such things . 
  mother : why did n't you say it ? 
  why did n't you say it ? 
  why did n't you say it ? 
  son : 'cause i did n't say it . 
  mother : you say your father beat you with a baseball bat and then you come to eat ( gobble ) at my place yesterday ? 
  m\u00f3nika : oh , gabriella , you literally loathe your son !, 
  how did this start ? 
  that racism is n't a relevant concept in eastern europe since we usually do n't have multiple `` races '' in our societies ( race is n't a clear concept anyway ) . 
  racism as a concept is strongly connected to slavery and the treatment of indigenous peoples in colonies . 
  we do n't have such history here in eastern ( central ) europe . 
  it was never a major topic whether black people are inferior or equal , since the topic was n't even relevant . 
  most people do n't think about it at all . 
  we in eastern europe do have a history of ethnic conflicts but they were n't about how people look or genetic superiority , but simply you know , `` tribal '' conflict .
