  there is also the hatred of roma ( gypsies ) in eastern europe , but i would n't say they are a `` race '' either , but they often recognizable by skin color . 
  still it 's not the same thing as the `` racism '' concept of the colonial powers and the us . 
  in hungary the argument is not so much that we are `` racially superior '' to the migrants , it 's simply that we live here and it 's our country and it was not built on the sweat and blood of exploited third worlders so we do n't feel the same guilt that we 'd have to compensate by taking in the migrants . 
  i wonder how much a `` typical '' american can understand and appreciate these kinds of hungarian movies . 
  i guess it would be confusing , boring or just weird to them . 
  but who knows ... 
  why is it pointless ? 
  the meaning of `` racism '' is pretty relevant if the question is `` is eastern europe really more racist than the west ? '' . 
  racism makes claims about the biological inferiority ( in intelligence , etc ) of some recognizable group of people . 
  if a nation does n't want foreigners from far-away lands to come to the land where they and their ancestors lived and worked , it 's nationalism , not racism . 
  it has nothing to do with the biological inferiority/superiority/equality of the others . 
  it 's a preference of the `` own tribe/nation '' as opposed to the other tribe/nation . 
  this does n't make it good , i 'm just saying that it 's not racism . 
  it 's not pointless because you submitted a link and its title asks whether eastern europe is really more racist than the west . 
  it 's entirely appropriate to ask what we mean by racist first . 
  does it simply mean `` distrust of different peoples '' ? 
  then why do n't they say `` is eastern europe really more distrusting towards foreign people than the west ? '' . 
  i know that race is n't a biological concept . 
  i said that racism regards certain groups of people as biologically inferior . 
  and i think that 's not the reason for the anti-muslim sentiment . 
  rather , it 's territorialism and a sense of ownership of the land . 
  the argument usually is that `` my ancestors worked for the prosperity of the country , these foreigners should n't come and reap its benefits '' or `` my ancestors gave their blood for the freedom of this country , we shall not give up ownership of it '' as opposed to `` these people are inferior , we should n't waste resources on them '' . 
  yeah , i 'm confused too , i just think this kapa-pepe stuff is very hard to translate and needs some knowledge of the hungarian realities . 
  it 's not like some hollywood love film that you can understand with little context . 
  not humanities and i myself hate definition debates too . 
  i only resorted to it because it 's a crucial point in answering the title question . 
  there 's a debate techbique called rationalist taboo where we forbid the use of a given word in case there is disagreement and try to phrase the actual debate without using that phrase . 
  so if we ca n't agree in the interpretation of the title , we can still debate a concrete question . 
  i do n't think vision express is expensive in general ( compared to others ) . 
  the price depends on how fancy frame you want and how advanced lenses ( extra layers , refractive index etc ) . 
  you should be able to get one for less than 80,000 ft if you do n't buy the best lenses and most fashionable and branded frame . 
  maybe because you are an english-speaking foreigner they automatically thought you are rich and do n't care about the price so they offered higher end glasses to you . 
  there are various kinds of lenses . 
  if you need very strong lenses they probably assumed you want it to be as thin as possible and offered one with a high refractive index , and probably also several protective layers . 
  did you ask them for multiple options or did you just go with whatever they suggested ? 
  did you ask `` is there anything cheaper , more basic ? '' . 
  of course they want to sell you the most expensive one . 
  and foreigners are usually rich , so there does n't need to be malice from their side . 
  my whole family has been buying glasses from vision express for perhaps more than a decade now and in my experience their prices are normal . 
  being an american does n't automatically mean you have $ 5000 extra available any time . 
  maybe this will motivate people to spend that holiday in hungary instead of florida , uk or whatever . 
  it 's been like this for a long time . 
  if you suddenly told people that they can drive after 1 or 2 beers they would drive even after 5 or 6 . 
  you need a certain culture to develop before it works . 
  [ here are two recolored versions ] ( https://imgur.com/a/dsog7 ), 
  it does n't destroy your life in the 0 limit countries , let 's not exaggerate . 
  in hungary if you are below 0.05 % , it 's only an offence ( `` szab\u00e1lys\u00e9rt\u00e9s '' , lit . 
  rule breaking ) , not a criminal offence ( `` b\u0171ncselekm\u00e9ny '' , lit . 
  criminal action ) . 
  you have to pay some money and you ca n't drive for 6-12 months , but that 's all . 
  why would this destroy your life ? 
  sure it wo n't be easy if you heavily rely on driving for your job , for example if you are a taxi driver or a bus driver , but then you should pay more attention to safe driving anyway . 
  but there 's also a practical minimum level for being fined , since the measuring methods are n't perfect . 
  eat such desserts when you do n't need to drive afterwards . 
  i never got into a situation where i was forced to eat desserts with alcohol . 
  in these countries you know you have to pay attention . 
  you hear it as a child from adult conversations . 
  the argument is : where should we stop ? 
  maybe johnny is fine after a beer , peter swears he can drive fine after a vodka , joe never had an issue even after a bottle of wine . 
  sorry driving is a dangerous business and not a basic human right . 
  if you ca n't accept these conditions you can use a taxi or a bus . 
  i prefer not to be on the road with people who 've been drinking . 
  i do n't care if it was `` just a glass of wine '' ( or two ) and you feel fine and you belong to the 90 % of people who describe themselves as above average drivers . 
  you just do n't drink before driving . 
  that 's our way in central and eastern europe . 
  if you ca n't understand such a simple idea , you 're not mature enough to drive . 
  except the question was `` any insight on why eastern europe is more conservative on the matter than the drunkies in the west ? '' ... 
  god , you become so defensive ... 
  i told you we do it this way because it would become a giant shitshow otherwise . 
  `` oh , drink one more , you can still drive , ca n't you ? 
  do n't be such a pussy ! '', 
  `` yeah , definitely i can drive after 3 beers , i 'm strong and manly ! '' . 
  anecdotally i 've seen how loosely italians and irish consider drunk driving . 
  when a guy says he 'll drive when you saw him drink 3 pints of guinness and ** nobody ** in the group says anything to try to stop him , it 's just ** natural ** . 
  or when the italian one did the same after 3 or 4 beers . 
  intelligent , responsible people can plan ahead and decide whether they want to drink or drive . 
  it causes inconvenience for the one-glass-of-wine-with-my-meal people , but it 's a good trade-off for being able to ban those assholes from driving . 
  if you do it multiple times you can even go to prison . 
  which is exactly what should happen . 
  you intentionally impair your reflexes and judgement , while driving a one ton vehicle on a road with other drivers , pedestrians , cyclists etc. 
  this means drinking a few beers is worth more for you than risking other people 's lives . 
  you also have to factor in that police checks are quite rare . 
  so for it to become a big enough risk , the punishment must be increased . 
  if you just do it once , you probably wo n't be caught . 
  therefore only the risk of a high enough punishment can potentially deter you . 
  and not only that . 
  it gives * you * protection from the assholes who try to push you . 
  you can say `` i do n't want to get fined and have my license taken away '' , which is reasonable even to the asshole who wants you to drink and drive . 
  it 's a much better defense than to say `` i 'm a responsible man '' , because that apparently makes you a pussy who ca n't drive . 
  this is our way , which the first comment asked about . 
  this is our reasoning . 
  you can downvote me for giving you the reason . 
  moving six-figure sums around and asking random strangers on an internet message board for advice ? 
  how about doing some actual research and not deciding based on whether the responding redditor hates prime minister orb\u00e1n or not . 
  maybe you should also ask for professional financial advice before moving a six-figure sum across the atlantic to a relatively unknown country for you ( as indicated by your questions ) . 
  seriously , how do people get so rich without having common sense ? 
  look up what a schelling point ( or focal point , in economy ) means . 
  `` no alcohol '' is a pretty easily understood rule . 
  otherwise one has to start calculating , use trial and error , hope for the best etc. 
  and why just one beer ?
