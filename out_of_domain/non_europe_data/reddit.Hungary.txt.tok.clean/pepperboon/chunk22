  you need to sort this out for yourself . 
  hungary is not the place for you . 
  go elsewhere until you are more sensible . 
  you seem to have some kind of romantic , ideal picture about hungary . 
  this is a country of normal people doing their thing . 
  it 's not some ideal place free of trouble , with people to serve rich foreigners ' every wish . 
  why do you want to come to hungary of all countries ? 
  also , what women are like is extremely subjective and depends on one 's own bubble/subculture . 
  you can best judge it by spending a few days here and seeing for yourself . 
  generally , you should spend a few days/weeks in your destination country before deciding to move there . 
  also , your iphone remark makes no sense as you described someone who would stereotypically definitely have an iphone : `` eat rich foods and drink good-but-cheap wine ; hike beautiful mountains ; have sex with beautiful women ; talk about radical , mystical , and beautiful ideas ; play and listen to innovative music ; do not go to sleep before midnight , and who do not accept any authority greater than themselves '', 
  this is the description of some spoiled rich kid totally detached from the hungarian reality , who would also definitely have an iphone . 
  very good !, 
   bucharest, 
  i do n't have more time for you . 
  people do n't realize that something that seems `` perfectly normal '' , `` common sense '' , `` implicit agreement '' is totally different than other people 's interpretation . 
  for me ( non-german ) it 's not common sense at all . 
  nudes should be the same category as love letters , naughty chat logs , kissing photos on the beach on holidays or any proof of affection . 
  you do n't get to destroy my memories of potentially several years of my life against my own will . 
  you are depicted in those images because you wanted to be , at the time . 
  there 's no `` undo '' button in real life , just because you changed your mind . 
  there are good and bad decisions that we make . 
  we share intimate secrets with the wrong people , we sometimes trust the wrong people . 
  but you ca n't revoke it . 
  decisions have consequences . 
  and ** to make clear ** , i 'm * not * talking about revenge porn or sharing photos with third parties . 
  * of course * that is and must be illegal !, 
  i 'm simply talking about * merely keeping * the photos , for own use . 
  maybe looking at them at a nostalgic lonely night . 
  it 's probably not the sign of a healthy love life to cling to nudes of an ex , but it should n't be illegal . 
  ** sharing ** them should be illegal !, 
  but not simply keeping them . 
  where do we draw the line ? 
  is kissing in bikini and shorts on the beach something i have to delete ? 
  or the picture where i grab her ass or breasts through clothing ? 
  maybe german common sense is unanimous on this question . 
  in that case , okay . 
  my sense of justice says that nobody can revoke a gift or sign of affection just because they changed their mind . 
  why is it a problem to you when your ex keeps your nude picture ? 
  do you want to control their fantasy , imagination and thoughts ? 
  do you want to forbid them looking at something you wanted to show them earlier ? 
  that 's tyranny in my book . 
  those photos are not in some dropbox or facebook where you still have control over them . 
  this same kind of thinking brought to us that amazon remotely deleted books from kindles . 
  relationships have consequences . 
  we open up to someone intimately and in the vast majority of the cases it ends in a few months or a few years . 
  this is the risk in love , that you open up to the wrong person and that you ca n't revoke it . 
  and again , i 'm not talking about sharing these photos further . 
  similarly to private love letters or naughty chat logs . 
  it is and should be illegal to * share * those as well , but keeping them should be legal . 
  a relationship ca n't be undone . 
  necessarily you grow together , both of you become a permanent part of who both of you become afterwards . 
  the experience , the little memories , good and bad , become building blocks of who you are . 
  it 's absurd to try to rewind things and undo things . 
  the person that is depicted in the image is a different person than you are now . 
  they obviously can not look at the current you naked . 
  but that person was someone they were in a relationship with . 
  maybe if they smell the perfume that you used to wear , they get reminded of you and all the fond moments . 
  maybe specific songs or movies will evoke memories of you two having sex with the specific feelings of how it looked and felt . 
  some people have really good and exact memory of touch , smell etc. 
  would you try to revoke these as well ? 
  after all , you only lent those feelings to them , they are not allowed to uplift their mood by remembering to that holiday trip since you would n't go to any such trip with them any more , so letting them `` use '' the past should be forbidden right ? 
  yeah , he seems to confuse the cities . 
  just to be clear :, 
  * belgrade = capital of serbia ( yugoslavia at the time ) , the place where the father had a job with the fishing company, 
  * budapest = capital of hungary , the family visited there for a weekend trip and this is where the story took place . 
  ny\u00edrpazony is a pretty small village . 
  you can see it in google street view . 
  this is north-eastern hungary , one of the poorest regions of the country . 
  there are few expats there . 
  few jobs too . 
  ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za is quite large , but it 's not a metropolis , also not really touristy . 
  it will probably be dull/boring/depressing for american expectations , depending on what you in particular expect . 
  there 's a college there , so perhaps some sort of nightlife , but i do n't know if you 're looking for that or what because you did n't ask any specific question . 
  you did n't say what you like , what you are looking for . 
  also , it will take you a long way if you pay attention to hungarian names ( of people and cities ) , there 's little excuse for messing up the names of the places even in the title . 
  hungarian is pretty hard , i know , but negligence in these things can come off as a bit arrogant , even if unintended . 
  i mean , the correct spelling is just one google search away . 
  budapest public transport is quite good compared to other cities . 
  it 's fashionable to hate on it , but actually it covers the city very well and the recent years have seen a lot of modernisation ( new vehicles : buses , trams , metros ; real-time traffic data displayed in bus stops , new ticket machines etc. ), 
  and cleanliness has improved a lot too . 
  your premise simply is n't true . 
  there 's plenty of non-sexual nudity on youtube . 
  also , there 's not a lot of gore and people dying . 
  torrent was and is still there for chilling . 
  * end of story *, 
   slovak interaction with islam for 1400 years, 
  do you even know any european history ? 
  1400 years ? 
  what did slovaks do with muslims in the 7th century ? 
  or 10th ? 
  or 12th ? 
  also , the ottoman empire did not extend to the area of today 's slovakia ( perhaps a tiny fraction ) and there also was n't a slovakia at the time , nor the concept of a slovak nation ( which has its origins in the 18-19th centuries ) . 
   i never said that all ~ ~ slovaks ~ ~ gypsies were ~ ~ racist ~ ~ thieves etc. 
  i pointed out that certain elements of their culture enable and encourage becoming thieves and arguing loud and leaving their neighborhood looking like shit , and that those dynamics make people try to move away from the areas where they live . 
  there was no slovakia at the time and hungarians inhabited areas further north than today . 
  no distinct slovak nation existed before the rise of the national movements in the 18-19th centuries . 
  there were slavs living up the carpathians who gradually moved further south as hungary depopulated in the ottoman wars . 
  the national movements then fueled separatism in the minorities of the habsburg empire , hungarians wanted independence from austria , slovaks and transylvanian romanians from hungary . 
  hungary got a deal with austria in 1867 , but this did not give special rights to slovaks , and hungary tried to homogenize the kingdom , which eventually lead to the dismantlement of the kingdom in trianon after world war i.
