  and people say `` math has no use outside school '' . 
  look at the edit of my previous comment and see for yourself . 
  [ here ] ( https://imgur.com/vodirpd ) is mine . 
  great map maker . 
  [ here ] ( https://imgur.com/z8bqgns ) is my voronoi map of world regions , according to me . 
  my home happens to be the center of europe , by the way . 
  iceland is a pretty warm country considering its location . 
  it 's warmer in the winter than central europe . 
  polar bears are n't native in iceland . 
  the name is misleading , iceland is pretty green and nice , it 's not covered in ice . 
  there is a lot of geothermal activity which makes it so warm ( and the gulf stream too ) . 
   except , to the average american christian , they are exclusive . 
  many atheists think the same . 
  ( that the two are exclusive ) . 
  it 's not a clear-cut thing . 
  share a coke with your diabetes . 
  it can be useful late at night . 
  or simply if you have the money and want to get to places more quickly . 
  it 's not just a hungarian thing . 
  all over central/eastern europe you have the same thing . 
  but in hungary there is this perception that everything is specifically shit in hungary . 
  that hungarians are bad , they are racists , they do n't cooperate , they want everything done for them by the state , they are sheeple etc. 
  at least in other countries people think this about humanity in general . 
  but here in hungary , people like you think it 's just hungary and the glorious `` k\u00fclf\u00f6ld '' ( foreign countries ) is so much better , politicians are not corrupt , everything is modern , buses are n't late , people are nice and even their shit smells like roses , but you ca n't do anything with these shitty backwards stupid hungarians . 
  they are unusable , they are collectively damned forever . 
  you know , the leftist elite would bring us to a utopia , but * this * pesky nation wo n't let it . 
  this sort of self-hate is rather rare in other countries . 
  when i meet foreigners , most of the time they are proud about their countries , they like to talk about it , even when it 's crap . 
  but hungarians ( of that political side ) are like `` ah , we 're shit , there 's nothing worth knowing about us '' . 
  they are ashamed to be hungarian . 
  these are of course people who do n't understand anything about the life of `` everyday '' hungarians , who have to live in gyspy neighborhoods . 
  the easiest thing is to say `` they are all racists , there is no problem at all , it 's just imagined , we just need to cure their racism , and everything will be fine '' . 
  but they send their kids to elite schools in buda , never to rural ones full of gypsies ... 
  and the other side blames everything on orb\u00e1n and the `` fascists '' . 
  is that so much better ? 
  do you think they are so self-critical ? 
  that sounds really nice in the abstract , but now you 're just pointing your finger at `` the nation '' . 
  or are you admitting that * you * fucked up ? 
  `` hey , look , that guy there ( * points finger * ) should n't be pointing his finger at others !, 
  he should point it at himself ! '', 
  i think the only way to move forward is to try to understand the economic and social processes and systems , the history etc , without emotionally having to blame it on people ( even when that is the `` majority population '' ) . 
  i mean , if you think people are racists , you could ask * why * they became racists . 
  but it 's not an answer to say `` well , it 's in their pesky hungarian nature , they are simply such dumb shit haters '' . 
  he liked to use words like `` in '' , `` of '' , `` at '' . 
  if american moms are the way they are in movies , i can understand that . 
  valentine 's day is not such a big deal over here . 
  although they are trying to push it for commercial reasons ( shopping centers and the like ) . 
  but once people use this method to decide if they want to be friends with you , it starts to actually benefit you to treat third parties well . 
  hungary here . 
  we 're experts in high vat : 27 %, 
  i 'm not sure about its origins either . 
  but i suspect it goes back a looong time , probably to the times of the monarchy , perhaps even earlier . 
  to one side , everything that 's hungarian , stinks . 
  hungary is just disgusting p\u00f6rk\u00f6ltszaft , fake culture , overblown history that 's just legends and did n't actually happen , every hero is actually blown out of proportion , we should just learn to be a tiny nation with no significance etc. 
  actually , even as kids we got this from everywhere . 
  `` magyar '' as a negative word , like `` magyar min\u0151s\u00e9g '' ( `` hungarian quality '' ) ironically meaning shit quality , or `` magyar mentalit\u00e1s '' meaning whatever mentality the particular person thinks is bad ( opposing sides often use it for precisely the other side 's mentality ) . 
  it 's usually either people who have no idea about how things work in other countries so they over-idealize them , and think that everything negative just happens in hungary , or they know how things are in other countries but they want to get rid of their eastern european post-commie identity and want to feel mentally closer to new york , san francisco , berlin , london , paris etc. 
  and hungary seems too ridiculous there . 
  index and 444 are usually like this . 
  but it 's really widespread , it 's not just the leftists actually . 
  many times people will say this about, 
  * bad/slow/dirty buses , trains, 
  * tv shows , tv dubs, 
  * traffic jams, 
  * taxi drivers, 
  * gypsies / racists, 
  almost anything . 
  today i read an article where the issues in science funding and quality controlling was also blamed on * specifically hungary * , because of the hungarian mentality , when actually it 's a global problem and many smart people are trying to work on solutions . 
  but no , to these people it 's specifically a hungarian problem that could literally never happen in foreign countries . 
  or say , [ this news about david bowie 's last album getting on the top lists around the world ] ( http://index.hu/mindekozben/poszt/2016/01/17/david_bowie_utolso_lemeze_letarolta_a_vilag_albumeladasi_listait_nalunk_a_top_10-be_se_fert_bele/ ) disappointedly implying how uncultured hungarians are for not following this world trend . 
  but actually we have no information about romania , greece , ukraine , poland , and tons of more countries . 
  but again , something must be specifically fucked up about hungary because we are n't like the us or western europe in this . 
  well , is it such a sin that there were n't as many bowie fans in hungary as in , say , france ? 
  i just really hate these cynical remarks . 
  or when people complain how some so huge social platform is not used in hungary or how most people have n't heard of twitch or whatever service . 
  and then these journalists have to push this in their face like `` see what a peasant you are , stinky hungarian ?!, 
  the cultured west watches netflix and uses twitter and watches e-sports but you ... '' it 's similar to when the first mcdonald 's opened in budapest and people had to rush in and feel the atmosphere of the west . 
  now when trendy people watch netflix , it 's like a breeze of development , finally leaving beyond this `` shit country '' . 
  when asked what is their national pastime , people from other countries often say it 's `` complaining '' , but it 's usually a much nicer complaining , about the weather or i do n't know , but not this stinging self-hate and pessimism . 
  another thing may be that we feel close and have this burning desire to catch up to western europe , to be accepted there , since centuries . 
  and we compare ourselves to them all the time . 
  maybe as long as austria is this much ahead of us , we ca n't be content with what we have . 
  it 's no consolation that romania and bulgaria have it even worse , they are not in our club in our minds . 
  it also often reminds me how our class would often get bashed by teachers as `` the worst-behaving class '' they taught and how the others are so much better ( in a serious and strict voice ) . 
  only later did i learn that they said this to some other classes as well . 
  when i hear that the international community bashes us as being the especially racists/xenophobes , i like to remind myself how they say this about so many other nations as well . 
  we are also in a geographical position of many peoples meeting . 
  so there are many peoples we can hate . 
  i mean in scandinavia , there are friendly bickerings between sweden , norway and denmark , but basically that 's it . 
  before the muslims came , there was no significant population to have conflicts with there . 
  but in hungary we had the turks here , we had the austrians rule above us , we had the romanians in transylvania , the slovaks in the north , the gypsies all over , a huge population of jews compared to other countries , trianon , communists , fascists , soviet occupation etc. 
  everyone had to choose sides , there were constants political divides . 
  some people would even like to take it as far back as the battle of moh\u00e1cs , the choice between king ferdinand i and john szapolyai . 
  or between stephen i or kopp\u00e1ny in the 10th century . 
  i just hope that as we learn more about other countries , we will realize that there is n't that big of a difference . 
  trains are late in germany too , and people are angry , but they do n't say `` oh this shit germany ... '' , the metro in paris looks like shit , many parts of brussels look worse than the presumed ghetto of budapest , the 8th district . 
  of course we also should n't fall over to the other side and glorify everything that 's hungarian . 
  i could sometimes puke from this bragging that `` we invented this and we invented that '' . 
  we did have several famous scientists and famous athletes , but somehow we like to fixate on these few extraordinary people and idolize them too much .
