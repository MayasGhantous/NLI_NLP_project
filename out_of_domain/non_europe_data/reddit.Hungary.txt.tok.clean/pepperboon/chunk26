  we also take things like the eurovision contest too seriously . 
  like a constant inferiority complex . 
  most countries wo n't care much if a us scientist went there from hungary or , say , croatia or poland . 
  it may warm our hearts if they get a nobel prize , but for others it really does n't matter . 
  what would really matter is to have a more optimistic and trustful society where we do n't always suspect each other of high treason , the second they something we do n't agree with . 
  our neighbors , like romania and slovakia like to imagine average hungarians as these very proud nationalists who think hungary is the best and greatest . 
  but these thoughts usually only appear in the abstract , usually concerning the past . 
  in the actual present , most people think hungary specifically is crap . 
  exactly . 
  most people who killed people in wwii are either dead or like 100 years old . 
  how can people use collective guilt against the former axis countries ' population , when the exact problem of genocides like the holocaust and ethnic cleansings was that they were based on collective guilt ... how can they put these together in their minds , i ca n't comprehend .

  people have answered your question multiple times . 
  it seems like you ask until you get your desired answer . 
  no , in germany for german users the . de is standard and . com looks unusual in this context ( it implies an international , mostly american company ) . 
  think of another name where the . de is available . 
  no , in this thread the pattern is : you get an answer and you reply to it , asking the question again , then you get the same answer again , and then you ask it again . 
  it looks like you already decided to go with the . com and you 're just trying to find a confirming external opinion . 
  sure . 
  but you replied to the same person , trying to get a different opinion out of them . 
  if you do n't think their answer is insightful/useful/clear then downvote and wait for better answers . 
  also it depends a lot on the type of the site . 
  for many sites the tld really does n't matter . 
  if your site 's main attractive feature is its domain , it 's a red flag for me . 
  it 's usually the kind of scammy , let 's get rich without work , type of businesses . 
  very difficult to understand the text . 
  i even tried to lip-read it from [ this concert video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03t73zr9k34&amp;t=58m57s ) but it 's still difficult . 
  this is the best i can do , hopefully others can fill in the blanks . 
  light breaks into the deep , light breaks on the sky ,, 
  in little bird 's heart beats [ ??? ], 
  wake up , mother earth , in your black [ ??? ], 
  to opening spring lives a [ ??? ], 
  under winter blanket [ ??? ], 
  wake up , mother earth ... ( x2 ), 
  light breaks into the deep , light breaks on the sky ,, 
  in little bird 's heart beats [ ??? ], 
  wake up , mother earth ... ( x2 ), 
  the disappeared world is coming back, 
  from death through the shadow, 
  is waking up already, 
  on the altar of opening buds . 
  yeah it 's a nice song . 
  if you * really * want it , you could buy their album , as it comes with [ a booklet ] ( http://en.prophecy.de/out/pictures/onthefly/oxarticle/normal/x700/2/themoonandthenightspirit-holdrejtek.jpg ) , which probably contains the lyrics , maybe even some kind of artistic translation ( for example the song title on the back cover was translated as `` on the altar of blooming buds '' instead of the literal `` spring-bringer '' ) . 
  so if you buy it and type in the hungarian text , i 'm sure someone will help translate it . 
   kapisk\u00e1l, 
  i also say it as `` kapizsg\u00e1l '' , apparently it should be written as `` kapisk\u00e1l '' according to the academia rules . 
  it comes from italian . 
  i feel it 's a bit old slangish word . 
  it was informal / `` slang '' a few decades ago , i think . 
  it 's not unheard today , just not the newest slang . 
  i personally do n't use it , but it 's definitely not used in formal language . 
  both are used , it probably depends on the region . 
  i 'd say furcsa is perhaps more standard , but maybe i 'm just biased , as i use that variant . 
  krumpli is rather informal , burgonya is very formal . 
  has\u00e1bburgonya = french fries ; s\u00fclt burgonya can be several things , like [ baked potatoes ] ( http://aprosef.hu/sites/default/files/styles/mainphoto_870x468/public/mainphotos/2015/img_5772_atmeretezve.jpg?itok=mwzvyzxe ) but `` s\u00fclt krumpli '' is often just a simpler synonym for french fries . 
  by the way , both `` fry '' and `` bake '' translate to `` s\u00fct '' in hungarian . 
  i do n't know `` r\u00f3sejbni '' . 
  `` szalmakrumpli '' is a regional word for french fries , if i 'm not mistaken it 's an eastern dialect , perhaps transylvanian . 
  i 've never heard `` bat\u00e1tasz '' but it looks like spanish patatas , meaning potatoes . 
   but if you say say young people do n't use it then i will avoid using it . 
  it comes up sometimes as `` kezdi kapizsg\u00e1lni '' ( `` is starting to understand '' ) . 
  but generally for `` understand '' , `` v\u00e1g '' is a more modern slang word since some years ( it kinda means a mix between know and understand ) . 
  i 'd say it 's regional ( or depends on the community ) . 
  i learned it as `` furcsa '' as a kid , and it sounded dialectal to me when i heard `` fura '' . 
  so i would n't say `` everyone omits the ` cs ' in speech '' because i do n't . 
  it was originally `` keni-v\u00e1gja '' ( lit . 
  `` he smears & cuts it '' ) in the 80s slang , meaning that he knows how to do something expertly , effortlessly . 
  it was used for specific topics , specific skills . 
  then it was reduced to just `` v\u00e1gja '' , meaning the same , but slowly it came to mean simply `` know '' as well , like to know a particular fact , not just a topic or skill . 
  some people really overuse it , and put `` v\u00e1god ? '', 
  at the end of every sentence , like `` namsayn ? '', 
  in english . 
  it 's mostly just paperwork , contracts , eulas , privacy policies etc. 
  actual technical checks are very difficult and need really really great expertise and a lot of time from auditors . 
  and still it 's probably too difficult to check even for top experts , if the company wants to hide their nasty stuff . 
  yeah , and can you believe that they * could n't * transfer the data out of those data centers secretly to the nsa ? 
  it 's all ridiculous and just paperwork . 
  you 're both talking beside each other . 
  answer this :, 
  will i ( eu citizen ) still be able to sign up for dropbox ? 
  what if the service company has no special eu division , no company in ireland or luxemburg or switzerland , they simply host a service where you can sign up with an email and password . 
  can i still use those or will those companies have to check if i 'm from the eu ( by ip , checkbox , address etc. ), 
  and deny the service if so ? 
  being physically in the eu does not mean too much . 
  the nsa could still take the data , using technical backdoors or secret data requests , if the company cooperates . 
  what does it even mean to `` operate within the eu '' , if they do n't have a special eu daughter company ? 
  they simply allow global access to their website ( better said : they do n't block any country specifically ) and do n't ask whether you 're from the eu or not . 
  usually when a company grows big , they start to expand and have local divisions/localized sites for european countries ( including buying local domains , displaying prices in local currencies etc. ) . 
  but many companies do n't specifically target eu countries this way . 
  yes , microsoft , apple , google , amazon , etc. 
  are clear cases , but there are many smaller companies that do n't localize this way . 
  they just do n't explicitly block eu customers , but they also do n't really `` target '' them . 
  this is the main question . 
  does it only count if you specifically target them , or also if you just accept them , i.e. 
  do n't explicitly block their ips etc. 
  actually hungary consistently has many olympic medals , even at the post-1990 olympics . 
  we were ranked at place 8 , 12 , 13 , 13 , 21 , 9 in terms of number of medals , while we 're 89th by population and 58th by nominal gdp ( 57th by gdp ppp , 54th by gdp per capita ) . 
  it may or may not be something to be proud about , that depends on your political and social philosophy , but the facts are there . 
   2 ) hungary has one of the highest number of athletes who have been caught doping .
