  our maps in school in hungary used a projection called [ baranyi 's fourth projection ] ( http://users.atw.hu/rakkgyu/kep/047.gif ) created by a hungarian guy . 
  not sure about its properties , but it looks nice . 
  they applied for asylum because they were captured/registered by the police . 
  but then they left as soon as they could . 
  asylum seekers are n't kept locked up while their case is being processed . 
  so they all left , because they did n't actually want asylum in hungary , they just applied for it because they had no better option . 
  but today all but a few dozen/hundred of them remain in hungary , the vast majority of them is now in germany or sweden , getting their asylum there ( or not ) . 
  b\u0171nbanda .

  also , do n't tell hungarians that you 're `` broke '' if you 're actually rich by hungarian standards ( salaries around 400-500 $ / month after taxes are pretty normal here ) . 
  i understand you did n't mean it in a bad way , just be aware that rich/poor/broke have different meanings in each country/city . 
  search this sub and / r/hungary, 
  as a non-american who has does n't know what they are talking about , sanders interrupts her very often , too . 
  spelling : it 's ny\u00edr ... not nyri ... , nor nryi ... 
  the hungarian ny is like the spanish \u00f1 . 
  you do n't even put in the effort to spell your question properly ( `` im '' , `` i '' , `` europe '' , `` european '' ) , but you expect us to write essays on such a deeply complex , controversial and vague topic ? 
  not all languages/countries have an abc-song . 
   also not being able to turn right on red really sucked . 
  because in europe red is red . 
  you must stop . 
  but !, 
  when we want to allow turning right all the time , [ we do it like this in budapest ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@47.4997711,19.1085444,3a,75y,358.09h,81.02t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sxespjf4hwwa_0otoudxgxg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  the traffic lights only apply to the lanes towards the left of ( or under ) them . 
  [ another example ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@47.4555816,19.0462489,3a,75y,203.98h,81.92t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1snywivj2w1g9e-xa8km78iq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  so the same idea exists , we just designate it more explicitly . 
   spain - pharmacies are just pharmacies , not all-in-one convenience stores like walgreens . 
  took me forever to find someplace to buy batteries . 
  i think this is pretty normal in most places . 
  i 'd say it 's rather a ` murican thing to build a big-ass commercial center out of something like a pharmacy . 
  for example hungarian pharmacies are quite small , they often look [ like this from the outside ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/nepkertipatika01.jpg ) and [ like this from the inside ] ( http://www.mypin.hu/index.php?view=image&amp;format=raw&amp;type=img&amp;id=62&amp;option=com_joomgallery&amp;itemid=6 ) . 
  how are they supposed to clean it without money ? 
  do you know how the non-paying toilets look like ? 
  ( there are some in eastern europe ... ) yeah , not for american eyes . 
  it 's a good indicator of health and diet problems . 
  also , it 's natural . 
  denying nature , a fear of nudity , fear of feces , fear of sex , denial of death , wanting everything to be pure , pink , fluffy , happy etc. 
  is stereotypically american . 
   i slept on a smelly straw mattress in a house that only had an outhouse . 
  haha , hungarian here . 
  yes , in 1989 villages mostly did n't have inside bathrooms . 
  but it really changed after a few years . 
  nowadays basically everyone has a bathroom , even in villages . 
  we also did n't have a phone ( not a cell phone , but a regular phone ) until around 1995 , and we lived in the capital !, 
  i also never had a gameboy as a kid ( my childhood was in the 90s ) , only a tetris clone , but a few richer guys had it . 
  it was always a big deal when going to bus trips and everyone envied the kid who had it and we played it after each other . 
   you had to pay to use a grocery cart . 
  i think you misunderstood this . 
  it 's just a `` deposit '' , you put a euro coin in the cart , so you can take it out , and you get it back when you take it back . 
  if you 're a lazy ass and leave the cart near your car 's parking space , then you lose the euro coin . 
  it 's just to discourage leaving the carts all over the place . 
   american kids would have just fought over it or something and the hungarian ones just calmly took turns without any fuss, 
  i think if there are at least 3 kids , then they all get angry if one plays longer than what was agreed . 
  it 's not good to be seen as a `` selfish kid '' because then you are n't socially accepted by the group . 
  usually the kid who owned the thing basically ( almost ) could n't play during the trip as the group consensus was `` you can play this anytime at home '' :d, 
  i think it 's just confusing to drive through a crossing when the lights are red . 
  our solution seems more straightforward ( see the links above ) . 
  there are better , more explicit ways :, 
  * [ extra green arrow to the right ] ( http://112press.hu/images/images/2048x2048/1837131078561d16c3a8348.jpg ), 
  * [ extra turning lane where there are no lights , just a yield or a stop sign ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@47.4997711,19.1085444,3a,75y,358.09h,81.02t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sxespjf4hwwa_0otoudxgxg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  okay , i have n't seen paid toilets at a mall in hungary or germany either . 
  because they have revenue on their own . 
  i was talking about simple public city-owned toilets outside , not the ones belonging to a mall/restaurant etc. 
  [ example of what i mean ] ( http://budapestcity.org/13-album/images/wc/petofi-ter.jpg ) , [ example 2 ] ( http://budapestcity.org/13-album/images/wc/moricz-zsigmond-ter.jpg ) . 
  wtf ????? 
  :d :d, 
  i like it , for the weirdness factor . 
  it usually happens after irregular sleep patterns , especially when sleeping in the afternoon , at daylight . 
  i also enjoy lucid dreams etc. 
  i never see monsters or such . 
  just the fact that i ca n't move . 
  vision is somewhat weird , but it 's never an actual figure sitting beside me or like that . 
  it feels more like i 'm not sure if this is part of the dream or not . 
  both get mixed into one picture , like the background and foreground . 
  the first time i did n't open my eyes and it felt more like `` oh , i 'm probably just too lazy to move '' etc. 
  i did n't freak out somehow . 
  then i looked it up , and saw all these demon stories and it did n't make sense to me personally . 
  but generally i never have real nightmares either . 
  the monsters/chasers that do come up are usually not that terrifying . 
  so yeah , probably i do n't understand what it is like to have this kind of terrifying experience . 
  you should use a globe more often . 
  really , without sarcasm , it 's fun . 
  ( google earth will also do , but i think a physical globe has it 's place too ), 
  [ chronicon pictum in pdf ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20120304111134/http://konyv-e.hu/pdf/chronica_picta.pdf ), 
  not really , in my opinion . 
  many jews hungarianized their last names around a century ago ( + / - a few decades ), 
  you forgot to include the link . 
  there 's no policing needed . 
  in hungary and germany they are always reserved . 
  row and seat are printed on the ticket , and you can pick where you want to sit ( out of the free places ) when you buy it . 
  people know this system and i 've never seen anybody who 'd take someone else 's place and then refuse to move . 
  there are glowing numbers showing which row is which and the seats are visibly numbered as well , so everyone just finds their place and that 's it . 
  there 's no extra employee enforcing stuff , just the usual ticket controller at the entrance . 
  people grow up with this system and it 's really never an issue . 
  traditionally , meat is an important part and eating without meat was a sign of poverty . 
  but even meatless foods often include dairy products , such as milk , sour cream ( tejf\u00f6l ) , cottage cheese ( t\u00far\u00f3 ) or nokedli ( dumplings or sp\u00e4tzle , includes eggs ) . 
  i think there is no vegan-by-default traditional hungarian food . 
  you can modify the recipes , of course , but they wo n't be traditional . 
  even lecs\u00f3 is usually made with fat , but you can use sunflower oil instead or something . 
  by the way , most traditional hungarians would see the idea of veganism quite fussy and stupid , a kind of `` he has no real problems so he has to make up some bullshit like this to spend his time on '' thing . 
  emphasis is on the first syllable , but the second syllable is long .
