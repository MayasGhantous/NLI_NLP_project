  this is again something very typical of philosophy - getting caught up on terms and trying to manufacture some substantive content by playing around with how to name things . 
  i mean , you imply that you caught them in some contradiction or a sort of liar 's paradox , because they said philosophy is not the right tool , but the claim itself is philosophy . 
  i suggest that you should rather try to understand what that person could have meant . 
  what thing did they mean under philosophy ? 
  by using a more generous interpretation , you could perhaps point out that you think it 's a too generic term and suggest some other term , probably some '' ... - ism '' that they might actually have in mind when they make this criticism . 
  for many people ( especially those involved in science ) , philosophy conjures up the image of someone sitting in a chair , stroking their chin and writing down stuff like `` necessarily x , because y would imply z , but that obviously ca n't be '' . 
  the structure of the argument often follows a very formal and strict format , which is nice , but the content is mostly just pulled out of thin air . 
  almost always when i read philosophy , i stop after every half sentence and say `` wait a minute , why would y imply z , there could be some alternatives '' or `` slow down , i can think of an alternative to both x and y , so the argument does n't stand '' . 
  the arguments are usually just like bouncy castles full of air . 
  often it results in something that follows a required logical format , and then the author asks doubters of the conclusion to point out which of the assumptions was wrong . 
  but very often it 's not just one , but rather that all are kinda murky and instead of being true or false they are rather `` meh ... '' , `` i guess perhaps , but not really '' , or `` why would you say that '' or `` what do you even mean by that ? '', 
  this kind of philosophizing is what the empirically directed people have problems with . 
  there does need to be an element of philosophy , reflection , structured argument etc. , but the central and most important piece has to be the empirical result , the actual data . 
  yes , you still need to interpret the research findings , but at least you have something to work on , you are n't just conjuring up ideas by sitting in your armchair formulating thin-air-laws . 
  for example a philosopher may reasonably say `` one thing is necessarily located at one definite point in space , because things at multiple locations are distinct things that can be differentiated by their location and are therefore not the same thing '' . 
  sounds very nice , but reality does n't seem to conform to this because in the realm of the tiny , things are n't located at one definite place but must be modeled as being distributed over a large region of space . 
  you could never have guessed that and reality is just so different from the armchair-argument that you ca n't even really pinpoint where the argument went wrong , the problem was simply that our intuitions and the whole framing of the issue was far away from how nature really is . 
  so the argument is n't against thinking about methodologies , but rather against empty ( and arguably lazy ) philosophical musings . 
  right . 
  when you fall while riding your bike and your leg is bleeding and you 're in pain , we can say that you 're experiencing the wound or injuredness of your leg . 
  but you 're not experiencing pain , because `` pain '' is already a name for a kind of experience . 
  but if you get painkillers then you wo n't experience the injuredness of the leg anymore , but it 's still there . 
  however , the pain is not there . 
  this is a linguistic issue . 
  just as people sometimes say `` cheap prices '' ( at least in some languages , i 'm not a native english speaker ) , when meaning `` low prices '' . 
  they conflate `` cheap product '' with `` low price '' . 
  just as the price is not cheap , the pain is n't experienced . 
  [ this is the area covered ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/tabula_hungariae_orientation.jpg ), 
  more info [ at wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tabula_hungariae ) . 
  first , hungarian is one of the many languages with `` negative concord '' , meaning that negatives must be repeated . 
  for example `` soha senki nem eszik semmit '' = literally `` never nobody does n't eat nothing '' , meaning `` nobody eats anything ever '' . 
  in english , you have only one negative word , in hungarian all negatable words are negated . 
  second , to reduce confusion , `` sem '' and `` se '' are the same in a declarative sentence , but `` se '' is a bit colloquial . 
  in imperative sentences only `` se '' is possible . 
  now , `` anna nem l\u00e1tott egy di\u00e1kot se '' is like `` anna did n't see one student not even '' , and means `` anna did n't even see one student '' . 
  but languages do n't map nicely one-to-one , in hungarian we like to use `` se '' more often than you 'd use `` even '' in english . 
  in english , you 'd probably just emphasize `` anna did n't see * one * student '' stronger if you wanted to express the same . 
  you can think of `` sem '' as `` is nem '' . 
  `` is '' is a strange little word in hungarian , it 's something like `` also , too , even '' , but it 's not used exactly as in english . 
  in hungarian , `` sem '' ( not even , neither ) and `` is '' ( too , also , even ) appear * after * the phrase that it refers to . 
  so `` not even once '' is `` egyszer sem '' . 
  the english `` either '' does n't precisely show what it refers to . 
  take `` i did n't see him either '' . 
  here `` either '' could refer to `` i '' or `` him '' . 
  it could mean that other people also have n't seen him , or that i did n't see other people as well . 
  try to say it with and without stressing `` him '' to hear the difference . 
  in hungarian , the difference is clear '' \u00c9n sem l\u00e1ttam \u0151t '' = '' * i * have n't seen him either '' ( similarly to other people who have n't seen him ) ; '' ( \u00c9n ) \u0151t se l\u00e1ttam '' or '' \u00c9n nem l\u00e1ttam \u0151t sem '' = `` i have n't seen * him * either '' ( similarly to other people whom i have n't seen ) . 
  now let 's take, 
  these mean the same thing apart from some very very slight emphasis difference due to the word order . 
  hungarian word order is `` topic , focus , verb , rest '' . 
  it works like this in these sentences :, 
  so simply , '' \u0151t sem '' has been pulled into focus . 
  the only question is , why is n't it '' ( \u00c9n ) \u0151t sem nem l\u00e1ttam '' . 
  the answer is simply , because the `` sem '' and `` nem '' directly after one another does n't work in this case , it simply becomes `` sem '' . 
  if there was something in between , then it would be different . 
  like '' \u0150t sem - megmondom \u0151szint\u00e9n - nem l\u00e1ttam '' = `` him neither - i 'm telling you honestly - i did n't see '' . 
  in some cases `` sem nem '' is possible though , but only in neither - nor pairs , for example , in the news title `` se ( m ) nem iszl\u00e1m , se ( m ) nem \u00e1llam '' = `` neither islamic , nor a state '' . 
  i do n't think there is some deep conclusion about this and i have no idea why your professor brough it up , or what she wanted to illustrate . 
  these things are quite difficult in hungarian and there 's no concise way of explaining it , you have to get into the language neck deep to sort out things like this . 
  no , you do n't pay to use bins , you pay for the service of taking it away regularly . 
  in hungary , we just think of it as one of the utility bills , like for electricity , heating , water , sewer use , garbage transport etc. 
  the problem with the usual ethnic maps is that very sparsely populated areas are represented with equal `` visual weight '' as densely populated areas . 
  this is what teleki tried to correct with his map . 
  however , he did not simply discard the sparsely populated areas and color them white . 
  he used a much more clever and elaborate idea , being an actual geographer himself . 
  in this map , every square millimeter represents 100 people . 
  he then shifted them around to the nearest dense area the create continuous blobs instead of dispersed dots . 
  but every person is represented there . 
  there is no extra bias introduced by his method . 
  also , in 1920 the most recent census was the 1910 one . 
  now you can argue that the 1910 census was biased , but that 's another thing again . 
  i think the map itself and the presentation is pretty solid . 
  edit : also , the treaty was inevitable but the borders could realistically have ended up more fair , the precise borders we ended up with were not inevitable . 
  speaking hungarian , it 's never an issue , really . 
  you usually know who 's being discussed . 
  and if you 're just talking about the clerk at the bank or the cashier at the shop , it does n't matter anyway . 
  or if it does you can say `` that guy/man/girl / woman '' if you want . 
  there are so many different things about people , it 's not so straighforward that you have to grammatically differentiate between genders . 
  it does n't mean you think of people as gender neutral or anything . 
  it 's just not encoded into the `` fabric of the language '' , just like you do n't express age and other stuff . 
  it 's not that ambiguous . 
  if it 's just a friend , you say `` ein freund von mir '' or `` einer meiner freunde '' , if it 's a boyfriend you say `` mein freund '' . 
  ( for a female friend it 's `` eine freundin von mir '' or `` eine meiner freundinnen '' , and `` meine freundin '' respectively ) . 
  although this disambiguation method still excludes the possibility of polyamory . 
  i guess there was some bias involved , but i 'm not sure which cities you mean . 
  there were several cities with overwhelming hungarian majority that were taken away , like nagyv\u00e1rad , szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti , marosv\u00e1s\u00e1rhely . 
  there were some more balanced ones , like szabadka , but generally the outline of the hungarian majority areas is pretty accurate i think . 
  depends on what we are talking about . 
  if you mean the middle parts of transylvania and parts of the partium , then yeah the harsh red color can introduce bias there . 
  but the regions along the border are still pretty obvious [ even after a ( quick and dirty ) recoloring ] ( https://imgur.com/savdjyx ), 
  i like [ this rendition ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdxucppq6lc ) of the problem better . 
  at 7:42 she makes it evident that she has n't read the selfish gene by dawkins as he writes a great deal about the genetic origins of altruism with several examples ( like ant colonies ) . 
  the title refers to the idea that genes themselves can be imagined/conceptualized as if they were selfish , but the selfishness on the gene level can produce altruism on the organism level . 
  yes , although here 's a part from a bit before that :, 
   i shall argue that a predominant quality to be expected in a successful gene is ruthless selfishness . 
  this gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual behaviour . 
  however , as we shall see , there are special circumstances in which a gene can achieve its own selfish goals best by fostering a limited form of altruism at the level of individual animals . 
  ` special ' and ` limited ' are important words in the last sentence . 
  much as we might wish to believe otherwise , universal love and the welfare of the species as a whole are concepts that simply do not make evolutionary sense . 
  he also makes it clear that all this is metaphors and anthropomorphizations .
