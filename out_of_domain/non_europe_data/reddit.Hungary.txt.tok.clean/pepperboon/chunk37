  when we hear things , we try to guess what they tried to make us believe . 
  and then factor in all the social games of trying to mislead , manipulate and influence and trying to see through such things etc. 
  that 's `` meaning '' . 
  about `` water '' . 
  i have no problem that people on twin earth use the word `` water '' for their chemical that works the same way . 
  when ancient people used the word `` water '' , they did n't mean any specific molecular structure , just `` that stuff in the lakes and rivers and seas '' . 
  the word `` water '' simply got to `` mean '' that . 
  the stuff there -  * points finger * . 
  there 's nothing deeper going on . 
   in a later paper , putnam says essentially that you can call `` meaning '' whatever you want . 
  you can call anything whatever you want . 
   his point is that the things in the world that we pick out by our terms constrain our uses of those terms in certain specific ways . 
  sure . 
  the concept of water started out as `` that thing in the lake '' , and then people discovered it 's chemical makeup , thereby constraining the use of the term . 
  there is no precise thing that water meant in those times . 
  it was simply `` that thing in the rivers and lakes that we can drink '' . 
  there is n't anything deeper going on . 
  i find it weird that philosophers seem to believe in some kind of supernatural connection between word ( units of a certain ape 's communication ) and some universial concepts . 
  people who have no idea that water is made of h2o can still call that substance `` water '' , because they know countless other attributes of it , like it 's a liquid , tasteless , flowing in rivers and lakes , transparent etc. 
  these properties ( especially the need for drinking it ) make it an important concept . 
  okay , i take that part back . 
  let 's just say that certain interpretations of the twin earth thought experiment claim that the chemical formula of water is somehow behind the word `` water '' , even when the speaker has no idea of molecules . 
  but in fact the word `` water '' is just shorthand for `` that transparent thing that flows in rivers that we like to drink '' . 
  there 's no deep mystery here . 
  i 'm sure there are philosophers who think the same way , i 'm bad at remembering names . 
  i also do n't care too much about which particular philosopher said what . 
  my main thrust is that philosophy mostly self-inflicts complications that were n't there before . 
  and then suprisingly discovers how things are actually not the way that nobody except philosophers had thought ( i mean they refute a strawman in the end ) . 
  they meant it more like `` saying and hearing the word * water * is associated with sensory experiences that water produces when a person interacts with it '' . 
  or just start explaining the actual thing without first commenting on the difficulty level . 
  i 'm not too well-versed in philosophy . 
  i 've read quite much on topics that interest me ( mind , consciousness , neuroscience , etc. 
  ) , but i have n't taken philosophy courses . 
  i 'm just a computer scientist and one of my main hobby interests is linguistics . 
  as far as i know , the modern linguistic view is that words do n't `` mean '' things in some deep sense . 
  they acquire meaning through the way communication works . 
  children learn words by usage and association . 
  there 's nothing deep behind the word `` water '' , besides that this is the word your mommy used when giving you a glass of water to drink or when your daddy took you to swim and said `` let 's go into the water '' . 
  none of this requires anything about h2o or xyz . 
  in fact , just like air does n't mean a gas mixture of precise percentages ( 71 % nitrogen , 21 % oxygen etc. 
  ) , it just refers to the gas that we breathe normally . 
  indeed , even in science , `` air '' used to be a synonym of `` gas '' for some time . 
  summary : `` water '' means h2o , xyz and any similar stuff . 
  ask about edge cases and people will become unsure and confused and will say `` i 'm not sure if i 'd call * that * ` water ' ... uhm . 
  maybe . 
  but not really . '', 
  same with any other category . 
  they are fuzzy and have nothing more going on than their everyday communicative use . 
  i have a better analogy than language , for a case where things are the same `` molecule by molecule '' , but `` meanings '' are altered . 
  imagine an electric relay , which can be toggled an electric signal between on and off . 
  if i build this relay into a circuit that controls my garage door , then we could say that the electric signal entering the relay * means * `` open garage door , please '' for the relay . 
  if i build it into a light switch , then the signal means `` turn on the lights '' . 
  the relay is the same , molecule by molecule . 
  when you tell the twin person to bring you some `` water '' , they 'll bring you some xyz , while normal person brings you h2o . 
  but it 's only because they are part of a system that contains that particular compound and not because they mean somethinging different by this word . 
  just like the relay itself alone does n't mean something different by the electric signal if it 's wired in a different circuit . 
  nothing stands alone , nothing is examinable in itself . 
  everything is in connection with its environment and properties do n't apply to individual things , but to relations between things . 
  your weight changes if you go to the moon . 
  your [ size changes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnbxprpf5z8 ) if you go into a vacuum where air pressure no longer compresses you . 
  now obviously i ca n't summarize this in two lines here , but there 's a lot of this sort of thinking in eastern philosophies and i tend to agree with those . 
  yet , you 're here again . 
  yeah , for many people the mental cutoff is about the line connecting the white sea and the black sea , instead of traditional border of europe , the ural mountains . 
  i agree . 
  many people think [ something like this ] ( https://imgur.com/ftrtbrg ) and are surprised how far the `` official '' geographical border of europe is considered to be . 
  i ca n't cite sources or studies on this , but most europe maps focus and center on this area , giving this kind of perception . 
  see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matthias_corvinus#patronage, 
  not sure what you want to imply with `` wannabe '' . 
  he had a huge library , he promoted renaissance arts and architecture etc. 
  he was interested in philosophy and stuff like astronomy/astrology etc. 
  he supported building observatories , he promoted universities , invited foreign philosophers and mathematicians . 
  i have no time for subtitling . 
  but not much information in there . 
  he 's a 70-year-old electrical engineer . 
  at first it bothered him , now he accepts and likes it . 
  wife had thought it was getting to intrusive . 
  but he also realized that as a kid he draw a pirate outfit on a famous poet 's picture in his school book so it 's kinda the same and okay . 
  he shows how quickly he gets likes and shares when he posts something . 
  yeah , it 's always suspicious when cammer does n't include how the incident began . 
  they usually have something to hide . 
  thanks for trying to make sense of what i 'm saying . 
  my impression is that the '' * meaning of a word is in its use * '' idea is the current mainstream in linguistics . 
  perhaps not in philosophy . 
   when we 're talking about something and you say something in particular , are the only facts relevant to what you mean confined to what 's going on ` in your head ' so to speak ? 
  the word `` mean '' in `` what you mean '' is not the same as in `` what this word means '' . 
  for example in german , the first is `` meinen '' , the second is `` bedeuten '' . 
  in my native hungarian there is no separate word for the first use , for that we use the same word that also covers `` to understand '' and for the second case we use a word that also covers `` to report '' . 
  so what a word means and what a person means is not as directly related as it seems from the english perspective and what the word `` water '' means is a different sort of question than what you asked now . 
  you rather ask about the * intended * meaning of a word/sentence/monologue . 
  this is a difficult question . 
  i do n't think there is always some hidden intended meaning of our words . 
  or put otherwise , i do n't think there 's a clear difference between surface meaning and `` deep '' meaning . 
  there are famous examples , like `` would you like to come up for coffee to my place '' as euphemism for proposing sex . 
  in such cases you can see two clear possible interpretations and this kind of ambiguity is crucial to such games . 
  still , the person might have some other ulterior motive , like murdering the other person . 
  the intention is not really contained in the words . 
  in a sense , we 're trying to guess the other person 's intentions , stance , motives etc. 
  from what they say . 
  for example when you 're out in the woods , you may spot some footprints . 
  what does that mean ?
