  it means that there was an animal walking or running through that area recently . 
  but are all the relevant facts of this `` meaning '' confined to the footprint itself ? 
  it 's also relevant that you 've seen such shapes before and you learned to associate it with the animal . 
  people `` drop words '' in a similar way to how animals leave footprints . 
  we try to guess and gauge what state of mind the other person has , by interpreting and trying to see behind their words . 
  or maybe you 're asking if we could find the best interpretation that best captures my intentions and motivations by deeply analyzing my brain . 
  i 'm not really sure how that would look . 
  the brain certainly does n't contain a designated little pocket of water where the neural signals all run in to consult and inspect * water * as it is . 
  to interpret brain signals and brain activity patterns , scientists always have to use correlations , such as showing people images and seeing which areas become active , or asking them to lift their right arm and seeing what gets active in the brain ( or just following the paths of the neurons , but that requires leaving the head itself ) . 
  i do n't believe in any special deep or mysterious `` aboutness '' property of thoughts or words . 
  it 's all just communication games . 
  not sure if this answers what you asked , if not , please elaborate on the question and i 'll try to clarify my answer . 
  at the time they said `` german '' . 
  it 's only since wwii that `` austrian '' is considered a really distinct ethnicity and not just a regional german subgroup . 
  but this `` i 'm so special by doing ` nothing ' '' has been used so many times in the last century .

  the guy also has `` competition '' on youtube : [ jon eats carrots ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8kjyut9vwm ) , countless i watch a guy watching a guy watching a cat watching a guy ... watching nyan cat for 10 hours . 
  there have also been a lot of `` i just ... for no reason '' memes and stuff like planking etc. 
  it 's been overdone . 
  the first guy who said `` wait , what if we could think of ` nothing ' as ` something ' ? '', 
  was perhaps a genius , but now it 's just boring . 
  and if you say `` oh but he did make an impression on you , because you 're writing this '' , i say that making an impression in itself is n't genius and has no value . 
  if the only productive and valuable thing in your work is philosophically challenging the concept of what it means for things to be productive and valuable , then you 've got lots and lots of competition . 
  i have n't seen a single original idea in this style since decades . 
  egyh . 
  1 . \u00a7 , 1117 , 1124 k. ) is . 
  do you want to say this in a shop ? 
  then you could say `` rotringceruzabelet keresek '' ( i 'm looking for mech . 
  pencil insides/fillings ) . 
  we do n't use `` need '' the same way , so you 'll need to provide some context . 
  when and why and to whom would you want to say this ? 
  `` kell '' is strange because its subject is not the person who needs , but the object that is needed . 
  so `` kell '' = `` be needed '' and not `` need '' . 
  ( of course in translations you have to reformulate it , i just mean that the word itself means this ), 
  so `` neked meg kellene venned '' is literally `` for you it would be needed to buy '' , in normal english `` you should buy '' . 
  `` kellene '' is in conditional mood , hence the `` would '' . 
  it expresses some softer suggestion , as if english used `` would must '' instead of `` should '' . 
  `` ennie '' is a conjugated infinitive . 
  `` venned '' was also a conjugated infinitive ( 2nd person sing . 
  ) , so if you understand that one , `` ennie '' is the same idea but 3rd person sing . 
  about `` kisfi\u00fa '' , for some reason many words with `` kis '' are considered compound words . 
  so kisfi\u00fa ( little boy ) , kisl\u00e1ny ( little girl ) , kisgyerek ( little child ) , kisbaba ( little baby ) , kiskutya ( little dog , doggy ) , kiscica ( little cat , kitten ) , kis\u00e1llat ( little animal , pet ) , kismalac ( little pig ) , kisember ( small/ordinary person , john doe , as opposed to rich and influencial high-ups ) , kiskert ( small garden ) , kisaut\u00f3 ( small toy car ) etc. 
  the `` oh , wonderful ! '', 
  exclamation is pretty american/british , we would n't really say something like that . 
  for one , we do n't really say `` oh '' in this way . 
  ( `` very good ! '' ), 
  or `` remek ! '', 
  ( `` good/great ! '' ), 
  or if you 're very relieved sometheing like `` jaj de j\u00f3 ! '', 
  ( like `` oh , so good ! '' ) . 
  saying literally `` wonderful '' feels overly exaggerated to us , almost like sarcasm or mocking . 
  op is the same who asked about whether we still have magic t\u00e1ltos people living in the mountains or some other mythical figures like some `` tud\u00f3s asszony '' ... 
  seems like some fan of esoteric occult stuff , probably asking to learn about these magic gypsy people now . 
  most of them are jobless , poor and marginalized in the outskirts of towns and villages . 
  they mostly live on benefits and child welfare . 
  the romantic image of a wandering gypsy fortune teller and musician or craftsman is outdated by a long time . 
  i do n't know statistics about marriage because it 's illegal to collect such data in hungary . 
  but i think they mostly marry among themselves . 
  would you want it rather from vienna ? 
   m1/m7/m0, 
  m0 has been improved and it got an extra lane in the last years . 
  otherwise i 'm not sure what your problem is with these highways . 
  as others have said , the gell\u00e9rt hill is the best .

  flair + username, 
  loosen up . 
  yep . 
  none of my friends have any idea about what it is . 
  but the media often takes stories from reddit . 
  like top til posts appearing with one day lag at index.hu , or 444 . hu . 
  i guess most hungarians are n't comfortable enough with english . 
  and much of the reddit content is focused on the united states , like us politics , us celebrities , us culture , us way of thinking etc. 
  we do have / r/hungary , but it 's really small . 
  there 's a lot unifying most of reddit . 
  perhaps not all the fringes , but there is a kind of reddit culture . 
  the topics , the memes , the references . 
  people expect you to know such things in most subreddits . 
  reddit is mainly an aggregator site . 
  most of the stuff are links to other websites , so it 's not really `` the source '' . 
  maybe it 's the source of viral phenomena but not really the source of the information . 
  i 'm extremely messed up now , i feel like i 'm on an emotional rollercoaster . 
  i 'm pushing to motivate myself , then i 'm fine for like 2 hours and then again comes this very bad , panic-like state ... crying , and so on . 
  nicolas is trying , he does n't say anything to anything , he just waits for me to get closer to him , but i 'm not yet able to , i 've built very high walls around myself , it seems ... 
  i 'm just hoping that it can still change , but i 'm really lost ... 
  i found a job for the spring break ( two weeks , 4th to 14th [ of april ] , children 's care [ some sort of daycare or some kind of teaching for small kids ] , as always ... ) , and then one from september in a school ... 
  later there may be a few more opportunities , but about a week ago i stopped sending my cv to places ... 
  i hope these will help and they pull me out of this shit that i 'm in with nicolas ... 
  it would be very good to talk [ with you ] ... 
  and we now talked with many people and we always talk , but you know anyway, 
  and i miss you and i hate it that i do n't know what 's up with you, 
  and i have to hear it from others , but even that is very good,
