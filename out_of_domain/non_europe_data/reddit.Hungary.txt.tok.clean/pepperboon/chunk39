  and i love you and this wo n't change, 
  and i screwed up again and sorry, 
  but you wo n't read it anyway, 
   it would cost the person roughly around 3 euros to invite you ,, 
  no money involved . 
  you just need a certain amount of points ( you get points based on how much you seed ) . 
  ( also , just as a sidenote , selling invites is forbidden . ), 
   eating like an average local, 
  most hungarians ca n't afford to eat at restaurants and caf\u00e9s regularly , so it 's a bad comparison . 
  a north american `` poor student '' usually has more money than the average hungarian . 
  it 's a bit difficult because wearing tattoos that `` represent hungary '' is something that usually only radical nationalists do in hungary . 
  anyways , some ideas :, 
  * some building : parliament / chain bridge perhaps . 
  it 's perhaps not very compact and might look boring . 
  * holy crown . 
  might be too formal and it 's a rather serious historical thing ( just see the name ) , so it does n't feel like `` tattoo material '' . 
  mythological bird connected to the foundation legend of hungary ( legend of emese 's dream ) . 
  it 's featured on some instituion emblems , there 's a statue of it in the buda castle and on liberty bridge , but as a tattoo it would probably evoke nationalistic connotations in hungary . 
  most people who 'd wear such a tatto in hungary would be far right people . 
  while as a single man 's invention it does n't represent the whole country , we 've grown to be pretty proud of it so it 's almost like a modern age national symbol ( well , not quite , but almost ) . 
  * something written in the old hungarian alphabet . 
  problem is , such a tatto would also be associated with the far-right . 
  * some national animal breed , like a komondor or puli dog or grey cattle . 
  it might not be recognizable enough . 
  * hungarian red paprika . 
  we put it in almost all our food and it 's an uncontroversial national symbol . 
  it 's actually a falcon ( the legend does n't specify it , but it 's traditionally imagined as a saker falcon ) . 
  croatia was already part of hungary ( with regional autonomy ) in 1097 , after king saint ladislaus i of hungary conquered it in 1091 . 
  edit : apparently some works only count it from 1102, 
  in the 16th century , hungary was essentially broken into [ 3 parts ] ( http://mek.niif.hu/00800/00893/html/img/nagy/2e65.jpg ) . 
  the ottoman occupied middle , the habsburg ruled northwest ( called royal hungary ) and the eastern hungarian kingdom ( later the principality of transylvania ) . 
  the turks were kicked out ( mostly ) by the habsburgs around 1700 and took over the whole of hungary . 
  they basically incorporated it into their empire , joseph ii did n't even get himself crowned as king of hungary , earning the mock name `` the hat king '' . 
  it 's `` austro hungary '' , i.e. 
  austria-hungary , not the town name . 
  [ how i read it ] ( https://imgur.com/gxzomlw ) . 
  it 's [ this ] ( http://www.loopsandtails.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/r_index_thumb.png ) type of cursive ` r ' . 
  nope , unfortunately this city of 1.7 million people has no acceptable pizza delivery . 
  or if you 're a pizza connoisseur and do n't like what you 've found , then what restaurants have you tried and what was your problem with them ? 
  where are you from ? 
  maybe your taste just does n't match the hungarian one . 
  too long . 
  use google translate or pay a translator ( they 'll do it for about $ 35 , there are online options ) . 
  but we are glad to help with an unknown phrase or a handful of sentences . 
  i 'd look into other countries as well , unless you want to study close to your hungarian friends or something like that . 
  these submissions are a bit annoying to be honest . 
  it 's some personal drama stuff that you keep submitting here for translation and then delete it . 
  a one-off is no big deal , but this sub is n't really fit for this purpose . 
  i ca n't really understand how you 're getting these instant chat texts ( i guess i 'd communicate in longer , well formed mails with someone that i do n't share a common language with ) and i can just hope that you are the actual addressee . 
  but perhaps someone will come along and translate it . 
  op already said it 's brit sub for british subject . 
   i get this feeling of being unwelcome . 
  can you elaborate ? 
  if you mean when you need to get things done at places or buy things and cashiers or service people are rude , then they are just as rude to hungarians as well . 
  that 's just the general attitude , like `` why is this customer bothering me , damn '' and i do n't like it either . 
  but again , people are sour because they ( especially these service people , like cashiers ) get paid very low salaries . 
  we compare ourselves to austria and western europe . 
  the movies , the ads , the supermarkets ; we have all these things that show us a lifestyle we ca n't afford . 
  and many people live month by month , many of them having literally no savings . 
  perhaps grandma has a little emergency money somewhere in case a part of the family gets into trouble . 
  many people are deep in debt , and have day-to-day problems with various things you 'd never think about . 
  like having to repair low-quality stuff , and in general a lot of hassle and everyday stress that you could get rid of with a little extra cash . 
   little more impolite if you speak little to none hungarian . 
  - which makes sense . 
  they are like that if you make them do anything extra , it 's not just about the language . 
  it 's more like a `` sigh '' that 's visible from the outside . 
  but yeah , the customer-centered view is very foreign . 
  their usual mindset is that they are the host/lords and the customer is a hassle . 
  someone who better be quiet , read all the rules and obey . 
  the way they formulate the signs is also very different . 
  it 's usually with lots of exclamation marks and heavy use of the word forbidden , and bluntly telling stuff . 
  even when they are n't trying to be rude . 
  for example they 'd rather write `` if you eat , you get a free lemonade '' instead of a more western formulation , something like `` enjoy a free lemonade with your meal '' . 
  there 's a lot less of this kind of `` your '' , `` enjoy '' etc. 
  or they 'd write `` no money exchange !!! '', 
  on their door instead of `` excuse us that we are n't able to exchange currency here '' or something polite . 
  it 's a lot more about telling the customer what to do . 
  just a different mentality ... 
  and stuff costs a lot because of the 27 % vat . 
  we are n't used to it . 
  i 'm sure people would appreciate it once they get to know you a bit . 
  but when you start speaking hungarian to a stranger , it 's surprising * and * it 's very hard for us to understand broken hungarian , spoken with an accent . 
  really . 
  we just are n't used to hearing it . 
  many people have never in their lives heard a foreigner try to speak hungarian . 
  so i think it 's mostly the surprise and the not understanding . 
  they are perhaps also frustrated that they ca n't speak english . 
  i suggest [ this budapest panorama ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:budapest_from_gellert_hill_mc.jpg ) for night mode . 
  depending on the required height you can crop it yourself or use [ this version ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/budapest_banner.jpg ) . 
  so what ? 
  are we really this insecure ? 
  he did n't even mention it in speech , they just displayed a hungarian name as the source for about a second . 
  hungarians are a nation of about 13 million people , people who do all sorts of things . 
  it 's not surprising to see a few hungarian names here and there once in a while . 
  i 'd just add that in hungary `` getting tested '' is not as routine as reddit makes me believe it is in some other countries . 
  so you might find the process a bit more involved , e.g. 
  perhaps ( not sure ) you need a gp 's referral as vernazza mentioned . 
  budapest is definitely not as bike-developed as amsterdam , by far !, 
  i would n't suggest biking in traffic if you are n't experienced . 
  go to margaret island ( margit-sziget ) or other more `` protected '' places like that , the inner city can be tricky for inexperienced tourists .
