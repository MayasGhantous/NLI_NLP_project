  can you give some examples of `` off the beaten path '' things you 've seen in other countries ? 
  i ca n't think of anything not in tourist books that i would recommend to a `` generic '' , `` average '' person , i.e. 
  someone that we know nothing specific about . 
  when something is of interest , guide book editors will write about it . 
  good guide book editors are real people like us , who give their genuine recommendations based on plenty of knowledge and experience of the country and tourism . 
  you wo n't have huge crowds of foreigners in every single place that is mentioned in a guidebook . 
  if very few tourists go to some place then it 's mostly not that interesting or enjoyable for the general tourist . 
  they are generally poor and boring parts . 
  i mean , you could walk around in a [ random north-eastern hungarian town ] ( https://www.google.hu/maps/@48.125944,22.3115186,3a,75y,323.54h,76.25t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sbme_gvemivezcvl_8wphrq!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo1.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dbme_gvemivezcvl_8wphrq%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d64.879036%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656 ) , that 's pretty non-touristy , but very likely you 'd get bored in a few minutes . 
  there 's plenty of stuff to do in hungary and they are all mostly in the guidebooks . 
  there are many castles , churches , thermal baths , forests , caves , museums etc. 
  added : if you do n't have a guidebook , have a look at http://gotohungary.com/ it looks pretty good . 
   hungary is mostly tourism oriented, 
  not really . 
  what data do you base this on ? 
  i 'd add that many people do n't even know what it stands for . 
  just like many do n't know what wc ( `` v\u00e9c\u00e9 '' ) stands for , they just use it . 
  we just learn as kids that the name for this thing is '' \u00e1b\u00e9c\u00e9 '' . 
  in some parts of the country ( particularly budapest ) they used to be called `` k\u00f6z\u00e9rt '' , but it sounds a bit dated today ( to me ) . 
  one can also simply say `` bolt '' ( `` shop '' ) . 
  not really . 
  many people have no such thoughts when using this term . 
  it 's just a compact way to refer to these places . 
  older folks also still say '' \u00e1pisz '' for paper/pencil etc. 
  shops . 
   valid for a single uninterrupted trip without transfer on public transport bus services ordered by bkk zrt . 
  ** between a terminus in a town of the budapest metropolitan area and the first bus stop within the administrative boundaries of budapest ** . 
  validity period is 60 minutes after stamping . 
  please show and hand over your ticket if requested by the inspector . 
  so from the terminus ( end station ) in a town outside budapest ( e.g. 
  the budapest transport center ( bkk ) organizes public transport not only within the administrative boundaries of budapest , but also in the metropolitan area , i.e. 
  smaller towns outside budapest . 
  so you can ride from a town in the metropolitan area into budapest , but only to the first stop in budapest ( or back ) . 
  it 's useful for people who have a budapest pass , which is not valid outside the area of budapest , but they want to travel to/from a town outside budapest ( or within a town ) . 
  ( note : the normal single-ticket ( 350 huf ) is valid on the whole length of any bkk bus , even outside budapest . ), 
  buy a globe , seriously . 
  all these maps are distorted and you 'll discover so many interesting things on the actual 3d globe . 
   it is basically teenager size there, 
  op could be a teenager though . 
  people do all sorts of weird things for all sorts of weird reasons , so why not ? 
  if you have the time , money and interest , then why not come and visit for a few days and then see where it goes from there ? 
  learning any language requires dedication and effort , and hungarian is surely more difficult for an english-speaker than , say , spanish or german , but motivation is the key thing . 
  if your tattoo is enough motivation for you ( only you can judge this ) , then it can work . 
  look at this : https://www.reddit.com/r/budapest/comments/4eoidx/traveling_to_budapest_this_spring_2022june/, 
  hungary has no territorial claims . 
  the idea is fantasy , alternate-history , scifi category . 
  edit : a bit more details on why it 's impossible :, 
  hungary has no territorial claims anywhere, 
  hungary has very little power , we 're part of eu , nato etc. , they would also have to approve it which is pretty unrealistic ( border changes in an eu country would surely be a sign of instability and a precedent for irredentism in general ), 
  the region has lots of ukrainians who probably would n't want to join hungary, 
  even if hungary just took the hungarian-populated parts , it 's such an insignificant and poor area ( basically a few villages and a couple of small towns ) that it is absolutely not in proportion with the ensuing international turmoil . 
  i think even if it was offered as a gift from ukraine , we would hesitate to take it . 
  ( and i 'm speaking about actual realities here , not fantasies after a few shots of p\u00e1linka ), 
   szombati mean something has done in saturday . 
  this bread made on saturday this is a szombati bread , but is works all of the days . 
  this bread made on monday ( h\u00e9tf\u0151 ) . 
  this is a h\u00e9tf\u0151i ( monday ) bread . 
  actually it probably refers to the town called `` nagyszombat '' , previously in hungary and today in slovakia , or another town named - szombat . 
   i am wondering whether women are approachable and open to conversation ( with foreignors ) ? 
  are the girls approachable or will i need to be introduced ? 
  some are , some are n't . 
  depends on the context as well . 
  it 's not usual to `` hit on '' stranger girls in the streets and shopping malls . 
  but if you do it in a not too pushy way with a girl who seems to have time , you may have a nice conversation . 
  jumping in with the absolute goal of fucking them is not the right approach anyway . 
  just `` smell '' the situation and have something to talk about and enjoy whatever happens and do n't get angry if they do n't want to talk to you for whatever reason ( not in the mood , in a hurry , does n't like random strangers , ca n't / does n't want to speak english , she does n't like your face etc. ) . 
  the chances for a fun chat are much better at pubs , especially ones that foreigners and hungarians both often visit . 
  those people usually * want * to get to know people , while in the streets it 's unusual . 
  from there , you can probably get invited to do something some other day or invite people to go somewhere etc ( party , hiking , biking , whatever you like ) . 
  it 's less usual to `` ask someone out '' like you ( probably ) do , you rather just do more and more stuff together ( first usually with other people involved as well ) and grow to like it and call it a relationship . 
  if op could write a bit better english and could spell better , then it might even make some sense . 
  question is whether there are other traditional connections between hungary and archangels besides gabriel . 
  i do n't know much about this , but archangel gabriel was used to symbolize hungary on the new nazi occupation memorial , too , so there must be some traditional symbolism involved . 
  i would n't say that `` gyermek '' is archaic , it 's just more formal/sophisticated and `` gyerek '' is more colloquial . 
  i do n't know it , but the beginning would be, 
  ( in dialect it can be `` megholt '' and `` melyik '' can sound like `` melik '' or perhaps even somewhat like `` melek '' ) . 
  i never heard this specific one , but i know several similar ones , like the extremely vulgar `` milyen feri ? 
  ( `` what feri ? 
  - the one that jerks his dick into your mouth ! '' ), 
  we learn all the names and years when they reigned and stuff like who was whose what relative , what taxes did they introduce , who was their wife , where did they fight battles etc. 
  we learn tons of facts . 
  then we write a test and forget most of it . 
  how much you retain depends on your history teacher and how dry he/she teaches . 
  mine were pretty good and made it rather colorful with interesting stories/trivia/connections with other things , good use of maps etc. 
  but not everyone is lucky to have enthusiastic teachers . 
  examples that i think most people would know :, 
  * king saint stephen i : foundation of the christian kingdom , fought and killed ( not personally ) a relative of his called kopp\u00e1ny to get the throne . 
  * king saint ladislaus i : people would know his golden image and that he was an important king with legends about him . 
  ( conquered croatia , too , but that 's perhaps less widespead knowledge ) . 
  * king coloman the learned : existed and was learned, 
  * king andrew ii : issued the golden bull in 1222 ( almost everyone will know this date , it 's so memorable ) , some important basic law . 
  * king b\u00e9la iv : called `` our second home founder '' , rebuilt and fortified the kingdom with stone castles after the devastation of the mongol ( tatar ) attack of 1241 . 
  * ( king andrew iii : memorable for being the last \u00c1rp\u00e1dian king , perhaps less known ), 
  now , of course some people already forgot some of this , too , if they only watch reality shows on tv etc. , so you ca n't really generalize . 
  for sure almost everyone knows about king saint stephen i , if not from elsewhere then from the august 20 celebrations each year and the rock opera * istv\u00e1n , a kir\u00e1ly * . 
  also everyone knows about the tatar attacks , it 's also in several sayings . 
  you also have to understand that national history is quite politicized here . 
  patriots/nationalists try to make it seem more glorious , while the more liberal/internationalist types try to overcompensate and downplay the importance and significance of hungarian history . 
  just keep this in mind . 
   are there any kings who are seen as having been bad/evil ?
