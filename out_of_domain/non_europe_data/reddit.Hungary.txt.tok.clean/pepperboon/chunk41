  our history books are n't that comic-book-like . 
  it 's mostly facts about what happened and how things happened , not who was the good guy and who was the evil guy . 
  they were part of the group of foreign citizens that attacked the hungarian border , attacked the authorities , broke down the border fence and illegally stormed into hungarian territory . 
  they were arrested and a proper trial is needed to decide who did what . 
  just because you 're blind on one eye , you ca n't be exempted from trial . 
  yes , i also think these two people were n't the main perpetrators and should eventually get released back to serbia . 
  will you be here for more than 6 months ? 
   you can only apply for a licence in the country where you are ` normally resident ' . 
   this means the place where you usually or regularly live . 
   your should live there for ** at least 185 days ** in each calendar year because of personal or work-related ties . 
   only a few examiners let you pass without handing them money ( it was ~ 50 pounds for me back in 2008 ) . 
  my friend was offered to bribe the examiner by the instructor he declined then he failed 3 times in driving, 
  it varies . 
  i got it without bribing , without attempting to bribe and without even discussing the topic of bribing with either the instructor or the examiner . 
  yes , it 's sold in all book shops . 
  it 's a very famous book . 
  i ca n't imagine a book shop not having it . 
  the hungarian title is simply `` 1984 '' . 
  as others said , it 's mostly about something immediate . 
  therefore , the `` az '' sounds out of place , it would be more natural to hear `` nekem tetszik ez a film . '', 
  because you 'd probably say it when the movie is `` there with you '' . 
  it simply means that you like what you see , you 're having a good time with the film , but maybe you 'll forget it in a few days . 
  in past tense ( `` tetszett a film '' ) means you had a good time with it while watching it , it 's a positive thing to say , but does not imply more ( either because it was just a one-time watch thing or because you saw it too recently to say that you became a long-time fan ) . 
  it would mean that you like it in a more `` permanent '' sense . 
  maybe you saw this film some longer time ago , probably multiple times . 
  you could probably say in english that you 're `` a fan '' of the film . 
  not necessarily one of your top favorites , but this liking has become part of you , so to speak . 
  `` kedvel '' is not used much in normal speech . 
  it 's mostly used in bad translations in dubbed tv shows when the translator thinks that the english sentence structure must be preserved and does n't know that `` tetszik '' is a better choice . 
  or on facebook in sentences like '' < name  likes this . '', 
  for technical reasons : tetszik requires putting the name in dative case ( - nak / - nek ) , which requires deciding the vowel harmony , and facebook had no such algorithm until recently . 
  ** - you like the color , the furniture , it makes a good impression on you . 
  ** - sounds weird . 
  liking someone else 's house in the `` szeret '' sense is strange , it would be more fitting for one 's own house after longer time of living there . 
  even then i would n't say `` szeretem a h\u00e1zamat '' ( it sounds like some weird fetish ) , but simply `` szeretem ezt a h\u00e1zat . '', 
  ** - unnatural , nobody would say this ( see info above on `` kedvel '' ) . 
  ** `` i like to eat kolb\u00e1sz / i like eating kolb\u00e1sz ? 
  the most natural way would be simply `` szeretem a kolb\u00e1szt . 
  '' , without explicitly saying `` to eat '' , just implying it . 
  but if you really want to specify that you like eating it , then `` szeretek kolb\u00e1szt enni '' is the way to go . 
  it focuses too much on eating , as if you really had to specify that you like to eat it and not do something else with it . 
  `` szeretem azt , hogy kolb\u00e1szt enni '' is ungrammatical , it 's like `` i like that to eat kolb\u00e1sz '' in english . 
  correction : it 's `` tetszel '' . 
  this would usually imply a first/early impression , mostly based on looks and smaller interactions . 
  this is `` to love '' , either romantic or family love or very close , loving friendship . 
  again `` kedvel '' is not used much , people would probably use something more slangish , like `` b\u00edrom '' or `` j\u00f3 fej '' ( good guy/gal ) or any number of other current informal formulations . 
  yeah , that 's a good rule of thumb . 
  `` tetszik '' describes a positive feeling in the moment , the word literally means `` it pleases [ me ] '' . 
  it 's a totally analogous situation with german ( gefallen ; es gef\u00e4llt mir ) and spanish ( gustar ; me gusta ) . 
  if you 're familiar with any of those , then it 's basically the same thing . 
  there are very few actual learners here . 
  before your question on may 24 , the most recent question * by an actual learner who had asked about some issue of understanding * ( i.e. 
  not just `` please translate this phrase for me or how should i start learning ) was on, 
  * april 24 and before that on :, 
  * march 2, 
  * january 2, 
  * december 6, 
  * november 17, 
  so six questions of understanding by learners in 5 months . 
   i would understand `` nekem tetszik ez a v\u00e1ros '' to mean you 're visiting a city for the first time , and your initial reaction is positive . 
  correct . 
  tetszik implies that you 're not totally familiar with the whole thing . 
   then you can say `` szeretem ez a v\u00e1ros '' to mean `` i like this city . 
  i 've visited many times and i always enjoy coming here . '', 
  yes , you would only say this after visiting multiple times or living there for some time . 
   but neither means , `` i love this city , '' right ? 
  the difference between `` to like '' and `` to love '' is not the same as between `` tetszik '' and `` szeret '' . 
  `` tetszik '' is casual , impression-based `` like '' , `` szeret '' can be either a more regular , better-founded `` like '' or full blown `` love '' ( romantically , platonically , in family , friends , things ) . 
  so you can translate `` szeretem ezt a v\u00e1rost '' as either `` i like this city '' or `` i love this city '' , depending on the situation . 
  conversely , `` nagyon tetszik '' does not mean love , but `` really like a lot '', 
  `` nagyon szeretem ezt a v\u00e1rost '' can be `` i like it very much '' or `` i love it a lot '' . 
  `` nagyon tetszik '' is still about immediate impressions , just that those impressions are even better and make you more enthusiastic than without `` nagyon '' . 
   lastly , as you mentioned , `` nekem tetszik az a film '' would sound weird since teztsik is in the moment and `` az a film '' is something far away , but i do n't think `` szeretem az a v\u00e1ros '' would be fine . 
  since `` szeret '' is more permanent so you can point to something far away , like that city , ugye ? 
  this also touches on the difference between the hungarian ez-az usage vs. english this-that . 
  in hungarian we use `` ez '' more often than `` this '' in english . 
  in hungarian `` az '' has a `` pointing-over-there '' feeling ( e.g. 
  pointing to things that far from the speaker and close to the listener or far from both ) and `` ez '' is used for things/topics that are currently under discussion . 
  the english `` that '' is somewhat more broad and neutral and not as strongly pointing away . 
  therefore , `` nekem tetszik az a film '' conjures up a picture of a friend holding a dvd like 5 meters away ( but definitely out of your arm 's reach ) and you 're trying to stretch your arm pointing towards it . 
  ( this is somewhat exaggerated , though . ), 
  it 's not incorrect , but not a * natural * thing you 'd hear . 
  in past tense ( `` nekem tetszett az a film '' ) can be more natural because the positive impression was in the past , there is no requirement that it should be `` there with you '' any more . 
  `` szeretem azt a v\u00e1rost '' is fine when you 're outside the city . 
   all the european `` right wing '' governments are pretty hardcore about sticking their noses into the lives of everyday citizens, 
  yeah , because this just is n't an issue here . 
  unlike in the us , people have the expectation that the state should provide necessary services to the people , like healthcare , education etc. 
  in the former socialist countries like hungary , this expectation also roots in those socialist times . 
  also , people are poor here and many really depend on government services such as pensions and they could n't pay high prices for healthcare/education . 
  so if you propose to reduce government transfers , you 'll never be elected . 
  see also our `` social referendum '' in 2008 . 
  actually in hungary , the socialists are in close association with free market liberal groups . 
  liberal here also refers to market liberalism ( i.e. 
  that we should let business and markets take their natural course without government influence , hence the name ) as well as social liberalism ( supporting gay people , soft drug decriminalization etc. ) . 
  and since the socialist mszp governed together with the liberal ( in the previous sense ) szdsz , in hungary these ideas are unified into the general umbrella term of the `` left-liberal side '' ( `` balliber\u00e1lis oldal '' ) . 
  for us hungarians , `` right-wing '' as a term is more about the national conservative ideology : about rejecting the 40-year-long communist rule , about support for hungarians outside the new borders , etc. 
  for us it has nothing to do with the `` small government '' idea . 
  that idea just does n't enter the picture when trying to describe what `` right-wing '' means here . 
   i really like the idea , but i posted in both german and hungarian and got no replies, 
  i guess people who 'd be willing to help ( like me ) do n't even know about that sub .
