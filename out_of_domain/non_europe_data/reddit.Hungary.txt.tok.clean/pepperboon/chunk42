  i ca n't monitor dozens of language learning / translation subs in the hopes of catching a few questions about hungarian in a sea of other languages . 
  there are few native hungarians on reddit , so it 's best for you to post here , not scattered over some obscure subs . 
  they are called the [ sz\u00e9kelys ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sz\u00e9kelys ) and were originally tasked with guarding the eastern border of transylvania . 
  you should go to the touristic places or give us a good reason why you do n't want to . 
  we ca n't read the mind of other people . 
  someone already gave you the translation : `` well then , '' / `` well , good '' / `` okay then '' . 
  now please go . 
  i hope you do n't bring this stuff to this subreddit again . 
  ( to others : this user has posted several times before but keeps deleting previous posts about some personal drama things including chat logs of a probably depressed person chatting with someone else in hungarian . 
  the poster looks very much like a stalker or at least someone who 's not minding their own business . ), 
  good list , but hortob\u00e1gy and holl\u00f3k\u0151 are far from authentic and are kinda fake . 
  until it 's corrected : https://www.reddit.com/r/hungarian/search?q=&amp;restrict_sr=on, 
  i 'll answer in english , since you asked in english . 
  agglutinative means that the language uses suffixes ( = toldal\u00e9k ) heavily to express the grammatical roles of words in a sentence . 
  `` agglutinative '' is `` ragoz\u00f3 '' in hungarian . 
  so in english they have `` i look '' , in hungarian we have `` n\u00e9z * ek * '' , the person is expressed by the suffix * - ek * . 
  or in english they have `` in the house '' , in hungarian we have `` a h\u00e1z * ban * '' . 
  it has nothing to do with compound words ( like tenger + alatt + j\u00e1r\u00f3 ) , agglutination is about grammatical suffixes ( like h\u00e1z * ban * , j\u00e1r * \u00f3 * , nagy * obb * etc. 
  ) , and not just for nouns , but for all kinds of words ( verbs , adjectives etc. ) . 
  but non-agglutinative languages use suffixes , too . 
  indeed , whether a language is agglutinative or not is not a yes or no thing , there is a whole spectrum . 
  besides agglutinative languages , we have isolating languages such as english or mandarin chinese , which use few suffixes and express grammar through separate words and word order . 
  then the so called flective or fusional languages like german , spanish or russian use different word endings for different grammatical concepts ( like verb conjugation ) but they differ from agglutinative languages in that the stem of the word often changes as well . 
  good job !, 
  here 's a correction :, 
  this `` olyasvalahogy '' is out of place here . 
  if you want to say `` or something like that '' , it 's `` vagy olyasmi '' . 
  `` sz\u00fcl\u0151 '' is somewhat irregular, 
  the `` noha \u0151 m\u00e9g \u00e9l\u0151 volt '' part is not really necessary . 
   i want to say `` i have a hungarian family ... kind of / sort of . '', 
  what is the difference between `` olyasvalahogy '' and `` vagy olyasmi ? '', 
  saying `` kind of / sort of '' after a sentence a quite specifically english turn of phrase that 's hard to translate directly . 
  `` vagy olyasmi '' means `` or something like that '' . 
  you may also say `` a csal\u00e1dom magyarnak mondhat\u00f3 '' ( `` my family can be said to be hungarian '' ) or just rephrase it altogether and say `` a csal\u00e1dom magyar , de legal\u00e1bbis magyar sz\u00e1rmaz\u00e1s\u00fa '' ( `` my family is hungarian , but at least of hungarian origin '' ) . 
  `` olyasvalahogy '' is a weird and rare word . 
  all `` olyas - '' words sound a bit odd except `` olyasmi '' . 
  they are maybe a bit formal , a bit oldish , a bit silly . 
  i do n't know . 
  they are n't usual words . 
   what is the difference between `` megs\u00fcletik '' and `` sz\u00fcletik ? '', 
  first about meg - in general . 
  it 's a verbal prefix that emphasizes either the instantaneous or the perfective aspect of the verb . 
  for example : `` ettem az eb\u00e9demet '' = `` i was eating my lunch '' but `` megettem az eb\u00e9demet '' = `` i have eaten/had eaten/ate my lunch '' ( finished it ) . 
  or `` l\u00e1ttam a h\u00e1zat '' = `` i saw the house '' ( i was able to visually observe it ) but `` megl\u00e1ttam a h\u00e1zat '' = `` i caught sight of the house '' . 
  in case of sz\u00fcletik , it 's a bit more difficult to explain . 
  in fact , `` m\u00e1r r\u00e9gen meghalt , amikor \u00e9n sz\u00fclettem '' is also correct but has a slightly different meaning-flavor to it . 
  the version with `` megsz\u00fclettem '' draws the attention to that precise moment , while the `` sz\u00fclettem '' version sounds like we are talking about the birth event in a bit more broad terms . 
  i know this sounds vague , but these things can only be `` felt '' after lots of practice . 
  perhaps because here we talk generally about the life event and as an attribute of a person which he keeps for all his life . 
  we are n't really specifically talking about that moment when he was born . 
  but perhaps it 's just how this phrase is used . 
  `` xxxx-ben sz\u00fcletett '' is something we say a lot and one version `` won '' and became the usual way of saying this expression . 
  do n't worry too much about this , and hope for, 
   how do i say `` ago , '' as in `` several hundred years ago . '', 
  is it always `` ezel\u0151tt ? '', 
  or is that `` ez '' before the `` el\u0151tt '' for a reason ? 
  lastly , why is \u00e9v put into the instrumental case - '' \u00e9vvel ? '', 
  just because ? 
  yeah , ago is `` ezel\u0151tt '' and it takes a noun in the - val / - vel case . 
  this use of - val / - vel is actually a regular thing :, 
  - the apple tree is 20 meters behind our house . 
  - they divorced 5 years after the wedding . 
  - t\u00f6bbsz\u00e1z \u00e9vvel ezel\u0151tt - several hundred years ago, 
  - t\u00f6bbsz\u00e1z \u00e9vvel ezut\u00e1n - several hundred years from now, 
  - t\u00f6bbsz\u00e1z \u00e9vvel kor\u00e1bban / k\u00e9s\u0151bb - several hundred years earlier/later, 
  - ( but : t\u00f6bbsz\u00e1z \u00e9v m\u00falva - several hundread years from now . 
  the reason is that m\u00falva literally means something like `` having passed/elapsed '' , so the noun stays in nominative case since originally it was a subject as in '' ... years having elapsed '' or `` after ... years have elapsed '' . 
  also note that this reasoning is just the origin of the phrase , today `` m\u00falva '' acts as a postposition in itself , where you just have to learn that it takes nouns in the nominative case . ), 
  basically this - val / - vel is like `` by '' . 
  we specify the quantity by which we `` mentally shift '' the position/time/quantity of something . 
  in english there 's often no preposition corresponding to it so it may take time for you to get used to it . 
  other similar uses of this suffix :, 
  - i 'm 10 centimeters taller than you . 
  - my salary has increased by 10 percent . 
  so `` ezel\u0151tt '' is originally `` ez el\u0151tt '' ( literally `` before this '' ) , but it became a set phrase and is now written in one word . 
  the ** normal ** verb * szokik * ( usually used with prefixes ) means ` to get accustomed to ' , ` to get into the habit [ of ] ' . 
  usual prefixed versions are * megszokik ... - t * , * hozz\u00e1szokik ... - hoz / - hez / - h\u00f6z * ( both ` to get accustomed to ' ) , * r\u00e1szokik ... - ra / - re * ( ` to get addicted to ' ) and * leszokik ... - r\u00f3l / r\u0151l * ( ` to break the habit [ of ... ] ' , ` to quit [ smoking/etc . ] ' ) . 
  * szok\u00e1s * means ` habit ' or ` custom ' ( even for example * n\u00e9pszok\u00e1s * = ` folk custom ' / ` folk tradition ' ), 
  now , the ** special ** * szokott ... - ni * is best thought of as a special grammatical construct that you just learn to use in this way , in the past tense . 
  you can simply accept it , learn it and it will be okay . 
  but if you are curious about * why * it 's in the past tense : because originally the construct literally meant ` he ( has ) got into the habit of ' , ` he ( has ) got accustomed to ... ' . 
  if he is now * in * the habit , that means he * got * into the habit in the past . 
  since hungarian had a verb for * getting into * the habit , but not * being in * / * having * a habit , this weird grammatical construct was born , where you use a past tense form to express having a habit * now * . 
  but then again , what i just explained is only the origin of it , but today it is simply a grammatical construct . 
  many native hungarian speakers could n't even explain why it is so , it 's simply a special construct that one uses this way , totally separately from the normal `` szokik '' verb . 
  this is hard because to answer it well , one must really feel the nuances of both american and hungarian swearing and the `` heaviness '' each swear word . 
  we hear `` shit '' and `` fuck '' a lot in movies , but i 'd have to spend years in the us to really get a true everyday feel for it . 
  i thought americans are quite prudish about swearing in general , for example with words like `` cunt '' . 
  i think the hungarian `` faszfej '' is pretty similar to its literal translation `` dickhead '' in american english . 
  they are both strong , vulgar insults . 
  it means you hate or you are angry at that person for some specific reason . 
  okay among friends who swear . 
  swearing like this is also more acceptable if you have a legitimate reason to be upset about something . 
  also , it depends on the particular group of people . 
  some people view swearing as very uncultured and `` bunk\u00f3 '' . 
  edit : one additional aspect is that it seems to me that swearing in english is somewhat funny/lighthearted in many contexts and is n't really rude/insulting . 
  i 'd say swearing in hungarian is rarely funny ** unless ** you are using some new , unique , creative combination of swearwords ( we are quite proud of these endless possibilities ) . 
  but if you simply use `` kurva '' or `` geci '' or other swear words it does n't really express a lightheared/friendly tone , it 's rather an expression of being upset and angry . 
  life 's full of surprises !, 
  `` szia '' is said to one person , `` sziasztok '' to multiple people .
