  we write an exclamation mark at the end of greetings not a comma . 
  sholip 's answers are good , here 's a bit more :, 
   i do n't understand the `` el '' or the conjugation on `` kezd . '', 
  the el - prefix modifies the meaning/aspect of the verb , it makes it more instantaneous/perfective , similar to meg - . 
  the basic meaning of el - is `` away '' , but for some verbs it does n't mean `` away '' , but the instantaneous/perfective aspect . 
  it 's very very hard to describe this in words . 
  `` t\u00e9nyleg kell kezdenem magyarul \u00edrni '' is something that no native speaker would say ever . 
  it 's broken hungarian . 
  the el - makes it `` flow better '' . 
  a clumsy explanation : basically it 's you want to express that you must to get into the state where you have started writing hungarian . 
  it 's not that `` beginning writing '' is what you really have to do , it 's not literally the beginning moments that are so important , but that the writing will have begun . 
  the thing after the beginning is the important part . 
  so the el - gives the perfective meaning that focuses on the aspect that the `` beginning '' will be completed . 
  sorry if this sounds confusing , but again , it 's hard to describe . 
  it 's best to read a lot and pick it up . 
  there are similar situations with mond ( to say , to tell ) / megmond ( to tell something assertively + perfective/instantaneous ) / elmond ( to tell [ a story , a fact , a secret ] , as opposed to keeping it to yourself + perfective/instantaneous ) and k\u00e9rdez / megk\u00e9rdez ( perfective/instantaneous ) . 
  they have subtle differences in meaning and usually in each sentence there 's only one good solution , but it 's hard to explain the choice . 
   this literally says , `` too many replies arrived , '' right ? 
  but it really means `` there were to many answers ? '', 
  it does n't `` flow well '' in hungarian to say `` there were too many answers '' . 
  it would be grammatically correct to say `` sok v\u00e1lasz volt . 
  '' , but it sounds wrong . 
  it sounds like saying in english that `` many answers existed . '', 
  where ? 
  how ? 
  it sounds better to say that many answers arrived . 
   i wanted to say , `` they were hard to read ; '' is it better to say `` it was hard to read them ? '', 
  we do n't have an equivalent grammatical construction in hungarian . 
  ( if you think about it , it 's a weird construction in english . 
  compare :, 
  * it is hard to read the book . 
  * the book is hard to read . 
  the first is pretty straightforward . 
  but the second is weird if you really look closely at the words . 
  it sounds like the hardness is about the book , but actually it 's about the reading . 
  but yeah , you can take `` hard to read '' as a unit , but i think `` the book is hard-to-read '' would have a slightly different flavor , if we imagined it as an adjective , like `` a hard-to-read book '' . ), 
  you * could * turn `` hard to read '' into an adjective phrase as `` nehezen olvashat\u00f3 '' . 
  `` olvashat\u00f3 '' means `` readable '' , so `` k\u00f6nnyen olvashat\u00f3 '' is `` easily readable '' / `` easy to read '' , while `` nehezen olvashat\u00f3 '' would be `` hard to read '' ( not `` hardly readable '' , because `` hardly '' has a special meaning in english ) . 
  so in fact you could also say that `` a v\u00e1laszok nehezen olvashat\u00f3k voltak '' , but it sounds convoluted/twisted . 
  it 's more straightforward and simple to just say `` neh\u00e9z volt olvasni a v\u00e1laszokat '' ( `` it was hard to read the answers '' ) . 
   why do we need '' \u00fagy '' here ? 
  `` csak \u00fagy '' is a set phrase , meaning `` just so '' . 
  if you write `` ez j\u00f3 , ha itt csak \u00edrok '' i 'd expect a second part like `` de nem besz\u00e9lek '' ( i only write here , [ but do n't talk ] ) . 
  it would be more like the english `` only '' instead of `` just '' . 
  to emphasize the `` just '' sort of meaning , it 's better to use `` csak \u00fagy '' . 
   lastly , i want to learn about the verb `` k\u00e9rdez . '', 
  i can see this word means to `` to ask ; '' does it imply `` a question ? '', 
  can you just say `` akarok t\u00e9ged k\u00e9rdezni ? '', 
  because in english , you ca n't just say `` i want to ask you '' - you need to say `` i want to ask you a question . '', 
  is that `` a question '' already built into `` k\u00e9rdez ? '', 
  that 's because english uses ask in two meanings : to ask for something like a favor and to ask a question . 
  in hungarian we use different words for these . 
  the first is `` k\u00e9r '' the second is `` k\u00e9rdez '' . 
  so in some sense `` k\u00e9rdez '' does have `` question '' built into it , at least if you 're approaching it from the english point of view . 
  by goulash foreigners usually refer to any dish made with goulash meat , so both p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt and guly\u00e1sleves . 
  although confusingly they usually mean p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt with goulash . 
  it 's the so called `` conjugated infinitive '' . 
  it 's basically the infinitve with person information encoded into it . 
  something like `` for me to start '' . 
  `` kell '' is basically `` to be needed '' , so the literal translation of this whole expression would be `` is-needed * for-me-to-start * '' ( or `` it is needed for me to start '' or `` i-to-start is-needed '' , i.e. 
  i need to start ) . 
  see last line in the conjugation table at https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kezd#conjugation and a short explanation at wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_verbs#infinitive_with_personal_suffixes, 
  the verb `` kell '' requires the other verb to be in this form . 
  - i have to go . 
  - you have to see . 
  - we have to eat . 
  ( alternatively , one can also use the imperative-subjunctive mood with kell and say `` el kell kezdjek \u00edrni '' but to me it does n't that good in this case , but it 's grammatical . ), 
  i see . 
  is not okay , because then you 'd be insulting the language . 
  `` kurva '' before adjectives is basically just a cursing variant of ` very ' , but before nouns it 's a strong insult , like ` this goddamn-motherfucking language is hard ' . 
  it 's something you 'd say when throwing a tantrum and angrily throwing your books on the floor after failing an exam and thinking about giving up the whole thing or something . 
  `` bazmeg '' is the usual filler if you just want to turn a normal sentence into a cursing sentence that 's somewhat casual and not really angry but still totally not acceptable in polite environments , while english uses `` fucking '' for the same purpose . 
  what i want to say here is that the cursing does n't translate one-to-one and sometimes `` fucking '' is best translated as just a `` bazmeg '' thrown in somewhere . 
  it does n't matter where he or you were born , what matters is whether he has/had hungarian citizenship . 
  if yes , then you are also a hungarian citizen . 
  \u00e9rtelem - sense , intellect , meaning, 
  \u00e9rtelm\u0171 - having ( such and such ... ) sense/meaning ( * adj. 
  egy\u00e9rtelm\u0171 - unambiguous ( literally : having one sense ), 
  egy\u00e9rtelm\u0171s\u00edt - disambiguate ( literally : make something have one sense ), 
  egy\u00e9rtelm\u0171s\u00edt\u0151 - disambiguator , disambiguating ( something that disambiguates ), 
  [ - s\u00edt is a suffix ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-s%c3%adt ) that creates verbs from adjectives meaning `` to make x '' , e.g. 
  it 's basically the same in meaning as the - \u00edt suffix , but when adjectives end in a vowel , then two vowels would meet ( egy\u00e9rtelm * \u0171 * + * \u00ed * t ) and we do n't like that so we add a - s - . 
  it 's exactly as normal as `` for further possible meanings of ` hungary ' , see hungary ( disambiguation page ) '' . 
   what 's up with them ? 
  i mean i know homeless people , but they were just scattered around randomly everywhere , and did n't seem to be begging or anything , just sleeping . 
  yeah , homeless people . 
  not sure what you mean by `` randomly everywhere '' or `` worst places imaginable for sleeping '' . 
  they are often down in underpasses , near metro stations . 
  naturally i 'm european and i consider myself a european since hungary is in europe . 
  we have a common history and cultures that have strongly influenced one another ( similar cuisines , staple foods , livestock , folk tales etc. ) . 
  we have all been strongly influenced by ancient greek and roman ideas of state organization , philosophy . 
  as well as the world view of christianity , also the enlightenment etc. 
  we also share ( to some degree ) the recent memory of the 20th century wars and dictatorships . 
  probably there are just more homeless people than you 're used to . 
  because they surely also go to non-busy places , some live in self-made `` cottages '' in the woods , abandoned places etc. 
  and some are at busier places some of the time , probably because it 's easier to beg ( even if they were n't begging at the exact moment ) , collect stuff etc. 
  but yeah , homelessness is a problem . 
  most people do n't like them too much because they stink , they are unsightly and sometimes hassle people . 
  the mayor also tried to ban sleeping in busy areas but it was very controversial from the opposition . 
  not all vpn is slow .
