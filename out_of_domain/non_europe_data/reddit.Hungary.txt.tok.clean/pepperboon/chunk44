  some are affordable . 
  also , invitation-restricted hungarian trackers are not really targeted by them . 
  but public sites definitely are . 
  many movies and series are also available on free streaming sites . 
  everyone does it without any problems . 
  no worries . 
  media companies can not get customer info from internet service providers in hungary since giving out such info is against privacy laws here , unless requested by a court order . 
  germany is really an exceptional country in this regard that private media production companies can get the private details belonging to ip addresses from isps ... 
  1 . the - unk / - \u00fcnk possessive suffix never goes with a - j - . 
  also , `` foci '' has back vowel harmony . 
  but anyway it ends in a vowel so it 's just - nk : `` focink '' = `` our football '' . 
  2 . it 's not a possessive in this sentence ( as istencsaszar already pointed out ), 
   what is the difference between sok and sokkal ? 
  last time we talked about '' \u00e9vvel ezel\u0151tt '' , this is basically the same thing , sokkal = by a lot . 
  literally , `` it 's more popular * by * a lot '' , i.e. 
  `` much more popular '' . 
  when specifying the difference between two things in this way ( the amount by which something is more/less/bigger / smaller/forward/backward / before/after etc. 
  ) , you have to use the - val / - vel suffix . 
  - `` unfortunately the belgians shot four more goals than the hungarians . '', 
  ( literally : by-four more ) . 
   `` i do n't know if they always play well , but this year they are . '', 
  well , 480p is okay if the alternative is not getting to watch the thing or having to pay 800 $ for getting caught torrenting . 
  but anyway `` when in rome , do as the romans do '' , so if you 're in germany ask your friends and acquaintances how they manage . 
  afaik most use streaming sites like kinox.to and similar . 
   how do hungarians read the year ? 
  same as simply the number . 
  there 's no special way of saying years . 
  so 1989 is `` ezerkilencsz\u00e1znyolcvankilenc '' . 
  ( the reason for the dash in the latter but not in the former is a quite stupid spelling rule that says that numbers * above 2000 * , when spelled out , need a dash after every group corresponding to 3 digits , so after the thousands , millions etc , like : \u00f6tvenk\u00e9tmilli\u00f3-sz\u00e1znegyvennyolcezer-\u00f6tsz\u00e1znegyvenkett\u0151 = 52\u00a0148\u00a0542 ; the idea being that years would look clumsy if written like ezer-kilencsz\u00e1znyolvcankilenc , apparently the makers of this rule did n't anticipate that the above-2000 numbers will also become year numbers at some point ... 
  they should have pushed the limit to 10 thousand . ), 
   what is the difference between alkotm\u00e1ny and alapt\u00f6rv\u00e9ny ? 
  it 's basically the same thing with a different word . 
  previously it was officially called alkotm\u00e1ny ( `` constitution '' ) , now it 's called alapt\u00f6rv\u00e9ny ( `` basic law '' in the official english version ) . 
  the terminology comes from the german word grundgesetz by which they refer to their constitution ( but they also use verfassung , which is more literally `` constitution '' ) . 
  wikipedia has [ some more info ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basic_law ) . 
  but actually what wikipedia writes does n't really fit the hungarian case . 
  this terminology definitely does n't refer to anything provisional , it 's just an attempt at aping germany . 
   but does that mean `` form of state '' or better said angolul - `` form of government ? '', 
  yep . 
   does the whole sentence say `` it 's form of state ( government ) is a republic ? '', 
  `` k\u00e9t '' is only used as a determiner , i mean only when you say two something , like `` two apples '' , `` two people '' . 
  if you say two in any other context ( i.e. 
  when there 's no noun phrase coming after it immediately ) , then it 's always `` kett\u0151 '' . 
  so therefore only `` ezerhatsz\u00e1zkett\u0151 '' is good as the name for the year . 
  ( but you can say `` ezerhatsz\u00e1zk\u00e9t \u00e9vvel ezel\u0151tt '' = 1602 years ago , because in this case the number is immediately followed by the noun phrase '' \u00e9v '' ) . 
  nope , it makes absolutely no sense . 
  give something from your own country . 
  the whole point is that you introduce them to some specialty that you know but they do n't . 
  if you give them tokaji they might think you 're not completely sane . 
   ` n\u00e9gy ' and ` h\u00e9t ', 
  of couse it 's ` k\u00e9t ' and ` h\u00e9t ' that are too similar . 
  just to avoid confusion for learners reading this . 
  yeah , even more confusingly , `` hell\u00f3 '' in hungarian can also mean both `` hello '' and `` bye '' . 
  the meaning is not transparent to modern speakers . 
  it 's just a single word that means rainbow , without any other transparent meaning . 
  but if you 're interested in the etymology : - v\u00e1ny is a noun-forming suffix and the `` sziv\u00e1r - `` part comes from the verb `` sz\u00edv '' ( to suck ; see also the verb `` sziv\u00e1rog '' = to leak , to ooze ) . 
  so etymologically speaking , literally it 's something like `` oozement '' . 
  it does n't really make too much sense , but as i said , we do n't really see this meaning in the word , it 's just one structureless word that simply means `` rainbow '' to native speakers . 
   this sentence means `` the ruined pubs in pest - everyone ( all over hungary , not just the ones living in pest ) knows about them . 
  you are ** wrong ** . 
  - in pest , everyone knows the famous ruin pubs . 
  or in more natural english : everyone in pest knows the famous ruin pubs . 
  in `` natural '' hungarian sentences words that specify location ( like `` pesten '' here ) are connected to the verb of the sentence . 
  so the meaning is that the `` knowing '' takes place in pest . 
  so it 's not really about `` everyone in pest '' or `` the ruin pubs in pest '' but it 's rather `` knows in pest '' that belongs together . 
  even if you reorder the words , the natural interpretation is that pesten modifies the verb , not any of the nouns as it is usual in english . 
  strictly speaking , if you reorder it as `` mindenki ismeri a h\u00edres romkocsm\u00e1kat pesten '' , then it 's ambiguous and pesten can refer to the ruin pubs , but then it rather feels like a poor translation from english . 
  if you want to attach `` in pest '' to nouns , it would be most natural in hungarian to use `` pesti '' ( `` pester '' , adjective meaning `` from/of/in pest '' , like `` new yorker '' ) :, 
  minden pesti ismeri a h\u00edres romkocsm\u00e1kat - all pest residents know the famous ruin pubs, 
  mindenki ismeri a h\u00edres pesti romkocsm\u00e1kat - everyone knows the famous ruin pubs in/of pest . 
  or : everyone knows the famous `` pester '' ruin pubs . 
  as others said , it 's a combination of factors . 
  hungarians ( and i guess to some extent other eastern europeans as well ) are generally more grumpy than western europeans or americans . 
  statistically we are one of the unhappiest nations ( and we often come out as number 1 ) . 
  waiters often make very little money , and while `` money does n't make you happy '' is believable for someone with a good standard of living , people feel different if they actually get paid so little . 
  of course you can bring africa or india as counterexamples that it 's possible to be cheerful while poor but hungarians like to compare themselves with the west . 
  but in general , hungarians have to learn to become more resilient in this sense while growing up because strangers simply are n't as nice to each other as in other countries . 
  to us scandinavians and americans often seem quite naive and innocent when they expect such friendliness and goodwill from everyone . 
  of course nowadays you can find many restaurants with a mentality that 's more compatible with the expectations of better-off western europeans , but you have to find them in advance . 
  that 's not the official site . 
  [ this is the official one ] ( http://latogatokozpont.parlament.hu/nyitolap?p_p_id=82&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;_82_struts_action=%2flanguage%2fview&amp;_82_redirect=%2fnyitolap&amp;_82_languageid=en_gb ), 
  i 'm not exactly sure what would be a good example phrase for this . 
  can you give us some examples from other languages ( perhaps even english ) that could be used for a similar purpose ? 
   the ones who pass do n't go around telling the internet that . 
  not only the internet , it 's in person , too , and not only about the medical university . 
  we have a strong complaining culture here in hungary and people who fail exams like to make it seem like it was some totally impossible unfair thing but they are just perfect ... 
  the people who are on the right track and are productive do n't go around telling everyone how hard it is , scaring the new batch of students every year . 
  also , somehow most of the `` mentor '' students that help the young ones come from the hardly-stumbling-through group and not the best students , so new students usually interact with and get their first impressions from the mediocre-to-low-performance students . 
  good to hear that you enjoyed your stay !, 
   which non-budapest places would you recommend ? 
  * lake balaton is nice and there are good hiking areas just north of it . 
  * of cities/towns i can recommend p\u00e9cs , eger , esztergom , debrecen, 
   can anyone tell me what else i might expect ? 
  what you listed and political gatherings and speeches . 
   is it a somber day or a day of celebration , or even something else entirely ? 
  not really either of those . 
  it 's a commemoration of an ultimately failed revolution so it 's not a `` fun '' day , but it 's also not really sad because it 's the day when the revolution started , not when it was crushed , so it 's more about remembering the great heroism and bravery of the revolutionaries . 
  and 10th of the 2006 events . 
  just go to the closest telekom or vodafone or telenor store and get it there . 
  their prices are not too different .
