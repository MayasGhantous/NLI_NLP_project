  recently at telekom i paid about 5000 huf , of which 2700 is usable for calls/data . 
  just use common sense . 
  bullet points for lists , paragraphs for blocks of text ( sentences ) . 
  for example you can use bullet points for the list of previous studies , employment history etc. 
  and paragraphs about motivation . 
  why would anyone give you ( a stranger ) a discount on the market price ? 
  just because reddit ? 
  not just one of hundreds but the official one as well, 
  telekom , vodafone and telenor are the mobile service providers . 
  walk in any of them and you can buy a sim for about 2500 huf and you can buy monthly data packages of various sizes . 
  no contract . 
  it just gets deactivated after a year of not putting more money on it . 
  you 'll have to give an id ( or passport ) when you buy a sim card . 
  it 's not like in germany for instance where you can simply buy it in a supermarket . 
  we have a higher vat ( 27 % ) than the netherlands ( 21 % ) , so that 's part of it . 
  if you feel you 're better/deserve better than the random lonely-planet-tourist then you 'll need to put some energy in researching . 
  people who find interesting things * off the beaten path * do n't just wait for others to tell them where to go . 
  this is the budapest sub . 
  i 'm quite sure it 's '' ... white * bart * on the right and the left cheek '', 
  `` bart '' being the german word for `` beard '' . 
  he probably knew german and mixed up the languages . 
  but the gdp is a concept that 's really * defined * , it 's not just some vague notion . 
  the fallacy of `` arguing * by definition * '' applies when people take already existing everyday concepts and then they conjure up an artificial definition for them and then do some reasoning based on this definition and then go on to apply their conclusions to the natural , everyday sense of the concept . 
  that 's invalid , because the reasoning was done on the artificial definition and nothing is known about the actual correspondence of that definition and the usual everyday sense . 
  but the gdp is not a natural concept . 
  it is a calculated quantity that you calculate based on a definition . 
  not sure about your experience but bme ( budapest technical uni ) loaded us quite continuously as well , with homeworks , midterm tests ( ` zh ' ) . 
  in fact for us the exam time was usually the part of the year with less pressure . 
  it 's ` laska ' . 
  examples :, 
  we use a decimal comma instead of a point , so it 's like in english `` 72.000 '' . 
  with zeros it 's somewhat unusual , but perhaps it was something like `` 72,567 milli\u00e1rd '' ( 72.567 billion ) . 
  the right order of magnitude would be definitely around `` 72 milli\u00e1rd '' ( 72 billion ) rather than 72,000,000,000,000 ) . 
  it depends on a lot of stuff . 
  you should ask at bme what their conditions are . 
  as someone already wrote , probably it 's easier to just quit the uni of duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros and apply to bme just as any beginning student would ( as if you had n't done your semester in duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros at all ) . 
  then if you 're lucky , some of your credits from your duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros semester might be transferred , depending on the decision of the faculty ( they decide on a case by case basis by looking at the curriculum , your results etc. ) . 
  there 's a high chance that they do n't accept * anything * from duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros and you have to start from scratch at bme . 
  still , if you think you have the abilities/required points/etc . 
  to study at bme , the best and strongest technical university of hungary , then by all means go for it and forget the university of duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros . 
  they are not even comparable . 
  i 'd also consider not even starting in duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros , since it may be all in vain . 
  you could spend that time on something else ( language learning , travelling , whatever ) . 
  there 's a reason that tourists do n't go where they do n't go . 
  as for price , probably all bars are quite affordable for someone from western europe or north america ( beer around 1.5-2 $ ) . 
  the bars that are cheap by local standards ( beer around or under 1 $ ) would not fit your expectations . 
  ( smells not as nice , people are not ` cool ' , but local workers , alcoholics , homeless etc. ), 
  but if you * really * want to go somewhere that 's frequented by local ` non-cool ' blue collar workers and homeless-looking people , you can just look for the word `` boroz\u00f3 '' and a non-fancy entrance . 
  this is one example : http://budai-bohem.hupont.hu/2/galeria they wo n't speak english . 
  i 'd recommend going to the better known somewhat more expensive ones . 
  there will be plenty of young locals besides the tourists . 
  i know what you asked , i 'm just trying to explain how bars are here . 
  if you say cheap bar that 's not frequented by tourists , then here in ` eastern europe ' it means something else than what it means in richer places . 
  the type of bar that 's cheap here does n't even exist in western europe . 
  so here , the bars that you 'd want to go to will be those that other tourists also want to go to as well . 
  but it wo n't just be tourists , there will be locals as well and they will speak english , unlike in the cheap places . 
  and again , basically all bars are cheap compared to western europe or north america ( i 'm assuming based on statistics that you may come from there ) . 
  instead of cringing so hard you could have actually written the difference between today 's czech rep. and bohemia . 
  it would have been a lot less smug . 
   i remember this rotating display where a fascist uniform was slowly replaced by a communist one, 
  if you read the text there , it actually symbolizes how the same low-to-middle apparatus served the communists as the nazis . 
  in other words , the very same people worked on both systems , they quickly changed uniform and went on to a different ideology . 
  it suggests indeed that these ideologies came from the outside and people on the lower levels of the hierarchy did n't really want either of them , but they followed whatever was imposed from above . 
  yes it is the most common criticism of this museum ( mostly from western europeans ) , that it puts the communist dictatorship on equal footing with the nazi dictatorship . 
  obviously western europeans have a very different perception of communism , since they did n't have to go through it . 
  but i find this debate a rather distasteful . 
  we should n't have to compete about when and who had to suffer more . 
   faculty of electrical engineering and informatics, 
  of what university ? 
  probably bme ( budapest university of technology and economics ) ? 
  if yes , then it 's quite good ( the best in hungary ) . 
  it 's not exceptional in international comparison , but definitely accepted anywhere . 
  depends on the region . 
  for me ` maga ' sounds more distant and rude-ish . 
  for example i ca n't imagine '' \u00d6n '' with cursing or shouting , but ` maga ' fits such situations . 
  yeah , they should use `` sz\u00e1rmazik '' . 
  no , it really is ' \u00faj ' + ' - ra ' ( think of english `` anew '' ) . 
  there are other examples for the use of the - ra / - re suffix in this sense . 
  like `` harmadszorra '' = `` the third time '' ( i.e. 
  when something is done on the third occasion , like `` ezt m\u00e1r harmadszorra mondom neked '' = `` i 'm already telling you this the third time ! '' ) . 
  do n't try to think too much into it , the meaning of these case suffixes are somewhat unpredictable in such idiomatic uses . 
  you just have to memorize them . 
  i just do n't get how this happens with an automatic . 
  with manual transmission i can at least imagine that one might accidentally let go of the clutch and jump forward with the car , but with an automatic one has to actively stomp on the gas pedal ... did she try to use the brake pedal and accidentally pushed the gas or how does this even happen ? 
  the actual original correct spelling is `` baszd meg '' ( fuck it/him/her ; actually ` fuck her ' since it comes from `` baszd meg az any\u00e1d '' ` fuck your mother ' ) . 
  it 's the imperative 2nd person singular definite form of `` megbasz '' ( to fuck someone ) . 
  but now it 's become just a way of cursing , so the way `` kind of '' becomes `` kinda '' or `` hell of a '' is sometimes written `` helluva '' and so on , we now often write `` bazmeg '' . 
  `` bassz meg '' would mean `` fuck me '' , so it 's probably a typo or written by someone who does n't know how to write correctly ( unsurprisingly it 's not the most intelligent people who scatter this word around the most on the internet ) . 
  additionally , the `` mind a ( z ) [ sz\u00e1m ] '' form is also correct with 2 and 3 , so `` mind a kett\u0151 '' and `` mind a h\u00e1rom '' are also correct ( besides `` mindkett\u0151 '' and `` mindh\u00e1rom '' ) . 
  there 's a difference between these two :, 
  - the system in hungary was communism ( which is false ), 
  - the leadership of hungary was communist ( which is true ), 
  being communist means that you believe that communism is/would be/will be a good system and you 're striving to achieve communism . 
  but , this is actually only this clear cut from inside of the communist ideology . 
  for the outside world , like the us and other first world nations , they called it all simply communism . 
  and even in hungary we have stuff like `` a kommunizmus \u00e1ldozatainak eml\u00e9knapja '' ( memorial day of the victims of communism ) even though it was n't `` really '' communism by the then official ideology . 
  it was pretty earth shattering that the shelves in the stores were n't empty any more . 
  like you could finally buy stuff . 
  like meat . 
  you did n't have to know the butcher , make a deal weeks before , so that you could get some good meat for a special occasion .
