  actually english tenses are also more difficult than an english native speaker would imagine . 
  actually ( at least in the past tense ) english tenses and hungarian coverbs often express similar things . 
  the general idea being that the meg - version would be a perfect tense and the non-meg version a continuous one . 
  but of course it 's not always true , just as the general thrust of things !, 
  hungary 's foundation year is regarded 895 ( earlier it was considered as 896 ) . 
  that 's the foundation of the principality of hungary ( magyar fejedelems\u00e9g ) . 
  1000 or 1001 is the coronation of stephen i and the foundation of the kingdom of hungary . 
  this is why there were such huge celebrations in 1896 , for the thousandth anniversary . 
  i only have wikipedia at the moment , it says in hungarian :, 
  and history books also share this view . 
  it 's regarded as the first hungarian state . 
  it shared a lot . 
  it was ruled by the same family , the \u00c1rp\u00e1ds . 
  the last grand prince was stephen , who then became king . 
  the previous ? 
  his father . 
  there was full continuity . 
  yeah it was a transformation , but so was the habsburgs taking over , or the creation of austria-hungary , or the dissolution of it . 
  or the commies taking over , or the 1989 change . 
  nevertheless we still consider it as the same hungary . 
  ( except for the slovaks , who regard post-trianon hungary as a totally new thing and have a different name for it ) . 
  what is rightist in this ? 
  you mean the last part about slovaks disputing that pre - and post-trianon hungary are the same entity ? 
  read up on it , it 's true . 
  even in english , you have `` recommend '' , `` suggest '' , `` propose '' etc. 
  in many cases `` aj\u00e1nl '' and `` javasol '' are interchangeable , but have a bit different connotations . 
  for example , `` aj\u00e1nl '' fits better , when there 's an implied threat ( i suggest you do this , * or else ... !! * ) . 
  but this is not always implied , it depends on context , intonation . 
  it can also simply mean recommend , but it 's more emotional . 
  for example `` i wholeheartedly recommend '' would be `` teljes sz\u00edvemb\u0151l aj\u00e1nlom '' rather than `` javaslom '' . 
  `` javasol '' sounds more neutral , distant , unemotional , factual , formal . 
  i also do n't understand this . 
  i 've never driven an automatic car ( i 'm from hungary ) , but i see this very often in this sub and i just do n't get it . 
  the similarity is pretty small : both have a high number of case suffixes , have possessive suffixes , and vowel harmony . 
  but the common ancestor language of hungarian and finnish , called proto-finno-ugric , was spoken roundabout 4000 years ago . 
  which is a pretty long time for languages to diverge . 
  i remember we learned the cpr pushing frequency as 100 per minute , the beat of `` staying alive '' by the bee gees . 
  compared to that he pushed much much faster . 
  i can refer back to [ this comment of mine ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/hungarian/comments/510ije/need_help_with_coverbs_megel/d795wla ) , including that it 's not just completedness , but instantaneousness . 
  megn\u00e9z is something like `` check out '' or observe to find out something one wants to know . 
  `` megn\u00e9zi az \u00e1rakat '' suggests that he purposefully checks out the prices because he wants to know the prices . 
  `` n\u00e9zi az \u00e1rakat '' is more `` he 's looking at the prices '' , which could also be a blank stare , not a purposeful way of collecting information . 
  - we do n't care how he does it , what he writes in what place , we simply describe this as one action without regard to its `` internal structure '' . 
  he does this whole complete action of making the bill . 
  - he * is preparing * the bill . 
  although it sounds a bit off . 
  to make this version more natural , you 'd have to put something like '' \u00e9pp most '' in there , like `` az elad\u00f3 \u00e9pp most k\u00e9sz\u00edti a sz\u00e1ml\u00e1t . '', 
  to say that he 's doing it right now . 
  but you can not always translate a lack of coverb to a continuous tense . 
  you asked about k\u00e9rdez vs megk\u00e9rdez some time ago i think . 
  it again suggests the full nature of asking and getting a reply . 
  a whole encounter , a purposeful thing . 
  `` k\u00e9rdez '' alone is just `` to be in the middle of asking '' ( well , kind of ) , not this whole planned out complete thing . 
  and there 's also some grammaticality problem here . 
  if a verb has a possible coverb for use , then in this kind of word orders it has to appear . 
  in different word orders , it 's possible to go without it : `` azt akarja k\u00e9rdezni az elad\u00f3t\u00f3l , hogy ... '' = `` what he wants to ask from the clerk is ... '' . 
  i ca n't explain why this is the case . 
  i think the fundamental difference is how you view the nature of disease . 
  the woman was approaching it from the modern , scientific , biological view that diseases have real physical reasons . 
  it is simply the biological machinery of the organism that causes it . 
  ray comfort 's view is the traditional , pre-scientific view of disease as a curse , as something bolted on the body from the outside , something that 's non-physical , supernatural , like a punishment . 
  these are very different ways to approach it , and hence the miscommunication . 
  in the christian view , it 's not that the human body is a clumsily constructed machine that breaks when you have disease , rather humans are an originally perfect creation , but due to the original sin we now have extra suffering added onto our existence as a punishment . 
  so disease is `` not a bug but a feature '' . 
  no it 's not that simple . 
  there 's no one-sentence summary for it . 
  it 's a mixture of grammaticality ( word order , emphasis ) , meaning ( purpose ) , completedness and instantaneousness . 
  it 's not the same thing for every verb . 
  you have to learn the different shade of meaning for each verb separately . 
  there are only some tendencies and feelings and flavors and directions . 
  the `` grammar '' face of it is that it also depends on sentence structure . 
  so if the coverb would be somewhere at the end without much emphasis , then you can often leave it off . 
  * ne \u0151t k\u00e9rdezd , \u0151 nem tudja - do n't ask * him * , he does n't know . 
  ( could also be `` ne \u0151t k\u00e9rdezd meg '' , but it sounds a bit superfluous ), 
  ( i asked him what the time is ) . 
  somehow this second example works without meg - because the questioning did n't really succeed , did n't complete . 
  `` megmond '' feels somewhat more powerful , really laying down that thing on the table . 
  it implies that you think it was a conclusive telling . 
  you could also say `` mondtam , hogy hagyj b\u00e9k\u00e9n '' , but the version with meg - suggests more that you think the message should have gone through the first time because you unambiguously said it already in a conclusive way , done , period , no questions about it . 
  ( i 'm exaggerating a bit , but this is the general direction of the flavor ) . 
  there 's also `` elmond '' , which is emphasizes it more as a `` release '' of information . 
  it 's used usually when you previously did n't say it , kept the information to yourself ( maybe purposefully , maybe not purposefully , but it so happened ) . 
  for example with secrets , but not only . 
  it implies that you already knew the story before , you just have n't told it yet . 
  not because it 's a secret , but the point is that this is a first-time release of information . 
  it also implies that you will finish it to the end and tell the whole story . 
  but , for some reason `` mondok neked egy t\u00f6rt\u00e9netet '' also works . 
  i ca n't really explain why . 
  sorry , but it 's like this . 
  you have to keep in mind that languages are not designed by engineers , there are many things that do n't have clear-cut definitions and rules . 
  yeah , the hard parts are not where people expect them . 
  i mean that 18 ( or 34 or whatever number ) cases seem scary when you come from learning german or latin or polish , but the difficulty in hungarian is not there . 
  i think the most challenging things are word order , definite/indefinite conjugation , coverbs . 
  even more challenging if you have to learn it in a rule-based way out of books . 
  i think the only way people learn this is though immersive learning , i.e. 
  being actually surrounded by it in everyday life . 
  `` megbesz\u00e9l\u00e9s '' is more like a discussion with an agenda , like a work meeting . 
  `` megbesz\u00e9l '' means `` to discuss and arrive at a conclusion/solution '' . 
  `` besz\u00e9lget\u00e9s '' is just general conversation , when you sit down above a cup of coffee and chat about stuff . 
  the '' - get '' suffix mostly means that something is repetitive and happens over and over ( n\u00e9z = to look , n\u00e9zeget = to look again and again ) .
