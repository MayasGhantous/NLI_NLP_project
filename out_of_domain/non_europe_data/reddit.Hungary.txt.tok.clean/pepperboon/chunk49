  which is of course true , but the age-adjusted statistic tries to isolate the country 's effect and remove the age-effect . 
  imagine it with another cause of death , like heart attack . 
  without age adjustment countries that have more old people would top this statistic . 
  but it 's not because the country 's healthcare or eating habits or whatever , it 's simply due to the age distribution . 
  the question was `` thinking about languages other than your mother tongue , which two languages do you think are the most useful for your personal development ? '' . 
  so people could name two languages ( the order was n't relevant ) . 
  take hungary as an example . 
  for 64 % of the people , english was among the two named languages . 
  for 48 % of the people , german was among the two languages they named . 
  this map shows the language that appears the second most frequently in people 's answers . 
  hungarian text says, 
   out of order ( literally `` defective '' or `` bad '' ), 
   do n't piss in it !, 
  it 's a pretty frequent crime at this tram terminal station at night . 
  people from the city center fall asleep on the tram and then forget to get off the tram . 
  [ here 's another one at the same spot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daucdnmgpuw ) ( with included justice ), 
  [ and another one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpwlckcogaa ), 
  [ and yet another one without justice ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnpsrl9khpu ), 
  see my other comment in this thread . 
  they are not specifically going for this guy but there have been many similar cases recently . 
  so they watch the cctv very closely and if it happens the camera operator informs the cops who patrol around there . 
   `` szeretem '' then you have to add a noun after that , and if you use `` szeretek '' , you should add a verb . 
  not exactly . 
  the - m is used when there 's a definite object , - k when there 's an indefinite object or no object in the sentence . 
  but it 's true that such general actions like `` reading '' as a noun always have a definite article in hungarian ( * az * olvas\u00e1s ) , so one needs to use the definite conjugation ( - m ) . 
  because it would be obvious that german-poor is not really poor . 
  and then it would become a non-story . 
   although these days for gender some use ` gender ', 
  never heard this in normal , flowing hungarian speech . 
  it 's sometimes used like `` gender-elm\u00e9let '' ( gender theory ) , but i never heard it embedded in proper hungarian sentences , like `` mi a dzsendere ? 
  the equivalent hungarian phrase is `` t\u00e1rsadalmi nem '' ( social gender/sex ) as opposed to `` biol\u00f3giai nem '' ( biological gender/sex ) . 
  although afaik saying that one is biological and one is social is nowadays not politically correct anymore and the correct phrase is `` gender assigned at birth '' ( `` sz\u00fclet\u00e9skor kijel\u00f6lt nem '' ) for the one formerly called biological . 
   how did people back then envision birdseye view when painting, 
  people had built little city models before . 
  so it 's not like they could n't imagine it . 
  it 's the [ - kodik ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-kodik ) / - kedik / - k\u00f6dik suffix + - \u00e9s ( turns verbs into nouns , similar to english - ing ) . 
  - kodik / - kedik / - k\u00f6dik means `` to behave/act as ( a ) ... '' , `` to behave/act in a ... manner '' . 
  \u00fcgyeskedik = literally : to act handy/skillful/clever , idiomatically : to do kinda-illegal business for one 's own pocket , like `` optimizing '' taxes or similar things but it 's implied that it 's not a major crime, 
  \u00fcgyes is an adjective that has no direct equivalent in english . 
  it can refer to hand-dexterity and accomplishing other `` physical '' tasks or navigating situations well . 
  it 's basically the opposity of `` clumsy '' . 
  besz\u00e9d a pulpitusr\u00f3l : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7drgizjidhi, 
  they were probably referring to the concept of [ normal number ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/normal_number ) . 
  because those countries were under communist regimes from the end of world war 2 ( 1945 ) until around 1990 ( ~ plus/minus a few years ) . 
  they used a different economic model called socialism with planned economies , unlike western europe , which used a capitalist market economy . 
  over the decades this has created a huge discrepancy in economic performance between the two sides . 
  for europeans ( and i guess latin americans ) they are white , but americans consider `` latino '' / `` hispanic '' as a separate race and not `` white '' . 
  i 'm not american , and after reading some wikipedia it seems i was wrong at least about the official statistics . 
  i remembered seeing `` race : hispanic '' , but it seems hispanic is considered an ethnicity not a race in the us . 
  still , i heard from americans that they do n't consider people white that we in europe definitely would . 
  for example sometimes somewhat brownish tan-colored spanish people on vacation in the us are considered non-white and are surprised , while the definitely are white in europe . 
  you met hitler ? 
  * https://vs.hu, 
  the clause is considered definite , even if the * azt * is omitted ( it 's optional and just implied if omitted ) . 
  just a minor correction : a native speaker would say '' \u00c9rtem m\u00e1r . '', 
  or just '' \u00c9rtem . 
  '' , otherwise `` most '' would weirdly specifically talk about this very moment , not that `` from now on '' you understand it , but that you understand just now in this moment ( i.e. 
  you 'll perhaps forget ) . 
   you look and behave simiarlly so its easy to get confused, 
  that 's not true ... romanians look just like other non-gypsy people in this region . 
  also this looks like a troll comment ... 
  first part definitely `` eml\u00e9k\u00fcl dobai '', 
  then it 's definitely not magdika , because there 's no letter g there . 
  i think i 'm seeing a [ lower case r like this ] ( http://www.loopsandtails.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/r_index_thumb.png ) there . 
  i also ca n't see the beginning as an m , it 's more like a lowercase o and then two t 's or l 's . 
  looks like `` ottevdik '' ( makes no sense ) or `` ollarlik '' ( also nonsense ) . 
  very hard to decipher . 
  prefix by `` budapest '' , `` capital '' or `` metropolitan '' . 
  on their website it 's `` metropolitan ervin szabo library '' . 
  i 've read `` capital court '' for `` f\u0151v\u00e1rosi b\u00edr\u00f3s\u00e1g '' , too . 
  if you can perhaps take an even better photo or can scan it in higher resolution , maybe we could try and see more . 
  it 's hard to differentiate the specks and smears from the actual strokes in some places . 
  it was used between 1993-1998 . 
  the small 100 coin was introduced in 1996 . 
  i remember that as a kid i liked the new one a lot more . 
  two colors and if you put it in the freezer you can pop out the middle of it . 
  what is in your contract ? 
  10 mbps does n't sound too bad . 
  yeah , it 's all just `` coming soon '' . 
  most probably the author will lose interest soon and it will never be `` coming '' . 
  it 's a lot more fun to create a website than to actually keep it maintained with events and new info . 
  ( sorry to be pessimistic ), 
  the cheapest kind of bleach ( sodium hypoclorite ) is called `` hip\u00f3 '' or `` hypo '' . 
  looks like [ this ] ( http://www.magicmix.hu/termekek/b02.gif ) and it 's extremely cheap , about 50-100 huf/liter , or about 25 euro cents/liter . 
   strange how it resembles the 1 euro , dunno if on purpose, 
  the euro was introduced in 2002 , while this 100 ft coin in 1996 . 
  but there are other bimetallic coins around the world , so the idea is not our invention . 
  for me k\u00e1v\u00e9h\u00e1z seems more `` majestic '' and elegant , and k\u00e1v\u00e9z\u00f3 feels a bit more casual . 
  but it 's not a big difference , it 's just a bit different `` feel '' . 
  i was so confused when people referred to cinemas as `` theaters '' in english . 
  in hungarian we do n't use the same word for cinemas and ( live-acting ) theaters . 
  ( technically , `` filmsz\u00ednh\u00e1z '' exists for cinema , but it 's a very formal and rare term ) . 
  as for the purpose of `` meg - '' , you already got several answers in your previous threads to the exact same question . 
  i suggest that you review those threads . 
  as for the word order , there are certain constructs when the coverb comes after the verb . 
  it 's a bit complicated , but mainly it happens when something is pulled into focus ( a stressed part at the beginning of the sentence ) . 
  an example is questions , when the part like `` milyen filmet '' must be in the beginning and this sends the `` meg '' to the end . 
  in the other example the `` egy cs\u00edkos nyakkend\u0151t '' part is pulled to the front to the focus position . 
  otherwise it would be `` a f\u00e9rfi megk\u00f6t egy cs\u00edkos nyakkend\u0151t '' . 
  but the focus must always be directly before the main verb , without coverb .
