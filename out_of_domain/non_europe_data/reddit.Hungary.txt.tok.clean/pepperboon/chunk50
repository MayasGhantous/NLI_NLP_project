  so the coverb goes after the verb . 
  most people do n't even know or care about what goes on in turkey/syria . 
  and even if some people are against what the us government does , it has nothing to do with the individual average american . 
  zero worries . 
  have a good time !, 
  nah , the conclusions are wrong . 
  the real conclusion is : do n't go to bars and restaurants in the v\u00e1ci street area and do n't trust `` sudden friends '' from nowhere on the street . 
  also , read a short tourist guide about potential issues before travelling . 
   always ask to look at the menu , the prices before you order . 
  this is good and should be obvious . 
   specifically in budapest , if there are stairs down leading to the bar , beware . 
  ridiculous , just because this particular bar had stairs , it means nothing . 
  they can do it in a non-stair place and stair places can also be great . 
   if you see an atm in the place as well , just get on out of there . 
  not necessarily . 
   if you sense anything amiss , do n't be afraid to be `` rude . '', 
  yeah , just do n't be naive in general . 
   do n't underestimate the potential of the uggos . 
  it 's like a change-up in baseball , meant to throw you off your rhythm . 
  as cocojumbo123 said , it 's to make it the scam look more realistic . 
  that 's one factor . 
  there can be others . 
  for example coming from a smaller town where people can trust each other more . 
  he just wants to be nice and not be rude . 
  if the girls are good at it , they wo n't do it in a very very obvious way and try to make it seem spontaneous . 
  first it 's just a nice chitchat like the one you had back in your hostel , then some smiling , laughing , `` why not go for a drink '' etc. 
  especially if you 're not really experienced , you may fall for it . 
  you know , perhaps the local culture is like this , who knows ? 
  you 're in a foreign country , `` when in rome ... '' . 
  or he might think the girls really find him interesting for some reason . 
  perhaps because he 's from a richer , `` higher-level '' country or an exotic country , and so he supposes the girls want to get to know him . 
  there 's this trope going around that eastern european girls will jump on you if you 're a rich american tourist , because greatest country , freedom , higher status , etc. . 
  the end of a word stem and the start of a suffix assimilate in such cases , so `` kertje '' is pronounced as if it was `` kertye '' and '' \u00e9ljen '' is pronounced '' \u00e9jjen '' . 
  ( ly and j are pronounced the same in standard hungarian ) . 
  but if it 's a compound word or a verb prefix border then no such assimilation happens : elj\u00f6n is * not * ejj\u00f6n ( only in fast speech ) and \u00e1tj\u00f6n does n't become '' \u00e1tty\u00f6n '' ( unless you talk really fast ) . 
  so it depends . 
  the hood has a curved edge there and there 's enough space there under the hood to look through . 
  see at 0:26 . 
  yeah , it 's usually difficult for foreigners to figure this out who are n't used to such `` medieval '' mechanical contraptions , 
  [ here 's a picture ] ( http://m.cdn.blog.hu/va/vastagbor/image/2010/11/lyukaszt%c3%b3.jpg ) . 
  on the top you see that red thing whose black top part is where you put in the ticket and then you pull that black thing towards yourself . 
  that is the handle we 're talking about . 
  the one on the bottom is the automatic one . 
  zsuzsa is that girl with whom you want to go to the cinema . 
  in english it 's more natural to say `` zsuzsa is the girl ... '' , but in hungarian this is considered as a `` pointing '' to * that * girl . 
  it 's a difference in the `` logic '' of the two languages . 
  in hungarian , if we continue with a relative clause then the noun phrase often has a demonstrative pronoun - and an article - before it ( `` that x , which is ... '' ) and not just an article ( `` the x , which is '' ) . 
  this is especially the case if this noun phrase is [ the complement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/complement_ ( linguistics % 29 ) of the sentence . 
  but it also works ( to a certain degree ) without the demonstative pronoun ( zsuzsa a l\u00e1ny , akivel ... ) , but it sounds somewhat less natural . 
  your version of in the bonus question means :, 
  `` it was at that time that i was at the balaton , from where mr. newman went to eger . '', 
  it does n't really fit well . 
  it 's not incorrect , though , just not flowing very naturally . 
  with `` amikor '' it becomes `` i was at that time at the balaton , when mr. newman went to eger '' or `` it was at that time that i was at the balaton , when ( at which time ) mr. newman went to eger '' . 
  yeah , that 's right . 
  in general , hungarian sentences with relative clauses `` like '' to have both a demonstrative pronoun in the main clause and a relative pronoun in the relative clause . 
  they form a pair . 
  in english the relative pronoun often suffices and there is n't such a clear pair structure . 
  - i go [ there ] where i want . 
  - i eat [ that ] what i want, 
  * \u0150 * az * a l\u00e1ny , * aki * ... - she is the girl , who / she is [ that ] girl , who, 
  i can see how `` az az az alma '' can seem weird , but it 's actually correct and sounds normal in hungarian . 
  it does match . 
  - i like the/those apples that are red . 
  what 's not declined is the definite article ` a ' / ` az ' . 
  ah , but that is not accusative in the main clause . 
  when you say `` this is the laptop '' then the laptop is not the object of the sentence . 
  if i say `` i see the laptop '' then it is the object , so it would be in accusative in hungarian . 
  but `` this is x '' is simply nominative . 
  in the relative clause the relative pronoun is in the accusative case because it is the object in the relative clause , because it is bought . 
  the buying acts on it . 
  this is the same in every language i know that marks the accusative , it 's not hungarian-specific . 
  or in english `` he , whom i see , is tall '' . 
  not `` him , whom i see , is tall '' . 
  in the relative clause `` whom '' is accusative because it is the object of the seeing , but in the main clause ( `` he is tall '' ) `` he '' is not accusative as it 's not the object . 
  the reverse situation also exists . 
  - i buy the laptop that is good . 
  here the `` az a laptop '' becomes accusative because it 's the object of the main clause ( it 's being bought ) , but in the relative clause it 's nominative because it 's not the object . 
  * i see him , who is tall . 
  * not `` i see him , whom is tall '' , nor `` i see he , who is tall '' . 
  the declensions do n't need to match , they are independent . 
  `` swiss '' and `` swede '' are a bit more similar than the country names . 
  use [ oldhungarian.eu ] ( http://oldhungarian.eu/index_en.html ) to transcribe from latin to old hungarian alphabet . 
  magad and magadat are both correct in this sentence ( mta-approved too ) . 
  nah , yours was perfect , too . 
  stupid question , but how does this work ? 
  does insurance pay more money than the actual damage ? 
  do n't they just pay the repair costs ? 
  or does the driver know some car repair shop that will lie and state higher costs than the actual and then they split the profit ? 
  how do people make money off this ? 
   as i see on tv , you 're full with that fine white powder that the north and south pole is full of . 
  shovel , you stinky lazy pigs . 
  hard to understand the point without context . 
  christmas is considered a family holiday around here , when people are at home first and then visit relatives . 
  it 's not a time of doing stuff in the city , and workers also deserve to have this holiday so that 's why most things will be dead . 
  `` gell\u00e9rt hill '' is not unusual to read . 
  not really . 
  there 's no such intent from the hungarian side since decades . 
  moving borders is always a very big deal because it 's seen as breaking the status quo , creating a precedent for separatism around europe etc. 
  also , as you can see , the hungarian majority part would an exclave , not connected to the border with hungary .
