  it 's not really practical to have an exclave like that inside another country . 
  what the sz\u00e9kely would like is to have an autonomous region within romania , similar to south tyrol in italy which used to be part of austria before wwi . 
  this autonomy initiative is supported by all political powers in hungary , there 's a real consensus here . 
  autonomous regions based on the local autochtonous majority ethnicity is a very usual european institution , it 's not some radical thing . 
  and as i said , every political party supports it in hungary including liberals , socialists , greens , conservatives , radicals etc. 
  where i live ( hungary ) this is standard practice ( there was a government proposal to make it mandatory , i do n't remember if it passed , but people do it already ) . 
  if there 's very slow traffic ahead and abrupt braking is needed ( like suddenly 20 km/h after 110 km/h ) then we flash our hazards . 
  it 's very useful to see because i know i need to pay extra attention because something out of ordinary is happening on the highway , potentially an accident ahead etc. 
  brake lights are a usual sight , it might just mean that the car in front is just slightly slower . 
  extreme braking is better signalled by something additional . 
  brake lights do n't shout `` danger ! '' . 
  you see brake lights all the time and if you maintain proper distance ahead , you usually do n't need to brake every time the car in front of you touches the brakes ( less gas often suffices ) . 
  but if traffic is coming to a halt , that 's very unusual and needs more attention and focus and getting more and earlier info is crucial in those cases . 
  haragos pista is great . 
  but it 's much much harder to just eat it out of the glass . 
  they say it 's 4 times as strong as er\u0151s pista . 
  weed is considered a drug here and is illegal . 
  of course people still do drugs , especially at places like festivals , just keep in mind that it 's illegal and exercise caution . 
  this is why passing on the right is illegal in many countries ( not sure about the us , but it sure is in hungary ) . 
  i learned about the existence of black friday some 2 years ago or so . 
  as others said it , there are some webshops and electronics stores that have some deals , but most people have no idea when black friday even is ( i would also have to look it up ) , so we do n't really prepare for it like in the us . 
  there are often pre-chrismas deals , but not really tied to just one specific day . 
  yes , although by law the car on the shoulder should have been marked with an emergency warning triangle at a proper distance . 
  first of all , folk music often uses dialects and archaic phrasing and poetic language so i think it is n't really ideal for language learners . 
   first , what is the ending on tolvaj and what does it mean ? 
  i can tell tolvajok is plural , so what is ( k ) \u00e9nt ? 
  '' - k\u00e9nt '' means `` as '' , i.e. 
  `` we live as thieves '' . 
   second , what is n\u00e9k\u00fcnk ? 
  is that some kind of alternative form of nek\u00fcnk ? 
  yes , it 's a dialectal form . 
   but the dictionary is giving the full verb as `` megk\u00f6ny\u00f6r\u00fcl vkin , '' and if my assumption holds true , then it 's being used here as `` megk\u00f6ny\u00f6r\u00fcl vkinek . '', 
  so which should it be ? 
  the standard version is `` vkin '' . 
  i 've never heard the `` vkinek '' version , it must be regional/dialectal . 
  but it 's not hard to understand by analogy with `` megkegyelmez vkinek '' ( have mercy on someone / pardon someone ) or `` megbocs\u00e1t vkinek '' ( forgive someone ) . 
   the conjugtion though makes it look like the command is directed at god , like `` god - you do n't suffer any more . '', 
  can anyone explain what 's going on here ? 
  it 's a `` third person command '' , in other words , imperative mood third person singular conjugation . 
  it 's not commanding god . 
  english does n't often use this construct , but it could be translated as `` may our people not suffer any longer ! '' . 
  it 's like `` may the force be with you '' or `` long live the king '' . 
  it 's commanding a third person , or rather expresses a wish that a third person should do something . 
  not the second person , i.e. 
  the person you 're talking to . 
   why did the writer switch from '' \u00f6n '' in the previous line to `` te '' in this one ? 
  the previous line was a third person singular command , not a formal second person singular , so there 's no switching here . 
  god is always talked to with the informal conjugation ( which predates the formal conjugation ) . 
   finally , what is the ending on csavarg\u00f3 ? 
  i 'm never seen `` v\u00e1 '' before and do n't understand what it does here . 
  it 's a case ending that expresses changing into x or becoming x. 
  you could think of it like this : '' - ba '' ( into ) is the same to '' - ban '' ( in ) as '' - v\u00e1 '' to '' - k\u00e9nt '' ( as ) . 
  it 's `` movement '' towards being in some state , but not physically . 
  in this case it means `` you turned us * into * vagabonds '' or `` you made us vagabonds '' . 
   first , what is the difference between mi and micsoda ? 
  my book says micsoda means `` what ( kind of ) ? '', 
  how is that any different from milyen ? 
  could you use milyen in this context ? 
  `` micsoda '' has different meanings . 
  first it 's just a version of what , but more `` emphasized '' . 
  it has more syllables so you can stress it better . 
  i could try to `` translate it '' as `` what thing '' . 
  in some cases leaving it as `` mi '' would make a dull and strange sentence . 
  for example there 's a book series from germany called `` was ist was ? '', 
  ( what is what ) explaining things for kids . 
  this title is translated as `` mi micsoda ? '', 
  not as `` mi mi ? '', 
  because that would sound clumsy and stupid . 
  the other meaning of `` micsoda '' is it 's use like an adjective . 
  `` micsoda mad\u00e1r '' could be translated as `` oh , what a bird !, 
  '' , being in awe . 
  so `` milyen '' can not be used as it 's not really asking for the description of the bird , it 's more like an exclamation about how great/special the bird is . 
   in the last line , why is it `` oda '' and not `` ott ? '', 
  i though `` oda '' implied movement and `` ott '' was location . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  actually `` vhova v\u00e1r '' is not really used much in the standard variety nowadays . 
  but it means that someone is expecting / awaiting someone to go * to somewhere * . 
  but again , it 's a bit dated / poetic sounding . 
  '' - k\u00e9nt '' and `` mint '' are very similar , but since they do n't fit into the same position in sentences . 
  the version with `` mint '' results in a longer , multi-word expression that just does n't sound as well in `` mint tolvajok \u00e9l\u00fcnk '' . 
  there 's also a slight difference , that `` mint '' often means `` in the role of x '' or `` given that he is an x '' . 
  there are also two versions of `` mint '' , one that starts a new relative clause and one that is basically like a preposition . 
  so when you say '' \u00dagy \u00e9l\u00fcnk , mint a tolvajok '' , then this mint is not really the same grammatically as your `` mint tolvajok \u00e9l\u00fcnk '' . 
   also , if micsoda is a word , is kicsoda also one ? 
  i 'm not sure what it would mean - `` wow , who he is ! '', 
  but that sounds weird , at least if i 'm trying to think about an english translation . 
  anyway , just wondering . 
  the two meanings of `` micsoda '' should be handled separately :, 
  1 . first simply a multi-syllable variant of `` mi '' , that you use so that it 's heard easier and so that you can intonate it more , it fits better into short sentences . 
  for this , there 's an analogous `` kicsoda '' . 
  2 . an adjective-like use , meaning `` oh what a. . . '' for this meaning there 's no corresponding `` kicsoda '' version . 
  true . 
  as a curiosity though , we had a [ round but non-roundabout intersection ] ( http://korforgalom.hu/lanchid1.jpg ) where incoming vehicles from a certain direction had the right of way . 
  but it 's been converted to a real roundabout with the usual rules now . 
   we only have a few roundabouts ,, 
  this is always so strange to hear , as my small town in hungary has more than 20 roundabouts in an approx one-mile-radius circle ( [ see this google earth screenshot ] ( http://imgur.com/9kisqst ) ) . 
   often looking alike, 
  i also had this experience with german ( and to a smaller extent with english ) . 
  this effect seems similar to how people of a race other than yours `` look alike '' to some extent . 
  i think you 'd have the same experience with other languages that are outside the indo-european family .
