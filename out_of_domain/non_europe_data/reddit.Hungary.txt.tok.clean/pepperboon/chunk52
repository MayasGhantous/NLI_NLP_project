  and also simply the sound patterns of the language can be unfamiliar . 
  like what consonants/vowels usually follow what other consonants/vowels , typical syllables etc. 
  therefore all the words look similar in their typical hungarianness and an english speaker has n't developed an ear for the internal differences . 
  it 's just the same unfamiliar patterns combined in different ways . 
  because the dubbing is just there to make it understandable to people , them speaking hungarian is not `` in universe '' so to speak . 
  the tranlation is `` transparent '' , we do n't pretend that the characters are speaking hungarian . 
  otherwise you 'd have to construct a whole alternate universe where the us for some reason speaks hungarian or where hungary somehow looks like the place in the movie ... 
  edit : but actually many times the dub tries to avoid this replacing `` english '' with `` our language '' . 
  like `` does he speak our language ? '', 
  instead of `` does he speak english ? '' . 
  for some people this may sound clumsier and more unnatural than straight up saying `` english '' . 
  others are more bothered by the discrepancy of saying `` english '' when the dub is in hungarian . 
  no easy solution here . 
  the only thing that never really happens in dubs is translating `` english '' as `` magyar '' . 
  here the emphasis is different . 
  the version with meg - emphasizes the actual completion of the action , that the thing got done instead of not done . 
  for example :, 
  - lilla did tell me that she 'll stay in budapest as well , but she did n't tell you ( most likely she hid this info from you purposefully ) . 
  - to me , lilla said that she 'll stay in budapest as well , but maybe she told other people otherwise / but maybe she 'll change her mind . 
  this shows a kind of reservation about the reliability of the information . 
  `` she 's not sure to stay in budapest , it 's simply that she told me so . 
  but it 's not conclusive evidence that it will happen that way . 
  if it does n't happen , do n't blame me , i 'm just saying what she told me . '', 
  megmond is also more often used with a fact that someone withheld for some time and then suddenly delivers this information . 
  it highlights that there was a conscious decision made to tell that fact as opposed to not tell the fact . 
  simply `` mond '' is just in general about saying the thing with your mouth . 
  it does n't highlight this contrast that is implied in `` megmond '' . 
  sorry to be vague , it 's a bit difficult to talk about such `` flavor differences '' between words . 
  there 's also `` elmond '' , which is somewhat similar to megmond , but it has a flavor in the direction of secrets or embarrassing information , or about telling a story , or explaining the backgrounds of something . 
  it 's a combination of the special `` mond '' - specific meaning-flavor of `` megmond '' vs. `` mond '' , the general completion-aspect of meg - and the typical hungarian sentence pattern , where in this case the meg - occupies the focus position , the same position that is occupied by `` azt '' in the other sentence ( `` nekem lilla * azt * mondta '' vs. `` nekem lilla * meg - * mondta ) . 
  if there 's nothing else in focus , then the verb `` likes '' to get a coverb , if the meaning also fits . 
  the sentence flows better that way . 
  i think it 's a really difficult area of hungarian and trying to solve these things consciously-rationally is quite hard . 
  ( i think hearing tons of such typical sentences is the only way ), 
  it 's more likely that your anecdote refers to hatvan town in pest county ( within the current borders of hungary ) . 
  it 's much bigger ( 20,000 pop ) compared to the tiny village in transylvania ( currently 180 people down from ~ 600 earlier ) . 
  it 's mainly an american thing that exorbitant , astronomical amounts of money can be obtained in similar cases . 
  in most countries you do get some money but not a fortune . 
  it 's not really a calm tone of voice around central europe ( i 'm hungarian ) . 
  we just tend to be less over-the-top in general than americans . 
  less of the `` oh my god , that 's sooo awesome !!! '', 
  and also less shrieking-freaking out . 
  why do n't the emergency vehicles use the shoulder in such cases ? 
  it seems much simpler . 
  with sirens of course . 
  seems much simpler and quicker . 
  `` saj\u00e1t '' is an adjective meaning `` own '' . 
  `` maga '' is ( besides being a formal `` you '' ) a reflexive pronoun . 
  the root of the confusion is that the two often end up being translated the same way in english , but these are different grammatical structures . 
  is literally `` excuse me , does the hotel have an own bathroom '' . 
  `` saj\u00e1t '' is and adjective describing `` f\u00fcr\u0151szob\u00e1ja '' . 
  `` mindennek megvan a maga ideje '' is literally `` everything has itself 's time '' . 
  `` a maga ideje '' is just a possessive structure like `` a dolog ideje '' the `` thing 's time '' . 
  `` a saj\u00e1t ideje '' could be used , too , but it sounds somewhat off , probably because this is a set expression ( and many similar ones too ) . 
  here could you replace `` mag\u00e1\u00e9ban '' with `` saj\u00e1t\u00e1ban ? '', 
  yes . 
  again the difference is the grammatical structure between `` himself 's '' vs. `` his own '' . 
  of course both actually end up being translated as `` his own '' in english , but they are different in hungarian . 
  they basically also mean essentially the same thing , just expressed differently . 
  could you replace `` maga '' with `` saj\u00e1t '' in this one ? 
  yes . 
  ( of course these are fixed sayings , so one has to use them as they are ) . 
   could i say something like `` nem , ki\u00edrom azt a maga tollommal ? '', 
  --  `` no , i 'll write it with my own pen . '', 
  ( no , i 'll write it with myself 's pen ) or `` nem , a saj\u00e1t tollammal \u00edrom le . '', 
  ( no , i 'll write it with my own pen ) . 
  you could even say `` nem , saj\u00e1t tollal \u00edrom le . '', 
  ( i 'll write it with [ an ] own pen - note the lack of any possessive but implying `` my '' ) . 
  when using the `` maga '' pronoun , it 's handled as a third person thing , that 's why it 's `` a magam toll\u00e1val '' and not `` a magam tollammal '' . 
  anyway , in this case the natural way to say it is `` a saj\u00e1t tollammal '' . 
  using `` magam '' here sounds weird and unusual , altough it 's grammatical and understandable . 
  also the definite article `` a '' must always appear before `` maga '' if you use it in possessive . 
  it ca n't be the indefinite article or no article . 
  is literally `` i have an own house '' . 
  but you ca n't say it with maga , because then you 'd have to use the definite article and it would turn the `` h\u00e1zam '' object into a definite expression and `` van '' ( ~ have ) does n't accept definite expressions ( as its grammatical subject ) only indefinite ones . 
  so you 'd have to use `` megvan '' , which does accept definite subjects . 
  we saw this already with `` mindennek megvan a maga ideje '' . 
  you could not say `` mindennek van a maga ideje '' , but you could say `` mindennek van saj\u00e1t ideje '' ( although its emphasis sounds weird for some reason , but that 's not important now ; it 's grammatically correct at least ) . 
  so `` nekem megvan a magam h\u00e1za '' would be correct grammatically , but `` nekem van ( egy ) saj\u00e1t h\u00e1zam '' sounds more natural and usual . 
  i agree with what abs96 wrote . 
  this could be translated more literally as `` for [ the purpose of ] these three letters envelope [ s ] and stamp [ s ] are needed '' ( or more accurately , with the correct emphasis : `` it is these three letters for which envelopes and stamps are needed '' ) . 
  if you use - nak / - nek , then it would be `` these three letters need envelopes and stamps '' . 
  but this sounds as if the letters were persons who can need stuff this way . 
  it 's not the letters that need something , but the person saying the sentence . 
  * he * ( not the letter ) needs the envelopes * in connection with * / * towards the use of * / * for the purpose of dealing with * the letters . 
  meaning `` i need envelopes and stamps for ( * in connection with * / * towards the use of * / * for the purpose of dealing with * ) these letters . '', 
  `` nem b\u00e1nom '' = `` it 's not a problem for me '' , `` it does n't bother me '' , `` i 'm fine with it '' , `` i do n't mind it '', 
  `` nekem mindegy '' = `` it does n't make a difference '' , `` either way is equally good for me '' , `` it does n't matter to me '', 
  however , it 's not correct to say `` nekem mindegy , ha marad '' , it should be `` nekem mindegy , hogy marad-e '' - `` it does n't matter to me , * whether * he stays . '', 
  it 's not about a condition about what will happen `` if '' , but a statement about the consideration `` whether '' . 
  it 's not about how i 'll feel in case he stays , but that the decision about * whether * he stays is irrelevant to me . 
  with `` nem b\u00e1nom , ha marad '' , it 's literally `` i wo n't regret if he stays '' ( well regret is not exactly the right flavoured word ) , so it 's really about the condition . 
  * if * he stays , i wo n't have this emotion . 
  so you ca n't always choose because one or the other may not make sense :, 
  ( i do n't care who wins the election ) . 
  you ca n't say this with `` nem b\u00e1nom '' , because `` nem b\u00e1nom '' requires a concrete possibility that you wo n't regret . 
  like :, 
  ( i do n't mind if trump wins the election . ), 
  but anyway , the important meaning difference is in the beginning of my comment . 
  in western europe they eat more `` dense '' versions of it and they are also often shaped differently .
