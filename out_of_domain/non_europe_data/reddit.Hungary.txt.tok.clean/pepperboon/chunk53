  crappy fatty canned industrially processed meat and other animal products mixture . 
  i give it to my dog sometimes when it 's on discount . 
  open it , it will look [ something like this ] ( http://static.origos.hu/s/img/i/1407/20140702loncshus34.jpg?w=1050&amp;h=700 ) . 
  about `` sem '' it means `` neither '' or `` not ... either '' . 
  like :, 
  - megk\u00e9rdezte a port\u00e1st , de sajnos ma sem \u00e9rkezett levele : he asked the janitor/doorman , but unfortunately he did ** not ** get any mail today ** either ** . 
  so neither earlier , nor today . 
  `` nem \u00e9rkezett levele '' implies an `` any '' in english . 
  so he did n't get * any * mail , or more literally `` did n't arrive any his-letter '' . 
  so it must refer to the guy in this context . 
  because if it meant `` her letter '' then we would n't use this `` any '' - implying version , but we 'd use the definite article , since that 's one particular letter from her that he 's waiting for , namely the one that 's replying to his earlier letter . 
  it could only perhaps mean `` her letter '' ( in this story ) if it was something like `` nem \u00e9rkezett meg ** a ** levele '' = `` his/her letter has n't arrived '' . 
  yeah and then we also need a `` meg '' coverb because , erm ... because here it emphasises : has it happened and finished or not . 
  because one definite , particular letter 's arrival is one definite moment , a definite completion of a process . 
  in the other sentence `` nem \u00e9rkezett levele '' it 's just that no arriving happened in general . 
  but `` meg '' is hard to explain . 
   - re is used because letters are flat . 
  it 's not about flatness . 
  `` v\u00e1lasz '' and `` v\u00e1laszol '' simply require the '' - ra / - re '' case ending on the thing * to * which the reply is made . 
  like `` v\u00e1lasz a k\u00e9rd\u00e9sre '' = `` answer to the question '' and spoken questions are n't flat . 
  the problem is , sometimes if you try to leave a large enough gap , another car will just go inbetween . 
  then you leave more gap and get another car jump in front of you . 
  that 's what i normally do . 
  i just mentioned an annoying aspect . 
  in dense traffic ( cars in all lanes ) , there are always assholes who want to get forward faster so they zigzag between lanes and leaving a large gap tempts them to cut in there . 
  which does n't mean i do n't aim at the 2 second gap , but if someone jumps in , then the distance will be smaller for some time . 
  that 's all . 
  it 's so funny that from one sentence , people assume they now know how i drive and i must be causing accidents ... you know , if i were a tailgater , i would n't have experiences of people jumping in the gap in front of me ... 
  i did n't say that 's a reason to tailgate either and i was n't arguing against keeping proper distance . 
  i was talking about the time after they cut you off . 
  then for some time it 's not in your power to be at proper distance . 
  of course hopefully that wo n't be the exact moment of a pile-up , but it might happen . 
  being a native speaker does n't automatically make one a good language teacher . 
  \u00edrt neki, 
   it sounds like `` shesh-enny '' bath house, 
  sz\u00e9chenyi ( pronounced approx . 
  say-chain-yee ), 
  who would `` my love '' refer to in this case ? 
  the grandfather ? 
  that does n't work in hungarian . 
  or your romantic love ? 
  `` good night '' is `` j\u00f3 \u00e9jt '' . 
  if it 's romantic , then ( with proper everything ) it 's `` j\u00f3 \u00e9jt , szerelmem ! '', 
  that 's how it is in europe in general . 
  the dashed line means it 's legal to overtake other cars . 
  solid lines are always forbidden to cross or touch ( except in emergencies ) . 
  color ( white vs yellow ) is rather country-specific ( some use white and some use yellow by default ) . 
  at least in hungary , yellow road markings mean `` temporary '' , so you have the normal white markings and when there are roadworks , they put down some new yellow markings over them to divert traffic away from the roadworks . 
  there 's no obvious way to distinguish a one-way two-lane road and a two-way one plus one road when you 're already on it . 
  you have to remember seeing the `` one-way road '' sign in the beginning of the road ( or the `` bidirectional traffic '' warning sign ) . 
  yeah , i 'd support that ( yellow color for separating opposing lanes ) . 
  it is confusing sometimes , especially when they turn roads into bidirectional or vice versa ( but then they usually paint some arrows on the lanes to make it clear that there was a change ) . 
  what 's even more confusing is when roads do n't have markings at all . 
  then it 's still bidirectional by default . 
  i checked `` the rules of hungarian orthography '' and the correct solution is ** joshsal ** , without a dash . 
  the relevant parts are [ sections 215-217 ] ( http://helyesiras.mta.hu/helyesiras/default/akh12#215 ) but mostly 216b . 
  i cite :, 
  `` sh '' is not an s and a silent h , but a letter combination expressing a consonant . 
  the same way as `` ch '' in greenwich or `` ck '' in steinbeck or `` tz '' in hertz . 
  the dash comes in when a word ends in a vowel in pronunciation but has a consonant-looking letter at the end , or a silent vowel or a very complicated and unusual cluster of many lettters . 
  we have examples for this in section 217a :, 
  as for beth , since hungarian does n't have the english `` th '' sound , we usually approximate it with `` sz '' , so it would be ** bethszel ** ( pronounced besszel ) . 
  it looks horrible , i know , but what can we do . 
  perhaps try to avoid such constructions when possible . 
   mr orb\u00e1n 's political climb has not been dissimilar to president-elect trump 's and the former billionaire investor turned politician has been widely criticised for his rejection of globalisation and inciting xenophobia in the country . 
  it 's definitely possible . 
  i do n't think it 's significantly harder for english-speakers than other non-indo-european languages . 
  you just have to learn lots of totally new words that are unrelated to the germanic-romance vocab of english . 
  and some new ways of thinking for grammar . 
  you 'll need more time to form correct sentences as there are more things to pay attention to ( proper suffixing , word order etc. ), 
  than in some `` easier '' languages . 
  use a coursebook , wiktionary is a good online dictionary ( or even google translate ) . 
  watch movies with subtitles , first ones that you 've already seen many times in english and know well . 
  by the way , why do you want to study alone ? 
  having a good private tutor can be very useful . 
  or if you can find a good course around you ( no idea where you live , may not be available where you are ) . 
  if it is n't possible , then there are also some skype-based online tutors as well . 
  sometimes it 's good to have your questions all cleared up and it 's more difficult with self-study . 
  but you can also ask in the / r/hungarian sub as well . 
  so yeah , it 's possible , as long as you have some strong and concrete motivation to keep it up . 
  i do n't think it 's possible to unlock the sim pin remotely . 
  the sim pin code is always written on that credit-card-sized card from which the sim card can be popped out when you buy a sim . 
  in [ this hungarian article ] ( http://www.borsonline.hu/aktualis/igy-szerezze-vissza-a-telefonja-pin-kodjat/100903 ) they say the service provider might be able to tell you the pin after you give them some personal identification data . 
  others only do it if you go in personally . 
  some gsm hackers may be able to crack it , but i 'm not sure if it 's easy . 
  no , the pronunciation counts . 
  the ck sounds like a hungarian k , the tz sounds like a hungarian c and the sh sounds like a hungarian s , so it 's `` rickkel '' , `` hertzcel '' and `` joshsal '' . 
  yeah , these last two do n't look nice to native speakers either . 
  if it were up to me , i 'd write them all with a dash . 
  not legally , i think . 
  it could also be translated as :, 
  `` but it 's also possible that last night simply turned out too/exceedingly well at sziget ( festival ) . '', 
  or `` but maybe she only says that because last night went really well at sziget . '', 
  expanding the whole dialogue a bit :, 
  - melanie and mike will go back to new york in september . 
  they 'll be missed very much ( i/we will miss them very much ) . 
  - how , do you think , mike will decide ? 
  to me , lilla said that he ( mike ) will also stay in budapest . 
  - i do n't know if that 's really surely what 's going to happen . 
  it 's not impossible that he will indeed stay .
