  i read some chapters , but could n't finish it . 
  and i think it 's just enough . 
  from that i learned the style , the kind of stuff that happens etc. 
  there is no way to stop cultural change , these books will just become more and more unreadable with every generation . 
  well , i liked * a j\u00f3 pal\u00f3cok * because it had short stories with some conclusion , some message , instead of listing what happens in a family or how many of which type of soldier there were in the turkish army . 
  that just does n't entertain me much . 
  but then again , i 'm not so much into reading fiction ( in general ) . 
  we should n't force people to enjoy what they do n't . 
  i 'm more interested in real world stuff , actual history , science , philosophy etc. 
  i know it 's tradition to read these books and it `` connects the generations '' like some initiation ritual ( which are by their nature uncomfortable ) . 
  so maybe it 's the right thing to teach these . 
  i do n't know . 
  i just know we did n't like it . 
  we also did n't like the classical music that we had to listen to in music classes . 
  exactly my reaction . 
  okay , someone made a mistake or was just an asshole . 
  so what ? 
  it took like a second . 
  this is the main reason for road rage . 
  even those who are `` right '' are pumped with adrenaline and are ready to shout , horn , etc. 
  from petty issues . 
  this is n't healthy . 
  are you sure ? 
  in hungary we have an importance hierarchy :, 
  * traffic lights, 
  * traffic signs, 
  * signs painted on the road, 
  so if the traffic lights are green for the cars then the traffic lights are red for the pedestrians and the pedestrian can not cross . 
  the zebra markings do n't matter , they are there for better visibility and in case the lights are out of order . 
  of course , if you kill a pedestrian on the road because you were n't careful enough , you 'll still be punished even if the pedestrian was wrong . 
  you 're driving a 1 ton vehicle , you have to be careful . 
  but you do n't have to expect people jumping on the road suddenly like crazy . 
  in hungary we do n't have `` parallel lines '' . 
  the standard crossing design is traffic lights for cars and pedestrians , zebra stripes with `` pedestrian crossing '' blue signs , and either stop or yield signs for the cars ( in case the lights do n't work , or are switched off during nighttime ) . 
  so stop signs and green lights are definitely possible . 
  you just ignore the stop sign , because the lights win . 
  so you just go with the highest priority available instruction . 
  if there are lights that 's what you follow , if there are no lights then the signs , if the signs were stolen , then you follow the painting on the road . 
  if they are in conflict , also the higher priority thing wins . 
  some boxing game on atari 2600, 
  he has [ videos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgoudjbl3fw ) on youtube ( this one in budapest ) . 
  no sudden swerves or brakes unless it 's about human life . 
  human life is incomparable to stork life . 
  as simple as that . 
  oh my god . 
  this is crazy !, 
  we have similar additional green arrows in hungary and it functions as full green for you . 
  this system seems extremely dangerous . 
  why is n't this standardized across the eu instead of the curvature of pickles and shit ... 
  or allocate some time when it 's red for the pedestrians , red for going straight , but green for turning right . 
  i think legalizing `` crossing a red light '' in any form is now impossible in europe . 
  it 's a very alien concept to us . 
  red is red , you must stop . 
  it would be very confusing . 
  but we have similar constructions : we have a separate little piece of road that curves right before the crossing , it curves away from the lanes that go straight , so it 's physically separated , and it only has a stop or a yield sign , but no lights . 
  you know , many people do this and have been doing this throughout the ages . 
  the stereotypical `` italian lover '' who lies about promises etc. 
  it 's basically the same . 
  even though every move is calculated , i 'm sure it works . 
  and these were normal girls , not the shallowest ones . 
  i can imagine my girl friends falling for this . 
  because he seems genuinely nice and cool and spontaneous . 
  but all of it is orchestrated . 
  i 'm not exactly sure how to feel about it . 
  it seems he does n't lie about facts , he tells them how he 's in europe etc. 
  or how about [ this ambulance dashcam video in budapest , hungary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldi-6lbr7hm ), 
  which one ? 
  for me , non-american , this seems crazy . 
  you can sue the cop later or file a complaint or whatever . 
  but you should n't be able to override what the cop says ( unless he 's ordering you to kill someone or similar ) . 
  if he says you have to give your name then you have to . 
  if the police wants to arrest you , you ca n't jump in your car and flee , just because you think you are innocent . 
  take it to a nearby forest . 
  they are trying to move on to germany , though . 
  i 'm not sure how , maybe they are n't either and that 's why they are at the train station . 
  this huge antagonism between people and police , people and government seems extremely strange as seen from europe . 
  i mean we are n't fully satisfied with the police and government in general either , but we do n't see them as a sort of enemy . 
  `` supposed to '' / `` meant to '' : i 'm like , who `` supposes '' them ? 
  these expressions seem to be based on inherent purposes or `` this is how it has to be '' , fate-like ideas . 
  it 's quite hard to translate ( to hungarian ) . 
  the many meanings of `` wrong '' and how universal it is . 
  you can say `` it is wrong to ... '' . 
  do you mean it 's not allowed , not moral , not practical or what ? 
  in hungarian we have words corresponding to `` sinful '' , `` forbidden '' , `` bad '' , `` improper '' , but `` wrong '' is much more universal , and it is still strange for me . 
  yes , it seems like you 're aware of being yourself , as opposed to little babies who do n't have the concept yet . 
  it 's a weird word . 
  that 's an illusion . 
  you think the vocabulary is limited because * you * know few words . 
  hungarian here . 
  we , too , have only past , present and future . 
  we do n't have continuous or perfect tenses . 
  i guess these are the 12 tenses :, 
  * does, 
  * is doing, 
  * has done, 
  * has been doing, 
  * did, 
  * was doing, 
  * had done, 
  * had been doing,
