  * will do, 
  * will be doing, 
  * will have done, 
  * will have been doing, 
  imagine having only `` does '' , `` did '' and `` will do '' . 
  ( this by no means means that hungarian verbs are easy , not at all , but the complexities are elsewhere , not in the tenses ) . 
  we also have small prefixes and suffixes to words that modify them in peculiar ways , expressing nuances like being continuous , repetitive , finished etc. 
  i could compare it to `` eat '' -  `` eat up '' to make it a `` finished action '' . 
  if i want to say the equivalent of `` he had eaten the food '' in hungarian , it becomes something like ~ `` he already ate up the food by then '' . 
  or we just let the context determine it . 
  edit : additionally , when i heard `` would have had to have been '' for the first time , it was mindfuck . 
  what 's your mother tongue ? 
  they are the same in hungarian , too . 
  although the concepts are really different actually . 
  in one case you have it and you do n't want to share it or give it away , in the other case someone else has it and you want to get it . 
  your examples are al indo-european , so they are related . 
  i first heard `` supposed to '' in the movie twelve monkeys . 
  bruce willis said `` i 'm supposed to be gathering information '' . 
  but the point of this term is not what other people assume or think what you are doing , but what they * want * you to be doing , your job , your task . 
  you would n't say `` i 'm supposed to be in the kitchen '' , just because someone assumes that you 're in the kitchen . 
  or for example when holding a guitar , someone might say `` you 're supposed to hold it this way '' . 
  it does n't mean someone presumes that you hold it that way , it means you * should * hold it that way . 
  but still `` should '' and `` supposed to '' do n't mean the same thing , because `` supposed to '' does n't necessarily mean that the speaker agrees that it should be done that way . 
  it either means that people in general think it should be so , or that the universe is simply such that it is * the * right way of thing . 
  yeah , basically english has the concepts of past , present and future * plus * continuous * plus * perfect . 
  the concept of continuous and perfect are the hard things for speakers of certain other languages . 
  what you 're asking is called the sapir-whorf hypothesis in linguistics . 
  i think mental processes and nonverbal concepts are a lot broader than language . 
  there 's a lot more to thinking than words . 
   does it tell us anything about germans in general that they have the word schadenfreude or about the japanese that the have a word for how the sun looks when partially obscured by leaves/trees ( ca n't look up what it right now but i think it begins with a ` k ' ) ? 
  not much . 
  it does say something about the culture , but not too much . 
  for example americans have the expression `` road head '' but saudis or other strict muslim nations probably do n't . 
  now it certainly shows something about the culture . 
   does one really feel something like schadenfreude before they know of the word/the ability to express that feeling ? 
  definitely . 
  when i first learned the word `` cringe '' i immediately recognized it as a distinct feeling i had in the past , even when i had no word for it . 
  i think having a word for something feels liberating , it becomes less taboo , it gets recognized as a `` legitimate '' emotion or concept . 
  take a look at the [ dictionary of obscure sorrows youtube channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/obscuresorrows ) . 
  he makes up words for feelings and emotions , and they are often relatable , even though you never had a word for them . 
  but there are other interesting things about grammar . 
  for example the gender of `` sun '' is feminine in german but masculine in french and for `` moon '' it 's the other way around . 
  so this shapes folklore and how you `` personify '' them . 
  another example is the gender of `` key '' ( german masc. , spanish fem . ), 
  and `` bridge '' ( german fem. , spanish masc . ) . 
  some people say this can influence the design of objects and architecture , having a more robust and bulky concept of a bridge vs. a lean , elegant arch . 
  there can definitely be such connotations . 
  or for example in hungarian jealousy and envy are covered by the same word and it can be hard to learn to differentiate them . 
  or `` irony '' and `` sarcasm '' . 
  another thing is that in hungarian we do n't have any grammatical gender , i.e. 
  no `` he/she '' difference . 
  it 's the same in finnish , turkish and chinese , too ( chinese writing differentiates but speech does n't ) . 
  this of course does n't mean that women were treated socially equally all over hungary , turkey and china . 
  but at least we do n't have to mention gender every time we reference people by pronouns , as it is english . 
  and we often mess up . 
  it always seems strange to english speakers how you can accidentally refer to your girlfriend as `` he '' , but the gender information is simply not retrieved automatically in the brain when putting the sentence together , so beginners just quickly pick one at random . 
  but such things can have wider implications . 
  for example in english there 's only one `` you '' , whereas many east asian languages have very complex honorific `` levels '' , and you have to use the appropriate one , otherwise you 're very rude . 
  so in english-speaking countries it 's not very important to establish firm hierarchical relations . 
  there are no embarrassing teenage years of `` how am i supposed to talk '' , you just say `` hello '' and `` you '' and it 's fine . 
  so culture and language do interact but not in a trivial way . 
  why is fireplace not specific ? 
  you mean that it 's too `` transparent '' , like fire + place ? 
  that 's a strange thing because my biggest problem with english was that all the words are so different and their meaning can not be guessed at all . 
  in hungarian we often use short basic words with lots of suffixes and prefixes and build tons of related words . 
  while english words are seemingly random . 
  f\u00e9lt\u00e9kenys\u00e9g is not only about ( romantic ) relationships . 
  jealousy is broader . 
  were the english perfect tenses ( has gone , have been going ... ) hard for you , too ? 
  [ coco jambo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izy8iafkj8s ), 
  how about `` i have left it at home '' vs `` i left it at home '' . 
  are n't these hard for germans ? 
  no idea . 
  proper use of present perfect is still a mystery for me ( although i passed an ielts exam with c2 level results ) . 
  i 'd simply say `` oh shit , i left it at home '' . 
  but the guidelines often say that you need to use the present perfect tense if the result of an action is emphasized . 
  and it 's pretty much the case here , since the result ( you do n't have the item with you ) is pretty important . 
  holy shit !, 
  i 'm basically the same !, 
  also counter-clockwise winter top , summer bottom . 
  for me christmas is on top , and january is a bit more to the right . 
  it 's a bit more like an ellipse , it seems that the summer and winter are longer on the clock than in reality . 
  probably due to having less to do in school breaks as a child . 
  the similarity seems crazy !, 
  maybe this ( winter top , summer bottom , anti-clockwise ) was used in some children 's books and we both just internalized it , but i have no recollection of such things . 
  i do n't remember when i started imagining it like that . 
  because it 's not a related language . 
  languages such as english , german , russian , spanish , greek and even hindi are all part of the indo-european language family , meaning that they are `` modified versions '' of a single language that was spoken some thousands of years ago . 
  so there are different concepts and structures in hungarian and it 's very hard to `` align '' hungarian and english sentences with each other . 
  i mean , when you learn spanish , it 's almost the same as english , but with different words and changing the word order a little ( exaggerating a bit ) . 
  the hardest parts are verb conjugation and word order i guess . 
  for verbs , we have definite and indefinite conjugations depending on whether the object of the sentence is definite ( for example marked by the definite article ) or indefinite ( for example marked with the indefinite article ) . 
  another thing to get used to is lots of suffixes and postpositions instead of prepositions as in english . 
  or that the possessive structure is entirely different . 
  `` the man 's dog '' becomes `` az f\u00e9rfi kuty\u00e1ja '' , literally `` the man dog-his '' . 
  or more accurately `` the man dog-his/her/its '' , since there is no differentiation between grammatical genders such as he/she ( but this only makes things easier for the learner ) . 
  anyway , i 'm not sure if hungarian is truly more difficult than other languages unrelated to english , such as arabic or japanese . 
  at least you do n't have to learn a totally new writing system when learning hungarian . 
  i understand them now . 
  the op question was phrased in past tense ( `` blew '' ) , so i assumed we can include stuff we get now , but did n't get at first .
