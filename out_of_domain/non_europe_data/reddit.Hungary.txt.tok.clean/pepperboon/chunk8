  honest question : to you as a native speaker , does the past tense in `` blew '' indicate that we should write stuff we still have problems with or rather stuff we * once * had problems with ? 
  compromise seems to have an element of resignation or mild failure . 
  a trade-off is not necessarily seen as a bad thing , it 's neutral . 
  it 's just part of engineering to manage your trade-offs well . 
  i also meant usage like `` that 's just so wrong '' ( in the snarky sense that it 's culturally off , unfitting , etc ) . 
  some people think `` because it 's wrong '' is an explanation , but actually it carries no meaning beyond disapproval . 
  wrong in what sense ? 
  i mean it 's just an unusually general word that can mean so many different things . 
  great !, 
  well , it will definitely take time and dedication , but it 's surely possible . 
  come over to / r/hungarian if you need help . 
  the subjunctive exists in formal english , like, 
  * it is imperative that i ** be ** calm . 
  * i am running faster lest she ** catch ** me, 
  * he wrote it in his diary in order that he ** remember **, 
  it 's advanced stuff and not really used in everyday language . 
  i never really understood this . 
  is the insurance payout so much more than the cost of repairs ? 
  obviously not , because then they would have dropped them on tokyo . 
  that would have inflicted much more damage . 
  this presupposes that ( the judeo-christian ) god exists . 
  `` good '' is a human concept , just like `` tasty '' or `` beautiful '' . 
  that 's not a question . 
  because you enjoy trolling , perhaps . 
  but redditors are used to your kind . 
  asking as a non-native speaker of english , how would you interpret the phrase `` star wars '' then ? 
  just putting `` star '' and `` wars '' next to each other does n't make sense in some languages , you actually need to specify some meaning to the relation between the words . 
  `` war about the stars '' ? 
  `` war for the stars '' ? 
  `` war among the stars '' ? 
  what does the title mean to you ? 
  how do you interpret `` star '' in this title ? 
  it 's all ingrained and conditioned behavior . 
  not a conscious decision . 
  it 's not always consciously manipulative . 
  i do n't blame them in all cases . 
  simply they learn implicitly from toddler to kindergarten to school age that when they cry they get positive attention and the other party gets negative attention . 
  at the same time boys ( above toddler age ) are taught not to cry because it makes them look weak . 
  so they unlearn it and repress these emotions . 
  also , i 'm not making a value judgement here . 
  i simply state the fact . 
  one may say that this is the right way of things , and girls should be able to have some kind of defense such as crying , while men have their physical force and can just beat up any opponent . 
  again , in general , not just against opposite gender `` fights '' . 
  and i 'm not saying this view is right . 
  i simply state that girls implicitly learn that crying is a tool , while boys do n't . 
  that 's all . 
  it 's not necessary that she consciously wants to get out of it . 
  it becomes a habit that you can cry and expect people to come and soothe you and make the bad thing go away . 
  do n't get me wrong , the weaker party needs protection for sure , and there is a reason for this tradition . 
  but it has its backside too . 
  [ here ] ( https://xkcd.com/774/ ), 
  yes !, 
  i also see the summer and winter longer . 
  only difference is that for me the length of august and july are swapped . 
  and it 's a mirror image for me ( goes counter-clockwise ) . 
  how interesting that these things can influence our mood !, 
  do you think it makes a difference that the us considers sunday as the beginning of the week ? 
  ( if i 'm not mistaken ), 
  who cares ? 
  it 's like whether australia/greenland is a continent or just an island . 
  and then you realize it was for nothing , because people actually care way less about the lifestyle of others than people usually assume . 
  probably depends a lot on location , culture of the family , your friends , colleagues etc. 
  even some of these questions are just small talk sometimes . 
  for example before redditting much , i did n't know it was so offensive to ask whether or why someone wants kids or not , etc. 
  either it 's just a topic to fill time , or i 'm interested . 
  and if i ask why you go to college for something ( maybe not phrased like that ) i may just want to learn about the stuff . 
  certainly there are obnoxious people who just try to make you feel bad about yourself and hope to feel superior as a result . 
  on the other hand there are many people who * enjoy * getting offended by any question or comment . 
  what are acceptable topics for you ? 
  if i ca n't ask why you study something , why you like foods , what you think about the military , or having kids or in which city you want to live your life etc , then what else ? 
  can i ask you about your musical taste ? 
  must i agree with everything you say ? 
  it 's hard to talk about this in general because i also know people who just wo n't stop nagging someone even though he/she obviously does n't want any advice or discussion on a topic . 
  i do n't know how old you are , but the end of the teenager years can be difficult for sure in this regard because all the `` experienced adults '' want to tell you how to live your life . 
  it can be overwhelming , sure . 
  but later on it gets better . 
  or shall i say more challenging . 
  when you get to the point where nobody truly cares what you do and nobody tells you what to do , what options there are etc , it can be hard too . 
  even if you 've been contrarian and did the opposite of what people expected of you , you still had a reference point . 
  when you 're on your own you can no longer blame anyone for giving you bad advice etc. 
  but i have no idea , probably this does n't apply to you , i ca n't know from a single comment . 
  all i know is that people do n't really care what happens with you ( expect for close family and friends ) . 
  if they seem to , then they mostly actually care about how you will make * them * look ( for being friends with you etc ) . 
  in my comment i meant that if you live your life to satisfy everyone , you notice at one point ( after moving for example ) that it was totally not worth pleasing that one person who 's now vary far away and you may never talk any more . 
  you do n't get anything for pleasing them . 
  these sorts of people always find something to criticize . 
  right . 
  depends a lot on local culture and the particular person . 
  some people * love * to talk about themselves , where they want to live , what they do for a living etc. 
  but i definitely hate when people obviously just fake their interest and forget the answer right away . 
  maybe you should find better social circles . 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/23/why-the-dutch-are-so-tall/ ), 
  they may play informal football without any official teams or anything , just a random split . 
  not even necessarily 11 players , maybe just a 5 v 5 random play , without real stakes . 
  nobody would watch it , though , it would be laughable . 
  they are just having fun playing . 
  they can also just sit around in parks and talk , drink beer or whatever . 
  i think it 's more laid-back here `` in europe '' , not so many strict formalities , just doing stuff . 
  we are usually not treated as criminals by default . 
  the american public 's relation with the police seems insane to us .
