the technological advancement over the indigenous peoples, 
  how advanced were the vikings compared to the natives ? 
  what did this manifest in ? 
  this is really intriguing to realize there were these gaps between certain civilizations back in the time !, 
   priest of the feast needs to be dealt with, 
  hex destroys resurrect priest . 
  how did you capture the decktracker overlay as well ? 
  i had/have fun with thijs ' c'thun zoo , it 's actually viable around rank 15-10 too . 
  different playstyle than your usual zoo although it does need brann and twin emperor for full effect . 
  [ here 's a c'thun zoo light list if you 're interested ] ( http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/623065-cthun-zoolock-f2p-commons-rares-only-no-adventures ) , i 'd drop an usher for +1 forbidden ritual though ( also doomcaller is debatable , you are no warrior to stretch games for that long ) . 
  in my experience such a c'thun buff minion heavy deck can quite often net you 18 + c'thuns . 
  really fun when it works out . 
  alright no worries !, 
  thanks for keeping the quality high !, 
  [ i visualized the list for you . 
  i 'm interested , how much buff does arcane anomaly get on average ? 
  it might be cool in some experimental decks . 
  was running [ thijs ' discardlock ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nzoyjcb.png ) a bit , can really snowball the board when you get lucky !, 
  fairly inconsistent ( as expected ) though . 
  no worries !, 
  seems like an interesting deck so i was curious too . 
  that means it can contest several early drops and have the flexibility to be somewhat sticky , when you can push it to 2/3 or 2/4 it wo n't really feel like a dead card if you draw it later game . 
  `` do n't make me look stupid '', 
  [ oxford begs to differ ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/impactful ), 
  most appropriate use of the thank you emote ever . 
  i either let hs sit for a while ( half a day , a day ) or queue for a different mode/ladder . 
  when i finally hit r5 and did n't want to drop i went on to play wild for a bit . 
  you can also just do some arena runs or brawls for fun . 
  he should just go back to poe . 
  that game is sweet . 
  star charts are easy to exploit trade around , too . 
   most important reflection is to not blame luck/matchup and always ask if there was a mistake or if you could have played better . 
  absolutely . 
  there are no ` players just unluckier than others ' , that 's nonsense . 
  yeah people tend to take positive outcomes as normal , much more than negatives . 
  rip my 60 gold druid/rogue quest . 
  i 'm running the double doomguard variant , makes sense that leeroy zoo is more favoured in the matchup though . 
  i believe there could be an argument for moving certain really important cards , like emperor for combo , to classic once their adventure rotates out . 
  although there 's also the idea of shaking up the meta with every new year . 
  but some cards are just sad to see gone . 
  [ it does , but in the quest log ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hw4axlt.png ), 
  [ here you go man ] ( http://www.hearthpwn.com/deckbuilder/druid#165:2;305:1;311:1;329:2;473:2;480:2;542:2;577:2;7738:2;7754:2;7756:2;12216:2;14442:2;22329:2;27215:1;33151:2;35222:1; ), 
  thanks for letting me know about that site , their data collection method & analysis are great . 
  i think a 4/4 body + built in consecrate is quite decent . 
  i 'm using shifting shade in my res priest and its 4/3 body is n't really a drawback on turn 4 . 
  minesweeper : scorced earth, 
  thijs said about tiny knight that +1 / 1 buff is too weak for him to run it . 
  i like it but it gets removed almost instantly every time if you do n't discard something while playing it . 
  succubus otoh is a solid body with instant synergy effect . 
  maybe becoming one is good start for adulthood, 
  this might be an odd idea but have you tried mct ? 
  it could be a counter to all the deathrattle minions ( pre-or post aoe ) , also cotw if played on a not empty board . 
   north of alexandria, 
  fish in the mediterranean talk ? 
  why bother with anything , really ? 
  the sun will scorch everything off earth in a few billion years anyway . 
  [ mind control tech ] ( http://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/147/927/368.png ), 
  going strong at 0 score . 
  let me know how it works out for you . 
  leaving the eu will certainly make the nhs ' situation better then , right ? 
  do n't give them ideas, 
  cheers , i 'll check it out !, 
  felt like / r/unexpected honestly, 
  tuskarr is really good when it summons a totem golem , flametongue or mana tide ; that 's roughly 1/3 of all totems ? 
  else it 's an easily removable body with some thing from below synergy . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's strictly better than a 2/4 or 3/5 + for aggro or any non-evolve . 
  it 's more consistent as well . 
  last season i 've been playing a lot of [ thijs ' original c'thunlock ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lnbwewa.png ) . 
  while it might not be as consistent nor play strictly as zoo , it 's quite fun and people do n't expect it until you drop your first c'thun minion ; and that can be a 2-4 dmg burst with [ disciple ] ( http://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/289/268/35196.png ) ( + brann ) or [ usher ] ( http://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/289/452/35242.png ) on turn 5 for decent value when need to trade in a board ( it 's actually my favourite warlock card atm ) . 
  [ c'thun 's chosen ] ( http://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/289/422/33123.png ) is also really good to drop on curve , especially against warriors . 
   just like pizza and sex, 
  i 'll think about that next time i play him . 
  i think eviscerate face was the biggest mistake . 
  it 's like throwing away a solid frothing berserker response for nothing . 
  difference is that druids usually have way more big threats than rogue . 
   then you are extremely likely to win, 
  i would n't go that far against a warrior who generally have the highest survivability of all . 
  life 's hard . 
  i insta-dusted all naxx and gvg cards , except for loatheb . 
  guy 's just way too useful to dust . 
  i miss good rift . 
  it 's not even the biggest prize pool ever . 
  [ there was a ] ( http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/games/468718-war-is-coming-u120000-age-of-empires-tournament ) [ $ 120,000 tournament ] ( http://aoczone.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=104408 ) in 2014 sponsored by the best aoc team . 
  tbh i 've found myself watching 3-5hour long 7-game series ( [ wb semi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bczse71shyu ) , [ wb final ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bofibzccema ) of the $ 30k tourney ) just a few weeks ago . 
  the game 's real fun to watch . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntjrwpbwjhk ), 
  [ i prefer several hours . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uts9fa4vy6q ), 
  it 's a fair assumption, 
  nice one man, 
  i was about to say , there 's no way a 3-month rate is worth it over the other options . 
  i really hope kripp goes back to path of exile , too . 
  he got 12-15k viewers on his last poe stream i watched so i 'd suppose it is n't that bad . 
  it 's less than hs but still decent . 
  this is what will happen to the us as well if the buffoon gets into power . 
  i 've played both df and rimworld , rimworld has absolutely nothing on df regarding depth . 
  i have n't played since just before act 4 release . 
  what are some cool ci builds nowadays ? 
  [ is it possible that they were unaware ? 
  which base is it ?
