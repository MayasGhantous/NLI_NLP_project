  * shift weight forward , onto the front wheel, 
  * rotate shoulders and torso towards the turn, 
  * push bum/hips outwards ( left ), 
  * pull bars with right hand down , towards the turn, 
  * raise left elbow ( to counteract ? ), 
  kind of ? 
  [ these endura ones are excellent . 
  ] ( http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/endura-single-track-ii-trousers-ss17/rp-prod85240 ) water - and windproof , never felt the need to wear anything underneath yet , riding around 0-5 \u00b0 c + wind . 
  cool pic & bike . 
  nice save :d, 
  what kind of talk is that ? 
  felt a bit like pod racing from star wars . 
  after 5 hours of practice in 6 sessions , today i managed 39 seconds twice without brakes !, 
  got the rocking motion down and it feels like i only need [ the slightest incline ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b3fopha.png ) to keep at it . 
  it 's sweet !, 
   you can really feel your control get better all around with trackstands . 
  yeah it really feels that way . 
  and the great thing is that you can practice them basically anywhere , anytime . 
  one question , how do you keep it on completely flat , smooth surfaces ? 
  or on a downwards slope ? 
  you have to jump the bike back ? 
  nice , i kind of only discovered rocking yesterday , before that i was n't quite doing it right . 
  it really makes a difference . 
  i think , once i 'm quite confident on flat i 'll try with the front wheel up on a curb or something like that . 
  this trials man !, 
  ( sorry i edited my previous comment afterwards , but can you trackstand on a downwards slope as well ? 
  without brakes somehow ? ), 
  out of curiosity , how 's that jump look like ? 
  i 'm planning on jumping my hardtail too but unsure how much is too much . 
  alright cool !, 
  well yeah but the name means `` * castle * of the knights '' so i do n't mind either way . 
  [ like this ?

  really ? 
  that all 's a thing ? 
  i might have to actually play it again then . 
  do they spawn more frequently on hard ? 
  yeah i have a suntour raidon as well . 
  quite a good one for a starter is n't it ? 
  ah , thought they were normal spawns . 
  i remember i stopped playing mc `` seriously '' after alpha when the survival aspect was n't challenging anymore . 
  since then the survival update etc happened but the game still does n't feel quite hard ... 
  beautiful . 
  this 'd make me come back to the game for another playthrough . 
  that sounds promising lol , what did you do ? 
  you can see the sun ... for 15 minutes before random hail . 
  `` let me just hit this sick kamloops jump , ca n't lose anything '', 
  man what a collaboration, 
  you 'd make a good manager, 
  that 's basically how it 's always been . 
  `` nobody really wanted this war . 
  nobody really knew what they are fighting for . 
  but it was unstoppable . '', 
  when i finish i have to put an effort into removing my 510 from my flats .

  the mongols are always the exception, 
  the new face of america everyone . 
  woah now * that * puts it in perspective . 
  you 're not taking anything from hungary bro , 
  oh wow do n't know how i missed that in gc . 
  thanks !, 
  ps : i 'm unsure if garmin 20 has lap capacity , if there is i have n't found it yet, 
  i think i set that to auto lap initially then forgot all about it & assumed it was default . 
  will experiment , yeah . 
  cheers !, 
  get the raidon imo . 
  alright being out in heavy british rain for 80 minutes it seems like it 's more water resistant than waterproof . 
  in the area where my kneepads touched it it soaked through ( not a lot , but a bit ) . 
  legs were unaffected ( but did n't touch the trousers either ) . 
   there is n't a set torque, 
  well i 'm pretty sure i just killed the thread in the stem cap bolt ... tightened real strong ( wobble still persisted ) then it suddenly got loose . 
  now it does n't tighten past 5nm . . 
  yup , just been to my lbs , i 'll go back to have the messed up thread replaced on the weekend when their technician is in . 
  did n't mean the original comment to sound like it was any way your fault , i should have stopped at some point haha . 
  thanks for the thorough explanation !, 
  we need a playable demo or something dude, 
  nice , found the wot thread, 
  think we got a name there . 
  exclamation mark included . 
  imagine having this as a base game and adding themes like he mentioned , with theme-related obstacles like hair and acne mountains etc. 
  like a randomly generated set of stuff \u00e1 la worms 3d . 
  well you get the idea . 
  ! remindme 1 day 22 hours, 
  ^ remi gallard, 
  would n't make a good roman for sure . 
  grower ? 
  now that 's a shower i would n't take . 
  is a suntour aion considered budget ? 
  : o it costs almost as much as my hardtail did . 
  could you link it ? 
  i could only find halfords ' 400 quid one . 
  he already did , it 's the rubble . 
  as if video games were only first person shooters ... 
  civilization , dwarf fortress , hearthstone , crusader kings , stellaris , kerbal space program are all viable at all ages . 
  and here in europe we think us road culture is subpar, 
  that 's a late date to be born on yo, 
  that 's a nice deal indeed !, 
  have n't seen this one yet , feels like i 'm having the same problem as the first guy with rounded back . 
  thanks !,
