  it feels like my hips and feet barely do any work . 
  so , drop down to the saddle , heels down and kick forward ? 
  does that automatically lunge the hips back or do i have to focus on bringing the hips back too ? 
  i think that 's why my posture is so bent , i try to push my hips back with my back instead of my legs . 
  it 's strange but when i first tried to do manuals i actually managed to tip the bike over and hop off . 
  then i sort of zoned in on this wrong technique you see in the vid . 
  i 'll try to focus on pushing my hips back with my legs after i drop my weight low to the saddle . 
  my favourite / u/bk-xc vids are the ones where he rides with seth and mtb jesus ( and phil ofc but that 's been a one off so far ) . 
   as you throw your weight back, 
  and this is done entirely with low heels + legs from a lowered attack position ? 
  do you focus on the hips or they 'll just move as a result ? 
  i 've been pushing my bike away with the hands and bending my back to push my hips back . 
   `` well , you think our country is so innocent ? '', 
  `` i 'll show you it 's not '', 
  * invades iran out of the blue *, 
  do you mean how fast my movements are or the bike ? 
  yup , i 'm subbed to gmbn . 
  i actually have their sweater on in the vid !, 
  i 've been trying to achieve that l-shape but apparently the wrong way . 
  should i start the leg push as i get low to the saddle , as i start moving backwards ? 
  how fast should the movement be ? 
  like twice as fast ? 
  new to me so you may sod off . 
  you never watched cartoon network as a kid ?? 
  we had it even in barely post communist hungary, 
  looks like a bt-2 for me, 
   he is also reputed to have little patience for detailed policy documents . 
  the part you should be most worried about, 
  `` no military background of a sufficient degree '',

  maybe he wants another guy named wick sakit get caught .

  yep , that speaks tons of the * idiocracy * that america is becoming . 
  thanks for all the input !, 
  are those five tens ? 
  / r/latestagecapitalism, 
  i would get bored after 5 minutes . 
  give them enough information about scientific history and time to process it , then they 'll find it just as natural as we do ... or even think we 're lagging behind compared to where we could be , considering how ( relatively ) advanced their sciences were back in the day . 
  from what i 've seen 10 \u00b0 c + slight precipitation is just as fine . 
   i 'd take rain over heat any day, 
  you can put on some layers but you ca n't jump out of your skin . 
  in denial i see .

   edit : 4.7 k for this ? ... 
  sheesh , that 's doubled my comment karma . . ta !, 
  congrats , now you almost have enough for a cup or hat, 
  i asked / r/mtb about otb before and [ got some pretty good tips ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mtb/comments/5lhdmi/how_would_you_go_about_practicing_otb/ ), 
  should leave him in a desert somewhere for a few ~ ~ days ~ ~ weeks , maybe he 'd figure it out . 
  beautiful graphics . 
  [ the causes that expand them can certainly be artificial ] ( http://desertificationb.tripod.com/id3.html ), 
  you clearly did n't check what i linked . 
  stop talking out of your ass . 
   where exactly does it say deserts did n't exist before humans ? 
  alright you must be playing dumb now . 
  we misunderstood each other then . 
  i was n't trying to prove anything like that but pointed out there can be instances when desertification happens due to human shortsightedness/mistreatment of the land . 
  just ask the soviets . 
  not necessarily tho . 
  i 'm dreaming of drier conditions too . 
   on one hand the green does look really slick ... but on the other , because the colors ar n't neutral its hard to find components to match the bike, 
  i know that feeling , [ look at my grips vs the rest of the bike ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xz1v127.jpg ) ( sorry no better pic ) . 
  being slightly colourblind does n't help either . . , 
  garmin edge 20 because i decided to cheap out on the 25 . 
  i really like gps tracking and it 's nice and compact as well . 
  i like your way of looking at it, 
  [ i love this vid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwcmexxe-14 ),

  holy shit that is insane !, 
  dude that 's beautiful, 
  10-14 \u00b0 c ( 48-58 \u00b0 f ) in the uk and it felt like summer . 
  sure bro, 
  ^ ^ ^ nb ^ ^ ^ though ^ ^ ^ he ^ ^ ^ buys ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ his ^ ^ ^ money ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ trying ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ find ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ decent ^ ^ ^ deal, 
  what are your backgrounds ? 
  how much it cost to fire the whole thing up ? 
  any additional staff or just the two of you ? 
  what made you commit to the whole thing ? 
  i have so many questions, 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm asking because i played with the idea of firing up a bike shop ; not an entire brand though . 
  i really wonder if that 's something you can live off in the world of online stores . 
  so your approach is `` so long as we stay in business and have room to experiment/improve '' ? 
  how much do you estimate the whole thing will take up of your time at start and eventually ? 
  it 's something that one dedicates their entire life for for the time being , is n't it ? 
  ( sorry if some questions are silly like the last one lol . ), 
  i would if i felt the need to but this way i 'm good to go on a whim - and still have a ton of space to work with . 
  new game f2, 
  dude that looks dope, 
  really looks like jeep vs race cars there . 
  what are the chances that these planets are tidally locked ? 
  would that eliminate any possibilities for life - even if the star itself is calm ? 
  chainreactioncycles.com has 1 year free return policy ( at least in the uk , not sure about the rest ) . 
  dude you could easily play and enjoy age of empires ii with that setup ( game 's still alive and has tourneys all the time ) . 
  i love how that was like step 26 :d, 
  so they cost about the same ?
