  what a beauty . 
  this is it . 
  if you do n't protest this in front of the wh they 'll do anything without a care in the world . 
  not sure about grand ... it 's much smaller than the hungarian parliament . 
  inside 's plated in gold , looks great . 
  a must see imo . 
  [ found this ] ( http://www.handtec.co.uk/garmin-swim-010-01004-00-12819.html?gclid=cj0keqialsrfbrcaxccb54xellebeiqa_ei0doeji4l1v31cxi7gaso1pcfdnwycellettbaxibec58aavfk8p8haq ) , now to see if there 's something that can track both swimming and hiking/cycling ... 
  thanks for all the suggestions guys !, 
  yeah i 'm no pro , just someone who enjoys these things . 
  well there is one [ fairly casual swimming race ] ( http://www.sarkany.hu/balatonatuszas/index.dw?nyelv_id=2&amp;menu=6 ) ( more of an annual group event ) coming up that i 'd like to attend , and i ride a fair bit but other than that i 'm not super serious . 
  they were handy bginging shopping bags home though . 
  thanks for the input , i 'll settle for only a gopro now and will see where to go from there once i played around with it for a while . 
   edit : currency, 
  did you just fuck up the main damn part of your comment ? 
  do i read it right that it has free speed/cadence sensor included ? 
  this looks like a really good deal !, 
  how did it fit on a bike ? 
  i 'm running a very short stem . 
  also , how was battery time ? 
  i 'm looking at [ this one ] ( http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/new-suunto-ambit3-black-multisport-sport-hr-gps-watch-ss020678000-rrp-310-/182220815833?_trksid=p2141725.m3641.l6368 ) , is it the one you had ? 
  ya physics is fake, 
  even with that i 'd imagine the setup & construction times are significantly reduced compared to more traditional ways . 
  do you people even watch the video ? 
  they say what 's included in that $ 10k and it 's pretty much everyting . 
  well if you see the figures it comes out $ 50 more per m ^ 2 than a regular house would . 
  the primary advantages are speed and compactness i 'd say . 
  imagine just plopping a whole modern village down in a third world country within a week . 
  so [ 245 in 7 minutes ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=10500%2f60*7 ) . 
  ( as of 7 hours in , [ 265 in 7 mins ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/?gws_rd=ssl#q=15900%2f420*7&amp;* ) ), 
  i like how everything just freaks out near the end of the cycle . 
  so about 3, 
  sry , never really visit the sub , was just watching egm2 on yt the past week or so . 
  you tried :o), 
  two completely different games . 
  one 's grand strategy , other 's 4x , they are complex in different ways . 
  no you need that to cope with the inevitable border gore : /, 
  civ iv was great . 
  also there are mods that make it super complex compared to the original ( [ eg . 
  ] ( http://media.moddb.com/images/mods/1/15/14429/rom_2.8_tech_tree_part_1_original.jpg ) rom [ tech tree ] ( http://media.moddb.com/images/mods/1/15/14429/rom_2.8_tech_tree_part_2_original.jpg ) ), 
  of course , i was using it more as an indicator for it, 
  civ vi is super easy unfortunately . 
  i had my hopes up but there 's just not much to that game . 
  and the grand scale feels lost too ( have n't played v so comparing with earlier ones ) . 
  i would n't want to know any of those people . 
  sounds a bit like stellaris in that regard . 
  ... or you like it [ the df way ] ( http://dwarffortresswiki.org/images/4/40/funcomic.png ), 
  ( * [ also in the same vein ] ( http://i.imgur.com/klrurla.jpg ) ), 
  [ there 's no chance someone is n't familiar with this is there ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkbu8b-qvzk ), 
  must collect enough for that mug . 
  [ see it helped this guy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/5yaurn/barcelona_61_paris_sg_sergio_roberto_905/dep7dw3/ ), 
  * if this is estarting like this , e-stay-tunis call all the biewers from the china stream and gogogo because this is going to be aguasome !, 
  sounds like the girl i last cared about, 
  me too thanks, 
  is that because they 're friends ? 
  we used to do that im kindergarten in hungary but now it would imply stuff . 
   shipping by sea is much cheaper than overland shipping . 
  first i laughed implying a joke then i remembered rivers are a thing, 
   it does n't say what 's actually worng with him, 
  i believe somethinng may be wrong with his head, 
   interacting with multiple people drains my energy . 
  that 's the very definition of introvert though is n't it ? 
  we were talking about `` regular old '' introverts not extremes though . 
  ** select difficulty **, 
  chieftain <, 
  prince, 
  king, 
  emperor, 
  now that 's what i 'm talkin ' about !, 
  you can actually play ttd with [ openttd ] ( http://www.openttd.org/en/ ) on any opsys , i have it installed too . 
  played with my brother a bit back on lan , was quite fun !, 
  i am all ... um where is this going, 
  i was unsure why you said that then i scrolled down . 
  phoney !, 
   like i do n't need gold for no damn reason . 
  you 're damn right about that, 
  sinks are tricky yo, 
  yeah it 's like 21,000 km ^ 2, 
  dude there was just one, 
  we 've all been there . 
  about 3, 
  so everyone * but * the ones actually battling and managing to keep the ottomans in check for hundreds of years . 
  what a cunt move . 
  yeah that 's what i mean , compare one decisive action in a battle to centuries fighting the turks . 
  croatia were in pu with hungary at that time , ofc they fought them . 
  but they were n't the main force behind the resistance . 
  i read that in kurtjmac 's voice, 
  or stalin, 
  you mean / r/f1isfuckinglit, 
  2016 and 2017 have had some damn good political dramas so far, 
  op , can you summarize the game in 5 words ? 
  this mattis guy may be the only sane person that trump appointed so far . 
  ended up going with a 910xt just as you said . 
  should arrive within a week !, 
  b'twin ? 
  also are those nukeproof flats ? 
  not ooc , op filmed it . 
  [ look at this babe ] ( http://nukeproof.com/wp-content/uploads/mega-275-gallery-2.jpg ), 
  yeah that 's true , maybe a mod could address that issue . 
  viper 's like the judit polgar of aoe, 
  awesome , thanks for the info .
