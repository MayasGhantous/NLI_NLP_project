  i do n't mind that it 's fairly basic as i 'm primarily concerned about grammar and it seems to convey that part quite well . 
  cheers !, 
  euiv thread on the top . 
  ` tis what i like to see . 
  are you 12, 
  thanks for the jif < :o), 
  i did my part by upvoting you, 
  repercussion, 
  during the pueblo incident : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_pueblo_ ( ager-2 ) #pueblo _ incident, 
  i was unsure , thanks for the heads up . 
  i remember you from your first ever football game where you beat us 2-1 . 
  and of course water polo !, 
  civ iv had quite decent ai . 
  the one i most recently played was iii . 
  yeah it was great , had about 4 tiers in civ i and was even featured on the main screen . 
  added a nice little flavor to the whole game . 
  i missed the randomly generated cityscapes from i , there was a much stricter filler system for iii . 
  now we do n't even have city view screens anymore though . 
  ( barely ever played civ ii , rather ii : test of time and c-evo at that time ), 
  otoh i thought iv countered death stacks with collateral damage quite neatly . 
  there could 've been a per tile limit though ( or was there ? ), 
  i mean in that sense it was pretty much still present in iv too . 
  but i do love my separate screens . 
  [ they were so neat ] ( http://scientificgamer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/city.jpg ) . 
  [ felt like portraits of cities ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v77abeh.png ) .

  good old redeye,

  wwhat is your patreon tho ? 
  reminds me of all the amazing [ knights of honor sound tracks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rxqxt_slho ),

  boy does that seem time inefficient . 
  it 's a smart : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smart_ ( marque ), 
  * edit : it is . 
  ukraine is in europe . 
  i just walk into a city , buy a pike or 2-range axe and piggyback off it . 
  that 's more tactical than strategic though . 
  it was kind of a mix between crusader kings and battle brothers . 
  you could build empires , random/custom ones could pop up and you had the ability [ to fight the battles yourself ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4rutsghx4 ) controlling your armies ' specific units . 
  [ i also loved the intro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnshhkbcvnw&amp;t=35s ) ... gave me goosebumps every time . 
   a spot on the edge of the formation that was considered especially dangerous because the germans loved to target the edges instead of shooting straight through the middle of the formation, 
  why was that ? 
  [ massachuse ** tt ** s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massachusetts ), 
  boy would i want to hang that in my future apartment op . 
  what the hell are you all waiting for ? 
  get out on the streets , make your voices heard !, 
  how does it look like if you shave its head as well ? 
  you 're not supposed to ? 
  never played v but played i , iii and iv to death . 
  this i have 30 hours in . 
  [ c-evo ] ( http://c-evo.org/ ) was a thing too , also free ; feels like a neater civ ii . 
  did * vssadmin list shadowstorage * from elevated cmd prompt , it returned nothing . 
  [ it found it !, 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fk3c4zi.png ) however i ticked the initial box to run as admin as well as in the special settings ( via the shortcut ) , running it with right click -  run as admin but it still denies me access when i try to delete it . 
  this is the only created user profile on the computer and it 's ticked in as sys admin . 
  thank you i found it with treesize free just now and it indeed shows [ recovery files ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fk3c4zi.png ) taking up all that space . 
  lol , feels like running through the server room with a wooden club destroying data with shift delete . 
  will do now , thanks for all the help !, 
  alright i did everything that 's said [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdhacyjofvs ) , it started running then stopped quite early in the process but after some time has passed . 
  restarted the computer , ran it again , now it completes in almost an instant but the shadow copies are still there and no space has been freed . 
  i 'm thinking at this point that my dell recovery is messing things up . 
  how can it click if you have n't seen it ? 
  so damn close ... some were already congratulating him lol, 
  right or honest , there 's a difference . 
  woox . 
  but 3rd person was [ this guy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/6f7h7b/4th_infernal_cape/?st=j3j9nrip&amp;sh=3ca0b292 ) . 
  is that what you call hotseat on consoles ? 
  i * loved * it back in the day . 
  and the graphics still look pretty decent . 
  you can build an empire \u00e1 la ck/eu while being able to partake in the battle just as in tw as you said . 
  certainly worth a try if you have that few extra bucks . 
  [ remember the intro ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnshhkbcvnw&amp;t=37s ) still gives me goosebumps . 
  `` just watching people dying boss '', 
  but then he would n't be asking such an obvious question . 
  you 're supporting a less rich game ? 
  no offense but what 's the point of that , apart from safeguarding the devs ' feelings ? 
  do they plan on adding more content though ? 
  he tried just that about 1 second into the gif . 
  ^ when you try too hard to discredit everything, 
  alright i 'm not getting my hopes up for this game then . 
  have n't played a lot since release either , anyone to enlighten me on the state of sector management lately ? 
  i despised it for being basically an essential mistreatment back in the day ( if i was to expand that is ) . 
  reminds me of cubeworld ... 
  ooh second colonisation here we come, 
  that 's about the best investment they could make for the longevity of the game . 
  look at kerbal space program , mount & blade , ckii , minecraft , euiv , civilization series , stellaris , starsector , skyrim or literally any game that 's opened up for mods . 
  i ca n't possibly see how this argument would stand unless you assume the devs just want quick profit then leg it . 
  is this screen a part of some expansion/dlc ? 
  have n't played in a while . 
  what effect does it have ? 
  duels and leading flanks personally ? 
  or just rp stuff ? 
   once we 've colonized a few thousand star systems , searched a healthy portion of the milky way , and still have n't found intelligent life, 
  boy do i want to live in the far future reading such lines . 
  although we are the luckiest from an `` available knowledge '' point of view to be born yet , i feel like we 've born way too early for anything really significant , however relative that might be [ .
