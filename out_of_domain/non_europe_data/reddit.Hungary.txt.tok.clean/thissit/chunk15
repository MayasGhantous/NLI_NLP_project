  looks like we are back to our decades long form . 
  't was a pleasure being somewhat decent for the past couple years . 
  we exhausted all our football related effort and talent for the next 10 decadess during that . 
  found our old selves, 
  i guess it 's nice that we could participate in a historical day for them at least . 
  spoiler : she wo n't say that, 
  yeah that was supposed to be 10 years but it 's probably more fitting this way anyways .

  for # 169 ? 
  you can buy a factory refurbrished garmin 910xt for # 40 less off e-bay . 
  that 's how i got mine a couple of months ago , works perfectly ever since . 
  that 's how i got my pr , wanted to die from the 2nd km on but kept the pace and form and somehow managed to survive it . 
  granted i 've only been running for about 3 months so it 's not indicative of anything ... ,

  looks a bit like a protoss army with [ colossi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t8nsn3-shq&amp;t=6m59s ) and stalkers . 
   if i happen to flip-turn and glide underwater for more than a minimal amount, 
  i thought it was the opposite way that the more you glide the easier the watch realizes that you took a turn ? 
  hence i tried to glide as much as possible . 
  i do n't know if i was able to freestyle a 5.2 km race the whole way through . 
  this is a strange coincidence but this time i accidentally set it to yards instead of meters and it pretty much corrected the watch 's miscounts !, 
  it would 've counted 3268 m on a 3003 m swim but 3268 yards turned out to be 2988 meters !, 
  i think i 'll keep it this way for the time being . 
  i have a 5200m race coming up , my plan is to eat plenty before and maybe bring some more if i feel hungry during , or at around halfway mark . 
  are there any reasons not to eat ~ right before a longer swim ? 
   much more significant, 
  you mean much less ? 
  ah i see now how he meant that , cheers . 
  three mentions , three different spellings . 
  you are in tune with the message of the post , op !, 
  ten what ? 
  [ probably about the same height ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utwhpmlvp48 ), 
  will try it , thanks for the tip . 
  would prefer if the race went as smooth as possible . 
  damn , manual with a skateboard !, 
  appreciate it !, 
  so far i 'm swimming a continuous 3k without any problems , have good feelings about 5k too . 
  does it include may 's political career ? 
  one 's way more useful for politicians than the other though . 
   in their assertion that explosives were used to demolish the buildings in a controlled manner, 
  yes i believe they were of the `` planes with tons of combustible liquid slamming into the building '' type . 
  also you have to not even have elementary knowledge of physics if you do n't understand that there is a huge difference between compromising the structural integrity of the entire cross section of a building and a surface burn . 
  it 's just ridiculous really . 
  because she got tons of flak for visiting the disaster area and avoiding talking to the victims/victims ' relatives . 
  for me 3.14159 is by far enough for everyday calculations , it 's easy to remember ( 14-15 , 9 ) and that 9 makes you only miss the remaining < 0.00001 value . 
  that 's a good point , i think i got used to enter it manually working with a pocket calculator . 
  wait we were supposed to stop ? 
  i think the glide was it . 
  just finished a 5000m session with little to no gliding on turn and the error was 4 lengths after doing 152 . 
  manually counting for 2.25 hours is a bit of a pain though . 
  the only thing spreading is the delusion in your mind about your relevance . 
  they also have this cult of ignorance which is laughable . 
  how can it be cool to be dumb ? 
  i never understood that . 
   that i did n't find this post even mildly interesting, 
  buut then why did you make all this effort to scroll through the entire thread and even comment yourself ? 
  i mean you 're honest about it at least, 
  that 's cool !, 
  thanks for the heads up . 
  would be nice to see it integrated into the base game though . 
  looks like a screenshot from a game . 
  are you saying that you 're a burglar yourself ? 
  if i was them i found it offensive that you considered me such an unstable fragile snowflake . 
  if i really cared about my work i would welcome all constructive criticism . 
  normal people are able to consider certain things without being on the edge of having a nervous breakdown because of them . 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  yeah you 're * way * too sensitive if you consider constructive criticism insults . 
  and even if someone actually insulted you ( which , again , criticism is n't ) do you expect to live in a safe little bubble online ? 
  just how sheltered can you get . 
  not sure how you interpreted `` considering things '' as `` not contributing '' but i 'll let you have it . 
  i 'll just let you read the thread comments and decide this for yourself, 
  let 's hope for no tuck no-handers or flipwhips though, 
  are you implying they have n't invented homemade sandwiches yet ? 
  he probably knows he got away with it though , got enough routine to just let everything stay as is . 
  3:42 lmao which race was that ? 
  i get your point , seb 's was a gut reaction not a calculated one for advantage . 
  damn he really is the maldonator . 
  is juming out that fast legal anyway ? 
  c'mon guys , why downvote him for an opinion ? 
  stewards stated he did n't brake at all though ? 
  then `` forgot '' to accelerate out and it caught seb off-guard ? 
  but why choose to leave more space right in/after a turn ? 
  damn , went down fast , like a ferry . 
  the highlight is neat but you completely missed the sync . 
  you can see szisz ferenc 's statue at the hungaroring . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's still connected to the neck . 
  schumi got second anyway !, 
  is there actually no footage of that ?
