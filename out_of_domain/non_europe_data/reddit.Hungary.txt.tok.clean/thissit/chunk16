  only found the aftermath . 
  what message does it convey if you drop dead last half a minute into the race because you got scared of your teammate ? 
  rotate 90 \u00b0 to the left, 
  those cars looked so good . 
  `` ffffuuck this is bad ... let 's take another sip '', 
  `` bitch , i 'm coming through '', 
  honestly though , the guy jumped in front of that car in that case . 
  i * hope * this is some kind of satire . 
  badly synced video . 
  at 00:45 [ he 's already asking for it ] ( https://streamable.com/p9n8k ) . 
  but they will . 
  the public does n't matter anymore in the us . 
  look at his eyes , he 's not finished, 
  that 's a good interviewer . 
  several chose li-ming in hgc yesterday ( today ) . 
  well genji was banned often as well . 
  [ she seems pretty viable ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nze9zae.jpg ), 
  i 've played 50 + in the first few days . 
  leveled stitches twice lol . 
  no i agree with the second part of your comment , i was referring to the first . 
  what 's the joke here ? 
  yeah i got that part , was just wondering about seed vs sauce . 
  other guy pointed out the cultural aspect though . 
  that 's all ? 
  not even spicy . 
  `` bronies only '', 
  how exactly, 
  have they just misspelled finnicky ? 
  watch it in 0.5 x speed for actual real speed . 
  thread did not disappoint . 
  yup great guy . 
  [ they always have a good time ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61vqmcjylq8 ) during commentary , he loves f1 . 
  as is tradition, 
  so he was like verstappen nowadays ( minus the technical failures . . ) ? 
  i 'm calling a red bull 1-2 with possible verstappen victory . 
  not too impressed with his prac so far . 
  mostly dropbears, 
  [ honeybadgers are just * craazy * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb6bwsa_ldq&amp;t=15s ), 
  she sounds and looks like turk 's gf/wife from scrubs . 
  what do you mean you did n't like [ this beauty ] ( http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/xpb_804597_hires.jpg ) ? 
  did not expect palmer ahead of massa-stroll . 
  ` tis what they do between two stonings, 
  trash tier ... 
  should we refund your money perhaps ? 
  we might have to wait for that a few days though since his hospital visit pics have just been on the front page . 
  yes, 
  he is . 
  daughter-in-chief : `` i do n't know what that means '', 
  guy 's a huge potential with such bad luck . 
  yes, 
  sensors talk . 
  others have done it as well without penalty . 
  i know you really want to blame him but there 's no point . 
  [ damn right ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynatzv8qs1i ), 
  well i did it for fun . 
  did n't expect it to pop up here though . 
  no harm i guess ? 
  surprisingly accurate for your contribution to the thread . 
  what if it was a joke, 
  you remind me of [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz-md56jk9y ), 
  how about balatonakarattya or k\u00e9zdiv\u00e1s\u00e1rhely ? 
  we have plenty of such , 
  [ works every time ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsxv3mhmcq4 ), 
  clarification : if your points reset you 'll still be able to relocate them on the new tree , essentially rebuilding the character . 
  ** train ** ing ... 
  what is the blue car ? 
  looks sweet . 
  thanks !, 
  how did it fare ? 
  well that 's unfortunate ... 
  thanks for the insight !, 
  guess we know he writes these himself at least . 
  wow it really is amazing . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo8vafqhtta ) 's schumacher and rosberg driving two different w196s . 
  i usually let others take photos and videos and enjoy stuff myself then ask for their recordings afterwards . 
  i would 've said water there . 
  that 's a bit random is n't it ? 
   assuming he does n't drive into the back of whichever poor bastard is staying still in front of him ... 
  i thought that role was deserved for the torpedo, 
  the car 's front is the shield nowadays , if you will, 
  yep , after ricciardo wins from dead last as is tradition, 
   even if he 's right, 
  note : you 're still able to swim upwards . 
  so if you ever sink with a ship you still have chance ... some . 
  yeah , like `` fia tier 2 drivers should not complain '' ... 
  just like race kimi vs interview kimi . 
  tbh this was less cringey than some f1 interviews lately . 
  well mr. torpedo is fairly back ... 
  uk took his sweet roll, 
  curves back and sinks own sub . 
  i laughed when grosjean blamed someone ( ca n't recall who ) for his own blatant driving error . 
  well do something about it , / u/audeclis, 
  so that 's only 1.5 with one move , not quite in form daniil . 
  i mean palmer was set up for a decent race for him , only the car was n't feeling it . 
  [ mr. kvyat sends his regards ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kqgsjyjc2m&amp;t=8m10s ), 
  i mean this race when he went off track barely keeping it together prior , then they played his radio . 
  who was that against ? 
  i think grosjean was in the wrong there . 
  thanks for posting this !, 
  our native commentators translate over it in hungary .
