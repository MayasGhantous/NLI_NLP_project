  always better to hear the original . 
  i like who voted ` average ' on toro rosso . 
  `` yup , just another day with kvyat '', 
  that ending sealed it for me . 
  k\u00fcmi, 
  any vid of this ? 
  hungary beat them 20-11 but hungary is the brazil of water polo so that 's acceptable . 
  well this comment thread was a rollercoaster . 
  that 's their purpose, 
  do you remember a similar racing anime , saw it like 15-20 years ago ... at the end they were running 8 + tyre cars . 
  something grand prix was its name maybe . 
  never found out what it was , i was too little . 
  search for that topic with the sub search -- , 
  nice !, 
  found [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=new2gd707me ) as the intro ? 
  what would you think happen if he took a surprise wdc ? 
  surely wolff would n't discharge him then ? 
  why did they drop this anyway ? 
  i 've heard complexity ? 
  but iirc it was superior in handling to the others , was n't it ? 
  really showcasing his work at toro rosso lately . 
  which means that a single paratrooper could capture the entire island, 
  norway & sweden : `` yeah , finland 's got this '', 
  haha that 's great . 
  thanks man . 
  ejyafjallaj\u00f6kull or something ? 
  that does n't clear anything up . 
  p. . . poke it out, 
  rosberg who ? 
  all those look fantastic . 
  better start winning more wdcs if you want to reach schumi 's record . 
  makes perfect sense, 
  that 's the most british video i 've seen in a while . 
  with all due respect the music is still there, 
  have n't heard of a single person playing it in hungary . 
  some say it 's pretty boring actually , full of statistics and expected moves ? 
  you talk to your postman ? 
  what for ? 
  no , sometimes i sign as well . 
  oh and thankyous . 
  bitches love thankyous . 
  he looks like donald duck, 
  scandinavian by chance ? 
  studied danish a bit myself , hungary here . 
  :d nice !, 
  some cs : go fans also did shoeys before . 
  the maldonator, 
  i do n't think there 's need for artificial tension here . 
  genius !, 
  `` monaco without walls '' , i like that nickname . 
  it still has an active scene !, 
  there are tournaments left and right . 
  check out [ membrillo ] ( https://www.twitch.tv/membtv ) for example , he streams them every day and one of the bigger streamers for aoc . 
  talk about driving on the limit . 
  awesome . 
  i like that dc reference to him later too . 
  [ :d ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sy7cfrosce ), 
  hamilton 's `` i 'm a driver '', 
  [ gif with sound ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s779gdngdy ), 
  [ heyguys ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/ferenc_szisz_at_the_1914_french_grand_prix_%283%29.jpg ), 
  we still play it on win10 . 
  works just fine . 
  she 's [ yuja wang ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yuja_wang ) , one of the best contemporary pianists . 
  they do look similar though from profile !, 
  idk , not entirely sold , they do n't really look like flip-flops, 
  rip other fe teams ? 
  what is fanboost ? 
  well that 's an interesting way of making people care more about the drivers . 
  would be silly to keep once the series got really serious . 
  thanks for filling me in !, 
  ask our boy ric ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i also do n't like how qm , unranked and even vs ai are counted together as statistics . 
  you can statpad all day farming ai . 
   bottomline : yes , ai and if i might say even qm should n't even be mentioned in statistics . 
  agree on both , it goes against what they should be for . 
  [ my favourite with kimi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgl6a4hntwy&amp;t=7s ), 
  wait , was he trying to extinguish the flames himself ? 
  [ here 's another fun one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyo2y2zzs4y ), 
  hungarians cheering for kimi :d, 
  [ removed ], 
  i 've been having mixed success ( rank 9 to 4 ) with ignoring minions until they have spent both their resurrects - or if they make the mistake of dropping a weaker minion . 
  it 's usually down to a few points of hp if they play it properly , then the priest overwhelms . 
  how do you see the matchup ? 
  edit : why is this tagged as spoilers ? 
  [ i remember it ] ( http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/51-unbound-elemental ) being pretty much a staple in shaman decks . 
  with many shamans running overload cards , it could see at least * some * play , could n't it ? 
  compared to pre-apotheosys quit ? 
  * got it , pretty dead . 
  [ something like this is what i have in mind . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1yfbo5cqgs ), 
  thanks for your help !, 
  also if i buy a physical ( dvd ) copy can i install it on other pcs ? 
  thanks !, 
  hey , i 've just found out you ca n't run [ the original mep tetris ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tetris ) on windows 7 . 
  was wondering if you know of any clones that ~ match the original and work with newer windows editions ? 
  cheers !, 
  might not be the exact way it works , i just ca n't recall it !, 
  in my opinion it is n't as significant as in previous games . 
  ca n't comment on v but for example in iii you had this full screen short play every time , really felt like something notable has happened . 
  will there be hotseat multiplayer in vi ?
