  have n't seen anything about it yet . 
  back in civ iii and iv we had to research the majority of techs in all eras in order to advance to the next one . 
  with civ vi in its current state , you can basically skip eras with certain techs , having ignored some really basic ones an era or two before . 
  it 's like a drop back to civ i where you could have paved roads for your dirt huts in your cities ; kills the historical immersion quite a bit . 
  if you 're not going for a cultural victory , tourism is absolutely worthless - even though it 's supposed to be something major wonders produce for you . 
  why is n't there some practical role for it ? 
  gold per * n * amount of tourism , culture or some great people points ? 
  something !, 
  i 'd like to settle anywhere , just akin to i-iv , without the huge red areas on map . 
  [ solution found !,

  bought it back in alpha , would like to track my hours in steam !, 
  thanks for the replies !, 
  [ from the sidebar . 
  ] ( http://www.25quiz.com/ ) i 've found myself agreeing with it the most out of all tests regarding myself , even if it 's only 25 questions . 
  thoughts ? 
  for most of the time i feel calm , collected and rational . 
  if something produces emotion in me ( `` gets to me '' ) however , it can get quite overwhelmingly strong . 
  it feels like i 'm overly sensitive sometimes about things others might just shrug off . 
  is it just the undeveloped feeling ? 
  or unrelated ? 
  how do you perceive emotions ? 
  most of the time , i either do something thoroughly or shrug it off and barely put any effort in . 
  be it work , thinking about something or just expresssing myself in writing . 
  tend to not walk a fine line with things . 
  but i feel better when i 'm actually doing stuff, 
  probably because that way you can have proper , meaningful discussions ; i actually enjoy that every once in a while . 
  in groups i barely say a word . 
  all seem to be out of stock this time around :(, 
  how will that work out for a 5 ' 6 '' rider ? 
  i really wanted a voodoo bizango so i may have already bought one with those specs ... :d, 
  is there a comprehensive guide on what torque should your bolts be tightened to or can you go with just everything on 5nm ? 
  asking for a hardtail . 
  tried in lower gear , higher gear , i just could n't get enough power in . 
  i can pull it over the balance point if i fully commit to the proper manual technique . 
  i should be able to pull it up for wheelie too right ? 
  it 's 26 % of my body weight btw . 
  when i watch others ' footage i sometimes look at what lines would i take , then compare it to the rider filming . 
  i find it quite fun . 
  i may have , um , accidentally taken off my rear derailleur . 
  put it back on , the bike shifts fine but there 's some clicking left . 
  any ways to nail derailleur positioning ? 
  what to look for ? 
  thanks !, 
  say , i was to record the entire trip including getting to the trail , climbing , riding it down , going home . 
  is there a way to separate these parts to see stats separately ( like it does every n distance ) ? 
  with the intention of lowering my handlebars , i rearranged the spacers . 
  tightened the mid bolt first , then the stem bolts to the suggested 8nm . 
  the front does n't wobble when i ride normally but when i pull on the front brake there is some play ( with audible clanking sounds ) that makes it feel unsafe . 
  [ here 's the cockpit . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i39zdbk.jpg ) is there anything else i can do to stop the wobble ? 
  hey all !, 
  i was discussing something and found myself writing down this comment :, 
  * but the question of how real a threat russia actually is could itself be an entire separate thread i 'd say . 
  in retrospect the word order seems a bit curious . 
  is it right and if not , how would you change it to be correct ? 
  cheers !, 
  have n't mastered it yet but mine has to be the manual . 
  it 's super useful , base of several skills and just looks cool . 
  how about you ? 
  looking to purchase a starter bike for my brother , was wondering about the reputation of ghost ? 
  this is the one :, 
  i have a garmin edge 20 for cycling and was wondering if those gamin watches for example would work for this ? 
  what do you use to track your swimming ? 
  thanks !, 
  would like to have a jack of all trades watch , something like [ this ] ( http://www.handtec.co.uk/garmin-swim-010-01004-00-12819.html?gclid=cj0keqialsrfbrcaxccb54xellebeiqa_ei0doeji4l1v31cxi7gaso1pcfdnwycellettbaxibec58aavfk8p8haq ) merged with [ this ] ( http://www.wiggle.co.uk/garmin-edge-25-gps-cycle-computer/ ) . 
  fairly affordable if possible . 
  what do you use ? 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm planning on investing in a gopro or similar camera and was wondering what camera/gimbal/etc you use for recording ? 
  how come they were only played once the whole tournament ? 
  were they just too outclassed by the rest ? 
  was wondering what were the main reasons behind this , considering the kingdom of hungary kept the ever expanding ottomans in check for about 200 years . 
  seems as if poland received all glory and recognition for the whole struggle , something that mostly hungary should have ? 
  [ removed ], 
  heard something about extra fees due to counter terrorism or something similar ... ? 
  does it work properly now or do you use outdoors for it as well ?

  ### training, 
  prior to this i 've only ever ran 2x 10km so i was up to challenging myself on a 30 % longer distance !, 
  felt that i had more in me at the previous 10km effort so i arrived ( carefully ) confident to the race . 
  coming up to the event i ran 3km easy runs every 2 days or so , rode a good amount , generally trying to keep in form without pushing too hard . 
  the day before i ran a half distance , 7k , in normal pace ( which i planned to do the day before but it was , you guessed it , raining ! ), 
  which felt quite refreshing . 
  was still feeling it in my legs a bit but did n't bother me during the race . 
  met up with family , was running with my younger cousin . 
  we expected rain and we got rain !,
