  dot, 
  * user was banned for this post *, 
  what 's with the stun & block recovery though ? 
  first lab i 've done i did n't know about enchant . 
  just grabbed the treasure , ascended then went on my merry way . 
  it was only in normal so it probably did n't matter much though . 
  [ 1200 + ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8alxbofd_eq ), 
  * edit : nothing too special though, 
  yet . 
  too bad that a mental/emotional infant was developing it, 
  dig her grave up and, 
  man you were really courteous . 
  cause russians have balls, 
  but an alch is 1/3 chaos, 
  i would still know what i 'm looking at if it was named `` 1fus '' . 
  you just killed it , you monster, 
  global 5,055 and the guy probably answered to `` is anyone here '' with the `` sure '' . 
  well not like it 's mandatory , if you give the fuses you 're subscribing to the rules . 
  you can pressure in chat for increased rewards , obviously these guys just went with it while they probably shouldnt 've . 
   i 've yet to find a game with more depth than dota 2, 
  ever played dwarf fortress ? 
  it does so long as you believe mom that you 're the centre of the universe . 
  worst off , sometimes my game defaults to the login screen when i tab back , after like 10 seconds of black screen . 
  this is what i do with decent leveling rares . 
  people always tell me they will . 
  you can also join/create an xp party at dried lake or similar . 
  talk about overreaction . 
  nice, 
  i have a simple robe like this, 
  tbh doing nothing for 4 turns is bad . 
  more of a reminder really . 
  do you have a skill tree to show perhaps ? 
  thanks man !, 
  man , if only i did n't have to climb through four acts three times every single time , i would make all these cool builds . 
  certainly would have more than 1-2 main chars . 
  ggg 's trying to tell us something, 
  anecked, 
  me too thanks, 
   repeating of course, 
  1000 star 2-arm galaxies ftw . 
  which part of a whale is this ? 
  i wonder how do you know ? 
  tabulas are like 10c though . 
  noobish question , how do you know what 's suffix and prefix by looking at the stuff ? 
  for winning the ventor 's lottery, 
  same in central/eastern and southern europe . 
  i 'm more interested in how will it fare vs iv . 
  looking good so far . 
  because i never played it ; but that makes me hopeful for vi as well though i 've heard nothing about it yet . 
  that 's the thing , i do n't feel the need to reduce map size below 1k because i 've never played long enough to get to 1fps states . 
  damn , we were planning to purchase it together , 3 of us , so that all of us can play it . 
  if there 's a single steam client restriction , even with the physical copy , that sucks . 
  iii and iv you could buy and install without steam . 
  we need to burn out on dried lake < 3 before next act hits . 
  every time a mirror drops , just assume it 's fake . 
  chill times . 
  [ happened with iii and iv .

  why is stun & block recovery this good ? 
  i was making a joke there but thanks for the proper reply regardless !, 
  i thought she sounded really silly that way . 
  what could it be ... mmmmaps ? 
  dat 6.9 life regen is sexy, 
   edit : i have aids . 
  good effort . 
  `` how could i make this explode '', 
  is that fried vomit ?

  man you must 've been like a vacuum cleaner . 
  would you do it the proper way though ? 
  not like the guy in the op but around the tower . 
  i think actually trusting the ropes that safeguard you is a big part in the perception of danger . 
  unless you have height phobia . 
  although not like the other games you mentioned , [ planetside 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm0_u_vtu1c ) pops in mind . 
  it 's probably the best mmo-ish fps shooter out there . 
  yeah if you join the same faction ( they are just like in ps1 ) , add your friends then invite them to a squad/platoon . 
  it 's rather intuitive and you start off in the tutorial with a new account when you log in for the first time . 
  it pops you in a random squad on the tutorial continent ( below rank 20s ) but you can leave both the squad and the contient whenever you like to . 
  yeah i downloaded and set it up , it 's good enough for an alternative , thanks for the heads up !, 
  thank you based bot, 
  found the scot . 
  but these poor sods have to feel cool somehow . 
  why would anyone be ? 
  out of this world, 
  indeed it is , thanks !, 
  glad i preordered . 
  you could always play aoc on voobly or steam . 
  game 's still alive and kicking . 
  do you cook with gasoline ? 
  yeah , ended up preordering to my steam acc . 
  i 've paid half the price the other two 25-25 % . 
  can always just share when we ca n't play hotseat , as you said it . 
  we used to play through whole summers with civ iii . 
  you would be correct, 
   they 're wearing gear that you get from bosses that are further into the dungeon , meaning they would have to have beaten it . 
  well they do say in the vid that this fight 's given them a lot of trouble in the past . 
  ^ ^ ^ except ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ chums ^ ^ ^ up, 
  best i can do is 2c, 
  `` fell '' from op 's hand,
