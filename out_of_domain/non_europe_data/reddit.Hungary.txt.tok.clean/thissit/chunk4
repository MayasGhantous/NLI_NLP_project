  wish we just had an [ f3 screen ] ( http://img.bhs4.com/e8/7/e8731bffe657120eebc685c16a45928b7e3b355a_large.jpg ) like back in the day . 
  or just more summary screens in general . 
  and add more techs . 
  i mean , you go from horseback riding to engineering , how does it make sense ? 
  the fog of war fade really should n't apply to the minimap . 
  i 'd rather lose a shirt than stress out to the point of breaking down crying . 
  it 's easy to be smart 70 + years later . 
  so are there any practical benefits from it like counting as culture towards civic research ? 
  have you just won poe ? 
  i do n't think there 's a better one in standard either . 
  and you can still see [ the cothon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cothon ) , carthage 's military ( ? ), 
  harbour in the current city . 
  [ apparently it looked like this ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i1ptasu-wt8/vhy_bjww3wi/aaaaaaaaffi/pbfefrszwey/s1600/the_harbour_of_carthage_by_radojavor-d5mqulu.jpg ) . 
  really cool . 
  best i can do is 8 jewelers, 
  but certainly the most satisfying, 
  do people ever ask for 2 mirrors ? 
  i saw that 1000 + es chest the other day . 
  insane things around ... 
  aka egg ? 
  `` do you accept hugs ? '', 
  [ what do you mean ` miss ' ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npjoslcr2he ), 
  that sounds good , goes well with the general approach to amenities & housing too . 
  how can one live without pastries . 
  different role than us ones . 
  ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ told, 
  feelssovietman, 
   go join the firefighters or s&r team, 
  if only i had 20/20 vision . . 
  in no particular order , off the top of my head : dark souls , civilization , hearthstone , minecraft , planetside , crusader kings , rift , savage xr , world of tanks , path of exile, 
  from [ chopin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvm2zsrv3c8 ) to [ cannibal corpse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjuo-siw8lk ) anything that catches my ear . 
  i find realizing that all those people do n't care about me liberating . 
  i can get the sensation/positive aspects of liveliness and solitude at the same time . 
  but then again sometimes you just wish there were some people to care about and be cared about by , among them . 
  is it just a european thing ? 
  because we have it in hungary . 
  0 , they would evaporate . 
  what an amazing piece . 
  i only found karajan today and found his ways absolutely phenomenal . 
  welp that 's off my bucket list then . 
  yeah i would n't mind being born about 10-20 years from now so that i could experience biomechanically enhanced life in a not-only-in-lab way . 
  \\  hungary, 
  \\  balkans, 
  putin 's russia is n't balkans though . 
  i do , it 's right between l and \u00e1 on the keyboard . 
  well you have no knowledge of the future living in the present . 
  giant earth map ? 
  ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ fake, 
  [ expect they are far away from that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pannonian_basin ) , completely within the pannonian basin . 
  culturally even less so . 
  fun fact : pianists can have [ 1200 + ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8alxbofd_eq ) apm . 
   these retards will realize appeasement doesnt work soon enough . 
  yeah if history has taught us anything then it 's that it does n't do jack shit with determined opportunistic ones . 
  just ask chamberlain how did it pan out for him . 
  at least they got their # 350m back, 
  [ 88.57 weeks ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=31000000000%2f350000000 ) so about [ 94-99 % ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=88,57+weeks ) of an elephant 's gestation period . 
  it really helps the rp immersion , + + + for it !, 
  there are movies in vi too , though . 
  i think it was like 5000 culture or so ? 
  could been quite insane . 
  you know i have n't even realized vi does n't have dynamic borders until you brought it up . 
  now i long for a mod lol . 
  damn right !, 
  iirc the screenshot in op uses a tileset ( which might have been an alternative in the base game , ca n't recall ) , the standard one is different . 
  to be honest the first arquebuses ( sp ? ), 
  were barely more than inaccurate rock spewing blowpipes . 
  well not to the extent of iv ones , for sure but there 's at least something . 
  although for some reason they 're disabled for me most of the time . 
  not sure which graphics option decides whether they appear or not . 
  one of my absolute favourite fanarts for df . 
  have n't seen it posted here for 3 years so i thought might as well , with the original source . 
  just put a rubber rug on it and call it a day . 
  3 months and 1 sanity, 
  never played v so ca n't comment on that one . 
  escorting is when you have a military unit ( warrior ) and a civilian unit ( settler ) together on one tile - and it lets you link them ( there 's a link icon in that case ) . 
  that is all this is about . 
  but what if you do n't care about victory and just want to build a huge empire efficiently ? 
  then it irks you being so featured yet worthless . 
  the art of getting on and off means of transportation . 
  it was present in iv as well iirc . 
  r5 : while you ca n't actually rename cities upon founding them , if you 'd like to have your own names you can pin their city center district with any name you 'd prefer . 
  it 's not perfect but something until they let us rename !, 
  edit : you can now ; ignore thread , person from the future !, 
  thanks , added explanation !, 
  you can set it to only you , everyone or just specific people . 
  does this build a decent character though ? 
   if you guys are meant to last , you will, 
  i should just hang this out above my head . 
  that is amazing !, 
  thanks for letting us know !, 
  * edit : if you rename the civ ( japan ) to random , will that affect anything else/will it show up as what you named it in-game ? 
  with regards to having only known her for 3 weeks , i think [ this applies ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ctq7mqk.jpg ) to you as well ( i felt strongly about someone recently , might be of use for you too ) . 
  i know my time perception ( as in , how much is enough for a * real * relationship to form ) was way off . 
  so if you were to rename a civilization , how would you go about it ? 
  could you , without messing things up ? 
  thanks !, 
  you can if you zoom in a bit ( or if you click the shield ), 
  as for 11 ) i had phalanx destroy my battleship once in civ i.
