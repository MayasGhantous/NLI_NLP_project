  they said they 'll put it back soon , just have n't gotten around to it yet . 
  that is exactly what i was looking for , thanks a lot !, 
  `` take it easy '', 
  what is the jolly rancher thing ? 
  never stop hoping though .

  you mean heyguyshowsitgoingkrippar ` anhere ? 
  got ta make it look solid so they wo n't try having a go at it . 
  * i will sodomize you and face-fuck you , bottom paul and catamite ringo , you who think , because my lyrics are sensitive , that i have no shame . 
  for it 's proper for a devoted poet to be himself , but in no way is it necessary for his poems . 
  in point of fact , these have wit and charm , if they are sensitive and a little shameless , and can arouse an itch , and i do n't mean in boys , but in those hairy old men who ca n't get it up . 
  because you 've read my countless kisses you think less of me as a man ? 
  i will sodomize you and face-fuck you . 
  * john *, 
  that 's how she feels about me : ^ (, 
  sounds like a day9 kinda thing . 
  [ bit of a mess ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vgirgmb.png ) probably due to not taking enough time to think about the answers, 
  considering it barely could stand up i 'd wager it did n't get far . 
  if i had to choose a quote to summarize the initial ( somewhat ) buggy state of vi up , this would be it .

  `` cancel summon sign ? '', 
  `` yes/cancel '', 
  after all the shit they 've been through . 
  not really , iv outdoes it by far . 
   10-20 hours on average, 
  lmao we used to do summer-long hotseat games with civ iii . 
  civ vi 's style/atmosphere is quite similar to iii 's too . 
  besides that it 's quite a promising game too . 
  no doomstacks and hexagonal tiles might make him dislike it though . 
  what 's up with ikea 's bad reputation over the pond ? 
  in europe they are considered quite decent . 
  certainly v and vi differ the most in general characteristics from the rest of the series . 
  from the previous ones i 'd say iv would worth trying primarily , if one were to . 
  rather go with iv on that tbh .

  well how would you trust the answers if you had n't given them proper thought ? 
  cheers man !, 
  [ not entirely relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9foi342lxqe ), 
  had been . 
  then i `` loved '' . 
  now i wish i had some who cared . 
  probably unrelated to personality though . 
   i think it is only this accurate if the answerer is very certain of their own personality, 
  what i mean is that i would only really trust the results if i was certain i gave the most truthful answers - which requires me to know myself ( and mbti as well ) . 
  ( i do n't mean any of this as an argument for/against the site though ), 
  thank you for the appreciation , i 've put great effort in that comment . 
  computer games ... or just hanging on the net . 
  probably more of an addiction than anything else , though . 
  same as / u/plsno420 , i get excited about something , acquire the required materials/items if i need to , mess around for a bit then never really bother again . 
  it 's kind of the same for liking someone , too . 
  once i feel like they 're `` mine '' , my interest drops drastically . 
  thanks !, 
  i 've heard that danish is n't the easiest to learn though . 
  well i enjoy hiking and cycling ; have n't really dismantled anything since i was a kid ... 
  ( apart from the occasional bike repair ofc ), 
  how long have you known him ? 
  i 've had it happen that i was ( relatively ) quite active socially for a few months then exhausted myself and retreated to my normal introvert self . 
  it was with a smaller group of people not a particular friend though . 
  although i have a tendency to only open up when i have the desire/need , for my own sake ... maintaining friendships just for the sake of it is n't something i strive for ( or can be bothered with too much ) . 
  i had this happen just recently ; there was a work party invitation handout , i asked about whether it 's mandatory then told the boss with a large grin that i 'll be really busy that time around . 
  she understood it was n't out of grudge/spite , though . 
  i think . 
  i 'd assume so , a bike is n't that sophisticated of a machine after all . 
  for more complicated things i 'd definitely check some tutorials for the first time or two . 
  then it 'd probably just click . 
  [ also ; relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u01xasutlvw ), 
  ok where are people like you in my vicinity . 
   it just was a really quick change from hot to cold to hot . 
  that should be fairly normal , i do it all the time . 
  if i do n't , i feel forced to act a certain way which is probably worse for our relationship anyway if sustained . 
  i like the sound of that . 
  yeah ... 
  only if we can sit on some asteroid together , 
  ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ doing ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ right, 
  sounds good , i like me some challenge . 
  and i shall be preparing with ... well i 'll just go and find you then chill beside . 
  and try not to forget to appreciate the effort you 've put in that * amazing * sign somehow !, 
  i think the people sliding off the guns had it worse ... the entire battleship fell on them , probably for certain suffocation had they survived somehow . 
  look , on the upper right there 's a ~ ~ giant ~ ~ tiny slug crawling into it already !, 
  every morning . 
  it 's a fighting game where you can control every single joint/muscle in the body of your fighter . 
  pretty damn awesome ( and free ) . 
  mostly multiplayer , the vid shows them vs target dummy . 
  easy , internet . 
  would you think they 'd be a proper partner ? 
  certainly comes down to person , but in theory , how well do you think it could work out ? 
  would you consider istps among the better or worse partners for intps ? 
  this certainly should n't affect answers but i 'm asking because i suspect a girl i 'm fond of to be intp ( maybe 80 % intp 20 % intj ) . 
  we would either chill and hang out or never even talk , i 'd imagine . 
  so it 's like the oven for an eventually delicious pizza ? 
  i 'm fast at assessing situations , yeah . 
  if for dexterity catching cups before they commit to falling suffices then that too . 
  fun times .
