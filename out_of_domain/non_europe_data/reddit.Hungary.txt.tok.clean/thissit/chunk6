  if you 're loved , you 're lucky, 
  `` i refuse to eat this !! '', 
  global warming update ? 
  that was my point indeed . 
  [ i really like the pie chart part ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gy9t6sr.png ) . 
  as for aesthetics ... well at least you 'll have no doubt whether it 'll load or not i guess . 
  also does n't divert attention from the point with silly pictures and such . 
  `` guidance '' for those unsure whether their istj was accurate . 
  we tend to wrongly score istj sometimes . 
  could be [ . 
  sidebar to the right , change flair . 
  not particularly important though . 
  `` won again . '', 
  you might want to dig a bit more then . 
   i would hazard a guess that istp may be the same ? 
  not sure if it 's specific to istp or not but i generally feel calm and confident . 
  if a problem arises i solve it or let it run its course in me then return to `` all good '' land . 
  * initiates *, 
  i 'd say good effort but it really was n't . 
   shame nobody uses them anymore, 
  [ wat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_nuclear_reactors ), 
  that the internet rocks . 
  there 's more to that ... 
  but yeah . 
  depends on what you desire/expect from the other . 
  or the colour of the microwave . 
   ne can handle abstract thoughts easily while se ca n't bear them . 
  there 's a difference between ca n't handle and ca n't be bothered to handle . 
  did not assume anything ... just curious as i 'm like that . 
   i 'd say that i relate to them by just being myself, 
  that 's an answer right there . 
  * edit : maybe not assertive as i 'm not particularly obnoxious nor force my will unto others . 
  i just prefer my ways generally . 
  excellent . 
  what if one accepts the challenge and proves to be more competent after a debate ? 
   if you 've lost the debate , you 've learnt something new . 
  you 've been challenged to view something in a different way . 
  intps at least are not known for getting too butthurt about being wrong . 
  that 's awesome . 
   and then he posed a different question in a similar vein that i truly did not consider, 
  this is what i tend to do if i 'm inclined to expand upon my idea due to them not understanding my true meaning . 
  problem is , sometimes i just shrug it off and let them think whatever they want to , if it 's only a theoretical debate . 
   edit : i think op is referring to your typical loud `` strongman '' as opposed to referring to intps as `` not confident '', 
  my title is flawed for what i was to ask . 
  i defined assertive in a different/broader sense than i shoud have . 
  but got interesting insights on those too . 
   if you actually read what you posted, 
  you explicitly stated that nobody uses them anymore . 
   here simply is n't the demand today that there was 35 years ago, 
  * demand * will always be there until we master an easier and more universal way . 
  some other concerns than energy providing efficiency might come first which can reduce the * desire * for maintaining the facilites though . 
  all in all , it 's very much present and prevalent in many cases around the world . 
  what 's hsp in your flair ? 
  i like to think of mbti as an approximation from which one can work the real person out , taking specific circumstances into consideration . 
  if you go with type stereotypes or superficial understanding of the jungian system you 're doing it wrong . 
  i like the ti one . 
  [ also , reminiscent of my background . 
  man i wish i was like this at 16 . 
   found this perfectly hungarian anti-soviet rebel at the beach, 
  just theoretically , if it was you what mirror fee would you put on that thing ? 
  i saw the fee for this item as is as 100 ex in the thread :o, 
   i 'm good at being social , * but it exhausts me *, 
  yeah you are introvert . 
  i disenchant every single warrior or rogue card . 
  it 's fun being f2p casual . 
  druid turn 1 coin + innervate + innervate 4/6 taunt easy . 
  incredible . 
  hoping for the best for you !, 
  if it means anything coming from a random stranger over the internet : you seem awesome . 
  stay strong !, 
   pray, 
  do nothing then claim credit for what others , who have done , achieved instead . 
  great idea . 
  i like [ this brown noise ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syf5hpwo3wa&amp;t=86s ) as well . 
  concise , i like it . 
   it actually says a lot about a person, 
  could be about the relationship too . 
  maybe you perceive it differently than what it actually is . 
  coming to this realization one 's already a step ahead standing up from feeling worthless . 
  we discuss what we have concerns about . 
  everything else is fine therefore needs no mention . 
  well we did do the nose ... 
   if i gave you a choice between keeping your brain or your spirituality , would you would choose your spirituality ? 
  spoiler alert : they might 'd choose the latter . 
  [ 27 mins , you were close ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/5gmkop/pretty_great_team_work/datezzd/?st=iwcd5ynu&amp;sh=f5866b45 ), 
  well that 's creative . 
  `` welp , better kill him then '', 
  fun , that was [ my first clan 's name ] ( http://www.newerth.com/?id=stats&amp;action=view_clan&amp;uid=55112&amp;pp=search_username&amp;pk=xenophon ) in savage . 
  there was only me in it of course . 
   curiosity is something that runs deep in me , however it is something i deem a big flaw in my personality, 
  it 's really about what you turn your curiosity towards . 
  in itself i doubt it 's a flaw , quite the contrary most likely . 
   imma clean it either way . 
  that 's where you went wrong . 
  with that you did n't address the question , were just being disobedient . 
  made things more interesting . 
  artosis , tasteless , rachel ... all dem starcraft memories !, 
  welcome to basic physics . 
   has anyone wondered if other species ( like primates ) have similar `` types '' ? 
  certainly .
