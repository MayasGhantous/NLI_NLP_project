  what trades would you suggest ? 
  i was thinking about [ woodworking ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/ ) at some point . 
   dropped out of college because i couldnt stay focused , and because i wasnt sure what i wanted to do with my life . 
  story of my life . 
  hello , i have n't posted here before and just found this sub recently . 
  i , also an istp , am in the same boat as you . 
  i 've found it interesting and funny in this sub to learn how much we can have in common just based on our personalities . 
  in high school and college i did what i needed to get by and pass my classes because that was what was expected of me , i.e. 
  the society and culture that i grew up with . 
  i picked an easy major not thinking about what long term repercussions it could have and got a job out of college where i worked for three years before realizing i could not continue to do an office type job going to the same place doing the same things every day for the foreseeable future . 
  not ever really giving the time of day to think about myself in the sense of what makes me happy and what i enjoy doing gave me a wake up call . 
  so i quit my job that i was unhappy with with the goal of finding a career that i could enjoy throughout life ... which is a lot harder than i thought it would be . 
  i have been see sawing through various ideas like you appear to be and have taken many tests and read many articles and researched quite a few professions but most of the time it overwhelms me and i go back to square one . 
  i know this is not necessarily a response you were looking for , however i wanted to let you know that you are not alone in your quest and that there are others that are facing similar problems . 
  my biggest issue and `` paradox '' ( maybe not the right word ) on the myriad of careers that seem appealing on paper is that committing to one without actual work experience in the field you probably wo n't know if you like it until you are in the profession ... which then takes time to accumulate the knowledge to do so . 
  that 's my take on it at least . 
  i have a passion for fitness and living healthy , so i decided to study and certify to become a personal trainer . 
  i am going to give it a shot before thinking about starting down another road . 
  in the back of my head there 's a voice telling me not to and to go and do something else that i might like better , like a `` grass is greener '' type mentality , but i am sticking to my decision and seeing it through to make sure i give it a chance . 
  i 'm gon na stop there for now because i could go on forever ... i guess my layman 's takeaway for you being stuck and not knowing what to do or think you should do is to try something that you have been thinking about . 
  like the other user said , it 's better than doing nothing . 
  i have thought many times about becoming a police officer too , you should try it , especially since you seem to be considering it . 
  you 'll probably have to go to school for like 6 months and take a test to get in to the academy , at which point you 'll start to become involved in the culture more i would imagine . 
  then , start getting a feel for it . 
  who knows what doors open from there , they may lead you to where you want to go . 
  you never know until you try is what i am always telling myself , not that i always listen , but that 's besides the point . 
  like someone here else said , what 's the worst that could happen ? 
  you do n't like it . 
  you are free to choose another path . 
  in my opinion , any experience and knowledge you gain from one path in life will undoubtedly help you in some way in all others . 
  here you go , tried to break it up a bit for readability 's sake . 
  i 'm thinking about educating myself via youtube then applying for an apprenticeship . 
  is it as simple as going to the local shop and asking whether they accept any apprentices or is there a more formal way of going about it ?

  thank you and thanks for all the heads up .

  good old redeye, 
  i sincerely hope you are but a troll . 
  [ vi 's theme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqyn2p3e06s ) might be even better . 
  i like how some people come here to validate their bm . 
  quite likely the best answer here . 
  i looked a bit into it and apparently the definition is different from what i thought it would be , so apologies on that one . 
  what do you think would be the reason for only barely being able to gain weight ? 
  i could n't push myself above 58kg ( from usual 50-54 ) in 2 + months and i did track my intake ( avg 2500/day ) for every single item during that time . 
  main calorie sources were baked bread , fish fingers , rice , meatballs in tomato , milkshakes , buttered toast , salami . 
  it felt just physically impossible to eat more for me . 
  hm , due to the nature of my job i 'm in shape/muscular but not to the `` extreme '' as most gym-going people are . 
  is there an argument for building up extra muscle apart for pursuing a hobby such as weightlifting ?
