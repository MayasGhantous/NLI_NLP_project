  what if i was to swim or run or cycle ? 
  i 'd assume it all comes down to intensity what you end up accreting ? 
  interesting . 
  thanks for all the info !, 
  can a * fact * be untrue ? 
  from what i can tell it is over . 
  you might can not accept it yet but [ try not to make the same mistake i had made ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=robxupr2gci&amp;t=7s ) . 
  just let him go . 
  it must be nice to know that so many people care about your ass . 
  ah and they are all out . 
  the '17 model is coming next april , do you reckon they 'll restock on the '16 one at some point ? 
  yeah but landing in a city being bombed , right in the bombing line might would 've affected their chances as well . 
  at least he could directly observe his surroundings . 
  good luck stopping a couple 450kg bombs by hand . 
  dude what the fuck, 
  thanks !, 
  i suppose it 's a good way to train myself on proper positioning then . 
  she 's got a slight mj touch to her . 
  ended up buying a '16 voodoo bizango 29er :d, 
  it is fine, 
   i also start on the kiddie slope , and work my way up , instead of leaping off the double black diamonds . 
  i feel like this is the key sentence in here . 
  i love their reactions at the end :d, 
  you should name it vampire cam . 
  what 's the bike ? 
  10 mins flew by :d, 
   this was my 49th marathon, 
  holy shit, 
  then it would 've become a ripple . 
  it 's 1.3 b people 's merit, 
  wrong thread ? 
  haha no worries man , was a good writeup tho . 
  european here , wth is that and why would you litter the scenery with it ? 
  just do n't fall . 
  are there any pump tracks in lincs ? 
  that last one 's got to be the most intense crash ever :d, 
  are you suggesting projectiles migrate ? 
  can you explain ? 
  i 've only heard praise about the bizango 's fork . 
  it 's also 120mm vs the trek 's 100mm . 
  me too thanks, 
  sounds like a plan . 
   exactly . 
  we should appease it, 
  worked with hitler , right , chamberlain ? 
  yeah but not before 70m + people died . 
  thanks , did not !, 
  i was hoping honv\u00e9d would be there . 
  awesome job op !, 
  could 've used c.ronaldo , nevertheless awesome list . 
  yeah i like seeing pusk\u00e1s ' name , 
  as if all traditions were the same . 
   i know that tradition can make order and establish a link between people and the state, 
  glad to help, 
  so the trek 's fork is more convenient to fix ? . 
  assuming op is a newer rider i 'm not sure if he 'll wear the fork down so much as it 'll need replacing/major fixes . 
  you have n't mentioned anything negative about the actual bizango fork itself that 'd warrant dubbing the trek 's the better one tbh . 
  alright , thanks for explaining . 
  yeah , my hovercraft is full of them . 
  i have the manual and just checked everything i got with the bike but there 's nothing about torque in there . 
  it 's a voodoo bizango btw . 
  i 'll take things that never happened for 100, 
  * edit : i stand corrected , that 's sick ( in a not quite positive way ), 
  t\u00e1jsz,

  [ voodoo grips ] ( https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/01/voodoo-maji-2016-grips.jpg ) are like a minefield in this case .
