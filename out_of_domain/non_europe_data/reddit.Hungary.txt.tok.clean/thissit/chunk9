  [ from the wiki  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cathedral_of_light ), 
   the cathedral of light or lichtdom was a main aesthetic feature of the nazi party rallies in nuremberg starting in 1933 . 
  designed by architect albert speer , it consisted of 152 anti-aircraft searchlights , at intervals of 12 metres , aimed skyward to create a series of vertical bars surrounding the audience, 
  dude thats sick, 
  america is a continent fyi, 
  wth you pay that much for plumbers over the pond ? 
  no he did not completely, 
  ` good enough ', 
  or they all have a `` i do n't want to have a shit job '' in them . 
  there 's just no win with you unless someone 's an astronaut first to set foot on mars . 
  nope , i 'm calm alright without it . 
  i like the one fetching a ride on top . 
  i ca n't fathom how was he still conscious after all he 's been subjected to . 
  that channel you pinned seems quite interesting , thanks for the heads up !,

  got ta have * some * bad habit, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ besides ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ obvious, 
  we 're talking ~ ~ about ~ ~ not quite the middle ages here . 
  people were nuts back then . 
  i like how y' all just sit idly as he whores your country out to those ` dirty commies ' . 
  it 's hilarious . 
  good thing is once they get too big you can just eat them, 
   i no longer get instant queues as tank during prime time, 
  that 's all that needs to be said . 
  i 'd assume being a pussy rider is better than being a crippled/dead one . 
  getting hyped about this is clearly me not understanding the limits of my hardtail .

  can you show central/eastern europe ? 
  i think poland got a lot of undeserved credit there lol, 
  and how long does it take you to get to work ? 
  in budapest ( hungarian capital ) it took me almost an hour with 2 trams just to get to the uni on the other side of the city . 
   paraguay lost a bunch of clay, 
  from my 10 min skim of south american history , did n't they take most of that lost land back in the 1930s ?

  yeah , depends on how you achieve that though . 
  i ca n't hold a manual yet , i can lift the front wheel up ( or even over and fall/jump off the back of the bike ) but i have n't gotten comfortable with pulling back enough , only sometimes do i manage to commit fully to the movement necessary . 
  i actually want to learn the wheelie so i can find and be comfortable with that balance point . 
  yep , just recently got me a 50mm shorter seatpost ( the bizango 's ca n't drop all the way down ) and a 40mm stem just for this very reason . 
   as you pedal you have to shift your hips back behind the seat, 
  how do you do that sitting down ? 
  also , do i pump the front suspension then pull or just pull ? 
  afraid i might learn the incorrect technique if i push in and try to bounce off the front sus . 
  that seems like a neat site , thanks for sharing !, 
  yeah i can see how these skills can be super useful moving forward to trail skills . 
  will go out in a bit to practice trackstand . 
  thanks !, 
  all trials skills seem super fun and relatively low energy ( i assume ) , if so it could be nice practicing on ` rest days ' . 
  alright i went out to trackstand for what i thought would be 20-30 mins , thinking i was near 30ish i checked and i was actually out for 50 mins then !, 
  it 's super fun . 
  yeah i feel it in my arms and back , it certainly works you !, 
  at first i could barely stay put , after 80ish mins i was able to hold for several seconds . 
  was sweet !, 
  wow that 's a good writeup , thanks !, 
  it 's unusual geometry for the bizango , it 's the new 16 '' frame that looks like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zuz4lvd.jpg ) . 
  yup already subbed to phil and seth and gmbn , trying to stitch something together ...  lots of great input on the post as well . 
  [ vaguely relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miaorkns1dk ), 
  it was a flat car park with a slight ramp , oddly enough i felt more comfortable standing on flat than on the incline ? 
  i found that when i pulled both brakes and pushed into the frontal foot 's pedal i could stand way longer . 
  it drains my battery though . 
  that 's curious , how come ? 
  [ this guy 's super fast ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucbpn_pdx1jrt5bkuwjbaaiq ), 
  for a second i thought you replied to op there ... 
  why was there a fire ? 
  i miss being afraid of ai , like i was in iii and iv . 
  i played bf1942 then vietnam with bots . 
  check your local laws first , 
  that 's the spirit, 
  so you 're really the middle east of the west in this sense , are n't you ? 
  hm , i installed a chainstay protector that touches ( just barely ) the rear cable that leads to the derailleur . 
  could it be the problem ? 
  e : took it off and went for a bit of practice , clicking/sloppy shifting persists : /,

  i 'm glad i quit a bit after apotheosys left . 
  no time wasted on a dying game . 
  `` i want you all to call me loretta '', 
  that or `` how many upvotes can x get '' / `` lets make this random shit the top post of all time '' . 
  it 's utter garbage now , only the smaller subs are decent . 
  i should read that book . 
  he 's the head of a world religion ... his words influence billions of people . 
  of course it matters . 
  alright so if only a third of the 2.4 billion cared that 's still about * a lot * . 
  the point stands . 
  also he does n't just say `` i do n't have an opinion '' , it 's a clear `` wait and see '' attitude that goes against 99 % of all public/media reactions recently .

  this will be the scariest/saddest meme if it becomes one .

  were they arranged in [ diamond shape ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4kapppc.png ) ? 
  yeah the middle one was confusing me there . 
   also pivot your hips towards the exit of the turn imagine you are pointing your belly button towards the exit . 
  i tried that before and ended up with [ this position ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rqswdby.png ) coming out of a turn . 
  was it wrong ? 
  so i 'm thinking , for a right turn :,
