  i happen to give exactly one fuck . 
  i got it , thanks !, 
  totally worth the downvotes . 
  a colour manager without colour management ? 
  how ironic !, 
  it confused the hell out of me too , especially the way he was directly comparing megawatts ( power ) to megawatt hours ( energy ) , then moving from $ / mwh to cents / kwh ... 
  why wo n't he make a table ? 
  or draw a chart ? 
  yet when you plan a walking or biking route , you do n't get to see the height profile, 
  [ just tell them everything !, 
  how about no pull to refresh , and no refresh button either , but * realtime * sync instead ? 
  i 'm a noob , so i have no idea about implementation , but it is a much better user experience . 
  you 're right , in cases with complex nonlinear structures such as reddit comments and posts my idea is inconvinient . 
  i just feel , that very often apps require manual refreshing where real-time updating would be more pleasing . 
  they have the elevation data for the whole globe ( aster or srtm ) . 
  what version ? 
  could n't find a place where it does n't work . 
  it even works on goddamn antarctica !, 
  [ if you ever wondered ] ( http://imgur.com/twq0l ), 
  this is the google maps android app, 
  go cheaper on components ( you 'll get exactly zero use out of a beefy gpu , neither do you need a top-tier cpu ) , [ silence that beast ] ( http://www.silentpcreview.com/ ) , and put the money you saved into speakers and room treatment !, 
  * where is the ssd ? 
  i ca n't see the ssd !, 
  google tells me that the str-dh1000 is a stereo amp . 
  what is going on here ? 
  what are those two speakers doing in the back ? 
  a little info please !, 
  what do the cards actually do ? 
  do they a ) transmit a static block of data , or b ) are they more like smart cards , with asymmetric encryption etc ? 
  maybe both ? 
  some people need to learn the hard way . 
  in general , * everything * that 's on one 's hard drive that 's not also somewhere else can be considered volatile , and that data * will be lost * one day .

  ramps remove the floor along with the wall below . 
  then clear away any remaining ramps at the sides . 
  nope , it does n't have an horn, 
  i butchered some corpses and it was okay, 
  you were right , they 're okay now , thanks !, 
  you do n't really care if you bought a tegra phone, 
  as someone who fixed his nexus one by soldering 0.1 mm enameled wire onto 0.25 mm pcb pads , i could n't agree more . 
  off-line , platform independent , and also makes you look a little less like a douchebag . 
  - * let 's change numbers brah !, 
  - * yo , let 's do it by fistbumping with our phones dude !, 
  - * that makes me wan na make sweet steamy bro-love to you brah !, 
  oh god yes !, 
  that could 've been even trickier . 
  i ran a pair of wires from the power switch to one of the flat connectors on the bottom of the board bypassing the flex cable that holds the power switch . 
  there are many other ways of maintaining online privacy . 
  and no , vpn 's wo n't be banned . 
  what ? 
  that 's funny , cause there is no actual way of telling the difference between openvpn traffic and https traffic . 
  or did they ban that too ? 
  you downloaded their client ? 
  i 'd suggest a hasty reinstallation of your system . 
  hope that you did n't have any cc info stored on your drive , and that you have n't entered any passwords . 
  nd filters are the new hdr, 
  short of entering your login information for every other query , what alternatives are there to cookies for session tracking that you 'd find acceptable ? 
  absolutely nothing stopping ya . 
  it has both s/pdif and a minihdmi outputs for audio, 
  you select the wire gauge for speaker impedance , not power . 
  actually , you 're right . 
  what i was thinking about was the wire resistance influencing the speaker 's electrical damping , but i misestimated its order of magnitude . 
  shame on me . 
  harden the fuck up chris !, 
  also , svg for vector graphics is small and well supported in modern browsers , even mobile . 
  ( off topic since this is photoshop thread , i know ), 
  i really fucked up by buying this on desura . 
  please , can anyone send me the install file ? 
  i can verify that i paid for the game !, 
  edit : update up on desura !, 
  yay !, 
  no more regrets !, 
  you get better efficiency if you first syphon the fuel out of two opposing stacks and drop them first instead of dropping 6 stacks at the same time, 
  oh my god , what happend to his left hand ? 
  is there any resampling going on , or does the wolfson chip operate natively at 44100hz ? 
  ( on the sgs2 , since android mixes everything at 44100hz and the yamaha chip is working on 48khz , everything is resampled from 44100hz to 48khz . 
  48khz files will first be resampled to 44100hz , then back to 48khz ),

  put the * general note * into the beginning of your post before some dimwit ** tl ; dr ** 's it !, 
  a philips screwdriver that fits is likely not the philips screwdriver you should be using !, 
  adreno 200 in 2012 is not welcome . 
  that chip wo n't even be able to run the ics ui smoothly . 
  actually that 's regular dynamics with local contrast enhancements and the sharpness increased . 
  if you reduce bit depth , you * always * dither first . 
  this guy did n't , so the 8-bit samples are very distorted . 
  how come nobody mentioned noise floor in this entire thread ? 
  because it comes down to this :, 
  * bit depth [ bits/sample ] determines the noise floor of the signal , since in absence of that noise the signal would be severely distorted . 
  ( noise floor \u2265 0.5 lsb ), 
  * sample rate [ sample/second ] determines the frequency range that can be accurately represented , the highest frequency being the nyquist frequency , which is * sample rate/2 *, 
  multiply the two ; you get a dimension of, 
  [ bits/sample ] * [ sample/second ] = [ bits/second ], 
  which is the bitrate of a stream . 
  added mindfuck : you can reduce the bit depth to as low as 1 bits , and keep the same dynamic range by increasing the sample rate .
