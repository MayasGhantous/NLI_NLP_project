  it it sounds like a convoluted security-through-obscurity scheme to me . 
  not in a straightforward way . 
  you can use virtual audio cable to route from chrome to reaper , or any other plugin host , and use a vst plugin there . 
  turn on colour management in picasa, 
  good . 
  now explain exotic usb cables ( that do n't transfer the dac word clock , only the data ), 
  the save game editor that exists can change the gamesave to peaceful . 
  maybe that 'll make the mobs disappear , or give you time to clear some up before turning it back . 
  make a backup . 
  that pastorius riff by victor wooten gives me the chills every time . 
  such a humble homage !, 
  this particular individual was caught . 
  you should still exercise caution while travelling on the budapest metros , or any other eastern european public transport vehicle for that matter . 
  be aware of your surroundings . 
  do n't be shy to put away your expensive mobile computing devices when you happen to be in close proximity to gypsies . 
  be proactive , and install tracking apps like prey , cerberus , or avast antitheft on your android devices . 
  levels , levels , levels !, 
  great suggestion from skinnymac , keep an eye on your tape recorder 's level meter . 
  recent digital stuff will be mastered so that the output will be pegged at the maximum level , therefore i 'd suggest lowering the gain , so it does n't go above 0db , maybe even lower . 
  if it 's jazz , classical , or a record released before 2000 , the +3 db mark is a good target and will give you a good snr . 
  if you 're combining music from different eras you 'll have to match their levels as well , either yourself , by ear , or by using a playback program that supports replaygain , like foobar2000 . 
  yes . 
  he is . 
  i have n't done a timelapse video because i do n't yet have an intervalometer , but this is how i plan my foss processing workflow :, 
  * ( optional ) use [ hugin ] ( http://hugin.sourceforge.net/ ) to correct the exposure values of the images in order to eliminate flicker , and optionally use hugin 's enfuse with exposure brackets . 
  this same step could be used to correct for any movement that might have happened . 
  * use either [ * ffmpeg * ] ( http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html ) or [ * mencoder * ] ( http://linux.die.net/man/1/mencoder ) to convert the jpg series to simple video clips, 
  * [ kdenlive ] ( http://www.kdenlive.org/ ) to combine the videos , maybe some panning , and [ music ] ( http://freemusicarchive.org/ ), 
  no sites like that exist . 
  bittorrent is peer to peer . 
  if you 're lazy like me , you could run this in your terminal ( for 64 bit ubuntu ) :, 
  wget - o - `` http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/pdc/11.2.202.270/install_flash_player_11_linux.x86_64.tar.gz '' | tar xz - c ~ / . local/share/steam / ubuntu12_32 / plugins / libflashplayer.so, 
  edit : improved library path , thanks arrowmaster, 
  yes . 
  sorry about that . 
  why would it ? 
  that 's a completely valid expression . 
  so do you control a vsti with this app , or do you use a vsti to control this app ? 
  or are they separate ? 
  i bet this line only means that the camera can shoot adobergb , or an even larger colorspace . 
  `` triluminous '' is the same as rgb led backlit , innit ? 
  the lens can go down to 4.1 mm , and the sensor is 6.16 mm wide , meaning that the camera has a horizontal fov of 2atan ( 6.16 / 8.2 ) = 74 \u00b0 . 
  on a 35mm camera a 23mm lens would have a comparable fov . 
  according to wikipedia ,, 
   also by custom , a lens of focal length 35 mm or less is considered wide-angle . 
  dear god what have i done !, 
  recently more and more vinyl records have been pressed from shitty cd masters ( ac/dc , foo fighters come to my mind ) . 
  so even the argument that the mastering is different is invalid . 
  if you already have vnc set up on your pc , then [ valence ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cafbit.valence ) . 
  no need for shoddy servers to be installed on your computer , you can use industry standard programs to connect to ( e. g. ultravnc ), 
  go outside during a clear day . 
  where are the stars ? 
  nope , there 's pgp which will turn the message into a homogenous mush until you decrypt it on your computer . 
  browsers render with subpixel rendering because they present the text to a final device ( a monitor with rgb subpixel triplets ), 
  photoshop offers no subpixel rendering , because the result could appear on many types of displays ( rgb , bgr , pentile , or even vertical rgb or bgr with phones and tablets ) , or print . 
  here 's a trick : resize the page to three times the horizontal target resolution ( e.g. 
  for a 1000px \\* 1000px page , scale it to 3000px \\* 1000px ) , and rasterize the vector layers ( text and graphics ) . 
  now select red from the chanels , and nudge it one pixel to the left , then select blue and nudge it one pixel to the right . 
  resize it to the target resolution ( do not constrain proportions ) * using nearest neighbour interpolation * . 
  you just rgb subpixel rendered your webpage design . 
   personally i do n't like vpns i do n't see why you should pay somebody to access illegal content rather than pay the original author, 
  [ if only you had the choice ] ( http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones ), 
  maybe the cpu governor is set to * performance * when plugged in ( which basically pegs the cpu frequency to max ) . 
  set it to * ondemand * instead . 
  i have cpufreq-utils installed on my desktop pc , which tells me what the cpu is up to . 
  if you also have it , cpufreq-info will show you the current frequency governor and the frequency statistics . 
  it opens a terminal within dolphin in the directory where you are . 
  when changing directories , it 'll cd inside the terminal too . 
  nope , because phones and tablets auto rotate , an usually do n't show images at 100 % . 
  an rgb rendered image looks bad on a bgr screen . 
  reminds me of the [ imperial trader ] ( http://www.jades.org/shiprevs/imptrad.htm ) from frontier : first encounters, 
  [ characteristic impedance ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ ) = / = measured cable impedance, 
  they 're thick enough , so they 'll be just as good as any other wire , but cat5 is n't braided , so it will be a lot more rigid . 
  keep that in mind . 
  cat5 cables have 0.2 mm ^ 2 solid core wires which are more rigid than headphone wires with the equivalent gauge that normally have dozens of braided strands . 
  eq 's are minimum phase , but rooms are n't . 
  i have [ kfaenza ] ( http://kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=143890 ) . 
  it 's easier on the eyes than the gloss of the oxygen theme . 
  that , and [ atelier ] ( http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/atelier?content=99440 ) as the desktop theme ( still using oxygen for window decorations ) , so there are n't any transparent bars . 
  why not ask us for the . apk ? 
  and marketenabler used to be able to spoof your imsi so you 'd appear to be from a different country as far as the play store is concerned . 
  i have n't used it for years though . 
  first it reduces the q of the pickup and reduces the cutoff frequency ( traditional guitar pickups being passive lowpass filters and the tone knob is a serial rc load ) . 
  once you reach the end , q rises again at a lower frequency . 
  if you were to vary capacitance across the pickup , you 'd see only little change in q , and the cutoff frequency would drop as capacitance increases ( similar to what happens with more wire on the pickup - except you ca n't change the wire length ) . 
  you should go with a pa speaker that has a wide dispersion / cd horn . 
  most box speakers will beam the highs , being more directional as frequency increases . 
  this will make them sound like boxes instead of real instruments . 
  any ppa 's out of the ordinary ? 
  you can use a symlink/hard link instead of a . lnk file . 
  [ all you need to know ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ntfs_symbolic_link ), 
  get the excellent rpn interface here : http://perez-franco.com/symbulator/download/rpn.html, 
  turns the ti89 into the best calculator ever to have existed . 
  dear god why ? 
  send him an email , he probably set some switch the wrong way . 
  if you 're an rpn fan , get the [ rpn interface ] ( http://perez-franco.com/symbulator/download/rpn.html ) made by lars frederiksen . 
  you 'll have the speed of an hp calculator with the sophisticated cas of the ti . 
  best of both worlds . 
  edit : only works with the ti89 and ti92 + , not the ti89ti !, 
  you can install the openvpn client on an [ openwrt ] ( https://openwrt.org/ ) router ( [ here 's a guide ] ( http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.client.openvpn.tun ) ) .
