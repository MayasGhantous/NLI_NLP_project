  these hacky clients are scary . 
  maybe propelling the gas onto a transfer orbit towards mars could work . 
  then the gas would neatly join the mars atmosphere as soon as it gets there . 
  makes as much sense as landing a rover with a skycrane . 
  as a sound pro , i 'd like to point out that a `` micro-db '' ( why not ub , or microbel ) would be used to measure a miniscule * difference * in levels . 
  if you wanted to exaggerate on how inaudible something is , you could use a negative dba , or the equally entertaining * femtopascal * , because 1 femtopascal is approximately -206 dbspl . 
  not contrast , but sharpness , and the fact that most tv 's only support up to 4:2:2 chroma subsampling ( color has half the resolution as luminance ) , even over hdmi . 
  you 'll hate your hdtv every time you 're not watching movies on it . 
  x86 cpu 's are no longer made ( at least ones that you 'd put in a pc anyway ) , so unless sou buy a pentium 3 , your cpu will be x86_64 . 
  a 64bit os will allow you to have more than 4gib of memory . 
  some operations are also faster on 64bit processors when the binary is natively compiled , but the difference in performance is unnoticable in most cases . 
  choose one of these that satisfy your expectations ( usb port , wireless class , wired ports , speed ), 
  a custom firmware is entirely optional , but a linux-based router will never let you down . 
  or , either meter , second , or kilogram could mean a totally different thing in sk - the kerbal system of units . 
  the gravitational constant could be off too . 
  harden the fuck up !,

  it 's easier if you start a console window wherever you want to push / pull files from . 
  deselect everything , shift-rightclick , and open console right there .

  if the stereo track was encoded with this in mind , you 'll be able to get the surround channels with a, 
  dolby prologic decoder . 
  ffmpeg can do it if you want it to . 
  on windows , you can use the ffdshow codec with mpchc and enable the prologic decoder . 
  if it is a stereo source intended to be played on stereo speakers , you should play it on the front speakers . 
  stereo contains sound that should be in front of you . 
  you should n't play it on speakers that are behind you . 
  so basketball is also a type of football , right ? 
  line up three cameras and shoot them at the same time . 
  put it into a google image search or tineye , maybe you can find a version that was n't compressed so aggressively . 
  canon cameras with chdk can be synced through usb with millisecond precision, 
  are there wireless controllers that work in 802.11 n without issues ?

  nothing should ever touch the gamma ramp . 
  it 's there so that the correct monitor calibration curves can be loaded . 
  game devs only touch it because they have no clue about what they are doing , and those ` features ' deserve to be broken . 
  is there anything that could rattle in the vicinity ? 
  or even inside ? 
  could be port noise too, 
  you could be clipping the eq . 
  bring it back to flat , and increase the volume to match the level where the rattling happened . 
  if it went away , then rejoice . 
  tip : if it goes away if you block the port , then it 's not the eq , but over-excursion of the woofer . 
  you have a * lot * more excursion at lower frequencies , especially below the port resonance . 
  you could be over excursing the speaker even if there is less than the rated power if there are some subsonic frequencies present . 
  [ here 's an example of excursion vs frequency of a vented and a sealed box . 
  ] ( http://www.silcom.com/~aludwig/sysdes/enclosure_excursion.gif ) the dip is at the port resonance frequency . 
  get [ orbot ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android ) , reach an american exit node , and spend your funds . 
  or just use a proxy or a vpn . 
  play wo n't use the tor proxy unless you 're rooted . 
  you could try buying it on your pc actually . 
  you could try that if you really want to delay rooting your tablet . 
  what you are saying is true for conventional pan-potted stereo , and audio recorded with stereo microphone techniques . 
  multichannel surround sound * can * be encoded into a stereo stream using a prologic encoder , after which a decoder will reproduce the original multi-channel audio with little crosstalk . 
  when stereo is prologic encoded , it is usually labeled so . 
  the decoder running over a conventional stereo track has questionable benefits of course . 
  most lossy formats do n't have an internal equivalent of bit depth , the dynamic range changes according to the material . 
  i suppose that it should be easier to lossy encode 24bit audio because of the lower noise floor and the lack of noise shaping .
