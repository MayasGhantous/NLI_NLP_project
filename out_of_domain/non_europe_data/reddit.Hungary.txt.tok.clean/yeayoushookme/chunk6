  agreed . 
  completely forgot about xp . 
  there 's a good reason to use asio with windows xp , even it is a bolted-on asio4all package . 
  you 're confusing the axefx with the muse receptor . 
  the axe fx is an embedded device with a dsp doing the work . 
  it is n't a pc . 
  with software , whose task is loading patches and reading the button input . 
  if it 's a computer , then so are graphing calculators . 
  i know . 
  i have a ti89 , which has a 68k cpu . 
  it still is n't a pc . 
  the amiga , however , was . 
  i see a bright future for this kid . 
  he might grow up and start practicing law someday, 
  krokodil is a helluva drug, 
  you dropped it right into the power amp , the worst place - after the power source - for a coin to be dropped into . 
  you may have blown a channel or two , and i 'm sure it blew at least one fuse . 
  the output devices may need replacement . 
  it 'd be safer to replace the whole board . 
  do not connect a shitty speaker to it . 
  doing so could cause further damage to the receiver . 
  check the dc offset of the speaker outputs first with a voltage meter . 
  however good this advice is ( i personally agree ) the lady also has her say in this . 
  i 've observed , that movie dynamics make my girlfriend anxious . 
  loud parts make her stressed , so i just turn on the compressor in ffmpeg ( tyl : there is a volume control signal stream built into dts and later technologies ), 
  now , the strange thing is , that this does n't happen in movie theaters . 
  she does n't react the same way to  100dbspl sounds . 
  i 'd like to know the psychology behind this . 
  [ also , a funny related comic ] ( http://www.mrlovenstein.com/comic/87 ), 
  it is n't racist , i mean look , they let a black woman in the theater !, 
  dynaudio kit from the 80 's in a rather large cabinet made by my dad , and generic surround speakers ( genius front from those 5.1 setups ) . 
  well suited to voip , video chats , online radio and video streams etc. 
  not sure what 's this post doing in / r/audiophile, 
  aww , you shouldnt have !, 
  do you need separate zones ? 
  if so , a network based distribution could be your solution with a number of upnp/dlna/airplay capable receivers and mobile devices as remotes/sources . 
  a media server coud be placed on a nas that would contain your music library . 
  if you want to control the music from a single point , i suggest you look into 25/70/100 volt loudspeaker systems , otherwise long cable runs will lead to signal loss and degradation , or alternatively , huge expenses because of thick speaker wires . 
  if cable lengths are n't so long , you could probably use regular speakers . 
  use a wire gauge calculator to get an estimate on expenses . 
  you could in theory run signal cables to active speakers , but i wouldnt recommend that . 
  first , you 'd have to go all balanced , increasing the price , otherwise you 'd get some monstrous ground loops . 
  second , every problem this setup would have is addressed by the 100v system . 
  except that it cost a lot more than that , and you pay for it in your inflated wireless bill . 
  also , iphone 4 , worth much more than 180 $, 
  use the b&w with the stereo amp , and consider ditching the center channel speaker until you find a better one , unless they sound similar enough . 
  the ex-fronts are now your surround-side speakers . 
  enjoy your new 7.1 setup . 
  acoustic treatment . 
  every piece in your gear is absolutely decent , and upgrading any of them will not likely make any significant ( audible ) improvements . 
  the next logical step would be to start chipping away at the negative effects your room might have on the sound . 
  start by reading [ this article ] ( http://www.ethanwiner.com/acoustics.html ) . 
  it explains in detail how reflections can influence the sound , and what you can do about it . 
  dat plaid, 
  it 's a typo . 
  it should be 128 ** kbit/s ** and 24bit-96k ** hz ** . 
  mp3 at 128kb/s will consume almost exactly 1mib ( 2 ^ 20 bytes ) every minute , and is suitable only for instruments with little sibilance ( guitar ) , or speech . 
  pcm at 96khz will store every signal that comes off the mic up to 48khz , so you 'll have one part audio , and one part ultrasound in the file ( you only hear sounds up to about 18-20khz ) . 
  24 bit means that it will have a low noise floor , or a lot of headroom ( in contrast to 16bit-96khz ) . 
  it will consume 33mib every minute . 
  basically , 128kbit/s . mp3 is a mediocre recording file format , while recording a pcm . wav at 24b-96khz is a no-compromise approach to quality, 
  why would i give any fucks about the fahrenheit scale ? 
  what 's the md5sum of the windows . zip ? 
  i get disconnects every minute , and i want to be sure it 's correct . 
  *** nsfw !!, 
  * challenge accepted !, 
  this . 
  it 's pretty standard stuff . 
  with rca outputs you 'd have trouble connecting headphones . 
  digital : pcm, 
  it does n't ? 
  or are you talking of a specific amp ? 
  there go my hopes of ever sleeping again . 
   why does *** an *** overdrive not work well, 
  i think thebikerelement is talking about using an overdrive pedal with an ss amp , not overdriving an ss amp . 
  if you use a pedal , the clipping is done by the pedal , while the amp is in its linear range . 
  in that case both solid state and tube amps act as eq 's only , and the difference is because of different filter / rolloff characteristics . 
  i think he 's talking about a specific amp ( combo ) having a shitty od tone . 
  how strange , that this link is purple , yet i have no recollection of this story . 
  my mind must 've erased it from my memory . 
  i would n't call that a poor setup . 
  make sure that you connect the preamp to the line input on the sound card , * not * the mic input . 
  also , use a mono connector between the sound card and the preamp , because the audiobuddy has two balanced outputs , while the creative card has stereo input . 
  balanced and stereo can use the same type of connectors ( trs ) , that 's why there could be a problem . 
  * or * , you could make use of that balanced output by using a tip/ring/sleeve jack and a twisted , shielded cable ( mic cable , not stereo interconnect ) , and then you 'd subtract the two `` stereo '' channels in software , thereby converting your sound card 's line in into a balanced input ( add two channels on your multitrack recorder , one for the left , one for the right input , and invert one of them ) . 
  you 'd get some added snr , and twice the level . 
  if you wonder why , google balanced signaling . 
  also , levels . 
  keep in mind that the preamp could overdrive the adc , which will sound ugly . 
  keep your levels accordingly . 
  if there 's a software toggle for input recording level for the sound card in the control panel , set it to 100 % , or 0db . 
  relax , he 's just trolling . 
  keep your heatsinks clean man , lack of airflow could harm your hardware . 
  the problem : you have two adc 's , each with their own clocks . 
  your software would need to resample the signal from one of the devices to match the other , and recording programs do n't do this . 
  * what you 're trying to achieve is n't possible without somehow slaving one converter to the other 's clock * *** in hardware ***, 
  use two instances of a multitrack program , maybe linked with midi , and do n't record long passes . 
  also , you ca n't record the same sound source with the two converters at the same time , because of the changing phase shift between the two . 
  power hungry = inefficient . 
  just sayin,
