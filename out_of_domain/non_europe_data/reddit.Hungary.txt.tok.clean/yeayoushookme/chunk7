  well , stating that as a benefit is quite misleading , innit ? 
  i 'd be concerned if a speaker would only operate at a reasonable loudness when driven by 150 watts . 
  that would imply a sensitivity of around 78dbspl/w/m , which is absimal for a speaker of such dimensions . 
  so you need 15 watts to drive them to 100dbspl at 1 meter . 
  that 's about as loud as a jackhammer . 
   every meter decreases output by 3db, 
  because of the inverse square law of sound , with a point source , every time you * double the distance * from the source , the level will be reduced by 6db ( with a line source it 's 3db each time distance is doubled ) . 
  so if at 1m it 's 0db , then 2m will be -6 db , 4m will be -12 db , 8m will be -18 db and so on . 
  * / in other words , every time you increase the distance by * *** x *** * decibels , the sound pressure will be reduced by * *** x *** * decibels / *, 
  a jackhammer produces 100dbspl at one meter . 
  these speakers produce 100dbspl at one meter when driven by 15 watts . 
  they share the same loudness at 30cm , 1m , 5m and at every other possible distance . 
  at 10 meters , both will be 80dbspl . 
  every answer except yours is incorrect . 
  good wording , you deserve a pat on the back . 
  you can get more clean output from a speaker if you do n't stress it by excursing it with sounds below the cutoff frequency . 
  the sub will also provide some nice , clean , undistorted bass , whereas a bookshelf speaker will produce audible port noise and distortion at much lower levels . 
  i think you should set it to small . 
  i dont believe this to be true . 
  a surround receiver * should * send the lowpassed sum of the five channels , along with the lfe channel to the sub . 
  ca n't back my words up at the moment , but i promise i 'll test how my ht receiver handles bass . 
  sorry , i must have misread your original post , thought you were saying the opposite . 
  there must be * some * kind of input on the sub , right ? 
  that 's two rca inputs right there at the bottom . 
  the two inputs are summed , therefore you can use whichever you like . 
  hope they brought some snacks for the journey :d, 
   bit stale if you like warm tones from what i hear, 
  can be fixed by putting two 47nf capacitors across its outputs . 
  there would be no need for this if the apps would start supporting the standard android controller input scheme . 
  the windows desktop is unmanaged , as the raw pixel values are going out to the display . 
  * assign * your monitor 's profile to the image , and that should fix it . 
  if you want a tagged image to be shown correctly on your desktop , convert it to your monitor 's profile first . 
  listening tests prove otherwise . 
  basically skia farting out because of broken graphics drivers . 
  it will keep happening until you get an update with fixed drivers . 
  wasting light has a peak-to-rms ratio of 5db . 
  you ca n't get that kind of overcompression from analog gear . 
  well , nothing you can release , at least . 
  unless you 're metallica . 
  why do n't you disable/freeze it ? 
  and by the way , you can put a script in / system/addon . d / that will do stuff for you , like delete rommanager , or backup your apps in / system / , like the anti-theft apps that get deleted at updates . 
  the update script baked into the . zip 's already clears them, 
  the scripts stick until you do a manual / system / wipe , so it does n't matter when you copy it . 
  you could copy it using adb in android , or adb in recovery ( do n't forget to mount / system ) , or you can use total commander inside android as well , it does n't matter . 
  it does need execute permissions to run , so run chmod + x script.sh after copying . 
  the gapps package installs a script that you can use as an example , so you can see what 's going on . 
  that script is what keeps gapps from being wiped when you upgrade . 
  yes . 
  i 'd rather have a 15 '' 720p laptop screen with some contrast , than what 's available now but with higher resolution ( right now laptop screens have contrast ratios of around 70 to 100 . 
  a normal screen should have at least 500 . 
  above 1000 is excellent ), 
  yes , you can do it inside clockwork recovery . 
  there 's an option for wiping / system / inside mounts . 
  this will thoroughly remove android from your phone with every system app included , so your phone will be ready for a fresh start ( including a new android-id ), 
  a word of caution : do n't try to flash a recovery image after wiping the / system , because if you fail , you 'll be left without a place to boot to , and your device will become an expensive paperweight until you find a way to jtag the device , which is a nasty process probably involving soldering 0.1 mm wire onto your phone 's pcb . 
  in a normal scenario , if flashing the recovery fails , you can always try again from inside android . 
  [ any bass problems ? 
  ] ( http://www.acousticfrontiers.com/speaker-boundary-interference.html ), 
  sell the mac and install macos in vmware, 
  computers have built-in analog mixers since ac ' 97 . 
  as long as a machine is on , you can use it as a mixer by connecting the output from pc1 to the line input of pc2 . 
  you just have to toggle the line-in , so that it gets passed to the output . 
  then use the front-panel audio for headphones , and the back panel output for the speakers . 
  to switch between the two , pull out or plug in the headphones . 
  you do need short cables for this , and the two machines would need to be connected to the same power plug , otherwise you 'd get interference from the ground loops . 
  as an additional bonus , you get analog level control from your mixer pc over the other machine . 
  cool , huh ? 
  no way . 
  that would be bad a bad approach . 
  the latest version of foobar2k has playback and encoding support for the opus audio codec . 
  give it a test . 
  the fun thig is that i can detect the difference at ~ 80kb/s , but it does n't sound nearly as objectionable as mp3 at 128kb/s, 
  probably , because most dedicated audio interfaces have power supply filtering , and many are decoupled from the usb port . 
  however , check the things that are connected to your pc . 
  power cables to every device should be connected to the same connector to minimise interference from ground loops , and audio cable runs should also be as short as possible , without any loops in them . 
  also check in the audio device settings if any input is set to `` listen '' mode . 
  cultprits are cd input header , and line in . 
  if there 's nothing connected to them , they act like antennas and mix emi into your output . 
  i 'm saying this because i have a motherboard that happens to have a really quiet dac . 
  there are many other sources of noise . 
  [ this article tells you about the effects of pickup geometry and position ] ( http://www.till.com/articles/pickupresponse/ ), 
  [ this article is about the elctrical characteristics of a traditional high-impedance guitar pickup ] ( http://buildyourguitar.com/resources/lemme/ ), 
  the cumulative transfer curve will determine how any pickup sounds . 
  we 're talking about two physical parameters ( position and width ) and two electrical parameters ( resonant frequency and * q * factor - these can be lowered by external loads : wire capacitance reduces the resonant frequency , lower impedence potmeters and amp inputs mainly reduce q ), 
  edit : other than these there 's susceptibility for picking up noise , and microphonics in rare cases . 
  enjoy reading !, 
  the audience wo n't hear how bad you sound when they 're * bleeding out of their ears !, 
  i like scidavis a lot . 
  easy to use and draws pretty ( antialiased ) graphs . 
  its layout and operation is similar to origin . 
  srv used .14 strings tuned a half note down . 
  technically , that 's like using .132 strings with a standard tuning ( 648mm scale , 126n tension ), 
  as a reference , on a strat a .1 e string will have a tension of 72n , so the difference is huge even between .1 and .13 strings . 
  digital mixing is addition . 
  a + b = c. nothing more , nothing less . 
  with analog mixers , you first have a preamp ( which adds supposedly beneficial nonliniar distortion ** sbnd ** - mainly harmonic distortion products for solo tracks ) , then resistors sum many signals ( a+b = c + noise ) , and then that goes through an amp that provides feedback over the summing resistor and sbnd ( mainly intermodulation products in this case ) . 
  and there will also be an additional da/ad stage .
