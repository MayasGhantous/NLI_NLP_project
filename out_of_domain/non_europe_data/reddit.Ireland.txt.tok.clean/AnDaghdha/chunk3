  the fuck . 
  you 're the same nigma . 
  i never linked the two . 
  they 're new zealanders . 
  probably do n't give a fuck about american football . 
  it 's ` county kerry ' , op . 
  just to let you know . 
   every european country, 
  ha , no . 
  not switzerland , luxembourg , andorra , monaco or independent ireland . 
  edit : and ` most parts of western europe ' is a far cry from `` every european country '' . 
  which is irrelevant . 
  he claimed that every european country was involved in the exploitation of africa , which was incorrect . 
  also the swiss army was far from small and weak . 
   lol , the swiss army * is * pretty weak, 
  yes , it * is * weak . 
  at the time of the scramble for africa , it was not . 
  edit : haha , just checked your comment history . 
  do n't even bother responding , lad . 
  you 'd be wasting my time and yours . 
  i 'm not claiming a sense of superiority . 
  please do n't put words in my mouth . 
  the only reason i originally replied was that the original comment explicitly said `` every european country '' was involved in what was done to africa , which is extremely misleading . 
  edit : also , i only just saw your edit regarding ireland . 
  the irish people were not involved in africa , even if our ruling leaders were . 
  we were being treated as badly as `` our government '' was treating the africans . 
  i 'm irish . 
  i know full well the atrocities committed by europeans and europe . 
  partly because we had 700 + years of it at the hands of the british . 
  the problem though , is the immediate jumping to `` well , europe did the same '' whenever something scathing is said about america . 
  i could easily defend america by pointing to any number of atrocities committed worldwide by entities besides the us government . 
  but that would be fruitless ( pardon the pun ) because many of those entities either do n't exist today , do n't behave in the same manner , or do n't hold as much power . 
  the us government consistently tries to overthrow foreign governments worldwide to support its interests . 
  that is where the problem lays . 
  and that is why american is so well known for being militaristic . 
  wording is important though . 
  you could say that the majority of europe was involved in the internment and extermination of jews , disabled people , jehovah 's witnesses , homosexuals , etc. , but you 'd also have to mention that this was when the third reich was in power . 
  claiming the `` entire of europe '' was involved in the scramble of africa is a sweeping statement and a lie . 
  that 's better , but beside the point really . 
  and i would n't go so far as to say ireland profited from imperialism . 
  the british elite in ireland maybe . 
  but the irish ` benefited ' by having a more powerful enemy to fight . 
  you could say `` everyone in america has enough to eat '' . 
  but by saying `` the only exceptions being those who ca n't afford it '' , you do n't make the first statement any less of a lie . 
  we lost 25 % of our population due to starvation and immigration during the so-called famine . 
  not from lack of food . 
  we had plenty of food . 
  but it being under armed guard on ships to great britain was n't much use to us . 
  the fact that the failure of one crop affected the native population so much in the first place might tell you a bit about the condition we lived in . 
  we produced more than enough grain to feed the population but to give this away for food when it was a cash crop would take money out of the pockets of the upper class . 
  our population [ still has n't recovered ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/population_of_ireland_and_europe_1750_to_2005.svg ) . 
  this is one incident ( although a large one ) during british imperialism . 
  i would argue that it did n't help us at all . 
  ireland is a lot better than most african and asian colonies now , sure , but i would credit that to our location and the eu . 
  early 20th century ireland was no better off than other former colonies . 
  i do n't think the us government is supposed to help the world , but that does n't mean that i ca n't find their actions despicable and hold them in contempt . 
  i know full well it was hyperbole . 
  and you know full well there 's a difference between hyperbole for the sake of a point and straight up misleading information . 
  the answer is some of the largest western european powers at the time of the scramble for africa . 
  most eastern european countries had no hand in africa , and most modern european countries have no connection to what was done other than the fact that an entity that did controlled their land . 
  what ? 
  same in ireland . 
  it 's fairly common throughout ireland , the uk , and australia . 
  do n't know about new zealand . 
  yeah , would love for it to lose its sexist connotations in america . 
  it 's a great word . 
  he plays sk a lot i presume . 
  op must play sk a lot . 
  needforseat must have been delighted with his reaction . 
  really made me want to get one . 
  [ link for those wondering ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/3bwgjf/riama_set_to_private_over_mod_firing/csqg24d?context=3 ) . 
  cool . 
  tagged you as cartography unidan . 
  that 's both uplifting and depressing . 
  such is love , i suppose . 
  where are the other 4 cakes , op ? 
  what 's with the downvotes ? 
  does he take jokes too seriously and complain about everything there too ? 
  everybody is offended by something . 
  not everybody is able to distinguish between someone joking and someone being serious and act accordingly . 
  have you ever been to a stand-up show ? 
  edit : you actually just made a [ shitredditsays ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shitredditsays/comments/3cfkx2/father_comments_that_his_life_is_happy_now_with_a/ ) post about his comment . 
  do n't even fucking respond to me . 
  you might like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhmodt3nshs ) . 
  the relevant part being at [ 3:22 ] ( https://youtu.be/fhmodt3nshs?t=3m22s ) . 
  that 's a win for you , mate . 
  nothing 's funny when you deconstruct it and analyse the joke . 
  child molestation is n't funny . 
  his joke was ( to those who upvoted it anyway . 
  humour is subjective ) . 
  the same way people might find [ this joke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w1-gfvdyam ) funny and if you asked them `` why is the bombing of black people funny ? 
  '' , you 'd be looking at it wrong . 
  well , it 's a good thing this is reddit and not the open-mic circuit . 
  / u/spoonfair made a joke . 
  others found it funny and upvoted it . 
  ca n't that be the end of it ? 
  it 's not like we 're all calling it a classic and suggesting he become a professional comedian . 
  it was an off-hand comment . 
  i get where you 're coming from , but i think it 's irrelevant really . 
  the joke i referred to about the irish being alcoholics in that video .
