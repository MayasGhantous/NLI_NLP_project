  my dad was an alcoholic which led to the breakdown of my parent 's marriage . 
  he sought help but is now back on the drink . 
  i grew up in the midst of a messy divorce which affected me profoundly to the point of needing to go anti-depressants . 
  alcoholism has a profound affect on my life to this day through my father . 
  the thing is , i see the joke for what is is , a joke . 
  to see that comment and immediatly think that he and those that are upvoting him are suggesting that the op is molesting his daughters , or condoning child molestation is frankly stupid . 
  it 's an absurdist joke . 
  well i thought it was quite obvious that this refers to the ones that do . 
  yeah . 
  and with a quelling blade . 
  edit : oh , also , i think you can kill wards without a ranged attack by using the quelling blade . 
  i unboxed a minimal wear stattrak case hardened ak47 back when skins were just added . 
  i sold it and bought a non-stattrak version because i thought at the time that i would n't care about stattrak . 
  i did n't think anything about it because it was like my 4th unboxing . 
  i later realised how much i loved stattrak and bought another off the market . 
  oh and i 've probably spent like 200 + euros on keys and have n't gotten anything of that value since . 
   in 1 week his keyboard will be broken ... unless it is made from titanium, 
  this commenter and all those upvoting him obviously have n't played a competitive rts . 
  i agree completely . 
  what i do n't agree with is straight out saying `` that is n't a joke '' because you do n't find it funny and then building a narrative around that like the guy who posted it to / r/shitredditsays . 
  [ i 'm afraid not ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shitredditsays/comments/3cfkx2/father_comments_that_his_life_is_happy_now_with_a/ ) . 
  the name is keyart . 
  quickly delete and remake . 
  as a non-american , i always have to do a double take whenever i see obama 's first name . 
  i just think of him as obama . 
  yeah ... 
  i * switched * my schedule . 
  he 's wrong by calling you racist just because he does n't understand what culture is , [ although i would n't entirely agree with you on brazil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brazil_national_football_team ) . 
  but to answer your question , pc gaming is n't that big in japan . 
  console/arcades are far bigger . 
  from a competitive viewpoint , fighting games/speedrunning are popular . 
  but as far as i know , `` pc games '' are generally thought of as being limited to [ eroge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eroge ) in japanese popular culture . 
  how big pc gaming actually is there , i could n't tell you . 
  i was just thinking the same thing . 
  but 419 + 1 is much better than 420 imo . 
  keep it up , scoots . 
  * american fashion, 
  [ i do n't think you know what he 's implying ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/nmmjr/iama_man_who_had_a_sexual_relationship_with_his/ ) . 
  but how much drugs are you on ? 
  he does n't need to , and he does n't need to not . 
  he can do whatever the fuck he wants . 
  i never really participate in amas so i do n't know how feasible this is , but maybe a day long ama ? 
  do n't sit at the computer all day answering questions obviously , but split up the time answering questions by coming back at the end of the day and answering late-comers questions . 
  just a thought . 
  by the way , i only found yer channel today and love it . 
  i 've also shared it with a couple of friends . 
  keep up the great work !, 
  to add to what the other commenters are saying , he was banned on cevo and received a vac ban , but has n't been banned on esea yet . 
  really ? 
  i was certain you would n't know from their comments . 
  do you realise he 'd be playing against people close to his rank , so his rank would n't matter ? 
  i mean , really , this is n't a hard concept . 
  but it 's not . 
  this end game screen is on games like aoe , starcraft , dawn of war , command & conquer , and plenty of other rts games . 
  [ the guy who designed it was influenced by some of these . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/2xtkr2/new_redesigned_dota_2_final_score_screen_video/ ), 
  sweddit really is just one big meme . 
  edit : no offense meant , lads . 
  haha , but really , i love ye guys . 
  gares is always sexy though . 
  he can , though . 
  that was a joke i believe . 
  i 'm guessing he 's not a native antartican . 
  + / u/user _ simulator / u/andaghdha, 
  if you pass above the rhino enclosure going towards the bridge : the grassy part on the right with the pool is actually part of the rhino enclosure . 
  was there last week and he was inside the concrete part but the fellas said work was being done on the grass part before he 'll be left back in there . 
   gets laughed at for having really unfortunate face, 
  that 's irrelevant and juvenile of you to even mention . 
  edit : sorry , i was wrong . 
  it 's not at all infantile to ridicule someone 's looks . 
  and also completely relevant that it `` does n't help that jw is one of the two remaining players because he 's also been accused of cheating * and * has an really unfortunate face '' . 
  grow up , the lot of ye . 
  he 's not smug . 
  they 're literally different things . 
  stop being so easily offended . 
  i hate when people buy decoys on pistol round to just throw them in spawn . 
  they work so well as fake flashes . 
   pickups, 
  in america maybe . 
  nah , i meant that big cars are n't really as big of a deal elsewhere as they are in america . 
  idk , maybe it 's the cheap petrol prizes that unleash an innate liking of gas guzzlers . 
  hey , mate . 
  got a link ? 
  nyx nyx nyx ? 
  love the idea !, 
  i decided to play some day of defeat for the first time last week and came across a great voting system . 
  you vote for a map as you do in cs : go , but then the top 2 maps by vote count enter into a second run-off vote . 
  this could be improved upon more by removing the current map from the vote . 
  can i. . . can i have some money please ? 
  i promise to use it irresponsibly . 
  i unboxed a stattrak minimal wear ak case hardened on my first case . 
  have n't opened anything close to its value since . 
  obligatory fuck andy dick . 
  you can make a character be taken literally by putting a backslash before it ( escaping it ) . 
  so the end of that link would be :,

  for example :,

   worcestershire sauce is pronounced wuhster-sheer sauce, 
  ha , no problem .
