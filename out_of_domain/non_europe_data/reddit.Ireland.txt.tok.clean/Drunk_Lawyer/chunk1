[ relevant statute ] ( http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0024/sec0051.html#sec51 ), 
  ** -- ** ( 1 ) ** a person shall not , in a public place --, 
   * ( a ) * drive or attempt to drive , or be in charge of , an animal drawn vehicle , or, 
   * ( b ) * drive or attempt to drive a pedal cycle ,, 
   while he is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a drug to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle or cycle . 
   ** ( 2 ) ** a person who contravenes subsection ( 1 ) of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction , in the case of a first offence , to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds or , at the discretion of the court , to imprisonment for any term not exceeding one month or to both such fine and such imprisonment and , in the case of a second or any subsequent offence , to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds or , at the discretion of the court , to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months or to both such fine and such imprisonment . 
   ** ( 3 ) ** a person liable to be charged with an offence under this section shall not , by reference to the same occurrence , be liable to be charged under [ section 12 of the licensing act , 1872 ] ( http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1872/en/act/pub/0094/print.html ) , with the offence of being drunk while in charge , on a highway or other public place , of a carriage . 
   ** ( 4 ) ** where a member of the garda s\u00edoch\u00e1na is of opinion that a person is committing or has committed an offence under this section , he may arrest the person without warrant . 
  there is two things i find funny about this :, 
   in the case of a first offence , to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds, 
   in the case of a second or any subsequent offence , to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds, 
  that the fine for riding your cycle or animal drawn vehicle drunk is about $ 25.40 ( first ) or $ 63.50 ( subsequent ) ( if $ 1 = ir # 0.787564 ) . 
  meaning for some longer journeys , it would be cheaper to risk the fine . 
   be liable to be charged under [ section 12 of the licensing act , 1872 ] ( http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1872/en/act/pub/0094/print.html ), 
  that we have a law dating back to before we even got our independence , we could have least redid them . 
  i ca n't find that in the ira green book ( [ * link here * ] ( http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/ira/ira_green_book.htm ) ) , it might still be there , i just skimmed through it . 
  i did find a bit about [ * general order no . 
  8 * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/border_campaign_ ( irish_republican_army \\ ) #background ) , which prohibits :, 
   `` any armed action whatsoever '' against the forces of the republic of ireland . 
  which i 'm guessing was a fairly loose order , given the amount of times [ gardai ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_irish_police_officers_killed_in_the_line_of_duty ) and [ df personnel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murder_of_patrick_kelly ) have been killed by the paramilitaries . 
  not really , it 's only certain news broadcasters and certain politicians that actually use it , i am from the south and it 's always `` derry '' , and when i 'm in the north i have only heard one of them exclusively , depending on the politics of the area ( i.e nationalist areas say derry , unionist areas say londonderry ), 
  the only reason you might use the name `` derry/londonderry '' would be if you were at some sort of event promoting cross-border reconciliation , such as the peace proms and stuff . 
  i know i 'm late to the party , but i would like to give my opinion here . 
  whenever both parts of ireland decide to re-unite , i doubt all of the symbols of ireland * ( rep. of ) * could be used for a united state . 
  most of them would have to be changed due to political considerations, 
  look at our national anthem , * [ amhr\u00e1n na bhfiann ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/amhr\u00e1n_na_bhfiann ) ( or soldiers song ) * as an example of this . 
  its lyrics tell of our brutal struggle for independence from the united kingdom , and even mentions a `` saxon foe '' ( when translated ) . 
  even if we could get the unionists to accept reunification , the idiotic identity politics of the north would make it impossible for them to accept a song about fighting their ancestors as a national anthem . 
  even though the irish tricolour , is intended to represent both communities and the aspiration for peace between them , the events of the troubles as well as the tribal politics of the north , would also make it impossible for them to accept a flag of their `` opposition '' . 
  as a sidenote : i 'm not trying to insinuate one side was entirely blameless , both communities , as well as even the security forces ( ruc , british army , garda\u00ed , et al ) are guilty of many acts of abhorrent and disgusting behaviour . 
  ### ** the midlands ** - / u/drunk _ lawyer, 
   * ** what is your current country ? 
  i have none at the moment , i was / u/echo _ india, 
   * ** how long have you played on the - powers subreddits ? 
  as far as i can remember , i joined r/worldpowers , when it was about 1 month or so in to its first season , so about a year and 2 months . 
  i was on r/globalpowers since it start , with short-ish periods of being inactive between then and now . 
   * ** how much do you know about midlands , including its in-game history and real-life politics ? 
  i think i know a good bit about american politics on the whole , while i would n't know the exact manifesto of each party , i have a good knowledge of what the major parties stand for . 
  i also have a good knowledge of the various political and social issues from watching the news , i know a good bit about the debates over guns , police brutality , etc. 
  as well, 
  as far as in game history , i must confess i 'm not well versed in how the midlands was working since i left , i do know most of the early midlands history in the game and will try to research how the midlands was working since i left . 
   * ** how active do you think you can be ? 
  very active , now that i 'm on school summer holidays and my exams are over , i think i could get maybe a post a day , if not , at least 5 or 6 per week . 
   * ** how realistic do you think you can be ? 
  there are no doubts in my mind that i will be able to play incredibly realistically as the midlands , using previous posts as a base and moving forward with them in mind . 
   * ** why do you want to play as midlands ? 
  i 'd like to play as the midlands because of its interesting history , power , influence , and wealth . 
  as midlands , i could exert a stronger in-game role than i was able to as sweden , and wield a lot of power as it 's leader . 
  i 'd also like to play as the midlands because of its neighbours , the surrounding players are all players i have experience playing with and i hope i can make the game more interesting working with them . 
   * ** what plans might you have for the country ? 
  first of all , i will probably rename midlands , seeming as its impossible to use it without it sounding weird . 
  i also want to hopefully create posts on topics like culture , public events , law and order etc. 
  this would make sure i wouldnt exclusively post about military and defense topics . 
  as far as foreign policy goes , i want to keep my cards close to my chest , but i definitely want to have some fun in that arena . 
  i want to make agreements but also perhaps have an enemy to make it fun . 
  on the proposed topic of [ borders changing ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/globalpowers/comments/3bnu4l/meta_redrawing_the_us_borders/ ) , i am completely on board ( if it happens ) and will try my best to rp it realistically . 
   * ** why should we pick you above all else ? 
  i have a lot of experience playing on these subreddits and i believe i will be a good addition to the game as the midlands . 
  would a midian fleet be welcomed ? 
  great , we hope this is a turning point in our relations , out department of defence will be in touch to confirm what shall be sent . 
  m : military and such needs to be done , i 'll comment again later with what i will send . 
  midlands shall send a delegation of the joint chiefs of the midland armed forces, 
  hey , / u/roman _ consul, 
  do you know how the [ naval aircraft ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_united_states_military_aircraft#navy ) and [ all the marine corps stuff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_vehicles_of_the_united_states_marine_corps ) was split , it does n't seem to be accounted for in this or the other division post ? 
  oh , i 'm a retard , my fault . 
  thanks for telling me . 
  the republic of the midlands was abhorred when it found out that a fellow american nation was responsible for its actions , the actions were unjustified , and completely unjustifiable . 
  however , we hope that as a group , the american people , whether in any of the nations they find themselves in , can forgive the cascadians and move on to pave a brighter future . 
  yay, 
  abstain, 
  abstain, 
  yay, 
  crap , i 'll get a new name and resubmit,

  politicians are n't supposed to do anything in violation of the constitution ( which this is ) without a public mandate ( i.e verifiable majority ) .

  ** president of the appalachian republic ; **, 
  * rush holt *, 
  i 'd like to join the british libertarian independent grouping please . 
  creation of a government hierarchy, 
  whereas it has been deemed necessary , and , through common consent , desired , to unify , through voluntary association , the individuals of the continent as a single nation , governance of the nation shall henceforth occur through a three tier process : local , provincial , and central governments . 
  each shall have separate powers and responsibilities . 
  local government . 
  this nation is an organisation which functions best primarily and intentionally from the bottom up . 
  as such , the widest range of activity and power shall remain at a local level , where it has both the most impact and the most responsible maintenance . 
  responsibility for governing the community it effects is the best method to keep government relevant , and the most direct method of ensuring that the actions of the government reflects the desire of the people . 
  the closer a government is to its people , the more it can understand and respond to them . 
  c. provincial government . 
  allowing local governments to assume the main responsibility for governing their people combined with technology has eliminated the need for 50 separate states within the nation . 
  these states also functioned to increase inefficiency , foster conflict , lower standards of knowledge , and largely act as a divisive force among the people of the nation . 
  as such , instead , the 50 states shall be abolished and replaced by four large provinces , each corresponding to the time zone in which it resides : eastern , central , mountain , and pacific . 
  the former states of alaska and hawaii have been included in the pacific province ; former protectorates of puerto rico , the virgin islands , and other us holdings are henceforth free to decide if they wish to remain in the possession of the nation . 
  they may be added to the provinces if they so wish . 
  the function of the provinces shall be three fold : to act as an adjudicator between local governments should conflict arise , to ensure that local governments continue to respect the rights of their peoples , and to propose to and implement policy from the central government . 
  it shall not create law on its own ; rather provincial government may vote to enact a piece of local legislation as provincial law , and propose a piece of provincial law to the central government for consideration . 
  it must also ensure that both central and local law are upheld .
