  ** article ii - ** ` rights of the people `, 
  ** a government shall not intervene or restrict any free expression of the people in their pursuit of life , liberty , and property , without recourse , redress , and the most significant examination and justification . 
  this free expression includes but is not limited to :, 
  * freedom to speak freely one 's thoughts , opinions , and desires . 
  seditious or anti-governmental speech is also protected herein . 
  it follows that it is a right of the people to criticise , malign , disagree , or work to abolish any government created through his/her consent . 
  it also follows that restriction of this right is often the first steps toward tyranny , and no citizen should have to fear tyranny . 
  * freedom to publish free speech in media of all mediums , without restriction . 
  it does not however mean that the content of published works is free from consequence -- individuals harmed by statements made in the media may always and still seek redress for damage done to them . 
  this includes statements made by the government . 
  * c. * freedom to bear any and all arms as a means of personal defence , and as a guarantor of freedom to depose , dissolve , or destroy tyranny should it occur . 
  while the access to highly destructive and dangerous weaponry is greater than ever , a government who disarms its people for safety disarms them from liberty as well . 
  this right may be restricted if it is deemed in the public interest to do so . 
  * d. * freedom to assemble on all public properties , provided this assembly does not impede the rights of others to use said property equally . 
  questions regarding disputes as to whether one individual or group 's assembly on public lands is harmful to the rights of others may be adjudicated locally , with equal access to state their case . 
  * e. * freedom to protest at any time on any public land provided it is not violent in nature , block or impede the access to public or private property , or disable or destroy the property of another . 
  * f. * freedom to face accusation by either the government or the citizen in a court of law , with equal access to counsel free of charge , and under the presumption of innocence until it is proven otherwise . 
  individuals , both citizen and foreign national , may not be detained without recourse to counsel , and have rights to : humane treatment without torture , formal and public statement of charges , detention in the locale under which the crime occurred , a reasonably speedy and public trial , and impartial judgment by their peers . 
  * g. * the right to travel freely within the confines of the state without imposed detention or restriction . 
  a right to free movement is fundamental to liberty and life , and shall not be impeded without just cause , as demonstrated by a public application to the court for permission to slow or restrict the actions of individuals , and just cause requires specific evidence . 
  * h. * the right to privacy within one 's property . 
  government shall not enter , search , surveil , monitor , or seize an individual 's property without just cause , as demonstrated to a court prior , in formal application , without exception . 
  * the right to freedom from religion . 
  the government shall not show any favouritism toward a single religion or to those who do not practise it . 
  it shall not allow religious preference to interfere with governance , nor the religious preferences of those in government service to impose those views on others . 
  to be clear , citizens are free to practise any religion they choose . 
  government , however , is a secular organisation , and there shall ever be a wall between ` church and state ' . 
  all citizens , from those of varying religious beliefs , to those with none , have equal right , and government supports this best by not interfering at all .
