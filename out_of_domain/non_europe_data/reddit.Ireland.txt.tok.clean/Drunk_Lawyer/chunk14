  ### / u/drunk _ lawyer 's handy dandy guide to sending your country to war, 
  ** important things to include in war plan 's **, 
  ###### * location 's : *, 
  the conflict system is all about locations , the mods need to know where your soldiers are going to be , without this , they are n't able to accurately predict , where a battle will occur ( i.e where the two sides meet ) , from looking at the war plan 's for the east african war , they were devoid of any substance and were impossible to use plotting the soldiers movements . 
  an example of this was [ `` jonglei '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jonglei ) , when you research location , it turns out to be a state in south sudan , not just that , it has an area comparable to the size of greece . 
  giving that as a location simply wo n't do . 
  there are just too many variables . 
  my advice for this would be to do the following :, 
  * always give your start and end points as , towns or cities , without this , the mods ca n't predict the route the troops might take , and this messes up the conflict system . 
  * if you want to divide your troops into different thrusts , use the cardinal directions , the `` right flank '' is a matter of perspective , whereas `` southern flank '' has only one meaning , this cuts out a lot of confusion . 
  * finally , if you can give extra information like say , the coordinates ( longitude and latitude ) of points that they plan to take/hold , it really makes the mods lives easier . 
  ###### * equipment : *, 
  this was also a huge problem , people sent way too much and gave the work of researching what it was to the mods . 
  this is simply unfair on the mods as they have to research each individual thing and then rate it along a scale ( i.e x ^ th generation ), 
  also , do n't send thousands upon thousands of equipment , all it does is scale up the amount of casualties that both sides will suffer , again the less counting the mods have to do , the better . 
  as well , people intentionally fudged things like calling a [ cessna 208 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/cessna_208b_sks_%28105090285%29.jpg/1024px-cessna_208b_sks_%28105090285%29.jpg ) , a bloody `` fighter jet '' and calling transport helicopters `` attack helicopters '' when they blatantly were n't . 
  if you are going to day something is a certain type , then prove it !, 
  finally , and most irritatingly , people sent things like `` technicals '' , to the battle , if you do n't know what a `` technical '' is , its [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/technical_liberia.jpg ) , basically if it is n't purposely built for war , do n't attempt to use it , the conflict system wo n't be able to take it into account anyway . 
  i 'll do a sample table , of what information the mods need in such equipment list 's . 
  name : | quantity : | type : | generation : | link : | origin :, 
  m1a2 abrams | 15 | main battle tank | [ 3rd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_main_battle_tanks_by_generation ) | [ * link * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m1_abrams ) | appalachia,
