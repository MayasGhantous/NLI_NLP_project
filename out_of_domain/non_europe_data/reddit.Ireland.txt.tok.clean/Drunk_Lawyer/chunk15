  ** two sex offenders escape rikers island , manhunt underway **, 
  two sex offenders are on the loose tonight after a major escape from rikers island prison . 
  it is understood that they were both cellmates and escaped by tunnelling through a wall into a gap between prison cells , and from there through tunnels to the outside of the prison . 
  there names are john maher , 48 and leonid stronkovsky , 39 . 
  both were convicted on multiple counts of manufacture , selling and possession of child pornography , as well as defilement of children and other charges . 
  the new york department of corrections have begun investigation into how they got out , and it is believed they had inside help . 
  multiple law enforcement agencies have also been called up , to search the surrounding area . 
  it is believed that maher has relatives in the surrounding area , especially in the long island area , who have police officers stationed in their houses , to prevent them from giving any help to the escaped prisoners . 
  stronkovksy , meanwhile , is believed to have been born in what is now known as the russian federation , before emigrating to new york in 1994 . 
  it is believed that he does not have any close relatives in the area . 
  roadblocks have been set up on many roads , and hundreds of law enforcement personnel have been seen placed throughout the state searching for the prisoners .
