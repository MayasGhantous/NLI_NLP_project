  provincial government shall be closed to lobby and petition from individual and business interests . 
  e . the central government . 
  a small central government shall be created and maintained by a council of 10 representatives from each province . 
  the central government shall have the function of maintaining national infrastructure , healthcare , education , and defence standards . 
  it may not create legislation of its own , and shall be closed to lobby or petition from the public , in the same way that the provincial governments are . 
  the central government shall consider various pieces of provincial law for suitability as national law , shall ensure that each province is upholding its responsibility toward individual rights , and act to defend the nation if the need arises . 
  f. branches of government . 
  all three branches of government , the legislative , judicial , and executive , shall remain as functional branches , although not at all levels of government . 
  at a local and provincial level , a local court , legislative body , and an executive may exist . 
  at the central government level , however , only a supreme court of 10 justices , and a the 40 ( 10 from each province ) member legislative house need exist . 
  since declarations of war , changes to policy , and other such activities occur in a congress , and the nation 's congress is a closed system , an executive need not exist . 
  the supreme court will hear petitions from the provincial courts , as challenges to both provincial and national law , and the legislative body ( ie congress ) shall turn over enacted legislation to the provincial executives for execution . 
  g. reserved powers . 
  the people reserve the right to vote in direct democracy referendum laws with which they disagree . 
  a 2/3 majority of a local population can overturn its law , a 2/3 majority within the province can overturn a provincial edict , and 2/3 of the national voters can overturn any central edict . 
  in the effort to keep governance as low level as possible , provincial courts can only hear appeals from the local court and cases between local governments . 
  the same is true respective of the supreme court , and its verdicts are final . 
  with regard to the varying legislative houses , they shall not be constructed with population as the basis for constituency , as direct democratic methods are available . 
  local and provincial governments may set the size and number of representatives ; the majority vote of each local and provincial government will only count as one vote with regard to application at the next highest level . 
  in cases of a tie on a national vote , the issue shall be returned directly to the people , who shall vote , and a simple national majority shall resolve the issue . 
  i thought about this the other day ... 
  i 'll give it a shot . 
  article 1 - fundamental rights as basis for government, 
  all human beings are entitled to their life , liberty , and property , irrespective of any condition or ascribed characteristic . 
  this right is absolute and fundamental . 
  the free and voluntary association of individuals is a consequence of and guaranteed by the individual rights listed in part a. 
  individuals may elect at any time to organise themselves as they see fit ; however , organisations shall not and do not have rights above the individual rights of their constituents . 
  organisations do not have these ` collective rights ' either to exist of their own accord or to infringe upon the sacred rights of individuals . 
  they are a means to an end , and never an end in themselves . 
  c . a government may be created through the voluntary consent of the people , through a simple majority , and may have two functions : to protect the rights of all people , equally , and to facilitate the maintenance and sustainment of the area it was created to serve . 
  cases in which a situation causes conflict between point one and point two of the purpose for government shall receive special and critical examination . 
  d . a government shall not intervene or restrict any free expression of the people in their pursuit of life , liberty , and property , without recourse , redress , and the most significant examination and justification . 
  this free expression includes but is not limited to :, 
  freedom to speak freely one 's thoughts , opinions , and desires . 
  seditious or anti-governmental speech is also protected herein . 
  it follows that it is a right of the people to criticise , malign , disagree , or work to abolish any government created through his/her consent . 
  it also follows that restriction of this right is often the first steps toward tyranny , and no citizen should have to fear tyranny . 
  freedom to publish free speech in media of all mediums , without restriction . 
  it does not however mean that the content of published works is free from consequence -- individuals harmed by statements made in the media may always and still seek redress for damage done to them . 
  this includes statements made by the government . 
  freedom to assemble on all public properties , provided this assembly does not impede the rights of others to use said property equally . 
  questions regarding disputes as to whether one individual or group 's assembly on public lands is harmful to the rights of others may be adjudicated locally , with equal access to state their case . 
  freedom to protest at any time on any public land provided it is not violent in nature , block or impede the access to public or private property , or disable or destroy the property of another . 
  freedom to bear any and all arms as a means of personal defence , and as a guarantor of freedom to depose , dissolve , or destroy tyranny should it occur . 
  while the access to highly destructive and dangerous weaponry is greater than ever , a government who disarms its people for safety disarms them from liberty as well . 
  freedom to face accusation by either the government or the citizen in a court of law , with equal access to counsel free of charge , and under the presumption of innocence until it is proven otherwise . 
  individuals , both citizen and foreign national , may not be detained without recourse to counsel , and have rights to : humane treatment without torture , formal and public statement of charges , detention in the locale under which the crime occurred , a reasonably speedy and public trial , and impartial judgment by their peers . 
  these rights are also guaranteed during times of war or conflict , or threat to peace . 
  ` national security ' may never again be used in an attempt to subvert liberty . 
  the right to travel freely within the confines of the state without imposed detention or restriction . 
  a right to free movement is fundamental to liberty and life , and shall not be impeded without just cause , as demonstrated by a public application to the court for permission to slow or restrict the actions of individuals , and just cause requires specific evidence . 
  the right to privacy within one 's property . 
  government shall not enter , search , surveil , monitor , or seize an individual 's property without just cause , as demonstrated to a court prior , in formal application , without exception . 
  infringement of this right is a violation of all basic individual rights and shall not be tolerated or allowed under war or peacetime circumstances , and shall never be enabled by common consent . 
  the right to equal access to all government institutions . 
  services rendered by the government , supported by it through funding , or utilising government lands shall enable all citizens equal access , free of charge , to their product or service . 
  discrimination of any sort shall not be permitted , regarding access , with priority given through justification and oversight , to the most immediate need in situations where warranted and where all services can not satisfy needs immediately . 
  the right to freedom from religion . 
  the government shall not show any favouritism toward a single religion or to those who do not practise it . 
  it shall not allow religious preference to interfere with governance , nor the religious preferences of those in government service to impose those views on others . 
  to be clear , citizens are free to practise any religion they choose . 
  government , however , is a secular organisation , and there shall ever be a wall between ` church and state ' . 
  all citizens , from those of varying religious beliefs , to those with none , have equal right , and government supports this best by not interfering at all . 
  e. all rights guaranteed to citizens in this document shall apply to foreign nationals granted residency , and with the restriction of education benefit , to those within the state 's borders , both legally , and illegally . 
  these are my basic rights , justification for government , and what would be the ` bill of rights ' . 
  notice it 's not that far from the existing one in general . 
  i think we got that right . 
  article 2 will be the interesting part . 
  edit 1 : there has been some intense responses to the right to bear arms part . 
  my reasoning was that it 's unwise to allow the people who you need protection from to be allowed to dictate the terms of what you can use against them . 
  it is my opinion that this has happened , for good or ill , across a lot of states . 
  here is a possible edit :, 
  the freedom to bear arms as a means of personal defence , and as a guarantor of freedom to depose , dissolve , or destroy tyranny should it occur . 
  while the access to highly destructive and dangerous weaponry is greater than ever , a government who disarms its people for safety disarms them from liberty as well . 
  as such , neither the government nor the citizen shall possess weapons of mass destruction ; use of these weapons results in disaster of epic proportions and extreme loss in every instance . 
  a civilised society sees them as a losing proposition in all cases . 
  citizens then , may keep and maintain small arms and crew served weapons of limited destruction provided they can not be converted to wmd or are ` fire and forget ' . 
  let me know if this is better . 
  just a thought . 
  edit 2 : considering an edit to the part a to read , at the second sentence :, 
  this right is fundamental ; it can not be bought , sold , stolen , signed , or waived away . 
  it is presumed to be the default position of every government decision or activity unless , through extensive due process , it can be proven that a need exists for restriction of these basic rights , and as a last resort . 
  i would .

  oops , assumed it was developed , changed it . 
  the aas 's and the warships are to be replacing some of the existing stuff in a few years . 
  the vtol thing were just a mistake , the ch-53k is made by [ sikorsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sikorsky_ch-53k_king_stallion ) , and it exists , meaning i can build it right ? 
  fixed . 
  as a player , i could n't accept it , since its brand new , and probably includes equipment that the us would n't even share with its strongest allies .
