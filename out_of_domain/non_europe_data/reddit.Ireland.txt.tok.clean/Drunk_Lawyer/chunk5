  i 'm would assume you would know this , but portlaoise prison is our only `` high-security '' prison , and is where all people convicted of terrorism-related crimes are supposed to be held . 
  so i would think its something to do with the sensitive nature of the people being held there , and the prison service not wanting to give the people who would want to get them out of the prison any up to date information , like the positions of the defences forces on the wall . 
  it is strange that google does have the older image superimposed on the prison , and that bing does n't , but its probably because of their different policies regarding editing sensitive areas out/superimposing images over it . 
  also , if you look at the [ * wikipedia page * mentioned in the album ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/satellite_map_images_with_missing_or_unclear_data ) you can see the areas that are edited . 
  its nearly all places that people would think need some degree of secrecy , like military bases , high-security prisons and places that would be at a high risk of terrorist attacks . 
  also , it gives a little insight into the security of portlaoise prison, 
   an old satellite image from 2005 is superimposed over newer images for the entire area of the prison . 
  the prison houses convicted members of the provisional irish republican army ( ira ) and other illegal paramilitary organisations . 
  the security features include an ** army detachment of the irish defence forces armed with assault rifles and anti-aircraft machine guns . 
  an air exclusion zone operates over the entire complex . 
  the anti-aircraft machine guns may seem strange , but its probably something to do with [ this .

  welcome aboard , adding you now !,

  hello , and thanks for joining us !, 
  i will add you to our parties subreddit ( ** / r/mhoclibertarian ** ) in the next few minutes .

  \\ - * drunk_lawyer , deputy leader of the british libertarians *, 
  changed the names , they are still old-ish , but there the only well-known north-eastern us people besides celebrities i could think of . 
  the appalachian republic will join . 
  would it be possible to claim some irish insurgent group , fighting for irish independence ? 
  perhaps called the ** irish republican army ** or ** ira ** . 
  * also , i know it has been decided already but i really want to comment on ireland not being independent *, 
  i understand this is alt history , but ireland rebelled pretty much once a generation until we got our independence , so nobody would have agreed to a deal which did n't provide ireland with independence . 
  when collins , griffith and the others went to the negotiating table , they would have been willing to sacrifice basically anything in order to get independence . 
  it seems silly change this part of irish history because our struggle for independence is basically the foundation of most of our history . 
  it would be like britain never having an empire or the americas never being colonised to me .

  ninja edit :, 
  i have had hybrid teams for bpl , liga bbva , etc. 
  but they seem pretty predictable and they are basically full of the usual players ( while they have good stats they are n't anything special ) and its kinda a getting a bit dull since i 'm having to be sweaty , so i do n't mind spending a big proportion of the budget on a few heavy hitters . 
  also , i know my budget is a bit low , but i want to keep my other squad intact . 
  thanks so much , they are perfect . 
  no problem . 
  * damn canucks , first they steal muh maple , then they steal muh nhl . 
  the ** army council of the irish republican army ** has contacted various media outlets with its response , rejecting unequivocally any attempt to give ireland autonomy in place of full independence . 
   ` december 1960 . `, 
   ** re : ** ` british offer of autonomy `, 
   ` the crown forces wish to have a `` british dominion '' , they wish to subjugate the people , `, 
   ` of the world , under their foot , however the people of the world wish to govern , `, 
   ` themselves , however the british will not allow this , their jingoism clouds their view , `, 
   ` of other countries , they believe their way of a life is superior , and that other , `, 
   ` peoples must only be afforded `` autonomy '' , a deal which only provides token independence , `, 
   ` and still allows them to enforce their will on other peoples , we unequivocally reject , `, 
   ` this deal , and will make strides to secure the independence of the entire irish nation , `, 
   ` peoples and island . `,

   ` army council of the irish republican army . `, 
  rumours have also been circulating that many unnamed members of the irish republican army support increased autonomy , however this has been rejected by the army council as `` hot air '' , instigated by opponents of the irish republican army to undermine it .

  apologies for not being able to reply sooner . 
  + / u/user _ simulator / u/drunk _ lawyer, 
  gosh darnit , you 've discovered my masterplan !, 
  it allows me to nuke russia with no accountability, 
  sadly , however ,, 
   this right may be restricted if it is deemed in the public interest to do so . 
  i 'm pretty certain that restricting nuclear warheads is in the public interest . 
  yeah , when i recycled part of it from somewhere ( i forget , but i think it was r/askreddit ) , i was asking myself them questions , but i 'll give you how i interpret them . 
  * is a tank included in arms ? 
  the tank itself is completely legal to own , however all of its armaments ( i.e machine guns , cannon , etc. ), 
  have to be removed but can be replaced with replicas unless someone has the appropriate license , i.e for allowing contractors to train with the military, 
  on top of this , i added the qualifier :, 
   this right may be * restricted if it is deemed in the public interest * to do so . 
  so i think the organisation which decides if something was in the public interest to restrict something would restrict artillery and high-powered machine guns . 
  * are religious buildings taxed ? 
  yes , they are , they will be taxed the same as any other building :, 
   it shall not allow * religious preference to interfere with governance * , nor the religious preferences of those in government service to impose those views on others . 
  i interpret that as `` religions are treated the same as any other money-making organisation '' , however the government wo n't emplace a tax on people for believing in a religion . 
  * does the state define or recognise a religion ? 
  i left this as a loose end because the religion bit was a bit long , but i 'm going to define it under ` morey v. riddell , 205 f. supp . 
  918 ( s.d. 
   `` an organized association of persons dedicated to religious purposes '', 
  also , no religion will be officially `` recognised '' by the government , due to :, 
   there shall ever be a wall between ` church and state ' .
