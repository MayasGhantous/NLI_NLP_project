  however , the bill of rights will protect believers in a religion from being prohibited from or suffering discriminating because of , exercising their right of religious belief . 
  hopefully i answered your questions properly , i myself was pondering the questions before i posted this , feel free to ask any more questions . 
  well , they can bear any and all arms , provided they have the correct licenses . 
  i.e in theory , anyone can purchase a nuclear warhead , however in practice , the producers of the weapon do n't necessarily have to sell to the general public . 
  so , its legal to purchase a legal nuclear weapon , as long as you can find someone to sell it to you , obtain the correct license and then wait the waiting period as you would with any other weapon . 
  on top of this , applying for a license to own a nuclear weapon is going to get you put under surveillance by every law enforcement/intelligence agency on the planet , meaning while you could technically own it , if you ever attempted to use it to kill others , you would get done for conspiracy to murder . 
  * i assume a church may apply fornon-profit status ? 
  provided it does n't make any money , correct , however if it makes any profit , its profit will get taxed as any other business is . 
  * is communion now illegal for people under the drinking age illegal ? 
  most churches use grape juice in place of actual wine in my experience , especially for kids so this should n't be a major problem . 
  however , giving actual wine to a minor will still be illegal , as underage drinking will still be illegal . 
  this is more an issue for the states and d.c. to deal with tbh . 
  the bread part of communion wo n't be affected . 
  i meant it in relation to how the government is run . 
  i.e the government is separated * from * religion,

  [ heres the agreement i have with brazil ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/globalpowers/comments/3ckx3n/diplomacy_appalachia_and_brazil_sign_defense/ ), 
  i 'm not sure what i can add to this , so what questions are people interested in ? 
  its not just tyrone and fermanagh that have majority catholic ^ ^ 1 . 
  population, 
  derry and armagh also have a catholic majority . 
  if you look at this map of the local government districts by religion , [ * here * ] ( http://imgur.com/m3khcdk.ong ) , ( blue = catholic majority , red = protestant majority ) , you will see that , the protestant majority districts make up the rough shape of antrim and down , while the others have clear catholic majorities . ^ ^ 2 . 
  so , to be honest , county tyrone , fermanagh , derry and armagh would to most likely vote to go to the free state , to not have any large areas of nationalist support within the unionist area . 
  there would still be a * slight * nationalist majority in the moyle and belfast districts , even in that case . ^ ^ 3 . 
  * additional comments : *, 
  therefore , *** usually *** holding nationalist/republican/etc . 
  views , vice versa with protestants . 
  this was especially apparent in the 1960s . 
  [ ** here ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r2mhgpu.gif ) is a map i made , which overlays the county borders over districts . 
  colours were slighted fecked up though . 
  which would probably end up with tension between the twocommunities , due to the unionist community having a massive majority over the nationalists in the new borders , leading to a new troubles , due to the nationalists in these districts knowing they would never be allowed to join the free state . 
  this could be avoided as long as the remaining nationalist community was n't overtly discriminated against , unlike [ real life sadly . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_protestant_parliament_for_a_protestant_people ), 
  ` note : ` the religion information is based on the 2011 uk-wide census conducted in northern ireland , so in game it technically has n't happened , however , northern ireland is pretty conservative , and also has been segregated along religious and national identity lines since its creation , so it is definitely somewhat applicable in the 1960s . 
  / u/1tobedonex - * prime minister *, 
  do with this input as you will , its up to you guys anyway . 
  well , i do n't honestly know , to be honest , i see 3 options in my head . 
  also , i do n't want to be influencing mod decisions , so i 'll attempt to be neutral . 
  * plan 1 : * ** partition the island to its current irl borders , along with instituting the terms of the [ good friday agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/good_friday_agreement ) **, 
  * northern ireland population will be approximately split 50/50 between nationalist and unionist , preventing any discriminatory policies , due to the requirement for `` cross-community support '' for all legislation in the assembly . 
  * keeps the unionist community happy , as they are still in the united kingdom . 
  * the free state would have some degree of influence in the north , and would not be claiming the north as part of its territory , meaning relations between the two countries would be better . 
  ` cons : `, 
  * nationalists , while being happy that they are not discriminated against will still want some form of a united ireland . 
  * extreme unionists , i.e [ loyalists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ulster_loyalism ) , will be against the deal , as they dislike the free state having any influence over the north, 
  whatsoever . 
  * a conflict similar to the troubles would inevitably happen , because of discontent over not having a united ireland . 
  * plan 2 : * ** have a united ireland , just with an only autonomous government for ulster and a agreement similar to the good friday agreement allowing the uk influence in ulster **, 
  * most on the island , besides extremists , will be somewhat ok with this deal , as well as the people of britain who wo n't have to deal with a drain on their economy . 
  * the nationalist community will happy , as they have a somewhat united ireland . 
  * the uk would have some oversight into the goings on , preventing discrimination , but also not having to deal with the problem allowing it to focus on being a superpower . 
  ` cons : `, 
  * unionists and loyalists , similar to the catholics in option 1 will be happy that their opinions are valued and they are not discriminated against , however they will dislike not being in the uk . 
  * a conflict similar to the troubles would occur , just with unionists/loyalists wanting to go back to the uk . 
  * extreme nationalists , i.e republicans , do n't want the uk to have any power in ireland , and would oppose it similarly to loyalists in plan 1 . 
  * plan 3 : * ** give the uk and the free state joint-sovereignty over the area **, 
  * both communities would have their wish of a united ireland and staying within the uk , respectively , meaning the average citizen would be willing to support this deal . 
  * both communities could n't ever get discriminated , even if one community got the majority , as it would require 2 countries to agree on any legislation . 
  * the people of the 2 countries wouldnt ' be as badly effected economically , they wo n't have to support the economy of northern ireland , which is an anchor on either countries economy . 
  ` cons : `, 
  * its slightly more complicated , than the others . 
  of course . 
  * extremists on both sides would dislike it . 
  * a conflict like the troubles still could happen , however it would n't be as bad as irl or the first 2 plans i gave , as both sides would be ok with the status quo . 
  * more info on the idea : *, 
  all services would be supplied by both governments together , i.e their would be a joint :, 
  * parliament , of the mps and td 's from northern ireland elected to both countries parliament , who would decide on legislation pertaining to northern ireland . 
  * police and army , it would be funded by both , but staffed by locals . 
  * healthcare system , the nhs and hs\u00c9 are broadly similar and so could provide healthcare together . 
  other ideas i have , which would n't work in practice are :, 
  * an independent northern ireland . 
  * partitioning ireland , with down and antrim staying in the uk . 
  ( it wouldnt work economically ), 
  * sticking with the status quo . 
  * having ireland as a whole stay part of the united kingdom as a whole , with a devolved parliament similar to scotland or wales currently . 
  sorry for the wait . 
  it is called the [ ** bellamy salute ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bellamy_salute ) , and was used/performed while reciting the * pledge of allegiance * in schools ( ** i.e not during the u.s. national anthem ** as the person above said ) . 
  it looked like [ * this * ] ( http://imgur.com/sbmdu28.jpg ) or [ * this * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aqotvxr.jpg ) , so it only resembled the [ hitler greeting ( or `` nazi salute '' ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_salute ) because the arm was raised and stretched , the hand was upside down in the bellamy salute , with the hitler greeting being the opposite , however , the u.s. congress amended the u.s. 
  flag code to the current hand-over-heart salute during the second world war , because people thought it was too similar . 
  edit : grammar . 
  pretty much . 
  as soon as the gravity of the crimes committed in the camps was discovered , amongst other disgusting war crimes , any organisation/government/person with any respect would have purged any imagery associated with the nazi 's , even if it just had a similarity . 
  nazi symbols are only `` legally banned '' in countries like germany , austria , israel , etc. 
  which would have laws against the use of the symbols to prevent another nazi-esque political party being formed , but essentially , the only people who use these sort of symbols now , in any western country ( at least ) are lunatics and neo-nazis , with the rest of society completely abhorring the use of nazi imagery .
