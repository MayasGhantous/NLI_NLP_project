  ah perfect , thanks very much , thats what i was thinking . 
  we did use edmodo in third year , but i have n't heard about it in ty yet . 
  cheers . 
  yeah , funnily enough , its not getting the portfolio done that i 'm worried about , its my class teacher , i 've had her for junior cycle and she was one of the teachers who checked stuff without fail and punished you if it was n't done . 
  my school 's ty is a doss year ( or it seems to be so far ) , but i do n't want to get on the bad side of teachers for something that should take like 10 minutes a week . 
  i 'm not trying to be a teachers pet or anything , i just do n't want to be one of the idiots who ends up having to write a fake one on a page the minute before class . 
  thanks anyways . 
  oh , my mistake . 
  fixed . 
  [ m ] toppest kek of a based post . 
  ^ ( * i know i 'm just back , and these opinions may not be the most popular , but hear me out . 
  nothing to do with the scenario of how you restart the game , but a lot to do with how the new game could work . 
  i 've always associated / r/globalpowers with realism , however this realism has also sapped the fun out of being involved in the game , it seems that most people seem to expand their military , construct modern infrastructure and maybe re-design their national symbols . 
  this gets pretty boring after a while and saps any initiative from the game , making it stale . 
  * so , basically , my idea is this : *, 
  ** allow people to customise their country , before the game starts **, 
  ^ ( i get this sounds extreme , but i 'll go into detail below , ), 
  ** government wise : **, 
  players could choose to be a republic to totalitarian dictatorship , or anything ( reasonable , no shrekist utopia , etc. ), 
  in between . 
  this would allow for players to be more creative and would shake the game up giving it a new lease of life . 
  being stuck as a vanilla government is always going to get stale , the game will be more enjoyable when players can choose how their country is run . 
  for example , you could also turn back time , i.e turn zimbabwe back to a white-run rhodesia , just with the modern resources / stats of zimbabwe . 
  ** foreign relations wise : **, 
  players could choose isolationism , neutrality , belligerency , non-aligned , etc. 
  policies , this brings different players onto the world stage , instead of it being the usual * west vs. east * , it could be some other scenario , like * a asian-australasian military alliance vs. a afro-south american military alliance . 
  * of course this could be decided once the game started . 
  all existing alliances would be wiped and players could re-organise alliances as they saw fit . 
  ** territory wise : **, 
  this could be decided on a country by country basis , but players could ask to claim a union of multiple countries , think benelux , arab gulf union , australasia , east african union , maghreb union-type countries . 
  it would n't have to be based on support for such an idea , but more the balancing of the region/world , like you could n't have the entire european union as a country , but a union of 2 medium sized countries would be allowed . 
  basically , think of regionalisations on r/wp . 
  ** military wise : **, 
  just to make it clear , you have the irl equipment of the country ( s ) that you are given . 
  you ca n't just say `` i now have 400 f-35 's now '' . 
  expansion could be done when the game starts . 
  ** balance wise : **, 
  the us might be broken up , but so might russia and china and any other op powers , this would equalise the game and give ever medium sized country the chance to be relatively relevant , instead of being stuck as lacklustre powers who had to commit war crimes to get relevant . 
  ^ ( i know doing this would be unpopular to some , but shaking up the game could be great for the game . ), 
  as always , i 'm open to other opinions and discussion on this topic . 
  also , / u/dylankhoo1 's ideas are good . 
  haha , i was more trying to get along the lines of `` loosening '' the realism rules . 
  maybe , starting a x-powers sub is hard and if it fails you 've lost loads of time , effort , willpower so i probably wo n't . 
  i 'm not trying to say i 'm unhappy with playing the game as is , its just , even if you change battle mechanics , economic mechanics , etc. 
  the usual posts on the sub will still be :, 
  * making your military dick bigger, 
  * building useless modern infrastructure for a ridiculous cost, 
  * changing flags , anthems , emblems, 
  * a mod created crisis every so often , which gets ignored by pretty much everyone, 
  * complaints about rules/calls for another restart, 
  do n't get me wrong , i still enjoy the people here , its just seeing this day-in day-out gets stale quick . 
  the only real way to encourage creativity is , to let people skirt the bounds of realism . 
  * [ extra , just my opinion ] *, 
  i 'm not saying `` allow wars with israeli space lasers mounted on a pakistan leopard 2a7 tank high up in snowdonia vs a guy with an ak-47 on a camel in somaliland '' , what i am trying to say is , loosen rules around annexations or foreign policy , they spice things up and will brighten up the map a bit . 
  i remember when the map was like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/r/globalpowers/icfuhhx ) ( over 11 months ago ) , while it may look a tad unbalanced , with the massive empires in africa and asia , ( atlas mountain republic , nile union , nzere , arab peoples union , confederation of the arabian gulf , south asian union , to name a few ) the game was really fun to play and had plenty of opportunities to have fun . 
  being cock blocked by mods everytime you try to spice things up in your country/region can get annoying and i guarantee we have lost many people from mods being too heavy handed . 
  give people a chance to experiment , if it does n't seem feasible pull them up on it , but do n't say they have to play a certain way , they will just quit . 
  allow monarchies to be come republics and allow the same in reverse , government/polls are n't static , they change every election . 
  mods have often used their opinions of something when deciding whether to allow something , i.e having pre-confirmed believes about certain nations , leading to a western bias .

  ** capital : ** philadelphia,

  #### ** republic of the midlands renames to appalachia **, 
  ` philadelphia , september/october 2022 - ` ** from the nation 's capitol ** - 95 cents, 
  the * house of representatives * and the * senate * has passed a bill officially changing the name of the nation , to ** appalachia ** , or * appalachian republic * long-form . 
  the bill passed through the legislature with bi-partisan support . 
  it is thought this move is an attempt to distance appalachia from its former status as a part of the united states of america and create a homogeneous culture distinct from its neighbours . 
  public support for the renaming was said to be at about 70 % , with the dissenting percentage citing the lack of the word `` america '' in it as the reason they opposed it . 
  there was minimal protests on the streets of the nation , however , and people generally support the move by * president rush holt * as being beneficial to the nation . 
  the * department of state of appalachia * has announced it has begun the process of changing the signs on its embassies around the world , as well as offering a exchange programme where people who hold valid passports are allowed to renew their new ** appalachian ** passport free of charge . 
  in addition to this , the * house of representatives * and * senate * has introduced a [ new flag ] ( http://i.imgur.com/htuykup.png ) more representative of the new name of the nation . 
  the national flag was unfurled and hoisted at all public facilities domestically and around the world . 
  a new national anthem was also chosen , it shall be [ `` battle cry of freedom '' ] ( https://youtu.be/v582kpp43mg ) , written by american composer george frederick root during the american civil war . 
  its lyrics hark back to the former united states , whilst simultaneously looking to the future, 
  it is thought that these are being chosen now , in preparation for a drafting of an official constitution for the nation,

  #### ** niagara commissioned into the appalachian navy **, 
  ` washington naval yard , september/october 2022 - ` ** from the nation 's capitol ** - 95 cents, 
  the [ ** niagara ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_niagara_\\ ( 1813 \\ ) ) was constructed from 1812 to 1813 to protect the vulnerable american coastline on lake erie from the british and played a pivotal role in the battle for the lake . 
  along with most warships that served in the war , the niagara was sunk for preservation on presque isle in 1820 . 
  raised in 1913 , it was rebuilt for the centennial of the * battle of lake erie * . 
  after deteriorating , restoration of the niagara was started again in the 1930s , but was hampered by the lack of funds caused by the * great depression * and remained uncompleted until 1963 . 
  since then , it has been registered as a * united states coast guard training vessel * and the state ship of pennsylvania , with the dissolution of the * united states navy * , the ** appalachian navy ** has been left without a proper sail training vessel , it is hoped that this will fill the void . 
  the * niagara * shall be commissioned into the ** appalachian navy ** , and shall keep its original name , the * niagara * . 
  ** president of the appalachian republic ; **,
