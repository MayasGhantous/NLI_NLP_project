you might like music by [ the wolfe tones ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yodbwe0k_7s ) . 
  they cover a lot of songs by other artists , and perform a lot of irish folk and rebel songs .

  i 've never heard of it , is it worth watching ? 
  i ca n't remember where i first heard the song , it was probably through the `` related artists '' section on spotify !, 
  you might like the `` combat flight simulator '' series , they 're all quite old ( latest was released in 2002 ) but if you do n't care about the graphics , then they are a pretty solid choice , being both cheap and not demanding to run . 
  thanks for being so generous !, 
  i got it , thank you very much !, 
  you 're too kind !,

  personal favourite songs on the album : modern jesus , evil friends , hip hop kids and creep in a t-shirt . 
  in that order !, 
  i 'm jealous , what did they close on ? 
  i 'm sad that they 're not planning any shows in ireland anytime soon , looks like i 'll have to travel stateside if i want to hear it for myself !, 
  hahaha what a nice bot , i 'm fine , but thanks for caring u/laptopdude90 !, 
  my favourites have to be luna , come to and eyes off you . 
  great band , great album . 
  i think the irish defence forces have it as standard issue also , as do the austrians . 
  the irish special forces unit , [ army ranger wing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/army_ranger_wing ) , use the steyr aug a2 and a3 variants . 
  it mentions in the article that krombach received 15 years for causing the girl 's death , and her father is awaiting trial on kidnapping charges , as he was caught with 19,000 euros that he intended to pay the kidnappers with . 
  i 'd imagine they eventually did , since the father was n't then kidnapped himself for lack of payment . 
  i was , and you 're right , it does n't . 
  i said `` article '' in reference to the wikipedia article about the case , for some reason it never occurred to me that it might confuse people . 
  check it out , it 's more informative on the case !, 
  favourite songs : miami , spanish sahara and total life forever, 
  great album , greater band . 
  holy fire always be in my top 10 favourites . 
  i 'm from the north , ca n't see where the sinn fein-anti eu link is coming from . 
  on the utv european candidate electoral debate last week , sinn fein 's martina anderson clearly expressed that sinn fein believes in being a part of the eu . 
  while the dup and tuv were explicitly against the eu , the nationalist parties and the alliance party were in favour of it . 
  good point , a quick google shows that they have n't . 
  however , one article from the bbc states they dropped their opposition to the eu in the mid 90s, 
  racism and islamophobia are major issues in france at the moment , it 's especially clear to see looking at the success of front national in the recent european parliamentary elections . 
  yml community , its definitely one of the funnier comedy shows out there . 
  who thinks the tri-colour is associated with terrorism ? 
  it is confusing to think that some associate a flag , which is supposedly showing peace between catholics and protestants , with terrorism , as although , yes , a number of people and groups did fight and commit terrorist actions while using that flag to represent themselves , the flag is of a nation which is [ ranked the 12th most peaceful in the world ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_peace_index ) . 
  if you use hola ( or any similar kind of extension ) you can watch all world cup matches in hd on rte.ie , the irish television network . 
  their commentary is some of the best around , and the post-match analysis is solid also . 
  belfast , ireland, 
  when i tried zenmate there was no option to change your location to the republic , hola unblocker 's probably the best choice . 
  but ... your username ... 
  thank yahoo you 're wrong !, 
  across ireland ( the republic of ) yes , there are . 
  in the north , where theggers refers to , there is not , most likely due to the lack of immigration during the troubles . 
  its not to say that there are no black people in the north , just much fewer than in the south , especially outside of belfast . 
  i did n't downvote you , because i agree with you . 
  this is a subreddit for a game series , not politics . 
  enjoy the carcinogens at the estate bonfire tonight mate !, 
  could you link me it please ? 
  love seeing vice 's stuff , especially about here . 
  god , you clearly know absolutely nothing about the history of the country which you spout nonsense about . 
  i 'm catholic living here in belfast , i 'll never understand the protestant hatred of the pope , they scream , shout and screech insults and jokes about him with the impression that it offends catholics , but in reality , no one makes more fun of the church here than catholics themselves !, 
  trying to stay relevant in a world where no one cares about them anymore has led to more intense political shouting from the orange order and loyalist parties . 
  they 're clinging to their glory days of utter domination over catholics in northern ireland , but now that we live in a ( largely ) shared society , more and more people are realising the archaic nature of the marches , which at least in my mind ( the mind of a catholic living in belfast , so allow for some bias ) are as discriminatory as marches by the ku klux klan . 
  or a banner claiming that the psni are working with the ira , or effigies of a catholic , the pope or a republican politician , or an election poster of a politician who had racist abuse hurled at her due to her being from china , despite her not being nationalist or unionist . 
  aye , but loyalists love the queen , republicans are n't the biggest fans of the pope , what with his fancy hats and different accents , lording it over us from his balcony with his big staff , instead of lying down in the bogside with a provo company . 
  well , the religion playing a role in our government is definitely true , but you 're right that it is n't a religious dispute in terms of the cause of disagreements between nationalist and unionist parties . 
  however , this year alone , the dup ( including the party leader and first minister peter robinson ) along with the other unionist parties have come out and voted against legalising same sex marriage in northern ireland ( on religious grounds ) , while the nationalist parties have voted to legalise it . 
  along with this , in several high profile incidents such as the anti-islam hate speech spewed out by the sectarian bigot pastor james mcconnell , the dup have come out on the side of the protestant churches , rather than condemn the actions and words of a few small minded eejits . 
  spot the kid born after the good friday agreement, 
  i 'm grand , went to the arctic monkeys/jake bugg concert last night , great way to escape from all those orangemen up at home ( belfast ) and ended up meeting some unreal lads and getting in my first mosh , definitely worth the cost of the ticket and trip down , but 6 euros for a pint of that heineken cat piss ? 
  i 'd say we 're as mixed in terms of the craic we are as anyone else , of course there 's the ones who are extreme loyalists and extreme republicans who 'll only laugh at a policeman getting petrol bombed , but most people are a good laugh !, 
  whereabouts were you for most of the day ? 
  i 'm from belfast , and there 's a lot of this photo that really does n't add up for me . 
  do you have the backstory ? 
  i find it interesting that you quote kurt vonnegut in saying `` so it goes '' , but at the same time serve in the israeli military , did you not read in slaughterhouse five the paragraph in which vonnegut makes clear his opinion that participating in war or industries of war is wrong ? 
  yes , but while the us urban population is currently 100 million , would n't an invading force bomb urban areas ? 
  in cities with high population densities , civilian casualties would be huge and so the number of remaining americans would be much lower . 
  on top of what / u/thatwhiskeykid said , i never said anything about * levelling * a city . 
  bombing and missile attacks would cause massive civilian casualties , but cities could still largely remain intact , albeit with huge infrastructural damage . 
  also , * many * cities have been bombed since 1945 . 
  some of them try and claim that they support israel because ( and i am being completely serious about this ) they believe that ulster protestants are descendants of the lost tribe of israel . 
  [ here 's the wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tara_\\ ( northern_ireland \\ ) ) on the organisation tara , which is largely responsible for the spreading of this nonsense . 
  well , i think you mean hardline republicans . 
  the ira is ( and if you 're referring to the provisional ira , was ) a paramilitary group , not a political stance like loyalism . 
  as hard as it is for me to resist making all loyalists out to be absolute idiots , you 're right . 
  while the majority of loyalists ( and i 'm pulling the word majority out of my ass , i 've seen no statistics but just walking around the streets , driving by loyalist areas or following what popular loyalists do on facebook i think they 're the majority ) support israel , not every one of them believes they 're a descendant of the lost tribe of israel . 
  sinn fein is a political party . 
  since the good friday agreement in 1998 , they have supported the decommissioning process and have supported the psni . 
  prior to 1998 , sinn fein was the political arm of the provisional ira . 
  sinn fein are not `` terrorists '' , `` murderers '' or ( as you completely ridiculously claimed ) akin to the nazis . 
  if you knew anything , and i mean even the smallest ounce of information about the political situation in northern ireland , you 'd know better than to make a comment as poor as that about a place as complex as northern ireland . 
  i am no supporter of sinn fein , or any nationalist party here , but i know better than to compare sinn fein ( again , not the provisional ira ) to the nazis .
