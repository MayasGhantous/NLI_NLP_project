  they 're civilians , and should be treated as such . 
  is it wrong to fire missiles at a country 's civilian population ? 
  yes , for both militant palestinians and the israeli military . 
  the nightlife in a country really is n't a good measure of how developed or superior it is , if that 's the point you 're making about israel . 
  a country which also is in the middle east , yet is very well developed and participates in the fight against terrorism is jordan , a strong ally to the us and a country which has taken in huge numbers of refugees from palestine and syria . 
  jordan is a modern state who maintains strong ties with the us and lacks many of the problems of other middle eastern states , yet it is a country with a majority muslim population . 
  the nazi party did n't simply `` replace marx 's internationalism with nationalism '' , to paraphrase your comment . 
  there was no popular control of government in nazi germany ; power was incredibly centralised around one man , hitler . 
  you may want to look up some sources on the nazis , they were , without a doubt , the most powerful extreme right-wing group to ever exist . 
  here are some sources : from the [ united states holocaust memorial museum ] ( https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?moduleid=10005141 ), 
  [ from the new statesman ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/02/dont-ever-call-hitler-socialist ), 
  [ here 's a discussion on the topic on stackexchange ] ( http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/2383/if-the-nazi-is-a-far-right-party-why-is-it-socialist ), 
  yes , essentially there are , in so much as their ability to make decisions which directly affect policy or governmental action is non-existent . 
  absolutely , labour can influence the government 's decision making process through giving a voice to complaints or suggesting alternate responses to issues or suggesting amendments to bills , but they can not make anything happen , at all . 
  as i 'm sure you 're aware , the house of commons ' committees all have conservative majorities , and so any criticism or proposed amendment to a bill in standing/select committees can be completely ignored . 
  labour can team up with rebel mps from the conservatives and other opposition parties to seriously threaten the success of / force a government climb down on certain pieces of legislation , but even then , they have to ensure that all their own mps are in agreement and will toe the party line . 
  they can cause embarrassment to a prime minister or minister at question time , but other than that mentioned above , labour essentially have no political power in westminster , nor does any opposition party . 
  / r/empiredidnothingwrong, 
  to be clear , this is not the handbook of the provisional ira ( the ira typically thought of when talking about the ira . ), 
  this is the handbook of the ira during the border campaign in the 1950s , the ` old ' ira and is the first edition . 
  the provisional ira published their own version in 1977 . 
  this poster is most likely from the area known as northern ireland , but those who created it would definitely see that area as being simply `` ireland '' . 
  it 's waterford whispers , which is ireland 's ( fantastic ) variant of the onion, 
  hey , i 've used the `` grammar action ! '', 
  series of books for each of the languages i 've learnt ( french , spanish and italian ) and always found them to be fantastic , especially '' \u00a1 acci\u00f3n gramm\u00e1tica !, 
  '' , the spanish version . 
  they provide a simple but comprehensive explanation of the grammar of a language , as well as follow-on exercises for you to test your understanding . 
  there are also vocabulary books for each language available , translated as `` word for word '' ( the spanish variant is , as you 'd expect , ` palabra por palabra ' . ), 
  you 're right , 12 did n't , 10 did, 
  if a few people want it , we could probably sell it !, 
  i thought this was actually very pro-macron , incredibly so . 
  lines like `` try to read hegel , it 's super hard '' while saying that he wrote his thesis on this show him as intelligent . 
  that top post is a copy of a youtube comment left by erik from internetcommentetiquette , on a video by reportoftheweek , a guy who reviews fast food items while wearing oversized , old fashioned suits . 
  as someone from belfast , the idea that , even privately , someone could hold that kind of opinion about a terrorist attack , to think that runners in a marathon should pay the price for the actions of a section of the irish community in boston over 20 years ago as some kind of karmic retribution is shameful . 
  the twitter account in the first image is from jason marriner , former member of the chelsea headhunters , a london hooligan grouping . 
  he 's been in a few documentaries , including an undercover one done by donal macintyre . 
  while it 's common for hooligan groups to have links with far-right and far-left political groupings , it 's interesting that golding has publicly associated himself with him , as it 's a difficult move to defend given marriner 's previous convictions and golding 's supposedly tough stance on crime . 
  that said , it 's not like golding has n't done things which are much more indefensible . 
  hahaha i 'd love that , it was actually through reading about her harassment of dawn purvis that i came to find out about this . 
  this is probably the most rational and accurate comment in this entire thread . 
  the actions of israeli governments do n't equal judaism , just as the actions of purportedly christian governments , whether in northern ireland , . 
  britain or the usa do n't equal christianity . 
  that 's actually entirely false , the vast majority of punishment beatings are carried out by loyalist paramilitaries , while republicans are much more likely to shoot people as punishment instead . 
  loyalists in 2016/17 performed 59 punishment-style attacks compared to 35 by republican groups . 
  loyalists shot 3 people , and beat 56 , while republicans shot 25 people and beat 10 . 
  here are the statistics from the psni , if you want to take a look for yourself : https://www.psni.police.uk/globalassets/inside-the-psni/our-statistics/security-situation-statistics/2017/annual-security-situation-statistics-report-2016-17.pdf, 
  i 'm sorry that you feel that way , but the fact remains that the empirical evidence supports my argument and only conjecture supports yours . 
  your argument about people in republican communities not reporting crimes to police is a good one , but it also holds true for loyalist communities , the simple fact remains that in any community opposed to the psni , co-operating with police is stigmatised and dangerous , whether it 's orange or green . 
  as for the point about republicans shooting people and not beating them , a much more likely explanation for this is that dissidents simply have more available weaponry than loyalists , as evidenced by the numbers of weapons found in connection with dissident republicans versus loyalists , also found in the statistics i provided earlier . 
  please , do n't get angry about this , it 's a waste of your time . 
  this could be copied and added as a new section to the sub sidebar , you 've written a great piece and could help so many people . 
  i bought ethereum at the recent dip and am happy with the results so far , i used coinbase with my uk debit card , but i had to do it twice , there 'd been an error with the way i had set up my account with the vault . 
  try it again , maybe you 've made an error like me !, 
  it may be that mine only worked because it was for ethereum , but yeah , check it out !, 
  good luck with it man, 
  his comment is very clearly sarcastic, 
  hey man , looking for one of those amazing shirts , i 'm a size m , huge fan of the design . 
  also , what determines a hostile territory ? 
  are all inhabitants against the occupation or are there people who are happy about it ? 
  to what degree do they oppose the occupation and what forms does opposition take ? 
  a great case study for this would be operation banner , the british army 's aid to the civil power operation in northern ireland . 
  of course this is a relatively unique case , but due to the length of the conflict , the various strategies employed by the british and the various opponents they faced , there is a lot that can be learned about occupation operations , even though this operation took place within the united kingdom . 
  it is surprising to me that there is no subreddit exclusively dedicated to learning the french language . 
  while this subreddit has many posts and excellent resources for french learners , they are mixed in with a great deal of posts entirely written in french , along with some general articles and posts relating to french speaking parts of the world , which are not as useful to learners , but still deserve their own subreddit . 
  in my opinion , to form a subreddit where resources and tips for learning french could be shared would be a good idea , as it would allow more thorough and detailed teaching/learning to occur . 
  personally , i benefited greatly fron / r/learnspanish , but not as much from / r/spanish , and i think doing the same sort of split with / r/french would encourage more people to learn the language . 
  ** ease of learning **, 
  well , there are many reasons to learn galician , but for me , i find that the most important one is the ease with which the language can be learned for speakers of spanish , catalan or portugese . 
  in fact , the similarities between galician and the other languages are such that when large numbers of tourists have visited portugal , the spanish government has loaned galician policemen to the portugese , as they are capable of speaking to both spanish and portugese people . 
  however , ease should n't be the only reason that you learn galician . 
  ** number of native speakers **, 
  there are 2.4 million native speakers of galician , and as reported in 2007 , 58 % of the population of galicia use it as their first language . 
  in addition , 91 % of the population of galicia are able to speak the language , and as reported in the 2001 census , 99 % can understand the language . 
  what 's more interesting is that galician bucks the trend as a minority language - it is actually growing instead of dying . 
  between 1991 and 2001 , the percentage of people able to read and write galician increased by 19 % and 23 % respectively . 
  with the fall of franco ( who , coincidentally , was galician ) and the introduction of democracy , galician has been brought into the country 's institutions , and it is now co-official with spanish in galicia . 
  galician is taught in schools , and there is a public galician-language television channel , televisi\u00f3n de galicia . 
  although the most common language for everyday use in the largest cities of galicia is spanish rather than galician , this is changing , with younger generations now able to be brought up learning galician in schools , something which was outlawed under franco . 
  galician is still the main language in the rural areas , though . 
  the royal galician academy and other galician institutions celebrate each may 17 as galician literature day ( d\u00eda das letras galegas ) , dedicated each year to a deceased galician-language writer chosen by the academy . 
  often referred to as spain 's best kept secret , galicia gives travellers an alternative spanish experience , with its strong celtic connections , wild beaches and arguably the best seafood in europe , yet it remains largely unexplored by the tourists flocking further south.while santiago de compostela is galicia 's most famous city and one of the world 's biggest international pilgrimage destinations , this terra de meigas ( land of witches ) offers many unmissable stops :, 
  * the magnificent r\u00edas : divided into the r\u00edas baixas ( lower r\u00edas ) in the southern part of the region and facing the atlantic ocean , and the r\u00edas altas ( upper r\u00edas ), 
  * sanxenxo : unofficially known as ` the beach of madrid ' due to the high number of madrile\u00f1os who holiday in this little municipality , sanxenxo boasts the highest number of european blue flag beaches in spain, 
  * castro de baro\u00f1a : this excavated celtic settlement in the wild r\u00eda de muros e noia is only accessible via a mile-long footpath , but the panoramic views of the r\u00eda and historic sights are essential to understanding galicia 's history . 
  ** however ** these reasons are but a few , and the most important reason to learn galician is that it 's something you want to do . 
  it should n't be a chore , but instead something you enjoy . 
  ** tl ; dr galician people are very attractive . 
  ** why i made the subreddit **, 
  despite being a learner of spanish for 6 years now and despite having a few friends from several of the different autonomous spanish regions , i had never considered the idea of learning one of the minority languages of the country . 
  after some research , i settled on galician . 
  however , i noticed there was n't much representation for the language on reddit , save for one subreddit with around 5 posts , made 2 years ago . 
  so , i decided to make the subreddit , / r/learngalician , in the hope that redditors could find and share useful galician resources there . 
  ** what subscribers can expect **, 
  aside from active moderation , the subreddit will feature :, 
  * the sharing of resources , such as links to text , video and audio sources, 
  * asking and answering of questions on any relevant matter, 
  * information on the culture of galicia , as well as topical news, 
  * information on things to do in galicia , as well as information on study programmes and work programmes in the region, 
  * translation requests and translations of any material in galician, 
  * links to any relevant resources for language learning , not just those featuring galician ( e.g.
