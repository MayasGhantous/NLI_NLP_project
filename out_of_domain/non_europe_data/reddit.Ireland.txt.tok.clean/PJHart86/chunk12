  even 5 % of the budget to the writer would be something ... 
  sure , show this pointless waste of oxygen on tv but by all means axe bbc3 ... 
  they 're turning it in to an online only thing . 
  in my opinion it 's generally a better use of airtime than a debate between those two irrelevant idiots . 
  must be a 10-2 ... 
  these are still unpaired , as you ca n't swap them out for their antonym and still have a sentence that makes sense . 
  ( eg ; i am dressed / i am undressed ), 
  where as `` he has debunked the rumour '' means that he has proven the rumour to be false . 
  `` he has bunked the rumour '' is not generally taken to mean that he has proven it to be true . 
  although your definition of `` bunk '' is correct , we do no use it in the same way as we use `` debunk '' . 
  as you already said , `` cessant '' never evolved to become a form of `` cessation '' , therefore `` incessant '' has no pair . 
  unswerving is an interesting one . 
  it has taken on an idiomatic meaning ( as in true , steadfast ) where as its antonym `` swerving '' is generally used only in the literal ( the car was swerving from left to right ) . 
  therefore when we use it as such ; `` his loyalty to the king is unswerving '' makes sense , whereas `` his loyalty to the king is swerving '' generally does not . 
  i imagine a native speaker could figure out the intent , of course , though the word most likely to be used here is `` faltering '' , and in fact the pairing of unfaltering and faltering works for both sentences in a way that unswerving / swerving does not . 
  is he playing 2 player on that thing !?!, 
  and somehow everyone can afford the rights to at least one radiohead song ... 
  ca n't wait to hear his thoughts on advent !, 
  hey thanks for reading !, 
  i 'm working hard at the moment to cut the dialog down and streamline the action , as i know over-exposition to be one of the main weaknesses in all my first drafts . 
  i would love to write a whole series about the international brigades in the spanish civil war but since they did n't win too many battles and lost the war it might be a bit of a downer ... 
  i was purposefully avoiding flashing back to it but i think i will reconsider based on these notes . 
  although ww2 is drilled in to the national psyche , my mission with this is to explore the war from an angle that we do n't often see . 
  so in this episode it 's french collaborators like petain and the carlingue . 
  perhaps it is n't clear ** why ** they want to assassinate petain from the outset but that can be easily addressed . 
  finally i shall leave you with yves ' explanation as to why she has a boy 's name - thanks again for the notes , it was very helpful !, 
  you know , i heard that all the women in your unit were killed at perdiguera ... 
  in spain michel thought it would be better if i pretended to be a boy . 
  that 's why they call me yves . 
  * metal gear !?!? 
  i read a feature script recently that could literally have been halfed in length by doing this . 
  bollocks it doesnt . 
  i 'd recommend a script with good form and a streak of originality before i 'd recommend another soulless , by-the-numbers save the cat . 
  if you 're wondering why youve been downvoted , it 's because this sub is mainly for screenwriting discussion and this certainly doesnt qualify . 
  maybe try / r/producemyscript, 
  guilty . 
  all i mean is that i would n't fail a script simply because it doesnt follow every single one of a particular set of rules, 
  if you plan to change at work anyway you might as well get some padded shorts . 
  my commute is usually about the same length as yours and these shorts have worked out great so far :, 
  really appreciate you taking another look !, 
  the series question is ( or rather , should be - i 'll work on it ) will they survive the war or is black leading them all to their deaths in pursuit of revenge for his doomed ideology and the season question is ( i 've expanded on this a bit in the new draft ) whether the british are going to fuck them over and/or sell them out in some way . 
  black is recruited `` off the books '' because , as far as the british are officially concerned , he is an enemy combatant and is still wanted by the police in northern ireland - again , this is something that is clearer in the current draft and also adds tension between black and durnford-slater as there is now an element of blackmail in their relationship in that ds will turn in him if he does n't sign up . 
  i tried to write the flashback in , but you 're right it does n't really work . 
  as far as a whole series set in spain goes , i think it would have to be a very different beast ... 
  i 'd have to start again from the ground up , which is something i might do but i have deadlines !, 
  i 'm aiming for bbc writers room deadline on the 31st but will try and get something in for screenwriting goldmine by the 17th as well . 
  thanks again for all the feedback !, 
  no shit !, 
  well first off , it 's a great sub and i did n't downvote this post . 
  it 's just not often i see posts here drop below 1 and i thought i 'd offer an opinion to someone i ( mistakenly ) thought was new . 
  you 're right on all counts there but i really do agree with op 's sentiment , that the concept of artistic `` form '' is better than prescriptive rules , that 's all . 
  i write and produce too so i know how much of a bollocks funding can be - good luck with the short !, 
  everything i know is a lie ... 
  first bob crow , now tony it 's a sad week for the uk left . 
  in what way ? 
  but he 's got sarge stripes ... 
  ca n't believe i came here * twelve entire hours * after this was posted and nobody has congratulated op on their * nice rack * . 
  i know at least one place that rotates their password ... 
  raleigh pioneer of undetermined vintage that i rescued from a mate 's yard . 
  i 've upgraded it from a very basic hybrid to a good commuter / all-rounder with mud-guards , pannier rack , an altura pannier bag , butterfly handlebars and axa lights . 
  it 's a chromoly frame so by no means light but more than capable of handling harsh city life and the occasional longer trek . 
  bike was free and i 've spent around # 100 on upgrades - love it !, 
  they rotate it for a reason . 
  caf\u00e9s have passwords on their wi-fi for a reason . 
  you have to buy something to make use of it . 
  it 's hard enough to run a small business in ni without people ganking your wi-fi . 
  just ask !, 
  the shopkeeper seems better off after the apocalypse - at least he has clothes !, 
  just got tickets for the ulster v connacht game - should be a good one !, 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  i find it slightly ironic that you 're worried about the nsa ( or whoever ) accessing your data but yet you 're happy to tell the whole world ( reddit ) about your firearms license , when and why you testified in court , how long your family has been in the states ... if i was the nsa and i wanted to find out about you i would just read this thread lol . 
  sounds like the management is as good as the advertising ... 
  / r/historyporn should see this if they have n't already, 
  aliens !, 
  was n't sure how to do that but full credit to [ chris lindsay ] ( https://twitter.com/chrisalindsay ) of course . 
  could be chalk , but the giro is n't coming to belfast for well over a month and given our traditional climate , i would expect chalk to be long washed away by then ... 
  yeah do n't quite believe that they would paint it one with something so permanent but i 100 % do believe that the council would leave wet paint ( i assume chalk paint is wet when applied ? ), 
  on a cycle path with no warning signs . 
  you can see evidence of one of their other genius ideas in the photo : breaking up the path every 10 metres with rows of cobblestones - hope you brought a mountain bike !, 
  picked up by the london times !, 
  this was a fun read !, 
  here 's some thoughts . 
  ** formatting ** : action scenes can be a strain on traditional formatting . 
  my suggestion to you would be to differentiate between stuff that we see inside the mech with stuff that goes on outside by breaking them in to separate scenes eg :, 
  int . 
  havok 's cockpit - day, 
  havok presses some buttons and eats a sandwich . 
  street - day, 
  havok 's mech thumps down the street and steps on a kitten . 
  also , when something happens later , then that 's a new scene , too . 
  ** character ** : at the moment this reads like an , albeit really cool , videogame cut-scene rather than a scene from a movie with real characters and real stakes . 
  the cut and thrust of deedee and havok 's relationship should match the cut and thrust of the battle . 
  maybe deedee is wary of cocky mech pilots ? 
  havok tries to convince her that he 's down to earth , as he engages in some showy gambit ( like ripping off the mech arm and smacking another mech with it ), 
  i do n't want to be too prescriptive so have a think about what the characters want and how their actions in this battle help or hinder their goals . 
  should havok really get everything he wants - a victory in battle and a date ? 
  where does the story go from here ? 
  fear and loathing on the campaign trail '72 by hunter s thompson . 
  i did n't know much about american politics going in but i 've never read a book that made me feel so completely involved in real events . 
  these lines in particular give me chills to this day :,
