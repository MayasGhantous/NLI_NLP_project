   there was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we, 
  were doing was right , that we were winning ... and that , i think , was the handle -- that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of old and evil . 
  not in any mean or military sense ; we did n't need that . 
  our energy would simply prevail . 
  there was no point in fighting -- on our side or theirs . 
  we had all the momentum ; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave . 
  so now , less than five years later , you can go up on a steep hill in las vegas and look west , and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark -- that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back . 
  you have ** no ** knowledge of film history and you 're applying for film school . . ? 
  not even of the big names that made their names before 2000 ? 
  george lucas ? 
  what 's your favourite movie ? 
  planet x - nice . 
  i do this . 
  my personal voice is quite sweary so i use swear words as default intensifiers then come back and replace them with words that suit the character . 
  sometimes that character is sweary too but more often than not the f-bombs all get cut . 
  the poor car will never get to graduate now :(, 
  producer ( of funded shorts ) here . 
  could n't agree more with all of the above . 
  would also add that even if you ca n't afford to pay someone their standard daily rate , they should always get something - even if it 's just # 10 or a 6-pack of beer . 
  i attended a great talk by [ john yorke ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/into-the-woods-stories-work/dp/1846146437 ) recently where he agreed 100 % with what you 're saying here and expanded on the reasons why it works . 
  i have n't had a chance to read his book yet but the talk was excellent . 
  i would potentially be interested in this . 
  i do a bit of what you describe for fun anyway . 
  if you 're interested in reposting anything from my blog http://belcast.wordpress.com/ let me know and i 'll send something over . 
  my instinct would be to break it up with full scene headings as i described but this is n't gospel by an means ... 
  often when issues like this come up , it helps to think of a screenplay as what it really is - a production blue print . 
  when your theoretical ( for now ) crew comes to shoot this script they will treat everything that happens in the cockpit as a scene and everything that happens on the battlefield as a scene and will shoot them separately . 
  this is just my instinct after working on sets for 6 years as well as writing - others may disagree . 
  as for the character conflict , of course you will set it up in earlier scenes but i still think you should ramp it as much as possible . 
  at the moment havok talks deedee in to a date a bit too easily , i think . 
  also , if this is the middle of the story , just make sure that you are n't getting them together too early - where do they go from here ? 
  ( i sort of hope that havok gets captured and deedee has to rescue him but that 's just me ... ), 
  that smart gun rig is sick . 
  same here !, 
  though ironically i am writing this from a coffee shop ... 
  i just joined in for series 2 and loved it . 
  i would describe it more as a comedy drama than a sitcom and it 's better for it imo . 
  going back to watch series 1 asap . 
  i worry that if it fell off after ( presumably ) being tightened with the correct tool that you may not be able to reattach it by hand in a way that will be safe to ride home ... 
   we live in the tunnel at the end of the light . 
  a hauntingly beautiful turn of phrase that sums the whole thing up perfectly . 
  well one of today 's is about the rwandan genocide so maybe not * every * day . . ? 
  the only way i will accept another die hard sequel is if it is called die hardest . 
  what i mean is that by calling it * die hardest * , you have automatically won me over !, 
  the tv / film industry is n't doing too badly either . 
  * everywhere * has problems . 
  when i lived in china it was dirty , there was a lot of poverty and there was a certain amount of hostility toward white people like me ... 
  in western australia i also noticed a lot of casual racism , people took their lifestyles for granted and the amount of bureaucratic , nanny-state bullshit borderlined on the absurd . 
  visiting my girlfriend when she lived in the american midwest , the landscape was flat and ugly , public transport was practically non-existent and every shop or restaurant was part of a chain . 
  now i loved living in china and australia and i enjoyed my time visiting the states as well but i do n't think i would have wanted to live in any of those places full time . 
  by staying here , buying a house here , contributing to the local economy , i feel like i 'm making a difference - helping drag this beautiful country out of its dark past . 
  maybe i 'm kidding myself , but i 've lived in places where most people have a lot less than us and i 've lived in places where most people seem to take what they have for granted . 
  i 'd rather stay here and try and make it better . 
  i 've just finished a pilot for a historical drama and my advice is to immerse yourself in the material as much as possible . 
  if you 're writing about something that interests you , the research should come as second nature and not even feel like work . 
  if you do n't enjoy reading books about the civil war , is a reader likely to enjoy reading your script about it ? 
  in my case , the idea for the drama came from historical books that i was reading anyway for fun ( homage to catalonia by orwell and irish freedom by richard english if anyone cares ), 
  for spot-fact checking ( like the date of a battle or a persons name ) i 'm constantly referring to wikipedia . 
  if the wiki entry seems suspect i 'll google around a bit and if i have to , i 'll order up a book from the library . 
  read and watch anything related , as long as you enjoy it !, 
  if you do n't enjoy it , maybe think about telling a different story . 
  lots of rise against , anti-flag , hot watet music , bouncing souls , therapy ? , slf , against all authority ... all this stuff is on my bike playlist which i often use as my general getting shit done playlist . 
  well , as it happens i ** do ** work in the tv industry here and have done since the days before game of thrones . 
  i 'm 27 and i own my own house . 
  i 'm not exactly loaded but i 'm not completely skint either . 
  ni screen and bbc northern ireland have been incredibly supportive in the 6 years i 've worked in the industry . 
  from helping fund the irish language drama on which i got my first trainee job , to the fully paid 18 month training contract i landed with them in 2011 right up to the free health and safety course they provided for me in january and the * also free * script development workshop i attended * yesterday * . 
  if creatives are hitting a wall when they apply for tv and film jobs here , they 'll certainly hit a wall when they apply for jobs in london , where the competition is much fiercer . 
  there are plenty of opportunities in ni . 
  there are a lot more than 2 traineeships per year at ni screen , i know because i was one of ** at least 15 ** the year that i was accepted . 
  the industry is n't going to hand you a career on a platter . 
  no industry is . 
  you have to work your ass off , just like everyone else . 
   then you must be aware that a large number of people who work in film/tv , apart from perhaps the people working on bbc shows , are largely out of work outside got season . 
  i have never worked on game of thrones and i have n't been out of work for more than 4 weeks at a time since 2011 . 
  sometimes that 's 4 weeks then a couple of days then another 4 weeks but it keeps me ticking over . 
  the bbc is not a fortress , it is possible to get jobs there and a lot of their programmes are made by indies these days . 
   there have been 2 trainee positions available in the last 10 months . 
  not fifteen . 
  two . 
  you ca n't expect there to be a traineeship waiting for you as soon as you need it . 
  when aim high comes up , apply for that . 
  apply for csv . 
  apply for skillset training bursaries . 
  apply for the post-production training scheme if that 's what you 're in to . 
  there 's script training schemes , director shadowing schemes but obviously all these schemes are n't open all the time !, 
   if you do what most people do , i.e. 
  wait for a crew call on ni screen , you 'd have had at most 2 opportunities since last summer , none of which were for work last longer than six or so weeks . 
  this is n't what most people do . 
  most people * actively * seek out work by contacting production companies , setting up meetings and putting themselves out there every single day that they are n't working . 
  most people who want to get a job , anyway . 
   you seem to be a script reader . 
  i believe i 'd be capable of that job , given my professional and academic experience . 
  unfortunately , my experience professionally is in theatre , not tv . 
  i am a script reader but i also work in production , mostly as a researcher and sometimes ( like now ) as a script assistant . 
  i got my first script reading gig by offering to do a trial script report for bbc ni and then busting my balls to make sure it was as good as possible . 
  if you 're willing to put your money where your mouth is , there 's work out there . 
  prior to this gig , i had * never * worked as a script supervisor . 
  i 'm not in to theatre much but i assume theatre companies need readers too . 
   despite contacting ni screen and bbc , found zero routes into production , even as a runner , over a number of years .
