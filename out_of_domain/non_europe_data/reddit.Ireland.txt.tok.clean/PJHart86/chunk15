  you know what effort you 've made , but i do n't and to be honest it 's no odds to me particularly . 
  all i 'm saying is that the screen industries here are doing quite well , and i do n't appreciate it when my talent and hard work and that of my colleagues is explained away as `` luck '' . 
  even if it is n't to everyone 's tastes , i 'm proud of the work i did on monumental . 
  it was tough going but i had a blast with some awesome people and best of all it put food on my table , paid my mortgage and got me more work with the same production company . 
  many people do cross over from writing and performing in theatre to writing and performing for screen but i do n't think that experience in those roles necessarily give you much of an advantage when it comes to working in tv production , especially unscripted tv . 
  if you ( and i 'm not saying this is * you * you ) come to production hoping to get `` discovered '' as an actor or a writer then you 're going to have a bad time ... 
  i guess if we 're signing off now i 'll just say this : you seem frustrated that nobody in the industry wants to give you the time of day - i 've given you a fair bit of time today and i 've been as honest and forthright about how to go about getting production work in ni as i can . 
  how about this , if you 're more interested in getting in to writing for the screen than production and you have a script you would like read by a professional script reader i 'll prepare one free script report for you , just as i would do for bbc ni or ni screen , on any screen-formatted script of 120 pages or less . 
  no worries dude , all the best with your writing !, 
  far left is the android . 
  ripley is ripley ( about 27 years shy of her inevitable death from cancer ) . 
  meek and vulnerable taylor will turn out to be the company stooge and the eccentric red head will be a bitch at first , but later save your bacon from the alien/company/android ( but not cancer ) . 
   it is often stated that the union flag should only be described as the union jack when flown in the bows of a warship , but this is a relatively recent idea . 
  from early in its life the admiralty itself frequently referred to the flag as the union jack , whatever its use , and in 1902 an admiralty circular announced that their lordships had decided that either name could be used officially . 
  in 1908 , a government minister stated , in response to a parliamentary question , that `` the union jack should be regarded as the national flag '', 
  why not ? 
  it 's not like she has much else going on right now ... 
  average salary of # 15,000 ... 
  amen to that . 
  i almost felt bad about posting the link here , as they 're obviously just courting controversy as click-bait . 
  mostly i 'm curious to see if anyone agrees with any of his points i guess . 
  for you , they have [ this !, 
  ] ( http://www.totalfilm.com/features/is-alien-3-really-a-misunderstood-masterpiece ), 
  this is pretty much exactly how i remember the soldiers in terms of uniforms / armaments when i was growing up so late 80s - 90s seems likely . 
  i remember that when things were quieter in the late nineties - 2000s , you would see them in their berets more often than their helmets so it 's likely that this is earlier rather than later ( the kid 's dress sense suggests this too but you never know with the nutters in ni ), 
  it looks like this taken near a [ peace wall ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peace_lines ) so there 's a chance that they have their lids on because they 're expecting trouble . 
  hello peter - just wanted to say that i hope you 're enjoying belfast and a big thanks to you and all the got gang for giving our media industry a good kick up the arse !, 
  improvised mortars were commonly used by the provos to attack barracks and police stations . 
  petrol bombs would have little effect even without the cage and rpgs were in relatively short supply afaik . 
  al qaeda never came within inches of assassinating bush or blair though . 
  maybe ask the people of birmingham or gilford if they think the troubles were only `` over there '' . 
  he had some decent play at 13 for ospreys iirc . 
  i 'd be happy to see him in the centre with trimble and gilroy on the wing again any day . 
  / u/whiteyak41 is 100 % right about your formatting . 
  the objective at this stage ( i imagine ) is to get people to read your script and you need to clean up your formatting massively before that is likely to happen . 
  you need to be more economical with your words , it 's a screenplay not a novel . 
  for example, 
   cornelius scipio ( about 18 ) , a young lad, 
  should just read, 
  it 's accepted that the age in brackets is a casting guide , you want an actor that looks about 18 . 
  got it . 
  you 've already told me everything i need to know about this guy 's age . 
  `` a young lad '' gives us nothing ( and arguably confuses things as i personally would consider a young lad to be like ... 12 ) . 
  i 'm sorry to say that i stopped reading after a few pages for the simple reason that in its current format it is n't very readable . 
  it 's very difficult to evaluate the story and dialogue until the formatting is fixed . 
  for example , what i read so far feels muddled and sluggish but clearer formatting and concise action lines will go a long way to fixing that i imagine . 
  i love doing titles !, 
  when i work in tv development it 's one of my favourite parts of the job . 
  we would use the thesaurus , rhyming dictionary and books of idioms / sayings to help us . 
  for my personal projects , i use a similar process but generally try not to go as broad . 
  eg ; my latest project is ** black irish : ** a historical drama set in ww2 about a black ops squad of irish anarchists fighting fascism for the allies . 
  black irish is a common enough phrase and it works for the project as the eponymous irish are black as in black ops , black as in anarchists and their leader is named jimmy black . 
  before that , i had a short film called ** kill me now ** about an alcoholic physics genius who faces down a smarter but sinister version of herself from another reality . 
  again , its a common phrase with specific connotations for the script in that no matter what happens , at least one version of this character will have to die - likely at the hands of the other . 
  i do n't know if either of those are necessarily good titles , but that 's generally how i approach it . 
  arguably , it 's something that is n't super important at the script stage . 
  titles change all the way up to release ( and sometimes beyond ! ), 
  i would n't spend a lot of time worrying about it at this stage if the script is n't done yet . 
  something might jump out at you as you 're writing it . 
  while i was developing / researching black irish it did n't have a title and i jokingly referred to it as the wind that shakes the inglorious basterds ( after the two movies that inspired it ) . 
  then during my research i read about [ captain jack white ] ( http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/ws/ws50_jack.html ) and he became the inspiration for my main character . 
  i named my character jimmy black as a nod to capt. 
  white and suddenly it clicked - black irish !, 
  if/when you start sending it out to agents / competitions / whatever obviously you will need a title but even then it can be something temporary . 
  my only other advice would be to keep it as short and punchy as you can - a long clunky title will potentially prejudice a reader against what they assume will be a long and clunky script . 
  good luck !, 
  running it through some decent screenwriting software like final draft or celtx or something will help . 
  the lack of white space between action and character lines is one of the biggest obstacles at the moment , but that 's an easy fix . 
  other things to consider :, 
  lose all the fade in : and cut to : lines . 
  some people may disagree , but i find these to be completely unnecessary 99 % of the time . 
  they have their uses but in my opinion are n't needed to signify every single scene change . 
  if you must keep them , they are traditionally right-aligned on the page . 
  lose the act one / act two lines . 
  these are n't part of standard screen formatting . 
  break up any long paragraphs of action in to paragraphs and try to keep them to 4 lines max . 
  feel free to use caps * italics * ** bold ** - hyphens - and any combination thereof to make your action as dynamic and exciting to read as possible . 
  do n't overuse ( parentheses ) before dialog . 
  if it 's action , then report it as action before the dialog . 
  be wary of using parentheses as prescriptive performance notes . 
  give the director and performer some room to do their jobs . 
  report action in the simple present tense where possible ( i think this was mentioned before ) keep sentences short and to the point . 
  describe only what will happen on screen . 
  characters feelings and motivations must be portrayed through action . 
  avoid scenes of characters sitting and talking . 
  i know it gets a bit silly sometimes , but there 's a reason game of thrones ( and to an extent rome ) uses sex scenes to offload reams of exposition . 
  make sure your characters are doing something whenever possible . 
  although your time-frame and characters are different than hbo 's rome , people are inevitably going to draw comparisons . 
  it 's been a while since i watched it but from what i remember that show was very well written . 
  have a think about what separates your show from rome ( and for that matter spartacus ) in terms of story and tone . 
  it wo n't take much to get this in to a state where we can read it properly and assess the story and characters on their own merits - keep going !, 
  you can have as much action as you want if you keep your action paragraphs short and punchy . 
  why not break it up with a line or two of dialog here and there ? 
  let the roman officer shout charge !, 
  or something and give the actor full sag rate , 
  a human stampede in phnom penh that caused more deaths in cambodia than any single event since the fall of the khmer rouge . 
  on mobile right now but will dig up a link later if people are interested . 
  yup that 's it ... 
  we were in the city centre the night before and things were ** very ** crowded . 
  it took us an hour to walk a couple of blocks , you could hardly move for all the people .
