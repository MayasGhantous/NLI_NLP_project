  do their kids deserve to be shelled ? 
  the pira had a lot of civilian support for much of the troubles - ever seen the [ photos of bobby sands ' funeral ] ( http://www.irishhungerstrike.com/images/bsfuneral2.jpg ) ? 
   their respective capabilities do n't compare . 
  the ira and their allies inflicted [ over 1000 military casualties ] ( http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/tables/status_summary.html ) on the british during the troubles . 
  additionally , [ nearly 1300 protestant civilians were killed . 
  ] ( http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/tables/religion.html ), 
  conversely , [ according to b'tselem ] ( http://www.btselem.org/statistics ) , between the start of the second intifada and operation cast lead ( 2008 ) , 731 israeli civilians and 332 members of the israeli security services were killed . 
  [ operation cast lead ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaza_war ) resulted in the death of 10 israeli soldiers ( 4 by friendly fire ) and 3 israeli civilians . 
  obviously the ira campaign went on much longer , but it 's unrealistic to say that they were n't willing to / capable of killing large numbers of british civilians and military personnel . 
  i would argue that when the british were faced with these high numbers of casualties , they responded in a ( still flawed but ) much more restrained fashion than israel responded to the attacks during the 2nd intifada / gaza war . 
  again i must reiterate that * the use of heavy munitions on areas that are likely to be occupied by large numbers of civilians is a fucking war crime . 
  * and this is something that the british never did during the troubles . 
   also you did n't answer my question about what would britain , or the usa or any other country would do in a similar situation . 
  as outlined above , the british were faced with similar levels of military and civilian casualties in northern ireland and managed to restrain themselves from turning west belfast or south armagh in to smouldering hellscapes . 
  as a result , their military casualties are disproportionately higher than israel 's . 
  they put soldiers in harms way to get the job done more often than not rather than just shelling a densely populated city . 
  how the u.s. reacts to serious terrorist attacks on their own soil is well documented and the legality/morality/success of the afghanistan and iraq wars is a long and complicated debate , but far from a one sided one as you suggest . 
  when the americans and their allies were faced with an [ entrenched irregular force that they could n't budge ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ccaqfjaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fsecond_battle_of_fallujah&amp;ei=tevru4ttkq6y7abfr4hadq&amp;usg=afqjcnep2hvd38wnq6kekbp1opbgunbp1a&amp;sig2=ccc5kvrht_tdlb9detajlq&amp;bvm=bv.71667212,d.zgu ) in the iraqi city of falluja , they sorounded it , bombarded it , invaded it , killed around 800 civilians ( luckily most of the 30,000 residents had fled ) and [ probably committed a bunch of war crimes . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fallujah,_the_hidden_massacre ), 
  there are also a couple of clothing stalls in st george 's market with original designs and some geeky references . 
  holywood : one `` l '' of a town . 
  the situations are different , as i stated above . 
  my argument is essentially this :, 
  1 ) the indiscriminate use of heavy munitions in built up areas with high civilian populations is wrong no matter what and should be investigated . 
  2 ) i do n't necessarily subscribe to the idea that any other country would do the same in israel 's position and i think there is evidence to support my claim in how the british armed forces conducted themselves in northern ireland . 
  as i outlined in great detail [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/2bkqnl/ireland_abstains_from_un_vote_to_set_up_human/cj6o3wq ) , british military and civilian casualties in northern ireland were far greater than israel 's during the second intifada and gaza war , so describing the troubles as a `` low-level insurgency '' in comparison does n't quite ring true . 
  additionally , there were many areas in northern ireland where administrative control by the uk government was at best patchy and often non-existent . 
  when the government lost control of large areas to republicans , the [ army launched their largest ground operation since suez ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_motorman ) instead of just bombing the shit out of the areas they had lost control of . 
  bear in mind that the ira had , just 10 days before , [ detonated 26 bombs in belfast over the course of a single day ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bloody_friday_\\ ( 1972 \\ ) ) - i suspect that an israeli reaction to 26 bombs going off in ( say ) jerusalem would be quite different ... 
  as you say , there are parallels that can be drawn - that 's all i 'm doing . 
  i 'm not saying that both situations are the same , but i am saying that other governments have handled * similar * situations in different ways which have resulted in far fewer civilian deaths . 
  as a result , i strongly feel that what israel is doing in gaza amounts to a war crime . 
  rocket fire in to israel from gaza is relatively ineffective these days thanks to [ the iron dome ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_dome ) . 
  the ira killed far more british troops and civilians than hamas have israelis - they just used different weapons . 
  tesco ( biggest retailer in the uk ) sell reflective trouser clips for like # 1.50 - uncool as hell but cheap and practical - i love em !, 
   you ca n't compare the daily bombardment of a civilian population with sporadic bombings and gun attacks against mostly security forces . 
  the families of the [ 1784 civilians killed during the troubles ] ( http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/tables/status.html ) might disagree with you there ... 
  although the attacks were lower in frequency , they resulted in much higher casualties , but despite this the british never retaliated with heavy weaponry - even going so far as to reverse and cover the guns on their tanks with tarpaulins when using them to clear barricades . 
   ira members could be arrested , put on trial and imprisoned , israel has had no such recourse ... 
  to a degree , yes - but the extensive use of internment , [ diplock courts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diplock_courts ) and the continuing controversy over so-called `` on the runs '' show us that the justice system in ni was stretched to breaking point . 
  if isreali 's are unable to arrest and imprison palestinians , i ca n't help but wonder how [ 4700 of them ended up in isreali prisons ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palestinian_prisoners_in_israel ), 
   the comparison holds very little water in my view, 
  i 'm not trying to make any kind of direct or over-arching comparison between the two conflicts , i 'm just saying that the british conducted certain specific operations ( like motorman ) in a very different and arguably more humane way than the idf tend to conduct themselves . 
  incidentally , it does n't matter how many rockets hamas fires in to israel - that does n't give the idf an excuse to bomb civilians . 
  ever . 
  by deploying 20,000 troops ( mostly in belfast and derry ) to clear the no-go areas during motorman , the ira were forced to withdraw and a bloodbath was avoided ( that day ) . 
  interestingly , israel deployed roughly the same number of troops to gaza during operation cast lead ( 22,000 ) to try and subdue a much larger and much more densely populated area when the idf has over 170,000 active personnel !, 
  this is the part that really gets me - they have the man-power to go house to house and destroy all the rockets they find but instead they bomb and shell the place to rubble . 
  it 's probably pointless to argue the the semantics of either conflict , but, 
  ultimately , soldiers should be put in harms way before civilians on * any * side . 
  israel consistently puts palestinian civilians in harms way instead of its own troops and the british , for the most part , did the opposite . 
  that 's fair - nice to have an informed chat anyway !, 
  hey !, 
  i know we already agreed to disagree on this but i came across an interesting article on [ the nation ] ( http://m.thenation.com/article/180783-five-israeli-talking-points-gaza-debunked ) , which led me to a very interesting advisory opinion from the international court of justice dating back to 2004 . 
  basically , the opinion of the court is that israel is * not * under attack by a foreign power ( as you imply in your dundalk / newry analogy ) but rather from an area on which they ostensibly exercise control ( as in my free derry / operation motorman analogy ) . 
  as such , article 51 ( the right to self defence ) * does not apply * and the well-being and rights of the civilians in gaza ( and the west bank ) are ultimately israel 's responsibility . 
  so it 's fair to say that the uk recognised these elements of international law as they applied to the situation in northern ireland and acted accordingly , where-as israel does not recognise them as applying to the palestinian territories ( the opinion was specifically about the building of the gaza wall , which they obviously went ahead and built anyway ... ), 
  so you may feel that israel is right to ignore the opinion of the icj but i just wanted to point out that my opinion on the matter is shared by some fairly prominent experts on international law , 
  relevant quote from the opinion :, 
   article 51 of the charter , the court notes , recognizes the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one state against another state . 
  however , israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign state . 
  the court also notes that israel exercises control in the occupied palestinian territory and that , as israel itself states , the threat which it regards as justifying the construction of the wall originates within , and not outside , that territory . 
  the situation is thus different from that contemplated by security council resolutions 1368 ( 2001 ) and 1373 ( 2001 ) , and therefore israel could not in any event invoke those, 
  resolutions in support of its claim to be exercising a right of self-defence . 
  consequently , the court concludes that article 51 of the charter has no relevance in this case .

  all the advice here so far is good but why not come over to / r/screenwriting if you want to find out more !, 
  for a car to pass you safely on a single carriageway they need to see you , slow down , decide whether it is safe to pass you then mirror , signal , shift etc to make that happen . 
  if you are travelling against them in traffic , the time available to do that will be greatly diminished because you ( the cyclist ) will be travelling at ( say ) 15 - 20 mph towards the oncoming vehicle . 
  whereas if you 're travelling away from the approaching vehicle at the same speed ( assuming they are travelling at 30 - 40 mph before they spot the cyclist ) they will have far more time to negotiate a safe overtaking manoeuvre . 
  the dealbreaker is though , that there are some points on many roads ** where it is not safe for a car to pass a bicycle ** . 
  if the bicycle is travelling in the same direction as the car , the car must simply drop their speed to that of the bicycle and wait behind them until it is safe to pass . 
  if they 're travelling in opposite directions , that simply is n't possible and you end up with ( best case ) a mexican stand-off or ( worst ) a head on collision which is not going to work out well for the cyclist ... 
  cycling in traffic is already scary enough as it is ( at times ) without riding head on in to oncoming traffic .
