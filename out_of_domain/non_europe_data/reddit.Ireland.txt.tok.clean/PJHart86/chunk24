  the first lesson is n't `` make your villain polite '' it 's `` defy character type '' . 
  subverting stereotypes is a good way to make characters more interesting . 
  a polite , charismatic ss officer is more interesting than a dark , evil one . 
  when coupled with the `` reverse save the cat '' , this is actually a good system for creating interesting antagonists . 
  landa is n't interesting because he 's a jew-killing nazi . 
  we still know what landa is about if he storms in , goes straight to the trap door and chucks a grenade down but it 's the sadistic way the scene with the farmer unfolds that makes him interesting . 
  it 's worth marking that moment in your script the same way you would mark a `` save the cat '' moment . 
  if he had done the trapdoor / grenade thing , it would still work as a `` reverse save the cat '' but instead we would have a ruthless , efficient landa rather than an intelligent , sadistic one . 
  i do n't think the article expresses the `` impending doom '' thing very well at all . 
  it 's really the more tension you can build and sustain in a scene , the longer it can go on . 
  this is a good rule of thumb that 's worth keeping in mind when you start to see your scenes stretch over ( say ) two pages . 
  use dark humour , dramatic irony and write good dialogue are all bullshit pieces of advice . 
  dark humour and dramatic irony ca n't just be inserted willy-nilly in to any story or script and neither can tarintinoesque stylized dialogue so i agree with you there . 
  if your company does n't have a track record then you 'll need an agent for sure - you 'll be trading off the strength of the idea ( which is an agents area of expertise ) rather than your track record ( which is how a lot of companies get commissions ) . 
  maybe we irish and you mexicans should join up and show those pesky north americans what for !, 
  [ oh wait ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_patrick's_battalion ), 
  holy shit , the politicians in canada must be complete scumbags if someone from * northern ireland * finds them unpalatable !, 
  ** edit : ** i too am from ni . 
  i smell a sitcom ... 
  yes but if he keeps his british passport / citizenship and then they leave the eu he will lose the option to move and work freely in other parts of europe . 
  i 'll just throw my compass away , since reading it is apparently too controversial , 
  yeah basically this . 
  a lot of what people are saying on here about sinn fein makes a lot of sense and it 's great to see people casting their votes based on a party 's actual policies rather than their tribal affiliation but that said ... 
  i was raised catholic and i identify culturally as irish but i ca n't bring myself to vote for any party that goes out of their way to alienate people from the other side . 
  naming parks after hunger strikers and holding parades that celebrate republican violence are extremely counter-productive actions that damage community relations and will seem more legitimate the more people vote for them . 
  although sinn fein 's stance on welfare issues across the whole island is admirable , it has put the executive in a position where we now face financial penalties from westminster because sinn fein have blocked uk-wide welfare reform in ni . 
  while we are still part of the uk , issues like this are best dealt with at westminister - and we all know sinn fein 's position there ... 
  for me , healing the rift between the two communities here and combating bigotry in all its forms are still the most important issues that need to be dealt with by local politicians and that 's why i will always vote alliance , green party , pbp , etc before any of the traditional parties .

  seems legit ... 
  you really could n't make this shit up :, 
   an assembly taskforce set up to look at a more worthy alternative to petitions of concern had to admit defeat because there was no consensus . 
  the dup 's gregory campbell accused alliance 's trevor lunn of bringing the assembly into disrepute in claiming the committee meetings looking at an alternative had lasted just 20 minutes . 
  `` they lasted at least 25 minutes , '' he insisted . 
  it 's like a scene from the thick of it !, 
  there 's something really chilling about how child-like it is . 
  do you happen to know if the threat was carried out ? 
  sounds like an interesting line of research ... 
  i wonder how many people in the unionist / loyalist communities in the north ended up here as a result of letters like this ... 
  yeah ... seems quite short sited on the part of the ira - what 's the point of moving loyalists from one part of ireland to another if their goal was to liberate the whole island ? 
  the ira , a great bunch of lads ... 
  google thinks it 's some chic called paige white ( and that she 's large ) . 
  looks like a bbc office ? 
  `` inspired '' . 
  have you considered shouting out for a professional script reader ? 
  good writers do n't always make good readers ( and vice versa ), 
   if he 's scheduling a day that 's nothing but filming at a house or on a set of a house , he does n't need separate sluglines for living room and dining room and kitchen . 
  it 's just extra words on the call sheet and schedule . 
  uh ... what ? 
  of course the first needs to know what rooms the scenes are being shot in !, 
  moving from the kitchen to the living room takes time , even on a studio set - the art department need to know which rooms need to be dressed and when ... every letter and number on a callsheet is there for a reason . 
  as a script editor who has managed tv scripts from storylines to production wrap , my advice to / u/captain _ bagadouche is to write this scene ( or scenes ) in a way that best flows on the page and let a poor sap like me worry about whether it 's two scenes or one once it gets to production . 
  if , by keeping it as one scene , it becomes a bloated 4 pager then cut it in to two - but if the action plays contiuously ( ie there is no noticeable jump in time between steve telling maria to wise up and maria catching up with peter ) then play it as one scene , as it will likely read as one scene to the audience . 
  if this is the case you should treat it as one scene when you come to look at how your story is paced . 
   keep it as simple as possible while still being clear and communicative . 
  this . 
   it 's not like ... the thing is reformatted before it goes into production . 
   aside from polishing , nothing major is changed . 
  i do n't want to be a dick here , but what is your experience of taking a script from development in to production ? 
  scripts are rewritten and reformatted for production right up until the shoot wraps . 
  on my last job i issued something like 80 pages of script amendments * during the shoot * of a 6x30min series . 
  i also spent about 2 - 3 hours reformatting each script in to our house style before i issued them as shooting scripts . 
  you 're right to tell / u/captain _ bagadouche not to sweat it , but the reason is because a script editor will fix it anyway without even telling him if it ever gets to production . 
   as a rule you just be clear and communicative . 
  but keep it as simple as possible . 
  yes of course , this is the main consideration especially where op is concerned . 
  it 's just the suggestion that a 1st ad does n't need to know which room a scene is filming in , or that this information is somehow incidental , makes my brain itchy - this information is vital in terms of which cast are needed when , which rooms need to be dressed and when , how many background artists are needed for each room , how long each room is likely to take to film in etc. 
  in extended sequences that are written as one scene but cover more than one location , the 1st ad will break these sequences down and separate them in to `` parts '' and they will appear on the callsheet as :, 
  sc11 pt1 - donna 's office, 
  so even if there 's no obvious way to split the action in to multiple scenes on the page , the action will still be split up that way for purposes of scheduling . 
  even if it 's one continuous shot from the office to the hallway , both should still appear on the schedule as the art department need to know to dress the hallway , the ads need to factor in background , which in turn has an effect on make-up and costume departments ... it 's all vital information . 
  the idea that there 's * anything * on a script that the 1st ad `` does n't need to know '' is verging on sacrilege . 
  sure , but my point was that the scene heading could easily be inserted or removed by a script editor during development , then inserted again during pre-production , then removed again at the request of the 1st ad during scheduling because he wants to schedule it all as one scene - that 's why i think op should just write it the way that suits the narrative . 
  if it feels like two separate pieces of action , write it as such . 
  if it feels like one scene , write it as one scene . 
  mini-slugs are useful when there 's a lot of action going on in different areas of the one location but may be overkill in this instance - i find that they interrupt the flow of a scene when i 'm reading so would only use them myself when absolutely necessary . 
  we 're not agreeing ( though i 'm not downvoting you ) on the issue of separate scene headings for action that takes place in separate rooms of a house and , looking at the rest of the thread , i 'm not the only one . 
   if [ the 1st ad is ] scheduling a day that 's nothing but filming at a house or on a set of a house , he does n't need separate sluglines, 
  the above quote is where i ( and others it would seem ) take exception . 
  he ( or she ) absolutely needs separate scene headings in order to effectively communicate the shooting requirements for that day to the other departments .
