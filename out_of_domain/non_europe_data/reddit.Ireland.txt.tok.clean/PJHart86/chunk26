  to be fair , everyone in the first two movies is ( assumedly ) clad in underwear . 
  i would love to see that too , but not sure if a feature film is the right medium . 
  there 's some interesting world building done in the comics but they have n't exactly aged well ... 
  i think a modern adult tv drama series set in the alien universe could be the answer . 
  the kid looks like he 's having a bit of craic messing around under the hood of his car at least , but when he throws the salute at the end of the ad he looks dead inside ...

  wow i really did n't know that but i 'm from northern ireland so i know a thing or two about complicated national identity myself ...

  stunning work .

  your best bet is to get your agent to heavily shop the rights to your books to the studios .

  none of those characters are comedy protagonists , which is the genre op writes . 
  so he 's looking for advice on making `` everyman '' characters more relateable . 
  iirc theres a terminal message nearby to the effect of `` saw the androids hanging round some magazines earlier . 
  sup with that ? '', 
  this version is the first i ever heard , i still think it 's terrific .

  final draft 7 was always rock solid for me but then they changed their default file extension and sharing scripts around became a pain in the ass . 
  final draft seems ludicrously over-priced for what most people use it for , so when it craps out on them they get justifiably upset . 
  most people do n't use the production tools , which allow you to generate industry standard reports and more importantly manage a locked shooting script in an industry standard way . 
  uk script editor here . 
  on my last shoot we used white , pink , blue , yellow , green goldenrod , buff , salmon , cherry , tan , then second white ... 
  just the pink and blue reversed basically . 
  basically once a script is `` locked '' for production , the page numbers can not be changed . 
  this is so that an entirely new script does n't have to be issued to 100 + people every time the director/producer/suits decide on a change or if a change is necessary due to unforeseen shooting circumstances . 
  so let 's say we delete scene 6 from our locked script . 
  the scene starts on page 5\u00a04/8 and ends on page 7\u00a02/8 . 
  page 5 will now be page 5 - 6 and the top 2/8ths of page 7 are now blank . 
  the crew will be issued a set of amendments which will include a new page 5-6 and a new page 7 . 
  the amends coversheet will detail these changes and , if its the first change to the script , these new pages and the coversheet will ( usually ) be blue . 
  that way if you 're script is white and your buddy 's has some blue pages ( and a blue coversheet ) you know you 've missed a set of amends . 
  you then phone me up looking for your amends and i shout at the production secretary for not giving them to you . 
  same goes if you have blue pages but your buddy has pink , etc , etc , etc. . . 
  now later on if they decide to put a new scene in between scenes 5 and 7 , with completely different action and characters to the old scene 6 , it get 's even more tricky ... 
  page 5-6 stays as is and a new page , 5-6a is created , and a new scene , 5a , begins at the top . 
  let 's say this scene runs for 1\u00a03/8 , the next page will be 5-6b , but the bottom 5/8ths will be blank . 
  scene 7 will begin on the 3rd 8th of page 7 as before . 
  easy !, 
  that 's nothing compared to [ this beauty ] ( http://nigreenways.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/spiderweb.jpg?w=788 ) on my commute in to town . 
  dude you just have to cycle on the road . 
  a bicycle is a vehicle and the same rules of the road apply to you as apply to cars so you should n't be riding on sidewalks or continuing straight across an intersection from a right turn only lane anyway . 
  if you 're concerned about safety on this route then wear a helmet , use lights and hi-viz clothing to make yourself visible but most importantly ** ride safely and responsibly ** . 
  do n't filter between lanes , do n't skip red lights . 
  always look over your shoulder twice before you move out or in ... keep your wits about you and you should be fine . 
  however if you feel that the road around you is simply too dangerous to cycle on no matter what then * do n't cycle on it * . 
  ( ** disclaimer ** : * i do n't wear a helmet on my commute , i filter all the time and i 've even been known to skip the odd red light but i know my commute very well and make a judgement call every time as to whether or not it is safe to do these things * ), 
   how much would fixing this little spot cost ? 
  official response from drd :, 
   too fucking much . 
  coming from someone who knows me so well , that hurts a lot :(, 
  well now you know me :d, 
  i recommended that op wear a helmet if he feels unsafe on the road . 
  where i come from , it is n't a legal requirement and on most short trips ( ie ; my commute ) i chose not to . 
  there 's so much conflicting research out there there 's no point getting in to the statistics of how effective helmets are , whether or not they influence rider and driver behavior ... either way my original advice stands : if you feel unsafe on the road , wear a helmet . 
  there are a lot of good pics of the kit in the colonial marine technical manual , which can be `` found '' quite easily online ...

  ska 'd for life - horace panter ( the specials ),

  i just hope my pro12 hangover lifts before this game kicks off ... 
  owens wouldnt have awarded that try . 
  cant believe they arent laying in to the ref on rte, 
  interesting analysis of the try tho, 
  who is this mad old bastard ? 
  i got ta start watching more rugby on rte, 
  having all blacks flashbacks here ... 
  if qc had started we 'd be losing, 
  murray is a warrior, 
  we 're fucked . 
  phew, 
  i am 90 % sure i watched a digital copy of this movie ... let me dig through my back up drives and see if i have it . 
  hey man , turns out i did n't have the video - just the soundtrack . 
  the only torrent i can get is like 4.25 gigs but i 'll grab it here anyway and try and convert it to something that i can send you . 
  peace !, 
  what the fuck ? 
  a reasonable compromise in northern ireland politics ? 
  have i stumbled through a dimensional rift or something ? 
   i might even try to appeal to the bbc to get a proper release of this as well . 
  having had extensive dealings with bbc i&a i would n't get your hopes up about that .
