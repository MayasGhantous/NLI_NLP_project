  largest biggest title fail ... 
  2nd only to aliens , 
  looking at their data , i think they mean english towns , not uk towns . 
  having visited the likes of brisbane where it is compulsory ... it does n't . 
  [ relevant . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p87ds3ay4w ), 
  derry translation : shayne yer shoose hi ? 
  yer ma something something ... sausage . 
  [ yup , good times ... ] ( http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch86.htm#may ), 
  yup this is about sending the dup a message more than anything else . 
  they are n't exactly known for their firm grasp on reality ... 
  my writing partner is a big advocate of the `` puke draft '' - even when you get `` stuck '' you just keep writing , even if it 's the shittest or most short-handed solution . 
  then once you have a completed draft you can put it on a shelf for a while and come back with fresh eyes and/or send it to a mate/script reader / your mum and begin to work on a new draft from there . 
  ps : i am a uk based script reader & editor . 
  pm me if you want to talk specifics on any of your projects . 
  my raceblades have really been put through their paces this autumn / winter - would defo recommend . 
  this seems like a good time to remind everyone that [ ian paisley ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ian_paisley ) existed :, 
  on line dancing :, 
   `` line dancing is as sinful as any other type of dancing , with its sexual gestures and touching . 
  it is an incitement to lust . '', 
  to pope john paul ii :, 
   `` i denounce you , anti-christ !, 
  i refuse you as christ 's enemy and antichrist with all your false doctrine . '', 
  on the queen mother :, 
   `` her visit to the vatican was spiritual fornication and adultery with the antichrist . '', 
  on the european union :, 
   `` a beast ridden by the harlot catholic church . '', 
  and that old chestnut ... 
  `` [ catholics ] breed like rabbits and multiply like vermin '', 
  nice guy ... 
  it 's even a crc brand bike ... 
  this is me . 
  i imagine it 's due to the sheer volume of media i consume . 
  books , comics , films , tv , websites ... there is n't room for everything up there !, 
  they are if you google it in ni ... 
  / r/irishsuccess, 
  never heard of him because i assumed that someone named rex ingram would be a whiskey swilling private dick with nothing to lose , last seen murdering the bear that killed his wife and kids armed only with a single wooden chopstick and a decongestant nasal spray . 
  [ shh .

  [ well ... ] ( http://youtu.be/psrildgcw64?t=4s ), 
  i would have preferred the shotgun from the movie rather than the crappy avp game remake . 
  this is the album they were touring when i saw them live - good times , 
  `` do n't worry lads , everything is going to be fine from here on in ... '', 
  how old is the bike ? 
  the drive train ( ie the front and back cogs + the chain ) may be worn . 
  pics might be useful, 
  there 's also lee 's at the bottom of donegall pass . 
  lagan behind, 
  tonight on sinjar ( push ) i 'm playing support - i 've only played a few rounds with the m249 so my score is pretty average . 
  the whole team bites it when we 're trying to take charlie and i 'm lms . 
  i sprint in to the objective room and no scope two guys straight away . 
  i hit the deck and set up the bipod as the blue line slowly fills the objective marker . 
  it 's maybe 2/3rds there when i hear them coming - 5 or 6 guys charge straight in to the room and i go * bananas * on the trigger - and they ** all ** go down !, 
  just as the objective is taken another couple of guys run in and i go to let them have it but i 'm bingo on ammo !, 
  * the only time i 've ever ran out with the 249 * . 
  i 'm not rocking a sidearm so , before the guys clock me lying in the corner i take out my knife and sprint from the room - i make it out of the building and back towards the last objective - most of my newly respawned team mates are moving back up and i ca n't believe i made it out of there . 
  one of my teammates sees me sprinting towards him and double taps me . 
  i go down . 
  war is hell . 
  what a farset . 
  shut up larry . 
  why not go down under the posts ? 
  it 's my name . 
  haha true enough !, 
  i was thinking more as an extra `` fuck you '' but in a quick turnover like that all you think about is the line i guess ... 
  the history of my town is [ more like an fps ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles ) than an rpg but in the interest of the game ... 
  * they say that [ thomas andrews ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thomas_andrews_\\ ( shipbuilder \\ ) ) had a secret safe buried in the old shipyard , but [ of course he never came home ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sinking_of_the_rms_titanic ) to open it ... *, 
  i 'm not worried , london irish was so subtle and nuanced after-all ... 
  a uk vpn will get you access to our tv catch up services like bbc iplayer , itvplayer , 4od etc. 
  4od in particular is good for watching whole series but it does have ads . 
  i doubt the room would have been packed with people if he 'd said `` when '' instead of `` if '' ... 
  this is / r/britishproblems not / r/britishsolutions !, 
  haha me either . 
  totally worth it for that one sherlock spoiler thread though . 
  he 's rich enough to not give a fuck probably . 
  [ here are those rules and regulations they 're going on about . 
  ] ( http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/ira/ira_green_book.htm ), 
  nice to see a bit of support for the brain injury rehabilitation trust . 
  ellen page for first minister !, 
  i agree - the story is interesting but starting any headline with the phrase nazi cow is tabloid bullshit of the highest order . 
  i 'm criticising the paper , not the journalist . 
  i get why her mouth needs to be open for a dentistry game ( a princess dentistry game ? 
  why not ... ) but why do her eyes need to be so evil ... 
  dude that sucks . 
  mine was nicked over the weekend as well but the cops found it about 36 hours after i reported it missing so make sure you report it stolen if you have n't already . 
  they said they found some helmets with it so they 're going to run dna . 
  it 's a long shot but they might actually catch the pricks . 
  what part of town are you in ? 
  could have been the same guys ... 
  edit : i see from your flair that you are malone road so probably not the same culprits but hope you get it back !, 
  fair enough . 
  the article is n't catastrophic but the headline is close . 
  if you give it less than three stars it devours your children . 
  glad to hear it !, 
  there 's only so much you can do to keep it safe if you do n't have a garage but if you can lock it to something ( rather than just locking the wheel/steering ) that helps and i read somewhere that a cover actually deters thieves as well . 
  hope they did n't fuck it up too bad on you !, 
  the first time mine was nicked ( bout 6 months ago ) it was found in west belfast too . 
  aul westies love a rake on a chopper it seems . 
  [ since nobody else posted it ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjl6emzdnvc ), 
  i was thinking of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjl6emzdnvc ),
