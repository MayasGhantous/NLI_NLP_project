  scotland became part of the united kingdom ( not the empire ) after the passing of the act of union in 1707 . 
  it was already part of the island of britain geographically . 
  no the united kingdom itself is/was ruled differently than the empire . 
  when the union was formed , scottish mps joined the parliament at westminster and this parliament was then responsible for ruling the whole island . 
  so scotland was represented in parliament but the various colonies , protectorates , mandates , etc that made up the empire were not . 
  this was one of the big reasons behind the american revolution - parliament were able to levy taxes on the colonies but the colonies were unrepresented in parliament - unlike scotland . 
  so technically speaking scotland was not part of the empire , as you suggest . 
  scotland got itself in to financial trouble with the darien scheme after the english moved to crown sophia of hanover queen of scotland and england . 
  the scots wanted someone closer to the main stuart line but they were all a bit catholic for england 's liking . 
  the resulting tit-for-tat trade war ended with the negotiations for an act of union . 
  every year we have controversial parades commemorating a battle from 1690 and there are always riots etc , that 's what i 'm getting at . 
  nice ... willful misunderstanding of the words `` britain '' fact '' and `` empire '' . 
  9/10 would troll with again . 
   yeah , it 's the parades with the orange order , is n't it ? 
  and something about a parade commission and marching in areas that do n't want them to march there ? 
  that 's about the height of it . 
   course , my grandmother wanted me to take part in the re-enactments here ... i told her that i 'd only take part in the union side ... she was ... less than pleased and stopped suggesting it . 
  maybe you can compromise : you be a union soldier but you let the confederates shoot you up a bit ? 
  so your granny was trying to get you to crossplay a confederate soldier ? 
  she really must have hated them yankees ... 
  lol was it past your bed time when i replied last night ? 
  i already explained it to you above , go google it yourself if you do n't believe me or better still , post a source that proves scotland is part of the british empire . 
  oh i see , we 're arguing the semantics of whether or not the home countries of the united kingdom were technically part of the `` empire '' or not . 
  well if scotland was part of the empire then so was croydon and your educating scotland link does n't prove anything beyond that . 
  since we 're arguing semantics we might as well consult a dictionary :, 
   ** empire ( n ) **, 
  with the ( and in later use usu . 
  with capital initial ) , used to refer to certain specific empires . 
   ( a ) = holy roman empire n . now hist . 
   ( b ) the british empire ; esp . 
  the british possessions , dominions , and dependencies , ** as opposed to great britain itself ** . 
  now hist . 
   since the statute of westminster ( 1931 ) , the usual term has been commonwealth ( commonwealth n. 4c ) . 
  - oxford english dictionary ( online edition ) copyright \u00a9 2015 oxford university press, 
  also , if scotland was part of the empire then it became part of it in 1603 , when james vi ( king of scotland ) assumed the throne of england as well , not in 1707 . 
  nope , the main reason behind the act of union was a lack of a protestant heir apparent for both the scottish and english crowns . 
  the english parliament passed the act of settlement to crown sophia of hanover but the scots did n't want to abandon the stuart line ( which had been ruling scotland for longer than it had england ) . 
  england used the alien act to squeeze scotland financially and bring them to the negotiating table but money was the means , not the reason . 
  ... and further down there 's a definition that relates specifically to the british empire , which i quoted above . 
  like i said , it 's semantics .

  generally speaking , i would say that the day or night always comes last in a scene heading . 
  transitions may get skimmed , but often so do scene headings ( especially if like 4 or 5 in a row begin int . 
  bob 's ... ), 
  i would write `` 10 months ago '' or `` 1950 '' as the first line of action , personally .

  i grew up in belfast , northern ireland . 
  home of stiff little fingers , good vibration records , etc. . . 
  my first punk gig would have been at a tiny gig all up a flight of stairs down a dark alleyway at a place called giro 's . 
  it was in a rough enough part of town and i remember bringing a hatchet with me to a gig that i was playing because the bands who had played the week before had been beaten and robbed after the show . 
  local bands played shows there and i started going when i was around 14 . 
  the stage was only about a foot off the ground but it never stopped us crowd surfing . 
  it was byo and the taxi depot across the road sold 1 litre bottles of bad english cider for # 1 and half bottles of vodka for a fiver . 
  we would all hang out in the women 's toilets or on the stairs in between acts , drinking , smoking and having the craic . 
  i remember seeing lots of local legends there like mr. nipples , runnin riot ( rip colin ) , pocket billiards , axis of ... but the night capdown came to play in our tiny shithole was truly special . 
  as we grew older we all ended up in bands and played gigs at giro 's and i even volunteered there . 
  as alternative music took another upswing in popularity , the place attracted a younger crowd ( i ca n't complain , i was young when i started going ) but it got a reputation as a den for under-age drinking . 
  money problems and trouble with the cops eventually led to the place being shut down but it lives on in spirit in another venue on the other side of town called the centre . 
  our local community tv channel made a [ documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7r_tjpihhs ) about the place . 
  i 'll always be grateful to those guys for giving us a place to go when we were kids and introducing us to our local scene . 
  when it comes to punk , belfast is a special place . 
  it 's like terri hooley said , `` new york has the hair cuts , london has the trousers but belfast has the reason '' . 
  haha i did have to take out my hatchet that night but i did n't get beaten up or robbed ( no violence - waving it around menacingly did the trick ), 
  i told [ the story of my one and only night volunteering there ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/punk/comments/24ciqn/weirdest_shit_thats_ever_happened_to_you_at_a_show/ch5vdfl ) a while back on this sub , too . 
  there was an excellent film out a couple of years ago called [ good vibrations ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1920945/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) about the early days of the scene here during [ the troubles ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles ) ( long before my time ) well worth `` seeking out '' if you 're interested . 
  thanks for reading ... it was definitely an important part of growing up for me and i like to think going there informed how i turned out as an adult . 
  it certainly is n't common , but the kid is actually [ doing a character .

  maybe it 's funny if you have n't had grinning cunts saying shit like that to your face every time you open your mouth in america or australia . 
  it 's also potentially offensive because he 's from northern ireland so there 's around a 50 % chance that he identifies as british rather than irish - we 're always ragging on american ignorance of other countries and cultures around here ... maybe i should have used a different title .

  good idea . 
  locking doors and deleting internet now . 
  having visited the unit 731 museum in harbin , i can tell you that even it is very heavily politicized . 
  obviously the crimes committed there were beyond horrific ( as seen above ) but it also chilled me to see the tragedies manipulated for political gain . 
  eta but no northern ireland ? 
   ** good points ** : most irish are dead, 
  yeah !, 
  more ireland for the rest of us !,
