  drinkin and fuckin . 
  and being excellent to each other . 
  here is a good plan for northern ireland ( especially if you have a car ), 
  go to a place called draperstown . 
  stock up on camping and/or bbq supplies . 
  go to a pub a few miles outside of town called the shepherd 's rest . 
  they will let you camp there for # 5 a night . 
  the facilities are excellent and it 's everything you expect from a traditional irish pub . 
  sound good ? 
  well the best part is the location . 
  look it up on google maps :, 
  belfast - one hour . 
  derry - one hour . 
  enniskillen - one hour . 
  giant 's causeway - you guessed it ... one hour . 
  sperrin mountains - right on your doorstep !, 
  is n't that the plot to grant morrison 's the invisibles ? 
  [ this ] ( http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/191/1/6/first_tattoo_by_outboundlight.jpg ), 
  bitter is a style of beer rather than a particular brand : you might fin the one you 're after on this list :, 
  tetley 's , john smith and young 's are all popular - but moreso in england that ireland . 
  something like caffrey 's or kilkenny would maybe be comparable . 
  bitters is an alcoholic beverage flavored with herbal essence generally used these days to flavour cocktails :, 
  no problem !, 
  margaret thatcher did n't and then people partied in the streets when she died . 
  just sayin ' ... 
  just remove / r/aww from your feed , the rage will subside . 
  if you want your own place for a reasonable price , steer clear of the student areas around south belfast :, 
  there 's reasonable prices north and east . 
  regarding public transport : get a bike . 
  edit : welcome to belfast !, 
  sort of ... 
  there are a lot more cycle lanes than there used to be and cyclists are allowed to use all bus lanes . 
  belfast is quite hilly though , especially in the north and west . 
  if it was racially motivated than it is in pursuit of `` some goal '' . 
  if you dont wish for their destruction you probably arent out murdering them ... 
  did you seriously just compare the murder of an actual human being to the hunting of animals for sport . . ? 
  if it was racially motivated there was an angle . 
  `` it certainly looks impressive '', 
  pity it 's a game and not a fuckin oil painting then . 
  the guys who killed the soldier only killed once . 
  if they intended a massacre they would n't have used knives . 
  if some kind of white/christian extremist ( eg : edl ) ran over and stabbed a respected member of the muslim community * in the street , then cut off their head and started telling passers by why the did it ... would it get massive media attention ? 
  absolutely !, 
  would it be described as terrorism ? 
  probably not . 
  * it 's difficult to think of a direct comparison here as , like it or not , the british military has been complicit in the deaths of a lot of muslim civilians over the last decade or so . 
  it 's hard to think of a british islamic organisation that is complicit in the death of white/western/british civilians but still commands a similar amount of respect as the british army . 
  look at it this way :,

  sorry to hear that . 
  i would go to the post office and check out the parcel force rates first . 
  as for the pub - if you never made it to the crown because it 's too touristy or whatever , it 's definitely worth at least one pint . 
  same goes for white 's tavern . 
  if it was me leaving , i would probably go somewhere saltier that i remember from my youth , like mcelhatton 's / the front page or the library bar . 
  hopefully you 'll land on your feet when you get home and you 'll be back to see belfast again soon !,

  shit dude i dont work mondays so i totally forgot . 
  super sorry !, 
  you couldnt buy a 3 story semi for that kind of money in 2007 , nevermind a nightclub . 
  let 's all chip in !, 
  finally , something we northern irish are good at will be of value to the rest of the world !, 
  [ you can order it online here ] ( http://www.theprincessstore.com/ ), 
  brought it where ? 
  tbf translink ( in the north ) are equally shit . 
  belfast metro service is by far the worst offender, 
  [ this has all the info you need ! ], 
  ( http://www.belfasthistory.org/pocket-guide-to-northern-ireland-issued-to-american-troops-stationed-in-northern-ireland-during-the-second-world-war/ ), 
  the ones who are saying that it 's rife with drugs are probably just getting it mixed up with whiteabbey ... 
  well if you 're in whiteabbey you 've over-shot the mouth of the lagan by 6 miles or so so maybe they just did n't want you to get lost ? 
  i think it was a loyalist stronghold back in the day ( could be wrong though ! ), 
  but seems more or less fine now - certainly the cycle path along the shore is safe at any rate !, 
  wtf is this ? 
  it 's amazing !, 
  i remember a question in my practice theory test about what to do when traffic is merging in to your lane and the right answer was `` change lane '', 
  brilliant . 
  i 've been a big fan since the day today - no idea how that passed me by . 
  is that alan tudyk in the thumbnail ? 
  have you considered sending this to http://www.lettersofnote.com/ ? 
  i bought a hard copy of china daily on the day i left china and there was a full page story headlined something like `` are civil servants smoking too much at work ? '', 
  as with this , the fact that the story exists says more than the content of the story ever will ...

  while you 're waiting for the last of us you should play the walking dead . 
  no game has ever effected me the way that one did . 
  the only thing that has really come close is the end of the dark materials trilogy . 
  i 'm glad they have instruments that can tell us when the fallout is `` about '' . 
  long live the queen is an upbeat acoustic-rock / pop song by frank turner about his friend who is slowly dying :, 
  ice hockey is fun but i just do n't feel invested in it . 
  are there even any local lads on the team ? 
  i 've been to a lot of ulster rugby games at ravenhill - i 've never felt in any way threatened and in fact the atmosphere is amazing . 
  the tickets are well priced , the team is competitive and stuffed with local talent - which includes players from the historic counties of ulster who are just as welcome as the rest . 
  i 'd watch them over the giants any day . 
  [ see for yourself  ] ( http://www.ulsterrugby.com/rugby/league_tables.php ), 
  unfortunately leinster beat them in the final ... but still . 
  perhaps i should try a subreddit where people actually know what bebo is ...
