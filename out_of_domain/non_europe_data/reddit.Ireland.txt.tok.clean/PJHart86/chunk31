  i should have something on my home computer , will check for you later . 
  sorry , i must have deleted a lot of old contracts etc when i cleared out my portable hard drive ... some good info on the wggb website though about rates , etc :, 
  even just reading it on a tablet rather than the pc i use to write helps i find . 
  i use the kindle app on a 10 '' transformer tf2 tablet to read scripts . 
  have also used an ipad mini with final draft reader a bit at work , which i like less but still doe the job . 
  northern ireland checking in :, 
  the route used by the [ 2014 giro d'italia stage ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70213000/jpg/_70213352_2a.jpg ) is pretty jaw-dropping . 
  i would recommend going north from belfast on the coastal part of the route , then along the coast to derry and on in to donegal to tackle some of the [ inisihowen 100 ] ( http://www.eastinishowen.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/inishowen1001.gif ), 
  or returning to belfast via the inland route depending on how long you have in ni . 
  one of my favourite cycle-friendly places to stay is [ the shepherds rest ] ( http://www.shepherdsrestpub.com/ ) but may be a bit out of your way and you 'll need your own tent ... 
  ca n't believe i dropped hogg for brown in my fantasy team ... 
  alien strikes back, 
  `` do n't ask me , man . 
  i just work here . '' i use this one a lot ... 
  [ and supplied trucks to the fascists during the spanish civil war ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_involvement_in_the_spanish_civil_war#united_states ), 
  on night shoots this week ... passed a head-on car crash on the way home last night / this morning - first thought was that it was one of our over-tired crew but thankfully it was n't ( and those who were involved were fine ) . 
  stay safe out there everyone . 
  that dude looks like he 'd cut my throat ... 
  i always imagined cmotd as a bit friendlier ... 
  love this one . 
  there are n't too many comics from hobbes ' pov . 
  the guy who said, 
  on the last thread only got 1 point and the post is too old to upvote him :(, 
  i chose to believe that both these products are offered by the same seller ... wee billy 's tazer & coffee emporium . 
  no good deed goes unpunished !, 
  the technical term is [ electronic programme guide ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electronic_program_guide ) ( at least it is here in the uk ) and their purpose is much the same as a log-line ; to sell the content to the audience in one or two snappy sentences . 
  do n't forget about the `` bugstomper - we endanger species '' nose art on the drop ship ... implies at least a few encounters with non-intelligent life . 
  i think that 's the key difference . 
  the execs do n't believe ripley 's story because as far as they 're concerned she 's telling them that a weird species of cow that nobody has ever seen or heard of except her took down an aircraft carrier . 
  mondafuck !, 
  obligatory `` x-post to / r/northernireland because this place is a bit dead '' comment . 
  what are the chances it 'll crop op on / r/firstworldanarchists again now as well ? 
  ireland are going to be on jj like a pigeon on a chip . 
  did n't these used to come free if you spent a certain amount in the store ? 
  mine is long gone :(, 
  lisa : dad , you ca n't judge a place you 've never been to . 
  bart : yeah , that 's what people do in russia . 
  yeah i did n't notice that the first time i read this ... 
  * `` she totally touched my junk ... with her barf . 
  [ the wired ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm2rtobdhrs ) by machinae supremacy is a great song inspired / based on this series . 
  good fucking riddance . 
  i believe he is a giant pineapple - with a rather hefty prostate , too - i understand that his plan is to snort the powdered remains of rare show dogs . 
  this is n't fact , of course . 
  reminds me of [ this great story ] ( http://www.avclub.com/article/john-c-mcginley-on-i42i-oliver-stone-and-missing-t-96763 ) :, 
   the role john c. mcginley ended up playing on scrubs for nine seasons semi-famously called for a `` john c. mcginley type . '' yet , in a surreal turn of events , mcginley had to audition for the role multiple times despite being the world 's foremost john c. mcginley type . 
  * hey , try not to suck any dick on the way through the parking lot !, 
  i have some experience in doing this kind of thing for tv ... 
  i would potentially be interested in contributing articles to flesh out your northern ireland section maybe . 
  i sporadically blog between gigs so you can get a flavour here :, 
  i researched funny local facts and wrote jokes for a `` guess the town '' round on the bbc panel show [ monumental ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03v4b4p ) . 
  the only explanation is that the relative worth of a camcorder caper has dropped by a staggering 46.12 % . 
  thanks youtube . 
  something to keep in mind ( from a previous thread ) :, 
   screenwriting is fucking hard . 
   coming up with the idea and the characters and the world is the fun bit . 
  you 're the designer designing a cool car . 
  you draw the sexy lines , think about the sweet paintjob , imagine the kick-ass sound system ... 
   then you open final draft . 
  suddenly you 're not the designer anymore . 
  you 're the mechanic . 
  you have to figure out how all this shit is supposed to work . 
  by the time you get to page 40 or so your transaxel is connected to your flux capacitor and you have no idea how to fix it . 
   so yeah follow whatever advice on this thread makes sense to you but just remember that there 's no magic bullet here . 
  it sounds like you spend a lot of time developing ideas and not enough time implementing . 
  keep practicing your implementation - do n't give up !, 
  sorry to c&p old advice but i 'm up to my balls in post prod transcripts today ... good luck !, 
  yes , i love getting paid to sit in the periodicals library !, 
  i 'm pretty busy with work right now but let me look through some of my old research next weekend and i 'll hit you with some ideas from there . 
  doubt he even registered sexton 's existence during those tackles . 
  [ wrong way down a one way street ... ] ( http://youtu.be/dpmcd0sbiq0 ), 
  get your green and guinness on , stay off any street with a `` you are now entering loyalist ______ '' mural and you 'll be grand . 
  [ no time for love , doctor jones .

  bear island looks like a teeny tiny northern ireland ... as sometimes shown seperately from the rest of ireland on certain maps . 
  * bear island ... grumpy bastards and scary women . 
  checks out ... *, 
  glad to hear it  any opportunity for a clerks reference in this sub , i 'll be there ... 
  gettin a beer in now . 
  keep er lit lads !, 
  yes !!!, 
  three days later , i had given up hope ... 
  yeah that was a hell of a statement of intent from him . 
  might have gone badly if the support had n't been there though . 
  but then you can say that of any tackle really ... 
  haha no i know i mean i have enjoyed getting paid to do research there previously so it does n't feel like a chore ... 
  nope , that 's just good life advice in general i find . 
  get a motorbike then you can still use the bus lanes - win win !, 
  you know what it 's like , no list of effected services for an hour then 3 show up at once ... 
  gon na ride my bike like fuck all over the bus lanes on friday !, 
  gon na do it anyway and fuck everyone off and/or get wiped out then . 
  [ bbc writers room script library ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/scripts ) is shooting scripts rather than transcripts . 
  mostly tv/radio though . 
  aye , like / u/ctni says most are accessible to bikes . 
  a lot of folk do n't realise they are only operational at certain times as well . 
  sorry to hear about your break dude !, 
  i 'm off work so i probably wont be dancing with too much traffic but yeah ... thanks , stay safe out there !, 
  i like your style ... break one bike , buy two !, 
  what are your needs ?
