  nobody ever gets it ... 
  yeah it was a good script but period drama is hard on a regional budget ... it was written by 3 of the guys from the hole in the wall gang iirc . 
  in my mind he was selling bootleg copies down nutts corner and i wont hear any different from the likes of you . 
  if you 're looking for something a bit deeper than the gits series , serial experiments lain absolutely blew my mind . 
  if you can stretch to # 300 , decathlon do [ an entry level road bike ] ( http://www.decathlon.co.uk/triban-300-road-bike-white-id_8239800.html ) that 's actually not too bad . 
  would do you for some longer runs as well if you decide you like it . 
  having actually lived in china , i can tell you that t 's what 's happening on the ground that 's really cyberpunk - not the sky . 
  this was back in 2010 before i had a smartphone and one of my biggest regrets is not taking more pictures ... 
  i lived in a city called harbin , up near the north eastern border with russia . 
  the mix of old russian and chinese architecture combined with the drab communist utilitarian style gave the place a sort of city 17 vibe . 
  despite being marketed to the rest of china / the world as [ a magical winter wonderland ] ( http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/components/photo/_new/pb-130107-harbin-ice-festival-01.jpg] ( http://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1505857.1382356643!/httpimage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg ) the reality is often [ very different ] ( http://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1505857.1382356643!/httpimage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg ) . 
  in terms of specific cyberpunk experiences , one place that stands out for me is the district around the harbin institute of technology . 
  around the university there were lots of guys selling pirate games and software on the side of the road ( as you see in a lot of asian cities ) but there was also this 10 story mall , with bootleg software and tables full of salvaged pc components in the basement , all the way up to high end canon and sony stores at the top . 
  even many normal malls had a sort of cp vibe to them - they were often underground and stretched for miles , populated more with market stall style stores rather than real shops . 
  neon-lit clubs were full of rich chinese paying a premium to drink with white folk ( we drank free in these places ) while their working class countrymen sat on plastic furniture drinking baiju right across the street . 
  our kitchen / living room was this tiny anachronistic space . 
  2 electric hot plates , a microwave and a kettle were our only cooking equipment . 
  one laptop or another was constantly kludged in to the ancient tv using crap we picked up in the market , and generally sat on the sideboard beside the 2 cassette stereo system , complete with country hits usa double album that was there when we moved in . 
  we used to eat in a little hole in the wall place on the corner near our apartment block ... all the seating was outside , the only rooms inside were the kitchen and the bathroom . 
  the fish that they cooked up fresh were kept alive in a shallow basin beside the hole-in-the-ground toilet . 
  we 'd sit outside this place basking in the glow and listening to the music from the all-night hairdressing place next door , crowding round the 1 iphone we had between 8 of us , trying to figure out how to order something other than fish or chicken wings ... 
  one time i was on a crowded bus on the way back from a suburb i taught in ( the suburb where the infamous unit 731 did their thing during the war ) it was taking forever as usual and i decided to start texting my gf back home in ireland . 
  this massive guy , half a foot taller than me and i 'm 6 `` 2 , got on and stood beside me . 
  i decided to text my gf and tell her about him ( i was bored ) . 
  little did i know that the guy could read english and he saw my text !, 
  he typed a text in english in to his own phone and showed me the screen . 
  we had a good laugh about it and became friends !, 
  sorry it 's all story and no pics ... 
  i have a few on fb but i 'm at work so ca n't really imgur them right now . 
  edit : forgot about the time i saw a guy playing an ngage on the bus . 
  if anybody had any materiel left on the german side you can bet it was the ss . 
  the fact that we 're using the internet ( a lot of us on mobile devices ) to argue about what is and is n't cyberpunk while the world goes to hell around us is pretty cyberpunk ... 
  she just fucking loves risotto . 
  he makes crazy money for vo work and he can do it in his pants if he wants . 
  is this good news or bad news for alliance ? 
  i do n't really understand odds ... 
  also if they lose , at least they can go back to being the rebel alliance ( east belfast brigade ), 
  hey bro , we heard you like armour so we made you some armour for your suit of armour . 
  no mention of flickerpix , the guys who are actually doing the animation ? 
  harsh .

  there was [ a good thread here the other day about the right way to ask for free help ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/filmmakers/comments/31pjcl/how_to_gracefully_ask_your_crew_to_work_for_free/ ) though . 
  much more constructive than this rant ...

  he did !, 
  still got pissed when o'russell just took the idea and did his own thing with it tho ...

  also worth checking out his series * the thick of it *, 
  it 's much more than that - a really well structured comedy of errors and a masterclass in anti-heroism . 
  it 's layered , like some kind of ... shallot ?

  i do n't work in art dept any more ... 
  yeah for sure . 
  i did a few commercials too and had to swap a sofa out right before they started rolling because the client rep did n't like it and of course it completely upset the design of the set . 
  i was working for the same designer on the curtains job and the sofa job . 
  guy was cool as a cucumber both times ; explained his position calmly and complied with the request when he was over-ruled .

  conventional wisdom states that every line of your scene should either be driving the plot , or revealing character or if possible both . 
  if you can convey the theme and drive the plot or convey the theme and reveal character then all the better .

  if even david cameron thinks your policies are too far to the right then you 're basically hitler . 
  yeah , probably a scam for sure ... poor guy maybe has no friends at home to help him out , hence why he 's online dating chinese girls and willing to travel half-way around the world to meet them . 
  what really gets me about this is that the guy is of an age where he probably does n't realise the pitfalls of online dating and is unlikely to know that `` catfishing '' is anything other than hunting literal catfish . 
  he 's been swallowed by a world he does n't fully understand and instead of going home with his tail between his legs he 's doubling down , manually searching for a girl that almost certainly only exists in cyberspace ... 
  i 'm not the first to use it on this sub tho and i doubt i 'll be the last ... 
  if a crowd ad gives you an exasperated sigh when you ask them something then they aint doing their job . 
  great advice above but godamnit focus on the story !, 
  i 've reported on a lot of treatments that spend a lot of time detailing the world , presenting art , expositing the theme , without ever really nailing down a well structured story . 
  it 's impossible for me to recommend these projects as i do n't really know how good the story is , no matter how zingy the logline or good the concept art . 
  i 've heard that too ( here in uk ) but it 's a bit disrespectful imo . 
  wranglers are for animals . . ? 
  no sure , but the original definition of the word relates to someone who handles livestock . 
  i think its one thing to apply it to inanimate objects like c-stands and another to apply it to human beings .
