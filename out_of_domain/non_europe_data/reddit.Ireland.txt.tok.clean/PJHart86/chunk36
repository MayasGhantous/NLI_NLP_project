   so you mean just get rid of gerry kelly ? 
  because he 's the only one i can think of who has shot anybody in the head . 
  oh well , i guess if they only have one candidate who * literally shot somebody in the head * then that 's okay ... 
  i live in north belfast and god damn do i want to see nigel dodds out on his ass but to me a vote for sf ( and a vote for kelly in particular ) seems to condone the violence of the past . 
  perhaps they were thinking about the event ? 
  thramps !, 
  edit : no love for our willie then lol, 
  yeah dont bother with a hybrid . 
  you can get a decent entry level road bike ( triban 520 ) from decathlon for like 420 quid . 
  some mudguards and other kit would round you up to 500 . 
  well those tribans have all the necessary mounting points ... they can even take a front pannier according to the website and they roll out of the showroom on 25mm tyres . 
  fairly relaxed geometry as well as they really are aimed at beginners . 
  did you look at the bike ? 
  relaxed road geometry , 25mm tyres and mounting points for panniers and mud-guards . 
  would depend on how off road i guess ... the 520 can take up to 28mm tyres so there are some options out there for gravel , etc. 
  well it takes up to 28 and still has room for mudguards . 
  i do n't think it 's controversial at all to suggest someone get an entry level road bike for commuting ? 
  that 's really who bikes like this are made for ... 
   no they 're for people `` entering '' the sport of road cycling, 
  you do n't generally need pannier and mudguard mounts for that and there are plenty of cheap road bikes out there that do n't have them . 
  i 'm not saying this bike is for everyone but it 's a great choice at ops price point . 
  to say it is n't a viable commuter is ridiculous , road.cc even awarded the previous model [ best commuter of the year 2014/15 ] ( http://road.cc/content/feature/139087-roadcc-bike-year-201415-framesets-commuting-cyclocross-adventure-budget ) . 
  put fruit in , press the button , smoothie comes out . 
  schemes like [ storyland ] ( http://www.rte.ie/ten/news/2015/0526/703948-sixth-rte-storyland-series-announced/ ) are a good platform for new writing . 
  i have some experience of it but work mostly in the north . 
  yeah there is for sure . 
  ni screen have just anounced a partnership with the bbc to develop more content locally . 
  mini short film funding has 2 intakes every year and the new writing talent feature writing scheme is currently open for submissions . 
  on a more grassroots level there 's film devour , a semi-regular film night that shows content by local creators . 
  local short films have been winning at bafta and oscar level recently . 
  the filmmaking scene here is thriving , albeit moreso in belfast maybe than derry . 
  had issues in north belfast last week and early this week too . 
  yeah i have a lot of characters `` staring daggers '' at and `` sharing looks '' with other characters ... have to mix it up a bit more . 
  my thoughts are that this webpage is not available ... 
  my work internet did n't like it for some reason . 
  working now , thanks !, 
  as a fellow hart , who do you think the best hart is ? 
  bret the hitman ? 
  veronica ? 
  great choice !, 
  north belfast buy & sell is also cracker . 
  how to word this on the production insurance form ... 
  does this guy seriously have [ his own subreddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gallowboob/ ) ? 
  they spelled nat wrong . 
  i sold a short film to a broadcaster this year . 
  i 'll maybe see about # 500 from the deal after music rights and delivery costs . 
  and yet i still do n't believe it ... 
  we do not sow , so we do n't . 
  wise up and go for a pint . 
  ( but also +1 for established cuz it 's awesome ), 
  is def a good shout then the crowd is 50/50 hipster/business . 
  i 'm watching you . 
  you do n't need to be a lawyer to handle clearances but yeah it 's not an issue until you get to production . 
  the only exception might be if your entire premise was built around an ip that is notorously difficult to clear , like the music of led zeppelin . 
  then it might be a tough sell , even at spec stage . 
  i guess we 'll never know ... 
  housing association properties round my way are covered in flags and bunting . 
  they 're just not afraid to ask her to take down a rainbow flag because they know there 's no gay paramilitary group threatening to petrol bomb their offices . 
  well , the relationship between the carrick hill residents and the oo is probably one of the worst in the city . 
  it was their church that the lads were marching in circles playing the famine song in front of . 
  it 's gon na take more than a weirdly worded billboard to get those guys to come round . 
  i think / u/philthy _ mcnasty is close to hitting the nail on the head . 
  there 's obviously an agenda at play beyond `` come learn about history '' . 
  the implication that everyone can only `` share the future '' after they 've learned about ( and by inference accepted ) the agenda of this weird religious brotherhood is slightly unsettling . 
  the message should be `` we want to share our history because learning about history has its own intrinsic value . '', 
  the irony is lost on them . 
  i did end up reworking it a bit but i 'm still not really happy with it . 
  i got a reading from a very senior exec producer during the year and it made me rethink the entire plot of the pilot . 
  i think now the paris story is probably a mid-season ep or even a season finale ( with a bit of punching up ) but the pilot should have a plot that makes it easier to naturally introduce the characters and their world . 
  so i 'm thinking of having the pilot set in ireland . 
  anyway the most up-to-date version of black irish is [ here ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b0hnylvsh7-xnw1jvf9xem5zvvu/view?usp=sharing ) if you 're interested . 
  would love to hear some thoughts !, 
  yup i completely agree . 
  i 'd say if there was a billboard for feile an phobail on sandy row ( or somewhere ) it would n't last too long either . 
  though i do n't know if the orange order themselves are the best people to learn objective history from but there is some value to be had in learning about their point of view , providing it is n't presented as fact . 
  basically that she agreed with the beeb notes ( even after i tried to address them lol ) and when i told her that i was thinking about restaging the pilot in ireland she thought it was maybe a good idea . 
  i was working as as the writer 's assistant on a drama she was producing . 
  i am still uk based ( belfast to be precise ) . 
  nope , just bad advertising . 
  will do !, 
  damn , we played right in to their hands ... 
  still doing some revisions but will send you a link tomorrow !, 
  currently working on :, 
  sci-fi action feature ( 103 page first draft , working on 2nd ), 
  cyberpunk thriller feature ( 1st draft completed by co-writer , jumping in to this next week . 
  10 page short based on same pending funding decision ), 
  1hr historical drama pilot ( 59 page 2nd draft , needs completely reworked ), 
  20 min scifi drama pilot ( 13min version finished and produced , 1st draft of 20 min version pending ), 
  planning on submitting the feature projects to [ this ] ( http://northernirelandscreen.co.uk/sections/216/new-writer-focus-2015-2016.aspx ) and probably [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/send-a-script/ ) later in the year . 
  the scifi short thing is for [ this ] ( http://www.rte.ie/drama/tv/featured/storyland2015// ) . 
  no idea what 's going to happen with my 1hr drama . 
  it needs a lot of work at the mo but would like to get back to it later in the year . 
  it 's a good potential calling card tv pilot idea i think so want to do it justice . 
  hold my bike *, 
  i 'm doing something similar with my mum 's old bike at the mo. 
  # 120 has got me new wheels ( entry level , ebay ) new cassette ( 7spd shimano ) new rear derailleur ( 7 spd shimano tourney ) new shifter ( 7spd sram ) new chain ( entry level halfords ), 
  it 's just for my missus to spin down to the market on a saturday or whatever so i 'm happy with what i 've got . 
  if you just want something fairly basic out of it you can easily do it in your budget imo . 
  [ the one i bough claims to be ] ( http://www.halfords.com/cycling/parts/gears-drivetrain-cables/sram-mrx-comp-7-speed-rear-gear-shifter ) , but i guess we 'll find out soon enough ... 
  as long as the wheels fit i think i 'll be fine but they have n't arrived yet .
