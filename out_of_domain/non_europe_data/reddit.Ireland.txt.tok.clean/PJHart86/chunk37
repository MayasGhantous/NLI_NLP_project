  the exact wheel size that came with it seems more or less impossible to get now . 
  phew !, 
  thanks for letting me know !, 
  haha yeah , think this bike is gon na be a touch front heavy ... 
  neither of those characters are robots ... 
  norrhern ireland ruined it . 
  when i was 17 that would have got you 6 litres of cider and a 20 deck of mayfair . 
  quality library music there . 
  and that zoom back on high st was silky smooth ... 
  i like fordy , at least he seems like he gives things a bit of thought . 
  lpt : the set of rules , principles , and processes that govern the structure of sentences in a given language is called `` syntax '' not `` miscellaneous '' . 
  dazzle camouflage was used more extensively in ww1 than 2 . 
  got a link . . ? 
  well done !, 
  trying to work out the timing of this ... was it for the comedy script call ? 
  2,100 entries - bloody hell . 
  it gets bigger every year . 
  when i got longlisted before they gave a few paras of feedback , are they still doing that ? 
  was it useful ? 
  the whole reason writers room exists is to discover new writing . 
  it 's definitely not who you know . 
  when i got longlisted last year there was a few paras of feedback which you can read [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/screenwriting/comments/27qh2o/my_experience_of_the_bbc_writers_room_recent_call/ ), 
  haha yeah i see you commented there too !, 
  you submitting anything for the drama call this year ? 
  just a few months to go !, 
  yeah same , basically . 
  churned out a feature this year so will definitely get that in . 
  just deciding how i want to tackle the next draft . 
  got some good notes from rocliffe , which i wrote about [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/screenwriting/comments/3aebyd/discussion_my_experience_of_ordering_a_rocliffe/ ) ( starting to think that i share too much on this sub lol ), 
  i had an idea to completely redo the first act but the rocliffe reader seemed to respond well to it and ( most importantly ) they got all the plot and character set-up that i was trying to achieve so now i do n't know ... 
  i 'm afraid of breaking it lol . 
  if it was for adults it would be funny , the fact that it 's for kids makes it sad ... 
  yo so i 'm putting this script about a bit at mo ahead of some deadlines later in the year . 
  feedback so far has been decent but want to collect as much as possible before wading in to the next draft . 
  genre : sci-fi / action, 
  logline : damaged sergeant anders ' quiet life is interrupted when mercenaries awaken an alien army under the greenland ice , forcing him to become the leader he is terrified to be .

  anders ' enthusiastic sledmate bo is a hassle , but his quiet new life is shattered forever when another sledteam goes missing , unearthly specimens are discovered in an old nazi weather station and a british mercenary from anders ' war-time past appears, 
  with possible connections to both . 
  anders and bo soon find themselves facing a dangerous extra-terrestrial threat on one side and a shady gang of mercenaries on the other . 
  cut off from the rest of the world , anders must leave his past failings behind if he is to save his his new comrades ,, 
  himself and the world .

  at this time of year some of the bike paths i use in rougher areas [ are obstructed by this kind of bullshit ] ( http://static4.demotix.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/a_scale_large/1300-3/photos/1345078729-eleventh-night-bonfires-in-belfast_1389933.jpg ) . 
  i always think i have a few more weeks to go before i need to start avoiding these paths but they seem to start building earlier every year ... 
  my advice is just to peg it . 
  if you zip past someone at 20 - 30 mph they are n't going to have much time to case you . 
  and if you do happen to find your path blocked by an 11th night bonfire , just make sure you know the first few lines of [ the sash ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-edq26ohu5y ) , 
  richard english 's irish freedom is a very good overview . 
  broader than armed struggle iirc . 
  what exactly is the problem with a 90 - 120 page script doc ? 
  i like having mine all in one place for ease of use . 
  if i need to find/replace something i do n't need to do it in all 3 files . 
  any reports i run will be run on the whole script . 
  if i change something in act 3 that effects something in act 1 then i do n't need to open another file to implement it . 
  also when reading , i feel strongly that a script should be read in one uninterrupted sitting , just as it would be viewed on screen . 
  having each act as a different file would break that up a bit unless you print them all out . 
  seems like it would be harder to keep track of different drafts / revisions if the script is split in to 3 files ? 
  i really do n't see any advantage to it at all . 
  the alternative is just to have one long script file . 
  back it up in numerous places if you 're worried about having all your work in one big lump . 
  you can still write out of order if you want . 
  just put the scene heading and a one line note about it in place of the scenes that you are skipping over and move on to the one you want to write . 
  as long as you have a decent outline or index cards this wo n't be an issue at all and will actually help when you come back to write those scenes as you 'll know exactly where you want them and what is going to happen . 
  i do n't personally find writing out of order to be very helpful and generally find that it 's symptomatic of not having a good enough outline . 
  if i feel compelled to skip ahead and write a scene it 's generally because i have n't spent enough time working out what should be happening between the point i 'm at and the scene i want to actually write . 
  i 'm not saying this is you necessarily , but it 's worth thinking about before you go radically changing your process . 
  where i come from when they lose a bus , [ they lose a fucking bus ] ( http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/i/51psa3ef8rl._sx258_bo1,204,203,200_.jpg ) . 
  good book tho !, 
  i read it for work . 
  i burn buses !!!, 
  not really . 
  i work in tv . 
  i was working in development for a company and we pitched a documentary to bbc ni based on this book . 
  first show i ever pitched that got picked up iirc . 
  [ is that a fucking sten gun ?

  you need dpm and sten guns / armalites for that authentic troubles vibe .

  they 're also biting off a decent chunk of the irish coastline . 
  helluva trip - fair play !, 
  he should defo be charged for driving with no licence or no insurance tbf . 
  i guess if the cops are getting accused by both sides of `` political policing '' then they must be doing something right . . ? 
  it was `` wired '' living here . 
  for anyone interested in what it was really like for british soldiers on the streets during the troubles , i highly recommend ken wharton 's book [ a long long war ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/long-war-british-northern-ireland/dp/190603379x ) . 
  a collection of oral accounts from front-line servicemen . 
  a genuine collection of heartbreaking , terrifying and often humorous stories . 
  the board meeting in s03e08 of orange is the new black makes the company seem quite cut throat without making any one character seem totally evil . 
  maybe worth a look ? 
  it 's on netflix . 
  surely you have netflix ? 
  for research/extended procrastination ?
