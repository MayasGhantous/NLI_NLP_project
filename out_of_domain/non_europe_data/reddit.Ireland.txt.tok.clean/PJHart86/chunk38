  what were you doing in rolling stone ? 
  cool , just wonderin .

  you too boats if you fuck with me, 
  i actually lived in china for a little bit and one of the ( two ) police stations i had to go to while there was surprisingly chill . 
  like it wasnt a flat but it could have been an elaborately dressed house ... 
  i did ( and have done in the past ) i do n't think i 've ever had any communication back from them tho ... 
  they should n't have kicked us out of st. anne 's then . 
  something tells me they do n't sell these at halfords ...

  [ i hope this was part of a series of interviews you were doing for your upcoming book . 
  i work in tv development a bit and i love doing titles !, 
  ( as does everyone else on this sub looking at the number of comments lol ), 
  here are a couple of things we used to do in one of my old dev depts when we were spit balling titles :, 
  1 ) song lyrics / titles . 
  the first one that springs to mind for me is `` kiss the sky '' for some reason . 
  maybe think about the music that you listened to while writing ( if that 's your thing ) or that inspired it ( if any ), 
  2 ) what 's the jeopardy ? 
  what is the thing that the audience are tuning in to find out . 
  if the audience are tuning in to find out if the celebrities on the island will find love , then it 's celebrity love island ( yes this is a real show ) . 
  obviously `` lost in space '' is taken but something like `` one way trip '' ... 
  3 ) this one is just me ( and a lot of the serious suggestions in this read are along this line ) but it sort of stems a bit from no . 
  2 above . 
  i write a lot of sci-fi too and i see a trend for using the maguffin / protagonists goal as the title . 
  eg : elyisum , event horizon - these are n't just the names of ships in the film , they are things that the characters want . 
  they want to find the event horizon . 
  he wants to get to elysium . 
  what does that mean for your space janitor ? 
  he wants to survive ( and his kids to survive ) the 280 million mile round trip to mars ? 
  `` 280 million miles '' ... 
  nazi flags , confederate flags , kkk flags now this . 
  is there a bingo card going around ? 
  i know a writer who got on it once tho and it seems like they are very supportivr if/when you get selected . 
  when i was a kid our cinema was blown up by the ira :(, 
  it had a mad dog mccree machine . 
  that thing was irreplaceable !, 
  if you 're pitching this as a writer then there needs to be something different enough in the written material ... for example , pride and prejudice and zombies is copyright rekulak and grahamme-smith . 
  luhrmann 's romeo + juliet script is copyright pearce and luhrmann . 
  it depends how specific you are . 
  obviously `` gritty modern retelling of shakespeare '' is too big a concept to copyright but if you sit down and write your take ( even a treatment for your take ) then you own that specific version . 
  yup !, 
  i also have fond memories of the glengormley movie house . 
  this thread is turning in to a tour of ni 's sketchiest cinemas ... 
  this sounds like a workplace stress dream that i might have , combining my past career in retail ( where i lived in fear of difficult customers ) and my current career in television ( where i live in fear of being reported to ofcom ),

  if you got ta go , you might as well do it right . 
  i always wanted a job i could do at 3 am in my pants . 
  the pants are non-negotiable . 
  guess so . 
  in the meantime i 'll just continue to do script reports at 3 am in my pants . 
  you 're getting rightly downvoted for this tho ,

  if you 're in to hiking and you 've got the camping gear i would say just camp on cave hill or black mountain !, 
  both are very close to the city centre and the views at night are pretty cool .

  maybe they should just give up on holding things all together .

  what width are those tires ? 
  60 psi seems kinda low ... 
  all it needs is [ hugo duncan interviewing a donkey . 
  i stayed in a `` guest house '' in a building like that in hk . 
  basically just a couple of flats next door to each other with rooms for short-term rent . 
  laundry and kids all over the place like it was a back garden , not a concrete tube a mile up in the sky . 
  belfast bike tours  belfast bus tour imo . 
  other suggests so far are solid . 
  just in case anybody gets any ideas about sloping off early on fridays ...

  source ? 
  best i could find for others who are curious :, 
   speed limits, 
   do speed limits apply to bicycles ? 
   short answer, 
   mostly no , though bye-laws could impose speed limits on cyclists . 
   long answer, 
   normal roads, 
   on ` normal ' public highways , the general speed limits ( whatever they are ) do not apply to bicycles . 
   note that the highway code rule 124 states speed limits are in the table , but the table has no row that applies to bicycles . 
  there is a bit of a fault in that a footnote to the table does indeed state that `` the 30 mph limit usually applies to all traffic '' ( my emphasis ) , but that appears to be a wrong statement ( there are a few such careless statements in the highway code ) . 
   the highway code references rtra , which is the road traffic regulation act 1984 , sections 81 , 86 , 89 & schedule 6 . 
  in fact , these sections all fall within part vi of the act , which is entirely about speed limits . 
   the first thing to note is that the highway code blanket statement is wrong - section 81 is quite explicit that `` it shall not be lawful for a person to drive a motor vehicle on a restricted road at a speed exceeding 30 miles per hour '' ( my emphasis ) .
