   further reading reveals that throughout this act , the speed limits discussed apply to motor vehicles and their drivers , not to cyclists . 
  note , for example section 89 : `` a person who drives a motor vehicle on a road at a speed exceeding a limit imposed by or under any enactment to which this section applies shall be guilty of an offence . '', 
   theoretical possibilities, 
   it should be noted that it seems there is a theoretical possibility for a speed limit to be imposed on cyclists . 
  although the ` standard ' way for speed limits is via the rtra noted above , tsrgd 2002 , the traffic signs regulations and general directions 2002 allows for speed limits to be imposed by local acts ( here ) . 
   in principle , a local act might create a speed limit that applied to cyclists . 
  however , it 's very unlikely , and i 've never seen a reference to one that does . 
  further , the act would have to define the offence and penalty - it could not simply refer back to the rtra , because the offence created in that act ( section 89 , quoted above ) explicitly applies to the drivers of motor vehicles . 
  so , it would be possible for a road to have a speed limit created by local act that applied to cyclists , but it 's very unlikely , and even if it did , it is further unlikely that there would be an offence committed in breaking the speed limit . 
   official advice, 
   another interesting snippet arises from a department for transport consultation document that never turned into anything other than a consultation . 
  the 2004 local transport notes on walking and cycling document had an annex d code of conduct notice for cyclists which recommends `` as a general rule , if you want to cycle quickly , say in excess of 18 mph/30 kph , then you should be riding on the road . '', 
   but ... 
   however , despite the fact that speed limits do not apply to bicycles , you can be prosecuted simply for cycling too fast - under the charge of ` cycling furiously ' . 
  you can also be prosecuted for riding dangerously o carelessly . 
   special cases, 
   it is possible for locations to have bye-laws that impose speed limits on bicycles . 
   it used to be the case that speed limits in royal parks applied to bicycles , because the relevant sis , the royal parks and other open spaces regulations 1997 amended by the royal parks and other open spaces ( amendment ) regulations 2004 stated that speed limits in the parks applied to vehicles ( not motor vehicles ) . 
   however , the royal parks and other open spaces ( amendment ) etc. 
  regulations 2010 include a definition of vehicle that applies only to motor vehicles , here , suggesting that everything which applied to all vehicles in the royal parks sis now only applies to motor vehicles . 
  thus , speed limits would not apply to bicycles in royal parks , just as they do not in general elsewhere .

  for something brand new at that price range your money is probably best spent at decathlon as / u/batty3108 says .

  you are evaluating what will ultimately be an entertainment product so i think there is value to consuming it during the hours of the day that would otherwise be considered leisure time . 
  a mediocre script might not seem so bad at 10am because hey , it beats sitting in the office churning out tps reports but a mediocre script read at 10pm is up against whatever is playing in the cinema , whatever is on tv or whatever is on sale on steam - just like the finished product would be if it ever entered the marketplace as a finished film or show .
