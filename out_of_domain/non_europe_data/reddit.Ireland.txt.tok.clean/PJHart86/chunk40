  my rocket league fuck-ups hurt a little less now . 
  what format is it currently in ? 
  bbc4 is great and all but if it 's a binary choice i 'd probably rather see # 50m worth of new bbc drama . 
  i 'd prefer if they unfroze the license fee ( or binned news24 ) so we could have both ... 
  whoops , thought this was a self post ... 
  surely this whole clusterfuck counts as `` exceptional circumstances ? '', 
   it 's much better than this shitty subreddit .

  thanks !, 
  no wonder canadian rap music is so shitty . 
  good luck !,

  halfords is a big chain that sells over priced car and bike stuff . 
  did they try to sell you anything in terms of script services after you did n't move on ?

  well done !, 
  they had over 8000 submissions this year !, 
  from an email i got from them yesterday :, 
   after receiving a record number of 8,627 entries , we are close to finalizing this year 's group of second rounders and semifinalists . 
  we have already begun sending notification letters via postal mail and they will continue to be sent out through the rest of this week and should start hitting mailboxes within the next week . 
  to ensure everyone receives communication , notifications will also be sent via e-mail early next week . 
  semifinalists will receive a personal phone call from matt dy , screenplay competition director . 
  the full list of second rounders and semifinalists will be available on our website by next wednesday , september 16, 
  so looks like it 's an ongoing process , but you should know for sure by wednesday , if those dates are correct !, 
  long live grammanarchy !, 
  / r/producemyscript might have something . 
  obligatory ama request to / u/benkopit and a massive congratulations !, 
  bowe must be gutted but he 's only got himself to blame really . 
  yeah my bro has a genesis of some kind that came kitted out with full 105 . 
  6061 frame and carbon fork iirc . 
  be wary of the note behind the note here . 
  that first page was n't the wall of text i was expecting from your post but i agree that it will turn a reader off . 
  for me , there 's no hook . 
  i would * maybe * forgive the camera direction and clunky formatting if the opening v.o. 
  was something like :, 
   the harvest came early that year . 
  and death followed with it . 
  or anything to make me lean in and take notice . 
  a character intro montage is clunky in my opinion , but if you 're going to do it you really need to nail the characters . 
  i do n't get much of a sense of who any of the women are from that montage , which makes it redundant . 
  if i got a sense from the opening line that something was going to happen to these characters , and then got a really good sense of who they are then straight off the bat then i 'm probably in at least until the end of the first act . 
  i 'm sure he 'll get a run out against romania but the rte pundits were making the point after the england game that it 's perhaps difficult for schmidt to assess players based on performances against weaker teams so if he wants to secure that all important group win he may stick with players who proved themselves against stronger opposition in the england game when it comes to italy and france . 
  i do n't know if i 100 % agree with that but he 'll have to seriously stand out against romania given the competition at the back . 
  what happens when they all get here ? 
  do they all arrive at once ? 
  we should organize a big carry out * somewhere for all the lads . 
  * by which of course i mean some sort of family-friendly social gathering respectful of those who choose not to drink for religious reasons ... 
  mo money mo problems, 
  / u/itschrisreed isnt wrong and when hiring for short projects potential crewmembers have quoted me a flat per day price that they wont budge on and thats fair enough . 
  i 've produced a couple of shorts for # 2500 each and the sound budget was # 400 inc post . 
  i 'm actually quite emotional watching the build up to this and i 'm fucking irish !, 
  haha i can just imagine the massive cloud of whogivesafuck that this would have generated it / r/unitedkingdom . 
  if he 's got 30 sick days to use then it might be worth riding that one out . 
  yes but they arent cross compatible with the same features in final draft .

  respect for the bcbc buckfast bottles . 
   narrative structure is n't just a screenwriting trope . 
  from iago and othello , to beatrice and benedict , prospero and caliban , and hotspur and hal , all narrative is built on opposites . 
  but so too is american idol and undercover boss . 
  at the beginning of the apprentice , candidates are given a task , they perform it , then they are judged - act one , act two , act three . 
  all are codifications of the same basic process : we exist , we perceive , we change . 
  we can not escape it . 
  even screenwriter charlie kaufman , who grandly proclaims of three-act structure , `` it does n't really interest me , '' writes it unknowingly . 
  what better illustration of the creative shape than being john malkovich , where characters go on a journey into somebody else 's head to find something lacking within themselves ?
