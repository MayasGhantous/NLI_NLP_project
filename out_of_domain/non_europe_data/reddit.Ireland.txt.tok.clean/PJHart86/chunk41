   it was entirely clear that ireland 's liberation from its colonial and imperial oppressor must be directly followed by the establishing of a new socialist society . 
  irish republicanism and irish nationalism are n't exactly the same thing but even if we consider them as such , the movement toward an independent irish state has always ideologically aligned itself first and foremost with the enemies of britain . 
  when the irish republic was proclaimed in 1916 , it specifically mentions `` allies in europe '' to which it is referring to the central powers and in particular imperial germany , not a regime known for its socialist tendencies . 
  after the civil war , many irish nationalists were influenced by the rise of various european nationalist organisations across europe , including the fascists in italy and spain . 
  a company of irish volunteers even went to fight ** for ** franco in the spanish civil war . 
  even some of those who went to spain to fight for the republic , like ira commander frank ryan , soon found themselves allied again with germany during wwii as a means of potentially expelling the british from northern ireland . 
  after the war , the provisional ira embraced a radical left wing doctrine at the beginning of the 1970s , conveniently enough during a time when communist geurillas around the world were receiving a great deal of financial and materiel support from communist countries . 
  their `` green book '' code of conduct called for the overthrow of the existing irish republic , the overthrow of the northern irish government and the establishment of a socialist republic across the entire island of ireland . 
  their political representatives , sinn fein , now sit in government in northern ireland and have elected officials in the republic of ireland as well so revolutionary socialism does n't seem like much of a priority any more ... 
  did n't stop them [ cracking the enigma code ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28167071 ) or [ scoring the most kills during the battle of britain ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/303_squadron ) though . 
  ultimately it was germany that got rolled . 
  flair checks out, 
  i could fit about a tenners worth of groceries in to one of those i reckon ...

  cranium on stranmillis is dead on and has student discount, 
  thanks !, 
  yeah i 've submitted before , i think the turnaround time on that occasion was around 5 - 6 weeks so you 'll probably be waiting a bit longer i 'm afraid . 
  i wrote a little bit about the process [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/screenwriting/comments/27qh2o/my_experience_of_the_bbc_writers_room_recent_call/ ) . 
  good luck !, 
  unbelievably spelling ... 
  [ i prefer his earlier work . 
  i reposted the golf thing , sorry :(, 
  we 'll see him again when he comes out to raise the trophy . 
  unless you live in the markets or short strand : /, 
   these brainless fuckwits will undoubtedly ruin people 's lives with their ancient , irrelevant religious dogma . 
  i think this is our government 's motto tbf, 
  https://www.inktip.com/ could be a good place to start . 
  i guess i have n't been there for a while ... when i was a regular it was all women working there and they had more of a street sharks vibe going on . 
  considering that just getting past the qfs and in to the semis would be historically unprecedented i ca n't see anyone going in to that game feeling complacent . 
  the team showed amazing character in the 2nd half against france after losing sexto poc and o'mahony and i 'm sure we 'll see more of that on sunday . 
  mountain warehouse is the bomb . 
  it we bes on the internet, 
  i 'm starting the drinking now, 
  if monumental hadda got another series i may have needed to resort to using this for the town challenge round ... 
  fingers crossed !, 
  dude !!, 
  i 'm going to be out of town ( on my own honeymoon believe it or not ) but you should totally check out this gig :, 
  itziarren semeak - really fun basque ska-punk, 
  pocket billiards - belfast ska-punk institution , bit heavier than itziarren and a really great live show . 
  agressors bc - similar vibe to pb above but a bit rawer and rougher round the edges . 
  the venue is just the upstairs of a pub in the city centre so it should be packed out and jumping , plus handy for you to get to and back from wherever you 're staying - enjoy !, 
  ** edit ** : keep an eye on http://warzonecollective.com/ closer to the time too , it 's a social centre and autonomous collective in the city centre that sometimes has good gigs too . 
  what the hell is this comic ? 
  i 'm not googling it , for obvious reasons ... 
  ca n't wait to read that one on the bus ... 
  i bought 6 cans for a tenner from the bar to `` share with the table '' at the start of the match . 
  all gone at half time . 
  by me . 
  i could just get it on comixology but now i 'm intrigued ... 
  $ 99 one off doesnt seem unreasonable for lifetime updates, 
  any further discount for other writers named hart ? 
  also i 'm due a writer duet discount code from a screencraft comp , any chance i can use the discount for this instead ? 
  i know it 's only craic like but if he 's the one * being * tackled he is n't under any obligation to use his arms , right ? 
  continued : and ( continued ) lines since everyone started using celtx . 
  turn that shit off . 
  guilty . 
  if dialogue is split over 2 pages ( and it has to be long for that to happen ) you have a ( more ) line at the bottom of the dialogue and a, 
  character ( cont 'd ) line at the top of the next page . 
  some free screenwriting software puts a ( continued ) line at the bottom right of every single page and a continued : line at the top left regardless of how the page ends or how the next page starts . 
  it 's a little thing but it drives me crackers . 
  ** edit : ** i assume it does n't do this if a scene ends on the bottom of a page and the first line on the next page is the scene header but that 's just a guess . 
  yeah but they only do it in dublin , where the pres has jurisdiction to shake any hand he or she wants at the drop of a hat . 
  thats how we roll northside , bitches !, 
  my mum left a note but she ripped it up and put it in the bin . 
  i remember finding it and spending a couple of hours on the day piecing it back together but cant for the life of me remember what it said ... just having a task to focus on at the time helped i think . 
  the ones i 've ordered online have all charged my tab really slowly . 
  lem me know if you get a decent one . 
  regret . 
  he 's doing a jedi mind trick on joubert . 
  to be fair i do have irrational feelings of anger towards my rwc2015 ireland training top now ... 
  just cuz they aint rolling do n't mean hanks aint performing . 
  i think the fella that burned the whitehouse down was from portaferry or somewhere, 
  ** edit ** : [ it was robert ross , from rostrevor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_ross_\\ ( british_army_officer \\ ) ) .
