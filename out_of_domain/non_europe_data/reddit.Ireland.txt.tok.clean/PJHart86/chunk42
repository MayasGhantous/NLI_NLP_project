  i started this gangsta shit, 
  less lindelof the better imo, 
  20 years after a bloke feom rostrevor burned down the whitehouse . 
  3 for 3 !, 
  if it was n't for guys like this having an attitude like this we 'd never have even had a punk scene in belfast . 
  eternally grateful . 
  still cracks me up that aliens toys are recommended for ages 5 and up . 
  though it was actually these toys that got me interested in the franchise long before i was old enough to see the movies so i should be grateful really . 
  well done !, 
  just do n't get too informal at the informal cocktail mixer , 
  have a look at a book called into the woods by john yorke . 
  it does a great job of explaining how the same principles apply to all forms of storytelling , might help the transition from novel to screenplay go a little smoother . 
  see.sense icon, 
  couldnt you buy these as a cheap box set for wfb at one stage too ?

  [ the northern ireland one is a good laugh ] ( http://ia700303.us.archive.org/29/items/apocketguidetonorthernireland_781/w0051.pdf ), 
  ah , well . 
  that 's the end of that then . 
  wooo !, 
  long weekend !, 
   professor jane ohlmeyer , one of the principal investigators at trinity , believes that new language analysis methods will allow the documents to be explored `` in a way we could n't have done 10 or 15 years ago during the troubles '' . 
  it does n't bode super well if one of the principal investigators doesnt know that the troubles were pretty much over `` 10 or 15 years ago '' ... 
  they cost a lot more than comedy panel but gather a similar audience both in terms of demo and numbers . 
  and thats for the good ones . 
  when they rescue a wounded animal ( a raccoon ? ), 
  but then it dies ? 
  i think i remember them hugging after that, 
  norn iron man , obviously . 
  i havent been home for a couple of months so i have no idea what this is about but it sounds annoyingly like an idea i pitched at the beeb a few years ago ... 
  i 'll do it if they 're stuck like . 
  his wife was worse, 
  boris could pull it off in that so-bad-it 's - good way of his . 
  then he 'd rugby tackle an 8 year old just for good measure . 
  dunno if each of these cunts deserve their own thread like, 
   `` the uda affiliates have the clout to alter the allocation of homes through brute force , sectarian innuendo and attempts to instil fear in the community , '', 
  it would , but not sure why that 's relevant to my comment . 
  i would describe any politicians who use scripture to govern in the same terms , regardless of their position on the union . 
  bucky has been a rip off for years sure, 
  i once read a script where not one but two characters were named after the same iconic horror/scifi character ... 
  nudge nudge taigs out wink wink ... 
  subtle . 
  nda and all that but if i recall they used the actor 's name rather than the character so at least that 's something lol, 
  haha i was steaming when i posted this , dunno why i thought i needed an immediate update on the uber situation at midnight in costa rica ... 
  we had one but he malfunctioned . 
  george best , they called him . 
  been out of the country for a couple of months , looking forward to getting some porters in for the cold weather . 
  dark beer isnt the same in hot weather imo . 
  been dreaming about farmageddon india export porter ... 
  yeah i actually had a pretty good chocolate stout in belize but 1 or 2 was the max per sitting, 
  there are two types of people in this world , one is hudson , sir . 
  he 's hicks . 
  whether this is xmas , sir , or another bug hunt . 
   bob also traveled with deadpool and weasel to the savage land , where he ran away from an assortment of dinosaurs, 
  this was on zero when i came across it . 
  whoever downvoted this kid needs to take a good long look at themselves . 
  nice knowing you guys . 
  my house has apparently already been eaten ... 
  pilots need to concentrate on flying the plane , not worrying about their narrative structure and character motivations all the time . 
  cabin crew should be allowed though , imo . 
  i especially like how the gif loop almost makes it seem as though he offloads to himself after the try , setting himself up for an endless loop of try scoring ... 
  barely , just barely . 
  the girl is looking at a phone in the main pic . 
  the implication is that the text message exchange on the phone is the one the little girl is seeing . 
  maybe she just discovered her parents are breaking up ? 
  i dunno , that 's where my brain went anyway . 
  lol yup, 
  touts out, 
  edit : only messin like, 
  finally got someone interested in trying to sell the thing and they 're giving me some money for another draft so ... 
  some really good coffee , beer or whiskey depending on what is socially ac eptable for the time of the week / day . 
  i have a feeling that this guy 's liver is in much better shape than mine ... 
  lost 2 last year ( 2015 ) and 1 the year before :(, 
  edit : to thieves . 
  i 'm not that absent-minded . 
  yeah it sucks , i 'm pretty sure it 's the same fuckers every time . 
  trying to get my hands on [ one of these bad boys ] ( http://www.langhalegardens.co.uk/shop/product%20pictures/trimetals_metal_sheds/bicycle_storage_1.jpg ) before i get my insurance replacements this time but trying to get anyone to deliver one to northern ireland seems to be a near-impossible task . 
  yeah it 'll probably come to that !, 
  because the dup have policies that are explicitly bigoted towards women and homosexuals . 
  [ free presbyterians are more than 50 times more common in the dup than they are in the population . 
  orangemen are 21 times more common in the party , as of 2014 . 
  ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/inside-the-dup-domination-by-free-presbyterian-church-and-orange-order-laid-bare-30330698.html ), 
  both organisations have a well-documented history of bigotry that hardly even seems worth sourcing in a reddit reply . 
  as for the aryan comment , i ca n't seem to find any stats on a racial break down of dup members but there is certainly no record of any non-white people serving in any elected position ( or indeed running for one ) on a dup ticket that i can find . 
  the same can probably be said for most of the parties here ( with the obvious exception of alliance ) . 
  not unexpected really , considering the demographic make-up of northern ireland but it is worth noting that the dup are [ no ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/peter-robinson-i-wouldnt-trust-muslims-devoted-to-sharia-law-but-i-would-trust-them-to-go-down-to-the-shops-for-me-30313447.html ) [ strangers ] ( http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/paisley-jnr-apologises-to-chinese-for-racist-remark-29024543.html ) [ to ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/finance-minister-sammy-wilson-clashes-with-group-over-racism-28490203.html ) [ racist ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/dup-sidelines-race-slur-councillor-dineen-walker-as-peter-robinson-prepares-to-revisit-islam-centre-30323698.html ) [ incidents ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/racism-claim-after-dup-member-speaks-irish-in-assembly-1.1986769 ) either ... 
   i disagree with the dup 's stance on gay marriage and abortion , but it 's politics . 
  just because it 's politics does n't mean it 's not bigoted . 
  legislating differently for people because of their gender or sexual preference is inherently bigoted . 
   the aryan comment is dumb . 
  sure but if we accept `` aryan '' to mean `` white '' in this context then it 's hardly inaccurate . 
   as for the racist comments, 
  i did n't say that they had made racist comments . 
  i said that they had been linked to racist incidents . 
  debating the merits of each one seems pointless since all i was originally saying was that the dup are white and bigoted , which is why comments saying that they are white and bigoted might get upvoted . 
  whether it 's bigotry against women and homesexuals , as outlined in their current policies , the historical bigotry against catholics linked to the two organisations of which a large number of their members affiliate with or the racial / cultural insensitivity displayed in the linked stories , it hardly matters . 
  supporting a set of laws for one group of people ( heteros ) and actively denying those rights to others is imherently discriminatory . 
   i do n't understand why anyone is down votin,
