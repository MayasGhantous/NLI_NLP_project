  our sub motto, 
  how does a fist-pump qualify as larger than mini ? 
  does it have to draw blood ? 
  create a sonic-boom ? 
  edit : also , ever since our local equivelant of just eat got taken over by just eat it 's become a tremendous pain in the hoop . 
  this guy fucks, 
  the bbc has a piece of software that formats factual scripts in to 3 columns ... 
  i think it 's jut called bbc scriptwriter , not sure if it 's available in the wild but worth a look if it is . 
  timecode i think ... 
  i had some training in it years ago but never actually used it in production . 
  so the 3 columns would be timecode , vision and audio i guess ? 
  we worked the same job at university . 
  then some stuff happened . 
  now we 're married !, 
  true story . 
  bookfinders on university road is good but mental, 
  i thought bridge of spies and compton were both good films * despite * their scripts , rather than because of them . 
  compton is far too disparate in terms of its protagonists and narrative . 
  spies lacked tension and stakes for me , i never really felt like the deal was anything other than inevitable , or that tom hanks was really in any danger . 
  like the constitutional issue . . ? 
  i had a crash last year , and started getting calls where they were like `` we see you 've been in an accident that was n't your fault '' so i just told them that actually it was my fault ( which was true ) and they sort of seemed to lose interest after that :(, 
  if you do n't know what the constitutional issue is specifically regarding northern irish politics then i do n't see the point in getting in to a discussion about it with you . 
  ditto if you 're being intentionally obtuse so i 'll just say good day to you sir . 
  interesting ... 
  i watched it on a plane and i just did n't get `` sucked in '' in the way i would expect to for a thriller like this , maybe it was n't the ideal viewing platform ... 
  i 've enjoyed a lot of films i watched on planes but agree that it 's not ideal, 
  good for you , and keep it up !, 
  can you tell us more about this 600km trip you have planned ? 
  i use my bike 90 % for commuting but i 'd love to try something like that some day, 
  hey that tucking sucks . 
  something similar happened to me before christmas . 
  my shed was broken in to while i was on my honeymoon . 
  my home contents insurance covered the theft ( though we would n't have been covered if the bikes had n't been on the property , some policies do some dont ) and i 've decided to invest in a metal bike locker that i can keep right beside the house ( the shed is on the other side of an alleyway so easier to molest unnoticed ), 
  they cost around # 500 here in the uk for a unit that you build yourself that can store 3 bikes . 
  the main brands seem to be trimetals and asgard if you want to look them up . 
  as others have mentioned a lojack type device is n't really an option . 
  when i reported the incident to the cops they sent me a bike register security kit , which just seems to be a qr code . 
  that you stick on the bike and register with them . 
  if you report it stolen and a cop/pawnshop/craigslist buyer scans the code then they 'll know its yours . 
  not exactly bulletproof i know but might make a casual thief think twice . 
  hope that 's useful to you , losing bikes to thieves sucks balls . 
  there are , but if you can find a example of the phrase '' * the * constitutional issue '' ( including the definite article ) being used in the context of northern irish politics to mean anything other than whether or not the province should remain in the union then i would be very interested in seeing it . 
  nice . 
  i 've just ordered a [ planet x london road ] ( http://www.planetx.co.uk/c/q/bikes/road-bikes/london-road ) that i hope to do a bit of light touring on but looks like you have your eye on something that 's more of a pure tourer . 
  i 'd love to add something like that to my collection someday . 
  well then , those who are n't versed in their politics have all learned a little something today . 
  i had 9 speed ultegra ( st-600 i think ? ), 
  shifters on my last build . 
  picked them up for around 50 quid on ebay and was very happy with them ( until the bike got nicked ), 
  life 's hard . 
  ... again . 
  i do n't know if i could do 600km on it but then there 's only really one way to find out !, 
  yeah it 's real , though i think it 's a fair bit less than 50p . 
  i remember looking it up about 6 months ago when i was under the laughable impression that i was going to get my taxes done early . 
  this is a very vague memory ... 
  i was looking to see what mileage i could claim back for my car vs. what my employer at that time was paying for . 
  the page i ended up looking at is ( i think ) [ this one ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-travel-mileage-and-fuel-allowances/travel-mileage-and-fuel-rates-and-allowances ) , which says 20p per mile for bikes . 
  `` developed nation '' is a bit of a stretch tbh, 
  i once got a train in vietnam . 
  we were mis-sold seated tickets instead of sleeper tickets ( it was a 12 hours + journey ) . 
  people were already sitting in the seats that we had tickets for . 
  ended up bribing a train guard to get a bed . 
  train guard gave us a bed in their own cabin . 
  shift changed in the middle of the night , new train guards kicked us out of their cabin and in to another cabin in which other people were already sleeping . 
  still better than translink . 
  if we exclude larne we could maybe describe ni as a `` developed nation '' . 
  maybe . 
  i see your point , if we exclude larne our gross domestic product will go up , but gross mervyn product will go down ... 
  no no , good day to you sir !, 
  i said good ~ ~ day ~ ~ mervyn !, 
  touts out, 
  merverts are people who are obsessed with mervyns , right ? 
  seriously though , [ here 's the lads they 're looking for . 
  ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/can-you-help-police-identify-these-people-over-belfast-antiinternment-parade-disorder-34361614.html ), 
  i like where you 're going with this script , but if i had one note i would cut `` fade in '' . 
  it 's extraneous . 
   i know this because i lost my key but had my leather man lol . 
  i swear , your honour !, 
  on / r/bikecommuting we often get caught up in discussing the aspects of the bike that relate specifically to commuting ( given the name of the sub that should n't really be surprising ) so when talking about a bike ( new or otherwise ) we 'll often be thinking about how best to lock it , what panniers to use , what bags , what lights , what horn/bell , what fenders ... sometimes the bike gets forgotten about under all the extras !, 
  he 's wearing 16 ... 
  all you need is a cat flap and a jigsaw . 
  just add the flap and you 're there !, 
  i would cut that too tbh , makes the whole thing much leaner . 
  damn dude , put on some pants . 
  boxer shorts maybe !, 
  tell it to the judge , perv !,
