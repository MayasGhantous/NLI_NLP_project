  biggest downer was when my mum passed away when i was 22 . 
  it 's a shame i did n't get to share a lot of the cool stuff i got up to with her . 
  not bad but not as good . 
  they are , though the format was reworked from the ground up for tv . 
  des appears later in the tv series as a guest !, 
  source : i worked on both, 
  cheers !, 
  3000 scripts is a crazy amount , to be fair . 
  they had less than 1000 last time i submitted .

  as you probably know already , the triban was voted the uk 's best budget & best commuting bike for 2014/15 by www.road.cc . 
  if you find that you prefer riding your road bike to your hybrid then you may want to start commuting on it , in which case the triban appears to be better suited as the merlin lacks mudguard mounts . 
  as others have mentioned , the other big difference is shimano claris vs microshift but i ca n't really speak to that . 
  there was the [ free territory in ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_territory ) and [ certain areas of spain during the early days of the civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_revolution_of_1936 ) . 
  these areas were ostensibly governed along anarchist principals ( ie ; without leaders or a ruling clas or government hierarchy ) but the extent to which that was practically achieved in any of these cases is the subject of much debate . 
  either way , both movements were wiped out ( ironically by other left wing forces ) before any long-term case study could be conducted . 
  some significant crotch bunching going on there too, 
  it 's 2015 and a hoverboard fire has made a family homeless ... 
  well , yes , but that 's not what the headline says . 
  i believe that 's the motto on our coat of arms, 
  ... dangit . 
  i do n't write the articles, 
  that 's a subject of some debate here . 
  bt used to be a good newspaper . 
  now , less so ... 
  it 's not what it once was , to be fair . 
  some slavs are squatting i guess ? 
  i dunno , nobody actually reads newspapers any more , do they ? 
  i never said that you said ... ah screw it , let 's go play outside . 
  harsh but fair, 
  jaysis lads , we nearly went a month without a duolingo irish story there . 
  the fact that shady corporations are using our nostalgia for an idealistic version of the future that never came to pass to sell us dangerous toys that might burn down our house is cyberpunk as fuck .

  looks like inquisitor 54mm, 
  90s gt frames are getting a lot of love on / r/bicycling these days . 
  might be worth a look,

  it 's like a grim , dark version of babylon 5 - i love it !, 
  she says `` shit '' a couple of times ... 
  i have n't read any of the books but am certainly starting to get interested ... 
  i could get in to that . 
  they used to do salsa in the empire , dunno if it 's still a thing, 
  well uh , the empire ( on botanic ave ) is where ... as for when , you 'd need to ask them . 
  i do n't know if they still have a salsa night ... 
  worth keeping an eye on their sales - some very good discounts a few times a year .

  there 's a group called men 's shed that runs stuff like this :, 
  i think it 's maybe for older men but they might be able to steer you in the right direction at least . 
  this makes me feel better about the drama i 'm working on with 2 female leads ...

  would be tricky to identify from that photo alone i 'd say . 
  just google it . 
  from the same article :, 
   dr leslie budd from the open university said he did not share that optimism on trade . 
  he said the transaction costs of trying to get deals with a range of countries `` could be very large '' . 
  he also raised questions about the impact of foreign direct investment in the uk . 
  meanwhile , prof gibson said a uk exit could , in the short-term , blunt the impact of northern ireland having a reduced rate of corporation tax . 
  he said it could lead foreign firms to postpone investment until trade agreements become clear . 
  `` i think there would be added complexity , it would at least be a factor in those firm 's intentions , '' he added . 
  he said that could lead to a situation where the tax was cut and `` in the first two years not much is happening . '', 
  being from northern ireland , i have a genuine crisis of identity every time i come across this .

  this image was taken in northern ireland . 
  started riding it to work this week and it handles like a dream but i 'll have a better idea once i get the pannier slapped on . 
  it 's also my first experience of sram and i 've been impressed with rival so far . 
  would recommend !, 
  gives me the option to run a more climb-friendly rear cassette if i want . 
  i 've found that when converting/upgrading older frames , you ca n't go wrong with the [ tektro 559 ] ( http://www.amazon.com/tektro-reach-calipers-silver-55-73mm/dp/b006z0ovwc ) s ( if you 're doing an entry to mid level build ) . 
  the reach is 55-73mm so with 18mm of adjustable play you 'll probably be covered .

  i 'm getting this on my business cards . 
  i guess if it has v brakes then it may have been set up for mtb wheels ... the difference in size between ( for example ) 650b and 26 '' would result in a discrepancy of ( i think ) 12.5 mm which is a bit more than op is reporting . 
  or if it 's a hybrid set up for 27 x 1\u00a01/4 fitted with 700c wheels then it would result in a discrepancy of 4mm , which is a bit under what op is reporting ... 
  just talking shit here tho , would need more info from op to really get stuck in and do n't know enough about v brakes to recommend anything . 
  beginner 's cycling tip # 29 : cyclists really care about fonts . 
  i 'd say the purchase of this bike was delayed at least 2 weeks because i could not decide on the colours . 
  i like the look of the green but i was worried that the novelty might wear off after a while ... 
  i was quite taken with the new blue one as well but not as keen on the px logo and london road stickers on that . 
  i 'd bought a couple of the matte black pro carbons for work a few years ago and thought they looked pretty tidy so that was the safe option . 
  i actually think the colour looks even better on the ali frame !, 
  so far i have no issues with the brakes but my largest total load so far is < 100kg .
