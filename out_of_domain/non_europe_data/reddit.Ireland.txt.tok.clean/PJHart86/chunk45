  this is my first set of disc brakes and i 'm moving from shitty tektro calipers so it feels like a big improvement in braking power for me !, 
  what groupset did you get on yours ? 
  i 'm enjoying the rival so far !, 
  yeah i 'm glad they have more colours now ( i 've been looking at this bike for a long time ! ), 
  with so much competition out there , many bikes with similar specs for similar prices from different manufacturers , colour options can make or break a sale these days . 
  i was considering the [ vitus energie for # 830 ] ( http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/vitus-bikes-energie-cyclo-x-bike-2016/rp-prod134321 ) as well but the frame only comes in one awful colour . 
  this is n't / r/conspiracy, 
  nice !, 
  i was seriously looking at one of these recently ... initial impressions ? 
  not me but my mate , we jumped in to a game together and he tells me over ts that he 'd just been playing a 1v1 with a guy , beat him pretty badly and at the end of the game the guy told him all the big star wars ep7 spoilers . 
  this was less than a week after it came out !, 
  uh ... really ? 
  i still have a fair bit of that stuff ... 
   the star , who has appeared in several critically acclaimed movies and series including killing bono , ' 71 , pacific and ** clash of the clans **, 
  i think this journo has been spending too much time playing mobile games ... 
  clash of clans is probably better reviewed tbf . 
  cricky waltz seems to like it well enough . 
  might as well plug my own : [ kill me now ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmh_06biecm ), 
  hey thanks !, 
  yes , i 'd be happy for the film to feature on your site . 
  i see you 're also looking for behind the scenes footage , here 's the epk for kill me now if that 's any use to you as well :, 
  let me know when you 're planning to go live and i 'll spread the link around a bit !, 
  i hope dc do n't ... * sue * them . 
  sympathies to one and all !, 
   willie is legit mentally ill as fuck . 
  god love him . 
  legit diagnosis , doctor . 
  edit : only messin like !, 
  i think there 's been speculation that he has exaggerated / staged some of these events in the past . 
  was n't there that time he was sent a bullet in the post , but the envelope had no stamp and his own handwriting on it ? 
  take that with a grain of salt of course - i ca n't be bothered sourcing it because i 've already reached the maximum allotted brainspace i 'm willing to give to willie frazer in any given day . 
  watch out for yodel though . 
  some people are also just happy enough to be parents ? 
  heard it on radio ulster too, 
  `` when it comes to punk , new york has the hair cuts , london has the trousers but belfast has the reason '', 
  looks a lot better than the other game i got for christmas that year : unreal tournament ... 
  touts out, 
  counts as ... goliath ( blue ) and cawdor ( red ) ? 
  having worked in the props department , i can tell you that unless this character would have an expensive bike is an integral part of the story there 's no way you 're going to drop 2 grand on a prop that you can get for a hundred quid from argos . 
  most of the time a prop is just that : a prop . 
  the real pizza looks the least appetizing of the lot ... 
  this guy is in for some severe disappointment if he ever decides to come visit the old ancestral homeland ... 
  i 've worked on dramas where we 've hit ~ 35 pages for a half hour , but it was a bbc half hour which is 28 mins on screen . 
  for us network , you 're probably looking at around 45 - 55 pages or 55 - 65 for a hbo hour . 
  i 've used rocliffe and screencraft for script reports on a feature before and found them both very helpful and not too extortionate . 
  i 'm a uk script reader and bbc trained script editor so would be happy to quote you for a script report on a tv pilot if you 're interested , but wont have any availability until early march . 
  he might have had an easier time of it if he was ... 
  hit the local libraries . 
  there are some locally produced limited-print books about old timey belfast neighbourhoods . 
  i remember my mum had one about where she lived near north street . 
  it had some twee title that i ca n't remember so google is no good to me here , but if you go to the central library and tell them that this is the sort of thing you 're looking for then they 'll sort you out . 
  if you pull old copies of the irish news , telegraph and newsletter from the period you might hit gold too . 
  newspaper library is at the side of central . 
  this post brought to you by a guy in his 20s who loves the fucking library for some reason . 
  this clean style was all the rage in the 2nd ed days when i started playing so will always feel more `` retro '' to me - suits the 30k vibe perfectly imo as a result . 
  i 'll pm you my services and rates, 
  it really depends on the project . 
  i used to charge per page for that service rather than per hour , but ended up on one occasion spending almost as much time with a client who was about to go in to production on a short as i did with a client who was working on a feature that he was just planning on shopping to some existing contacts . 
  as i mentioned in my pm , 4 hours would be the bare minimum . 
  after i read the script ( which is not time that you pay for in this instance ) i can give you an idea of how long i think it would take me to prepare scene by scene edit notes , and how long i think it would take for us to go through them together on skype / whatever . 
  those american comedians pat and oswalt are big fans i hear . 
  maddens is pretty safe . 
  the hideout would still count as city centre or theres always the ni supporters club on shaftesbury sq, 
   to aid him with the story , giler and hill pointed cameron in the direction they thought it should take . 
  `` all they said was , ` ripley and soldiers , ''' cameron explained . 
  `` they did n't give me anything specific , just this idea of her getting together with some military types and having them all go back to the planet . '' the producers also imparted cameron with their notes and story ideas . 
  `` i 'll never forget this , '' commented cameron , `` the outline concluded with this sentence : ` ** and then some other bullshit happens . ' **, 
  aliens : and then some other bullshit happens . 
  what a tagline !, 
   i think what is important is that we recognise the value of jobs to belfast , '' [ arlene foster ] said . 
  great input , arlene . 
  this after he already refused to look in to my eye this morning !, 
  na i had this problem last christmas . 
  it 's online or nowt i think . 
  so / r/northernireland then . 
  to be fair , someone else shouted that out from what i could see, 
  seems harsh to direct the comeback at corbyn when he was n't even the heckler . 
  the game mechanics are good craic . 
  lots of csgo , bf4 , some rocket league and lan party stuff too :, 
  that 's how i roll, 
  i 'm not too picky about rolling out on fatter tyres if i cba changing them but another wheelset sounds like a good idea . 
  any recommendations ? 
  nice one cheers, 
  wish it was in first person for that authentic helmetcam feel . 
  clean the fuck out everything with muckoff and water once a week . 
  dry that shit off . 
  oil all the shit that moves ( except discs except discs ) try not to get too much oil on the shit that does n't move . 
  if shifting has been less than awesome that week , check cables . 
  if they 're too flaccid then fuck them out and install new cables . 
  if replacing rear derailleur cable then cry and swear and oh my fucking god just work ( maybe that 's just me ), 
  once you 've got the tension right and you 've emotionally recovered you 're good to go . 
  if brakes not brakey enough that week , look at the pads . 
  if unsure , get new pads . 
  if discs ... 
  i just got mine and so far they work great . 
  check brake pull too . 
  if too weak , replace cables ( hopefully with less anguish ) if too hard them loosen cables but this only happened because you over tightened them last week so get your head in the game . 
  check wheels are still wheeling . 
  if wheels not wheeling 100 % straight , loosen and rehouse them . 
  if still not straight either take them to some guy to get them trued or fuck them out and buy new ones .
