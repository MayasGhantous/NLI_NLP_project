  or true them yourself like some kind of mechanical wizard . 
  make sure there 's still enough rubbery shit left on your tyres . 
  if not , you know what to do by now . 
  look at your chain . 
  if it 's too flaccid then fio . 
  new chain . 
  you can get a doohickey to measure this from wherever you got the rest of your bike doohickeys . 
  look at your cassette and chairing . 
  if the spikey bits are / too spikey then replace that shit . 
  if replacing that shit , replace chain too so that everything plays nice together . 
  this is probably mostly wrong / very incomplete but it 's more or less what i do most weeks and my bike has n't killed me . 
  yet . 
  in reality , my voice is a bit more like [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/5zvgpbjlsxg?t=30s ) . 
  i 've got my own yard and hose ( ladies ) so i do it there . 
  i know almost nothing about this stuff beyond my own half-assed system detailed above . 
  haha thanks !, 
  just the tip please, 
  nothing since uni has helped me develop as a writer more than working as a script reader . 
  it wo n't pay the bill full time ( at least it does n't for me ) but it 's a handy thing to have when you 're short a few quid between other jobs . 
  i read for ni screen in belfast , but i would get in touch with as many screen agencies as you can ( there are quite a few in the uk ) and bigger production companies to see if they need anyone . 
  if you know your way around the production tools in final draft i would consider asking the same people about script trainee / assistant gigs , too . 
  good luck !, 
  i mixed it with the pruple tropicana , back in the day . 
  was pretty decent iirc . 
  i bought the collectors edition and even the figurine that came with it broke . 
  genuinely the worst # 60 i 've ever spent, 
  who was the chaser tho ? 
  i literally touched one of the arms of the powerloader and it fell off ... 
  human rights are more likely to come from unicorns than the tories . 
  in first year at uni i had a nemesis and i did n't even know it . 
  i had this great way of appearing to contribute to tutorials without actually doing any work , i would just wait for someone else to contribute and then `` constructively '' criticize their contribution in some shallow way that gave the vague impression that i knew wtf was going on . 
  i thought it was pretty harmless , our grades did n't count towards our degree in first year and i figured everyone was just bullshitting their way through it , same as me . 
  turns out this one girl fucking hated me for always picking apart her arguments in class , she worked pretty hard and took it quite personally that i would criticize her in front of others . 
  eventually we became friends through some mutual contacts and she admitted her former hatred of me . 
  i had an arch enemy and i did n't even know ... 
  hey guys , i work on tv and film sets so i 'll do my best to break this down for those who are curious about what it all means . 
  callsheets have changed quite a bit since the advent of word processing software , but here we go :, 
  ** unit call : ** the time the shooting crew are expected on set . 
  ** insert call sheet : ** this sheet is for a day of shooting inserts , rather than a day of principal photography . 
  ** sets & scene nos : ** the scenes to be shot that day . 
  the numbering of the scenes here is notable . 
  each scene is `` lettered '' a or b , meaning that it was either added to the shooting scripts after the script was locked or was split up by the 1st assistant director for scheduling purposes . 
  given that we are shooting inserts , the latter is more likely . 
  especially as we are only shooting `` pt '' or part of the scene . 
  ** artiste/character/onset ** self explanatory really . 
  but what is interesting that the `` artiste '' is a.n other rather than ian holm , meaning that a body double is being used for the purposes of insert shots . 
  this is confirmed by the on set time of `` as required '' , as a main cast member would be given a firm call time . 
  ** department breakdowns : ** also fairly self explanatory . 
  what is interesting is that video and editorial have both been asked for playback , so a very concerted effort is being made here to match previously shot footage . 
  leading me to believe that these are inserts that were required by the edit , not simply pick-ups that fell down the schedule and had to be mopped up at the end . 
  it 's the moviola that clinches that here for me , as this is a literal piece of film editing equipment . 
  also , catering is only for 30 people , which feels to me to be an insert sized crew rather than a full shooting crew . 
  ** date : ** 22nd of november 1978 . 
  just over 6 months before release . 
  so what op has here is a callsheet for a day of `` pick-up '' or `` insert '' photography , conducted some time after principal photography ended . 
  the shots filmed that day were for the following scenes :, 
  int . 
  infirmary **, 
  featuring a facehugger prop and the famous seafood guts as well as a body double of ash . 
  the shot was most likely a close-up of ash dissecting the facehugger . 
  ** sc 149a int . 
  maintenance garage **, 
  and, 
  ** sc 135b int . 
  maintenance garage **, 
  for one of these shots , the famous motion tracker was needed ; the practical one with the working display , so the shot was likely a cu of the motion tracker screen . 
  it 's likely that the same body double was holding the tracker . 
  there are no other clues as to what the 3rd insert shot may have been that day as far as i can tell , only that it happened in the maintenance garage . 
  anyway , hope that information is fun/useful for you and/or your brother op . 
  i always keep the last call-sheet from any job that i 'm on but i do n't have one as cool as that !!, 
  our transport captain on the last big drama i did had a wayland yutani parking pass though , i believe from the set of prometheus . 
  i think i took a photo of it ( during one of my many attempts to steal it ) which i will post here if people are interested / if i can find it . 
  non-ulster fans may be surprised to discover that he is infact not retired already ... 
  i had genuinely forgotten that he was even there for that . 
  probably would have been a good shout . 
  none at all and i weigh ~ 80kg . 
  are they really going to have the team names across the middle in plain white text like that . . ? 
  it looks horrendous ... 
  googled `` retard '', 
  first result :, 
  burn !!, 
  2 weeks after my 30th , if ulster get there you can all club together and buy me a seat for my bday , yeah ? 
  yeah ? 
  now when i read this line i can only visualize [ spongebob saying it ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iedbeyxgz94 ), 
  wow , yet another reason to back the lads to the final !, 
  i remember seeing a lod of glasgow lads in the crown and robinson 's on final day , hope you had a good time in belfast !, 
  since you mentioned this i 'm thinking it maybe has slipped a few mm but i might just be overthinking it now ... 
   it 's has kung fu grip , take that grammar . 
  ftfy, 
  great game , although it furthered my confusion as to what the plot of the alien films actually was , as up to this point my main exposure to the franchise had been through the action figures ... 
  long live grammanarchy !, 
  it 's all still a bit vague , but [ this excellent article by ni greenways ] ( http://nigreenways.com/2016/01/18/belfast-bikes-branches-out-early/ ) mentions that the plans for `` phase 2 '' of the scheme will reach the council ( for approval i assume ? ), 
  by summer 16 and that negotiations are underway between the council and belfast health and social care to expand the schemes to the hospitals . 
  this seems to be separate from phase 2 ( a la the queens expansion ) but is probably dependent on bhsc coming up with the cash . 
  the nickelodeon new writing thingy requires a spec script for an existing show iirc . 
  his agent gave me a right bollocking for messing around his booking on one of my first tv jobs but i never got to meet the man himself . 
  he did do the show we were making in the end and was an absolute gent by all accounts . 
  we 're not peru , we 're northern ireland !, 
  depends on how many weird tricks they know .
