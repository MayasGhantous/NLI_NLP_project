  the only `` oppression '' they are fighting is the oppression of their right to assert the dominance of their culture over another . 
  source : lived in belfast all my life . 
  i can , but no one asked me to play :(, 
  it 's my job to find people . 
  let 's say one of them is you . 
  i spend my day on the internet searching for your digital foot print . 
  i 'll probably find your facebook , twitter or linkedin - but there is no immediacy there . 
  these services can screen out unsolicited contact like mine . 
  if you have a website , i 'll do a whois look-up , but it 's been registered on your behalf by a hosting service . 
  but i can use all these these to find out what hobbies you have , what town you live in , what bands you like . 
  i can probably use your account names to guess what username you use on other forums on websites . 
  i look for clubs relating to your hobby in your area - is there a phone number ? 
  probably . 
  i look for your username on forums for your favourite band/sports team / whatever . 
  i join the forum . 
  i message you . 
  i search your name on your local newspaper . 
  you did a fun run for charity . 
  they took your picture . 
  they have your number . 
  once i 've tracked you down , i always have the same question :, 
  `` can i talk to you about a television programme we 're working on ? '', 
  i am a tv researcher , and contributors do n't just grow on trees !, 
  haha i 'm making it sound a bit more `` hardcore '' for effect but i have done all these things in the course of a day 's work . 
  generally a producer will want a very specific contributor : `` find me someone who witnessed the king 's funeral passing through whitechapel in 1952 '' or `` find me a disabled hand cyclist in north down '' and off i go . 
  i love that the guy in the van chased you :, 
  `` come back !, 
  you have n't even had sex yet ! '',

  if this happened in 1915 then he was n't in the raf . 
  it did n't exist . 
  rfc and rnas ( royal naval air service ) merged to form the raf in 1918 . 
  rn got their own air arm again sometime around the start of wwii i think . 
  a quick look at wiki reveals he was rnas . 
  ca n't believe the irony of this article ; `` we are n't doing enough to remember our war heroes ! '', 
  remembering what branch of the military they served in would be a pretty good start ... 
  i think it depends very much on the situation . 
  i talk to strangers almost every day for work . 
  i often meet interesting people and i enjoy doing it but i almost never strike up conversations with strangers in my day-to-day life . 
  what are you looking to get out of it ? 
  cool it guys , david attenborough 's got this one :, 
  i used to hang out with this couple , the man was called mantis , the girl was called shadow . 
  they were like a supervillain duo !, 
  great people . 
  i remember sitting in the computer lab at uni back in maybe 2005 - the guy sitting beside me turned round and was all like `` holy shit dude , look at this ! '', 
  the entire wiki page for south africa had been replaced with one line :, 
  `` south africa is full of n * ggers '', 
  by the time i had loaded it up in my browser ( 2005 ie on 2005 uni pc so probably a full minute at least ) it had been restored . 
  woke up early this morning to cycle to work instead of drive . 
  felt great !, 
  hey !, 
  my girlfriend of 5 years ( who i recently bought/renovated/moved in to a house with ) and i did long distance twice . 
  once while she was studying in the states ( we are from ireland ) and once while i was teaching english in china . 
  the first time , we had only been going out for 6 months or so but we liked each other a lot and decided it was at least worth a shot . 
  the long distance thing made us work extra hard . 
  we wrote each other letters , we made mix cds and on the one or two occasions we did see each other before she came home for good well , that 's none of your business ... 
  i think it 's a good test of a relationship . 
  it was harder when i was in china because communication was harder but we made it - just put the effort in !,

  wow dude , i was just curious to know if anyone had come across it . 
  my experience in china was that most chinese were very wary/shy when it came to swearing . 
  part of me thought it might have even been a fake . 
  awesome . 
  haha i should have gone on to say `` in english '' and `` in front of their teacher '' . 
  like i said , i thought for one thing that it might have been a fake . 
  for another , i thought if anyone had come across it or one like it in country it might have led to some interesting / funny stories . 
  no problem dude , good luck !, 
  [ same as always . ], 
  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles ), 
  also it depends what you mean by `` british tv '' - though i guess the obvious answer is `` original tv commissioned by british tv networks '' . 
  it 's worth noting that game of thrones , homeland and walking dead all owe a lot to uk talent in front and behind the camera . 
  i agree that southcliffe was n't great . 
  pretty much all the recommendations in this thread so far are bang on as far as i 'm concerned . 
  i would also add that the white queen was a pretty good historical drama , with the emphasis on `` drama '' . 
  i 'm surprised no one has mentioned doctor who - it has its lovers and haters but if you want something british and bursting with ideas , it 's hard to go wrong . 
  i 'm actually wearing a captain morgan t-shirt as i read this ... 
  i would take it off but i 'm at the office . 
  seems like guywithoutabeard has this one covered - i just wanted to stop by and say welcome to belfast , hope you have a great time etc !, 
  edit : / r/northernireland is worth checking out also if you have n't already . 
  are you kidding me with this shit ? 
  how did they not go for `` the bible belt is buckling '' !?!?!, 
  i am ashamed to share my first two initials with this website . 
  i mean more ashamed than i already was . 
  i 've been that guy !, 
  apologies to grips everywhere . 
  what all you fools do n't realise is that the trade in value of aliens : colonial marines is actually - # 45.20, 
  okay , let 's say a jewish terrorist group did what you suggest and blew up a power plant in nazi germany as a response to nazi oppression . 
  here is how it would likely effect the relevant parties :, 
  ** nazi government ** : the government use this incident ( and any others like it ) to justify their continued persecution of jewish `` terrorists '' . 
  ** german people sympathetic to nazis ** : germans who believe the nazi propaganda that jews are evil now have a juicy news story to justify their beliefs . 
  ** german people on the fence ** : might begin to believe the state propoganda . 
  afterall , the jews blew up a power plant . 
  germans were/could have been killed . 
  what will they do next ? 
  ** german people who are sympathetic to jews ** : it is harder for them to defend their views to other germans in the light of jewish terrorism . 
  why do they support a group of people who want to kill innocent german power plant workers ? 
  i have seen this happen first hand in my own country .
