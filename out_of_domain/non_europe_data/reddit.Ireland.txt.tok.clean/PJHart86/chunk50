  it 's really not a big deal and you 're treating it like it 's the end of the world , basically is what i 'm saying . 
  fair enough . 
  i did happen to grow up around a lot of armed men ( police and british army here in northern ireland ) who had an historical record of not exactly having my community 's best interests at heart but even so i find it hard to wrap my head around the idea that simply being in the presence of an armed cop somehow feels worse than the fairly mundane challenges that most of us will experience at some stage or other in our lives , like getting mugged or having one 's heart broken or losing a family member , for example . 
  i think i 'll wait for a full report from the time travel commission before making my mind up on that one,

  for a compelling and entertaining ( though incomplete ) look at the early punk scene in northern ireland , i highly recommend the film [ good vibrations ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se17u5ml9dq ), 
  emerging from the period of civil unrest / war known as [ the troubles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles ) in the 1970s , the scene produced legends like the undertones and stiff little fingers . 
  one the one side you had bands like slf writing political songs challenges those involved on all sides of the conflict while on the other you had bands like the undertones who wrote upbeat songs for kids who were fed up with politics . 
  this is as good a place as any .

   `` i can hear the glass crunching on kristallnacht in the ghettoes of warsaw and vienna when i hear that , honest , '' he said .

  if you 're going to invoke history to make your ( entirely valid ) point , at least do it right . 
  i do n't think there was ever a ghetto in vienna per se though, 
   first ghetto opened in 1939 , if you want to be pedantic .

  short film ? 
  my 2c ( as script reader/assistant/editor ), 
  get rid of the continued : and ( continued ) lines when a scene gets split over a page . 
  these are redundant . 
  the 3 way split screen and the series of shots should still be formatted as proper scenes with proper scene headings , int . 
  prison and int . 
  sex shop ( ? ), 
  respectively . 
  the series of shots scene just reads like a normal scene to me ... 
  i mean when you think about it all scenes are just series of shots . 
  to give it the jump cut feel , maybe just describe each shot on a new line ? 
  it 's up to you really but `` series of shots '' is a pretty useless descriptor in what is ultimately a blueprint for a series of a few hundred / thousand shots ... 
  you 're right but the scripts still have to come from somewhere and it 's a much more forgiving medium in terms of story . 
   the ships have long range scanners and will probably wake crew to investigate derelict crafts or sos-signals . 
  hey ... that sounds like a good inciting incident for a movie ... 
  i wrote a short animation last year that you can see online [ here ] ( https://vimeo.com/121025464 ) . 
  for me the 2 main challenges were telling the story without any dialogue ( maybe not a restriction you have ) and telling the story in the most economical number of shots . 
  the director and artist were ( rightly ) trying to distill the story down to something that was achievable for them in terms of schedule and budget . 
  i actively engaged in this process to the point where i was even offering up my own cuts of the preproduction animatic . 
  i 'm really proud of the finished product and i learned a lot about visual storytelling and economic storytelling . 
  in terms of the differences in the script , i just wrote it as a shot list in word rather than as a script document and i think this was the right call - it allowed the other team members who are n't familiar with script editing software to jump in and make their own edits . 
  you can compare [ my final story doc ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b0hnylvsh7-xnhpjm1fun2vqaxc/view?usp=sharing ) to the finished product above .
