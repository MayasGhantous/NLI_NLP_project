  scrummaging looked pretty good under what were grim conditions at times , including a couple when hendy was in the sin bin . 
  i 'd put him ahead of ross and white as things stand currently . 
  yup . 
  you can see the 2 cars passing this point are both out of their lane . 
  it does sync with fitbit but in a rather convoluted way ... 
  or prometheus ? 
  the router i have from them ( superhub 2 i think ? ), 
  is a steaming turd . 
  i have to knock it in to modem mode and back to router mode every couple of makes to make it behave itself otherwise i get seriously wild ping spikes between all my devices and the router itself . 
  also the wifi drops out sometimes . 
   you 're talking about a table read ? 
  or are they actually acting out the action lines ? 
  yeah there 'll be an actor serving as a narrator so i do n't want to make the action too sparse or utilitarian ... 
  yeah i should do that , i 'm just wondering how long is too long from an audience 's pov . 
  obviously i have a lot more tolerance for my own drivel than most ... 
  good advice . 
  what 's different about this rather than a table read is that this an industry showcase for the script so i do n't want the action to be too utilitarian or lifeless but i do n't want the audience listening to the narrator drone on for page after page either . 
  if you 're recently graduated and irish passported you could try the j1 graduate visa for the states then try to get sponsored . 
  looks like a map of ireland that ca n't get its shit together,

  now sports . 
  did n't he retire ? 
  nothing to see here , move along . 
  forgot about dave !, 
  the amount of ulster on this sub right now feels jinx-inducing ... 
  hate to be that guy but this is an aliens tattoo rather than an alien tattoo ... 
  if he really was talking about the whole uk , surely the overwhelming response would have been : who cares ? 
  [ here 's an article that discusses the links between the rira and eastern european organized crime , which dates back to before their split from pira .

  dat stride tho, 
  uk writer here too . 
  this is just my tuppence but i would exhaust every free avenue we have here at home ( and there are quite a few ) before paying to enter a much more crowded and less culturally familiar market with tbl . 
  there 's the red planet prize , bafta rocliffe , screenwriting goldmine , the channel 4 screenwriting fellowship , the bbc tv drama writer 's programme ... 
  if you 're striking out in all these avenues then you 're probably better off taking it somewhere less competitive , rather than somewhere more competitive like tbl . 
  what about your local film board ? 
  mine has a [ coupe ] ( http://www.northernirelandscreen.co.uk/sections/216/new-writer-focus-2015-2016.aspx ) of [ good ] ( http://www.northernirelandscreen.co.uk/news/10289/storyland-2016-open-for-submissions.aspx ) development schemes . 
  if you are n't signed to an agency yet , you should also be asking the companies that are reading the script to refer you to agents , even if they are n't going to option the work . 
  i 've managed to get a few agents to read my work this way and having an agent will massively help when it comes to getting your script read by companies that actually have a bit of clout when it comes to getting stuff on to the networks ( unlike most of the ones with open submission policies ) . 
  hope that helps !,

  [ the bravest of the brave , ladies and gentlemen . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_war_crimes ), 
  this is something i 've been paying particular attention to in my latest rewrite . 
  during the first draft , a lot of the character beats were a bit generic while i was still figuring out their motivations and relationships . 
  luckily , my development exec is very good at spotting this stuff and we 've just now ( on draft ... 5 i think ) weeded out what i hope is the last of it . 
  if , like me , you like to feel out your character dynamics a bit as you go i think this is great advice but do n't be afraid to write the generic version on the first pass , just make sure you continually revise them as you get a better handle on the characters . 
  credit to me for writing it , 
  you 're too kind , 
  thanks !, 
  i should really get back to writing on it . 
  you would never guess that summarizing other people 's stories is part of what i do for a living , would you ? 
  [ yeah it 's a good thing we did n't use soldiers on the ground to support the police right here in the uk for the guts of 40 years ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_banner ), 
   no different to any other war, 
  that 's a whole separate can off worms . 
  but the army was explicitly deployed in ni to support the local police , not to conduct an offensive campaign and this was obviously the subject of much controversy at the time and ever since . 
  it was n't until 1976 that that the ruc was officially given primacy and took the lead in conducting anti-terrorist operations , with soldiers deployed in support of police officers rather than conducting their own operations . 
  obviously something they would be allowed to do in `` any other war '' . 
  members of the british special forces , in particular the special air service ( sas ) , were also deployed , sometimes in highly controversial circumstances . 
  on a number of occasions they were accused of operating a `` shoot-to-kill '' policy , firing on terrorists or suspected terrorists instead of arresting them . 
  again this would not have been the least bit controversial in `` any other war '' . 
   using soldiers for policing never ends well as they 're trained to kill enemy soldiers . . 
  i 'm just agreeing with you , man . 
  [ over half the people killed by british forces in northern ireland were civilians . 
  and in regards to the law ( in this case the echr , which is the subject of the article linked above ) the uk regularly opted out of parts of it during the troubles :, 
   in order to combat what the respondent government described as `` the longest and most, 
  violent terrorist campaign witnessed in either part of the island of ireland '' , the authorities in northern ireland had exercised from august 1971 until december 1975 a series of extrajudicial powers of arrest , detention and internment . 
  the united kingdom government had sent the council of europe 's secretary general six derogation notices concerning those powers during that period . 
  - [ echr factsheet -- derogation in time of emergency ] ( http://www.echr.coe.int/documents/fs_derogation_eng.pdf ), 
  the fact that this mechanism for derogation already exists and has already been used many times by the uk government in relation to its armed forces makes me think that its just being used as a means to justify dumping the echr wholesale .
