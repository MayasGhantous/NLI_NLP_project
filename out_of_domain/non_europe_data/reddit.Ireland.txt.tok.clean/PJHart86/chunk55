   he really does n't seem to be such an ultimate badass as he believes himself to be . 
  this is pretty much the whole point of his character .

  yeah i noticed this too , i record very long bike rides ( 4 hour - 11 hours ) and strava would crash at least 5 or 6 times . 
  i now use ventoo ( which has better pebble functionality and less battery drain ) and upload to strava from there . 
  questionable grounding, 
  exquisite , is n't it ? 
  [ this list seems pretty accurate by my experience ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/belfast ) though i have no idea where the data comes from . 
  a quick look at [ property pal ] ( https://www.propertypal.com/ ) shows that you can definitely get a decent 1 bed apartment fo around # 400 p/m, 
  as other users have said , you may not need a car depending on where you want to live and what you do for a living . 
  though i personally find the buses in town fairly bad , the inner city is fairly compact and there is a good public hire bike scheme . 
  / u/simon2it is exactly right , your best work - most relatable theme , most interesting moral question is going to be something very personal that you care deeply about . 
  birdman and shame are great examples of really strong voices finding unique themes but are intimidating scripts to compare yours to . 
  with that in mind , i would like to offer another ( non-competing ) viewpoint . 
  there are a lot of universal themes and morals that crop up in popular stories , from the greek tragedies to the rerun of spongebob that was on this morning . 
  even if a theme or moral is not groundbreaking or relevatory , the audience will still respond positively if it is deployed skillfully . 
  the simplest stories with the strongest morals that get retold again and again are obviously fairy-tales and , helpfully , much of modern screen story structure also derives from them so matching a fairy-tale moral up to your screenplay might not actually be that hard . 
  to unpack this further and explore specific examples , i would recommend the book [ into the woods ] ( https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/b00adnp2p2/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=utf8&amp;btkr=1 ) by john yorke , which explores the universality of storytelling and will hopefully help you identify strong recurring themes that you will be able to apply to your own work . 
  no worries , i feel like i shill for that book a lot on here but of they many many screenwriting books i read in college and beyond it is the one that has had the most positive effect on my own writing . 
  the more familiar you are with screenwriting theory ( sounds like you are very ) the more you 'll get out of it i think . 
  screenplays like birdman and shame are absolutely what you should compare yourself to if that 's the kind of thing you want to write . 
  if you want to write a comedy road movie , you should maybe ease off on the existential dread . 
  i 'm not saying the dude was smoking anything illicit but the troubles came a bit after the 1950s ... 
  i do agree with you , i was just being too glib . 
  i would definitely recommend birdman and shame to anyone studying screencraft ( especially in regards to theme ), 
  all i 'm saying is that your theme does n't have to be as original or profound ( as these 2 award winning screenplays ... ) for your script to still be good . 
  yeah that 's a good point actually , it 's really the execution of both those films that really elevate them to the next level . 
  so ... are you saying paramilitaries were putting people off taking drugs in the 1950s or not ? 
  my ( albeit loose ) understanding was the the ira was concerned with internal disputes and later the border campaign while the pira , inla , uvf and uda were all formed in the 60s and 70s . 
  gchq gon na be all over this shit !, 
  game over , man :(, 
  i prefer a larger screen to kindle so that i can read scripts comfortably at 1:1 scale . 
  i just bought a cheap android 10 '' tablet for # 90 or so .

  [ `` somebody '' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-diplomats-deaths-theories-putin-kremlin-a7602201.html ),

  [ i get about 8 hours out of this one on its lowest setting . 
  they made a few . 
  [ this one is the foxiest .

  quality colour choices, 
  lol this is literally a thread about undisputed voting figures , how can they be biased ? 
  take your alternative facts elsewhere . 
  haha love this , earthy vs rotten !, 
  i think the lowest setting is around 70 lumens ( i threw the box away and it does n't list it on the site ... ) which is n't brilliant but also is n't nothing . 
  for daylight riding , i get between 4 and 5 hours of flashing at 210 lumens out of it ( which is why i bought it ) so if you need it brighter and can charge it on the go , it 's still a very viable option . 
  on a side note , i also like that it looks like a piece of shit bike light from a supermarket so i do n't mind leaving it on the bike when i go in to places . 
  those knog lights look good , i get emails from planet x about them all the time so will give them a go if/when my current flashers die . 
  it 's always going to be a trade-off between brightness and battery-life ... 
  i guess if op is looking for something that will last all day he is looking for something that will be effective in daylight too ... 
  with the vi00 720 , what i tend to do is run it flashing at 210 in daylight / dusk hours and then run it at 70 or 140 when it gets dark . 
  if i am on a 9 hour courier shift , then i will usually need to top it up with a portable charger ( much more cost effective option that constantly buying aas imo ) for at least an hour during that time to keep it alive . 
  70 is okay for city night riding if you wear reflective gear and have flashers on your clothes / helmet or whatever ( and if you ride safely and not like you 're on a grand tour ) . 
  i do it all the time for my job and have lived to tell the tale . 
   that is why i said this sub and not this thread . 
  ... in direct response to a comment claiming that the unionist share was 48 % instead of 44 % , implying that the percentages had been incorrectly calculated in an act of anti unionist propaganda , when in fact the real number ( as anyone with key stage 3 maths can tell you ) is 44.4 % . 
  so my original point stands , you are confusing facts that you find uncomfortable with anti unionist propaganda . 
  he said the sub was full of anti unionist propaganda and the example he used ( the 44 / 48 percent thing ) has been proven false so what exactly are you agreeing with ? 
  obviously opinions differ on the minimum acceptable brightness for bike lights ( [ the independent 's bike column ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/gadgets-tech/best-bike-lights-under-50-9782829.html ) happens to agree with me , but i could probably find as many sources claiming as you have that nothing less than the same brightness as a car headlight is acceptable ), 
  ... but this is a thread about battery longevity and a 700 lumen light would need a car battery to power it all day ... 
   relying on clothes to be seen is definitely not something that should be recommended, 
  this is dangerously inaccurate in my opinion . 
  good reflective clothing will dramatically improve your visibility at night time to drivers . 
  a good microprismatic retroreflective material reflects light back to the source ( give or take 30 degrees ) at up to 40 % efficiency . 
  meaning that if you are in the path of a 700 lumen car headlight , ** 280 lumen is reflected back at the driver ** . 
  the surface area of something like the [ proviz reflect360 + jacket ] ( http://www.provizsports.com/en-gb/reflect360-plus-mens-cycling-jacket.html ) is many orders of magnitude great than any bicycle light that it is possible to buy and the results [ certainly are dramatic ] ( http://road.cc/sites/default/files/cropped/preview_500/images/proviz%20reflect%20360%20jacket/proviz%20360%20jacket%20lit%20up.jpg ) . 
  on its own , 700 lumens coming out of a ( i 'm being generous here ) 4cm ^ 2 lens is nothing but a small , perhaps even blinding , point of light that can actually make it difficult to judge the speed of an oncoming rider and possibly even obfuscate hand signals made by that rider ( no science to back that one up , just from my own experience of working at night as a courier ) . 
  [ a study actually has shown ] ( http://road.cc/content/news/95353-study-says-cyclists-should-make-themselves-seen-reflective-clothing-not-hi-vis ) that reflective material applied to vertically moving elements of a rider ( ie ; lower legs and ankles ) are much more likely to attract the attention of drivers ( i myself wear a reflective and red flashing band on my drive side ankle ), 
  so while i ca n't argue that brighter is better when it comes to bike lights it certainly is n't everything . 
  thanks for the steer on the knogs , will maybe skip them unless they have a good sale on ... 
  i hear they make lights that you can put on bicycles now ...

  the grip is better than gators ( which i used to run ) the puncture protection could maybe be a bit better but i do ride a lot of fairly bad roads .
