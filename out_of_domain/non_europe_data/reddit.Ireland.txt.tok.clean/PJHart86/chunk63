  i 've seen a few posts and comments in the last week or so generate massive karma based on a false quote attributed to marcus aurelius . 
  i think as atheists it behooves us to always check and double check our facts , when it is the scientific method that we often employ to argue against those who like to use vague unattributable quotes from antiquity and style them as fact . 
  ** the quote : **, 
  `` live a good life . 
  if there are gods and they are just , then they will not care how devout you have been , but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by . 
  if there are gods , but unjust , then you should not want to worship them . 
  if there are no gods , then you will be gone , but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones . '', 
  ** the `` source '' ( full text ) ** : http://classics.mit.edu/antoninus/meditations.mb.txt, 
  ** wikiquote misquote description ** :, 
  no printed sources exist for this prior to 2010 , and this seems to have been an attribution which arose on the internet , as indicated by web searches and rationales provided at `` marcus aurelius and source checking '' at three shouts on a hilltop ( 14 june 2011 ), 
  this quote may be a paraphrase of `` since it is possible that thou mayest depart from life this very moment , regulate every act and thought accordingly . 
  but to go away from among men , if there are gods , is not a thing to be afraid of , for the gods will not involve thee in evil ; but if indeed they do not exist , or if they have no concern about human affairs , what is it to me to live in a universe devoid of gods or devoid of providence ? '', 
  from meditations , book ii , but the quote in question has a quite different meaning .

  hi guys , i 've been lurking here for a while now and i 've finally decided to try my hand at something above and beyond standard maintenance . 
  i 've been riding this steel-framed raleigh pioneer for a few months now and it 's a fine commuter bike . 
  i 've been taking it on longer and longer rides outside of my normal commute and after damaging the handlebar in a fairly nasty crash , i 've been thinking about upgrading to more of a touring set-up . 
  bike as it currently is :, 
  the plan is to add mud guards , an extra bottle cage and butterfly handlebars . 
  i 'm thinking these :, 
  from what i can tell , my grip-shifters and breaks should fit okay on these but i wonder if anyone has any advice when it comes to fitting these bars - best position , best tape to use etc ? 
  anything else i should consider doing to this bike to make it friendlier for long distance rides ? 
  budget is limited but i 'm open to ideas !, 
  thinking about fitting some trekking bars to make my commuter more of a tourer but i 've seen them fitted a few different ways ... does anyone here have any tips ? 
  hi guys , i finished my first properly funded short this year as a writer / producer and i 've started to send it out to festivals . 
  i 'm really proud of the film and i was excited to start getting it out to festivals but the first three i entered ( 1 at home in ireland , 2 in the states ) have all knocked it back . 
  i 'm no stranger to rejection / disappointment in the industry but i 'm just wondering if this matches other peoples ' experiences ? 
  i 'm curious , as it will probably effect whether i send it back for more post work or just keep paying the entry fees and hoping for the best ... 
  thoughts ? 
  i was thinking iceland , but it shuts at 6 , 
  also - are there any other script readers on here ? 
  any tips ? 
  the movie is called bad dolphin - it 's about a dolphin who wants to get revenge on mankind . 
  he hates all humans . 
  except hookers . 
  i read a * lot * of scripts and i can honestly say i have n't had this much fun reading one for years . 
  could do with some feedback on this for a deadline at the end of the month . 
  happy to do a script swap with someone on a script of similar length . 
  i 'm targeting a uk audience if that makes any difference but interested in any and all feedback , in particular regarding character and pace . 
  thanks for looking !, 
  so my commuter is nothing special , a chromoly raleigh pioneer trail , at least 11 years old that i rescued from a coworker 's back yard . 
  most of the upgrades i 've done to it so far have been thanks to the hand-me-downs i get from my brother who no longer commutes and rides mostly just for fitness now and the latest parts to come in to my possession from him are a set of shimano wh - r550 700x23 wheels and schwalbe blizzard sport 23mm tyres . 
  now although these may not be the world 's best wheels , they 're certainly better quality than the stock 700x25 that came with the bike , which seem to have been bounced up and down a few kerbs in their time - the front in particular does n't seem to be spinning as freely as it should ... 
  ... so anyway my question is what wheels / tyre combo do you guys ride on ? 
  am i going to notice a serious drop in comfort if i switch from 25mm to 23mm wheels ? 
  i do n't need a massive performance boost or anything but since these wheels fell in my lap i was just wondering if you guys think it 's worth my effort of switching them out ? 
  i collected these from local twitter feeds and even managed to get a few myself !, 
  it was a great weekend in belfast !, 
  it was a twitter discovery . 
  perhaps someone can report whether or not they actually sell mars bars ? 
  hi guys , i know most of you are u.s based but i thought i would share my experiences dealing with the bbc writer 's room for those uk and irl users . 
  for anyone who is n't aware , the [ writer 's room ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/ ) is an excellent resource , offering scripts , articles and opportunities for writers in the uk . 
  every year they have open submissions for drama , comedy , children 's etc , with successful writers being offered further mentoring and sometimes even writing work on existing bbc shows . 
  this was my first time submitting to them and i submitted a 1hr adventure/historical drama series ( with serial elements ) called * black irish * , an earlier draft of which i posted over at / r/readmyscript [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/readmyscript/comments/1znz7g/tv_pilot_blacks_irish_wwii_drama_52_pages_action/ ), 
  i just got my feedback a few days ago and here is what i learnt :, 
  * they received approximately 1300 scripts . 
  * every script is read as far as the first 10 pages by a bbc reader . 
  * if a script survives this first sift , a different reader will read the first 20 - 30 pages . 
  * if the reader likes what they read , the script is `` longlisted '' and is read in its entirety , though it is n't clear from their email if it is read by the same reader , a number of different readers or neither . 
  ** edit : ** 5 % of submissions reach this stage, 
  * the writers of longlisted scripts receive feedback on their work . 
  it 's only a few paragraphs ( at least mine was ) but better than nothing and it does n't cost anything . 
  * i do n't know what happens next , as i did n't make it any further . 
  i assume there is a `` shortlist '' after the longlist ... 
  it took around 5 - 6 weeks for me to get the feedback after the submission date closed . 
  that 's pretty decent turn around in my books , as i am still waiting to hear back from other competitions that i paid cash money to submit to around the same time or even earlier . 
  the feedback was around 250 words . 
  i do n't mind sharing mine , since it was mostly positive :, 
   this is an enjoyable and tense drama , following the story of a group of irish anarchists on a mission to defeat fascism . 
  this is clearly a writer who is adept at telling a story packed with action and suspense . 
  the pace is fast and there are plenty of twists and turns to keep the viewer guessing . 
   the characters need some development in order be really engaging . 
  they need to feel more rooted in what motivates them , where their loyalties lie , and what they believe in . 
  this material is in the script , but it could be drawn out and used to greater effect . 
  the drama would be richer if we understood these people better . 
   whilst the story is impressively pacy , it is sometimes in danger of leaving its viewers behind or allowing them to stop caring about what is happening . 
  it might be nice to find some moments of stillness , when the viewers might be drawn in and engaged in the action . 
  rather than just unravelling ( albeit a very skilfully told ) plot , there might be more levels to be explored . 
   the history of ireland and their neutrality during the second world war is an interesting context for a drama that could be explored further in the script . 
  it would be interesting and effective to know more about the ideology of each of the characters and how that fitted in with ideologies that were current in ireland and the uk during world war ii .
