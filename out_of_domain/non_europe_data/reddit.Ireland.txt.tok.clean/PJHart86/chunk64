  hopefully that is useful for some of you !, 
  i found the whole experience to be a fairly positive and rewarding one , considering how easy the online submission is , the cost ( nothing ) and how quickly they got back to me . 
  i would encourage anybody who is eligible to check the submission windows and submit their work !, 
  ** disclaimer ** : * a quick look through my post history will reveal that i work freelance as a script reader for bbc northern ireland but i 'm not affiliated with bbc writer 's room in any way other than as a writer . 
  is nowhere safe ? 
  respect . 
  these lyrics do not appear in the version performed by joss at wembley stadium this sunday but in my opinion are some of the most potent anti-war lyrics ever written :, 
  now young willie mcbride i ca n't help but wonder why, 
  do all those who lie here know why they died, 
  and did they believe when they answered the cause, 
  did they really believe that this war would end wars, 
  well the sorrow , the suffering , the glory , the pain, 
  the killing and dying was all done in vain, 
  for young willie mcbride it all happened again, 
  and again , and again , and again , and again .

  writing my first big chase sequence and was just wondering if anyone has any tips or personal favourites they 'd like to share . 
  only stipulation is that they have to be from `` the north '' as it were . 
  we 're looking for someone this weekend !, 
  another one for all you uk guys . 
  i recently ordered a script report from [ rocliffe ] ( http://www.rocliffe.com/development_services.php ) , the guys who organise the [ bafta rocliffe new writing forum ] ( http://www.bafta.org/initiatives/supporting-talent/rocliffe ) and thought i would share my experience here in case anyone was considering using them . 
  as a working script reader myself , i hope my insights will be useful !, 
  i paid for a full feature script report . 
  i sent them the first draft of a 100 page action / sci-fi script . 
  [ you can read the report i received here . 
  ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b0hnylvsh7-xcwzackkzalvjmk0/view?usp=sharing ), 
  first up , a full feature report costs # 99 . 
  pretty steep ( i myself make between # 50 - # 60 for feature reports ) but these guys read a lot of new writing so i thought it would be worth it . 
  they have other , cheaper services , such as a first ten pages report for # 40 . 
  over-all though , prices are steep . 
  when i write a report , i write a log-line and synopsis for my development exec so that she knows what the script is about without having to read it all . 
  rocliffe provided the same for me , the writer . 
  at first i thought it was a bit pointless , since obviously i know what my own script is about but in retrospect it 's a really good way to see if all the character development and exposition is coming across as intended and , since i paid for it , i plan to use their synopsis as the basis for the next draft of my treatment . 
  synopsising is by far my most hated part of script reading but the rocliffe reader did a good job on my script , which has many moving parts and an ensemble cast . 
  the reader 's comments are generally quite thorough . 
  the reader has obviously paid close attention to the script and directly quoting lines from the script with corresponding page numbers is a good way of focusing the writer 's attention on specific issues and is something i plan to incorporate in to my own reports going forward . 
  the reader rarely points out a flaw without offering some kind of solution . 
  this is something i am often hesitant to do in my own reports except in the most general of terms . 
  the reader here offers specific suggestions for changing staging and dialogue and , although it comes off as a bit prescriptive , the reader has given them some thought and the suggestions are all at least worth considering . 
  the notes on tone and character were particularly useful . 
  the conclusions , however were a little vague . 
  although i did n't pay for a `` dry run report '' ( fake studio coverage , basically . 
  same price ) it still would have been nice to know if the script is in recommend , consider or pass territory as it currently stands . 
  a lot of suggestions for further work were made but it is n't clear whether they would be considered deal-breakers or not . 
  maybe i should n't be complaining , as this was n't specifically advertised as part of the service but is just something i myself do at the end of every report . 
  over-all , i would rate this service as worthwhile . 
  the price-point is quite high so i would only recommend the service to those with a script that they are 100 % planning to carry forward . 
  i plan to enter this script in to [ ni screen new writer focus ] ( http://northernirelandscreen.co.uk/sections/216/new-writer-focus-2015-2016.aspx ) , [ bbc writers ' room ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/send-a-script ) and at least a couple more competitions this year so i 'm considering the money well spent . 
  previously : [ my experience of the bbc writer 's room call for drama submissions ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/screenwriting/comments/27qh2o/my_experience_of_the_bbc_writers_room_recent_call/ ), 
  my mission to evaluate the screenplay competitions and services that i partake in continues apace , this time it 's the [screencraft.org sci-fi screenplay competition 2015 . 
  ] ( https://screencraft.org/scifi/ ), 
  as you probably know by now , i am uk based . 
  i 'm usually a bit wary of entering these big u.s. based competitions because it seems like basically buying a big expensive ( $ 49 ) lottery ticket but since the scifi window opened just as i finished a draft of a scifi screenplay i thought i would give it a punt . 
  the prizes are :, 
  * 50 semi finalists : a 50 % discount code to writerduet pro, 
  * top 5 finalists : circulation and personal recommendation to a network of over 60 hollywood managers , agents , producers and development executives and a lifetime license to use writerduet pro, 
  * 2nd place : all that and 500 bucks plus a phone call with a top literary manager . 
  * 1st place : all that and 2 large plus a phone call with a top literary manager . 
  so your $ 49 just buys entry . 
  if you want any feedback you have to pay an extra $ 50 for it , which is fairly standard for comps like this as far as i understand . 
  ** update ** : apparently i paid for feedback when i submitted to the action contest . 
  i have to say for $ 50 the feedback report i received was cheaper and is probably more detailed than [ the one i received from rocliffe ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/screenwriting/comments/3aebyd/discussion_my_experience_of_ordering_a_rocliffe/ ) and caught some formatting and copy errors that the rocliffe reader missed . 
  the only direct communication i 've had from screencraft has been the confirmation of my submission , which stated that quarter finalists would be announced in `` late early october '' . 
  either way [ the quarter finalists were announced ] ( https://screencraft.org/2015/09/05/screencraft-sci-fi-screenplay-contest-quarter-finalists-announced/ ) a couple of days ago so they 're at least a month early . 
  i guess that 's good ? 
  maybe they did n't get the volume of scripts they expected . 
  so you do n't get an email to tell you if you made the quarter finals . 
  you do n't get an email to tell you that the list is up ( unless it got gobbled up by the weird new google inbox thing but nothing is coming up when i search ) which i think is kind of lazy for a paid competition . 
  ** update ** : i found an email in my spam folder which i assume is the same as the one / u/richardmhp received . 
  it informed me that the quarter finalists had been announced but did n't specify if i had been successful or not . 
  so when i finally see the list posted on twitter i follow the link and , assuming i would have heard something had i been selected , do a quick ctrl + f for my name and am pleasantly surprised to get a hit !, 
  i 'm a screencraft scifi screenplay competition 2015 quarter-finalist , yay !, 
  so what does that actually mean ? 
  well , if you followed the link above you may have noticed that there are a fucking * lot * of quarter-finalists . 
  263 by my count . 
  you may have also noticed that they received only 800 submissions ( in contrast , last time i submitted bbc writers room received 1300 ) so if we do the maths then a whopping 1/3 of all total entries have made it to the qfs . 
  if ( read : when ) i get knocked out at this stage i will be interested to see what happens next in terms of communication . 
  my suspicion is that they give a large number of people a bit of hope and then give them the hard sell on script services when they do n't make the next cut , but i 'll report back if / when this happens . 
  ** update ** : / u/bananabomber informs us that he did n't get a hard sell ( read : any harder than normal ) on script materials after being knocked out at this stage of one of their previous competitions . 
  again , there is no indication as to when the 50 semi-finalists will be chosen so who knows when that may be . 
  over-all i 'm not overly impressed with how this competition has been run so far but i 've probably been spoiled by the slick ( and free ) bbc writers room service and i 'm still willing to be proven wrong . 
  is anyone else here on that big old list up there ? 
  anyone got any previous experience with these guys ? 
  i 'm not home but will be back for xmas.is it working ? 
  have any drivers been kneecapped ? 
  what 's the general craic ? 
  i got an email before christmas saying that they would let people know during january . 
  i just submitted my tax return so that must mean that january is all but over ... any news ? 
  [ literally this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1pt_srme2i ) well played . 
  so there 's a rehearsed reading of one of my scripts happening at the end of october . 
  it 's a sci-fi action movie and it 's coming in at around 112 pages , which i think is a good length considering that most summer blockbusters ( not that this is one ) come in at well over 2 hours these days .
