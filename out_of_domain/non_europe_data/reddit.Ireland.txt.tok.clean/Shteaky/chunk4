  cheers, 
  i could be talking out of my ass but i think html5 is kinda like a video , have you tried tapping the image the same way you would press play on a youtube video ? 
  we do n't go to ravenholm . 
  what exactly did you say happened ? 
  something similar has just happened to mine today except on the left side with a big crack down the middle on the outside , and a bit of plastic actually broke off . 
  i got mine around february and was worried that this does n't fall under their warranty . 
  ( plus i 'm having a bitch of a time trying to log into their website or even create an account to get in touch with customer support , it just stays on the same page when i click `` create '' or `` log in '' . ), 
  thanks for replying , you 've lifted a weight off my shoulders . 
  i had spent most of the afternoon reading bout how bad logitech were when it came to warranty and any damage what so ever ( from day to day use ) , and was worried i would have to shell out for a new pair . 
  forgot to add `` skip to '' before 39:30 . 
  or simply being in dublin on a rainy autumn evening . 
  personally i like making my own with just the flour and water for simple sauces and using egg for richer ones . 
  by the way its `` we look the balls '' the same as `` we look the business '' , no comma . 
  hey op , what was the image ? 
  ( it and the mirror have been taken down ), 
  ah interesting , thanks . 
  the gobshite . 
  hate to beak it to you op but the boat part of that gif is fake , [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uytsnlhw8j8 ) is a realistic example of a chicken steadicam . 
  now this is truly unsettling , makes my skin crawl . 
  then you might like mega64 's [ cosplayerz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o1_naaarw0 ) videos . 
  edit : their latest https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orkaga4cqso, 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/gamernews is good for more of the news without the bullshit , not sure about discussion though . 
  man i miss the early days if that sub , [ i mentioned the phenomenon of the influx of new people upvoting only those kind of whisper videos that was met with a good few upvotes and equal downvotes . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/18drkr/asmr_featured_on_slate_the_strange_rise_of_the/c8e63qg ), 
  pity they did n't go into tournement mode , you can change the rules to different variants . 
  turbo mode with no swords is infuckingsane !, 
  i 'm just gon na add my name to the many who would like to volunteer for this `` social experiment '' . 
  honestly i find mana boots more useful as its fills some mana need till you get euls , also you wont really have time to use tranquils because of the damage you can do with fate 's edict and right clicking . 
  there are 2 types of people in this world , those who are careful and plan ahead while coordinating with their team to maximise damage output as well as disabling the enemy in a correct fashion , and those who spam the shit out of everything they have hoping something works . 
  i belong to the latter unfortunately . 
  it 's because reddit does n't allow self promotion and often shadow bans people who do . 
  bit of a ridiculous way of doing things as all people have to do is make another account to post it with and make no mention that it 's them . 
  indubitably, 
  they were taught in the school of life , man . 
  the animators psychic pebbles and spazkid would be the funniest shit . 
  ( shoutout to / r/sleepycabin ), 
  no ty, 
  did you try laying more mines till they exploded ? 
  spazkid u r fuckin perfect m8 . 
  you 're a flower . 
  you 're also a rainbow and a river . 
  you are the manifestation of all perfection and i want to i do n't fucking know . 
  i want this to not sound gay , but you are fucking perfect , spazkid . 
  ty for listening, 
  but in all seriousness do n't change . 
  from what i gather the main gripe some people had was the occasion you 'd start a new story in the middle of someone else ( eg . 
  might morphin episode but jeff took the piss out of you enough to you cause you to cop on ) . 
  remember you ca n't please everyone , but you can always please me . 
  they are talking about batwoman , not catwoman . 
  do n't worry , all those silly fucks that are being naysayers have been downvoted , this is the hypest shit . 
  from your library right click dota 2 , go into properties , then to the dlc tab and uncheck the box that says reborn . 
  if you do want to try reborn and are running a 64 bit os you need to launch the 64 bit version of reborn from the dota steam folder , its far more stable and has very good performance . 
  it would n't delete local content , just stop updates . 
  [ here is how you can create a shortcut to launch the 64 bit version of reborn ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/3ab2su/psa_dota_2_reborn_defaults_to_32bitdx9_heres_how/ ) , do give it a try , if you can run source 1 dota you can run reborn easily . 
  today is a good day, 
  so what size will you be having ? 
  clearly we have to look west to the new world as our only hope for good dota . 
  but there is no reason to not go for a one man blackhole early if you can get someone like their carry or mid , you are literally wasting a skill point if you just wait for a 5 man one at all points int he game . 
   yeah but that 's not at all what i said , i just said early game . 
  you might want to reread both of our comments because using blackhole early game is exactly what we were both talking about . 
  also even late game one man blackholes can be more than worth it , if you catch their mid or carry , make them use bkb to try fight or escape aswell as having the followup to kill them . 
  if you havent used her yet , give zora ( uses 2h weapons and light armour ) a try from interesting npcs , she should be in that mountain pass next to bleak falls barrow . 
  i literally never took another follower in my playthrough , she was perfectly lighthearted without being annoying . 
  / r/jokes showing everyone they have a sense of humour . 
  space created, 
  ppd , asphyxiation by sodium chloride, 
  actually irish but no worries , you mexicans get that mixed up all the time . 
  would you like fries with your andy salad ? 
  `` andy salad '', 
  [ full album on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-1myxvp1ok ), 
  for neeson ( if you 've seen `` the grey '' ) how about something like `` wolf hunter/killer '' or for something more general to his recent films just plain old `` slayer '' . 
  it bothers me more than is should but maybe put the leper over on the same side as the vestal and crusader ? 
  thematically having a holy character face the same direction as the abomination just feels out of place . 
  would make a great wallpaper , got a version at a higher resolution ? 
  what does a [ town ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/letterkenny ) in ireland have to do with his pun ? 
  can anyone who has had a pair of theses and the hd 598s recommend one over the others ? 
  i prefer the the superior [ guide to 1916 by the rubberbandits ] ( https://youtu.be/cnm8esrbgrm?t=277 ) ( you might want to skip the first couple of minutes if the humour is n't your thing ) . 
  same except i started the day after . 
  i 've been stuck on o&s for the last 3 days , and gone through 30 humanity on that fight alone -_-, 
  ye for some reason no matter how quickly i 'd kill one ( literally under 20 seconds ) , solair would just die a few seconds into the second phase no matter who i 'd kill first : /, 
  cheers for the advice but turns out all i needed was a controller ( was playing on m & k and literally beat them on the first go when my controller came , even killed ornstein last ) and to be over level to fuck !, 
  dunno if it 's related to your situation but keep an eye on the letter and number next to your signal bar to make sure your not being switched over to something other than 4g ( anything other than `` 4g '' ) . 
  the only way i know to fix it everytime is to go into settings -  more networks -  mobile networks -  network operators -  search networks . 
  takes a few minutes at most while it searches for network but it should reconnect you to the 4g network when it finishes , if not just join it from that screen . 
  calling it irish is far more common and perfectly acceptable . 
  amd or nvidia ? 
  you might want to check out / r/artisanvideos , not all the content is there is like that but sometimes you get something great . 
  edit : also david bull 's youtube channel , a canadian woodcarver in japan , has a lot of great videos in this style . 
  was n't a tri-spiral was it ? 
  xtz earphone 12, 
  if you 're a man and have rolled on multiple occasions , there is a chance you have come across the infamous e-dick . 
  for the uninitiated , e-dick is basically sever erectile dysfunction caused by use of mdma . 
  it may not happen with every use and can have varying degrees of severity ( ranging from not being able to get a boner to complete shrinkage and inability to piss ) . 
  i was curious as to whether anyone knew the exact science behind it or had any idea how to remedy it ? 
  thanks for your time . 
  just got battlefield there last weekend on the origin sale for pc and was looking for someone to go through the coop campaign on hard with someone ( which is hard to do with matchmaking seeing as it 's quite a bit after bf3s release . ), 
  i 've a flexible playing schedule so whether you want to do it in one go or mission by mission over time i do n't mind . 
  if there 's a better sub to put this please let me know !, 
  i know its something small but i hate the fact that now when you drop in on a spawn beacon your parachute automatically opens at a certain height , leaving you out in the open for far too long and ruining any chance of stealth you may have had before . 
  what 's you 're opinion ?
