  i 've added in pullups , weighted dips and hangcleans . 
  is there anything else i should add in after 4 months on the program ? 
  it 's probably worth noting that i do n't feel as if i 'm starting to plateau and am not currently on any supplements . 
  thanks for any replies , advice is always appreciated . 
  so i got my lumia 1020 a few days ago and i updated to black . 
  the battery life seems incredibly poor . 
  i have to charge twice a day sometimes . 
  for example , this morning i browsed reddit for 45 minutes and then played solitaire for an hour . 
  by that time i 'd gone from a full charge down to 54 % battery left . 
  before i bought the phone i looked at various reviews and they said you 'd get about 12 hours from the phone with moderate use . 
  that 's definitely not the case with mine . 
  is it something to do with the black update ? 
  or could it be that either my phone is faulty or the reviews i watched lied ? 
  hi everyone ,, 
  i recently got into learning c # with the goal of creating apps for windows phone . 
  i 'm currently following [ this ] ( http://channel9.msdn.com/series/c-sharp-fundamentals-development-for-absolute-beginners ) online course . 
  however , whilst it 's a great resource and i 'm kind of starting to understand , i 'm not really sure how i can practice what i 've learnt . 
  the videos do n't really offer practice other than copying out the code that the guy is writing . 
  are there any tutorials basically for absolute beginners that might give me a way to practice without being so difficult or intimidating for a beginner that they end up making me give up ? 
  tl ; dr what are some good beginner exercises i can do when learning c # ? 
  me : philip seymour hoffman died today . 
  dad : oh wow , how did he die ? 
  me : they think it was a drug overdose , he was in rehab last year . 
  dad : oh rehab ... was that a good film ? 
  *** friend 1 's status : *** no you ca n't take down flappy bird , my highscore is only 8, 
  ** friend 2 : ** he 's taking it down ? 
  i only started playing 2 days ago, 
  *** friend 1 : *** lets all go to his internet house and burn it down with internet fire !, 
  ** friend 2 : ** what if he has his firewall up ? 
  so i was at a concert last night and got some great videos . 
  however , for some reason when i transfer them to my pc there 's a huge loss in quality . 
  it 's great on my phone and sounds amazing but now that i 've transferred them to my pc it sounds crap and definitely not as good as on my phone . 
  what 's the best way to get a video to my computer without loss of quality ? 
  do any of you have a specific stretching routine you do on your off days ? 
  i 'm becoming more experienced with lifting weight and i 'm beginning to get a couple of niggles here and there so i think it 's time to introduce a stretching routine to keep me healthy in the long run . 
  any tips on what i should be doing ? 
  * like the title says , this is the first time that i 've put thought into what i 'm writing so i 'm a little nervous about putting it out there . 
  in saying that , i 'm looking forward to some constructive criticism so thank you in advance . 
  enjoy !, 
  michael exhaled , shivered and folded his arms across his naked torso . 
  he remembered how he had almost slipped on the ice coming up here , how thankful he had been then to finally step onto the grass . 
  however , his now bare feet were certainly not thankful . 
  the sun had just risen and was peeking over the horizon . 
  despite the cold , this might turn out to be a nice day . 
  what was in front of michael ? 
  it was almost as if a body was floating into the land . 
  or was it a body swimming out into the water ? 
  the land itself , where michael stood , was a body , swimming out into a body of water . 
  yes , it was a glorious morning . 
  a shrill sound pierced the air , disrupting the tranquillity . 
  `` ah yes '' thought michael , jump . 
  after all , that was the reason he was here was n't it ? 
  as he began to walk forward michael felt the wet , cold grass between his toes and it tickled his feet in a way that was not entirely enjoyable . 
  however , this feeling was not to last long as michael stepped onto the pier . 
  he squinted in the sun and wondered if this was what people meant when they said they felt alive . 
  the cracking of his toes as they curled over the edge of the pier sounded loud to michael . 
  the creaking of the wood and slow washing of the water against the struts of the pier made him realise where he was . 
  at that moment , while standing at the end of the pier , michael certainly felt something . 
  despite the cold , he was sweating all over . 
  his heartbeat was so strong that he wondered if he may be about to collapse . 
  he recalled how he had felt before giving the speech he had made when running for class president . 
  how strange it was to remember something so trivial at a time like this . 
  with deliberate breaths michael looked up . 
  `` come on , jump ! '' called the voice . 
  it was almost as if the voice had shattered the precious glass bubble that michael felt he was inside . 
  there was something so fragile about this place and that voice was ruining it . 
  nevertheless , he stepped forward and took one more deep breath . 
  then , michael du place jumped . 
  for the past few days i 've been getting an error message saying `` oups an error occurred , sorry about that '' . 
  it happens on wifi as well as mobile internet but everything seems to work fine when on wifi . 
  it 's just on mobile internet that it does n't work , even though i still have connectivity . 
  i have tried signing out and back in and also reinstalling the app but to no avail . 
  anyone else getting these kinds of errors ? 
  will there be a full scale war where the uk and us get involved or will it all be resolved peacefully ? 
  hi everybody . 
  so a few years ago i had a fungal infection on my skin ( i think it was tinea versicolour ) . 
  it was quite bad and i was incorrectly prescribed a strong steroid cream by the doctor in my college which got rid of it . 
  it came back with a vengeance and when i went to my gp he told me that it was tinea versicolour with some eczema on top . 
  he prescribed me a topical cream called travocort and this cleared it up right away . 
  he also told me to use silcock 's base as a soap substitute and moisturiser . 
  that was about a year ago . 
  a couple of weeks ago i started getting some dry skin and decided to use some silcock 's base to try and calm it down . 
  however , after maybe 2 days of using it i noticed that i was getting red marks in all the places i 'd had tinea before . 
  the marks looked the same but did n't itch the same way the tinea did nor was it affected by sweat or anything like that ( the tinea had really stung if i sweated when i had it ) . 
  here 's picture of what i have now http://imgur.com/2ojn4sk . 
  i 'm just wondering what it might be and if it could be to do with the silcock 's base . 
  if it is , what are some other good moisturisers ? 
  i thought silcock 's base was as basic/skin friendly as they get . 
  i thought maybe because i was using the silcock 's base after showering it might be making my skin very moist and a perfect breeding ground for fungus but like i said , it does n't feel the same way that it did last year when i had tinea . 
  i should also mention that my skin seems itchier after i shower , like it 's tighter and it 's only my arms that get itchy . 
  note : i realise this is n't a place to get medical advice . 
  just i live in ireland and it costs $ 50 to see my gp . 
  that 's $ 50 i do n't have because i 'm a poor student !, 
  thanks for any help you guys might be able to offer . 
  hi everyone . 
  i used to have eczema as a child and now as a 21 year old i often get dry skin and get pretty itchy although i never get rashes as bad as when i was a child . 
  it 's more of a mild inconvenience than anything . 
  i 'm currently trying to join the military and obviously do n't want my skin itching all the time , even if it does n't hinder my day to day activities , so i am looking for a good ( but reasonably cheap ) moisturiser to keep my skin in check . 
  i tried silcocks base which is a soap substitute that you also apply when you get out of the sure ( not sure if you have it in the u.s. ) but it worked so well that all the extra moisture gave me a fungal infection . 
  that 's now cleared and i 'm looking for a good cheap moisturiser to help me out .
