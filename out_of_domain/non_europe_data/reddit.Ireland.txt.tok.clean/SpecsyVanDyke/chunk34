  thanks for any responses !, 
  so i noticed today that my phone was draining battery super fast for some reason . 
  i read that i could reset it by holding power and volume down buttons . 
  i did this and reset the phone . 
  however , when it turns back on it none of the buttons are responsive . 
  the screen is responsive , all of my apps and data are still there but the volume buttons , 3 actions buttons etc will not work . 
  if it 's a case where i have to completely reset my phone is there a way i can back it up to skydrive because it seems apps native to wp like mail/text/settings etc wo n't open . 
  i just get a loading screen and it goes back to the previous page after about 5 seconds . 
  thanks for any responses .

  about a 2 years ago i had quite a bad fungal infection . 
  my gp prescribed travocort and it cleared up . 
  he gave me a 6 month prescription and during the summer i have had to use travocort for a week or so maybe once every month or two . 
  i have a couple of questions . 
  is it dangerous to use a steroid/anti fungal cream for such an extended period of time ? 
  my prescription recently ran out and i was given another 6 month one . 
  will i always get a fungal infection in the summer now ? 
  it first appeared 2 years ago and was kept in check last summer with travocort . 
  i 'm trying to join the military and obviously a yearly fungal infection is n't really ideal . 
  do these things go away or is it a case where my skin is susceptible to them ? 
  i had eczema as a child and now and again i get quite dry skin . 
  last week i used a moisturiser called [ silcocks base ] ( https://www.myhealthbox.eu/en/medicine/ovellelimited/silcocksbasecream/807138 ) which my pharmacist said is basically like wrapping your skin in cling film to keep the moisture in . 
  this led to the fungal infection coming back however a few days of reapplying travocort has started to clear it . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2ojn4sk.jpg ) is a picture of what the fungal infection looked like . 
  it also appears on my shoulders , inside of my elbow and sometimes my upper/forearm . 
  is it going to be a case of balancing my skin so that it is dry enough to keep fungus away yet moist enough that it does n't itch because of the dryness . 
  sorry if this is confusing , i 'm not sure how else to put it . 
  thank you for any responses . 
  hi everyone . 
  so i am trying to create a very simple app that calculates somebody 's one rep max for weight lifting . 
  the user enters the amount of reps performed and the weight lifted and the app calculates their one rep max using a formula . 
  i have written a windows console application in c # which works perfectly but i 'm unsure how to implement this code into a wp app . 
  i have a basic knowledge of c # and a very limited knowledge of xaml . 
  are there any tutorials i can follow that will help me understand how to do this ? 
  thanks, 
  so i 'm trying to make a windows phone one rep max calculator for weightlifting . 
  there are only 2 variables which are input by the user - the weight lifted and the reps performed . 
  my app would need two text boxes for the two values to be entered and another for the result to be displayed . 
  these values are then used in a formula which is performed when the user presses the calculate button and displayed in the 3rd text box . 
  i have a console application written in c # but i 'm unsure how to implement it into xaml . 
  i 'm finding bob tabors wp8 app dev for beginners quite hard to follow , i find it difficult to learn watching videos . 
  i also think his series is a little advanced for what i want to achieve . 
  can anyone point me to some simpler tutorials/resources that may help ? 
  thanks, 
  me : `` wow , that graveyard is huge '', 
  dad : `` it 's a popular one that '', 
  me : `` oh really ? '', 
  dad : `` yeah , people are dying to get in there '', 
  how playable would a flight sim be when using an xbox 360 controller ? 
  is it a lot more difficult than using a joystick ? 
  so i just got fsx and a joystick . 
  it 's great so far but i want to get some mods . 
  there are so many . 
  i 'd prefer to stick with some free ones . 
  i 'm looking for things like fspassenger although i understand you have to pay for that . 
  is there a free version ? 
  also some scenery mods would be nice in order to make the game look a little nicer . 
  basically any essential mods/addons/extra content that you feel are necessary . 
  thanks for any help, 
  so i got rex essentials + overdrive hd today . 
  it does n't seem to be installing textures to fsx though which is very annoying . 
  i ca n't find anything anywhere on the web so thought i 'd ask here . 
  thanks for any help, 
  i 'm going to my first boxing session on tuesday and have 2 questions . 
  what can i expect in my first training session ? 
  how soon is it realistic for me to expect a competitive fight ? 
  the reason i 'm trying out boxing it is not only to keep fit but for the competitive side of things and i already ca n't wait for my first fight . 
  why are there so many different weight classes ? 
  surely there are advantages and disadvantages to being light or heavy . 
  if an 80kg guy were to fight a 60kg guy then the heavier guy would be slower but more powerful while the lighter guy would be faster but with less power . 
  does this not make for a fair fight ? 
  or does more speed not compensate as well for having less power or vice versa ? 
  so this coming may i will be graduating with a degree in civil engineering from dublin institute of technology . 
  i 'll be glad to finish because i do n't enjoy the course at all and now i 'm starting to worry because i do n't want to work in that field . 
  my ` plan a ' is to join the military as an officer . 
  however , it 's quite hard to get into and while i 'm confident that i 'll make it i want to have a back up plan . 
  i currently have a part time job in a supermarket and if the army does n't pan out i do n't want to get stuck in a rut and end up there for the next few years while i get my shit together . 
  a bit about me . 
  i really want a job that 's hands on and is practical . 
  i like the idea of city planning but i do n't like the idea of working for the city council processing planning applications on peoples extensions and things like that . 
  i want something that 's going to be interesting and varied . 
  i like design and have always loved archetecture and think i 'm quite good at it but i 'm worried that because i do n't have a portfolio or a history in design it would be hard to break into the field , especially because everybody these days has degrees already and they 're probably not as indecisive as i am . 
  in the long run i 'd like to work for myself but for now i would like to get into a job that is practical and gets me using my hands rather than sitting behind a desk dealing with lots of paperwork etc. 
  i 'm sorry if all of this is a bit vague and my post is too long but to be honest i 'm not entirely sure what 's out there and what kind of jobs exist . 
  i 'm really just looking for some suggestions to kind of kick start my research so i can find an area that i might be interested in and may be qualified for . 
  thank you so much for any help and again , sorry if this post is too long !, 
  i have been boxing for about a month and sparred for the first time on tuesday . 
  i also sparred today but i could do with some help . 
  there is a big tournament coming up so the coaches in my club are a bit preoccupied with the people who are fighting in that ( which is most of the club ) . 
  when sparring i keep getting told to keep my hands up . 
  i 'm trying my best but i find that my right hand keeps dropping and leaving me wide open . 
  is there a drill i can do to help me keep my hands up or is it just something that comes with time ? 
  nobody is going too hard on me in sparring because i have n't been doing it long but when i do get hit in the head it 's quite sore and i can definitely feel it . 
  afterwards it does n't hurt but when i get hit it 's like shaking your head around when you have a headache . 
  this makes it kind of hard to keep punching .
