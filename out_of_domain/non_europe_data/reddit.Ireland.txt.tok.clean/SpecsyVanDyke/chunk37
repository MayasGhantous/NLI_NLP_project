  i just spent a month in vietnam on my first solo trip and got home a couple of days ago . 
  i felt physically sick when the plane was landing and i miss travelling so much that i 've been miserable since i got back . 
  i was glad to see my family and friends but other than that i feel shit about being back home . 
  is it normal to feel this way ? 
  if i could i 'd jump on a plane right now but financially it 's not viable . 
  i cracked the screen on my lumia 1020 recently and brought it to my local phone repair shop . 
  after a few weeks of waiting ( a combination me being away and them not being competent enough to have the phone ready before i left ) i went into the shop to collect my phone . 
  they had replaced the screen but told me the motherboard was gone and the phone was useless . 
  because they did n't have my lumia ready before i left to travel they gave me an iphone 4 to use which i cracked so i paid for the screen replacement of that and nothing else . 
  i went home and remembered that the phone had worked before i handed it in to be repaired ( i 'd used it with the cracked screen for about 5 days ) . 
  logic led me to believe that if the phone worked before i gave it in for a screen replacement and it worked then but does n't work now then they must have done something to the phone and broken the motherboard . 
  i went back to the shop today to confront them about it and they told me that sometimes the motherboard can just go without warning when the screen is damaged or the phone dropped . 
  i do n't really buy this excuse as i used the phone with cracked screen for 5 days before i went to them for a repair . 
  does anybody know if this is possible to happen with lumia 1020 motherboards ? 
  if not then i think the shop owes me a replacement and i 'll be going to the small claims court about it . 
  thanks for any help . 
  i studied civil engineering for 3 years in ireland and came out with an ordinary bachelor degree . 
  however it is not a b.a. 
  the actual full title of the qualification is bachelor of engineering technology in civil engineering . 
  i see a lot of posts mentioning bachelors degrees as a requirement to teach in certain countries and i 'm a bit confused as to whether my degree will count . 
  in ireland we have a national framework which can be seen [ here ] ( http://www.qqi.ie/pages/national-framework-of-qualifications-%28nfq%29.aspx ) . 
  my degree puts me at level 7 . 
  the title of my degree is not a bachelor of arts which is why i 'm a bit confused . 
  when people mention ba 's do they specifically mean a bachelor of arts or just a recognised degree from a recognised institution ? 
  it seems as if nearly every ancient and medieval civilization used capital punishment for all sorts of crimes . 
  did nobody question the morals of it or were people just more barbaric ? 
  beginner golfer here . 
  i do n't have a bad shot in particular , i 'm pretty inconsistent . 
  really i 'd just like to be able to hit a consistent straight shot . 
  thanks for any insight you can provide and sorry for the grainy video quality !, 
  apologies if this is n't the correct place to post this , please redirect me if necessary !, 
  so i 'm stuck in a dead end job in an off licence ( liquor store ) and i feel as if i 'll never get out . 
  i feel underappreciated here , the management is poor , i have little motivation to come into work and everyday feels like a monday . 
  i recently got a pay rise but it was $ 0.73 and after being here for nearly four years it felt like more of a kick in the teeth than a reward . 
  i have a degree in civil engineering and despite having interviews i have n't been successful . 
  i did n't get the best grades and every interview i go into i feel like i have to lie to get the job and i hate bluffing because i know i 'll be caught out . 
  at the moment i am not even motivated to apply for jobs . 
  whenever i try to vent to my parents they just tell me to apply for jobs but they do n't understand how shit i feel everyday when i come home from work . 
  i 'm just not motivated to do anything when i come home except watch tv and go to bed . 
  i work 12-10pm 5 days a week and it just sucks the life out of me leaving me unmotivated to do anything about my situation . 
  i really want to just quit but need the money . 
  plus i do n't want to burn bridges as my boss is really my only decent reference as i 'm only 22 . 
  edit : thanks for the replies . 
  being able to vent , even if it 's to strangers online , is very helpful . 
  makes a change from the pressure everybody around me is putting me under to find a real job . 
  i had my first lesson a couple of weeks ago and have my second lesson coming up in a few days . 
  i had problems getting forward shaft lean so i 've been working a lot to try and get that shaft lean . 
  the problem is i feel like my swing has got worse . 
  before i was very inconsistent with where my shot would go and now i feel as if i 'm hitting more bad shots but they are the same bad shots over and over . 
  also trying to get shaft lean my instructor told me to use keeping the ball low as a visual and focus on transferring my weight from back to front . 
  trying to do this on the range seems so unnatural and my swing does n't really feel comfortable anymore . 
  really what i 'm trying to ask is does it get better ? 
  right now i feel as if i 've become worse but is it a case of 1 step backwards 2 steps forwards kind of thing ? 
  the question is what would you like to think happens . 
  we all have a pretty good idea of what actually happens , grim as it may be, 
  i 've just started playing a few weeks ago and after two lessons i 've been shooting in the low 90s . 
  i 'm just wondering how much not playing as a child ( i 'm 22 ) will hinder how good i , or any other late players , can get as i 'd like to get at least to single handicap figures . 
  sips , i love you . 
  i love your content and i have a lot of respect for you because you 're so interactive with your fans which is kind is how i hope you 'll see this post . 
  i work 9-5gmt and i ca n't find the time to watch the streams . 
  sim city was one of my favourite series so you can only imagine how excited i was when i saw how amazing skylines was when it came out and when i saw you were doing a series on it . 
  as i 've mentioned , i do n't get time to catch the streams . 
  actually i do sometimes get a chance to watch the re-uploaded versions on the weekend however i feel like it 's not worth it because the stream is so interactive . 
  on the rare occasion ( there has n't even been one this week ) that you do put up a cities episode i feel extremely alienated . 
  i feel like you 're more connected with with the people that watch the stream but i also ca n't help feeling like you feel as if you have to keep sipsco coast going and that you slightly resent it . 
  at the end of the day big guy , i 'm just trying to say that i feel a little left out with all the streaming you 're doing . 
  i only have time to watch an hour or so a day and i feel as if the streamed content caters more to those who have a lot of free time . 
  tl ; dr i feel left out because i do n't have time to watch streams, 
  well i shot a 44 for 9 holes . 
  i normally shoot high 40 's for 9 holes so this is definitely a pb . 
  the only thing is i feel like it 's a bit of a hollow victory . 
  i only get time to play 9 holes after work during the week because the local public course i play on is always jam packed on the weekend and it 's not fun to play as a single ( they do n't have any marshalls ) . 
  i 've applied to a country club with 2 past captains as my references but until i get accepted i 'm stuck playing 9 holes during the week . 
  is it fair to say i could have shot 88 if i shot 44 on 9 holes ? 
  i 'm just watching some of mark crossfield 's course vlogs and he keeps referring to `` butt point '' . 
  from what i can gather it 's some kind of putting technique and it 's something to do with the let . 
  i have n't actually performed any 1rm attempts but based off a calculator my 1rm 's are bench - 100kg / squat-130kg / deadlift-150kg . 
  i started a 9-5 job about 2 months ago and there is a gym right around the corner . 
  i 'm 23 years old and have been lifting on and off since i was about 17 . 
  i get an hour for lunch which usually equates to about a 40min workout when you factor in shower time etc. 
  my basic goal is to have a nice physique . 
  for me specifically that means losing body fat . 
  right now i 'm at about 15 % bf but i 'd like to get that lower so that i can start to see some definition in my physique . 
  i enjoy strength training and doing compound movements so i would like to keep that aspect in my training regime if possible . 
  here is my routine :, 
  ** workout a **, 
  * back squat 5x5 *, 
  * bench press 3x5 *, 
  * pull ups 3 sets *, 
  ** workout b **, 
  * power cleans with front squat 5x5 *, 
  * military press 3x5 *, 
  * ring dips 3 sets *, 
  monday - workout a, 
  wed - workout b, 
  thurs - cardio, 
  fri - workout a, 
  i alternate workouts on a bi-weekly basis . 
  i have n't included deadlifts in my routine because i feel as if i ca n't get the correct form . 
  at one point i was deadlifting 140kg for reps but i knew my form was poor .
