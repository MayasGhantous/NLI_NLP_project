  thanks for any help, 
  where are some nice , isolated spots to camp in ireland ? 
  i live in leinster but anywhere in the country would gain my interest . 
  i 've done quite a bit of camping on campsites but am looking to get into wild camping after doing it on a recent holiday . 
  needless to say i wo n't ruin your favourite spots by lighting fires and littering . 
  i 'm just looking for a few nice spots i can take a couple of beers and chill out . 
  pm me if you prefer , i understand you may not want to share on a public forum . 
  thanks a lot, 
  i 'm not sure if this is against the rules or not and if so then please remove !, 
  most rugby clubs have some kind of fundraiser going at various stages during the season and i thought it might be nice if we could post links etc here and support each others clubs . 
  my club is running a last man standing competition [ here ] ( https://www.runlastman.com/competitions/3051-mu-barnhall-rfc-mu-barnhall-rfc-s-last-man-standing ) . 
  if people would like to post links to similar fundraisers for their clubs i 'd be happy to sign up to some . 
  hopefully this could catch on and everyone will benefit . 
  i recently read a great article about the 1-3-3-1 [ here ] ( http://www.the42.ie/analysis-australia-1-3-3-1-shape-england-2016-2825557-jun2016/ ) . 
  i was just wondering if there 's anywhere i can find more articles like this about different tactics etc, 
  thanks,

  i 've always wanted to be a pilot but have never pursued it because of colour blindness . 
  i have only ever done the isihara test and failed but i 've heard that you can still pass a class 1 medical doing other tests so i have decided to look into it a bit further . 
  is anybody here colour blind but have still passed their medical ? 
  can you share your experiences ? 
  i have heard the testing centre at london gatwick has some advanced equipment that can give you a level of colour blindness rather than a simple yes or no . 
  thanks , i hope i 'm not being too vague . 
  edit : thanks for all the replies , i think i 'll go for the medical before doing anything and see how it goes . 
  i 'm currently deciding whether it 's worth upgrading my gpu or processor first . 
  my budget is around $ 250 . 
  i game quite a bit and would be happy with 1080p 60fps . 
  i also some photo editing and programming which is why i 'm considering a processor upgrade . 
  i play games more though so that would be my priority . 
  currently i have :, 
  * ** psu ** - antec vp450p 450w 12cm ocp/ovp/scp / opp pfc rohs psu atx2 .3 dual rail, 
  * ** gpu ** - asus nvidia geforce gtx 750 ti graphics card ( 2gb , gddr5 , pci-express 3.0 ), 
  * ** processor ** - intel core i3 processor ( 3.7 ghz , 3 mb , lga1150 socket ), 
  * ** mobo ** - gigabyte ga-h81m-h motherboard ( ddr3 , sata 600 , micro atx , usb 3.0 , hdmi , socket 1150 ), 
  thanks for any help . 
  i recently got back to the gym after a 5 week break . 
  it sounds weird but i 'm already noticing a difference in my body after a 3 sessions back . 
  not muscle mass but i look more lean and defined . 
  now obviously i know there ca n't be changes that quickly so it must all be in my head but i just wondered if anyone experienced this phenomenon before,

  my secret santa match lists this sub as one of his favourites and i 'm wondering what would be a good gift.it seems that since the first time i looked at his profile he 's added this sub to his favourites so i assume he 's a beginner . 
  what 's good for somebody starting off ? 
  budget of around $ 50 . 
  thanks, 
  mainly play lucio but am pretty flexible, 
  never had a problem playing a pirated copy before . 
  picked up a genuine copy of hoi4 in the steam sale and i 'm barely getting 30fps . 
  anyone know why that could be ?

  my girlfriends american mother had a stroke a while ago which has left her paralysed on one side of her body . 
  due to circumstance its been decided that her mother should move to ireland as my girlfriend and her brother live here so it will be easier to take care of her ( she has no other family in america . 
  she has irish citizenship as well . ), 
  we 're just struggling at the minute to figure out what kinds of resources are available to us . 
  are there daycare places she can go ? 
  is there a way for us to get a live in nurse or someone that can help us take care of her mother ? 
  sorry if those post seems naive or like we have n't done any research - we 're both fairly young and we do n't really know where to start with something like this . 
  edit : thanks everyone for all the replies , we have plenty of information to follow up on now which should make this more manageable, 
  my friends dad has a business meeting in okayama for 5 days so we 're able to get free accommodation there for the duration . 
  we arrive on 29th may and leave 2nd june ( we will spend a couple of days in tokyo at this point ) . 
  we were wondering how we can maximise our time in okayama in order to see as much of japan as possible . 
  we will have to return to okayama each evening so we can keep costs down and make use of the free accommodation !, 
  as mentioned before , we will go to tokyo after okayama so no need to include this . 
  some of the main places we would like to go are kyoto and hiroshima . 
  we would love to climb mt. 
  fuji but as i understand it can still be quite dangerous when we will be there . 
  i have already looked into a rail pass which seems like it will be essential given our situation . 
  i was under the impression that we will be able to travel quite far out of okayama on day trips given how fast the trains are . 
  thanks for any help you can provide . 
  i 'm having an issue with my home network where the wireless connection is suffering dropouts . 
  this only happens when the powerline for my desktop is plugged in . 
  as soon as i unplug it everyone can get wireless internet again . 
  this has seemingly happened out of nowhere . 
  hope someone can help . 
  i would provide more info but i 'm not sure what to provide . 
  thanks, 
  according to most powerlifting programs i 've ever read about eating a lot of food and gaining weight is basically the answer to getting stronger . 
  a lot of times it seems as if it 's more important than the work in the gym you do . 
  why is this ? 
  i 've been bulking the last few months because i really want a 180kg squat . 
  i weigh 96kg right now and my squat is at 140x5 . 
  will i really have to get to some kind of monstrous size to be able to squat 180kg ? 
  i 've seen plenty of people on yt who appear to be the same weight or lighter than me squat that kind of weight . 
  i saw a comment in the rant wednesday thread where the guy was hoping to hit a 100kg bodyweight in order to get his 100kg bench . 
  i hit that when i was around 87kg . 
  why is there such a difference ? 
  if we have apparently have to eat so much to gain strength how does anyone ever reach high numbers ? 
  it 's gotten to the point where eating is emphasised so much that i feel like if i 'm not gaining weight then i ca n't gain strength . 
  is it possible to gain strength while maintaing bodyweight ? 
  rather than having to gain weight to lift more . 
  i do n't want to be fat but i want to be strong . 
  and i 've seen plenty of people who are n't fat that can lift what i want to be lifting . 
  as the title says . 
  i 've been learning python for a couple of months but i have n't been able to create anything useful . 
  i 'd like to be able to create a website that uses the real time information of my cities public transport network to tell you on average how often your train is late . 
  i 've looked at their api and its possible to look at any train at any date in the past 5 years ( i think ) and tell when it arrived vs when it should have arrived . 
  the only thing is i do n't really know where to start with turning this into something useful with python . 
  ideally i 'd like to be able to enter a train time at a certain station and then display something like `` this train is late y % of the time by an average of x minutes . 
  where would i start ?
