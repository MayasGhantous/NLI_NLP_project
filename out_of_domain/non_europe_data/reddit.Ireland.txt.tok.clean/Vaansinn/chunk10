  that being said , it would be much more interesting to know who generates more revenue . 
   i was only plat 4 and my support dia 5 vs a pair of diamonds , skill may have been a factor in there . 
  skill was a factor in there . 
  it 's always annoying to go into melee range against thresh so i would recommend to pick a support with range like janna , sona or maybe even taric . 
  he can stun without too much risk . 
  edit : spelling, 
  edit2 : i can imagine lulu might be quite good too . 
  hog still exists in the form of sight stone . 
  but instead of the gold you get the wards . 
  it was supposed to be a support item ( like most gp5 items ) but got picked up by mostly everyone . 
  with the change they wanted to focus this item more on supports and give them 1 more free slot . 
  i think you get most of the stuff wrong . 
  let me explain :, 
  ** hate about servers going offline . 
  ** it 's not so much about the servers being offline , it 's about the difference for na , eu and br . 
  while na is having minimal downtime + compensation , eu and br almost getting no information . 
  it 's about inconsistency and favoritism . 
  ** hate about the new rank system . 
  ** the hate about the ranked system revolves mostly about the promotion series . 
  people complain that they are not put together with people who care about this series . 
  promotion are the 3 most important games you 'll have to do in every tier and if you are put in with people who are not in promotions and do n't care about you or just want to see you fail ... that is frustrating . 
  ** hate about noobs in team . 
  ** no one hates riot for noobs . 
  a better tutorial and easier accessable runes/summoners/champions might actually help though . 
  ** hate about riot not giving gifts to people who have spend a lot of money . 
  ** i actually have never seen anything about this topic but in every business you give a little extra to people who buy more . 
  riot does that by providing a bonus when you top up your account . 
  so , i do n't know where this comes from . 
  ** hate about riot having bots to answer questions on the support center . 
  ** it 's ok to have the first one or two emails answered by a machine but if you ca n't access your account or got banned , a real response with a little bit more insight would be nice to ( at least ) feel like they actually care . 
  edit : formatting, 
  riot should make this an ingame tool tip :, 
  `` people always make mistakes . 
  this is no reason to report them since it does n't violate the summoner code '' . 
  looks like a lot of people disagree : /, 
  i think this might answer a lot of your questions : http://www.gamebreaker.tv/esports/league-of-legends/riot-talks-the-future-of-league-of-legends-e-sports/, 
  this interview is 3 month old and it took 5 seconds to find through google . 
  please do your research and prepare yourself as good as possible otherwise everyone will just ignore you . 
  a lot of people ask questions related to studies/projects in this subreddit and it is a great plattform to get in touch with the correct person . 
  however , you will have to show that you have done your part of the work before someone else will help you . 
  monsters count as creep kills ... so what exactly do you mean ? 
  it also says cest timezone :, 
  currently , it is thursday , 11 april 2013 , 15:38:20 cest, 
  i was just naming some ranged supports . 
  i personally would n't pick sona at all but that 's just me . 
  your stats are :, 
  12 wins, 
  15 losses, 
  looks pretty avarage to me . 
  i also do n't know what the issue is ? 
  are you trying to blame your team for a loss ? 
  it was truly fabolous !, 
  i think that is intended . 
  the gap does n't seem to be that big and in order to advance you have to beat teams that are stronger than you . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1c6zqi/lol_subreddit_with_random_troll_questions/ ) one is really good . 
  use google and search for `` league of legends esports '' . 
  this will give you a starting point . 
  this is fabolous , thanks for sharing .

  edit2 : my favourite, 
  vladimir [ 09:11 ] : this teemo bought an oracle and went afk at drake, 
  vladimir [ 09:19 ] : said he was gon na be a vision ward, 
   making an analogy with the increase of the current skin price it should mean that the quality is decreasing . 
  can you elaborate that further ? 
  i do n't understand where that analogy comes from ? 
  legacy skins are cheap ( style and price ) , so that means that the quality is increasing , not decreasing compared to the old skins . 
  maybe you should stop suiciding with karthus then ? 
  it has nothing to do with the quality but with the effort and amount of work required to make that skin . 
  just because you have a nice looking/fun skin means it took a lot of work to make them . 
  not much you can do here . 
  you ca n't remove people from game for being bad and using unusual summoners . 
  i know what you 're saying and it is obvious ... but ... nothing can be done unless it shows he is doing something against the summoner code . 
  and being bad is not against the summoner code . 
  maybe it was duo queue ? 
  nice friends you have, 
  it was posted before but it 's a good reminder , nonetheless . 
  edit : spelling, 
  edit2 : found the link but post was removed : http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1bpwfd/scumbag_gamer_fakes_to_be_crippled_to_receive_8k/, 
  i do n't need to bring a 5th member with 4 darius ... but i need to bring my own ball to practise ... right ? 
  you deffo should have the report card . 
  check your spam folder or contact the riot answering machine . 
  it was supposed to be sarcasm ... but that did n't work well : /, 
  how about you just stop flaming ? 
  you make it sound like it 's a condition and riot is the one who is to blame . 
  no , it would n't . 
  what 's you point ? 
  that would be way to strong . 
  this will never happen . 
  mute them . 
  you can still see the pings . 
  at some point i had all chat disabled and my team muted ... that was the time i had 10 ranked wins in a row . 
  you can focus much more on what 's going on and have all your time stamps visible . 
  once you start arguing you start to make bad plays and do n't pay attention to the game . 
  you can ward the enemy buff on your side of the map and stop the jungler from getting the red/blue buff . 
  you can also try to quickly destroy the enemy tower in your lane and then start roaming . 
  edit : the first respawn of the enemy buff is almost at the same time every game ( between 7:05 and 7:20 for the first buff ) . 
  have you jungler or support ward the buff 1-2 minutes prior to respawn so it 's not as obvious . 
  start pushing your lane at 6:30 and go in for the kill/buff steal when the enemy jungler starts . 
  finally ... a new support, 
  edit : is that really how you talk or are you trying to be funny ?
