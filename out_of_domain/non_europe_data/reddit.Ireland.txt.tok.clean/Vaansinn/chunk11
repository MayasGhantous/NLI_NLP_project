  you ca n't do anything about that . 
  the lol community is perfect and every attempt to question actions or to provide feedback only shows that you have no idea what you 're doing since everyone is perfect . 
  do n't try to find out what your team is doing but tell them what you 're doing . 
  are you going for a buff ? 
  split push ? 
  players are n't that bad , it 's mostly just misscommunication . 
  do your part and communicate your actions , do n't comment on others ( as stated before , they are perfect and know everything ), 
  community . 
  she is still a viable pick . 
  maybe ? 
  pro players are prime examples of how you should play . 
  this does n't only include gameplay but also behaviour . 
  if you 're a bad sportsman you do n't belong in pro tournaments . 
  if you see a pro player getting away with bad behaviour you are starting to use the same behaviour . 
  this is not acceptable . 
  edit : spelling, 
  this is bad and you should feel bad . 
  i think they should put all skins that are increasing on sale before they increase their prize . 
  that shows that it is really not about the money , 
  i would also recommend to check out command ships if you have bc v already . 
  it 's the date from the official web site : http://www.eveonline.com/odyssey, 
  edit : it might be a missunderstanding . 
  the addon is coming on the 4th that means you have time to learn the skills until the 3rd . 
  i would recommend bc v since it would save you a lot of time . 
  the new expansion, 
  i do n't understand your question . 
  did you click on `` detail '' in the sidebar ? 
  edit : since a few people actually read this now i think i should expand a few things to make it a bit more clearer for the new players . 
  all the information is purely for solo queue and can vary from game to game . 
  this is also supposed to be a ** guide for the lanes ** , not the champions/roles . 
  - attack damage carry ( adc ) is placed on the bottom lane to be closer to the dragon . 
  dragon spawns at 2:30 and respawns every 6 minutes past its time of death . 
  adc should focus on last hitting and the eventual kill to get items . 
  once you kill the enemy adc consider to kill dragon . 
  please be aware that if your adc dies , the enemy team might approach dragon . 
  - support is placed with your adc to assist with kills/farm and to survive any ganks . 
  therefore your task is to ward and try to zone the enemy bottom lane . 
  this results in 2 people being on the bottom lane . 
  having 2 champions around a creep being killed results in a split of experience . 
  your adc and support will be a few levels behind your other champions but this is nothing really to worry about unless it gets a gap greater than 3 levels . 
  - the jungler gets gold and experience by killing monsters in the jungle and avoids taking experience points from the 3 lanes . 
  - the middle lane is the shortest lane and has a lot of paths leading to/from it . 
  this is the reason you see champions with burst damage and/or high mobility . 
  the burst damage is needed to kill the enemy champion quickly before he/she can escape . 
  the mobility is needed to support your team all over the map ( jungle/top lane/bottom lane ) since you are at the center of the map and have the shortest path to any spot or to escape any gank attempts . 
  these requirements make ability power carries ( apc ) a preferred choice since they mostly offer burst and/or mobility . 
  also , since it 's the shortest lane it is recommended to put your weakest champion on that lane since it 's easier to escape from . 
  - this leaves you with the top lane which is usually more unnoticed because baron spawn after 15 minutes and therefore the center of attention is at the bottom part of the map around dragon . 
  top lane is the most `` rural '' since the top lane does n't have a support champion like on the bottom lane and not a lot of escape routes like on the middle lane , therefore is more dangerous . 
  it is recommended to put champions with great sustain or escape on the top lane . 
  you will face 1v2 situations quite often and need to be able to survive/escape them . 
  edit : having said all that ... once you understand the reason for the current `` meta '' you can easily change play style or adjust team composition like a lane swap or double adc . 
  nothing is set in stone but i think it 's important to understand why we have the current meta . 
  edit2 : spelling + words , 
  edit : yeah and mid involves mobile champs which can gank top / ** bot ** easily, 
  that is correct . 
  i did n't want to throw in any numbers to make it more complicated . 
  but yeah ... xp are shared and it 's important to remember . 
  as a support , if your adc goes back and you can stay on lane take as many ** last hits ** as you can get because you will be behind in xp anyway . 
  the thing about top lane is , you should always pick a champion with an escape like a dash , jump or anything else to get away . 
  as i have mentioned earlier you will face 1v2 situation quite often because no one is around to help you so you will have to know your champion and you should be able to get out very quickly . 
  ( wards are you best ally ), 
  i even added a `` edit '' after it has been changed ... 
  fizz is very good at dodging skill shots . 
  ashe is an adc and she does n't really need skillshots , she just auto attacks you . 
  pick fizz against another ap carry because it makes it easier to dodge their damage spells and kill them . 
  also , never expect team mates to warn you . 
  do n't rely on `` ss '' or `` mia '' or any other indication . 
  also , never blame your team mates for not telling you . 
  always keep in mind ** `` if you have time to check the chat , you have time to check the map '' ** . 
  you are responsible for your own safety . 
  - if you ca n't see any enemy champion , be very careful and never go alone, 
  - make sure you check the map for the enemy jungler to know in what area of the map he is, 
  - inform your team mates when the enemy jungler appeared near your lane so they know he is n't near their lane . 
  - inform your team/jungler about any used summoner spells from the enemy , that helps him setting up ganks, 
  bonus : time the enemy buff and ward them , setup a gank at their buff with your jungler, 
  edit : sorry , did n't mean to tell you how to play your lane :d just realized how much stuff i had written, 
  if you play leona you can still get a dorans shield . 
  i do that and it works like a charm . 
  obviously not as a first item but get it as quick as you can . 
  let 's you bully even more . 
  it really depends but mostly you want to see the buff when it spawns . 
  it also gives you more vision for all sides around blue rather than just the top part . 
  well ... it ** is ** correct that they are shared . 
  i am not sure about the numbers myself , that 's why i did n't add them . 
  i recommend checking / r/fweddit or / r/bravenewbies in the sidebar . 
  this has been posted in a few subreddits now but i thought this would be an appropriate subreddit for this news too , 
  i have never seen this happening before . 
  source : i asked her last night . 
  i think that 's the point most people forget ... the `` troll '' could have been in the opposite team . 
  and usually that 's not a big problem or causes people to go to the forums . 
  it 's only when they are in your team . 
  same for me . 
  i always feel bad for the enemy team but i know , this will happen to me eventually too . 
  i wish i could get back the 1 minute i wasted on this post + picture . 
  most useless post today so far . 
  edit : if anyone finds this ... i won !!!!!!, 
  suck it op !!!!!, 
  you should provide some more information :, 
  - language,
