  - times, 
  - your ingame name, 
  - name of your team, 
  also , it would be useful to know what champion pool/expectations you have for your new mid laner, 
  why do you want to see `` statistics '' ? 
  if he is diamond 1-2 , what exactly are you looking for ? 
  i would love to have the option to disable surrender votes mid combat . 
  nothing is more frustrating than trying to win a game and in the middle of the fight , the surrender vote pops up . 
  no luck : /, 
  kda ratio does n't tell you anything about the skill of that person . 
  only shows who did the last hit . 
  and regarding the champions ... just say what champion pool you are looking for so people have an idea what style/pool you are going for . 
  but ... i am nowhere near diamond and this does n't affect me . 
  just thought i give you some tips to avoid the downvotes . 
  because no one will find this thread now : /, 
  the more information you provide , the more people will respond . 
  your point being ? 
  pics or it did n't happen . 
  haha ... well done !, 
  how did she read his next question and reply ? 
  she must be cheating !, 
  ahhh come on ... just because he is prettier than op does n't mean we have to make fun of that guy . 
  this was posted 17 hours ago , why not just comment and upvote instead ? 
  24.03.2018 : for the first time since its launch on october 27 in 2009 , players around the world did n't experience any disruption of service for 7 consecutive days . 
  according to some random [ statistics ] ( http://www.lolking.net/champions/irelia#statistics ) she seems very balanced . 
  i personally think she is still very strong late game since you can shut down the enemy adc or apc if you had a good laning phase while still being tanky . 
  wow , i did n't know that existed . 
  thanks !, 
  that 's the question you have to ask yourself for every job and every position , not just lol or esports . 
  if they are true `` pro gamer '' they would be able to find jobs in other games/teams or work in different part of the industry . 
  a lot work for quality teams for new games or for gaming magazines . 
  start with a youtube channel or a blog . 
  it 's easy to setup and you can do shoutcasts , comments , your point of view about certain things , write articles . 
  if you want to work in the `` industry '' you will need some form of portfolio and a youtube channel or blog are a good starting point . 
  also , to say you really want to get into `` esports '' is like saying you want to get into `` sports '' . 
  there are tons of different things to do , different jobs , different criterias . 
  you really need to find a field you would love to do in the big area of `` esports '' . 
  i think `` ad carry '' and `` support '' are acceptable but what really confuses me is `` top '' or `` mid '' ... why not `` bruiser '' or `` ap carry '' . 
  some are labeled by their role like ad carry or support , which is fine because the game has roles and there is no point to deny that . 
  but i do n't understand why they label them with their lane . 
  because that what makes the meta ... the lane they are playing , not the role . 
  in some pro games you even see a lane swap so the `` top '' laner is n't even top ... that does n't make sense at all . 
  so why not call the person `` bruiser '' instead of `` top '' ? 
  you already call you bot lane `` ad carry '' and `` support '' and not `` bot '' . 
  i think the roles are fine because each champion has 1 or 2 fixed roles , intended by design . 
  but no one says on what lane you play that champion or how many of a certain type you have . 
  but by using `` top '' or `` mid '' you already tell the viewer where that champion need to be played and i think that 's wrong in order to evolve the meta . 
  i do n't really care what they call them , i am just trying to say that putting them into a certain lane can be confusing for the viewer and gives the impression that this is the only way to play since the pros are doing it . 
  or just call them `` solo lane '' , which does n't specifiy anything other that they are on their own on their lane ... which fits everything really . 
  so basically you just repeat what i said ? 
  so it is * not * confusing to call some `` top '' lane and then let him play bot lane ? 
  and why is `` solo '' forced and `` top '' not ? 
  but you said exactly the same !, 
  do you even read the text or do you just downvote and claim it 's all `` pointless '' ? 
  fun fact : there is no `` bot lane '' , they are called `` ad carry '' and `` support '' ... should n't they be called `` bot '' instead then if you have `` mid '' and `` top '' already ? 
  how about `` ap carry '' and `` ap carry '' . 
  does n't matter if 1 or 2 . 
  stfu noob , uninstall, 
  i hope you feel home again :d, 
  and needs a stair lift to get off the plattform . 
  it 's also about your hidden elo . 
  if you should be ranked much lower according to you elo you will lose more points then you gain per win . 
  you need to get more wins so you 'll get more points for wins . 
  stick with 100 in 15 minutes . 
  do n't compare your solo q games with 5v5 games you see in lcs . 
  after laning phase ends , everybody just wants to get their own cs up and sometimes 2 or 3 people run towards the same creep wave . 
  having 200 cs in 30 minutes is ok in solo q. 
  but practice in custom games . 
  also , practice with a limited number of champions because it 's different with each of them . 
  yeah , this really changes the outcome of a game . 
  first of all , i would n't recommend to play mordekaiser since he has no cc . 
  as long as you do n't have a team who knows what they are doing , i would always take a champ with cc myself . 
  ** if you are ahead ** try to push you lane as quickly as possible and take wraith . 
  in case you play lux you can also start roaming and help your other lanes or setup ganks with your jungler . 
  ** if you are behind ** freeze your lane and try to keep both minion waves in the middle . 
  people only claim they play for `` fun '' ~ ~ is ~ ~ because they do n't want to admit they have failed this game . 
  edit : w0rd ... happy grammar nazi ? 
  no , it 's the same pool . 
  oh wow , a non native speaker made a spelling/grammar error ( or has a word left over after rephrasing the comment ) ? 
  better remove all credibility ... 
  omg !, 
  formatting ... please . 
  if you put half the time in this post then it took to `` create '' the new meta ... i am worried . 
   like hec or moaki, 
  please ... make that whole thing more appealing . 
   the very first ban . 
  for no reason !, 
  ban card or gtfo, 
  man , a stranger on the internet said i am toxic ... i should go uninstall : /, 
  `` not again ? '', 
  do you know a name or something ? 
  i never said you suggested that . 
  is this the reason you do n't post you tribunal case and removed your thread ? 
  why not just point out a spelling mistake without attacking the person ? 
   removes any credibility you may have had, 
  what responses are you expecting after a comment like that ? 
  [ true ] ( http://i.qkme.me/36fat4.jpg ), 
   only to those who deserve it or that can handle it, 
  why only them ? 
  fyi : only last 5 sec relevant,
