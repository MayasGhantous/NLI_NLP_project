  http://www.eveonline.com/faq/client-system-requirements/ have a look, 
  no problem . 
  if you ever decide you want to try eve just drop me a message and i can send you a 21 day trial ( rather than the 14 days trial you get from the website ) . 
  the specs are pretty low but you wo n't be able to fly big fleets with them . 
  but it 's ok for the other 95 % of the game , 
  the learning curve got improved a lot over the past few years/month and there are plenty of ingame-tutorials and guides that will help you along the way . 
  also , there are plenty of people who are willing to teach starters . 
  just saying , 
  or you just go for 3 month , 
  you have detailed ingame tutorials for almost all basic activities ingame . 
  to get an idea of what to do in the first place , please refer to http://swiftandbitter.com/eve/wtd/eve-wtd.jpg, 
  find a corp that will help you understand the game . 
  [ eveuniversity ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/main_page ) is a great place to find information about eve ingame and outside of the game through the website . 
  you can disable lowsec and null sec market orders so you only get shown market order in high sec . 
  also , set your auto pilot settings to avoid low sec . 
  if you have these 2 settings , you should never end up in low sec by accident again . 
  check out all the changes for [ odyessey ] ( http://community.eveonline.com/news/patch-notes/patch-notes-for ), 
   i think i 'll stick with mission running for now, 
  until you realize how much fun you had in low/null sec ... you will look back and remember the thrill , the excitment and the exprience you made while doing exploration . 
  and that will be the point where you will get back in a new frig and start exploring . 
  but this time you will check the star map for activity and how many ships got destroyed in your next system in the last hour , you will learn new things and you will get home with even more isk . 
  by deafult it should be set to `` prefer safer '' but you always should check . 
  have a look at this [ guide ] ( http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/74215 ) from ccp . 
  it shows how you can change the settings . 
  the setting can be found ingame [ here ] ( http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/64141/1/screenshot_3.png ), 
  also , when checking your autopilot it shows all systems you have to travel through and they all have a color assigned to it . 
  make sure the color is always between blue - green - yellow . 
  everything that is between yellow - red is what you want to avoid . 
  when you see yellow , hover over the box with your mouse and make sure it says 0.5 and not 0.4 . 
  fly safe, 
  is that the cringe circlejerk ? 
  she sounds laparl 'd, 
  use the agent finder to find more ... swag agents ^ ^ is ^ ^ that ^ ^ the ^ ^ language ^ ^ kids ^ ^ use ^ ^ these ^ ^ days ? 
  and continue doing missions . 
  btw ... you do n't do `` quests '' ... you are doing missions . 
  this is a solid advice, 
  maybe he is talking about dust ? 
  forget everything you have learned in previous mmo games, 
  stick to the ingame tutorials and do them all, 
  this is not the authentication that puts users at risk , it 's the malicious software . 
  that 's like saying a password puts users at risk because they can be fetched . 
  it does n't need to be `` disabled '' since it needs to be activated in the first place . 
  this is malicious software and it does what malicious software does . 
  that does n't mean that the security system is faulty , it just means that there is another way to get your account details . 
  in the end , the user is the biggest security risk as always . 
  do n't ignite the gas , do n't use open flames . 
  you mean the article that got dismantled in the comments as people were pointing out that the article was just inaccurate ? 
  it might have been a lot of people but it did n't indicate any police violence or errors . 
  people die of other causes too and the whole article was just misguiding . 
  exactly . 
  most articles on reddit are incorrect or the headline is just misleading . 
  comment section usually gives you a much better picture of what really happened . 
  you guys realize that you can include those things in the marriage contract , right ? 
  it does n't have to be that bad if you do n't want to . 
  true : /, 
  i am at work at the moment so i ca n't post anything ... but it really depends on what you are doing . 
  ratting , pvp , incursion or mining all have different requirements on the gui . 
  high , low and 0sec also have different requirments . 
  maybe you should specify what you are doing and what layouts you would be intessted in . 
  it seems they give away the stuff that is high on cbd and low on thc because no one wanted to buy that in the first place and they had huge amounts stored . 
  would n't they be good for freighter pilots ? 
  you can check out jonnypew videos about exploration . 
  most of them are pre odyssey but he has everything covered for post odyssey . 
  check out this one to see one of the guides : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8igxal3zfi, 
  this should give you an idea about modules and rigs, 
  can you just join fleets for bomber bar like with wtm or do you have to be their corp ? 
  cool , thanks for the info . 
  is the fleet in the same region ( more or less ) or does it change . 
  is there a staging system ? 
  ok , thanks !, 
  will look into that, 
  i was just thinking about freighter pilots because they have no fitting . 
  they only way to improve is by implants and these 2 combine all 4 imortant aspects . 
  the big questions is : are they cap stable ? 
  go to a doctor and talk to him/her . 
  even if they ca n't help you directly , at least they can guide you to someone else and you talked to someone . 
   and the one who was free because of insurance was judgemental that i had sex before marriage . 
  sounds like you live in a weird area . 
  i would also considering moving if that 's what the doctors or like : /, 
   but i just felt like i was paying them $ 50 to listen to me . 
  is n't that what you want ? 
  just replying to safe the links , thx , 
   unless you are an extremely strong swimmer or have been trained as a lifeguard he probably would have . 
  even then they might break your bones or take you with them . 
  no life guard in there right mind approaches a drowning person directly . 
  you always give them something to hold on to and stay the hell away from them . 
  you learn that even children can seriously harm grown ups . 
  do n't let age be a factor for the descision . 
  they do n't have to grab you . 
  a proper elbow blow to the face or a kick underwater can be enough to knock you out . 
  there is no `` safe '' way to approach a person , only `` less risky '' . 
  just because there a ways to make the person let you go does n't mean you ca n't get seriously harmed or even killed when trying to rescue someone . 
  as soon as an inhibitor is destroyed do 2 things :, 
  - make the lane spawn a cannon minion every wave, 
  - buff the cannon minion to a super minion, 
  that way , it works as a buff and as soon as the inhibitor is back , the buff gets removed and you have no super minions in that wave anymore and they revert back to cannon minions . 
  this would mean that you still have to face cannon minions but that 's less dangerous than super minions . 
  linking the destruction of your inhibitor to a buff that gets added/removed also gives you a better feeling for what it does . 
  additionally , the buff could stack for each inhibitor destroyed and you could remove the double super minion waves when all 3 inhibitors are destroyed since the super minions would already be very strong . 
  let me know what you think ,
