  but regarding your comment ... station trading can be very exciting , you must be playing this game wrong if you think otherwise . 
  what do you think a `` wow junky '' means by `` exciting '' ? 
  i am not sure he will find what he is looking for so i rather tell him it 's not exciting . 
  if he still plays and does find it exciting ... great . 
  but i do n't want to get his/her hopes up and then he/she gets frustrated because it is too different from the theme park games . 
  there are different ways to approach that :, 
  1 : kill the enemy out of cap range, 
  2 : kill the enemy before your cap runs out, 
  3 : use cap battery or cap booster, 
  when you check out different energy drain systems [ here ] ( http://www.eve-wiki.net/index.php?title=energy_vampire ) and [ here ] ( http://www.eve-wiki.net/index.php?title=energy_destabilizer ) you can see that the range is very limited . 
  in fact , you have to be fairly close to your target . 
  i would assume it is one of many ways to kill your enemy but i doubt it is as strong as it might look like to you . 
  source : i am a retarded pvp pilot, 
  keep in mind that pve cap warfare does n't work like in pvp . 
  you should never see anyone with neuts if they do n't have an empty high slot or a bonus like the [ sentinel ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/sentinel ) or the [ curse ] ( http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/curse ) . 
  that means that usually you know what you 're up against or at least you should expect it . 
  pve ships have some strange fittings and you ca n't completely neut them as far as i know .

  thanks , i am at work at the moment , 
  nice try , mr. awox, 
   they had eavesdropped such a conversation through a closed door but added that he had no evidence to substantiate what he heard . 
  well , there 's that . 
   the report identifies the countries with the highest levels of happiness :, 
  * norway, 
  * switzerland, 
  * netherlands, 
  * sweden, 
  anyone surprised by this ? 
   or could n't prevent their use by underlings without authorization . 
  what underlings ? 
  what makes you think that the chemical weapons were provided by him or even from his weapon depots ? 
  that 's just bullshit , sry . 
  do you want to seizure all firearms from the government too because they could n't prevent the missuse or use without authorization for firearms ? 
   under international control, 
  who exactly will be responsible for them now ? 
  and what will happen if they 're getting missused after they have been placed under `` international control '' ? 
  not sure chemical weapons belong in anyone hands . 
   the evidence examined by human rights watch strongly, 
  suggests that the august 21 chemical weapon attacks on, 
  eastern and western ghouta were carried out by government forces . 
  our basis for this finding is :, 
  nothing . 
  that 's why they only `` strongly suggest '' . 
  this is not evidence , this is assumption . 
  edit : the points are :, 
  * the large-scale nature of the attacks , involving at, 
  least a dozen surface-to-surface rockets affecting, 
  two different neighborhoods in damascus countryside situated 16 kilometers apart , and ** surrounded by, 
  major syrian government military positions ** . 
  * one of the types of rockets used in the attack , the, 
  330mm rocket system -- ** likely ** syrian produced , which, 
  appear to be have been used in a number of alleged, 
  chemical weapon attacks , has been ** filmed in at least, 
  two instances in the hands of government forces ** . 
  the, 
  second type of rocket , the soviet-produced 140mm, 
  rocket , which can carry sarin , is listed as a weapon, 
  known to be in syrian government weapon stocks . 
  both rockets have never been reported to be in the, 
  possession of the opposition . 
  nor is there any footage or other evidence that the armed opposition has, 
  the vehicle-mounted launchers needed to fire these, 
  rockets . 
  * the august 21 attacks were a sophisticated military, 
  attack , requiring large amounts of nerve agent ( each, 
  330mm warhead is estimated to contain between 50, 
  and 60 liters of agent ) , specialized procedures to load, 
  the warheads with the nerve agent , and specialized, 
  launchers to launch the rockets . 
  all 3 points raise a lot of questions . 
  * why would they attack settlements surrounded by syrian government military positions ? 
  would n't that include their own families as well ? 
  * the filming was not about the incident but only that those weapons are in the hands of the government . 
  i am pretty sure that this is n't the only government that has those weapons . 
  when they talk about the opposition , they do n't clarify who the `` opposition '' is . 
  there are a lof of groups fighting for power . 
  * the thrid point is only a statement and ( again ) proves nothing really . 
  i shot al sharif, 
  but i did n't shoot the deputy, 
  is that really 1 sentence ? 
   they have been attacking the area for 7 months . 
  if their own families were there they did n't care when they launched artilery/air strikes at them either . 
  fair enough . 
  did n't know that . 
   it is also made to be launched from iranian falaq-2 's ( only known operators is iran , syria and allegedly hezbolah ), 
  but that would mean that there are other ways this weapon could be launched , produced by other countries ? 
  what i think is weird how they verified those weapons :, 
   human rights watch analyzed publicly posted ** youtube videos ** from the attacked areas as well as higher-resolution images of weapon remnants provided by a local activist in eastern ghouta , and identified and analyzed two separate surface-to-surface rocket systems that are believed to be associated with the delivery of chemical agents . 
  by directly contacting the activists who videotaped and uploaded the videos of the attack available on youtube , human rights watch has been able to verify the reliability of the videos , and confirmed that they were filmed in the affected area .
