  in the case of eastern ghouta , a local activist provided human rights watch with high-resolution photographs and measurements of the 330mm rocket components . 
  un inspectors were also videotaped inspecting some of the same rocket remnants during their on-site visit , further confirming that the rockets are located at the scene of the attacks . 
  all they have is a location , but no time . 
  they can prove that the rockets are in this area but not at what time ? 
  and contacting people in eastern ghouta , does n't that mean they contacted ( biased ) rebel groups ? 
   what does the time matter ? 
  they know that these rockets have been in the area at a given time but what tells them that it was this month , year , day of the attack ? 
  what if they would have shown them footage from last year and claim it was just last week ? 
   it 's all in the report . 
  i ca n't find such information , can you please show me where you find this ? 
  all i can find is :, 
   however , the two [ weapons delivery systems ] analyzed by human rights watch are the only known rocket systems identified, 
  as associated with the attacks , ** according to local activists ** who have closely inspected both the affected areas . 
  i am not sure how much i can trust local activsts . 
  i applaud you for scrolling that far down , 
  at one point in my raging lol career i found myself close to 900 elo in season 2 . 
  i am currently at 1350 so i guess i definately have improved . 
  i only play support so you can do that too . 
  what i noticed from your support pick is that they are all passive . 
  sona might be a bit more aggressive depending on play style but lulu and soraka need decent teams to be useful . 
  if possible try to play taric or leona . 
  the reason for that is :, 
  * they are super simple to play, 
  * you can initiate a fight, 
  * they can be devastating if played correctly, 
  i played taric only until i hit 1200 elo again . 
  taric is actually the perfect support for low elo player and i mean no disrespect by that ( i was there too ) . 
  what i noticed is that you usually have 1 good player each team and the rest kinda goes with it and gets hyped by the playes from the good player . 
  taric is perfect to shut that player down with his target stun , a heal and aoe armor and dmg buff . 
  leona does n't have a heal but she also can shut down a player completely . 
  both picks do n't mean you will win the game but you will have much more impact on the game and the fight than with lulu or soraka . 
  why is it stupid to ask for a reason ? 
  how can i improve my play if i do n't ask `` why '' ? 
  thanks . 
  that 's exactly what happened to me and now i have the first 2 seasons for 3 euro and they did n't get a single cent . 
  is n't it eircom , upc and sky ? 
   as expected , the report did not say who launched the attack in rebel-held damascus suburbs . 
  neither did the un report . 
  nothing new to see here . 
  not too far off ... 
  yes , nice ship for missions . 
  it really depends on your drone skills . 
  my drone skills are n't very good since i mostly use turrets . 
  the armageddon has only 1 skill bonus that can be used for missions since neuts are n't very usefull . 
  the navy apoc let 's me use t2 pulse laser with 80km range which is enough to blast through missions . 
  i still do n't understand why i would use an armageddon just so i can use only one of its bonuses . 
  that seems like a big waste to me . 
   maybe it 's time to train those drone skills ? 
  yes , i agree . 
  but there are also lots other skills that needs finishing . 
  my drone skills are n't bad but not as perfect as as my gunnery skills . 
  i would never watch your videos with these intros and close it straight away . 
  i am not saying that to sound like a dick but this is ** my ** honest opinion . 
  too much movement and lighting effects . 
  i think that 's actually really funny . 
  i will definately use this in future conversations . 
  someone 's jealous ... 
  why are players getting `` screwed '' by a game design choice ? 
  you can always argue about design choices but this article is just terrible . 
  [ removed ], 
  that would mean we would have to cancel the extradition treaty first . 
  it 's not so much that we ca n't take snowden but we would have to send them to the us since we do have an agreement with them . 
  i do n't know much about international policies but i assume it wo n't be easy or beneficial for germany to end this agreement . 
  it goes both ways . 
  ** also ** : being against getting spied on has nothing to do with granting snowden asylum in the first place . 
  i am pretty sure you can be against being spied on and keep certain policies up . 
  thanks , i never thought about the level height but it makes sense because it 's usually when i am using it in the river to get out of the river . 
  the game wants to give you a reason for killing them or to give you a purpose . 
  that 's what every game does . 
  mario does n't just go out and hunt bowser , link does n't just chase garen for no reason . 
  the player experiences something bad in the beginning ( like the kidnapping of the princess ) to explain why their actions are justified or what their purpose is . 
  for military shooter in the past it was n't necessary because germans/nazis , zombies or russians were automatically the bad guys and you did n't have to explain/show to the player what exactly makes them evil . 
  you could just put the player against nazis and he would n't question the purpose of his actions but `` to stop them '' . 
  with the new era of the military shooters you have a lot of new players on the field and most of them are unknown or pure fiction . 
  that means you have to show the player what exactly they are doing what makes them bad and why you have to intervene . 
  on top of that please note that most of that is similar to propaganda . 
  every country does that and tries to show the enemy as a savage beast ( see ww2 propaganda images ), 
  what circumstances would that be ? 
  do you know the law and regulations or do you just assume that ? 
  do you work in this field and have any experience ? 
  we knew the whole time . 
  stop treating snowden like the messiha . 
  there have been nsa leaks before and all the `` important '' people know about what 's going on . 
  do you think the german government was truly surprised by that ? 
   do n't we have a treaty that we do n't break the laws of each other 's country and spy on the leaders and citizens ? 
  i do n't know , do you ? 
  all that bombing in the middle east ? 
  that 's just their way to find the one middle eastern carpenter that gets reborn after 3 days . 
   i suspect there are many many more who subscribe for 1 or 3 months and then give up, 
  i stopped reading at this point to be honest . 
  i started eve with a 3 month subscription and did n't renew but not because i gave up but because i lost interest . 
  eve is what you make out of it and if you do n't have the time or effort to do something you lose interest ... calling it `` giving up '' sounds very arrogant . 
  a little bit off topic but ... 
  what picture is the anime from ? 
  i think it was n't a bad one actually but i ca n't remember the name : /, 
  edit : nvm , found it ... `` ah my goddess '' ... man ... how time flies : /, 
  wow ... that 's a nice way to ask a question . 
  i just remembered the last image but could n't remember the name . 
  then i looked it up and realized it 's over 20 years old . 
  wow ... insults ... how original .
