  q gives you great poke against him . 
  every time he goes in to get cs auto him and/or use q to get extra damage of . 
  if he uses the barrel for you that means he will miss out on cs since you 're not in the creep wave . 
  the clearing speed depends on your damage . 
  qwe should be enough to take down a wave . 
  if you 're behind or lacking damage you might have to go with qeqw even though that costs much more mana . 
  just want to add karma to that list as well . 
  maybe not as high profile as annie or leona but still a very strong pick with the correct team composition . 
  exactly what you were doing . 
  wait for ganks or go around the side and kill him from the river . 
  he has no escape and only 1 skill shot that can stun . 
  do n't approach him from the front . 
  with ahri you can safely take dorans . 
  however , if you think you will get bullied a lot or pushed out of lane you should start with sustain items . 
  i personally do n't think you have to worry about this since people want to stay away from ahri due to the cc and her damage . 
  you should n't worry about this too much . 
  try to pick something that adds to the the team . 
  in your example you can always play gragas as an ap bruiser or orianna or lissandra as utility mage . 
  you do n't have to pick a tank for mid lane . 
  singed mid is terrible since the lane is so short and you wo n't get a lot of kiting done . 
  farm , farm and farm . 
  nothing else . 
  play full tank and wait until you 're strong enough . 
  communicate that with your team and stay safe . 
  lee sin has a really high skill cap . 
  it sometimes does n't look like it but if you watch some lee sin highlights you can see that he can do so much more that q q e and die . 
  he is a very strong champ but only in the right hands . 
  go full tank . 
  you have really high damage but if you do n't get the kills or gold you will be useless later . 
  if you go full tank you can still do some decent damage and peel for your team and be super effective . 
  really strong long range mages are ziggs and syndra . 
  yes , you can . 
  just like every other champion . 
  it 's not so much about tankiness but about sustain . 
  shen is more of a team champ which mostly does n't work in solo queue due to the lack of communication . 
  sejuani is still strong but there are others that are stronger . 
  cho just seems to be weak against everything that currently used in the meta . 
  no , it wo n't . 
  [ qss ] ( http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/quicksilver_sash ) removes all debuffes while [ mikael 's crucible ] ( http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/mikael's_crucible ) removes specifically `` only '' all stuns , roots , taunts , fears , silences and slows on an allied champion . 
  it 's actually answered in his wiki at http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/aatrox if you click on `` ability details '', 
  * guardian angel and chrono shift will take precedence over blood well . 
  and [ chrono shift ] ( http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/zilean#chrono_shift ) states :, 
  * the rune takes precedence over all other revival effects , such as guardian angel and rebirth . 
  to conclude :, 
  ** first ** : chrono shift, 
  ** second ** : guardian angel, 
  ** third ** : blood well, 
  really ? 
  what hype ? 
  i have seen sup orianna once and that was because they fought about mid and she was forced into sup . 
  you can do both but gauntlet will clear a wave faster which means less stacks for you but it has a slow which is nice . 
  i think gauntlet is better for jungle nasus since his focus is n't on stacks as much as it is for lane nasus but more on utility . 
  i do n't know . 
  for me it 's working fine : /, 
  you mentioned 400 gold in your video but i am sure you know that 's it 's not even that much . 
  it 's 400 gold after 4 minutes so if something like in your video happens it might be `` only '' 350 gold . 
  just throwing it out there since it makes it even worse for the leona/jinx comp in your example . 
  and the 40 % are still getting it when they want so the 60 % lost already but do n't know it yet . 
  this has nothing to do with it . 
  you can still take pictures of people if you want in public places . 
  it only means that you ca n't print or share those pictures with other without the consent of the person . 
  and even this only works if it 's a picture of a person or a group . 
  if you take a picture of a busy market place , you do n't have to check with everyone in the picture and ask them for permission . 
  so good luck with the law . 
  it does n't include sightstone or trinket so it 's normal if it 's a bit lower on supports . 
  vision ward however , should be seen on everyone . 
  and what has this to do with your first and my last statement ? 
  facial recognition does n't negate the law regarding pictures of public places since `` right to your own image '' does n't do anything in this case . 
   which is probably do when you use the app . 
  let 's go with the facts on this one and stop assuming things . 
  it 's not up to us to decide if an app violates the law or not since we do n't know all the facts . 
  edit : last sentence only made sense in my head . 
  removed it . 
  of course someone is paying for them . 
  the customer still has a contract with the provider and pays money . 
  but it 's a monthly bill disregarding the amount of messages . 
  they are profitable because it 's only a tiny cost to transfer a message . 
  that 's why they come free with most contracts . 
  sms used to be already free in the very beginning until phone companies realized that you can make money with them . 
  they were only a `` side product '' on mobile phones . 
  lee sin - every lane, 
  you should start roaming and placing wards while doing so . 
  use your gold to help other lanes by warding river/wards/brushes and gank lanes . 
  do n't just farm your lane when you 're ahead . 
   ability to keep myself from getting frustrated, 
  i hope this does n't sound stupid but you should ask yourself why you 're getting frustrated . 
  it does n't have to be a self finding experience but try to see what exactly triggers this . 
  are you getting frustrated because of :, 
  * your team mates ? 
  * the enemy team/the lane matchup ? 
  * you 're having a bad day ? 
  * you feel powerless, 
  * all of the above ? 
  it really depends on what is making you feeling frustrated . 
  positioning and map awareness need to be practiced . 
  it also depends on the role you 're playing . 
  nothing happened to vayne . 
  she just got outscaled by other champs like jinx , lucian and sivir . 
  why do you assume that the next patch will nerf them ? 
  so far nothing has been announced .
