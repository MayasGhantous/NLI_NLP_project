  there are hints and rumors but i doubt sc will get nerfed . 
  sv could do with a small nerf but that wo n't change anything . 
  the current meta is so strong due to the masteries , not the items . 
   why is the meta : adc and support bottom ? 
  this has been asked every week and there are countless posts about this . 
  * mid lane is shortest lane and therefore should be for squishy/burst champs which are mostly ap champs , also shortest way back to tower, 
  * top is mostly on his own and should be therefore tanky or have other ways of sustaining/escaping, 
  * jungler is used so 2 out of 3 lanes do n't have to share gold/xp with another person on lane . 
  also , apc and bruiser champs scale really good with lvl . 
  * adc is item depended and not impacted so much by a shared lane . 
  * support is used for the adc because adc is on a long lane and mostly without escapes or tankiness . 
  * adc and sup are bot to keep dragon control, 
   when is it appropriate to lane swap ? 
  it is used to push towers faster . 
  in a 2v1 lane you usually do n't want to farm but push the tower and get faster control over the map . 
  if you send the enemy back to their base it is most likely that they will get items and they will be full health/mana . 
  if you can fight them under these circumstances you can freeze the lane . 
  otherwise you should push lane and also go back . 
  the most important thing is that sup and adc go back together . 
  you lose a lot of lane pressure if you go back one after the other . 
  roa can be good depending on how you play her . 
  if you go roa you should max w first and play bruiser karma . 
  she is considered strong because she has a great kit . 
  she has poke , a shield + speed and a root . 
  all these can be empowered for a new effect . 
  it 's important to note that the empowered spell does n't scale with the original spell . 
  you can max e for a nice shield and still hit really hard with empowered q. 
  i run ap quints / hybrid marks and armor yellow and mr seals . 
  i would n't recommend roa on support karma since you will get it quite late and you want more utility items on her . 
  realize what the fuck you are doing . 
  but in all seriousness ... shout , scream , get a punching bag , everything but the chat option . 
  when you angry just let it out but not on your team mates . 
  just scream and type `` it 's ok '' or `` np '' . 
  that 's all your team mates can and need to see . 
  in order to calm down you should stop playing and remind yourself that this is a game . 
  reflect on your own mistakes and improve to a level where you can be a resposible grown up who stands up for his own mistakes . 
  as soon as you realize that everything is your fault you stop raging because you realize it was your own doing . 
  when you watch ** good ** pros playing ( not something like phantomlord ) you will see that they always blame themself . 
  no matter what happens you can always say `` i should n't have ... '' . 
  get to this point and you will be much happier with lol and yourself , 
  i think it is ok to ignite of the enemy team has no heavy ad champ that needs a shut down and you can play aggressive in lane . 
  if the enemy team has something like aatrox or trynda or just a strong adc your team will most likely need an exhaust in order to win games at a later stage . 
  if that is n't the case you can easily take ignite . 
  but look at the other team members . 
  if you already have 3 ignites on your team you do ** not ** need a 4th ignite . 
  the way i see it is that you have to see what summoners your team has and what enemies you are facing . 
  i personally found it very good to rush talisman since it gives you amazing stats and gold income . 
  you can get by with trinkets and the odd ward . 
  i do n't think ruby crystal is only worth it if you need combat stats which is mostly melee/tanky champs like leona or taric . 
  just try to figure out if you need the extra hp or if it can wait . 
  where can i find the patch notes for that ? 
  it 's a sustain item which is nice during laning phase . 
  also , karmas w is 20 % of max hp so it get 's better the more hp you have . 
  i feel it 's always good to `` passively '' help them . 
  either split push and draw attention to you and away from your team mates or buy wards and ward not only for your lane but maybe for other lanes too . 
  keep timers and stay alive . 
  if someone is a dick , just mute them and treat them as a valid team mate . 
  you do n't play the game to win for them but you do need your team mates to get your win . 
  i know what 's on the pbe but the fact that the replay system is also on the pbe shows that it does n't mean anything . 
  other than not to play her ? 
  it 's pick order . 
  communication via chat is still recommended , just do n't expect people to care about it . 
  he is actually pretty easy to deal with in laning phase depending on what you play . 
  just remember that he needs to get into melee range for csing . 
  punish him every time he gets cs . 
  fiddle can go all lanes and so does lee sin . 
  you can either go for poke like karma , lux or nida sup and stay out of her range or go full tank and kill her quickly . 
  leona and thresh can be really devastating against her . 
  with all the stuns she has , you should not forget that this is just a squishy little girl that can be killed quickly . 
  people with 1 hand managed to get above gold so i do n't think that 's a valid reason . 
  just try to pick support where last hitting is n't a vital part . 
  i do expect them but the initial question already assumed that they are coming with the next patch which is n't a fact . 
  take dragon and push other lanes . 
  you can just swap top vs bot lane so you can quickly top tower and mid tower after . 
  i do n't want to make support sound like an easy thing to do but i feel a good support is more about coordination and positioning than pure mechanics . 
  thank you , 
  how about you watch the video first ? 
  you questions show that you have n't watched the video because most if not all of it is explained it in . 
  stop pushing the lane into their direction and instead , try to get it pushed towards your tower . 
  that makes it much easier for your jungler to gank the lane or when you start attacking the enemy , he has a much longer way to safety . 
  you 're not `` winning '' your lane just because you 're shoving the lane into the enemy turret . 
  you 're `` winning '' the lane when you have more cs and a better kda ration than your enemy . 
  no one can answer such a broad question . 
  that 's like asking `` how can i win a game of league of legends '' . 
  in general , you can :, 
  - check what lane is pushing and what lane has the highest possibility of a kill, 
  - check the jungle path of the enemy jungler and try to be there when he is, 
  - counter jungle to weaken the enemy jungler, 
  keep in mind that you ca n't win all games . 
  the important thing is that you do n't let a loss impact your next games . 
  someone threatened to stab me in real life because i did n't gank the lane ... 
  what people do n't realize is that mobs lvl are different in the open world and in dungeons . 
  while the level of enemies in the open world will always stay the same , the level of enemies in dungeons for quests are always a match for your level . 
  even when you go back into a low level area and start a quests that leads you into a dungeon , you will face challenging monster . 
  that means that you can make the main story fairly easy but you will still be challenged in missions . 
  i tried it . 
  i think it depends on when you accept the quest and the level you have at that very moment . 
  if you accept a quest , ignore it until much later in the game and go back to the dungeon , the enemies will be grey . 
  if you ignore the mission first and then accept it , the enemies will be adjusted to your current level . 
  edit : at least this was my personal observation .
