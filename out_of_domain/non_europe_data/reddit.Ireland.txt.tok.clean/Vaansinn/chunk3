  in low sec it really depends on what you wnt to do . 
  i would use a cheap t1 scan ship and depending on the site a t2 frig . 
  if you use a t2 cruiser make sure your way is clear and you 're not getting gate camped . 
  as long as you 're staying in your scanned site you are safe as long as you do n't see any probes on your de-scan . 
  i hope you know what i mean :d, 
  correct . 
  depending on your area it can be much safer in 0-sec than in high sec/low sec . 
  you just have to make sure you see potential threats as early as possible and have your escape plan ready . 
  also , check for wormholes since these can be quite dangerous since anyone can just jump into your system . 
  just start in high sec with a t2 caldari cruiser/frigate and see how you 're getting on . 
  it should n't be to difficult and you can see where your weak spots are . 
  as far as i know deep space probes are a mix between combat and core scanners . 
  but you always see them on d-scan . 
  and if you are doing a site they would need either a combat scanner to find your ship or core scanner to find your site . 
  but you should always see the probes first and even that does n't mean that they immediately found your site but just that they are near . 
  you simply have to love r/atheism . 
  why ca n't this being seen as a way to try to comfort a person who 's death is inevitable ? 
  of course cancer is fucked up but what would you tell that person ? 
  `` have fun with your pain for the next 10 years '' ? 
  or would you rather tell them a story which would give them comfort ? 
  you guys need to have kids so you would understand that a bed time story at the right time can be very helpful ... 
  ever heard of `` comforting '' ? 
  are you'e doing the same with your kids when they ask you about santa clause , toothfairy and such ? 
  just tell them the `` truth '' ? 
  she is currently working for red5studios as a cosplayer to promote their game firefall :, 
  i think red5studios is one of the first who hired full time cosplayers to promote a game ... but i would n't be surprised if that will become more common in the future . 
  yeah , they are both pretty awesome . 
  came here to say this ... / r/abandoneporn would be the perfect place for those pictures, 
  do you mean you bought the `` founder '' pack but do n't have a beta key ? 
  ok , i assume you are already covered by now . 
  enjoy the game , 
  i think it 's to prevent claims that these films have been altered or manipulated in any way . 
  it 's supposed to show the results `` on the fly '' ... kinda, 
  there was a thread about that in here a few weeks back . 
  you can use a spring from a old ball pen . 
  but i have never tried that . 
  maybe you can find the old thread . 
  ah yeah , thank you . 
  that 's what i was looking for . 
  edit : you first link leads to this thread here ... 
  this sounds more of an issue about perceiving time . 
  if the song would be new or you are not distracted the song feels much longer . 
  if you hear the song for the 1000s time or do n't pay attention it just flies by . 
  i assume it 's more about that you 've heard the song way to often and therefore it just flies by . 
  a quick google search about perceiving time came up with the following link :, 
  and there you 'll find the header : ** duration **, 
  which explains in some way what i mean . 
  i hope this explains this a bit better for you . 
  otherwise i 'll just quote it and sound smart  but if you search for `` perceiving time '' you 'll find tons of material on that matter . 
  ** edit **, 
  also gives you more information and reference about that, 
  1000 % more of 0 should still be zero ... 
  anyone willing to buy a copy for me for my steam account ? 
  i am more than happy to pay into your paypal account or get you something else on steam within the same price range . 
  ( i would prefer a steam trade for safety reasons ), 
  please pm me if you are interested . 
  we have a rule for risk where everybody writes down their next turn ( deployment , attack and so on ) and then we all do these steps at the same time rather than one after another . 
  that created a more even gameplay, 
  have you guys considered kickstarter ? 
  i really like the idea but i am not willing to pay 10 dollar for the program . 
  however , i would be more than happy to donate to our project so you can keep developing and make it a free version ( not just trial ) so everybody can enjoy it . 
  i would n't be surprised if there are more people who want to support your idea but do n't want to buy a small piece of software . 
  also , if you get your money through kickstarter ( or donations ) you do n't have to deal with sales , refunds and the expectation that comes with actually buying a product . 
  i hope you get my idea and think about it . 
  anyway , keep up the work , i would love to see more . 
  i always thought the lunges only evolved because we couldnt get enough oxygen through our skin ... 
  the same in our area ... just outside middleton ... nothing , not a single sound even though a few houses had some decorations and lots of sweets were prepared ... and have to be eaten by us now ... sad world , i know, 
  watermelons !, 
  i agree with you and usually i think the same . 
  but i think this current regulation is so wrong , outdated and dangerous that it needs to be changed as soon as possible . 
  it is really scary to think that this country would let your partner die just because of someone else 's religion . 
  of course it does n't make any reference but where do you think this comes from ? 
  just out of blue ? 
  and i never said anything about catholics . 
   so no-one is dying because of anyone 's religion . 
  maybe you should check the news more frequently before making those statements . 
   opposition to abortion is not a uniquely catholic stance , and other predominantly catholic countries have more liberal laws than we do . 
  of course , you can continue to blame the church if you like . 
  again . 
  i never said anything about catholics or the church , please read before you post . 
   please do report back on how successful that strategy works out for you . 
  works pretty well so far . 
   it comes from an 1861 act , enacted by the uk . 
  i apologize . 
  i completely forgot that in 1861 religion had absolutely no influence in law making decisions . 
   so what/whose religion was killing people in this context ? 
  any you want . 
  i did n't make this statement to bash religion ( or the church if you want ) in general . 
  i just do n't think that beliefs should have an impact on others who do n't share the same beliefs . 
  and especially not if someone 's health is in danger . 
  another example ( but not related to this case ) would be jehovah 's witnesses and blood transfusions . 
  they let their own kids die because of their beliefs . 
  i ca n't agree with that . 
   really ? 
  what actual changes have you achieved ? 
  i checked my last comments but ca n't find any reference to `` achievements '' . 
  maybe you can show me what you 're talking about . 
   over 97 % of abortions are neither for rape or threat to the womans life . 
  source ? 
  also , how is that related to this topic ?
