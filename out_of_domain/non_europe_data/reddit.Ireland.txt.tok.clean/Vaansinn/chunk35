  i think jeans fits actually much better . 
  it 's not a business or a share holder meeting . 
  i think a shirt + jacket + jeans is the most appropriate dress . 
  no , we do n't . 
  when did they ask the usa to be `` world police '' ? 
  i do n't want to say that the un might ask for help but they definitely do n't ask the usa to be world police . 
  and one is not like the other . 
  it still does n't make them world police though . 
  more like a mercenary army . 
  not really , because they 're going in foreign territory . 
  that 's not what police does . 
  that 's what an army does , or not ? 
  that is such a bullshit comment . 
  first of all , you clearly ca n't make a difference between the war and the genocide . 
  people are talking about the war , you 're talking about the genocide . 
  second , history is written by the victors . 
  i 'm sure we would say other things today if germany would have held europe but that did n't happen . 
  so , obviously germany is the bad guy but you have enough evidence that no one in the ii . 
  ww was the `` good '' guy . 
  they all did horrible things . 
  i think you misunderstood what i was saying . 
  the user `` ronankarr '' ca n't differentiate between war and genocide , not that those 2 belong to each other . 
  i agree and tried to explain that the war and the genocide are two different things when looking at the world war . 
   in the case of ww2 the allies were on the good side . 
  explain to me how bombing dresden or hiroshima was considered `` good '' ? 
  there was absolutely no need to do that . 
  also , the french would also like to know how it was `` good '' to erase their cities while advancing to germany . 
  and do you consider russia part of the allies , which you should ? 
  do you know what they have done to their own people , jews and prisoners ? 
  edit :, 
   they did not start invading countries, 
  do you even know why the 2 . 
  ww started ? 
  what state germany was in , why no one in europe tried to stop hitler before it was too late ? 
  you 're acting like it 's all so `` obvious '' but it usually is n't , especially for the people at the time . 
  of course we have much more information about the time nowadays and we know how it all ended but that was n't so clear at the time . 
  so i guess you have n't been to high school then or skipped the class , otherwise i do n't understand how you can consider the allies as `` good '' if everyone should know the answer . 
  that 's also because the genocide `` only '' started during ' 42 . 
  before that it was `` just '' working camps and this sort of thing . 
  still really bad but nothing compared to this well orchestrated genocide . 
  no one liked the jewish , really . 
  and i do n't mean that from my personal level but throughout history , the jews were always looked down on or treated really badly . 
  it was n't just germany but no one really cared what happened to them , sadly . 
  why do you have to pick anyone ? 
  no one is `` good '' during war and that 's the closest it gets to reality . 
  the allies were just as horrible as the germans in this war . 
  i do n't understand how you can consider anyone `` good '' in a war . 
   your being an ass, 
  did you mean `` you 're '' ? 
   twisting things, 
  what did i twist ? 
  i just do n't understand how you can ignore all the horrible things the allies did just so you can label the germans as bad and the allies as good . 
  that 's called being `` ignorant '' . 
  you 're hilarious and i 'm not gon na lie to you , i actually had to show your comments to a few colleagues of mine . 
  we had a good chuckle . 
   if some one held a gun to your head and said choose the good side who would you pick ? 
  definitely the side this guy wants me to say . 
  would n't make it right though , would it ? 
  anyway , i 'll leave you to it and your hollywood view of the world, 
  thanks for the information , 
  so is it more like an interactive movie in that sense ? 
  maybe similar to `` to the moon '' in the sense that it was more about telling a story and the characters rather than gameplay/combat ? 
  cool , thx , 
  does n't that mean something like estimate time of arrival ? 
  eta : thanks ... 
  personal note : still a shitty acronym if you ask me, 
  sooooo ... does `` eta : i 'm female . '', 
  makes any sense ? 
  you can find those things in a lot of montage parodies.i think the best one for lol is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kciiza6rvrw, 
  you might want to turn the volume down . 
  and if you happen to like the video and think it 's funny , try this one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxlnt5tjjow, 
  or hop over to r/montageparodies, 
  i bought it for 10 $ and did n't regret it . 
  the only game i ever found that was the closest to the table top in the sense of turns and equipment was `` warhammer 40,000 : chaos gate '' . 
  it is fairly old but has a great soundtrack and a nice campaign . 
  how would we know ? 
  it 's all blocked already ... 
  the appeal for half life can be compared the movie `` shawshank redemption '' . 
  both were not great because of some crazy stunt or major breakthrough . 
  they were great because they did n't do anything wrong . 
  for half life , it 's just an overall pleasant gaming experience without any major flaws ( not counting in the missing third part because that 's not part of the game itself ), 
  i 'm not sure what you mean ? 
  the whole time i was just waiting for `` i ca n't believe it '' ... 
  ignore the * negative * comments , they are just retarded ... 
  keep it up ... 
  edit : word, 
  yeah , i do . 
  that 's a nice idea . 
  thank you !, 
  i thought about noodles as well since they only require the hot water . 
  thanks for the links . 
  i actually did n't know that there are `` rice cooker meals '' out there . 
  should have assumed but it never really occurred to me . 
  thank you !, 
  thanks  that picture is about 1 year old but still my favourite to this day . 
  go for it . 
  i know a lot of people who study this in the stuttgart area and it seems to be great and rewarding !, 
  that 's really cool if he can keep the rp . 
  fair play to you guys ,
