  thank you , will look into that now , 
  thank you for helping making up my mind , 
  oh cool , i did n't know they added the smaller combat sites as well . 
  that 's great to know , thank you . 
  just watch the heartstone games with doa and chobra . 
  rather than just downvoting , i thought i 'll let you know why i personally think this is a very bad post . 
  i know you 're just trying to say that ** theoretically ** you could make 1800g in 12 days . 
  but i feel you also need to look at the time to achieve that . 
  1 game takes roughly 10 min, 
  assuming a 50 % win chance you would need 60 games before having 30 wins, 
  60 games * 10 min = 600 min/10 hours, 
  so , assuming the average , you would spend 10 hours for 12 days to get a value of 2 wings ( $ 10/9 euro ), 
  that 's 120 hours , 3 times what a full time employee works in a whole week , for $ 10 !, 
  that 's the reason why i downvoted your post . 
  as i said , it 's my personal opinion but i think it would be more helpful to help finding people a small job that could easily pay for all wings for 2 hours of actual work . 
  i still think it was a nice math exercise . 
  *** edit : word ***, 
  is not about the max ? 
   if you max that ( 30 play wins/day ) , you can make about 1850g ( on average ) with efficient questing and maxing wins . 
  that sounds like maxing to me ? 
   also . 
  people who actually grind for the max run rush decks around rank 18 . 
  matches last 5 winutes with a 90 + % winrate . 
  which would cut down that time by about two-thirds . 
  the flaw here is that with that win rate , you would n't stay at rank 18 . 
  in fact , you would get up the ladder pretty quickly and with that , game length and win chance will change which eventually will end up even out the saved time from the beginning . 
  that 's why we 're talking about averages . 
  my point is , no matter how you look at it , it 's easier to baby sit/mow the lawn/any other job and get more value for your time than playing the game for gold . 
  while it 's easy to say `` sure , i know that '' , posts like this sound pretty missleading . 
  when looking at the end of op thread :, 
   that 's 2 wings . 
  ayyyy, 
  it does n't sound he 's super serious about it and i never intended to * criticise * it , all i wanted to do was raise attention to the time factor that op has n't mentioned at all . 
  nothing wrong with that ? . 
  [ england bans smoking in cars with children ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/health-31310685 ), 
  of eve ? 
  replacing it with `` well '' seems to be the better option . 
  you do n't sound stupid for saying `` well '' and you also do n't just say nothing . 
  you usually would n't play any cards that give you armor like shieldmaiden . 
  i personally do n't even like shield block in this deck . 
  your shield slam will be very weak most of the time , if you have any armor at all . 
  anyone got that image or a rehost ? 
  seems to be deleted : /, 
  yeah , ireland and upc here too . 
  same issue . 
  i 'm sure one of the tooltips mentioned that they always focus casters ( mage/priest ) . 
  if not the tool tip , maybe some in game lore but i 'm sure i read it somewhere in-game, 
  that 's the song for the first link :, 
  tartalo music - the chase, 
  i can imagine how he felt :(, 
  your post right now is pretty pointless . 
  all it says is that you did it all along and want to get some praise too . 
  so here we go, 
  hold tight, 
  well fucking done !, 
  hope you can sleep better now, 
  link to actual kickstarter :, 
  it was the first time i used kickstarter and i know what you mean . 
  i would be very careful but looking at this project , it looked like they had already created some content and it was n't `` just '' an idea . 
  thinking the exact same . . 
  guess it 's worth trying , 
  you 're right , you will get downvoted for this because this is the biggest bullshit ever . 
  at least you could provide sources and studies for all your claims . 
  not sure what backwards area of the world you 're from but i can assure you that this is not the standard everywhere . 
  edit : spelling, 
  edit2 : thanks to uneddit , i managed to see the original comment :, 
  `` i 'll get downvotes for this ... but i 'll say it anyways . 
  there are two components to a crime . 
  the first is the act , while the second is the intent or though of the person while they are committing the act . 
  for example , if you shoot someone after planning to murder them for a few days , that 's murder . 
  if you are hunting and a freak accident causes them to get shot , that 's probably not a crime at all . 
  i could go into way more depth with this , but the point is that what the person is thinking while they commit the act is a very important part of how severely the act should be punished . 
  now if we go to sex crimes ... 
  when a man is committing a sex crime , other men know the type of filthy shit that was going through his mind . 
  and women who have known men also know the type of shit that was going through his mind . 
  its easy to assume that was some evil mens rea there . 
  alternatively , with women , there is not the same assumption of thought . 
  when it comes to sex stuff , women get a little bit of a pass on the filth in there heads . 
  you could say this is sexists ... but its also sort of justified . 
  on average , men are going to have way worse intent than women when it comes to sex crimes . 
  its sort of like how men are generally going to have slightly higher wages . 
  its a product of biology and society . '', 
  yeah , i doubt that was a guy to begin with but the internet is a better place without comments from that person . 
  your statement about the 50 % is a bit off but regardless of that , you do realise that the taxes cover far more than just health insurance , right ? 
  you ca n't compare `` 50 % '' taxes to 80 $, 
  i completely agree . 
  i usually describe it with english has a small core rule book and lots of extensions while german has a massive core rule book but only small add ons . 
  no data caps , i pay 44 euro in cork per month for 250 mb, 
  changing anti aliasing from fxaa to msaa 2x fixed that for me, 
  i 'm spending more time in loading screens than the actual game : / thank god they are nice otherwise this would be even worse, 
   ( oh boy ... here i go ... getting into an argument over the internet ... this ca n't end well ) . 
   lord help me for defending something on the internet ... 
  what is wrong with you ? 
  become rich, 
  do i still need to watch the movie after this trailer or have i seen it all by now ? 
  4 min ? 
  i 'm really curious as to what amazing new footage awaits me in the movie then ... but thanks , that answers my question . 
  appreciate the reply though , not a lot of people browsing new comments, 
  yeah , of course . 
  would n't be the first time that happens in a trailer,
