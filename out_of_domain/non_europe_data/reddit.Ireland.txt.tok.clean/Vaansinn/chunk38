  hope this helps as a starting point . 
  hey ,, 
  i think we would need more information to better understand what exactly you 're trying to do . 
  are you trying to get rid of all the duplicates or are you trying to filter out information ? 
  am i right in saying that the most likely solution is to check column b if it is the first event ? 
  is the event column a string or a number ? 
  would you have an example screenshot of your table ? 
  depending on the data , the solution could be different . 
  hey ,, 
  you can simply add the subject line in your `` prepare email '' part :, 
  . subject = `` schedule '', 
  if you want to include a date you 'll have to declare them as a variable first but i 'm not sure this would go beyond this request . 
  however , if you want to include it , i recommend creating a drop down list for day , month and year which will then be used in your subject line . 
  harvey had to be put to sleep this morning due to a blood clot near his spine ( `` saddle thrombus '' ) . 
  he went from healthy to paralysed within 48 hours , only being 5 years old . 
  harvey was one of those pets were you look back after years and still think how amazing they were . 
  i managed to teach him a few things and he was incredibly well behaved . 
  i 'm just glad that it was a fairly painless and quiet ending , sitting next to him while he fell asleep . 
  i imagine it does n't matter how much time they give you to say goodbye , it 's never long enough . 
  apologies if this is not best sub for that , i guess i just need to mourn and want to remember him : /, 
  ** edit : while i try to reply to all of you , i just wanted to say an overall thank you to all of you . 
  it means so much and helps a lot to deal with the sudden loss . 
  thank you . 
  it 's tough hearing that there is no alternative or cure , it was the same with him . 
  i 'm glad to hear though that you managed to enjoy the company of lola for 15 years . 
  thanks for your words !, 
  really appreciated . 
  thanks . 
  it 's pretty tough how sudden and unexpected that is ... 
  thank you . 
  he really was and that picture captured him pretty well . 
  thank you for your kind words . 
  really appreciate it . 
  while i do n't understand much about the anatomy , i think the biggest issue is that it is not just a nerve issue but his legs did n't get supplied with blood at all , meaning they already sustained some damage but i could be completely wrong . 
  it 's called `` saddle thrombus '' , maybe this will help you to find more information . 
  from what i read about it , it seems pretty severe . 
  thank you . 
  it means a lot . 
  for me the most painful moment was seeing him clawing his way through the living room because his legs did n't work anymore . 
  he could never `` meow '' or make sounds and this was the first time i heard him crying . 
  it was pretty devastating . 
  thank you so much . 
  he was supposed to be taken down when he was 6 weeks old and now owner was found . 
  at least i could give him 5 more years and i 'm sure he enjoyed them as much as i did . 
  they do . 
  harvey was n't just a pet but a companion . 
  you can get so attached to them , it really hurts . 
  thank you , it means a lot . 
  i agree , he was pretty special . 
  i got him when i moved here and i 'll move away in 2 weeks . 
  the timing for both events is so spot on that it 's pretty scary . 
  i 'm really happy he was part of these years . 
  thank you , this community really helps coping with it . 
  just to clarify :, 
   ( all blank row ) would be close to 7,000, 
  you check against 7000 ingredients ? 
  i do n't think excel is the right solution then . 
  maybe you want to look into a database which would give you way better utility for your data and it would be way faster . 
  edit : i 'm not saying that because it would be too difficult in excel or it 's impossible but with that size , i honestly think you wo n't find a solution for your problem that is actually feasible . 
  thanks !, 
  well , what do you have so far then ? 
  please keep in mind that this platform ** helps ** people but i do n't think anyone here will write the code for you for free . 
  this sounds like a task that will take some considerable time and resources . 
  i suggest you try contacting some freelance excel vba programmer who can help you build your solution or see how feasible it is . 
   which is basically a simplified tf2, 
  care to explain ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious how tf2 can be even simpler ? 
  as far as i know , overwatch even has way more characters . 
  my experience : i have played wow a few years back , never a lot but i 'd say i have a rough idea of the universe . 
  i went into the movie not expecting anything and not knowing all the names and backgrounds , just a general idea from the games . 
  ** my ** biggest issue was that a lot of characters showed up without any sort of introduction . 
  furthermore , they did n't even have enough screen time for any one specific character so you could actually start caring about them . 
  some of the cgi looks pretty poor as well . 
  when i left the cinema , i was actually super disappointed . 
  not having high hopes , i still felt it under-delivered . 
  the romance was actually the worst and could have easily done without . 
  the more days pass since i watched it , the more the disappointment faded and is replacement with a more neutral standing towards the movie . 
  i 'm happy people enjoyed it and i want it to succeed to open the way for more fantasy movies but for me personally , it did n't have any memorable moments . 
  i actually just eat oatmeal with milk , just like regular cereal . 
  works just fine . 
  ah , that 's good to know . 
  thank you, 
  thanks for the response . 
  the fair use does make sense . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  guess it still leaves the question of how it works in term of legal aspects but i think the other comments covered that i think . 
  thank you , 
  i bought evoland 2 a week ago in he steam sale after having the same issue with the first one . 
  the change in playstyle now serves an actual purpose since you 're moving through time a lot . 
  but it 's not only the graphics that change , it 's also he game play itself . 
  mostly it 's top down action rpg style but you have side scrolling , top down flight mode , turn based combat , 2d beat em up , lots of different things . 
  since i get bored easily with the same game concept , this is actually very refreshing . 
  it 's such a massive improvement to the first one . 
  hope this helps, 
  you might be able to use vlookup, 
  you can combine them like shown [ here ] ( http://www.mbaexcel.com/excel/how-to-use-the-vlookup-hlookup-combination-formula/ ), 
  my condolence , that 's terrible . 
  you got some pretty good advice in this thread already and i agree that it 's important to not hold back and just cry . 
  2 things i would suggest :, 
  * if possible , try to put her things away for now .
