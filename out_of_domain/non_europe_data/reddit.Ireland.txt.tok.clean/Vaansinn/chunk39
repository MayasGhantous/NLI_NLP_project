  do n't stare at her clothes or pictures all day long . 
  put them in a box or in a shelve for now and while it will be really painful to just `` put her away '' , it will be worse constantly walking past them . 
  in time , it will be easier to have her memory around you but for now , i would assume it prevents you from coming to terms with what happened . 
  * the best advice i can give you is to ** try and stay up as long as possible ! ** . 
  really try and bring as much time between the event and your sleep , if you do n't have to get up early tomorrow morning even better . 
  this will help you and your brain to deal with the event even better since it wo n't be as fresh in your memory . 
  if it sounds strange to you , you 'll find lots of research on that topic but i 'm sure that 's not your priority right now . 
  it will be good for your mental well being if you wait with your sleep as long as possible and will help you dealing with this experience , trust me . 
  take care, 
  hey green_lines ,, 
  i found a thread that seems to resolve your issue [ here ] ( http://superuser.com/questions/895987/summing-multiple-cells-that-match-row-and-column-criteria ), 
  i tested in a spreadsheet and it seemed to work fine . 
  i ca n't see your row or column numbers and letters so i ca n't really adjust it for you but it should be easy enough to replicate . 
  the only difference is for the date where you would need to use your helper data . 
  = sumproduct ( ( a2 : a5 = a2 ) * ( b1 : i1 < g9 ) * ( b1 : i1  g10 ) , b2 : i5 ), 
  * a2 : a5 is my column with the product names, 
  * b1 : i1 is the row with dates, 
  * g9 and g10 are my helper dates where i select what range i want to calculate, 
  * b2 : i5 is my range with values, 
  hopes the helps, 
  i guess this is resolved now ? 
  i usually just press `` esc '' . 
  while it 's not close , it deletes the content , stays in the cell and is only 1 click to delete everything that you just typed , assuming you did n't confirm any of it by pressing enter . 
  you cab change the theme to `` dark grey '' which makes it look simliar to excel 2010 . 
  it annoyed me as well but that was all i had to change . 
   the rest ensure access to abortion, 
  actually not true for ireland , in fact it 's quite a controversial topic over here . 
  not trying to nitpick but just wanted to clarify that . 
  holy crap you 're full of shit . 
  talking about `` real world '' as if you have any idea, 
  have you ever lived in europe ? 
  you can already survive on cost of the government and the ubi is not meant to change that . 
  but i guess you have done all your research already before posting about this topic . 
  the ubi is not more of a `` handout '' than you already have in place . 
  also , are you saying all unemployed are just lazy and hoping for handouts ? 
  hahaha well played mr. troll . 
  i 'll leave you to it, 
  i mentioned the whole setup to him before . 
  it 's an absolute joke . 
  thanks, 
  hey ,, 
  tenancy is registered and i was thinking of going through them . 
  if he 's unwilling or just not capable of improving things , i 'll ask him if we can find a mutual agreement for me to move out . 
  thanks for your suggestions , much appreciated , 
  thanks for doing this , 
  there was an easier way with scrolls . 
  i believe it was paralysis or sleep . 
  get 10 or so and keep the dragon mostly out of fight . 
  was n't my proudest fight but he was too tough for me . 
  the article sound like it 's a bad thing ? 
  or am i reading it wrong ? 
   this is a bad thing because people need jobs to live, 
  why would you think that ? 
  that statement is only true with capitalism but it 's not a general rule in life . 
  that 's like saying slaves need an owner to survive . 
  it 's a good thing that we get rid of all this labor . 
  it 's a big step and it wo n't be an easy transition but that 's a different story and is not only caused by electric cars . 
  big if true, 
  do n't forget about the lens flare !, 
  hey guys ,, 
  with all the pirate party movement all over europe i was wondering if ireland offered such party . 
  after a little bit of research i found the wikipedia site which states `` however as of 13/3/2011 the website is off-line and states : `` the party is winding down and as such we will not be responding to emails after the end of the month ( march 2011 ) . 
  what exactly happened to the party ? 
  did they just disappear ? 
  hey guys ,, 
  some of you might remember my last thread 2 weeks ago :, 
  thanks to the information from some of you i was able to contact a former founder.currently , i am in contact with some other members/founders and see if there is a way to get things started again . 
  however , i am still at the very beginning and i would like to know if some of you have been part of the previous pirate party team or you know someone who was . 
  i am still busy gathering everything and everyone i can find to make sure next time the pirate party does n't just vanish ... and hopefully you guys can help me with that . 
  so if you have any information or know someone from the previous irish pirate party please send me a text here on reddit or make a comment . 
  also , if you have any experience with the irish political system or can offer any form of support ( expertise , webdesign , free beer :d ) feel free to contact me too . 
  i really hope we can get things going from here . 
  ** update1 **, 
  i have created a google + page which i will use for relevant information regarding pirate party ireland and pirate party international . 
  if you have suggestions or ideas or want to help me to keep the page upated , please send me a message on reddit . 
  you can find the page here :, 
  [ pirate party ] ( https://plus.google.com/103437056411526456597 ), 
  ** update2 **, 
  the new facebook group was just founded . 
  we will start posting news and relevant information soon . 
  and that is the [ album ] ( http://imgur.com/a/uwwlz?gallery ) this image is from . 
  all credits to the creator of these images , i just thought that would be a hilarious skin , 
  ** edit1 ** i would like to also advertise the [ upvotasaur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nmzc9.jpg ) from the same album . 
  that makes it more reddit related, 
  ** edit2 ** thank you loldirtymouth , the title does indeed sound much better in ** sivhd 's ** voice, 
  i was looking for some guides/helpful information about high sec gate camps . 
  most of the stuff i find is about low or 0 sec . 
  i understand that this might not be the nicest thing to ask for a guide/some tips but since it 's part of eve , we should be able to talk about it , 
  me and a friend have done some suicide ganking in the past just for some fun and some carebear tears . 
  but since i do exploration mostly i really need something that involves a little bit more pvp ... and that 's when high sec gate camp came in to mind . 
  hours of boredom , scanning , waiting ... and the occasional , lucky hit ... i think i am mentally prepared for that ... but what would be a good ship/fitting for that ? 
  i was thinking about t3 bc but i do n't know what dps/volley i should aim for . 
  is it recommended to go for something with 150km + range to avoid gate cannons or is it something i do n't have to worry about ( since i 'll get blown up by concord anyway ) . 
  any information appreciated, 
  thanks, 
  edit : spelling, 
  the reason i am asking is because we have a release date for the next expansion and it is my understanding that this is also the date the changes will hit . 
  this information would be much more precise rather then `` summer '' . 
  people would have a specific date and also a reminder for the next expansion . 
  please correct me if i am wrong .
