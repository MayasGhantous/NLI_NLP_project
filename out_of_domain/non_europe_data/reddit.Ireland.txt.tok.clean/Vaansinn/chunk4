   can you please describe in this context where this country is letting anyone die because of anyone else 's religion ? 
  try to be specific . 
  whose religion is the state letting people die because of ? 
  again , you might have missed what 's already been said . 
  if you do n't want to accept the fact that religion had a huge influence in abortion laws then i ca n't help you , sorry . 
  but i have searched a bit to find some good articles about this topic if you want to have a read . 
  i do n't know what you consider a valid source but i hope this explains a few things much better . 
   i was suggesting that pressing td 's to act might be a more successful strategy than just blaming religion . 
  that 's not what you said . 
  you said specifically `` catholics '' . 
  i just quote you here :, 
   opposition to abortion is not a uniquely catholic stance , and other predominantly catholic countries have more liberal laws than we do . 
  of course , you can continue to blame the church if you like . 
  please do report back on how successful that strategy works out for you . 
  but my comment might have been a bit misleading . 
  the part `` works pretty well so far . '', 
  was n't related to this case . 
  of course for this case , the td would be a better place to raise voices . 
  this is n't something you can just `` give a rest '' . 
  ah , my bad . 
   sorry about that . 
  i thought this topic has been brought up too many times already . 
   you say the state would let you partner die because of someone else 's religion , apparently in relation to this case . 
  you have yet to demonstrate whose religion the state takes as a reason to let people die . 
  obviously , you 're not even willing to check the link i have provided . 
  i do n't know what else you want me to do . 
  i was stunned for a second when i saw the head popping out . 
  did n't expect this look and the feeling is still the most creepy one i have to this day . 
  what ? 
   given that the document you linked was from three years ago , it seems unlikely to describe the decision making process that happened in this case . 
  we are talking about the legislation from more than 100 years ago and what lead to those decisions and rules in the legislation , the rules that affected the decision making for the most recent case . 
  in order to find the cause for these decisions in the hospital you have to check what caused the thinking behind the decision making in 1861 . 
   so , again , in relation to this case , at what point in the medical decision-making process did the state make the decision that a woman should die , and that the reason for that decision was someone else 's ( whose ? ), 
  religion ( which religion ? ) . 
  please stop putting words in my mouth . 
  i never said anything about that the woman should die . 
  but i do n't know what else to tell you . 
  i try to explain to you that the decisions in the legislation we are talking about , offences against the person act from 1861 , are hugely influenced by religion . 
  that 's what i am talking about the whole time but you do n't seem to understand that . 
  that 's nice to hear . 
  it was always weird to play with/against people with 1000 more games . 
  but does that apply to ranked and normal games ? 
  or only one of them ? 
  ** edit : ** actually ... are you sure ? 
  because it says : i will deploy it ** globally ** when it is ready . 
  ( which may take 1-2 patch cycle ), 
  he also mentions riotkiddington . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  haha , thank you , 
  that is not entirely true . 
  someone with 1500 games will play completely different so someone with 10 games . 
  but they still might have the same win/lose ratio for various reasons, 
  in teemo 's head, 
  tell that stephenie meyer and her ginger vampires, 
  i would recommend to relax and `` analyze '' the bans and picks through the chat with your team as some form of pregame `` meditation '' . 
  not to sound like a smartarse but to start communicating with the team and to show that you are willing and able to communicate and not a dick/troll ( rickroll ? ), 
  if there is one thing you should ** not ** do like all the pro gamers who stream ( yes hotshot . . i am looking at you ) is to browse and get distracted during champ select and do n't care what everyone else is picking . 
  it would probably distract you from you anxiety but also from what 's going on in the pick/ban stage . 
  you can see a lot in that stage that gets you prepared for the first few minutes of the game . 
  and last but not least ... never instalock . 
  pick what you want and see if someone comments your pick . 
  either to clarify what position you want to play or to prevent any stupid picks . 
  that 's what i usually do and i think all that creates a relaxed start in the game . 
  i want to see a hecarim charge with all that movement speed bonus, 
  i just meant that instead of applying all these effect on rammus just apply them to hecarim and let him attack an enemy . 
  see how that works out , 
  people do n't realize how powerful his pull off cooldown is . 
  if you missed your pull the enemy knows it 's on cd and they use that chance . 
  but while your pull is off cd you could pull any second and they always stay back and are more cautious , never knowing when it 's going to happen and eventually they go crazy ... 
  in all seriousness ... it 's great to approach them while they walk like a retard because they expect a pull and you just go up and give them the power fist, 
  while this is true , they all have terrible disadvantages . 
  - hook is a skill shot that also grabs creeps, 
  - power fist is melee only, 
  - ulitmate is a silence for 0.5 sec !!, 
  i understand that each of them is annoying enough as they are but they also have their weaknesses . 
  and a silence for 0.5 sec is nothing compared to the cho ` gath aoe silence with a lower cooldown . 
  go to the gym, 
  where is my new years eve stare ??? 
  how are you ? 
  worst opener to a conversation ever . 
  the lightbringer : unique passive : nearby stealthed enemy traps arerevealed . 
  teemo will hate this item , 
  wow , have you seen the arms in the second part ? 
  they are ... not like in the beginning ... 
  i just started playing skyrim a week ago and that exactly happened to me . 
  killing the dragon and getting a bounty of 1000 gold for hitting the guard instead of the ( already ) dead dragon . 
  nothing happened after that but yeah ... i just thought i should never help them out again ... 
  `` in drill area '' ... 
  sounds like someone else 's bedroom, 
  similar stuff happens everywhere but no one talks about it . 
  about 15 years ago a girl did n't come back to school after the summer holiday . 
  only later did we find out that a stalker broke into her parents house and that they got killed by him . 
  we never heard from her again or where she moved to afterwards . 
  but this story happened in berlin , so i guess it 's not only india ... 
  why ? 
  i think it 's actually pretty good . 
  most of the time your device is above the plugs anyway and it 's rather helpful if the cable does n't go to the floor first . 
  he gained a few pounds and got younger ? 
  not bad ...
