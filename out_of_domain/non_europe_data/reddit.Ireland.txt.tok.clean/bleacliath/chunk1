  the overdot is called a s\u00e9imhi\u00fa . 
  \u1e03 \u010b \u1e0b \u1e1f \u0121 \u1e41 \u1e57 \u1e61 \u1e6b are equivalent to bh ch dh fh gh mh ph st th . 
  typewriters back in the day could n't render the dot above so it was decided to use a h instead . 
  it 's a shame because computers have no problem rendering the dot , but now were stuck with words full of useless h 's .

  [ inis me\u00e1in ( island ) , ireland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inishmaan ) and the rest of the connemara region is extremely rocky and the stones have to be removed in order to create tillable land . 
  the entire region is lined with thousands of miles of these dry stone walls . 
  some places are so barren that the farmers have to use seaweed and sand in order to * create * fields on top of bare rock . 
  the connemra region looks much the same to this day and you will [ still see farmers building stone walls ] ( https://maps.google.com/?ll=53.442813,-10.095094&amp;spn=0.002543,0.007242&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.442919,-10.095153&amp;panoid=x1g3ukvotqzkbsr-zm8y-w&amp;cbp=12,93.25,,1,12.23 ) !,

  from a cork newspaper , well worth a read :, 
  in ireland we are in rare position internationally when it comes to our media . 
  most of what we read , listen to and watch is usually interpreted in two perspectives , through our own media and through that of our near neighbours across the irish sea . 
  there are other instances of large and small neighbours with a common language ( germany and austria ; usa and canada ; australia and new zealand ) , but nowhere is the penetration of the larger nation 's media into the neighbouring market as pronounced as it is in ireland . 
  viewership of uk tv stations and readership of uk owned newspapers in ireland is at a level that makes them as significant to our view of the world as our own media . 
  this breeds a familiarity with our neighbours that can make us irish assume the british know as much about us as we do about them . 
  nothing could be further from the truth however as has been graphically illustrated by the reception given in britain to ken loach 's palme d'or winning movie the wind that shakes the barley . 
  there is no question that this film makes the british forces look bad , but of course the reality as all irish people know is that they were . 
  in the uk normally reasonable and intelligent reviewers and commentators can not cope with this depiction of occupying british forces as violent repressors of a largely defenceless native population . 
  it has been described as unbalanced and portraying the valiant british soldiers in an unfair and unflattering light . 
  the truth is that the vast majority of british citizens could n't tell you where galway is and why should they ? 
  they 're ignorance of their own colonial past so close to home and denial of it should n't surprise us ; it is not something to be proud of . 
  this is not to attack britain , but to remind irish readers of uk newspapers and viewers of uk television that britain is indeed a foreign country . 
  they view the world through an entirely different perspective than us , and in truth our views are inconsequential to them . 
  that 's why loach 's film , which tells essential truths , will not get a general release in the uk . 
  despite the fact that anglo-irish relations are probably better now than they have ever been the truth about britain 's history in ireland is something that they just are n't ready for , and probably never will be . 
  often overlooked are our [ songs in irish ] ( http://www.songsinirish.com ) . 
  here are a few classics that i 'm learning to sing and play on guitar at the moment .
