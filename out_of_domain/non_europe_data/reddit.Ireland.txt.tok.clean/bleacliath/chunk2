  80 km/h is the standard speed limit for most rural * [ boreens ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boreen ) * in ireland . 
  and no , these are n't one-way roads . 
  speed at your peril . 
  [ here 's another ] ( https://maps.google.com/?ll=53.218564,-6.147497&amp;spn=0.000944,0.002926&amp;t=h&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.218551,-6.147628&amp;panoid=wk6lfg1bq8ptnd5iomjk0q&amp;cbp=13,265.91,,0,11.7 ) . 
  nope . 
  sensible ? 
  this is ireland . 
  there is a 2 second pause and a mutual :-o face , and then one of the drivers reverses back to the next house entrance to make way for the other feithicil . 
  when the other car passes , a mutual county hand wave is exchanged . 
  for example , in county wicklow , they make a w shape with their three middle fingers . 
  if you do n't know the hand wave of the county , a nod will do . 
  it always works out in the end ( unless it 's a tourist ) . 
  an maith leat [ kathleen macinnes ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w7qm8x2ede ) ? 
  how can she slap ? 
  not many ozzies understand the whole ` ireland ' thing . 
  reminds me of this [ train wreck ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=fz4qn3jefe4#t=14s ) . 
  google translate source texts in english that have high quality translations in irish , and runs an algorithm to find common matches . 
  some of its primary sources are irish government publications and the * acts of the oireachtas * , which provide thousands of pages of professionally translated material in irish . 
  you can see above where the algorithm sourced a bilingual publication from the department of the environment and incorrectly matched * hol-ding * with * c\u00f3rais chosanta d\u00f3ite\u00e1in dho * . 
  note the hyphen . 
  this is quite a common error with google 's machine translation , which often leads to bewildering and sometimes [ amusing results ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yf8gq.jpg ) . 
  it shows irish speaking areas as they exist today but scots gaelic , welsh and cornish speaking areas as they existed hundreds of years ago . 
  if the map is supposed to show language status circa 1600 , most of ireland should be cyan . 
  it was only after the famine in 1845 when english became the dominant language in ireland . 
  edit : it appears they used [ this map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/scotlandgaelicspeakers2001.gif ) to show scottish gaelic speaking areas ( census data ) . 
  had they done the same for ireland , the map would look very different !, 
  ** [ here 's one i whipped up ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u5trw.jpg ) ** showing offical census data for ireland and northern ireland ( and the scottish map for comparison ) . 
  the dark areas in the west show where the language is spoken natively . 
  40 % of the irish population put themselves down as irish speakers on the census . 
  in reality , most of them could n't hold a basic conversation , but i guess it shows irish people 's aspirations for the language . 
  also , the language is compulsory in irish schools but not in northern irish schools , hence the stark difference at the border . 
  i love maps !, 
  no strenght without * hayes * . 
  the slideshow on that site is n't the best .

  context ? 
  * luaithreach * are ashes of the cremated, 
  * \u00f3n luaithreach * - from the ashes, 
  * as an luaithreach * - out of the ashes, 
  they are both . 
  in irish , a coracle is called a * curach * .

  it 's pretty common in europe actually . 
  grma as sin !, 
  not many people have heard of newgrange . 
  it was built 5,200 years ago , which makes it much older than the pyramids of giza .

  what 's special about it is that tomorrow 21st december 2012 ( and every winter solstice ) , the sun will align with the temple and illuminate its tomb . 
  i 've edited my post .

  i 've too many favorite songs as gaeilge , but [ here 's one ] ( http://www.songsinirish.com/p/sadhbh-ni-bhruinneallaigh-lyrics.html ) i 'm singing at the moment . 
  i do love a bit of sean-n\u00f3s . 
  surnames as gaeilge have a space after mac and \u00d3 . 
  hard to tell the difference with [ rt\u00c9 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyljjh8hqdg ) sometimes . 
  looking at the source code , it seems they have the language incorrectly set to gaeilge-gb . 
  sin \u00e9 . 
  one great aid is to learn through song . 
  i frequently read and listen to the lyrics if irish songs and try to improve my pronunciation . 
  children 's songs are great for new learners . 
  [ this song ] ( http://www.songsinirish.com/p/beidh-aonach-amarach-lyrics.html ) is a nice and easy . 
  is brea liom spotafaigh . 
  inis me\u00e1in is a remote island of the west coast of ireland . 
  this photo was taken in the 60s and shows a women and her granddaughter taking pails of water to the schoolhouse . 
  she is wearing a knitted shawl , which was typical [ gaelic dress ] ( http://antoilean.blogspot.com.es/2012/12/old-colour-photos-of-ireland-in-1913.html ) that lasted up until the 80s . 
  the islanders have to build high , dry stone walls in order to clear the land for farming - this is a very unique feature to the west of ireland . 
  inis me\u00e1in is part of the [ gaeltacht ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaeltacht ) , a government-protected region where the irish language is spoken natively . 
  yep . 
  there are two other islands on either side of inis me\u00e1in which are n't as rocky , so the walls are lower !, 
  i 've been reporting basic errors like [ this one ] ( http://translate.google.com/#en/ga/i%20am%20irish . ), 
  for years and they still have n't fixed them . 
  i have my doubts on whether google even has an irish speaker tending to the system . 
  lovely tune : [ d\u00f3nal \u00d3g ] ( http://songsinirish.com/p/donal-og-lyrics-gaeilge.html ) . 
   the flight of the wild geese . 
  that was ... after the battle of the boyne , 1691 . 
  the people who lost to william of orange , they could n't go back to the lands they left , and as a result , they had two choices -- either to be killed , or go away into other european countries . 
  so they went away to france and spain and greece . 
  and this song was dedicated to one of them -- d\u00f3nal \u00d3g , ` young donal . ', 
  the curriculum is an absolute disaster and needs a drastic overhaul . 
  i would advocate doing away with irish class altogether and replacing it with irish cultural studies tr\u00ed ghaeilge . 
  the classes would be like workshops where everybody sits around in a circle and partakes in fun activities through irish like word games , acting , and singing . 
  you could do plays of irish mythology , partake in trad seisi\u00fains , and learn a few modern [ pop songs as gaeilge ] ( http://songsinirish.com/pop ) . 
  that way students would be engaged and actually learning something , and most importantly , speaking irish with each other . 
  the reading and writing would come a whole lot easier after that . 
  we should be aiming to make at least 25 % of our public schools gaelscoils by 2050 . 
  if the irish free state had made that a priority 90 years ago , we could have had a majority of gaelscoils today and a bilingual population . 
  there is a huge demand for irish schools in this country but thousands of children are turned down each year . 
   there is no ` o ' in the word number, 
  there is in * numero * , which the abbreviation comes from . 
  [ seo duit ] ( http://gaelshirt.spreadshirt.ie/buala-bus-a12986378/customize/color/5 ) . 
  there are a few errors in it but it says something like :, 
  * you are a beautiful girl , my love . 
  the girl that ( i ) would love on this green earth . 
   i 'm having a terrible time figuring out the pronunciation, 
  this is often cited as a big obstacle to learners of irish . 
  when i was learning irish , i tackled it by learning [ songs in irish ] ( http://songsinirish.com/ ) . 
  i did the same for spanish . 
  read the lyrics , listen to the pronunciation , learn the song , sing it again and again until you understand it . 
  i 'm telling you , it will improve your pronunciation to no end , and it 's fun .
