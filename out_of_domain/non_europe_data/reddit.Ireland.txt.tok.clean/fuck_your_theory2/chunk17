  how is this fringe theory related to ian paisley ? 
  apart from the fact he considers himself to be british ? 
  itt people doing mental gymnastics to justify their drinking habits . 
  so edgey !, 
  rijndael is virtually identical to aes . . 
  i must have missed the irony !, 
  i reported it to youtube for copyright violation . 
  hope this helps , 
  dioxins and pcbs for all !, 
  fraid not http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polychlorinated_biphenyl, 
  this is retarded . 
  you are retarded . 
  you really do n't want to be around when drunk fedora wearing redditors start shouting memes at each other . 
  you think we are actually neutral . 
  how quaint !, 
  reddit is a circle jerk . 
  to da mooon !, 
  any tips for making linked in work ? 
  all i seem to get off it is spam despite a relatively ok profile . 
  it is a huge area with many different job descriptions . 
  it does n't just cater for it graduates . 
  one of the most successful people i know is in an it sales role and that chap dropped out of his leaving to do carpentry . 
  liking `` it '' is as meaningless a statement as liking office furniture . 
  there is more to it than being a coder . 
  there are loads of positions for tech support or systems engineers . 
  just watched the last episode last night :(, 
  get in at ground floor . 
  that shit is going to the moon !, 
  at least some public awareness of people dying due to alcohol consumption is occurring . 
  it a major cause of preventable deaths and it is essentially ignored . 
  all this stupid craze has done is highlight it . 
  seems like the ballsy thing to do is turn your goldplated high rated comment into a gostse link . 
  what sort of lens / camera is this ? 
  depending on the judge you might get a conviction . 
  yeah most of these are nonsense . 
  that particle accelerator for instance had little to do with the development of nuclear weapons . 
  i can give you a single dogecoin . 
  hope this helps !, 
  another one of our exported piss heads gets kicked out of a bar , almost gets arrested , chants a sectarian song and then runs off . 
  where exactly is the `` hilarity '' . 
  yep they have really become a quality read lately . 
  good for you, 
  zero . 
  unless you get any on him . 
  in the future we are going to have loads of interesting photos documenting interesting events that are all ruined by shitty instagram filters . 
  of course detail is lost . 
  look at the sky it 's totally burned out . 
  the colours are washed out and there is an artificial grain . 
  and to top it off the resolution is really small . 
  these problems are n't repairable afterward because the detail of the original photo is lost !, 
   the sky 's bright because the ** iso is focused ** at the brickwork, 
  the ** exposure ** is adjusted based on what the camera is focused on or what the phone decides to meter it on . 
  it * may * be the cause of the burned out sky but we will never know since the filter has also modified the original image . 
  it does n't just rely on iso either . . 
  if you are going to attempt to claim another person does n't know what they are talking about you should probably make sure you do !, 
  and we know that how ? 
  i find looking right through them and not slowing down does the trick . 
  the whole thorium debate is confused . 
  when you drill into it , it 's just another nuclear power plant with a different fuel cycle . 
  it carries with that a lot of the same baggage nuclear plants do . 
  it is also unproven on a large scale . 
  a lot of the claims the thorium advocates make are based on theoretical reactor designs . 
  personally i 'm a big supporter of nuclear because i think it is the best way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the future . 
  i do n't think thorium is the solution just yet . 
  ~ ~ this is a good read : http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/23/thorium-nuclear-uranium~~, 
  ninja edit : correct article : http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/13/thorium-alternative-nuclear-fuel-overstated, 
  no my argument boils down to throium 's benefits are overstated due to the wildly enthusiastic hype surrounding it . 
  * it is still a proliferation risk . 
  nuclear weapons fuel can still be generated in a thorium fuel cycle . 
  * you still need plutonium or uranium to start or sustain a thorium chain reaction . 
  * while the fuel cost is lower and apparently more abundant , fuel cost is not a major cost in nuclear plants as it is in fossil fuels . 
  scarcity of uranium is not driving the cost of nuclear power . 
  the cost of tooling up for a thorium fuel cycle could dwarf the cost of the actual raw materiel . 
  after decades of trying nobody has made a commercially viable thorium reactor . 
  they may succeed in the future but it wo n't be the panacea the hype would have you believe . 
  edit : i linked the wrong article !, 
  this is the one i meant to link : http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/13/thorium-alternative-nuclear-fuel-overstated, 
  they are decommissioning their oldest reactors which is great news from a safety point of view . 
  they will be building at least 12 new reactors to replace them . 
  nuclear plants tend to have a few reactors to cover maintenance and fueling . 
  1 medium sized plant would probably cover all of ireland but not a great idea to be so over reliant on one source of energy !, 
  most nuclear plants contain multiple reactors . 
  we would only need a medium sized plant to cover our power consumption . 
  nice to see rehab going out of it 's way to silence critics rather than attempt to come clean and restore trust . 
  vents are often a modern addition . 
   52 crumlin road , dublin , ireland, 
  one of these ? 
  ah ok make more sense now . 
  the first reaction from all parties , the gaurds , the media and the government was to blame gsoc . 
  the question of them being possibly bugged was ignored and still to an extent is . 
  shatter has been consistently saying there was no definitive evidence of bugging when there the report gsoc commissioned according to security experts does contain tell tale signs of bugging . 
  there has been concerted attempts at misdirection , mudding the waters and attempts to make gsoc and verrimus look incompetent . 
  the whole thing stinks . 
  shatter could have killed this whole issue last week by being open and ordering a full investigation . 
  instead there has been a constant drip drip drip of contradicting evidence . 
  a judge led inquiry/review like announced this week would have been a start . 
  those same people would n't be giving out if this issue was dealt with last week . 
  the only reason we need an investigation now is there is doubt in the account shatter gave to the dail . 
  newspapers and statements by simon o'brien have cast doubt on it . 
  yay \\ o /,
