  i wonder what mcdowell 's stance on shatter 's wide ranging reforms of the legal profession is . . 
  nope . 
  could someone eli5 what benefits larger colliders give you ? 
  yeah, 
  rent allowance was cut on the faulty assumption that it would cause rents to drop . 
  that has n't happened . 
  in fact the opposite has , rents have risen . 
  there is currently a squeeze in the rental market with fewer units available than ever . 
  there is virtually nothing available in dublin like a family 3 bed semi that is covered by rent allowance . 
  there is also no new social housing coming on stream , as well as a council house stock that is vastly depleted and in many cases not maintained . 
  there are virtually no new houses being built which keeps a lot of first time buyers in the rental market . 
  we can also expect to see buy to let investors being repossessed further depleting the rental market . 
  there is the makings of a perfect storm in the housing market . 
  you may have a 3 bed house in cork for $ 800 , but who the fuck wants to live in cork ? 
  this rapidly turns into something like the village drunk shouting at a bouncer for not letting him in . 
  nothing solid yet . 
  there are claims he has mislead the dail , covered up garda errors , corruption and spying . 
  doubts still remain after all his attempts to explain everything away . 
  i think he is one of the better ministers too . 
  but he seems mired in controversy on the gsoc and garda issues . 
  a few medium size highrise apartments in the city center would take pressure off the rental market . 
  it make too much sense i ca n't see it being done . 
  coming soon , a tulip dispenser !, 
  ron paul rubles are doomed to failure, 
  what problematic fission by products ( caesium , strontium , iodine , etc ) have been deposited around fukishima ? 
  how will they impact the lives of residents in the years to come ? 
  everyone else delete your comments , pete has just won reddit . 
  ok lets make a list of why these people are cunts :, 
  * you are causing an obstruction or parking where you should n't ** lets force those people to park there longer !, 
  ** genius !, 
  * the other car parked awkwardly beside the last spot forcing you to park just over the line : ** that 's a clamping **, 
  * they stake out near car parks that have unclear signage . 
  * you park in someone else 's spot because someone parked in yours . 
  ** that 's a clamping **, 
  * you can be clamped for absolutely no reason and you must pay the fine to get the bloody thing off . 
  * they are for the most part the most ignorant , ill mannered dickheads that can manage to get a paying job . 
  * you pay the fine even though you have done nothing wrong ( they wo n't remove it otherwise ) and you appeal the fine which is rejected because it is the clamping company who handle the appeal and they are totally unregulated . 
  to the people who say they are only doing their job , that was the excuse the nazis used . 
  yes it 's a goodwin , fuck you i do n't care . 
  that sounds reasonable but i 've seen them clamp people in situations like this too . 
  shhh do n't be disturbing the `` americans r dum '' circlejerk . . 
  irish people are shocked we are n't at the center of the universe . 
  consider donating to merchants quay . 
  getting knocked out by a blow to the head is n't like in cartoons . 
  it is a serious brain injury . 
  it can have serious lasting effects apart from potentially killing the victim . 
  you are an idiot . 
  such as ? 
   neutrality . 
  in name only . 
  same shite organization different shite name . 
  every time i see videos like this i 'm thankful camera phones did n't exist when i was younger . 
  neeevar ( \u256f \u00b0 \u25a1 \u00b0 \uff09 \u256f \u253b \u2501 \u253b, 
  i can do this all day ( \u256f \u00b0 \u25a1 \u00b0 \uff09 \u256f \u253b \u2501 \u253b, 
  not even tired ( \u256f \u00b0 \u25a1 \u00b0 \uff09 \u256f \u253b \u2501 \u253b, 
  what ? 
  there is no doubt there was some anti-semitic type abuse levelled at him before these scandals . 
  a read of some of the bile posted by some on politics.ie when ever he is mentioned is proof enough this sentiment exists . 
  however that is not the reason he is in trouble . 
  the fact his department has been mired in crisis recently has n't covered him with glory . 
  i support a lot of the reforms he has pushed through but his handling of the gsoc , whistleblowers and bugging scandles has been poor . 
  it seems his department has been a source of crisis after crisis since the start of the year . 
  somethings got to give . 
  so glad i quit that crap . 
  newspapers do n't care about harm reduction , just about pushing the drugs are bad message . 
   the country has been waist deep in ghosts for the last year and they were around for years before that in less supply so until there 's some actual information i 'm just going to presume these people were legless drunk who happened to take a yoke and it just did n't react well with them . 
  i guess the key message is once one particular ` brand ' takes off , everyone else copies the design . 
  some of these operators do n't know or do n't care that they are making pills with more harmful compounds in them . 
  without testing it is impossible to tell which ones are good and which ones are bad . 
  a thing to i do when i 'm bored is put gangland figures in the papers into facebook . 
  it 's a different world . 
  some ( constructive ) criticism . 
  - - horizon not level, 
  - - blurry ( camera shake or slow shutter speed ), 
  + + good contrast between bright sun and low key ships and background . 
  + + interesting use of sky , horizon and sea . 
  got to start somewhere , 
  shatter has probably done enough to survive for now . 
  its probably more accurate to say they * can * indicate * some * harmful substances . 
  better than nothing but by no means complete safety . 
  that 's leaving aside the potential long term effects from the * good * stuff which is far from certain . 
  the people at the top get paid everyone else gets nothing . 
  professional for those in charge amateur for everyone else . 
  breaking a word up like this rarely gives it 's actual meaning . 
  in this case it 's widely accepted that the meaning of antisemitism is equivalent to anti-jewish . 
  your interpretation of the word is both bookish and incorrect . 
  well now you are making a value judgment . 
  if you have such a problem with the semantics of the word antisemitic you have immense difficulty with the english language which is full of words and phrases like this . 
  your argument is based on rhetoric not actual reality . 
  any they still ca n't supply fruit and veg that i would eat . 
  did you change the size based on the scale of the map ? 
  different areas have different scales in google maps . 
  edit : down votes for a valid question ? 
  fuck you reddit !, 
  ok could you go to another health system with your smoking related diseases and then the government can stop annoying you ? 
  if you expect to be looked after by the public health system i do n't think it is unreasonable for the government to have public health initiatives that aim to keep the population healthy . 
  personally i do n't care what substances you choose to ingest but it do object to picking up the health bill for other peoples vices . 
  i think it 's preferable that people did n't get seriously ill in the first place rather than spending money attempting to care for them afterwards . 
  ah the `` thin end of the wedge '' argument . 
  you raise a good point about alcohol and it 's costs on our health service .
