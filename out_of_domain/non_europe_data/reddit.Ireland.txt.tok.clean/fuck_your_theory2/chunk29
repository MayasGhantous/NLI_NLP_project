  so the money you pay for your water actually will go to where it should . . 
  there is a difference between peacefully protesting and obstructing work . 
  they had a chance to protest but there was little interest from the population . 
   also whats with using words like militant ? 
  whats miltant about protesting water charges ? 
  militant in the context of protesting refers to actions that verge on civil disobedience to outright lawbreaking . 
  its use in this case is from the hard left labour movements that practiced it in the 70s and 80s and the same brand of politics / activism the arrested cllr subscribes to . 
   the road where it happened had about 20-40 people protesting during the week there was at least 8 guards there yesterday . 
  for during the day ( construction goes at 9am-2pm ) that 's a good turnout . 
  people decide at the ballot box who to elect . 
  people do n't decide the issues . 
  people decide who decides the issues . 
  your road might not like it but that 's democracy !, 
  if the population as a whole did n't want water charges so badly they could have elected tds from the far left allience or whatever they are called . 
  unsurprisingly going on poll numbers their extreme stance on a whole range of issues carries little water with voters . . 
  i 've already explained it . 
  perhaps you should reread what i posted . 
   oh give me a break , you use militant to paint the protestors in a negative light . 
  you assumed the negative connotations . 
  this term has a different meaning in the context of far left politics in particular the `` struggle '' espoused by trotskyists and far left socialist types . 
  have a look into the politics of the united left allience and you will see why i chose this term . 
   do you even realise the protestors are sticking up for you as much as everyone else, 
  their ( the united left alliance ) theories on how the world works have been consigned to the dustbin of history . 
  as for water charges . 
  they are a necessary evil . 
   arent the only people protesting , people every stripe from all over the country are , every county , every party , every age , every socio economic background , you 'd know this if you actually left the house once in a while, 
  there is a reason why these protests are being ignored . 
  they do n't have popular support . . as the massive medical card protest by the over 70s a few years ago proves governments do listen when they have no choice . . 
  but when its a few small militant protests led by by the usual serial protesters , why would they . . 
  i 'm sorry you feel this way . 
  i 've plenty of backbone thanks, 
  local authorities used to look after it . 
  they were funded from general taxation and local taxation . 
  none invested sufficiently in water infrastructure and there was no national body to oversee it . 
  that 's why we have a new water bill and a new water company . 
  water was underfunded , new money from water rates goes straight to water infrastructure . 
  frank feighan fg td for roscommon/south leitrim is the chap throwing the slaps . 
  the guy on the receiving end is a bye election candidate . 
  and the water meters . 
  get a better lock !, 
  the one you have can be cut with a snips . 
   word of warning first , dublin on halloween night can resemble a warzone . 
  yes this can be the case . . 
   the cobblestone , smithfield . 
  why recommend ground zero ? 
  it 's whatever coca-cola have decided to brand their bottled water as in the uk, 
  waterford whispers is probably my favorite irish site after boards.ie . 
  antagonize gardai , security or workers by getting in their way , abusing them or even assaulting them . 
  record reaction on video , removing incriminating evidence . 
  post video on youtube crying police brutality . 
  that 's the point of the water charges . 
  they are ring-fenced for water infrastructure . 
  previously local authorities were responsible for water architecture . 
  their under-funding and neglect of the system is the reason why our water infrastructure is in such a poor state . 
  because public ownership has worked out so well . . 
  sponge bath ? 
  this guy should be prevented from penning any more `` excellent '' open letters for his hotel 's sake . 
  perhaps he may have a point . 
  but writing an open letter dripping with sarcasm , bemoaning an entire nationality and threatening legal action is not the way to deal with it . 
   what do you think is the correct way to deal with a trend of faux complaints that are tantamount to blackmail ? 
  not post about them on facebook for starters . 
  for example , how would genuine people with complaints feel if they saw that ? 
  i 'd wager if he really is having such a huge problem with bad reviews the problem might lie with the standard of his hotel rather than people actively setting out to take the piss . 
  it 's not worth pissing off a few genuine customers to sort out the chancers . 
  have a look at the pictures on tripadvisor , the place looks pretty awful . 
  the only people that seem care about energy policy right now are the people who do n't want to be near it . 
  until we have a shortage or a crisis most people do n't care . 
  essentially the only people making noise on the issue are the nimbys, 
  ** the sun gives you cancer **, 
  solar energy is dangerous !,

  it 's a bit more complicated than that . 
  some cycle lanes can be parked in during certain hours . 
  i do n't know this stretch of road but some roads have signage indicating this . 
  as for parking on the footpath being illegal , this must be one of the most ignored traffic regulations in the country if this is true . 
  what a waste of cpu cycles . 
  not many minimum wagers are employed in the energy sector . 
  for the sake of your health ( and wallet ) at least consider vaping . 
  pardon my ignorance but i 've been off the smokes for a few years . . is 24 benson a thing now ? 
  been done a million times . 
  in fairness this is n't the first time their twitter monkey has screwed up . 
  lots of people shouting memes . 
  seriously . 
  drinking `` culture '', 
  the routine of drinking to excess . 
  the problems it causes and the collective denial the country seems to be in . 
  i 've suspected for a long time shinner bots were vote brigading this sub . 
  someone should let the admins know so they can investigate that subreddit . 
  that sucks but luckily they did n't steal your entire bike . 
  bikes locked with a d lock on the top tube like that are vulnerable to the thief using the bike as a lever to bust the d lock off . 
   but is it possible the irish governemnt has orchestrated the country 's property market into a brief boom to maximise returns on nama 's selling off of assets ? 
  remember more fine gael and labour voters own houses than do n't !, 
  the correct answer is flat handle bars are more likely to get caught in other people 's drops in group rides . 
  your cognitive dissonance is uncanny . 
   anyone have any positive stories about [ insert race here ] ? 
  does this sort of bigotry deserve an answer ?
