  who gives a fuck what some government pencil pusher thinks . 
  what the fuck would we gain by this apart from some warm and fuzzy moral victory ? 
  would it be worth souring relations with one of our biggest trading partners ? 
  you have n't answered my question . 
  expect a lot awkward of shouting of memes and fedoras . 
  they should but they rarely do . 
  in the international sphere power politics is the name of the game . 
   you should not ask what we might gain . 
  you should ask how we may act ethically and in such a manner as to ensure people are treated with dignity and given full access to their rights . 
  we will not gain anything . 
  we have a great deal to potentially lose . 
  from a practical point of view the us has a great deal of leverage over us . 
   i value rights and ethics as overwhelmingly more important than commerce and trade . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but you appear to be making a ` means to an end ' argument . 
  i hold that we should never sacrifice rights and ethics in the pursuit of money . 
  you view of international affairs is entirely black and white and even a bit naive . 
  we have seen concerted efforts by the us to get snowdon back . 
  the implication is that the administration will either overtly or covertly sanction nations that do not cooperate . 
  in international affairs there are no friends , only interests . 
  it is not in our interest to grant his asylum request . 
  your approach is entirely driving by idealism . 
  we do n't live in an ideal world . 
  edit : it did n't take long for your argument to reference nazis . 
  nice godwin you dope . 
  you seem entirely divorced from reality !, 
  perhaps you should find your happy place for a while . 
  what 's next for you great argument ? 
  picking up on spelling mistakes ? 
  perhaps you should stick to the my little ponies . 
  these complex issues seem difficult for you to follow . 
  lol, 
  maybe not for home owners in arrears . 
  search engine optimization , profile building , free advertising ... 
  it seems a good quantity of irish journalists have skin in the property game . 
  no wonder the constant cheerleading articles . 
  pity about the low light noise the picture does n't look too bad apart from that . 
  a half decent camera and a tripod and you would have a very nice shot . 
  a tripod lets you take longer exposures without worrying about shake . 
  for stuff that does n't move , you will get better results with a tripod , lower iso and longer exposure than high iso alone . 
  there is an exemption specifically for gardai on duty . 
  two words . 
  zaytoon deliver . 
  complain to comreg and/or the data protection commissioner . 
  the most relevant comment is buried under the vast weight of, 
  `` lol herp derp juctice porn '' posts . 
  reddit can be so retarded sometimes . 
  i quote :, 
   `` it was you that created the funds for that mortgage , it sounds a bit mad does n't it . 
  but that 's what we found out over the last two years . 
  which is why we know it 's all void '', 
  it 's all bullshit . 
  the fact that they did n't sign whatever form is just a cock up . 
  it does n't render the whole process void , it just means another trip to court to rubber stamp the eviction process . 
  their fallback freeman argument is just something they pulled out of their collective arse . 
  it was enough to plant the seeds of doubt in the officer in charge which prevented the eviction . 
  realistically it was probably less to do with the rubbish they were spewing than the public disorder it may have caused by enforcing it . 
  it 's what is called a technicality . 
  a different day and a different officer that eviction would have proceeded . 
  the rest of their argument . 
  ** bolding ** every other fucking ** word ** does n't make your shitty argument any ** more ** compelling . 
  this happens at almost every gig . 
  you sound ** like ** one of those freemen bullshit ** artists ** . 
  no wonder you ** are ** defending them . 
  ignore away , 
  fuck these guys . 
  i hope they get what is coming to them . 
  karma is a bitch . 
  it 's a disturbing video on it 's own . 
  more so to know that irish people were involved . 
  is there any update ? 
  did they find out who they are ? 
  hd equipment can still film in sd you dope . 
  should be posted to / r/cringe, 
  nope . 
  thick accents from thick rednecks .

  i agree . 
  no , you are . 
  business online works with chrome too . 
  reasons why ie is still no . 
  1 in medium to large businesses :, 
  firstly if your target audience is business virtually all businesses run wintell platforms . 
  ie fits into enterprise functions like group policy , centralized updates and domain integration and pcs generally have it installed by default . 
  for all of the noise about it 's standard compliance by virtue of it 's near ubiquity in busness it is a standard for business . 
  in summary , yes it sucks but everyone uses it so it does n't matter where it counts . 
  a headline 's function is to give as much information in as small a space as possible . 
  grammar and readability come second . 
  well maybe safe hell no . 
  that ladder with wet feet and the fact the teleporter is holding the whole thing up is cause for concern . 
  before people talk about how much qualified doctors earn think about this . 
  imagine the last time you had n't had very much sleep . 
  were you as capable of making correct decisions or as productive as when you were fully rested ? 
  now imagine a junior doctor approaching their 100th hour of the week . 
  they may make multiple life or death decisions in that time with fatigue affecting their decisions . 
  this is no way to run a health system . 
  it 's mentioned in virtually all guidebooks so that 's where most tourists go . 
  this may or may not be what you are looking for . 
  speak for yourself . 
  do n't include the rest of us in your self-loathing . 
  rubbish ( pardon the pun ),
