  [ have a look at what robert fisk has to say ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/hezbollahs-war-in-syria-threatens-to-engulf-lebanon-8632689.html ) about their role in syria , the impression i got is that they are playing with fire here which might result in the conflict spreading to lebanon . 
  on another note , the article does seem unfair in accusing ireland of blocking hezbollah 's blacklisting . 
  it seems to be merely quoting the israeli govt . 
  's position and that of israeli officials in dublin rather than seeking an alternative point of view . 
   personally i think it 's one of the most undemocratic thing 's i 've ever seen . 
  germany created a dictatorship through democracy , and now it looks like kenny is doing his damndest to loosen the strength of democracy here . 
  it did n't take long for [ godwin 's law ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/godwin's_law ) to be proven correct on this thread . 
  i 'm in favour of abolishing it . 
  i 'm not opposed to upper houses like the seanad so long as they are directly elected by universal suffrage and not by panels or by appointment by the taoiseach . 
  perhaps one or two senators from every county ( loosely along the lines of the us senate ) would do the trick , but that would naturally mean it would have the power to overturn legislation and not just delay it like at present . 
  but the idea that certain seats should be reserved for university graduates [ as proposed elsewhere ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/blogs/poplife/2013/05/27/democracy-matters-seanad-reform/ ) seems very undemocratic to me . 
  in my opinion , talk of reform has gone on for years and years with [ 12 separate reports being published on it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seanad_\u00c9ireann#calls_for_reform ) , yet nothing has been done as no government ( neither ff nor fg ) wants to give it the power to reject legislation nor make it more democratic . 
  instead of maintaining a 1930s style undemocratic institution , i think it should go . 
  by the way , i asked a similar question a few days ago [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1fgki5/thoughts_on_the_campaign_to_save_the_seanad/ ), 
  pardon my ignorance but do you mean this [ sam harris ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sam_harris_ ( author ) ) ? 
  montserrat is now mostly abandoned unfortunately as the volcano there [ erupted in 1995 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montserrat#volcano.2c_exclusion_zone.2c_transport ) . 
  apparently two thirds of the population was forced to flee so i wonder where the black irish are now . 
  do n't waste your time , speedymeepmeep is clearly an alt of one / u/gregorybarnes , an infamous troll on this subreddit . 
  el crimen ferpecto ( esp ) is a good one if you like black humour . 
  that 's quite a story and incredible since you created your account 5 minutes ago and seem to have very good knowledge of what gregory barnes thinks . 
  well mcdowell has claimed that there [ no muppets in the seanad ] ( http://www.thejournal.ie/michael-mcdowell-muppets-clowns-dail-seanad-939374-jun2013/ ) while claiming there are a few in the dail , such as ming flanagan , mick wallace and michael healy rae . 
  the key difference though is that , like them or loath them , those people were elected . 
  as for the muppets in the seanad my list would include [ ronan mullen ] ( http://www.thejournal.ie/ronan-mullen-abortion-newtown-double-think-721352-dec2012/ ) , [ terry leyden ] ( http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/ff-senator-without-the-right-to-life-you-have-no-school-592671.html ) and [ fidelma healy eames ] ( http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/senator-mortified-after-car-seized-for-having-no-tax-26882891.html ) . 
  the crucial difference is that these muppets have n't been elected by anybody other than a panel or by appointment . 
  that 's why i really think the seanad should go . 
  i did n't have time to do much this week i 'm afraid .

  have a good week . 
  hard luck mate , but do n't sweat it . 
  i 'm sure you 're doing fine !, 
  what were they doing driving along the beach ? 
  exactly and it 's all based on what the judge reportedly said . 
  there 's no guarantee that those were his exact words . 
   i ca n't help thinking the poor putty tat . 
  seriously ? 
  i 'm shocked that you would n't condemn this . 
  nobody should be threatened for their opinions . 
  if his constituents disagree with his stance on abortion they can vote him out , but threats like this are not only illegal but highly immoral too . 
  i 'm not sure i entirely agree , but i thought it was interesting nonetheless . 
  is that a book on irish that i see on your shelf ? 
  i 'd set up a class on [ italki ] ( http://www.italki.com ) or find a language partner there . 
  that would help you practice and fit into your schedule . 
  good luck !, 
  thanks for the information although to be fair o'duffy was n't a fascist at the time and embraced the ideology in 1933 , after the creation of the army comrades association ( the blueshirts ) . 
   he deletes any even partially negative comments from his blog , googles himself [ ... ], 
  what makes you say that about him deleting negative comments ? 
  i 've seen a few on his site . 
  as for googling himself , i 'm pretty sure google analytics for his site points him to such threads . 
  i should add that i am a fan of benny 's site , even if i do n't always agree with his point of view . 
  i see blogs as similar to your favourite radio programmes , you may not always agree but you still tune in . 
  i had a reasonably good week . 
  * one italki class to practice conversation . 
  i feel i 'm slowly improving on that front .

  either way , the sooner this woman is out of a job the better . 
  i totally agree with you that it 's unfair op and , if i 'm not mistaken , it 's illegal too . 
  however , the same thing also happens all over the world . 
  i 'm not trying to justify it , i 'm just saying that that should be born in mind . 
  if you can report ads on daft then i 'd do that , as saying `` females only '' counts as gender discrimination . 
  alright , fair enough . 
  [ i 'm getting so sick of mr. 
  assange .

  brilliant answer !, 
  thank you so much . 
  that seems like a good idea to me . 
  there are a lot of people in this country who worked in construction and are now unemployed . 
  green technology and energy efficiency schemes ( like installing solar panels/insulating houses ) could partially solve some of those structural problems . 
  i was on holiday this week so i 'm afraid to say i did n't do anything . 
  i will be back to it this week though . 
  same here !, 
  can anybody recommend a better bank that does n't charge such ridiculous rates ? 
  not too much to report i 'm afraid . 
  i am snowed with work since i got back from holidays .

  i asked a [ relatively similar question here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/18dyc8/how_prevalent_was_sexual_violence_in_prisons/ ) a few months back . 
  according to viktor frankl 's account * [ man 's search for meaning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/man%27s_search_for_meaning ) * , sexual assault among inmates was very uncommon and quite unlike prisons generally . 
  however , the question of sexual assault or abuse from the non-prisoner population is another issue which i will leave to somebody else to shed light on . 
  i hope that helps anyway .

  when in dublin again ( assuming you are heading back from there ) , go to a pub called the bernard shaw on richmond street for a few drinks on the weekend . 
  it 's got a good vibe and an alternative atmosphere .
