  otherwise , try couchsurfing and hostels as others have said . 
  safe travels and good luck . 
  hello everybody .

  have a good one . 
  for a broader picture , you might want to try * [ ireland in the 20th century ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/ireland-in-the-20th-century/dp/0099415224/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1374644178&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ireland+in+the+20th+century ) * by tim pat coogan . 
  coogan is fairly biased against certain individuals and is famous for publishing a highly critical biography of de valera , but his work is generally thorough . 
  for easter 1916 itself , look up charles townshend 's * [ easter 1916 ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/easter-1916-rebellion-charles-townshend/dp/0141012161/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1374644236&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=easter+1916 ) * . 
  i hope that helps . 
  there is even a [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/team_lowry ) about the backbone of support he has built up to protect himself . 
  it sickens me that his constituents do n't demand somebody else to represent them who does n't have as many criminal investigations against him . 
  if they want the roads fixed and so on , could n't they find somebody else to do it ?

  you should n't have compared barack obama debating the abolition of the us senate to kenny debating the abolition of the seanad . 
  one is directly elected by the people and is thus a major component of america 's democracy , whereas the seanad is neither . 
  despite not being proportionally representative in terms of population ( both california and rhode island have two senators despite the huge difference is population ) , the us senate has the power to block legislation whilst the seanad ca n't . 
  also the seanad has not exercised the power to delay legislation in almost fifty years ( since 1964 ) . 
  perhaps there is need for a debate , but those comparisons seem like hyperbole to me . 
  as for the house of lords , there was a [ vote in the house of commons back in 2007 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_lords#2010.e2.80.93present ) on potential ways it could be reformed . 
  it was n't a simple yes/no vote , but instead a number different alternatives were proposed . 
  maybe that is how this should have been dealt with here . 
  i agree with you that there should be more debate . 
  i do have to disagree with you on one point though :, 
   seanad does have a percentage elected by the citizens eligible to vote too so it is n't like it is all political appointments by government . 
  of the sixty senators , forty-three are elected by councillors and parliamentarians , eleven are appointed by the taoiseach and only * six * are elected by university constituencies . 
  it 's worth bearing in mind that [ thirty-eight percent of the labour force have third level degrees ] ( http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/releasespublications/documents/education/2011/educationalattainment2011.pdf ) , so the rest are excluded from voting for these few seats . 
  furthermore , as these are university constituencies , graduates from the institutes of technology are ineligible to vote .

   `` i am very happy to take the blame or responsibility if we have a macho or abrupt culture . 
  some of that may well be * my own personal character deformities . 
  i think we 're finally getting somewhere . 
  i agree with the article in that it 's fair to say that the timing of the referendum shortly before the budget is opportunistic to say the least . 
  then of course there is the issue of whether the venture is merely a means of securing the position of kenny with a populist venture . 
  but that being said there are serious arguments both for and against abolishing the seanad being put forward in the media . 
  these do n't concern the simple $ 20 million figure but the bigger issue if we want a second house or not . 
  secondly , if we are to take a swipe at our political class for opportunism then a whole load needs to fall on the pds ( or just mcdowell ) , the greens and especially fianna f\u00e1il . 
  during the 14 years fianna f\u00e1il were in power they did nothing to reform the institution , but now that they are in opposition they suggest that 's what should be done . 
  that strikes me as being along the lines of opportunistic `` punch and judy '' politics .

  it looks like the outcome of this referendum is going to be `` no '' . 
  is n't it great to know that a tiny privileged minority will continue to have a disproportionate influence on policy . 
  privileged minorities have been so good for this country so far .
