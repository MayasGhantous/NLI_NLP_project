  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_in_ireland ) however , soliciting in the street and operating brothels are n't , which means it takes place behind closed doors . 
  despite the fact that many aspects surrounding it are illegal ( like operating brothels ) , many of these are poorly enforced as evidenced by the article . 
  all in all , i would support legislation ( along with enforcement ) to make it more regulated , protect the rights of those unfortunate enough to work in it and above all to end the trafficking . 
  not too much to report again .

  pretty shameful couple of days for the people behind the allegations too . 
  the show paul connolly was apparently [ what was behind the investigation on the girl in tallaght . 
  ] ( http://www.tv3.ie/entertainment_article.php?locid=1.803.813&amp;article=116723 ), 
  that 's what i was wondering as well . 
  part of the problem many graduates are facing is that the courses have n't prepared them for the jobs that are in demand at the moment . 
  like you and others have said , there are jobs still going in it and other areas . 
  that said if he/she 's studied something that is n't in demand at the moment ( like architecture or something related to construction ) , then i completely understand his/her frustration at the few prospects available . 
  i totally agree with you and nobody has a crystal ball . 
  i did n't mean for my comment to sound like a criticism of the author . 
  i just thought this was worth bearing in mind when analysing the job situation here . 
  i do n't know why you 're being downvoted . 
  that 's a fair point , albeit a bit off topic here .

   it pissed me off that they said the children were fluent in mandarin . 
  yeah ... no . 
  i completely agree and that 's why i tried to warn people not to get their hopes up . 
  sorry about that !, 
  teaching a wider range of languages would be a good thing , but i would also be happy if students had a better level in the languages already taught . 
  still , i could n't see immersion programmes like this one existing in public schools ( a.k.a. 
  state schools in the uk ) , so i 'm afraid they are likely to remain for the privileged few . 
  did the soviet authorities have any issue with jewish survivors emigrating to israel ? 
  i know the soviet union was somewhat favourable to establishment of israel ( and was the first country to extend * de jure * recognition ) . 
  but i 'm wondering whether they would have a problem at that time with significant emigration out of the soviet union of their own citizens who happened to be jewish . 
  of course , the [ irish do n't manufacture ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ireland_export_treemap.jpg ) anything at all , nor do [ the spanish ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/spain_export_treemap.png ) or [ the italians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:italy_export_treemap.jpg ) . 
  these countries do have current account imbalances but to imply that they do n't manufacture anything is grossly inaccurate . 
  as far as i know [ aldi and lidl only have about a 10-11 percent market share between them ] ( http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2013/03/kantar-groceries.jpg ) whereas tesco is about 28 percent . 
  if they want to maintain that position , they should really think about long-term lowering of prices instead of offering vouchers . 
   you 'll be hard pressed to find anyone in dublin speaking as gaeilge , and even in remote irish-speaking areas of the island , everyone will know english so you do n't have to learn it . 
  you let the cat out of the bag . 
  we almost had a [ ` yu ming is ainm dom ' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa0a62wmd1a ) moment there !, 
  as for the op , my cousin 's a celiac so this is all second-hand information . 
  but from what he tells me you can buy products for celiacs in the supermarkets but they 're expensive .

  there is some truth to that !, 
  i know a russian girl who went to portugal and said that the accent and vowels reminded her of russian . 
  apart from that , i have to say i really admire you for reaching c2 in portuguese . 
  i saw that you recommended conjuga-me . 
  other than that , do you have any other resources that you 'd recommend ? 
  it does n't have to be that way as [ martin wolff ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b3faf9b0-2489-11e3-8905-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=intl#axzz2k2huvgbx ) , [ the european social forum ] ( http://www.social-europe.eu/category/expert-sourcing/european-growth-strategy/ ) and even [ the economist ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21588962-will-european-commission-dare-utter-unmentionable-germans-fawlty-europe ) have pointed out . 
  but the road we 're going down unfortunately is one of stagnation and deflation . 
  i think [ this is the case ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a,_b_and_c_v_ireland ) you 're referring to . 
  not to much to report i 'm afraid .

  you 're right but in some circumstances there is an overlap between the two . 
  targeting shatter because of his religion and/or ethnicity is not only wrong but also illegal . 
  it 's no more excusable if you targeted anybody else for their religious , ethnic background etc. 
  do n't forget politicians who can claim five to six figure pensions from the moment they leave office . 
  not only are their salaries excessive but they do n't even have to wait until retirement age to get a pension ( for example cowen is currently on one ) . 
  the mind boggles . 
   * the president of the league of decency , mr. leslie quelch , said yesterday that he thought the opening of the new shop was `` disgusting . 
  a man after your own heart , gregory . 
  i once heard that plankton would be affected by ocean acidification with catastrophic consequences for the ecosystem . 
  is there any truth in that ? 
   the person levelling this criticism is paid almost half a million euro out of donations made every year . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  a quick google search led me to [ this interview ] ( http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/new-goal-chief-barry-andrews-in-conversation-with-the-irish-examiner-237509.html ) in which mr. andrews claims to have a much smaller salary of 125,000 ( including his pension ) . 
  one curious case that i have come across is that of the dominican republic which became independent from spain in 1821 . 
  following repeated wars with haiti , the republic was left bankrupt and faced another haitian invasion . 
  as a result in 1861 the dictator pedro santana reverted the island to spanish rule ( the only latin american country to do so ) . 
  ** edit ** i am sorry this is a very short post but this is not an area i know a lot about . 
  hopefully somebody else can provide more information .

  have a good week everybody . 
   the court heard that mr byrne had no previous convictions and came from a good family . 
  while i support the court highlighting the fact that he has no previous convictions , i am surprised the second comment regarding his family was n't stricken from the record . 
  so what if he comes from a good family ? 
  if it 's one justice system for everybody then your family background should n't be taken into consideration at all in court . 
  it is good news but i 'd like to see more ( and proper ) cycle lanes installed to make the city more bike friendly . 
  in many cases painting the tarmac is not enough . 
  it 's worth remembering that [ other major cities ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubdf9jyj7o ) have only become bike friendly through investment and adapting their roads . 
  thanks !, 
  i listened to an episode today . 
  very interesting . 
  sorry to post this again 123kij but it 's late here . 
  this week went better than usual :,
