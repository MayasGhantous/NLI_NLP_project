  * cleared my anki deck every day . 
  * listened to an episode of caf\u00e9 brasil and escriba caf\u00e9 . 
  hope your weeks went well . 
  have a good one . 
  can you fill us in on the background to this story ? 
  i am a little lost as to when ucdsu voted for this and why this guy wants to leave it . 
  clearly then the only thing he cares about is keeping a seat . 
  not the ideology , party policy , economic record or leadership of the party he 's in . 
  to be fair , i think most of us in the republic would support a united ireland as long as it is achieved by democratic means . 
  the `` territorial claim '' that you say was removed from our constitution under the good friday agreement is [ still there if you look at it  ( http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/publications/publications_archive/publications_2012/bunreacht_na_h%c3%89ireann-march2012.pdf ), 
   it is the firm will of the irish nation , in harmony, 
  and friendship , * to unite all the people who share, 
  the territory of the island of ireland * , in all the, 
  diversity of their identities and traditions , recognising that a united ireland shall be brought about * only, 
  by peaceful means with the consent of a majority, 
  of the people , democratically expressed , in both, 
  jurisdictions in the island . 
  as for the op 's question regarding mandela supporting sinn f\u00e9in and the ira , i do n't think people want to accept that despite his enormous achievements , he was no saint and [ had many contridictions . 
  ] ( http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/12/06/peter-tatchell-nelson-mandela-was-a-gay-icon-but-he-failed-on-hiv-poverty-mugabe/ ) he never set foot in n. ireland , but it is clear that he viewed the conflict as a colonial one of sorts . 
  he was also opposed to the influence of western powers , being fiercely critical of bush and leading south africa to join the non-aligned movement . 
  at the same time he also embraced leaders vilified on both sides of the right/left divide in the west such as castro and suharto . 
  i agree with you but your views are likely to be unpopular with a lot of people on this thread with more republican views . 
  not a great week for me . 
  * 20,000 points on memrise . 
  * 2 episodes of portuguesepod and 2 of caf\u00e9 brasil . 
  * 1 hour class on italki . 
  well you know it 's probably just a simple mistake . 
  after all it 's so easy to get mixed up about which university you went to , given the time spent and expense incurred in going to one . 
  how this guy managed to become taoiseach , let alone hold public office , while spouting lies like that is beyond me . 
  i agree that donnelly is generally good at providing an independent voice in the d\u00e1il and a critical perspective on the government 's policies . 
  as you say he 's good at backing up his points and he also brings to the table an ability to engage on social media which is quite rare from an irish politician . 
  i do n't always agree with his views , but i do respect him for that . 
  however , my respect for him would greatly diminish if he did join fianna fail ( which from the article i do n't think he has denied considering ) . 
  he has served ireland well by offering an independent voice while the current government implements austerity at the demand of the troika . 
  but let 's not forget that it was fianna fail that put ireland in the position to have budgets supervised by the commission and demands made by the troika . 
  basically , the decisions taken by the last fianna fail government will negatively affect generations of irish people , with long standing high emigration and the burden of our huge national debt . 
  ** tl/dr ** donnelly would turn his back on the role he 's played so far by joining ff . 
  ** edit ** [ here 's an example ] ( http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/ff-was-arrogant-now-its-back-to-roots-28905592.html ) of just how unapologetic ff is over their role in the crisis . 
  ** edit 2 ** just had a [ look at his twitter . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/333andout/status/411168292779204608 ) apparently he wo n't be joining fianna fail . 
  yes , it goes without saying that the mutual intelligibility of english/spanish is much higher than english/chinese . 
  it 'll be interesting to see how they manage . 
  i take my hat off to both of them though for going for it , although one of them seemed to have progressed much more than the other . 
  however , my own personal preference remains on quality rather than quantity . 
   there is absolutely no doubt that class perceptions are holding back public transport usage in ireland . 
  really ? 
  not the poor service or high fares ? 
  also , why is this a middle class problem ? 
  i know plenty of people from working class backgrounds who have to drive as there 's no other way for them to get to work everyday given how long their commutes are . 
  that explains it !, 
  well , well done to both of them , they are well on the road to fluency ( and much further than i was after 3 months ) . 
  this is a question for both / u/gplnd and/or / u/seringen . 
  let me apologise first of all as my knowledge of the rwandan genocide is limited , despite my efforts to read up on the topic . 
  in rom\u00e9o dellaire 's book he mentions extrajudicial `` revenge '' killings taking place by individual rpf units in the immediate aftermath of the genocide . 
  is there any truth to that ? 
  do we have a rough idea of how widespread those killings were ? 
  do we know how the rpf high command reacted to such events ? 
  here 's a question for / u/bernardito as i have read a bit about the congo free state period but not so much about after it became a belgian colony . 
  in the previous period , the force publique was a dreaded force , well known for the violence it employed against the natives who failed to fulfil their rubber quotas or resisted . 
  another characteristic was sending troops to serve outside their own tribal areas to cause enmity between them and the locals . 
  were the any significant reforms of how it operated after the congo became a belgian colony ? 
  secondly , were there any notable incidents ( revolts or strikes ) when the force publique was employed to crush dissent as it had been used previously ? 
  sorry one more question , but this is a general one that i 've wanted to ask for some time ( especially in light of the certain laws in uganda ) . 
  broadly speaking , how was homosexuality viewed in the great lakes region * before * the arrival of the europeans and christianity ? 
  i understand that this is a very broad question so any answer would be greatly appreciated . 
  not a great week for me . 
  * 50,000 points on memrise . 
  * 1 unit of gram\u00e1tica activa . 
  * two episodes of caf\u00e9 brasil . 
  ** edit ** i forgot to mention that i also went to a portuguese language exchange . 
  i think this highlights an underlying issue with regards the sheer expense of taking a case through the legal system in ireland . 
  a case that reaches the high court ( like this one ) can run up a * six figure sum * in legal fees !, 
  i ca n't see how that helps ordinary citizens get redress through the legal system , let alone resolve constitutional matters . 
   if this is news to anyone [ ... ] then they have clearly been under a rock . 
  unfortunately , a lot of our political class our still under a rock called denial . 
   * he said in retrospect it * ( the bank guarantee ) * may have been too narrow * `` but i would still hold the view ... that it was the least worst option at the time . '', 
  - [ miche\u00e1l martin ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/mich%c3%a9al-martin-bank-guarantee-was-least-worst-option-1.1542465 ), 
   `` irish universities have always outperformed because smart students stay here , '' he said . 
  but he warned that the uk universities appreciated this and were attracting them with `` a very good offering '' . 
  by smart students , i think he means the richest . 
  not at all . 
  but i think only the wealthy would have the choice to study in the uk versus ireland , given that the fees can be three times as high plus living expenses . 
  brady was making it seem that that was a choice many parents would be considering , which is certainly not the case . 
  an alright week for me . 
  * 1 unit of gram\u00e1tica activa . 
  * 50,000 points on memrise . 
  * cleared my anki deck 3 times this week . 
  * practiced conversation for half an hour over coffee with a brazilian friend . 
  i probably wo n't do anything this week . 
  happy holidays to all . 
  i do n't approve of this video or people downplaying the horrendous violence/massacres by jihadist movements in syria . 
  but it is incontrovertible that the assad regime has carried out many massacres over the decades it has been in power . 
  look at the hama massacre in 1982 in which the city was bombarded with heavy artillery and tank fire by syrian troops under assad 's father , leading to the deaths of approximately 20,000 people ( according to robert fisk ) . 
  i agree that posting every week became a bit of a chore , but it was also a good way to keep active to have something to report every week . 
  i do n't think i 'll be interested in doing it again next year but i wish you all good luck if you do . 
  it 's funny that they should call themselves the reform alliance given that they do n't seem to want to `` reform '' anything , but rather reverse a lot of the progress we 've made with regards women 's welfare . 
  you asked for proof so here are just two examples of his incompetency :, 
  * while he was minister for finance , anglo-irish growth in loans was at a rate of [ 40 percent a year . 
  ] ( http://books.google.ie/books?id=vvevncliccgc&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ) a warning signal for a bank is usually around 20 percent . 
  as minister for finance and later as taoiseach , he did not move to rein in such serious undercapitalisation in the financial sector .
