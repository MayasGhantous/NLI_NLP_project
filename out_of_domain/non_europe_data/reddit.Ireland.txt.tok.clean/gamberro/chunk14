  * secondly , he did not move to prosecute , punish or even dismiss those who equally failed to regulate the financial sector like the former financial regulator patrick neary . 
  rather , under cowen 's government , neary received a golden parachute of over $ 600,000 euro and was told to go quietly . 
  at the end of the day , bailing out bankrupt banks and the collapse of the property bubble means that ireland now has a debt of [ almost 120 percent of gdp . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ireland/government-debt-to-gdp ) like it or not , the massively inflated speculative boom occurred under fianna fail 's watch in the 2000s and importantly under cowen 's watch under his two roles . 
  the irish taxpayer will be paying that debt off for many , many years to come . 
   long story short , there would actually be more money to go around . 
  not necessarily . 
  firstly , while the uk is a [ net contributor to the eu budget , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_budget#net_contributors_and_recipients ) it also benefits from increased trade and other benefits as a result of membership . 
  if you believe the figures , leaving the eu could cost the uk [ up to # 92 billion a year in lost income gains ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/british-business-we-need-to-stay-in-the-european-union--or-risk-losing-up-to-92bn-a-year-8622925.html ) , or # 1,200 per household . 
  secondly , if the uk were to leave and join the european economic area , it would not be able to shape the single market in ways that would greatly benefit the uk . 
  without british meps in the parliament or a british voice in the council , there would be little reason to deepen the single market into services where britain has a great competitive advantage . 
  nor would there be a voice in favour of expansion of the eu/single market to include faster growing countries like turkey . 
  that would mean less trade for british companies and possibly less prosperity for the uk as a whole . 
  i almost could n't watch that . 
  so sad !, 
  thoughts with the family at this time . 
  poor child !, 
  there 's a different electoral and party system as well to consider . 
  we have the single transferable vote which generally gives seats to smaller parties , whereas first-past-the-post means seats tend to go to larger parties . 
  besides ukip is super right-wing that is only really going to steal votes from the conservatives , whereas here our two major political parties are centre right . 
  on a final note , most irish people would n't see eye-to-eye with ukip on many things like ramped up military spending or leaving the eu , [ let alone its stance on immigration . 
  ] ( http://www.ukip.org/issues/policy-pages/immigration ), 
  i think there should be laws shaping the names lobby groups can register themselves under . 
  `` institute '' seems pretty disingenuous to say the least , as it is a lobby group not a research or academic institute as the name seems to imply . 
  but they are n't being forced to shut up . 
  breda o'brien , john waters and the iona institute clearly care enough about how they are seen with regards this issue as to threaten legal action . 
  as a result they will no doubt still express their views in the issue of gay marriage . 
  the issue at hand is that the guest two weeks ago considered such views homophobic and then qualified his reason for saying so . 
  that was just his opinion based on their published views . 
  they were free to challenge that through their newspaper articles/blogs etc. 
  however , instead they threatened rte with legal action . 
  if you ask me they are n't being forced to shut up at all . 
  ' a person who has a strong and unreasonable dislike of homosexual people . ', 
  mr. o'neill at least clearly explained why he considers the iona institute and others fall under that label . 
  repeatedly defending discrimination based on one 's sexual orientation can easily be seen as a strong belief as well as ` unreasonable ' . 
  the iona institute and those two journalists may not express ( publicly ) a dislike for homosexuals , but at the end of the day they do not like homosexuals having the same rights as heterosexuals . 
  in my view , it is debatable whether opposition to gay marriage constitutes homophobia . 
  however , this is mr. o'neill 's view on the matter and since rte are respecting the `` dissenting views '' of the iona institute ( and others ) with regards gay marriage , they at least owe mr. o'neill an apology for censoring his `` dissenting view '' on homophobia . 
  no , denis . 
  one of the biggest hurdles is the culture of entitlement among the super wealthy who feel that [ rules ] ( http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0322/298935-moriarty_background/ ) and [ taxes ] ( http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/im-not-a-tax-exile-i-pay-significant-sum-here-obrien-tells-high-court-29057930.html ) do n't ( or should n't ) apply to them . 
  equally responsible are the [ politicians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_lowry ) and the [ legal system/instruments ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moriarty_tribunal ) that allow you to get away with it . 
  there 's a video on [ youtube of david norris ] ( http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=15tio35y1li ) raising the issue of the iona institute submitting inaccurate evidence to the constitutional convention on gay marriage . 
  in it you can see ronan mullen in that video playing on his phone while norris is talking . 
  he might n't like norris ' evidence , but you can at least give the person your attention . 
  ** edit ** added a link to the video . 
   it 's reported that denis o\u2019brien owed anglo irish bank $ 833.8 million on foot of personal and corporate loans just after the lender was nationalised in 2009 , making him its then sixth largest borrower . 
  between 2009 and 2012 , * he reduced his borrowings to under $ 500m . 
  can somebody explain what broadsheet means by reducing his borrowings ? 
  they hardly wrote off $ 333 million of his bank debts ( i hope ! ), 
  i had n't considered that . 
  thanks . 
  willie frazer and his supporters really are such a toxic influence on northern ireland . 
  on another note , discrimination based on one 's political or religious opinion ( whether you agree with it or not ) is banned in most countries . 
  in ireland it would fall under the equality act 2004 and the employment equality act 1998 ( i am a nerd ) . 
  i do n't know what the situation is like in the north , but this lady could easily take legal action . 
  sorry , my bad on citing the wrong acts and her legal possibilities . 
  thanks for filling us in though . 
  can you give some examples of the policies they implement in the north that they criticise in the republic ? 
   according to youth defence , every secondary school in the country has received a colour poster that brings students through the stages of fetal development . 
  each school has also been sent booklets containing a smaller version of the poster , a quiz and a card that links to the youth defence school website . 
  i find it pretty outrageous that an organisation that refuses to [ reveal the sources of its funding ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/youth_defence#funding ) can get away with that . 
  they only could have done that at significant expense to themselves , which hints at it having large amounts of funding from somewhere . 
  while it does n't define itself as such , it really does seem like an anti-abortion lobby group to me and thus should n't be allowed to freely express its views in schools . 
  the same should go for any other lobby group , whatever the issue . 
  if schools are desperate enough that they want to bring in a lobby group to speak to the kids about abortion ( preferably not yd ) , they should at least allow the opposing camp to express their views . 
  to be honest lads , to me youth defence increasingly comes across as an irish version of the [ westboro baptist church . 
  ] ( http://www.conorfarrell.com/wordpress/social-issues/the-problems-with-youth-defence-hate-2 ), 
  agreed and i hope i did n't imply that every school used them . 
  but i think the point still stands that youth defence only could have distributed those materials at considerable expense to themselves . 
  how they get the money to do that remains a mystery . 
  make sure you make rt\u00c9 hear your outrage if you have n't already . 
  not only does this story raise serious questions about the objectivity of rt\u00c9 , but also that of the irish times and others . 
  there is nothing on this payment from rt\u00c9 to waters on the irish times website . 
  eighty thousand euro is twice the average annual salary in this country and many , many people earn less than that !, 
  surely that deserves a mention ? 
  ** edit ** [ i stand corrected . 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/rt%c3%a9-payout-damaging-in-the-extreme-1.1676795 ), 
  i completely agree with you but there is another issue there that makes the issue of compensation even more absurd . 
  if you look at the [ transcript ] ( http://www.broadsheet.ie/2014/01/16/wisdom-is-bliss/ ) rory o'neill * did n't * call breda o'brien and the iona institute homophobes or even mention the word `` homophobic '' in the same sentence as their names . 
  what he did say about them was that they were `` horrible and mean about gays '' as well as spending large amounts of time attempting to stop people from `` achieving happiness . '', 
  ask yourselves ladies and gents , how is that defamatory ? 
  how does that warrant compensation ? 
  a quick google search led me to [ this . 
  ] ( http://www.mamanpoulet.com/whos-funding-the-iona-institute/ ) no information about funding in it but some on the background of the institute if you read the articles linked there . 
  good stuff . 
  i 'd kindly ask you to keep an eye on the page as in the past criticism of the organisation has been removed from the page . 
  some comments on the talk page suggested that `` single purpose '' accounts were `` looking after '' the article . 
  the irish times has really performed badly on this issue . 
  for an organisation that likes to consider itself ireland 's `` newspaper of record '' , i think it 's disgraceful that it did n't even mention the story until way after compensation had been paid . 
  even after that the paper has mainly reported on how the debate has played out and only mentioned the compensation in passing . 
  also i ca n't figure out why they would let [ breda o'brien put forward ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/irish-times-columnist-says-rt%c3%a9-libel-payment-was-not-about-the-money-1.1677013 ) her view on the compensation unchallenged , given her relationship to the iona institute and how much controversy this has raised . 
  they could have at least interviewed somebody willing to challenge her view on the matter . 
  have you ever heard of rick santorum 's [ google problem ] ( http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2012/02/28/spreading-santorum-1-result-when-you-google-santorum-2003-2012 ) ? 
  that was launched by dan savage himself if i recall correctly . 
  m\u00e1ny thanks . 
  i agree with you but let me just add a little thing . 
  they may have received compensation from rt\u00c9 and the removal of part of the interview from the rt\u00c9 player , but they most definitely have n't silenced their quarry . 
  thanks to the streisand effect of trying to suppress the clip , many more people watched the video of rory o'neill 's comments on the saturday night show than otherwise would have . 
  also thanks to social media and well meaning politicians ( in both the oireachtas and the european parliament ) , people are more aware now of just how discriminatory the views of the iona institute et al. 
  really are .
