  basically these people have unintentionally made a previously unknown gay drag queen a rallying point for young people in ireland as well famous around the world . 
  on the other hand , this is a public relations disaster for iona institute , rt\u00c9 and the irish times , which i think will stay with them for the foreseeable future . 
  ** edit ** i may be wrong as to how unknown or well known rory o'neill was before this story emerged , but that is just my experience . 
  i do n't agree with her , but i thought people who 've been following the story would be interested . 
  she mentions that children not living with their biological parents as being one of the reasons she opposes it . 
  by that logic , couples that ca n't have children ( for any reason ) should n't be allowed to adopt , foster , have surrogate children or even get married . 
  [ apparently marriage is all about making babies , ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zark-0w5hqi ) not about love and happiness between two people . 
  what about couples not wanting to have children ? 
  i know heterosexual couples who do n't have children because of the age at which they got married and others who do n't want them . 
  do they not have the right to marriage either breda ? 
  time to give this guy a kick up the arse * via * the ballot box . 
  ** edit ** in case people do n't know who he is , [ he was one of two senators who tried to filibuster the civil partnerships bill back in 2009 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ronan_mullen#seanad_.c3.89ireann ) and suggested 77 amendments to it . 
  north-west constituency per the article . 
  according to the article , of the 9,000 us soldiers who deserted to the mexican side , only the san patricio 's were sentenced to death by hanging . 
  this was a punishment generally reserved for spies and crimes against civilians . 
  on another note , ireland has a few links to mexico . 
  one of the presidents of mexico , [ \u00c1lvaro obreg\u00f3n ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%81lvaro_obreg%c3%b3n ) , was most likely of irish descent ( obreg\u00f3n being a hispanicised version of * o'brien * ) . 
  obreg\u00f3n was notable for bringing about stability after the chaos of the mexican revolution and a number of socio-economic reforms . 
  first of all , i do n't support cuts to child benefit and i think it 's incredible that pat rabbitte came out with the statement that politicians lie during campaigns . 
  but we need to remember that the current government inherited a terrible state of accounts when it came into power . 
  just look at how fast our [ debt ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ireland/government-debt-to-gdp ) was climbing in 2011 and the size of our [ deficit . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ireland/government-budget ) ireland was also still under the bailout programme , which meant that the troika of the eu , ecb and imf could place demands on the government to cutback the deficit in return for releasing funds . 
  whatever they promised , the economic reality was n't going to allow it . 
  secondly and unbeknownst to many people , the political reality of how we control our affairs has changed . 
  ireland along with every other eurozone member state now submits its budget in advance to the european commission for approval . 
  the commission can thus ask member states to make changes in order to comply with the established rules on spending . 
  given how high ireland 's debt is , we have to have a budget surplus or at least be trying to move towards one . 
  we also have enshrined into law that our budget must either be [ `` balanced or in surplus . 
  '' ] ( http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/bills28/bills/2012/6612/document1.htm ), 
  what does that mean in practice for a country like ireland ? 
  quite frankly as long as we abide by this , it 's not very democratic . 
  despite what politicians promise during an election and , more importantly , what people actually want , every government will have to cut back to try and balance the books . 
  that will be the case regardless of who is in power . 
  the only difference apparently will be in what actually gets cut or where the new taxes will come from . 
   the area is a bit grim so i think this 'll be an improvement purely because it 's a bit original . 
  exactly . 
  if you walk down the other side of barrow street and have a look at the boland 's mill site , it 's just plain dire . 
   it has always struck me as bizarre that i have to adhere to strict guidelines in this column , which respect the right of every individual to his or her good name , but that people can comment on my articles with impunity and say anything they like about me or about others . 
  firstly breda , do n't be surprised that people * can * comment on your articles with impunity . 
  freedom of speech applies to people who both agree and disagree with your view ( s ) . 
  as somebody who dedicates a substantial amount of their time to arguing against equality for certain people , do n't expect your views to go uncriticised . 
  secondly , many forums , social media outlets and even the irish times website retains the right to remove content that does n't comply with its standards and/or is abusive . 
  so it 's hardly true that they can publish what they like about you and others . 
  i also agree with the overall sentiment but there is a large amount of hyperbole in this article . 
  it really does not matter whether the banks or the buyers are irish or not , so the whole `` treason '' accusation is unnecessary . 
  i have friends who are being threatened with repossession by irish banks presumably already adhering to the central bank 's code . 
  so it makes no difference where the banks ( and bankers ) are from . 
  if we 're going to criticise the government on this , it should at least be for failing to do more for people struggling with their mortgages , not because they sold us out to foreign bankers . 
  i will also add that the last paragraph about irish slavery from a historical perspective is completely false , despite how many times it gets repeated online and elsewhere . 
  [ here 's a good write up on the issue . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1ou972/are_there_any_sources_regarding_irish_slavery_in/ccvpv9s ), 
   this guy basically made threats against a whistle-blower, 
  are you referring to the conversation between mccabe and connolly or is there something else that i missed ? 
  this is great to see and very , very impressive . 
  football can do that as i know that supporters of afc ajax ( a dutch club ) used to sing songs in hebrew at their matches . 
  while i suspect it is n't the case , i really hope martin is being sincere about calling for an investigation into this and not simply playing party politics . 
  the whole gsoc affair and indeed the other revelations by maurice mccabe raises serious questions about how justice has been carried out in this country for almost a decade . 
  we need to be asking questions not just about shatter , but about how his predecessors handled such issues with the police , especially as it dates back for quite a while . 
  the whole notion of the post of a garda confidential recipient seems to be defunct and open to abuse . 
  were shatter 's predecessors also aware of what was going on and why did n't they do something about it either ? 
  finally , the jerry mcgrath case dates back to 2007 and the kieran boylan goes all the way back to 2008 . 
  if we 're really to be sincere about this , we need to call the ministers for justice at the time to account for what was going on in the police force at the time . 
   i have never written anything designed to hurt or harm anyone , but i feel fear that the reader will respond as the online commenters on my column do -- with personalised dislike and contempt . 
  i 'm sure the last few weeks must have been difficult with the amount of cognitive dissonance that she has had . 
  she might not have intended it ( somehow ) , but her views are deeply hurtful to many people :, 
  `` equality ( * of marriage * ) must take second place to the common good . '',

  i hope ryanair refunded you guys for that taxi ride to dublin . 
  that 's a well put insight into the problem . 
  i think most of us here are aware that if the mortgage holders were able to buy their own mortgages , only a minority would be able to take advantage of it as donnelly highlights . 
  how in the name of god is a person taking their dog for a walk newsworthy ? 
  til some unnamed [ independent and socially conservative senator ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ronan_mullen ) recently said gay people wanted children as a `` fashion accessory . '', 
  it makes me resent the guy even more . 
  agreed . 
  the `` impetuosity of youth '' has nothing to do with launching vicious assaults on complete strangers . 
  while circumstances led to him getting drunk , the guy was under no obligation to consume the amount of alcohol he ended up consuming . 
  frankly , i 'm surprised he was n't given a longer sentence . 
  i agree that they probably do n't want to lose it but there are other issues at stake here . 
  bank of ireland received billions in the bailout . 
  surely that far , far exceeds the building 's monetary value . 
  personally , i think the whole building should be given to the state . 
  this small venture on the culture and heritage centre should be the first step by the bank towards doing that , not the last . 
  i 'm probably going to get a lot of downvotes for this , but i really wish somebody other than mick wallace had brought up the issue of the mccabe/connolly transcripts . 
  [ wallace threatened one of his debtors with hiring a hitman to collect a debt !, 
  ] ( http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/mick-wallace-faces-garda-probe-over-hitman-remarks-after-exnavy-officer-files-complaint-28891329.html ) i can only imagine the extreme anxiety and anguish the person who was threatened went through after that . 
  yet he proudly stood up tall in the dail to highlight what was said about shatter going after mccabe . 
  having said that , the issue surrounding mccabe being threatened is serious enough in itself and i think shatter should resign . 
  but somebody with a clean record when it comes to threatening ( or intimidating ) people should have brought the issue up in the dail . 
   in his judgment , mr justice hardiman said the state and organs of government had cast the entire burden of promoting the use of the irish language on successive generations of school children . 
  i have to agree with that . 
  unless you go to a gaelscoil , spoken irish is pretty much confined to the classroom ( more specifically to irish class ) . 
  i think it really needs to get used by other generations if that situation is to change . 
  rory o'neill made the point a few weeks ago that people like the iona institute , john waters and other social conservatives are given a huge amount of airtime ( or newsprint ) despite representing a very small part of irish society . 
  another group is youth defence that refuses to reveal the sources of its funding , yet has sent `` educational '' tools to every school in ireland !, 
  i think part of the reason that mullen ( along with the other conservatives ) get to publish his views is that they get a large amount of funding to help them do it . 
  it might not add credence to their views , but it certainly does n't allow for open ( or rational ) debate on many issues . 
  ** edit ** i should add that it would also be interesting to see where this funding is coming from .
