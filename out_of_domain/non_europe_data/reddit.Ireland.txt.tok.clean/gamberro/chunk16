  not a summary of the academic paper , but [ here ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/scottish-decision-will-recast-irish-uk-links-1.1692227 ) is an article by the same author on the issue that appeared in the irish times . 
  hope that helps . 
  pardon my ignorance but who or what is drm ? 
   the `` big breakthrough '' for the administrators would be the introduction of student loans , because then they could raise the fees universities charged . 
  while i accept that universities should fail people who fail to meet standards , i do n't see what that has to do with third level fees . 
  i do n't know how reliable the source is , but [ here are some further details on the case . 
  ] ( http://www.rabble.ie/2014/03/04/irelands-phelps-family-and-nuig/ ) i must say i am pretty disgusted by mr. burke 's website . 
  can anybody enlighten me as to what that dye does to the environment ? 
  afraid not . 
  just to be clear , loyalism was not entirely sectarian . 
  there were/are some [ `` catholic unionists '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catholic_unionist ) in northern ireland . 
  sorry but the [ kingsmill massacre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingsmill_massacre ) was carried out by the republican side ( although not sanctioned by the pira ) . 
  i think that counts as consciously murdering civilians . 
  very interesting and thanks for sharing . 
  sorry , i did n't realise . 
  i 'll remove this in that case . 
  maybe the mirror got the story first . 
  i 'm sure the others will report on it soon enough . 
  this is just appalling . 
  [ he also advocates ireland leaving the euro . 
  ] ( http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2012/04/19/00026.asp#n159 ) from an economics perspective , that would really hurt ireland . 
  for one thing , leaving the euro would , according to the rules , entail ireland leaving the eu as well . 
  secondly , the new irish currency would rapidly depreciate , with the potential effect of causing a run on the banks . 
  the government would have to introduce controls on the movement of capital and reintroduce border controls to stop people trying to move money out . 
  thirdly , if it did cause a run on the banks , the irish state would risk having to intervene ( again ) to prop them up as funds were rapidly withdrawn . 
  ** edit ** i should also add that it 's ultimately the irish people 's choice whether or not they want to be part of the eurozone . 
  but we should at least consider the consequences of that before we make a decision on it . 
  sorry but i disagree about irish people not running on the banks . 
  simply put it would be hard for ireland to make an orderly exit from the eurozone , as there is no mechanism as yet to allow for a country to do so . 
  [ have a look at the predictions for a possible greek exit , ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-18074674 ) as these are just as applicable to ireland if it made a disorderly exit . 
  this . 
  in my opinion it 's pretty selfish to consume security provided heavily by others while not contributing to it . 
  if ireland is serious about its neutrality , it should be willing to provide for its own security . 
  other neutral countries in europe like switzerland and finland have conscription . 
  i do n't think we should go that far , but i do think we should be willing to provide for our own defence . 
  the threats to ireland 's security do n't just arise from our neighbours ( such as the uk ) , but also from terrorism , violations of our territorial waters and larger threats to europe as a whole ( such as from russia ) . 
  as a neutral country , ireland has to be able to provide for its own defence on all those counts . 
  secondly , i do n't see how ireland is being generous any more than switzerland is being selfish by providing for its own defence . 
  as a neutral country we do n't pose a threat to our neighbours , just like switzerland . 
  thirdly , ireland has foreign policy interests as well as a moral imperative , to ensure that peace and democracy are maintained around the world . 
  we can contribute to that without violating our neutrality ( through un or osce missions ) , but they do require investment in our armed forces . 
  i am aware of the fact that greece 's circumstances are very different from ours , but the possibility of a greek exit has been studied much more closely . 
  that 's why i referred to it . 
  however , [ here is a bbc article ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11830532 ) about what leaving the euro would mean for ireland . 
  pfff ... 
  he 's apologising now that his job is on the line . 
  that 's very sincere . 
  what i find so appalling about this guy is not only that he has gotten away with it all , but that he has done so all the while being a td . 
  i do n't know if it would be possible , but i would really like legislation that barred tax evaders and perhaps also people with criminal convictions from standing for office . 
  i do n't know about how the system works i 'm afraid , but in the unlikely event that they refuse your wife a [ residency visa there is a loophole . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-23029195 ) so do n't worry and good luck . 
  boa sorte !, 
  politicians may get hate mail all the time but it 's still illegal and quite frankly seriously wrong . 
  we 've seen hate mail before such as the letters in blood sent to enda during the abortion debate . 
  i think shatter should resign over his actions as minister ( and he might yet be forced to do so despite this incident ) . 
  but frankly , signalling him out for anti-semitic harassment at any point in time is pretty messed up . 
  but what about the enmity between fg/ff ? 
  both have always played punch and judy politics , despite implementing the same or very similar policies . 
  do you think that would be a factor at hand ? 
  in my opinion a ff & sinn fein coalition is also a possibility . 
  svoboda has 4 seats in 20-member government that includes ukrainians , russians , jews and armenians and is headed by a jewish ukrainian . 
  i really do n't like the fact that the far-right are there , but it 's an interim government in the rada ( parliament ) . 
  furthermore , according to the polls , svoboda are to get less than 4 percent of the vote in the upcoming presidential elections . 
  this . 
  i am not a lawyer but it is always good to document these things . 
  under the health , safety & welfare at work act [ 2005 ] you are supposed to be free from harassment and bullying . 
  there is no statutory definition of bullying but it is understood to include intimidation , victimisation , verbal abuse , exclusion , isolation and * repeated impossible deadlines * . 
  have you tried speaking to your hr manager about these deadlines and the stress ? 
  i 'm sure they would have to take that into consideration . 
  i really hope you manage to solve your situation . 
  it sounds awful . 
  best . 
  let 's not feed the nigel farage citing troll . 
  sure belgium is not a nation state , but neither is switzerland , nor spain nor the uk for that matter . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/homophobia-watchdog-needed-before-marriage-equality-referendum-1.1660868?page=1 ) a copy of the article that this eijit resigned over . 
  i hope this is the last time i read anything written by him . 
  ** edit ** as mud-swinging goes , the `` phantom tweeter '' seems particularly pathetic . 
  while some of what he said might be considered offensive by fringe catholic groups , patsy mcgarry even signed off his tweets as `` patsy '' . 
  hence , there 's nothing `` phantom '' about it , mr. 
  waters . 
  this . 
  also painting a white line on the edge of the road does not count as building a cycle lane . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xubdf9jyj7o ) a video on how the dutch got their cycle lanes . 
  you can guess that they did n't do it through simply painting the roads but by adapting them . 
  what evidence is there that inviting the royals * `` might give succour to those who believed the rising was unnecessary '' * ? 
  none according to the article . 
  on the other hand , i think this is a major symbolic act that the british head of state can also commemorate a key moment in ireland 's struggle for independence . 
  a struggle that was fought * against * the united kingdom . 
  his remarks seem partly based on the fact that his group was n't consulted on inviting the royals . 
  well , as historians they should ensure that the narrative and other activities leading up to the event are historically accurate . 
  but that by no means gives them the right to be consulted on what foreign heads of state will be there . 
  finally , as much as i admire this guy 's work , he does come across as pretty arrogant and i think a bit of that is reflected in his remarks here . 
  for example , his reviews of other people 's work are generally needlessly harsh . 
  well you could have taken steps to stop a government bailout of a bankrupt bank . 
  the united states is a secular state , but i would argue that it is not the most secular one . 
  many states ( particularly in the south ) believe they are entitled to erect copies of the ten commandments in courthouses , etc. 
  perhaps france is worthy of that title in light of its ban on religious symbols in schools ( including the islamic headscarf ) . 
  the rest of the blog post was an interesting enough read . 
  happy easter to one and all . 
  very well put .
