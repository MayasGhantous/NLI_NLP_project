  the eu is , and probably always will be , less than the sum of its parts . 
  that sets it apart from the united states where the federal government can wield a lot of power . 
  the eu has pretty lax power and a limited ability to act in a number of areas ( see the [ subsidiarity principle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subsidiarity#general_principle_of_european_union_law ) ) . 
  the power that it does have is mainly regulative , and there are a [ number of checking devices built into ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legislature_of_the_european_union#national_parliaments ) the eu legislative process . 
  neither can we really compare it to the us federal government in terms of economic muscle . 
  the eu 's budget is about one percent of the eu 's gdp , whereas in the us the federal government is about 20 percent . 
  most of the power rests with the member states themselves ( with some like germany much more powerful than others ) , with the [ european council ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_council ) and the [ council ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_the_european_union ) being the eu 's most powerful of its institutions . 
  all of that would work better if we did n't share the same currency . 
  the problem is that * we do * . 
  pretty much . 
  rupert murdoch uses his media empire to shove his neocon politics down people 's throats . 
  denis o'brien does the same only with his version of events twenty years ago . 
  this guy writes well and manages to touch popular sentiment about the whole european project . 
  however , i think a lot of his ideas and statements ca n't be taken seriously . 
  [ in this piece ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/opinion/euro-zone-fiscal-colonialism.html?_r=0 ) he argues that eurozone members should be able to spend as much as they want ( provided the market agrees to lend to them ) . 
  that seems pretty dubious as who would guarantee this spending ? 
  the ecb ? 
  other eurozone countries ? 
  not under the current framework anyway . 
  ** edit **, 
  having read the article , he makes it seem like ireland playing hardball would be a wise move . 
  i think we need to put writing off our debt back on the table . 
  but i wonder how playing hardball would work out in practice . 
  the guards should also be required to document every single time they stop and search somebody . 
  at the moment they are n't required to , unlike police in other places ( like the london met ) . 
  a large part of the british public seem to love arrogant , `` tell it like it is '' individuals who perform well on television . 
  if this is what people expect from their politicians , maybe clarkson should consider running for office in the near future . 
  i hear he might be out of a job soon anyway . 
   also , i see nothing wrong with sending luke to europe . 
  time to rattle a few bird cages . 
  this is one of the big problems with the european elections . 
  the european parliament is [ increasingly powerful , ] ( http://m.spiegel.de/international/europe/a-968365.html#spredirectedfrom=www&amp;referrrer=http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=european+parliament&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on ) but people are voting for candidates to punish the government in their own country , not based on what these candidates stand for or propose to do . 
  this does n't apply to ming necessarily but the end result of this idea is that the european parliament has a large ( and growing ) number of far-right meps . 
  vote for whoever you want , but do it based on what the candidate stands for . 
  people seem to like ming on this subreddit , which is fine . 
  but i really do n't think he 's the right man to send to brussels . 
  my reasoning is simple , he does n't seem to know enough about the eu and so would do better continuing his work as a td . 
  example one : he advocates ireland leaving the euro . 
  that would have big [ negative consequences for our economy . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11830532 ) the euro is a broken system but the solution for ireland is to work to fix it , not to abandon it . 
  example two : he seems very uninformed about european policies and how they affect ireland . 
  just look at the myths [ he repeated about the common fisheries policy . 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/luke-ming-flanagan-to-stand-in-european-election-1.1733439 ) those are [ complete myths ] ( http://peoplekorps.blogspot.ie/2009/09/irish-fishing-and-eu.html?m=1 ) and should be confined to boards.ie , not repeated by elected representatives . 
  ** edit ** i should also mention that tds have much more power than meps , particularly with regards private member 's bills , so that is where ming should say in my opinion . 
  i wish the commentary on this had been more along the lines you mentioned . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/24vjde/people_from_ethnic_minority_backgrounds_will_make/chbq2t2 ) is a pretty disgraceful example of the commentary here . 
  racist and xenophobic on many levels . 
  that you greg ? 
   account registered 6 hours ago . 
  were n't you the chap behind the greg account ? 
  you certainly reposted his long ( and very offensive ) rants a few times . 
  just out of curiosity , was your macro-economic lecturer morgan kelly ? 
  the guy seems to worship draghi . 
  i have mixed feelings about his impact so far . 
  cheers for the reply . 
  kelly made the argument that draghi was the man who had saved the euro , which i find highly dubious . 
  draghi brought about a policy change but none of what he has done is enshrined in any treaty and it is unlikely to be for the foreseeable future . 
  even worse , draghi 's policies remain [ highly controversial ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/financial-services/german-court-rules-eu-bond-buying-scheme-incompatible-with-law-1.1684065 ) and are currently being challenged through the courts . 
  you can also see a breakdown of ukip 's voting record on climate change [ here ] ( http://score-ep.org/ ) ( along with most other british meps ) . 
  well a large number of british working class families travel to other eu countries on holidays ( as is their right ) . 
  given budget and discount holidays to spain and elsewhere , travelling around europe is ** meaningful ** to an increasing number of people in the uk . 
  well i think an apology would be in order in that case . 
  i mean they are entitled to travel to other countries if they so choose . 
  sorry , i was working on that . 
  here 's some info about the [ matriarch of the youth defence crowd . 
  ] ( http://comeheretome.com/2012/07/29/una-bean-mhic-mhathuna-40-years-of-reactionary-politics/ ), 
  my favourite was her calling the yes side in the divorce referendum `` wife swappin ' sodomites . '', 
  ca n't i 'm afraid . 
  i saw the article in the paper on the bus this morning ( hence the photos on imgur ) . 
  maybe somebody else here can help you out . 
  while not a affiliated with them , breda o'brien wants surrogacy banned as she considers it `` a form of slavery . '', 
  the mind boggles . 
  sorry but what 's cora of plc ? 
  that 's exactly the argument that was made in [ this piece ] ( http://feministire.wordpress.com/2012/03/03/on-surrogacy-slavery-and-choices-my-response-to-breda-obrien/ ) , which pretty much destroyed breda o'brien 's article . 
  i know from having spoken to people in his brussels office that he 's planning on running in the next general election . 
  that makes me less inclined to vote for him . 
  even if you agree with a candidate 's principles , i do n't see the point in voting for them if it 's just going to further their political career . 
  yes , a lot of his posters are about attacking his opponents more than anything . 
  it 's too late to change them now , but i think more information on what he proposes to do would have been better . 
  i 've no idea on what funding you 'll get from the government here and what 's available to you probably varies on the country along with the university . 
  i did a quick google search and [ here 's some information ] ( http://www.kuleuven.be/international/scholarships.html ) on funding for the university of leuven , which has some courses in english along with being really high up in the rankings . 
  [ here 's some information about fees . 
  ] ( http://www.kuleuven.be/studentenadministratie/inschrijvingen/en/fees/fees.html#bac ) i 'd encourage anybody thinking about doing this to do the same . 
  hey , [ sligo is a beautiful spot . 
  after having glanced at his account , / u/paludosa2 seems like a strong ukip supporter so i think he objects to the principle of free movement of labour from these countries , rather than how many actually come . 
  that said the fact that a site like migration watch that is n't going to quote any peer reviewed study is pretty damning . 
  most peer reviewed studies show that immigrants from the accession 8 countries are net contributors to the uk 's public finances . 
  while prepared by a lobby group , [ this article ] ( http://www.cer.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/pb_imm_uk_27sept13.pdf ) summarises the peer reviewed studies pretty well . 
  exactly . 
  eastern european immigrants have a lower number of dependants with them in the uk , so the numbers of them employed should give a pretty good indication as to population . 
  they are in the uk to work as you said , contributing to public finances in the process , plain and simple . 
  [ relevant . 
  ] ( http://britishinfluence.org/13-reasons-taking-daily-mail-press-complaints-commission/ ), 
  very well said . 
  as it happens , i have a bit of a foreign accent and get confronted with this kind of stuff on occasion . 
  people in the past have been very rude and told me to go back to wherever they think i 'm from . 
  so i can sympathise with this lady . 
  enda , as an elected representative but especially as taoiseach , i expected better from you . 
  that was n't meant as an attack on his/her character and i apologise if it was taken that way . 
  i 'm not a fan of him , but farage should n't take this personally .
