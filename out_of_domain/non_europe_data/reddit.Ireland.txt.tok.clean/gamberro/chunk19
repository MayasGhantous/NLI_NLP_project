  murdoch has dropped every other leader and party once they were no longer useful to him . 
  on another note , murdoch seems to have been unaware about the implications of the ukip phenomenon . 
  if a left wing candidate rallied against big business as farage has done , murdoch 's newspapers would n't have it . 
  in particular , murdoch seems oblivious to the fact that the big business label apples to him and people like him too . 
  especially when many articles are stuck behind paywalls . 
  i 'd see it as no different that sharing a link to the actual article . 
  his photo on their site is n't very flattering anyway . 
  these are the chaps that are standing in the upcoming election . 
  i think it 's important that people know where they stand . 
  this was aimed at the subreddit in general and not against you . 
  i apologise if i caused any offence with what i said . 
  in any case , you are completely entitled to disagree with what i wrote . 
  best . 
  in case anybody is wondering what meps and the european parliament actually do , [ here 's a short video explaining it . 
  ] ( http://video.ft.com/3505813740001/why-the-european-parliament-matters/world ) it may help clarify just how ridiculous these election posters are . 
  more than a few bad eggs anyway . 
  i was wondering where all the policies listed on their website had gone . 
  she does n't seem to know what she 's talking about . 
  draghi has cut interest rates to near zero since he got in , which refutes her first argument . 
  secondly the ecb has started limited quantitive easing , but much , much more will be required . 
  finally , have a look at what leaving the euro ( and the eu ) [ might entail . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11830532 ) any abandoning of the euro would be pretty disorderly and really hurt our economy . 
  i would n't say we 're out of it yet , despite what the government says . 
  our levels of debt are still extremely high and rising , just at a lower rate than before . 
  unfortunately for ireland , many of the other struggling countries are in an even worse state than us but those could spread our way . 
  if spain or greece abandoned the euro , the fear is that contagion would spread and ireland ( with its high levels of debt ) would be forced to do the same . 
  with unemployment and debt levels extremely high in those countries , that remains a possibility . 
  my mistake . 
  sorry about that . 
  he 's just right this time round . 
  most of the time , he 's an asshole arguing against gay marriage and saying on the radio that gays [ want to have children as a `` fashion accessory . 
  '' ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/video?vid=1.1697135 ), 
  with pretty dubious statistics as others here have pointed out . 
  the guy comes across as a complete psychopath from that article . 
  poor woman though . 
  i went to an irish pub in ulan bator about ten years ago !, 
  great place although the only thing that was irish was the decor . 
  the manager running the place was german . 
  personally , i 'd rather no cut backs to hospitals and the health care system . 
  but i 'd seriously rather they cut back in the earnings of consultants before they cut back front line services . 
  i should add that i have a personal gripe against how much consultants earn in the health service . 
  last year i had a big problem with my ankle that required surgery . 
  the consultant charged me almost 200 euro for the first appointment which lasted barely 15 minutes !, 
  what 's worse is that after the surgery i had a follow up appointment which was even shorter and guess what ... 
  he charged the same amount for that too . 
  it seems like our very own gregory barnes has decided to run for office . 
  thanks , i was n't aware of this . 
  a lot of my friends are newly qualified teachers and the same thing has happened to them . 
  basically , they enter on a very different pay package to their senior colleagues . 
  ** edit : ** would n't those consultants have professional insurance to cover them in the face of the risk you mentioned ? 
  in the dail , members can put forward private members bills , as ming did . 
  whether they are passed or not , they can still become subject of debate both in the dail and in the media . 
  in the european parliament , meps do n't have the right to start legislation of their own . 
  they can only amend or reject legislation that is put in front of them . 
  from that perspective , ming will have a lot less influence than members of the dail . 
  [ here 's a link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/2546up/labour_go_on_offensive_against_luke_ming_flanagan/chdkoyc?context=3 ) to a comment i wrote about ming and why i felt he was n't the right man to send to europe . 
  honestly , i think the situation will eventually force a write down on our debt to more sustainable levels or a break-up of the euro . 
  the irish people , along with the spaniards , portuguese , italians and greeks will not put up with another ten years of this . 
   mr robinson , insisted in an interview with the irish news , the pastor did not have `` an ounce of hatred '' in his body . 
  the little amount of respect that i had for mr. robinson just decreased even further . 
  i also found it disturbing how that crap was applauded by a big portion if the audience . 
  i think people are wondering why farage ( ukip party leader and star striker ) appeared on question time so often , rather than the 11 other meps the party had at the time . 
  as others on this thread have pointed out , there are approximately 30,000 illegal immigrants in ireland . 
  that might not sound like much but proportionally , given the size of ireland , it is . 
  if that 's the logic we 're following why are we campaigning for an amnesty for irish illegal immigrants in the us ? 
  they also `` gave two fingers '' to us law , did n't they ? 
  wo n't more be inclined to do the same ? 
  ** edit ** can people try to give arguments instead of simply downvoting ? 
  brave lads serving there . 
  twenty-six of the irish soldiers who went to the congo on the peacekeeping mission did n't come back . 
  i met a guy who was with them . 
  i should also say that france and especially belgium were behind the crisis in katanga in the first place . 
  the mercenaries that the irish would end up confronting were all hired from belgium and the kantangan units were led by belgian officers . 
  in many cases they are contributing into the system ( whether by vat or some other indirect tax ) despite having few or none of the benefits . 
  very well put whoever wrote that . 
  i 'd like to add that this is precisely why the iona institute 's stance ( and people like them ) about having religion in society really irritates me . 
  that was the reality in ireland for decades and we saw what the result was . 
  it was a society where women were incarcerated by their families for having sex out of marriage , where information about contraception ( along with contraception itself ) was suppressed , where divorce was illegal and where horrific abuse carried out by religious orders was swept under the rug . 
  the sad part is that i did n't even touch all of the things that went on as the list is very long . 
  you 'd have to have a very strange moral compass to argue that ireland should go back to that kind of society ( like iona institute and breda o'brien do ) . 
  people are entitled to feel nostalgic for the ireland of yesteryear in some ways , including the fact that it was less consumerist and had stronger community links . 
  i 'd add that those things are still possible nowadays if people choose to follow them . 
  but i do n't think you can morally justify nostalgia for the role religion played in society at that time . 
  the parliament also sign off on who gets to be commission president ( almost every block nominated a candidate this time round but nobody seems to care ) . 
  the parliament ca n't initiate but it can still amend or block legislation like any other parliament . 
  there are also procedures for the parliament to lobby the commission to introduce legislation . 
  finally the parliament wields indirect power , such as through its committees where it calls people to account in much the same way as the pac does in the dail . 
  mario draghi frequently appears before one of these . 
  you 're posting this in the wrong subreddit . 
  there is a strong number of ukip supporters on this sub , many of whom feel they 're excluded from / r/unitedkingdom . 
  like many subreddits , people use the upvote/downvote here to promote views they agree with and suppress views they do n't like . 
  the cia was involved in overthrowing lumumba and putting in mobutu sese seko . 
  i 'm not sure what role the us had in lumumba 's assassination though . 
  it was the katangan units controlled by belgian officers who shot him . 
  the same belgian officers would later use acid to destroy what was left of lumumba 's body . 
  mobutu by the way was probably the worst thing to happen to the congo after leopold ii . 
  he completely pillaged the country for thirty-two years , all with the support of the us , france and other western countries . 
  exactly !, 
  they suffer from huge discrimination in their countries of origin , which obviously is terrible . 
  worse many members of their community get pushed into a life of crime and are extremely vulnerable to being victims of crime over here .
