  there was [ a horrific case of a roma girl being murdered in dublin ] ( http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/young-and-vulnerable-her-last-days-spent-in-fear-26815942.html ) a few years ago . 
  now that said , i do n't understand why many of them are here begging . 
  i 'd like to hear more from their community before i draw conclusions about them . 
  really , i 'd like them to integrate and participate in the communities where they live , just like everybody else . 
  as others mention below , the [ environmental ones are pretty spot on . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukip#energy.2c_environment_and_climate_change ), 
  as for thatcherism , well the general definition of it is that of `` free markets , reined in government spending and british nationalism . '', 
  lo and behold farage is a strong admirer of thatcher and of free markets , which is reflected in ukip 's policies . 
  ukip wants to reduce corporation tax , abolish inheritance tax and carry out # 77 billion of cuts to the public sector to reduce the deficit . 
  sounds a lot like thatcherism . 
  sorry , i 've seen a lot of references to it but what is / pol / exactly ? 
  this is one of the problems i had with the fine gael defectors who `` voted on their conscience '' when the abortion legislation was being tabled . 
  they did n't have such moral issues when child benefits , disability allowances and other services were being cut consecutively ( which the same people voted for ) . 
  it seems to me that they only have moral dilemmas on issues before you are born . 
  after you are born , the do n't seem to give a damn about you . 
  the original facebook page appears to have been taken down . 
  rightly so in my opinion . 
  there 's even a [ name ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/big_tent_party ) for it in political science . 
  many thanks for that . 
  yes , i am willing to help anybody . 
  helping animals was just an idea . 
  i apologise about the source but after a quick google search i could n't find a better one . 
  besides , i think after you read the article , you realise that this is a big deal . 
  `` do you just believe what people have told you ? '', 
  - the man urging people to reject scientific evidence and believe exclusively in the bible . 
  a populist party like fianna fail falls flat when it has to identify itself ideologically as it does when it enters the european parliament . 
  ff would probably like to be in the epp in the european parliament ( the same group that fg sits in ) . 
  but perhaps due to the fact that that would mean sitting alongside fg , their current situation is more of a matter of convenience . 
  alde ( fianna fail 's official grouping ) is a grouping of `` liberals and democrats '' that includes [ the british liberal dems and a lot of scandinavian liberals . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alliance_of_liberals_and_democrats_for_europe_group#membership_by_country_at_april_2010 ) that 's hardly somewhere where they would fit in . 
  lo and behold [ they have n't voted with their group on key issues including press freedom and gay rights . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fianna_f%c3%a1il#in_european_institutions ), 
  it 's not a story . 
  i do n't really like ming but even i have to admit that . 
  he have away half his wages when he was a td and wo n't do so as an mep . 
  that 's all . 
  how are they affected by the smoking ban if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  just to get the ball rolling . 
  * angela 's ashes * by frank mccourt . 
  simply because it shows the reality of poverty and speech of the early 20th century very well . 
  you 're entitled to your opinion , but i did n't think it was . 
  i wonder if breda o'brien , john waters and the iona institute will touch the gay marriage issue again . 
  they are lunatics that seem to have plenty of access to the airwaves . 
  i fully intend to send both of them a rainbow flag the next time they mention anything related to homosexuality . 
  i am going to enclose a note saying the following : `` in light of the fact that you are a non-homophobe and hold no prejudice towards the gay community , i trust you will have absolutely no problem in accepting this symbol of the former . 
  yours , etc. '', 
  [ this ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/lump_of_labour_fallacy ) is pretty relevant . 
  whenever immigration comes up with bigots like the one who wrote that , they always come out with stuff like `` they 're taking out jobs . '', 
  that line of thinking is completely wrong , despite how many times it gets repeated . 
  if he had paid for flights with his own salary as a td it would n't be an issue ( in theory ) as that was his money . 
  but the fact is that this was funded by the taxpayer . 
   article 50 teu lisbon treay formalises under international law th vienna convention of seceding and guaranteeing future trade et al. 
  no , it does no such thing . 
  [ have a look at the text ] ( http://euwiki.org/teu#article_50 ) itself if you 'd like . 
  there is nothing about guaranteeing future trade , whether it be free or not . 
  is israel really a democracy when it rules over millions of palestinians who do n't have a right to vote in israeli elections ? 
  while israeli settlers living in the west bank may vote and shape the government that rules over them , the palestinians ca n't . 
  is n't israel a bit of an international pariah in how it has attempted to redraw its borders as it sees fit , including annexing territories from the west bank into israel proper and parts of other countries ( see the golan heights ) . 
  i do n't know why they singled out sinn fein and personally i wish the irish times/the author of this piece adopted such a hostile attitude to the other major parties in the country . 
  does the party have a stance on fluoridation of water ? 
  either way they would n't be the first to jump on that bandwagon , although they might be the first party to do so . 
  please note that emmanuel todd is a pretty strong french nationalist and ( while not affiliated with them ) [ many of his ideas have been adopted by the front national . 
  ] ( http://www.craigwilly.info/2013/04/30/the-front-national-a-rough-guide/ ) as such , his view on the euro project should be seen through this lens . 
  the problem extends beyond education , but i agree with you that education is the motor for change . 
  thank you for using the word `` fascist . '', 
  the front national have been attempting a neat orwellian trick to suppress that label . 
  they even object to the label `` far right '' , which according to marine le pen is an insult when applied to her party . 
  this is despite her party 's policies that are typical of the far-right ( such as bringing back the death penalty ) and the fact that le pen also has strong links with other far-right parties in europe . 
  i did n't attack the person , merely stated his ideological position . 
  there are twitter accounts that publish edits carried out from the us congress ips along with westminster . 
  maybe it 's time we got one for dail edits ? 
  simply announce them on twitter when they are detected ( along with the evidence ) . 
  the streisand effect would do the rest . 
  troll much ? 
  you referred to people 's native language as `` rubbish '' and called for their culture to disappear . 
  that makes you more than a troll in my book . 
  the [ indo ran a story ] ( http://m.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/young-and-vulnerable-her-last-days-spent-in-fear-26815942.html ) on this case a while back , but i must warn you it 's a disturbing read . 
  i agree . 
  but i am also angry about the silence towards what has been happening in ukraine from groups that are otherwise anti-war , opposed to violations of international law and human rights . 
  i ca n't help but feel that if those responsible had been funded by a european country or the united states , the reaction would have been very different and angrier . 
  somehow people are unwilling to apply the same standards they apply to the us to what is actually happening in ukraine , where russia is actively arming separatist groups after illegally annexing crimea . 
  the fact that ireland is geographically far removed from ukraine does not stick either . 
  ireland is far removed from palestine and yet you will find protests taking place against what 's happening there . 
  irish people would probably equally object to israel 's illegal annexation of parts if other countries ( like the golan heights ) . 
  i will also add that russia 's historical record in the ukraine has not been a positive one . 
  the region was subject to forces russification under the russian empire and when separatists tried to break away , resistance was crushed . 
  ukraine also suffered greatly under the soviet period when forced collectivisation led to a fine in the predominantly ukrainian speaking part of the country that cost the lives of over a million people . 
  the purges and forced deportations of certain peoples in the ukraine ( like the crimean tatars ) adds to this terrible record . 
  russia under putin is a state that desperately wants to be considered a superpower and `` counterweight '' to the united states . 
  putin would probably like the kind of influence the soviet union had whose collapse he regards as a great tragedy . 
  in that case we need to apply the same level if criticism when it violates international law we do to a superpower like the us or indeed any other country . 
  anything less is pretty serious hypocrisy . 
  i did n't mean to bash people protesting israel 's actions and i 'm sorry if it came across that way . 
  i would just like people to show the same level of interest/anger to events elsewhere in the world . 
  you can definitely see a lot of poverty and social problems when you walk around there . 
  there are a lot of homeless people , others with addictions , people begging and others consuming alcohol on the street . 
  basically in a relatively small area you can see a lot of people who have fallen through the cracks of society . 
  i find it sad every time i walk by there . 
  i do n't know if we are integral but we are part of a confederation/federation now with a common policy and a common foreign policy . 
  what this means for our neutrality is n't very clear as neutrality is not enshrined in our constitution or law , but is instead a '' `` traditional policy of military neutrality . '',
