  ** edit ** oh wow , i just came on here to see that i got gold from somebody . 
  thank you whoever you are !, 
  some tourist who was rediscovering their irish heritage ? 
  economically thatcher 's attitudes live on and the conservatives are shifting further to the right with the rise of ukip . 
  incidentally the ukip crowd ( along with a lot of the conservatives ) worship thatcher , as an advocate of limited government , reigned in government spending and british nationalism . 
  the irony for british nationalists/little englanders are oblivious to the fact that the uk is not a nation state , but a `` union '' of different nations . 
  a large part of irish history involves trying to get out of that union . 
  many brits are also happy to complain about immigrants not assimilating , while not making an effort to assimilate while they move overseas to places like spain . 
   either way , i feel that what they wanted does n't really matter - we should strive to create the best society and world possible , no matter how those who went before us felt . 
  perhaps their actions can inspire us to a degree , but we should never follow blindly . 
  i completely agree . 
  i think people get too caught up on what `` the founding fathers wanted '' ( something that resurfaces in political debate in the us a lot but also here with the leaders of the 1916 rising ) . 
  if sovereignty ultimately rests with the people , what they want should matter . 
  what the `` founding fathers '' wanted should inspire us to a degree ( as you said ) but no more . 
  this is a famous one from the rising of [ shortly after de valera surrendered .

  good luck with it and feel free to share your results . 
  yes , it is . 
  i 'm not doubting that . 
  my issue is with british nationalism , or the idea that uk is a nation state , which it is not . 
  did n't roger helmer ( the prominent ukip mep ) say that `` we have no choice but to support ttip '' ? 
   `` with the fastest-growing economy in europe , mr barroso should perhaps look to the uk for advice and inspiration rather than lecturing us from a sedentary position . '', 
  i do n't know what he is basing that on but romania actually has a higher gdp growth rate than the uk and i doubt henry smith or many conservatives will look to it for advice . 
  then how does the party oppose ttip ? 
   `` there also may have been an attitude among certain nationalists that ` my enemy 's enemy is my friend . '', 
  that was true [ during the war anyway . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_republican_army_%e2%80%93_abwehr_collaboration_in_world_war_ii ) if it genuinely continued after the war , then i am amazed . 
  how much of it is done at present ? 
  i live in dublin and i love the idea of cycling out to mullingar . 
  not just kinsale but they should convert [ all the old track into a greenway .

  the genocide claim has been discussed on / r/askhistorians [ here , ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1sko51/would_you_classify_the_irish_potato_famine_a/ ) [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1cxvbd/did_the_british_do_anything_to_help_the_irish/ ) and [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1tpf3j/was_there_genocide_in_ireland/ ) the appropriateness of the term `` genocide '' is not as clear cut as others may make it seem . 
  ** edit ** i appear to have gone and upset people with what i shared . 
  sorry about that . 
  i completely agree and i apologise if what i shared derailed the discussion here a little bit . 
  if i recall from my finance classes , if you diversify your investment , you can reduce risk ( particularly with a stock market portfolio ) . 
  heavy levels of gearing ( which hobbs is advocating ) also entail great levels of risk . 
  the fact was though that people had very little experience of investing and were being told to invest in one type of asset , with savings or borrowed money . 
  they were basically being led to believe that it was wise to put all their eggs in one basket and with borrowed money . 
  what do ff have to do wrong for people to stop voting for them ? 
  sorry , i appear to have set the discussion off on a tangent . 
  my apologies . 
  in my experience using your middle name is much more common in the us than over here . 
  i guess he wants to set himself apart from all the other ira blocks out there !, 
  quant \u00e0 mon travail , i am working in finance but i hope to change to something more interesting someday . 
  do you mind telling me why israel is allowed to import and export as it pleases ( including importing and manufacturing weapons ) while palestine is n't ? 
  i do n't see any reason as to why palestine should n't have as much sovereignty as israel in that regard . 
  with regards importing weapons , israel is the one that has illegally annexed parts of other countries ( golan heights ) , annexing east jerusalem ( in defiance of the icj ) and carrying on an occupation of the west bank . 
  all of this is maintained by force and most likely will continue so long as israel 's military is capable of maintaining it . 
   this is also the reason that i foresee sf being far more likely to go into government with a mixture of a rump labour party , greens and a few independents . 
  it all depends on whether labour , or what 's left of it , abandons fg after the next election ( as i sincerely hope it does ) . 
  at the moment any left wing support for labour is completely wasted as it ends up propping up fg , which in turn takes pretty regressive measures against the worse off . 
  however , there should be enough left-wing tds after the next election to make such a government possible . 
  the golan heights were taken during the six day war of 1967 , not the yom kippur war of 1973 . 
  israel seized the golan in a strike ( that it regarded as pre-emptive ) and it was not invaded . 
  the united nations security council has ruled that israel 's annexation is `` null and void and without international legal effect . '', 
  the international community ( including the united states ) regards the golan as syrian territory that is occupied by israel . 
  from israel 's point of view , it does n't currently occupy the golan because it has annexed it . 
  israel has also built settlements on it in violation of the fourth geneva convention . 
  clearly israel is interested in keeping them . 
  as for water , i am sure there would be an agreement about water ( as there was in the peace treaty with jordan ) when they are returned to syria . 
  it seems like the asshole ( along with his circle perhaps ) pocketed the most of it . 
   the moriarty tribunal found that of the # 270,000 collected in donations for brian lenihan , no more than # 70,000 ended up being spent on lenihan 's medical care . 
  the tribunal identified one specific donation of # 20,000 for lenihan that was surreptitiously appropriated by haughey , who took steps to conceal this transaction . 
  i was there three years ago and many parts ( including mexico city ) are pretty safe in comparison to parts of the us . 
  to be honest i actually felt more concerned for my wellbeing in downtown areas of us cities than in mexico . 
  i did n't go to any tourist resorts ( like canc\u00fan ) while i was there but most mexicans told me that the government had beefed up security in many of the towns more frequently visited by tourists . 
  i did see a lot of police presence in those places but i also did n't feel afraid to travel by bus or taxi there . 
  talk to mexicans before you go about whether it is safe or not and what kind of precautions you should take ( or ask a question on / r/mexico which is what i did ) . 
  in my opinion the indo has pretty much become an irish version of it sadly . 
  he needs a beard and/or a staff . 
  this is a bizarre language difference with americans . 
  for us to be irish means to be from ireland . 
  for them it means to be of irish origin/descent , the same way an xth generation italian-american might say `` i 'm italian . '', 
  that 's the reasoning behind it but it irks me regardless . 
  using the threat of legal action is basically the islamic culture centre 's way of saying , `` we will silence you using any means necessary . '', 
  are they completely oblivious to the fact that the murders yesterday were ( in the murderers ' sick minds ) an attempt to punish people for freedom of speech , i.e. 
  the exact same thing they are trying to with legal action . 
  that was a genuine ( and stupid ) mistake on my part . 
  a friend shared the article on facebook along with a comment about free speech . 
  i read the article and stupidly did not check the date . 
  i thus thought it was a new story and decided to share it here . 
  i hope that clarifies things . 
  i regret using the term `` by any means necessary '' and i apologise if i caused offence . 
  to be fair i did n't lump him with the murderers . 
  i did more of less say that he ultimately share a common objective with them in that he wants to stop people satirising muhammad ; i.e. 
  limiting free speech . 
  there is of course a world of difference between the murders and threatening legal action . 
  however , the objective of threatening legal action is to silence those who would like to exercise their freedom of speech and otherwise publish the cartoons . 
  i 'm sure this is the worst nightmare for the ~ ~ conservative ~ ~ homophobic elements within the church who are opposed to marriage equality . 
  for a politician who is supposedly `` anti-establishment '' he certainly gets a lot of airtime , employs lot of empty rhetoric and lies like the rest of them . 
  but do n't take any heed of it , it 's all just a big conspiracy by the eu , open-door immigration , the elites and of course romanians/bulgarians . 
  is n't his nephew still on the run after being found in contempt of court along with other things ? 
  true but people generally do n't consider that a sport , part of their culture or some form of pest control . 
   all in all , i think there are bigger things to worry about than fox hunting . 
  i agree but the fact is that dog fighting , badger baiting and other blood sports are already banned . 
  why are we making an exception with fox hunting ?
