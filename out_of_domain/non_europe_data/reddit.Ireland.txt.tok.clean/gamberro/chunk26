  i understand that in the meat industry they try to give the animal a quick death . 
  that ca n't be said about fox hunting where the animal is pursued and is mauled to death by dogs if caught . 
  i agree with others here who say that culling would be more effective at keeping fox numbers down . 
  the economic argument was used in the uk in the run up to it being banned . 
  according to the wikipedia article it was n't true :, 
   since the ban in the uk , there has been no evidence of significant job losses , and hunts have continued to operate along limited lines , either trail hunting , or claiming to use exemptions in the legislation . 
  just to give you a size of palestine today , the palestinian territories ( gaza + west bank ) are about the size of county galway . 
  of course but they also have the right * to * publish them , without being threatened with legal action or worse . 
  yes , except in fox hunting humans get dogs to do that for their entertainment . 
  i do n't see the difference between dog fighting and other blood sports in that case . 
  i think he 's saying they do n't do a good job representing their constituents ( at least with regards their record in the office they were elected to ) both in the european parliament and westminster . 
  they did n't run as abstentionist candidates either . 
  they are n't even trying to block or amend eu laws to favour the uk . 
  but leaving that aside , i think the record of ukip 's mps is worse . 
  i see what you mean but i think israel has used the accusation of anti-semitism so often against its critics that the meaning of it has been undermined . 
  there is a clear distinction between anti-semitism and anti-zionism . 
  however , that does n't excludepeople from being both . 
  what ? 
  this is farage we 're talking about . 
  a man who bangs on about cheap labour while simultaneously calling for [ free trade on a global level ] ( https://m.facebook.com/133737666673845/posts/534085943305680 ) . 
  you see in ukip 's strange world `` cheap labour from eu = bad '' but `` cheap labour from free trade agreement = good . '', 
  if farage is sincere about free trade then it shows he does n't really care about cheap labour except as an electoral tool . 
  that kind of free trade hurts manufacturing employment in industrialised countries a lot . 
  there 's been a significantdecline in manufacturing employment both in europe and the u.s. as firms that ca n't compete with cheap labour from china and elsewhere outsource . 
  [ we 've seen this in europe ] ( http://www.bruegel.org/download/parent/795-manufacturing-europes-future/file/1683-manufacturing-europes-future/%20decline%20in%20manufacturing%20europe%20breugel ) and in the [ us in recent years . 
  ] ( http://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/decline-us-manufacturing-jobs-tied-shift-china-trade-policy ), 
  fair play to the lad and i wish him the best . 
  but it 's programmes like this that show that the discovery channel is no longer about education at all . 
  [ you 're on to something there . 
  out of curiosity , is your username related to your voting preference ? 
  the number killed was still high relative to northern ireland 's population . 
  if i recall correctly if the same proportion of people were killed and injured and injured in the uk as im the troubles the number would be over 100,000 . 
  anyway , we 've heard both the ira and the us same excuse that they `` do n't target civilians . '', 
  what 's to stop them taking votes from fianna f\u00e1il ? 
  sure they 're all centre-right parties anyway . 
  cheers for that . 
  that is a great sub all round . 
  thanks for that . 
  that would make a great film ir tv series . 
   unfurling a `` hello divorce . . . 
  bye bye daddy '' poster , he `` bounces it off '' ( a new term then ) the no divorce campaign 's vice-chairman , ** gerard casey . 
  was that the same gerard casey of ucd ? 
  i guess he 's still pretty far on the right politically given that he 's an anarcho-capitalist/libertarian and into the austrian school of economics . 
  the guy third from the left is [ liam carroll . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liam_carroll ) i do n't know who the others are . 
  i hope you returned it to the fiction after you took this photo . 
  just a clarification , ukip is a pretty separate affair and i would n't add it to your list ( since the uk has its own currency ) . 
  however , support for it may increase if the eurozone fails to recover . 
  secondly , deflation is a real risk as you point out , but one that is already happening in countries like portugal and greece . 
  something must be done now before it 's too late . 
  this . 
  he was n't just any head of state , saudi arabia is an absolute monarchy ffs . 
  personally i think the amount of publicity the media give them is far more ridiculous . 
  agreed . 
  i 'd also like to add that the roma/romani people have a messed up history of persecution in eastern europe . 
  in the 13th century all roma living in what is now romania were enslaved , with this only being reversed in the mid 19th century . 
  since then discrimination and marginalisation against them has continued . 
  there are a lot of social problems as a result . 
  ideally i 'd like him to stand trial for the things he 's done . 
  but do you think he will at least be voted out of office at the next election ? 
  my advice would be to explain to them that the roma/romani is the correct term for * gypsies * and that they 're are a community spread all over europe . 
  for example , they 've [ lived in england for centuries . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanichal ), 
  given that ukip have made such a big deal about the eu and free movement of labour and the eu , it 'd be ironic to see them join the efta and be forced to accept it . 
  [ all the efta member states accept free movement of labour subject to the conditions set out in eu law . 
  ] ( http://www.efta.int/eea/policy-areas/persons/persons ) so romanians and bulgarians would still be able to move to britain . 
  what ? 
  if the uk introduces quotas or a `` points based system '' for eu migrants as ukip et al propose , eu member states will respond in kind . 
  there 'll be great pressure on ireland to follow suit , with negative consequences on our travel , trade and relations with the uk . 
  the common travel area is not enshrined in any legislation and was n't recognised legally until the treaty of amsterdam . 
  what 's to say that it would continue to exist if the uk left the eu ? 
  it is not at all clear if switzerland will be able to do that . 
  time will tell . 
  i think the problem arises in that the uk is a union dominated by a populous and wealthy england . 
  regardless of how scotland , n. ireland and wales vote , england ( with 84 percent of the population ) will ultimately decide whether the uk stays in or leaves in an in/out referendum . 
  nationalist parties ( such as the snp ) , whose ultimate aim is for sovereignty to be transferred to its own respective government , are naturally infuriated by this . 
  no offence to mcguinness but is the growing support for sinn f\u00e9in south of the border related to its nationalist politics or economic ones ? 
  i , for one , am tempted to vote for them based on the latter but not on the former . 
  also if a referendum on a united ireland were held , as provided for in the good friday agreement , [ would it pass in northern ireland ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_ireland#in_northern_ireland ), 
  that and slashing foreign aid . 
  given that [ they seriously overstate how much the uk pays into the eu ] ( https://fullfact.org/economy/cost_eu_membership_gross_net_contribution-30887 ) ( farage loves his soundbite `` it 's costing us # 55 million a day '' ) , i have my doubts as to how they propose to fund these policies . 
  i understand what you 're saying but i do n't see how that relates to the point that england will broadly decide the outcome of any uk referendum . 
  the spanish one is incorrect too . 
  it should be `` paciencia '' not `` pacienza . '', 
  i 'm glad if leaks are being identified and repaired anyway . 
  but what happens when billing per usage comes in ? 
  what evidence is there that what the troika have demanded so far has improved the economic situation in greece ? 
  is greece more able or less able to finance itself through taxation ? 
  after three bailouts despite the troika programme , i think not . 
  edit : i could go on pointing to the current account , unemployment , debt to gdp ratio and poverty levels . 
  most of these have gotten much worse because of the bailouts and policies of the troika ( with the exception of exports that have been hit by russian samctions ) . 
  i agree but too many people in power think the opposite . 
  there 's a reason for this on the part of the troika . 
  german politicians on the right are strong believers in neo-liberal economics ( to be more specific it 's called ordoliberalism ) . 
  they are either opposed to or do n't believe in keynesian ideas of government encouraging demand when it falls . 
  rather they believe whenever there is a fall in demand , the economy naturally adjusts ( and if it does n't it 's because of supply side problems ) . 
  this was/is possible because of germany being a huge export economy , with demand elsewhere making up for falls at home . 
  however , i do n't see that as a strategy for dealing with countries whose economies are very different to germany 's . 
  it also clear that failing to allow for any kind of stimulus has made the crisis even worse by increasing the fall in demand .
