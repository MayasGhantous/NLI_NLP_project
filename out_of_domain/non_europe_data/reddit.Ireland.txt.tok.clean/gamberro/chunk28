  to be a democrat is to believe that people have the right to choose their governments . 
  trying to change the electoral system to suit your party goes against that right . 
  at the time fianna f\u00e1il dominated the political landscape and opposition parties were only able to form a government by forming a large ( and diverse ) coalition against them . 
  that dominance was already under the pr system . 
  switching to fptp would have have entrenched that dominance ** and ** made things like the interparty governments , which had kept fianna f\u00e1il out of power , impossible . 
  that 's why it feel was a power grab and undemocratic . 
  i 've met many spanish and brazilian au pairs here ( i 'm friends with some of them now ) , some get on well with their families but others have shocking stories to tell . 
  i think it 's open to abuse as much as a result of malice as lack of regulation . 
  i suspect ( but do n't know for certain ) that families are using them because of the high cost of childcare otherwise . 
  from what i 've come across , it 's common that they get paid $ 100-150 euro a week . 
  many of them are also being used as cleaners ( in addition to working as an au-pair ) . 
  i have n't come across any who have contracts and most spanish ones are n't registered in any way as being over here . 
  nor do they know who to turn to if they are being mistreated ( which would be hard to enforce in a court without a contract anyway ) . 
  one of the worst stories i was told by a girl who was thrown out of the house she was staying in at 11 o'clock at night because she complained that the she was not paid the agreed amount . 
  i think you have to be pretty heartless to do that to somebody . 
  i would also add that many of them are desperate to get a job or to at least be learning english because of the unemployment situation in spain ( which is dire ) . 
  i sense that many of the people exploiting them know that and are taking advantage of it . 
  ** edit ** i actually wrote this comment before reading the article , so i 'm sorry about the repitition . 
  essentially i can confirm a lot of the claims made in the article . 
  or coming over the back wall . 
  also once a couple of the fuckers were inside the house , they could easily have reopened the door . 
  whatever works for people , but i personally prefer memrise and there are resources for irish there too . 
  however , these are user generated ( unlike duolingo ) so there can be quite a bit of variation as to quality . 
  that 's been the case for some time . 
  they were already getting elected and implementing neocon ideas ( like the iraq war ) and taking stances that helped its corporate backers ( like shirking any responsibility for global warming ) . 
  that was before the tea party groups came along that insisted the party move further to the right . 
  i thought the 20 % recall a pretty daft idea . 
  in constituencies where the winning candidate 's majority is slim , if would be easy to achieve , particularly as a means to cause havoc for the government of the day . 
  i actually think peacefully blockading the a car would be legitimate form of protest . 
  however , insisting on claiming the protest was peaceful when garda\u00ed were being hit with water balloons , eggs and having insults yelled at them is ( in my mind ) not within the bounds of peaceful protest/assembly . 
  allow me to quote from the article for a sec :, 
   it appears a certain amount of impediment will be protected , however if those protesting create a danger of serious physical injury to themselves and others , arrest most likely will be deemed a proportionate restriction of the right . 
  people have lost their sight as a result of being hit in the face by eggs . 
  surely that counts as `` danger of serious physical injury to themselves and others . '', 
  trying to separate your group of peaceful protesters from those who are not . 
  not all the garda\u00ed were wearing riot gear from the videos and photos i 've seen . 
  other than that , i completely agree . 
  i asked a question about fox hunting [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/2s5af4/ladies_and_gents_why_is_fox_hunting_still_legal/ ) and one of the things that stayed with me was the sense of entitlement these guys have . 
  fox hunting often involves trespassing onto other people 's property for the hunt ( as one of the people on that threat pointed out ) . 
  i 'd also point out that even if fox hunting were a form of pest control , it would be an extremely inefficient one at that . 
  incidentally badgers are regarded as a threat to livestock ( based on flimsy evidence ) , yet they are culled and blood sports involving them , including badger baiting , are banned . 
  why do we make an exception for fox hunting ? 
  sorry , in retrospect i should n't have made that claim about flimsy evidence ( and i take it back ) . 
  i 100 percent agree that badgers carry tb and that poses a threat to livestock . 
  however , it 's not clear [ from what i 've read ] ( http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-irish-badger-cull-worked/17887 ) that culling badgers ( in itself ) has been very effective at preventing the disease . 
  the original land league would never turn out to protect a landlord from eviction . 
  asides from his own house the guy owned many properties in washington , london and dublin ffs . 
  i always manage to get a bus with a lad who clearly has big mental issues . 
  he rants and raves at the top of his voice all the way home . 
  unless you 're a tourist , everybody on the bus acts like it is completely normal and looks down at their phone or book . 
  i 'm sure that 's pretty mild in comparison to others here . 
  is it that they do n't care or that their addiction drives them to do it in a public place ? 
  genuine question . 
  can anybody provide me with a link about this freeman movement ? 
  i keep seeing it come up but i do n't really understand what it 's about . 
  jesus , how did you know ? 
  not only does he drain us of our tax money but he structures his operations to avoid paying any tax in ireland , whether its income or capital gains . 
  i find it infuriating that despite his past corruption and contempt for the irish state ( including the revenue ) , the media still pander to him , even publishing [ whatever nonsense he comes out with . 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/politicians-biggest-hurdle-facing-global-economy-denis-o-brien-1.1664055 ) the guy should be reviled in my opinion . 
  trust me , he 's still around . 
  i saw him there a few weeks ago . 
  ireland gets the same amount of sunshine as [ much of germany , ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/europe_sunshine_hours_map.png ) which is currently expanding solar power as part of the [ energiewende . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/energy_transition ), 
   the moriarty tribunal said it was almost certain lowry had taken bribes from dennis o'brien while lowry was communications minister but the state still does business with o'brien , madness ! . 
  to make matters worse , michael lowry is still a td and has n't spent a day inside a prison cell for anything he 's done . 
  they have a very strong party organisation . 
  a lot of their candidates are young and very ideologically committed . 
  the snp in scotland has achieved a similar kind of structure and has shown that it is able to maintain that even in power ( it 's won two scottish elections and will come first in scotland in the general election in may according to the opinion polls ) . 
  nothing lasts for ever , but in my opinion if sf were in power they could easily achieve what the snp has done and stay in power for a decade or more . 
  this . 
  in addition to the party and electoral systems in the north , the assembly does n't have fiscal power or over a number of other areas . 
  very anti-europe ? 
  i 'm not a fan of the party , but they are n't in favour of leaving the euro or the eu . 
  that is pretty important at the end of the day . 
  i know they were opposed to the treaties , but overall i think their policy on europe indicates a better approach than what we 've had so far . 
  i think the lesson about the euro crisis is that we should be wary over what aspects of european integration we sign up to . 
  that 's the paradox is n't it ? 
  the party clearly wants to govern , but unless it wins 50 + seats it would have to form a coalition , including perhaps with the establishment parties . 
  well they 'd definitely need a relatively large party for stability . 
  the reality is that the only other large party would be an establishment one . 
  personally i do n't see irish becoming the primary language , but we can still create a bilingual society . 
  that is effectively what the basques have done in the last 40 years . 
  on that note , i 'd say 90 percent of catalans and basques are fluent in spanish ( with [ a huge number using it as their primary language ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalonia ) ) . 
  but they also have their own language and if they were full members of the eu it would be unquestionable for that not to be an official language . 
  no difference with ireland and the irish language . 
  i know that this case is over in australia but i thought i 'd share the article on / r/ireland as people face the same problem in ireland unfortunately . 
  lad , if you do n't mind me asking ( i hope you do n't ) , but what makes you read the indo ? 
  is it for the craic or are you interested in what shite they 're printing this week about sinn f\u00e9in ? 
   we in the west had no problem with the annexation of crimea in 1995 by kiev . 
  crimea was part of ukraine from 1954 to 2014 . 
  how was it annexed in 1995 ? 
   polls by ukrainian research agencies find that one year later , crimeans continue to prefer russia : `` eighty-two percent of those polled said they fully supported crimea 's inclusion in russia , and another 11 percent expressed partial support . 
  only 4 percent spoke out against it . '', 
  well , advocating [ separation from russia can result in imprisonment , ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/24/russia-toughens-punishment-separatist-ideas ) so it 's hardly surprising . 
  effectively people are not free to openly challenge the idea that things are better under russia without risking prosecution , thereby hindering free speech and democratic debate . 
  then again , russia has a long history of suppressing people 's rights to self-determination within its borders but [ supporting them in its neighborhood . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_chechen_war ), 
  you also forgot to mention that every region in ukraine ( including crimea ) [ voted to become independent of russia in the ukraine independence referendum of 1991 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_independence_referendum,_1991 ), 
  i could keep going but something tells me that your posts of facts are copypasted , which makes me not want to bother .
