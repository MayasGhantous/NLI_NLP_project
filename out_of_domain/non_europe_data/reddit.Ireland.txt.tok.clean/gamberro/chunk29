  my only question is what country are you from ? 
  you seem to spend a lot of time defending one country in particular on reddit . 
  if i am not mistaken this is yet another copy paste from this account ( in some cases even word for word ) . 
  i challenged some of your points [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ynzch/russia_says_has_right_to_deploy_nuclear_weapons/cpbnpoe?context=3 ) but i 'm not going to bother any further than reporting you and asking you to stop . 
  ** edit : ** just as an example of how over the top this copying and pasting is , the other copied comments were in this very thread . 
  not an ad hominem actually . 
  see the link above where i did argue some of his/her points . 
  however , unlike the user above , i decided not to just copy and paste my points . 
  nor did i particularly feel like repeating myself given that this user is clearly eager to repost the same comment again and again . 
   ukraine was still part of russia until 1991 . 
  having crimea with ukraine was simply an administrative by the ussr . 
  no , ukraine was part of the soviet union until 1991 when it declared its independence from the latter . 
  under the soviet union , it was a separate ssr as was russia . 
  that russia dominated the soviet union ( and that it is it 's legal successor ) there can be no doubt , but it is an important distinction . 
  you 're right i did n't address crimea 's push for independence from ukraine . 
  but omitting the fact that the majority of crimeans voted for independence from the soviet union makes the issue seem much less complex than it really is . 
  yep , there could easily be 6,000 of them out there to get him elected in the first place . 
  from wikipedia :, 
   in 2011 he was re-elected to the seanad , topping the poll with 6,459 ( 19 % ) of first preference votes . 
  ** edit : ** i also find it frustrating that this lad gets to voice his views based on this very undemocratic election , but that 's for another day . 
  the guy has come out with some pretty messed up things before , like when he [ compared abortion to the sandy hook shooting . 
  ] ( http://www.thejournal.ie/ronan-mullen-abortion-newtown-double-think-721352-dec2012/ ), 
  david norris alleged ( on the seanad floor ) that the chap said gay people wanted to have children [ as a `` fashion accessory . 
  '' ] ( http://www.thejournal.ie/david-norris-seanad-1322642-feb2014/ ) mind you i only have norris ' word that he said that . 
  i , for one , would really , really like for projects like this to get built . 
  but you 're right in that i ca n't see it happening anytime soon . 
  that 's the knee jerk response when it comes to investing in ireland . 
  in my personal experience , people are more open about depression and more aware of treatment for it than they were 5/10 years ago . 
  five hundred is still a tragedy but perhaps the number is lower as a result of people getting help . 
  that said , the cutbacks to mental health services ca n't be making the situation any better . 
  israel also has a problem with religious fundamentalists that [ seek to enforce gender segregation , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mehadrin_bus_lines ) [ actively seek to occupy palestinian land ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_jewish_home#ideology ) and [ carry out massacres of civilians . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cave_of_the_patriarchs_massacre ) does it have a right to be a state ? 
  i do n't know the answer to your question , but the chap has been fairly critical of the current government and its broken promises/lies . 
  really ? 
  did he ever endorse the party ? 
  genuine question as i do n't know . 
  in an interview with pat rabitte back in december , o'toole described himself as a social democrat . 
  is n't that a protest vote ? 
  in my opinion we should vote for parties and candidates whose policies we agree with . 
  if you agree with theirs , fine . 
  if you do n't , there are smaller parties and independents who might represent your views ( while still voting against the `` establishment parties '' ) . 
   for me adams ( and thats just adams ) has too much baggage , too many skeletons in closet to be leader of the country . 
  i would be inclined to agree that adams has a lot of baggage . 
  but he 's also not a young man and will have to retire at some point . 
  my sense is that the party will increase in popularity under mcdonald ( the most obvious successor ) . 
   i do n't think many people under the age of 30 particularly care that some members of sinn f\u00e9in were in the ira . 
   this crap about shady backgrounds is never pulled on the labour party who are full to the brim with former oira members . 
  you 're right but i think there 's a fair amount of exceptionalism among sinn fein 's supporters and those who are planning on voting for it now . 
  for many young people voting for it , the ira is in the past and the party has renounced violence with the gfa . 
  we ca n't judge the party based on its actions from the 1980s to 2000s in light of the context and conflict situation . 
  this is despite the party and its armed wing also being involved in things that had nothing to do with the conflict ( and even since the good friday agreement was signed ) , like the colombia three or robert mccartney 's killing . 
  meanwhile fianna fail , fine gael & labour 's record from the 1980s-2000s is brought up again and again as reasons not to vote for them . 
  the criminal and corrupt activities of those parties are all reasons not to vote for them ( quite rightly too ) . 
  but why are we making an exception for sinn fein then ? 
  do you have a source for that claim ? 
  [ there are 60,000 people claiming social welfare payments overseas ] ( http://m.independent.ie/irish-news/60000-people-claiming-social-welfare-abroad-29401429.html ) but that includes irish people and says nothing about whether they were non-contributory or not . 
  secondly , these include child support payments send by eu nationals which they are entitled to as eu citizens ( as irish people working elsewhere in the eu are ) . 
  on the first article you shared :, 
   as of mar 2012 , there were 62,652 european union nationals receiving jobseeker 's allowance here , ** although this may account for both contributory and non-contributory recipients ** due to the manner in which data is held by the central statistics office . 
  so they are not all non-contributory recipients as you stated above . 
  many of these are eu nationals claiming bendfits they are entitled to having worked and paid prsi . 
  secondly , it 's also worth bearing in mind the article is also from 2012 when the employment situation was poor and the national unemployment rate was much higher than it is today at 14.5 percent . 
  thirdly , what does eu citizens claiming jobseeker 's allowance have to do with racism against black africans ? 
  assuming what you and / u/smithman said was correct about foreigners receiving benefits , it would seem black africans are being singled out sinply for being a [ visible minority . 
  ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/visible_minority ), 
  i am sorry if i offended you with what i wrote . 
  i retract what i said and out of respect , will remove the comment . 
  what do you mean ? 
   is n't that what similar to what syriza are trying to do ? 
  i would agree with you except the government has sided with germany and the core countries against syriza . 
  noonan has flip flopped as is now against a debt conference or does n't believe one is possible . 
  the government seems to have recognised that in the short to medium term , countries like ireland/greece/spain have to be allowed to recover by easing austerity , allow for demand to recover or public investment ( given how low interest rates are ) . 
  but when another eurozone country seeks the same thing , they refuse to stand by them . 
  does n't that seem shortsighted at the very least ? 
  well , fianna f\u00e1il were the ones who got us into this mess with such budgets ( particularly as these did n't rein in credit fuelled spending ) . 
  i think the lesson to be learnt is that using fiscal policy to gain popularity does n't make for sound economic policy . 
  that is pretty damn racist man . 
  ** edit : ** actually , should i even be surprised given your username ? 
  it 's a pretty good sub alright . 
  i 've got a couple of questions about history answered there before . 
  sir/madam , do n't bother with the user below . 
  he is either a troll or really believes the revolting stuff he comes out with , in which case he should get professional help . 
  either way , do n't let the sad individual take up any of your time . 
  have they gone to the land registry or checked the registry of deeds ? 
  if it is registered with the land registry , you can find out who owns it very quickly ( less so with the registry of deeds ) . 
  this does involve you paying a fee though , but still . 
  i do n't see that option as straightforward or automatic . 
  efta members [ have to accept free movement of labour ] ( http://www.efta.int/eea/policy-areas/persons/persons ) which is something british euroskeptics really want to get rid of . 
  what was he like as a lecturer ? 
  [ this gobshite ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/hermann_kelly ) used to teach in my school and was horrible . 
  he used to spend class time telling the kids that abortion was wrong , that homosexuality was unnatural and more . 
  apparently he now works for ukip which does n't surprise me . 
  that 's what the swiss government is seeking . 
  however , it 's not clear at all that they can implement this and keep their current access to the single market . 
  the commission has said that free movement of labour is non-negotiable and there might be a second swiss referendum on the issue this year . 
  i am afraid that sick bastards out there will learn from this and take steps to hide their steps . 
  i do n't receive it but i have had the misfortune of reading it . 
  it 's terrible . 
  they are not rounding them up at all . 
  but they are/will be forcing them to pay without having their say in court .
