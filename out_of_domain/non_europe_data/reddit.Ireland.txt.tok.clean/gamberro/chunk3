  all in all , i think recent history proves that democracy remains very fragile across the continent . 
  true but the end of the cold war also helped bring about an end to one party government in many countries ( see zambia and tanzania ) . 
  they might not be liberal democracies , but the elections broadly speaking are free and fair . 
  i agree with the op 's question in that the majority of french speaking countries , even if they held elections for a brief period , reverted to one party rule ( a good example would be congo-brazzaville . ), 
  what strikes me as odd is that if such a trend exists , why does n't a larger power do something about it ? 
   our 24 hour news cycle has done us a pretty big disservice here . 
  they do have that outside the us , take a look at sky news in the uk for instance . 
  it 's not much better than fox in terms of sensationalising trivia except that licensing laws restrict what gets broadcast . 
  i should also add that despite richard littlejohn 's best efforts , the brits do n't have an equivalent just yet of hannity and o'reilly . 
  really ? 
  care to share any interesting anecdotes/stories ? 
  i know the article mentions that one of the criminals involved is in prison for a different crime , but if you read it you 'll also see that many more people were involved . 
  it just seems frustrating that more people have n't been charged for this appalling crime . 
  i ca n't agree more . 
  i actually stumbled on this case as i was reading up on cases involving the roma in france . 
  but i do n't mean to shock/horrify people by posting this , but rather just wanted to see if anybody else had heard about it . 
  the examiner [ claimed ] ( http://www.irishexaminer.com/features/we-must-fight-irish-prejudice-187314.html ) that the media not paying attention to it suggests `` an undercurrent of racism '' , but i 'm not so sure about that . 
  why are n't you getting more upvotes ? 
  that was a very informative answer . 
  you should do an ama on / askhistorians or something !, 
  they may not have committed any crimes ( yet ) but they have gone to the trouble of causing huge emotional anguish to people across the country . 
  honestly , they are n't happy with spewing their hateful message within the confines of their own church but rather insist on travelling all over the country to harm others . 
  a lot of the activities of the group are n't illegal simply because law makers did n't think anybody would be as sick and perverse to protest at somebody else 's funeral . 
  since then law makers have [ had to legislate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/respect_for_america%27s_fallen_heroes_act ) just because of them to try and curtail their hateful message . 
  i honestly do n't know how low anybody can go than to celebrate somebody else 's death . 
  ** edit ** sorry if i offended you with my comment as i did n't mean to . 
  to be honest i think anonymous ' actions come about from the absence of legislation regarding hate speech . 
   currently , american citizens have the right to voice their opinion in public , however insane or hurtful that message is because they 're not breaking the law . 
  in my opinion that needs to change to take into account hate speech ( even if that means amending the first amendment ) . 
  most of the developed world has laws preventing hate speech , hence why shirley phelps is banned from the uk . 
  racism in ireland has been discussed many times here . 
  i guess the original ama was removed because it violated some rule on this subreddit . 
  also , i think it was removed because they did n't want to give this guy a chance to express his white supremacist ideas ( and rightly so in my opinion ) . 
  ireland does n't seem to have any watersheds and if i am not mistaken the shannon is the longest river in the british isles . 
  you 're right likud has n't , although the party leader and prime minister netanyahu has apparently ( according to the article ) . 
  while i 'm appalled by violence and do n't want any in the future , if netanyahu does reverses his position on this it will most likely result in another intifada or something like that . 
  if all he cares about is keeping power rather than providing incentives towards peace over war , then unfortunately ( given the history of the region ) violence is likely . 
  great !, 
  thanks very much for that . 
   i would hardly describe the systemic and organised rape and sodomy of children as an exaggerated caricature . 
  i agree with you but i 'd rephrase that as the `` systemic and organised cover-up ... '' really that was what was systemic about the catholic church ( especially the hierarchy ) as it wanted to hold onto power by disregarding the welfare of children . 
  i agree with you that he has no right to lecture us , as not taking action to protect children from predators was rampant in the church from john charles mcquaid to sean brady himself . 
  the culture of silence has also been well documented in the [ murphy and ryan reports . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murphy_report#emphasis_on_the_avoidance_of_scandal ), 
   `` there is no more important value than upholding the right to life in all circumstances . '', 
  really ? 
  even when the mother 's life is at risk ? 
  what planet are these people living on ? 
  well , do n't forget that bbc is available in lots of different languages , especially asian and african ones . 
  i use their [ spanish ] ( http://www.bbcmundo.com ) and [ portuguese ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/portuguese/ ) versions from time to time . 
  apart from that , [ el pa\u00eds ] ( http://www.elpais.com ) is probably one of the best sources of news in spanish . 
  edit : anybody interested should have a look at the selection offered by the bbc [ here ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/languages/index.shtml ) . 
  i am currently at a beginner stage , having studied it for a couple of months . 
  brazilian . 
  currently using fsi , memrise , colloquial and assimil portuguese . 
  i 've some relatives living in brazil at the moment . 
  also , lusophone culture in general fascinates me . 
  english and some spanish . 
  i 'd like to reach a c1 level in portuguese this coming year , which is a big jump from a a2/b1 level . 
  i know it 's a challenge but it 's always good to be ambitious . 
  any thoughts ? 
  very nice summary , thank you . 
  for anybody who 'd like more information about the `` new '' moderates , there 's a [ very , very good article on them here . 
  ] ( http://www.policy-network.net/pno_detail.aspx?id=4290&amp;title=the+impressive+rise+of+sweden%e2%80%99s+%e2%80%9cnew%e2%80%9d+moderates ), 
  glad to see somebody else here likes caf\u00e9 brasil as it 's a very good resource . 
  i do n't know if you know if you have any spanish but `` t\u00e1 falado '' is also good for looking over some grammar points . 
  boa sorte !, 
  caf\u00e9 brasil is a good resource for intermediate learners . 
  you can [ download episodes and follow them with the transcripts here . 
  sorry , i 've been away for a few days without access to the internet so that 's why i did n't update this . 
  i 've managed to hit my goals for using colloquial portuguese and vocabulary on anki but not the grammar book . 
  i 've also listened to four lessons of caf\u00e9 brasil which has helped a great deal in improving vocabulary or highlighting key words that i will use again . 
  as for actual speaking , i managed to meet up with a native speaker twice last week to practice which has helped correct problems with my pronunciation . 
  on another note , i think i will combine the grammar book with gramatica activa to reach my target . 
  i 'm sorry i have n't been following events on this thread . 
  i will do so in the future . 
  objectives for my first week :, 
  4 lessons of colloquial portuguese - check . 
  i did get about half way through it before i moved on to something else . 
  clear my anki deck every day and add 50 new words for the week . 
  - check . 
  get through 4 lessons of portuguese : an essential grammar . 
  - not quite . 
  i got through 3 over the course of the week . 
  true , but as a european that has visited the us many times , i have to say that urban planning with regards to pedestrians leaves a lot to be desired . 
  the distances are simply enormous and many places do n't have adequate sidewalks ( or any ) in addition to pedestrian crossings . 
  additionally , many states have `` turn right on red '' laws that i found made crossing the street a nightmare . 
  i wo n't miss being a pedestrian over there at all . 
  i agree . 
  it seemed to me like poor taste for this link to be getting upvotes elsewhere on reddit , but i think it really does n't belong here . 
  this week was pretty productive by my standards :, 
  - i finished o pequeno pr\u00edncipe ( my first novel in portuguese ) . 
  - listened to six podcasts of caf\u00e9 brasil , reading over the transcript after having listened to the audio to pick up any unknown vocabulary . 
  - five duolingo classes . 
  - completed up to unit 27 of gram\u00e1tica activa 1 . 
  - cleared my anki deck everyday . 
  to be honest , i had never heard of william binchy before and had to look him up on wikipedia . 
   professor binchy is one of ireland 's most respected legal researchers and has published books in a variety of areas . 
  has anybody else noted that the wikipedia pages of a lot of irish pro-lifers seem like they were written by the individuals in question ? 
  the entry on ronan mullen is pretty bad on that count .
