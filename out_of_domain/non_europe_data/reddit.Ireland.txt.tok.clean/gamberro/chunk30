  i do n't know if you 're referring to people living in ireland or elsewhere . 
  if you 're talking about people living in ireland , i 'm delighted . 
  i 've come across cases of polish and nigerian people learning it . 
  you do n't have to speak it to be irish , but it is something most irish are proud of . 
  as for people living overseas who learn it , people are free to do whatever they want . 
  but part of me wishes they would learn and protect indigenous languages in their own country as well . 
  for example , i 've met french people learning it and part of me wished they would divert that effort into protecting the indigenous languages of their own country ( many of which are under threat ) . 
  there are no ideological reasons to join fianna fail as the party has no real ideology . 
  it 's just a populist or [ catch-all party . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/big_tent ), 
  mr. kelly taught in my school as it happens and the guy was a religious loon . 
  he used to spend class time that abortion was wrong and that homosexuality was `` unnatural . '', 
  this was n't even in religion class but science !, 
  needless to say i 'm not entirely surprised by the fact he works for ukip . 
  one of the parts that i have found so despicable about [ ukip using the rotherham scandal for their political gains ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-27533375 ) is that they have a guy working for them who attacked the victims of child abuse by the catholic church . 
  [ he even wrote a book ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/hermann_kelly ) in which he said there was a `` culture of false accusations '' against the church . 
  what nonsense economics by donnelly are you referring to ? 
  genuine question as i do n't know . 
  i think the argument is that dissolving irish water comes with a cost as well that we have to think through carefully ( regardless of what happens with regards water charges ) . 
  does not fit in with the confirmation bias , please move along . 
  ** edit : ** this comment was a joke . 
  i 'm glad somebody explained what the army do in the lead up to the parade . 
  there are certain things we could spend money on to provide for ireland 's defence without wasting money and maintaining our neutrality , such as early warning radar . 
  was the llama used by the incas to supply their armies ? 
  i know that warfare in mesoamerican cultures was hindered by the absence of the wheel and draught animals . 
  my guess would be that that was n't such a problem in the inca empire . 
  you 're right about a full-scale attack being known about already , but small sorties of aircraft are harder to detect . 
  early warning radar would allow know we would know well in advance if russian ( or any other country 's ) bombers were approaching our airspace . 
  is it just me or are external consultants used an awful lot to the public sector in this country ? 
  tl ; dr irish oligarch teams up with russian one to invest $ 16 billion in telecoms market . 
  there is future for dun laoghaire ( if you look at the 40 foot side there is activity going on ) . 
  i think the problem is that the council and developers seem to have completely abandoned the main street and the rest of it . 
  the library moving to the seafront appears to be yet another feature of the main street that 's gone . 
  fixing dun laoghaire , in my view , would basically reversing what the council has done so far . 
  anyway , i 've thought of some solutions that might change things there :, 
  * reduce or get rid of the parking tolls around the main street to increase footfall . 
  * get rid of the old shopping centre and use that space for apartments or something else . 
  * create a centralised management for the main street that will try to use up the empty units and offer selection . 
  a lot of the units on the main street are either empty or are basically the same as other ones . 
  people are willing to go down to the forty foot side because there are units that draw people . 
  if a main street management could get something that draws people and offer free parking , the place would pick up . 
  this . 
  it 's also come out that he lied to the tribunal ( see the phelan tapes ) . 
  could n't lowry be prosecuted by the dpp after all the shit he 's done ? 
  the same goes for haely-rae . 
  the sad thing is that if they prop up a government , the kind of clientelism/parish-pump politics that they got elected on will only continue . 
  the far right people on this sub will be coming out of the walls . 
  i think the far righters are linking to these threads from / pol or something . 
  when there is an article on immigration , racism or travellers a whole bunch of people who hardly ever are active here suddenly start coming over from / r/european . 
  here 's a [ recent example . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/2zoi9l/black_africans_face_most_racist_abuse_in_ireland/ ), 
  ** edit : ** thank you for your comment by the way . 
  i think those two should be ashamed of themselves for what they 've come out with . 
  that 's not what i meant . 
  i meant they tend to pop up on this thread whenever asylum seekers or immigration is discussed . 
  as you can see from the comment by / u/tigernmas , i was n't entirely mistaken either . 
  i think he meant they are stupid as they do n't realise it 's obvious there is a vote brigade going on . 
  however , since you are fielding questions , do you think there are a lot of racist people on / r/european ? 
  you were praising a neo-nazi group in the uk and you ask why i think that 's shameful ? 
  it depends on your reasons for opposing it and what measures the government should adopt in response to it . 
  how do you propose ireland , japan or zambia retain their `` culture and ethnicity '' ? 
  what mr. coppinger are you talking about ? 
  [ ireland is currently experiencing deflation , ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ireland/inflation-cpi ) thereby increasing the value ( and the burden ) of our debt . 
  a bit of inflation would do the opposite . 
  i see i 'm not the only one who thinks he 's in the closet . 
  what did they do to your friends if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  there used to be guys outside bank of ireland on college green with graphic pictures of abortion . 
  i guess that was them . 
  i did n't know those photos were false either . 
  if it makes you feel any better , i also spent many years in college ( originally wanted to work in education ) . 
  now i work in a job and am on a lower salary than you . 
  ** edit : ** i do n't mean to belittle what you wrote ( if anything i feel for you ) . 
  i mean we can both feel depressed while looking at this thread . 
  how this guy expects us to believe that he , along with his `` institute '' , are not campaigning in the referendum is beyond me . 
  he just spelled out various strategies of the no camp and what can be done to swing the vote their way . 
  ** edit : ** [ his hypocrisy knows no bounds . 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/iona-institute-criticises-multinationals-over-yes-call-1.2178946 ) apparently twitter is not supposed to endorse a position in the referendum , but his `` institute '' is free to do the opposite and maintain the guise that it is n't campaigning . 
  i 'm on well under 30k working in a job which often ends up in long hours . 
  personally i 'd rather not complain about my lot as i know a lot of people ( in this country and elsewhere ) have it worse than i do . 
  the salary does n't get to me , for now at least , as i tried really hard to get my foot in the door somewhere like a lot of young people . 
  also my friends and family support me emotionally when the going gets tough . 
  good luck with it . 
  whatever route you go down and whatever way you decide to apply your degree , you have a useful skill set under your belt . 
  those professional exams are a big sacrifice , but remember that the job , the career and your salary are only part of the bigger picture . 
  all the best to you too lad !, 
  beautiful . 
  it does . 
  thank you very much . 
  just to let you know lads , the guys over at / r/european are trying to [ use discussions on immigration on subs like this to spread their ideas .

  it is pretty much resolved among genocide scholars and has been for some time . 
  i think this measure is to put pressure on turkey to recognise the genocide which it has refused to do for nearly 100 years . 
  to be honest i find it pretty sickening that the turkish government reacts angrily whenever the issue is brought up ( accusing governments of racism and summoning the ambassador as was done in the last month ) . 
  as it happens my uncle is married to a lady of armenian descent ( from syria but whose family was originally deported from their homeland during the genocide ) so i 've heard a lot of anger towards the turkish government 's stance over the years . 
  the term `` genocide '' was coined by raphael lemkin [ with reference to what happened to the armenians . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mobygla7fdc ) the issue is also pretty much resolved among genocide scholars and has been for some time . 
  seriously , what group is behind those posters ? 
  from looking at them , it 's not clear just who is calling for a no vote . 
  [ jesus , you 're right . 
  ] ( http://mothersandfathersmatter.org/about/ ) to think that quinn expects us to believe that the iona institute is not campaigning so it does n't have to reveal its funding .
