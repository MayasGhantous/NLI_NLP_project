  i 'm not familiar with the background to the case . 
  why do you call him a `` little shit '' ? 
  also was he really in the muslim brotherhood ? 
  i could n't find anything about that after a quick google search . 
  thank you for filling me in . 
  thank you for that . 
  thank you . 
  i remember that footage of the egyptian army shooting morsi 's supporters . 
  simply horrible . 
  i think he 's a reincarnation of gregory barnes . 
  are you really ? 
  i did some work in the same ngo a few years afterwards . 
  i have n't seen the documentary but i know the basis of it and i 'm pretty angry with the guy . 
  i was wondering when you were going to show up . 
  * the basque history of the world * is highly readable as you say , but has too much poor history in it to recommend reading ( see his claim about basque pre-columbian contact ) . 
  however , i thank you for your very insightful post . 
  on top of all the people killed in wwii , [ places like this ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/lidice ) ( near prague ) means it 's likely to be very offensive to a lot of people . 
  just to get the ball rolling ... 
  `` i 'm definitely voting no now . '', 
  ** edit : ** idea courtesy of / u/ramsesniblick3rd, 
  i would like the irish who are opposed to direct provision , or your friends from / r/european [ who will soon be promoting their views here , ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/european/comments/32k0bu/best_way_to_broker_the_subject_of/ ) to try going through it . 
  those centres are a [ money making racket for the companies that run them . 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/direct-provision-asylum-firms-highly-profitable-records-show-1.2030546 ) they do that by keeping costs to a minimum as the records show but you chose not to mention . 
  there are a few other things you forgot from your list :, 
  - unable to work or contribute to society . 
  - unable to acquire skills that will allow them to get a job if their application is processed ( the two courses provided for them are english and basic computing ) . 
  - forced to live in legal limbo and unable to plan ahead ( or carry out any life goals/objectives ) . 
  i could go on but i do n't have the time and something tells me that it wo n't make a difference to the debate here . 
   they keep appealing deportations to stay in the country . 
  when they have been in those centres for 11 years . 
  its not because their case has n't been heard but they appealing . 
  the system for processing them encourages these delays . 
  ireland is the only country in the eu that does n't process applications and subsidiary protection applications at the same time , which means asylum-seekers must first exhaust the refugee process . 
  that can take years to do .

  good man carlos !, 
  the chap is a relative of mine as it happens , although i have only met him at the occasional family gathering . 
  we should get him to do a tv comeback . 
  you 're referring to stamp duty , right ? 
  that meant $ 300 million a year to the revenue at the height of the boom . 
  good man for looking that up . 
  i got my figure from [ here . 
  ] ( http://economic-incentives.blogspot.ie/2010/08/stamped-out.html?m=1 ), 
  they also seem happy to call people who do n't agree with their view of irish history or politics as `` blueshirts . '', 
  for a party who would rather people move on and not judge them on the past , they seem to be happy to do the opposite . 
  no , i 'm afraid it was n't a typo and that i 'm just an eijit for having misread the thing ( twice ) . 
  all the best . 
  is the iona institute really behind this truck ? 
  they are clearly campaigning if that is the case . 
  holy shit , i saw the poster on the left the other day and thought it was a joke . 
  i see they want ( marriage ) equality for children first , not gays . 
  do n't hesitate to give us all an update on the little fella after you ho to the vet . 
  i can understand your frustration but please do n't let it stop you from going out to vote to make sure it passes . 
  it 'll all be over soon . 
  the people over at channel4 [ investigated this ] ( http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-irish-badger-cull-worked/17887 ) a while back . 
  do n't be surprised that these guys are a little out there . 
  the `` alliance for the defence of the family and marriage '' is affiliated with certain catholic fringe groups . 
  its chairman , richard greene , is the former leader of the christian solidarity party and was also involved in c\u00f3ir ( some political group set up by youth defence ) . 
  torturing animals sounds like something psychopaths would do . 
  there are cruel , nasty and disturbed people among the settled population as well . 
  is mej\u00edas against all demonstrations on the 11th september or just this year ? 
  if i 'm not mistaken she argued that this year it is very close to the elections on the 27-s . 
  i just had a look at that page and spotted a few posts asking people to brigade on / r/ireland . 
  they seem crazy for some imaginary internet points . 
  i hope they realise that something getting upvoted does not make it more valid . 
  i would really like for that report to get leaked to spite that guy . 
  the man holds irish law in complete contempt ( bribing michael lowry ) but then uses his media empire and the legal system to control what is said about him . 
  it 's probably worth remembering that he holds the irish taxpayer in complete contempt too , structuring his operations to avoid paying tax . 
  after he sold his stake in esat ( that he acquired partly through the bribe to lowry ) , he claimed he was not resident or domiciled here to avoid paying cgt on it . 
  first of all lads , the people over at / r/european are [ trying to use discussions on immigration in subs like / r/ireland to promote their views . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/european/comments/32k0bu/best_way_to_broker_the_subject_of/ ) i also have a suspicion that they are linking to this threads on this sub from chatrooms in order to brigade in posts about immigration . 
  however , that is just a suspicion , nothing more . 
  if you look over at / r/european there are some irish users there with pretty strong views on immigration and they also sometimes post comments here . 
  i 've encountered a couple of them here and some [ freely admit they are racist . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/32g5cv/asylum_applicants_increase_by_129pc_since_start/cqb56qe ), 
  i do n't think he was just referring to you as there are other right wing users posting here and they may be what he 's talking about . 
  i remember some charming user with a username along the lines of '' / u/americansareuntermen '' ( americans are [ subhuman ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/untermensch ) ) who was posting here in threads about immigration . 
  anyway , we exchanged a few comments a while back and you said you were a racist because `` there is a difference between cultures and ethnicities in the world and they should stay that way . '', 
  what are the differences between ethnicities that you are talking about ? 
  for me , there are two things that are really sickening about lowry :, 
  * he has never spent a day in jail for all the corruption he 's been involved in over the years nor even been tried in court . 
  * enough of his constituents love him that he 's guaranteed re-election next time round . 
  this is despite the fact that he is corrupt as hell . 
  i agree with you . 
  however , i asked the question to hear what / u/righty _ macwing had to say . 
  he might mean physical differences or he might mean mental differences . 
  as i 'm sure you 're aware , differences between ethnicities is often used by racists with regards supposed mental attributes ( particularly with regards intelligence ) . 
  but regardless , what he is saying is that he wants different races to stay that way . 
  so is he opposed to [ miscegenation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miscegenation ) or even non-white immigration ? 
  either way , it 's pretty damn racist . 
  it appears to be a troll account . 
  if you look at spain , madrid is doing so as well . 
  also you can see the legacy of east germany pretty clearly . 
  maureen o'sullivan mentioned one case in the dail in which the hounds chased the fox for 13 kilometres before the fox was either trapped or collapsed and was mauled to death . 
  if there is a genuine need to keep fox numbers down , they can use culling like they do with badgers . 
  whether or not it is necessary , it is a quick death for the animal at least . 
  however , making an animal suffer for one 's entertainment is pretty sadistic in my opinion . 
  i also asked a question about fox hunting a while back [ if you 're interested . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/2s5af4/ladies_and_gents_why_is_fox_hunting_still_legal/ ), 
  the arrogance of the guy .
