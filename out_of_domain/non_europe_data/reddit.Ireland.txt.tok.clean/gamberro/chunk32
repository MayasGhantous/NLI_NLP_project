  does he really expect us to believe that the credit fuelled bubble had nothing to do with his seven years in office as minister for finance ? 
  or that the government had increasingly come to rely on the boom to balance the books ? 
  the government was becoming reliant on indirect taxes like stamp duty and cgt [ even when mccreevy was in charge ] ( https://irelandafternama.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/stamp-duty.jpg ) . 
  i accept that there were people there ( probably the majority ) who were protesting peacefully/correctly . 
  but i still find it infuriating that some protesters are shouting `` peaceful protest '' while standing beside others who are clearly doing the opposite . 
  what are they trying to do by that anyway ? 
  remind the other protesters that it 's meant to be peaceful ? 
  or , more likely in my mind , remind the guards that it 's a peaceful protest and thus any strong armed reaction would be unjustified . 
   one woman shouted : `` you all have homes and we can easily find them . 
  that sounds like an [ escrache . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/escrache ) if they do do that , i hope it would be peaceful at least . 
  i 'm not entirely sure what you 're getting at . 
  my point was that as minister for finance he balanced the books by milking the property bubble/credit fuelled boom . 
  this . 
  also that interest figure is at a time when interest rates are at record lows . 
  it is only going to increase as interest rates go up . 
  i posted the link to the original report for those who wanted to read it . 
  you can see a sort of summary of its contents [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/protective-edge ), 
  absolutely this . 
  ff has been inherently populist from the get go with no ideology or political orientation . 
  in political science it 's what 's called a [ catch all party . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/big_tent ), 
  it depends . 
  people are rarely on the fence with regards sf on this subreddit . 
  sometimes posts supportive of sf are heavily upvoted which others critical of sf get downvoted into oblivion . 
  other times it 's the opposite as you mention . 
  if you 'd like to learn more there are plenty of resources out there . 
  [ here 's a discussion ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1n0fyz/dia_dh%c3%b3ibh_this_weeks_language_of_the_week_irish/ ) about the language ( with resources ) if you 're interested . 
  as others here have pointed out , he clearly wanted to set the victim 's costume on fire . 
  whether or not he wanted the victim to get burnt , he is responsible for what he did . 
  the fact that he did n't even admit that he had done it until a year later is appalling in my opinion . 
  i understand that . 
  but as a neutral state with little tectonic activity , the risk of a meltdown is low . 
  i was wondering who put them there on merrion square when i went by there the other day . 
  he did n't give himself into police straight away but the next day . 
  in fact he fled the scene while the victim was on fire . 
  he also did n't admit that he had caused the injuries until a year later . 
   as the victim lay on the ground , adams ran about thirty yards and kicked him in the forehead and head in what garda\u00ed described as an `` unprovoked assault . '', 
  i 'd be concerned about letting him retain custody of his child , let alone being able to keep animals . 
  jesus , that 's depressing reading . 
  a barrister according to wikipedia . 
  his article also says that he is married to geraldine kennedy . 
  that ca n't be the same geraldine kennedy of the irish times , can it ? 
  just to let you know op , voldemort will be issuing you with a cease and desist letter over this . 
  as well as about cameron sand the tories . 
  many of them have little if any work experience outside politics . 
  i think the judge made the right decision as well . 
  but i hope to god that mr. damache has changed his ways now that he 's out walking the streets . 
  i do n't understand what you mean . 
  any particular reason why you put your whole post in bold ? 
  i lurk on that sub from time to time . 
  there are plenty of people there who would like to start a race war against muslims and other groups . 
  there are others who post on here from time to time who are opposed to miscegenation etc. 
  yeah , i used to play football with a lad who is studying medicine in slovakia . 
  i guess this is noteworthy as it 's a sign of the times we live in . 
  i have a relative who has just qualified as a clinical psychologist over in the uk and would like to move back . 
  this story is going to scare the hell out of them . 
  the users from identity ireland and / r/european will soon be here to tell you exactly that . 
  you 're right and it is tiring that what sf did during the troubles is brought up and not other groups ( just look at labour members and the oira etc ) . 
  so if we are going to avoid double standards when we look at what parties were doing in the 1930s , we will also have to look at ~ ~ sf and ~ ~ the [ ira 's collusion with nazi germany in wwii . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_republican_army_%e2%80%93_abwehr_collaboration_in_world_war_ii ), 
  thank you for the correction . 
  i will update my post . 
  god this is tiring . 
  supposing that what adams is saying is correct , whether he was a member or not is only part of the story . 
  only last year did he say that while he had never been a member , he had `` never disassociated '' himself from the ira . 
  so let 's suppose he was n't . 
  it 's still quite possible that either he sat in on army council meetings or even sat on the army council itself ( as intelligence services north and south of the border have suggested ) without being a member of the ira . 
  that would allow him to keep repeating that he was never a member . 
  it 's not just the government doing this but the establishment parties as well . 
  miche\u00e1l martin has attacked sf in recent days and even michael mcdowell came out of his political grave to do the same . 
  can you give us an example of internet message boards that make stormfront seem mild by comparison ? 
  thanks for informing me . 
  there are plenty of people on that who would like to start a race war against muslims . 
  i ca n't help but find it disturbing . 
  i 've been following this closely so for those who do n't know , the catalan government has called early elections for the 27th of september and ( most ) pro-independence parties along with organisations have joined together to form a single party list * junts pel s\u00ed . 
  * as such , the pro-independence camp views these elections as plebiscite and they intend to announce secession from spain if they win a majority of seats . 
  it 's like the [ 1918 election in ireland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_general_election,_1918 ) in that sense . 
  i do n't know whether this will serve to achieve independence but it certainly seems that the momentum is swinging that way . 
  two opinion polls have shown that pro-independence parties will win a majority of seats ( [ here 's a link ] ( http://www.ara.cat/eleccions27s/eleccions_27s_0_1424857754.html ) to one ) . 
  however , [ this poll ] ( http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/politica/barometro-ceo-independencia-4325694 ) from july shows a majority do n't want independence and others have questioned the validity of the plebiscite if it based on seats and not votes . 
  to sum up , it 's going to be interesting seeing what happens in the next month . 
  i personally think it 's disgraceful and pretty undemocratic that they have n't been able to hold a legally binding referendum on it . 
  there are general elections in spain in december . 
  they are crucial in deciding the stance of the central government and consequently how this plays out . 
  if the pp wins , then a `` diplomatic civil war '' will probably be the outcome . 
  if psoe ( the centre-left party ) gets in , it will be more sympathetic to catalonia . 
  however , neither of the two main parties ( who 'll form the next government ) recognize these elections as truly plebiscitary . 
  one thing about what you wrote , the spanish constitution was not drafted by franco but by a panel after franco died . 
  the constitution contains things ( like co-official status for languages other than spanish ) that would have given the tyrant franco nightmares . 
  however , the government 's use of the fact that the constitution does n't allow for self-determination has holes in its legitimacy . 
  the constitution was written during the transition period after franco 's rule and was accepted partly because a bad constitution offering democracy is better than no constitution . 
  besides a constitution is a working document not sacrosanct ( we have amendments after all ) . 
  as for erc , i already knew about their links with sinn f\u00e9in . 
  while i do n't doubt they are committed to a catalan republic and have respect for most of their reasons , i find their use of economic arguments for independence questionable . 
  the party has a slogan `` espanya ens roba '' / spain steals from us because of the fiscal transfers to the rest of spain ( which incidentally ends up going to poorer regions ) . 
  catalonia pays more than it receives , but it is not quite theft or `` exploitation '' as they set out ( [ madrid pays more that catalonia does ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/local/madrid/20140723/54412162736/madrid-aporta-16-723-millones-mas-de-los-que-recibe-el-doble-que-cataluna.html ) ) . 
  while not necessarily an erc thing , in catalonia the opposition to fiscal transfers often goes along with a bit of contempt for southern parts of the country for being scroungers . 
  i 've never come across the user above before , but after a quick look at his profile he certainly is a big fan of / r/european .
