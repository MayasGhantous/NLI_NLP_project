  yes , in 17 days we will see how the catalans vote . 
  i would like to know how long it will take before we clamp down on the isle of man . 
  it seems widely exploited by individuals in ireland and the uk willing to hide things ( companies incorporated there do not have to file accounts for example ) . 
  what university was that ? 
  i think his point is that food banks are a sign the welfare state is failing . 
  as t\u00e1naiste , minister for social protection and leader of the labour party she should be very concerned about that . 
  attending the opening of a food bank appears to suggest the opposite . 
  people have a right to protest . 
  those who are able to have a responsibility to go out and work/contribute to keep the state running , including the social welfare system . 
  however , i do n't think we have a right to label all the water protesters as people on the dole refusing to get work . 
  however , i will also say i wonder how they have time to protest as they do during the working week . 
  not everybody , but most people work that or something close to that . 
  that is my impression anyway . 
   he seems to like ireland a lot . 
  that seems to be a common thing with americans . 
  just saying . 
  i , for one , am really disappointed . 
  this city really needs investment in infrastructure and especially public transport . 
  large parts of it are reliant on one form of public transport ( the bus ) and when bus services are disrupted for any reason it causes chaos . 
  but anyway , it 'll take at least a generation for ireland to recover from the bank bailout . 
  the city will have only gotten bigger by the time we have the money to invest in infrastructure again . 
  my mistake . 
  o'connell street would be a lot safer ( in my opinion ) if they closed off those alleyways off o'connell street at night . 
  i used to have to walk around there at night after i got off work and did not feel safe at all . 
  but these are alleyways , probably mainly used for deliveries during the day . 
  i do n't see why they need to be open at night . 
  installing gates and closing them at night would probably make that area safer . 
  did you tweet that directly to him or something ? 
  i do n't think it 'd be any of his business what you said about him on social media . 
  jeez , sorry that happened to you . 
  can confirm . 
  i was visiting a friend once in a small city called augsburg and sure enough there was an irish pub . 
  the barman was from drogheda and did n't even speak german . 
  that 's the one . 
  nice place it was too . 
  i would have thought their plans to form a majority after the next election by relying on lowry would have made that clear . 
  in an ideal world , lowry would be behind bars and not being considered as a potential ally of fine gael . 
  so long as it suits their interests ( either political or financial ) they do n't care about the moriarty tribunal or denis o'brien 's corruption . 
  my aunt is from the armenian community in syria and was born/brought up in damascus until she was 12 . 
  like many armenians in the region , her family was originally from elsewhere but was deported to the syrian desert during the genocide . 
  i 've never heard her complain about ill treatment as a result of being a minority ** but ** her family ended up leaving when their business was nationalised under hafez al assad . 
  she always wanted to go back to syria to visit the places from her childhood but that might never be possible now . 
  anyways , i digress . 
  i 'm glad you feel at home in ireland . 
  my heart goes out to those fleeing or trapped a terrible situation in iraq and syria right now . 
  all the best now . 
  mr. \u00d3 briain , please . 
  if you write `` mr. o'brien '' people might think you are trying to get somebody like denis o'brien elected . 
  that thought is frightening enough it itself . 
   quoting these , o\u2019brien identifies `` the most egregious '' of the `` highly defamatory and entirely false '' allegations against him to be as follows : that `` a government minister ` helped secure a state contract ' for me '' ; that `` i ` stopped the presses to alter a news report ''' ; that `` i had gotten journalists fired from their jobs '' ; that `` i was given ` huge writedowns on debts owed to a state bank ''' ; that `` i use philanthropy as ` a pr tool ''' ; and that `` i had ` tried to silence the irish parliament ''' . 
  are n't all of these `` highly defamatory and entirely false '' allegations very well documented at this point ? 
  you should tell your friend to reveal what she knows about lowry . 
  she has nothing to worry about as sadly nothing will happen to lowry as a result of it . 
  even if there were highly incriminating evidence , [ such as a recording of lowry misleading the tribunal , ] ( http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/if-that-comes-out-im-ruined-lowry-29090809.html ) nothing will be done unfortunately . 
  lad , can we keep the discussion here to the article , rather than take a swipe against sf supporters ( of which i am not one ) . 
  ** edit : ** talking about the bigger issue ( which this article relates to ) is perfectly fine too . 
  wow , bravo on a great list !, 
  i am glad people are interested in occitan . 
  is the rise in support for sf a victory for republicanism as adams said ? 
  or does it have to do with austerity , the financial crisis and their many manifestations ( water charges , unemployment etc. 
  the al-nusra front ( the al qaeda group ) in syria is as well . 
  the saudis and qatar are funding it through the `` army of conquest . '', 
  if you are talking about eu countries then slovakia , greece and romania do n't recognise it either . 
  there are european countries outside the eu that also do n't recognise it . 
  i know people who have worked for him as well as people who had worked for the conference centre hosting the websummit . 
  they say that he was incredibly rude to staff and difficult to work for . 
  their comments , together with his self-important e-mail to the taoiseach asking him to sort out wifi for the summit , have led me to 100 percent agree with you . 
  what ? 
  i 've never heard of that before . 
  the guy definitely seems to have some psychopathic tendencies and should be put in a mental institution in my opinion . 
  that way he might get some treatment since he 'll be out in 3 years . 
  i 'd agree given that it is effectively a pro-cyclical economic policy . 
  they are not all adults who have done this to themselves and responsible for their own actions . 
  i 'd be very concerned for the children growing up in such surroundings . 
  you would have to admire the nerve of the guy if he were n't a corrupt bastard . 
  that very tribunal found he had taken payments from denis o'brien to help him get the esat license . 
  apart from the fact that he 's walking free , the most depressing thing about this guy is that he 'll most likely get reelected down in tipperary north next year . 
  farage is quite the slick politician who performs well on television and manages to brush off any argument against him with a chuckle . 
  but when it comes down to substance he is basically a thatcherite : free markets , reined in government spending and british nationalism . 
  for example , his party was to scrap a lot of progressive taxes , ramp up government spending and carry out billions of cuts to the public sector over there . 
  those ideas helped lead to the economic crash in the uk and also significantly antagonized ( for want of a better word ) a lot of irish people . 
  * edit : ** as it happens , [ ukip 's communications secretary is irish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hermann_kelly ) and was a teacher in my school . 
  the guy was a complete religious fundamentalist and published [ this book ] ( http://www.amazon.com/kathys-real-story-culture-allegations/dp/1906351007 ) about a `` culture of false [ abuse ] allegations against the church '' after he left . 
  i came across [ this image ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/stab-in-the-back_postcard.jpg ) a while ago while reading about the `` stabbed in the back '' myth . 
  i noticed that it was from austria and it got me wondering if this myth ( or a similar one ) about what caused defeat prevailed in other central powers after wwi ? 
  have you ever thought about becoming a columnist , lad ? 
  your posts are gold !, 
   however , it also notes that unification would ** create just one government structure ** and associated savings could in the long term be reinvested in the private economy or public projects . 
  is the one government structure guaranteed though ? 
  would n't unionists want some autonomy in a united ireland ? 
  correct me if i am mistaken , but were n't most of the measures demanded by the troika in ireland to do with fiscal policy and less to do with reforms ? 
   but the real power comes from the complete infiltration of the political culture by solicitors and barristers . 
  this has ensured that anytime their pockets are threatened , all party or ideological differences are set aside to fight the good fight for the protection of fees . 
  what does the author mean by the `` infiltration of our political culture ? '', 
  if he 's referring to the fact that many tds are lawyers then he is mistaken . 
  many tds are also teachers and their profession has taken a hit since the crash happened . 
  thanks for that . 
  do they normally make comments about their neighbours ' ethnicity too ? 
  almost all basques speak spanish already ( either as a first or a second language ) . 
  [ they are still reviving their language ] ( http://i.imgur.com/psqkpfn.png ) and seeking to build a bilingual society where both languages are spoken .
