  we could do the same with english and irish . 
  key to their success has been having education done through basque . 
  just under two thirds of students in the basque country get their primary and secondary education through basque . 
  a further 20 percent go to bilingual schools where some subjects are taught in basque and others in spanish . 
  by comparison , in ireland about 6.4 % of primary students are taught through irish ( no idea about secondary schools ) . 
  all the figures i got from wikipedia . 
  ** edit : ** in case you are confused by the statistics and the map , they are from two different basque regions in spain ( navarre and the basque country ) . 
  however , both are now trying to build a bilingual society . 
  a friend of mine is from portugal and was hired to translate for one of these weddings as the girl in question did not speak english at all . 
  this has attracted a bit of attention in the media over there as the groups behind it are [ charging thousands of euro and some of the women involved may have committed bigamy . 
  ** edit : ** [ here ] ( http://www.asjp.pt/2013/11/24/portuguesas-casam-por-mil-euros-para-legalizar-estrangeiros-na-ue/ ) is an article about it from the union of portuguese judges if you want to feed it through google translate . 
  anybody think they 'll be getting another letter from his lawyers ? 
  firstly , congratulations on raising a bilingual child . 
  we should be encouraging language learning as this has very positive effects on development ( as you can see in the article ) . 
  why should n't the other language be the one that has cultural and historical links to the irish people ? 
  i am not saying we should n't learn foreign languages , but i think learning irish through immersion is a very positive thing . 
  finally , i went out with a hungarian girl for a while and was even learning hungarian . 
  when i went to hungary i was told on a couple of occasions that i should n't bother learning hungarian as it was `` useless . '', 
  sure he was trolling this sub for months in the lead up to the marriage referendum , posting `` i 'm definitely voting no now '' in every single thread . 
  i have to wonder how people would view mick wallace if he were a member of a political party rather than being independent . 
  you would n't have a link to the thread ? 
  i do n't really understand what this is about . 
  thanks . 
  if you do n't mind me asking lad , how long were you in cuba for ? 
  if all goes well i 'll go next year . 
  oh wow , many , many thanks !, 
  i 'll save your reply and be in touch if i have questions . 
  came here just to say this . 
  sf and adams have defended him in the past as as can be seen [ here . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thomas_murphy_ ( irish_republican ) ) i , for one , was surprised . 
  i hope the guy is found safe and sound . 
  i 've seen too many comments about au pairs along the lines of `` we have no choice as the cost of childcare is so high ! '', 
  the fact is that in some cases not only are they trying to avoid the high cost of childcare but they are treating the au pairs as live-in cleaners as well . 
  that way they avoid taking care of the house themselves or paying for a cleaner . 
  frankly , that has nothing to do with the cost of childcare in this country but has a lot to do with exploitation . 
  also as others here have pointed out , it 's a bad idea to treat somebody terribly and then leave them to look after your kids . 
  i know a few girls from spain and brazil who are au pairs here . 
  pay of $ 100 a week is common and none of them have contracts with their families . 
  the only ones who have better terms and contracts are those who do n't live in the home , i.e. 
  child-minders . 
  i apologise for that . 
  not everybody who has an au pair is exploiting them . 
  there are some cases of serious exploitation and others that i 've come across where the families treat the au pairs on fair terms . 
  one day old account with minus 30 comment karma . 
  i think it 's fair to say it 's a troll account . 
  ** edit : ** another jewel from his comment history :, 
   homosexuality in and of itself is a creation of the pleasure culture of the capitalist west , meant to weaken men so that they can not rebel against their bourgeois oppressors . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's a troll account . 
  but just to clear things up , in the histories of spain and catalonia that i 've read , there were never attempts to colonise catalonia or replace the original inhabitants as occurred during the plantations in ireland . 
  their language and traditions were banned and there were many attempts to assimilate them completely . 
  but the way the user describes the history of catalonia is seriously incorrect . 
  catalonia is often described as the economic engine of spain , where industry in the country is disproportionately concentrated ( it 's about 25 percent of spain 's gdp ) . 
  this economic engine is similar to what happens in northern italy compared to the rest of the country . 
  like northern italy , catalonia has received waves of migration from poorer regions in the past ( such as andaluc\u00eda and extremadura ) . 
  some of these migrants were mistreated in the factories in catalonia or called derogatory things by catalans like * xarnegos . 
  * but catalan nationalists often pride themselves on this history of immigration and receiving people . 
  the second generation of these migrants overwhelmingly grew up bilingual and many of these make up important leaders in the nationalist movement today . 
  there 's a great book out there called `` basques , catalans and spain '' if you 'd like to read more about this . 
  as eu citizens the spanish ones are here legally . 
  the brazilian ones are here on student visas that allow them to work x number of hours a week . 
  i 'm not sure if that legally prohibits them from working as au-pairs or not . 
  there are some awful , awful people in this country who would accuse them of being in it for the money . 
  one case that comes to mind is hermann kelly ( the former editor of the irish catholic newspaper ) . 
  he published a book about one abuse case and then went on to talk about `` a culture of false accusations against the church . '', 
  pardon my ignorance but what is the ff stance on this or what had the ff representatives said ? 
  or was he referring to how ff handled this issue when they were in power ? 
  yes , he 's the communications officer for ukip 's parliamentary group in the european parliament . 
  happy christmas !, 
  you 're all grand !, 
  lowry will probably top the poll in the tipperary constituency at the next election . 
  on top of everything else , he just sent 80,000 cards to his constituents and the taxpayer paid for it !, 
  how depressing is that ? 
  i 'm not saying you are `` fucking crazy . '', 
  there is a difference between having concerns about the impact of immigration and being opposed to people of other races coming here/miscegenation . 
  people are free to share their views on the former . 
  but the people who fall into the latter ( and i know there are irish people who think that way ) hold racist views . 
  there are plenty of people on / r/european who fit into both categories . 
  i have talked with you in the past and remember your comments about wanting races to be kept apart . 
  comments like that are racist . 
  when you come out with stuff like that , are you really surprised then that the reaction towards users from / r/european is hostile when they come over here ? 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/32g5cv/asylum_applicants_increase_by_129pc_since_start/cqb56qe ) an example in which he says he wants the races to stay the way they are . 
  the only way that can be interpreted in my view is that he 's opposed to miscegenation and non-white immigration . 
   eg 50 % of spanish banks are co-ops with no regulation . 
  ireland had no strong regulation . 
  i assume you are referring to the [ * cajas de ahorros . 
  * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/savings_bank_ ( spain ) #collapse _ of_the_cajas ), 
  out of curiosity , what is the lagan polluted with to make it so toxic ? 
  any chance the city council could clean it up ? 
   nothing will come of this but gains for both fg and dob . 
  i do n't know about that . 
  the fact that he is being investigated by cab is yet another entry on his very shameful/dodgy record . 
  however , the pessimist in me sees that it will not damage fg 's outcome in the election . 
  too many people in this country vote based on what the td will do for them or their constituency , regardless of how corrupt they ( or their party ) are . 
  in other countries developers purposely let historic buildings go to ruin ( ie . 
  by making holes in the roof ) , so they can knock them down once they are written off . 
  this has been a big problem over in brussels . 
  do you have a source that the direct provision centres have sky/upc ? 
  the asylum seeker allowance by the way is $ 19.10 a week . 
  there are people who have been granted asylum here who have had to wait [ half a decade or more just for that . 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/breda-o-brien-many-of-those-granted-asylum-can-t-afford-to-leave-hostels-1.2138876 ) are their asylum claims not legitimate ?
