  brexit will have no financial consequences for the uk . 
  does the fact that there are sometimes security guards on the luas help at all ? 
  honest question . 
  thanks for that . 
  thanks for the swipe against people like myself . 
  for the record , i think it would have been better if the european union had n't taken steps like creating the euro . 
  for some people it really seems like you have to approve of one or the other . 
  is it not possible to condemn both russian and american interventions or even invasions of other countries ? 
  that , in my opinion , is the most consistent approach in my opinion . 
   america are afraid of russia getting more power because america wants to bully everyone else . 
  russia does n't want to bully people ? 
  russia has been sending troops and weapons into ukraine for some time now to bully the legitimate government there , has it not ? 
  russia has been violating the airspace of neutral countries like sweden/finland while also doing the same to former soviet republics like the baltics . 
  russia is the one claiming self-determination for regions of ukraine while completely suppressing it at home ( sometimes violently ) . 
  i condemn us imperialism and its foreign policy . 
  but many people , particularly on the left , appear to be conspicuously silent when it comes to russian aggression or [ even defend it .

  good luck lad . 
  a close family member was a serious alcoholic and he missed out on a lot of things during those years because of it . 
  however , he managed to break the habit and has achieved some incredible things since . 
  so chin up lad , you got this . 
  during the celtic tiger years those same motorways were heavily invested in . 
  i do n't know if the same can be said about irish rail . 
  that said , i do n't really see the point of keeping irish rail if it 's not really providing a service that people use but rather is just keeping people in employment . 
  the millions that it receives could be spent elsewhere . 
   a bunch of italians trying to speak spanish . 
  yes , trade with the republic is far more important to exporters in the north than northern ireland is for irish exporters . 
  the esri confirmed the same [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.esri.ie/pubs/rs48.pdf ) the economy of the north would be hit hard by the consequences of a hard brexit . 
  would you like to point out some of the anti-russia leaks that assange has published ? 
  a quick google search revealed nothing . 
  irishman here with american roots ( a reverse irish-american if you will ) . 
  where abouts in the states did you live ? 
  to be honest , there is and has been a social safety net over there . 
  there are things like social housing , health insurance for the elderly and some assistance for those on low incomes . 
  but it is nowhere near as comprehensive or as effective as it is in many parts of europe . 
  the gulf between the rich and poor is stark , particularly given that it is the richest country in the world . 
  i lived over there for long enough to have a vote and voted this time to stop trump . 
  however , i think people outside the country need to consider that people might have voted for him based only on some of his policies but not all . 
  his anti-globalisation stance , protectionism , talk about bringing jobs back from mexico/china had a big appeal for many working class voters who traditionally voted democrat . 
  trump won in many states of the `` rust belt '' that previously voted democrat but have been decline for a long time , in part because factories have relocated to other countries . 
  trump 's message about standing up to the corporations to bring those jobs home appears to have been very effective there . 
  where were you visiting us from op ? 
  in any case , good job on the video !, 
  the far-left in ireland and the u.k. spent a good part of the last decade pointing to venezuela ( or the turn to socialism there ) as a successful example to follow . 
  is n't it funny how they are not talking about it anymore ? 
  out of curiosity , what country are you from ? 
  i agree in that / r/the _ donald seems to fuel a lot of brigading on other parts of reddit . 
  it reminds me of what it was like when / r/european was around and those guys used to come to this sub . 
  i mean , sometimes it says in the title of the post `` get this to the front page ! '' . 
  they are n't even hiding the brigading from / r/the _ donald . 
  the economist had a piece on this recently , focusing on fox news . 
  opinion appears to be more valued from viewers than fact , attracting higher ratings and viewers . 
  the people who watch things like fox are generally old ( the average age is 65 ) and i ca n't help but think that they 're set in their ways/don ' t want their worldview challenged . 
  it 's ironic though that the alt-right movements argue that the `` mainstream media '' is heavily biased/untrustworthy , but then get their news from places like breitbart and the `` hillary for jail '' facebook page . 
  it 's not just people who were attached to the batista regime , but people whose families lost their businesses ( including private land , and industrial facilities ) when they were nationalised . 
  many were and are very embittered as a result and strongly oppose the regime . 
  i do n't know a lot about the cuban revolution , but was fulgencio batista really a fascist ? 
  what pro-jihadista propaganda is being pumped out on our screens by the western media ? 
  i do n't recall seeing any jihadist propaganda and from what i 've read most jihadist propaganda seems to reach its target audience over the internet . 
  unless you are referring to the western media 's bias towards the rebel groups , which is another matter . 
  this is using data from a year ago ( november 2015 ) , so it might have changed a bit since then . 
  you can see the same data in a different format [ here . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/articles/euro/2015-11-06-eurobarometer_en.htm ), 
  also , they seem to have forgotten greece in this graph . 
  surprisingly , greece was above the eurozone average . 
  i think i crossed paths with you on one of those threads . 
  there were people suddenly popping up on / r/ireland when migration came up with usernames like `` americans are untermensch '' ( americans are subhuman ) or others who referred to black people as animals . 
  yes , i often find that this sub is left-wing ** but ** most people are willing to argue with you or enter into a discussion with you . 
  but i think what / u/tigernmas is talking about is the of users from far-right subreddits that have a strong racist tinge ( as was the case with / r/european ) suddenly popping up on / r/ireland . 
  this only a small point based on what you wrote but irish is not the `` native tongue/language '' of the vast majority of irish people . 
  you often hear people describe it using those words , but the actual definition means something different :, 
   the language which a person has grown up speaking from early childhood . 
  i guess what irish people mean to say by `` native '' is that it is the language that is historically spoken by us . 
  you 're welcome . 
  you 're all grand !, 
  i wonder if they are doing medical exams to determine their age or how they are discovering that these people have lied about their identities . 
  would it not be easy to reduce these emissions per kilowatt hour by switching to natural gas instead of coal ? 
  why do you find her an odious individual ? 
  i disagree with many of her views but i also do n't know much about her . 
   the reddit altright community state that they are foremost a pro-white group . 
  in my opinion , i do n't see much of a different from organisations/movements that seek to advance the goals of a particular group ( such as whites in the us ) from the organisations that already exist for other ethnic groups . 
  such organisations have existed for quite some time and often urge the group they aim to represent to vote * en masse * for a particular candidate/platform . 
  the main difference i see is that whites in the us have had a hegemony of political and economic power for a large part of the country 's history and are not a discriminated minority . 
  that said , the demographics of the country are changing rapidly ( whites are a minority in states like california ) . 
  why should there be movements/organisations that represent blacks/latinos/etc . 
  in california and not whites ? 
  for the record , i am not a supporter of the alt-right , disagree with its positions and struggle to look at its subreddits without cringing . 
  i asked a question a while back [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/29b6qc/ladies_and_gents_if_you_could_recommend_one_book/ ) asking / r/ireland about books they 'd recommend . 
  if you are looking for suggestions for the book club , there 's plenty there . 
  i 'm curious about what that comment said now . 
  it 's been deleted . 
  it 's curious that these americans do n't like ireland because of tax avoidance , but then vote * en masse * for somebody who has avoided paying federal taxes at all in the country in which he lives for the last two decades . 
  how well did labour going into coalition with fg work out for labour ? 
  the party has been decimated . 
  fair dues to you . 
  i did that for two years while doing a postgrad and found it very tough . 
  good luck to you !, 
  they have been doing this for some time now . 
  the former editor of the irish catholic newspaper , hermann kelly , attacked the victims of child sexual abuse by members of religious orders and claimed there was a `` culture of false allegations against the catholic church . '',
