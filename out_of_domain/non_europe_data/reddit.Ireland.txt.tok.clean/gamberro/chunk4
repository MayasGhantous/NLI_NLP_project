  i agree . 
  i 'm afraid that come the next election , ff are likely to be back in power . 
  given that they are a typical `` catch-all party '' , they 'll be particularly reluctant to dealing with this issue or alienating even part of their support base . 
  i 'm a fan of benny 's , so perhaps i should n't be writing anything here . 
  what i will say is that nobody 's perfect and so some of the criticism directed against him with regards his previous mission ( s ) seems unnecessarily harsh . 
  like him or not , he does a good job in getting people out there speaking languages and especially after arabic or mandarin , people are more likely to do so . 
  really ? 
  as spanish is the only language i 've really progressed in i 'd like to know what you mean . 
  because honestly , his spanish sounds pretty good to me . 
  while you have a point , so does benny . 
  the quality of this subreddit is far better when it 's just about language learning and we all contribute to help each other out . 
  i , for one , will make a conscious effort to do more on that front . 
  ** edit ** i posted this twice for some reason , so i deleted one of them . 
  very good post and thanks to the op for posting this as i 'm also interested in chinese . 
  out of curiosity , has anybody here tried `` complete chinese '' or the michel thomas ' chinese materials ? 
  i 'd like to know if they 're worth my while . 
  thanks again !, 
   as opposed to chinese which is primarily spoken by immigrants , and in asia , and i believe at that mainly east asia . 
  true , but varieties of chinese are also spoken among the well-established chinese diaspora in singapore , malaysia , indonesia and elsewhere . 
  what i want to say is that these cultural links are likely to increase the spread of chinese in south east asia and not just in east asia . 
  there is an interesting [ article here ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17105569 ) on the topic of chinese vs. english if anybody is interested . 
  i do n't know if this is what you mean , as you probably know this already , but you can often tell by the endings of the word whether they are masculine or feminine . 
  there are quite a few exceptions , of course . 
  about.com has an entry that might help you with that , although i 'd recommend [ this book ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/french-grammar-usage-reference-grammars/dp/0658017985/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1358890812&amp;sr=1-1 ) as a reference for grammar . 
  sorry , but you can not compare catalonia to the faroe islands , aland islands or most of the other examples in your post . 
  the first two are small , both in terms of geography , population ( they both have less than 50,000 people ) and gdp , so that autonomy is relatively easily accommodated within the framework of a larger state . 
  meanwhile catalonia has 7.5 million people and also one of the wealthiest regions in all of spain . 
  accommodating that in a framework that is not based on a confederation ( like in switzerland ) can only be done by devolving powers to regional governments as successive governments have done . 
  as for the basque country , that 's a separate case and their rights to collect taxation simply ca n't be extended in times of crisis to places like catalonia ( as catalan nationalists want ) . 
  the basque government has the right to collect tax in the statute of autonomy , which was granted after the difficult transition period following franco 's dictatorship . 
  however , this essentially creates major political and economic differences among the different regions of spain , which is exacerbated in times of economic crisis . 
  if anything , this anomaly of allowing basque autonomy over taxation should be revised , not extended further . 
  is that you in the video ? 
  either way , i very much enjoyed it . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  not a great week for me . 
  - i managed to get through five pimsleur lessons while on my commute but i could have done much more . 
  - i did manage to start a new course on memrise and get to 325 words in long term memory . 
  - cleared my anki deck everyday . 
  ** this week **, 
  to get back on track this week , i aim to :, 
  - finish the colloquial portuguese ii book, 
  - watch two episodes of city of men, 
  - clear anki deck everyday, 
  - 5 workbook lessons ( gram\u00e1tica activa ), 
  - 3 levels on memrise, 
  exactly . 
  the problem with the taliban in both afghanistan and pakistan ( although they were two separate groups ) is that they instantly moved to shut down the few girl schools that were there . 
  how could we protect such schools if we sought to provide universal education for girls ? 
  i honestly thought it was harvey dent from batman that they 'd blurred out !, 
  i 'm not really in to the idea of `` europe as it should be '' but there is [ another map here ] ( http://www.eurominority.eu/version/maps/map-nations2.asp ) made by eurominority.eu . 
  i think it 's slightly more readable than this one and mentions a few examples that this one does n't ( like the catalans etc. ), 
  according to the very article you quoted , there are 25,000 jews in iran and not 9,000 as cited on wikipedia . 
  bare in mind that the irish times article is only from last year so i 'm a little confused by the discrepancy . 
  more importantly , however , is the fact that [ iran has a high rate of emigration ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6240287.stm ) anyway , especially among the well-educated . 
  [ wiki even has it 's own page on it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brain_drain_in_iran ) . 
  while there is substantial discrimination against jews in iran [ this article on the bbc paints ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5367892.stm ) a very different picture of how they can travel to israel . 
  good question . 
  i 'm afraid this is n't a story of reaching this level in a year or so . 
  i 've been learning on and off for about six years now . 
  i started when i went to college , although the standard was pretty low i 'm afraid . 
  after two years i could barely string a sentence together and still lacked lots of basic vocabulary . 
  what really helped was going to spain on an exchange programme where i tried to practice with natives as much as possible . 
  i 'd guess i was at a b2 level by the time i finished my degree . 
  however , after graduating my level really went down . 
  surrounded by english speakers and all the rest meant i did n't practice that often or `` level up . '', 
  i remember going on dates with a spanish girl and although i could understand her fine , i could n't answer . 
  but i 'd thought about sitting the dele c2 since i 'd first heard about it . 
  one of the reasons i probably delayed in going for it as that i had heard how hard it was . 
  but last year i made a decision to sit the c2 exam which forced me to go back revisit the grammar , vocabulary and practice speaking . 
  sorry that was way longer than i thought it would be . 
  ** edit ** spelling , i was on my phone when i posted this . 
  first and foremost , thanks for the good wishes !, 
  what i would do differently is that i 'd go for it right away instead of worrying about how hard it is . 
  for anybody else thinking about sitting such an exam ( in any language ) my advice would be not go think about it and just do it . 
  we 've got nothing to lose in the end of the day and using the materials for the exam really helps bring up your level and fill in the gaps . 
  so even if you do n't pass , you 'll have improved a great deal . 
  edit : i should say that i plan to use spanish to get a job in a few organisations that require at least one foreign language . 
  i 'm not done with it by any means , so i 'll try to keep this level from now on . 
  i know that the instituto camoes organises one for european portuguese . 
  i 'm sure there must be a brazilian one too though . 
  thanks for that . 
   i 'm going for portuguese this year while building up my french . 
  next year , i plan to start learning german . 
  hopefully it wo n't take me as long to reach this level with the other languages . 
  but anyway , i very much appreciate the compliment . 
  thanks . 
  i organised weekly sessions with a teacher on italki who ended up setting homework tasks of one sample paper a week . 
  during the actual class we would exclusively practice the oral component and she 'd later send me the homework with corrections . 
  as for writing , [ this book ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/preparacion-dele-libro-2012-edition/dp/8477119805/ref=sr_1_3?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1359824437&amp;sr=8-3 ) of sample papers printed had long lists of vocabulary as well as some sample answers that helped structure my own . 
  i also used a book to help me work on my writing and comprehension . 
  if you 're aiming to sit the zentrale oberstufenpr\u00fcfung , my advice would be to look for books like those . 
  however , since they 're pretty expensive , i 'd look for a second hand copy online somewhere . 
  best of luck . 
  you can indeed do it in america ( i was originally thinking about doing it there ) . 
  have a look at [ this link ] ( http://www.dele.org/?page=dele/registration-centers/centers-usa ) for a centre wherever you live . 
  thanks you so much . 
  i updated it to c2 earlier and i ca n't tell you how good it felt . 
  no plans as of yet , although i would n't say no . 
  i love spain and would love to see south america .
