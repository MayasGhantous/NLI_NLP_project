  my question today concerns the [ palestinian diaspora and refugee population ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palestinian_diaspora ) in the surrounding arab countries that emerged following the war of 1948 . 
  while the treatment they receive varies from country to country ( in jordan they largely have citizenship while in lebanon they do n't ) , overall very large numbers remain in refugee camps supported by unrwa . 
  even in jordan the number in camps is in the hundreds of thousands . 
  why have n't they been integrated into the population by the host countries ? 
  why has absorbing this refugee population proved more difficult than in the case of israel ? 
  many thanks in advance . 
  ** edit : ** thanks for the answers everybody . 
  i know this is a complicated subject because of the political situation but your answers are much appreciated . 
  hello there every one . 
  i was reading about slavery in spanish colonies and the difference between `` negros bozales '' ( slaves born in africa ) and `` negros ladinos '' ( civilised slaves ) . 
  my question is that how come in societies that were overwhelmingly dominated by slavery ( like cuba and north-eastern brazil ) , spanish and portuguese became the language of the slaves instead of a creole . 
  surely with huge numbers of slaves arriving speaking various different languages , the situation was n't very different from that in haiti ? 
  thanks in advance for your help . 
  / r/askhistorians suggested that i ask you guys for an answer . 
  hopefully you can help me :,

  hello everybody ,, 
  first of all , apologies if my question makes some people uneasy or offends anybody . 
  i was reading an account recently of a holocaust survivor named victor frankl who mentioned that sexual violence was n't prevalent in the camps ( for obvious reasons ) . 
  for the record , he was a psychiatrist so he had some experience of it in the army and prisons in austria . 
  but it left me wondering how prevalent it was during other historical eras ? 
  has it always been prevalent in prisons ? 
  do sources from the ancient rome ( for example ) mention it or can it be seen as a more recent phenomenon ? 
  thank you in advance .

  hello everybody ,, 
  my question here is mainly to do with colonial troops employed by the allies but feel free to give me any example you 'd like . 
  i remember coming across examples of algerian soldiers fighting for france during the war and the mostly japanese 442nd infantry regiment serving in italy , which got me thinking . 
  in light of confronting troops from the other side of the world and nazi ideology about the `` master race '' , were axis troops more hostile or ambivalent towards them ? 
  thanks in advance for your help . 
  hello everybody ,, 
  my question for you guys today refers to the so-called [ `` new historians '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_historians ) such as ilan papp\u00e9 and benny morris whose work is seen as challenging many aspects of israeli history . 
  the wikipedia article mainly refers to how their work has been received inside israel , but i 'd like to know how their work has been received outside as well . 
  many thanks in advance . 
  hey everybody ,, 
  i know i 've asked two questions but this has been bugging me for a while now . 
  as i understand it , following wwii austria was divided into four zones of occupation in a similar line to occupied germany . 
  but this policy seems to have been reversed in the austrian state treaty in 1955 when the country was made both independent and neutral . 
  my question is , why was there a volte-face on this issue when the country had been occupied in the first place ? 
  would a divided austria not have been viable ? 
  surely it would have suited nato ( and the eastern block ) to maintain control over it , rather than keeping it neutral . 
  many thanks in advance .

  i was just invited to join a group on facebook called `` democracy matters '' and stumbled upon [ this article ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/blogs/poplife/2013/05/27/democracy-matters-seanad-reform/ ) on the times website . 
  i 'd like to know what you guys think about their arguments as to why the seanad should be saved . 
  ** edit ** here is [ diarmuid ferriter 's piece in the independent ] ( http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/diarmaid-ferriter-without-the-upper-house-power-will-be-in-the-hands-of-a-tiny-elite-beyond-any-scrutiny-29300565.html ) as to why it should be saved . 
  i should also add that i am in favour of it being abolished , but would like to hear other people 's views . 
  hello everybody ,, 
  my question concerns us ballistic missiles that were placed in turkey ( as well as italy ) in the early part of the cold war as part of a deterrent against the soviet union . 
  i 'm referring particularly to the pgm-19 but i am sure there are others . 
  my question is why did n't this lead to a diplomatic crisis along the lines of what happened when soviet missiles were placed in cuba ? 
  were the soviets more interested in countering the threat than raising this issue at the united nations ? 
  many thanks in advance . 
  ** edit ** thank you so much everybody . 
  the quality and attention to detail you guys put into your responses never ceases to amaze me . 
  go ahead and post them everybody .

  hello everybody ,, 
  i realise my question appears very broad but i am curious about what mayan rituals in the shrines on top of their pyramids ( if you can call them that ) actually involved . 
  from my understanding the mayans did occasionally practice human sacrifice , albeit nowhere near the scale of other peoples like the aztecs . 
  so my question is what did mayan religious rituals in these shrines actually involve ? 
  i am aware that mayan civilisation also lasted for a long time , so for ease sake let 's focus on the classic period in one of the main centres ( such as tikal , cop\u00e1n and palenque ) . 
  many thanks in advance . 
  there was a [ similar thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1osm80/how_do_you_think_europe_will_look_like_in_2020/ ) on / r/europe recently , so i thought i 'd adapt the question to ireland . 
  do you think ireland will have changed ( culturally/politically/economically ) considerably by the end of the decade ? 
  do you think the economy will have recovered from the recession ? 
  will it be a more equal or unequal society as a result ? 
  finally and just for fun , what state will our national football team be in ? 
  will we have qualified for the world cup in russia in 2018 ? 
  feel free to share your thoughts . 
  go ahead and post them . 
  i was wondering if people had any podcasts in portuguese that they 'd recommend . 
  i currently listen to caf\u00e9 brasil , t\u00e1 falado and brazilianpodclass . 
  however , i 'd be interested in any other podcasts that you 'd recommend . 
  i 'm particularly interested in podcasts on news/current affairs in either european or brazilian podcasts . 
  ** edit ** thanks a lot everybody . 
  go ahead and post them !, 
  hello there everybody ,, 
  while i know ireland is a bit exceptional given the long-standing history of the irish travellers , i was wondering if there are any records of romani people in ireland before the 20th century ? 
  they were recorded in the uk since the early 16th century , so it 's not impossible that they reached ireland . 
  while ireland was not a primary destination for many peoples , we do have records of established jewish communities in ireland from 17th century . 
  many thanks in advance . 
  `` in the planning of a restaurant , it is estimated that if there are 12 tables , the daily profit will be $ 10 per table . 
  because of overcrowding , for each additional table the profit per table ( for every table in the restaurant ) will be reduced by $ 0.50 .
