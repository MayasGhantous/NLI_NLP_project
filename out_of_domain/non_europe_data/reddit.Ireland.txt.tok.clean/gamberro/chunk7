  is n't it past your bedtime , gregory ? 
  i agree with you to a certain extent . 
  but as a small country , i think there is sufficient reason to question the need for an upper house , especially one as badly run as the seanad . 
  many states in the us operate on a unicameral basis and so too does the scottish assembly . 
  admittedly these are n't sovereign states but the point still stands . 
  i know countries with a larger and more diverse population like belgium have also considered abolishing their upper houses . 
  conceivably this would make the law making procedure much more efficient . 
  it 's true that public consultation with regards reform would probably be the best option before a vote over whether to abolish it . 
  but given that nepotism has become associated with the seanad , maybe it 's best just to abolish it . 
  also the people who served well on the seanad will still be able to serve the people ( albeit after having been elected and not appointed ) in the european parliament , county councils , civil service and various other bodies . 
  the same thing goes for people wanting to start out in politics . 
  do n't forget fidelma healy eames . 
  it 's willie frazer , a loyalist activist behind some campaigns for the victims of republican violence ( including the love ulster march in dublin that ended in rioting ) . 
  great video . 
  if only we had snow like that up in the mountains every year !, 
  indeed . 
  dara \u00d3 briain , for example , describes himself as `` ethnically catholic '' , which would n't make any sense apart from the fact that catholicism has become a cultural identity more than anything else in modern ireland . 
  i hope you all had a good week . 
  mine went reasonably well . 
  * 80,000 points on memrise . 
  * two levels on duolingo . 
  * three units of gram\u00e1tica activa . 
  * i added my fifty words to my anki deck and cleared it 4 days this week . 
  exactly . 
  also , random attacks like this do n't advance the prospect of peace in any way . 
  i agree with you that duolingo leaves a lot to be desired . 
  i 'm using it for portuguese and i find i spend most of my time correcting problems with it . 
  memrise to be better for somebody brushing up/learning vocabulary . 
  pimsleur can also be used to touch on different grammar points . 
  i know i am late here but i was reading about korea recently and was quite curious as regards one issue . 
  do we know how many south korean and other united nations pows are remaining in korea ? 
  how long were most kept there after the war ? 
  what was the reasoning behind not returning all enemy pows ? 
  absolutely . 
  it 's not like the us where pilots and crew are truly exploited in terms of pay , but it 's not much better . 
  it looks like ireland has its own banksy . 
  about time !, 
  source ? 
  just about every comment you post is obscene and insulting . 
  try [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1bulyd/a_few_questions_about_the_current_religious/c9aesph ) and [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1bulyd/a_few_questions_about_the_current_religious/c9af0cc ) . 
  whoever you are , you really should stop ripping the piss and get help . 
  while i fully expect you to ignore this comment and keep on doing the same nonsense , be warned the downvotes will keep on coming . 
  as much as i think hogan 's travels are ridiculous , is there any evidence that he 's travelling more than his ff predecessor eamon o cuiv or john gormley before that ? 
  that would provide some context at least to put this into perspective . 
  south africa gave up all of its nuclear weapons that it had developed ( the first country in the world to do so ) . 
  they did n't have thermonuclear weapons as far as i know , but they did have an arsenal of about 6 gun-type fission weapons by the 1980s . 
  the country now only uses nuclear power for peaceful purposes . 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_africa_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction ), 
  really ? 
  you would n't happen to have a link for that ? 
  ** edit ** never mind , i just saw his twitter feed . 
  there must be something seriously wrong with that muppet !, 
  it was an alright week for me . 
  i 'm busy with stuff for work and a few other projects so i did n't do much grammar . 
  i got 80,000 points on memrise . 
  i did n't add any words to my anki deck this week , but i cleared it everyday . 
  hope you guys all have a good week . 
  cheers !, 
  i 'm not an expert so i 'd wait until somebody gives you a definitive answer . 
  however , [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/13lysa/the_tutsis_during_the_colonization_of_rwanda/c755tbu ) gives you some background on the hutu and tutsis . 
  serious mental health issues . 
  exactly !, 
  imagine poor mr. , vanderlei de lima who spent years of his life training for that very race ( with all the sacrifice that entails ) , having his one shot messed up by that loon . 
  well , as other people here have mentioned , the guy is clearly mentally ill . 
  he believes the world is going to end , which indicates a severe disconnect from reality and paranoia . 
  these are symptoms of psychosis , i 'm afraid . 
  however , it 's none of my business in the end of the day . 
  i just wish he would get treatment instead of going on like this . 
  great question , although i 'd recommend you ask the fine people over at / r/irishhistory if you do n't get any answers here . 
  gregory barnes anybody ??? 
  seriously though , michael d. would be great . 
  so would ardal o'hanlon or frank kelly . 
  i 'd like michael martin to do one , at least that way we could ask him how he thinks he could run the country better given the state ff left it in . 
  where are you off to ? 
  maybe they 'll have bacon fries there . 
  for the record , i do fine your contribution interesting but we have to be careful about getting into stuff post 1993 as per the rules of this subreddit . 
  well even british left-wing newspapers like * the independent * , which is generally quite critical of us foreign policy , pointed out that [ direct criticism of putin or medvedev is n't allowed on russia today ] ( http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1p2-25894292.html ) and that the channel is happy to advocate anti-american conspiracy theories . 
  i think the others are right to question the objectivity of this documentary . 
  then there is the other major issue of the fact that while russia has rebuilt grozny and other parts of chechnya , the person they have put in power [ has an appalling human rights record . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ramzan_kadyrov#accusations_of_human_rights_abuses ) the fact that this documentary did n't even touch on that says a lot . 
  thank you for posting this . 
  do you mind if i copy and paste this next time he gets out of hand ? 
  it 's a real shame when people new to this subreddit take him seriously . 
  thanks for sharing this . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , was there any reason why you changed your mind about irish ? 
  still here too . 
  * 100,000 points on memrise . 
  * two units of gram\u00e1tica \u00c1ctiva . 
  * i did n't add any words to my anki deck this week either but i did clear it everyday . 
  * one class with a native speaker via italki . 
  that 's all folks . 
  have a good week and keep up the good work . 
  a friend of mine was just offered a job in brazil because she was the only candidate who spoke portuguese . 
  the company is based all over the world but she was snatched up immediately just because of that . 
  so do n't worry , it 'll be well worth it . 
  michael palin 's documentaries on brazil got pretty good reviews and covers a lot of things , so i 'd check it out . 
  you might also want to check out beyond citizen kane , although it 's pretty dated and not very impartial . 
  not\u00edcias de uma guerra particular is pretty good for crime and the war on drugs . 
  enjoy !,
