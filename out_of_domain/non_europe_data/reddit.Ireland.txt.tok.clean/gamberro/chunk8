  poor horse . 
  i guess you were supporting the move to have one embassy in rome ? 
  how she could oppose such a move is beyond me . 
  i 'll say it before and i 'll say it again , the sooner we abolish the seanad the better . 
  this man has n't been elected by anybody other than a panel in over 20 years !, 
  i 'd rather if he was unemployed than putting forward views under the mask of officialdom that are n't reflective of public discourse or are completely ridiculous like in this case . 
  since this guy along with mullen and healy eames are n't elected by the people , nobody should be paying any more attention to them than they would to a ranting person on the street , i.e. 
  none . 
  the fact is that because they occupy a seat in a house shaped on 1930s catholic teaching gives airtime ( but not legitimacy ) to views that nobody else shares . 
  it 'll be interesting to see if fianna fail comes out against legislation to appeal to conservative voters . 
  as a catch-all party that basically does what is popular to get into power , that 's a likely decision they 'll make . 
  they 've already come out against abolishing the seanad . 
  they do have to represent the views of the electorate or face being ousted come election time . 
  in the meantime they are the elected representative of their constituency . 
  that 's my main point . 
  the same does n't apply at all for the seanad , so it should be abolished in my opinion . 
  let me quote [ / u/gregbot ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1d2lv0/ministers_meet_in_bid_to_resolve_abortion/c9ncgx4 ) for a second before anybody wastes time here . 
   south sudan is much better off as a free and independent nation ; it is able , at last , to chart its own pro-american , pro-western course . 
  its * own * pro-american , pro-western course ? 
  i stopped taking the girl seriously at the headline but after reading that i stopped reading altogether . 
  if s. sudan is a sovereign state , it should be able to shape its own foreign policy , not automatically assume a pro-western stance . 
  alright week for me . 
  * 90,000 points on memrise . 
  * 5 units of gram\u00e1tica activa ( i also finished the book - moving onto b1/b2 now ) . 
  * no new words for the anki deck and only cleared it 3 days this week . 
  have a good one and keep up the good work !, 
  i agree the article is sensationalist , especially the comparison that you pointed out . 
  i bet irish people will look back on this debate 20/30 years from now and be shocked at the stance people like creighton have taken on this issue . 
  the tide is slowly turning and after twenty years ireland is finally going to legislate on the x case . 
  the journalist here did n't seem to get that . 
  i can see the fine people of kiely 's of donnybrook let them film in there . 
  what ? 
  since when was the dele adjusted ? 
  surely if it was a c2 exam then it was already based on the cefr . 
  i 'm curious as i sat it last year . 
  thank you , i did pass . 
  i vaguely remember somebody telling me that the dele had changed but now that i think about it , it makes a lot of sense . 
  i found the written part ( test 2 ) harder in the older format than in the new one . 
  i think it was because they used to ask very specific things in the tasks . 
  other than that i ca n't remember any other differences . 
  anyway , thanks for the information and good luck with all the languages you 're learning . 
   sinead , our constitution , before you even start wondering do you understand plain english , takes the precept that every life begins at conception . 
  that 's just one quote but matthews really does come across as arrogant and condescending throughout the transcript . 
  i do n't think it helps his case at all . 
  was n't she the one who claimed fornication was what was causing unwanted pregnancies ? 
  i know she was the one who criticised spunout in the d\u00e1il over one page on the site . 
  either way , she clearly has some pretty extreme views . 
  hello everybody ,, 
  my question is about the use of the * pret\u00e9rito perfeito * and the * pret\u00e9rito imperfeito de subjuntivo * . 
  i 'd like to know if it is grammatically correct to use the subjunctive in the cases below :, 
  i have some brazilian friends who are nordestinos , so i do n't know if it 's a regional thing or not . 
  should n't it be `` tirou '' and `` demorou '' respectively ? 
  you might want to ask the fine people over at / r/linguistics . 
  they did a fine job answering [ my question about languages a few months back . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/17k91c/xpost_from_askhistorians_why_did_slave_societies/ ), 
  hey everybody . 
  i hope you all had a good one . 
  i 'm afraid did n't do much the week and left my anki deck aside completely i 'm afraid . 
  apart from that , this is what i did over the weekend :, 
  * 90,000 points on memrise . 
  * 3 units of gram\u00e1tica \u00c1ctiva, 
  * listened to an episode of caf\u00e9 brasil and a couple euronews videos in portuguese . 
  keep up the good work guys . 
  the bbc [ ran a report ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/8556659.stm ) on him a few years ago if anybody 's interested . 
  lock that guy up in prison and throw away the key !, 
  this question [ has been discussed ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1c2ntm/is_it_true_that_mohammad_raped_prisoners_of_war/ ) in / r/askhistorians by people who have a background in islamic history . 
  i recommend people check it out . 
  if you ca n't get subsidies for it , they 're not interested in it . 
  ftfy, 
   `` we see contraception as the root of the abortion culture , '' says mccrystal . 
  a man after your own heart , gregory . 
  indeed , bilingual education is the norm in some parts of ireland and many parents try to introduce another language on top of that . 
  i ca n't see any harm in sending your kids to an english kindergarten . 
  on another note , congratulations on raising two bilingual children . 
  i 'm sure they 'll appreciate that when they 're older . 
   i 'm not his friend or anything , but i 've never seen him post anything outrageously offensive or unacceptable . 
  are you serious ? 
  just about everything he posts is obscene and offensive . 
  have a look at [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1cgand/this_type_of_mentality_simply_has_no_place_in/c9gaz31 ) and [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1d9ig9/no_complaints_to_convention_over_concerns_about/c9o8mr5 ) . 
  he 's a troll , plain and simple . 
  would anybody be interested in asking the moderator to block / u/gregorybarnes ip ? 
  that would put an end to him and his multiple accounts for a while . 
  fair enough , i 'll do the same myself . 
  sorry again 123kij , but it 's late here and i have work tomorrow . 
  i did n't do much this week apart from memrise : 100,000 points . 
  i did also add 50 works to my anki deck and went back to clearing it everyday . 
  that 's it for me . 
  have a good week !, 
  just a side note on the article , the uk may be at the bottom of the eu commission 's statistics in terms of * foreign * languages learnt , but not perhaps in terms of second-languages . 
  for example , in places like wales ( where lots of people are bilingual ) , welsh is widely taught as a second-language but that would n't be included in the statistics as it 's not a foreign one . 
  similarly , irish is a compulsory subject in ireland which means we generally only learn one foreign language apart from that . 
  while we learn two second languages in school , ireland is similarly at the bottom of the commission statistics . 
  other than that i think the article made a very good point that we need to promote language learning and to encourage children to take over part of their learning experience . 
  ** tl : dr ** - the situation with language learning in the uk is n't as dire as the article makes it seem . 
  sorry , i forgot to answer here . 
  good luck with your language learning and hopefully you 'll make it to ireland where a few words is much appreciated . 
   however both mr dooley and the party 's justice spokesman niall collins declined to reveal whether thier own penalty points had ever been erased , or the level of points , if any currently applied to their own licences . 
  delicious hypocrisy for you . 
  thanks for sharing that . 
  unfortunately , agw-denial is well funded in europe and has the backing of a few crackpot politicians that * appear * to give it credibility .
