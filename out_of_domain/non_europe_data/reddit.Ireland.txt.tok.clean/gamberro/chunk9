  the fact that these guys have no background whatsoever in science ( or even basic high school science ) is disregarded . 
  christopher monckton is a perfect example of that , but former czech president vaclav klaus is pretty bad too . 
  cheers !, 
  any idea why so many comments have been removed here ? 
  it 's a little hard to follow the discussion here with so many comments removed . 
  * i do n't know how common it is for tds to get such obscene messages . 
  * i do n't think it 's fair to place the blame on either the pro-life/pro-choice camp as this may be the work of a few people with serious mental issues . 
  * but i do think it 's seriously worrying for irish democracy if politicians are being threatened with physical violence in this way . 
  that you greg ? 
  i know this conversation has slightly gone off topic from science itself and i hope that does n't upset anybody here . 
  i was going to say that lord lawson in the uk is quite influential in promoting climate skepticism and claims that `` net reductions in co2 emissions are trivial or zero '' from wind turbines . 
  what 's really worrying though is that this has worked its way into public discourse . 
  some fringe political parties there are repeating this and are actively hostile to wind turbines . 
  two new accounts today greg ? 
  have a downvote . 
  it was a good week for me :, 
  * 100,000 points on memrise . 
  * three units of gram\u00e1tica \u00c1ctiva 2 . 
  * listened to an episode of caf\u00e9 brasil and some euronews videos . 
  see you all next week . 
  have a good one . 
  hello there gregbot . 
  i think you need to add anti-semite to the list of things greg says . 
  if i recall correctly , he called ariel silvera an `` israeli agent '' purely because the latter is jewish . 
  accusing somebody of being an agent of another country purely because of their religious identity is , in this case , anti-semitic . 
  my economics professors in college argued that the irish are no more educated than the british and that ireland 's main attraction to multinationals was its low tax rate . 
  that was their opinion mind you , not mine . 
  however , the data in terms of [ students academic performance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/programme_for_international_student_assessment#2009 ) and [ percentage of population with a secondary education ] ( http://ourtimes.wordpress.com/2008/04/10/oecd-education-rankings/ ) shows there are n't major differences between us . 
  it 's incredible how the second the word `` abortion '' is mentioned , he suddenly appears . 
  including in this case when it 's in reference to a sleazy novel by a minister , not the actual medical practice itself . 
  well , he does frequently create new accounts to jump in here . 
  i do n't know what was said above but given how similar all his posts are , you can often tell whether it 's greg or not . 
  i see no harm in downvoting a troll [ who repeatedly posts obscene things here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/gregbot ) . 
  you should have done the same . 
  i know a chap who was in the states on a j1 visa . 
  he managed to convince these two girls that saturdays did n't exist in ireland and that we had sunday one and sunday two instead . 
   it 's very hypocritical for irish people to give out about immigrants and be hard on them , especially asylum seekers . 
  sadly , in my experience it 's not that 's uncommon to hear people doing that but i 'd put that down to people being uninformed about what it 's like for asylum seekers . 
  i could n't imagine living on $ 19 a week and i doubt most irish people could . 
  but for that to go on for over a decade ? 
  it 's really appalling . 
  a few years ago i read a piece by one guy who was living in one of these centres . 
  he said that he found irish women absolutely beautiful and would love to be able to go out with one . 
  but with so little money he simply could n't even afford to take one to the cinema . 
  he 's a [ notorious troll here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/gregorybarnes ) who routinely pops up on posts about abortion . 
  i think he even set a record for most downvotes on this site . 
  [ gregbot ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1des4a/peter_matthews_on_denying_choice_sure_were_all/c9pm7bz?context=3 ) has come up with a list of things he has said . 
  simply put , do n't waste your time with this chap , ` tis a glorious day outside . 
  the current pm [ caused a small diplomatic row ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king_david_hotel_bombing#60th_anniversary_controversy ) by attending an event commemorating a terrorist attack by the irgun during the british mandate . 
  he 's talking about [ former pm ariel sharon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ariel_sharon#unit_101 ) . 
  hello everybody ,, 
  i hope you all had a good week . 
  * 5 units of gram\u00e1tica activa, 
  * 80,000 points on memrise . 
  * one italki class in portuguese . 
  * cleared my anki deck everyday . 
  see you next week . 
  the parliament must produce a whole lot of paperwork anyway ( it is large with around 750 meps ) . 
  unfortunately , as it is our meps do n't use it that regularly in the parliament , so i ca n't see why they pushed for this . 
  it does seem like a big commitment to create a version in irish . 
  then again , there are worse things the eu could spend their money on . 
  i hope that people do use the version in irish . 
  that 's a fair point , but they are talking about a [ `` lost decade '' ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/news/article-2209120/debt-hit-eurozone-faces-lost-decade-economic-pain-surging-unemployment-ernst--young-warns.html ) of low growth and high unemployment across the eurozone . 
  german economist werner-sinn equally talks about at [ least a decade of internal devaluation for countries on the periphery along with significant budget cuts ] ( http://translate.google.ie/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2013/03/02/actualidad/1362257899_219022.html&amp;act=url ) . 
  granted , o'toole is stretching that out much longer but unless we see a big shift this is going to go on and on . 
  thanks for pointing that out . 
  unfortunately , stuff from russia today also gets posted on / r/worldnews all the time . 
  check out what [ rationalwiki ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/russia_today#conspiracy_theories ) had to say about them . 
  ** edit ** check out what [ wikipedia has to say about them too ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia_today#objectivity_and_bias ) . 
  you would n't happen to have a link to it would you ? 
  if you do n't , no worries . 
  * edit * on second thought never mind . 
  i 'm just going to downvote and ignore . 
  at what point does he actually do his job and steer the debate ? 
  part of his job as host means controlling the guests so that everybody gets a chance to speak . 
  i saw your tedx talk in warsaw there and was left very inspired . 
  bravo !, 
  first of all , thanks for doing this ama . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , are you interested in learning any specific languages yourself ? 
  what got you interested in developing language learning software specifically ? 
  i 'm just curious as with your creativity you could have applied that to a lot of things . 
  thankfully for us you developed this free learning tool . 
  thanks for the link , it was an interesting read . 
  it reminded me of the ukrainian brazilians [ who speak a hundred year old dialect of the language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_brazilian#language_and_culture ) . 
  apparently they 're still going strong too . 
  hello everybody ,, 
  i did n't do as much as i usually do this week i 'm afraid . 
  * 80,000 points on memrise . 
  * 1 hour class with a native speaker . 
  * 1 meet up to practice conversation with a friend . 
  * cleared my anki deck everyday . 
  see you all back here next week . 
  have a good one . 
  i think biffo would probably need a lot of preparation in order to fit in a darth vader suit . 
  i know this is a detail that distracts from the issue at hand about anti-semitism but $ 7 million ? 
  i wonder how much anglo-irish paid for it . 
  in my opinion hezbollah 's military wing is better understood as a militia rather than a terrorist group , at least in the context of the middle east . 
  that said , i have absolutely no sympathy for it as it is reinforcing lebanon 's sectarian divisions rather than removing them . 
  given that the civil war in lebanon is over , the idea of maintaining a private army free to pursue what it likes ( such as getting involved in syria ) strikes me as [ dangerous to the country 's extremely fragile democracy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_conflict_in_lebanon ) . 
  simply put , hezbollah 's militia should disarm and the lebanese army ( which is composed of soldiers from all religious groups ) should provide for lebanon 's security .
