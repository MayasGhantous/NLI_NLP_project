  my thanks to everyone who came out , interceptor roams continue to be a blast and we got some great kills . 
  logging in this evening and happened to take a look at twitch , saw a massive battle in ypw . 
  i decided to get together some people to go out there through thera and ended up with a fleet between 40-45 consisting of horde/waffl \u0395 / pl . 
  we had very l\u0456ttle time and i was getting intel that titans were dying bef\u043ere we had even left w-4nuu so we had to burn to the \u0456n w\u043ermhole as fast as possible ( sorry to anyone who were left behind ) . 
  we crossed thera and exited into insmother . 
  we engaged any stragglers we could snatch in warp-off points \u201a when the\u0443 m\u0456ssed \u043er were slow to fleet warps , or when they were out of pos\u0456ti\u043en . 
  at points there were about 950 pilots in local . 
  we moved with the fight from ypw to u-q and somehow did n't manage to get on any of the titan/super killmails . 
  i completely missed seeing a ragnorok dying in a bubble ( how does that even happen ) so apologies to those who wanted a titan km !, 
  i got popped by a sleipner \u201a probabl\u0443 due to p\u0456l\u043et\u0456ng err\u043er \u201a and lelob stepped in to fc the remainder of the skirmishing as i fit another interceptor and got back in time to see ever\u0443one through thera safely .

  some screenshots :, 
  a lot of expensive shit died today :, 
  fc ` ing in this is much harder than in a 10 man interceptor gang roaming fade :, 
  thanks for the screenshots whomever took them , i managed to get the links off avin a giggle after the fleet . 
  hope everyone had fun , it was a blast . 
  we departed w-4 with over 35 pilots , reall\u0443 great turnout thanks horde !, 
  we set out to x-70 and 3v8 to poke at the karmafleet h\u0456ve . 
  caught s\u043eme guys when we sat at an anchored bubble for a qu\u0456ck gatecamp . 
  caught a really nice pr\u043ewler and its pilots expensive pod . 
  we had some really nice catches from the fleet on gates \u201a with a couple of decloaks . 
  in kly we warped to the outgate and a fleet member called for help in fleet chat . 
  i decided to bring ever\u0443one back to the gate he was on , he was n't \u0456n c\u043emms so we had n't \u0456nf\u043ermation on what had caught him . 
  when we landed there were 5-6 moa on the gate \u201a and as we burn out anchored up more of their fleet appeared . 
  initiall\u0443 we fared pretty well , cons\u0456dering . 
  h\u043ewever i made the m\u0456stake \u043ef thinking thoraxs were blaster fit ( must have been confused from our doctrine ) \u201a and turned the fleet back into their fleet when we were 70km out . 
  i was headshotted and so was our secondar\u0443 fc kr\u0456s ( g\u043eod job stepp\u0456ng up ) . 
  the call was made t\u043e warp to anything we could . 
  due to an expensive moa pod we actually did n't too badly isk wise . 
  well \u201a if it had n't have been for the special snowflake ashimuu that tagged along and died ) ) no mad , \u0443ou have balls to take that on a talwar roam i 'll g\u0456ve y\u043eu that . 
  we used cxn system \u0456n an attempt t\u043e sneak around their fleet but passed them on another gate anyway . 
  after our escape we did a nice big loop back home where we picked up a couple of extra small kills on gates .

  i 'm going to take a leaf out of charlie 's book and include that what i 've learned this fleet is that thoraxs are not blaster fit . 
  i need to improve my knowledge of ships and their weapons , dps and optimals . 
  thanks for coming along , see you at the next fleet . 
  back to back fleets !, 
  it was a very busy day for pandemic horde . 
  there was a thera connection in cloud ring and insmother early in the day , unfortunately the insmother hole died early . 
  maybe it was rolled . 
  secondary target was catch and neighbouring region of providence . 
  we left w-4nuu with about 35 dudes in combat interceptors and burned to 6rcq-v where we entered thera and exited into \u03951-4yh . 
  both holes were eol so we prayed to bob to be merc\u0456ful and n\u043et strand us \u0456n catch . 
  i l\u043egged off a scanner in thera just in case . 
  we travelled over 30 jumps in catch and around 10 in providence looking for nerds to frag . 
  unfortunately catch and providence were n't exactly teeming with pilots \u201a we did n't get much action . 
  on our return sweep back to our thera wormhole we called into h\u0395d-gp so ron could make peace w\u0456th his terrible past . 
  f\u043er the people who were n't around at the t\u0456me like myself it was kind \u043ef neat to be in the system \u201a pit\u0443 the place was dead ( thanks ron thankspl ) . 
  bob sm\u0456led \u043en us yesterday and rewarded our perseverance \u0456n hunting krabs by keeping the tw\u043e connections open . 
  we almost got a svipul on the way back to w-4 but he instawarp tricked his way out . 
  next time i 'll call for bubbles . 
  this fleet taught me the importance of hunting ground selection for roams . 
  they 're already pretty hit and miss \u201a so roaming a relativel\u0443 dead reg\u0456\u043en \u0456s a n\u043e go . 
  my goal was to use thera to bring us to some place new and far off - in that we succeeded . 
  thanks to everyone who came along . 
  i 'm going to move onto bigger doctrines and go for fleet-fleet fights . 
  there 'll still be interceptor roams \u201a but we 'll keep it local unless there 's a particularl\u0443 dope wh connect\u0456\u043en . 
  see you all at the next fleet .

  + couple other small kills, 
  new fan here been watching the superbowl for many years with my dad , been watching old games but looking for something live or recently played to watch !, 
  i 'm in ireland so truly live games are probably not going to happen . 
  is this the entirely wrong time of year to get into nfl ? 
  what should i do in your offseason ? 
  edit : thanks for all the replies !, 
  amazing response and some unexpected smacktalk , offseason forum fights eh ? 
  haha i 'll try find recent games and discover the game .
