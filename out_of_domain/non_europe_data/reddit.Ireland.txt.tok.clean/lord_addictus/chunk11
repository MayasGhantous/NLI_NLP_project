  you 're as bad as those guys that say confidence is the only thing you need to get a girlfriend . 
  got ta love reddit 's often simplistic view of the world . 
  life can stand in the way , regardless of how much motivation and/or intelligence you have . 
  personally i have minimal confidence issues , but it still irritates me when i see self-appointed `` experts '' telling forever-alone guys that the only thing they need to get a girlfriend is confidence . 
  and while i would never give dating advice , it is a lot more complicated than that . 
  everybody lives a life of quiet desperation , whether they are aware of it or not . 
  i 'm not arguing against the fact that he is objecting to that view , but i have a problem with his solution . 
  as i said , i do n't really have confidence issues . 
  and yes , having confidence is a great foundation for doing anything . 
  but , i hate seeing guys telling other redditors that confidence is the only thing you need to get a girlfriend . 
  hey now , it does n't have an effect on anybody but themselves , so who are we to complain ? 
  source : former member of said pity party . 
  i understand where you 're coming from , but being attractive is a significant advantage in the dating game . 
  sexual appeal is very important , as much as some redditors try to downplay it . 
  and this leads to things such as the 2 step attractiveness rule . 
  it 's very easy to see where this kind of mentality has originated from , especially in the case of guys ( since make-up is n't exactly an option for them ) because improving your facial attractiveness is quite difficult . 
  you can tone up your body and improve your personality , but your face can still be unattractive . 
  and let 's not have our head in the clouds , one 's face is pretty important in determining their attractiveness . 
  speaking from a personal perspective , attractiveness would be a mid-tier quality that i 'd look for in a partner - as in i consider it rather essential , but top of the list is whether i feel comfortable enough around the person to talk to them about absolutely anything for hours on end . 
  well , when i speak of the term `` attractiveness '' , i meant visually appealing - i probably should have clarified that . 
  as a man , i 'm embarrassed by your lack of grammar and punctuation . 
  it 's an ad - an arguably fake one at that . 
  stop looking for things to be offended by or just leave reddit . 
  to be fair , all he did was exploit a flaw in the system . 
  maybe people will be more careful about sharing naked images of themselves on the internet now . 
  in your * opinion * , not objectively , right ? 
  right ? 
  although both designed to advertise children 's toys to girls , mlp is a far better show in almost every objective way than those barbie cartoons . 
  i compared mlp to barbie because that 's what you equated it to in your comparison . 
  i agree with what you 're saying fully - no idea why you 're being downvoted . 
  bronies ca n't really take issue with what you 're saying in my opinion . 
  ah , fair point . 
  i guess that does come across as quite hypocritical . 
  my apologies - sorry , i was on my phone so i did n't notice the username discrepancy . 
  being overweight does not excuse the behaviour of many of the people documented in / r/fatpeoplestories . 
  it 's just a collection of stories about obnoxious people who are overweight . 
  also , being overweight is a choice nearly every time - it 's not the same as being the member of a particular race . 
  it 's not a pleasant `` miracle '' to watch - no harm in having some dutch courage in you for the duration . 
  dude , will you stop going all over the comments in this post complaining about people who support what op did !, 
  jeez !, 
  voicing your opinion is one thing , insulting people up and down the comments is another . 
  i know - my rainmeter set-up previously used google reader to source those feeds . 
  any particular one you recommend ? 
  i 'm having trouble finding advice on which are the best replacements for google reader . 
  it 's not exactly a pleasant place to be sticking your mouth . 
  ** edit : ** i do n't even ... just goes to show how intolerant reddit is to * abnormal * opinions . 
  i 'm single at the moment , yes - but i fail to see what that has to do with it . 
  i do n't agree with oral sex for either gender . 
  what 's wrong with me having a preference ? 
  ** edit : ** would you kind people please tell me what 's wrong with what i 'm saying instead of mindlessly downvoting because you disagree with my opinion on * oral sex * . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaylord_ ( automobile ), 
  i 'm not a car last time i checked ... . 
  now i 'm a bundle of sticks ?!, 
  make your minds up , people !, 
  it does n't smell `` gross '' , but i sure would n't describe it as amazing . 
  and delicious ? 
  really ? 
  you are aware of what your taste buds are touching , right ? 
  i 'm perfectly happy with my sex life , thank you very much . 
  i do n't ask women for oral sex , so i do n't consider it a big deal if i do n't `` go down '' on the woman i 'm having sex with . 
  i never seek oral sex from any woman i 'm with - i find that equally offputting ( as in , i would n't do it myself so why should the woman i respect enough to have sex with have to do the same ), 
  thank you !, 
  i really do n't understand why people are taking what i said so badly . 
  i 'm in my mid/late 20 's so it 's not a matter of youthful ignorance . 
  i 've enough experience to know what i like and do n't like . 
  i 'll be the judge of that . 
  i have tried - and i do n't particularly like it . 
  this does n't seem to be drama as such - more like drama maybe waiting to happen ? 
  regardless , you should have linked to comments where the actual * drama * was happening as opposed to the whole thread - i had to do a lot of scrolling . 
   and yes , a feminist and proud of it . 
  and as a feminist i go where i want . 
  oh no , you 're one of * those * feminists . 
  please , you 're achieving nothing by making your comments here . 
  obviously the trick is not to get caught . 
   i did n't ask if you think this policy makes sense . 
  i asked if you will comply with it . 
  this sounds like something a dictator would say . 
  being a mod does n't make a subreddit your own personal domain where everybody must conform to your own personal views on topics . 
  but what if the moderator 's reasons for telling you to not do a certain thing are ridiculous ? 
   thus avoid hurting people . 
  wow , there must be some very sensitive people here - including yourself obviously . 
  here we see the internet tough guy in his natural environment . 
  observe how he progressively gets more angry and belligerent as he starts to list his various real-life achievements in order to add credibility to his threats . 
  yep , because you 're a realman ^ tm, 
  look at the bravery , it 's off the charts !, 
  get down , he 's gon na blow !, 
   i 'd like to meet you in real life . 
  then you just might understand what a man is . 
   if you 're lucky one day you will be a father , tell me then you do n't feel the same way . 
  well , * sorry * if i do n't advocate an eye for an eye and mass murder !, 
   you know , i joined this site to find good , decent people . 
  and i end up with something like you . 
  time to call it a day i guess . 
  funnily enough i already have that link bookmarked and read thoroughly . 
  i 'm just at the lowest point in my life so far and i ca n't really see things ever getting better if i continue as i am . 
  nothing seems to make me any way better - even therapy . 
  i just want to escape from my current life . 
  this is why i quit therapy . 
  i always ran out of things to say - but it did make me realise that i was becoming a compulsive liar as i started spinning yarns to my therapist while barely even realising that i was doing so . 
  i strongly recommend therapy , but it just did n't work for me .
