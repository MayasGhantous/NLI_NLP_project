   why would she need to get a different set of mjolnir though ? 
  her armor is one of the few things i like about her . 
  not ot , but just 2 comments on those images :, 
  ( 1 ) the fireteam majestic photo shows two of the best looking armor sets from halo 4, 
  ( 2 ) christ , i 'd forgotten how bad the art in the escalation comics could be . 
  and another side that accuses everybody who opposes them of `` hating women '' . 
   we tried to fix it last time but there were still too many bigoted old people still alive . 
  it 's possible to oppose alcohol but not hate people who consume it . 
  also , your answer only concerns extremists . 
  the scout armor is the only other set of halo 4 armor i like , besides the two in the photo . 
  while the recon retained its classic design , something looked * off * about the recon helmet when paired with gen2 mjolnir . 
  similar deal with the gen2 mkvi helmet, 
  is that really the same thing though ? 
  if a person genuinely thought you looked sick , is that not a simple mistake ? 
  so the mep 's are on our side ? 
  in the past i used to think reddit represented a comfortable middleground between 4chan and tumblr , but in recent years i 've suspected that the site has begun to lean towards the tumblr end of things . 
  this recent ban wave confirms my suspicions . 
  whether you agree with the version of `` free speech '' that reddit touts or not , it has been an integral cornerstone of the site virtually since day one . 
  now it is being slowly eroded in favour of creating `` safe spaces '' and protecting internet feelings . 
  when the likes of 4chan allow for greater freedom of expression than the arguably more diverse and welcoming reddit , you seriously have to start questioning what the hell is going on ? 
  has the site run its course ? 
  is it destined to complete its transformation from a bastion of free speech and expression to a site run strictly along the lines of sjw-sanctioned political correctness ? 
  because that 's what it looks like from where i 'm standing . 
  the feelings of oversensitive gits . 
   even 4chan is in the tumblr toilet . 
  it 's only certain boards . 
  / v / , / vp / , / co / , and / s4s / are the ones of the top of my head that should be avoided due to contamination . 
  but the ones i use do n't seem to have been tainted too badly yet . 
   than a place like 4chan where its all about hate and insults, 
  you obviously are n't too familiar with 4chan , i take it ? 
   where did this thing come from that is some kind of political correctness mecca ? 
  go to / r/tumblrinaction if you want a taste . 
  tanaka 's armor seems to be missing some plating in the abdomen/groin area , even moreso than the other members of team osiris . 
   we 've seen him use them in halo 4, 
  when was that ? 
  you do n't belong here if that 's the case . 
  that smooth black section under tanaka 's chest-plate looks quite odd in particular . 
  so , did the master chief save microsoft or what ? 
  skyline moniker was dropped in 2002 , but the gt-r is still in production . 
  was n't that bear grylls ' lastest show ? 
  give me a reason why i should n't hate it . 
  not by definition , but definitely in practice . 
  you obviously have n't met many feminists in that case . 
  ever considered that you might be making poor life decisions ? 
  are you sure ? 
  there was definitely a post here roughly 2 months ago about bear grylls having a show that had a male and female island , with the male island being far more successful . 
   but let me tell you , motherfucking shit gets boring after time, 
  not if you set yourself tasks for each day . 
  even if they are as basic as passing a level on a video game or cleaning your bathroom . 
  i can get a sense of accomplishment and engagement from small things like that . 
   and waking up alone is the worst feeling in this world , emptiness is the worst in the morning . 
  that sounds like normie talk . 
   i just do n't see how they can realize they 're not happy with their life and choose to not change it, 
  requires self-motivation and self-respect . 
  depressed or lazy people rarely have it . 
  that 's the one , thanks !, 
  looks like the lads did well for themselves . 
  while i will openly acknowledge unsc/oni/ueg wrongdoing and the need for reform , the colonists still have no legitimate mandate for independence . 
  in addition , now more than ever , the humanity needs to be strong and united . 
  ah , so we 're making baseless assumptions now . 
  my favourite game !, 
  yeah , i remember hearing that story . 
  pretty funny to imagine . 
  hardly surprising considering your flair . 
  that is the guardian to be fair . 
  anything the guardian says about ireland should be taken with a pinch of salt . 
  well i guess that 's a difference of opinion then ... 
  the way the guardian talks about us , i think they 'd prefer if we had n't . 
  anybody who downvotes that is being blatantly ignorant of the rake of anti-irish articles the guardian has published in the past couple of years , many of which were posted on this subreddit . 
  it 's a bad experience , sure . 
  but it 's not torture in the strict sense of the word . 
  anybody who disagrees with that is letting their heart rule their mind . 
  y ` see , the guardian has positioned itself as the prime left-wing media outlet in the uk . 
  however , in a somewhat unusual dichotomy , they are also quite loyal to the uk . 
  not patriotic as such , but in order to maintain their large ( and remarkably broad ) reader-base , there are very few elements of british society they can pick on to curry the favour/interest of their readers while staying true to the newspaper 's core values . 
  however , there just so happens to be an island of white people just across the irish sea that are more conservative than the uk in some respects . 
  but more importantly , they 're not british . 
  perfect cannon-fodder for an outlet such as the guardian . 
  now do n't get me wrong , i enjoy reading certain parts of the guardian . 
  but they have a bias , and they ai n't afraid to show it . 
   and anti-irish gov is not equal to ` anti-irish ' , i think if we were to take every slight against the government as a personal attack we 'd be permanently offended . 
  i 'm on mobile right now so it would be a pain in the arse to search for and link the articles , but i can assure you that the articles i 'm referring to were more anti-irish than just anti-irish government more often than not . 
  hopefully somebody else will link a few , otherwise i 'll do so when i get home . 
  correction : i 'm criticising the article based on the prejudice of the media outlet that produced it . 
  there 's a difference . 
  i thought it was primarily the unsc army we fought with in halo reach ? 
  well , i can definitely say that i did n't see that coming ... 
  i 've said it before and i 'll say it again ; oni is *** scarily *** good at what they do . 
  so , series 2 with petra ? 
  i think it would have been clearer if sully had just told ben in episode 1 : '' ** do n't fuck with oni ** '' . 
  what 's your source on that , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
   the 5c coin is annoyingly useless now too . 
  most vending machines dont take it and they just accumulate in bottles at home . 
  you do n't bring your coppers to tesco self-service tills during quiet hours to do your shopping ? 
  so we 've a choice of protagonists ? 
  any idea who corvo attano is ? 
  huh , i assumed corvo would have been dead or too old for the old assassin gig by this stage . 
  i 'm more the curious about the japanese and korean players . 
  i only know 1 premier league player from each nation . 
   this mission was fun mainly because the pelican annihilates the 6 enemies they throw at you when you use it .
