  hell , many of sweden 's `` right wing '' parties would be left wing by conventional standards . 
  why ? 
  how the hell is st. george 's flag racist ? 
  that or he gets banned from twitch for playing porn . 
  how is your gender relevant ? 
  it seems pretty pointless to me . 
  half the posts there seem to be just mocking people who acknowledge the military and technological successes of the wehrmacht . 
   jews, 
   celebrating christmas, 
  * solely ? 
  * or just in the minority ? 
  because from what i know most people that fled to voat from reddit did so to escape censorship and admin agendas on reddit - most recently those under chairman pao . 
   and more natural for you and the baby . 
  in what capacity ? 
  it 's a long time since humans lived under the sea . 
   `` there is an old adage there that if there 's too many tweets the person , the tweeter , becomes a twat . '', 
  just how old * is * twitter ? 
   also only the other day a bunch of child pornography subvoats were deleted from voat after they had their server host and paypal come down on them for it . 
  of course everyone on voat flips their shit because `` free speech '' and their `` right '' to wank over 13 year olds was taken away from them . 
  the non existant sjw boogieman everyone is super insecure about is coming down on them again . 
  two things : ( 1 ) only a small portion of the voat community gave a shit about the cp debacle . 
  almost all were pefectly fine with it being removed . 
  ( 2 ) the fact / r/shitredditsays had stuck it 's nose into the site annoyed voat users more than anything and did nothing to to dispel fears of the `` sjw boogeyman '' . 
   they want their `` free speech '' to do these things , generally the people involved in subs seething with hatred , racism , sexism , etc. 
  so everybody on reddit needs to be wrapped in cotton wool lest their feelings be hurt ? 
   if thats how you 're seeing it then you wo n't even begin to understand why these things need to be removed and cracked down on . 
  i do n't quite understand . 
  you support wrapping people in cotton wool and the creation of `` safe spaces '' . 
   also i 'm glad voat users were owned by srs . 
  if you support srs that says it all really . 
  i had hoped that the kind of people who populate that subreddit did n't exist in ireland given our tendency not to be over-sensitive and general distaste for policing the private actions of others . 
  so admitting that the wehrmacht was a capable military force makes you a wehraboo ? 
  i do n't think you or many of the people on that subreddit knows that the term `` wehraboo '' means . 
   i 've no real issue with the quotas either . 
  despite the fact that they 're distinctly unfair ? 
  that still does n't make it * not * unfair . 
  should we continue to endorse unfair practices until all the others ahead of them on your list are rectified ? 
   so that 'll be excruciating for people who only like to watch dubs when the sub of this finally comes out . 
  they made their choice . 
  long waits are par for the course if you insist on sticking to dubs . 
   i absolutely fucking hate season 2, 
  it was n't * that * bad . 
  not a patch on season 1 , but it was still interesting . 
   one girl in a sea of guys, 
  yep , that 's / a / alright . 
   but it is still not as good as what fansubs are offering for free . 
  how long will it last though ? 
  it 's become a battle of speed versus quality . 
  currently the simulcasters have speed on their side while the fansubbers of the same shows usually offer better quality . 
  but the simulcasts are undoubtedly improving in terms of quality which puts pressure on the fansubbers to improve their product . 
  and there comes a point where you ca n't improve the quality of subs much more regardless of how much time you spend working on them , which forces the fansubbers to try and compete on speed - which they simply ca n't . 
  i fear a dark future lies ahead for fansubbing . 
  it will survive on a smaller scale undoubtedly ; covering unlicensed shows , niche sub demands , and bd releases . 
  but it will be a shadow of its former self . 
   you should read the posts on srs sometime . 
  i despise the place and the self righteous superiority complexes of its users . 
   said that about voat because people who were scare mongered into `` fleeing '' to voat are most likely the *** angry white man ignoramus type *** who would jump to defend a rapist , discredit rape victims and try side with the accused , and generally have no understanding of what *** rape culture *** is . 
  quite the sjw , ai n't ya ? 
  full of sjw buzzwords . 
  yeah , i ca n't see the legal avenues ever having typesetting as good as some of the better fansubbers - at least not any time soon . 
  superior typesetting alone is why many people go for fansubs even if licensed subs are available . 
  the thing is , far too few people care about good typesetting . 
  you make a very good point . 
  but the net that crunchyroll casts may become so large that fansubbing groups will be whittled down to only the largest and most popular , which reduces the variety of subs available to fit the preferences of individual fans . 
  that said , as another user pointed out , one advantage that fansubbers will continue to hold over the legal avenues for some time to come is superior typesetting . 
   i just did n't like how every episode was super violent , guts-and-blood everywhere . 
  but psycho pass season 1 was plenty violent too . 
  it 's part of the show . 
   they could support it if they hardsubbed, 
  sorry , what are you saying exactly ? 
  for comparison , [ the average proportion of household income spent on rent payments ] ( http://i.imgur.com/himm8ur.gif ) . 
  exactly - that 's what i was saying . 
   london would do the same for the uk . 
  yeah , the post over in / r/europe is full of brits saying that . 
  london would be particularly bad though . 
  i hope it comes in other colours . 
   the thing is though that you get far more adulation than criticism , at least in pop history, 
  what sort of media do you consume ? 
   and people underrate the things the allies were good at . 
  i really do n't think they do . 
  hey , that 's not right . 
  it 's meant to make you realise how shit your own life is . 
  like looking in a mirror . 
  that said , with a / co / flair , it 's hardly a surprise . 
  modern feminism is horseshit and should be portrayed as such . 
  there 's a reason / a / is full of depressed people pretending to be little girls . 
  i 'd love to seen a picture of the stoics . 
  apparently the ancient san ` shyuum took great pride in their physical fitness . 
  is n't that an artist 's interpretation ? 
  ( albeit a very good one ) . 
  ever considered that * you * might be wrong , and not just everybody around you ? 
  who in their right mind would support debt relief for greece though ? 
  the economic domino effect would be insane . 
   i really care what people think about me, 
  not to be blunt , but is that not the crux of the issue ? 
   sjw reporting in . 
  that 's not something you should be proud of . 
   you can seal your country in tight , build walls around it and let no one in , but even then , terrorists with a mission can still attack . 
  it would certainly make it more difficult for them . 
  when compared to islam , modern christianity is * relatively * harmless .
