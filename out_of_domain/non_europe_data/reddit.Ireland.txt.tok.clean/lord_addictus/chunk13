   and that is why it is important to make that against the law . 
  but it is exceedingly easy to bend that law . 
  the paternity leave is considerably shorter than maternity leave and is completely optional . 
   someone who has gone through the commitment & pain of birthing a child has extraordinary patience , discipline , and will power . 
  it may be worthwhile to invest in these types of people over men who will never be required to experience such a situation . 
  i agree with most of what you said , but this point is just stupid . 
  also , some of the other * advantages * you mentioned of hiring women would n't actually be advantages in many sectors of employment ( e.g. 
  women tend to take less risks than men . ), 
  i agree with you 100 % , but another reason big companies abide by the anti-discrimination laws is because they can better absorb the cost of maternity leave - smaller companies ca n't do this as easily , and hence are more likely to discriminate . 
  i 'm not . 
  but other than training , a company is unlikely to incur any major costs with a male employee during their tenure - as opposed to maternity leave with a female employee . 
  well , we must acknowledge that there will be always men who want a * slightly * more traditional role in raising their child - hence the low uptake on optional paternity leave in some countries . 
   if you hire the guy , there 's just as good of a chance that he 'll want paternity leave if/when he becomes a father . 
  not true - in many countries where paternity leave is optional , uptake is either rather low or the fathers only take a short amount of time off work . 
  hey now , slavery is not even remotely comparable to the situation at hand - quit trying to use hyperbole to skew the argument in your favour . 
  hey , it 's not my choice - i would be perfectly happy for interviewing panels to be able to ask candidates about their plans to have children . 
  interviews need to be more open as it is . 
  but if you asked such a question at the moment , the interviewer would be quite likely to get in a lot of trouble . 
  i 've been at a number of all male engineering companies in my time , and i ca n't say i 've seen them suffer due to a lack of women . 
  i find that highly unlikely to be fair . 
  you do n't overcome centuries of heavily ingrained traditional gender roles such as this in a couple of generations . 
  it requires an entire culture shift , and a change in the mindset of the majority of men . 
  well , i was actually asleep - i do run on gmt time after all . 
  by your logic , the `` perfect '' female could also turn out to be terrible , since you said the male was * almost * as good , but turned out to be somebody worthy of firing . 
  because the owner wants his/her business to be successful and from his/her point of view not hiring young women may be a shrewd business strategy that he/she is unlikely to feel repercussions for . 
  decisions like that are made on an individual basis every day , and `` society 's interests '' are rarely taken into account . 
  in ireland - where i live - maternity leave is paid and can last for almost a year under certain conditions . 
  so , given my cultural context , the position of my hypothetical business owner could well be seen as rational . 
  maybe not ethical or entirely legal , but certainly not irrational . 
  you 're employing a slippery slope argument - i 'd prefer just to debate the topic at hand . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/maternity_leave.html ) a run-down of irish maternity leave law and rights . 
  i might point out that while refusal to pay women who are on maternity leave is not illegal , it is frowned upon . 
  sorry - a bit of an irrational outburst from me there . 
  just as somebody who is childfree , i do get occasionally annoyed when women who have had children say how much stronger they are for having given birth . 
  look , i held this view because i thought ( and still do ) that employers should be allowed take steps when hiring people that allow them to get the candidate that will be the greatest asset to their company , and not cost them a load of money . 
  that said , due to some of the excellent responses i received here ( which caused me actually subscribe to this subreddit ) , i have edited my post to show how i now believe there is a way of removing the incentive to employers ( or at least lessening it ) to hire men over women . 
   it is concerning that fathers do not seem to have paternity leave rights in ireland . 
  if they did , the entire basis for your view would be blown . 
  exactly - if you see the edit i made to my original post , you will see where i now stand on that issue . 
   you would have plenty of advance notice , and again , there 's not any direct cost to you . 
  is this the only concern that would favor a man over a woman in hiring practices ? 
  well , a replacement also has to be hired . 
  if you are paying the woman on maternity leave , that 's a double salary while the woman is away . 
  much easier to get caught for illegal dumping/pollution than not hiring young woman . 
  no , you do n't * have * to pay the woman on maternity leave , but the vast majority of companies do because it is frowned upon not to - it 's sort of a cultural thing i guess . 
  so in most cases , 2 salaries will be paid . 
   possibly , but i do n't see how the difficulty in getting away without being caught factors into the innate morality of the thing , which i gather is the point of your cmv , no ? 
  my original post had nothing really to do with morality - i was proposing that not hiring young women on potential pregnancy grounds should be legal . 
  but a woman is far more likely to become pregnant than a man is to incur a long term illness . 
  not sure if serious ... ... 
  also have a history of mental issues , and i do n't really care what people say . 
  guess that counter-balances your statement nicely . 
  there 's a difference ? 
   if i could get a bonus or higher salary for signing a 5 year ` no-pregnancy ' contract , i would sign that sucker today . 
  dayum , i 'd totally be in favour of that !, 
  eh - i ca n't see how . 
  a transgender person is transgendered . 
  is that not grammatically correct ? 
  it * is * silly - a person who refers to a transgender person as actually being transgendered is * unlikely * to want to offend them anyway . 
  * that * post made your day ? 
  man , you have low standards . 
  asian does n't follow the same word structure as gender because it 's technically already on the same level as gendered - in that it is a descriptor/adjective as opposed to a noun . 
  gender can become gendered , hence transgender can become transgendered . 
  it 's simple grammar - it 's not worth getting worked up about . 
   many of do undergo sex reassignment surgery so we can have our identities validated by the government + to cure dysphoria . 
  so , some trangendered people would prefer to remain in the body they do n't feel they belong in yet be recongnised by the government as the opposite gender ? 
  from a purely administrative point of view , that would never work . 
  no , i 'm referring to the transgendered people that apparently exist who have no desire to undergo surgery . 
  got a link ? 
  [ ] ( / trixiehat ) it probably would , but i do n't want my ploungey persona to be tainted by my depression-filled mopings . 
  and yes , the emotes were massively necessary methinks . 
  i 'm a very depressed person in reality , whereas i 'm usually upbeat and bouncy-wouncy on the plounge . 
  that said , i 'm sure there are a couple of people who would be able to figure out who i am based on my text-patterns and phrasings . 
  [ ] ( / psychiatrix ) i did n't think it would be * that * easy !, 
  man , i have to work on disguising my very telling speech/text patterns . 
  [ ] ( / trixierage ) fuck it , you 're right !, 
  i do use them far too often , do n't i ? 
  [ ] ( / trixiestahp ) i should probably delete this post then ... . 
  [ ] ( / drinkxie ) well , ( a ) i did n't think my speech patterns were * that * obvious , ( b ) i did n't give the history in this account a thorough enough examination , and ( c ) i already have too many internet accounts to manage . 
  but in retrospect , i suppose that the very fact that i mentioned that this is the alt of a plounge regular shows that on some level i wanted to be recognised . 
  i kinda wrote this entire post in a blur if i 'm honest , hence the rambling structure . 
  [ ] ( / trixiesad ) but i wuv reddit . 
  [ ] ( / sittrixie-r ) trixie means something ? 
  [ ] ( / amazingmagic ) or i 'd be sang . 
  [ ] ( / fillyflirt ) good point . 
   also , can you not use your alt to upvote yourself ? 
  ever ? 
  please ? 
  i log into this alt maybe twice a month , so it ai n't gon na happen - do n't worry . 
  [ ] ( / banexie ) i shall never remove the mask ... . 
  [ ] ( / trixiechaos ) okay , i 'm starting to think that using my alt was utterly pointless since almost everybody seems to know who i am !, 
  but thanks for the support , dude . 
  [ ] ( / x01 ) what exactly do you mean by secondary emotes ? 
  [ ] ( / x11 ) ... ... you 're the second person to pick up on that . 
  i did n't even think people read those lists !, 
  [ ] ( / psychiatrix ) you 're a dangerously good internet detective . 
  [ ] ( / x00 ) poor timing on my behalf . 
  [ ] ( / trixieheart ) honestly , you guys are the best . 
  all the people who figured out it was me are people i 'm really friendly with here , and for that i 'm glad . 
  what do you mean by `` other conservatives '' ?
