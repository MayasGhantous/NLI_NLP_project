   looking at it its not immediately obvious what the 1 and 2 represent . 
  if you look at virtually any licence plate around the world ( including ireland 's ) , it 's not immediately obvious what the letters and numbers represent unless you know how the plates are structured . 
  fortunately , we know how our plates are structured as there was publicity campaign towards the end of 2012 to inform people what the 1 and 2 would mean . 
  1 represents the first half of the year , 2 the second half . 
  it is the least complicated system i believe they could have chosen , and i seriously wonder about those who find it complicated/nonsensical . 
  good year for the avensis so it was . 
  fair point though - the system is n't perfect , but i still think it 's one of the best that could be conceptualized . 
  urgh ... ... jif people . 
  if the american version of tipping made any sense , maybe tourists would be more likely to adhere to it . 
  you 'll notice when people can understand why a certain custom exists , and that reason makes some degree of sense , that they will be more likely to adhere to it . 
  the latter . 
  no , i use a hard g - like i do with gif . 
  so , i 'm a bad person for not giving away money i do n't have to regardless of the service quality ? 
  ** edit : ** apparently so . 
  seems to be quite a few bitter service employees around here . 
  if parisians do n't want tourists , maybe they should stop promoting their city as the tourist capital of the world . 
   why would you expect people to give you money they do n't have to ? 
  american entitlement culture ? 
  american obsession with money ? 
  lax american labour laws ? 
  ** edit : ** accidentally deleted the comment . 
  but tourists provide huge amounts of revenue to the city of paris , including establishments like restaurants and cafes . 
  i 'm paying the price on the bill . 
  i 'm not demanding a meal , and then running out the door without paying for it . 
  i 'll pay the price that is given for the meal on the menu - that 's all that 's legally required of me , is it not ? 
   but just because it 's not illegal to shortchange the server and free ride on the other customers does not make it ok . 
  it 's also not okay for america 's tipping system to exist in the first place - it seems immoral and underhanded to me . 
  like any sane person , i decide whether i can afford something based on whether i have enough money to pay the price stipulated on the bill . 
  but they 're not rules if they 're optional . 
  by all means add a service gratuity to my bill ( as long as that is advertised as such ) , i 'll gladly pay it . 
  but i 'm not going to support an optional system that makes little sense at my own expense . 
  most customs make sense when you trace back their origins , no matter how odd they initially seem . 
  american tipping `` culture '' does n't make any sense and merely exists because of lax american labour and competition laws . 
  that 's not the point . 
  it 's the fact that a tip is expected * regardless * of service quality that annoys people like me . 
  tipping , while rare in most parts of europe , is not unusual for above par service . 
  exemplary service should be rewarded with a bonus . 
  but i 'm not going to supplement somebody 's wages for expected services after already paying for my meal . 
   then you should n't eat out in countries where you know they have tipping, 
  who is going to stop me ? 
  i do n't mean that in a douchebag way , but literally - who would stop me ? 
  wait - what ? 
  are you under the impression that i 'm some bitter reject from the service industry ? 
  no , i 'm no asshole . 
  i 'm not exactly familiar with asian toilet culture , but british queuing makes perfect sense . 
  i 'm not british , but any culture that does n't know how to form an orderly queue instead of rudely pushing people out of the way is n't exactly the paragon of politeness . 
  and i think you 'll find that germans * do not * ignore their history and would be rather indignant if they heard you saying that . 
  i have yet to hear a solid defense from an american of tipping `` culture '' other than `` it 's just the way things are - deal with it '' . 
  raise your prices , pay your servers a decent wage , and you 'll probably be surprised to find that everybody will be a lot happier - even european tourists like myself ( i.e. 
  those who are n't cheapskates ) . 
  you seem to think that i do n't tip because i 'm cheap . 
  no , i do n't tip because i do n't believe in supporting a nonsensical system with my own money . 
  why should i blame myself ? 
  i 'm from a country where people are paid a living wage . 
  when i go to america , should i wander the streets giving money to everybody i think is being underpaid ? 
  you 're expecting me to support a flawed system that breeds entitlement and immoral business practices . 
  yet then they bitch when tourists do n't tip them ? 
  consider me ignorant all you want , but do n't try and convince me that american tipping `` culture '' makes sense and do n't expect me to support something * optional * that ca n't be justified . 
   i know this is going to command a lot of you but pay careful attention to what i said . 
  no need for that attitude , dude . 
  do you see me acting condescending or pedantic despite disagreeing with what you 're saying ? 
  i just misunderstood what point you 're trying to make . 
   asians shit into holes in the ground . 
  all of them . 
  i 'm broadly painting with a large brush because if the us can be generalized ... then all of asia can also . 
  so , tipping culture * is n't * found all across america ? 
   and waiting in line behind someone that got there before you does n't make any sense . 
  it makes sense to brits because they 've been brainwashed into having it make sense . 
  goods/services should go to the strongest/wealthiest . 
  this is what darwin , a fellow englishman , said ... no ? 
  they 're fighting evolution . 
  you agree with evolution do n't you ? 
  you 're twisting the point i 'm trying to make . 
  every country has it 's own customs and traditions , and if you understand why they exist for that country , they usually make perfect sense . 
  but american tipping culture just seems unjustifiable - even americans do n't seem to able to properly defend it . 
   and tipping culture does make sense . 
  labor costs should be determined by what it is worth to the individual . 
  this should also be tied to the overall cost of the goods being serviced . 
  when i was a server , it made sense to me . 
  as a consumer it makes sense to me . 
  it 's an incentive to the server to be prompt and polite . 
  you just highlighted the major flaw in american tipping culture : should the server not be prompt and polite * anyway * since it 's their job ? 
  many other forms of employment in america do n't have a tipping system , yet if the employees did n't do what was required of them , there would be repercussions . 
  being prompt and polite is a basic requirement of being a server . 
   foreigners may be disenfranchised because servers will hear their accents and instantly give up . 
  they know , regardless of how well they do , they 're not getting tipped because foreigners think it 's okay to not follow us customs/protocols when they 're in the us . 
  that sounds like a problem with americans not foreigners . 
  you ca n't pick and choose when you want to do your job properly - that would n't be acceptable in any other industry . 
  your point being ? 
  just saying that does n't make it so - you have to justify it with solid reasons . 
  dude , you just commented on a bunch of my comments with pointless one sentence replies - up your game or quit wasting your own time . 
  ... ... right . 
  moving on . 
  they 're justifiable downvote targets . 
  but there are many things posted here that do n't deserve to be downvoted that get crushed . 
  for example , a guy made a post a few weeks ago saying he had just bought his first 360 and wanted to get a few games for it , so he asked for suggestions . 
  it was n't the best post in the world , but he outlined what sort of games he liked and waited for the community to respond . 
  and to be fair , some people repsonded with detailed and well-thought out answers . 
  but not only did the post itself get downvoted into the negatives , but so did almost every single reply to the post . 
  shouting obscenities makes a scene - something i 'd rather not do .
