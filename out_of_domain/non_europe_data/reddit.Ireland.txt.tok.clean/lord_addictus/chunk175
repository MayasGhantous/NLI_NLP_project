  in fact , there 's very little that stands out about her at all . 
  it 's hard being an admirer of military equipment in ireland to be fair . 
  y' know , since we have virtually none of note . 
  what about the time the door fell off one of them mid-flight ? 
  and ? 
  so is everything else in the country . 
  not to mention that the ship was actually built abroad ... 
  trump running for president is the gift that keeps on giving . 
   but you need a chip and pin card to get petrol as they do n't take swipe cards, 
  i thought the usa was the only western nation that still used non-chip & pin cards ? 
  syria fucked itself up first , and then isis spilled across from iraq . 
  the usa may be partially to blame for the existence of isis , but that 's about it . 
   apart from starting isis, 
  the usa left a power vacuum that was filled by isis . 
  that 's not the same thing as `` starting isis '' . 
   and giving them all their weapons and money, 
  most of isis 's income comes from oil sales . 
  the weapons were largely pinched from the iraqi military ( much of which was given to iraq by the us yes , but that 's not the same thing as giving isis weapons ) or from the wealth of old soviet arms that litter the middle east . 
   and destroying all the countries around them, 
  other than iraq , name one other country in the middle east that the usa has `` destroyed '' . 
  you ignorance is astounding m8 . 
  afghanistan would n't technically be considered part of the middle east . 
  it 's moreso central asia last time i checked . 
  no , it armed the rebels who are fighting assad and isis . 
  so did germany and a few other countries . 
  well he did successfully guide the uk through ww2 . 
  it 's hardly surprising that they glorify him . 
  poo in the loo , and then we 'll talk . 
  thanks !, 
  just another perk of pooing in the loo . 
  so normal , non-skinny jeans ? 
  but / u/bobzer linked / r/europe , not / r/european, 
  they wo n't like that . 
  notions on this lad , hai !, 
  i find that the only people that complain about them are those that ca n't use them properly . 
  they 're fairly simple machines . 
  yeah , but sweden is practically falling over itself to welcome immigrants . 
  / r/europe is n't as left-leaning as it once was ( which is a good thing as far as i 'm concerned ) , but other than that i do n't think / r/europe has changed all that much in the last year or so . 
  what country did australia exile from the internet ? 
  why is it always the government 's fault when people get fucked up on drugs ? 
  and why does all semblance of personal responsibility go out the window when it comes to discussions in the wake of events like this ? 
  but why should hard drugs be legal at all ? 
  are you legitimately mental ? 
  seriously , i know it 's impolite considering you 're a tourist just asking us for info , but jesus christ try and have an iota of common sense !, 
  even watching the latest star wars film should have clearly demonstrated that skellig is no place for children , let alone babies . 
   does n't judge people for degeneracy, 
  normie detected . 
  yeah , but the moors and ottomans were never as successful at invading europe as the current `` refugees '' are . 
  deus vult , you heathen !, 
  people are all too quick to call * any * criticism of women these days to be `` misogyny '' . 
  the word has lost all meaning . 
  go back to facebook , normie . 
  did i say that sex for the purpose of procreation was degeneracy ? 
  ** shovel knight **, 
  spotted it for $ 10 on the xb1 store over the xmas . 
  boy is this game hard !, 
  i know everybody may not think the same , but i have only played a handful of platformers in my life , and this is really a step up in terms of difficulty once you get past the first 3 ememy knights . 
  really enjoying it though , even if i am taking it slower than i do with most games . 
  loving the music too . 
  ** battlefield 4 ( xb1 ) **, 
  did n't like battlefield 3 , but had a craving for a shooter over xmas and saw bf4 premium edition on sale . 
  campaign is still throwaway , albeit a marked improved over that of bf3 ( not hard to be fair ) . 
  enjoying the multiplayer , but struggling to understand how neither bf3 or bf4 were able to capture the magic of bad company 2 's multiplayer . 
  obviously not , and in the vast majority of teen pregnancies you 'll find that the mother and father were n't having sex for the sole purpose of procreation when she got pregnant anyway . 
  well you should know . 
   being this blue-pilled, 
  that depends - did the pregnant teenager have sex for the sole purpose of procreation while having the knowledge and means with which to raise the child ? 
  if the answer is no , that 's degeneracy - albeit degeneracy of a different sort . 
   a teenager who has safe , protected sex purely for fun ? 
  as i said in my original comment , that 's degeneracy . 
   people with opinions different to my own are always teenagers and i can therefore dismiss their points of view without contest, 
  must be nice living in a bubble . 
   unfortunately irelands voters are by and large right of center, 
  why is that unfortunate ? 
  my own opinions on the issue aside , asking this question in / r/ireland is rather pointless considering the fact that the subreddit leans heavily left . 
  i do disagree , but each to their own . 
   tfw halo online is better than halo 5, 
  fucking 343i have no idea what they 're doing with the franchise . 
   it sure as fuck wo n't be battlefront modders . 
  why not ? 
  sorry boss - wo n't happen again boss . 
  i 've seen crazier things being done by modders . 
  that 's why you always make friends with people who reliably go to lectures . 
   why does it have to be a day celebrated by the dwindling group of people who are still followers of a middle eastern cult ? 
  edgy . 
  and let 's not even get started on what the single player has degraded to ... 
   i had just texted my irl girlfriend , does that count ? 
  well lucky for you , racism towards members of your own race is impossible ( unless you 're self-hating ) . 
  ** edit : ** am i wrong in saying that irish travellers are of the same race as the rest of the native irish ? 
  are n't traveller literacy rates notoriously low ? 
  * you, 
  and thanks !, 
  and ? 
  it 's still not grammatically correct . 
  even `` ye '' would be more acceptable . 
  fewer bleeding hearts around here the better . 
   people often misuse the word racism to mean general discrimination . 
  well then they 're being inaccurate and misleading . 
  racism is a subset of discrimination , not the other way around . 
  it 's already an autistic left-wing bleeding heart echochamber .
