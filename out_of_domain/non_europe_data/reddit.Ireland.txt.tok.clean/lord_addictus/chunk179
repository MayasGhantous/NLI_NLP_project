  now , the actual level of involvement that the cira had in the regency shooting is up for debate . 
  my guess is that they were the source of the weapons - it would be quite difficult to get aks into ireland , and they look like the type that have been knocking around since the troubles . 
  the shooters were most likely the monk 's affiliates though . 
  but the monk is smart - if you read up on some of his exploits back in the day , it 's a miracle that cab were able to pin anything on him at all . 
  he knew a broad daylight assassination like this would attract unwanted police attention and that he would be the prime suspect . 
  he does n't need that kind of heat after so many years of the quiet life in spain . 
  he needed somebody to take the fall , and who better than a paramilitary organisation that has fallen off the radar in recent years but might still be considered by authorities to have the motive and means to carry out such an attack . 
  that said , the weakness in that theory is that the garda\u00ed were never gon na buy such a claim of responsibility wholesale , and the monk should have known that . 
  maybe he just wanted to muddy the waters a bit , but the cira were n't even up for consideration as the culprits behind the regency attack . 
  the garda\u00ed and anybody familiar with the irish crime families knew exactly who was behind it from the moment they heard who had been killed . 
  alternatively , the cira claim is just a desperate attempt by some lone dissident republican to remain relevant . 
  who knows ? 
   considering that gerry adams was a close associate of the late mandela , and was a coffin bearer at his funeral ,, 
  huh , til . 
   the cira thing might just be an attempt to make a jury find it difficult to put in a guilty verdict if this ever ends up in court, 
  exactly - as i said , muddying the waters . 
  it may have been another wise move by the monk after all . 
  it 's not that complicated at all if you make a few tweaks to the interface . 
  i do n't even use a 4chan extension like most people seem to . 
  why do you think that ? 
  the discussion on / a / is often far better than that on / r/anime because anonymity allows people to be more forthright with their opinions and the lack of voting system restricts circlejerking . 
  / a / considers almost anybody who goes on / r/anime or participates in the social element of mal to be a casual . 
  if you do n't know that anime is made in japan , can you really be considered a fan of anime at all ? 
  you have wisdom beyond your years . 
  eh , fujos have tumblr . 
  as long as they stay there they can do whatever they want . 
  i do n't think i could ever be the seasonal . 
  i only have enough stamina to watch multiple airing shows every second season or so . 
   ha ha . 
  casual detected . 
   there 's also the stereotypical misogynistic fujoshi . 
  wait , what ? 
  fujos hating women ? 
  which explains why we see so many comments along the lines of `` urgh , guise !, 
  why wo n't you all stop posting lewd stuff ?!, 
  / r/all is going to laugh at us again !, 
  this is why i ca n't tell my normie friends that i like anime . 
  i 'm so much better than all of you ! '', 
  and so on and so forth . 
  women of the 2d or 3d variety though ? 
  makes sense - perceived threats/competition and all that . 
  nice username by the way . 
  you 're either blind or just browsing the surface of threads in that case . 
  i * said * wisdom . 
  beyond . 
  your . 
  years . 
  too many people are unaware of that one truth in these trying times . 
  that might have more to do with the show being tokyo ghoul rather than a reflection on / a / itself . 
  that series was never really popular over there ( at least not to the extent that it was on / r/anime ), 
  yes , that would be my understanding of it too . 
   i 'm not even talking about the anime, 
  neither was i. 
  nor did i say that there was a lack of content for the series . 
  but , it 's hardly an '' / a / - approved '' franchise and i 'd wager that its fanbase on / a / is relatively small . 
  except other irish . 
  and therein lies the problem . 
  no it 's not . 
  fuck off with your well-worn tin foil hat . 
   acting slightly better than that of fair city, 
  so will it still make me want to be blind and deaf ? 
  do n't tarnish trump 's name like that . 
  you know girls who play fifa ? 
  as a fellow irish guy , i have never seen a girl even play a video game that was n't a mobile game . 
   get your head out of your arse and stop being a needlessly misogynistic twat . 
  stating facts is now misogynistic ? 
   it 's an unlockable car in the game for the xbox version . 
  any word on how you unlock it ? 
  because i * really * want that . 
   trump is less retarded than this , and he 's a sapient fucking hairdo with something that 's only vaguely shaped like a human attached to it . 
  i 'll ask you not to speak ill of future president trump . 
  ** edit : ** bernie supporters downvoting as usual . 
   girl, 
   on the internet, 
  how is that relevant to what i said ? 
  why would n't i be serious ? 
  there 's justifiable reasons for the navy to receive further investment though . 
   so obvious they did it so they can say they 're diverse . 
  well , it * is * the uk . 
   without any aspirations to do anything bigger ? 
  what good would such aspirations be ? 
  top gear fans were bemused but actually quite open to the addition of matt leblanc from what i 've seen . 
  but god do they hate chris evans . 
  bernie-cuck detected . 
  anime and video games already do that for me . 
  when things are getting better you generally call it a recovery , yes . 
  anybody who says otherwise might want to read a newspaper some time . 
  ** edit : ** because some people insist on being pedantic , you can replace newspaper with `` any reputable news outlet '' and my point still stands . 
  / r/ireland is sure showing its true colours tonight . 
   what exactly do n't you like about paul murphy ? 
  he 's a smug , reactionary , prick . 
  his policies are populist as well as being 5 years too late . 
  he panders to the working classes with promises that are unreasonable at best . 
  also , let 's not forget his `` i was elected to break the law '' bullshit . 
  makes political sense though . 
  whichever side they pick , they 'll lose a significant batch of voters . 
  better play it safe and only lose a few . 
  if i call you by what you are , what 's the problem ? 
   i do n't know make friends , have experiences , travel , have an so and kids, 
  none of that appeals to me .
