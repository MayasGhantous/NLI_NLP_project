  you can accuse practically any news outlet of being biased and/or corrupt . 
  but if they cite official economic reports , that 's about as legitimate reporting as you 're gon na get . 
   compulsory virginity classes ? 
  like , if you 're female , attractive , and post pictures of yourself online , it 's practically a guarantee that somebody , somewhere is having a wank to them . 
  revenge porn websites and the like are just that phenomenon commodified . 
  as you said , this is nothing new . 
  and frankly , very little if anything can be done about it . 
   you of course are free to believe the independent if you like , but do remember who owns it , and how they became rich enough to buy the paper in the first place . 
  i 've never bought the independent in my life ( i get it free at work at least once a week though ) . 
  but look , i edited my original comment just for your benefit . 
  happy ? 
  jesus christ , some of you people are a lost cause . 
  regardless , it does n't have to even be an irish news outlet for you to see that ireland * is * in the midst of a recovery right now . 
  oh yeah , that malarkey . 
  aw , i thought you had left for good . 
   its that they frequently post anti-refugee comments, 
  why is that inherently bad ? 
  are people not allowed to have an opinion on the pertinent refugee/immigrant crisis ? 
  beautifully said . 
  * of course * you 'd be in favour of suppressing opinions you do n't agree with . 
  ** translation : ** `` people who do n't agree with my views should be banned from this subreddit '', 
  how very mature and tolerant of you . 
  ** edit : ** i can only assume that the people downvoting me are in favour of suppressing opinions that they do n't like . 
  am i wrong ? 
  i just have n't seen you around in a while is all . 
  damn feminists , up to no good as usual . 
  it 's more of a crevasse . 
  i sacrificed hivemind resistance for more legroom . 
  i could have sworn he was fluent . 
  like , you 'd definitely assume he was if you knew * anything * about the man . 
  the rates * are * very high . 
  based on what i 've seen , urban councils setting rates far too high was just as big a contributor to the deluge of failing retail businesses in ireland over the past 7 years as the recession itself was . 
  what op meant is actually open to interpretation since he failed to elaborate at all and just posted an inflammatory title . 
  like , what exactly was his goal with this post ? 
  my interpretation of op 's post remains that he does n't like being around people who hold opinions that do n't match his own and would prefer if they were not permitted in / r/ireland, 
   and pretty much all of / a / as well when he gets elected . 
  you realise how much of a detrimental effect that would have on 4chan , right ? 
  anime is the lifeblood of 4chan . 
  they did more than laugh . 
  not at all . 
  handled the debate fantastically considering that she had 7 leaders to wrangle with . 
  far better than the likes of miriam would be . 
  yeah , it was a bit suspicious . 
  at least when the others got an applause i felt like they 'd earned it to some extent . 
  even claire got an applause at one stage . 
   sf should really let pearse doherty be the main man tbh, 
  that accent though ... 
  she really knows her stuff . 
  sure it 's all researched and everything beforehand , but knowing when exactly to bring up a relevant piece of information is crucial in managing a debate like this . 
  yeah . 
  while i was very impressed with donnelly tonight and he made me consider voting for the sds when i would n't have even considered them before , she really caught him out there . 
  she 's cut-throat . 
   boyd-barrett has been fantastic ( albeit populist ) all night long . 
  even as somebody who is staunchly anti-aaa and the like , he spoke well ( albeit loudly ) . 
  but yeah , some of the stuff he said was * very * populist . 
  claire caught him out particularly badly on the issue of mortgages . 
  he got badly caught out on the topic of mortgage payments . 
  make america great again . 
  hold on now - do you expect the long-suffering irish public to withstand the voices of both joan and mary lou in the same debate ? 
  i do n't think people realised that you 're being sarcastic . 
  he 's good at outlining policies , but bad when questioned on them . 
  claire caught him out badly on the issue of mortgage repayments . 
  using what air force exactly ? 
  that 's fermanagh 's doing mainly . 
  poking into us . 
  not with that attitude . 
  well , i 'm off to beat springfield 's record for longest burning tire fire in that case . 
  to be fair , they were only shouting over each other so it did n't really matter . 
  it was just passing through earlier today . 
  totally unrelated . 
  anon did nothing wrong . 
  his roommates deserved it . 
  is it really being a douche if the victims of the supposed douchebaggery deserved it ? 
  feels like / r/sandersforpresident in here ... 
  but the fact that i liked all the other halo sequels sorta renders your point moot in my case at least . 
  they clearly did . 
  how is he wrong though ? 
  same argument can be used with racial equality instead of gender equality . 
  make of that what you will . 
  meme magic , boys !, 
  not exactly a convincing point there . 
  is this meme magic ? 
  if the meme magic wills it . 
  really ? 
  i know he loves voice acting , but i always thought he took it up because his career slumped after star wars ? 
  well , if the sculptor is good enough , yes . 
  that song really was the background music to a year or so of my life . 
   easter sunday we will see a new civil war which will be the real 1916 centenary event, 
  should we start queuing outside the four courts now or is it too early yet ? 
   i 'm not a feminist but the counter argument is that our society has a built-in bias against women , compounded by our culture which punishes women who are outspoken or argumentative . 
  *** if *** that were to be true , gender quotas are n't the solution as people will just refuse to vote for the women anyway . 
   but because she is ugly . 
  actually i think you 'll find that it 's her voice that most people ca n't stand , which is pretty important for a politician . 
   michael martin is an exceptionally ugly man , and yet not a single comment was made about his appearance . 
  i for one spent a large portion of the last leaders debate saying that micheal martin should shave his head like donnelly because his comb-over is n't fooling anybody . 
  because we 're being told that it matters for some reason . 
  will you please stop spoonfeeding the retards ? 
   pirating porn, 
  also , what 's wrong with pirating ? 
   gender quotas are designed to cause a change in culture over the long term .
