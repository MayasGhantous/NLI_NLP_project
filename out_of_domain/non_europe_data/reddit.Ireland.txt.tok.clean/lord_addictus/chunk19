  he makes a ridiculous amount of money from those videos , so i really doubt he cares . 
  i do n't see how spending your money as you see fit in a way that does n't affect other people is being an asshole . 
  it 's not like he 's taking the food * from * you . 
  he lives in australia - there is n't exactly a food shortage over there . 
  and he consistently makes a shit-ton of money of them . 
  so , i 'd say he 's anything but mentally ill . 
  he gives his audience exactly what they want . 
  and ? 
  last time i checked , there was n't exactly a food shortage in australia . 
  and i * highly doubt * he 's wasting enough food to upset global food prices . 
  your outrage in pointless . 
  true , but to me , it depends on the scale . 
  i 'd rather they do that than just ignore the gaps and retcon the shit out of everything . 
  the supplementary media such as books and comics are very important to the halo lore . 
  well , most of the time there is n't any contradiction , so i 'd say both . 
  ... . what 's wrong with you ? 
  if that 's what awaits me , i think i 'd prefer to remain a hermit . 
  [ ] ( / trixiesocks ) the tumblr has gone a bit downhill as of late though ever since they started allowing quotes from the * plounge skype group * [ * shudders * ], 
  [ ] ( / trixihappy ) people who choose to ignore the problems this sub so obviously has . 
  also , high school life is nowhere near as interesting or serious as you think it is . 
  jeez , i ca n't believe that actually needs to be said . 
  [ ] ( / lustystare ) if i see another butt , i 'll ram a bee so far up it , its owner will be coughing up honey for weeks . 
  [ ] ( / drinkxie ) the owners of the plounge quotes tumblr have exhibited a noticeable degree of bias in recent times regarding from whom they draw the quotes . 
  [ ] ( / fetaltrixie ) so many ... ... 
   that 's why i do n't make shitty jokes about bees and water , because i understand they 're not funny . 
  rekt, 
  [ ] ( / drinkxie ) people who are too new to realise that the plounge actually was different in the past . 
  [ ] ( / seriouslygross ) but how ? 
  [ ] ( / trixieomg ) mods !, 
  plz !, 
   posts like this are no better than the attention seeking shit posts that you old folks always rant about . 
  [ ] ( / x30 ) it 's important for a community to vent it 's concerns . 
  no offense taken . 
  [ ] ( / x11 ) nah , they 're new - they love that stuff . 
  [ ] ( / fillyflirt ) as i said , we ca n't always be a hugbox . 
  also , i think you 're greatly overestimating the frequency with which these sorta posts are made . 
  and even when they are , it 's rare that they even get any attention , unless made by a mod or something . 
  and besides , we should n't be concerned about dampening to mood - otherwise we 'll just exist in blissful ignorance . 
  [ ] ( / x22 ) i 'm just trying to get a taste for what the plounge is annoyed with at the moment . 
  it 's healthy for a community to vent it 's misgivings . 
  frankly , i was also hoping this post would draw some older members out of the woodwork . 
  [ ] ( / x31 ) it 's a false existence that eventually leads to ruin . 
   some of my friends on the lounge expressed dissatisfaction at one point . 
  oooh , brothers in arms !, 
   brown_hat makes a lot of shit posts and some people complain , but i legitimately enjoy them because that 's the kind of foolishness i remember when i first came here . 
  agreed - except when he over-does it . 
  you 're a greater man than i. 
  if female , you 're also a greater woman than i - but that would n't be hard . 
  are there many of them ? 
  i could barely name 2 girls on the plounge ... . 
  except that guy with the third arm - he has an edge we can all only dream of . 
   you ca n't stop the attention seekers shit posting unless you ban them . 
  if only ... . a man can dream . 
   it 's the fact that some folk think that posting the story of their everyday lives is acceptable that bugs me . 
  do n't forget the `` i 've been away for x amount of days , i hope you did n't forget about me '' posts . 
  [ ] ( / lustystare ) i dunno - `` attack on mr clean '' does n't sound all that exciting . 
  then there 's the few that are a super-active here and insist on documenting everything that goes on in their lives , and following up every brief absence with a detailed post to farm the attention they missed out on . 
  that said , the amount of downvotes such posts receive is slowly increasing . 
  they still get far too many upvotes though for it to be effective though . 
   they consider him a god there which is part of the reason he has such a big ego . 
  yeah , we 're definitely talking about the same person . 
  bandalo 2 : spanish inquisition, 
  bandalo 3 : bandalo strikes back . 
  i think i 'm missing what other anime is being referenced ... . . 
   are n't most older members in that camp ? 
  their numbers dwindle with each passing day . 
   since when did we learn restraint ? 
  maybe that 's why even the mods seem to like him - apart from making * interesting * posts , he says what others are unwilling to say at times . 
   the continuous love overflow that we seem to get in chat threads . 
  it 's constantly `` i love you '' or `` i love this '' or `` i love everyone '' . 
  sometimes i want to banter with someone , and being loved by everyone is boring . 
   you support any football team other than liverpool ? 
  you 're a fucking idiot . 
  you made a mistake today ? 
  good job retard . 
  i 'm not going to sit around here and circlejerk everyone 's love boners . 
  beautiful !, 
  even if that liverpool bit seems a bit random . 
   also i like the way one guy has gone through this thread and downvoted every single top level comment . 
  i have my own downvoting stalker in the plounge - i 'm not joking . 
  no , there 's no official one . 
  the people are your least favourite thing about the plounge ? 
   whoa , this is just my opinion . 
  i 'm not speaking for the mods here or anywhere else unless specifically stated . 
  aw - i guess i 'll need to find out individually . 
   i honestly do n't understand this mentality . 
  i guess there 's nothing anyone can do for people who would rather complain then leave than fix a problem . 
  nothing wrong with lamenting the loss of friends . 
  that too . 
  did i ask a question i was n't supposed to ? 
  what makes you think that ? 
  not exactly old , i know . 
  but i consider it a watershed point . 
   there 's kids posting about school and i am sick of it ( which kind of was a problem for a while about a year or so ago , but has not been at all in recent times ) . 
  are you kidding me ?!, 
  if anything , they 're more common than ever now . 
  [ ] ( / notamusedtrixie ) i think i 'll use this thread as a solid example when people ask me why i think this place has gone into hugbox overdrive lately . 
  [ ] ( / drinkxie ) i recently made a post about things people dislike in the plounge - hugboxing was one of the topics that came up . 
  [ ] ( / banexie ) when people fart in my vicinity . 
  when people make a pot of tea and drink none of it .
