  [ ] ( / x34 ) what exactly is confusing you ? 
  [ ] ( / trixierage ) i know people who do it *** all the fucking time !!, 
  like , they 're not my tea bags , so i should n't care . 
  but you did say * needlessly * upset . 
  [ ] ( / trixielecture ) the constant `` i love you '' stuff , faux-positivity , and pointless fawning over each other as members . 
  an environment that has a lot of such activity is often referred to as a `` hugbox '' , usually in a derogatory manner . 
   my least favorite thing are people who have personality cults and will act like a dick to everyone not from 2012 . 
  as in , they 're a dick to people who joined the plounge after 2012 ? 
  also , as annoying as the personality cults here can be , i 've only come across maybe two `` plounge famous '' people in my time here that were dickish . 
  it 's usually the fandoms surrounding them that bother me . 
   this one time , when i pointed out a moderator was using passive aggressive tactics ( without stating whether i approved or disapproved of this ), 
  a current mod ? 
  i would n't have considered any of them having personality cults - especially since they 're mods and hence the authority within the plounge . 
   i disagree with your view . 
  mods with personality cults are more obnoxious to me than regular users with personality cults . 
  maybe it 's just the internet culture from whence i originate and how it 's different from others , but where i come from `` mods '' often have no authoritah over regular users . 
  but if the mods had no authority , how would they fulfill the requirements of their role ? 
   it is clear that the local moderators have been the subject of random , it was really bad and horribly obnoxious back in winter when they first came to power but better now . 
  i 'm not exactly sure what you 're trying to say here if i 'm honest ... . 
   if they were n't members of the community than i would be quite hostile by default . 
  well , obviously - but the new mods were longstanding members of the plounge . 
  what exactly do n't you like about the current state of moderation ? 
  do you find the mods to be dickish or something ? 
  because that 's what a couple of other users are saying . 
  yes . 
  the latter . 
  the metric system is the most glorious system of measurement ever conceived . 
   shut up . 
  things change over time . 
  grow up and get over it . 
  if the subreddit i 've grown to love is changing for the worse , i reserve the right to complain about it . 
  i 'm not going to be forced to shut up by new people and those who are all too accepting of what this place has become . 
   and nicer . 
  i guess that kind of whinging is something i really do n't like . 
  i 'm failing to see how i was `` whinging '' . 
  is that how we treat any sort of dissent . 
   a simple `` how are you ? '', 
  can be very helpful , and opens up many opportunities for a conversation . 
  but there 's * too many * of those sorts of post . 
  i 've no problem with them existing , they 're just far too frequent . 
  why not ? 
  just out of curiosity . 
   i 'm also not real crazy about users whose only schtick is to be really negative and nasty, 
  but we need those people in small amounts to balance out the effects of the hugbox . 
  so , people are n't allowed complain about stuff if they do n't actively have a solution ? 
  that seems like a flawed premise . 
   it 's just as arbitrary as the imperial system !, 
  it 's not though - at all . 
  the imperial system is random as fuck , whereas the metric system is linear . 
  [ ] ( / howaboutyou ) the two top posts in the new queue have virtually the exact same title ... . . 
  yep . 
  [ ] ( / notamusedtrixie ) half the political protests around the world ( not comparable , i know ) do n't tend to have a viable solution for the problems they 're protesting against . 
   that said , it 's only going to be locked down rarely and only for specific things . 
  like if one of the mods has a mental breakdown and wants the make the plounge into his own personal fiefdom ? 
   but protests are for the most part requesting the stopping of something, 
  i think in the comments of this post , many people are calling for the stopping of many things . 
   seriously though , given how this place runs , it would n't last long before people left or that mod got reported to the reddit admins . 
  implying the reddit admins would actually do anything . 
  [ ] ( / thebestponyishappy ) it 's begun !, 
  how were the german ones silly ? 
  also , i think germany gave the hull of their only semi-completed carrier to italy during the war . 
  what the fuck are weedwheels ? 
  ** bayonetta ** - it 's always a game i 've wanted try , but i 've no idea whether i 'll like it or not . 
  ** the orange box ** - because i 've only ever played half life 1 . 
  ** portal 2 ** - i 've played the game , but i do n't own it . 
  ** fallout 3 ** - never tried the fallout series , but if this was on gwg i 'd definitely give it a go . 
  all these are games that are relatively old too , so i live in hope . 
  ah , it appears i was misinformed . 
  that said , i could have sworn i read about a month ago on this very subreddit about an italian ww2 carrier being built from the parts of an unfinished german one . 
  also , i 'm still not seeing what was odd about the german carrier design . 
  yeah , but i try not to support gamestop when i can . 
  they have a near monopoly on the console games market where i come from , and i disagree with some of their business practices . 
  what was wrong with the console version exactly ? 
  is that not on games on demand yet ? 
  [ ] ( / notamusedtrixie ) bronycon is still going ? 
  colour me surprised . 
  [ ] ( / trixielecture ) i detect no crankiness in my post . 
  merely an expression of surprise pertaining to the continued existence of bronycon . 
  am i not entitled to that ? 
  [ ] ( / fillyflirt ) also , i got 8 hours of refreshing sleep last night , so i 'm good - thanks for asking !, 
  do n't think so , no . 
   borderlands, 
  seconded !, 
   you do n't seem very cheery . 
  [ ] ( / x03 ) is being cheery an obligation for being a member of this subreddit ? 
  i try not to be part of the hugbox problem that i tend to complain about . 
   what , in any way , shape or form , would cause bronycon to get shut down ? 
  [ ] ( / x23 ) i dunno - i 'm just surprised it 's still going , that 's all . 
  the sect of the fandom i came from never had interest in the likes of bronycon . 
  [ ] ( / notamusedtrixie ) what 's the catch ? 
  they have a virtual monopoly on second hand games where i come from . 
  their main competitor closed 2 years ago . 
   but if not being nice to people is what you say is part of it , i want to be in the group till it dies . 
  [ ] ( / drinkxie ) where have i been * not * nice ? 
  i 've been largely neutral during my recent times on the plounge . 
   th-there 's sects ? 
  [ ] ( / moi ) every fandom of adequate size has sects . 
   neutrality is negativity . 
  [ ] ( / x31 ) by definition , it 's not . 
  except the mods .
