  i have nothing against trans people , but i should not - i repeat * not * - be made feel bad for this . 
  in the exact same way that the gay community does n't make me feel bad for not wanting to have sex with men . 
  jeez , is it that hard for you to wrap your head around ? 
  ... it was a joke . 
  * twat !, 
  good thing the opinions of sjws do n't matter . 
  we could talk about it until the cows come home , but gender and sex will remain the same thing for a lot of people indefinitely . 
  definitive proof that can easily be conveyed to the average joe that confirms the discrepancy between gender and sex seemingly does n't exist . 
  psychology ( after all , that 's what it comes down to , does it not ? ), 
  is one of the most difficult sciences from which to extract definitive facts , yet sjws just talk gender and sex differences like it 's a pre-conceived fact . 
  that does n't sit well with a lot of people . 
  that 's not what i meant . 
  i said that the gay community does n't make me ( a straight male ) feel bad for not wanting to have sex with gay men . 
  yet certain members of the sj community want me to feel bad for not wanting to have sex with * transgendered person * who identifies as a woman . 
  use of exclamation marks may have implied i was getting more heated than i actually am . 
  i was just surprised . 
   yeah . 
  i think that distinction is destined to remain gender-studies technical jargon , since it does n't have much utility for the vast majority of people . 
  and even if it does become widespread , i 'd expect people would just switch to using sex-words , and gender-words would become much less used . 
  could n't have said it better myself !, 
   but it 's more than psychology now . 
  we have neuroscience and brain scans showing that trans people 's brains look like their preferred gender 's brains , not their chromosomal sex 's brains . 
  source ? 
  genuine curiosity . 
  and for the record , i 'm not a person that needs convincing regardless . 
  this is a topic i do n't have any vested interest in . 
  i just really do n't like people being made feel bad for having a sexual preference . 
  they seem to be reputable sources alright ( beats what i 've been shown in the past ) - thanks for the info . 
  #the year of our lord 2014, 
  #still courting biological females, 
   my monstrous sexual appetite, 
  [ ] ( / x14 ) also , one can not taint their waifu with * sex !, 
  op knows i exist ?!, 
  [ ] ( / trixoh ) ... ... ... wow , that may be the best use of an emote i 've ever seen on all my time on this subreddit . 
  i 'm not even mad . 
  [ ] ( / hipstertrixie ) you missed out on the bonus point since you were n't using chrysalis emotes in the comment preceding it though . 
  [ ] ( / banjo ) nah , this account is too old . 
  [ ] ( / lustystare ) do n't go lighting those torches just yet . 
  this is obviously just a smokescreen to protect the other mods . 
  methinks something more sinister is afoot . 
  ah , the first great age battle of the plounge . 
  it was just subsiding when i joined under my old account . 
  the second one was n't as impressive unfortunately . 
  plounge is made default . 
  mods jump ship, 
  [ ] ( / trixiewillreku ) / u/brown _ hat would never be a one emote profile like me . 
  [ ] ( / notamusedtrixie ) think aboout it : one emote accounts are rare enough on the plounge these days . 
  if / u/brown _ hat wanted to fly under the radar , it would n't be the way to go . 
  for the mods there might . 
  maniacal glee at the creation of a subreddit ( or even reddit-wide ) implosion . 
  [ ] ( / drinkxie ) seriously , you could probably name all the one-emote accounts on this subreddit . 
  it 's not a good way to lay low , especially if you have such a * distinctive * posting style as / u/brown _ hat . 
  [ ] ( / notamusedtrixie ) how about no ? 
  [ ] ( / seriouslyflowers ) so ... ... . i 'm * not * / u/brown _ hat ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  [ ] ( / drinkxie ) how so ? 
  [ ] ( / x01 ) did n't we get a new plounge drunk at some stage ? 
  an irish one at that ? 
  yeah , but this is n't an important issue for the vast majority of people . 
  you ca n't force people to be interested in something they frankly do n't care about . 
  you 'll have to engage in a drunken brawl with your usurper in order to reclaim your crown . 
  it 's the only way . 
   the fact i know it could n't possibly be you, 
  [ ] ( / wasthereeveranydoubt ) * reeeeeally ? 
  that 's good . 
  [ ] ( / howaboutyou ) no - drunken brawl . 
  it 's the only way . 
  but they 're saying that i * should * feel bad . 
  that implies that there is something wrong with my behaviour . 
  i know we justifiably bitch about rte a lot , but the news team does seem to have a lot of genuinely sound people and rte news tends to be one of the more competent elements of rte . 
   pull out your camera and record it for youtube, 
  can we please * not * turn into people like in america who feel the need to record * absolutely everything * ? 
   racist, 
  against who ? 
  why did italy withdraw from the eurovision and when ? 
  the bastard !, 
   if you do not value your life , to the point where you loathe the person you are , it is cowardly to commit suicide other than trying to change something . 
  what you 're failing to understand is that people with mental illnesses such as depression often ca n't muster the motivation to change their life . 
  your understanding of illnesses such as depression is flawed and is skewing your entire view of suicide . 
  i recommend that you read [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/morbidreality/comments/23or37/heres_a_few_posts_to_rsuicidewatch_who_have_since/cgz8rs5 ) that was made on reddit a while back that describes despression in the most accurate way i 've ever seen . 
   the people around victims of suicidal tendencies do n't just want to keep them alive for their own amusement , they care for that person . 
  they see the value and good in that person and they know that suicide is not the appropriate decision . 
  that 's a valid point , but in the end , a person reserves the right to do what they wish with their life - including ending it . 
  i 'm provisionally pro-choice , but where i oppose it is when the mother makes the choice on her own . 
  it takes two people to make a baby - it should take two people to have an abortion . 
  ** edit : ** circumstances of rape , abuse , and tangible risk to the mother 's life are obvious exceptions to this . 
  forgot there are actually people who would oppose the possibility of abortion in these cases . 
  ** edit # 2 : ** spelling . 
  also , what happened to not using the downvote button as a `` i disagree with you button '' ? 
  what exactly do you mean by `` it will make sense to you '' ? 
   what about in the cases of rape , or abusive partners who force their so to have a baby to make them more dependant , or one night stands where they do n't even get the details of the father ? 
  what about in cases where the father wants a baby but giving birth will kill the mother ? 
  these are obvious exceptions - i 'm not a monster . 
  i probably should have clarified that i meant in `` regular '' circumstances ( i 've edited my original comment to include this ) . 
   also , if i may ask , are you male or female ? 
  do you have any idea just what a pregnancy is like to go through ? 
  you lose control of your body , in becomes almost unrecognisable to you , it in painful and uncomfortable and you will be ill a lot . 
  you will lose mobility and may have to stop working therefore losing your income , you spend shitloads of money on supplements and hospital visits and maternity clothes and baby supplies ... do you truly think it 's acceptable to force a women to go through all of that because the father wants a child , when he could easily choose to have a child with a woman who is willing ? 
  i 'm just of the opinion that in an age where fathers are ( rightfully ) encouraged to have a more active role in raising their children and where child support can be forcefully extracted from unwilling fathers , not giving them any say on whether their child will ever be born or not just seems wrong . 
  also , pregnancy is awful - everybody knows that .
