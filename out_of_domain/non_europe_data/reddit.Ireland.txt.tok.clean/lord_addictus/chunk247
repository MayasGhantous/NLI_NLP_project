  i learnt about global events as they happened and felt like i was in tune with what was happening in the world . 
  unfortunately i do n't have the time/opportunity to watch much tv anymore and i constantly feel out of the loop . 
  for example , i would never have heard about the snowden-nsa situation or san francisco air crash were it not for / r/worldnews [ 1 ] , and even then i was hearing about the events hours after were breaking . 
  i used to use google reader to collect my news into one handy feed , but as i 'm sure most of you are aware , that is being shut down . 
  so , basically i 'll looking for some sort of app/tool/site / program/feed that will aggregate breaking news for me so i can keep up to date . 
  something i could use on my smartphone ( android ) would be handy , but more specifically i need something for my pc as that is the device upon which i spend most my time for work . 
  any advice appreciated, 
  i 've had a rough year - a combination of depression , bad luck , and poor decision-making has turned my life upside down ( although to the casual observer that may not seem to be the case ) . 
  i do n't think i have the inner strength to come back from the sorry state i currently find myself in , and i seem to be constantly self-sabotaging myself . 
  i am completely disillusioned and lack any motivation to improve my lot . 
  so like some sorta coward , i 've been looking for a way out . 
  although i sometimes wish i could just never wake up , i would never seriously consider suicide - i just would n't have the motivation to follow through on it . 
  as an alternative , i have recently become interested in the idea of simply disappearing . 
  over the past few days i have done quite a bit of research on the topic , and have taken a few basic steps to test the waters . 
  for example : most my online accounts and subscriptions have been deleted ( this reddit account is almost my only online presence left ) and i 'm doing my best to wipe my digital footprint . 
  at the moment , my interest in disappearing is hypothetical . 
  circumstances dictate that i could n't do it now even if i wanted to . 
  but it 's definitely something i 'm considering for the future . 
  it 's been 5 months now since i started on my first set of anti-depressants , and i still genuinely do n't know if they 're working or not . 
  in the early days i though i was beginning to feel a bit better , but in hindsight i think that may have been just a placebo effect . 
  now i 'm just taking them every day out of fear of what will happen if i stop taking them . 
  for nearly 2 weeks earlier this year i did without my medication as i could n't afford a refill , and it was a nightmare . 
  the withdrawal symptoms just made me feel awful 24/7 . 
  once i had got the money together , i vowed never to let it happen again . 
  to put it bluntly , i 'm not getting better . 
  my depression would n't be considered severe , but it 's still ruining my life . 
  each day that passes , i drift further from the life i once had and into a hole of which i can see no bottom . 
  i just do n't know what to do . 
  i just started a french culture module as part of my college course , and one of the films we are studying is `` lacombe , lucien '' . 
  the edition we are watching in class is n't using subtitles , which would normally make things pretty tricky since i have only 1 year of french study under my belt , but the dialect is making it more difficult to pick up on details in the film . 
  i 've found that when the lecturer actually explains what is going to happen in a scene prior to us watching it , i find the french much easier to understand . 
  therefore i am hoping somebody could provide me with a link where i could watch the film online with english subtitles in my own time ? 
  this may seem like an unorthodox method , but i do actually think it helps my french in the long run , because when we watch the film in class , which knowledge of the context in scenes , i think i will be better able to understand the spoken french . 
  any help appreciated . 
  simple question : can you drive on your own while waiting for the licence to come if you carry the certificate you receive after passing the test with you in the car ? 
  i only ask because i live in an area where traffic checks are fairly common and i have a few places to go for work in the coming week . 
  there does n't seem to be much concrete evidence as to whether you can or ca n't from what i can see . 
  any help appreciated . 
  seriously , like with both hmv ( in cork anyway ) and game gone now , i feel like gamestop has an almost complete monopoly and seem to be taking advantage of that . 
  anybody got any suggestions of places where you can buy console games that are cheaper than gamestop ? 
  ( either online or in shops ), 
  i live in a country where maternity leave is essentially mandated by law . 
  i therefore think that it should be acceptable for business owners to have a preference in gender when hiring new workers , for the perfectly logical reason that hiring a woman who will quite likely become pregnant at some stage will cost them more money and require them to hire a replacement down the line . 
  this is not the case with men , making them the more cost effective choice . 
  now , if the woman is by far the most qualified of all the candidates , by all means , hire her . 
  but if it 's a dead heat between a young male and young female candidate , i think the possibility of pregnancy in the female 's case should be taken into account . 
  ** edit : ** thanks to some of the brilliant answers i have received , i now believe that changes in maternity and paternity leave law are a justified and fair way of combating this issue . 
  my favourite solution is that a couple should both draw from a pool of parental leave , and use it as they see fit . 
  that makes it more likely for the father to take leave from work than with current systems . 
  i 've been using [ donottrackme ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/donottrackme-online-priva/epanfjkfahimkgomnigadpkobaefekcd ) for a number of months now . 
  it seems to catch and block a lot of trackers , but i ca n't be sure if it 's blocking them all . 
  on the other hand , whenever i hear people talking about extensions for blocking tracking , i hear [ ghostery ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghostery/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij?hl=en ) often lauded as the best . 
  i 'm just wondering is there any difference between the two , and is one better than the other ? 
  [ ] ( / x31 ) okay , first of all - this is the alt of a plounger who is here quite a bit . 
  in fact , given my usual plounge demenour ( except for occasional slips ) , you might be surprised to hear the following come from me . 
  but i do n't want this to be seen as a cry for attention or be seen filling up the news feed with facebook-style crap , and that 's why i 'm using my alt . 
  [ ] ( / x21 ) ever since my depression took a turn for the worse roughly two years ago , everything in my life has gone to crap . 
  not as a direct result of the depression ( it was merely a trigger ) , but a myriad of other things too that combined to rob me of everything i valued and thought i knew about life . 
  [ ] ( / x04 ) now i find myself at a turning point . 
  my depression had been improving the last few months as i made some small changes in my life , but the xmas period has proved that those changes were merely superficial and i 'm still as fucked up as i was before . 
  [ ] ( / x20 ) now , in the past i have moped around reddit and the like , whinging and whining about my predicament - looking to blame anybody but myself . 
  and that i imagine would have been my continued method of dealing with my issues were it not for a comment i received in the midst of a reddit conversation today . 
  [ ] ( / x34 ) i wo n't go into the details of the comment , but suffice to say that it finally made me realise what i was doing wrong and why my depression is n't really improving - through the use of * very * tough love . 
  [ ] ( / x33 ) yes , as hard as it is to accept that it is my fault , my willingness to accept depression and everything that came with it is the true curse - not the depression itself . 
  in fact , at times , i 'm almost glad that i got diagnosed with the illness as it gives me something to blame for everything that was going wrong with my life . 
  while my ever dwindling circle of friends was out there succeeding and enjoying their life , i was lying in bed or on the internet , bemoaning how my mental state was preventing me from advancing in life . 
  [ ] ( / x02 ) but in the end , the thing holding me back was myself . 
  overcoming depression is no easy task , and i imagine i will have it for the rest of my life - it 's part of who i am . 
  but i have to * try * and beat it - not just let the apathy it causes dominate my decisions forever . 
  even if i fail , at least i 'll know that i tried my best . 
  [ ] ( / trixiesmug ) so , in conclusion to this rambling mess of a post , either i try and improve my lot this year or settle for a life of constant disappointment and possible suicide - the choice and blame lies with nobody but myself . 
  i doubt many of you got this far , and personally i do n't blame you if you did n't - but thanks for reading . 
  the idea of making this post came to me when i was looking through an askreddit post about sex ( one of millions ) , where as usual , the topic of virginity came up . 
  the term virgin is a bizarre concept - we are defining somebody by something they * have n't * done . 
  it would be like if we had a regularly used word for people who have n't visited africa or somebody who never drove a car . 
  and what makes it worse is that it 's usually used in a negative way to insult or belittle somebody - or for a person to describe a `` shameful '' fact of their lives . 
  sex is just one of the many things humans do - i ca n't understand why we give it such power ? 
  why should those who have not yet participated in the act or choose not to have it be ostracized and ridiculed by society ? 
  why do we allow it to control our behaviour and make us do things that objectively seem ridiculous ? 
  cmv, 
  following a recent post in / r/technology , i was made aware of virtual private networks and their increasing popularity . 
  so , suffice to say , i 'm completely new to this sort of thing . 
  however , despite my research into the technology over the past few days , i am having trouble determining whether subscribing to a paid service provider such as private internet access or torguard is warranted given the relatively limited amount of use i will require them for ( the main reason i want a vpn is to mask my identity/location while torrenting because i live in a country with rather strict torrent controls . 
  other than that , i just want it for an extra layer of security while connected to public networks ) . 
  a few google searches has brought a number of free alternatives to my attention ( for example ; [ vpnbook ] ( http://www.vpnbook.com/ ) ) , but it 's hard to evaluate their trustworthiness when it comes to security and such because tech-review sites seem to only focus the paid models . 
  i would appreciate any advice on why paid models would be better or suggestions regarding trustworthy free models . 
  [ ] ( / moi ) or is there a lot more * in-jokes * amongst recent plounge posts & within the comments sections originating from *** outside *** the plounge ? 
  if that makes any sense ? 
  [ ] ( / x42 ) [ * cough * ] plounge skype group [ * cough * ], 
  anyway , just a bit of pretext : i 'm afraid i have n't watched the original evangelion series - i tried it about a year ago , but i just could n't get into it . 
  however , a friend recently recommended the rebuild films to me because he said i might enjoy them due to the faster pace and the fact that they follow a slightly different canon to the tv series . 
  so i had some time to spare over the past few days and i gave them a watch . 
  i was impressed with the first two films , but towards the end of the second one and for almost the entirety of the third one , i just became totally lost . 
  all these terms and references were being brought in that i had no idea about , and the film 's did a very bad job of elaborating on major driving plot points . 
  so anyway , the point of this post ; is there any resource online that i could read/watch that would explain what the hell is going on in the films in a relatively straightforward manner ? 
  like , as i said , i really enjoyed the first two films , and i think i 'd enjoy the third if i knew what the hell people were fighting and being angsty about . 
  also , i 'd like to have a bit of hype for the 4th film . 
  any help appreciated . 
  why is there so much downvoting ? 
  honestly , proportional to the size of the subreddit , i do n't think i 've ever seen another subreddit where downvoting of almost everything and anything is so widespread .
