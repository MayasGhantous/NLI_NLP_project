   implying somebody would n't want to be an all powerful wizard, 
  i did n't like the original eva tv series that much . 
  it had quite a few good qualities , but i found it far too tedious - i gave up on it around the half way mark . 
  i 'm considering trying to re-watch it after 4.0 comes out though . 
  the movies have piqued my interest in it again , so it might be worth giving it another try . 
  gaaaah , the feels - they 're coming back !!, 
  seriously , i 'm not exactly the kind of person who is `` in touch with their emotions '' , but angel beats brought me to the verge of tears on more than one occasion . 
  only tv show to ever do that . 
  by replying just now , i think you just proved his point . 
  when you actively participate in online forums , you leave yourself open to being hassled - it 's part of the territory . 
  you 're more than welcome to leave at any time . 
  but if somebody is too sensitive or ignorant of how to deal with idiots , then the sites they visit should n't have to change just to facilitate them . 
  if you ca n't stand the heat , get out of the kitchen . 
  the final straw of what ? 
  i was n't aware that she was being harassed . 
  i only ever saw people calling out poor quality posts , as should be done for any user . 
  you must be new to the internet . 
  seriously , you 're coming off as a delicate little flower . 
   and pointless downvotes are a pain in the hole . 
  although i oppose a crackdown by the mods , this is an issue i acknowledge alright . 
  i 've only ever seen one other subreddit that is more vicious than / r/ireland with downvotes ( / r/xbox360 in case you 're wondering ) . 
  as a person who has modded quite a few subreddits in his time , i think it 's worth pointing out that you ca n't just call for improved `` moderation '' from the mods without ( a ) clearly setting out all your requirements , and ( b ) having the support of a majority of the subreddit . 
  i 've seen subreddits fall into chaos from this sorta ambiguity and fracturing . 
  ... ... that place has gone to the pits . 
  but whether it was ever good is another matter entirely ... 
   it 's not enough just to say `` welcome to the internet '' and throw people to the sharks . 
  why not ? 
  people like you and me and countless others have done just fine on the internet with this mentality in place . 
  it 's just a matter of how you deal with it . 
  whining and complaining to the mods about every little problem is petty and entitled . 
  that would be a step in the right direction . 
  anybody . 
  such is the nature of the internet and free speech . 
  the thing is - are there other games with 3 or 8 point achievements ? 
  other than telling people what they wanted to hear , i could n't really figure out what any of the local candidates in my area were actually standing for ( or against anything except `` austerity '' ) . 
  same goes for most of the european ones . 
  i almost felt like not voting at all . 
  i think it 's a girl ... 
  that 's the dream . 
  people always think i 'm joking , but i genuinely have zero interest in sex . 
  hmm , i guess it just depends on the environment . 
  i 've never been in a fight in my life . 
  i 've never had a violent altercation . 
  i 've never even had a verbal altercation come to think of it . 
  and that 's not to say i was n't bullied - i just knew how to ignore shit and talk my way out of a situation if i had to . 
  to me , common sense is 10 times better than beating your problems away with your fists . 
   have you considered whether or not you 're asexual ? 
  i 'm pretty sure i am . 
  it took me a while to figure out though , because growing up i could always appreciate an attractive woman from an aesthetic perspective alone , which did n't make me a massive outlier amongst my highschool friends . 
  but turns out i was just misinterpreting that as sexual attraction . 
   sf doing very well ** unfortunately **, 
  ftfy, 
  true - you rid yourself of a lot of life problems before they can even begin . 
  never heard of this guy - what was he promising to the auld ones ? 
  or , in the more likely scenario , all their economic policies will fail when they realise that none of them make financial sense . 
   i can not understand how people can vote fianna fail in any way , shape or form . 
  well , if i can play devil 's advocate here for a second :, 
  do you really believe if any of the other big parties were in power during the boom times and the crash that they would have done anything different ? 
  i wonder how he felt about gay abortion ? 
  [ * looks at own comment history * ], 
  i 've made a total of 2 comments that could be perceived as anti-sf in this subreddit going back about a month . 
  tsk tsk - saying things without verifying the facts . 
  you sound just like a sf supporter . 
  make that 3 comments . 
  except kids with a dose of common sense . 
   wheelchair of course , it 's well-known that everyone with a disability is a shoe-in in elections especially if you are covering a massive constituency . 
  that blind guy that reddit loves must be going to top the poll so ? 
  this may sound cruel , but it really makes me wonder what would happen if a candidate with down syndrome or crippling autism ran for election . 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  but i just never took stupid risks . 
  i was always very concerned as a child/teenager about what my parents would think of my actions . 
  my friends thought so - or maybe they were just consistently lying to me for 6 years . 
  what was so controversial about her ? 
  is it not difficult for imgur to have a community by the standard definition of the term since it 's just a site for hosting images to be used on other sites such as reddit ? 
  well , tragedy is just underdeveloped comedy ... . 
  oh , i 'd no idea . 
  maybe he thought you did n't develop it far enough and that you just went for the soft target . 
  push the boundaries !, 
  yes , we know , everybody here hates ff - there 's no need to go on about it at every available opportunity . 
  ** edit : ** apparently there is . 
  i hate what ff let happen to this country as much as the next person , but christ lads - can we change the tune a bit ? 
  to be fair , if i 'd rang the number , i 'd have hung up once i realised what was going on . 
  i ca n't imagine what sort of person this kind of tactic works on . 
  not that i 'd be one for boy racing anyway . 
  who really cares ? 
  as other commenters have said , the principal was perfectly within her rights to do what she did . 
  i think you 're making a big deal out of nothing . 
  and what socio-economic bracket might you belong to , that provokes you to make such a comment ? 
  50 years of going on and on about it ? 
  urgh , the sooner i get out of this place the better . 
   half the girls in the year started balling crying when she told us, 
  what the fuck ? 
   oh and one of the gay guys in our year came into cupcake batter and baked them for her . 
  she served them at the grad mass after party . 
  what the fuck ? 
  nah , there are more significant problems than the australians . 
  like the growing number of south americans ... . . 
  hmm , i have n't come across too many of them on 4chan - what boards do they frequent ? 
   implying they have internet access in africa, 
   besides , it usually means that someone else agrees with me and that shuts the whole thing down .
