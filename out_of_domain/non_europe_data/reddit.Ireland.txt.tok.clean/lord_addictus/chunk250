  - fred-104 - active, 
  - adriana-111 - status unknown , gray team ( out of contact as of 2551 ) . 
  - john-117 - mother fucking active . 
  - mike-120 - status unknown , gray team ( out of contact as of 2551 ) . 
  - joseph-122 - status unknown ( undocumented for entirety of the human covenant war ), 
  - alice-130 - mia , last known location unsc spirit of fire . 
  and then we have :, 
  - unidentified spartan - confirmed kia during the harvest campaign in february 2531 . 
  - two unidentified trainees - confirmed kia ( well , technically they committed suicide after escaping the program in 2525 before becoming operational spartans . 
  notably though , this was post-augmentation ) . 
  unless i ca n't count , that 's 35 of 33 spartans accounted for - 5 active , 15 confirmed kia , 5 `` mia '' , 5 genuinely mia , 1 retired , 4 status unknown . 
  and this is where it gets even more complicated . 
  here are 2 spartans * assumed * to be synonymous with some of the named characters listed so far :, 
  - `` beta-red actual '' - mia , presumed kia during the fall of reach . 
  - `` red-fifteen '' - confirmed kia during the fall of reach . 
  [ anybody who knows the lore better than me have an idea who these spartans might be ? ], 
  in addition , it must be remembered that black team were not part of that batch of 33 . 
  they were spartan candidates who were originally classified as `` dead '' after washing out of the augmentation process and put in cold storage . 
  oni later revived , rehabilitated , and created black team using :, 
  - otto-031 - confirmed kia, 
  - margaret-053 - confirmed kia, 
  - victor-101 - confirmed kia, 
  - roma-143 - confirmed kia, 
  now , i 'm far from a lore expert - i pulled all this info from [ this halopedia page ] ( http://www.halopedia.org/spartan_2 ) - but something definitely is n't adding up here . 
  we have 2 more spartans iis in the lore than we should have ( and possibly more if the identities of beta-red actual and red-fifteen remain unconfirmed ) . 
  however , provided that 343 industries does n't pull a fast one , i 'm pretty sure naomi was the last new spartan ii we 're ever going to see introduced . 
  so , your thoughts ? 
  anything i got wrong or missed ? 
  ** edit : ** changed james-005 's entry from `` confirmed kia '' to `` mia '' . 
  was replaying the reach campaign for the first time in about 2 years over the weekend . 
  good fun as always ( i still maintain it has the best campaign gameplay of any halo game ) , even if the plot is sloppy as ever in places . 
  but what 's stuck with me over the past few days is cortana 's presence in the campaign . 
  now , i know we 've discussed the inconsistencies of the reach campaign before - even this particular aspect of it . 
  but what i want to know is whether any canon conclusion was reached ( no pun intended ) with regard to cortana 's actions and movements on reach ? 
  for example , when comparing the events of halo reach and the fall of reach , there are 2 occasions where ( from my analysis at least ) she is listed as being at 2 different places on the same date . 
  fragmentation has been often suggested as reason for these dualities , but having analysed the scene in halsey 's lab in the second last mission there is no implication that the ai given to noble 6 is anything less than the full , complete cortana . 
  nothing i can put my finger on , but halsey certainly speaks of cortana like she is present in her entirety . 
  so , is there an explanation or do we put it down to bungie playing fast and loose with the canon again ? 
  of all the spartan teams , black team is easily the most unusual for a number of reasons . 
  even their origins are unusual - but that depends on what version of events you read . 
  between halopedia , / r/halostory , and other sources , i have seen multiple accounts of how black team came to work under oni . 
  some say they `` washed out '' after the augmentation process , and were put in cold storage like the other wash-outs , only to be revived and rehabilitated by oni at a later date . 
  other sources claim black team successfully completed augmentations as part of the successful 33 . 
  but according to my own research , that conflicts with other canon as seen [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/halostory/comments/345w5p/do_we_have_two_many_spartan_iis_in_the_canon/ ) . 
  so , anybody able to clear this up for me ? 
  the shield world had similar gravity to earth , and at the time only unsc frigates were capable of operating in atmosphere . 
  was the fleet organised by regret to secure the ark portal ? 
  if so , why did he need such a large fleet considering that he had no idea that earth was the human homeworld ?

  * ** total budget and country of purchase : **, 
  $ 1000 , ireland, 
  * ** do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor , good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money ? 
  pick or include any that apply . 
  best specs for the money are my top requirement because i tend to hold onto laptops for 3-6 years , but i would like at least a 3 hour battery life when just browsing the internet . 
  * ** how important is weight to you ? 
  my current laptop is about 2.6 kg , so as long as it 's not much heavier than that . 
  * ** which os do you require ? 
  windows , linux , mac . 
  windows, 
  * ** do you have a preferred screen size ? 
  if indifferent , put n/a . 
  15.6 inch minimum , but i would n't want to go too much bigger than that either . 
  * ** are you doing any cad/video editing/photo editing/gaming ? 
  list which programs/games you desire to run . 
  if you have no requirements , put n/a . 
  gaming ; steam, 
  * ** if you 're gaming ( leave blank if you put n/a above ... ) , do you have certain games you want to play ? 
  at what settings and fps do you want ? 
  as a benchmark , i 'd like to be able to play the dark souls games on medium settings at 30 + fps, 
  * ** any specific requirements such as good keyboard , reliable business grade build quality , touch-screen , finger-print reader , optical drive or good input devices ( keyboard/touchpad ) ? 
  keyboard with the keys spaced close together ( see the dell inspiron 1545 for reference - best keyboard i ever had on a laptop ) , at least 3 usb ports , sturdy build quality , hdmi output port , hard drive ( i.e. 
  not just an ssd on its own ) , disk drive , bluetooth ( not a necessity , but it would be nice ) . 
  * ** leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion . 
  i really do n't know what are the current `` good '' laptop brands at the moment . 
  for years i 've had dell laptops which i was very happy with , but now that my current one needs replacing , that dell 's share of the laptop market as decreased significantly and there are a lot more options out there . 
  a bit of advice on what to avoid for future reference would be great . 
  personally i would prefer to stick with the more mainstream brands due to my location in ireland ( getting mainstream laptops repaired or serviced properly here can be difficult enough as it is ) . 
  ** edit : ** my main candidate at the moment is some variant of the dell inspiron 15 7000 series , but probably not the i7559-763blk because i do n't want just the 250gb ssd and upgrading that would put me above my budget . 
  i 've had my panther for about 6 months now , and i 've never been able to adapt to how it plays ( it 's the only tank i own that i ca n't get mastery or a barrel ring on ) . 
  i already own the stug iii g ( which i love ) , and i 've been considering working my way up to the jpanther to fill the tier vii gap that would be left if i sold my panther . 
  would anybody who has experience with both tanks be able to tell me if this would be a wise move ? 
  sorry for asking such a simple question , but i ca n't find confirmation anywhere online . 
  i need to buy 2 new garage slots , and i know there 's an upcoming sale on garage slots on pc at the moment . 
  i 'm just wondering does anybody know if there is going to be one on console ? 
  i have one spare equipment slot on my centurion 1 ( already have spall liner and gun rammer installed ) . 
  i had wet ammo rack installed , but i removed that as i recently trained my crew in safe stowage and that seems to be good enough to improve my ammo rack survivability in most matches . 
  the biggest issues i have with my centurion is the long aim time and the huge reticle bloom during turret rotation . 
  they really hamper what is otherwise a fantastic support sniper . 
  i want to address one of these two issues with some equipment , so i 've been looking at the enhanced gun laying drive and the vertical satabiliser . 
  i already have my crew trained in snapshot , but the bloom is still very bad . 
  and in my experience enhanced gun laying drive is only noticably effective on russian heavies and tds . 
  so i 'm just looking for a bit of advice on which ( if any ) of these two pieces of equipment i should go for ? 
  so i 've finally decided to switch from my 360 to my xb1 for wot . 
  it 's great that you can move your wot account between them without issue . 
  i just have a couple of questions though :, 
  can you still play on the 360 after switching to xb1 ? 
  i 've been informed that all achievements will have to be unlocked again for the xb1 version . 
  will these unlock retroactively ? 
  is there anything else i should know before switching ? 
  following up on that post about recommended motherland equipment , what skills and perks should be a priority for motherland crews ?
