  asking me if i have a solution to a problem just because i say that this slacktivism will have zero effect on the crisis is incredibly stupid , if you do n't mind me saying so . 
   i 'd argue that palestine is the country under siege, 
  agreed . 
  however , the recent siege-like conditions were at the very least partly the fault attacks by hamas militants . 
  this does n't excuse the actions of israelis , but it might help explain them . 
   and that palestine has far less military might, 
  so we always have to root for the underdog ? 
  that seems like an odd way to dictate foreign policy . 
   and that we 're closely tied with israel 's main ally , the us, 
  should we not be boycotting us goods too then ? 
   how would you `` properly '' protest them ? 
  we ca n't - that 's what i 've been saying . 
  any acts of protest we make on the level that we 've seen so far since the most recent conflict kicked off are ineffective . 
  we * might * be able to offer diplomatic aid ( and humanitarian aid if we could ever reach the gaza coastline ) , but other than that we 're largely impotent . 
   well this would seem to suggest that you know how to do it properly . 
  which is what i was asking but its seems you dont . 
  so you just crap all over other peoples activities . 
  i see a poorly built house from the boom times on the verge of collapse while walking down the street . 
  i comment to my friend `` that house would be habitable if it had been constructed properly '' . 
  y ` see , my statement there is legitimate even though i know fuck all about how to build a house . 
  hence my statement that `` if something is worth doing , it 's worth doing properly '' stands . 
   do you think political pressures at a high level just spontaneously erupt when there are so many invested interests and if there was zero pressure from the electorate to engage ? 
  the us has been engaging in israel for decades even though the majority of the us population would prefer if large amounts of their tax money * did n't * go towards propping up israel 's existence . 
  so , yes , political influence does often occur regardless of the average citizen 's opinion on the matter . 
   how do you rate the boycott that happened against apartheid, 
  it was largely ineffectual on apartheid if i recall correctly . 
  that said , my knowledge of the topic is mostly based on its segment in reeling in the years . 
   how do you rate the effect of dublin city council 's non renewal of veolia 's contract for the luas . 
  this is different in that was an internal affair within ireland - the protests can actually result in meaningful action being taken within our own little democracy . 
  as it stands , our government is largely impotent as regards the situation in gaza . 
   it 's also about consumer choice . 
  there may be people who do n't want to purchase israeli goods , and the exchequer is giving them this option . 
  what about the people who * do * want to purchase israeli goods ? 
  they 're not exactly being given an equal opportunity in this particular bar . 
  ** edit : ** okay , i see their point . 
  that said , i do n't see this as anything more than a marketing ploy . 
   if a government boycott was put in place , israel would feel it . 
  hah , yeah right !, 
  seriously , i have massive problems with what israel is doing at the moment , but the amount of naivety in this subreddit about any potential effects a boycott in ireland of israeli goods might have on the israeli economy would be hilarious if it were n't so tragic . 
  ireland is a small economy . 
  even if there was a government-supported boycott of israeli goods , it would have little impact on the israeli economy . 
  and besides , the us would just prop them up anyway like they always do . 
  just strikes me as a marketing plot if i 'm honest . 
  but you 're right - they 're entitled to do as they please with their own business . 
  i agree with ( government sanctioned ) boycotts in order to send a message , but believing that they would have any financial impact is idiotic . 
  that 's all i 'm saying , and some people here seem to have a serious problem with that . 
  we should do things if they have a definite/attainable goal . 
  otherwise you 're just wasting time and energy . 
  ** edit : ** added a clarifying word . 
  interesting fact , but as you said , that statement works under the assumption of a complete irish boycott , which will never happen even if the government sanctions it ( i.e. 
  i ca n't see the government banning companies in ireland from receiving components they need from israel ) . 
  in addition , combine the fervor of most israeli 's for a decisive victory in this war and the massive amount of us aid that the israeli government receives , and you end up with a situation where a few job losses are n't going to sway the israeli government nor the majority of the israeli people . 
  in fact , given the national mentality of israel , they may just see a boycott as another example of certain foreign countries possessing anti-semitic views ( seriously , ireland has accused of being anti-semitic by israel in the past ) and harden them in their resolve . 
  if people would use their indicators it would certainly help a lot . 
  implying that there are competent alternatives . 
   so in the absence of a time machine you have nothing to offer by way of alleviating the situation . 
  but to give out about others actions . 
  and you call other slacktivists who actually do things . 
  nice, 
  these actions of others you mention will achieve nothing . 
  and just because they 're doing `` something '' without achieving anything does n't make them worthy of admiration . 
   well perhaps you need better sources . 
  i never claimed to be an expert on it . 
   what ? 
  no it is n't . 
  dcc voted to not renew veolia 's contract as it was involved in building illegal settlements in the occupied palestinian territories and it did so when the mavi mamara was attacked and irish citizens arrested by the idf . 
  dcc said you can choose one contract or the other and puts direct pressure on israel and companies that deal with it . 
  til . 
  i do n't really follow irish news that much if i 'm honest - i tend to be glued to international news most the time . 
   russia is under international sanction, 
  but not for its homophobia , right ? 
   they 'll achieve more than bitching about them while offering no solutions or even trying to help . 
  i really do n't think they will . 
   who the fuck wants admiration . 
  well , you certainly do n't like being criticized at all . 
   the goal is to pressure the israeli government to act in accordance with international law by encouraging boycott , divestment and sanction . 
  and i 've told you time and time again that the goal you have for your boycotts and protests is not feasible . 
  you 're actually now just willfully ignoring every explanation that 's been put to you for the sake of giving out . 
  your expectation that the average citizen would have a clearly defined solution for the gazan conflict is delusional . 
  i 'm dismissive of something i see as a pointless endevour . 
   just because you do n't have a full solution for the israeli/gaza conflict does n't mean you should actively support it by giving them money . 
  y ` see , this is a sentiment that i actually agree with - you 're attempting to send a message . 
  it 's the assumption that your actions will have any tangible impact on the gazan conflict that i disagree with . 
  4chan is n't some dangerous neighbourhood - it 's just a website . 
  your fear of it is irrational . 
  up until i started learning to drive properly ( i.e. 
  applying for the practical test ) , i would have wholeheartedly agreed with you . 
  but now i have to say that no fucking way am i resitting the practical driving test . 
  my town as a ridiculous failure rate and trying to pass the test was one of the most stressful experiences of my life . 
  i would n't mind , but i 'm a very competent driver and always have been . 
  i recognize the inherent benefits of your suggestion , but i would n't be able to handle doing the test again . 
  and besides , it 's an absolute money racket these days . 
  i often wonder how some people passed their driving test at all . 
  jeez , you went far afield to pass the test - fair play . 
  i imagine trying to pass it in dublin would be a nightmare . 
   my point was that maybe some people fall back into bad driving habits and forget some of the rules of the road that i feel should be checked and retested . 
  they do , and i would completely be in favour of people having to resit a beefed up theory test every 10 years ( or less ) . 
  but i do n't fancy sitting the practical test again . 
  love the fact that this is downvoted . 
  somebody needs to compile a database of buildings in major irish urban areas that have public/customer toilets .
