  hey now , jp2 did a lot of good , as well as a lot of dubious and outright wrong shit . 
  but all in all , i would n't call him a `` complete bastard '' by any stretch of the imagination . 
  christ that 's expensive water !, 
  it 's not the views themselves that tarnish his image , it 's the actual campaign against contraception that the catholic church led in africa that does that . 
  i think that distinction is worth making . 
  personally opposing contraception is n't inherently bad . 
  i 'm not even a catholic , but i do have an interest in the catholic church as an organisation , and i ca n't say i would agree with that . 
  he was no saint either though . 
  ** edit : ** once again / r/ireland is showing its maturity when it comes to dealing with opinions it does n't like . 
   that would be like saying hitler was n't that bad it was the army who killed the jews . 
  but i distinctly said that the actions the church committed under his leadership tarnished his image . 
  to be fair , people tend to be pretty good at giving tech support here . 
  it should n't be the dominant purpose of the subreddit though . 
   / r/gaming4gamers, 
  good sub . 
  needs more members though . 
  kidnapping and torture ? 
  wow , lazy *** and *** bitter . 
  that 's a hell of a combination . 
  has she not given up yet ? 
  i swear to god , if this bullshit actually results in somebody being arrested just because the college bows to sjw pressure ... 
  huh , i did n't know that the jews wanted to rebuild the temple . 
  do n't they believe that their messiah will rebuild that ? 
  also , is n't half of the former temple site in the west bank ? 
   how bout the actual lives being lost by service members while you were busy being an angst-filled teenage prick ? 
  people die all the time , dude . 
  i 'm sensing some sjw vibes in that comment . 
  remove all the doors from the hinges and hide the screws . 
  typically cats tend to recover from injuries such as broken bones very well , so here 's hoping op 's cat does the same . 
  but in that case , he deserves it for being a naive white knight so it 's not exactly `` worse '' . 
  this is why i never went to social gatherings in college - amongst other reasons . 
  are you new to anime or something ? 
  it 's the destiny of every general gaming subreddit to become as bad as / r/gaming , albeit in a slightly diffferent way . 
  lucky north americans ... 
   i 'll just assume your insensitivity is ignorance and move on, 
  and we 'll just assume you 're a sensitive little snowflake . 
  see , assuming is fun !, 
  well then , you have a lot to learn and have many experiences ahead of you . 
  enjoy !, 
   if you want it enough , every resource is there and available to help you . 
  it must be great living in a world where you think this is true . 
  high school of the dead is shit and do n't let anybody tell you otherwise . 
  there are plenty shows with fanservice that are actually good . 
  that depends on your tastes . 
  what do you look for in a show ? 
  try gurren lagann . 
  it 's pretty much a requirement that all anime fans watch it at some stage . 
  great action , blistering pace , decent characters , bit of humour , unobtrusive fanservice . 
  if this comment is n't from a girl or gay guy , i 'll be seriously surprised . 
   explain the extreme difficulties we have ? 
  living away from home is expensive , and not everybody who needs the grant gets it ( and vice versa ) . 
   i compare to the us and the horrible ( lack of ) support for their students . 
  we have it fairly good . 
  i never said the irish system was n't good , it 's just far from perfect . 
  a lot of people fall through the cracks . 
  well , that and the fact that i dislike being around other people for extended periods of time . 
  what 's the point in being rebellious just for the sake of it ? 
  it achieves nothing other than a feeling of misguided smug self-satisfaction . 
  wow , your daily life must be really hard if you 're creeped out/annoyed by stuff like this . 
  that may be true , but anybody with an iota of common sense would know that most schools would not allow a haircut like that . 
  therefore , getting your hair cut in this manner with that knowledge is an intentional act of teenage rebellion . 
   this is the most common haircut among young men these days . 
  gon na need some sort of evidence to back that up . 
   in fact , i ca n't think of anyone other than yourself and that principal who finds this haircut somehow unacceptable in a school environment . 
  perhaps it 's not to his or your tastes but that does n't mean that either of you get to play dictator . 
  personally i have no problem with the haircut . 
  i just know that while you are in school , you are obliged to adhere to the school 's dress/general appearance rules . 
  i have no time for teens who refuse to do this . 
   if i get kicked out again laughs shall be heard . 
  how so ? 
  yeah , never try to make an intelligent comment while using words such as this . 
  that said , the comment itself has little to no substance anyway , so it does n't really matter . 
   im going to make my hair as normal as possible for school . 
  well , at least you 're doing the right thing now . 
  in my experience , nobody intelligent uses the term `` yous '' . 
  op , do you know where you are exactly ? 
  thanks for the tip . 
  i 'll keep it in mind in case i 'm not successful with this thread . 
  why not all three ? 
  and people were seriously trying to convince me that i should vote for him as president . 
   but i 'm sorry , a thousand times over , i 'm sorry . 
  yeah , we do n't really care that much to be honest . 
  i was hoping the no vote would be successful from day 1 because it just makes more sense for scotland given the current global and national climate . 
  you 're gon na get a good deal now that westminister was backed into a corner and forced to promise some serious concessions . 
  and given how close the result was , you will always have a mandate to try again in the future . 
  although the uk leaving the eu remains unlikely for the moment , i will concede that it does put scotland in an awkward position . 
  ditto with the foreign policy , particularly in terms of potential wars . 
  that said , scotland * will * get some decent benefits out of this failed independence vote . 
  if westminister does n't follow up on the promises the no campaign made , it will only turn more people to the yes side and create increased demand for another vote in the future . 
   unlikely . 
  scotland will be punished for this, 
  gon na need some evidence/a source for that . 
  am i wrong for thinking that this is a glimmer of hope in the sense that at least this sort of thing is n't getting taken down * yet * ? 
  how are men 's rights meetings sexist , but the feminist equivalent is n't ? 
  i 'm sorry , but you appear to be a bigot . 
   look how many women-hating comments have been made because those women were fighting for their rights . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  and ? 
  it 's the internet - who gives a fuck ? 
  touched a nerve ?
