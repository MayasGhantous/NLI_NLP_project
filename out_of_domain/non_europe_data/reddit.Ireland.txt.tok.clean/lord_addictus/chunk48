  in this case , i think it would be . 
  nothing of value would be lost . 
   but a small handful of women screaming at your *** red pill meeting *** is clearly the biggest problem facing colleges today , nevermind the student debt bubble . 
  you literally said in your second paragraph that we should have no idea what the group was discussing . 
  typical moronic feminist . 
  although i 'm not seriously advocating this , i do think it would make for a more pleasant society . 
  what 's wrong with men pointing out instances where they are worse off than women ? 
  is it wrong to highlight and address those ? 
  laughing does n't provide a counterpoint . 
  suppose i want to support men 's rights but do n't want to join the feminist movement because i have issues with elements of it ? 
  the men 's rights movement fills that niche . 
  what a well articulated point . 
  the irony being , you 're an extremist for saying that . 
  ah , yet another typical feminist retort on the internet . 
  full of insightful points and logic . 
  no , * you 're * the kind of person we do n't want on 4chan . 
  do you even know how subreddit of the day selections are made ? 
  i assume some sort of top hat is involved . 
  my original comment pointed out a logical flaw in your comment - this makes me 14 how exactly ? 
  making assumptions is n't very helpful . 
  i ca n't believe i 'm talking with somebody this ignorant . 
  then again , i am dealing with your typical internet feminist . 
  intelligence ca n't be your strong suit . 
  then what reason do you have to be incredulous at / r/4chan 's selection ? 
  fair point . 
  you do n't care that you 're an extremist ? 
  how mature ... 
  also , in case you have n't noticed , you 're on reddit too . 
  and ? 
  but i could just as easily call you a reddit lemming ? 
  is n't it fun to call people names ? 
  thanks for getting back to me , man . 
  but i got the achievements since i made this post . 
  and ? 
  this is a subreddit about 4chan . 
  that content exists on 4chan . 
  hence you should n't be surprised when nsfw content appears on / r/4chan, 
  having seen a few episodes of it in the past , i can safely say that it 's fucking awful . 
  like , really * really * bad . 
  it feels like a cross between those american gaming tv shows from the 90 's , xpos\u00e9 , and the idiotic `` entertainment '' segments before the simpsons and home & away on rte2 . 
  most people who do n't visit tumblr use the terms interchangeably . 
  what if a person is all of the things on that list ? 
  and the hot friends only do this to maintain the allegiance of the ugly girls so that their beauty will stand out all the more by comparison . 
  i do n't know which is more annoying ; the lack of originality in the french surrender-monkey jokes these days , or the pissy reactions that french people have to them . 
  eh , at least it gives me another reason to laugh at the french . 
  arrogance - the arrogance is something they even struggle to deny themselves . 
  parisians are the worst for it . 
  i would never have heard of him if it were n't for / r/ireland constantly fawning over him . 
  i can tell you 're not a native english speaker ... 
  well , they * did * surrender . 
  and their army capitulated to the germans awfully fast . 
  so what you 're saying is , the germans are more efficient ? 
  well we already knew that , france-man !, 
   france did fight in the vietnam war for ten years before the americans even arrived . 
  and they made a complete fucking mess of it . 
  compared to america , maybe . 
  that fucker deserved it . 
  if somebody was shoving and obstructing you , you 'd be right to try and throw them off . 
  lets not become america where everybody is suing everybody else over the smallest of things that we would have laughed off before . 
  it 's moreso regarding how quickly the french capitulated to the germans during ww2 . 
  they were pretty much steamrolled . 
  that does n't look good no matter what the circumstances . 
  nah , he 's probably just french . 
  other than the moon-landing and ww2 , show me a point in american history that is n't stupid or pathetic . 
  it is now . 
  french was a huge military power in europe at the time . 
  most the others were n't . 
  and people are n't gon na let the joke die as long as french people still get annoyed about it . 
   why did they ` deserve ' it, 
  because technically he was `` assaulting '' the td . 
  and besides , there was no need for that pushing and shoving . 
  stupid behaviour . 
  butthurt detected . 
  also , while i admire american inventions , i was mainly talking about geopolitical and national events in america 's history . 
   but they kept on fighting all throughout the war nonetheless, 
  * some * did . 
  nowhere near the majority though , despite what gaulists tried to pretend after the war . 
   with the new capital being established in vichy . 
  vichy france was a puppet state of nazi germany , and was taken over by the nazis properly at the mid-point of the war . 
   degaules was a just as important part of the allies than churhill or fdr were, 
  do n't make me laugh !, 
  de gaulle was important , but he was nowhere near * that * important . 
  read a history book sometime . 
  and ? 
  so everybody should stop making the joke because it annoys the french ? 
  you do realise that very idea makes people joke about french cowardice all the more ? 
  great points . 
  i did n't know about operation vulture nor about the german emperor being crowned in versailles . 
  i guess i have some reading to do . 
   then they `` won '' algiers in the same way the us `` won '' vietnam . 
  except everyone in france actually believes they won unironically . 
  the french reaction to the whole algeria situation in the 50 's / 60 's was bizarre . 
   you could make fun of the unemployment , or being overrun by africans thats still done a lot without being utterly fucking stupid . 
  today 's modern man has enough brain-power to make both of those jokes *** and *** surrender jokes . 
  anon , you 're trying too hard . 
  also , that link is only based on when the french are actually * working * . 
  to make it fair , you have to subtract all that time they spend striking . 
   less productive than america, 
  germany aside , this is nothing to be proud of . 
  and besides , i still think most people would trust a german person/company to do a job than a french person/company .
