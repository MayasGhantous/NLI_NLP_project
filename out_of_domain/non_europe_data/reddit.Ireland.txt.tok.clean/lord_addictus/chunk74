  back to facebook with you . 
   they up and down said the dub was hands down better than the sub, 
  well those people are very , * very * wrong . 
  but you 'd win . 
  and winning is all that matters . 
  `` dig upwards ! '', 
  it revolves around maria ; a kind , pacifist witch in an excellently portrayed medieval france , who earns the ire of god for interfering in the incessant wars between the english and the french . 
  st. michael descends from heaven to strip her of her powers , but grants her a second chance when he is made aware of how much she has helped the people of the region . 
  however , this second chance comes with strings attached ; she can no longer use her powers in public and most importantly , once she loses her virginity , she will be stripped of her powers forever . 
  we are only 4 episodes in , but believe me when i say the ecchi in this show is limited to well-executed sexual humour and the odd bit of nudity . 
  to label it as an ecchi show has done it a disservice , because the tag is unfortunately putting people ( possibly like yourself ) off it . 
  the characters are great , the story and subplots are interesting , and the historical setting is one of the best-executed i 've ever seen in anime . 
  and that 's not to mention the philosophical and theological discussions this show is fueling on the likes of / a / due to christianity ( and religion in general ) being central themes of the show . 
  so you 're saying you 've never calmly burnt down a forest ? 
  most likely , yes . 
   all of them ? 
  in over 20 countries i have never been on a commuter train that had toilets , only long distance . 
  have you been to western europe by any chance ? 
  depends on your definition of `` shithole '' . 
  even though it was a few years ago at this stage , when i was at college there was plenty of students who opposed abortion and gay marriage . 
  they just tend to be less vocal so you do n't hear them in pubic as much . 
  but they steadily vote , as is their right . 
  that sounds like a bit of a generalisation to be fair . 
  also , in my experience at least , a lot of young people can * appear * to be homophobic due to the general `` slagging '' sense of humour most of them have ( especially guys ) , but in reality have no problem at all with the gay community . 
  devils advocate here ; by the pro-life side 's point of few , abortion is murder . 
  so if the mother is complicit in the abortion , she is by definition a murderer . 
  you have to see it from their point of view . 
  ** edit : ** did i say something incorrect ? 
  yeah . 
  i 'm on neither side of the abortion debate or gay marriage debate ( i have no vested interest in either , so i 'm hardly going to force myself to care ) . 
  but that said , i appreciate that we live in a democracy and that each side in a potential referendum case has the right to be heard . 
  and with that in mind , it bothers me how quick people on / r/ireland ( and in ireland in general ) are to dismiss and belittle people with opinions on important issues that do n't conform with their worldview . 
  there are very few cases ( e.g. 
  the anti-vaccination debate ) where one side of a big , societal debate is 100 % objectively wrong . 
  that 's optimistic at best . 
  that 's a new one for / r/ireland . 
  do the opinions of men not matter in the abortion debate any more ? 
  ** edit : ** going by the downvoting , evidently not . 
  i agree with you . 
  it 's not something that tends to come up in every day conversation , nor is it something many people will have to confront in their lives . 
  i beg to differ - to an extent . 
  well , that 's what i was implying - i possibly could have articulated it better . 
  as long as you understand the logic for their opinions , that 's all you 're required to do . 
  it allows for the debate to evolve each side shit-slinging at each other . 
  i never said you had to agree or respect their opinion ( although a bit more respect from both sides of the abortion and marriage equality debates would go a long way ) . 
  you think it 's stupid , which is what you 're entitled to think . 
  nobody is asking you to agree with the beliefs of those on the other side of the debate . 
  however , i do think it 's wrong for either side to be lambasting the opposition because their opinion is `` objectively wrong '' . 
  the whole thing just devolves into shit-slinging that way . 
  nobody is going to deny you your opinion on the beliefs of the opposition . 
  it 's merely the branding of opposing beliefs as `` objectively wrong '' that does n't sit well with me . 
  eh , i can safely admit that it 's not really a conversation i 'd have any desire to engage in . 
   why not be supportive ? 
  would you be supportive of somebody you perceived to be a murderer ? 
  maybe you can explain then why / b / is so obsessed with this movie ? 
  or to be exact , that movie poster . 
  did n't even know this was coming to 360 . 
  i hope it is n't a badly watered-down port like battlefield 4 was . 
  according to the pro-choice side of the debate . 
  not according to the pro-life side . 
  opinions , remember ? 
  even medical science ca n't provide a 100 % concrete answer that would determine whether abortion is murder or not . 
   the fact that you categorize an entire race with being fake and the fact that you are this retarded to think korean economy ca n't keep up with the `` skyrocketing demand for above average lifestyle '' make you probably the most ignorant dumbass fucking autist i ever crossed ever if you are not baiting, 
  worst korean detected . 
  mocking korea for being americanised is a bit rich coming from japan , no ? 
   so why the fuck should anyone care about your opinion , since you have a shitty moral compass yourself ? 
  to be fair , is he not entitled to his opinion on abortion ? 
  like , undermining a person 's opinion by accusing them of having a shitty moral compass seems rather disingenuous when from the perspective of a pro-lifer , their moral compass is very well alligned as they care about the life of the unborn . 
  that said , i 'm sure plenty of pro-lifers accuse pro-choice people of having a shitty moral compass too , but do you really want to sink to that level ? 
  this is n't a black and white issue . 
  well , one could always be more responsible . 
  i 'm neither pro-choice nor pro-life , but i would hate to see abortion become a means of enabling the irresponsible . 
   and there 's a he involved too . 
  do n't call her irresponsible when her partner obviously did n't want a child either . 
  was he irresponsible ? 
  no - because the fetus does n't grow inside his body , and apparently it does n't `` take two to tango '' in a lot of people 's eyes . 
  this is rather disingenuous because in most countries where abortion is legalised , the man involved in the pregnancy has zero legal input in whether an abortion takes place or not . 
  so from a legal standpoint , it 's all on the woman in those countries . 
  i unfortunately imagine it would be the same situation if abortion was legalised in ireland ; men expected to have responsibility , but no legal input . 
   it 's time we saw the face of the woman who just wa n't ready . 
  that 's a good way of getting people on the fence in the abortion debate to vote no . 
   i 'm 99 % sure you meant all the anti-vaccination people are wrong, 
  do n't worry , that 's exactly what i meant . 
  i was rushing away to a meeting as i made that post , so i did n't get a chance to proof read it properly . 
  until medical science can determine with 100 % certainty when life begins for a fetus , that 's up for debate . 
  [ also , personal opinion here , but i dislike a fetus being called a parasite . 
  it just does n't sit well with me that a ( potential ? ), 
  human life is referred to as such ], 
  well , they 'll need to remove the pixelation first . 
   what really sickens my shit though are people who say '' oh , it is okay if it was rape , but not if it is a lifestyle decision '' . 
  i mean , you ca n't say it is murder in one instance and not the other . 
  if people genuinely believe it to be murder , then they would still think it was murder , no mater what the circumstances are . 
  i agree . 
  i 've often found however that people who oppose abortion based on the `` lifestyle decision '' issue are n't * always * the same people who oppose it because the consider it outright murder . 
  i remember speaking to one girl in college who was on the fence about the whole abortion debate , and what she said has stuck with me over the years . 
  she maintained that because medical science could n't confirm with 100 % accuracy when life begins in the womb , the whole debate on whether abortion is murder is a fruitless endevour from the get go . 
  but despite that ambiguity , she said she would approve of abortion being legalised for cases where there was a medical or circumstantial ( e.g. 
  rape ) reason for the decision . 
  however , she stated that if abortion was to be given full legal status for any reason like in britain , she would vote no in any such referendum . 
  her reasoning for this was twofold ; ( 1 ) if we find out for certain in the future that life begins in the womb earlier than we assumed , she would prefer that we had only aborted babies for essential reasons , and ( 2 ) she feared that easily available abortion without question would breed irresponsibility with regards to safe sex .
