upvoted for reservoir , fantastic album, 
  fun . 
  - aim and ignite ( this has been on my recent listening list ever since i first heard it . 
  incredible ), 
  hot chip - one life stand ( amazing , especially i feel better , which i always feel the need to listen to twice when i listen to this album ), 
  wolf parade - apologies to the queen mary ( i 've been listening to a lot of spencer krug 's music recently , but probably this album most of all ), 
  would love to have heard dermot ahern actually say the word whack, 
  i 've been using dina for a few weeks now , it 's really great , 
  ndiswrapper is a word that makes me shudder every time, 
  only one mention of merzbow in this whole thread ? 
  / r/music , i am disappoint, 
  pretty dull , i guess ... 
  20 slim, 
  9 man, 
  8 ssh, 
  i do n't know what 's worse , thinking that portapros are steampunk or that skullcandys ( skullcandies ? ), 
  are acceptable . 
  the reason he ate the menu in that way was that ( at that time ) mcdonalds had n't / would n't admit that their food was unhealthy or `` should be eaten in moderation as part of a balanced diet '' , not that he actually trusted in the heathiness of their food ( afaik ) . 
  and i do not doubt for a second that if you ate nothing but mcdonalds , your lifespan would be significantly shortened, 
  upvote for, 
  a ) preferring the far superior planet hulk to the only alright world war hulk, 
  b ) liking joss whedon 's x-men run , which some people do n't like for reasons that continue to baffle me, 
  well , i guess i know what album i 'm listening to this morning , 
   chances are you 've heard of ... 
  really ? 
  i would have considered him fairly well known , especially among music enthusiasts , who i assume make up most of this board, 
  what the hell ? 
  why is there all this stuff on a business 's website ? 
  are they trying to scare customers away ? 
  this looks pretty fake to me ... 
  definitely in line with my experience : / ( fun dabbling though ), 
  i do n't think it is . 
  i hate to break it to you , but i think your school was probably just especially terrible . 
  it honestly shocks me that this sort of thing has ever happened, 
  the dead only quickly by the 6ths is pretty great, 
  i used to work in an electronics shop in a retail park where there were other electronics shops , so customers would say this a lot . 
  my managers often joked about saying `` really ? 
  is it that cheap in < other shop  ? 
  hang on , i 'll get my coat , i wan na come too '' . 
  also , your post made me check shutupiamdreaming 's username , and his username made me immediately want to listen to that album . 
  i love modest mouse , and i would n't say they 've released a * bad * album , but i do n't hugely love good news for people who love bad news , so i 'd hesitate to name them . 
  upvote for both of the bands you mentioned that have exclamation marks in their names, 
  i came to this thread to talk about how terrible webct is . 
  every single time i go to my college 's webct , before i log in i get a stupid popup window to check whether my browser is compatible , and every time i 'm told it is n't ( firefox on arch linux ) . 
  there is no setting to disable this popup , and the system that you log into is a pile of crap anyway . 
  i have no problem with them not officially certifying/testing my browser , but if it gives me an annoying popup every single time that ca n't be disabled , then i get mad, 
  hmmm ... now that you mention it , i think we are using version 8 . 
  i 'd check , but , y' know , i do n't want the stupid popup, 
  believe me , they do n't want it phased out half as much as i do, 
  and ireland too ^_^,

  do n't you mean post - [ ** rock ** ] ( http://www.last.fm/tag/post-rock ) ? 
   this video contains content from british broadcasting corporation , who has blocked it on copyright grounds . 
  fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu, 
  yeah , i found it . 
  it is really good , 
  the lady gaga i have no problem with , but there 's no excuse for amarok, 
  ah , awesome and mpd . 
  now there 's a setup i can get behind , 
  have heard of them , so ca n't upvote . 
  but holy god these guys are awesome, 
  every time i see an awesome band i ca n't upvote because i already like them it hurts a little ... sometimes a lot . 
  damn hard mode !, 
  unheard and neglected ? 
  really ? 
  i would consider them very well known ( and awesome ), 
  i actually thought this was a joke when i first saw it . 
  even as a non-applefan who owns no apple products , i think reddit in general is * incredibly * anti-apple biased , and as a kneejerk reaction will upvote all sorts of `` hurr durr look at this terrible thing apple does '' , only for it to later turn out that there is a perfectly valid explanation . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/d5g4s/its_sht_like_this_steve_sht_like_this/ ), 
  great talk . 
  almost makes me happy to be too poor to afford any of the wimax stuff shown ... almost  . , 
  also fun to see that even among the most extremely tech-literate people , hooking up a laptop to a projector is most definitely non-trivial . 
  reminded me of [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itvalezrji8 ), 
  whose fault was 9/11 ? 
  the cleaners , they left the landing lights on, 
  ( i actually heard this one less than a week after 9/11 ), 
  why is this not the top-voted comment ? 
  this is the first thing i thought when i read it, 
  edit : `` it '' refers to the original link , not the parent comment of this comment, 
  wow , there is a lot of rage in you : /, 
  ( and i now realise how unclear my comment was , the `` it '' i was referring to was the poem in the link , not the comment itself ), 
  it was my birthday too , and checking wikipedia for famous people whose birthdays i share made me think of him , 
  not sure if troll ... 
  why are so many words in the link needlessly capitalised ? 
  it hurts to read : /, 
  itunes ? 
  really ? 
  it 's * awful *, 
  for me , it was dvd . 
  have never bought a bluray , never plan to, 
  itunes ? 
  hahahahaha , no, 
  well yeah , of course . 
  but i get by using other forms of digital distribution < . <  .  < . <, 
  the guy who died was a neighbour of mine . 
  i did n't know him , but this is still a big shock, 
   in screen , one types `` screen '', 
  actually , one types c-a c, 
  ftfy, 
  upvote for your first reaction being identical to mine,
