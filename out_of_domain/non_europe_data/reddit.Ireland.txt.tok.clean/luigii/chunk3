  i personally think it 's the best thing on tv, 
  i think we 're part of a dying breed . 
  i wear a watch for exactly the same reason as you : glancing at my wrist is quicker than pulling my phone out of my pocket . 
  no , if you killed a nazi about to activate a gas chamber you would be defending them . 
  but you have no right to decide that hitler deserves to die for his crimes . 
  that 's for a proper trial to do . 
  i know i 'm going to get downvoted for this ( and i probably deserve it ) but the question you got ta ask is not `` by who ? 
  '' , it 's `` by whom ? 
  my friend who 's a mac user will definitely be interested in this . 
  also , i 'd be interested in knowing if there 's a pidgin version available , 
  heh , well i never said i thought anyone should die for their crimes . 
  i personally do n't agree with a death penalty for any offence, 
  yes !, 
  i was disappointed how far i had to scroll down to find the right answer , 
  i have to say that although los campesinos !, 
  are probably my favourite band , i really do n't think i want to meet them , i could well believe that they are horrible to deal with, 
  surely c++ ? 
  i do n't think i 've heard even the most die-hard java fan say it 's faster than c, 
  ... which is written in java, 
  why would you capitalise every word in that sentence ? 
   coachella, 
  every festival, 
   this year, 
  every year, 
  i really , really , * really * hate this term but ... ftfy, 
  my laptop is called catenary . 
  i run arch linux , and a catenary is a type of arch or curve . 
  yes , i have been told repeatedly how lame this is :p, 
  mine is unfortunately similar to the op 's experience . 
  a friend of mine was talking about getting shat on by a bird one day in school and i had a great time giving him shit over it . 
  as i was walking home that day , i felt something splat against my cheek . 
  i guess i deserved it on some level ... : /, 
  mine is `` too old for imaginary friends '', 
  as a tic tac addict , i 'm kinda disappointed how far i had to scroll to find someone else who uses the pocket as i do, 
  this looks really interesting , but the article is only for subscribers :(, 
  what i want to know is why on earth would you need software for a battery charger ? 
  well you 're in luck , since this or another track from this album gets posted here at least once every two weeks, 
  i was going to go with an angry `` i 'm irish and ca n't believe that this got upvoted '' but i see one of my fellow countrymen had a much better retort than i, 
  yeah , and i 'm sure that it 's been posted a few more times than that too . 
  i had to downvote because although i liked the comic the first time i saw it , my reaction now was `` not this again ... '', 
   the downside is it 's almost as much of a steaming pile of crap as itunes is, 
  ftfy, 
  i do n't really like mac hate , but i can accept it if people admit that windows is a horrible ordeal . 
  linux is , of course perfect  _ , 
  this has been posted here at least once before , probably more . 
  downvoted, 
  i thought it was fairly obvious that i was kidding about linux being perfect : /, 
  and to be honest , i do n't think this is about crowds , i think it 's about oses , and i personally find windows painful, 
  maybe it 's because i 'm running it on some weak hardware ( my cheapo laptop ) but i 've found it * much * slower than linux . 
  i guess it runs smoother on my desktop , but i still prefer using linux ( using a tiling window manager in windows is not easy :p ), 
  i 'd rather listen to any radiohead than any oasis . 
  in fact , there are very few things i * would n't * rather listen to than oasis, 
  upvote for `` open source does n't have a point '' . 
  just because software is released under an open source license , it does n't mean there 's any expectation of what is to be done with it . 
  the only restrictions ( not sure if that 's the best word ) are what is * contained in the license *, 
  probably palestine , or any of joe sacco 's war reporting, 
   i could watch that all day, 
  agreed . 
  i was watching and waiting to get tired of the constant string-pulling boob-squeezing , but it just did n't happen, 
  your mom, 
  that 's not ruining a moment , that 's a public service, 
  i would have a lot more respect for you and your reasons for hating macs if it did n't come with tired old `` hurr durr macs are for hipsters '' bullshit . 
  ( and to try to avoid a storm of downvotes from people making presumptions about how aluminium my computer is , i 've been called a hipster many times , but have never owned an apple product ), 
  oh yes , we never see anti-apple sentiments on reddit, 
  i do n't care if people do n't like apple , sure whatever . 
  but reddit is kinda bad for apple hate that i ca n't really see a valid reason for . 
  i 'm not saying that 's you , it 's just when you say `` no one would know a differing opinion '' , it seems you 're implying the general trend is towards apple love and fanboyism here , which i really , * really * do n't think it is, 
  no , i read your post . 
  i think that that does sound pretty horribly awkward to work with . 
  on the other hand , i think that some commenters had a valid point when they said that it 's difficult to work with because it 's got a massive glass screen and is really thin so everything is packed in tightly . 
  i mean , i certainly find a computer being difficult to open and work on for the sake of prettiness annoying , but i really do n't think it was made that way specifically to make things difficult for end users . 
  also , this `` laundry list of reasons that a computer savvy person would prefer a pc '' , what is that exactly ? 
  when you say pc do you mean windows ? 
  or just a self-built computer ? 
  the dos equis ads are alright , but god , i fucking ** hate ** those damn old spice ads . 
  just awful, 
   if you do n't believe in the bullshit ... 
   that involves believing in heaven , the afterlife ... 
  i 'm sorry , if these are n't `` the bullshit '' , what is ? 
  i think that the idea of an afterlife is the * most * bullshitty , ridiculous idea to come out of religion . 
  maybe you ( i 'm assuming you 're a christian ) think i do n't agree with christians/religious people in general because of creationism/people who hate homosexuals/the westboro baptist church . 
  the reason i do n't agree with religion is because , and i 'm sorry if this seems blunt , ** it 's all bullshit , religious people believe in silly fairytales ** . 
  all the other stuff is just icing on the rage-cake, 
  see , my problem is that `` normal '' christians still believe in ridiculous things . 
  i honestly do n't care if people are offended when i say that a magic man in the sky and eternal life are bullshit . 
  they are . 
  sorry if that bothers you, 
  i do n't think they 're as bad , but one being worse does not make the other ok . and please do n't use passive aggressive quotation marks . 
  your beliefs are fairytales , plain and simple . 
  if you believe in an invisible friend in the sky , how are you separate from the anti-science crowd ? 
  ... huh ? 
  know what ? 
  i honestly ca n't understand how you can say you accept the laws of science , but still think they can be bent by something that 's outside of those laws . 
  surely this invalidates these laws ? 
  i hate the term militant atheist , because i think it 's a silly and inappropriate adjective to use . 
  however , it 's a term that could probably be applied to me by people who hate it less . 
  and i do n't think that religious people are less intelligent ( however strong a correlation there might be , correlation does n't imply causation ) . 
  i simply believe they are more wrong , 
   also from do n't section :, 
    downvote opinions just because you disagree with them .
