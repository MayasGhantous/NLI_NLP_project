  i 'll confess i 've never actually finished it but it 's incredible in depth and interesting . 
  very strange , hence the name of the genre ` new weird ', 
  yes people say ` chap ' in real life . 
  they do n't go around calling everyone chap and i most see used in the context / u/flyingsquare used it . 
  it seems like the germans in world war i were the first to use operation names , and the practice orginated towards the end of that war . 
  according to one source operation names were both `` to preserve operational security '' and were a `` convenient way of referring to subordinate and successive operations . '', 
  it appears the practice grew in the interwar years and the americans were using operation names before they even entered the war with operation indigo . 
  churchill seems to have a big hand in laying out some ` rules ' for the naming of operations . 
  [ mentalfloss ] ( http://mentalfloss.com/article/28711/how-military-operations-get-their-code-names ) has them down as follows :, 
  operations in which large numbers of men may lose their lives ought not to be described by code words which imply a boastful or overconfident sentiment . 
  they ought not to be names of a frivolous character . 
  names of living people -- ministers and commanders -- should be avoided . 
  ... the world is wide , and intelligent thought will readily supply an unlimited number of well-sounding names which do not suggest the character of the operation or disparage it in any way and do not enable some widow or mother to say that her son was killed in an operation called `` bunnyhug '' or `` ballyhoo . '', 
  proper names are good in this field . 
  the heroes of antiquity , figures from greek and roman mythology , the constellations and stars , famous racehorses , names of british and american war heroes , could be used , provided they fall within the rules above . 
  and indeed this practice is continued down the line in the modern day . 
  prior to the invasion of panama lieutenant general thomas kelly and general james lindsay had a conversation in which they discussed renaming the operation from blue spoon to just action before settling on just cause . 
  it seems that as time went on operation names - at least for american military , became a means of telling which command of the military is leading the operation . '', 
  each command of the u.s. military is given a series of two-letter prefixes . 
  the first word of every operational name must start with one of those prefixes . 
  for example , the u.s. africa command was allowed to choose between three groups of letters when naming the libyan air campaign : js-jz , ns-nz , and oa-of . 
  by choosing od from the third list , they arrived at the word ` odyssey ' . '', 
  to bring it back around to the question at hand : operation names were first used by the german military in the last two years of world war i but have since grown , developed and taken on different meanings . 
  i imagine different militaries have different rules behind their operation names but the above focuses solely on the united states ' armed forces .

  aha , so i was right . 
  cheers mate . 
  you mentioned you did n't see the junction jan 's picture in game , but it is there . 
  i ca n't recall how to trigger it but i remember it happening . 
  we were never his ` bros ' but we were - and still are if you ask me , a community . 
  totalbiscuit is a celebrity of sorts yes , but he still treats us well , not individually no , he does n't know our names or who we are but he makes sure that his videos are of top quality so that we have top quality videos to enjoy and in turn make him a living . 
  i wo n't go into the major over-arching story but i can tell you about the connections between dote , el and es . 
  in dungeon of the endless the planet the ship crashes into is aurigia and that ship holds opbot . 
  afaik this is n't the vaulters ' ship but it did arrive there in much the same way the vaulters did . 
  obviously in endless legend we have the vaulters who are in endless space if you bought endless legend in alpha . 
  also in the vaulters ' story opbot is , again , mentioned . 
  aurigia is a planet within the universe if you own the disharmony dlc in endless space , and in the descripition of it opbot is mentioned . 
  and , like i said , the vaulters are a playable faction there if you bought el in alpha . 
  therefore the major connection is the vaulters and opbot . 
  many thanks / u/brokennoggin , i like your analogies to the us by the way . 
  there 's something so satisfying about slowly turning the map your colour . 
  i wonder if we 'd be equally entertained by colouring books ? 
  i 've noticed references to the it crowd thrown around quite a bit on reddit and i 'm curious if the majority of those people are from the british isles or elsewhere . 
  i agree that if this was a serious survey that should be the optimal title , but i 'm just interested in a broad-overview more than anything else . 
  your advice will be kept in mind in the future , though . 
  just personal curiousity . 
  i 've noticed a lot of references to the show on reddit and imgur and i was wondering where it was most popular - this gives me a bit of an idea to that . 
   edit : after all those upvotes i 'm imagining full platoons of serbian army striking trough paris with drop pod capsules , kek . 
  ... i want an x-com mod for this now , is that bad ? 
  i love seeing the welsh survive in the game , they add a bit of colour to the british isles . 
  isle of mann , it looks like they 're northumberland green , and unfortunatly northumberland is n't actually celtic - or at least not part of the celtic league . 
  it is n't , but it still gets highlighted green . 
  the twist is he 's left handed . 
  / r/frisson is a bit iffy lately with all the sad posts , but i agree this is the place for it . 
  [ much happens during the weather ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaafjkojqhc ), 
  i agree completely as well . 
  i mean the monolith in ep .58 ( i have n't listened to 59 yet so shut up ) would be pretty strange to those who picked up there , and for the sake of op i wo n't say anymore on what happens in the episode . 
  i 'd argue that the irish war for independence was rather succesful . 
  a brief civil war later and much of the process to freedom was peaceful . 
  except , obviously , the whole situation with the troubles , but if we 're counting success as the state of the entire country as opposed to reactionaries within it then i 'd call it mostly a success . 
  i suppose you raise a good point there , the key theme is - as you say , that in belgium , ireland and the us they were n't trying to kill their government , just be free of them . 
  a double-medic train can be extremely effective . 
  i recall once me and a random medic ran around the map healing each and melee'ing anyone who came too close , and it worked very well . 
  however i would certainly not recommend it as a legit tactic all of the time . 
  what 's it like being a risky click ? 
  does it pay well ? 
  aw man i 'm so sorry , i was you could transfer jobs or something . 
  i might add that guild wars has a strong roleplay community , if that 's what you 're into . 
  anet does n't usually prioritise us but we get by . 
  piken square is the eu rp server although that matters less with the new mega server . 
  either way i 'm sure you 'll love the game !, 
  [ caro emerald might finally get this fabulous drunk in the air ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qadsw5_dzew ),
