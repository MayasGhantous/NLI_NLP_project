  either way he 's getting an angry mob outside his door . 
  which reminds me ... has anyone seen my hurley ? 
  who 's this candlejack everyone keeps talking about ? 
  i 'm a little out of the lo, 
  your question is on if a tree falls at all , regardless of there being an observer present or not , however i 'm going to tackle the question of whether or not a tree falling * without * an observer - ie listener , present makes a sound :, 
  this ultimately depends on your definition of ` sound ' . 
  arugably yes , the tree falling and striking the ground * does * call the particles of air to vibrate but if there is no ear to turn those vibrations into sound can it truly be sound as we know it ? 
  on top of that , it 's impossible to prove that these air particles do actually vibrate ( though they most likely do ) when they 're not observed , because the only way to prove that they do would be to observe them , thus ruining the ` no one around to hear it ' aspect of the investigation . 
  just to give my extended opinion on this :, 
  if autofellatio was a homosexual act then surely all forms of masturbation performed by the self ( ie not oral sex or foreplay ) would also be homosexual acts and yet many people do not see it as such . 
  i do n't know , just a thought , good survey op . 
  surely though , as / u/condimentorice said it 'd be ` autosexual ' since it 's yourself . 
  wait , we use the ' . ', 
  in europe do n't we ? 
  like 46 point 7 years would be 46.7 for me . 
  i thought it was america that used ' , ', 
  yeah , i live in ireland so maybe it has something to do with that ? 
  all i know is for me 1,200 is ` one thousand , two hundred ' and 1.200 is ` one point two ', 
  huh , well there you go . 
  cheers for clarifying that . 
  gyazo users unite !, 
   have you had bad experiences with buying early access game ? 
  this question feels very weighted as , aside from the other option , does n't allow for you to say no . 
  ireland was actually at war with denmark up until recently . 
  ireland was under england during the second anglo-dutch trade war , and since the danes supported the dutch that made ireland and denmark at war , however when the war ended the two countries never signed a peace treaty and remained technically at war until some old laws were changed in ireland late last year . 
  the way it works is :, 
  * the emperor will get it if he has more than 5 ( ? ), 
  provinces, 
  * if not the emperor then a neighbouring country with a royal marriage will get it, 
  * if no neighbouring countries have a royal marriage then it goes to any country with a royal marriage, 
  * if none of the above is true it goes to castile, 
  which means unless you have a royal marriage with him you just got very lucky boy . 
  i suppose when it 's most of the world simplifications can be forgiven . 
  for example i hardly expect them to show the difference between the free-state of ireland between 1921 and 1948 and the republic of ireland from '48 onwards ( though it would have been nice to see ), 
  ah well i focused on europe myself so i did n't notice that . 
  major things like that are less forgiveable , i agree . 
  all those speeders look very clunky and just odd to me also . 
  i do n't understand the whole ` using the phone during class ' thing . 
  i know here you pull out the phone to maybe send a text during class and you 'd be lucky to get away with long enough to browse reddit . 
  oh college ? 
  given the state of the posts i assumed most people complaining were , themselves , in highschool . 
  college is a different story all together , obviously . 
  i roleplay on a regular basis both inside and outside of dnd , so perhaps i could be of assistance :, 
  the way i see chaotic anything is that you 're unpredictable , you 're not random , you 're unpredictable . 
  you do n't stick a teapot on your head in a tavern because ` lolrandom chaos ' but you might say , choose to torture the townguards your party found captured in the bandit camp for information if you have evil leanings . 
  in another situation where you 're chaotic good you might choose to walk past the townguards ( again with these guys ) telling you you ca n't enter the town because hey , you 're chaotic , you do n't believe in the law of the land anyway . 
  basically ` chaotic ' should reflect to how you go about things : chaotically ; unpredictably . 
  while a lawful character will respect the law , and a neutral one will be indifferent a chaotic character tends to disregard the law , they are not without morals , but that does n't make them often unpredictable . 
  if i may , what was so bad about the writing in the new trilogy ? 
  i 've never bothered to watch them because of the awful reputation they get . 
  are those books worth it ? 
  the monster manual sounds really cool but they 're about $ 35 each . 
  well , so far i 'm the only person here who takes long showers without wanking . 
  what do i do in there ? 
  stand there enjoying the heat . 
  have you ever been to sauna ? 
  well if you have you 'll know it 's really nice to just sit back in the heat and relax . 
  now imagine that but standing up and also washing yourself at the same time and you got basically what i do in the shower . 
  i also spin around a lot , as i 'll switch the water from my back to my front then forget i 've done so already and do it again . 
  wanking in the shower just seems a bit awkward anyway , you 've got all that aforementioned water and heat afterall . 
   [ if you 're interested ... ] ( http://www.historyanswers.co.uk/history-of-war/how-coca-cola-won-a-place-in-adolf-hitlers-heart/ ), 
  that was a great read i have to say . 
  it 's kind of a shame that you did n't include the picture of g\u00f6ring drinking a coke that you mentioned a bit down . 
  it 's the sci-fi equivilent of a ` macguffiin ' is n't it ? 
  it 's a shame you could n't find it !, 
  great read regardless . 
   empathy has downsides . 
  check out the rn philospher 's zone podcast on empathy , it 's a really interesting listen . 
  does it affect ironman ? 
   tv or movies because i find the interactivity of videogames more engaging . 
  i find the interactivity of videogames more engaging as well ( bearing in mind i can sit down and watch a movie though without having to get up ) it 's just something about having agency in the medium that makes it so much more entertaining . 
  someone want to explain to me what 's going on here ? 
  i 'd love something like the [ schipol airport diamond heist ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amsterdam_airport_schiphol#incidents_and_accidents ) where you can sneak into an airport , steal some diamonds in transit and maybe defend a runway while a small cessna lands to take the diamonds and leave . 
  he was making an entrance, 
  `` honey !, 
  frank agrees with me ! '', 
  `` of course i trust his opinions ; it 's frank ! '', 
  i thought i was on / r/awwducational for a while to be honest . 
  this is great , i 'd love to see somebody actually sing it . 
  is the can so they can eat them or to knock them out ? 
  indeed i believe so . 
  i 'm going to guess it 's a british uniform . 
  the germans used boots while he seems to be wearing those wraps around his shins the british seemed to favour . 
  beyond looking at his feet and comparing his footware with the british , belgian , french and german uniforms i honestly could n't tell you for certain . 
  i see welcome to nightvale is leaking . 
  ahhh caro emerald 's the best . 
   if it 's something that needs to be said and might offend some people , fuck them , say it, 
  the phrase that 's commonly thrown around here is ` you have the right to be a bigot ' and i completely support . 
  if we deny people the right to say certain things then where do we draw the line ? 
  who are we to stay that insulting muhammad is n't cool but insulting a politician is ? 
  if you go by the basis that you can censor offensive imagery to the deceased it 's only a matter of time before people try to exert that same logic on offensive imagery of the living etc. 
  i have a friend whose surname is ` lambkin ' and it 's not because her family was shepherds , but rahter quite the opposite : they stole sheep . 
  the problem is this already happens with the ai . 
  if they occupy a province they want and you do n't give it to them in a peace deal they get really pissy at you , this should work both ways . 
  ** 1/5th irish : ** as an ( north ? ), 
  american nation conquer an irish province, 
  ** all 's quiet on the western front : ** as france own the entire belgium/low-lands region and be in peace for four years . 
  ** sweden is not overpowered !, 
  scandinavia on the other hand ... : ** as scandanavia own the entire northern coast of europe . 
  ( ( let 's say brittany to estonia ) ),
