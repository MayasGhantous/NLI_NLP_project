  thing is the fragment was a lot closer to the fight than i thought and the robots guarding the fragment ran away as it came into view . 
  easy pickings . 
  well i 'm irish and i live in ireland , i think it 's rather self-explanitory . 
  telltale games the walking dead, 
  i had a closer look at the just the two engineers and yes it would appear they are embracing each other ( i know i would ) , it is comforting to know they did n't die alone . 
  and for those who care a nice little close up picture if you want to see yourself : http://gyazo.com/790dd58c500590c2ac43c639f472efc9, 
  i too am here to watch people complain or otherwise mentioned ( myself being the latter ) about it not being called prime minister here in ireland ^ even ^ though ^ it ^ is ^ essentially ^ the ^ same, 
  pissing in public urinals . 
  i do n't know why but it just always feels kind of weird . 
  i hate when people say `` awkward silence '' the second everyone stops talking , it was only a second !, 
  it was n't awkward yet !, 
  the achievement is called ` the mann-tastic four ! ', 
  to be honest , it is valve , it would n't surprise me . 
  shhhh brother/sister ... you will be fine ... we are here for you now ... 
  there was a great post by an english ( i believe , he was definatly european ) about america 's gun policy , and i stand by that . 
  i ca n't find it unfortunatly but it essesntially said that here in europe , we get on fine without guns because we never had same right and do n't see it as a loss of freedom and that because it is n't for normal people to get guns , petty robbers ca n't get them either . 
  tl ; dr : i 'm fine without it , thanks . 
  i 'm not a twin but i heard this amazing story about a pair of twins in my school . 
  sit down children and i 'll tell you the tale . 
  according to my woodwork teacher these two twins , both took the two main practical subjects in my school : woodwork and metalwork , however the first twin , we 'll call her jessica , prefered woodwork and the second twin , we 'll call her april , prefered metalwork . 
  apperantly they looked extremely alike so they would actually switch classes ( which would be on at the same time ) so jessica could do all woodwork and april all metalwork . 
  i do n't know how much truth there is in this but i like to hope it 's true . 
   as an analrapist, 
  it 's the 11th month ; the 12th day , of the [ 20 ] 13th year . 
  you know ... as opposed to saying the 12th day of the 11th month of the [ 20 ] 13th year, 
  i 'm proud of you ireland * sheds one manly pcmasterrace tear *, 
  yeah !, 
  * high fives gamedevc *, 
  game over , man !, 
  game over !, 
  * lasers , man, 
  * in all seriousness i like they way they have more advanced weapons than the other factions, 
  * i personally like their colour scheme, 
  * i like the way the focus on technology, 
  * i like what they stand for, 
  other than that the reasons i like them are ones i can not put into words . 
  i would just spam the ammo voice call out . 
  whenever i play engineer , and some shouts that i 'm over there asap - that is some nice free xp right there . 
  because reasons, 
  in all seriousness i imagine the idea is that the exault ground forces have no notion of tactics or are ordered not to move without the word from command . 
  i always assumed it was they did n't move at all , but their guns reloading is still something . 
  i nearly got caught in the london bombings . 
  thanks to the fact we choose to go on the later day to legoland - the tickets were valid on both the day of the bombings and the day after , we choose the day after but almost choose the first one , because of the time that would have put us most likely on the exact tube that was blown up . 
  all i can say is ^ . 
  the ending will ( should ) explain everything commander . 
  we will be watching . 
  * jumps through the portal after okashu * i 'll be with him, 
  they could do it like the new foundland mission . 
  one ( or any ) of the squad members places down a beacon and then you run like fuck back to the skyranger . 
  i think that first crushing defeat is a step stepping stone on the road to becoming the best commander . 
  wait , was your major douglas a sniper ? 
  awww i had a major douglas as well , sniper , mimetic skin could run around exault without ever being spotted , he also had the ability that made half-cover into full-cover . 
  i personally love ps2 . 
  but i hate everyone going `` o : mfg made the game so much faster ! '', 
  i had no change . 
  raise my fps and we 'll talk . 
  i 'm surprised fireaxis did n't call the new x-com ` sid meier 's x-com : enemy unknown ', 
  this is why they call it enemy within, 
  play eu first if you buy them at the same time . 
  i 'd recommend buying eu first , playing through it then getting ew, 
  i never said either were hard . 
  i just feel you should play through eu first so you to get experience the game without the addons and get the full benefit of what the expansion adds . 
  yeah finger-tip grip !, 
  pushed against the back left ( i 'm left handed so i use my left hand to move my mouse ) of the mouse . 
  someone give this man gold . 
  both when :, 
  * my dad started refering to me as one, 
  * i could shake older people 's hands without feeling embarrased ( i thank my taekwondo teacher for that ), 
  also he resigned as a judge because he could n't `` bring himself to sentence people to death '' what happened to that ? 
  was n't it like 3 weeks before hitler realised it had already happened ? 
  i love punching down walls , once i found out there was two mec sized holes in the next two walls ( one in each ), 
  they 've finally snapped . 
  that 's vater , but it 's close . 
  ** edit : ** vader is father in dutch according to google translate so do n't take my word for it . 
  rogue legacy had an amazing soundtrack . 
  it captured the retro style it was going for but remained upbeat and/or humorous , the battle music was espically epic . 
  then there 's that one random guy who comes in and slaughters everyone , ruining the moment . 
  i 'm curious as to what the world actually is now . 
  hey baby , they say i 'm a pretty good infiltraitor ^ i 'm ^ sorry ^ i ^ had ^ to, 
  from what i can gather the canopy over the car collapsed after the roommate moved the car . 
  * the two characters are staring at a screen playing old cctv footage of black friday incidents *, 
  `` what are we looking at [ insert futurey sound name here , like i do n't know - x , yeah let 's go with that ] ? '', 
  `` an ancient tradiation called ` black friday ' '', 
  `` you 'll have to explain it to me ; the 21st century is n't an area i study much . '', 
  `` that 's quite alright , [ we 'll call him y for sake of refrence ] . 
  you see , y , black friday was , as i said an ancient tradiation . 
  back in the time when people ran shops they would prepare themselves for this day . 
  for on this day , black friday , the consumers of the past went wild , as if they had suddenly contracted rabbies or gone beserk - '', 
  `` rabbies ? '', 
  `` we cured several centuries ago , i wo n't bother explaining it ; you should get the idea from the context . '', 
  `` if you say so , x. '', 
  `` where was i. . . oh yes . 
  the consumers became an unstoppable force . 
  the ` cashiers ' as they used to be called where the consumers ' target . 
  the faster the cashier could scan , announce the cost , recieve the money and pay out the change the quicker that particular rabbid consumer would leave , slightly reducing the chaos . 
  one by one the consumers would flock out , but at the same time more consumers would rush in , maybe even twice as much . 
  they even injured each other , the consumers . 
  they truly were crazy . 
  and only the cashiers could in anyway reduce the chaos they caused . '', 
  `` but why x ? '',
