  i look at pictures like this and ca n't help but be a bit speechless . 
  i mean , this is a robotic craft that * we * pust on other celestial body taking pictures of the sun from angles our ancestors could have only dreamed of so that we may view them thousands of kilometres away from the location at which they were taking , truly astonishing . 
  as an irish participant i am fully in favour of drunkeness and potato pelting . 
  can you imagine a 32 province ireland though ? 
  that 'd be crazy . 
  i think it comes from the eye being the symbol for nightvale , the third eye i mean i do n't know about the tattoos . 
  the great thing about ziggurat is that you can save at any point so you do n't have to get through the whole ziggurat in one sitting . 
  where eu4 ends victoria 2 begins , what you 've suggested is by and large victoria 2 , and i do n't think the eu4 mechanics suit a vic2 style game . 
  what makes the period you 're on about so interesting is the countries struggling to modernise while dealing with a more political conscious population . 
  war changed from armies rushing at each other to large trenches firing across the field at each other . 
   they do not encompass new unit changes , and especially the implementation of aircraft and armoured field units such as tanks, 
  again eu4 is ill-suited to dealing with aircraft and armoured field units , which is why we have vic2 . 
  i understand * why * you 'd want a game that flows seemlessly from the 15th century to the 20th but i just feel this would be too large an undertaking . 
  that said though you should * really * check out vic2 because it sounds like something you 'd be into and pick up vickymod for it while you 're at, 
  once i discovered the depth of eu4 i could n't go back to civ5 ; it just was n't the same . 
  civ lacks the trade management i 've come to love , the political manuvering , the grand wars . 
  in eu4 sabotaging someone 's reputation can be disasterous , in civ denouncing someone is no more than a piss in the wind . 
  so yes , i have had a problem playing other strategy games . 
  1 day, 
  i do n't know why but the hansa are my favourite nation . 
  * woosh !, 
  and reddit is really fond of this . 
  if someone did n't get the joke there 's no reason to downvote them into oblivion and go * woosh !, 
  * because that 's just salting the wounds . 
  now , i do think it 's acceptable on those askreddit threads like the spainish one were people are collectively trying to make the same joke , but beyond that it just annoying . 
  i tried to respond to this on my phone but then it started leaking blood and the screen went black . 
  ... i think this actually kind of cool ... annoying to clean up ... but cool . 
  wait wait , this is n't / r/slavs _ squatting ? 
  everybody knows a glorious european swallow is much faster than any other swallow . 
  good on you , i despise re-scumming , it just feels very gamey . 
  the banner saga has quite the interesting story , told in a very graphic novel-esque form . 
  [ platinum group metals ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/platinum_group ) are a big one, 
  * ahem * it 's the plow thank you very much . 
  i believe [ this ] ( http://satwcomic.com/questionable-invasion ) is why, 
   you only ever hear about the bad ones, 
  the word of the day is ` confirmation bias ', 
  another example i 'm fond of is people who narrowly escape death and claim a dream foretold it . 
  no , the countless other times you dreamed of drowning or being shot or dying in a car crash never foretold anything . 
  just because you * happened * to dream of falling down a flight of stairs the one time it did happen does mean you have psychic powers . 
  and this is n't even drunk science, 
  i saw craic dealer live and i have not laughed so much in my life , even while watching his recorded stuff . 
  ehhhh what 's this from ? 
  the kirov ` bomb it all to shit ' strategy was the best strategy, 
  for a minute i thought the game was literally called `` capitalism ho ! '', 
  i 'm really getting annoyed of the `` is this propaganda '' comment in every other thread . 
  if it 's meant to spread information and promote a point of view ( regardless of good or bad , though usually bad ) then it is propaganda . 
  kebab , uniting families since long before 1444, 
  situation out there is quite brutal . 
  the irish navy ship present ended up bringing an extra 410 migrants to sicily after already rescuing the intended 200 . 
  dishonoured had a great intro because in a few minutes it managed to set up corvo as the royal protector in this fantastic palace and then completely take all that away as he 's framed and cast out . 
  very interesting to see the inclusion of the easter rising into a summary of wwi . 
  i 'm irish myself so that 's why it 's nice ( and as aforementioned , interesting ) to see :d, 
  he 's just going to plot to murder you instead op , so enjoy the karma while it lasts, 
  forgive me but what map mod is this ? 
  i recall seeing one very like it but with the colours so muted it was impossible to tell certain nations apart , this on the other hand is quite nice . 
  cheers, 
  well as a general rule of thumb you should n't drink anything in the lab in case whatever was last in the beaker/flask/whatever was deadly and still present in small amounts . 
  well you 're a bad scientist if you 're drinking from it in the first place to be fair . 
  it was actually great . 
  except for that one where i went to the cinema with myself , that was kind of lonely . 
  where 's your medical license ? 
  brojobs are great, 
  making movies of course . 
  yes and no . 
  it seems that the british did send spies and agents to the united states but it does n't seem that they were there to spy on the us per se . 
  rather the [ british security coordination ] ( http://spartacus-educational.com/spybsc.htm ) were tasked with bringing the us into the war . 
  generally speaking the bscs efforts attempted to ` drag the united states into [ the war ] ' ( winston churchill to his son ) by spreading propaganda explictly aimed at making the us populace want to join a war on the side of britain . 
  one such example of this is the book [ ` sequel to the apocalypse ; : the uncensored story : how your dimes and quarters helped pay for hitler 's war ' ] ( http://www.merriam-press.com/sequeltotheapocalypsehowyouhelpedpayforhitlerswar.aspx ) . 
  the book was written by rex stout , george merton and sylvia porter of the new york post after a bsc agent , donald maclaren employed them to do so . 
  it 's worth noting here that george merton himself was a bsc agent . 
  the bsc contained such members as roald dahl and ian fleming who - among with the other agents , were tasked with `` clandestinely promoting british interests in the u.s. while also working to undermine remaining isolationist attitudes in american politics and society '' the bsc was founded in 1940 when winston churchill became prime minister and at the time neither russia nor america were in the war against the nazis . 
  it therefore makes sense that the brits would employ agents in an attempt to coax the americans into joining them in their war against the nazis . 
  sources : [ on the head of the bsc ] ( http://www.britannica.com/biography/william-samuel-stephenson#ref224007 ) , [ on their founding and operations ] ( http://spartacus-educational.com/spybsc.htm ) , [ number 4 shows roald dahl and ian fleming 's involvement in the bsc ] ( http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/6-people-you-didnt-know-were-wwii-spies ) , [ the aforementioned propaganda book written by the new york press on behalf of the bsc ] ( http://www.merriam-press.com/sequeltotheapocalypsehowyouhelpedpayforhitlerswar.aspx ) . 
  i was n't able to find anything on the us ` spying ' on the brits or conducting operations on british soil , but according to the cia 's own site the office of strategic services was n't founded until june , 1942 at which point the british and americans were firmly fighting on the same side . 
  heh , i quite like the qoute actually . 
  i may hang onto it for future use . 
  well i was under the impression already that the fire on the spies ( / jarate/milk ) would still be visible, 
  wait wait , you 're telling me people did n't do that already ? 
  in my last session the party 's warrior rolled a one on attacking a death dog standing beneath a tree so the dog dodged , he got his axe caught in the tree and caused a branch to dislodge and smack him in the head . 
  was n't there a similar tactic used in the sengoku jidai ? 
  i ca n't remember who it was but they had a hill fort with very little men inside so he had one of his number light the braziers on the walls and throw open the gates while banging a big drum . 
  edit : yep just found it , tokugawa ieyasu was in a battle with the takeda and after losing a fight to the famous takeda cavalry charge fell back to a hill fort with just five men . 
  the above happened which caused the takeda to stop in their tracks and wonder what was going on before hattori hanz\u014d and a band of ninjas were sent out to sow chaos amongst the takeda . 
  it 's a rather scientific fact that big drums make everything at least 40-50 % more badass . 
  is this going to be like the sunset invasion in ck2 then ? 
  thanks for clearing that up . 
  i assume by the song.txt file you mean the one document in the music folder with :, 
  song = {, 
  name = `` kingscourt '', 
  chance = {, 
  factor = 1, 
  in it ? 
  you 'd probably get a better response over in / r/answers or / r/explainlikeimfive op, 
  the cheese and onion flavour of crisps ( see : chips for those of you in the states ) was invented - along with the modern method of flavouring crisps , by an irish company called taytos . 
  so there 's a random fact that you might not have known . 
  alright . 
  thanks a million kite . 
  thanks man, 
  [ to expand on that point ] ( http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/pages/communityimmunity.aspx ), 
  it looks kind of like an aerial shot of a wheat field or something,
