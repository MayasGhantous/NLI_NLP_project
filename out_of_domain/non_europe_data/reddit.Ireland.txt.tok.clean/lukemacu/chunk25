  praise be unto the god of all machines, 
  just so you know , the lusitania was sunk in 1915 , after the war had started . 
  it was important for the us joining the war , but it was n't a cause of the war itself . 
  if we 're talking about german blunders , it could be up there , but it was part of a larger unrestricted submarine warfare campaign so it was hardly uncalculated . 
  i 'm sure it is you , friend !, 
  the dog would n't lie like that, 
   ( her choice not to marry was a very risky diplomatic move that ultimately paid off spectacularly ), 
  i confess i do n't know much about elizabeth , could you explain what you mean here ? 
  thanks !, 
  aside from ai ( which you 've mentioned to be among the biggest threats to humanity ) and nuclear weapons ( also a threat but less so now , so you 've said ) , what do you feel would be the worst tech humanity could develop that would almost certainly lead to its extinction ? 
  or canada is the next super power, 
  nurgle is one of the chaos gods ; one of the big baddies if you were wondering, 
  my current party showed up to the big city in the current part of the world they 're in , wanted to pop into a nearby shop to pick up some stuff and that shopkeep quickly became one of their favourite characters , even though he was just completely random . 
  they 've met his kids and everything .

  there 's an old castle near the town i live in which has a pretty storied past to it . 
  one of the owners of it ( though i 'm not sure if he ever actually lived there , as the castle was quite old at this point ) was the man who incited the first catholic rebellion against the british ( the names escape me now , but i can always get them if anyone is interested ) . 
  unfortunately , said castle is locked away on some farmer 's land and is an awful state . 
  shame really . 
  pre-famine ireland boasted a population of about eight million . 
  this number was halved during it ( both due to death and emigration ) and the numbers have never really been that high since . 
  if the british never controlled the country and there was no major famine as a result , the population would likely be higher than it is today but nowhere near the size of the british population i would imagine . 
  yeah that 's exactly my point . 
  i am agreeing with you here , just also trying to make it clear why / u/shitposted _ 666 was likely making that claim . 
  ah yes , fianna f\u00e1il , fine gael and finn poem . 
  finna poem really does fit in, 
  could have had a ` socialist countries not allied with the ussr ' section , for the sake of interest . 
  the cold war was and was n't about economic systems . 
  it was about global dominance and power plays on the one level , but those ideas were tied into economic systems . 
  there was this idea in the us of the ` domino effect ' , that if one country fell to communism , so too would its neighbours , and then their neighbours and so on . 
  one could argue that the us did n't want a country to fall to communism because a communist country was more likely to ally itself with the ussr and similarly one could argue that the red scare was just propaganda to justify the cold war to the populace but the fact remains that the economic system of a country was tied into the power plays of the period . 
  there 's buddhism making its way up the silk road , i wonder if it 'll reach china before it breaks again ? 
  thanks for the link !, 
  i had a quick search of the subreddit but could n't find anything , so i 'll be sure to give it a read . 
  also irish here and i often see the ` irish exit ' brought up but in my experience if you 're mostly sober and leaving early there 's a fair bit of chatting to be had , particularly with the host . 
  i did some digging around the internet , and try as i might i can only find a couple of potential sources for this . 
  it seems that we do n't know where the phrase exactly comes from . 
  it is possible that the phrase originated after ww2 in america , refering to the fact that many soldiers returned from the war missing one or more of their limbs ; the ` price ' of the war for them was their arms and legs . 
  one article discussing this phrase that i found cites a december 1951 issue of the * the long beach independent * as one of the oldest appearances of phrase . ^ 1 another article i found cites a decemeber 1949 issue of the same paper as one of the oldest appearances of the phrase . ^ 2 that 's only mariginally useful however , as it does tell us that the phrase existed after 1949 , but it may have existed long before that in more colloquial usage and indeed does n't give us any clues as to the phrase 's original origin . 
  another possible origin discussed in those articles is that the phrase is a reference to older expressions . 
  expressions like ' i would give my right arm ' and what have you . 
  it is plausible that the phrase sprung from those older expressions , though i am dubious as no other article i could find seemed to discuss that . 
  i would urge you to take what i say here with a pinch of salt , as i can not vouch for the validity of those sources . 
  however , there is n't much to go on as the origin of idioms is often vauge at best .

  i always had it in my head that venus was more on the scale of mars and mercury as opposed to earth itself . 
  hard to tell but it 'd say it 's [ this lovely lad here . 
  ] ( http://www.irishmoths.net/pages-moth/m-1991.html ), 
  not sure , they 're native to this country generally but maybe the conditions out west have been particularly good for them lately ? 
  that 's why you need to wear the special glasses . 
  to add to this , the coast of ireland was dotted with [ signal towers ] ( https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/ireland-s-napoleonic-era-signal-towers-1.1253929 ) during the napoleonic era . 
  these signal towers would alert the others if they spotted napoleon 's ships coming to land an invasion and though they did not use fire the principal is largely the same . 
  if any one tower saw an invasion incoming , it could call to the others for aid as it were . 
  so the idea of beacons - though not necessarily beacons of fire , does not seem to be one crafted by tolkein . 
  mine is one where their drill was at about 25 % and i just kept jumping around them as raeyln while their gnaw had me posioned . 
  i would have died if we did n't destroy the drill at the very last second . 
  mine was when i was sneaking up to a fragment and i could hire gun fire in the distance , i looked over and saw two robots having a duel or some kind of fight . 
  i ignored it and pressed on . 
  thing is the fragment was a lot closer to the fight than i thought and the robots guarding the fragment ran away as it came into view . 
  easy pickings . 
  i bought the gold edition of civ5 during the steam summer sale and i adore gods and kings ( yes i have played without it ) and all the other expansions . 
  but i 'm not sure if it 's worth paying more than i did for all those for one expansion . 
  i think it 's safe to say that you all know how to work a computer , but i find that it 's commonly assumed that because you are older you have no knowledge of technology , but i 'm curious to see if it has ever happened to you . 
  during the covert operation extraction in which you have to hack the terminals central will often say : `` it also appears to have disrupted exault radio communications temporarily as well '' or something along those lines , but what does it actually do ? 
  according to philosphy . 
  ** edit : ** yes the theroy is call solpsism , thank you , i could n't for the life of me remember it . 
  i was planning on getting some station cash there over the weekend and read the post with br100 guy saying how it was a waste to spend sc on weapons . 
  alright , i 'll take his word for it . 
  but what i want to know is should i even bother with the armour camo ? 
  you know , did the nazi 's see it as `` once a jew , always a jew . '', 
  much in the same way the british crown sees it was `` once a catholic , always a catholic . '', 
  i understand there is a civfanatic forum post about this but i ca n't seem to access so any help would be much appreicated . 
  pretty much , does the whole `` you only remember what you studied when listening to music when you hear that song '' work without the actual song playing a loud , but in your head . 
  ok , so maybe it is n't my place to say this . 
  i did just subscribe less than a minute ago , that said , a subreddit for left-handed gamers could be useful . 
  i 'm sure many of you have had times when you just could n't find a comfortable set of key bindings or a game did n't let you rebind keys . 
  here we could show each other bindings , help each other out or if it 's a game like starbound which - at the moment , does n't have keybinds we could tell our fellow lefties how we got around it . 
  like i said , i do n't know . 
  perhaps it is n't my place to say , but nonetheless i would a subreddit for that kind of stuff . 
  hello everyone . 
  i 've deicided to begin saving up to build my own pc . 
  i currently have a decent rig but i wanted to build my own gaming pc . 
  to that end i want know , is it worth getting a gtx 770 when the 660 is a fair bit cheaper ? 
  note , i 've set my budget for around $ 850 - $ 1000 . 
  thanks . 
  all caught up in this huge web . 
  first of all , i 'd like to apologize if this is n't your standard post , but this is something that 's been bugging me for a while now . 
  i often see posts on this subreddit ( very good posts mind you , ones i support ) but the majority of them seem to refer to affairs in the united states . 
  so , would someone be kind enough to inform on the situation at hand here in ireland ( or at least europe ), 
  the reason i ask this is because i was in school the other day , when one of the teachers mentioned there was a program for fourth years called `` awareness '' which was naturally to do with rape , sexual abuse and the like , and was completely limited to females ( actual words ) . 
  now i understand this , awareness for girls should be unique to girls , but there was no similiar program from males . 
  which naturally got me thinking , how much of what is mentioned on this subreddit have i been missing close at home ? 
  thanks for any information you can give me and please , forgive my naivety . 
  ** edit : ** thanks to / u/richbl and / u/alphawookie , you were a great help . 
  i also ca n't deicide whether or not to buy an ice-cream/cold drink or a hot chocolate/coffee/tea . 
  hey everyone .
