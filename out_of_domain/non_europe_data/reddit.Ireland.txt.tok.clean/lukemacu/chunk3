  `` because on that day , there was no tax on any of the goods . '', 
  this is a comment , i like comments , and free stuff . 
  yes , i feel we would also, 
  * random muttering *, 
  grave news !, 
  operative : laurent laurent has been killed in an exault attack, 
  cause of death : rocket to the face, 
  unit in question : exault heavy assualt, 
  memorial service : when the war is over, 
  yeah , unfortunatly the rocket also took out four of my best men . 
  one of my remaining decent snipers ( the covert operative ) got killed by a panic -  mechtoid overwatch . 
  so i had to restart , i did name a medal after him . 
  we will never forget you laurent laurent !, 
  yes but is it vengeful vengeance ? 
  anything that is repetative and can easily be done by a machine ( cashiers are one example ), 
  you should , to me vengeful vengeance will always be an xcom thing . 
  i 'll be honest , it can change rapidly . 
  a few weeks back the temperature was between 2c and 9c , the next week it was back up to 10-14c . 
  a friend of mine even has a term for when the weather just goes all over the place , he calls it : `` irelanding outside '' , but i digress . 
  when it comes to apartments i ca n't help you but i would recommend getting at least : a pair of gloves , a scarf/snud , a rain coat and a more material jacket just for keeping warm . 
  yep . 
  god do n't you just love random showers ? 
  anyone reminded of ready player one by ernst clide ? 
  ... you 've punched a wall , shouted at your squad , broken your keyboard , and are still playing . '', 
  do n't be afraid of restarting, 
  half life 3 confirmed, 
  that too . 
  well you should buy winrar because you do n't get that pop thing at the start telling you should buy it . . and ... and ... say ... would you pay for it ? 
  just for me ? 
  ok maybe i did buy it , but that 's not the point . 
  the point is you should buy it to . 
  and we can be people who bought it together . 
  hate on the game ? 
  have i been missing out on something ? 
  and my favourite thing about fc3 has to be , without a doubt the story ( oh and the kicking the hornet 's nest mission ), 
  you 'd be surprised what some tech that i consider primative which you consider advanced can get you if you give it to the right people . 
  `` your voice is amazing '', 
  i 've had several friends and acquaintances tell me this . 
  he might just be renting it . 
  well yeah , except for that . 
  maybe you could rob a shop or something . 
  i 'm sure if tell the cashier it 's for the steam sales he 'll be ok with it . 
  i have to agree with this . 
  i have a pc , i love my pc . 
  unfortunatly i did n't build my pc but it gets the job done . 
  that said i also have a console , and sometimes i enjoy taking up my controller and playing some console games ( ok yes , i also use my controller on my pc but shhh ), 
  of course i do n't use it for shooters ; i 'm not some kind of idiot . 
  if you could make minecraft on one other planet ( you know make it look like mars ) what one would you pick and why ? 
  * intense staring has begun *, 
  not my first name but my surname , watson, 
  `` hey , wats ... on . . [ tv/or whatever ] '', 
  it 's pronounced watsin * smashes a table against the wall *, 
  the gun hitler used to kill himself . 
  i personally believe every stereotype ( country stereotypes ) was true at some point if it is n't now . 
  make sure `` what does the fox say ? '', 
  never happens . 
  tl ; dr - i have a lot of american friends even though i live in ireland, 
  ** solved ** i feel like an idiot :d, 
  they 'll never see it coming . 
  * checks steam library *, 
  other than the ones you 've mentioned :, 
  * guns of icarus online, 
  * sir , you are being hunted, 
  ** edit : ** removed telltale game 's : the walking dead, 
  well . 
  * removes it from the list *, 
  i have a school near mine ( well it was new but they moved recently ) and i had a friend who attended it . 
  it honestly sounds like a mcdojang to me ( i just wished i had came up with the name first xd ) , they have to pay for pretty much everything . 
  when i play c/i i just avoid council missions in general . 
  i 'll probably do them after i complete my first c/i run but for the time being i 'd like to just finish it . 
  when editing the mod/map in the modbuddy there is a section called ` tools ' on the top , click on that and the first option should be `` upload to steam workshop or something on those lines . 
   this is why they call it enemy within, 
  if a man does his best what else is there ?

  ** edit : ** not an inspriational qoute but i love it : `` when coding with c if you make a mistake you shoot yourself in the leg , when coding with c++ it 's harder to make a mistake , but you blow your whole leg off . '', 
  - icantremember, 
  also that 's a paraphrase , i do n't remember it word for word . 
  i do n't think it 's from the same angle . 
  what 's the hardest trick for you to pull off ? 
  / r/imgoingtohellforthis and any other subreddit would be interesting . 
  `` ok , here 's the team . '', 
  `` what can they do ? '', 
  `` well , that one over there ? 
  that 's reddit ; he 's the middleman , bit of everything him ; he 's going to be the one doing the heavy lifting . 
  that one 's ` wiki ' he knows everything , some people do n't trust his info , i do though . 
  then we have gyazo , man is killer at getting pictures , does n't matter what you need a pic ' of , he 'll sort you out . 
  then there 's deviant , woman will draw you a picture or a plan does n't matter what it is off . 
  she 'll draw up plans like none other , sometimes they come out a little ... well ... let 's not dwell on it ... might not be the best team , but it covers everything we need : heavy lifting , information , pictures and a good plan . 
  from top to bottom :, 
  `` oh my god watch where you 're driving '', 
  faster than light travel , it might not be original but hey . 
  the first thing that comes to mind is roguelegacy ( yes i know 90 % of my posts on this subreddit are about rl , shut up ), 
  i 'm not sure why ; it 's definatly not my most played game . 
  but something about just sticks with me . 
  like i said i have n't played a lot of it , only about 13-14hrs . 
  but it 's just the gameplay and the humor that just keep my coming back to it . 
  so , i tried this . 
  and it did n't work and no i have no potatoes ; - ;,
