  just a stupid gaming pc and a lot of saved money . 
  i was out walking my dog with my dad ( who 's an athiest ) and he was explaining the idea of deism to me . 
  and i guess something just clicked , i finally found a belief that made sense to me , and i 've stood by that ever since . 
  i feel yahtzee should be on this somewhere . 
  you know , the person who coined the phrase : `` pc master race '', 
  yahtzee uses consoles because his laptop catches fire most of the time when he tries to play a pc game . 
  according to one of his more recent videos he is : `` inching my way back toward pc gaming because i 've noticed a crazy hobo sitting on the other end of the bench with a kinect lodged in his forehead '', 
  yeah , i ca n't for the life of me remember which video it 's from though . 
  victorian england could work , i ca n't see assassin 's creed : vikings working though . 
  well , vikings are n't really the assassin 's type . 
  ok , i know what you 're thinking : neither is edward , that said , i ca n't invision * any * vikings being pirates . 
  people * not * taking the piss out of askreddit threads . 
  i never said they were n't a good naval power . 
  my point was they 're not the assassin-y type . 
  ** edit : ** adendum : i realise i said `` any vikings being pirates '' i meant any vikings being assassins . 
  i too am here for the faceswap . 
  poor grammar , such as the above , does by no means imply low intelligence . 
  what does imply low intelligence is the poor grammar coupled with idiotic statments . 
  yeah i can see how this makes sense . 
  to be honest it never occured to me that what you would be attempting to use the same part of the brain at once . 
  thank you . 
  i like to call us english ` simplified english ', 
  i support this . 
  the vanu 's whole ` tech ' thing does wear off really quickly . 
  i play with screen lock . 
  i just watch the map every second i can . 
  when running to lane i 'm focused on the map , i try my hardest to glance at the map , i listen to my team ( generally where in a skype call ) and i seem to get on just fine . 
  having screenlock off just makes it too overwhelming and distracting . 
  1 ) borderlands 2 - i find it hard to describe without just restoring to saying : boring . 
  the shooting was decent , it played well . 
  but that was it . 
  it felt to me that the major selling point of the game was the sheer amount - and i 'll give credit where credit is due that is an impressive amount , of guns in the game , and the humour . 
  i found each weapon was gradualy worse and better at the same time , there was no `` this is better '' sense . 
  the humor was n't very , well humorous . 
  it felt a little forced . 
  2 ) dota 2 - i really wish i could give a proper explanation like the one above , but i really ca n't . 
  i 'm forced to merely say : i prefer league . 
  i feel i may have just gotten a bad impression the first time i played dota 2 as i went in alone as with league i had friend hold my hand . 
  lots of `` what do you think the world will look like in 3099 ? '', 
  posts . 
  i * hope * it will be more advanced . 
  i agree with the graphics statement . 
  and no , i do not mean `` graphics make the game '' i mean ra3 looked horrible . 
  ra2 was much more atheistically . 
  ra3 went all cartoony . 
  also , ra2 is just a generally a better game . 
  same here . 
  ra2 was miles better then ra3, 
  `` that does n't look safe sir '', 
  `` does it look like i care , soldier ! '', 
  spy and sniper and medic and ehh ... 
  all of them . 
  i believe - citation needed here , that iron is easier to shape than bronze , thus making iron the more efficent crafting material . 
  literally 90 % of everyone one about irish people and ireland . 
  i like this idea , but i think for the revolution leader 's to be effective you could make them go incognito while in enemy civ 's territories , but only for a few turns , meaning you have to make a mad dash to the city and ca n't just have them walk about all day . 
  you could also give the option that when you place a spy in your city you can assign them as either `` counter-intelligence '' or `` secret police '' the secret police would detect and stop revoultionary leaders and maybe even stop ( or at lessen the chances of ) the public from changing ideaology . 
  yes , yes it would . 
  yes , so much yes . 
  i personally like the idea of being alone , drifting through space . 
  cork because it 's cork , also what / u/shineese said . 
  you know , i can get strawberries here in cork , but i think i 'll still with just the having * great * knackers here in cork . 
  you mean we 're not ? 
  ... you do n't know how great of an idea that is . 
  going to say something that no one here has mentioned yet , but should all agree with : stay away from the ` knackers ', 
  here on reddit we may seem nice , but not everyone in ireland is . 
  in everyone town , in cork or not , you will find knackers . 
  they 're just generally not nice people . 
  you 'll come to recognize them straight away but they usually hang out in groups and wears hoddies and stuff - side note : try not to get knackers and a group of young friends out havin ' a laugh mixed up , if you get friendly with someone ( which you will ) have them point out some knackers for ya sometime , and you 'll quickly come to recognize them . 
  true , true . 
  what do you feel about everyone saying that dayz is n't zombie survival , but bandit survival ? 
  america , period . 
  personally what made me good was a lot of time spent in tf2 . 
  i was only decent when i started playing , but it was such a good laugh i just going back , and now i consider myself quite good . 
  in skyrim there was a small , not quest , but story i guess . 
  it involved finding a killed adventurer with a journal . 
  which lead to a cave a bit up stream with more dead adventurers and stuff . 
  small , but memorable . 
  itt : nice try [ name for police ], 
  nsfw in ea maybe . 
  this comment deserves gold . 
  it really does , i do n't have the money but / u/stussyu know that if i could i would gild this . 
  it 's four euros ? 
  this is my favourite glitch . 
  i love it when it happens . 
  using the map maker , very easy . 
  ** edit : ** if you wanted to put in every civ , then things get complicated , but an entirely flat map should be easy . 
  no actually . 
  it comes with civ ( at least when you buy it on steam ) , you only have to download the sdk, 
  my avian character with the tier goggles that make him look like a mad scientist . 
  or as i like to call him `` gilvus , da bird man '', 
  ireland : `` where the grass is green , it always rains , and 90 % of everything you ever heard about us is bollocks . '', 
  did n't read through the whole article , but i did see `` gaelic for '' the language is irish , not gaelic . 
  it 's gaeilge in irish but gaelic and irish are two different languages . 
  right , that 's all i have to stay . 
  away !, 
  true . 
  that said , if we 're to say that german should be called ` german ' in english as opposed to deutsch i feel we should call it by its ` english name ', 
  ok ok , you got me there :3, 
  my only annoyance ( other than the one / u/lemonlimeallthetime mentioned ) is that in dishonored they did n't date the days like we did . 
  there was no `` august '' month .
