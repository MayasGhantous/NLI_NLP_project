  at least , not what i say from the books . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  we 'll break down when we want to . 
  lidl : you know you 're just here for the cheap chocolate, 
  i too am here to say how much i want these to be weapons . 
  i laughed harder than i should of at the supervalu one, 
  alright , i 've got some more . 
  aldi : the other lidl, 
  xtra-vision : we 'd appreicate it if you bought something this time, 
  tg4 : just turn back over when the english speaking shows finish, 
  vodafone : trying to play an online game ? 
  hehe fuck you . 
  ireland seasons :, 
  spring : rain, 
  summer : rain with maybe a day of sunshine, 
  autumn : rain, 
  winter : rain with galeforce winds, 
  bit of a side question : the motherboard you recommended there , the asrock . 
  i have to say i 've never heard of them before and i 'm a bit skeptical ( espically with the price ) , i just need a bit of assurance that it is in fact a decent motherboard . 
  like everyone gets seriously fed up with a specific agency ( like maybe the nsa ) or something and decides to do something . 
  without actually going to war with them that is . 
  pretty much a non-violent revolution or some kind of rapid change . 
  probably around then , yeah . 
  first of all , i 'm going to go out on a limb here and assume you believe i 'm an american , i 'm not . 
  second of all . 
  i 'm talking on a global or at least in-a-large-amount-of-countries scale here . 
  offtopic , but i 've never seen an askreddit thread ( at least not in a while ) where the op actually replies . 
  i commend you sir . 
  at the moment , the day ( s ) i spent in liverpool with my dad . 
  he 's still alive and well , but this is the first trip just me and him went on where i was old enough to really appreicate it , we both had a blast . 
  my apologize . 
  either way i commend you . 
  the phobia you should never look up . 
  and to save the curious i will not say it . 
  this i agree with . 
  i can be not an atheist and not a catholic . 
  there are other religions out there . 
  hello eddie , i watched your force majeure tour on dvd and loved it . 
  what i want to know is that , well , i noticed you tried to do some jokes on the fly and messed up . 
  then you proceeded to take the piss out of yourself . 
  when did you stop caring ( if you ever cared that is ) if you messed up and just rolled with it ? 
  how deep does this rabbit hole go ? 
  i 'm working off the showerthough from a few weeks ago that stated it . 
  whether or not what you 're saying is true i have no idea . 
  we could start a war over this y' know . 
  itt : reminds me of lego !, 
  the best way to deal with a jerk ai is to eliminate them . 
  i recall once playing as russia and eventually got set so far back by a neighbouring germany that i had restart . 
  alright , i 'm going to give a * serious * ireland one - even though i loved yours . 
   ireland, 
  ** mock everyone including yourself ** - morale boost ; raises nearby the squad 's will , espically when the situation turns bad . 
  ** could you be a little more serious please ? 
  ** - -5 % aim, 
  `` hey guys , i need food [ insert heart-warming story of survival ] if you could send help , that would be great . '', 
  yes people were saying that , despite the creator of eotl stated that they would n't . 
  also , in response to your comment / u/hackein the very same creator of eotl said it would focus solely on weapons . 
  i 'd love to see the follow up . 
  i got the beard one for the heavy . 
  goes great with the soviet gentleman and the graybanns ^ tm, 
  same as my zombie apocolaypse plan . 
  to the naval base !, 
  convince them to take me aboard/steal the ship if they 're dead ( hehe not going to happen ), 
  sail into the ocean , use reverse osmosis machine for water and fishing supplies for food . 
  you still owe me a tenner . 
  and my flashlight . 
  you 're right , they 're the colours of every flag ( you know if you start mixing ) are n't they ? 
  * ** iron working : ** i feel like i 've reached a certain milestone, 
  * ** currency : ** because markets, 
  * ** industrilization : ** bnw idelogies , that 's why, 
  * ** atomic theory : ** ehhh ... reasons, 
  am the only one that thinks [ this guy ] ( http://gyazo.com/acc65701528cb682393f75b89046f1d7 ) looks a lot like [ this guy from la noire ] ( http://static4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110124173407/lanoire/images/7/7c/rusty_galloway.png ) ? 
  there are giants in the game , they just do n't spawn naturally . 
  1xx : male operative 's are to stop refering to female operative 's ` time of the month ' as their ` berserk mode ', 
  i have to agree with 4 . my taekwondo instructor always mentions that , he even goes so far as to call it `` the dirty tricks department '' ; do what you must , stamp on their toe , kick to the groin , strike to the throat does n't matter , just stun and get away . 
  ** side note on the wallet thing : ** he also says that if it comes to it , that you think just dropping the wallet wo n't be enough you can generally throw it at them : they 'll have what they want and you 'll have a few extra seconds to run . 
  i agree with everyone saying `` watch what you say '' that said , ten years for something which , well i 've heard comedians joke about worse , is crazy . 
  * lives in ireland *, 
  / r/askreddit : `` i did n't , but my [ relation/friend ] did . '', 
  / r/imgoingtohellforthis : admit it , you laughed . 
  / r/markmywords : we 're actually psych , honest . 
  / r/showerthoughts : embrace the power of the shower . 
  well we 're out of death, 
  hahahaha no . 
  first of all , i hope you enjoy cork . 
  second of all , as someone who has been learning irish for 10 years now ; you * want * to learn it ? 
  if you ask me it is a waste of language . 
  but , that 's just me . 
  third of all , well , i 'm just going to copy this from another post i made ,, 
   stay away from the ` knackers ', 
   here on reddit we may seem nice , but not everyone in ireland is . 
  in everyone town , in cork or not , you will find knackers . 
   they 're just generally not nice people . 
  you 'll come to recognize them straight away but they usually hang out in groups and wears hoddies and stuff - side note : try not to get knackers and a group of young friends out havin ' a laugh mixed up , if you get friendly with someone ( which you will ) have them point out some knackers for ya sometime , and you 'll quickly come to recognize them . 
  right , that 's all i have to say on the matter , i hope you enjoy your time here . 
  definatly . 
  no , of course not . 
  yes that description is very general . 
  but it is the best way to describe knackers to someone who does n't already know what they are . 
  someone care to tell me what this ` hidden movement ' is ? 
  have they finally made it so aliens move around before you spook them ?
