  ah , alright . 
  i was hoping it was an announcment thing . 
  i 've asked my instructor this before and his response was : `` it 's a display of skill mainly . '', 
  i agree , mvm players can be the worst . 
  maybe he is actually one of us . 
  maybe he is here , right now . 
  that is an amazing idea . 
  this is so breathtakingly accurate . 
  i love this , your little comments on the top made my day . 
  ... is that really all 2014 has to offer ? 
  i have to say , i 'm not very impressed , or excited . 
  while i think op brings up a good point i do agree with what you 're saying . 
  yer always seemed to me like an assassination tool rather than a sneaking around one . 
  get behind them , pick off key targets , maybe sap a sentry , hold the disguse for as long as you can for maximium damage , and get out . 
  indeed , i believe so . 
  i like this idea , i agree with the lack of headshots but we could do say ... 
  this :, 
  + body shots to already on fire enemies do extra damage, 
  - fires tracer rounds, 
  - no headshots, 
  i do n't know , that 's just my way of seeing , i like the idea though . 
  care to explain what the '78 incident ' was ? 
  the difference between rl and ds is i feel the devs of rl actually like me . 
  i like this idea , except the tracer rounds thing . 
  this feels like a yer equivalent in pistols , purely assassination . 
  therefore i think the tracer kind of ruins that . 
  thank you kindly gents ( goes the same for you / u/ponxha ), 
  i personally hate using adblock . 
  but the day ads started rolling out from places where there were n't ads , when they started dropping down from the sides of my browser i had to get an adblocker . 
  i 'm fine with a space for ads or ads before videos but as soon as they start appearing where they were n't , that 's where i draw the line in the sand . 
  if i could disable those and keep your ads up i would but for now that is the only solution . 
  also the effect you 're talking about , where when more people vote their vote matters less is called the reverse tinkerbell effect . 
  what weighs more , a pound of feathers in a bag or a pound of bricks in a bag ? 
  - the bags are both the same material, 
  ** answer : ** the bag of feathers , because you need a much larger bag . 
  i 'd like to remind everyone that the mercanaries are crazy rich . 
  that is all . 
  i. . . i. . . 
  * sigh * [ just take it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ksncklw.gif ), 
  hitting someone with a huntsman when you 're just taking pot shots at them, 
  most dogs do have shadows , yes . 
  and this is why you do n't use capes !, 
  do you think you 'll get your own squad after this ? 
  when does engi say that ? 
  during payload ? 
  ahhhh that makes sense . 
  he 's got dibs guys , back down . 
  burning sensation is the best name for a medic weapon , ever . 
  i laughed way too hard at the end , i actually hurt my throat slightly , that is all . 
  i 'm pretty proud of my lego car . 
  i recall reading somewhere that german pows in ireland also intergrated with the community , but these ones were forced to return to germany , do you know anything on the matter ? 
  i actually use two of the weapons on this list \\ o / ( jag and vitasaw ), 
  growing up with only a sister , i have no idea what this is . 
  it 's seperating the master race citizens from the peasants . 
  depends on the achievement . 
  espically with a steam display case i 'll sometimes go for the more difficult achievements that are within my skillset . 
  i do n't go for 100 % though . 
  that said , i love the feeling of getting achievements . 
  espically when it 's one that requires effort ( not just reach story point x ) and i achieved it without trying . 
  i 'm going to say payday 2 because i 've been playing it recently so it comes to mind . 
  to me , payday 2 is an example of mechanics and narrative through gameplay done right . 
  the game itself is n't overly complicated at least control wise . 
  many buttons are situational so learning huge amounts of key commands is not neccassary . 
  what little story there is for the jobs is mostly told during a briefing at the start but you really get a glimpse into this crazy world as you do the jobs . 
  to top it all off it 's fun . 
  simple as . 
  sometimes you feel like a badass criminal mastermind other times you get your ass kicked by the police , but the game is n't unfair ( most of the time anyway , those glowly-eyed spec op guys are just crazy ) and it has some geniunily interesting mechanics . 
  i 'll take my vr headset and haptic gloves along with the bleak power-lacking dystopian future to go please . 
  do n't fucking remind me . 
  ** deus ex : human revolution - director 's cut **, 
  i 've been meaning to pick this up for a while and i finally got around to it . 
  an all around fun title . 
  should probably play more though . 
  ** guild wars 2 **, 
  i 've mostly been roleplaying with my guild . 
  do n't need to explain that . 
  a friend of mine actually gifted it to me monday and i 've clocked ... 9 hours . 
  needless to say i love this game so much . 
  i find myself too distracted to say anything else other than that it is fun : go play it . 
  i do n't think i even have to say anything here . 
  this looks amazing , i ca n't wait until i get my new computer and can finally run s , yabh without issue . 
  same here , it 's bearable but it 's a bit of a turn off . 
  you raise a very interesting ( and in my opinion , valid ) point there . 
  but i 'm curious , in the example you used you had the partner sitting there next to the person , but what if they were n't . 
  what if instead the partner was - still a friend , but over the internet so you can only hear them , would the sense of assurance be lowered then ? 
  science is always legit . 
  there 's this one great book called `` the feckin ' book of irish history '' , i sent it over to an american friend of mine and he loves it . 
  great irish humour and history ( if i remember it also covers some myths , but mostly history ), 
  links :, 
  great to hear !, 
  i read all of that , bloody hell i was not expecting such an amazing comic . 
  i was n't ready for a story this powerful . 
  amazing game . 
  and it has to be filled with bullets . 
  now 's our chance to slowly turn this subreddit into a more popular / r/irishproblems, 
  shall we gather for whiskey and cigars tonight ? 
  ( great cosplay by the way ), 
  quick !, 
  i need to think of a question that was n't asked ... 
  what 's your favourite ice-cream ?
