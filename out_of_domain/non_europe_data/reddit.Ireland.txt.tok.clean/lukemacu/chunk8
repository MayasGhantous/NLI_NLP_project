  its amazing how quickly people adapt , not only was the situation handled so quickly but the dragons soon became as close to normal as they ever would . 
  to this day no one has managed to tame one and no one knows where exactly they came from , but the good news is that dragon eggs have been spotted , and they offer the best chance we 'll ever have of domesticating them . 
  dragons still sometimes escape over the border , but they 're brought down faster than a hijacked plane headed for a major structure . 
  i ca n't deny that it 's a nice title to have : `` one of the first people to see a dragon '' at the same time though , as amazing dragons are , part of me wishes all this never happened . 
  the piece on snipers relying and headshots and spies on backstabs is very accurate , as a lot of my time playing sniper i use jarate on passing enemies to help out my team , or as a spy i 'm drawing fire ( if i have deadringer for example ) or sapping buildings . 
  getting headshots and backstabs is only a portion of the role . 
  i could n't believe it , years of work thrown away in an instant . 
  i had lost everything , my house , my source of income , my reputation all gone because of that bloody stock market . 
  i did n't know what to do , any friends i did have turned their backs on me long ago , i began to stumble around the city aimlessly and for the first time ever i felt alone . 
  i mentally searched my memories for anyone that might take pity on me , if even for a little while . 
  i walked into the city 's park , partially to find somewhere quiet to think but also to map out some places that i could sleep tonight . 
  i mindlessly sat down on the first bench i came across . 
  i sat there for what must have been at least a quarter of an hour before i realised that i had a chance . 
  there was one person who might help me . 
  i stood up , the bench below me creaking loudly as i did . 
  i started on my way toward their house , my feet dragging as i went . 
  you could make it from the park to their house in about 20 minutes if you were quick , but my sluggish pace brought me there in 30 . 
  their house was in the suburbs . 
  it was a quaint , thin two storey house with mute red bricks on the ground floor and bright cream colour walls on the first floor . 
  i made my way up the short driveway and hesitated a moment before i knocked on the door . 
  at first their was no answer , and i debated turning on my heel and finding somewhere to sleep and beg for money when the door creaked open a crack . 
  '' ... what are you doing here ? '', 
  the voice behind the door said . 
  `` hello paul - '' `` hello paul ? '', 
  the door opened some more and i could clearly see the man standing behind it , `` after all these years - after all you 've done to me , you think you can show up on my doorstep with a ` hi paul !, 
  how 've ya been ? ', 
  '' his voice was stern and his expression hostile . 
  `` listen , paul , '' i paused and waited for him to chew the head of me again , `` i know things between us have been bad recently ... but i considered you my friend once , and well , i 've gone bankrupt paul and i need your help . '', 
  i saw a smirk building in his expression . 
  `` not so high n ' mighty are ya now ? 
  that 's what you big shots never understand ; you spend all your time trampling over us , the little guys , and then when you finally need us we 're not there . '', 
  i stared toward his feet , `` if you help me get back on my feet i promise you i 'll make it all up to you somehow . '', 
  i felt his hand rest on my right shoulder , `` jesus , alan ... you 're making me seem like the bad guy here . '', 
  i looked up and meet his gaze , `` i 'm not trying to guilt-trip you , paul - '' i stepped on a figurative land mine . 
  `` guilt trip me ! '', 
  he yelled , `` i 'm the one who should be guilt tripping you !, 
  i 've done nothing wrong here . '', 
  i hung my head again , `` i 'm sorry , i should never have come here . '', 
  i began to turn around , `` i 'll just go ... '' `` alan , wait . '', 
  i rose my head but did n't turn to meet his gaze . 
  `` listen '' he continued , `` you 're not a good person , you 've done some bad things in your life . 
  but i still believe in redemption as much as i did when we were friends . 
  i 'm willing to give you a second chance , alright ? 
  but i 'm going to be in charge in our ` partnership ' from now on , i 'm not going to let you walk all over me again . '', 
  this time i turned to face him , `` i ca n't thank you enough ... '' `` just do n't make me regret it alright ? '', 
  i nodded at him and felt myself become overwhelmed by emotion and sniffled . 
  `` come on alan , do n't break down on me , just come inside . 
  i 'll get you some tea and we 'll think about who we 'll get you back together and on yer feet . '', 
  once again i nodded at him and continued to walk past him , i felt his hand on my back and i suddenly did n't feel so alone anymore . 
  you know i was just thinking about that , why could n't more parents be like and just say : `` right , soon enough - if you have n't already , you 'll discover this thing called masturbation or fapping , and it 's one of the greatest things ever . 
  i highly recommend you try it but just do n't do anything weird ok ? '', 
  agreed . 
  and to bring it back around to the original point : if i can kill someone with just my flame-thrower i 'm not going to take some round about route to airblast them off a cliff or whatever other strategy you want to mention . 
  i once built the great library sticking out of a mountain , so certain wonders can be built on mountains , do n't know about the pyramids though . 
  case in point . 
  oh yeah you 're right . 
  i ca n't think of any off the top of my head ( machu pichu maybe ) but i 've seen pictures of some odd placements of those . 
  damnit man i was drinking water when i read this , i did n't intend on almost proving the point . 
  yes i changed both of them , i also made sure both of them match up . 
  unless you live in japan . 
  i 'm like 90 % sure the age of consent there is like 14 . 
  ( a little offtopic but ) i 'd like to thank you good pc masterrace member , because on clicking that link and going through you your item showcase i have added dust : an elysian tail to my wishlist despite having previously over looked it , i hope to able to thank you again if it proves to be something i enjoy . 
  i actually got through my first one without much issue , i recommend bringing an engineer with two lots of grenades ( so you know , four grenades ) and a squad-sight sniper with high-cap mags ( allows them to shoot the chrysallids for longer at their safe distance without wasting a turn reloading as often ), 
  focus the heavies , i was once going throw an exalt mission all well and good when half my squad was totalled by an exalt rocket . 
  ** edit : ** i just remembered if your covert operative has that one gene mod that allows him to cloak you 'll be able to sneak him around without ever being shot at , keeps him nice and safe and you can also use it to scout out exalt locations . 
  if you disrupt the comm stations exault comms are disrupt for a turn , basically forcing them to reload . 
  so sending your cloaked operative behind the lines can be a useful tactic to buy yourself more time . 
  even more reason why you should focus those heavies as soon as you see them . 
  * salutes the dead yet brave soldiers *, 
  i printed this out , lamentated it , stuck it to my wall and now i use a whiteboard marker to keep track of the alien scum . 
  it makes me sad that the americans have to fight this battle , my heart goes out to you guys . 
  mostly ... 
  ** x-com : enemy within/long war : ** i 've kind of become addicated to this and i really want to beat it in classic/ironman, 
  ** cs : go : ** i 'm really conflicted with this game , i * want * to like it , but it does n't want to like me , not like in the dark souls or rouge legacy or x-com difficulty where i want to punch a wall and do it again , this is just rage-inducing lagging and yet i still play it . 
  ** endless legend : ** getting off the complain train again i really like el , even for a game in sooo early alpha i love it to pieces , it really feels like a more engaging civ ( 5 at least ), 
  that 's how the sectoid commander finds him , he 's in there , taking a shit and suddenly the sectoid commander bursts through the wall behind him , or maybe he even comes up through the toilet , and then it 's game over . 
  yeah exactly , this was classic . 
  i had 4 cyberdisks , 2 drones and a sectoid commander arrived at once . 
  yeah you 're not looking at 1-3 you 're looking at 4 + most of the time . . 
  i did the base assualt in may which may ( hehe ) have been a bit later than i could have launched the attack , but things happened . 
  yes !, 
  i am very happy the devs put it in , unfortunatly my mec was in sick bay so i was left with my two best snipers , my gene-mod assualt , my best support , zhang ( my best heavy ) and one of my worst heavies . 
  while not a terrible combonation i would have really loved a mec for that extra firepower and tank ability . 
  to be honest my squad wiped two missions after because a sectoid commander mind controlled my mec and my best sniper ( yes the very same ! ), 
  missed two vital shots . 
  but nonetheless i 'm quite proud of myself for making it , not only to the fourth month but also past both the base assualt and defence . 
  maybe next time we 'll get as far as building the hyperwave relay . 
  i made that mistake on my first ever run through of x-com : eu , first sectopod totalled half my squad . 
  the squad one blinked an eye and levelled the rest . 
  not entirely true , i faced all four cyberdisks at once , as in they call came through the door in the same turn . 
  the bureau had a lot of potential and i loved the premise , while i 'd love to see another x-com game ( perhaps one where we find out who the etheral 's bigger boss was ) i would n't mind if fireaxis took another stab at a third person shooter set in the x-com world provided they actually polish this one . 
  i really should go play terror from the deep . 
  i do n't know what kind of primary school it lessons you got , but we did n't get any in primary school , those came in secondary school . 
  that said i did go to a traditional gael scoil ( irish speaking school ) so that might have affected that . 
  guns of icarus is an absouletly amazing game and if you can get four friends together you 'll have a blast . 
  that said the servers are very unpopulated . 
  the last time i checked they had maybe ~ 200 people on and many people are n't willing to hang around in lobbies until a game is made . 
  but i would really recommend it as it needs more players . 
  yes i agree that we should n't get our hopes up until we see more which is exactly my point , as aforementioned i do hower see potential . 
  yes exactly , sledgehammer at the very least is a nice change of pace .
