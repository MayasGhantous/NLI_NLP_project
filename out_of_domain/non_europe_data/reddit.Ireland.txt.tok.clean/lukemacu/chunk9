  commander , the council has found a new bred of thin men showing up in finland . 
  we 'll be senidng you in on a mission there to deal with this very ... finely dressed threat . 
  they learned from the best apperantly . 
  personally i 'm a fan of both type of games but i am a huge fan of the company that made endless space , amplitude and have already purchased both their other games which leads to me think i should maybe go ahead and finish that collection , what do you think ? 
  sounds good , cheers for the advice . 
  i 'm just going to leave this thread and pretend i saw nothing . 
  i have a friend who played eso , i got a testament from him on whether or not you should buy it for another friend of mine , i feel it may help you . 
  here you go :, 
  right , so . 
  first the most egregious . 
  the races are locked behind arbitrary paywalls for no practical reason other than to make you shell out for preorder and legendary editions . 
  the quests are hideously unfriendly to grouping . 
  zenimax has had the nerve to charge a subscription fee and combine it with aspirations of opening a cash shop . 
  the game is simply not good enough to justify a sub fee as it is . 
  it does not feel like an elder scrolls game - it 's connections to the elder scrolls games are thinner than a coat of paint . 
  every mob in the world drops a singular gold coin - maybe . 
  a horse will cost around 42,000 or so . 
  you will not be saving up for one anytime soon out of a necessity to expensively uprade pack space ( per character ) and bank space . 
  otherwise your only option is an imperial edition which comes with free white horses to everyone who throws the money at zenimax . 
  on top of the sub fee , in addition to the basic game price and not counting all of the many other things they no doubt plan to charge real money for in the future . 
  chests in the open world are lovely , but first-come first-serve . 
  fights have been known to cause groups to dissolve over who opened what chest as they do not share loot . 
  loot , in general , is often lackluster and rather boring . 
  crafting is nice , so long as there is not too much competition for the materials - which are again not instanced . 
  bosses in uninstanced dungeons are often being camped by poopsocking players and bots - so if you want anything they drop you 'd best be quick to land enough hits before they rapidly kill it or tough luck . 
  i appreciate your encouragement, 
  what was that sorry ? 
  i could n't hear you over the sound of me buying dust . 
  in all seriousness thank you so much for showing me this . 
  bah you ra3 pleb . 
  i take it back , be on your way . 
  he may still be on his way regardless . 
  just to clarify again , i * did * infact write the review ; just under a different alias . 
  oh yes i agree completely . 
  just going off what you said i too really enjoy the combat ( i also kind of liked the es combat soooo yeah ) it 's very refreshing and as you say you have to properly place your troops for the best outcome . 
  it was definetly made me feel like a general more than any other combat system . 
  to go back to what you said about it being shallow , i blame myself completely for this , there was just so much that i really wanted to talk about without making the review feel bloated . 
  turns out it had the opposite affect and as you say made it shallow , i 'll keep it in mind in the future . 
  it does n't mean that ? 
  i 'm geniunely surprised . 
  i had up until this point gathered from the forums that that 's what it stood for , thanks for enlightening me on that . 
  as for the ` review ' aspect , it 's more of a catch all term for us , i can understand your concern ( ehh ... concern is n't really the right word but you get my meaning ) and i 'll talk it over with the other writers . 
  i also added it to the end of the post as an addendum to clarify for future readers the part about 4x, 
  `` you 're a what now ? '', 
  at which point i explain to them what deism is as it 's not very well known here in ireland , to which the response is usually :, 
  `` oh , fair enough . '', 
  well that 's good to hear . 
  honestly for me i got little to no improvement from the omfg update anyway so it wo n't be much change in that regard ; that actual reason i am returning from my hiatus is because i 'm finally upgrading my pc to something that should run ps2 on more than just borderline 24 fps, 
  i wo n't lie , a lot of the time i stay in this subreddit just for the :, 
  `` shall we gather for whiskey and cigars tonight ? '', 
  `` yes i believe so . '', 
  `` think you 'll get your own squad after what happened last night ? '', 
  those threads are what i live for . 
  shall we gather for whiskey and cigars tonight ? 
  blow off . 
  another night , another patrol with you . 
  right i 'm out of lines but thank you for that :d, 
  damn you 're good at this, 
  in launcher is there anyway to change it so the various parts like ` steam ' do n't drop down when you mouse over them ? 
  ** edit : ** i found out what i did wrong , nevermind . 
  you present me with a tough choice here as i love so many periods of history , the industrial revolution , the world wars , celtic and norman times , the age of exploration , the warring kingdoms era of japan . 
  but i 'm going to say a period i doubt many other people have mentioned . 
  the irish revolution from 1900-1940 , this encapusalates everything from home rule to the easter rising to the war of indpendence and the civil war and a bit of the more interesting politics thereafter . 
  i see some people here saying how she should go to jail and yes , she should . 
  but the fact of the matter is that this is a victory , albeit a small one and by no means the full extent of justice that should be dealt , but a victory nonetheless . 
  i think `` i blame finna fail '' should be the irish equivelant of `` thanks , obama '', 
  i 've had several usernames since i made up the first one , the two i always fall back on though are this one , lukemacu , and colonel_hatch . 
  i 'll give the story for both :, 
  ** lukemacu : ** i 'll be completely honest with you here , i made this username when i was quite young , at the time whenever i needed a username my dad would always let me use his old one , filmacu , so one day i said `` well , i 'll make it my own '' and this one was born . 
  where the ` macu ' parts come from is : my surname , watson , in irish is macuait ( son of wat ) , drop the ait and you get macu as in my dad 's name , make it all lowercase and you get as in my name , tadaa . 
  ** colonel_hatch : ** this name has gone through quite the evolution in it 's time , it started out as just hatch , as my norweign friend told me that my name , in norweign , meant hatch . 
  however when i went to use it in planetside 2 hatch was , naturally , taken . 
  so i went with thehatchman , shortly after i was in a joke skype-text rp with a friend ( the very same norweign one ) when he refered to me as colonel hatch , and it stuck . 
  i imagine it is a case of them not working out the kinks yet . 
  for example by the late game it often costs crazy amounts of dust to buy a solitary unit and i can understand that if everyone was buying units ( to clarify , units not heroes ) from the market except , no one appears to be . 
  unless i , myself buy a unit the list never changes but the price goes up . 
  i imagine in the future we shall see a more dynamic market place . 
  it 's not the price so much as it is the fact i 'm paying nearly a hundreed for one unit . 
  how many birds i 've seen more than once . 
  i loved the original prompt and this was a wonderful extension to it . 
  the :, 
   his eyes widened . 
  part gets me everytime . 
  someday whoever played the peasant that 's always in the real-life peasant pictures is going to stumble upon this thread and see himself as some kind of celebrity . 
  hm , fair enough . 
  i 've done this with other games and i can agree with the logic . 
  as long as they keep supplying breakfest rolls i think we 'll be grand . 
  i 'm not saying some people are n't having problems , but the people complaining also tend to be the loudest people . 
  ya i 'm not a fan of uplay . 
  why i am not a fan of uplay ? 
  it 's not steam that 's all and it never will be . 
  i have n't had an issue with watch_dogs either and personally , i think some people have forgotten that stuff breaks , tech in particular . 
  ** addendum : ** if you are experiencing some technical issue as a result of uplay that makes the game 100 % unplayable 100 % of the time without a visible fix , disregard what i 've said above . 
  as a left handed gamer who plays like a left handed person ( arrow keys instead of wasd ) it would be nice to have a place to share keybindings and in the case of games without rebindable keys ( i 'm looking at you starbound ) methods of getting around that . 
  i 'd like to love this game . 
  it 's a wonderful idea and for the most part ubisoft has executed it brilliantly but i have two major issues both of which have been touched on by others . 
  * the ai is a bit ... eh . 
  when i play watch_dogs i have this urge to try and be like aiden pierce , when , for example , i 'm getting out of my car i always try to park it . 
  when i 'm trying to park it - in a parking space no less , i do not want people shouting ` watch it ! ', 
  when i 'm clearly barely even moving and still on the road .
