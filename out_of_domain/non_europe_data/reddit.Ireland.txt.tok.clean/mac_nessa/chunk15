  yep, 
  rich < 33333, 
  soldier and beast, 
  you , you , son , is that you ? 
  you 're almost kalonian tusker, 
  yes , but they are still hardly a big part of the game . 
  that 's pretty awesome . 
  thanks !, 
  you 're a bit late . 
  yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay !, 
  never thought i 'd be cheering on the french , but by god do i hate chelsea . 
  should the last one not be more like `` all other creatures '' ? 
  hey , that card is vintage playable, 
  yeah i know . 
  of my 4 mm packs i got one . 
  i got to stick up for him . 
  i think he meant mtg books ( but definitely read wheel of time anyway ) . 
  why not run 4 outbursts ? 
  lizardmen are by far the most unique thing warhammer has . 
  not bringing them on would be idiotic . 
  god i hope that 's not true . 
  i never played lizardmen ( well to be honest , i 've not really played much of fantasy , but i have a high elves army i got a year ago i really need to get back to ) but they were always one of my favourite armies . 
  they just felt so different . 
  it 'd be sad to see them go . 
  maybe they are building up to a big `` return of the old ones '' style event after the end times are said and done . 
  one can hope . 
  it 's hardly communist though . 
  it 's the most confusing mix of ideologies you can see ( same with russian neo-nazis ) . 
  gaa matches tend to have a mix of politically-related flags ( like the starry plough flag in the photo - linked with socialism and groups like the inla ) and flags with similar * colours . 
  i 've seen the hill in croke park flying greenland and turkey side by side . 
  my bad . 
  yeah i suppose . 
  i do n't think it would be hard to keep all the special units though ( unless in making a `` catch all faction '' they completely change into something new ) . 
  i also think it was really good for players like me who just started at the time . 
  nothing was overly complicated , it was all easy to pick up , and it was all fairly exciting ( gods , killing gods , gods killing god killers ! ), 
  they are indeed . 
  loyalists are scum . 
  how ? 
  tymaret is a zombie . 
  we do n't have a weak economy , what are you on about ? 
  what land would n't want us , more than half of our population that works works in the public sector . 
  what more could you want ? 
  just being a belfast man this shit riles me up . 
  the specifics of this picture do n't help either . 
  an option to choose more than one would be nice . 
  if you need the karn , then your options seem to be $ 45 or a bitterblossom . 
  which do you want to trade for a karn more ? 
  then you have came to a good place . 
  my ability to guess prices is poor at best , but from what ive seen bitterblossom really doesnt look strong . 
  id be tempted by the trade , but getting more opinions would be wise . 
  edit : althougb karn is getting reprinted so waiing might be a good choice too , depending on whether he will go down or not . 
  there 's so many i like , but these are some of my favourites, 
  [ fifth edition forest ] ( http://magiccards.info/5e/en/417.html ), 
  [ sixth edition forest ] ( http://magiccards.info/6e/en/347.html ), 
  [ portal three kingdoms forest ] ( http://magiccards.info/p3k/en/179.html ), 
  [ asia pacific forest ] ( http://magiccards.info/apac/en/11.html ), 
  [ ninth edition plains ] ( http://magiccards.info/9e/en/334.html ), 
  mate , the salt is real . 
  learn to loose and shut up . 
  not that it makes a difference , but was rtr not large-large-small ? 
  that would be for a foil heath . 
  monty python and the holy grail, 
  why are you not allowed opaque dice ? 
  fair enough . 
  why was storm with seething song banned then ? 
  thanks . 
  uwr control . 
  although something like burn or bogles seems more likely . 
  maybe affinity . 
  well if i remember correctly , the sultai were an after thought to include , maybe they just did n't have enough time to create them as the other clans . 
  `` what would you like to see '', 
  i 'd love to see a full uwr list at $ 75 , i never thought it would happen , hence why i said bogles and burn as well . 
  i also do n't think you can make a uwr event deck without causing either a massive drop in its cards prices , or making the event deck cost a massive amount of money . 
  at that point though , it 's basically `` what deck do you want for $ 75 '' . 
  a basic g/r or g/w zoo could be a possibility , with fetches and some cheap creatures . 
  ( maybe naya if they make it an absurd value deck ) . 
  it 's what i would like to see , not what i think will happen . 
  surely wanting uwr at a $ 1000 discount is reasonable ? 
  yes , but only for me . 
  and they should throw in a few packs of modern masters too . 
  and abur duals , and power nine , and pigs that fly ... 
  `` all of ireland '', 
  eh , not quite mate . 
  not at all . 
  you can post an article , good lad , but this isnt a response to what i said . 
  local lgs hero just beat owen turtenwald game 1 . 
  edit : go stephen !!, 
  i love it . 
  i 've lost to it many a time . 
  and it just wins again !!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  yep . 
  he 's doing the deck tech now . 
  hopefully he makes top 8 and everyone can see it then . 
  i straight up eeked . 
  cryptic command , path to exile , wilt-leaf liege . 
  holy fucking shit that is gorgeous . 
  i need a playset . 
  out of curiosity , why is ireland white and not yellow like the rest of europe ? 
  not at all , actually . 
  both north belfast and fermanagh-south tyrone are knife edge seats ( if i remember correctly , the latter was won by 3 votes ) .
