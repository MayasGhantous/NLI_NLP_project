  here , if you visit belfast you do n't go to the east anyway , so you do n't worry about racism . 
  and the only racism i ever really see is more `` positive racism '' if ye know what i mean . 
  the whole `` you 're indian , you must be good at cricket '' or `` you 're filipino you say ? 
  you 're on my team for basketball '' . 
  that whole shtick . 
  where abouts do ye live though ? 
  we send our shittiest brethren to donegal ya know , just for you . 
  but turkey is a darker colour of grey too, 
  everything that was n't green . 
  every other time people post moher it 's always clear skies . 
  this just seems actually real for once . 
  you should n't be better than antrim though , but he state of antrim gaa in general is a whole other topic itself . 
  there really needs to be more european gps . 
  something to do with gambling laws i think . 
  gaa there is ( and has been for a long time ) in a dire state . 
  they all seem to see it 's the `` agh the culchies hate the city boys and the city boys hate the culchies and it 's the same everywhere '' which is utter bollocks . 
  cork and galway still manage to do well , no matter how much of a divide there is/isn ` t. 
  someone needs to go into antrim and just knock a few heads together , the city/country divide there is just beyond ridiculous . 
  mine is manchester , which is like a 3 hour boat journey and 6/7 hour drive or a 10/11 hour boat journey and a 1/2 hour drive . 
  it affects the payout i think , im pretty sure you can run a gp , you just cant pay in cash prizes . 
  i imagine that would make it really hard to make a profit off it . 
  kerr 's pinks or get to fuck, 
  away with ye . 
  kerr 's pinks and golden wonders , nothing else . 
  agh , ye cant get good mash from anything else . 
  i do n't think a polandball has ever hit as hard before . 
  because every european rivalry has antisemitism , good lad . 
  always see barca fans calling real fans filthy jews and dortmund fans burning the torah in front of schalke . 
  all the time . 
  the worst theme is the cowboy one maro talks about the odd time . 
  communist authoritarian multilateralist bleeding-heart liberal, 
  collectivism score : 100 %, 
  authoritarianism score : 50 %, 
  internationalism score : 50 %, 
  liberalism score : 33 %, 
  avoid the areas the murals are in . 
  what sort of food are you looking for ? 
  i was more thinking are you looking for some pub food ( seeing as you 'd mentioned the morning star ) or a more traditional sit down `` fancier '' dinner . 
  also , how far out of belfast are you willing to travel ? 
  now that i think about it i do n't think i 've ever ate in any of the pubs in town . 
  my da always said white 's was nice , not sure if that 's still true though . 
  are you planning on visiting it ? 
  may i ask why ? 
  it 's a graveyard . 
  green 92 %, 
  scottish nationals 89 %, 
  still not a great quiz but interesting enough . 
  sinn f\u00e9in would be higher if i did n't say stuff like divert funds from trident isntead of encouraging others to dismantle . 
  woud they not be ableto flip as it is an ability of the morph, 
  loyalist marches and republican marches on the same day tend not to go down well . 
  all i wanted to do was to go into town and play some magic . 
  as in the card game , aye , there 's one shop in belfast . 
  the loyalists abstain on the ground that no cards contain a union fleg . 
  i used to find this stuff mocking us funny in its stupidity , now it just pisses me off . 
  they seem like lands that could be easily reprinted , especially with scry evergreen now . 
  it kight be worth getting a playset of each after rotation for the long run, 
  they dont have to be limited to theros . 
  they have generic enough names theh could be printed in most planes . 
  i 'd rather have it in the middle if we had to have it . 
  i 'd guess this is more about his comments on that fucking stupid bonfire than lads just attacking a man because he 's black . 
  depressing either way . 
  that 's exactly it man . 
  cheers . 
  wee girl is from the north , asking if her son born in london is entitled to an irish passport . 
  funny shit too . 
  magic t ** h ** e gat ** h ** ering / rig ** h ** t mega c ** h ** eating ? 
  if you 're going that far just skip portrush and go to belfast . 
  it 's a hole . 
  a bunch of my mates did n't do nearly as well in exams as they 'd hoped . 
  republicans starting trouble with ye for being from the north would n't be very good republicans ( unless yer walking round with a sash and a bowler hat on ) . 
  the ones up here in belfast are the same as they 've always been for what it 's worth . 
  anyone know how the points are done for students from the north ? 
  last i saw an a * was 135 , so even 3 would get ye fuck all courses there when we were told that it was meant to be far easier than before . 
  edit : nope , it 's changed since i last saw it . 
  a is 135 , a * is 150 . 
  but that still means you ca n't get into a bunch of courses . 
  3 a * and an a in your 4th as subject means you still could n't get into dentistry . 
  this is screwy . 
  that was just the first i picked out , its a bunch more too . 
  law , psychology , class civ , archaeology , geography , maths . 
  most of them were all reasonable to get a place in , now are incredibly hard or next to impossible to get a place at . 
  geography at 575 in trinity is 3 a * and an a when a lot of schools up here do n't even let you do 4 a-levels . 
  did india not invade both portugal and hyderabad ? 
  black rose or nightlife by thin lizzy . 
  personally redemption at the puritan 's hand is my favourite by them . 
  well this is the first time i 've ever used it . 
  no other country brings any of them up , which is the thing that confuses me . 
  yeah ? 
  never seen it before . 
  does it come up just on every browser ? 
  harbringer of the tides has helped too . 
  i 'm a rather strong republican , i do n't like this `` northern '' businesses , but the moment you slag our milk you 're all filthy free stating fecks to me . 
  i feel like the only irishman who is n't a fan of aul ' mick . 
  he did n't fight for a cause . 
  he signed the fecking treaty . 
  i do n't get how republicans , especially up here , praise the bastard when he signed away our freedom . 
  if we 'd fought on just a few months longer the brits would have gave in and we could have avoided the last 50 years up here . 
  up round derry has the best chippies . 
  it 's those north-west potatoes , they 're just the best . 
  hurl and sliotar,
