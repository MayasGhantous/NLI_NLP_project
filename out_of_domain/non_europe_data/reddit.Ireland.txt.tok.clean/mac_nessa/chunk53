  having to win your zone in the third tier and then not finishing bottom 5 the next year seems tough . 
  bayern fan or is there a rivalry between you and them too ? 
  sunderland make more than three times our entire league combined, 
  i do n't want to have to play with the english , fine with scotland , thanks . 
  i 'll make sure to go tell pete though, 
  i think we 'd have the ability to hold our own in england with the current squad , and with the money and draw the league has i think we 'd do well after 5-10 years in england , but yeah what a fucking disaster it 'd be if we had one bad season and got relegated , it 's not worth it . 
  and going to aberdeen is bad enough , why the fuck would our fans ever want to go to brighton , bournemouth or southampton . 
  i do n't think my opinion is entirely uncommon with other celtic fans either , i really do n't want us joining the english pyramid . 
  that eibar kit is stunning, 
  such a fucking contrast to last year it 's unbelievable, 
  never really played that much with a team , i was always more into playing gaa and for a time rugby , i guess cus being able to just use my size was much easier . 
  want to get back in to playing five-a-side and stuff when i 'm back in uni, 
  it 's pure class . 
  not sure i 've ever enjoyed football so much, 
  i think most have been mentioned already . 
  i 'd throw in oscar wilde , w.b yeats , seamus heaney , phil lynott , luke kelly ( or any member of the dubliners really ) and christy moore as well for a more artistic twist , although i 'm sure there are plenty of great writers , painters , musicians and poets i 'm leaving out, 
  i 've only owned 1 current kit and that 's this years . 
  probably going to get next years too but it 's beyond sexy like so i feel obligated, 
  i would be interested !, 
  celtic get invited to the epl on the last matchday with their points carrying over . 
  subsequently win the league despite spurs leading since day 1 . 
  basque, 
  surprised with denmark being so low and pork and fish comsumption, 
  it 's not socialist at all . 
  it 's about as capitalist as you can get , there 's no common ownership of these clubs ; not even close . 
  did n't you that marx literally says in das capital that true socialism is actually a college draft system ? 
  you mean the teams are companies buying into a larger company in order to make greater profits ? 
  sure sounds like socialism, 
  so not at all socialism or anything resembling it . 
  got it . 
  top down control is the literal opposite of socialism . 
  like christ how politically illiterate are the people upvoting you, 
  translink, 
  run by a guy who 's in a paedo cult , or so everyone round ballymena says . 
  or at least have very strong links to one,

  those are what i can think of right now . 
  definitely more i want to add , especially some besiktas stuff and more of the marseille kits from the 99 are what seem reasonable . 
  the [ 1999 home shirt ] ( https://www.classicfootballshirts.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/0dc2d03fe217f8c83829496872af24a0/m/a/marseille-99-home-use_3_1.jpg ) from marseille is a stunner imo , so slick . 
  i owned plenty more when i was younger , i have fond memories of a class river plate one, 
  wan na get some new trainers/sneakers/whateveryouwanttocallthem but am lost . 
  thinking some like off white/creamy sort of gats or something . 
  what are you lads wearing ? 
  sinn f\u00e9in majority is coming , mark my words, 
  rodgers in for life tbh . 
  i take back every bad thing i ever said about brendan , that man is a god . 
  quintuple *, 
  the glasgow cup was still a relevant first team competition at the time in scotland too, 
  broony 's going to stab that cunt, 
  spotted the orangeman, 
  c\u00fa chulainn was taken, 
  common everywhere in ulster, 
  yep , tourists can fuck off, 
  has to be leitrim , not even like they 're good at football or hurling to make you remember them . 
  congrats , friends !, 
  happy to see you win . 
  ca n't wait , istanbul would be one hell of an away day, 
  believe so, 
  wet but no raining anymore, 
  the jokes are silly , but it really is forgettable . 
  the only ones that could give it competition for me are laois or carlow, 
  bit weird to block out the lads name when he has thousands of followers on his own one and a big facebook page as well, 
  anyone have any experience with international studies ( taught in den haag but from the university of leiden ), 
  the notorious barrick boys is his page, 
  altonaer is another left leaning club in/around hamburg . 
  much smaller but i 've hear they also have a great atmosphere, 
  you 'll regret any non gerry adams based tattoos for the rest of your life, 
  i 'd choose them over union if i was you ( well , i 'd choose st pauli being a celtic fan but you get what i mean ), 
  the 4-10 spots are so hard with ronaldo , socrates , puskas , beckenbaur , cruyff , eusebio , maldini , van basten and just so many more, 
  shit dembele maybe , but this [ babe ] ( https://scontent.flhr4-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14344843_10157451316075301_2491154592433379186_n.jpg?oh=7bb30ada7ade504e8b35f201bdbaa581&amp;oe=59b4104b ) is best in the world right now no joke, 
  not even sure they 're the worst in madrid, 
  you 've had so many chances at van dijk and not jumped . 
  hard to see him even wanting to go to you at this point , but the top 4 finish is a big boost to your appeal, 
  is this unpopular ? 
  good thing they are n't then, 
  only other person i hear put in the mix is best but that might be local bias, 
  [ phil begs to differ ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsjjy8vomt0 ), 
  five prayers a day , maybe , if it fits in with the schedule , during ramadan are more the types i 've met here in belfast, 
  still does n't mean we should go out banning religions like . 
  just maybe take the whole secular thing a bit more seriously, 
  aye i know , allowing may and cameron in to ireland like . 
  shocking, 
  prods got tayto right tbf to them . 
  freestayto is shite tayto, 
  a big bag of cans with the lads is one of life 's great pleasures, 
  i used to be really picky about beer but i mainly just drink harp and tennents . 
  it 's hard to justify getting a stupid expensive fancy pint when a cheap lager is really just as good as most craft beers, 
  yeah , nearly every craft beer i 've had here has been some shitey ipa that costs like a tenner a pint . 
  plus when you spend 6 months at uni drinking 5 + pints of cheap lager a day , you kinda miss the taste when it 's gone :p, 
  i know , but they 're not what you get where i live . 
  the one 's i have had that i 've liked are n't something you could drink more than a couple of anyway , were as 10-15 pints of harp goes down easy, 
  blegh , so sickly sweet, 
  a proud shade of gold like the proud golden crisps in the beautiful proud bag of beautiful crisps,

  what ?
