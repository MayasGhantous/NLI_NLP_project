  you are correct, 
  ichi the killer, 
  did n't the witch/magae curse dany with not being able to have children ? 
  dany then burnt her alive with herself and the dragon eggs end season 1 ? 
  then he would be a deserter, 
  wuu the giant to ed `` the fuck you looking at ? '', 
  really ? 
  started off as one issue campaign . 
  but as per usual , these movements are hijacked by same crowd and transcends into the farce we are seeing, 
  you are deluded my comrade . . 
  they responded to the massive peaceful march that was held in dublin - not violence, 
  fair enough . 
  and think it 's fair enough to say you do n't condone the throwing of the cone . 
  but could you answer me what was the point of blocking the roads and blocking the elected officials entering/leaving lh ? 
  ( i 'll admit an asterisk attached to `` elected '' with regards some senators ), 
  i 've protested myself in the past for issues i feel strongly about ( cuts to disabled services , pro-choice legislation etc ) , and it is an important democratic right , but do n't see the point in blocking roads, 
  i forgot a spine includes throwing objects at the garda\u00ed, 
  you mean following the massive peaceful march . 
  you 're right that was a success . 
  what does blocking the road achieve ? 
  sweet fcuk all, 
  they could take up `` tap '' dancing ...

  maybe a trial by seven ?

  think the thing we are often told growing up about `` self praise is no praise '', 
  sorry but no, 
  self praise should be the only praise you care about, 
  `` that is literally the worst thing that ever happened shireen '' - [ says ] ( #s `` anyone how has n't seen s05e09 '' ), 
  no ya you nailed it . . 
  but it better than i did ha, 
  i think robb would have listened to cat about marrying the frey girl - but he was furious that she let jamie lannister go . 
  he was also grieving the supposed death of bran and rickon, 
  lower the age of president to 21 ... 
  [ article states he is irish - i do n't get the big deal ] ( http://ihlviv.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/storm-in-a-teacup.jpeg ), 
  the alternative one is horrendous, 
  i used make better jersey 's on the old pes games on ps2, 
  be a while flaying her amiriiiiight, 
  i 've feeling barristan would have been opposed to letting a lannister near dany after jamie and joeffry, 
  saw this on the live stream - myself and house mate were saying he 'd want to get a helmet on moments before he went down . . wo n't get the image out of my head to soon - hopefully he has a full recovery, 
  well i like what i 've read on them so far i have to say . . 
  if there is anyone running for them in galway west they may well get my vote, 
  now is a shitty time to go to belfast . . 
  ya pretty much this , thankfully has n't kicked off like i feared since monday but still alot of tension up there following the parades . . 
  few police officers hospitalised and a 15 year old girl who was protesting one of the parades was hit by a car , the driver is an orange order leader and he is charged with attempted murder . . 
  hopefully does n't escalate - belfast is a wonderful city with a lot of great people but there is still a dark underbelly to found in parts . . 
  `` sinn sinn '' is fun one to say - basically is `` that 's that '',

  he is a fooking ligind, 
  could have done well at glasgow warriors - dan macfarland worked wonders with him when they were together at connacht, 
  i still think keatley should have stayed 2 more years with connacht , rather than sit on bench for munster behind rog would have been starting for connacht in heineken cup, 
  . . almost easy . . 
  with his daughter in jail , i do n't see that happiness lasting, 
  s01 : bronn `` no - but he did '' after trial by combat, 
  s02 : theon `` i 've come to far to be anyone else '', 
  s04 : tyrion `` i 'm guilty of being a dwarf '', 
  s05 : ice king recruiting more `` wight soilders '', 
  is that mr bean ? 
  would n't be like dana white to talk through his hole now would it ? 
  it was clear she did n't know about ronda 's personal history with it - was totally blown outa proportion . 
  rather poetic alright, 
  match went tits up when carty went off . . 
  fully agree about dillane - had a great hour out there . 
  his tackles are ferocious, 
  ca n't say i agree about shane o'leary impressing though - he kicked one penalty dead when going for touch , over kicked another penalty ( although was so bad it bamboozled grenoble players and the bounce did set up marshall 's try ) and did one of the worst restarts i ' v ever seen - barely traveling 2 meters . . 
  he a good option for centre and fb but jaaaayyssuuuss hopefully he does n't have to play 10 . 
  hopefully niyi okay, 
  will you be doing majority of connacht games or was this a one of ? 
  promote synergy, 
  so some fun , family , feel good films then ? 
  [ comedian tommy tiernan agrees ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adrzs2qldhk ), 
  correct me if i 'm wrong - but in the books did n't theon always intend to `` betray '' robb when he returned to pyke ? 
  one of my favorite scenes in season 2 is showing theon writing a letter warning robb of his father 's plan - then hesitating and burning the letter ... 
  jorah still hates ned, 
  got teary eyed when ludwin is trying to convince theon to leave winterfell and join the nightswatch , saying that `` this is n't the man you are '' and theon going `` perhaps not . 
  but i 've come to far to be anything else '' . 
  always been empathetic to poor auld theon . . 
  also got teary eyed when the hound talks to ayra about what the mountain did to him and how his father covered it up - and how the mountain went on to become knighted . 
  `` you think you are alone ? 
  my own brother did this to me .

  this is n't `` oniony '' . . 
  this is just sad :(, 
  golf is britains highest ? 
  must be mcilroy ? 
  i always imagined the reynes as red heads due to the words of `` rains of castamere '', 
  sounds like pucan ? 
  100 % agree - theon is one of my favourite characters in the show . 
  he has basically been a prisoner his whole life . . 
  easy to say he `` betrayed '' the starks but got ta remember he was captive and had been taken away from his family as a child . 
  i know the starks were good to him , and throughout the show they are seen as the moral compass , but he was still their prisoner . . 
  he went home to pyke with the best intentions to help robb ( get the ironborn to attack casterly rock ) and help his family - he negotiated for his father to be given the title of king of the iron islands, 
  his family were bitter towards him so he tried to be someone he was n't to satisfy them ( he even wrote out a letter to rob warning the ironborn would attack the north but burnt it as he wanted his families acceptance ),
