ok i will look them up . 
  my only problem is that they do n't have tabs but i will try . 
  are there any other similar fast paced tunes that i can maybe find on harptabs.com or similar ? 
  does anyone know the name of this song or is it something he composed ? 
  i 'm a beginner and i really like `` hit the road jack '' and `` house of the rising sun '' [ ( this video has the best tabs for it in my opinion ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sinwi1dpekm ) . 
  also i will try to learn [ `` saint louis blues '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho0_ww7qr18 ) but it requires a lot of bending and i 'm not that good at it yet . 
  well ... why not ? 
  sure i 'll do it . 
  but a couple questions : is it ok if i link sources like the ones up in my original comment even though i have not made those videos nor do i own them ? 
  also do i have to post a max of 3 songs or is 4 fine ? 
  if you want i can do week 21 ( july 12 ), 
  since you mentioned taking harmonicas apart to clean them how often do you have to do it ? 
  i noticed yesterday that there was a lot of dust on the comb ( i could not see the reedplates so i have no idea how dirty they are ) . 
  i 'd like to just take it apart and see if it 's dirty or not but i 'm afraid i 'll ruin it/not be able to put it back together . 
  what keys of harmonica do you use the most ? 
  something got weir with reddit to i ended up deleting this comment and posting an identical one . 
  for anyone who was wonderig the question was `` what keys of harmonica do you use the most ? '' . 
  he answered d btw, 
  d is not one that you hear of too often , normally it 's either c or g or a , do you play blues ? 
  never gets old . 
  thanks !, 
  the guy who made the video is great , he has lots of tabs that i could not find anywhere else and they are all greatly executed and often have an accompaniment video . 
  st louis blues is probably one of my favourite tracks for the harmonica , and i never heard of it on this sub !, 
  i never heard of the first one , are there any tabs or have you been doing it just by ear ? 
  it 's not a dumb question at all throat vibrato is not heard of very often ( and it 's also an advanced tecnique ) : [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uthskulv0to ) video should give you an idea of the differences between hand vibrato ( often called hand wah ) and throat vibrato . 
  in particular for the beginner challenge i use hand vibrato and only on longer notes , while big walter horton seems to give a small vibrato effect to every note ( wich i 'm guessing is achieved through troath vibrato ) . 
  listen to his recording i originally linked in the post above and try playing the same notes without vibrato , you will see what i mean . 
  there is no real reason to learn troath vibrato as a beginner , but hand vibrato is a great thing to practice and it 's extremely easy to do . 
  nice , it 's always good to find new players/songs !, 
  never heard of this one before, 
  it may suck but it has a badass name nonetheless , i wish they saved it for a quality harmonica, 
  do you think you could make a small review once you get to play it ? 
  never seen this model before, 
  nice !, 
  happy to see that you enjoyed it, 
  i 'm starting to tab it out now , i can kind of get it improvised , just have to write it down and polish it . 
  it will use bends so i hope you can make them, 
  also i 'm a big bethesda fan , ca n't wait for fallout 4 and even more elder scrolls 6, 
  ok , this is my first rough sketch of what it should look like : ** i had to use a bit of a weird notation ** to indicate when bends are not treated as a single distinct note but more like a smooth transition . 
  like when they tell you to say eee-ooo while drawing to create a bend . 
  i will use / to indicate when this happens , like / -3 -3 ' -3 / means that you should start from -3 start bending and then go back to normal -3 . 
  ** this is written for c harmonica ** because it 's the one that i have on hand atm , it sounds good but it may work better on another key ( maybe ) . 
  the time shown at the end of each line refers to the second video ( solo guitar ), 
  ~ ~ edit : i am improving it with time ~ ~ final version !, 
  i love this song, 
  thanks man !, 
  i love writing tabs for songs i like . 
  get a good song with bends , practice on it and you 'll be bending before you know it !, 
  also youtube videos are a great source for learning . 
  the first time i read it i tought the cat suffered from strokes , i wondered how he could call 911 while it was having a seizure . 
  sonds good , it 's a great song to practice new tecniques on . 
  very very interesting !, 
  i 'd love to see a documentary or something about the industrial process behind making these harps . 
  also til `` tin sandwich '' is the coolest name ~ ~ for an harmonica ~ ~ ever , i wish i could change my reddit username now . 
  i read the first part and got all excited !!, 
  i jumped on my chair and tought '' ** what !!!!! ** '' . 
  but i do n't want to change account , it 's not about the karma ( i currently have 13 comment karma and 1 link karma ) it 's more about loosing all you did all you commented and stuff ... 
  i wish we could have text flairs next to our names so i could be buffmchugelarge ^ tin ^ sandwich, 
  yay !, 
  ** i got a tag next to my name !!!!!, 
  ** [ it 's like christmas !!!!!!, 
  nice , now you can play watermelon man !, 
  wich key do you suggest getting first ( after c ) , i was thinking g maybe ? 
  well i was thinking g because it looks like there 's a lot of tabs written for it and because i was interested in improvising in lower keys . 
  but now that i look at it a has just as many and it 's still lower than c. i 'm comfortable with bending in c. i 'll look around some more and then decide . 
  [ video instrumental ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw4xwud4x0q ) . 
  adam gussow made a good tutorial video on it . 
  i was hoping people started using that name :d, 
  regardless of the tuning ( wich i know nothing of ) you should keepin mind that most irish harmonica music that you will find will be on a site called [thesession.org ] ( https://thesession.org/ ) and it will be in ** abc notation , wich is basically an encripted music sheet ** made to use ascii charchters ( numbers and letters ) so that you can easily copy paste it around the internet . 
  you can use various programs/sites to decode it . 
  what this means is that you will have to learn to read sheet music ( there is a site that can transform abc notation into harmonica tabs , i will try to find it later but it should be linked inside the abc notation official website , i do n't really trust it ) . 
  reading sheet music is not a common skill amongst harmonica players but it should n't be that hard ( although i will admit that when i found out that i could n't use tabs for irish music i gave up immediatly , reading music was my worst enemy when i took music class in school ) . 
  ** to get you started ** [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/harmonica/comments/37cxep/weekly_challenge_5252015_irish_reels/ ) is an old weekly challenge from / u/tamatebako about irish reels , i especially enjoyed the intermediate challenge ( no bends required ) . 
  there is also a song called [ john ryan 's polka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ficm5ewrgi4 ) ( [ tabs ] ( https://www.harptabs.com/song.php?id=9556 ) ) wich again does not require bends ( needs a g harmonica but if you do n't have it it should be fine in c ) . 
  oh and if you like irish music you might enjoy stuff like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zhm_mnqw4a ) , i originally heard it on this subreddit ( [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/harmonica/comments/3b45f5/a_bard_under_a_bridge_blows_a_ballad_about_how_a/ ) ) and the user who posted it sometimes post stuff here , he is very good imo , even if he only plays classical wich is not my favourite style . 
  i remember writing that , it 's the reason why i made this account lol . 
  i was writing my comment so i did n't see yours but i actually linked to your weekly challenge . 
  [ i tought it was the xylophone ] ( https://youtu.be/h03qbnvwx8q?t=227 ), 
  i know what you mean by addiction , i 've been addicted for 2 weeks to that song ... you should probably find help if it lasts too long, 
  paul butterfield is one of my favourites , may i also suggest you listen to [ 9 below zero ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exm1vp-rhh4 ) ( the band not the song ) for some quality rock harmonica . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-vcvot2bre ) the song that has the most interesting harmonica stuff in it . 
  as always another incredible post . 
  i 'm not the biggest classic music fan as i 've said before but i just love all your songs . 
  when you 're trying to whistle do n't put your tongue directly behind the mouth , put it slightly back and down, 
  you can bend whistling just as you do with harmonica . 
  a lot of control over how your harmonica sounds comes from inside your mouth just like whistling . 
  we do n't mind , keep posting !, 
  the shadow over innsmouth is even more terrifying, 
  you do n't get as attached to your hardware , of course building your own pc is great and you can really customize it and make it yours but when i see a ps2 i still think back with a bit of nostalgia to those days . 
  it 's just something you do n't get with pc . 
  edit : i also miss the gimmicks like useless motion controls or laser guns that do n't work, 
  if you ca n't and end up having to buy a new windows copy i 'd suggest r/microsoftsoftwareswap, 
  fry ? 
  like it could break and destroy my whole build ? 
  well , that 's something to consider . 
  i found a good offer on e bay ( a new product not used or anyrhing ) but after what you said maybe i 'll go for someting from a store . 
  do you have any experience with vultech products ? 
  are they any good ? 
  i 'm using a case that i had lying around in my house and it does not have fans . 
  is it a problem ?
