  ok , thanks for the advice . 
  i 'll probably end up getting a new psu, 
  easy question : do i need thermal paste ? 
  also i 'm using an old case and it does n't have fans , is it still ok for the next gen crusher ? 
  edit : once i get my pc built what cheap games with good graphics do you recommend ? 
  it 's not worth it to build an expensive pc if i 'll be running morrowind on it so i wanted to get something to push my hardware to the limit , something like skyrim, 
  i mean i 'll get real thermal paste for 5 $ , i 'll also get the fans just to be sure ( my cpu should have one shipped with it but i 'll get more ) . 
  i 'm not that low on my budget , i just did n't want to spend 50 $ on a game just to test my hardware capabilities, 
  how do i install windows if i do n't have a cd drive ? 
  in particular i am looking at purchasing it from r/microsoftsoftwareswap and i think that means i will be getting an . iso file . 
  where do i download all my drivers from ? 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but when you buy a pc do n't they come with drivers pre-installed ? 
  i 'm not much of an expert on this subject . 
  how do i activate them ? 
  edit : i am interested in two worlds, 
  ca n't get it to work , thanks anyways for giving people free games , this is the kind of kindness that makes this community so great, 
  ok thanks , it 's strange that microsoft does not think of these sorts of problems in a time where optical drives are quickly becoming a thing of the past, 
  oh ok great,

  edit : til morrowindmasterrace is an actual subreddit, 
  i 've used [ these ] ( http://uk.maxell.eu/en/products/maxell-hp-mic-hp-mic-red-622.aspx ) for about 1.5 years and they were great : light , they did n't make my ears too hot and they sounded nice , they even had a small mic that i almost never used but was there as an option . 
  anyways a few days ago the audio jack broke and now they do n't work . 
  i would get the same model but since they did n't last very long i thought i 'd ask you guys for something in the 15 $ $ range with a mic and a discrete sound quality , if possible something light and that does n't make my ears sweat . 
  ** budget ** : about 15 $, 
  ** source ** : computer, 
  ** isolation ** : none ^ i ^ have ^ no ^ idea ^ what ^ this ^ is, 
  ** preferred type ** : ~ ~ no idea ~ ~ ~ ~ is overhead one of the types ? ~ ~ i 'd like your advice on this one, 
  ** past headphones ** : as i 've said http://uk.maxell.eu/en/products/maxell-hp-mic-hp-mic-red-622.aspx, 
  ** preferred music ** : rock , blues , metal, 
  ** what i would like to improve from before ** : i would like to be able to listen to stuff , since i could n't do it before, 
  ps : sorry if i could n't give much info , i 'm not a headphone expert, 
  portal 2 , 
  ** the witcher 2 : assassins of kings enhanced edition please **, 
  so i have n't built it yet but i 'm ordering all the parts and it 's on its way , it 's my first build ( before i had a laptop ) and i have spent a lot of time and effort in choosing the parts ( starting from the next gen crusher to end up with something extremely different ) trying to get it as cheap and powerful as possible ( two things that do n't go together so easily ) . 
  i have n't even started to build it but i already convince two of my friends to join the master race ( a lot of people want a pc but do n't think of building or even choosing one and so they buy a console ) . 
  i choose the witcher 2 becaue i 've been an rpg/fantasy fan for many years , i remember the first time i opened a fantasy novel and starred at the map complete mesmerized for about 10 minutes : a whole universe behind one small book ... you can imagine my reaction when i found out that they made games set in those worlds . 
  ps : 100 games ? 
  i am always extremely impressed by who puts the time and effort to make a giveaway but wow, 
  oh well i liked having conversations while having my headphones on , even when playing music at low volume . 
  anyways i saw a good pair of headphones in a store and i think i 'm going to get those . 
  i 'm speechless , seriously that would be great !, 
  i 'm seriously speechless and i ca n't thank you enough , but that 's only if i do n't win :p ( even if i win i 'm still extremely thankful for you doing this , i seriously ca n't think of any other place other than pcmr where stuff like this happens , such a ~ ~ great ~ ~ glorious comunity ), 
  random trust keyboard i found , random `` gaming '' mouse i found ( normal mouse with leds ) . 
  when i did it i sanded all of the old paint off ( i 'd suggest 140 and 600 grit , use the 140 for the rough work and then the 600 for the finishing touch ) then you paint it with spray cans . 
  use masking tape for cool patterns . 
  and do n't use cheap spray cans , 5 $ should get you a decent one, 
  well i 'm planning on using some transparent finish to protect it so that it does not come off but no so far i have n't had any problems . 
  keep in mind that it might end up being a bit rough , not completely smooth to the touch but still ok . 
  the masking tape thing can let you get some really cool patterns , it 's the same tecnique used by car painters ( no idea how they are called ) . 
  edit : i do n't know if the roughness is due to the fact that i bought a semi-cheap spray can or that i did n't do enough hands of paint but i can tell you that i bought a super cheap can at a dollar store and it left the surface as rough as sandpaper and covered in dust , i had to sand it back down and start all over, 
  prebuilts are almost always a rip-off : they know that their average client does n't know anything about computers , but they also know that everyone knows what an i7 is and what 8gb ram means . 
  so they end up selling a `` gaming '' computer with a great cpu , good ram but all bottlenecked by the cheapest graphics card they could find , and to top it all off they also give you a cheap psu that will most likely fry your mobo . 
  a friend of mine bought a pre built and when he opened it he noticed that the graphics card was the same model as the integrated one !, 
  he had to buy a new one , adding another 150 to the already exorbitant cost that he paid for something that he could 've built for a lot cheaper on his own . 
  they 're store is not 50 % rubbish because they have 50 % less games, 
  i do n't want to start a fight , i use origin whenever a game is not available on steam . 
  how ? 
  ready man, 
  is n't there any way to keep my windows installation ? 
  or will i have to get the actual cd and reinstall it ? 
  can i just try it and if it does n't boot i just fix it as you said ? 
  thanks for the response anyways, 
  edit : additional semi-unrelated question : is there any way to completely wipe the drive of any programs , files and stuff while still keeping windows ? 
  thanks , i 'll give it a try, 
  i do n't know what processor was in the computer when the os was installed , i have an i5 4570 now . 
  once the psu gets delivered i 'll start putting everything together and see if it works, 
  ok , i will have to test it , my psu is coming in a couple days, 
  my card is 1cm to big for my case , get a file ( [ this type of file ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file_ ( tool ) ) or a saw and you 'll be fine, 
  i heard of `` f.lux '' a program that slightly changes the color of your monitor too help reduce tiredness and help you to sleep , you actually have to give it your time zone and stuff so it can reproduce natural light conditions , but it 's for windows not just for chrome , so it will change everything . 
  i actually remember when this game came out , i was kind of interested in playing it , it would be great if op gave me the chance to do it . 
  thanks op for the giveaway !, 
  just keep in mind that cutting metal with a saw ( especially hand saw ) is a slooooooow process . 
  i 'd suggest using a power tool of some kind , and taking the piece you will have to cut ( like the piece of metal where you mount the hdd in my case ) away from any delicate pieces of hardware , sawdust could enter your fan , sparks ( if your using a power tool ) may cause problems , your saw could slip and cut your gpu in half !, 
  stay safe op  be careful with power tools, 
  edit : as someone suggested use a dremel, 
  nope , this master race thing is just an ongoing joke , we are not creating an army of pc users just having fun playing games . 
  if they like consoles let them use consoles , good graphics are important for us but not everyone cares . 
  also choosing a console is not necessarily a stupid choice : if you like playing on the couch with five friends then you should get a console , if you do n't like messing with components then a console is a superior choice . 
  sorry but we `` masterracers '' are not an army against consoles , we just have a common hobby . 
  have you taken a look at [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/builds#wiki_the_media_elite ) page ? 
  their 500 $ ( next gen crusher ) build is quite good, 
  i am not , always played on pc since the first time i ever played a videogame . 
  age of mytholgy , the campaign is a masterpiece, 
  ok , sounds like a possible solution , i 'm very bad at identifying notes by ear but it does n't sound much higher pitchd than a normal 6 blow . 
  also in the tabs he states that it is a 6 blow , and he is not giving an easier `` beginner '' version , i mean he has blow bends in that song , they are probably considered more advanced than overblows . 
  i would n't buy it , it makes no sense to have a non portable device ( you still have to plug it to a plug and a monitor ) that is not as powerful as a real desktop pc : it 's like taking the negative aspects of a laptop and the ones of a desktop and putting them together . 
  that said since it 's as cheap as a normal office desktop i would probably buy if i was a business owner and neeed to give my employees a pc that looks good ( or at least goes unnoticed due to its size ) and does n't need good specs , a good alternative to a stylish but underpowered and overpriced mac . 
  interesting , maybe i 'll work on blow bends next then . 
  do they require you to tweak your harmonica ? 
  ( like embossing for overblows for example ), 
  thanks for the help !, 
  and no i do not own a g harmonica ( i was going to get one anyways so this is another reason to do it ) but i 'll be trying with my c harp for now . 
  true , but hearthstone is one of the few games i could see as `` playable '' on a tablet , i mean it 's basically solitaire . 
  ** semi-unrelated ** : i remember when i told some kid i was building a gaming pc , he said `` why do n't you get an ipad instead ? 
  you can play minecraft '' , i lost hope in the future . 
  what is this `` zero fill '' thing you are talking about ? 
  i just need a way to quickly and easily clear my drive , does this zero fill suit my needs ? 
  ok , if it 's easy and semi fast then i 'll do it . 
  i hope it solves the problem,
