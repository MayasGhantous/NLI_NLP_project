  i restarted the win explorer but it did n't help :( thank for helping anyways . 
  and btw cpu and disc are at about 0 % usage , memory is about at 16 %, 
  i once heard that they are just legit keys bought in bulk and sold for cheap , it was reccomended on the pcmasterrace `` builds '' page and i bought my windows 10 from there . 
  it was 35 $ , got it from the moderator ( se5an or something like that ) it worked nicely , microsoft verified that it was a real copy of windows . 
  and they use the cheapest , oldest graphics card because many of the people who go into a computer shop to buy a pre built do n't even know what a gpu is . 
  if you can find a good prebilt with good everything for a good price then it 's a good choice , maybe after replacing the psu it will be a good computer , but you will not learn anything from buying a pre built , while building one for yourself teaches you a lot of stuff . 
  i remember finding an expansion for empire tw at a store for like 3 bucks . 
  i was super excited , bought it went home and finally read the label , did n't notice the word `` expansion '' when i bought it , i hope i have n't thrown it away . 
  ** edit ** : is this a joke or what ? 
  medieval 2 is 10gb download !!, 
  it 's 4gb bigger than skyrim !, 
  it 's from 2006 it 's not supposed to be 10gb !, 
  expected download time is 1.5 days !, 
  medieval 2 looked like the best to me but it 's a 10gb download size !, 
  can anyone explaing this to me ? 
  it 's bigger than skyrim !, 
  i do n't have a good enough internet for it . 
  sure from a cpu perspective but hd ? 
  most of that is generally filled up from textures and media files and i 'm not seeing many ultra resolution textures or models in medieval 2, 
  ** edit : ** great idea just came to my mind : i 'll download it a bit at a time when i 'm not at home , 4 hours a day and i 'll be done downloading by 2017 !, 
  i 'm getting medieval because it 's the only one with a reasonable file size , #slowinternetmasterrace thanks for the help !, 
  link ? 
  ca n't seem to find them, 
  haha i remember that , did n't realize it was from a minecraft convention, 
  i 'm new to etching : may i ask how you did it/what method did you use ? 
  great job !, 
  i 'm guessing ( from what i can see in the picture ) that the body is wood and the head is plastic , how did you carve/shape the wood ? 
  wow i love the shape , so elegant . 
  does it have a slipjoint ? 
  i 'm looking into blacksmithing but i do n't know anything about how to harden nor temper , is there a specific temperature at which it has to be done or what ? 
  could anyone eli5 it for me ? 
  thanks , just what i was looking for, 
  i have already gotten the electrolysis of water to work in the past , even with such a simple setup as the one i used for this ethanol experiment . 
  my ethanol is ... not very pure , i did not have time to go buy the 95 % ethanol type so i used the one for washing and disinfecting stuff around the house wich is around 90 % ethanol , some tiofene , red coloring and butanone ( all of these components are added to make this alcohol not fit for human consumption ) . 
  i still believe my problem was that ethanol does not conduct electricity , perhaps adding baking soda will fix that ? 
  i would have expected hidrogen to form on one end and ethanol molecules with an hidrogen atom missing on the other end , c2h5-oh --  c2h5-o + h. 
  not an expert but i would guess chlorine gas from the nacl , and of course h and o from the water that you made the solution from . 
  i might be wrong but i would also guess that the baking soda would break down in na + h+co 2 + o. 
  anyways you should get carbon dioxide , sodium , chlorine gas and the obvious oxigen and hydrogen , but again it is just a guess . 
  edit : a quick research on the internet suggests that the sodium bicarbonate may produce co2 and some co, 
  https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/introductory_chemistry_online i 've been studying chemistry on my own and i just finished reading this , it 's concise and straight to the point and i ca n't help but reccomend it . 
  periodic videos is a great channel , it really exposes the fun and interesting part of chemistry . 
  do you think any of those pdfs you were talking about would be suitable for someone who has just started looking into chemistry ? 
  i was looking for some more literature on organic and inorganic chemistry but i did n't really know where to start . 
  solution of copper sulfate and water , drop an iron nail in it and wait a bit , the nail should slowly react to form iron sulfate , a copper precipitate should appear on the nail . 
  also the solution turns from bright blue to a greenish color if i recall correctly . 
  it 's a single replacement reaction and it 's a good example of the way the activity series of metals works , not very impressive to look at but quite safe . 
  * or * he want to make his bike explode and be propelled into space, 
  yes , this is a fact and has been proven by studies , the reason why this image does n't present a valid point is because you generally do n't feed cattle with products that are suitable for human consumption , that 's how we know the guy who posted it does n't know anything about farming . 
   non-oral-ergonomic cup, 
  came here to say just that , i have a decent experience with carving wooden spoons and in all the first ones i made the cup was horribly shaped and made using them really annoying . 
  anyways great work on it , it looks great !, 
  but in the example of co carbon only has 4 valence electrons but it is drawn with 2 dots + 3 electrons used in the triple bond . 
  am i missing something ? 
  that is the answer i was looking for , now the math adds up , thanks, 
  they 're not made out of magnesium , magnesium is generally sold in the form of ribbons . 
  your best bet is ebay . 
  i 've started to notice that too , it 's strange for such a small subreddit to be so hostile . 
  hi people , i guess i owe you an apology for disappearing completely , i kind of stopped playing the harmonica recently because to be honest i 've had a stressful year and i 've struggled to get everything back on track . 
  unfortunately i do n't think i will be able to start playing again until june and i will be traveling in the summer so i do n't know how much i 'll be able to practice or even when i 'll have an internet connection . 
  i 'll try my best to start playing again , the harmonica is the first instrument that i was able to keep playing for more than a week and i regret having stopped playing it whenever i look at my playlist ( filled with 9 below zero and similar harmonica related bands ) . 
  also i think that to this day i have never seen a more welcoming and friendly subreddit than this one . 
  i have no idea why i have n't started playing again so far , but getting the message from my inbox saying that i was tagged in this post was kind of a reminder me that i 've been sitting on my ass doing nothing this whole year and i should really get back up and doing the things that i used to enjoy , trying to be active ... so i guess i should thank / u/areweafraidofthedark for reminding me about this harmonica thing . 
  ** since i 'm here i guess i 'll ask ** , does anyone have any idea of what i could try playing next ? 
  i remember quite well that i stopped playing because i ran out of songs and i never really started back again once i had lost that momentum . 
  i 'm still enjoying my `` tin sandwich '' flair , it 's been my username on everything ever since . 
  nice , i 'll try the new challenges when i 'll get a little time . 
  for now i think i 'll take some time to get back into playing , if i get any ideas for a challenge i 'll pm you and maybe i can do one later along the year . 
  i tought you guys might enjoy it, 
  may i ask for a link or a general indication of when it was published ? 
  i ca n't find it in the wiki :( . 
  we all wish we could pull it of  he is one of the few `` classical-style '' harmonica players that i like , it 's not the type of music that i generally listen to but he does it so well it 's impossible not to enjoy it ... and as far as i know he mostly improvises !, 
  thanks !, 
  just before i saw your post i was scrolling trough all the `` beginner bending help '' post that have popped up in the last couple days and thought `` we really need a wiki '' . 
  funny coincidences , 
  anyways i 'd say it would be good to insert in the faq a small list of beginner tunes for c harmonica , sorted by category ( blues , folk , celtic/irish etc ) . 
  it 's not as frequently asked as `` what harmonica to buy '' but it 's up there . 
  i 'd say this faq is direly needed , i was looking trough the last couple month 's posts to spot any common questions and half the posts were basically just the same thread, 
  to be honest i think the number 1 problem with our wiki is that no one ever ends up seeing it : let me explain ... 
  think of the person who posts these types of questions . 
  this is the same guy who did not bother to scroll down the page to find the other 50 identical threads nor did he bother to use the search bar or google ... now it goes without saying that he would never read the wiki simply because it 's a small button hidden on top of the page . 
  i think our only chance is to get a stickied post in big bold green capital letters so that everyone who opens the sub sees it before even clicking the `` make a new text post '' button . 
  tl ; dr : big letters , more people read ... i took me, 
  20 minutes to write down something that could be summarized in 10 words . 
  fair enough , but chances are that the poeple who ask one of these faqs have never been on this subreddit ( especially the ones with questions about their first harp ) , so they would notice the stickies since it 's their first time seeing them . 
  also at least we can simply answer those questions by linking to the faq , without the need to rewrite all the different pros and cons of every harmonica any time someone asks for informations . 
  i 'm sure it can be done quickly , even without any coding experience , with an online tutorial . 
  also since we are talking about it why not add a couple photos of various harmonica players up on the top of the page , just to make everything look more refined . 
  considering how supportive and creative this sub is i think we probably could find a user with some artistic skill to make it happen , maybe even set up a small contest for who can make the best banner ( i 'd help but i can barely use ms paint ) . 
  high temperature reactions and mason jars do n't mix very well ... but at least we learn from our mistakes , 
  ( i 'm assuming you 're using a mason jar but the video is quite dark so it 's hard to tell ), 
  everyone loves the halogens ( :, 
  i did that too !, 
  brake drum charcoal forge and a small pretend anvil , made a couple hooks and then ran out of charcoal, 
  `` mouth feel '' is not a very specific thing , i know many brands have methyl and/or ethyl salicylate ( for flavour and antibacterial properties if i recall correctly ) but i do n't know how that could help you . 
  try throwing a bunch of cinnamon in vodka and let it sit for some time , filter and you got your mouthwash ( i remember seeing it on mythbusters ) , it 's got alcohol in it but at least it wo n't kill you , unless you drink the whole bottle ... 
  just keep in mind that you should n't put in your mouth anything that you made in a lab yourself . 
  best of luck !, 
  sorry if i was n't very encouraging , keep experimenting !, 
  that 's great , i ca n't help much in the `` kitchen ingredients '' department but i 'd love to see what you come up with,
