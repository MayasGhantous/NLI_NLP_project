  and btw i 'm getting downvoted ... i 'd love to know why , this subreddit is just hard to figure out . 
  ooooh now i get what `` mouth feel '' means , a bitter mouthwash could be a bit weird but whatever works for you and your audience . 
  glad i could help, 
  i do n't think it is even known at all , as an european it makes me so happy to see aspects of our culture in a game , it 's quite rare . 
  i ca n't really figure out what it 's supposed to look like , a wrinkly dog ? 
  way too scary for fullscreen, 
  they 're extremely popular in europe in the weed smoking community , to the point that owning one immediately identifies you as a stoner . 
  source : ce stavo pure io, 
  could you be more specific ? 
  if i understand correctly you want to look at comic strips that end up on newspapers . 
  i 'd suggest googling `` altan '' for some political comics . 
  other than that there is not much on the newspapers , the `` settimana enigmistica '' ( a puzzle/crossword magazine ) has many comic strips , `` le ultime parole famose '' by bort for example, 
  i have n't seen one of his posts in months , i was wondering where he had gone . 
  edit : i think this is my top rated comment ... a bit sad tbh, 
  ok , i guess i just was n't paying enough attention, 
  no no do n't !, 
  i need that sweet sweet karma, 
  lol thanks, 
  yes it 's a repost , i just tought it could be entertaining for you guys . 
  peace out, 
  after all it 's just for the sake of experimentation , i 'll see how it goes and report back if it 's worth it . 
  personally i think that my experience with block-dragging languages helped me a lot . 
  i did a lot of programming using stencil ( basically a more advanced scratch ) , it tought me to `` think in code '' without having to worry about syntax . 
  once i got to actual programming it took me a couple tutorials to translate what i alredy knew into the new language and i was ready to go . 
  of course it 's just my experience, 
  i know this is a month old but i was reading this and saw `` live after death t-shirt '' , i looked down at my chest and i 'm wearing that same t-shirt , i found it fucking hilarious , 
  we need a heavy metal version, 
  do n't you think you are simplifying this a bit ? 
  if he is referring to the chance of actually being phisically harmed by a terrorist than that is almost none . 
  on the other hand if right wing populist gain consensus due to these recent events then he will 100 % be affected by the laws they will be able to put in place, 
  i can respect your point , i do n't necessarily agree with it but it 's a valid point . 
  you should keep in mind the original comment you were replying to : i did n't imply that we should not react to the attacks , i just explained how in my view the rise of the extreme right ( which is often openly racist and in some cases neo-nazist ) is just as threatening as the actual attacks ( and this is of course a view coming from a left winger ) . 
  i agree with you that we are not doing enough to fight isis . 
  tl ; dr : good comment , good point , not necessarily a relevant reply to my comment specifically . 
  i have a used philips cd300 , i plugged it into my amplifier and it produces a lot of static noise , and once i actually insert a disc it starts producing a horribly loud static noise , to the point where the actual music is almost impossible to hear , sometimes depending on the disc i insert it will play it , but with a lot of static and distorsion . 
  any help ? 
  ( sidenote : if i use an rca to 3.5 mm jack cable to plug my phone in the amplifier it also distorts the sound , but my turntable works just fine ), 
  while troubleshooting i tried connecting it to all the different inputs , none of them seemed to do the trick, 
  indica vs sativa, 
  i 've got an all in one pre-main amplifier combo, 
  hi there , recently i 've been looking for a new pair of headphones and i 'll admit right away that i am not an expert in this field . 
  after doing some research i ended up with two options : superlux hd-668b or samson sasr850c , both not very expensive , over ear , semi open headphones . 
  ** source ** - computer/phone, 
  ** requirements for isolation ** - they are both semi-open back , i plan on using them at my computer and only rarely on the subway so i think that level of isolation would be fine . 
  ** preferred tonal balance ** - i was looking for something a warm/bassy, 
  ** preferred music ** - i mostly listen to punk , metal and reggae . 
  ** past headphones ** - mid-range iems , by mid range i mean around 20 $, 
  can you elaborate a bit on the bitrate part ? 
  recently i 've been trying to understand if i can hear the difference between 128kbps , 320kbps and flac and i 'd love to hear your opinion, 
  i read it as `` baby foxes '' the first time and it kinda creeped me out, 
  [ their newest album ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdm0to6ohg0 ), 
  they are quite big in rome , they do n't really promote or tour outside of the city as far as i know, 
  i once got metal fume fever from being uncautious with a piece of zinc and a blowtorch :( i felt quite dumb for making such a stupid mistake . 
  it was n't fun, 
  psssst ... i 'll tell you a secret , 21 grams is a random ass amount everywhere but in the us, 
  as an italian this made me laugh way too much, 
  dell ` agro pontino forse ? 
  i think this is satire/photoshopped, 
  read `` the shadow over innsmouth '' , procede to shit your pants and after cleaning up you 'll understand the post . 
  i ai n't got the balls to click that . 
  what 's behind the link ? 
  looking at the thumbnail it just looks like a really fat blunt . 
  redditor here , can confirm ... you missed the joke, 
  yo if you live in a country where hash is commonly sold maaan hash is so different from weed or even kief . 
  it 's weird [ 7 ] it 's great, 
  or charas , hand rolled hash/resin, 
  i guess technically it 's just pressed kief , but it 's generally imported while weed is locally grown . 
  it 's way different , it 's a much more mellow , body high . 
  i do n't think mine comes from mountains . 
  but the high is just as you described it . 
  lol , i always wondered if i 'm supposed to throw away those chunks when i see them, 
  italy , form what i 've gathered our hash comes from the middle east , morocco or nepal ( the nepalese stuff being verydifferent from the other two ) , while our weed comes mostly from locally grown plants . 
  yeah i would go for a cleaner and darker style . 
  but the cat is on point . 
  if you do n't want to get robbed the best advice is to not `` look like a tourist '' . 
  it 's easier in the fall and winter , just dress like a normal person : shirt , jacket etc. 
  in the summer you 'll start to notice the typical american tourist : pale , sunburnt , wearing sandals , shorts , a white t-shirt , sunglasses and a giant hat . 
  i live in a big torist city and i 've never been even touched by a thief , but any time i meet a tourist that fits the description above they end up going back to the hotel with a lot lighter pockets . 
  tl : dr if you dress like a tourist you become a big target for pickpockets . 
  please , for the love of god , dress like a decent human being, 
  as long as they are informed that it 's not as good as the natural stuff they can smoke ground up cat shit for all i care , it 's their problem . 
  same goes for tobacco , seriously ca n't we all mind our own business and let everyone else live ? . 
  warm vodka, 
  yeah , sorry for that , i got a bit infuriated after reading a couple infuriating things on the internet , you had nothing to do with that . 
  hazelnut wood , it 's a bit soft for pipes but it 's kind of my favorite wood , and the branches are perfectly sized for this kind of stuff . 
  i mostly smoke joints , so this is going in the drawer for a long long time . 
  how did you make yours ? 
  it 's probably like 10 bucks for a whole pack of semi-decent cigars ( just to get an idea of the flavour ) . 
  i buy loose tobacco and roll my own cigarettes , it 's kinda cheap compared to premade cigarettes and it 's a whole different adventure taste-wise . 
  anyways if you want to buit a pipe it really only takes a drill , a saw , and a whole lot of ingenuity . 
  and it 's fun too !, 
  with a long drill bit . 
  it took me a couple tries , but it 's not as hard as it seems, 
  yeah wtf, 
  it 's got some style !, 
  i might buy a similar one, 
  12 % of italians smoke weed ? 
  i am ashamed , we should double that number, 
  american spirit used to be a premium quality all-natural tobacco brand , why have they started making menthol cigarettes ? 
  like you made a super premium tobacco product , and then you cover the flavour with chemicals ?
