  do n't mess with married people . 
  you 're 18 , you simply need to grow up . 
  seriously , your face is not fully developed yet . 
  so that 's why your cheeks are still full , it 's okay . 
  you 're not ugly . 
  i 'd say you 're a 7,0 . 
  you just need some treatment for acne and a new haircut . 
  and a new attitude - more self confidence . 
  otherwise , i do n't see why a girl would n't want to date you . 
  ** what ? 
  please do me a favor and tell him you have the right to do whatever you want with your hair . 
  and if he freaks out , break up with him . 
  when are we living ? 
  in the middle ages ? 
  when my mother was dating my father he told her he hated her bright red lipstick , and if she ever met my father 's mother she 'd have to wear a light pink lipstick because the red one would drive my grandmother mad . 
  guess what she did ? 
  she wore the super bright red lipstick and a super thick black eyeliner when she first met my grandmother . 
  and years later my parents got married . 
  stablish your boundaries , girl . 
  if your man does n't love you for who you are , he does n't deserve you . 
  however , you did the same thing to him , so yes , you 're being hypocritical . 
  this whole controlling relationship is a disaster . 
  you 're both immature and have to work on that . 
  i did , and i said that she did the same thing to him , and that 's why she 's hypocritical . 
  i would feel hurt too . 
  c'mon , she may not have the money to buy you a gift but there are other ways to celebrate an anniversary and make the partner happy . 
  your whole situation is indeed your fault . 
  do n't put the blame on his hands . 
  you had the choice to stop talking to him . 
  you knew he was married and had children and now you 're acting as if it was big news to you . 
  1 year ago you had the chance to cut this off but you decided to keep talking to him . 
   a year ago i accidentally stumbled on his real name online . 
  found a photo of him with wife and child ( aged one so born in the time we 've been talking ) . 
  you said this yourself . 
  yet you decided to keep talking to him . 
  so yes , you are responsible for this . 
  he 's guilty for being married and sexting you , you 're guilty for keeping sexting a married man . 
  he was not single at that time . 
  he was a married man thirsty for sex and looking for some sexting . 
  perhaps he would skype you when his wife and child were out of the house . 
  nah , you 're not a jackass . 
  it 's fine . 
  he is cute and looks super happy . 
  cute . 
  you look italian and the kind of guy i 'd flirt with . 
  i think you 're cute and dateable . 
  nice hair , nice skin , decent style ... work on your personality/attitude/self confidence if finding a partner is a little hard for you . 
  i think it 'd look inappropriate if you started conversation with a costumer . 
  my cousin used to work as a restaurant ma\u00eetre and once she had a huge crush on a client as well . 
  he was flirty when he talked to her , and every once in a while would joke and tease her . 
  not listening to anybody 's advice , she decided to hit on him by asking him if he was single . 
  he totally got the message , and asked her on a date . 
  they went out together , and after the date she was already calling a cab and trying to go to her place ( without him ) and the guy asked her `` hey this is how this is ending tonight ? '' . 
  long story short he thought she was an escort . 
  that 's how inappropriate and messy it can get . 
  well , you 've made a mistake but now simply stop talking to him and move on . 
  you just wanted someone to talk to and you liked talking to him . 
  also you were very immature and very young . 
  we make many mistakes at your age . 
  at least you did n't have sex with him , you were n't his real mistress . 
  it was just an internet thing . 
  move on . 
  starting a conversation is n't inappropriate . 
  flirting with a customer is . 
  and you know she does n't want to have just some small talk with him . 
  he looks blissful in the mud !, 
   she has never met this man , but has already committed to spending the night with him in a hotel ? 
  please stop seeing this lady asap if you do n't wan na get hurt .

  you have a cute smile, 
  i think you 'd look even better with short hair + facial hair . 
  well ... 
  i think every woman thinks differently when it comes to this topic . 
  i may be called shallow by some , but no amazing personality will overcome ugliness or a bear belly to me . 
  if you 're average looking , you can look very hot if you have an amazing personality , charm and intelligence , but if you 're just plain ugly , you ca n't become attractive just because you 're a great guy . 
  you 'll just be a great ugly guy . 
  that 's how it works . 
  and it works for women , too . 
  it 's the awful truth . 
  there is no beauty face filter or blur effect . 
  i ca n't do anything if my selfie camera is shitty but there is no filter there . 
  i do n't contour my face with foundation , i just wear blush . 
  thank you for your advice !, 
  i honestly think that if you 're unable to be happy with whatever you have in life , if you think the day-by-day life is tedious and pathetic , you 'll never , ever be satisfied .
