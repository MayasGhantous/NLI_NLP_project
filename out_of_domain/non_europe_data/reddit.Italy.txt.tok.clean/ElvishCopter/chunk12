  this is pointing specifically to our day with planes , trains , automobiles and the busyness of modern day life . 
  we are definately running to and fro and have knowledge like no time before us . 
  * this bible * sign does n't end there though , because it has a dual application . 
  `` running to and fro and knowledge increase '' also applies to knowledge of biblical truths ( see amos 8:12 ) . 
  during the `` dark ages '' , for over 1000 years , knowledge of biblical truths were surpressed by the roman catholic church . 
  but since the protestant reformation and breakaway from rome , god 's people have been running to and fro in his word freely and knowledge about great bible truths have been revealed . 
  god now has an end time remnant church with the full gospel truth to take to the world before the end comes , which was needed to fulfill the sign about taking the true gospel message to the whole world . 
  which you will read about further down the page . 
  end time sign - ability to enforce the mark, 
  * revelation 13:17 * ... ` and that no man might buy or sell , save he that had the mark , or the name of the beast , or the number of his name . ', 
  * now this is a sign * that most people miss !, 
  have a think about it ... what needs to happen in order for the `` beast system '' to stop people from buying and selling if they refuse the mark ? 
  we need to have a worldwide financial system whereby everything bought and sold is through electronic means , not cash . 
  * has there been any time in history * where this could happen ? 
  are we living in a day where this could happen ? 
  most certainly , yes !, 
  and the powers of this world are now trying to make cash obsolete , and are actively pushing pure electronic forms of payment , like `` paypal '' and `` google wallet '' for instance . 
  take a look at the news and you will see this being reported in different countries of the world . 
  ** bible signs of the end times **, 
  * when noah and lot * warned their respective people of god 's coming judgment and destruction , the people would not listen . 
  instead they treated noah and lot as `` extremists '' . 
  then the destruction that did come found the people unprepared . 
  thus it will be when jesus christ returns . 
  as in the days of noah and lot , the soon return of the lord jesus will be a snare unto the people who do not heed the warning and give their lives to him .

  check the [ regional wiki ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/wiki/lazio ) . 
  there are tips that you might find useful , even if not closely food-related . 
  the less harsh climate and more sunlight of southern europe is also a significant factor .

  ** sorry , i have a slow connection **, 
  that 's anything but news . 
   depends . . what do you mean with asians ? 
  chinese , japanese and koreans ? 
  italians do n't like chinese , but love japanese , no particualr feeling for koreans . 
  why ? 
  well , because japan is well known for many good things ( japanese anime and manga are superpopular , as well cars , and so on . . ) while for china is the opposite . 
  yes , is stereotyping , but since most italians do n't have any interaction with any japanese or chinese that 's the only source of informations . 
  there is also another thing , japanese and koreans are not immigrants in italy , chinese are . 
  while chinese may be a model minority in usa are not at all in italy , cases of crimes ( from drug , to black labor , to prostitution and so on . . ) are quite common . 
  in some places of italy their presence is massive , that again is something many native do n't like . 
  chinese are often considered as the people that steal jobs with unfair competition , relying of black workers/braking laws and so on ... culturaly chinese and italian are not even at the opposite , are totally in differents worlds , therefore there is almost no integration . 
  in a turistic spot you are not going to suffer any problem , however in daily life yes , they do n't like chinese . 
  italians may express their dislike in many ways , the basic one is `` go back to your home '' . 
  to be clear , that is the worst case , is not that every single italian would think or say that , and in a place with a not high concentration of chinese probably people will never say anything at all . 
   if with asians you mean also pakistanians and indias things are a bit different . 
  pakistanians suffer the prejudice for being muslims , indians recently a strong prejudice for the unsolved question of the 2 italians soldiers ( something that sincerely put shame on italy ), 
   the cock went into the hen , nothing odd here .

  [ this is a rarer pepe , up your game . 
  funny enough you used 2 keywords : * mongoloid * and *** race ***, 
  mongoloid as a race is a derogatory term indeed , but the word is a de facto synonym for the term down , which is a syndrome that , amongst other sympthoms , impairs a person 's sharp wit . 
  edit : derp , did n't mean to put a * not * there, 
  like i said , it has 2 meanings , and it was n't used in the racist one . 
  first , jew people are not genetically ( if it 's even possible confining a `` jew '' pool at all ) cheap but down people , sadly for them , have genetically less dynamic thought processes . 
  secondly :, 
   since people with down syndrome may have epicanthic folds , down syndrome was widely called `` mongol '' or `` mongoloid idiocy '' . 
  in reference to this , the term grew in usage as a pejorative . 
  using mongoloid as a pejorative is simply comparing one 's wit to a person affected by the syndrome , not qualifying a racial group capacities . 
  third : sorry , i put a * not * in my first post but did n't mean it .
