  hmm , would n't an unusual object that is delicate enough to rip by just little pressure also rip if one moves in their sleep ? 
  pelvic thrusts while face down work fine , a friend told me . 
  reading my previous post now i can see it 's cringe worthy ... such is life, 
  i guess because it 's the most efficient space/vehicle flow way to build an highway . 
  and as others have already said that jam happens only twice per year , causing the construction and maintenance of something more complex way too expensive . 
  there 's also the facts that china was dirt poor until few decades ago and their country is huge so you do n't see the normal development of infrastructure like we had in the west .

  well , if you read from an angle ( eg : surpassing it ) it is readable . 
  i love it , especially how well it handles trackers . 
  requires some tinkering after install tho . 
  i had some obscure asian torrents and while utorrent completed them without changing anything i had to try different configs to make tixati discover those 2 peers that had the part i missed . 
  could have been network saturation / peer was n't online at the time tho . 
  is he a fucking pok\u00e9mon game ? 
  it was the other kind of `` battery '' . 
  e la madonna . 
  does n't it shut off as a fail-safe before it gets that hot ?

  are clients allowed to beat one off ?

  looking at their [ wot reputation ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2f0x0sf.png ) i 'm not surprised about that `` security '' . 
  and compression rate/time and memory required for . rar is pretty much the best one hands down . 
  . rar5 is even better . 
  i 've texted it a while ago and the only case where where 7z wins is with text using ppmd , but pretty much anything can hugely compress text , and ppmd in 7z is single threaded so it 's future is bleak . 
  if we are talking about non-private use or security then 7z being free and open wins the match . 
  wait , but you are n't a doctor !,
