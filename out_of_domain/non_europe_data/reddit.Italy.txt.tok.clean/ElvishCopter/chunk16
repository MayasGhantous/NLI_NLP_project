  there was a eu voting about net neutrality on the 26th . 
  isp can create fast lanes , offer zero-rating , trottle traffic by type ( eg : torrenting , or even non-shady vpn ) , slowing speed before congestion happens, 
  tl ; dr isp can offer different prices for the same speed , they just need to use the right legal babble in the contract, 
   there is a provision that allows for preferential treatment for `` specialised services , '' for example . 
  this might be used for self-driving vehicles or medical data , but there are fears that this exemption is too broadly defined , and may be abused . 
   1 ) the proposal allows isps to create fast lanes for companies that pay through the specialized services exception . '', 
  this exemption is intended for `` specialized services '' -- like medical data , say -- but van schewick argues that the exception is `` too broad , '' and that `` in many cases , it still allows isps to offer fast lanes by calling them a specialized service . 
   2 ) the proposal generally allows zero-rating and gives regulators very limited ability to police it , leaving users and companies without protection against all but the most egregious cases . '', 
  if a service is zero-rated , it does n't count towards a users ' bandwidth cap or usage costs . 
  this means companies could pay isps to be zero-rated -- once again creating an unequal internet . 
   3 ) the proposal allows isps to define classes and speed up or slow down traffic in those classes , even if there is no congestion . '', 
  isps could still choose to discriminate against certain kinds of data ( like peer-to-peer torrenting , for example ) . 
  van schewick worries that because isps will not be able to identify what `` class '' encrypted data fits in , they will simply put them in the slowest lane -- as has happened before . 
  this will discourage the use of encryption , and make the internet less secure . 
   4 ) the proposal allows isps to start managing congestion in the case of impending congestion . 
  that means that they can slow down traffic anytime , not just during times of actual congestion . '', 
  van schewick thinks this will be used as an excuse for discriminatory traffic management , `` using the justification that congestion was just about to materialise .

   previous expos , such as hanover 2000 and seville 1992 , left disappointing legacies , with many of their pavilions left to decay for lack of funds and a vision .
