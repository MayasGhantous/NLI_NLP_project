  you first wipe yourself with toilet paper , * then * use a bidet . 
  1 . poop, 
  - use toilet paper, 
  - sit on bidet, 
  - wash the area with water or neutral soap, 
  - direct the nozzle/use your hand to wash off eventual remaining pooparticles ( there should n't be any , bidet are made with an angle that lets most of stuff slide right into the drain ), 
  - wash hands, 
  - enjoy your clean butt, 
  binging askreddit 's top threads :p, 
  only if it 's hosted to imgur/gfycat  :d, 
  it says it in the watermark ... 
  it 's vanilla deville btw , you should definitely check her . 
  before ending the order try to specify when you will be at home to get your package , most of the time the courier will deliver in the window you specify . 
  there are [ coin-shaped keychains ] ( http://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00ykmtcjsagpbr/key-chain-key-ring-coin-key-chain-coin-key-ring-metal-key-chain.jpg ) for people that do n't use cash or simply like the item . 
  most of the time those are gifts gave out as promotions . 
  but i live in italy , and people usually put their cart back to get their coin/slug back , you wo n't believe how much losing 2 $ ( or giving them to a gypsy that roam parking lots , lol ) motivates people . 
  looking at your username i 'd say your password is `` hunter2 '' . 
  am italian , i will eliminate anyone that eats pasta salad with cucumbers . 
  just give me the coordinates . 
  aim for the cerebellum . 
  exactly . 
  me neither, 
  the ring will decay by itself in microseconds , no need to cut it off :p, 
  lazy explanation by memory and my os is n't in english but here we go :, 
  uninstall as much drivers as possible before upgrading , you 'll have way less problems in the future, 
  if there is any advanced option during win10 setup check it , and put every slider on off , maybe only keep gps tracking on if you want stuff like weather forecast ready . 
  after install go under start -  options -  update -  advanced -  under `` how to install updates '' select the notify option . 
  go back , click on `` how to get updates '' , and check the `` local pc only option '' . 
  done . 
  if you want more accurate stuff just use google . 
  ** happy fucking cake day you wonderful person **, 
  kim jong-un is being quite effective at it . 
  frecciarossa ( trenitalia ) ones are also quite good . 
  go to the swedish one , they are everywhere . 
  open your mouth . 
  soda can cost less then water and fries are really cheap ... 
  frecciarossa/argento is their mid-high tier division . 
  safety and comfort wise they are the same as italo . 
  first class on freccia rossa is better then italo 's imo . 
  maybe you know this already but i guess this may be useful for other people . 
  well , i have to raise a white flag then .

  if you really want to work here aim to have international clients , the italian it job market here is stagnant and has low pay . 
  blunt question : why would you want to emigrate from a country that 's usually near the top of any ranking for quality of living ? 
  you use a noroot firewall , essentially it 's a vpn internal on your local connection that drops the packets based on the rules you give them .

  they could just put the camera * inside * the cabin just like they do for rally cars , but i get your point . 
  edit : data storage should n't be a problem if the camera fed its recording into a flight recorder , which uses tape as a storage medium and has already defined standards . 
  the only change would be the type of data stored : video instead of audio . 
  at least you did n't bombard your parking lot from the 6th floor with tangerines like i did as a [ bored kid ] ( #spoiler ),
