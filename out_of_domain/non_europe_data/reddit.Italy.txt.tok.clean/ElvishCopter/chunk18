  did you try asking to the lobby ? 
  usually they can point you to the closest electronic store/diy store . 
  message acknowledged , request refused . 
  code : 0x7375636b206974, 
  for a lot of people scene releases are too big . 
  you were n't the only one . 
  * rawr *, 
  it 's not that so bad . 
  hold my crucifix , i 'm going in !, 
  are you sure it 's brownies and not something else that 's brown ? 
  found the ero-manga otaku, 
  losing housing and transportation is n't really an insignificant consequence . 
  fatal engine failures are fun lol, 
  piggyback on this : also look at the memory 's timings , not just the mhz !, 
  ( lower * timings * = better ), 
  but if possible buy a module that has the same speed and timings as the old one , you 'll bang your head less . 
  eh , i understand his addiction . 
  the output should have been a loop of, 
  one of us, 
  `` i thought i heard something '' - roman soldier, 
  of the conversation, 
  you, 
  `` stillborn '', 
  my pleasure . 
  tbh you wo n't see real world differences with lower timings or even speeds unless you 're in an enterprise environment . 
  just get the * amount * you need with the best price/gb from any non obscure brand and you saved $ for more important stuff . 
  * outdated reference *, 
  yeah , the spo-ken one . 
  sometimes they skim on a `` t '' . 
  [ ha-ha rule34 for you !, 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/s96e4.jpg%22just%20clarifying;%20i%20don't%20make%20these%22 ) ( also nsfw ), 
  ha , i see what you did there, 
  damn it !, 
  comment to check later cause i 'm to lazy to use the rwmindme !, 
  i want to welded shoes on my feet too . 
  i do n't like putting on shoes every day . 
  it bled down to a dracool level, 
  i do n't understand why his food always has a fish aftertaste . 
  you never tried to taste your own load ? 
  holy hell is the average us person so pc ? 
   people, 
  it 's reddit , i 'd argue that your average neckbeard is less clean then a normal human being . 
  as it does here , but there never was institutionalized segregation here so `` colored '' does not have the same background . 
  i guess i got lost in translation . 
  eh , i went to the dentist for the yearly cleaning and checkup and discovered i have a 5th wisdom tooth . 
  medically it 's called `` hyperdontia '' but the photos you find online are gross . 
  i just have normal teeth plus a solitary extra bit chilling in my gums . 
  i 'll be there again in 6 months , i 'll try to snatch a picture of the radiography if i remember , 
  almost by definition :d, 
  as long as it does n't tell you to pas trough a mountain i 'm ok with that . 
  ` sup i 'm in the eu and just finished dinner, 
  why do you use that giant blob as flair ? 
  oooooh come here kitty kitty, 
  i must confess i used the material there one time ... 
  i still feel weird, 
  io lo zafferano . 
  i love reddit . 
  a gorgonzola and nutmeg pizza bought at the store with the equivalent of 4 $ . 
  it was actually pretty good . 
  do you really want a description of my saddest and weirdest wank session ? 
  i looked at what was there , not actually produced any content , i 'm not that sick . 
  hmm let me think ... gorgonzola is vaguely like a creamy stilton or a lighter and creamier roquefort . 
  it 's great with `` salty '' spices . 
  mmmh smells like an incumbent emphysema . 
  i read your post in / r/europe when you posted it , it 's nice that you managed to keep your promise and even better to lend some of your time , 
  the reality in lesbos is bleak and your blog rightly talk about your and the refugee 's struggles . 
  did you experience anything that you could describe as funny ? 
  well , you asked for it . 
  it was late at night , maybe 2 or 3 am . 
  at that time i have something like an internal switch where i either become easily gullible or just lock down any feeling . 
  that 's the time i go for the classic lurking in research for something to jerk off and go to sleep . 
  but i happened to stumble upon an interest comment chain that happened to have people talking about subreddits for odd habit ... you can see what this will lead to . 
  long story short i 'm sitting on my bed with my trusty handkerchief on one side and my pc monitor in front of me , one hand is on the mouse and the other taking care of business . 
  first thing i do is managing to give the soldier a couple of swirl to wake him up , then start to do a repetitive motion . 
  after a few dozen thrusts while checking the first images that are easy to skim by thanks to the res extension for my browser i sort the post for best of all time . 
  some of those top posts showed male dog genitalia in what i still now remember feeling uneasy to discover that is called `` lock '' , i could n't really find that exciting and really i should have just stopped there . 
  the next posts were about male dogs licking female genitalia . 
  then i stumbled upon this post with an extensive album of photos of two people in a camp that had a quite attractive ** human ** girl being penetrated by a male dog . 
  i still feel weird about thinking at the image that made me climax : it was about this man inserting into a female dog . 
  if it matters i hurriedly went to a random hentai page i had in my history and had an orgasm while looking at what i think was some anal hentai sex . 
  i then turned my pc off and went to sleep . 
  the next morning i did n't have any recollection of the night before . 
  some weeks pass with luckily nothing triggered that memory then i stumble upon this damned comment chain . 
  edit : ** tl ; dr ** wanked to human inter-species porn once at night , felt weird . 
  4/10 would do again if able to go back in time but i do n't think i 'll ever do it more then once . 
  imagine all the little cockroaches you would find in an abandoned pi\u00f1ata : *, 
  kek, 
  look above your post , i answered you in the past, 
  also : tagged as likes dog fuckers, 
  remember that the parameter `` protection '' defaults to false . 
  and do n't use the `` pulling_out '' patch , it 's outdated and fails frequently . 
  immigrants do n't carry unknown diseases neither have absolute supremacy in armaments . 
   am from , live in , er . 
  our hospitals are undersized , sorry if you have to :(, 
  / r/engrish in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ...
