  lol , you 're going to see the difference alright . 
  just an idea : if you 're into retro gaming you could turn it into a beast of gaming machine for dos . 
  all those white spots are scars . . damn .

  agree , coil is not a symptom of bad psu , it 's just components resonating with it . 
  i have an 8 year old psu that whines since 2012 ( only hearable at night ) , house wiring is crappy at most , and never had psu related problems .

  my italian beard agrees . 
  about grillo in politics : he 's more about going against the established power than craving for attention . 
  in the last elections they were confronted about allying with the current leading party ( pd , partito democratico ) but refused to get down to compromise . 
  `` movimento 5 stelle '' ( his pupulist movement ) role in current politics is mainly blind opposition , with some great purposes out of the blue ( like going against politician benefits , corruptions and the like ) , but mainly gridlocking . 
  about this : never put balsamic vinegar or pepper on it , an italian orphan dies everytime someone does so . 
  what suits it very well is a pinch of salt , olive oil and oregan or basil . 
  ^ edit : ^ seasoning ^ was ^ for ^ mozzarella ^ and ^ tomato , ^ but ^ then ... ^ armin ^ meiwes ^ ( ( not meant to offend , but then again ... `` geschmacksache , '' ^ sagt ^ der ^ affe ^ und ^ bei\u00dft ^ in ^ die ^ seife ) ^ ^ ),

  this is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise anti-lgbt athmosphere , shows that at least something 's changing . 
  little haiku for support :, 
  two gays are kissing, 
  the church is getting angry, 
  here we laugh at it, 
  fits most of op 's mum . 
  the poopon throne . 
  with vegan gravy . 
  moist,

   two gays are kissing, 
   idiots indignated, 
   here we laugh at it, 
  sound better then ? 
  damn to them , ruining my haikus !, 
  why did i disable noscript .

  [ like it or not greece already closed this argument in 1960 by accepting 115 million marks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_reparations_for_world_war_ii#greece ),

  even if you 're the victim ? 
  damn , no punchlines come to mind . 
  msi gp series gp62 / gp72 seems to be like your best picks in that price range . 
  buy a 20 buck usb laptop fan , it 's still portable and does n't overheat , 
  that red sleeved atx24 is mildly infuriating , other than that it looks well organized . 
  did you already overclock that beauty ? 
  download the latest version of gpu-z , then click on `` lookup '' on the top right , you 'll know the exact model . 
  you missed one major point : what 's your resolution ? 
  i agree . 
  try to create an even intake - exaust balance for your fans , there will be better air flow , 1 more fan in the front should do the trick . 
  do n't forget to put dust filters on any intake too . 
  edit : stealing what / u/leminskitankscor said : rotate cooler 90 degrees counterclockwise . 
  this , do it . 
  i like that chicane on th road ahead . 
  you should clean all that ice off , you 're wasting tons of electricity .
