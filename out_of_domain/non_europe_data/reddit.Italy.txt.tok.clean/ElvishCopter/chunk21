  the process is completely automated , i dare you to solder billions of 0.00002 mm transistors by hand . 
  that 's fucked up . 
  just us oil based paints , the blade will run long enough to make some `` art '' . 
  sorry , but i think you mean soldering cpus to motherboards or heatsinks , not assembling the single transistors . 
  do n't lay and lie to yourself , get lain laid !, 
  it should count 1 view/day/device, 
  win 10 insider , chrome canary with a buttload of extensions , not really a typical scenario . 
  just wanted to throw dirt on a dumb ad .

  124 , rip cpu, 
  they are going to survive for a long time , only their pc/laptop section is going to sink . 
  intel made deals with pc manufacturers to exclude amd from the market , this is what gave the worst blow to amd . 
  eh , printers for home and light use are n't going away anytime soon . 
  that said i would n't invest in them as of today ( if i had the spare funds lol ) .

  you should be able to run windows on a linux distro and avoid the dual boot . 
  virtualbox has less fancy features but also less problems with mouse lag in my esperience . 
  edubuntu comes packed with lot of educational programs , and if you want a modern windows look you could use either the kde or gnome desktop enviroments with it . 
  well , virtualbox is severely limited on directx support and some advanced management stuff , but yeah for normal use it 's more then sufficient . 
  what methods can you use to download it , and how is one of them commonly used ?

  have a negative downvote ( \u256f \u00b0 \u25a1 \u00b0 \uff09 \u256f \u2193 \u2191, 
  that it did . 
  by what you said i 'd say your mac was overheating and the processor slowed itself to avoid damage , so in a real life scenario your netbook has a faster cpu . 
  if the warranty ended i 'd do the following : disassemble as much as practically as possible , remove dust , maybe remove the cpu , clean it and apply new thermal paste ( this last pass if the cpu is n't soldered or hard to get off , i do n't know mac guts ) . 
  done . 
  could it be the screen resolution ? 
  lower resolution , less to show at the same time , faster load . 
  it 's still up and running , just not the major player anymore . 
  my gonads told me to thank you . 
  bidets do n't remove the need to wipe ... 
  then you must have a nearly hairless butt and a diet rich of fibers , no way i can come clean without wiping . 
  does n't seem lower then usual to me ...

  you `` bite '' one of the pieces with the tool and push , thus giving you a very advantageous lever . 
  [ this is the tool 's bottom part ] ( https://i.imgur.com/nv5c8fx.jpg ), 
  firmly grasp the stuck blocks , bite the top block with the tool and apply a downward momentum , the block will get loose .

  you can also use [ two at the same time ] ( http://thebrickblogger.com/2010/11/lego-brick-separator/ ) for those nasty flat pieces .

  `` junkie 's 10 mm auto pistol '' , you can either get it as a random drop from a legendary enemy or from near one of those skeleton of suicided people . 
  i think i got mine from http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/recon_bunker_theta , you need to have done some missions in the brotherhood of steel to access it . 
  weapons near skeletons could also be random , i 'm not sure . 
  cyberfox for me works better , and last time i checked it was more up to date . 
  eh , chrome does n't get stuck with heavy javascript pages . 
  and just do n't use multi process firefox for even light script pages , it gets awfully slow , i hope they get that sorted before the release to the beta/stable channels . 
  german is easy , just sprinkle some verbs at the start and end of a phrase ans squish all the rest together . 
  a feature in the dev ( alpha ) and nightly versions of firefox , it enables multi threading ( use all the processor 's `` power '' ) but it 's still in its early stages and quite slow . 
  just qucksave before and drink more beer . 
  the nautier the better .
