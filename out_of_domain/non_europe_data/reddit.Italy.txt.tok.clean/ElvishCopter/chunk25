  shut up you and your proper use of the mod top message . 
  your tag says `` brown '' but it 's bordeaux , that 's mildly infuriating . 
  he read them ? 
  they are soft cover . 
  i have that same collection bar the last volume ; they are 850-1100 pages each and words are close to the margins . 
  i read the first 2 times and the others once . 
  most people do n't get it ( when to stop ) . 
  you would be surprised on how much knee and armpit related porn is out there . 
  did you try updating to the latest uefi version available ? 
  maybe you did n't because it 's not worth the risk and/or time but imho it would be a good idea if that error happens often . 
  have you tried downgrading ? 
  it 's risky , you could break things that got fixed , but sometime it 's worth a shot . 
  another anecdote : mines also reports 25500 mhz on the boot screen if i set different multipliers for the cpu cores ( eg : 46-46-45-44 ), 
  my mobo is an asrock , but installed a beta uefi , so i 'm not holding any grudge . 
  i 'd trade xmp compatibility above a .5 second boot screen any day .

  i knew that there were a lot of italians ancestry in brazil , but i 'm happy you made me discover nova venetia . 
  i 've seen that reddit also reflects the density of brazilians with italian roots : there have been 2 separate posts on / r/italy from brazilians asking tips for italian citizenship in the last month or so . 
  on a smaller scale it 's like skilled italians going to northern eu , heh .

  he 's probably implying that since the mb supports integrated gpu it means it 's a low tier one that does n't support sli .
