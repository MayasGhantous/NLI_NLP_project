  and browse them with blocked scripts . 
  still unsurfable ? 
  fuck them . 
  i 'm italian , but it was weird to see an italian word in the wild . 
  great technology , but not groundbreaking . 
  gpus consume a lot of power too . 
  on a supercomputer level gpus have just 2 ~ 3 times better power/flop efficiency . 
  do n't quote me on this last one , i went by memory . 
   spook spook, 
  thank you ... 
  then come to southern europe , server culture is the opposite then the us :p, 
  this would only work if the economy was under deflation . 
  might be , it 's not uncommon for groups to take their time while going out to a restaurant . 
  call a latvian communist and you 'll be the one on the ground . 
  i totally did get your irony at a first glance and absolutely did n't wath again to look for damage around the area . 
  * l the women died . 
  putting restriction on vehicle movement during high pollution times has been a common thing here in italy for at least 20 years . 
  not true . 
  for the same reason you enjoy , or at least find tolerable , visiting your elderly relatives . 
  some people prove a level of discomfort that overrides the sense of duty/enjoyment . 
  there 's a lot of dark humor between people that work with ... anything troublesome really . 
  it 's a coping mechanism . 
  and then we 'll discover that / u/shabiznik is actually a radical islamist that married a child irl . 
  good burning vietnam . 
  the kuwaiti quarter ? 
  smaller then your mum mouth . 
  you should always return something . 
  maybe the joke was n't pc , but at least it was n't cp .

  was the computer hot ? 
  the processor slows itself down to avoid overheating damage . 
  well , i doubt they were using a dsl line , so simultaneous up/down would n't have major drawbacks . 
  just weigh them after the meal , the increase in weight due to food intake is negligible . 
  i would fuck their brains out by filling their bowels with cum .

  that took me a while , nice . 
  / r/hailcorporate, 
  look up what medieval christians did , religion is not the problem . 
  it 's how twisted fucks use it to push their psychopathic agendas . 
  and excessive efficiency causes a buffer overflow that leads to unwanted pregnancies . 
  / r/leagueofbrokencondoms, 
  your % is broken . 
  agree , i just answered with the first religion that came to mind . 
  the problem with islam is how a sizable minority twists the religion , not the religion itself . 
  i 'm not religious , but considering the elimination of x religion a good cause is idiotic . 
  what are you even asking by quoting a quarter of my sentence ? 
  no modern religion is taught literally , there 's a level of interpretation . 
  if you focus you can find terrible things in any abrahamic religion . 
  new !, 
  more like making the accelerator pedal harder to push every time you bring the car to them .

  and it looks like he has installed the `` chrome synth armor '' mod .

  how do you dare steal [ my original artwork ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nupifav.png ) ? 
  just bump brightness to 100 and contrast to  45 and you cancel the watermark . 
  45 gives my edit 's results . 
  75 completely removes the watermark . 
  he 's talking kangaroo . 
  the watermark was a dark grey but the other drawings were solid black . 
  increasing brightness diminished the lighter parts of the image and increasing contrast strengthened the solid color parts of the image while toning down the lighter parts . 
  heh , beat it . 
  are you freud and have you slipped on a banana peel ?
