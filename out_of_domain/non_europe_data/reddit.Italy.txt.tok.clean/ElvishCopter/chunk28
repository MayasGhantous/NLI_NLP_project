  ever thought of renting a room or two ? 
  10 months old , huh, 
  you 've been adviced to use advice correctly . 
  aka economy catering . 
  fyi : you need to hit enter 2 times to make a new paragraph . 
  this, 
  is bad, 
  this, 
  is good, 
  your balls are uneven , i would suggest you visit an andrologist . 
   c = = =d, 
  i 'm sorry for your loss . 
  `` watching '' . 
  europe is not a single blob , alcoholism rates in southern europe are much lower then in the northernmost countries . 
  you wish . 
  strength . 
  need this . 
  free tumors , yay !, 
  * southern china rural areas * dislike this . 
  d : \\ projects \\ hoover_dam_data . ss, 
  level 4 int + idiot savant = dat xp, 
  * vocal interface . 
  using koreans as a skill scale is like using the us for military , it 's kinda cheating . 
  there 's a reddit post floating around but it uses empirical data , i trust the wikia more . 
  fair . 
  lol that sub css hides subscription and active user count . 
  there 's just one quantity of vodka : not enough . 
  their effectiveness is known . 
  / r/shittyplacement, 
  he contracted his leg a bit after the landing . 
  i like to think it was just a very bad fall . 
  / u/pitchforkemporium please respond . 
  not really a 1 hit wonder imo, 
  huh , uranus is bigger then earth . 
  65434 % actually ... who messed with the sign bit ? 
  probably some vinavil style glue . 
  which has become the biggest `` mafia '' in the last 10 or so years . 
  the violent period of the sicilian mafia has caused the state to cull it harder . 
  corsica is french , sardinia is ... poor so no much criminal activity there . 
  and only businesses are directly affected by mafia organizations , this is how they work . 
  italian mafias are not violent unless you step in their shoes . 
  ie , a tourist would n't ever notice them . 
  yeah , that milk has gone bad 5 months ago . 
  i 'm terrified . 
  they are a storage company that buys consumer grade hardware and overuse them 24/7 for months . 
  those drives are n't built to hold a datacenter workload . 
  backblaze does so because it 's cheaper to replace them then buying enterprise level . 
  probably some turkish breed ^ ^ ^ dog ... ^ ^ ^ boner ... ^ ^ ^ kebab, 
  you are disgusting and i love you . 
  pob , power off button .

  you 're free to get what you want , if it 's separate from a meal . 
  generally speaking there is n't a social drinking culture like in east asia . 
  the `` standard '' coffee after a meal is a * caff\u00e8 * ( caff\u00e8 = espresso ) , but even then you 're not obliged to order one , it 's an option . 
  drinks during a meal are either water ( standard is cold flat water , if you want room temperature you ask for a `` fuori frigo '' ) or a wine from the * carta vini * ( wine menu ) , if the situation is less formal sodas are also an option during a meal . 
  drinking more then ~ 2 glasses of wine might give the idea that you 're one who likes it a little bit too much . 
  the meal culture here is more about * do n't * then * do * . 
  if you want to play safe do n't deviate from standard recipes : no parmesan on fish or balsamic vinegar on recipes with cheese ( the classic foreign `` moral sin '' is balsamic vinegar on caprese salad ) . 
  reddit is fickle , do n't mind the occasional downvote shower . 
  well , i know what to listen for the next 3 days, 
  yeah , it 's too little to even be noticeable . 
  as an fbi agent , thank you . 
  dick my hold i 'm going in !, 
  and even going by gdp per capita / space gdp the us is still on top of a lot of countries . 
  i agree on the refusal of blanket numbers when talking about a complex issue like healthcare . 
  some would argue that a nation should be proactive in taking care or help people in disadvantaged positions , which by being in the position they are have more difficulties voluntarily signing into assistance programs . 
  there would be less deaths if `` maintenance '' healthcare was affordable , this would cull a lot of chronic diseases . 
  disclaimer : i 'm an european , so i 'm not `` in the works '' with the us healthcare , i just wanted to give my pov on this . 
  heh , at least they considered you . 
  exhibit ( e ) a : dlc, 
   tweezers, 
  ouch, 
  but keep some of them to harvest the valuables , you do n't want to get dirty . 
  i love you . 
  was any form of cereal involved in the heist ? 
  if so , how does it compare to a cereal-less scenario ? 
  counter : browser tabs . 
  why ? 
  the recoil from his last neuron flying away negated the one from the explosion .
