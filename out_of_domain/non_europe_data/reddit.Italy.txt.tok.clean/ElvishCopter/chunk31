  ~ ~  i 'm pretty sure all you have to do is bring your american prescription with brand name , active ingredient and dosage of that specific pack [ e.g panadol ( bran name ) - paracetamol ( active ingredient ) - 500mg ( dosage of each pill in that pack ) ] . 
  just ask your doctor for that , as brand names might be different and our pharmacists could not know foreign ones . ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ if it 's your first time in italy , remember that drugs are sold in shops called farmacie ( plural of farmacia ) which you can easily identify looking for a green cross symbol along the streets . 
  in a big city like milan you should n't have any trouble finding an english-speaking pharmacist . 
  enjoy your stay ! ~ ~,
