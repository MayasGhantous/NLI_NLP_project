   3 ) do you fear terrorist attack ? 
  do you have elite troop to counter them ? 
  people have become more worried of terror attacks with isis , but we already had direct experience with internal terror attacks since the late 60 's and until the early 80s ( the period is know as * anni di piombo * , lead years ) , so there has been a dedicated anti-terror infrastructure since then . 
  carabinieri are n't special forces , see 4 ) for more . 
  we have 4 military branches : army , navy , air force , carabinieri . 
  each one has a corp with special forces duties . 
  army has * col moschin * . 
  navy has * comsubin * . 
  air force has * 7th raider storm * . 
  while military , comsubin is also used for general anti-terrorism roles . 
  look 4 ) and you 'll understand . 
  police has a section anti terrorism roles : nocs . 
  is also frequently used for anti-terror roles . 
  finance police ( * guardia di finanza * ) , a different `` flavor '' ( do n't look on italy 's police and military organization , it 's bad for your mental health ) of police and has its own anti-terror section : atpi ( * antiterrorismo pronto impiego * , counter-terrorism rapid response ), 
   4 ) what is the difference between the police and carabinieri ? 
  in france we have the regular police , who act in urban area , and the gendarmerie ( who have more training ) in the country side . 
  it 's the same in italy ? 
  carabinieri are italy 's gendarmerie , they were born as the royal guard . 
  more precisely , police are a civil force that has law enforcement duties in urban areas . 
  carabinieri are a branch of the military that has both military and some of its sections with law enforcement roles , carabinieri are generally regarded as `` rural police '' but they also have presence in most urban centres . 
  carabinieri , being military force , are held under higher standards and have somewhat better equipment then the police ( ie : you 'll find a lot less fat personnel then in the police and their vehicle fleet gets upgraded slightly more frequently ) by personal experience with them they are much more competent and kind then the police . 
  asshole people can be find everywhere , but if you want to be in the police for an underlying desire to bully you 'll be in the police , while carabinieri have a general higher sense of duty . 
   5 ) is being in the italian army a good situation ? 
  in wich specialization the italian army is known ? 
  i heard that the best frogmen are italian ... 
  the italian military , and generally the public sector , saw its funding on a lowering trend since the late 90s to help control the national budget . 
  2016 has been the first year in a while where the funding for the military increased , due to isis & friends situation . 
  the increase was mainly focused on personnel costs , the trapani base , and comsubin `` needs '' .

  a ) were you notified in time ? 
  90 days , starting from day of infraction , is the limit to have a valid fine notified . 
  if not the fine itself gets scrapped . 
  b ) traffic fines themselves are prescribed ( waived ) after 5 calendar years, 
  since you got fined in ( summer ? ), 
  2011 the law enforcement `` chase window '' has expired , so you 're probably in the clean . 
  even then , trivial fines are n't enforced on an international level . 
  yes they do , [ 44 ] ( http://www.gamestop.com/browse?nav=16k-3-monopoly,28zu0 ) to be precise .
