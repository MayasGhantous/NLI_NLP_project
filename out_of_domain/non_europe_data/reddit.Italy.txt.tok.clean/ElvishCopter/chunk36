  he speaks clearly in most songs and his vocabulary is relatively rich , it 's a good listen for someone wanting to learn italian . 
  dammit, 
  how much can you pay ? 
  serve :, 
  disabilitato di giorno . 
  notte : ** 3400k ** , transition speed * low *, 
  * dried piadina night, 
  do n't . 
  fall . 
  cyclic redundancy error ; post already found, 
  haha , thank you for providing an easy viewing method , fellow human . 
  could we have a list of the locations ? 
  they look marvelous . 
  also : it 's refreshing to see `` quadcopter '' instead of the overused `` drone '' . 
  i do n't give a fuck . 
  but i give money . 
  i 'm in !, 
  what about a small note in the corner note with < location , country  that appears few instants for each clip ? 
   just you and your book and your music . 
  and a pc , and gigabit internet , and netflix ... 
  were you editing 90 's music ? 
  an awesome use of awesome . 
  truly a miscellaneous pronounce . 
  if you mainly stretch the parts with few details the result looks decent . 
  itt : argentinian beef is among the best you can get and aztec ruins are marvelous, 
  avoid suitcases completely and use mountain backpacks , they 're also harder to steal . 
  and black . 
  drinking in public is 100 % fine here . 
   hammered, 
  duuuuude , pass it around ... 
  they record it , but do n't waste their time looking every single page visited every single day . 
  nsfw if for when bosses & colleagues pass by you and you want to avoid looking at provocative stuff . 
  not work related . 
  that tile stile is also common in southern europe btw . 
  agree on third world background . 
  i would n't call it unsafe tbh . 
  the island has its problems , but you get bothered by them only if you stay long term . 
  / u/spentrup, 
  well , ~ 100 % people can afford healthy food , a roof over their head and proper medical care . 
  italy 's still quite religious but most people are n't frequent goers , if at all . 
  mainstream culture does n't really dare much and is n't as innovative as in countries with a strong media . 
  talking about media , independent reporting is almost unheard for . 
  society is n't as batshit politically correct as the anglosphere . 
  or gorgonzola , or camembert , etc. .

  the one you nominated seems to have excellent cuisine , the main complaints i could find was overpriced wines . 
  that should n't be a bother for you tho , a luxury every one and then can include some pricey wine . 
  also : be sure to reserve for a day when the chef is actually in the restaurant . 
  do n't let `` he 's usually/always in the kitchen during < days  '' persuade you . 
  you 'll lose much if cracco himself is n't in the kitchen . 
   i 've played this before ,, 
   we had rubber tipped arrows .

  quella sembra la logica dominante se eviti le discussioni su facebook & co. 
  you 're sending a * voluminoso * letter to * zona tariffaria 1 * so :, 
  ( weight , in grams ), 
  350g to < 1000g : $ 8,00, 
  1000g to < 2000g : $ 13,00, 
  if it 's 2kg or more you 're sending a * pacco * , so the price would be at least 22 $ , i 'm afraid you 'll need to go to a post office if that 's the situation you 're in .
