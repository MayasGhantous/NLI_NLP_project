  ohioan sounds like a samurai scream . 
  ** o h a i o a n !, 
  slightly ot : unlike the anglosphere , in italy it 's a good idea to always carry some sort of id on your person . 
  especially if you 're a foreigner . 
  bad mod , doing what you have to do , bad !, 
  really `` excellen '' . 
  dumb answer : have you tried searching for `` wine tour rome '' on google ? 
  it 's clearly an lcd , a blinking red light would work much better . 
  i 've probably missed your implied / s. . . 
  a damn pussy , i tell you . 
  a damn pussy , i tell you . 
  rome is a big city , there are clubs for most music genres ... softair , tennis fields . 
  just think of something you enjoy doing in your free time ( that 's out of the house ) and rome probably has it . 
  lol , good for you . 
  well , let 's do this . 
  you 'll need to reconsider the weight of your shipment until the weight of the postage stamps ( assuming 1gram each ) becomes irrelevant . 
  727 weight : 80,602 lbs, 
  iterated postage weight : 5,687.1367 lbs, 
  total weight : 86,289.1367 lbs, 
  usps can only send up to 70 lbs for each single shipment so :, 
  86,289.1367 lbs / 70 lbs gives us 1233 ( rounded up ), 
  1233 shipments , each one 86,289.1367 / 70 = 69,98 lbs costing 122.09 $ each would be :, 
  122.09 * 69,98 * 1233 * 0.49 = ** 5,161,942 stamps ** 0,49 $ each . 
  edit : ** 4,855,585 ** is the actual amount of stamps needed , see updated calculation below . 
  ok , so :, 
  60.2 grams/square meter is the lightest weight you can have for common paper . 
  a postage stamp is 44x44 millimeters . 
  44x44 millimeters / 1 square meter = 0.001936, 
  weight of a single postage stamp : 60.2 * 0.001936 = 0.11655 grams . 
  for the sake of simplicity and likeness of lightness of postage paper let 's assume 0.1 flat grams . 
  with this new data we 'll just need to multiply the ipw ( iterated postage weight ) by 0.1, 
  ipw * 0.1 = 568.7137 pounds, 
  ipw +727 = 81170.7137 pounds . 
  81170.7137 = 1160 shipments 69.975 pounds each, 
  cost of a 69.975 lbs package = 122.08 $, 
  122.08 * 69.975 * 1160 * 0.49 = ** 4,855,585 ** stamps . 
  thanks for helping us saving on our shipment of 1160 units 69.975 lbs each . 
  that 's 306,357 0.49 $ stamps less . 
  it 's a 150,114.93 $ saving !, 
  well , since you 're not staying for a long time you 'd have rent a field for a few hours and play with a friend . 
  if you do n't know anyone and you really want to play your only option is to hire a coach for a few hours . 
  not if you hide well enough . 
  you do n't even need to have weak knees or broken arms !, 
  i 'm guessing , but looks like a test to see if it can focus well enough to distinguish each concentric circle , line and be able to have homogeneous black on the fat horizontal lines . 
  no idea , but the prices should n't be too far from 20 $ / hr . 
  once you play you do n't need to talk too much . 
  managing to hire him ... no idea tbh . 
  and the real actor dies on set . 
  ( old gods , i hope not ) . 
  they * are * stoned , like most ~ ~ swedish ~ ~ swedish woman . 
  spaghetti incest ? 
  fascists gon na fasc, 
  good coffee and an electric moka machine . 
  it still makes better coffee then most hotels . 
  something like this : http://www.amazon.it/bialetti-elettrika-elettrica-viaggio-110-230/dp/b002ewanqs, 
  it 's not on par on normal mokas but most of the time it 's a better choice then the one in a cheap hotel . 
  on the plus side you can have hot coffe without having to get up from bed . 
  they forgot to put a period at the end of their message . 
  if both your parent are united states citizens you 're a usa citizen . 
  italy has jus sanguinis , not jus soli . 
  weakened business regulations and punishments for tax evasion.he demonstrated his ineptitude in controlling the 2007 market crash . 
  after that his number have been a third of the pre-crisis times and its party still bleeds members . 
  it 's the major pro business player that 's not populist or left . 
  that 's his main vote pool . 
  the other alternative on the right are : far right populists ( lega nord ) , heavily catholic conservatives ( ncd ) , nationalists ( fi ) , other minor right wing parties exist , but they are tiny and lack a clear line . 
  one would vote him if business regulations and fewer social welfare was the two things he/she cared the most about . 
  * less impartial part follows : *, 
  he nominated criminal friends as ministers to shield them from prosecution , bought the silence of various testimonies in tax evasion causes . 
  he also tried to cover up his sexual relationships with a 17 year old prostitute . 
  he won his 3rd nomination by making a big part of his campaign championing the nationality of the heavily indebted flagship passenger airline but failed to save it from being bought later at worst conditions . 
  he 's an incredibly gifted orator , he could sell you your own house . 
  i forgot to mention that he 's a media mogul , and that helped to conditionate a looot of people . 
  he was able to spin the defects of his government to the opposing parties / heavily `` politicized magistrates '' ( that prosecuted him for actual breaches of the law \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af ) / communists . 
  nah , berlusconi is a lot of stuff but not an actual racist . 
  and honestly he 's a real self-made man that started from the working class to achieve a ~ 7,7 bn $ net worth . 
  more or less double of trump 's . 
  take in account that it 's a lot harder to `` making it big '' in italy , and berlusconi did n't receive any loan from his parents . 
  owned half of italy 's media and publishing companies . 
  afaik registry entries are n't duplicable . 
  in theory yes , you could play with the memory and point to various registries , but you 'd have to disable or circumvent most security features . 
  they 're impolite , not outright defamatory . 
  international media liked to republish those outings without giving much context , including the social one . 
  italy is more `` baseline racist '' then the us , but also less anal about political correctness . 
  i do n't remember him using racists remark out of a joke . 
  we always had an inefficient taxation , and berlusconi helped medium-big business , not the bulk of italy 's small ones . 
  i should 've specified that . 
  i do n't have a pov of an american , but to me he seems the only one with a message likeable by the masses , he is inconstant if you look at single events , but `` make america great again '' , `` make them pay for it '' are constant and people like them . 
  also : no other republican seems to have his charisma . 
  he might have had a tougher time , but probably he could have one * at least * his first election . 
  / u/trouauey is right , we had parties that had continuous loss of important members , were unable to compromise at all and the ones remaining lacked charisma . 
  sanders and hillary are actually coherent and have a history of stability and coherence ( yeah , hillary might play dirtier , but she 's still coherent ) . 
  the state needs effective tax collection , we have massive evasion . 
  one can rightly criticize the wrong tax amount requested , equitalia had a lot of flawed files sent out , but the entire italian bureaucracy is inefficient , not only them , it 's a broader problem and not only equitalia 's fault . 
  there have been some reforms to equitalia , so the situation is n't completely stagnant .
