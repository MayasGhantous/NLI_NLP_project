  kinda , but if you only see berlusconi products you get persuaded that what he does is for your good . 
  when he was in office he also had a really high control on state tv , add that to his own media company and ~ 80 % of media have only his rhetoric . 
  la cirsi \u00e8 iniziata a met\u00e0 2007 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial_crisis_of_2007%e2%80%9308#cite_note-g8512-7, 
  here 's a typical meal :, 
  1st course : pasta 80g . 
  280 kcal, 
  - tomato sauce 20g . 
  10 ckal, 
  - extra virgin olive oil 20g . 
  160 kcal, 
  2nd course : meat 100 g. 250 kcal, 
  - side : vegetable 100 g. 100 kcal, 
  - butter 20 g. 150 kcal, 
  fruit 50 kcal, 
  i overestimated on condiments to account for heavier dishes . 
  surprise surprise : exactly 1000 kcal . 
  2x1000 kcal main meals + 1x500 kcal breakfast or 1x250 kcal breakfast + 1x250 kcal snack . 
  total ? 
  2500 kcal . 
  ps : a typical breakfast is a quarter of a sandwich ( * tramezzino * ) or a croissant or a couple of rusks with a thin film of butter and fruit jam plus half a cup of cappuccino . 
  those are vermin , they destroy cultivations . 
  the positive side of this is that boar meat gets somewhat more affordable,

  cost of life in major italian cities is comparable with northern europe ones , while wages ( by profession , not absolutely ) are easily 40 % worse in italy then in germany . 
  the italian job market is also pretty much stagnant , just like our economy . 
  oh , and our financial sector is sliding down , so good luck on getting a decent loan . 
  with [ this ] ( http://www.payscale.com/research/it/job%3dproject_engineer/salary ) vs [ this ] ( http://www.payscale.com/research/de/job%3dproject_engineer/salary ) you can see wages for italy vs german project engineers , and other jobs , more easily . 
  if you can commute ~ 2hr to work you can easily have those costs halved . 
  the tricky part is balancing cheap cost of life with travel stress , less free time and , most important , oil prices .

  ha constatato un fatto . 
  haha sei divertente , vieni a interfacciarti con noi umani su [ r/totallynotrobots ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/totallynotrobots ), 
  bs , greece , is closer to middle east , and the balkans are poorer then italy , so it 's just faster and easier to take that route . 
  now that the balkans are closed the situation might change . 
  yeah !, 
  garlic and hot pepper are 2 object that superstitious people , mainly in the south , use to shoo away bad luck .
