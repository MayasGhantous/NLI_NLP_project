  if one is that dedicated he could run an xp virtual machine on a currently supported os . 
  damn , can not unsee that now . 
  the opposite really , since xp has n't changed in years , and vm programs continued to be updated , the chance is minuscule . 
  xp is also so light by today 's standards that most computers could run a vm of it flawlessly . 
  the only ones i can see still using xp natively are either a corporation that handles security externally from the machine , an offline xp that handles a legacy system , or an incompetent user .

  equiparare musulmani = isis \u00e8 come dire che usa = arsenale di armi in casa . 
  france and belgium have 5x and 3x the muslim per capita , so we 're statistically less exposed . 
  france has banlieues and belgium has cities with up to 25 % of muslim population . 
  there are n't as big clusters of minority religions , so this in and of itself reduces the risk of extremist `` brewing '' . 
  being a secondary player on the international political and muslim immigration scene has also helped . 
  a countering factor is that france and belgium have a significant amount of 3rd and 4th generation immigrant muslim , while italy did n't see significant immigration since the 90s .
