  you might want to go the intel route if you want to really see a difference , or you could buy an fx-83xx / 9370 and still see an improvement . 
  i would n't spend 300 $ now , maybe just upgrade the cpu and wait till you have some funds to get something like a 970 , which will be decently cheap in a few months . 
  edit : even better , intel 's skylake will be out soon , so i5-4xxx will go down in price . 
  if you can you should really wait a couple months and have a better deal . 
  pc master rent should be a thing , much faster and cheaper component turnover .

  repubblica no longer ships paper copies internationally to individuals , and i ca n't find anything for that need , but i can suggest you try one of the following :, 
  a ) get in contact with a random italian to ship you that newspaper and use paypal to pay, 
  b ) try to start a postcard gift exchange , but with newspapers , on some forums or here or both . 
  not long ago we had a postcard exchange that had some 12-20 items sent . 
  good luck anyways .
