  italy 's weird , you have to buy your ticket at a newstand or a bar in 99.9 % of cities and towns . 
  about not paying your fine ... pay it and be done with it , or do n't and discover what will happen :p, 
  well ... * ignorantia legis non excusat * , a person who is unaware of a law may not escape liability . 
  the other route , beside paying , would be to protest it in civil court . 
  i do n't know if the bus driver is mandated to prevent you from entering , that 's the only thing that seems disputable . 
  there 's 4.5 ( .5 is mont blac ) of italy too . 
  nooot really , `` operazione strade sicure '' [ started in 2008 ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/operazione_strade_sicure ) , way before the current pope even took seat . 
  eli5 : glorified city police, 
  eli8 : it 's essentially a task force that uses soldiers to protect important or risky areas . 
  it 's used in large numbers when there is a high security threat , eg threats of bad guys wanting to go boom-boom in rome .

  [ edit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4es0me/italy_has_more_poor_than_any_eu_member/ ) :, 
   * in absolute numbers . 
   just by looking at [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:at-risk-of-poverty_rate_and_at-risk-of-poverty_threshold_\\ ( for_a_single_person \\ ) , _ 2013_and_2014 . png ) one can see that italy * is * on the lower end , but still 6 position above the country with more % of poor people per capita . 
  eh , i liked this last bit . 
  it 's just that tad bit over the edge without being absurd . 
  because they are , it 's from a 19something show . 
  vlc seeking is mediocre at best . 
  unless your guitar is made of fish or potatoes you do n't have to worry about taxes . 
  not really , norway is in the european economic area , and only a few select product are restricted . 
  canada is not in the ~ ~ [ eec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_community ) . ~ ~ [ efta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_free_trade_association#current_members ), 
  i used potatoes and fish because food items are one of the few restricted imports from norway . 
  most of their trade is done with the eu , they ca n't really be an outlier . 
  i like mpc-hc . 
  it 's less powerful then vlc ( unless you take time to tinker with it ) , but i fire it up if i think there 's a need to skip frequently . 
  the guts of your system do n't really matter , unless you 're playing a 4k video on a cheap laptop or your pc is from the past millennium . 
  intel quick sync is useful for high res content , but even the it 's not a game changer . 
  it 's better with an example : [ this ] ( https://d1rktuf34l9h2g.cloudfront.net/4/40/4076dc2f_ujyfr.png ) is 99 % vlc 's `` fault '' . 
  are you poor ? 
  just get rich !, 
  lazy scum . 
  ! goodjob . 
  * upon paper plate, 
  that 's not in the spirit of your username . 
  one betrays him for a thirty month permit . 
  it really depends in which part of europe you are . 
  ee is surely more scared of russia , but isis is a much direr threat to both we and the bigger se nations . 
  not if it acts as a high tier router + webserver + nas+d ownload box . 
  those 200 $ will easily last you 5 years , and can be configured in a way a commercial router ( of the same price ) ca n't . 
  wooha .

  you 're interested in the `` intrattenimento '' offer . 
  navigating that website is a pain , and they do n't technically have a proper schedule . 
  you have to go on the [ regular website schedule ] ( http://guidatv.sky.it/guidatv/grid.html ) and look at the corresponding channel . 
  one thing is sure : the new episodes are in livestream each monday at 03:00 am . 
  italian episodes at 21:00 have a 2 week delay for dubbing reasons . 
  i do n't have sky online , but the new episodes should be watchable on demand a few hours after the livestream at worst .

   she had found out he had been arrested two weeks before for creating a distributing child pornography and she was not happy and had told him to leave and never contact any of the family again . 
  i 'm missing something here , how 's that he got arrested but also managed to chop his mother to bits and hide her remains ? 
  out on bail ?

  i suppose they implied that the closer family members get into denial , but worded that poorly . 
  gouda has a ~ 50 % fat content , while mozzarella topping for pizza must be in the 15-20 % . 
  it 's understandable that you got nauseous with your local pizzas . 
  [ red pesto ] ( http://www.food.com/recipe/best-red-pesto-sauce-76698 ) is a thing , it 's the same recipe as regular pesto plus dried tomatoes . 
  it 's a vegetable ( not vegan , pesto has cheese in it ) soup , a bland one at it too . 
  you do n't have to jerk off all day and cryyyy . 
  parmesan is in the recipe partly for the flavor , but also as a binder . 
  it 's likely to be `` flaky '' without it .
