  you 're a tourist , nothing serious will happen to you . 
  trouble happens to people that fiddle with power . 
  if the friend is a minor look for `` numero azzurro '' . 
  then your best bet is contacting the italian embassy , but i 'm not sure if that 's going to be as useful , i 'm sorry .

  eh , you 're right . 
  gendarmerie are on par with monarchies : they made sense 2 centuries ago .

  aside from the wiki linked by the bot take a look at [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/3vee75/il_grande_itinerario_ottimale_ditalia_fatto_dagli/ ) , images 7 and 18 . 
  it 's an optimized travel plan . 
  that 's where social democracy stem out of it .

  if you 're in a central-ish area in a main city ( bologna , milan , turin ) both fastweb and vodafone are valid alternatives . 
   ** what is reddit ? 
   reddit is a source for what 's new and popular on the web . 
   users like you provide all of the content and decide , through voting , what 's good and what 's junk . 
   links that receive community approval bubble up towards # 1 , so the front page is constantly in motion and ( hopefully ) filled with fresh , interesting links .

  the abarth line is decent . 
  that 's ballistic gel , it has the same `` penetrability '' as human skin/meat . 
  hippo skins are way tougher than us . 
  people are almost ignoring the truth here , imo . 
  most people , especially those that are n't in the more international cities , are racist towards three main groups ( more to less racist ) :, 
  - gypsies, 
  - asians, 
  - blacks,

  reward the cat when it brings mice/snakes and lightly punish it when it bring birds . 
  traveler 's common sense is enough , a money belt is good too . 
  i think you took the skimming part too literally :p, 
  you 've been living under a rock if you did n't see the anti corruption measures that were taken in place these last 5 years .

  the most common kind of discrimination is towards one 's looks , and the looks of a lot of italians and middle eastern overlap , so you wo n't see the same level of discrimination someone with a more different appearance encounters . 
  that is not to say italy is the best place in the world for a muslim , good luck getting the permit for a cultural centre/mosque , especially in the northeast . 
  i believe you 're right : global warming does n't exist in texas .

  uhm , any chance you could give use a rough budget ( souvenir , luxury clothes , anything in between ... ) and area where your boss will stay ( north/center/south , maybe the city ... ) ? 
  that 'll help narrow down the choice . 
  good luck passing that through the airport check in . 
  hm , if he 's near catania you could ask for something made out of volcanic stone from the etna volcano . 
  i think he shrinks with temperature , in [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/osha/comments/46ku2v/the_ladder_is_in_the_other_room/ ) he seems tiny . 
  i 've also seen light colored long jeans , bright shirt and no accessory as a common `` style '' . 
  shot in the dark : have you tried contacting the airport helpline and see if they are of some help ?

   it is true that the idea of conquest is inherent in the soul of islam . 
  however , it is also possible to interpret the objective in matthew 's gospel , where jesus sends his disciples to all nations , in terms of the same idea of conquest .

  loose --  free food in the camboose, 
  i think i 've found the limit , if i let it grow more it looks too asymmetrical . 
  there 's a spot that grows a lot of hair . 
   1 ) it is true that kraft `` parmesan '' in the green can is a low quality food . 
  2 ) it is true that parmesan-reggiano made under the food provenance laws is a high quality food 3 ) it is not true that following the food provenance laws is necessary to produce a high quality food . 
   is this more of a protection on `` you ca n't label this parmigiano because it 's not from the same location , therefore the formaggio made in the region should be protected '' more than the quality of the product ? 
  this , the italians ( food makers ) are ridiculously conservative .
