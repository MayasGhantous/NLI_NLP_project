  ftfy, 
  they trap you in their ecosystem of services , they are already tracking you , no need for spyware . 
  no need for it , i would n't have understood it anyway . 
  `` trap '' in the sense that the typical apple ( or google ) user hardly uses only one of their services . 
  think of the apple icloud , music , apple maps combo vs google maps , drive , music , instead of ... dropbox , spotify , here . 
  most users use a plethora of services from the same company which in turn can precisely profile who they are . 
  not bad per se , just food for thoughts . 
  ma quanto \u00e8 bello usare amazon.de hehe, 
  we meet again . 
  instructions unclear , ate a dick . 
  wait ... 
  dumbing down the discussion to this level is idiotic . 
  what a pretty teacup . 
  ... best sex ?

  gorgeous, 
  sorry , missed again ... 
  i should pay more attention . 
  here they are . 
  i do n't know anymore ... 
  doxxing is a real thing , avoid posting identifying information for the world to see .
