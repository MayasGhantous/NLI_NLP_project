  they should also sell glazed balsamic vinegar , at least here in italy they do . 
  it 's in italian , but i 'll link you the trains that will not be influenced by the strike :,

  have you tried asking trenitalia ( just go to a station , do n't lose time with their phone support ) or even the hotel lobby for advice ?

  the quantum part is the existence of the actual funding . 
  that 's why the linked picture is mildly infuriating . 
  ** uscita ** ( oo-sheet-ah ) , and the word literally translates to * exit * . 
  nor-win sounds way better . 
  nor-win-dipendence also flows well .

  it 's not a `` new constitution '' . 
  eli15 : it 's just a change to the representativity of the two parliamentary houses with a lower house on steroids and upper house that mainly focuses on regional affairs . 
  the referendum polls are giving pre-brexit levels of uncertainty , * but * no the the reform has been continuously gaining steam .

  true . 
  it 's intended to be a joke about the user using two words , each one related to the other , in two different comments . 
  ... probably this explanation will confuse you even more :p, 
  younger people are/were considerably more pro-remain , and also had a lower turnout . 
  this referendum is an official result , but it 's not perfectly reflective of the opinion of british people as a whole . 
  the common market referendum of 1975 had an `` enormous '' margin , 32.77 % no vs 67.23 % yes , 2.05:1 . 
  that 's an `` enormous '' margin , not the 3.78 % , 1.08:1 , of two days ago . 
  i countered / u/baryn point , not the merit of the complaining people ... 
  you are mixing global opinion , your first sentence , with official results in the second . 
   can you point me to an election that is perfectly reflective of a people as a whole ? 
  exactly because of that this, 
   less than half, 
  is nonsensical . 
   `` leave '' was a landslide victory . 
  where in the world of politics is 3.78 % a landslide ? 
  leave most certainly won , but not with overwhelming majority . 
  anything different from perfect parity is definitive , but exactly because it 's politics you ca n't just belittle the importance of something where opinions are marginally different . 
  do you even negotiate ? 
  the same can be said for the flock of over 65 ... international treaties are n't really a matter that should be put to referendum , they 're way too complex for a yes/no vote from experts , asking the general population its opinion is madness .

  but next time it could be me :d, 
  eh , they have to waste a ton of precious artillery blanks each time a monarch visits . 
  sounds like a sound reason for independence . 
  there 's no noticeable increase in detail , and that original image also shows compression artifacts around the mouth area , on the eye creases and on most sections with high contrast ... but alright .
