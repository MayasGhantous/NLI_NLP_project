  woah, 
  renzi 's government eased labour laws and has generally been more pro-business and anti tax evasion than most of the past governments , but populism is gaining more and more steam .

  we always had high taxes , all of europe does to some extent . 
  social welfare does n't grow on trees . 
  people are ownvoting you , but what you 're saying is just savvy negotiation . 
  voi come lo fate ? 
  a politician can not make instantaneous changes , and even then stagnation is better than outright recession . 
  like it or not work mobility is virtually nil here , you 're hired only if a business is 100 % sure that you 're worth hiring since firing is incredibly difficult . 
  vouchers are a shit solution , but they only come in existence because there was no compromise contract type between full time and freelance employment . 
  police state ... as in knowing how much a business has to pay in taxes . 
  ok . we have one of europe 's higher tax evasion rates , either people magically start being honest or the state has to go down hard on them . 
  this is not to say that effort to check evasion is not unbalanced towards smaller businesses , but what needed is more effort to check due taxes on everyone , not less . 
  this is not a black and white situation , but of course political rivals try to exploit every flaw while ignoring what actually worked .

  it would result in a grind where one or more attackers literally run into the net . 
  it 's to add difficulty to the game , the same logic with rugby and forward passes being disallowed . 
  since you pass the ball by kicking it the game would essentially be kick the ball near the adversary 's net from wherever you are and let 21 people rush in a 16x11m area . 
  you ... you are the one . 
  what you need to do is : go to the nearest cathedral at 10:25 am on a sunday , lock the two complementary parts together and wait for the revelation .

  i hope i 'm not talking too soon , but january-june 2015 saw 74947 arrivals , the same period for 2016 saw `` only '' 65478 ( -14 % ) . 
  as of now their numbers are diminishing .

  it 's true that less migrants `` leak '' into northern europe , so in practice italy sees an increase in migrants presence on its territory . 
  that was n't insulting , she was just considering you as her pair . 
  i 'm worried of the opposite , she might get to attached to humans and either be unable to feed itself or get killed by wandering around settlements . 
  hmmm , react vlog network ... 
  so you can see them better from afar , and avoid to get too close before it 's too late . 
  amazing body , but her face looks weird imo . 
  i 'm not disagreeing with you , but a stable trend is a symptom of a stabilization , which is better than the outright anarchy we had 2 years ago . 
  huh , do you have any data to prove that irregular migrants in italy are more fertile ? 
  it 's also quite interesting that you created this account to answer specifically to me \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  help me understand , your solution would be to create even more tension than the one already existing by being openly hostile to those people ? 
  i ca n't see how this could be a better alternative . 
  i still have to see hard data ... [ the only one i could find ] ( http://www.ilpost.it/2015/02/05/dati-istat-madri-italia/ ) shows that foreigner fertility is barely at replacement levels , 2.1 . 
  which does not effectively increase the numbers of foreigners on the long run , but barely maintains the number stable . 
  the problem is not high foreigner fertility , but the low 1,29 for italians . 
  2,1 is barely [ replacement fertility ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sub-replacement_fertility ) ... ( also 2,1 is 63 % , hardly `` almost double '' ), 
  what you are saying is valid only if those children live in completely segregated communities , which i have to find an example in italy ( note : roma camps . 
  africans are n't roma ) . 
  once those people have children here and socialize with italian people how is this going to replace ( ? ), 
  our culture ? 
  if someone is integrated they start to fall in line with national averages , fertility for second-third gen immigrants are essentially on par with native people . 
   deport the irregular immigrants, 
  to do that you need stability in the countries of departure , in the meantime you either let them drown or take them . 
  frontex is actually moving in the direction of making departure more difficult , but this is going to take years . 
  a turkey like deal with libya is impossible until the nation gets an effective government , and there is no interest from the third party north african countries to act as hotspots . 
  france has banlieue and is extremely centralized , so you can exclude the parallel since our two societies are just too different .
