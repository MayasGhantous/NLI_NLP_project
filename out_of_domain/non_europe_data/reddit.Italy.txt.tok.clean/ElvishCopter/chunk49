  belgium has had extremely lax immigration rules and ius soli . 
  britain criminal rates seem to be descending for the past 5 years , hardly a society in crisis . 
   you keep getting more and more fertile first generation immigrants, 
  we talked up to this point that the numbers are getting flat ... 
   in the main cities often the immigrants outnumber the italians in some classes, 
  \\  often, 
  \\  some, 
  gambia is a military dictatorship , although i would agree with you if it was nigeria or kenya . 
  which at the end are the main countries of origin . 
  pakistan is also a nasty situation since they often refuse to take back their migrants . 
   egypt, 
  good luck negotiating with a dictator that refused to collaborate on just a single murder case ( regeni ) . 
   algeria and tunisia, 
  virtually nil influx from tunisia and algeria to italy when compared to libya , they should n't take foreigners that have no business there . 
  [ she 's fine now ] ( https://youtu.be/akhbcu1enta?t=14s ), 
  give them a break guys , they live in a socialist nightmare where everything is handed down by the nanny state . 
  they ca n't function alone . 
  as long as that is not iron powder there 's no real risk in having a dusty pc , worst that could happen is overheating . 
  earlier today imgur betrayed me , here 's the full size picture . 
  because gifv is just a webm video in disguise .

  i had this happen when using a localhost level blocklist , i think the page waits for a `` ping '' from the ( blocked ) content , specific implementation does n't matter , to hide the popup . 
  https://youtu.be/qhwqmuks5bo?t=6s is as close as i could find . 
  btw , fapcam is out of boundaries for this sub . 
  it 's more * the other one * material .

  i did n't think seolhyun was that old .

  i went to munich once , beer there was cheaper than most of our bottled waters lol, 
  i appreciate this chain of italianismo . 
  japan has plenty of high rises and it 's one of the most seismically active countries . 
  i do agree that single family buildings are much better of if made out of wood . 
  already submitted 5 months ago , but this is higher quality from the [ original tistory ] ( http://onlysooobin.tistory.com/5 ) and does n't have that awful instagram filter . 
  tried to polish it a bit , but it loses some detail . 
  she is . 
  i missed it . 
  in my defense it is over 90 days old .
