  found the capitalist spy . 
   the process begins when the workers of a city elect their local soviet . 
  this body holds both legislative and executive power for that city . 
  the idea is identical to that of the paris commune . 
  the local soviets choose their delegates for their district soviet . 
  these district soviets in turn elect their provincial soviet . 
  lastly , the provincial soviets then choose their delegates for the regional soviet . 
  each soviet has legislative-executive power over the territory it governs . 
   this elective process of a group of soviets electing the council above it continues until the national soviet , which is the supreme governing body of the nation . 
   each large soviet ( including some larger locals ) elects a small executive committee . 
  this assembly deals with the day-to-day affairs of the territory that its soviet governs . 
  the executive committee is subservient to its soviet , its actions must be in accordance with the soviet 's legislation , and it only operates during times when the soviet is not in session . 
   the theory is that members of the soviets , being close to those workers or lower soviet members that they represent , can thereby accurately translate the people 's decisions into legislation , and be more responsive than a centralized parliamentary democracy . 
  ultimately soviet democracy is based on direct democracy , especially with its advocacy of recallable delegates, 
  with this you 're already more italian than half of italy itself .
