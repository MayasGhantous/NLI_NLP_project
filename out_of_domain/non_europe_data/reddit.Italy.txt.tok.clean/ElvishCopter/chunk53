  - ( 3000 minutes , 3gb , free [ for first 6 months ] unlimited hey-we-can-copy-spotify proprietary music streaming ) / 28 days . 
  tim music is an additional 7.99 $ / 28 days fee, 
  - data offer for foreign citizens : 10 additional gb/28 days . 
  can be combined to any other offer . 
  i did n't add activation fees , which become irrelevant for a 36 month use . 
  there are also some more combinations , look [ here for tim ] ( https://www.tim.it/offerte/mobile/voce-e-internet#section5 ) and [ here for vodafone ] ( http://www.vodafone.it/portal/privati/tariffe-e-prodotti/tariffe/tariffe-per-smartphone-vodafone?icmp=hp_box_1#flexiid ), 
  ** tl ; dr ** if you stream a ton of music while on data go for vodafone , if not tim should be slightly cheaper with more monthly gb . 
  local sms and call costs which are not in a `` packet '' are not enormously different between the two ( 0.12-0 .15 $ / sms . 
  not sure about calls , but should be ~ 0.15 $ connection fee plus ~ 0.20 $ / min ), 
  i 've written this at 3am , so forgive me for errors you could find above .

  like most of rural central italian buildings they were old buildings on with foundations on brittle ground . 
  oh , and the more south you go the less building codes are respected . 
  not really , the closest you 'll ever be ( rome ) to the affected areas is still  120 miles with a mountain range in between . 
  and syria !, 
  go to your imgur account settings -  tick the box `` upload images in higher quality '' . 
  that should allow you to do higher quality uploads . 
  your upload quality limit is further lowered if you upload without using an account , maybe that 's why . 
  it saves money for imgur , less bandwidth = cheaper . 
  uh , you did n't have to . 
  sorry for your karma :p, 
  ps : if you use reddit 's own image hosting you do n't have to create a new account , plus the size limit is 20mb . 
  the only downside is that you ca n't make albums .

  uh , salve compatriota . 
  unless you and your family and their past generations lived in a commune made only by southern european your physique will not look like an italian . 
  add to that an explicit request to `` fit in '' is a stereotypical us attitude . 
  they have a `` destruction area '' with a radius of a few hundred meters , they do n't need to get right on target . 
   chiederemo a chiunque posti thread con poca attinenza con l\u2019italia ( off topic ), 
  finalmente , per r/all all ` italiana esiste gi\u00e0 facebook . 
  it 's working as intended , why develop a custom tool just for login ? 
  lazy at most , not really gore-y . 
  you should just learn how to use spotify tbh . 
  is the second most followed playlist if you search `` italiana '' , and has recent italian only pop songs . 
  sorry if my comment sounded too harsh . 
  nothing else to add , bbye . 
  lago trasimeno has a mountain range separating it from the earthquake affected areas , and norcia , being built with adequate standards , saw almost no damage . 
  hell , as long as you stay within umbria borders i doubt you 'll see areas affected by this last earthquake . 
  that 's why backup and travel insurance exist , but nah ... would something like that happen to * me * ?
