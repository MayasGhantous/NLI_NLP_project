  yeah , the sets before this were way better . 
  martial arts are more popular that wrestling/greek roman . 
  taekwondo and judo have a significant following . 
  [ page 7 ] ( http://www.coni.it/images/numeri_dello_sport/lo_sport_in_italia.pdf ) lists the numbers of the main professional sport memberships , it should give you an idea of what 's popular . 
  the bulk of metal scene is in the north/northeast regions , ie the areas with higher austrian/slavic influence . 
   what does it take to legally own/carry firearms in italy ? 
  a clean record and a couple psychological assessments . 
  to get a concealed carry permit you need a `` valid reason '' , ie you have to demonstrate you 're in active danger ( eg , jeweler , you 're being stalked , ... ), 
  magazines for hunting weapons are also fairly limited in capacity , pistol hunting is illegal . 
  i think if you have a gun licence you need to renew after 6 years , but do n't quote me on this . 
  if you use a gun for self defense , or god forbid shoot in the air to scare an aggressor even if it 's in your residence , the police will try to find any quibble to give you a fine .
