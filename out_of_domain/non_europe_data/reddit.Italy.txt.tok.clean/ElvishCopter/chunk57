   if you want to set the text size/pixel density in firefox different from that of your system 's settings like it was handled in prior versions , enter ** about : config ** into the firefox address bar ( confirm the info message in case it shows up ) & search for the preference named ** layout.css.devpixelsperpx ** . 
   double-click it and ** change its value to 1.0 ** ( or any other zoom factor that fits your purpose ; ** -1.0 is the default ** value and will adhere to the system settings ) .

  seems to me like someone that thinks mediocre tomato sauce is automatically ketchup . 
  paprika and/or sugar are commonly added to balance sub-par quality tomatoes , so that last part is plausible . 
  i honestly doubt that a non-specialty pizza place would use ketchup , most italians are traditionalists and there 's massive competition in the pizza industry .
