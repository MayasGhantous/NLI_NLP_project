  what the fuck did you just fucking say about me , you little panettonwhore ? 
  i 'll have you know i graduated top of my class in the col pandor , and i 've been involved in numerous secret raids on bauli panettone facilities , and i have over 300 confirmed pandoro recipes . 
  i am trained in zucchero a velo warfare and i 'm the top baker in the entire culinary industry . 
  you are nothing to me but just another discarded tray . 
  i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth , mark my fucking words . 
  you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet ? 
  think again , fucker . 
  as we speak i am contacting my secret network of starred restaurant owners in the eu and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm , maggot . 
  the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life . 
  you 're fucking dead , kid . 
  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can bake you in over seven hundred trays , and that 's just with my bare hands . 
  not only am i extensively trained in blinded breading , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the cgil , cisl e uil and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent , you little shit . 
  if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking canditi . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , you goddamn idiot . 
  i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it . 
  you 're fucking dead , kiddo .
