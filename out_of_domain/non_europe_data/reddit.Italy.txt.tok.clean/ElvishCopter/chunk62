   in most modern lcd 's the natural state is a black image , so it uses less power than an all white image . 
  an example of this is in an iphone ( ips technology ) . 
  ips is ips so this should answer op 's question . 
  ips is also used in most ultrawides since they must have a wide viewable angle . 
  their algorithm `` simply '' forces the panel/part of it to return to rest state ( black ) , especially darker areas , to save power . 
  useful to save a few watts during normal use , but creates noticeable flickering during a fast paced movie/game .

  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_navarro ), 
   navarro 's views on trade and china have been widely characterized by economists as fringe . 
  university of michigan economist justin wolfers described them as far `` outside the mainstream , '' noting that `` he endorses few of the key tenets of '' the economics profession . 
  scott sumner , the ralph g. hawtrey chair of monetary policy at the mercatus center at george mason university , said that navarro 's views on trade economics and macroeconomics , two sub-fields that navarro has published no peer-reviewed research in , demonstrate basic errors and confused thinking . 
   navarro has , for instance , repeatedly characterized value-added taxes as a tariff , whereas sumner notes that `` this is a very basic error . 
  international economists almost universally agree that a vat is neutral with respect to trade . '', 
  a new yorker reporter described navarro 's views on trade and china as so radical `` that , even with his assistance , i was unable to find another economist who fully agrees with them . '', 
  tim worstall , senior fellow at the adam smith institute , has described navarro as `` alarmingly ignorant about trade '' . 
   according to worstall , the reason why there are no economists who support navarro 's views is because he makes very basic errors about trade economics . 
  according to richard baldwin , professor of international economics at the graduate institute , geneva , navarro 's economic plan for trump reflects `` astoundingly ignorant economics '' .
