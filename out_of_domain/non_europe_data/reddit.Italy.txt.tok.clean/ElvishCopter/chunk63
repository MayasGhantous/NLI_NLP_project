  dan ikenson , director of cato 's herbert a. stiefel center for trade policy studies , described navarro 's views on trade as `` misguided '' and `` dangerous '' . 
  the economist magazine has described navarro 's views on trade as `` dodgy economics '' and `` fantasy '' .

   comparing the family wealth to those with the same surname today , they suggest the richest families in florence 600 years ago remain the same now .

  bagna cauda : garlic , anchovies , olive oil , butter broiled together for a few hours . 
  commonly eaten by dipping crunchy vegetables in it . 
  sardinia . 
  bottarga : dried fish eggs ( mostly mullet and tuna ) , found as a powder or sticks . 
  an easy recipe with it would be : heat some olive oil in a wide pan , put bottarga in it ( half a teaspoon per person ) and grate just a pinch of lemon peel in it . 
  throw your cooked spaghetti in it and serve . 
  look for keyboard cleaning gels . 
  they are this squishy blobs that you press on your keyboard and suck away most of the gunk . 
  awful for the environment tho . 
  if one has two functioning hands it should n't take more than 1-1 .5 hours from prep to serving . 
  the original estimate was from personal experience , and i tend to diverge easily from plans :p, 
  most of the time will be taken by the slow cooking needed to reduce the garlic cloves into a quasi-homogeneous cream . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/bagnacauda_79923 ) seems a recipe close to the original without `` americanization '' ( eg : no heavy creams nor evo substitutes nor non mediterranean spices ), 
  if you put the garlic through a [ rough grater ] ( http://www.ikea.com/piaimages/23279_pe098510_s5.jpg ) instead of smashing them you could probably cut a few more minutes .

  ftfy, 
  unless you 're in a international branch italian is required . 
  the job situation is abysmal , you 'd have to compete with the 12 % jobless rate and ~ 35 % youth one , make out of this what you want . 
   regarding the refugee crisis : do you feel italy and greece have been left alone by europe in managing it ? 
  pretty much , while italy promotes refugee redistribution it 's an absolute moot point on a eu-wide level . 
  eu funds do help with the situation , but the sheer volume of people arriving coupled with populism make the population feel unease towards other eu members , with germany as the boogeyman . 
   regarding europe : if you had the choice , would you like europe to become more german or more french ? 
  we 're talking idealistically , so i 'd say a mix of french separation of religion and state , energy independence and german integration policies ( french banlieues , just no ) and fiscal policy . 
  an addendum : the german education system seems too classist and the french too elitist ... can i choose to use a northern model , ideally the finnish or danish one :p ? 
  political wise france is never talked about as an example , while germany has frequently passed in the discourse . 
  the difficult economical situation has caused budget cuts which further distances us from implementing french policies . 
   what 's the most underestimate italian city in your opinion ? 
  hessh , we were a flurry of city states up to the mid 1800 's , so i could say pretty much anything . 
  i 'll go by discrepancy towards internal and international tourism : anything in the sardinia island , relatively popular internally but shunned by most international tourists ( bar a cluster of russian oil money ) .

  there 's some stuff in [ the wiki ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/wiki/piemonte ), 
  it has n't been updated in ages tho, 
  to each their own , c ' \u00e8 a chi piace l'aspetto competitivo e chi quello ludico . 
  it was a tongue-in-cheek tag on a thread trend , not to be taken seriously . 
  the submission title was `` the most ukrainian of russian occupied territories '' , which in and of itself takes a side in the matter . 
   the mafia, 
  that 's oversimplifying it lol . 
  there are 3 main syndicates and a few minor ones . 
  the main ones are ( most -  less powerful ) :, 
   camorra, 
   cosa nostra ( the one north american consider `` mafia '' and generalize to mean all syndicates ), 
  like all syndicates one is personally affected if they actually go against the organizations ' interests . 
  a law abiding citizen would be personally affected by criminals pretending a weekly/monthly protection fee . 
  they could also see substandard service quality due to cuts in eg building a road with substandard material . 
  blep, 
  sunflower and to a lesser extent peanut are pretty much staples . 
  hard to find a home that does n't have them . 
  the situation is ... fluid right now . 
  there are more or less 3 equal fronts :, 
  - government center-left , one main party allied with centrist/catholic conservatives, 
  - right , main parties are a far right populist , an old school center right and a couple minor nationalists, 
  - anti system populists , more or less right leaning,
