  gnocchi with tomato paprika sauce and minced meat . 
  preparation + cooking 20 minutes at most . 
  ingredients :, 
  - minced meat, 
  - oil , ideally evo . 
  anything else is good too . 
  - a clove of garlic/half a coffee spoon of garlic powder, 
  - tomato sauce , if concentrated dilute in equal amount of water, 
  take the pasta water ( ~ 700 ml per 80-100g portion of gnocchi ) to a boil , add salt , add gnocchi . 
  while waiting for the water to boil saut\u00e8 the meat in the oil and garlic ( if using crushed garlic brown the clove then remove it and add the meat ) . 
  add tomato sauce , add paprika . 
  do not salt , the pasta has enough in it . 
  as soon as the meat turns white remove from heat . 
  throw your drained gnocchi al dente in the sauce and reheat , cook on low flame until ready . 
  gnocchi are lightning fast , as soon as the first ones start to float drain the water and put continue cooking in the sauce .

   3 ) here in israel italian cousine is one of the most popular cousines we have . 
  what common israeli food ( food that is common in israel , cause israeli food is mainly a mix of other cultural foods ) would you say you like or sounds good to you ? 
  a good amount of kebab/p joints also make falaffef, 
   4 ) besides your amazing italian food , what is a foreign cousine you guys really like ? 
  umami is a flavour seldomly found in the western cuisine , so i would like to say chinese and japanese mostly because those recipes are easy to replicate here .

  you can hear what seems like the `` t-nuk '' sound of the knees , does n't seem like it 's just shoes hitting the floor to me . 
  even if it 's not a strong hit just imagine practicing and performing dozens of times . 
  edit : grammar, 
  sinb looks nice , recent styles made her face look a bit too puffy . 
  i 'm not really sure about sowon , that style would probably look better if at collarbone/half bicep lenght imho .

  we 'd need to know op 's exact windows version to be sure tho . 
  people bitch a lot about w10 but they 've made it pretty hard to break it ( if you start from a clean install or upgraded from a freshly installed w7/8 , otherwise it frequently got iffy ),
