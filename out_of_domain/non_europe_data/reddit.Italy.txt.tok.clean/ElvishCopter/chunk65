  `` select few '', 
  [ late february ] ( http://soonduck.tistory.com/571 ) this year , in 2016 the whole group had a lot of international activites ... and it showed . 
  in their most recent vs they all looked ok luckily . 
  mfw no unicode in domain .

  yes . 
  mais ? 
  i tried to make kimchi with ingredients i could find here , starting with a generic cabbage and ended up with a 5 liter container full the dish once ready . 
  tasted quite alright but preparing it from scratch was quite a hassle . 
  remove the metal studs and that 's right up my alley . 
  awards ceremony iirc by the outfit, 
  `` idols '' , extremely popular format in japan and korea , the former makes most of this sub 's submission . 
  they 're ( technically ) singers , but image takes presence over skill . 
  they train for years to be heavily marketable since debut . 
  korea specific addendum :, 
  an aspiring idol gets scouted in korea but also internationally in se asia and us/canada ( in na case it 's an unwritten rule that they must be at least 50 % asian by blood ) . 
  foreign trainees have korean language and culture classes included in their training . 
  pre-debut each of them trains for at least a few years from a young age , eg : it 's not uncommon to train 5 + years under an agency before ever appearing in the public scene . 
  most of the aspiring idols get heavily indebted towards those agencies for the pre-debut training . 
  it 's also common for a group to have a 10 year max age gap between members . 
  the following happens ~ 2 times a year for a successful act : album gets published with a corollary of promotions in a lot of tv music and reality programs for a few weeks , then freeze activities . 
  this happens because agencies ( media conglomerates really ) have total control over their public personas , including diet and communication with the outside . 
  this total control causes conflit with the most successful foreign members , that are initially selected to make the group marketable to other se asian countries . 
  they try legal means to invalidate the contracts to be free to use their fame as a starting point to a more indipendent activity in their home country . 
  chinese idols are the most frequent deployers of this tactic . 
  this should have summed up most of what kpop is . 
  for a more insigtful explanation [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k-pop ) does quite a good job .

  you 're one of the lucky few ,

  simplistic for the sake of brevity . 
  1992 , a hip hop/boyband group ( seo taiji and boys ) introduce the boyband model in korea . 
  massively successfull , the model was perfected by us educated lee soo-man . 
  why ? 
  some keywords :, 
  eastern asian style mixed economy system, 
  corporativism, 
  historical rigidity and uniformity of personal appearance, 
  1 . alternate model to european social democracy and us strongly capitalist economy . 
  tl ; dr capitalism but with strong state endorsement of some industries . 
  some examples : hk , singapore -  finance ; taiwan , south korea -  it . 
  south korea also endorses k-pop since the new millenia, 
  society centered towards being a gear in the system ( see how this fits well with the previous point ? ), 
  more descriptively : korean identity can be traced back to 2300 * bc * . 
  from then on it was shielded from major external influence by its condition as a peninsula difficult to reach by sea , and interest from the various chinese dinasties to keep it subjugated but not assimilated . 
  korea is comparable to denmark , as long as they keep friendly with their more powerful neigbours they have been left indipendent . 
  ps : the objective oversexualization of idols is due to guess what ? 
  pornography being banned combined with external appearance being highly regarded, 
  `` if you describe something as regal , you mean that it is suitable for a king or queen , because it is very impressive or beautiful . '', 
  the white areas in the vehicles do n't activate the tooltip , marvellous . 
  that 's the typical jpeg blur on areas of high contrast . 
  if it can be of any consolation her more recent photos show that she 's focusing more on gaining muscle than being thin . 
  give a medal to the hair stylist , she looks amazing here . 
  asus p2530ua-xo0119d : miglior processore , no sistema operativo installato, 
  asus x554lj-xx106h : `` pronto all ` uso '' , un po ' meno performante, 
  la differenza tra 4 e 8gb di ram \u00e8 meno importante di un processore pi\u00f9 veloce .

  tl ; dr : just send an adult to buy what you and your friend want and drink in your hotel room . 
  selling/serving to a minor ( < 18 ) is illegal . 
  * consumption * itself does not have an age limit , in practice you ca n't legally drink in a social venue but if a friend buys some and you share it in a private place all okey-dokey . 
   he results say that drinking/buying wine and beer is permitted from 16 and up while hard liquor is 18 and up ,, 
  nope , that 's a thing only in the `` germanic '' part of europe .
