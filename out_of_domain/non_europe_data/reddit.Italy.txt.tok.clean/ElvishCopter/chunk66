  you could use regex to match any flair with `` of europe '' in it . 
  just put the following in the res flair filter list, 
  / \\ b ( of europe ) \\ b/i, 
  by what you 're saying it seems that you have conflicting filters , try removing any of those that affect r/europe and start from scratch with the code i 've posted above . 
  the filter configuration should look [ like this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/snytnbz.png ) . 
  you should also have regexp filters set `` on '',

  it is true that the userbase is somewhat pro-eu and most of it is from eu countries , but this is coincidental . 
  because it 's a recognizable symbol that most closely represents the concept of `` europe '' . 
  the flag is used by political intitutions but also has a more inclusive definition . 
  [ socrates would be proud ;\\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socratic_questioning ), 
  not in a noticeable fashion . 
  with the risk of sounding like a broken record : non-political symbols for whole geographical areas do n't really exist , and the european flag has an accepted definition of `` the identity and unity of europe '' which is as close as it comes .

  ( not japanese ) something similar to an embryotic ecc does already exist : [ asean ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/association_of_southeast_asian_nations ) is a supranational organization focused on international diplomatic cooperation and trade . 
  it was born in the 90 's to defend the interests of the southeast asian nations vs the much larger economies of china , japan , and usa . 
  [ acs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/association_of_caribbean_states ) is also basically the same type of organization but for the carribean .
