  this is maybe going to sound parasitic since you 'll be italian only on paper if you choose to do the following : for your self interest it 'll be best to focus more on healthier economies like the german or french market . 
  netherland or benelux are also a viable choice , if not for the higher competitivity and much lower skilled labour deficit . 
  if you choos italy networking will be massively important to find good employement , especially in a stagnating economy . 
  since you are still a student most of those choices are still equal . 
  we say `` aree naturali '' for `` natural sites '' or `` parchi nazionali '' ( national parks ) . 
  the latter is their formal naming under which you will find most information .

  about languages : [ this graph ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/indoeuropeantree.svg ) does a good job at showing the language families of europe and it 's ctrl + f able . 
  as you can see the most different might be sardinian and its derivates . 
  in practice most areas have a lot of cross-unintelligible dialects since there 's no officiality and standardization in regional dialects . 
  to give an idea : [ this ] ( http://static.fanpage.it.s3.amazonaws.com/scienzefanpage/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/dialetti-italiani.png ) is a comprehensive visualization of most of italy 's dialects . 
  u +000 a, 
  it really depends on what you like , as general livability i 'd go with turin too , albeit pollution in the winter gets pretty bad . 
  milan might look grim but it has a more international feel . 
  rome is vibrant all year around and even your toilet will have its history but traffic is the literal worst of italy . 
  sardinian is actually closer to latin than the other italic dialects . 
  other than geography its ancient culture and language is separate from the rest of italy . 
  being an island in a somewhat unimportant area allowed the archaic culture and language to resist assimilation . 
  in fact sardinia still has thousands of [ nuraghe tuff towers ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/nuraghi_losa.jpg ) , from a civilization that existed from ~ 1800bc up to ~ 100 ac . 
  as it was tipical for the roman empire its fringe controlled areas were given a lot of authonomy . 
  major error on my side , thanks for the correction . 
  sardinia is indeed one of five `` special statute region '' . 
  provinces are one step below regions in the italian territorial hierarchy . 
  to add to the confusion one region , trentino alto adige , is peculiar in the fact that its two provinces , trento and bolzano , have near total indipendence from the state * and * region . 
  this probably caused you to mix provinces and regions . 
  without getting too much into details it suffices to say that a special statute region has more authonomy in law enactment and keep a bigger cut of tax revenue . 
  nationwide voting is direct and does not get `` bundled '' like it does in the us , so a vote from say , cagliari , counts as much as one in rome . 
  duoligo has italian , and there is the / r/italianlearning subreddit . 
  rosetta stone is a popular e-learning tool , albeit more expensive . 
  other than that it all boils down to use real life language lessons and , most of all , immersion into the language .

  nice !, 
  to put it bluntly : you 're reading too much into it . 
  the removal reason , off topic , was simply because the video itself talks about generic political systems , and does not enter into detail of european history . 
  political discussion has its own subreddits . 
   nevertheless posting right wing opinions on / r/europe should n't be a bannable offence, 
  it is not , nor is posting off topic contents for that matter . 
   i did n't know there was a rule on the subreddit where videos and articles had to discuss things at a certain level . 
  indeed there is n't . 
  i 'm repeating myself , but the focus of that video was a broad non geo-specific discussion on the two ideologies . 
   but as soon as something to the right of mao gets posted it 's removed . 
  and with this there is no point in continuing the discussion since there is n't a will to continue with a constructive discussion . 
  [ \u00a7 ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/btowg7sganr/ ), 
  the removal reason stated that that was not deemed worthy of an indipendent submission and to contribute with it in the main thread .

  yes and no , the historical savoy area is split between french and italy , with the former keeping the old name . 
  is it still a roadtrip if you take a ferry ? 
  i say yes . 
  look into sardinia and its nuraghes if you want a unique experience . 
   the title is sort of misleading , depending on how you define `` terrorist '' . 
  the global terrorism database seems to include incidents like attempted manslaughter by left-wing rioters and individual killing sprees without any clear goals or connections to any organizations . 
  it 's still very interesting , though, 
   i checked the website ... apparently , one criminal intimidating another criminal by blowing up his car , as a part of a turf war , is terrorism . 
  that 's why we have dots in montenegro .
