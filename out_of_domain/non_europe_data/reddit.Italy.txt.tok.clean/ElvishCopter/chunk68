  in italy too , fascists were actually the ones that recognized the indipendence of the vatican . 
  the catholic church is also the only religion explicitly mentioned in the constitution .

  https://twitter.com/star_sdusts/status/873202703706374144 is the original tweet from the photographer 's page , the tistory links are original sources . 
  as it says in the page info starsdusts.tistory.com is its website . 
  but usually most idol photographers post previews and hq stuff on twitter from hours to months before . 
  1 ) there are a few clusters of religious minorities , most notably jews ( rome ) and a sizeable sikh presence in the northeast . 
  pre-crisis muslims also have a high presence in rome and the central po valley . 
  1b ) italians are overwhelmingly catholics , but protestants are a historical minority and eastern european migration brought a sizeable orthodox presence . 
  1c ) italy is not populous enough to have big cultural differences . 
  if i had to name a few i 'd say football , which is * the * sport , and the annual sanremo music festival , which consistently gets nearly 50 % of tv shares . 
  2 ) english is a mandatory subject up and including secondary education , but you can pass it with good grades while barely being able to form a sentence . 
  most proficient speakers are self taught or took private courses . 
  cities will naturally have a higher percentage of english speakers , but you still should n't expect proficiency in hospitality or from public workers . 
  3 ) hugely depends , but the black sheeps are rome and milan . 
  at least we 're not currently in a national housing bubble . 
  4 ) they 're probably the least discriminated non-cristian religion , albeit there is a notable presence of neofascists in the northeast and especially rome . 
  5 ) noting even comparable to the indian-pakistani situation . 
  it 's mostly just resentment towards germany which is seen as abusing the common market and currency . 
  disoriented military transports , `` invade '' san marino every now and then , but that never caused anything more than a formal complaint . 
   2 ) is the independence movement in veneto for real or just a non issue ? 
  and if veneto secedes , would nationalism start playing out in other regions or will italy still be together ? 
  there is an insignificant core of secessionists , and a more popular independentist movement in veneto and lombardy . 
  there is actually going to be a consultive referendum this autumn . 
  a win for independentism is nearly certain , this will boil down to negotiations with central government about tax retention for each of the two regions . 
   5 ) what do you think of this, 
  i 'll eat anything that does n't immediately kill me . 
  more generally : if he marketed as `` pizza '' he 'll have less success than if he made either a big square and cut it into single portions ( focaccia ) or tiny 6-8 cm mini pizzas ( pizzette ) . 
  the most common pizza style in italy calls for a thinner dough . 
  cauliflower and other sweet vegetables are not highly popular pizza toppings , but less unheard of for focaccias . 
  germany and the northern countries are the most popular eu destinations for extra-eu people for a reason , healthy economies and stronger welfare than the south . 
  there is a sizeable indian minority here in italy , but unless you have/get some connections i 'd look more into uk/germany/the netherlands . 
  we have , and are forecast to , be on a sluggish economical growth and youth unemployment for mediterranean countries is 2-3 times higher than continentals . 
  be a bit more honest , the photo with the lamb is from a planned gig a few months before he endorsed a newly formed animalist party . 
   what is the opinion regarding climate change in your country ? 
  climate change is not a popular talking point , and the solutions to polluted cities is just measures to curb traffic temporarily . 
  on a brighter note : due to being one of the world 's highest importers of fossil fuels , prices are quite high and there is a significant growing interest in investing into renewable energy . 
  there are also tax breaks for building/renewing eco-friendly housing .

  italian and overall mediterranean politics has little in common with the anglo-saxon system . 
  current politics and judiciary is an evolution of the latin school . 
  as of now we have a tripolar system : center left , center right and right wing populists . 
  the main government party ( partito democratico ) is centrist leaning on the left . 
  recently the most left leaning part of pd split out in a couple of parties polling 2-3 % each . 
  pd polls at ~ 27 % now . 
  a minor government party is centrist catholic . 
  overall the government is moderately pro business , pro welfare and includes the left leaning part of catholics . 
  the right is more divided , 2 main parties . 
  pro business forza italia , ( berlusconi is their leader ) and far right lega nord with excellent pr which sells them as a less extreme right . 
  ln has been historically strong in the north and inexistent in the south .
