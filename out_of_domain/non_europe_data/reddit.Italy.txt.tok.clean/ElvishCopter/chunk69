  those two poll at around ~ 13 % each . 
  a third party polling at around 4.5 % is fratelli d'italia nationalists . 
  the populist movimento 5 stelle ( 5 star movement ) , polling ~ 29 % , is a newer party founded by comedian grillo with political expertise backing from casaleggio llc . 
  their main selling point is promises of strong welfare and anti-system rhetoric . 
  italy being a eu member further complicates the situation , but it 's sufficient to that lega nord , m5s and fratelli d'italia are anti-eu and all others are pro-eu . 
  ( i 'll be skipping a lot of details which are not essential to get an idea ), 
  we have a historically unstable national politics , so i 'll just describe what happened in the last few months . 
  the main selling point of the government party was a major referendum on a constitutional reform about creating a single house parliament and a more centralized political system . 
  the referendum failed by 20 % . 
  this caused essentially a government shuffle . 
  the main objective of this last government is to create a workable electoral law , which after a few months of debate resulted in a hole in the water . 
  we 're having a major local election round this current sunday , so the situation is pretty much evolving . 
  this current government is also under fire for cancelling a referendum on abolishing a contract for low paying job but recreating it immediately after . 
  the main general political talking points are : unemployment , high youth unemployment , immigration crisis and relations with the eu . 
  2 : the diaspora ended in the early 1900s , the only remnant of this is a high level of trade with countries with high italian ancestry ( mainly argentina and the usa ) . 
  3 : the average italian does not use english online platforms , but overwhelmingly stays in the facebook-whatsapp-youtube sphere . 
  this is further emphasized by one of the lowest levels of english proficiency in europe . 
  i can guarantee that football is the sport in italy , both professionally and amatorially . 
  4 : we got a refurbished version of him , the perfectly reasonable and moderate [ grillo ] ( http://www.sardegnalive.net/userfiles/image/news/3551_grillo.jpg ), 
  ma far girare la foto e basta no ?

  fyi : there are limits for personal defense pepper spray :, 
  - containing a payload not exceeding 20 ml. , with a percentage of oleoresin capsicum not exceeding 10 % and a maximum concentration of capsaicin and capsaicinoid substances not exceeding 2,5 % ;, 
  - containing no flammable , corrosive , toxic or carcinogenic substances , and no other aggressive chemical compound than oc itself ;, 
  - being sealed when sold and featuring a safety device against accidental discharge ;, 
  - featuring a range not exceeding 3 metres . 
  i would also give a thought on buying some after arriving in italy . 
  an armory will surely have them , but it could be found sporadically everywhere else , from gas stations to herbalists .
