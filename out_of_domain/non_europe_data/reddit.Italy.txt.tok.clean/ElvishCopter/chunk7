  well , at least now you have more space for your ^ ( *** massive cock *** ), 
  me too , took about 8 years to finally build up courage but now i just treat it like tatoos : do n't show them in a professional enviroment but in day to day life i do n't really think about hiding them and people do n't ask about the scars , so all is good . 
  the frigid girl and her inexperienced lover . 
  i was looking for a good image hosting website and found imgur , got really into it , then by chanche clicked on ( source ) and here i am religiously every day . 
  i was waiting for this one . 
  this is going to be quite nerdy and petty , however :, 
  i got really into a web mmorpg , the ones that you have to pay if you 're no playing it casually . 
  these games work by merging the top alliances until just 2 or 3 fight for a final goal . 
  joined an alliance which had a shitty detached leadership and helped bring some cooperation working . 
  me and some other players spent hours on skype working with a new leadership that formed , i got to know them and found that most of them were pretty chill people . 
  but after some new people got with us they started to dictate their will while still being a minority . 
  well , i could n't stand this and since i was in the position to stall the end game forever and i did . 
  mind that a lot of people ( 300-400 in total ) got toghether on this and some dozens of them spen quite a lot of money on it . 
  looking back at it i see this was quite petty , but at least i 'm not on those kind of money and time draining games anymore , which is nice . 
  ** tl ; dr ** did n't agree with people , made them and me waste hundreds of $ and $ and hundreds of hours . 
  pumpkins in any form , love their smell but i tried once and almost trew up . 
  machines with weights at a gym , i stumbled on a video of a lady misusing them which ended on snapping both her legs and now i ca n't make myself use those instruments . 
  mcdonalds fries and their birthday cakes . 
  bland alone bud i love to scoop the icing with fries .

  since you 're going in tourist cities your hotel will most likely have wi-fi , but it could be be an extra . 
  usually if an hotel/bar has wifi it 's advertised . 
  i have n't seen anything faster then 12-15 megabit in both public and hotel wi-fi , if you 're very lucky some classy bars will have a better speed . 
  netflix has regional locks , so you 're going to be able to see only shows licensed in italy if you have n't a vpn .

   you 're not using your internet as much as [ x ] customers withe the same connection speed, 
  is quite broad , maybe the user stream hd movies few times a month , but on average it may look he does n't surf as much . 
  it 's nice that the business is open about their plans but i would have liked maybe an attachment with some general data like peak usage and so . 
  you 're safe using it if you do general web surfing , if you need to log into something you 're just trusting the good will of the person sharing their connection . 
  wiman is an app for sharing your wifi connection with other people near you , it aims to improve wifi connectivity in areas with scarse coverage by sharing the user 's connection .
