  an answer for the short term : no , we usually always approve quality content from blacklisted sources in a short time , especially if it 's the root source . 
  it would be ideal if we keep the situation unchanged . 
  ie , wait for human review . 
  we try to shy away from whitelisting content from forbidden sources .

  hello / r/networking , as per title i 'd appreciate an expert opinion on bgp hijacking . 
  my question is related to [ this ] ( http://blog.bofh.it/id_456 ) blog post documenting a case of bgp hijacking discovered in the hacking team leak earlier this month . 
  the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ip_hijacking ) seems to explain sufficiently enough what bgp hijacking is , so my question is :, 
  how to understand if alice ( victim ) is hit by bob ( bad guy ) : does comparing a remote traceroute to addressspoofed with a local one done from alice and seeing if the end ips differs prove the attack ? 
  if correct , are there any ways to disclose it ? 
  thanks for your time .
