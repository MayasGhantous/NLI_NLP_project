  after a comment has not been answered for 6 months or more no one can add a new comment .

  just tried firefox 42a1 nightly . 
  it does indeed block installing unsigned extensions ( [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pfmcloj.jpg ) i tried installing a dev version of noscript , unsigned ) . 
  looking in about : config ~ ~ for anything to bypass this was indeed unsuccessful . ~ ~ it 's xpinstall.signatures.required , but this field exist for dev and nightly only . 
  the error message links to [ this faq ] ( https://support.mozilla.org/en-us/kb/add-on-signing-in-firefox?as=u&amp;utm_source=inproduct ) , which states :, 
   ** where would i encounter unsigned add-ons ? 
   add-ons installed through the official firefox add-ons site undergo a rigorous review process before they are published . 
  these add-ons are signed and verified . 
   when you install an add-on through another website , firefox checks to make sure that the add-on has been digitally signed before you can install it . 
  they do n't even answer their own faq ... 
  using what 's essentially an alpha version for an unsigned extension seems ... strange . 
  what if anyone needs a private extension that can not be submitted to mozilla for signing ? 
  for a production environment their dev edition is not stable enough . 
  * all aboard the crap-o-magique . 
  supply and demand , that 's how the market works . 
  if people crave an object the seller can crank up the price . 
   a little haiku for you, 
   ^ put ^ seven ^ syllables ^ here, 
   this is n't that , you twat . 
  better then nothing i guess , still a chaotic way of developing . 
  the quoted answer does n't say * where * one may find the unsigned extensions ... 
  it answers * what * and * when * . 
   screencheat is fast and furious with a wide variety of one-hit kill weapons, 
  \u00bf que ? 
  i 've missed pale moon , silly of me . 
  neat , but some of those connections look fragile :(, 
  tbh the retina display is an high quality screen so it justifies the price .
