  io odio quelli che `` io non guardo netflix perch\u00e9 \u00e9 di moda e perch\u00e9 old school is cool '' ... non so se \u00e9 per ignoranza o per via dei pregiudizi . 
  punto . 
  it is not a circlejerk . 
  when i was really into black desert online i used to play almost 18h a day .

  mount & blade warband and rocket league .

  total war : warhammer,

   when old phones stop working when a new one comes out,

  for example , if i use x app everyday and once the new phone comes out x app does n't run on my phone ( that can still make calls and send messages ) , well , for me it does n't work anymore . 
  i think we should talk about it now .
