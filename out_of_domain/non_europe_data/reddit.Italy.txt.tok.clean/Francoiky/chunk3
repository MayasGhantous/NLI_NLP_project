  he is clearly trying to cut down the tree with his car . 
  you should make a post about this idea here on reddit . 
  terrorists :o, 
  i 've had no more noise problems since i replaced the stock cpu heatsink . 
  case fans have never been annoying . 
  the little fan of the cpu heatsink was exactly my problem . 
  now try using this for a zone placing info mod . 
  i think `` crazy bitch '' was too much for a joke . 
  in 2016 you wo n't need windows for games anymore . 
  oh , cmon , where 's the xof patch ? 
  what game is it ? 
  snake eater ? 
  i mean strange artifacts , not the compression ones . 
  i 've done some little overclock in the past but now all the value are at default ( sapphire hd 7750 - 800 core clock/1125 memory clock ) . 
  unfortunately on all video i have and on online ones ( streaming ) . 
  the problem is still there even using different video players : wmp , vlc and flash jwplayer ( via browser ) . 
  i have problems even with youtube ( html5 ) . 
  i 'll try to reinstall the drivers without quick stream . 
  they are kinda different . 
  pandora lets you discover `` random '' songs you may like ; spotify is a huge online music library ( yeah , i know , spotify has the `` suggestion '' feature too , but it 's not its main goal ) . 
  the dog , if it has a pedigree , can be around 1.5 k $, 
  they already announced it will be full of dlcs containing just three maps each . 
  i would say `` do n't buy it at all '' . 
  they already announced it will be the same shit as bf4 , full of ( poor ) dlcs , season pass and premium shits . 
  `` riders on the storm '' snoop dogg remix < -  need for speed underground 2 . 
  well , it 's not an almbum but who wouldnt associate them . 
  hd7770 is supposed to be better than that , am i wrong ? 
  may your cpu be bottlenecking your system ? 
  wrong subreddit mate , this should go on / r/wtf . 
  it wo n't be good just because `` it 's the first big star wars game to come out in a long time '' . 
  price will have a key role too . 
  do we really need a megathread for this ? 
  just do not buy any mod and we are fine . 
  21 - pvz garden warfare or dragon age 2, 
  and my bow !, 
   reversed their policies accordingly, 
  they did n't do that . 
  they just said there wo n't be paid mods for skrim , other games will still have it . 
  i will get downvoted , but i do n't care . 
  i was thinking the exact same thing : how can this video be `` glorious '' when is not at 60fps and has a pre-order bonus ad in it ? 
  dlcs are bad . 
  expansions used to be good . 
   * a wall, 
  i see what you did there . 
  gimp is amazing . 
  go for it !, 
  optimized just for nvidia cards , but yeah , impressive work . 
  the problem is kuruma has no cons . 
  almost fast as my entity xf but so armored that makes hardest missions noob-proof . 
  in freemode you can just live in the kuruma and nobody ca n't kill you without sticky bombs or bazooka . 
  i 'm sorry but i see no cons here . 
  semi-ot : you should try to save something more and get a r9 270 . 
  imo it 's worth teh price difference . 
  you can force a better aa via video card control panel ( both with nvidia and amd ) . 
  yeah , prostreet was pretty good . 
  riders on the storm .

  `` for ** culture ** i would go with france , england , spain , and egypt . '', 
  where the heck is italy ? 
  `` italy counts 50 unesco ( united nations educational , scientific and ** cultural ** organization ) world heritage sites within its borders , the most of any country on the world heritage list '' . 
  next gran turismo \u00e7.\u00e7, 
  the force is strong with this one . 
  on nvidia 9/10 - on amd 8/10 ... 
  damn nvidia hairworks . 
  it 's not the same . 
  i 'm in love with the money grindin of the old gts . 
  gt series has a particular kind of career mode that i have n't managed to find in any other pc car game . 
  i did n't know it has been kinda fixed . 
  i may have to try it again then . 
  thanks !, 
  the standard one ( not the weekly one ) . 
  just google humble bundle . 
  you can buy the goty edition , but unfortunately you wo n't get any discount just because you already own the base game . 
  guys , are you ready ?

   `` clean up keyboard controls and shortcuts '',

  i 'm glad that such a bulls ** t game with 1000 + dlc and microtransactions has failed !, 
  are you sure ? 
  i 've heard just about the 2x performance per watt thing ... can you provide a source ? 
  ty , brother . 
  i must have missed that !,

  if you do n't complain while in early access , when will you do it ? 
  when it 's fully realeased and devs give no *** about it ? 
  wrong subreddit bro , you should post this on r/wtf . 
  `` eh , what 's up , doc ? '', 
  remember the world war iii will be the last one . 
  it seems that reproducing 360 \u00b0 videos via duckduckgo integration feature works .
