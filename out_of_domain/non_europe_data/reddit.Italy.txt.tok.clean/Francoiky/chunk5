  update the damn let 's play thread then . 
  still no f * king clue if it 's pc compatible . 
  start menu screenshot or it never happened . 
  source ? 
  edit : ffs https://twitter.com/konamieu/status/636170112937127937, 
  it 's a site that let you compare various key-selling sites . 
  mods , add this to the list !, 
  and people driving on the wrong side of the road . 
  family share on steam is the way . 
  edit : btw with 60 $ you can buy 2 copies of the game on key-selling sites . 
  my favourite is fast2play ( that iirc is under kinguin 's management ) . 
  that 's true but , like most of the games with steam cloud , it should work . 
  why the downvotes ? 
  it 's a legit question ... 
  i 'm not sure about this . 
  i mean if it 's the digital version you will need to download the entire game not just the installation files . 
  they fired him because ... nobody `` really '' knows why . 
  edit : a word . 
  link please . 
  i 've read on a forum ( iirc neogaf ) that [ after mission 2 you get 19 soldiers and two of them are `` the eye '' and `` the finger '' ] ( / spoiler ) . 
  if it 's like ground zeroes you restart from your last checkpoint . 
  you ca n't save manually . 
  imo it should be a completely different thread . 
  i agree . 
  my idea was a thread about early shippings and stores breaking street dates , but it 's kinda late i guess . 
  kinda low resolution , but thanks . 
  can we have an higher resolution version ? 
  money . 
  just toxicity everywhere . 
  aim-assist off , for sure . 
  downloading the game . 
  thank you , i 'll probably do it . 
  fob multiplayer will suck with just 1 of them , though . 
   the idea of having more than one does n't seem that exciting or important . 
  having more than is important for invasions ... fob multiplayer does n't even make sense now we know most of the people will own just one platform . 
  probably even more . 
  in the gamescom 2015 gameplay video you can see that the invader has to cross the entire base to escape . 
  how is it going to work with just one platform ? 
  imo it 's not going to be that funny . 
  is that confirmed ? 
  oh , that 's not my case . 
  here it 's 60 $ for aaa games and 30 $ if get the key for steam . 
  21 tnx, 
  22 tnx, 
  just google `` ground zeroes trials list '' . 
  yeah , kinda misleading title . 
  so ... this could mean that actualy there is a hidden camo index . 
  22 tnx, 
  do try to remember i paid real money for this . 
  they are not doing it for free ... 
  of course but i mean , i 'm not the one who should say `` thanks '' . 
  thanks . 
  did you download it before or after starting the story mode ? 
  where can i check the server status ? 
  now i 'm wondering if the lullaby could be used somehow ... :o, 
  beta update 1.03 available . 
  changelist :, 
  - fixed an issue where the settings in the `` options ''  `` key assignment '' menu would revert to the default values when restarting the game . 
  - fixed various issues that were resulting in a black or white screen on startup , such as when using a resolution below 1280x720 . 
  use the tranq sniping rifle . 
  you can one shot him ( head shot ) if it 's unaware . 
  i used this technique during [ the fight with quiet . 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  [ side-ops ] ( / spoiler ), 
  now get rid of the always online drm and maybe i 'll buy it . 
  everybody seems to just ignore this and i really do n't know why . 
  you should just stop using that site and let it die . 
  is it that hard ? 
  thanks . 
  i took the 4475th one . 
  endless space . 
  is second life still up ? 
  i was about to say this . 
  just make the data easy to mod and you are good to go . 
  wait ... animated ... jpg ? 
  be free . 
  is 150 $ cheap for a resistive touch screen and a cpu that could fit a 80 $ smartphone ? 
  well that 's true but the only difference between an emulator and a 3ds is ( going to be ) the hardware ... and imo the 3ds hardware is not worth it . 
  * get the key, 
  * download the game, 
  * try to find a game for at least 40 mins, 
  * close the game, 
  * uninstall it, 
  * play cs go, 
  * enjoy, 
  this is literary a scam . 
  if only i had the money . 
  who is lying here ? 
  joltik is little bigger than that but nice one . 
  here in italy even the app would n't work , unfortunately . 
  [ best love song - t-pain ] ( https://youtu.be/_wmd3m-bfvo ), 
  one can hope . 
  one can hope, 
  i have n't preordered it and and i 'm not even going to buy it until it gets fixed . 
  i 'm from italy and i usually eat pizza once a week . 
  * edit : final score : 2-0 *, 
  try turning oc mode off . 
  sorry for the downvote but that 's probably not true . 
  just epic . 
  i have the exact same problem on pc .
