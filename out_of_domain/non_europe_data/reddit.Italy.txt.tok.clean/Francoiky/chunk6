  if they want my money they have to develop for pc . 
  no , but the nose bleeding was epic . 
  black ops iii has a lot of problems on pc . 
  you can refund it or wait for treyarch to fix it . 
  thanks for the advice !, 
  til what cyber monday is . 
  really thank you . 
  what about this graphic card instead ? 
  my sister 's rig has a r7 370 and can run tomb raider 1080p@70+fps maxed out , so yes ... pretty good card for the money . 
  try using [ rufus ] ( https://rufus.akeo.ie/ ) to make sure your usb flash drive is bootable . 
  ~ ~ price ? ~ ~, 
  yeah , it seems to be too low to be true . 
  this . 
  wtf is that crow doing ? 
   if developers are going to put out poorly optimized games on release maybe we would all be wise to upgrade to 16gb and do some future proofing . 
  that would n't be wise at all . 
  demanding for better optimization would be wise . 
  in rufus you have to select your win7 iso . 
  once it has done it 's job you should be good to go , just reboot . 
  [ http://www.ncix.com/] ( http://www.ncix.com/ ), 
  r9 380 for sure . 
  it 's the best in this price range . 
  take a look at this :, 
  where are you from ? 
  maybe amazon.co.uk ships to netherlands . 
  give it a try . 
  lol , of course you can . 
  this . 
  a cx750 has blown up my pc frying my mobo , my cpu and the power supply itself . 
  just new motherboards mess things up . 
  ~ ~ try pulling harder . ~ ~, 
  you forgot the court lines . 
  i read the whole sheet expecting to find `` condoms '' written somewhere . 
  tnx . 
  tnx . 
  19th march . 
  tnx . 
  it 's not about graphics per se , it 's about the effort they put into the game development process . 
  banished and civ5 already taken ... 
  i 'm so sad . 
  tnx . 
  mini-itx gaming rig ? 
  you can build one by yourself like any other pc . 
  what 's your budget ? 
  go file explorer  right-click on `` downloads '' ( column on the left )  proprieties  path  change it and use a directory on your hdd instead ( e.g. 
  d : \\ users \\ yournick \\ downloads ) . 
  you can do the same with all other default folders ( images , music , even desktop ) . 
  edit : and if your ssd is really small , then u/youaintgottoliecraig 's advice is really good too . 
  thanks !, 
  i was the weird kid back in school . 
  i 'm actually on my last year of university , so i 'm doing pretty fine . 
  is it not `` solis '' ? 
  so ... since i 'm from europe i need a vpn to buy a key on this site , right ? 
  cx power supplies blow up pcs ... 
  i would buy another one . 
  [ katy perry has a new career . 
  well done . 
  thank you . 
  i 've done some tests and it seems that the site is really slow only with my home connection . 
  i 've successfully logged in with my phone connection and all ran just fine . 
  i 'm trying to download the diablo iii setup on the pc and it is still at 47kb after about 30mins . 
  thank you for the reply !, 
  since i 'm having problems with the website , should i tracerout and pathping eu.battle.net too ? 
  i 've just bought diablo iii ( i 've managed to redeem it with my smartphone 's 4g connection ) . 
  i was trying to download the setup on the pc but i ca n't even load the homepage . 
  i 've tried waterfox ( firefox 64bit fork ) , internet explorer and dolphin browser on the smartphone ( using wifi ) . 
  : i 'm doing the tracroute and pathping thing in the meanwhile . 
  is this enough ? 
  [ what about this one ? 
  ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/p/z92rcf ), 
  oh , wow , what a great deal ... and why the hell 16 $ = 16 $ ? 
  you know what ? 
  fuck rocket league , i do n't want to play it anymore . 
  tnx . 
  tnx . 
  thank you op !, 
  now let 's have some fun with all those legendary bugs !, 
  budget ? 
  psu ? 
  if you do n't know what power supply you have just post a photo of the label . 
  tnx . 
  i think it 's a photoshop . 
  tnx . 
  you wo n't be able to overclock that much . 
  imo you should have opted for a watercooling solution , something like a [ corsair h60 ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/corsair-cpu-cooler-h60cw9060007ww ) maybe . 
  i 've played it with an amd hd7750 , so i think you will be fine with that graphic card even if you are playing in 1080 . 
  graphic card ? 
  amd or nvidia ? 
  you know , g-sync and freesync ... 
  imo [ 3x asus mx239h ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/p/cbhp3c ), 
  go for [ `` the next-gen exterminator '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/builds#wiki_the_next-gen_exterminator ) that is the wiki . 
  just change the ram , pick a 2x4gb kit instead . 
  and this particular monitor is frameless , so should be perfect for a triple monitor setup . 
  yep , check the connectors op !, 
  here in italy we say that 's `` the exception that proves the rule '' . 
  [ phaedrus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phaedrus_%28fabulist%29 ) ( first century b.c. 
  imo [ corsair hydro h60 ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/part/corsair-cpu-cooler-h60cw9060007ww ) would be better . 
  well , that 's true , they are not the most reliable heatsinks , i was just trying to stay keep the same price . 
  that said i you got the idea : i 'm not sure that cpu cooler is enough for gaming . 
  maybe i 'm wrong , correct me in case .
