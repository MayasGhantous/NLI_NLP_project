  since the release of the value pack the game feels so empty . 
  it is not . 
  i 've had 2 cx psus . 
  one destroyed my mobo + cpu , the other one just caught fire . 
  i have a decent pc , but damn , my poor brother ca n't even play overwatch on his old overheating gtx 650 . 
  anyway , thanks for the giveaway . 
  why are we not playing age of conan ? 
  any real cons ? 
  do n't forget the monthly premium ... 
  do we really need to get that high ? 
  is the gba remake better than the original one ? 
  dragon 's poop . 
   put a oculus on top of it and you look like some sort of shit-storm trooper . 
  ftfy, 
  money . 
  that 's not mozzarella . 
  those 3 frames are more important than the other 280 ones . 
  try playing on a pc and you 'll never go back to consoles . 
  freedom always wins . 
  man i ca n't even touch the ball sometimes !, 
  i need help ... 
  i suck at this game even though i really like it . 
  it 's the same for me . 
  ~ ~ bheg 's not worth breaking grunil set ? 
  you do n't know what you are talking about . ~ ~, 
  edit : my bad , i did n't read properly . 
  2 things :, 
  - use an open mri system [ example ] ( http://www.amerimedimaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/closed-vs-open-compare.jpg ), 
  - apply a mirror on the head coil or at the top of the mri system [ example 1 ] ( https://www.healthcare.siemens.com/siemens_hwem-hwem_ssxa_websites-context-root/wcm/idc/groups/public/@global/@imaging/@mri/documents/image/mdaw/mtu4/~edisp/02_8_ch_head_coil_mood-00035389/~renditions/02_8_ch_head_coil_mood-00035389~8.jpg ) [ example 2 ] ( http://www.toshiba-medical.eu/eu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/02/toshiba-in-bore-mri-head-up-display-1024x576.jpg ), 
  wrong anime man . 
  hitler drug addict ? 
  source ? 
  penguin and the penguin of the event that active right now . 
  omg lancia delta and lancia stratos !, 
  obs with local recording . 
  sorry , i have n't played gta for a while . 
  4096x4096 is the max resolution for h. 264 . 
  this must be a bug , you should try to report it . 
  does anyone know when this is going to end ? 
  now i know what to buy next halloween . 
  thanks . 
  thanks for the info . 
  making gif ? 
  please tell me you have a making gif of the process .

  *** = james bond favourite numbers . 
  framerate does matter to me , for example i 'm still not sure about buying south park sott this halloween because of the 30fps cap . 
  thanks . 
  my tv has frames interpolation always on . 
  i 'm not kidding . 
  i do n't see why i should be forced to play at 30fps anyway , even if the the cartoon the game is from is at 25/30fps . 
  do you know what i mean ? 
  it 's about the freedom to choose , not about if 30fps are good for that game . 
  nope , there is a fix online that lets you unlock the framerate but makes the game crash in specific points of the game . 
  it 's not prerendered at 30fps . 
  why should it not matter ? 
  because the cartoon the game is from is at 25/30 fps ? 
  i do n't see the point . 
  do not confuse interlaced with interpolated . 
  interlaced frames is the old analog tv technology , interpolation is what makes them claim the tv nowadays are at 120/400/over 9000 hz . 
  posts should n't be downvoted just because you disagree with opinion expressed . 
  never heard booing in tennis , golf or chess for example . 
  sport is not about booing or denigrating , it 's about cheering and supporting your favourite team/player . 
  you and the crowd are just rude and ignorant . 
  i 'm ready to be downvoted to hell but this had to be said . 
  what 's wrong with you guys ? 
  booing is rude even in major sports ... 
  never heard of sportsmanship , do n't you ? 
  yep , same problem here . 
  ~ ~ this is where i 'd put my gold ... if i had one . 
  i would gold this great work if i had the money . 
  edit : edited because apparently reddit did n't like my phrasing . 
  the correct form is `` succhiami il cazzo '' ( = `` suck my cock '' fyi ), 
  the oculus rift is already dead ... htc vive is the vr headset for pc and speaking about quality ps vr is so far behind the vive you ca n't even compare those two . 
  sure it is going to be expansive but vr is not for the masses yet . 
  amazon is the way ... even if i 'm not used to pre-order , i 've been told amazon handles pre-orders quite nicely . 
  you are not upvoting hard enough !, 
  i hope you deliver op !, 
  i do n't think you can now . 
  to keep the the prisoners you use as organ farms under control just do like this :, 
  let them fully recover from the battle . 
  install a peg leg . 
  repeat point 2 until the surgery succeeds . 
  remove the peg leg . 
  the prisoner wo n't be able to eat on his own anymore but he wo n't cause any problem even if his mood goes -9000 due to `` organ harvested x n '' . 
  note that you will need a lot of meds but your doc will become god-like . 
  regarding mechanitis , you can leave them untreated as they are not deadly and cause just some pain . 
  edit : typo . 
  horses and rideable animals .
