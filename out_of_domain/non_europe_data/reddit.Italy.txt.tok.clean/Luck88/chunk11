   the us, 
  the us is seen as one of the best countries to go live-in for younger people for how easy it is to find a job there , some are concerned about trump but the effects of his direction will show up only in a few years . 
  we also despise the part of your population that eats pineapple pizza . 
   other cuisines italians like, 
  it depends on the person and their taste , generally we have some of the biggest fastfood chains from the us but people try not to eat there often as it 's unhealthy , other than that sushi and kebab are really popular . 
  ho rivisto ora il video di fuori dal tunnel e ho percepito dei vibes da willy il principe di bel air non indifferenti, 
  it 's funny because lucca is just the name of the city , while luca is a verry common italian name, 
  first world problems intensifies, 
  well , it 's a console that has been on the market for less than 5 months , most if not all third party went for the wait and see aproach since they felt burnt from the low wii u sales , it 's to be expected , now that it 's proven to be far more successful than its predecessor i 'm shure we 'll see many more games coming to the system , the switch ( no pun intended ) will likely happen in the last few months of the year/early 2018 since porting/making games takes time, 
  wtf i thought this was edited to make it look funny but i just fact-checked it : it 's real !, 
  this game keeps giving , 10/10, 
  l'ho appena constatato , che mucchio di attention whores, 
  noice , get your upvote,

  imho \u00e8 uno studio fake / s, 
  non so se applaudire o fare un facepalm, 
  i have a suggestion for something not to watch/read : `` commissario montalbano '' is probably the most popular crime series in italy , but you should avoid it while studying because the characters tend to speek in dialect so it would get you confused, 
  da 9 km di distanza,

  make shure to avoid ferragosto ( the week of the 15th of august ) most of the citizens go on holiday in that week and you 'd almost certainly find traffic in the streets and massive crowds in any turistic location, 
  edit : ferragosto is on a tuesday this year , so avoid the saturday the 12th and sunday the13th aswell !, 
  i do n't know why but i entered expecting an aoyama drawn as a serious saitama, 
   its worth watching indeed . 
  ftfy, 
  that momo shot !, 
  console portatile is the way !,

  whyyyyy ? 
  if i think of how far behind the anime is a filler episode is the last thing we need , i want to see all might vs a certain character in the anime : c, 
  yeah but it 's still one more week to wait until the anime catches up with that point of the manga, 
  b-but what happened to this subreddit ? 
  the traitor theories were the ones that kept it alive : c, 
  maybe sensei felt confident about his ability to defeat all might/everyone else after seriously injuring all might and knowing he was losing power and at the same time wanted to test shigaraki, 
  could n't the rules be changed so that good traitor theories with work put into them can be posted ? 
  i knew it !, 
  pudding is in love with sanji !, 
  pudding 4 strawhat !, 
  she hates her family though !, 
  they keep telling her she 's a monster !, 
  nah , she 's one of the good guys now , it does n't make sense for her to trick chiffon , she will agree cautiosly so she 'll be ready in case pudding wants to backstab her ... 
  oda already made too many traps with pudding , it 'd be too repetitive , plus we need another girl in the crew other than ( possibly ) carrot !, 
  it looks like the most basic wallet ever excluding the florence symbol , what 's so special about it that drives you to look for one from the same company ? 
  are doflamingo 's pants a reference to the fact that he was imprisoned or what ? 
  i hear my homeland 's call, 
  i hear my history 's call, 
  i ca n't let my city die, 
  the barbaric wave that 's invading us, 
  will never remove our flag, 
  from the utmost boundary of civilization, 
  war to the enemies of my homeland, 
  in battle we may die, 
  but our ideals wo n't, 
  i 'll live forever next to the heroes, 
  ( boys ) be brave , strong and honorable, 
  let 's throw our hearts in the sky ( literally `` let 's throw our hearts high '' ), 
  because the future is ours ( literally `` tomorrow '' ), 
  war to the enemies of my homeland, 
  boy who listens to this message, 
  born with the sun and flowers of may, 
  elevating from the sky and make so it never dawns, 
  sunrise illuminates our path, 
  tradition is our destiny, 
  wether it lies in a dream or in an ideal :, 
  the homeland !, 
  war to the enemies of my homeland, 
  i did my best for 11 pm , some of the messages are kida weird to explain via transaltion but i hope it 's understandable, 
  i love to think that crocoboy was initially pissed , then he realized that luffy is stronger than him so he decided to make him look even more similar to him in order to say something like `` yeah , he 's strong and all but he copied my style '', 
  genuine eyes boys !, 
  pudding for strawhat is likely now !, 
  soooooo : what if zeus was made out of cotton candy ? 
  would chopper get a stroke seeing him ? 
  she 's genuine , which makes me happy because i want her to join the crew, 
  i can only immagine how many chopper jokes would come out of that, 
  more like totland 's citizens vs saving her life , mama hates her face, 
  where were you when the strawhats survived the seducing woods solely thanks to the vivre card ? 
  yup , pudding for strawhat !, 
  the sunny is an expensive and solid ship , they can re-use it/sell it if they defeat the strawhats, 
  oh , i just realized , zeus , the god , cheated on his wife multiple times , in the same way zeus , the homie , betrayed big mom , nice one oda , gg, 
  just like the deku tree !, 
  but , the thing is , pudding hates her family , we 've seen her flashback where everyone told her that she was uggly and she started becoming evil because nobody was nice to her ... 
  i think it 's just perspective,
