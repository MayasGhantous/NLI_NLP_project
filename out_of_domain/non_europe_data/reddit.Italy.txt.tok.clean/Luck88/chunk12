  man , call back when you play 70 hours in 10 days , then you 'll know how much it can suck you in, 
  i have a feeling you burnt it underneath , you probably made some mistakes with the dough , also far too much cheese , if you want to have five it 's ok but use less , otherwise it 'll slip off the dough , of course unless the dough is rigid which you do n't want it to be,

  1 - yes , following the main earthquake in august 2016 there were thousands of smaller earthquakes , while most of them did n't cause further destruction some did , for instance in january 2017 another earthquake related to those from august caused a hotel to be crushed by an avalanche trapping more than 30 people inside of it . 
  2/3-i do n't know specifics about unesco sites but when the earthquakes struck the news focused on a couple of very important churches that were severely damaged , so those might be part of it . 
  4-again , i do n't know specifics about how the reconstruction is being handled but i 'm positive most if not all the debris ca n't be used , especially since now that the zone is active the houses should be built earthquake-proof . 
  5-following the earthquake most of them were either moved in other cities or placed in temporary houses made for the occurrence , those who could kept working although they had various struggles : many farmers ' animals were killed/badly injured since they were left alone for days while the rescuers were trying to save the citizens , activities in the destroyed towns could n't go on due to to the damaged workplaces .

  barto was an idiot to burn the shanks flag , now shanks might be mad at luffy for something he did n't even do ... 
  now the question is : is bm still a flying type even without zeus or is she a water type ? 
  katakuri : why ca n't i see his next attack with my haki ?!? 
  brook : you ca n't see what has already happened yohohohoho, 
  if chopper went monster point and lost his mind due to how much candy perospero created it 'd be so funny having perospero being chased by two giant monsters on a rampage, 
  he 'd need to be beaten up big time for the poneglyphs to be damaged and given how close the rest of the crew is i do n't see that happening ... 
  i just realized : pudding 's flying carpet is a homie . 
  and it flew from side to side of wci in no time . 
  why the fuck does n't big mom make/take another homie like zeus ? 
  oda probably wants to save her techniques for the time when the full strawhat crew faces bigmom, 
  i suggest reading the mangastream translation , going by those she just seems happy to see sanji again , she also seems to be crying again although it might just be a lighting effect, 
  i secretly hope it 's yasopp just so bartolomeo tells him the legend of god usopp, 
  read the mangastream traduction , it gives a different viewpoint,

  there 's way too many of them and them being in japanese does n't help at all . 
  i play casually on japan ( barely over level 90 ) but i always take my daily gem , due to that i 've already 6 legends on japan and i 'd like to keep 'em .

  i think haruhi should fear who she stands next to, 
  it was a [ pok\u00e9mon reference ] ( https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/appendix:f.e.a.r . ), 
  pudding started being a little boring in the past few chapters but in this one i liked her a lot , i feel the frustration people felt towards her was caused by only seeing her one time per chapter and her being different in every chapter , as she is right now she 's far more enjoyable . 
  i really want her to join the crew, 
  pudding is starting to have influnce on him even on the split-personality side, 
  yandere is so mad that could kill for love , tsundere only fakes not liking people when they just want to be liked, 
  aka always, 
  think of napoleon , prometheus and zeus as horcrux from harry potter . 
  those are the real parts of bm 's soul ( as well as those black monsters who travel across tottland to recieve the months of life of the citizens ) , those are part of her and those are probably her weakspot,
