  urgono bestemme in questo thread, 
  i 'm not among the people who 'd get angry about it , actually i 'm kinda interested to try to add spinach to the carbonara , everything else does n't fit, 
  no i do n't , but maybe he made some errors or did n't use enough eggs ... 
  they are likely more than 200 , a hotel in the zone of the epicenter was demolished and there were about 70 people inside of it . 
  still , it wo n't affect the 500 $ given to 18 yo, 
  urouge is a beast . 
  he took down one of big mom 's commanders and i 'm positive he 's also the one who gave that scar under the right eye to cracker but probably nobody knows how the battle ended since even brul\u00e9e thinks urouge died in the forest . 
  the house in the seducing woods has a mirror behind it , it probably is the portal for the mirror world . 
  also , given the dragon tatoo of the red hair pirate in the coverpage i 'm positive the red hair pirates are on baltigo . 
  i slept with that woman who i thought was a guy '' *, 
  i 'm positive cracker wo n't get back up , this only shows the improvements made by luffy from dressrosa to whole cake island, 
  of course , a guy who sells hundreds of smiles ( all of which are worth 100m if not a little less ) would be almost at 1b bounty level , and his bounty before he even started the smile market was 300/350m if i 'm not mistaken, 
  except there are more than 30m active users every day, 
  eh , i think it 's there to show the last breath of cracker before loosing completely consciousness . 
  this is the vs the 4 yonko saga , not the `` ok , i 'll have two yonko as my allies and maybe i 'll fight the other two '' saga, 
  nope , brul\u00e9e said nobody made it to even see big mom , while it 's pretty clear that she wants to be there when the wheel of death spins, 
  deku is gona beat best shiketsu girl 's ass !, 
  also the shake power seems nothing special , shure , he can do massive damage , but uraraka defeats the guy easily , plus he might very well use a powerful hit when he does n't have to ending up paralyzed . 
  now the wind guy who did better than todoroki is really interesting , on one side he defeated 120 people with only one move , on the other hand however todoroki now that uses fire would certainly have the upper hand since fire spreads thorugh air , his only chance against todoroki is make a wind current so strong that it sends todoroki 's fire back at him , which of course would need a lot of power given what todoroki has proven to be able of doing . 
  i 'm positive it 's the fact that it can split since they said `` his sword split too '' , that or it was simple manga talk like `` my sword is better than anyone else 's '', 
  you think that 100 people will pass the exam ? 
  yeah , right , it 'll be nice if 20 of them pass it , this is only the first stage . 
  i think inasa 's wind is strong enough to break ice and to throw it back at todoroki, 
  omg so i 'm not the only one who noticed whitebeard and dragon in this chapter, 
  i 'm positive that todoroki 's ice is almost no-use against inasa , even if they did n't have to fight during the exam to enter u.a. 
  i 'm positive that their position in the leaderbord is to prove that one is stronger than the other and , in this case , it means that inasa is stronger than only-ice todoroki , full power todoroki , well that 's all another story , i could see inasa sending back todoroki 's flames with his wind and , in the moment inasa thinks he has won , todoroki freezing his body just to give him the final blow !, 
  of course , but the fact that he has to do with such great ammounts of money means that he means actual business , he wass certainly worth more than 500m, 
  he also has a thing for stuff getting hot , he better not get near todoroki now or he will end up with a boner, 
  eh , he does n't seem like an important character to me , yes , he 'll get in the top 100 , but i do n't see him beeing of any harm for either the u.a. 
  or shiketsu students, 
  well shindou 's quirk is called litteraly the `` shake quirk '' so maybe his ability influences his attitude and he 's forced to shake hands with everyone , but i 'm not positive about that : v, 
  in rule 34 ? 
  because she appeared in chapter 102 , two weeks ago, 
  yup , and damn is he chosing the best gurz ( excluding yaoyorozu because she belongs to todoroki ), 
  also , since we 're talking dragon , do you think the red hair pirates from today 's cover story where in baltigo ? 
  [ perona ] ( http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/perona ) aka best girl of thriller bark, 
  i hope it does n't happen , we really do n't want an harem situation in bnha, 
  i 'm positive it 's shiketsu since even the other guy ( not inasa ) from shiketsu wore one ... 
  do you follow one piece ? 
  if so have you read what happened in fishman island ? 
  i swear to god , if we do n't see kaminari 's lightning sword during this arc ... 
  i 'm positive he created a whirlwind so that the same balls could hit multiple targets ... 
  oh , i forgot to mention , i 'm super disappointed by the saitama with hair , he 's got just a random boomerang quirk ... 
  it 's just impossible to leave the shake inside the opponent for so long , if that 's the case i 'll call bs fore the first time on horikoshi ... 
  imho it 's indeed a tornado effect , where the balls keep moving inside of it , ending up hitting multiple targets , moreover we do n't know how many people were targeted , maybe he managed to take out only the 120 weakest out of say 200 students ... 
  i think satou , sero , kouda and hagakure will fail , everyone else i do n't know , i 'm positive the big 3 ( izuku , bakugou and todoroki ) will all get the license, 
  lmao , context, 
  well nami 's outfit in thriller bark was pretty hot , also no , please , just no . 
  why not ? 
  the guy probably has the powers of monkey d. dragon : v, 
  i can see the second year as either a crisis year or a more `` regular exams '' year , in the first case ( the one i hope to occur ) something big happens to the hero organization , some heroes retire and/or a big even changes the world forever , maybe even making normal people hate on heroes/people with quirks , in the second case we 'd just get some emotional development of the characters ( hopefully todoroki x momo ) and they all train hard for whatever will happen in the third year , who did n't get their license during the current exam will get it and get to do what those who earn the license at the end of this arc will do . 
  plot twist : iida gets everyone expelled :, 
  ** jirou : ** great job getting us expelled mr. class president ... 
  ** iida : ** oh , of course , now it 's my fault if cementoss died because his organs melted . 
  ** jirou : ** well it was you that insisted for him to drink a large glass of water after he turned it down sherlock !, 
  ** iida : ** oh , excuse me if i tried to be kind as always, 
  ** jirou : ** you gave water to a man made out of cement , what did you expect to happen ? 
  note , for plot purposes cement melts with water in the world of bnha, 
  i mean , he has to , that 's how power-ups work : you develop a stronger tecnique to accomplish your goal, 
  immagine graffiti made out of blood , we could make an all new street art !, 
  and for once , they could n't tell us that we are sexist because there are more man than woman doing this job !, 
  that gives a whole another context to the beginning of this song, 
   acne , and hormones, 
  last time i checked those were integral part of puberty for us men aswell, 
  did they ? 
  i 've followed for a while zelda : botw , even before it 's title was announced and i do n't recall hearing about that, 
  with over 100 shrines + unannounced number of actual dungeons + villages it 'll be quite overwhelming, 
  experience an overwhelming number of atrocoiusly generated planets with abortion-worthy creatures and lots and lots of emptiness !, 
  no man , i ca n't play this , please let me watch sky . 
  i mean , if they made a solid-only planets universe i 'm positive they can work out a way to do gas planets without making them real-universe sized ... 
  yup , this is another failed attempt at creating a `` universe game '' so i find it quite usefull to ask why x or y things were n't made to make it better , if anything the developer for `` insertnamedifferentfromspore2 '' will eventually read this thread and feature those kinds of planets in his game ... 
  neither do they for man ( ? ), 
  hormones keep beeing produced , never heard of testosterone ? 
  zits and stuff keep coming for some individuals and bad hygiene can cause them to return aswell ... 
  i mean , who knows , certainly if someon thought of making a game similar to no man 's sky they would certanly want to check what people wanted in said game , maybe even you , inspired by my suggestion might one day make the first good universe-sized game ... 
  is it ? 
  the video is about a man proposing an international man 's day at the backbench business committee while a femminist member of the committee laughs at him without listening to what he 's saying , the guy brings up some quite interesting data, 
  whi said he has to have an alliance ? 
  shanks is a light hearted man , as soon as he learns about a tragedy like the destruction of baltigo he 'd try to help the revolutionaries no matter if he agrees or not with what they do, 
  and parents [ loved ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtzyz2tggls ) it !, 
  you shure ? 
  i mean i 've seen what inasa is capable of but bakugou 's new move that uses explosions almost like bullets must be strong af , i do n't know if he can dodge it even with his wind ... 
  of course , if he fails in the hero career i 'm shure he 's got plenty of job offers as a barman, 
  [ 2:08 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky5ug1ow5o4 ), 
  i do n't know why but i always pictured her as blonde ... 
  soooo , we 've seen only one of the targets on the girl as of now , meaning that her other two targets are on her back ( which is a strategy dumb as fuck but hey , she has to lose against deku so ... ) , would n't it be convenient if one of those was on her ass and it was also the last one to be hit by izuku , making him say jump on her after she fell in the combat and right when deku is about to eliminate her ochako comes in saying `` what the hell are you doing ? '', 
  i 'm positive he did n't , maybe just in the anime during the sabo flashback ( ? ), 
  i 'm shure kaminari went on his own both because of his power doing range damage and because in a city zone he 'd be advantaged instead of a field like that where deku & co. are fighting . 
  were ojiro and hagakure with the rest of the class ? 
  i do n't recall seeing them either ... 
  but we 're lacking blonde students waifus in this manga : c, 
  awwww , i ca n't wait for season 2 of kono subarashi, 
  awwwww, 
  yesssss , best couple !, 
  scientist theorize jupiter to have a solid core , i herd that we might get confirmation on that in the next few years or so ... 
  why ? 
  what does metroid have to do with bakugou ? 
  and why the heels ? 
  if you wanted him to shoot from the heels you should have given him bayonetta 's outfit , not samus ' . 
  well , our ancestor life forms originated in water so there 's that ...
