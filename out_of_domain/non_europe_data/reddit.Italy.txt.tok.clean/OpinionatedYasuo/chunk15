  there was some discussion about it and did n't think much of it , until 1 hour ago i received this message , which is edited to hide spoilers : [ click ] ( https://puu.sh/swbit/bf6f5cdbed.png ), 
  if you find yourself not happy with something about ffxv , be careful about voicing your opinion , and if you do i 'd hold them off until you beat the game . 
  that is all . 
  do n't make the same mistake i did . 
  tl ; dr do not trust that inbox .

  squeenix needs to patch in some way to make money in a more fun and engaging way , aka gameplay . 
  hunts give a pittance compared to the time it takes to complete them and they can be done only once . 
  some materials need their sell value bumped in order to make us play the game and not the worst minigame in the history of final fantasy . 
  are n't you guys tired of being treated like shit just because you like one champion ? 
  there are already countless guides and information on how to deal with yasuo , you think they care ? 
  they do n't care about increasing their chances of winning against yasuos , they just enjoy partaking in a toxic circlejerk that treats yasuo mains like subhumans . 
  your logic and information will not do ** anything at all ** to stop the circlejerk . 
  they do n't care . 
  you should n't do their work for them , not after being insulted for so long . 
  it 's up to riot and the / r/leagueoflegends mods to actually stop this . 
  but it wo n't happen because even their mods happily promote a thread that is only about saying how yasuo mains fucking suck and how useless they are . 
  we do n't have to help them in any way whatsoever .

  all i want to know . 
  why ca n't a fucking pikeman just have a precise equipment that literally never changes ? 
  the same weapon , armor , shield , horse for every single unit of that type . 
  it was on pc . 
  no idea if exclusive . 
  rpg , possibly released in those years . 
  no idea if it 's older . 
  i was born in 1994 and my brother might have bought it much earlier , but i remember playing it when i was little . 
  the game had an isometric view . 
  2d or 3d i do not remember . 
  probably 2d . 
  graphic arts style was similar of baldur 's gate ? 
  probably more dated than baldur 's gate . 
  i dont remember names , i was very little . 
  but a lot of gameplay mechanics and a few missions are still clear in my mind !, 
  you would have a town which was basically your `` hub '' where you could buy and sell items , train your party for levels , buy mercenaries for missions . 
  mind you that in the town you would lose the isometric view and it would become a static image where you would click to go to certain parts of the town , like tavern , trainer or shop . 
  one mission had you defeat a silver/grey turtle . 
  one of the endgame missions had you collect armor parts , one of these armor parts had to be retrieved from a dragon overlooking a lake . 
  lategame mages would have staves that shot a lot of rays at once , like 5 , all of different colors to hit 5 targets . 
  your mages also had usual spells like fire wall , fireball , etc. 
  it 's not icewind dale . 
  it 's not baldur 's gate . 
  it 's not diablo . 
  it 's not heroes of might and magic . 
  the title of the game ** might ** have contained the word mage or wizard in it . 
  my memory could be wrong , however .

  nobody believed in him, 
  like holy fucking shit man . 
  i 'm watching a vod right now and he literally just screams his lungs out every single fight that happens , it 's exhausting to listen to . 
  no need to literally cast every fight like this and oh my god what was that and clg manages to take blue under nv 's nose !, 
  please chill, 
  does this sub have mods ? 
  do they even care about the quality of this sub 's content ? 
  i really hope you can farm high level western gear later on . 
  for now i just soul matched my bastard sword .

  long story short , the new client blows dick . 
  thanks for nothing riot wankers, 
  i reinstalled dark souls 3 recently and i have this annoying bug which resets ambient sound whenever i browse my items . 
  it also resets when i browse the menu in general , or browse through my shortcut items . 
  anyone knows a fix ? 
  tried googling with no results . 
  do n't know what else to do so i ask here . 
  i already tried multiple fixes none of which have worked . 
  controller is plugged off, 
  tried updating dirextx found in the game folder, 
  tried to unplug my hdmi cable when starting, 
  tried to reboot the computer, 
  drivers are up to date, 
  i was able to run this game before , but that 's before i changed to windows 10 . 
  was on w7 before . 
  any ideas ? 
  edit : fixed . 
  it was gedosato , deleted the entire folder and the game now works . 
  i am asking here because i am very quickly running out of ideas about how to fix this problem . 
  around two weeks ago i started having the issues written in the title . 
  i thought they were temporary at first and i assumed the isp was having some problems in the area , so i just let it be . 
  thursday ( 3 days ago ) decided to call them and explain them my issue . 
  they did see that my internet disconnected constantly throughout the day and said they would be sending a technician the next day . 
  technician comes , says the issue is probably linked to the wiring in the house . 
  i 'll try to explain it as best as i can , as english is n't my first language . 
  they said that the problem lies in the multiple `` internet ports '' ( [ example ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nfex5tl.png ) ) that i have in the house . 
  they said it 's not an adapt system with fiber , even though i used it for months without issue beforehand . 
  we tried to locate the box where the wiring started to split around the house but without luck . 
  becaus of this , they tell me to attach the modem/router to the main line directly before it gets split and see if it does n't drop . 
  at first it seemed stable , but then the next day ( saturday ) it starts disconnecting again for the same amount of time . 
  another technician will ( probably ) check in tomorrow . 
  but im starting to get desperate here as nothing seems to be resolving the issue . 
  i have made sure it 's not a pc problem , every device connected to the internet goes down . 
  i have resetted the router completely . 
  i have even disconnected mysky ( which is connected to the router to download movies ) but the problem persisted even then . 
  i do n't know what to do . 
  at this point im just looking for any kind of advice . 
  note that after the issue started happening , my download speeds were n't hit as far as im aware . 
  full speed as before . 
  thanks for anyone who looks into this . 
  basically i notice a constant whistling/buzzing sound that plays in my headphones when i start the game . 
  if i turn the volume down to 0 in the game settings i can notice it clearly . 
  if i browse through the settings in the main menu the sound changes in pitch and intensity ( just scrolling through `` new game '' `` load game '' and `` options '' will do that ),
