why are you so eager to throw your life away ? 
  i am roman and not even i would ever dream of going around the city by bike . 
  if you really want to ride one go to a public park , such as villa borghese or villa pamphili ... 
  also , they were n't exactly armed with spears and bows but were using modern weapons instead , courtesy of the other european powers . 
  and the fact that the invading army was 1 ) almost ten times inferior to their opponent 2 ) split up in four columns , all of which got lost in the night and 3 ) led by an [ austrian idiot ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oreste_baratieri ) who had almost no other references whatsoever did n't help , either ; it would have been like putting adolf hitler in charge of operation barbarossa ( [ oh , wait ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_barbarossa ) ) . 
  think about the battle of the little bighorn , only at night and with ethiopians instead of the various indian tribes . 
  it was a bloodbath indeed . 
  their bodies were recovered from the battlefield and had their uniforms on , i suppose . 
   so far , i have n't found my luck tracking down his uniforms from google . 
  i ca n't find the hat with the white tassel , but it looks like he is wearing the hat of the bersaglieri in the second image . 
  judging by the uniform , your grandfather was clearly a * bersagliere * and the cap in the first image is a fez , which is still used by members of that corps : http://pictures2.todocoleccion.net/tc/2012/02/18/30559070_9514915.jpg, 
   i was hoping this sub could shine some light on to whether the cultural impressions are accurate or not [ ... ], 
  i 'm italian , and i do n't think we 're like that ... 
  i can try to shed some light on it , though :, 
  ** 1 ) ** * licentious *, 
  this is relative , i mean - yeah , we are associated with love and all ( you can thank both casanova and rodolfo valentino for that ) but in reality , italy has one of the most rigid dating scenes/sexual mores in europe . 
  and convincing an italian woman to have some sexy time together can be truly disheartening ... 
  oh and it 's not like we italian men are sex-obsessed , butt-grabbing monsters - only berlusconi and the packs of saddos that like to hang around the tourist hotspots ( we even got a nick-name for this kind of people : * pappagalli * , or `` parrots '' , for they like repeating the same sentences in broken english over and over ) are . 
  ** 2 ) ** * relaxed *, 
  partly true , but it depends on which part of italy we 're talking about : big city people ( milanese , romans ) are n't that relaxed - most of my fellow citizens seem to be in a state of constant hurry . 
  but of course , a person living in a remote village located in the backass of nowhere may not have many reasons to be impatient . 
  ** 3 ) ** * rule-bending *, 
  ancient romans for one certainly were n't the rigorous people as they 're portayed - they had their fair share of scandals ( just read juvenal , or martial ) . 
  the difference is this : almost everything of what we know about them comes from literary works , and most of the authors were n't exactly keen on portraying their people , or the empire , unfavourably not least because one risked his own life in doing so . 
  now compare and contrast with italy . 
  for example , there is n't one single hollywood production in which italians are n't portrayed in a somewhat-negative light ; producers do n't care whether these portrayals are consistent with facts ( most of the time they are n't ) and what is more important , no one blinks an eye . 
  also think about literature ... most of the 19th-century travelogues were rather scathing , to say the least , and imho they contributed quite a lot in forming foreigners ' perceptions of italy . 
  equally dismissing were ( and to a certain extent , still are ) lots of the novels set in italy . 
  the fact that italy is home to some of the most notorious criminal groups does n't help , either , and i dare say that our postwar political establishment is very much responsible for further tarnishing our country 's reputation . 
  and of course , we can be as rule-bending as anyone else - the only difference is that we get called out for it !, 
  ** 4 ) ** * emotional *, 
  again , this is relative . 
  everybody knows of the famed italian short temper , and everybody pretty much agrees that italians are constantly arguing with each other ( which is not entirely untrue , but ... ) . 
  the fact is : we really are n't , and * some * italians just like talking at the top of their lungs . 
  it 's plain just old rudeness . 
  as for the stereotypical short tempers , i can attest that my emilian grandparents ' idea of arguing was staring angrily at each other during lunch : you could hear a fly ... well , * fly * !, 
  but that was pretty much it . 
  personally , i find the belief that we are louder than other people utter tosh . 
  i 'm sorry , but if you ever board a bus in rome the only people talking aloud you 'll find are american , or british , tourists ( and of course the usual pack of rude teenagers - but nowadays they 're a blight pretty much everywhere ) . 
  hope it helped !, 
  yes , and no - basically , greece had to pay hefty reparations and salute our flag during a ceremony in athens . 
  but that was pretty much it and i do n't think they ever sent an official apology ( with fascism , the war and all they certainly had some reasons not to ) . 
  what ? 
  we italians really are exempt from ridicule ? 
  i wish it was true ... and in case you did n't notice , whenever someone brings up * that * topic it soon degenerates into an italy-bashing orgy . 
  as you can very well see here . 
  truth to be told , though , we [ italians ] do n't gesticulate not even nearly as much as you 'd think - indeed , there are many , many people who do n't do it at all ( and i 'm one of them ) . 
  the only thing is , the further south you go the more noticeable it becomes . 
   fate sport ? 
  captain olivetti , from dan brown 's * angels and demons * ... also , carlo ventresca ( whose surname means `` tuna belly '' in italian ) from the same novel . 
  oh , and there 's even a bishop aringarosa ( `` pink herring '' ) . 
  that happened in 1963 , though - not 1968 . 
  i am not an historian , however i 'd like to build on what you said nevertheless ... 
  to begin with , the ** papal states ** had become pretty much irrelevant after the 17th century ; their economy never really took off ( despite the fact that one of the first italian railway systems was built there in 1846 ) but above all , they lacked both an industrial base and a decent economy . 
  in the years between 1860 and 1870 , when a united italy was in the making , they were one of the poorest italian states and their army certainly was no match for piedmont-sardinia , which the then-pope ( pius ix , reigned 1846-78 ) supported during the failed first war of italian indepedence . 
  moreover , the revolutions of 1848 took a heavy toll on the papal states . 
  in the following year , the pontiff was ousted by a popular rebellion ( you know , reforms and all that ? ), 
  and shortly after a triumvirate of liberals composed by giuseppe mazzini , carlo armellini and aurelio saffi took control of rome . 
  the second roman republic was thus proclaimed - only to be crushed two months later by the now-angry pope with the help of the french emperor ( napoleon iii , who coincidentally happened to be a friend of piedmont-sardinia ) . 
  perhaps unsurprisingly , pius ix refused to back any further attempt to form a united italian state ... and he was right , because in 1860 piedmont itself turned against the papal states , beat its army at the battle of castelfidardo and took control of most of central italy - thus leaving only latium under papal control ( and french protection ) . 
  ** tl ; dr ** the papal states were too weak ( both economically and militarily ) to attempt a take-over of the peninsula . 
  moreover , after 1849 the pope had no intention to do so and napoleon iii - who was at the same time backing the piedmontese ( who were already working on the italian unification ) and protecting the papal states - would n't have allowed it . 
  so here you go . 
  now , let 's get back to the op 's question . 
  despite it size , the ** kingdom of the two-sicilies ** was too poor and , in some respects , * very * backward in the 19th century to accomplish such a feat . 
  militarily speaking , it did n't take too much effort to topple the kingdom in 1861 - and many of its inhabitants ( especially the sicilians themselves ! ), 
  often revolted against their rulers . 
  in short , the two sicilies were too vulnerable to accomplish such a feat ... they were a giant with the proverbial `` feet of clay '' . 
  well ... 
  i 'm italian and i 've never heard of such a thing ; afaik , `` casata '' is just another word for `` dynasty '' or `` house '' . 
  i think you were just referring to nicknames ? 
  thanks for the suggestion , but i 've already tried that ( the 1836 starting point is definitely easier , however , it does n't feel as challenging ) . 
  also , when i build factories things seem to go well at first ... after a while , they wo n't receive any more raw materials and the economy starts going down the toilet - i 've tried disabling the commerce ai for those materials and setting a minimum stockpile but to no avail . 
  is it a bug or something ? 
  i do that a lot - at least every 3 months or so , because the relations stat begins to decay ( for lack of a better word , english is not my first language ! ), 
  * very * quickly . 
  but even when the relationship is at +200 italy will attack me . 
  thanks , i did n't know that !, 
  however , is n't such a thing a bit odd given the fact that i always end up in italy 's sphere of influence ? 
  imho they should have got some iron and it 's not like i got embargoed or something . 
  as far as i could tell from the website ( and , of course , the movement 's name ) this is an italian group ; i honestly do n't know why it has become a croatian thing too . 
  anyway , judging from that source they seem to be more conservative than anti-gay ... you know , a `` we defend the traditional family '' kind of thing . 
  ma per favore . 
  in ogni caso , `` good riddance '' . 
  acceptable , that 's the word !, 
  ( sorry , english is not my first language ) . 
  well , we see each other fairly often because of common friends ; for the moment , though , just like some sort of ` friends ' . 
  apart from the gazes i have noticed that she likes to get quite ... physical with me when nobody else 's around and tries to get me cuddle her a lot ; most of the times i manage to distance myself somehow but sometimes i just caved in - once we have been inches from kissing !, 
  needless to say , this thing is pretty much driving me nuts . 
  our family , our friends ... or just people . 
  i think i 'd be far more confident if i had the certainty that such a thing really is n't as strange or wierd as it sounds ; right now i am torn between resisting and caving in for good !, 
  moreover , should the relationship work out i 'd definitely like to do it above board ... without having to hide . 
  woah , really ? 
  i must admit that i 've never thought about it from that perspective . 
  kudos to you , mate !, 
  i 'm italian , both of us live in a big city ( rome ) and i think that most - if not all - of our friends would be accepting . 
  i ca n't really predict how would my family react , they 're the proverbial wild card . 
  as far as public acceptance goes i would be inclined to believe that it 's not much different from the us ... some people are going to have problems with it , other could be accepting . 
   id think about if you will regret it later then let her make the move and decide what to do . 
  you know what ?
