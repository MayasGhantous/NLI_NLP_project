  * finally , i believe we should note how the ( various ) inquisition ( s ) often acted under the direct orders of the rulers of the country they were based in , rather than to the pope in rome . 
  if you 'd like to read more about it , i 'd suggest reading henry kamen 's * the spanish inquisition : a historical revision * . 
  well , but the triple alliance was purely defensive in nature - meaning that the treaty 's clauses did not apply as a-h was the aggressor ... both the alliance and the austrians themselves were deeply unpopular here , so here you go . 
  a couple of fuck-ups and propaganda . 
  are you by any chance neapolitan ? 
  i just like good roman pizza . 
  but , hey , who am i to judge if you like chewing tyres so much ... 
  they 're still a million times better than those oversized chewing gums you insist on calling ` pizza ' . 
  i actually am not that sorry for myself , but thanks anyway . 
  good for you then , my ~ ~ enlightened ~ ~ prejudiced friend . 
   [ ... ] and losing to abyssinia . 
  to be fair - there were 18,000 italians against 40,000 ethiopians , who saw fit to ambush our columns at night . 
  and contrary to popular belief , the abyssinians had modern guns ( courtesy of france and russia ) ; it was n't like we were fighting against primitive savages . 
  adwa was more like our version of the little big horn . 
  moreover ... the british too got pounded by the zulus , so here you go . 
  i usually go to bed at 22:30 / 23:00 and fall asleep at midnight ... only to wake up at around 4:00 in the morning for no reason at all ( usually - but not always - right at the end of a dream ) . 
  sometimes i even manage to catch sleep again but more often than not , i just do n't ; i end up watching tv till dawn . 
  kind of sucks if you ask me . 
  i read my old sociolinguistics textbook ... it works ( almost ) every time . 
  oh , gym . 
  but i 'm too lazy to even try , and i 've already dropped out * twice * . 
  i 'm an apprentice bookbinder / book restorer . 
  the pay is ... miserable , to say the least , but i do like the job ; this is also the reason as to why i sell my employer 's old books in order to make up for it ( i get a commission ) . 
  am ( a ) a , if you wish ... 
  fair enough . 
  here 's something that imho could be considered a truly outstanding example . 
  [ salvo d'acquisto ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salvo_d%27acquisto ) was a young * carabiniere * ( only 23 years old at the time of his death ) who served in ww2 italy ; at the time of the german occupation he was the only officer left in the torre di palidoro area , near rome . 
  on september 22th , 1943 , someone from a nearby german garrison failed to properly handle a defective grenade ... the subsequent explosion blew up the whole enemy hq , and the germans held the partisans responsible . 
  22 innocent civilians living nearby were rounded up on the beach , with the intent of executing them as a reprisal for the attack . 
  the next day , salvo was informed of the whole thing and he decided to step in - claiming that he alone was the only perpetrator of the `` bombing '' , offering himself in the place of the civilians ( who were then freed ) . 
  i got laid . 
   [ ... ] i 'm quite happy that italians have sucked at war for the past 1800 years or so . 
  except that we really did n't . 
  italian here . 
  almost anybody born in or before 1923 ( except for categories such as factory and mine workers ) would have been drafted at some point in the war ; and this wall made all even more easier by the simple fact that conscription in italy had been mandatory for a almost a hundred years already , so the regime knew who to pick already . 
  however , not every draftee saw action or was sent to the front : many served in units such as the milmart ( coastal defence ) , the unpa ( air defence ) or the mvsn - the infamous `` blackshirts '' . 
  but by the time the war had broken out , these had become another branch of the army and the organisation itself also dealed with many aspects of civilian life such as auxiliary police tasks ( border control , coordination of emergency services and whatnot ) . 
  or , you could have just been assigned to one of the many naval/air bases scattered throughout the country . 
  hello !, 
  i would like to apply for the `` european history | modern italy & italian colonialism '' flair but actually , i 'm not even sure whether i truly deserve it or not .

  as far as our colonial history is concerned , i must admit that my primary sources are - besides the few dedicated books , of which there 's a dearth of , such as n. labanca 's * la guerra italiana per la libia . 
  1911-1931 * and a. del boca 's * italiani in africa orientale * trilogy - a couple of family friends who were born and lived in libya , plus a close friend 's grandmother who hails from what was italian eritrea ; i 've found their input helpful . 
  with regards to italian history , i 've read indro montanelli 's and roberto gervaso 's * la storia d'italia * which , despite its limitations , is actually quite comprehensive . 
  other books on the matter include , but are not limited to : j. j. sadkovich 's * the italian navy in ww2 * , adm. angelo iachino 's * il tramonto di una grande marina * plus quite a few military memories ( paolo caccia dominioni 's books about the war in north africa , g. bedeschi 's and m. rigoni stern 's autobiographical descriptions of the russian front ) and mack smith 's * i savoia re d'italia * ( a good read , if biased ) . 
  as far as the extremely-sensitive topic of the foibe/istrian exodus is concerned , my readings include : giorgio rustia 's [ paper ] ( http://digilander.libero.it/nvg/docrustia.html ) , a. petacco 's * a tragedy revealed : the story of italians from istria , dalmatia , and venezia giulia , 1943-1956 * and l. monzali 's essay , * italiani di dalmazia * . 
  ok , would do !, 
  thanks a lot . 
  i should probably begin by stressing how the colonisation of ethiopia was a relatively short-lived affair lasting a little less than five years , from 9 may ** 1936 ** to 5 may ** 1941 ** . 
  therefore , ethiopia did not quite receive the same influx of colonists and public investments than the other - and arguably more developed - parts of the empire ( eritrea and libya come to mind ) despite mussolini 's ambitious plans . 
  ** 1 ) ** let 's spend some words on the colony 's organisation first . 
  after its conquest ethiopia became part of the * africa orientale italiana * , or a.o.i. 
  ( italian east africa , which also comprised eritrea and somalia ) , and was put under the authority of a viceroy - who was also in charge of the a.o.i. 
  as a whole . 
  king victor emmanuel iii became the self-styled ( and internationally unrecognised ) emperor of ethiopia - having usurped that title from hail\u00e9 selassi\u00e9 , who never renounced to it - and two years later , benito mussolini was reluctantly appointed first marshal of the empire ... 
  ... a title he had to share with the king himself due to a legal quibble . ^ 1, 
  ** 2 ) ** the newly-created colony was soon divided into four * governi * , or governorates :, 
  * * addis abeba * : the most central , least populated ( 300,000 inhabitants , most of whom locals ) and arguably the most secure governorate of the whole lot , being under the direct rule of the viceroy . 
  * * amara * : nw of the colony , bordering both eritrea and the british possessions ( sudan ) . 
  * * galla e sidamo * : arguably the biggest , it was located in the west , between the capital and british kenya . 
  * * harar * : located in the colony 's ne , it bordered both french and british somaliland plus somalia proper . 
  the governorates were ruled by governors appointed by the viceroy himself ; these were further divided into * commissariati * , * residenze * and ( sometimes ) , * vice residenze * - which were just about the smallest administrative units around . 
  due to the lack of an official census in the colony ( something the fascist authorities bothered to apply to italians only ) the numbers of the ethiopian population can only be guessed by estimate ; the native population ranged anywhere from at least 6 to 10/12 million individuals , two thirds of whom were ethnic ethiopians ( attilio mori describes them as `` abyssinian '' ) and the rest belonged to others as well as the azebo galla , whose warriors sided with the italians during the conquest . 
  these figures - the only , accurate figures we have covering the interwar period - are largely due to mori 's work on the * enciclopedia italiana * , but are unreliable . 
  ** 3 ) whom did the fascist government send to ethiopia , and where ? 
  of course , mussolini had grand plans for ethiopia - and the depression of the italian south , coupled with the economic sanctions levied against italy by the league of nations , made the situation even worse . 
  many people were therefore even more willing to get out of the country , and the fascist government saw fit to re-route the migrational exodus towards its own colonies - mainly libya and ethiopia . 
  it would take at least a decade ( 1932-1940 ) for the influx of immigrants , southerners above all , to reach consistent numbers . 
  angelo del boca argues that early attempts at colonisation were unsuccessful because the prospective colonists saw too many dangers on their path , and thought that investing the few money available would n't have been profitable enough ^ 3 - but it is also worth noting that while the government offered free plots of land , the colonists had to pay for their expenses . 
  however i think that the relative instability of other possessions such as libya , whose brutal ` pacification ' lasted until 1931 , had a decisive role in discouraging people from immigrating in the colonies . 
  the fascist state then embarked in an ambitious construction programme , which focused on the building of roads connecting the new colony with the rest of the a.o.i. 
  ; the railways were modernised ( but only to a certain degree , and mainly between ethiopia and what whas then known as the french somaliland ) ; hospitals and other public buildings were built as well . 
  many italians were hired to to do the work , and even more joined them - this way , population skyrocketed from less than 5000 in 1936 to 40,000 in 1941 . 
  ** 4 ) what was the life of the colonists like ? 
  what about their relationship with the ethiopians ? 
  many - if not most - of the resident colonists chose to live in the urban areas ( especially addis abeba 's ) , where they set up thriving activities of their own and only a fraction chose to get into the countryside ^ 4 , mainly in order to work in the cotton plantations . 
  there was a precise reason behind such a choice : the ethiopian guerrilla was still alive and well , save for the territories held by the galla - allies , as we said , of the italians - as well as a few other parts of the country . 
  the ethiopians controlled most of the surrounding plateaus , thus making settlement there undesirable : colonial authorities would have needed some more years in order to ` efficiently ' quell the rebellion ( as they did in libya ) , but the war prevented any such plans from coming into full effect . 
  on a more personal note - and i 'm talking about the personal experiences of a close friend 's grandmother , who followed her husband in ethiopia - during the early years ( until at least 1939 ) interracial relationships were not that uncommon , and she seemed to recall that cinemas were n't segregated yet . 
  the racial laws , which forbade any such sexual relations , were enacted in 1938 but their application in the colonies was tardive and proved to be quite problematic to enforce . 
  law enforcement was provided by the * polizia dell ` africa italiana * ( p.a.i. 
  ) , which had been created for the purpose . 
  there were also many italian-speaking schools , which the ethiopians too had to attend , but these were short-lived and almost non-existent outside the major urban centres : however , many italians ended up learning amharic to some degree . 
  life in the plantations was hard - even moreso than in the urban centres - the work was exhausting and diseases such as malaria were rampant ; mortality was a concern . 
  on the other hand , the pay was good as the government actively encouraged people to immigrate . 
  as far as culture is concerned , the [ obelisk at axum ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/2_giugno_2002-axum.jpg ) was cut to pieces and rebuilt in rome - where it stood near the building of the former ministry of italian africa ( now the fao headquarters ) until 2005 . 
  addis abeba too was modernised with a few churches , avenues and other public buildings but not to the same degree as asmara or mogadiscio were . 
  ** 5 ) what happened to the colonists afterwards ? 
  italy declared war on the allies on june 10 , 1940 ; british somaliland was easily seized and our troops managed to hold out for the time being . 
  however , by early 1941 the tide had changed and prince amedeo di savoia-aosta - the king 's relative , as well as the last viceroy of ethiopia and commander-in-chief of the italian troops - fought a last stand at the amba alagi peak .
