  7,000 italians ( 3,000 of whom were * ascari * , indigenous soldiers that is ) held out for a whole month against 39,000 commonwealth troops from april 17th to may 14th , 1941 ; after having run out of water and ammo , amedeo sought the duce 's permission to surrender , which was granted on the 17th . 
  the british conceded the italians the honour of the arms , and amedeo himself died as a pow in early 1942 . 
  addis abeba had fallen a few days earlier . 
  meanwhile , the colonists - led by amedeo guillet - aka `` commander devil '' , a man with military experience - had started a [ guerrilla war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_guerrilla_war_in_ethiopia ) against both the british and the ethiopians , which lasted until october 1943 : as a result , many italians were put into concentration camps . 
  after the war , there were some 4000 of them left and were allowed to stay ; however , after hail\u00e9 selassi\u00e9 's 1974 deposition at the hands of menghistu hail\u00e9 mari\u00e0m and the ussr-backed * derg * ( junta ) , they were expelled and, 
  their property seized . 
  some sought refuge in eritrea ( federated with ethiopia in 1952 ) , others left and got back to italy . 
  nowadays there are none and their histories are being forgotten , if they have n't been already . 
  all we 've been left with are sad memories and a few ethiopian restaurants in rome .

  yes , it 's a typo !, 
  fixed it . 
  edit : i thought i had . 
  i was wrong . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  truth to be told i had already answered another similiar question , but here 's a recap . 
  btw - the issue of the italians living in the colonies had been conveniently forgotten by the new democratic government , and the very subject is still somewhat taboo amongst italians ... if it has n't been forgotten already . 
  there 's also a dearth of writings on the matter so you should n't be expecting too many footnotes - just the colonists ' recollections . 
  now - as far as ** libya ** was concerned , the situation was similiar to that of ethiopia in that the place was conquered , but the inhabitants were hostile to the new colonial masters ; the conquest had taken place during the italo-turkish war of ** 1912 ** , but the outbreak of ww1 prevented any serious plan from being carried out . 
  by ** 1924 ** , however , libyan fighters had rallied under the banner of omar al-mukhtar and the rebellion spread out so much that the colonial authorities were left in control of the major cities and coastal areas . 
  with the rise of fascism in 1922 , an incredibly brutal reconquest took place ( concentration camps , summary executions , you name it ) under gen. rodolfo graziani - the same guy in charge of the troops set forth to conquer ethiopia , who was aptly nicknamed `` the butcher of the fezzan '' by its own men - and the libyans were finally subdued . 
  mussolini wanted to make libya `` italy 's fourth shore '' , an thus an adequate immigration policy was set up ; between ** 1934 ** ( the year in which libya was ` created ' as an entity ) and 1940 , italians made up to the 13 % of the country 's population , as there were some 110,000 of them . 
  nearly half of the inhabitants in tripoli and bengasi were italians . 
  after the war , many returned home but some 44,000 chose to stay behind . 
  however , on ** september 1st , 1969 ** , all changed when muhammad gheddafi came to power after having deposed king idris . 
  on july 21 , 1970 all the assets of the italian residents had , by force of a decree of the newly-established libyan revolutionary command council , been confiscated ; the ` colonists ' were ordered to leave with whatever they could carry on their persons while their land , shops , homes , furniture , cars were being requisitioned and their social security accounts frozen ( as far as i know , no compensation was ever paid ) . 
  the last italians had left the country on ** october 7th , 1970 ** ; this date marked a national holiday - the `` day of vengeance '' - until 2011 . 
  only in 2007 these people were allowed to visit the place they lived and grew up in .

  * [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ywg7flauway#t=568 ) 's a short video about their ordeal ; unfortunately it 's in italian w/o subtitles . 
  the relationship between colonists and libyans was not quite among the best , although much had been forgiven after the war ( thanks at least in part to king idris ' tolerant stance ) ; but it can be compared to that in ethiopia . 
  an interesting trivia is that the allies left the racial laws in force after the italians had departed , until we relinquished any claim to it in 1947 . 
  also , after 1969 most libyan jews left as well , and many of them settled in rome . 
  italians had a far more cordial relationship with ** eritreans ** and ** somalians ** - eritrea having been colonised in 1882 , somalia in 1890 - whose countries were taken over relatively peacefully , mostly without any bloodshed . 
  by the 1940s these colonies were among the most developed in the empire and somalia in particular was administered by italy until july 1st , 1960 ( as a un trusteeship ) ... so not much resentment coming from them . 
  afaik , there are still a thousand italians living in eritrea ; those living in somalia mostly left after 1991 . 
  angelo del boca 's rather extensive trilogy ( * gli italiani in africa orientale * ) is imho very good , and is one of the few works on the matter ; unfortunately , it 's in italian . 
  i do n't know whether there 's an english translation out yet ... besides , i must admit that i 'm not too familiar with english-language sources . 
  i actually began wondering that too , but was n't sure about it . 
  many of the highlands were in the hands of the ethiopian fighters , but i know that some settlers tried to establish plantations near the omo valley . 
  perhaps the author was referring to them ? 
  if not , he ( and then i ) could have simply made a mistake ... 
  yessir , you are right . 
  this must be my brain 's day off ... 
  unfortunately , as i told the other user above , i 'm not too familiar with english-language sources on the matter . 
  but thank you for your kind words anyway , they 're much appreciated !, 
  i do n't know much about the other bits of history , but i can already tell you that the portrayal of rome in * assassin 's creed : brotherhood * was n't exactly accurate . 
  many buildings are in the wrong style ( either baroque or something that looks like a victorian 's conception of gothic architecture ) and the street layout is quite nonsensical as well . 
  let 's also gloss over the various `` districts '' , for pete 's sake ... 
  as surprising as it might sound , victor emmanuel iii was still - at least technically - mussolini 's boss ... despite being called the * duce * and enjoying a large degree of autonomy , he was still italy 's prime minister whether he liked or not ( he did n't ) and as such subject to the king 's authority like every other good citizen . 
  indeed , mussolini ended up being sacked by v.e. 
  iii on 25 july 1943 - but the king could n't have acted without the consent of the other members of the great council of fascism . 
  in reality , mussolini had some kind of leverage to threaten the king with ... namely , the very fact that he was the one running the country in his name and had - among the other things - an entire party , the council and the militia ( mvsn ) behind him . 
  however , his influence was balanced by the fact that both the army and the navy were never that much loyal to him than they were to the king ( who could still emanate royal decrees , attempt to sack his pm and veto new laws ) . 
  in short theirs was an uneasy , almost symbiotic relationship and their powers were in precarious balance ; an eventual power strife may very well have resulted in civil war . 
  sure thing !, 
  yes , the british were in charge of these camps . 
  of course - mine was just a figure of speech , but the governorates ' internal boundaries did in fact change slightly in 1938 ( nothing too drastic or worth pointless infighting though ) . 
  there were no disputes about it as far as i 'm aware . 
  there 's little to no support towards the cause today , and * some * monarchists are split between two factions supporting different pretenders ; but the schism can be considered minor and no sane monarchist would ever support the claims of the prince of naples ( his cousin amedeo is the sole official pretender and is recognised as such by the u.m.i. , italy 's monarchical union ) . 
  thank you !, 
  i wish i could have written more but my brain seems to have molten after the first post ... perhaps , when new documents will be made available to researchers , we could shed more light on the connections between them . 
   italy [ ... ] lost its wartime conquests as well as its prewar colonial empire . 
  as well as other parts of italy itself such as the julian marches , istria , zara ( in the far north-east ) plus briga marittima , tenda and the valley of the roia ( in the country 's north-west , at the border with france ) . 
  these maps ai n't up-to-date . 
  i 've been taught very little about the italian presence in africa - my hs teacher spent most of the ( admittedly , very little ) time she dedicated to colonialism in giving an extremely vague picture of it , only to jump to fascism and ww2 afterwards . 
  had n't i spoken with two family acquaintances who grew up and lived in libya , i would have never known that there were - and still are - italians living in africa , and what they went through . 
  also , a close friend 's grandmother grew up in colonial eritrea , and her stories have always fascinated me ... this is also why i wanted to learn more about that . 
  unfortunately , the whole topic has been conveniently forgotten in italy . 
   [ ... ] mussolini seemed to mainly want ethiopia so he could say that italy had a significant colony and to correct its stunning failure to take the same country several decades earlier . 
  but ethiopia had already been an italian colony since well before the war and during the conflict it only represented a totally secondary front which - due to the limited resources available - just had to be left to itself , despite its historical and psychological importance ; reinforcing or attempting to rescue the troops located down there was n't a viable option , and the * comando supremo * was fully aware of its impossibility to defend italian east africa . 
  had the war turned out in favour of the axis , ethiopia would have been eventually recovered - but not before its grip on north africa had been secured . 
  from a purely strategic pov , ethiopia 's importance was pretty nihil ... also , the stunning failure you 're referring to ( the battle at adwa , where 18,000 italians were slaughtered during a nightly ambush by some 40,000 ethiopians armed with modern weapons ) took place in 1896 , and by 1941 it had long been avenged ; so yes , propaganda said `` we 'll be back ! '', 
  but in the meantime , the a.o.i. 
  just had to be lost . 
   [ ... ] i 'm guessing that we 're going to butt heads a bit on the meaning of `` well before , '' as most of the sources i 've seen directly link the conquest to geopolitics in the runup to wwii [ ... ], 
  yes , that 's true . 
  but my point was simply to show that italy had effective control of ethiopia before the war had started . 
   [ ... ] ethiopia was never actually conquered and colonized , but rather italy had just threatened to align with germany if the rest of europe did n't ratify documents saying that ethiopia was subdued . 
  where did you read that ? 
  ethiopia was , in fact , both conquered * and * colonised ( relatively ) extensively . 
  true , there were still ethiopian resistance fighters on many of the country 's highlands , who made them undesirable to colonists ; and yes , the ` pacification ' was still in progress so the italians would have needed some more months/years in order to be done with the rebels - but to say that italy never actually got hold or colonised it is erroneous . 
  see [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2rqj4m/what_was_life_like_for_italian_settlers_in_east/ ) thread . 
  libya , on the other hand , was the one only partially in italian hands from 1912 to 1931 due to the insurgency . 
  as far as recognition goes ... italy was never internationally recognised as the ` rightful ' colonial master of ethiopia , and victor emmanuel iii himself only was the * self-styled * emperor - a title still belonging to hail\u00e9 selassi\u00e9 . 
  actually both france and britain proposed a relatively peaceful partition of the country - the hoare-laval pact - but it was leaked to the press and subsequently reneged by both powers . 
  and after italy had invaded ethiopia , the league of nations imposed strict sanctions on the country ... so this is why mussolini saw fit to turn to hitler . 
   in my experience , this is a subject most italians are very hesitant to discuss . 
  are there any particular reasons why this is so ? 
  what are some of the factors that have made italians uncomfortable when discussing their colonial legacy ? 
  ok , i 'll try explaining things ... 
  note : what follow are personal considerations of mine , and should be therefore taken as such . 
  * education played a fundamental role - if you think that until the mid-1960s history books stopped right at the end of ww1 , it 's easy to see why a whole generation has grown up totally oblivious , and indifferent , to the matter . 
  also , the way history is taught and portrayed in our books , even the newer ones ; present-day italy tends to have a rather partial view of its own past , as if fascism did not rule with the consent of many and the resistance was far more prevalent than it historically was . 
  let 's be honest : not everbody was a partisan , and some of them even did bad things - but whenever someone points his out , the anpi ( the partisan veterans ' association ) will label that person as a `` fascist '' . 
  the same is true for the colonisation - whenever it is actually discussed ( because quite a few teachers do , in fact , skip it ) only a summary overview of it is given ; ` war crimes ' are mostly hinted at or explained in two paragraphs , and neither those nor their perpetrators are usually described in detail . 
  libya ? 
  i have yet to find a schoolbook mentioning it .
