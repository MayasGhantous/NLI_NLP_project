  * due to cold war logic , italy - with the complicity of the western allies - was not subject to a thorough process of de-fascistification ; the very army generals , civil servants and party members who knew about or ( in some cases ) participated in our war crimes were mostly left at their places , and allowed to peacefully retire without ever having to be questioned about their role in past events . 
  these people had obviously little wish to make the country 's war-time exploits known , and were given a chance to do so ... some files got ` lost ' , many others were simply hidden . 
  something similiar happened with the so-called [ closet of shame ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armadio_della_vergogna ) . 
  * the new republican government - which , as we 've already seen , had still plenty of former fascists within - sought to distance itself from whatever had been done in the previous 20/30 years ; in the process , many italians came to believe that they * really * had nothing to do with all that , despite having lived the war in first person . 
  what resulted was a ( somewhat ) misplaced sense of victimhood ... `` i had nothing to do with it , the fascists did !, 
  '' , `` it 's all mussolini 's fault !, 
  '' , `` we were under a dictatorship !, 
  '' , `` we had no choice ! '' . 
  and a good chunk of them had tolerated or actually compromised with the regime . 
  in short , many italians do not have a clear picture or their recent past and our own history tends to be a rather divisive ( not to mention politicised ) issue here . 
  many people also do not have the slightest interest or do n't want to hear about it . 
  the italian state did not do its best - quite the contrary !, 
  - to ensure that the students could learn what we had done , and actual responsibilities were almost never placed upon actual shoulders . 
  we still have to come to terms with our own past . 
  at the uni , me and another guy managed to communicate through spitballs during an exam ; we had to time the launches perfectly , as both our professor and her assistant were ` patrolling ' the area around the [ benches ] ( http://www.indipendenti.eu/blog/wp-content/uploads/sapienza-28.jpg ) . 
  during the high school state exam ( which is done [ this ] ( http://www.corriereuniv.it/cms/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/esame-di-maturit%c3%a0.jpg ) way over here ) , i just copied whatever the girl behind me had written in her math test ... 
  i 've always sucked at it . 
  luckily , the prof was too busy reading marx to notice . 
  italian reporting in . 
  here the average work week is monday to friday , from 8:00 am till 7:00 pm ; once every month , we also worked on saturdays ( i was an accountant ) . 
  now my week as an apprentice bookbinder/restorer is monday through saturday , from 7:00 am to 5:00 pm ; but hs students here already go to school on saturdays - so that 's not a shock . 
  in my previous job , we had one hour ( actually 45 minutes ) for lunch ; now that i 'm working at a small workshop , i can relax a bit - when you get hungry you can just stop working at around midday , cook something in the backroom and start again when you 're finished . 
  chatting with ( mostly reasonable ) customers in the flesh is also a plus . 
  `` see you later '' . 
  nothing , it 's free ( italian here ) . 
  prescriptions/work certificates are also free , but you do have to pay for the kind of medical certificate you would need in order to join a gym or a pool ; prices can vary wildly from gp to gp - mine wanted around 60 $ . 
  if you visit a gp in a different region , but do n't legally reside there , then you 'll have pay around 16 $ . 
  * getting asleep , as well as managing to actually sleep . 
  * trying not to feel drowsy for the rest of the day . 
  * finding a spot where to park my car , and not getting fined . 
  thank you too !, 
  btw , [ another one ] ( http://i35.tinypic.com/hvnj7q.jpg ) used to hang at via dei fori imperiali but was taken down long ago . 
  i believe both hypotheses to be wrong . 
  the practice , which is limited to the naples area ( e.g. 
  you wo n't find it in rome ) , might actually have to do with the sanctions imposed by the league of nations in 1936 . 
  after the italian conquest of ethiopia , ` real ' coffee - only a fraction of which was imported from that colony - had become a rarity and people resorted to drink chicory juice as a substitute ; not exactly the best-tasting beverage around . 
  such a situation persisted until the immediate postwar , so i would n't be surprised if people started offering each ofter a cuppa coffee once there was no more lack of it ... 
  ... and that such a tradition had stuck for the years to come . 
  none of my sources seem to be aware of the phenomenon , though , so my guess is as good as yours . 
   however can you think of any examples other than the hapsburgs ? 
  victor emmanuel iii was one such cases ( only 1.53 m tall ) , seeing that his parents were first cousins ; this is also the reason as to why he was betrothed to the relatively-unknown elena of montenegro , whose family had at the time almost no connections with the other royal houses . 
  fixed it ( the spelling ) . 
  caf\u00e9s offered chicory juice in its place as the real thing was selling out real quick ; it soon became unavailable , and the regime imposed ` autarchic ' equivalents of the things we had to import ( such as chocolate , coffee , rubber , etc ) . 
  i do n't drink very much , and i absolutely despise every kind of wine . 
  however ... 
  * disaronno - it 's sweet enough and can burn your throat , which i like . 
  * also , [ cynar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cynar ) ... it 's an acquired taste , and i did n't quite like it at first . 
  * as far as beers are concerned , i very much like the ichnusa . 
  slightly bitter , but not too much . 
  as i think i 've already said , mine is part of [ my former address ] ( https://www.google.it/maps/place/piazza+dei+quiriti,+roma/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x132f605f7a9e03e1:0xb6ab57e4995565e2?sa=x&amp;ei=pke5vphqfcp_uouggogp&amp;ved=0cciq8gewaa ) . 
  i 'm not a very imaginative person when it comes to these things , am i. . . 
  somebody dressed as catwoman was tasering a young man while he was jogging in a park , and according to her she was training him to be the antichrist or something . 
  i think i 'm going to write a book about it someday ... 
  when i was younger ( 6/7 y-o ) , my parents signed me up at a swimming pool . 
  since the courses had already begun , our instructor wanted me to catch up with the others ... and one fateful day , the bastard saw fit to remove my armbands while i was in the middle of the pool . 
  it did n't end well for him , and i still dread going to such places . 
  also , getting ( almost ) run over by a bus is not an experience i would recommend . 
  when i was younger , clock tower 3 ( more precisely , the scene during which sledgehammer is bludgeoning the shit out of a 12-year-old girl ) literally gave me nightmares . 
  i never played that game again , and just gave it away . 
  another close contestant is resident evil 4 ... those damn regenerators !, 
  you look like an idiot , go get a decent haircut . 
  and for the love of god ... stop buttoning your shirt all the way up !, 
  you just ca n't fight the ` stache ... he 's gon na win anyway . 
  ( seriously - i do n't have to worry about it anymore , and my skin is much more okay with it than without ) . 
  fyi , rome and the surrounding region of latium are definitely * not * southern italy ( but they 're both worth exploring anyway ! ) . 
  * the ** castelli romani ** are a very quaint and lovely area south of rome with plenty of lakes and picturesque medieval towns all around ( frascati , velletri , rocca di papa , castel gandolfo - where the pope 's summer residence is located - marino , genzano , nemi ) . 
  also , lots of good food and wine to be had down there !, 
  frascati , velletri and rocca di papa are famous for the wine , genzano for its bread and a peculiar flower festival . 
  * if you fancy lakes , then ** bracciano ** is another lovely place you 'd like to visit ( tom cruise got married in the city castle ) . 
  * another two big lakes are at ** vico ** and ** bolsena ** . 
  * the ` disappearing ' ( read : carsic ) lake at ** canterno ** is home to a most interesting reservoir . 
  * ** ariccia ** is yet another quaint town renowned for its * porchetta * . 
  * ** subiaco ** ( home to st. scholastica 's abbey ) , zagarolo , and petrella salto are other interesting towns . 
  * ** anagni ** and ** sutri ** are home to beautiful cathedrals ; the latter also has a roman arena . 
  * ** tivoli ** , a short train ride east of rome , is where emperor hadrian 's villa is located - as well as the * villa d'este * and its gardens . 
  also have a look at the homonymous town , it 's delightful . 
  * ** viterbo ** is another picturesque town just north of the city and can be easily reached via train . 
  the * parco dei mostri * at bomarzo is located nearby and is definitely worth a visit . 
  * ** ostia antica ** is rome 's very own pompeii ( it 's in the ostia district ) . 
  it is also cheaper , much less crowded and better preserved than pompeii is !, 
  however , do bring a guidebook with you as the points of interest are not well marked . 
  * visit the etruscan tombs at ** tarquinia ** , or the necropolis at ** cerveteri ** . 
  * ** civita di bagnoregio ** , also known as `` the dying town '' , is a settlement built upon a tufa hill which is slowly being eroded by the elements . 
  the panorama from there is truly breath-taking , as is the town itself . 
  * ** tusculum ** and ** castro ** are abandoned towns ( now part of an extensive archaeological park ) well worth some of your time . 
  * as it 's already been suggested , head to the abbey at ** montecassino ** . 
  while the abbey itself has been rebuilt after ww2 , the view from there can not be beaten ( the building itself is a quite impressive , not to mention very accurate , reconstruction ) . 
  * the gardens at ** ninfa ** , near latina ( south of rome ) , are lovely - as is the nearby castle ( castello caetani ) . 
  * ** gaeta ** is a good ( = cheaper , less crowded but with all the charm ) alternative to amalfi . 
  * ** terracina ** , sperlonga , ** sabaudia ** and san felice al circeo are other renowned resort towns . 
  * i like ** fiumicino ** 's small historical centre ( and when there , do not forget to have some fried fish at ge.pa.gi 's ) . 
  * the ** pontine islands ** ( ponza , ventotene , s. stefano ) would make for a good day trip ; the first two resemble capri quite a bit . 
  latium can be easily toured by train , and there are 8 railway lines ( the fl network ) connecting rome with pretty much every other town in the area . 
  these trains can be crowded during rush hour but if you travel at sensible times they offer a rather relaxing - not to mention easy - way of getting around . 
  some kinds of delay are to be expected on those lines , but the trains are usually on time . 
  il pigneto mi pare un quartiere inutilmente fighetto , un po ' ( tanto ? ), 
  come san lorenzo . 
  i 'm on mobile now , so i 'll try to be as concise as possible ... while the risorgimento was carried on mostly by the upper strata of the population ( however , the * garibaldini * were also aided by the local , and landless , peasants during their conquest of sicily ) there were certainly effects on the lower classes as well . 
  * internal trade barriers were taken down and with them , the need of a passport to travel within the other pre-unitarian entities ( such as the papal states ) ; but in some cases - e.g. , the south - the results of such trade liberalisation were controversial . 
  this also meant that some taxes , like the one on flour , were applied to places which did not historically levy them ( such as the former two sicilies ) and this led to frequent revolts .
