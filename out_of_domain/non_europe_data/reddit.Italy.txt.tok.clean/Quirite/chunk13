  * local laws , as well as the states ' customary measures , were repealed in order to be replaced with piedmontese legislation ( and the metric system ) . 
  a partial exception was tuscany : the death penalty was in force throughout the kingdom except for that region , where it had already been abolished in 1786 . 
  however , the new country 's laws were finally standardised in 1889 with the adoption of the new civil and penal codes which , among the other things , abolished capital punishment ( which would be back in force again from 1931 to 1947 ) and decriminalised homosexuality for the first time in our history . 
  * north-eastern italians , which had been under austrian domination from 1797 to 1859/66 , did certainly welcome the absence of a strong censorship apparatus as well as the depart of those austrian-appointed bureaucrats which had monopolised the local administration at the expense of the local notables . 
  * attempts were made to redistribute lands among southern labourers ( the latifundus was still alive and well down there ) but the local landowners managed to block any such proposal ; a serious land reform saw the light of the day only in 1951 . 
  so , the situation did not improve much for the southerners and in some cases it did actually worsene . 
  * mandatory schooling , which piedmont had established in 1859 thanks to the so-called * legge casati * , was extended to the whole peninsula ; and for the first time , italian ceased to be a ( mainly ) literary language . 
  the south begins at the border with campania . 
  i think i must , at least partially , disprove your point : there was indeed an italian colonisation ... in the sense that more than 40,000 italians settled there from 1936-40 , quite a few italian enterprises opened local branches and were tasked with building an ambitious road/railway network ( the latter was really more an improvement over the only existing line ) connecting the new colony with the rest of italian east africa , colonial governorates were created , a colonial police ( the * p.a.i. , polizia dell ` africa italiana * ) established for the occasion and addis abeba itself modernised in the same way asmara or mogadiscio were , albeit only partially due to time constraints ... 
  i 'd argue that while definitely short-lived and still in its early ( perhaps , even mid ) stages , the italian rule of ethiopia was * truly * colonial and not just a ` mere ' occupation of the country . 
  as to why people think it was never colonised , my very own * personal * theory is that the 1896 defeat of ethiopia 's future colonial master is much more ingrained into popular culture than our colonisation attempt actually is , and the fact that the latter was a rather short-lived - not to mention related to our defeat in ww2 - affair certainly does contribute to such an erroneous impression . 
   so in popular latin ( i.e. 
  vulgar latin ) , it was typical to `` clip '' the ending of words off . 
  the most obvious example in english is `` g-dropping , '' so you 'll hear southern americans talkin ' about runnin ' and jumpin ' and skippin ' and lovin ' and swimmin ' , and so on ( incidentally , shakespeare dropped his g 's too ) . 
  this is exactly what happened with the roman dialect , of which i am a native speaker ( and self-taught enthusiast ! ) . 
  verbs - when conjugated in the infinitive mood - all get their endings ( * - are * , * - ere * , * - ire * ) chopped off . 
  some example :, 
  * * ciriolare * ( `` to make a hasty and unbelievable excuse for smth . '' ), 
  has become * ciriol\u00e0 * ;, 
  * * fottere * ( `` to fool/deceive s.o. '' ), 
  has become * f\u00f3tte * ;, 
  * * benedire * ( `` to bless s.o. 
  or smth . '' ), 
  has become * bened\u00ec * . 
  this was n't always the case , though , since the so-called * romano di prima fase * - corresponding roughly to the early variety of dialect attested from the mid-13rd to the late-16th centuries - generally kept its infinitives ` unchopped ' if slightly different ( e.g. , * andare * , * temere * , * dormire * had become * annane * , * temene * , * dormine * ) . 
  i wonder whether the aforementioned phenomenon is related with the loss of endings in vulgar latin . 
  ho editato il post . 
  excuse me , what nationalism are you referring to ? 
  because i for one do not condone what my country did in the colonies and certainly do see its many defects - * especially * its less-than-stellar human rights record during parts of its recent history , such as the ` pacification ' of libya . 
  anyway - my point was just to show that ethiopia was , indeed , colonised ; obviously not as much as the french or english did but still , it 's not like the italians just sat there and did nothing waiting for the war to break out . 
  and yes , i do realise how many of those things that happened before and after the conquest were morally questionable ... 
   [ ... ] and the railroad truly pales in significance to the german infrastructure construction along the french coasts . 
  would you be so kind as to explain me what does this paragraph have to do with colonisation ? 
  i 'd believe than one thing is making use ( through forced labour ) of already-existing materiel located in a first-world country close to home , another - different - thing is having to import the raw materials needed from the mainland at a time in which these were deeply valuable at home due to the sanctions . 
  also , it is true that most of the work they did on the rail network in ethiopia was more like an improvement of the only existing line , but the so-called `` imperial '' road network was quite a feat of engineering in itself . 
  still not an excuse to invade another country , if there ever was one ... 
  the us certainly did not colonise us , but never even * attempted * to ; was there * an intention to do so * in the first place ? 
  did they declare war on us for the express purpose of colonisation ? 
  were any american settlers sent ? 
  did the occupying powers build anything substantial in order to further their colonisation goals ? 
  the answer is `` no '' , any way you try to look at it . 
  but on the other hand , all of this really happened in ethiopia regardless of how many funds were spent in proportion to the other colonial powers or how much our regrettable ` adventure ' , if such may be called , might have actually lasted . 
  you realise that a parallel ca n't be drawn between the two realities . 
  eh , unfortunately i 'd have to rely on some of these people 's personal stories , and i do n't personally know any of them . 
  my friend 's grandmother does n't know either ... but i would guess that most of those relationships were really no different than what we would call a concubinate . 
  wait a minute - the papal states , despite their name , were neither a federation nor a loose condfederation ... quite a single unitary state instead !, 
  it could n't have warred against itself . 
  however , it is true that cities such as ferrara became part of it after a ( bloodless ) conquest ; san marino was actually almost annexed in 1749 . 
  and no , actually the papal states did n't have neither a stable ** army ** nor mandatory ** conscription ** for much of its existence - this is something that took place only after the napoleonic conquest of rome . 
  but the papal army had , throughout its long history , a truly enormous amount of units and specialities many of which were little more than short-lived experiments ; its backbone was naturally the * fanteria di linea ponticificia * , whose early 19th-century uniforms looked like [ this ] ( http://www.araldicavaticana.com/exfanteria_b.htm ) and [ this ] ( http://www.libreriamilitareares.it/imglibri/1151600001.jpg ) ( the latter 's a corporal ) . 
  other rather famous units were the [ dragoni pontifici ] ( http://www.libreriamilitareares.it/imglibri/1151200001.jpg ) - which also acted as law enforcement , being tasked with hunting down the brigands hiding in the countrysisde - [ engineers ] ( http://www.araldicavaticana.com/exgenio.htm ) , [ artillerymen ] ( http://www.araldicavaticana.com/exartiglieria_b.htm ) , and the like . 
  however , after 1860 , it was mainly foreigners who were entrusted with the defence of what was left of the papal states ; the zouaves served the pontiff until 1870 , when rome was annexed by the kingdom of italy . 
  you can find more uniforms here : http://www.araldicavaticana.com/divise_ex_esercito_pontificio.htm, 
  surprisingly enough , ** life ** in the 17th-19th century papal states was pretty much like life elsewhere in italy . 
  romans in particular were known for being rather unruly and each ward ( * rione * ) of the city had an intense rivalry with one another - trastevere hated monti , monti hated trastevere with a passion ^ 1 , etc. , etc. . . * breccolate * , stone fights among youngsters from different ` hoods , were rather common and usually took place in the forum ... whose ruins often served as ammunition !, 
  ^ 2 these are well detailed in both giuseppe berneri 's poem * il meo patacca * and giovan camillo peresio 's * il jacaccio , overo il palio conquistato * . 
  religion was naturally a feature of everyday life and was held in high regard , but there were also more ` pagan ' forms of entertainment such as the carnevale , in which horses would have been made to run through via del corso and then the contestants had to stop them with their bare hands ( many lost their lives trying to do that , and this is exactly why the celebration was banned in 1883 ) or the quarantore ... a more ` serious ' , yet pompous , carnival which took place during the forty hours between christ 's death and his resurrection . 
  other important feasts took place on june 29th ( st. peter and paul ) and the 15th of august , * ferragosto * . 
  public executions were also occasion for social gatherings and these usually attracted big crowds as they were * extremely * cruent ; many were carried out with a hammer ( * mazzolatura * ) or , after the early 19th century , a guillotine . 
  law enforcement was the duty of a rag-tag - and , arguably , ineffective - militia , which would later be reformed as the * gendarmeria pontificia * in 1816 ; the countryside itself was rife with brigands and highwaymen . 
  literacy was definitely not not widespread , with most people being illiterate ; [ letter-writers ] ( http://www.giovannagiordano.it/image/photo/40.jpg ) and notaries were thriving as their services were very requested . 
  the church , through the various religious orders , took care of the citizens ' health by means of ` hospitals ' run by them . 
  as far as industry was concerned , it saw a very limited growthduring the latter half of the 19th century and the rail network was not very extensive as well , mostly connecting the capital with the so-called * castelli romani * and viterbo ; and most people were either farmers or artisans . 
  finally , the jews were forced to live in a small , walled ghetto near the river ( which was prone to flooding ) from 1555 until 1852 and then again until 1870 . 
  but despite all these hardships , life then was much more gaudy than one would be led to assume . 
  of course there was also a nobility , whose most important families ( the barberinis , orsinis , colonnas - just to name a few ) all resided in rome and more often than not , hated each other . 
  but there were also other houses , mainly in what are now the marches and romagna - giacomo leopardi came from one such faimilies - some of whom even had jewish origins ( such as the pierleonis ) ; many of them rose to fame because one of their family members was elected to the papal throne , and many of the honorific titles at the papal household were very sought after . 
  until the late 16th century , these families often engage in bloody feuds , during which the population was also involved - each ward of rome was governed by a * caporione * ^ 3 ( some kind of neighbourhood mediator/facilitator , whose term lasted six months ) who usually took orders from the most notable family in the ` hood and many citizens also enrolled in their private militias , so clashes between rival bands were not at all uncommon . ^ 4,

  that 's correct , i agree with your considerations . 
  herer 's some books you can read about the italian perspective of the war :, 
  * mario rigoni stern 's * the sergeant in the snow * and giulio bedeschi 's * centomila gavette di ghiaccio * are autobiographical accounts of the authors ' survival on the russian front . 
  * paolo caccia dominioni 's * alamein 1933 -- 1962 : an italian story * deals with the north african campaign ;, 
  * j.j. sadkovich 's * the italian navy in ww2 * is a good read if you 're interested in the matter ... 
  if you do n't mind a film suggestion , you may have a look at * el alamein - the line of fire * - it 's a very well done film , and is actually one of the ( admittedly , very few ) fair and realistic depictions of our involvement in the war . 
  jeez ... those eyes . 
  or whatever 's left of them , anyway . 
  quella che quarant ` anni fa era una zona assai brulla e pietrosa - una [ cosa ] ( http://lh6.ggpht.com/-3c4hgjsspoo/u94eh0bqqai/aaaaaaaam24/fqurdkk2qcq/dscn0007-campo03%252520-%252520copia_thumb%25255b4%25255d.jpg?imgmax=800 ) del [ genere ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eojl_y52hdk/uxs9w_r0gfi/aaaaaaaac9o/btnwne3owjm/s1600/10.jpg ) - \u00e8 diventata molto [ boscosa ] ( http://www.newsabruzzo.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/vomano1.jpg ) ; modestamente , l'alaska ora je fa ` na pippa !, 
   yea , but italy also was a disaster in africa, 
  * north * africa , and even there it was n't a complete disaster . 
  the east africa campaign was a different story . 
  i managed to sell the same book back to the same second-hand shop which had sold it to me in the first place , and for almost double the money ( the guy behind the counter likes to think he knows shit about books - he does n't ) . 
  all it was missing was the original dust-jacket ... 
  roman pizza , crispy and with a very thin crust ; as far as toppings are concerned , the [ amatriciana ] ( http://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/n3q3vlydg6mxv0epjarwsw/l.jpg ) or the * quattro formaggi * can not be beaten . 
  the roman variety can also be more easily digested than the kind of ~ ~ tyre ~ ~ pizza they bake down south , and the very fact that i 'm roman does n't have naturally anything to do with the answer . 
  unbearably hot in the summer ; cold , windy and miserable in the winter ( we 've got only two seasons over here , and we get no snow at all during ` the cold one ' ) . 
  taxes have gone through the roof , the few services they give us back are mediocre , public transportation is cramped ( not to mention nearly useless ) , other people have become quite a fair bit ... ruder and on top of it all , things have generally gone downhill in the last 20 years . 
  the neighbourhood i live in used to be vibrant and kind of upscale , now it 's neglected and most shops have closed . 
  ( the city in question is rome , italy ) . 
  mine was an 11-year-old , 1.6 [ fiat punto ] ( http://www.mercatinoticino.com/uploads/my7z933w_ddbpruxdjpeg ) from 2003 complete with luxury optionals such as a broken headlamp , ` stereo ' system and shift-stick ; the engine burned oil and it used to stop when running at low rpms , the rear-view mirrors did n't fold properly and were often pushed back by the wind , the driver 's [ parasol ] ( http://s.sbito.it/images/05/0535571452.jpg ) always dropped down ( much to my annoyance ) and [ what i believe to be a part of the gearbox ] ( http://x.cloudsdata.net/9l/images/products/large/4fd0a97933fbb_252943.jpg ) once fell off while driving on the freeway . 
  my parents gave it to me with the goal of letting me ` finish her off ' so that even if it got dents or scratches along the way - learning to drive * good * is no easy task - nobody would 've noticed . 
  so yes , it soon became full of 'em . 
  that car was a veritable piece of crap , but it was * my * piece of crap ... and do i miss her dearly . 
  it 's good to actually have a job ... well , sort of !, 
  let me explain :, 
  * i am a former accountant and worked for a notorious ( or , better , * infamous * - given the sheer amount of shady practices that were going on in that office ) tour operator in my city . 
  i worked ten hours a day for six days a week , sorted out all of the office 's shit , was paid under the table only to be ultimately laid off at the tender age of 22 `` because of the crisis '' .
