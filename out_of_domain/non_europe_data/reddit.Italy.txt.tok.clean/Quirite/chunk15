  ( du ' palle ! ), 
  i 'm afraid you 'll have to stick to campsites , afaik camping in the wilderness is illegal over here . 
  argentina , like brazil and the u.s. , was a popular destination for italian immigrants from the mid-19th century to the 1940s . 
  however , unlike those in the united states , the immigrants came mainly from italy 's north-east and not from the south ; the same thing happened in brazil . 
  it is estimated that some 40 % of argentinians have italian ancestry and there 's a book about the phenomenon , fernando j. pallaro 's * storia degli italiani in argentina * ( donzelli , roma 2007 ) offering an overview of these people 's experiences and their numbers . 
  unfortunately , it 's in italian only . 
  i do n't think it 's been mentioned , but in 17th/18th/early 19th-century rome the authorities , due to the ever-present threat of violence , forbade the populace from carrying the so-called * saracche * ( swords ) , knives , * punteroli * ( stilettoes ) and obviously guns although these were n't as widespread . 
  ^ 1 indeed , the city had a problem with microcriminality - being robbed after dark was not at all uncommon , youngsters from different wards of the city generally liked to engage in frequent clashes among them ( trastevere hated monti , monti hated trastevere with a passion , etc ) and this is why they carried slingshots or wooden batons in defiance of the regulations ; brawls took place so often in the * hosterie * ( pubs ) that pope leo xii had mandated the proprietors to install a gate so that their venues could be ` isolated ' , and that customers only buy wine without drinking it in the premises . 
  this said ... many just ignored the laws , old and new , and the so-called * bulli * - a curious figure once typical of rome , that is , youngsters who became famous/respected in their ward after a good deal of * battaglie a rocci * ( stone fights taking place against rival bands in the roman forum ... often using pieces of it as a weapon ! ), 
  and duels during which they had vanquished their opponent - were notorious for their love of knives , so much that they had to be banned . 
  but this did n't obviously deter them from carrying on their honour-based lifestytle . 
  ^ 2 ibid . 
  mainly economical reasons - the country 's north-east was rather poor back in the 19th century , and life in the countryside was miserable ( a good deal of the immigrants made a meager living as [ rice-pickers ] ( http://desk.unita.it/cgi-bin/showimg2.cgi?file=f_eco_l2_0625/00000012/0000178f.ab1dbe4f.jpg&amp;t=big= ) , possibly one of the most exhausting and less rewarding jobs known to man ) ; maladies such as malaria or the pellagra were also rampant , so here you go ... as far as argentina is concerned , from the late 19th century to the 1930s it was one of the richest and most developed countries in america , so the immigrant saw it as an obvious choice . 
  you mean a ` really ' ancient civilisation such as the greeks or the egyptians , or will a more recent example do ? 
  roman teenagers from the 17th/18th/early -19 th centuries grew up in the street and the society they lived in was rife with violence . 
  every * rione * ( ward ) of the city usually had a long-standing rivalry with another , and these neighbourhoods ' identities were very strong ; for example , the people from trastevere despised monti , the * monticiani * hated trastevere with a passion , everbody hated the ghetto and so on . 
  thus many teenagers and their friends often formed what we 'd call neighbourhood gangs , but - and this is an important point - there was no extorsion or racketeering going on : these hot-headed youths spent their days fighting the other youngsters from different neighbourhoods . 
  these ` battles ' often took place in the roman forum and were known as * battaglie a rocci * - stone fights , whose ammuniton was provided by the nearby ruins . 
  knife , sword ( more precisely the * saracca * , a type of sabre ) and even slingshot duels were also extremely common among young people , to the point that hospitals regularly received people with related wounds ... especially during or after the carnevale , as recalled by father bresciani in his * edmondo , o dei costumi del popolo romano * ; an astounding number of youngsters died because of such forms of ` entertainment ' . 
  hostarias , or pubs , were the quintessential meeting place for your average roman and were also the kind of place in which brawls were much too common ; these youngsters , but also their older counterparts , lived a honour-based lifestyle in which even the minor offences had to be ` settled ' - you 're looking at someone the wrong way ? 
  snickering at that guy a table over ? 
  then you 're looking for * rogna * , or trouble . 
  as mentioned earlier , jews were also made the object of such ` innocuous ' pastimes ... when outside the ghetto , they had to wear a yellow ribbon on their hats and were easily recognisable : many a youngster took one of them during the carnevale and [ made him/her roll down the capitoline hill inside a barrel ] ( https://zanzathedog.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/giudeo-nella-botte.jpg?w=320 ) . 
  other forms of ` entertainment ' during such a festivity was the * corsa dei barberi * , during which wild horses were made to run through the via del corso and contestants had to stop them with their bare hands . 
  perhaps unsurprisignly , too many young people died this way . 
  card and dice games were * extremely * popular , and more often than not source of disputes ... many of which ended up badly for the losing party . 
  favourite games were the * morra * , * faraone * , and the like but itinerant puppet theatres , the most famous of which belonged to the vitriolic ghetanaccio , were popular as well ; these often narrated the histories of fol poems such as the meo patacca . 
  finally , attending public execution ( which were particulary cruel back then ) was a popular pastime for both young and old people ; * mazzolature * - during which the prisoner 's head was smashed on a stone pedestal with the help of a hammer - quarterings and decapitations were also an occasion for social gathering exactly the same way a market or the hostaria were . 
  truth to be told op i find trastevere to be an overrated , pretentious tourist-trap full of insufferable hipsters ; therefore , save for a few exceptions , i would n't eat in there . 
  anyway , i 'd definitely recommend * da giggetto * , in via del portico d'ottavia ( ghetto ) or * augusto * , in piazza de renzi ( no reservations accepted , be there before 8:00 pm ) . 
  ** avoid ** * la casetta di trastevere * , offering what probably is the very worst food in rome , and roscioli - somehow it 's all the rage but i find that even supermarkets sell better pizza . 
  absolutely do avoid , for the love of god , * la prosciutteria trastevere * in via della scala - not only it 's full of hipsters , but the guys there are bunch of rude , snotty northerners who would n't recognise a good porchetta if it sat right under their noses ( and what is worse , they do n't even know what a * ciabatta * is ) . 
  worst sandwich shop in town . 
  92 minuti di applausi !, 
  before somebody suggests it , definitely * not * david gilmour 's `` the pursuit of italy '' . 
  the book is overly-biased and the author himself not only appears to have an axe to grind against the very concept of italy but also goes to incredible lenghts in mocking , belittling , underestimating and generally utterly dismissing whatever has been achieved in the past 150 years ... and in doing so , he 's does n't disdain to repeat old stereotypes and outdated notions . 
  literally `` a book to be thrown away with great force '' . 
  on the other hand , indro montanelli and roberto gervaso 's `` la storia d'italia '' really is a comprehensive , not to mention fairly accurate , overlook of our history from the middle ages to the 1990s ; but i do n't know whether there 's an english translation out , though . 
  another good read - despite its flaws , as i personally found the author to have a slightly biased pov - would be denis mack smith 's * i savoia re d'italia * ( `` italy and its monarchy '' ) . 
  swiss mercenaries were already in use at the papal court during the 15th century ; the guards , as we know them today , were formed in 1506 and acted as the personal guard of the pontiff , even though they were sometimes employed in battle ( e.g. 
  during the sack of rome of 1527 , during which the swiss took heavy losses but managed nevertheless to bring the pope to safety ) . 
  the guard 's thus been tasked with the protection of his person ever since . 
  however , in the 19th century a number of other guards ' corps were created such as the * guardia nobile * and the * guardia palatina * ; these two were originally born as units of the papal army , but were later tasked with protecting the the pope 's residences ( like the quirinal palace ) . 
  both corps were composed mainly by italians and were only disbanded in 1970 ... although they had long been purely ceremonial by then . 
  there was also the * gendarmeria pontificia * , which was both the former papal states ' police force and then the vatican 's ( until 1971 , when it was replaced by the modern * gendarmeria vaticana * ) - this one too was manned by italians . 
  while i 'd prefer to wait for a much more qualified person than i am to chime in , i believe it all started with the first gutenberg bibles , which had indeed forty-two lines of text over two columns ; these , in turn , reflected the way prayer books were written before the adoption of the printing press .

  well ... this is going to be a bit awkward , as i 'm currently helping out as an apprentice book-binder ; but both pio colombo 's and piero trevisani 's * storia della stampa * ^ 1 - as well as my employer - agree with the theory .

  always speaking about the european jewry , those living in rome from the 17th to the early 19th centuries were forced to wear a yellow ribbon on their hats whenever they ventured outside the ghetto . 
  this caused some problems , especially during the carnevale - it was not unheard for a jew to be taken , put into a barrel and then [ made to roll down the capitoline hill ] ( http://roma.andreapollett.com/s8/roma-be05.jpg ) for the amusement of the crowd . 
  such barbaric customs are documented in david silvagni 's * la corte e societ\u00e0 romana dei secoli xviii-xix * or father bresciani 's * edmondo , o dei costumi del popolo romano * . 
  while those shameful practices had already begun to disappear sometime in the mid-19th century , only the emancipation of the jews - as well as the distruction of much of the roman ghetto - following the capture of rome in 1870 put an end to them for good . 
  actually , italy was persuaded to leave the alliance not much because of the fact that it did n't share any ethnic ties with germany , but mostly because of the rivalry against austria-hungary . 
  the italians had , throughout the early 19th century , already fought three independence wars against the austrians who still held ( and repeatedly refused to hand over ) many of those territories they were claiming ; moreover , italy 's entry into that * defensive * alliance was both a purely political move - the french had seized tunisia in 1882 against our government 's wishes - and an immensely unpopular one at that ... not just within the italian public opinion , but also among the austrian high command ( konrad von hotzendorf had suggested a pre-emptive attack on the italian ally more than once ) . 
  finally ... austria-hungary 's harsh treatment of the italian-speaking minorities within the empire did n't help , either , and only served to fuel further enmity ( not to mention insistent interventionism on the entente 's side ) between the two . 
  the battle cry of the italian troops before and during ww1 was actually `` avanti savoia ! '', 
  but it was also used throughout ww2 , only more sporadically . 
  it fell out of use after the republic was established in 1946 . 
  can confirm , this is also the standard pronunciation taught in the ( italian ) classical lyceums . 
  the [ butteri ] ( http://it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/buttero#/image/file:buttero_1885.jpg ) from what were then the northern and southernost areas of latium ( in the papal states ) had to live near , and conduct their herds through , that region 's inhospitable swamps ; there were also plenty of brigands so it was not unusual for them to carry knives and and a gun on their persons . 
  they also lived ( well , some of them still do ! ), 
  in the * maremma * area of southern tuscany . 
  in ww1 italy the carabinieri acted both as military police/barrier troops , and a number of them was simply left behind in order to guarantee the rule of law . 
  both the guardia di finanza ( which also dealt with border control ) as well as the civilian * regia guardia di pp . 
  * ( royal police ) had no such luck and were sent en masse to the front . 
  ernest hemingway 's * a farewell to arms * details the carabinieri 's role in the conflict fairly well . 
  hi there , i would like to modify my flair to `` european history | modern italy and its colonies - rome and its dialect '' !, 
  here are a few posts :, 
  [ rome i ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2t9eyh/life_in_the_papal_states_papal_army_papal/cnx1uew ), 
  [ rome ii ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2tykml/what_were_gun_control_laws_like_in_the_rest_of/co4gvfx ), 
  [ rome iii ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2u25b2/what_did_ancient_teenagers_do_for_fun/co4hrt8 ), 
  [ rome iv ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2u25b2/what_did_ancient_teenagers_do_for_fun/co4hrt8 ) ( a bit controversial as the thread was actually canceled ) . 
  [ inquisition i ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2riv0i/how_many_deaths_is_the_catholic_church/cngbtwt?context=3 ), 
  the * soprintendenza * only checks that its architectural standards are met : they could n't care less about what kind of food is served ( otherwise all those kebap places , burger kings and mickey d 's in the city centre would have already closed ) . 
  and they actually let shops as [ blue ice ] ( http://vintage.johnnyjet.com/photos/italy-rome-june-2010-62.jpg ) hang their horrendous neon signs on the fa\u00e7ades of historic palaces , so i definitely would n't worry that much about it ... 
  yes , i am . 
  btw - i 'm afraid you might have got it the other way around , for the inspectors from the comune are the ones in charge of checking the wiring and all while the * soprintendenza * takes a look at the ` aesthetical ' side ( such as shop signs ) . 
  moreover , they only get interested if a building 's grade-listed . 
  what ? 
  i just wanted to point something out . 
  there was indeed a concentration/transit camp in italy - the risiera di san sabba ( which is located near trieste , in the country 's northeast ) . 
  however , this one was created and put in use only after italy 's fall in september 1943 , when the area fell into german hands : it was the germans who opened and run that camp ... some 5000 among jews and other ` undesirables ( such as communists , partisans , political dissidents ) were interned and killed there . 
  while the adriatic operation zone was run directly by the germans , elsewhere in the italian social republic ... better yet , the areas that were under fascist control ... it was the g.n.r. 
  militia who helped out rounding up ( and in many cases , massacre ) jews , partisans , anti-fascists and other civilians . 
  i would n't know ... 
  i 'm italian , and the american war effort is not my area of expertise !, 
  perhaps another user could give us an insight ? 
  at the very least they filmed * rome * ... in rome ( at cinecitt\u00e0 ) . 
   some of the dalmatian coast [ ... ], 
  dalmatia - actually , zara and its environs - was not a colony , but a province that italy had gotten after ww1 ; the same can be said about the italian dodecanese , which was considered part of the mainland . 
  on the other hand , the country 's african possessions ( perhaps even the italian concession in tientsin ) were considered as colonies . 
  wow !, 
  it seems like i 'm late to the discussion , but anyway ... 
  i should probably clarify that this post mainly deals with life in mainland italy under fascist rule ; if you want to know what life in the colonies was like , see [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2rqj4m/what_was_life_like_for_italian_settlers_in_east/cnie6d7 ) . 
  to begin with - the shortages of many kind of goods such as coffee , chocolate and various types of raw materials due to the league of nations ' embargo of 1936 , certainly had an impact on our average italian 's lifestyle . 
  more ` autharkic ' ubstitutes ( such as italrayon , * orbace * - a sardinian tissue - instead of wool , chicory juice in the place of coffee , etc. , etc. ), 
  of all those things we had to import were not the best , but the only things available ; many italians had to make do with what they got * well * before the war , and the subsequent rationing only made things worse .
