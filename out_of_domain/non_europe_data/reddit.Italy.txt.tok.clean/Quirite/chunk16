  a new , harsher penal code was implemented in 1931 which re-introduced capital punishment in our country ( something that had been abolished in 1889 ) and its civil counterpart published in 1942 : both codes are still in force , albeit expurgated of their ` fascist ' content and with many modifications . 
  ** homosexuality ** was not tolerated as well , despite having it been decriminalised with the penal code of 1889 ; suspect homosexuals were often charged acting on anonymous denunciations then trialled , fined and sent ` into exile ' ( * al confino * ) in one of the many penal colonies located in the remote islands of the tyrrhenian - the same way most other dissidents were dealt with . 
  it should also be mentioned that the fascist regime did in fact try to forcibly ** italianise ** ( by forbidding the use of these people 's languages also via beatings ) large swaths of the south-tyrolean and croatian/slovenian populations living in those lands - which were also home to sizeable ethnic italian communities - that had been incorporated after ww1 . 
  in turn , some of them organised anti-italian resistance movements which were suppressed by the fascist authorities ; this would later cause quite a few problems both during and after the war , as it would ultimately lead to the expulsion of some 300,000 ethnic italians from the now-yugoslav istria and dalmatia ... 5000 of whom would have been brutally murdered between 1944 and 1949 during what are known as the * foibe * killings ( these are a kind of karst sinkhole common to istria , in which the bodies of the victims - or sometimes even the victims themselves , when still alive - were uncerimoniously dumped ) . 
  when the ** racial laws ** came to be in 1938 , jews were forbidden from being employed in the public administration , the schools , the army , the fascist party ( ! ), 
  and the like ; ` aryan ' families could also not have a jew at their service , and their businesses had to be made clearly recognisable by means of a [ sticker ] ( http://www.lanaturadellecose.it/files/media/immagini/guido/negozioarianoweb.jpg ) reading `` this is an aryan business '' . 
  these laws also forbade ` miscigenation ' between the italian colonists and the so-called camitic natives but their application in the colonies proved to be problematic ; interestingly , while these were abolished by the new italian government in 1944 , the allies kept them in force throughout libya until 1947 . 
  in some way fascist italy was an awkward contrast of old and new , progress and tyranny , innovation and inefficiency , luxury and poverty . 
  majestic ocean liners brought poor families in search of a better life ; a backwards army paled in front of a relatively modern navy ; shanty medieval neighbourhoods were razed in order to make space for bombastic avenues and government palaces ; railways were extensively modernised and partially electrified , yet the road network was n't cared for to the same degree ; airports and air bases were built , but the air force could have been considered obsolete by 1940 ; early tvs co-existed with the lack of radar ... and so on and on and on and on . 
  i do n't think anybody mentioned the fact that both the inail , italy 's agency for the safety on the workplace , and inps , the country 's national social security agency , were actually creations of the fascist government : this might at least in part explain the reason as to why so many elder people seem not to condemn the regime as thoroghly as one would expect . 
  the school system was also reformed twice , in 1923 and 1940 , and italy 's middle schools as we know them are in fact a product of the regime ( more precisely , these were created by giuseppe bottai , who was minister for education at the time ) . 
  speaking about ** rome ** and its environs , large swaths of the city 's * centro storico * were bulldozed in order to make way for new boulevards and avenues ; an entire district was bulldozed and the fora separated when * via dell ` impero * was built in 1932 , most of the ward of borgo had been torn down so that the large boulevard connecting the city with st. peter 's was begun ; countless new government buildings ( post offices , hospitals , schools , council houses ) were done and an entirely new district - the e42 , which should have been the showcase for that year 's world fair - built in the outskirts ; line b of the metro was begun . 
  in southern latium , the marshes were reclaimed with the help of ` settlers ' from northern italy , and quite a few model towns ( such as aprilia , pomezia , littoria ) were founded . 
  as far as the ** media ** were concerned , censorship was obviously a factor to consider when creating a new production . 
  but mussolini himself was both an expert communicator and keen cinema enthusiast , and his policies reflected this : soon a national industry was born , new studios were built ( cinecitt\u00e0 , 1937 ) and dubbing made mandatory ... not just because of awkward nationalist policies ( such as the italianisation of foreign loanwords and actors ' names ) , but also because a significant portion of the population was objectively illiterate and could n't have read the subtitles . 
  but italy had also experimented with an early type of ** television ** - or , better , * radiovision * , as it was known back then . 
  it made its first debut on 4 june 1939 ; its programmes were produced by the eiar ( the state agency tasked with radio broadcasts ) and obviously only available to the happy few belonging to the party cadres and the richer strata . 
  pre-existing structures were adapted for tv broadcasting , a few ones were created from scratch and most , if not all , of the programming was done live with an early variant of analog broadcasting ; there was little recording going on and this also why almost nothing has survived to this day . 
  tv service was hastily suspended after the country 's entry in ww2 and the few archives were either scattered or lost during the war .

  the * telefoni bianchi * was the name of a popular genre of sentimental films whose protagonists were shown to be well-to-do burgeois : their homes usually featured white telephones ( hence the name ) , as these were seen as status-symbols back then . 
  most phones were actually black - and not many people could afford to have one in their home !, 
  also , this was a rather useful way of keeping both emigration and unemployment in check - to give you an example , ethiopia was colonised by 40,000 ( mainly southern ) settlers and more than 200,000 italians were employed in order to build the ` imperial ' road network in the east africa . 
  coffee/cotton plantations , as well as the r.a.m.b. 
  ( the state agency tasked with the production , transportation , distribution of bananas and other fruit ) employed many people as well ; so did the colonial administration , the p.a.i. 
  ( * polizia dell ` africa italiana * - the colonial police ) and the various businesses that had been established there . 
  some of the major italian firms also opened branches in the colonies . 
  not quite - but the regime did indeed extend and modernise the country 's railroad network whose lines were , in some cases , also electrified ( quite a big deal back then ) . 
  the railway lines built from 1860-1890 tend to follow circuitous routes as many mayors at the time wanted their towns to be served by them , whereas those built from the 1920s on - such as the ` new ' bologna-florence line , which has now been replaced with a modern high speed track - are in many cases very straight and what 's more important , have double tracks . 
  trains could go faster and take slightly less time to reach their destinations ; therefore , at least in a certain sense , that affermation can be considered true . 
  i agree with everything you wrote , however :, 
   [ ... ] mussolini , in typical pompous fashion , had figured that anti-aircraft guns were not necessary for cities and he only station the few anti-aircraft units he had in ports and airfields . 
  this meant allied aircraft could bomb at will any italian cities . 
  i should probably point out that this is not quite true , at least for rome : do n't know where the claims originated from , but several efforts were actually made . 
  for example , aa guns were deployed in the various military forts ( * forte bravetta * , * forte boccea * , * forte antenne * ... ) which had been constructed from 1877 on and formed a ring around the capital ; the u.n.p.a. , italy 's civilian air defence organisation , was tasked with installing countless [ sirens ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbknf9x1jqw ) all over the roofs of public buildings such as schools , post offices , churches , etc. , etc. 
  - while the buildings themselves often sported in-built aa shelters such as [ the one below termini station ] ( http://www.youreporter.it/video_il_bunker_segreto_della_stazione_termini ) or the twelve public bunkers located underneath what is nowadays the eur district . 
  unfinished metro tunnels were also re-purposed around 1940 . 
  every major italian city had aa batteries but these were often not quite effective due to the lack of a radar system . 
   treaty of rapello, 
  that 'd actually be the treaty of rapallo . 
  yes , i had read that in march 1940 the duce had asked goering to lend further aa pieces as the production of the new * cannone da 90/53 * ( that 'd be the italian equivalent of the german 88 ) was apparently still underway . 
  also , when rome was declared an ` open city ' the * comando supremo * ordered the city 's aa batteries not to open fire on allied or german airplanes - but of course , while this detail alone is clearly not sufficient to prove that they had been deployed in or near the city , one can ascertain their existence by simply browsing the war bulletins . 
  the aa batteries i am speaking about were mainly * cannoni 76/40 * and some larger 102/35s - they were manned by the local m.a.c.a. 
  units , which belonged to the fascist militia ( m.v.s.n. ), 
  but were composed of army reservists . 
  also , i 've seen the remains of one such batteries - this one was located near the city centre , on top of the monte testaccio , and its base still visible ; many of the bolts were still in their places . 
  and if you manage to get into one of these forts ( many have been abandoned ) you can see similiar finds .

  i choose to see it as a win-win . 
  what about `` modern italy and its colonies - city of rome '' ? 
  i reckon that might do the job . 
  let me begin by explaining the power dynamics of fascist italy first . 
  as you may very well already know , italy was technically still a monarchy and mussolini a prime minister ; but his powers and those of the king had become more and more balanced over time and the two were , in a sense , ` forced ' to co-operate as neither could have gotten rid of the other by himself ; mussolini wanted to overthrow victor emmanuel iii sooner or later , but that would have probably lead to civil war . 
  both the army and the navy were loyal to the king ; indeed , they had sworn loyalty to him and not to mussolini . 
  ^ 1 however , he had the militia ( m.v.s.n. ), 
  and the party - whose * gerarchi * ( most prominent members ) sat in the grand council of fascism - behind him . 
  now , it seems obvious that any successful attempt at getting rid of one party by the other would have needed the intervention of either an external force or someone who could 've tipped the balance of power ; victor emmanuel 's attempted coup of march 1940 , ^ 2 in which he sought to replace a more and more war-like mussolini with a loyal galeazzo ciano , could n't be carried through because ( in part ) of the grand council 's opposition to such plans . 
  however , by 1943 the situation had changed - mussolini was now rather impopular even among his own as his actions had clearly brought italy to ruin ; the invasion of sicily and the allied bombing of rome a few days earlier proved to be the last straw . 
  both the grand council and the king now shared the same goal , and an exhautorated mussolini was in no position to resist : on july 25th , 1943 , the council approved the so-called * ordine del giorno grandi * which was effectively a vote of no-confidence ... mussolini learnt of this and asked the king to receive him at the quirinal . 
  and after a brief meeting , he was sacked and arrested . 
   [ ... ] finally , were n't the council afraid of mussolini ? 
  did n't il duce have the power to get rid of the members that opposed him ? 
  not at the time ... but they came to fear him again after he 'd been freed by the germans and put in charge of the italian social republic ; many of the * gerarchi * who had passed the vote of no-confidence would have later been executed . 
  the m.v.s.n. 
  was disbanded , the duce replaced by the more ineffective pietro badoglio and army soldiers were left to fend for themselves ( badoglio did n't give clear orders , and the chain of command was now disrupted ) . 
  it should also be noted that mussolini was never - due to his role as pm - as powerful as hitler or stalin ever were ; yes , he got rid of many dissidents and anti-fascists but all of this still happened in a somewhat-constitutional setting in that they had to be trialled by a dedicated tribunal and either sent into exile ( * al confino * ) on remote islands - such as s. stefano - or , sometimes , sentenced to death . 
  but turning against the king or his own party ( like stalin did ) was not possible because 1 ) such a course of action was objectively beyond mussolini 's reach and 2 ) at that point , both parties would have probably worked together to oust him as it happened in july 1943 .
