  venice never belonged to the spanish ... 
  ... in which 40,000 ethiopians armed with modern guns massacred 18,000 italians . 
  at night . 
  during an ambush . 
  more like our version of little big horn , if you ask me . 
  as much as i would like to think that we did n't really want to do it , we actually really did . 
   so why is venice speaking spanish/brazilian ? 
  venetian language - parts of which happens to sound like some sort of spanish or portuguese . 
   damn , that spaniard tried to fool me , i knew that spain had some territories in italy ... 
  fyi - the bits under spanish domination were the south , sardinia and lombardy . 
  of course not - ( most of ) the country 's centre ( well , if you exclude pisa and livorno ... ) is n't like that . 
  indeed . 
  i dunno , but in rome we used to call them * portogallo * instead of * arancia * . 
  wait a minute - italian renaissance , c. 1400 ... 
  am i missing something ? 
  and italians , too ( in trentino , as well as much of istria and parts of dalmatia ) . 
   `` american girl in italy '' , ruth orkin , rome , 1951, 
  you know that the photo in question was staged , right ? 
  i 'm on mobile , but i 'll try to explain nevertheless ... 
  due to italy 's entry into nato ( 1949 ) and the beginning of the cold war , the already timid efforts aimed at the de-fascistification of the country 's bureaucratic apparatus was brought to an halt and the allegations levied against most war criminals conveniently forgotten ; few of them were actually tried and nothing like the nuremberg/tokyo trials took ever place over here , with the result that many things did not make the headlines or textbooks . 
  these people 's misdeeds have been deliberatedly hidden or forgotten for decades - but so were the german and yugoslav war crimes against italian citizens ... probably as part of a perverted deal , see the [ armadio della vergogna ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/armadio_della_vergogna ) - and until the mid - '60s our very own history programmes stopped at ww1 . 
  italian historiography too used to be rather reticent on the matter and , in some cases , is still quite biased : every attempt at a retelling seems to degenerate into sterile political debates so there are not many good , comprehensive ( or impartial ) narratives out there . 
  foreign historians do not necessarily hold a more balanced view ; many do n't seek access to primary sources and seem to do little more than repeating outdated notions or stereotypes . 
  by just dismissing italy as an incompetent ally whose actions mattered very little on the battlefield they 're not just contributing to foster a negative - and mostly unjustified - opinion of our military but in doing so they 're actually cementing the myth of italians being `` good folks '' ... what is thought of as a buffoonish army is seen as clearly incapable of committing war crimes , and the dearth of italian sources available does n't facilitate the efforts to dispel those beliefs ( which i believe to be closely linked ) . 
  also - our country 's relatively limited scope of operations , coupled with its perceived ineffectiveness and early fall do not lend themselves for a correct evaluation of the impact it had on occupied countries ; most of the crimes our army had committed ( the 1924 - 31 ` pacification ' of libya , the conquest of ethiopia ... ) actually took place before the war and can often get overlooked in favour of more famous , or blatant , ones such as the holocaust . 
  i would like to conclude by saying that more often than not one ca n't have a civil discussion about italy 's role in ww2 ; both because of those long-lingering - not to mention defamating - stereotypes , but also because of many italians ' refusal ( some of which is clearly politically motivated ) to acknowledge their country 's objective responsibilities . 
  these are , by and large , the reasons as to why postwar italy was not held responsible for many of its government 's actions ... which remain to this day less known than those of its german or japanese counterparts . 
  luckily , things have been changing since the mid - '90s and nowadays it 's not difficult to find a reasonable number of publications on those topics . 
  while i would n't go as far as to talk of factions - after all , a historian 's pov is his/her own - many of those belonging to the so-called ` old guard ' are still influenced by their own political beliefs . 
  anyway , even the topics we had deemed to be untouchable ( such as the risorgimento ) have nowadays been extensively talked about , debated and re-assessed - albeit with differing results ... 
  that answer is correct , but is my personal opinion that the post in question should be amended by pointing out that the country was indeed effectively colonised ( claiming that it did `` resist colonisation '' is imho a bit simplistic and wrong ) , with some resistance movements in the highlands . 
  yes ... but during that time span the country was effectively colonised ( 40,000 permanent settlers were brought from overseas as well as 200,000 other italian workers who built the so-called ` imperial road network ' , the existing rail line was expanded , addis abeba itself was modernised , italian companies opened local branches , colonial police and administration were established , italian-language schools were opened and so on ... ) . 
  i would argue that an occupation is purely military in nature , whose objectives are generally short-term and aimed at providing manpower , materiel or other strategic advantages so as to further the occupying power 's war-goals . 
  now , i think that neither france nor yugoslavia were declared war upon with the explicit goal of deliberatedly altering their ethnic make-up and relative cultures in order to make these countries an integral part of whatever country they had been attacked by . 
  china and the poland were imho ( partial ? ), 
  exceptions , but i think that the rest of those you llsted were ` mere ' war-time occupations . 
  ethiopia , on the other hand , had been 1 ) expressly invaded for colonisation purposes as well as other , more ` psychological ' reasons from the very beginning ... and 2 ) the italian authorities made sure that every action aimed at making it an integral part of the empire was done . 
  true , it was a short-lived affair - if we may call it that way !, 
  - but an explicitly colonial one at that . 
  yes , that 's another aspect not mentioned in my post ... 
  i agree with your analysis . 
  it 's an acquired taste ... 
  * under the tuscan sun * ... it 's just ... goddammit , it 's truly awful . 
  that and the chick-flick with julia roberts , * eat , pray , love * - possibly the most ( inadvertenly ? ),

  not to mention the fact that the pope was ( and still is ) by all means a foreign head of state . 
  until 1870 he was the sovereign of the papal states and from 1929 on , that of the modern vatican city-state ... so yes , he 's * also * a politician .

  mine broke down almost constantly - the first day , [ what i believe to be the gearbox 's support ] ( http://x.cloudsdata.net/9l/images/products/large/4fe870934a84d_36611.jpeg ) fell off while i was driving on the highway . 
  then the engine began to burn oil in addition to the annoying tendency of stopping at low rpms , then again i had to tamper with the radiator 's thermostat so that the cooling fluid would keep circulating , i replaced the spark plugs ( which were constantly dirty ) and relative wiring thrice , the ` stereo ' system was unuseable , the driver 's parasol dropped down whenever it wanted to , air-bags and air-conditioning were gone , the headlamps were too weak so i could see barely anything at night ... 
  ... in all fairness , she was a 12-year-old [ 2003 fiat punto ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/fiat_punto_ii_front_20100509.jpg ) with some 150,000 km behind her ( i literally grew up in that car , as it accompanied me from the early middle school to my twenties ) but i could n't afford a new one at the time . 
  not quite , but interventionist intellectuals ( such as gabriele d'annunzio ) relentlessly campaigned in order to pass it off as a `` glorious bloodbath '' that could , and would , have regenerated the nation 's decaying burgeois spirit and finally gotten rid of austria - which they saw as italy 's natural enemy . 
  therefore , going to war was to them not only ` just and righteous ' , but also an auspicable thing . 
  this view was of course inspired and influenced by futurism , an artistical/philosophical movement which exalted strength , speed , dynamism and modernity ... curiously enough d'annunzio and marinetti ( the founder of the aforementioned movement ) hated each other , and g.d.a. 
  actually called him `` a phosphorescentous cretin !, 
   why is the vatican the only one that is a city state ? 
  because what we know today as vatican city used to be the much larger ** papal states ** , which ruled much of central italy ... long story short , by 1860 it had lost a great deal of its lands to the upheavals in favour of an unitary italian nation - and its fate was sealed by the defeat at the hands of the piedmontese during the battle of castelfidardo . 
  the territory of the papal states was then limited to rome , as well as part of what is today 's latium ; its independence was guaranteed by france and it was exactly in order to avoid a war with that country that garibaldi 's 1867 expedition was stopped short at mentana !, 
  but what was left of the p.s. 
  was now a shell of its former self , and the italian government had begun expressing its interest in moving the capital to rome more than once - so , in order to put pressure on both the pope and the international community , it saw fit to relocate the capital to florence in 1865 . 
  five years later - with france too busy fighting in the franco-prussian war - the italians took the opportunity to finally ** capture rome ** ( 20 september , 1870 ) and proclaim it as the new capital of the kingdom ... however , the pope did * not * recognise the new state of affairs and declared himself a `` prisoner in the vatican '' , forbidding italian catholics from participating in the new country 's political life . 
  despite the italian parliament having already passed the so-called * legge delle guarentigie * ( which affirmed the sanctity and inviolability of the pontiff 's person , granted him the right to receive foreign ambassadors and established a public fund for his expenses ) relations among the two parties remained strained until the early 1900s , with the election of the more liberal pope benedict xv ; such tensions were evident in the markedly anticlerical stance the italian governments had adopted up to that time , as well as the urban fabric of the `` new '' rome - whose first town planning scheme ( * piano regolatore * ) of 1873 was a veritable monument to such aspirations . 
  in short :, 
  * among the new districts built after 1870 ( savoia , the esquiline , etc. . . ) prati had its road layout designed in such a way that a pedestrian could not see st. peter 's dome from its streets despite it being right next to it . 
  * many religious orders were suppressed and their properties torn down , sold for redevelopment or otherwise used for new purposes ( e.g. , rome 's oldest jail - the * regina coeli * - was originally a carmelitan convent ) . 
  * roads , statues and other monuments were dedicated to famous people the church had been in contrast with throughout history - a * lungotevere * was dedicated to the proto-patriot arnaldo da brescia ; a monument to giordano bruno unveiled in piazza campo de ' fiori ; the main thoroughfare leading to the vatican ( via cola di rienzo ) dedicated to a 14th-century roman who had revolted against papal authority ; the janiculum hill dotted with busts of all those people who had died defending the second roman republic of 1849 ; a new monument to garibaldi ( whose horse 's buttocks faced st. 
  peter 's ! ), 
  placed on top of that hill ; a grandiose ossuary containing the bones of the patriots who had died in 1849 placed nearby , and so on and on and on ... 
  anyway - the whole matter , known as the `` roman question '' , was a source of nuisance and slight embarrasment for the italian government : it would only be settled on 11 february 1929 when benito mussolini , in a cunning political move aimed at pleasing the more religious strata of the population , signed the ** lateran treaty ** which established the modern , independent vatican city-state as we know it today . 
  well , that 's hard to beat but i think that both istria and dalmatia would make a fine example . 
  these lands were , and still are , home to various ethnic groups - mainly italians ( most of whom were forced to [ flee ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istrian_exodus ) or were [ murdered ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foibe_killings ) from 1943-49 ) and slovene/croatians , but there were also small pockets of jewish , hungarian , serb and bosniak minorities . 
  * until 1797 , these lands were ruled by venice ; napoleon then gave them away to the austrians , who kept both of them as part of the littoral province until 1919 , when they were split between the kingdom of italy ( the julian marches , istria as well as zara and its environs ) and the kingdom of serbs , croats and slovenes ; borders were further amended with the 1924 treaty of rome . 
  * after 1943 , nazi germany annexed both of them as part of the adriatic operation zone ; in 1945 these were divided by the allies , who established two zones ( a and b ) of occupation separated by the morgan line . 
  trieste was declared a `` free territory '' under u.n. protection . 
  * in 1947 , yugoslavia annexed zone b as well as most of zone a ; the rest of it and the free territory of trieste were reunited with italy after the london memorandum of 1954 , and have been part of it ever since . 
  * the borders were further amended in 1975 with the treaty of osimo . 
  * after 1991 , most of the julian marches and part of istria belong to slovenia ; the rest and dalmatia , to croatia . 
  well , i do n't know about south africa but i can answer this question of yours :, 
   just wondering [ ... ] how long it took in other countries . 
  as i already explained in another thread , italy began experimenting with radiovisual transmission in the 1930s but practical results would n't be seen until a few years later . 
  regular transmissions began on ** 4 june 1939 ** but tv sets were only available to the happy few belonging to party cadres and the richer strata . 
  content was produced by the e.i.a.r. 
  ( the state agency tasked with radio broadcasts ) and many of the presenters too came from that background ; pre-existing structures were adapted for tv broadcasting ( which was done through an early variant of analog ) , a few ones were created from scratch and most , if not all , of the programming was done live with little recording going on : this also why almost nothing has survived to this day . 
  tv service was hastily suspended after the country 's entry in ww2 ( 10 june 1940 ) and the few archives were either scattered or lost during the war .
