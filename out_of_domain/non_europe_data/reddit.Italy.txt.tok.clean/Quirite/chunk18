   chi ha i siti pi\u00f9 brutti dell ' occidente ? 
  pedobear , obviously . 
  agony hopefully wo n't last too long , but even then it 's got ta finish ... sooner or later . 
  and if there 's really a god out there , very well - otherwise , whatever . 
  i would n't probably be able to notice . 
  some examples from near home : * burini * - people from the rest of latium and their ridiculous hillbilly accents - and the abruzzese living in the mountains , who are a totally different breed from their more urbanised cousins on the coast . 
  southerners in general , sardinians ( they love their sheep , kidnap people , speak an unintelligible tongue and have a fascination with knives ... ) , people from the far north-east ( it used to be our bible belt , just with more alcohol ) . 
  i could probably buy my ex back , that cheap hoe ... 
  the * mazzolatura * was a type of capital punishment which was proper to the papal states ( along with hangings , quarterings and , from the early 19th-century on , guillotine ) during which the condemned was made to place his/her head upon a block of stone in order for the executioner to bludgeon it with a hammer . 
  the article on wikipedia argues in favour of it being performed until 1870 but the claims made by the piece 's alleged sources seem dubious to me , seeing that david silvagni 's work ^ 1 does n't record such a later use and that mastro titta - a roman executioner active in the early/mid 19th century - was notorious for either quartering or beheading the prisoners under his care . 
  not only was it an incredibly cruent method but also - perhaps unsurprisingly , given the fact that the roman society of the time was quite violent - rather popular among the masses , for executions used to be regarded as an occasion for social gathering in pretty much the same way a market or the * hostaria * ( pub ) were . 
  some arms have already been delivered by the italians last august , mainly aks and anti-tank weapons . 
  these had been seized on board of an ukrainian cargo headed for a country of the former yugoslavia ( the whole thing happened in the early '90s ) and were then stored in a sardinian arsenal waiting for their scheduled scrapping - but because of the isis our government saw fit to give them to the kurds instead . 
  and you have n't seen the [ action ] ( http://m.liveleak.com/view?i=af1_1318725238 ) at bala murghab yet ... 
  but seriously , enough with the stupid jokes already . 
  that 's actually what i was saying , perhaps i was n't clear enough !, 
  - i know that it was our navy ( i 'm italian myself ) the one which requisitioned the weapons found in the ukrainian cargo and then gave them away to the peshmergas . 
  honestly , i do n't think the situation to be * that * bad over here - true , the times we 're living in * really * are tough but i would like to point out that we 've got our fair share of beggars ( mostly gypsies ) and i have yet to see someone looking for left-overs in the rubbish . 
  yes , seriously !, 
  and for the records , i used to live in borgo pio then moved near cornelia , and that 's imho a rather gritty area . 
  he probably meant the ones we 'd air-dropped last summer , which were requisitioned on a vessel in the '90s ( not the helos ) . 
  yes , / u/oldworldglory , i might like to add my two pence ... :-), 
  to be honest , op 's questions present many of the misconceptions that have been fuelled by war-time propaganda ; but i 'll try to answer them nevertheless . 
  to begin with , the * regio esercito * had been in existence since the very creation of italy in 1861 , and we can safely affirm that its military history was not just made of defeats as he or she seems to imply - in many instances , it came out as the victor ( like after the italo-turkish war , world war i , etc ) . 
  the performance in wwii was due to many factors and it can not be ascribed to the old refrain `` italians are cowards '' . 
  * italy suffered from the lack of both a decent industrial base , whose output was only a fraction of that of its german or japanese allies , and natural rescources - which had to be imported . 
  this , coupled with the trade embargo in force since 1936 , made the replacement of much-needed war materiel difficult on many levels ... whatever equipment the army lost , it could hardly be replaced . 
  * second , much of the aforementioned equipment was often lacking in quality * also * due to a dysfunctional procuring system which privileged the industries ` closer ' to certain elements of the government . 
  with some exceptions , things such as mortars ( the brixia ) , machine-guns ( the infamous breda 30 ) , clothing ( the armir was sent to russia with boots ... whose soles were made out of cardboard ! ), 
  and artillery ammunitions were markedly inferior to their german or allied counterparts ; much of said materiel , such as tanks or planes , was obsolete by 1940 and had in some cases been designed with different tactical uses in mind . 
  * stockpiles had largely been depleted because of the intervention in the spanish civil war , and were in the process of being re-stocked when the war began ... a war mussolini had declared pretty much on a whim . 
  italy was also unprepared - to give you an example , by june 1940 much of the merchant shipping was not recalled in time and the ships were either unable to each the mediterranean or requisitioned . 
  but it was thanks to the italians that rommel was able to receive many of the supplies his troops needed despite ** 1 ) ** the port facilities at bengasi or tobruk being woefully inadequate ** 2 ) ** the constant threat to italian shipment by the royal navy/faa and ** 3 ) ** said supplies having to be brought to the frontline via long , and difficult to defend , truck convoys ; the very fact that these were * actually delivered * was nothing short of a miracle . 
  * fourth , the royal italian army was not mussolini 's little toy , as it had not sworn loyalty to him but rather to the king . 
  ^ 1 moreover , the relationship between officials and soldiers was not an easy one ... the latter were for the most part ( often illiterate ) draftees , while the former usually came from the higher classes ; many promotions were also not due to merit . 
  this might also explain why the italian troops seemed to fare so much better when led by german officers instead of italian ones . 
  * as i 've already said , many soldiers did n't have much training or experience and what they underwent before being sent to the front was little more than a basic introduction . 
  ^ 2 in some - rarer - cases , a few of them did n't even speak italian !, 
  finally , the number of brigates ( just two ) in a division was inferior to that of its opponents and while the two contendants may have looked equal on paper , in practice they often were not . 
  * organisation within the army was inefficient and dysfunctional on many levels ; most of the higher-ups ( with the exception of gariboldi , messe and the duke of aosta ) had an antiquated concept of warfare . 
  the navy - by virtue of a 1931 law in which the influence of italo balbo , himself an accomplished aviator , shows pretty clearly - was forbidden to fly it own aircrafts except for reconnaissance purposes ... ^ 3 in case of need , the commander had to contact * supermarina * ( the fleet command ) , which would 've relayed the request for assistance to the air force ; however , due to the lack of carriers , it often could not be delivered . 
  * as far as the navy was concerned , it was penalised by the facts that ** 1 ) ** there was little fuel in the depots , and only part of what had been requisitioned in france was sent to taranto ** 2 ) ** lack of an on-board radar system , something which would only appear in early 1942 with the [ ec .3 / ter ` gufo ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gufo_radar ) and ** 3 ) ** an overly-cautious high command , whose punctilious orders did n't leave any space to naval commanders . 
  * infighting . 
  while rommel had a positive opinion of the italian troops under his command , he had less than kind feelings towards their officers and more often than not there were disagreements beween the two commands . 
  also , the many tactical/strategical blunders by part of the italian high command ( untimely invasion of greece , using tanks on mountainous terrain , etc. . . ) whose members - unlike the germans - had clearly drawn the wrong conclusions from their experiences in the spanish civil war . 
  * lastly , the home front . 
  many italians would have preferred for the country to join the allies ( as it happened in wwi ) rather than the germans and had been suffering from food , clothing and fuel shortages well before the war ; the subsequent rationing made things even worse . 
  a war nobody wanted - in early 1940 victor emmanuel iii himself tried to stage a coup in order to get rid of a more and more war-like mussolini ^ 5 - along an ally the italians did n't trust , against an enemy they did n't want to have , with an unclear goal other than the duce 's delusions of * grandeur * , waged with obsolete weapons or insufficient supplies and under the direction of a mediocre officer corps was clearly not going to be successful . 
   [ ... ] the only victory they had in wwii was against a tiny british garrison in somaliland , and a couple of frogmen who laid mines against the hulls of a few british ships in alexandria . 
  i believe this to be a gross , factually inaccurate - perhaps deliberate ? 
  - understatement of italy 's military history . 
  op should check out the actions of the julia mountain division in the balkan theatre , or the siege of the amba alagi ( 7,000 italians succesfully defending against 39,000 commonwealth troops for a whole month in may 1941 ) , or the battle at the kasserine pass or , the involvement of italian submarines in the atlantic not to mention our air force 's rather significant contributions during operation pedestal as well as the armir 's valiant resistance on the eastern front . 
   [ ... ] could n't the germans have had some sort of military exchange program to toughen them up ? 
  before 1939 both italy and germany were not allied yet , and not much of the german help promised was actually delivered ( i 'm thinking about the request for more aa batteries made to goering in early 1940 ^ 6 ) . 
  as far as the `` toughen 'em up '' part is concerned , the italians were no pushovers - much of their army 's failures can be ascribed to the causes mentioned above , and not to a perceived ` cowardice ' . 
  again , i believe that simply dismissing as ` pathetically inept ' those soldiers who were sent to die by a murderous regime in order to fulfil mussolini 's nebulous plans for a ` new roman empire ' and who , in many cases , exceeded their duty ... to be deeply unjust , and undeserved ; fighting a war with the leadership and kind of equipment they had to rely on is no small feat . 
  also - many of those ` inept cowards ' went on to fight with the italian/greek/yugoslav partisans after 8 septermber 1943 , so labeling them as such is a great disservice . 
  would we consider the men in the julia ( who were literally decimated fighting a winter war the epyrus ) and acqui ( annihilated while resiting the germans at cephalonia ) divisions , or the granatieri ( who fell defending rome against the german advance at the porta s. paolo ) , or even people such as [ salvo d'acquisto ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salvo_d%27acquisto ) to be worthy of being laughed at ? 
  i think not . 
  ** sources **, 
  the oath every new recruit in the * regio esercito * had to take was :, 
  * `` i swear to be loyal to the king and his royal successors , to respect and faithfully observe the statute * [ that 'd be the statuto albertino , italy 's pre-war constitution ] * as well as the other laws of the state , and to fulfil my duties towards the country with no other goal than the good of the king and that of the fatherland , which are one and the same '' * .

  yeah , i agree with your considerations !, 
  also , as for the bravado thing , i believe that notable figures such as gabriele d'annunzio , italo balbo or perhaps even francesco baracca ( that one 's an ace from ww1 ) might have inspired the younger generations in that sense ... d'annunzio in particular was known for its stunts ( such as the flight on vienna ) . 
   [ ... ] and specifically the fiat g. 55 was one of the best in the war [ ... ], 
  actually , i think the re . 
  2001 deserves that honour - it was truly an impressive machine ( and a beautiful one at that ! ) . 
   [ ... ] aside from what you mention previously about general problems with industry and supply , my understanding is that the italian aircraft manufacturers were often unwilling to simplify designs for the exigencies of wartime production , which of course does nothing to help out your already strained industrial capacity . 
  exactly , but these planes often sported licenced versions of the db 601/5 engines ( a.k.a ra 1000 and fiat 1050 ) . 
   [ ... ] and just cause it is one other random fact i can throw in off the top of my head , you talked about the poor training of the army , but this often was nothing compared to the mvsn ( i would assume you already know , but i find it darkly humorous , and others might too ) !, 
  the ` blackshirts ' military units were made up of generally older volunteers . 
  since they had , in theory , completed military service in the past , it was assumed they barely even needed a refresher course - which of course was a terrible decision , and this was reflected in the early combat performance of many of the mvsn units . 
  the mvsn is a curious example because it had so many other uses such as border control , traffic duties , coordination of rescue operations , etc. 
  - it was indeed composed by older recruits of the * regio esercito * , and to give you an example , the italian cities ' aa defences were manned by former artillerymen who applied or were sent to the militia . 
  the via cavour is n't exactly what i 'd consider as a promenade , for it is a steep road connecting the esquiline ( and the train station ) with what was then the alessandrino district , which at the time hid much of the fora - were you referring to via dei fori imperiali ( formerly via dell ` impero ) or via cola di rienzo instead ? 
  ah , ok - i thought you were referring to boulevards in which people could stroll , right ? 
  if so , we can rule out both the aforementioned * via cavour * ( too steep , narrow and connected the new middle-class districts on the esquiline with the rest of the city - in practice little more than a thoroughfare ) , * corso vittorio emanuele * ( too busy , narrow and irregular - it slices the city 's historical centre in two and connected it with the other new districts , such as prati , located beyond the river ) as well as the * viale del re * ( now viale trastevere , connecting that ward ro the homonymous train station ) . 
  all of these - with the exception of * via dell ` impero * and * via della conciliazione * , which are a product of the fascist era - were laid out between 1873 and 1888 as part of a grandiose town planning programme carried out after the capture of rome in 1870 . 
  the new italian government of the time wished to build a ` third rome ' to be opposed to the pre-existing parts of the city , which were deemed unfit for a modern capital ; as for * via nazionale * , its main purpose was to be the home of the new government buildings , and as such it boasts the seats of the ministries of economy , the bank of italy and so on ( hence the name ) . 
  * via cola di rienzo * and the adjacent * via cicerone * were home to the city 's rising burgeoisie ; as such , they had wide pavements and many renowned shops/cafes : but do not confuse them with the * viale delle milizie * or * viale giulio cesare * ... both are big , straight and are located nearby but served a completely different purpose , as they host ( ed ) part of the city 's barracks . 
  a particularity of prati is that the district 's street layout was designed in such a way that you ca n't see st. peter 's dome from below ( as it was built at the height of the ` roman question ' ) . 
   [ ... ] also , what sort of activity ( commercial , ceremonial , etc ) would be taking place along them when they were created [ ... ], 
  not exactly a street , but when * piazza * cavour - the one in front of the palace of justice , that is - was inaugurated in 1895 , both umberto i and the queen attended the ceremony ; an iron box containing giuseppe zanardelli 's ( the then-minister of justice ) speech and a few lire was buried beneath the square 's central monument - it was unearthed in 2012 during the construction of a new underground parking . 
  the only example i can think of right now ( please excuse the shortness of this answer , i 'm on mobile ) are the italian zara-class cruisers , which were designed to outspeed their french counterpart at the expense of their armour ; however , the speed gained was not enough to justify such a design and subsequent additions further slowed these ships down to a performance comparable to that of other similiar vessels .
