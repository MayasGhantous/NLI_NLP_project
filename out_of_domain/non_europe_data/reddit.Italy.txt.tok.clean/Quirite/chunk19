  interesting . 
  here in rome , parades used to take place in * corso umberto i * ( now via del corso ) , as well as the roman carnevale - which was abolished in 1883 . 
  since 1932 , military parades have been held at via dei fori imperiali ... 
  ... which is arguably far more scenic !, 
  gheddafi sotto sotto era una lei ... ? 
  well , it certainly is n't popular with * me * . 
  i find it an annual waste of taxpayers ' money , not to mention a showcase for ` new ' singers who ca n't actually sing or almost-forgotten celebs from the '70s who somehow happen to be still popular in the former urss ( did someone mention al bano ? ) . 
  in other words , a show made by old people for old people ... mark my words , it will probably die of old age !, 
  roman here , born and bred !, 
  i do n't know what 's up with the guy , but he and his ( rather extended ) family seem to be kind of ubiquitous these days ... but then , i do n't care enough about the festival - let alone those people . 
  never heard of that palma guy , either . 
  no , i do n't think so ... also considering the fact that until the 15th century , naples was one of the most prosperous states in italy . 
  but the spanish/bourbon domination of the 16th-18th centuries might have something to with the south 's decline , for many viceroys proved to be rapacious , often corrupt or otherwise incompetent : and they began to levy taxes on pretty much everything . 
  this is why , after the introduction of a very unpopular tax on fruit , revolts broke out in 1647 ( i mean masaniello 's rather famous rebellion ) . 
  the unification was not that beneficial from that pov because northern industries - which were thought would provide as some sort of a ` economic stimulus ' - did n't quite work that way , and the gap between the two entities started to grow ; moreover , the laws of piedmont ( which had replaced those of the pre-unitary states ) brought a fiscal load which was unbearable to most southerners , such as the tax on flour . 
  this caused widespread agitation and revolts , some of which were indeed stirred up and funded by the exiled bourbons . 
  also - unlike their northern and central italian counterparts , southern peasants often did n't own the land they were working at : their landlords did , in a system called * latifundus * ... in which giant swathes of land are property of a few , and mostly absentee , owners belonging to the nobility . 
  that issue was only addressed with the land reforms of 1950/1 ( !, 
  ) , and was actually one of the causes of the rise of fascism ( the * fasci di combattimento * were born as beating squads paid by the landowners to disperse those workers who were reclaiming more land for themselves ) . 
  rome can be quite isolating to other italians , as well ( my southern friends complained about it endlessly ) . 
  i 'm on mobile now , but rome is quite an exception when it comes to gothic architecture - most the buildings in the city have always been ( perhaps unsurprisingly ) inspired by , well , roman architecture and that particular style never really took off here . 
  * santa maria sopra minerva * is the only extant example of that architecture in rome ( the * chiesa del suffragio * on the lungotevere is neo-gothic , as it dates from 1916 ) . 
  my old schoolbook ^ 1 says that this is due to the heavy influence of the pre-existing roman and byzantine architecture ... while there are indeed examples of gothic buildings in the rest of italy , even things such as frescoes were more prevalent than stained glasses - the style was ` diluted ' in order to adapt it to local tastes and needs . 
  so , i too believe it boils down to that but i 'd prefer to wait until a more qualified user than i am checks in . 
  i do n't know if i understood your answer correctly , but the papal states were n't part of the two sicilies . 
  mine are having what i assume to be steamy , loud sex - he 's grunting like a boar , she 's moaning like a cat ( well , sort of ... ) and both are doing an excellent job at keeping me awake . 
  mmmh ... not that i can think of right now . 
  both armellini ^ 1 and hulsen ^ 2 mention quite a lot of destroyed/no longer extant churches , but often do not mention their architectural style . 
  quite a few were pulled down from 1929/32 to 1950 in order to make space for * via dell ` impero * and * via della conciliazione * , but the sources show that these were all baroque re-buildings ( example : [ s. rita da cascia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/s._angelo_-_s._rita_da_cascia.jpg/180px-s._angelo_-_s._rita_da_cascia.jpg ) , which was dismantled and moved to its present location in 1940 ) . 
  as for the second part - there are indeed a few buildings on via del corso or the prati district which sport a simil-gothic design , but these are all 19th-century redesigns . 
  below are some examples :, 
  * the aforementioned [ chiesa del suffragio ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/roma_chiesa_sacro_cuore_del_suffragio.jpg ) from 1916 ;, 
  * the so-called `` casa di dante '' - actually a 19th-century [ redevelopment ] ( http://img2.fotoalbum.virgilio.it/v/www1-3/184/184405/378457/roma2005012_edited-vi.jpg ) of a 11th-century medieval tower ;, 
  * the [ barracks ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_k4-bp9f_tpg/tljr6rqecmi/aaaaaaaaq2o/w7eqnmz9ass/s1600/4+-+via+delle+milizie_dopo+b.jpg ) at viale delle milizie ;, 
  * the [ nazareth ] ( http://www.radiocorriere.tv/lazio/immagini/roma/nazareth/nazareth_1.jpg ) school in via cola di rienzo ;, 
  * the [ marymount ] ( http://www.marymount.it/wp-content/uploads/video-gallery/eventi/thumbs/thumbs_parole.png ) institute on via nomentana ;, 
  * one of the post-1873 [ buildings ] ( https://www.google.it/maps/@41.898331,12.481551,3a,75y,123.3h,111.23t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1soke7gh0blct7oc4z2cocsw!2e0!6m1!1e1 ) on via del corso .

  you 're welcome !, 
  the second one is imho the most likely , seeing how the great council was abolished by royal decree ( with its members ' acquiescence ) that very same day as well as the fact that most of the * gerarchi * soon went into hiding ... something they probably would n't have done if they had the choice or had benefitted from the king 's protection ( something they did n't have ) . 
  and by ` protection ' i really mean ` be allowed to follow him to brindisi ' . 
  just a misunderstanding then ( english is not my first language ) . 
  mussolini wished - actually , ordered - the invasion of greece despite the facts that 1 ) the invading force was ill-equipped and unready 2 ) invading through albania/epyrus , whose terrain would have favoured the defenders even if outnumbered , was a suicidal move and 3 ) greece was ruled by another fascist regime . 
  the invasion started on october 28 , 1940 and it soon turned into a deadly stalemate more reminiscent of the trenches of ww1 . 
  the poorly armed , equipped and * led * italian troops made little progress owing not only yo the greek 's valiant defence but also the freezing climate and the boggy/mountainous terrain ; to add insult to injury , general visconti-prasca had allowed a consistent part of his troops to return before the invasion in order to help with the incoming harvest , and the tanks used proved to be more of an hindrance than anything . 
  by mid-1941 our troops had been almost pushed back to the albanian border , with heavy losses on both parts ; the * julia * alpine division was completely annihilated and it would take the whole german expeditionary force to finally break the stalemate . 
  mussolini was also the one who ordered general graziani to move into egypt , despite him having already set up defensive posts and waiting for reinforcements - as both water , supplies and armament were n't even nearly enough ( or adequate ) to actually sustain an attack ... let alone an invasion . 
  it did n't end well . 
  i do n't know if this is what you 're looking for , but ethiopian irregulars - aided by commonwealth troops - certainly contributed towards bringing an end to the italian colonial regime and in many cases fought against the colonists ' guerrilla ; these were , however , aided by the azeb\u00f2 galla - another people who had a historical enmity with the ethiopians - as well by other ` colonials ' ( eritreans in primis ) . 
  star warts . 
   how long did fascism endure after his death ? 
  it did n't - at least , not officially . 
  mussolini was captured , and then executed on 28 april 1945 : the war in europe would 've ended just a few weeks later . 
  politically , he did n't survive the vote of no-confidence by part of his own grand council on 25 july 1943 and was sacked by the king that very same day ( marshal pietro badoglio was appointed pm in mussolini 's place , then victor emmanuel 's son replaced him as `` lieutenant of the kingdom '' in early 1944 ) . 
  both the fascist militia as well as most laws enacted by the regime were repealed , albeit this had little effect on your average italian . 
  true - mussolini was later freed by the germans only to be put in charge of the italian social republic ( a puppet state exercising nominal control over central/northern italy ) but his regime was propped up by the nazis and it did n't last very long despite the support of many die-hard supporters . 
  by the time of his death , most of italy had already been liberated by the allies with the help of the partisans , and it was pretty much under occupation ; those who associated with him either faded into obscurity - many were never tried - or simply found a new political alignment . 
  after the war , both the fascist party and and its eventual reformation were outlawed , but most of its adherents simply kept quiet ... a few would actually go on to found a number of far-right parties which were fascist in all but name . 
   which system carried on italy after fascism ? 
  italy was a monarchy - actually , it still was one for the whole duration of the regime ( with mussolini being , at least technically , a prime minister ) - but support for the house of savoy had dwindled due to the war and victor emmanuel 's accommodating stance towards fascism . 
  this lead the new king , umberto ii , to indict a much discussed referendum in which many * alleged * irregularities as well as episodes of deliberate suppression of pro-monarchic activity occurred . 
  italy became a republic on june 2 , 1946 , and it 's been one ever since . 
  if by ` last few decades ' you include the '40s , then italy after 1943 would probably fit the description . 
  * the country 's south was controlled by the allies ; the co-belligerant italian army fought along them against the germans as well as the other fellow italians from the r.s.i. . . 
  * mussolini was freed by the germans and then put in charge of the italian social republic , a puppet state with nominal control over the country 's north and centre ; its armed branch had become , after the suppression of the m.v.s.n. 
  ( fascist militia ) , the g.n.r. 
  or * guardia nazionale repubblicana * - whose members , the * repubblichini * , fought against the partisans and the other italians from the co-belligerent army . 
  * the partisans , which were very active in the north and fought against both the germans and the * repubblichini * . 
  so yes - i 'd argue that between 1943 and 1945 , our country was definitely in a state of civil war ,, 
  in 1946 , italy became a republic after a rather controversial referendum which was * allegedly * mirred in irregularities - a number of pro-monarchy rallies were forcibly dispersed both during and after the referendum had taken place ( an example would be the massacre in naples ' via medina , on 11 june 1946 ; protesters were fired upon and there were nine dead ) . 
  the new king , umberto ii , chose not to dispute the referendum 's results and joined the rest of his family in portugal a few days later , so as to avoid further bloodshed . 
  i 've got one too - it 's either an m19 ammobox or one of its many derivatives ... a standard issue in nato armies . 
  wroke havoc in the city centre , damaged and forced nearby shops to close , destroyed a bus , vandalised an antique clock in the villa borghese as well as bernini 's fountain ( near the spanish steps ) , which had just been restored . 
   young guys go abroad, 
  half of them look in their '40s ... 
  ... says the keyboard warrior . 
  italian here - it 's a mixed bag , really . 
  * on one hand he was the guy who brought the revolution to the peninsula , introduced the code napoleon , contributed to foster consensus towards a more modern governance of the various states and helped kick-start the unification process ;, 
  * on the other - he stole countless artifacts from palaces and churches around italy , only returned part of them after long negotiations and what is worse , he ceded venetia , istria and dalmatia to the austrians by signing the treaty of campoformio in 1797 ... something which , to this day , is still regarded as an act of ` treason ' . 
  schoolboks portray him in a rather neutral ( and slightly boring ) fashion , and the whole napoleonic wars are synthetised in little more than an overview . 
  no streets or squares are named after him but one of his descendants , napoleon iii , is much more favourably remembered and does indeed have a few places named in his honour - albeit he too is not immune from controversy ( was it really necessary to cede the county of nice ? 
  i agree , but the very fact that he was the one who attacked venice and then gave it away is not viewed favourably . 
  now now , let 's not exaggerate ( i 'm roman and i had to test an ambulance 's readiness myself , unfortunately ) . 
  * we definitely are not afraid to , and ... 
  * we definitely are one such society . 
  actually , little less than 12 % of rome 's economy is tied to tourism and most of the people we get here are stop-and-go daytrippers who spend just a few days in the city and are unlikely to return again . 
  therefore , i see no reason for the other guy to apologise and offer that dude a coffee ... 
  no , i think we understand violence * all too well * instead - do n't be deceived by the appearances and keep in mind that until the early '90s we were used to see attempted coups-d'\u00e9tat ( 1964 and 1970 ) , terrorists/rogue secret services/mafia bombers blowing shit up all around the country ( 1969 , 1970 , 1980 , 1984 , 1985 , 1992 , 1993 ) or even going insofar as to kidnap and kill the prime minister ( 1978 ) . 
  crime here is generally non-violent , true , but such a thing definitely does n't make us * that * naive ... 
  ... both we , as citizens , and the law-enforcement have been through some batshit crazy stuff before . 
  siesta is actually a spanish thing ... 
  ... what foreigners mistake as one really is lunch break , and employers generally give us no more than an hour to eat . 
  well - but there was no reason for him to tell every single one of us off , either ... 
  do n't worry !, 
  it depends on where you are , but you can consider yourself lucky if your employer gives you a * whole * hour to heat ... we only got 45 minutes and then had to be back to work . 
  i 'm from rome and this is pretty much the case in big cities - of course a farmer or a shop located in a small , remote village have more free time on their hands . 
  i just did , have a good evening as well !, 
   [ ... ] the allies ( twice ) [ ... ], 
  actually , the allies only liberated rome * once * - in june 1944 .
