  i think you have a point here . 
  so ... at the very least that does n't seem to be illegal , huh ? 
  that 's good news , you just got one more problem off my chest !, 
  thanks !, 
  okay , let me explain the whole shebang more in depth . 
  my grandma has a sister ; said sister has a son ; this son has got another son , whose daughter is my crush . 
  clear as mud , i know . 
  ** edit ** : sorry guys - i was n't able to give you a clearer picture before , i 'm still struggling with english ( and with my feelings ) !, 
  please be patient and bear with me . 
  i 've also double-checked the whole tree now ... 
  all righty then . 
  i 've also checked both our civil code and canonical law ( i 'm catholic , just in case ) ... there does n't seem to be any known impediment and everything seems to be better than i thought at first . 
   i 'm not dr phil but ... i also in a side note think two consenting adults having sex should not be anyones buisness . 
  why should it nit be accepted ? 
  if you both want it why not ? 
  i would just make sure if it gets serious you take into considrrations laws and issues that could come about if she gets pregnant . 
  amen to that !, 
  that 's some sound advice . 
  okay folks , i think i 've come to a conclusion -- i 'm going for it . 
  i decided that if everything goes as it should then i 'll be telling our friends but not ( at least for the time being ) our family . 
  i feel i ca n't lose her ... 
  i do n't want to . 
  it 's now or never . 
  thank you all for the support !, 
  you guys are the best . 
  will . 
  deliver . 
  promised !, 
   is there anyone you trust in the family you could broach this to first to test the waters and see how it 's received ? 
  nope , at the moment i ca n't think of anybody . 
   and have you talked to the girl about this ? 
  i plan on doing this as soon as possible . 
  yes , but ... no , if compared with other european countries such as france or germany . 
  italy has ` only ' got + / - 700,000 - 1,200,000 muslims ( estimates vary wildly ) , most of whom are recent immigrants . 
  i 'm a former accounting intern ( i 'm 22 ) and this is one of my days :, 
  * morning *, 
  * ** 7:00 ** - i wake up , shower , have nothing for breakfast ( it only makes things worse ) , get dressed . 
  * ** 7:50 ** - have to run to the train station ;, 
  * ** 8:07 ** - train is late as usual ; everybody on the platform starts cursing trenitalia . 
  * ** 8:28 ** - train arrives , is full of other commuters ; i manage to get in . 
  * ** 8:35 ** - train arrives at its destination , the dreary roma ostiense railway station ; i get off and run towards the underpass before the angry commuter mob has a chance to clog its entrance . 
  * ** 8:40 ** - i get at the `` piramide '' metro stop ; line b sucks as usual and trains seem to run only in the other direction . 
  i am on auto-pilot now - my legs are getting the test of my body to the office by themselves while my mind is left free to wander the neverending realms of fantasy ... 
  * ** 8:45 ** - i 'm still waiting ; people start cursing atac and all of our mayors present and past when the metro train finally arrives , but is jam-packed and nobody seems to get off ; i push and shove , manage to get in and the doors can close . 
  no room to move or even extend my arms . 
  no a/c either ( metro trains are old ) . 
  * ** 9:00 ** - i ca n't take it anymore but everyone suddenly gets off at `` termini '' . 
  good riddance , i can breathe again . 
  i get off at the next stop . 
  * ** 9:05 ** - i 'm terribly late , and make a dash for the office . 
  the damn lifts are too few , too slow and too small . 
  one of them is out of order . 
  the queue is long . 
  * at the office *, 
  * ** 9:10 ** - unhelpful desk lady does n't give a shit , i refuse to give a shit too and none of us greets the other . 
  my coworkers are n't there yet ( likely still stuck in traffic ) so i enter our room , turn on their computers and go to the loo 'cause i really need to relieve myself . 
  everybody arrives a couple of minutes later , greet me then migrate on the balcony for a cigarette . 
  they 'll thank me later ... wait , no , they wo n't . 
  * ** 9:15 ** - i get back at my workspace and start checking the e-mails ; after that , i boot the maleficent - and probably self-aware - programme we 're using . 
  only then i proceed to take one of the ( many , many ) file folders located on the ( many , many , many ) shelves around the room , open it and start punching all the damn invoices it contains into the database ; the aforementioned programme looks like a leftover from the '90s , it sucks donkey balls and i suspect it is actively conspiring in order to get me fired . 
  after i 'm finished registering each invoice i have to put it back into the folder and write a record number on it with my red pen of evil . 
  * ** 10:00 ** - first customer calls of the day : most belong to of the `` wrong number , this is the accounting department '' , `` my colleague is on holiday '' or `` no , we are not a travel agency '' genre . 
  * ** 10:45 ** - me and another colleague of mine are the only people in our office who speak decent english so the burden of soliciting our british partners for payment falls upon us yet again . 
  ** fun trivia ** : the first time i had to make a call abroad i was rather nervous and really did n't want to do that - i had never spoken to a british person before and was afraid they 'd laugh at me , which is exactly what happened . 
  the person at the other end of the phone spoke with a thick accent from somewhere up north so i found myself unable to understand much of what she said apart from the word `` meeting '' . 
  i started stuttering like an idiot , then got so embarrassed that i just told her to `` pay at once before this weekend , meeting or no meeting ! '', 
  then hung up . 
  * ** 11:12 ** - colleague a is desperate because she 's just opened a . zip attachment she should have ignored . 
  i 'm among the first on the scene however , i ca n't do nothing but take note of the fact that months of work are now gone forever . 
  cryptolocker striked again . 
  ten minutes later colleague b is in dire need of help because of a bug in the shitty programme we 're using but will soon discover just how useless our it department can be . 
  * ** 11:30 ** - i 'm on the brink of losing my sanity so i get up and go buy some unhealthy snack at the vending machine in the corridor ; i already know i will regret it this evening . 
  i get back to my workstation and start punching data into the system until 1 pm . 
  mail ( as in : old-fashioned mail ) arrives , and they 're bringing loads of it . 
  * ** 12:00 ** - some of the guys working at our spanish branch do n't have a clue about proper accounting ( or even basic math , for that matter ) therefore at least 2/5 of the invoices they send us has to be sent back . 
  my supervisor loses her patience and starts throwing a fit at them via phone , accusing them of behaving `` like there 's no tax police in spain '' . 
  * ** 12:31 ** - a colleague of mine with particularly bad bo sits near me and i feel like i have to gag . 
  * ** 13:00 ** / ** 14:00 ** - thank god it 's lunch break !, 
  * ** 14:05 ** - i begin opening the envelopes ; they contain hotel/restaurant invoices , which i must divide by month . 
  once all of them have been opened and every invoice sorted out ( these form two piles which take up almost all the space available on my desk ) i ` only ' have to put them into the appropriate file folders . 
  the process can take up to three hours because i have to do everything by hand ; i 'll also need two rubbish bins , which at the end of the day will likely be overflowing . 
  * ** 17:00 ** - geez , i 'm tired . 
  my boss 's tax consultant arrives , starts questioning me and my colleagues on pretty much everything that has happened today . 
  the guy 's a chatterbox . 
  * ** 17:40 ** - why do bosses always arrive when you 're about to leave ? 
  is it in their dna ? 
  anyway , he pops in so that we can all admire his smug face and laugh at his childish jokes . 
  my supervisor saves the day and brings his tax-evading arse on an inspection tour of the office . 
  * ** 17:59 ** - i 'm already out of there . 
  i 'm tired , wasted and will take a bus home . 
  no happy hour for me , sorry !, 
   not even the vast majority of italians are able speak it fluently, 
  do we live in the same country ? 
  expect lots of condos in big cities . 
  we 're both on vacation . 
  i shall meet her on the 27th , when we will be back to rome ( mutual friend 's birthday ) . 
  will let you know what happens , but until then ... 
  indeed , here i am and ready to deliver !, 
  and i 'm still shaking a little bit as i 'm writing this , everything happened so quickly ... 
  yesterday , august the 27th , i went at our friend 's birthday - nothing special , just the few of us at the restaurant enjoying our pizzas - but it was clear from her last phone call that she would have liked us guys dressed decently and not like the lazy slobs we are .
