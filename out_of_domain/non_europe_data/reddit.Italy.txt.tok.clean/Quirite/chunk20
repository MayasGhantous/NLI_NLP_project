  we 've actually * won * that war 's prequel so there would 've been little reason for them to invade us , unless they wanted the germans to win or owed the kaiser a favour . 
   [ ... ] multiple caliphates ( if memory serves ) [ ... ], 
  not quite . 
  arab * pirates * tried to besiege rome ... once , in 846 a.d. 
  did n't succeed . 
  they had just finished ransacking st. peter 's ( which at the time lied outside the walls ) when their fleet was destroyed by that of the counts of tusculum during the battle of ostia , which took place a few days later . 
  slaves were n't necessarily made to reproduce , and most just died working in the mines or the latifundia . 
  italian here ... do n't even know how i got there in the first place , but i think i might shed some light on the vote . 
   what about recognizing independence for venice , as the venetians wish ? 
  the pro-independence ` referendum ' you might have heard of was actually little more than a sham ( an online poll , that is ) in which most votes came from very venetian places such as germany or parauguay . 
  actually , the whole independence thing is overblown - not to mention widely mocked over here ; moreover , the * real * dispute behind all this is that many venetians would like fiscal autonomy for their region , the same way as their neighbouring regions - veneto is indeed one of the richest and most productive regions of the country . 
  i should also point out that the very ( in ? 
  ) opportune timing of such a decision - and i 'm referring to the vote on whether to recognise or not palestine as a nation - has probably far more to do with the situation in libya , and a possible italian intervention there , than any of our politicians actually caring about the issue in question ... something i feel we should n't be putting our nose in . 
  at the * very * least not yet . 
  but , hey , these guys do n't even care about their own country !, 
  and the brouhaha such a decision will bring with itself can - and most certainly will - provide plenty of distraction from this country 's more urgent matters , which are * so * not being addressed as of right now . 
  in the end , i believe it all boils down to ** 1 ) ** a delusional , and highly incoherent , foreign policy ** 2 ) ** embarrassing levels of diplomatical na\u00efvet\u00e9 ** 3 ) ** purely ideological motivations , as it was sel - a supposedly-more-leftist-party-than-the-one-currently-in-power - which proposed such a vote . 
  but not in the coronaries , i believe . 
  well , italy 's most recent changes to its nw border are n't so much the result of peaceful negotiations . 
  to begin with , both savoy and the county of nice had been annexed by france after the agreements of plombi\u00e8res had been signed in 1860 ; italy then occupied those regions from 1940/3 , but after the war it was made to cede a relatively smallish part of its territory ( the villages of briga marittima and tenda , the roia valley as well as parts of neighbouring * comuni * ) with the 1947 treaty of paris . 
  however - france ( or , better , de gaulle ) also claimed the valle d'aosta , bits of piedmont and the town of ventimiglia as war reparations , but was stopped short by the other western allies who felt that italy had been punished enough with the loss of much of its north-eastern terrirories . 
  borders have stayed the same since then , the only point of contention being mt. 
  blanc 's summit - an issue neither government seems to care much about . 
  penso che a tutti piacerebbe pagare il dovuto ma lo stato , quando deve farlo , \u00e8 il primo a latitare ; quando si vogliono fare le cose fatte bene \u00e8 sempre pronto a metterlo al culo , e anche le poche volte che \u00e8 disposto a supportare un ` impresa fa di tutto per renderti la vita difficile ( fondi europei per l'apprendistato , anyone ? ) . 
   [ ... ] hai un idea e vuoi commercializzarla ? 
  my answer is not exactly about peasants , but in medieval and early modern rome it was n't uncommon to spoil ancient ruins of their marbles/stone so as to reuse them somewhere else . 
  there was an entire road - today 's * via delle fornaci * - which was lined up with ovens where countless statues , inscriptions and whatnot were baked in order to get mortar ( hence the name ) . 
  also , many houses and shops were built inside the ruins or relied on pre-existing structures for architectural support , think of the fora or the theatre of marcellus ; but even the pantheon 's colonnade was encroached by small houses until the 15th century !, 
  noblemen , on the other hand ... did the exact same thing , and families such as the frangipane or the contis turned many ancient structures ( such as hadrian 's mausoleum or part of the homonymous markets ) into fortresses . 
   [ ... ] just not sure how they got rome, 
  in 1860 , with the risorgimento in full swing , many in the territories belonging to the papal states revolted and formed the united provinces of central italy - piedmontese troops then moved in support of the rebellion and defeated the papal army at the battle of castelfidardo * but * napoleon iii did n't allow them to capture latium and with that , rome . 
  the united provinces were then annexed by means of a plebiscite . 
  the p.s. 
  soon found themselves encroached on three sides by italy , and were left in control of most of what is today 's latium . 
  a french garrison guaranteed the states ' inviolability and sovereignty but the italian government never ceased to consider rome as the country 's sole rightful capital ; in 1865 , it was moved to florence in order to put pressure on both france and the pope . 
  in 1867 garibaldi led an ill-fated expedition which was stopped short at mentana ( near the border ) by italian troops , as the government feared that it would lead to a war with france . 
  by 1870 , however , things had changed - france was now too busy fighting a war on its own soil and had to recall its garrison ; the italians took advantage of this break in order to assault rome and capture it on september 20 . 
  the city was officially declared capital of the new kingdom on 3 february , 1871 . 
  this is debatable because for many , venetia did not quite represent the easternmost point of the new italian nation : nearby istria and dalmatia - which had been venetian provinces for centuries , were ( and in part still are ) populated by ethnic italian populations in addition to croats and slovenes but had been part of austria since 1797 - did . 
  i agree that this sub does n't like generalisations , and that of the italians being ineffective was n't always the case - i would say that italian military history is just more checkered than ananything , and the fact that many historians like to perpetuate old notions and trite stereotypes does n't help , either . 
  to give you an example , the 18th century saw its fair share of great military leaders and yes , victories ... just think of figures like eugenio di savoia or victorious engagements such as the battle of assietta . 
  you will understand thand that the reasons ca n't be ascribed to the old notions `` italians ca n't fight '' . 
   [ ... ] maybe / u/quirite [ 1 ] [ +81 ] can though . 
  i 'll do my best ... 
  another problem with the new-born royal italian army can almost certainly be ascribed to the vast differences between soldiers and their ** officers ** ... something that would influence the army 's performance both in ww1 and ww2 . 
  military academies were oriented towards , and sometimes almost an exclusive privilege of , the higher classes - meaning that you 've got lots of relatively unprepared - many times even illiterate - draftees serving along ambitious officers with whom they had little to nothing in common . 
  and these very officers were often mediocre themselves . 
  a point of debate , apart from the poor quality of training , was that of the army 's ** procurement ** system ... which was at times definitely dysfunctional . 
  the country 's limited ( at the time ) degree of industrialisation meant that its factories could n't always meet the army 's needs and more often than not contractors would have been chosen not because of their merits , but because of their relationship with the court . 
  this was all more evident during the interbellum years , where the producion of planes such as the infamous ba . 
  88 was kept rolling just because the board of particular factory had good ties with both general badoglio and the king . 
  other reasons include a ** lack of co-ordination ** between the various branches of the army , meaning that they were often in competition yet had to rely on each other . 
  for example , the * regia marina * was forbidden to fly its own aircrafts except for reconnaissance purposes ( `` that 's stuff for the air force !, 
  '' , mussolini decreed ... well , not quite but you get the idea for a very specific set of laws was enacted favouring the af ) and had to rely on the * regia aeronautica * for air cover , something it often could not provide due to the lack of carriers . 
  and calling for help was a farraginous procedure , too , with the captain having to contact the fleet 's command ( supermarina ) first , which would then relay said request to the air force ; due to this , help often came too late ... or sometimes it did n't come at all . 
  ** orders ** from the ( overly-cautious ) high command had to be followed to the letter , and did n't leave any space for individual initiative . 
  for an in-depth overview , check this [ old answer of mine ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2vp9s4/why_was_the_italian_army_so_pathetically_inept/cok4xz0 ) and please excuse the shortness of this one - i am on mobile !, 
  as far as i know , italian factories did n't choose either method . 
  tank hulls were mostly * riveted * simply because of practical reasons - this method was easier , given the limited equipment available , and also considerably faster ; factories , because of the country 's limited degree of industrialisation , were struggling to meet the army 's demands and had to cut corners in order to deliver more equipment . 
  of course , such armours were often way too thin not to mention prone to cracking , as the men of the ariete division found out by themselves ... 
  to begin with ... the kings of piedmont did n't even speak the piedmontese dialect , but french ; this was a common occurrence until the 19th-century , and it was only with the proclamation of the new kingdom of italy that the language lost its status at court , for fairly obvious reasons . 
  second , tuscan had long become the language of the various pre-unitary states ' cultural elites , which used it in their works as well as in their correspondence ; moreover - poets such as dante , petrarca and boccaccio had an enormous influence over their contemporaries and with tuscany eventually becoming the birthplace of humanism , its dialect started being regarded as prestigious . 
  such a status was already recognised in the late 15th/16th centuries , when the various intellectuals debated on which variety of tuscan could be considered the purest and suitable for writing !, 
  alessandro manzoni published * the betrothed * - one of the first books to have a pan-italian resonance - in 1842 , and had a decisive role in steering the debate on the country 's official language in favour of the variant of florentine he had used in his work ... something which formed the basis of modern italian . 
  and in 1859 , piedmont was the first state to made education compulsory ( * legge casati * ) , whose pupils were taught in that language . 
  of course , tuscan 's dominance was favoured by the fact of it being the most understandable among the dialects . 
  as far as the italian colonies are concerned , no , this did not happen - also because of the racial laws of 1938 , despite their enforcement being quite problematic in east africa ( libya was under tighter control than the other colonies , since it was to italy what algeria was for the french - sort of a metropolitan possession , albeit not to the same degree ) . 
  therefore , sexual relations between persons of different ethnic backgrounds definitely were n't uncommon in the east african colonies ( and , to a certain degree , libya ) but they were more like what we would consider today as concubinage ; after the war , some of the colonists that had chosen to stay eventually intermarried with the locals . 
  as for the nobility itself , italian families were - i 'm trying to answer at the best of my knowledge - quite conscious of their status and certainly would n't have allowed such unions to take place , given that time 's standards . 
  hell , even marriage among people of different societal classes was frowned upon , so such a thing would 've been unlikely . 
  it did n't , at least not in 17th-century rome . 
  the little lighting available was provided by the * madonnelle * , small [ shrines ] ( http://media.tumblr.com/a32f8d82c1cf2cebc76832ceae5de635/tumblr_inline_mwbippyrqf1rm4rgb.jpg ) dedicated to the virgin mary ( hence the name ) which were located on a buildings ' fa\u00e7ade , often at an [ intersection ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3jxhffhcfxy/t7nldshgdki/aaaaaaaaaxy/c3refnflsfi/s1600/rm_861.jpg ) ; these were under the care of religious organisations , the noble family who owned the palace in question or the shopkeepers who could afford their upkeep and who , in most cases , had paid for them . 
  despite the presence of such shrines , most streets in town were unlit and thus extremely dangerous . 
  hey , a good video * and * a historically accurate one at that !, 
  i like it . 
  why should have we ? 
  apart from its pretty nihil strategic importance , san marino 's pro-fascist government had excellent relations with that of italy 's both before and during the war , and as such it was not regarded as a threat . 
  and if there is a strip of land that not even irredentists wanted to touch , that 'd be san marino ( see below ) . 
  the state does indeed owe its continued existence to the fact that it offered shelter to garibaldi in the early 1860s and because of that , it was allowed to exist independently as a token of gratitude . 
  however , the germans did really ... well , invade it so as to pass through it in 1944 during their retreat to the north and it was bombed quite a few times . 
  la germania , invece ... 
  yes , the yellow hue you can see ( which i know under the name of * fioritura * - do n't know how its called in english though ) is mostly due to the chemical changes a sheet undergoes with the passage of time . 
  what 's interesting is that the more modern kinds of paper , due to their generally more acidic composition , are less able to withstand it than those in use before the 19th century ; i 'd be surprised if the thing we 've got today could last some hundred years !, 
  it is possible to slow down - albeit only partially - these processes by using a very simple preparation made of flour paste and potash alum when restoring a book 's binding ; such a kind of glue has , among the other things , some ( admittedly rather mild ) anti-bacterial properties but can also protect the volume in question from bookworms . 
  just my two pence . 
  well , the fascist party ( and even mussolini himself ... ) was not anti-semitic for a good portion of its history , even if this clearly changed when closer ties with germany were established and the racial laws enacted in 1938 . 
  but even then , there was no deportation of jews until september 1943 ( italy 's capitulation ) and the subsequent german occupation . 
  as far as dissidents are concerned , the fascist regime preferred to imprison and then sentence to death those on its home soil ; the ones living abroad may have been the targets of an assassination attempt instead of a total military invasion of the country they were in . 
  besides , keep in mind that san marino too was - until 1944 - ruled by another fascist party , whom mussolini had good relations with so these very dissidents , while not openly attacked , might not have had an easy stay there or may have chosen to avoid the country altogether . 
  and the duce knew that . 
  so no ... hunting dissidents was n't a reason valid enough to invade it . 
   the locals we encountered were overwhelmingly incredibly mean . 
  never care to go back . 
  chances are that the locals you met were n't even romans ... 
  sorry to disappont you , but i was born , live in rome and never did - let alone witness - such a thing in 22 years of my life . 
  go south and things may get a little bit different , but it 's not like every single male there is out to get you . 
   the ethiopians resisted the invasion until the italians started to use chemical warfare agents like mustard gas, 
   in june 1936 , king haile selassie i appealed to the league of nations to take action against the invasion . 
  but it was ignored . 
   on may 21 , 1937 , in rome , italy was celebrating its fourth anniversary of the proclamation of the italian empire .
