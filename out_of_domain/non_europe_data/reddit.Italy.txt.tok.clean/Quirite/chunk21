  naaah , just southerners . 
  the roll of toilet paper adds that classy touch ... 
  i believe you are referring to the racial laws of 1938 , which were indeed enacted as part of a policy of approachment to germany after sanctions had been imposed by the league of nations following italy 's invasion of ethiopia . 
  while the fascist party itself was n't openly anti-semitic prior to that date - and mussolini 's attitude towards jews was very much unclear and ambivalent - the more anti-semitic strains of the party had already been pushing for such a thing as far as 1933 and these laws ( as well as the * manifesto of race * ) were enacted with relatively little opposition . 
  albeit not every jew was equal - `` aryanised jews '' , that is to say someone who in germany would have been considered a * mischling * - were allowed relative freedom even if in the end , they shared much of the same restrictions other jews faced . 
  what made some jews more `` aryan '' than others , you might ask ? 
  a sentence of a particular commission established by the ministry of the interior , here 's what . 
  below are the more obvious impositions these people had to face :, 
  * marriage and sexual relations between `` aryans '' and `` non-aryans '' were to be forbidden . 
  * `` aryan '' shopkeepers were mandated to put a [ sticker ] ( http://www.lanaturadellecose.it/files/media/immagini/guido/negozioarianoweb.jpg ) in order to certify that theirs was truly `` an aryan shop '' , whatever that might have meant ( you are n't expecting fascist legislation to make any sense , are you op ? ) . 
  * `` non-aryans '' ( which in this context really is just another word for ` jews ' ) could not attend public schools but those reserved to them , while being barred from attending universities - same thing for the jewish teachers . 
  * jews were barred from joining the party , the army ( war veterans were forced to retire ) and the p.a. 
  * jews could not work as domestic helpers in `` aryan '' families , and viceversa . 
  however , it should be pointed out that the enforcement of these laws was quite lax outside of italy , with most colonies ( libya being a partial exception as it was more tightly controlled than east africa ) proving to be a difficult environment in which to intervene , also given the state 's limited resources and byzantine legislation . 
  as far as the influence nazi germany exercised on italy in matters of race , i would be inclined to say that it just provided an occasion to unleash those anti-semitic sentiments that had been building up for some years in the higher cadres of the fascist party and some strata of the italian society . 
  so yes ... * many of us had been willing accomplices of the nazi regime and co-operated with it * , if that 's what you wanted to ask . 
  even though there would n't be any deportation of jews until italy 's capitulation in 1943 - after which what was left of the regime was more than glad to openly aid the nazis by sending italian jews/dissents/partisans to the camps . 
   [ ... ] i have heard that there where some jewish members of the italian fascist party who had to leave the party because germany pushed nazi racial politics on italy . 
  is this true ? 
  sure , there were many people such as aldo finzi ( one-time undersecretary of the interior as well as one of d'annunzio 's closest companions during the so-called `` regency of the carnaro '' ) who had to resign from the party . 
   [ ... ] and what other effects did german nazism have on italian fascism ? 
  there was a whole kind of nazi imagery mussolini fell in love with , such as the goose step , which he saw fit to import and impose to an army he was despised in ; and what 's more important , he began to be convinced of germany 's military might and invincibility - something which would lead our country towards war and its ultimate ruin . 
   i suppose i thought that italy was more moderate on enforcing these regulations than nazi germany was [ ... ], 
  well , the fascist regime * really * was more lax and - to a certain degree - much more tolerant , compared to its german counterpart . 
  but mine was just a sarcastic remark and humour usually does n't translate well on the internet ... 
   [ ... ] i was unaware of the italian army 's dislike of mussolini . 
  what was the relationship between the army and the state like in fascist italy ? 
  well , i need to expand the power dynamics of fascist italy first , because they were n't as simple as they might look . 
  to begin with - unlike ( probably , i am not an expert ... ) hitler or stalin mussolini never had the complete control of the country in the first place , seeing that he was still in fact just a prime minister subordinate to his king ; even though the balance of power between them had gradually become more and more precarious over the years . 
  we know that * the duce * himself would ultimately have gotten rid of the monarchy one way or another ; v. e. iii knew that and in march 1940 he organised a counter-coup ^ ** 1 ** ( which did n't get through ) in order to sack mussolini and replace him with a more loyal - not to mention less warlike - galeazzo ciano . 
  however , he would 've needed the council 's acquiescence in order to replace mussolini who , in turn , would have had to rely on that very same council 's consent so as to proceed with the king 's deposition . 
  any move in favour of one or the other could have resulted in civil war and the * gerarchi * did not support either party ... 
  ... at least not until july 1943 , when both the king and the council wanted mussolini 's head and wasted no time to oust him . 
  you can very well imagine just how tense and uneasy their collaboration was , but that 's not all . 
  mussolini had some kind of leverage to threaten the king with - namely the fascist militias ( mvsn ) , the council and ( almost ) the entire party ; on the other hand the army , the navy and other branches such as the * carabinieri * had sworn fealty to him and not to the * duce * . 
  on top of it all , many among the officers and their soldiers resented the party 's rather nosy attitude and still looked over to the king as the sole ultimate authority . 
  indeed , the oath every new recruit in the regio esercito had to take recited :, 
  * `` i swear to be loyal to the king and his royal successors , to respect and faithfully observe the statute * [ that 'd be the statuto albertino , italy 's pre-war constitution ] * as well as the other laws of the state , and to fulfil my duties towards the country with no other goal than the good of the king and that of the fatherland , which are one and the same '' . 
  no mention of the glorious leader , and for a good reason : victor emmanuel was still the commander-in-chief of the kingdom 's armed forces , and mussolini 's attempts to expand his influence there were not successful . 
  and when the empire was proclaimed in 1936 , he later appointed himself `` first marshal of the empire '' ... but so was the king !,

  erm ... both photos portray the same building , just from different povs !, 
  the one from ww2 depicts [ the place 's `` rear '' ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/colosseo_-_panoramica_-_scuba_beer.jpg ) , if we can call it such , while the other one is clearly the [ fa\u00e7ade ] ( http://www.skylinewebcams.com/it/webcam/italia/lazio/roma/colosseo.html ) you can see from via dei fori imperiali . 
  apart from the ongoing scrubbing and replacement of the old , make-shift enclosures with new ones , the building 's changed very little in the last 80/couple hundred years - the only interventions of some relevance being giuseppe valadier 's consolidation of the monument 's outer ring ( or what was left of it ) in the early 19th century and the excavation of its underground in the 1930s . 
   [ ... ] it was probably because italian courts use the napoleonic code . 
  the napoleonic code ? 
  seriously ? 
  dude ... we - and by `` we '' i really mean the kingdom of piedmont , italy 's predecessor state - have n't been using that code since 1815 !, 
  and even if we still did , nowhere does it say that a defendant is `` guilty until proven innocent '' . 
   [ ... ] you are guilty until proven innocent, 
  again , this is utter bs - our very constitution affirms that `` a defendant shall be considered not guilty until a final sentence has been passed '' ( art . 
  so no , i am quite certain that this is definitely not the case ... 
  can you believe it ? 
  i too am having a hard time looking for any kind of gun law from before 1931 - i have searched both the civil code of 1889 as well as the civil one from 1865 , but with no luck . 
  ~ ~ i believe that the possession of any kind of gun was regulated by dedicated * regi decreti * ( royal decrees ) but the number of these is is simply enormous and not even i know where to start the research . ~ ~ will post again if i can find something out , in the meanwhile ... 
   [ ... ] my question is how feasible it would be , realistically , for them to bring their weapons into the country and carry them , concealed or otherwise . 
  the year is 1929 and , if relevant , they 're making the journey by rail . 
  not much , given the fact that the fascist paramilitary militia ( mvsn ) covered multiple roles ranging the gamut from highway patrol to the co-ordination of rescue vehicles to , well , border control . 
  as far as trains are concerned , these people would have probably boarded the cars at some point in order to check the passengers ' ids - i do n't think they 'd have tolerated any kind of weapon on a foreigner , let alone a concealed stash of guns . 
  but it would n't be unreasonable to think that these could have escaped a close inspection somehow ... 
   [ ... ] the earliest relevant law i can find reference to is the public safety act of 1931 [ ... ], 
  fyi that would be the penal code of 1931 , which - believe it or not - is still in force in today 's italy . 
  albeit with many , many , * many * modifications and after being thoroughly ` defascistified ' . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  btw , seems like i have found something at last . 
  while the sale to customers of guns ` and other instruments ' was n't regulated by laws of the kingdom other than the requirement for the buyer to have a specific licence issued by the local * questura * , there were indeed some relatively strict sanctions for those who did n't follow the rules . 
  let 's see what the penal code of 1889 has to say on the matter ... 
  * book iii , title ii , chapter i , art . 
   * `` whoever , without having informed the authorities , * [ that 'd the * questore * , your local police commissioner ] ( ... ) * introduces within the kingdom a quantity of weapons far exceeding one 's necessities shall be punished with arrest and detention up to three months , or a fine equal to \u20a4 50.000 . 
  * art . 
   * `` whoever [ ... ] sells any kind of weapon without the authorities ' permission , shall be punished with arrest and detention for not less than six months [ ... ] '' *, 
  * art . 
   * `` whoever , without the autorities ' permission , introduces [ ... ] within the kingdom gunpowder or other explosive substances shall be punished with arrest and detention up to three months and a fine up to to \u20a4 500 . 
  * art . 
   * `` whoever carries weapons for which a licence is needed without the authorities ' permission and in places other than the person ( s ) ' own domicile , shall be punished with detention up to a month or a fine up to \u20a4 200 . 
   * the offender ( s ) shall be punished with detention ranging from a month up to a year if : *, 
   * 1 ) the weapon 's considered `` insidious '' * [ that definition included pocket knives , batons and concealable guns ! ], 
   * the offender ( s ) shall be punished with detention up to four months if : *, 
   * 2 ) the weapon in question is a gun or a revolver . 
  * art . 
   * `` the penalties described in the previous articles will be raised in the following cases : *, 
   * 1 ) by a third , if the weapon in question is brought to a public meeting place [ ... ] '' *, 
  so op , there are other articles in case your characters want to blow something up !, 
  let me know if you 're interested ... 
  either way , the fascists would 've probably had it their way with your characters considering that they were foreigners and thus possible spies ; i would be surprised if all they got coming was a fine . 
  there were laws , true , but do not forget that the regime only stuck to them if it would have been convenient enough for it to do so ... 
   [ ... ] will the italian people make the grave mistake of allowing this group of brits and americans to bumble around the country with deadly weapons in tow ? 
  methinks not . 
  well , the fact that one of them happens to be a member of the pnf and is probably acting under mussolini 's direct orders changes things a lil ' wee bit , does n't it ? 
  anyhoo - do not forget to tell me how everything went , for you 've got me interested ( yeah , you talkin ' with another avid hpl fan ! ) . 
  ... and feel free to ask , should you need assistance with other italy-related topics . 
  got it !, 
  glad of having been of service . 
  i love gold so much that i even lost my genitalia in an unfortunate schmelting accident ... 
  here 's a few books in case you 're interested in the war as seen from an italian point of view :, 
  * mario rigoni stern 's * the sergeant in the snow * , as well as, 
  * giulio bedeschi 's * centomila gavette di ghiaccio * - both recall the authors ' survival on the russian front . 
  * j.j. sadkovich 's * the italian navy in ww2 * gives a balanced overlook on a relatively-obscure topic . 
  i found london so incredibly underwhelming ... at the end of the trip i just thought `` is that all ?
