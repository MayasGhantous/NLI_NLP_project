  really ? 
  yeah , somehow it was not foreign enough to result interesting . 
   with a population of around 7 million [ ... ], 
  to be fair - there are actually ` just ' 2.7 million of us , but the city 's historical centre is relatively small and can be easily toured by foot ... provided that you 've got some stamina . 
  otherwise , i 'm pretty sure the buses/trams will do . 
   [ ... ] are the subway systems fairly easy [ ... ], 
  rome 's got three-and-a-half lines , one of which does n't even reach the centre ( yet ) . 
  you could n't get lost ... not even if you wanted to . 
   [ ... ] i think it 's time based ( for the bus at least ) . 
  yes , that ticket - the b.i.t. 
  - lasts 100 minutes from the moment you validate it . 
  and it 's valid for every means of public transportation ... 
  just a couple of notes :, 
   [ ... ] instead of refusing to abide by their treaty and ultimately switching over to the allies during the conflict ? 
  this is incorrect . 
  the italian government did not abide to the treaty since it was a * defensive * agreement ... meaning that its provision were unapplicable nevertheless due to austria-hungary having started the war in the first place . 
  moreover , the a-h government had already refused multiple times to either hand those very same territories or make any concession whatsoever to its italian ally ; the worsening conditions of the ethnic italians in the empire , the sheer impopularity of the treaty itself - let 's not forget that italy had fought * three * wars of independence against the austrians - which had been signed in 1882 by prime minister francesco crispi in spite of the french ( they had seized tunisia a year before without his government 's consent ... ) was what led to italy ultimately forsaking the agreement . 
  moreover , this did not happen mid-conflict but sometime before italy 's entry into the war on may 24 , 1915 . 
   [ ... ] did mussolini also feel the italian government should have acted differently [ ... ], 
  as it 's already been explained no , not at all . 
  the very fact of italy joining the war against the central powers was largely justified from an italian perspective , and mussolini himself not only supported the war effort but also enlisted as a volunteer ( even though he had more than happily evaded his duty to be conscripted in 1902 ) . 
   [ ... ] these territories were trentino & south tyrol , dalmatia , trieste and fiume [ ... ], 
  actually these were istria - which comprises both trieste and fiume - dalmatia and trentino . 
  south tyrol was added in a second moment not so much because of the ( tiny ) italian minority there , but also because it provided a more easily defendable front-line ; it was , in other words , a strategically convenient place . 
  for everybody 's information , that 'd be spelt `` italia irredenta '' . 
  i 've always thought about the new 500 as some kind of shitbox suitable for a preppy 18-year-old girl who 's just got her driving licence . 
   i have always wanted an old cinquecento !, 
  you might not want to find yourself having to brake with that thingy when it 's rainy ... 
  ( ... because you literally ca n't ) . 
  anyway , i speak italian - well , uhm , i actually am one - and just happened to notice that typo ... 
  you mean a caf\u00e9 right ? 
  if so , i 'd suggest you to stay well clear of most places in the city centre ( via cavour , via del corso , via della conciliazione amd whatnot ) . 
  if you want somewhere near a monument then you 'll not only be getting mediocre coffee but also literally renting the view ; there are * lots * of caf\u00e9s over here and even for a local recommending one in particular is a rather difficult thing to do - crossing the whole town to get a coffee does n't quite make sense to me , so the only suggestion i can give you right now is to wander the city centre and stumble upon a place of your liking ... which will hopefully be decent and cheap enough . 
  if you could tell us the area you 'll be staying in - now that 'd be useful info !, 
   [ ... ] to graziani in libya in 1940, 
  well , to be fair graziani seems to have been fully aware of his units ' total lack of supplies and preparation ; in this case , the one who was n't was the * duce * himself . 
  graziani had indeed chosen to dig in and prepare a defensive line which , notwithstanding its defects - it was too stretched out , meaning that the various strong-points ( how are they called in english ? ), 
  could barely support each other - may have served its purpose ... * had the plans been followed * . 
  it was mussolini who , as we said , was utterly convinced of britain 's impending defeat and sent graziani a series of telegrams ordering him to dismantle everything and move his troops towards a much smaller ( but also rather well-armed , supplied and agile ) enemy , even going insofar as to threaten him with demotion or an eventual court martial had he failed to heed his words and take action . 
  something which he did , but ushered in total defeat . 
   [ ... ] so is my perception of italian military leadership during this period wrong , or was the general staff really full of terrible officers and if so , why ? 
  your perception is certainly not that wrong but is not very fair , either , and fails to take some factors into account :, 
  * first , many in the italian general staff had an antiquated concept of warfare - quite a few were senile themselves !, 
  - which they carried over from their experience over the alpine front in wwi . 
  they also failed to understand , notwithstanding the country 's rather massive participation in the spanish civil war , many of the aspects that would characterise a ` new ' conflict . 
  * secondly , many of those who had graduated from the military academies happened to belong - more often than not - to the higher classes : this was all more apparent in wwi , an era in which decent social mobility and merit were n't quite widespread in the kingdom at the time . 
  how many of them , like the much vituperated badoglio or baratieri , were there because of their merits and not because of their ( admittedly close ) ties to the court ? 
  * third , the ww2-era * comando superiore del r.e. 
  * was n't all that bad - true , there were some embarrassingly incompetent commanders , but for every single visconti-prasca ( the sycophantic general in charge of the invasion of greece ) there was an italo gariboldi in there , somewhere . 
  and not all of them were as incompetent or unimaginative as those you might have heard of ... the much-discussed giulio douhet was one of ( if not * the * ) early proponents of air power ; the duke of aosta proved to be a capable strategist ; giovanni messe managed well on the russian front but also succeeded to slow down somewhat the allied advance on tunisia ; and so on ... 
  * fourth , mussolini 's nosy attitude was just as bad as the fact of having to put up with the army 's very strict - and at times downright nonsensical - chain of command , which did n't leave the officers any space for manoeuvre . 
  speaking about the navy , adm. angelo iachino 's shows very well in his memories ^ *** 1 *** how a british admiral could always rely not only on the constant presence of the fleet air arm ( something the italians , due to interservice rivalry , did n't have ) but were left with enough decisional autonomy to get the job done ; whereas his italian counterparts just had to follow the high command 's orders * to the letter * . 
  and whenever air support was needed they had to notify the command first , which would have then evaluated the request and relayed it to the air force - a support which , more often than not , could n't be delivered due to the squadrons ' land-based location that made reaching the battlefield in time an unnecessarily arduous task . 
  yes , yes , yes ... that 's definitely the film i was looking for !, 
  thank you so much !, 
  now that i know which series they belong to , i certainly will . 
  i too do n't think italy was an exception ... and if i am not mistaken , cavalli-sforza 's researches gave evidence enough - albeit the matter 's not yet settled - how most italians descended from the various peoples that inhabitated the peninsula ( not just romans ) with noticeable foreign influxes and admixtures ; a pattern similar to that of france . 
  indeed , the barbarian tribes who had settled in italy during the early middle ages were often outnumbered by the locals already living there , and in the end were absorbed ( both culturally and demographically ) by the latter . 
  so no , i do n't think / u/freevoulous ' statement, 
   [ ... ] medieval italians were ** in large part ** , cultural and genetic descendants of various european peoples who migrated into rome [ ... ], 
  to be completely true , especially as far as the cultural aspects are concerned : keep in mind that historically the * exact opposite * has happened , with tribes such as the ostrogoths or the lombards eventually coming to adopt the language and mannerisms of the locals instead of their own ... even going insofar as to redact their laws in latin . 
  italy had indeed brought the pope 's temporal rule to an end by annexing rome ( the last papal stronghold ) on 20 september , 1870 ; but the pope refused despite the freedoms - such as the right to receive foreign ambassardors , monetary compensations , being granted the inviolability of his person , etc. 
  - and assurances passed by the new italian parliament , to recognise the new state of things . 
  this led to a situation - the * roman question * - in which italian catholics were forbidden by their own church to participate in the new country 's political sphere , even if such prohibitions gradually came to be ignored , and by the early ' 900s were unattended by pretty much everybody ( also due to the new pontiffs ' more conciliant stance ) . 
   [ ... ] why did not italy label him as a traitor , end the papacy and not give him any land ? 
  as to why the new kingdom did n't bring the papacy to an end , the reason is very simple : nobody would have wanted that , least of all the king . 
  not only did the pope have the support of almost a billion catholics worldwide - thus making such a resolution extremely controversial and likely cause of diplomatic friction , perhaps even war - but the king 's legitimacy came from ruling `` by the grace of god and the will of the nation '' . 
  ^ ** 1 ** not to mention that this would 've probably led to further revolts , which would have made the then-ongoing military campaign against the brigands in the country 's south look like a cake-walk . 
  nobody wanted that to happen and what is more important , nobody would 've gained anything from it ... 
  ... and this is true even today , too !, 
   why did italy give the pope land in the lateran treaty ? 
  until 1929 , the kingdom and the holy see simply did n't recognise each other until mussolini - in a bid to please the more devout strata of the population - signed the lateran treaty , thus establishing the modern-day vatican city ; political convenience , coupled with the ever-present quest for consensus , was what made the fascist regime do it . 
  ^ ** 1 ** from the very first page of the * statuto albertino * , the kingdom 's constitution . 
   [ ... ] as for northern italy however , we know for a fact ( from various contemporary sources ) that migration into italia from the barbaric europe was extensive . 
  about 3/4 of all wars fought by the late roman empire were attempts to stop that invasions/migrations , and the defenders were also descendants of earleir immigrants . 
  after all , at the dawn of the middle ages , northern italy was divided among gothic fiefdoms , and de facto rulers of italy ( like king tedahad ) were goths . 
  this is very true , but keep in mind that the barbarian tribes were n't all * that * numerous to begin with ( + / - 150/200 ,000 people ) and nothwithstanding all the ruin the gothic wars had brought upon the peninsula , they still were outnumbered - and by a large margin - by the so-called * romanici * , the inhabitants of the land they settled in . 
  even the lombards , who traditionally eschewed intermarrying with those they had conquered , ended up having to do just that ; with their already small numbers dwindling , there was no choice but to truly settle down and integrate with the locals - the eventual loss of their original language and customs being the result of that choice . 
   why not let him be a private owner of st. peter 's square , let him be pope and still make it part of italy ? 
  because the pope - especially pius ix , a staunch reactionary - would have never accepted such a compromise ; he demanded a papal state to be restored , or nothing . 
  and so did his successors albeit to different degrees . 
   [ ... ] why are not there other countries who let their religious leaders have there own sovereign states ? 
  probably because most other religions/christian denominations either identify with the country they 're based in - such as the greek , russian and serbian orthodox churches - or do n't have a ` universal ' scope : the catholic church is , as the name says , highly centralised yet universal in nature and as such it does n't ` belong ' to a particular country ... 
  ... especially not to one the church itself was in bad relations with !, 
   you make a great point [ ... ], 
  thank you !, 
   [ ... ] however , when it comes to fashion/clothing , barbarian/northerner type of clothing was more popular . 
  for example , the typical italian t-shaped tunic was ( as far as we can guess from art ) replaced by a wedged tunic ( typical to germanic peoples ) . 
  yes , but i think it has more to do with the fact that people might 've found these barbarians ' clothing simpler , more comfortable , suited for work ... or even more ` fashionable ' ( who knows ? ), 
  than the things they 'd worn up to that time . 
  as i have explained earlier , such an initiative would not only have caused widespread riots during a time in which the new country was still asserting itself , but would have also made it an international pariah ; and foregn powers - some of whom had significant catholic populations - may have not appreciated it , with the crisis possibly escalating into war . 
  henry viii was able to break with rome because his was , after all , a rather peripheral nation ... but look at what happened in france during the wars of religion or the holy roman empire after the reformation !, 
  had such a thing taken place in the heart of italy , the consequences - both internal and external - would 've probably been catastrophic . 
   [ ... ] france invaded during the revolution . 
  yes , but they * did * keep the papacy in its place despite having invaded the papal states . 
  well ... one ca n't topple an established religion and expect people not to react , right ?
