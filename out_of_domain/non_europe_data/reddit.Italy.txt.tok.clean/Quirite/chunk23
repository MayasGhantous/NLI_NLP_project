  that of mussolini was in reality a mere bid to ingratiate himself to the more religious strata of the population as part of his never-ending quest for consensus , especially at a time in which popular catholic organisations ( such as the boy-scouts ) had been just outlawed in favour of their more `` fascist '' equivalents . 
  but of course - there was also the will to bring the `` roman question '' to an end , and for good ... 
  i do n't want to come across as ... well , * cross * , but could you please elaborate your question a bit further ? 
   una volta a monaco [ ... ], 
  nope . 
  those seismologists were n't convicted because of them `` failing to predict the earthquake '' but rather , for having agreed to down-play and minimise ( for purely political reasons ... ) the potential risks of an eventual quake after having allegedy been pressured into doing so by the - now former - chief of italy 's civil defence agency . 
   did the italians screw up against the british , or did the british use superior tactics, 
  both things , actually , but not quite in the way one 'd be lead to think . 
  for one - attacking the commonwealth forces in egypt was n't in general graziani 's plans ... who was well aware of his largely non-motorised units ' many shortcomings , such as a dramatic lack of supplies , obsolete/inadequate weaponry ( do n't get me started on the quality of the shells the artillery had been given ) and lack of a clear goal apart for his superior 's nebulous plans to create `` a new roman empire '' . 
  indeed , graziani knew that his opponent ( despite the far smaller numbers ) was much more agile , well-armed and supplied than his own army was and exactly because of that , he 'd seen fit to prepare a defensive line - something that might have very well done the job ... 
  ... had n't it been for mussolini 's very own , and arguably delusional , plans . 
  seeing how graziani was unwilling to attack the enemy at a time in which britain seemed to be on the brink of collapse was too much for him ; such an attitude was n't to be tolerated !, 
  and so he did send graziani several menacing telegrams so as to goad his reluctant subordinate into action , even going insofar as to threaten him with demotion and court-martial if he did n't act . 
  basically an ultimatum . 
  at the very end graziani * did * comply with the duce 's delusional orders , gave instructions to dismantle the newly-built fortifications and to move towards egypt . 
  sure enough , the british soon managed to divide and scatter his army exactly in the very way he had feared ... but he too is n't blameless , because the hastily-planned new lines of defence ( whose few strong-points had been spaced too far for them to be able to support each other ) were too thin and proved to be ineffective in the face of a heavily motorised enemy . 
   what do you think of when you hear `` austria '' and `` austrians '' ? 
  slightly pretentious krauts with pickelhaubes and a mustache , historical oppressors , something amadeus mozart ( and his balls ) , sissi , * sachertorte * , big famous concert on nye with rich people clapping out of sync , sigmund freud and other assorted sexual weirdness . 
  the people there are less boring than the swiss but just as arrogant and yet , somehow , they manage to be warmer than the germans ; apparently some of you do really wear * lederhosen * , i had never seen somebody with one irl . 
  many of you seem to hate italians ... 
  also hitler , haider , schwarzenegger and that fritzl guy . 
  as far as vienna is concerned , the town was cute and unexpectedly laid-back ( to the point of being gently boring ) . 
  is this guy 's avatar a lobster or something ? 
  * el alamein : the line of fire * , just in case you want a different perspective ( in this case , an italian one ) . 
  especially the part about venice . 
  while it 's true that it is being threatened by the rising sea levels and all , it 's not like the government is just sitting on its arse waiting for it to disappear ; apart from the new mose dam ( now nearing completion ) , much has been done to preserve the city . 
  for example , many of the buildings ' foundations - as well as the city 's countless banks - have been restored , strenghtened and raised ; the lagoon 's rather peculiar habitat is literally being rebuilt from scratch by restoring or re-creating hundreds of shoals ; the industrial port nearby is being cleared ; cruise ships are ( thankfully ) no longer allowed to get right in there and pass just a few hundred metres by the town , * et cetera * , etc. , etc. 
  the elements certainly are n't being very kind to venice but it 's not like it 's disappearing , either . 
   [ ... ] as soon as he was brought down ( when rome fell ) [ ... ], 
  more like as soon as * sicily * fell . 
  rome was liberated on 4 june 1944 , while mussolini had been deposed almost a year before ( on 25 july 1943 ) . 
   southern italy ** including rome **, 
  oh no you did n't . 
  yes , but go tell a roman ( s ) he 's a southerner and see if you can get away with it unscathed . 
  roman here !, 
  as far as the pizzerie are concerned , * il mozzicone * ( located in borgo pio , near the vatican ) used to be rather good ; however , with the recent change in management it 's become yet another tourist trap so going there is no longer that adviceable . 
  on the other hand , nearby ** napul ' \u00e8 ** ( viale giulio cesare , 89 ) and ** l'aquila d'oro ** ( same location , almost next door ) should do the trick . 
  ** da settimio ** ( via di val tellina , 81 ) is a national treasure . 
  the place can now afford to stay open only in the evening and you have to make a reservation ; it 's out of the way and the staff speaks absolutely no english whatsoever but i 'll be damned if it ai n't it worth the trip !, 
  if you 're looking for a bakery then you should definitely do yourself a favour - throw the guides away and go to the ** panificio mosca ** ( via candia , 16 ) instead . 
  you wo n't regret it . 
  other damn fine places include ** prelibato ** ( viale di villa pamphili , 214 ) and ** l'arte bianca ** ( via di donna olimpia , 188 ) which truly offer the best take-away pizzas around despite being slightly off the beaten path . 
  yeah , but i was kinda expecting them to at least attempt to steamroll me first . 
  so ... not even the devs can tame the big green blob , huh ? 
   racism . 
  could you explain this point a bit further ? 
   also , my current play through is as simien , so i expect we suffer from many of the same religious pains . 
  and karaites . 
  but yeah , we definitely do !, 
  that pathetic excuse of a rabbi i 've got ca n't even get rid of the heresies on our own soil , let alone try to convert an angry tengri waiting to revolt . 
  and you only get a ridiculous amount of moral authority for crushing them , which is ridiculous if you ask me ... 
  but hey - at least you do n't have byzantium next door . 
  i guess that while this was really the case in history , the devs might have over-done a bit too much ; imho there should have been an option in the diplomacy screen for the bride/groom to convert to the other party 's religion when you make an offer for a betrothal/marriage . 
  just an idea , but historically plenty of people did that ... 
  got ta say that i too like having neat , well-defined borders . 
  as for the lombards , why the hate ? 
  this . 
  so much this . 
  sophia loren was n't even * that * hot back then , and now she looks like some creepy-ass wax mannequin ( which she probably is ) . 
  selena gomez , on the other hand , reminds me of someone in the middle of an anaphylactic shock . 
  besides , i think we 've all had enough of that photo of her smoking a fucking cigarette . 
  * pearl harbor * sucked donkey balls but was n't she smokin ' hot in that film !, 
  all that did n't just happen because of the king 's support for fascism , but also because of the royal family 's hasty retreat from rome after the events of 8 september 1943 ... something many in the country viewed as a betrayal . 
  it should be noted , however , that the new republic did not actually win by a landslide - quite the contrary !, 
  - and that the referendum itself was rather controversial at the time ; not only there were widespread allegations of vote-rigging but the victory of the republic was proclaimed some time before the counting of the votes had even finished , and the new government deliberately suppressed demonstrations in favour of the monarchy ( as it happened on 11 june 1946 in naples ' via medina , where the police opened fire on the protesters leaving nine dead and a hundred wounded ) . 
   [ ... ] but i ca n't figure out why the male members of it were exiled . 
  because the country was effectively split in two following the referendum of 1946 , with almost half of the population having voted in favour of the monarchy and the other half having voted against . 
  after 2 june , umberto ii realised just how volatile the situation really was and instead of contesting the referendum 's results he chose to leave the country in order to avoid another civil war ... 
  ... had he not done so , italy might have suffered the very same fate as greece . 
  the king went into exile while the government saw fit to defuse the tensions ( and , in doing so , secure its grip on the country ) by including such a clause in the new italian constitution which , fyi , was repealed in 2002 . 
   [ ... ] because it ususally is n't good for the stability of your nation to keep a de-powered monarch around, 
  this is true , but please note that the italian monarch was n't just a mere figurehead but had quite a few legislative/executive powers himself - such as appointing or sacking pms , emanating royal decrees etc. , etc. , etc. 
   [ ... ] plus i 'm sure if they had stayed they would have joined the 10,000 or so executed fascist supporters in 1946 by the italian resistance, 
  not quite , but the country might have very well plunged into another civil war ( despite the fact that by mid-1946 most of the partisans had been already been disarmed by the cln and their weapons taken by the new authorities ) . 
   [ ... ] i 'm currently looking at airbnb in regola & parione [ ... ] are those areas okay as far as safety & walking around at night is concerned ? 
  those two are just wards , and nowadays they 're not much different from the rest of the city 's historical centre - which is quite safe . 
  rome as a whole can be considered such , the only ( relatively ) ` rough ' parts of town being well out of the way of any tourist whatsoever . 
   ethiopia was able to modernize quick enough [ ... ], 
  more precisely , the guns the ethiopians used in the ambush at adwa were supplied by france and russia . 
   [ ... ] their regard for long-term prospects and investment was nil and their projection capabilities inferior . 
  not quite , one should consider many of the fascist r\u00e9gime 's rather ambitious plans for libya and the a.o.i. 
  ( italian east africa ) such as the re-building of mogadishu and asmara or the so-called ` imperial road ' network . 
  but yes , these ended up being only partially implemented due to the war and budget/material constraints , not a lack of vision . 
  while the kingdom 's previous colonial policy was certainly something rudimentary compared to that of the uk , the same kind of developmental policies enacted by that very country from 1934 to 1960 are quite different . 
   french and italian / most of wars in africa come from here, 
  i disagree - in the case of italy , the situation of this country 's former colonies is not so much the result of colonialism itself but rather , of the ussr-backed regimes that took the place of their first democratically elected governments ; 1960 somalia was rather different from that of 1969 , and arguably much better than the failed state post-1991 . 
  as for eritrea , the colony was federated with ethiopia after ww2 at the behest of the allies ( as a compensation to the ethiopians ) and the country has regained its independence only in 1993 , after a long and bloody war . 
  you just won the prize for `` stupidest comment of the thread '' . 
  and surprise , we actually did n't get kicked out of africa until 1960 !, 
  even after the 1896 defeat at adwa ( during which 40,000 ethiopians armed by the french and russians ambushed 18,000 italians , at night ... ) we still had * other * colonies in the continent , such as eritrea and somalia . 
  and if your aim was really to insult us , you could at the very least have used the common courtesy of getting your facts right before blabbing on a topic you seem to know fuck-all about . 
  as far as being `` the only europeans to get their own arses handed by the natives '' , you should really check the strategical masterpiece that was the british invasion of afghanistan or the 1879 battle of isandlwana ... 
  ... something which can actually put adwa to shame . 
   that might be true , but i think it 's a little more than vision in what i was referring to , you have to have a good plan in place . 
  a big factor in british success was allowing for autonomous rule in principalities and royal territories , which made localized planning and governing much more efficient . 
  the french and italians failed to relieve their direct control of colony to this same degree , even if there were inspired visions . 
  yeah , i think you get your idea - in this respect italian rule was highly centralised , with viceroys and a whole slew of european bureaucrats ( commissars , prefects , etc. 
  etc. ), 
  doing their job in what was basically an almost-specular reproduction of italy 's territorial subdivisions , which also reflected its distribution of local power . 
   well , italy has done a really great job of covering up the fact that they 're responsible for eritrea and somalia ...
