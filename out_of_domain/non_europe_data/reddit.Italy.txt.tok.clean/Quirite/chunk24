  the italians left somalia in 1960 , and before 1969 the country was actually a pretty decent place ( by post-colonial standards ) until siad barre overthrew the democratically-elected government to install his communist dictatorship . 
  but this was still better than the period after the fall of the r\u00e9gime in 1991 , after which somalia plunged into chaos . 
  / u/medhelan already explained how eritrea was federated with ethiopia after ww2 ( this happened in 1952 , to be more precise ... ) only to regain its indepence in 1993 after a long and bloody war against the ethiopians . 
   [ ... ] this is the first time i 've heard of italy in africa beyond getting their asses handed to them in ethiopia, 
  again , / u/raymondluxury-yacht , this needs some context . 
  the 18,000-men strong expeditionary force that was slaughtered at adwa had actually gotten lost and dispersed ; it was then ambushed at night by some 35,000 / 40,000 ethiopians ( estimates vary ) armed with modern weaponry courtesy of the french and russians , so the ` battle ' - if we may call it as such - was a gory , one-sided affair not unlike the little big horn . 
  and actually the italians were n't the only europeans to get their arses handed to them by the natives - the british had suffered a disastrous defeat in 1879 at the hands of the zulus during the battle of isandlwana ( anglo-zulu war ) . 
  the botched invasion of afghanistan is another example , which would be ridiculous if it was n't so tragic . 
   italy tried in 1895-1896 but the ethiopians fought back and defeated them at adwa in 1896 . 
  ok , but this needs some context . 
  and since i love repeating myself :, 
   [ ... ] the 18,000-men strong expeditionary force that was slaughtered at adwa had actually gotten lost and dispersed ; it was then ambushed at night by some 35,000 / 40,000 ethiopians ( estimates vary ) armed with modern weaponry courtesy of the french and russians , so the ` battle ' - if we may call it as such - was a gory , one-sided affair not unlike the little big horn . 
  do n't worry , no need to apologise !, 
  ma per favore . 
   [ ... ] do italians like fast food ? 
  yes , but with moderation ( i only eat at mickey d 's once/twice a month ) . 
   [ ... ] do you think we 'll face stiff competition ? 
  no , but you have to stick to your area the same way mcdonald 's or burger king do ; do not try to `` italianise '' your food offer by attempting to sell wine to the customers or imitating local cuisine . 
  on the other hand , you might have the need to slightly alter your recipes in order to adapt it to the local tastes ( e.g. , customers may like less spicy food ) . 
  also buy local produce and use fresh ingredients ... 
  you have to convince the average joe that you 're better than their local kebap vendor !, 
  and keep in mind that fast food is by no means a novelty over here - the others have been there for some 30/40 years now ; your strength is thus in the kind of food you will sell , which unlike mcnuggets is not readily available or even known in most places ( even in rome there are not many mexican restaurants ) . 
   [ ... ] and almost all modern day italians are descendants of the lombards, 
  excuse me ? 
  this is a gross generalisation , which does n't even take central and southern italy into account - actually , the barbarian tribes who settled italy during the high middle ages numbered 150,000 / 200,000 people maximum and were always outnumbered by the local * romanici * . 
  it is no surprise then that they ended up being assimilated by the latter !, 
  had n't that been the case we would at the very least be speaking some heavily germanised version of our language . 
   [ ... ] and do n't have the roman/latin culture of the original roman republic . 
  of course we do n't : the various cultures of italy , which then gave life to the italian one as we know it today , have evolved over time . 
  but these did in fact descent and evolve from the latin one ( and that of the greeks/whatever italic tribe happened to inhabit the territory in question ) with naturally some influences from the outside . 
  the germanic law and customs in italy ended up being quite ephemeral ( these had all disappeared by the 9th century ad ) with the ostrogoths/lombards eventually adopting the language , culture and legal system of their subjects !, 
  in other words - the barbarians in the peninsula ended up being utterly , totally and thoroughly assimilated ; they left little material traces of their domination apart from a few words , names , pieces of architecture and , of course , some influence on our dna . 
  were you expecting us to be still kissing our wives to check whether they 'd drank wine ? 
   [ ... ] the `` papal state '' ( where rome was ) was just another city-state [ ... ], 
  not quite , you 're confusing the papal states with the vatican . 
  the papal states ( hence the name ) were not limited to rome but ended up controlling much of central italy - such as the marches or romagna - apart from the rest of latium . 
  the pa did n't thus qualify as a city-state , not even after 1860 when they lost most ofthe territories to the newly-formed kingdom of italy ( with the exception of latium ) . 
  they ceased to exist after 1870 , and the modern vatican city was only established in 1929 . 
  is it some kind of fail-safe in case both the army and the national guard are too slow/far/simply unable to intervene ? 
  great video !, 
  and it 's got a documentary value , as it shows many of the monuments before they were cleaned and restored ... 
  why not share it with the guys on / r/history ? 
  i 'm pretty sure they 'd appreciate it . 
   persino il national anthem, 
  jesus harold christ ... that was a terrifying ( yet informative ) read !, 
  as far as italy is concerned , no - not least because the muslim presence was largely limited to the island of sicily , while the few bridgeheads they 'd gotten on the southern part of the peninsula 's heel did n't last long and were wiped out . 
  moorish rule in sicily actually lasted a bit longer - little more than a century - but that one too had ceased to exist by 1091 , as the place had fallen to the normans ... a few years before the crusades had even begun . 
  i 'd argue that this , coupled with the fact that the muslim holdings in the iberian peninsula were far more important ( and lasting ) than those in sicily , might have something to do with the lack of efforts aimed at an eventual * reconquista * of the island . 
  please keep in mind that i 'm not a professional historian - i 'd wait for other answers . 
  ah , yes , i had forgotten about that one !, 
  thank you for reminding me . 
  however , i 'm not sure whether that would count as a `` re-conquest '' of italy ... ? 
  i ca n't exactly point out what it is , but i distinctly remember the '90s / early 2000s as being a far happier time than this rather grim decade of ours !, 
  also , the slightly more colourful fashion ( does anyone remember those coloured sunglasses ? ), 
  and [ some ] ( http://media.autoblog.it/a/a11/a112_3_01.jpg ) of the older cars . 
  nowadays they all look alike and have too much un-fixable electronic shit . 
  i just read [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/335on6/what_is_a_really_morbid_question_you_have_always/cqi8dte ) informative post before going to bed , had silly nightmares all night long . 
  i dreamed of having an heart attack while saving some kiddo from a ship 's pool * and * discussing how best to fix its engine ... then i was in a park and some dude with a sweater was jogging , when all of a sudden some naked lady hidden in a bush tased him . 
  she blinked and told me she was training him to be the antichrist or something . 
  and i 've had even weirder ones !, 
  i usually wake up and write them down asap , with plenty of details . 
  yeah , these were simpler times . 
  i remember exchanging my house 's phone number with that of a friend 's , getting pocket money in the old currency ( this was before the euro - 1000 lire seemed such a big sum to 7-year-old me , while in reality they were worth less than a pubic hair !, 
  ) , playing ps1 with a friend for entire afternoons in summer ... 
  but nothing beats having all your relatives alive and well . 
   do you have any recurring dreams ? 
  yeah , it is usually me going around town for some nonsensical reason or engines that really need to be fixed ( that in my latest dream had one of its pistons ' scraper rings broken and it was letting oil into the combustion chamber ) . 
  proud owner of a 2003 fiat punto here !, 
  while it is a fairly recent model , it does n't even have nearly as much electronics than the new cars - quite the contrary , it is rather ` backward ' when compared to them !, 
  - and i had the pleasure of ` fixing ' it myself . 
  had to find a way to keep the radiator 's circuit open , mounted xenon headlamps and hydrogen kit myself , manually replaced the cartridge oil filter twice , fixed the previously broken rear-view mirror by inserting a metal plate in order to keep it up and then glued the plastic cover back ... 
  so yeah , i love it . 
  but i still have no ac as well !, 
  no , but as a substitute taxi driver - meaning that i have the city 's permit but not a car ( and relative licence ) - i have to know this , since one has to pass a rigorous exam first in order to be allowed to drive paying passengers around . 
  what do you do ? 
  well - technically i too am , as i can only replace other drivers when they 're on vacation or are sick . 
  so rest assured that you 're not alone !, 
   [ ... ] knocking on people 's doors to see if they were home etc. 
  back then you could just leave your door unlocked , or even get into the house via the loo 's window in case you forgot your keys inside ( but ours was a fairly small place - basically the italian equivalent of bumfuck county ) . 
  now i do n't even know my neighbours , never seen them . 
  i too used to live in a pretty small place !, 
  however we had n't much in the way of farming , only cows shitting everywhere and a guy who shot at foxes ( they killed its livestock ) . 
  i think this is mostly because of the harsh terrain , as well as the fact that many inhabitants had moved to the capital and only got back during the summer holidays . 
  no girls either , apart from those blessed three months of summer ; the rest of the year i was pretty lonely . 
  in winter there was just us and another family , so less than 10/12 people in total ... oh , and you had to drive 5 km in order to get a coffee/newspaper/bag of crisps , 27 to get your groceries and 30-ish to the nearest bar/disco/whatever .

  ex-boss ordered us not go to the bathroom for a pee before 9:40 am ( there were cameras ) , hated cellphones ( conceal it under the table !, 
  ) , music ( he hates it ! ), 
  and was scared shitless of the numbers 13 and 17 . 
  i had to write `` 12/bis '' and 16/bis '' in their place . 
  also , he 'd probably banged all of our russian co-workers ( most of whom just happened to be suspiciously attractive ) in order for them to get the job and one morning we all got an angry e-mail from a customer who had allegedly witnessed him mistreating a pregnant woman , i kid you not . 
  but , hey , he was really really * filthy * rich . 
  bonus trivia : the guy fled to cyprus aboard his own yacht the day before our equivalent of the irs showed up . 
  it 's a left-over from latin , it means something along the lines of `` twice '' - so 16/bis is `` 16/twice '' . 
  but yeah , it 's a stupid thing any way you look at it . 
  no , it did n't quite work that way - when you numbered the cartaceous file folders everybody had access to , they 'd have to look like `` 11 ... 12 ... 12/bis ... 14 ... 15 ... 16 ... 16/bis ... '' and so on . 
  it was thankfully limited to those folders . 
  i agree , and so was my boss . 
  he looked like an oompa-loompa dressed as a yacht captain with a whole lot of graying hair worthy of phil spector 's murderous head . 
  i wish i could post a photo of him so that everybody could enjoy his radiant visage ...
