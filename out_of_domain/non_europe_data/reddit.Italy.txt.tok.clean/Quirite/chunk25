  i just want star trek voyager back , could n't care less about those lightsabre-rattling goons . 
  and if there 's a cinematic franchise that deserved being revived , that 'd have been * a series of unfortunate events * . 
  just wanted to say thank you so much for having introduced me to fleetwood mac !, 
   [ ... ] what where you doing there ? 
  dad worked as some kind of technician in a quarry located ( not exactly ) nearby , and since we had my grandma 's house at our disposal we would n't have to worry about rent and the like . 
  the only thing is , the place could get a tad bit too cold for our liking and we only had a fireplace - no such frills as a ` modern ' heating system . 
   [ ... ] what did you do in winter to keep from going locked-jaw-glazed-eye mad ? 
  every day i iook the rickety thingy that brought me and another child to school in a nearby town , where i had some friends . 
  there were a few other children in the village too but apart from one in particular i was n't really that close to the others . 
  we moved out the last year of middle school . 
  anyway , our favourite game was to play with make-shift gun our parents had made us with the pieces of firewood they had n't burned yet , and then run around pew-pewing each other . 
  snowballs fights too , or running away screaming when one particular person notorious for its crooked teeth ( which scared the shit out of everybody ) came in our direction . 
  insensitive , i know . 
  also , ps1 . 
  due to the mountain range nearby you could ony pick the first three/sometimes six channels that were broadcast nationwide , so it 's not like you had much choice in matter of tv preferences . 
  and you could n't play when it was raining , as lightning strikes already hit our tv set twice !, 
  i 'd always forgot to disconnect it before playtime . 
  in summer we 'd just wait until evening , take our flashlights and explore the surroundings giggling like idiots . 
  or if there was a local feast - there were a few - then there would 've been a folk orchestra playing for all the people ( and their daughters ... ) who 'd come from the other places around ours , plus the [ guy selling roasted peanuts ] ( http://images.fotocommunity.it/foto/persone/persone/venditore-di-noccioline-a-enna-2010-3e52ef09-94d9-41b3-ac78-7d59f1693d20.jpg ) and the like . 
  summer was fun , the rest of the year mildly so and winter sucked donkey balls . 
  i do n't know whether this is the kind of answer you were looking for , but in order to give you another example ... the pierleonis are a noble family whose ancestor happened to be a roman jew who had converted to christianity sometime in the 10th century ad , and was later granted a title by pope himself . 
  the family was quite prominent in rome during the middle ages and not only many of its members were made cardinals , but the house itself can also boast an anti-pope among its ancestors ( that 'd be anacletus ii , ` reigned ' 1130-37 ) . 
  wait until the company you 've been working for as accountant goes down the toilet - then try to reinvent yourself as a supermarket re-stocker , tour promoter , apprentice book-binder ... only to become a ( substitute ) taxi driver . 
  you 'll get used to it . 
  `` it 's the crisis , baby '' . 
   [ ... ] italy entered the war , aiming to claim dalmatia , trentino and trieste . 
  italy actually claimed istria as a whole , not just trieste or fiume . 
   [ ... ] they got zara and some other parts of dalmatia, 
  true , but these ` other parts of dalmatia ' were that town 's immediate surroundings !, 
   [ ... ] however , the allies did give southern tyrol to the italians, 
  alto adige was added in a second moment , and for purely strategical/defence purposes ( the brenner pass and the surrounding stretch of alps could be defended more easily than trentino - and this is also the reason as to why the construction of the * vallo alpino * was started right in that place ) . 
   [ ... ] yep , it still amazes me that the myth actually made it off the ground . 
  it 's very simple - propaganda fueled by the failure of italian/international diplomacy during the peace negotiations and also by the perceived meddling of president wilson to the detriment of italy . 
  if you take into account the facts that the statuses of fiume and zara had to be negotiated separately a few years after the war , and that the country did n't * quite * get what was promised by the 1915 treaty of london you can see why people would complain . 
   unlike most italian units during the war , the fought well [ ... ], 
  excuse me ? 
  while the royal italian army gets a lot of shit nowadays - just see the comments below - for the debacles in north africa and greece , you should check out other scenarios as well such as the campaign in east africa , the siege at amba alagi ( 7,000 italians holding 40,000 commonwealth troops at bay , and for a whole month !, 
  ) , the battle at the kasserine pass , the counter-attack at gela or the massacre of cephalonia ( but please do n't rely on * that * horrible film ) . 
  or even the defence of rome 's porta s. paolo , the exploits of italian submariners in the atlantic/red sea and the attacks against the convoys engaged in operation pedestal ... just to name a few . 
  this said , you should definitely have a look at mario rigoni stern 's * the sergeant in the snow * . 
   what 's the deal with italy 's two police forces ? 
  one is the ` regular ' ( criminal ) police ; the other one a gendarmerie corps , which also handles far tougher shit . 
   when would you call one , and when the other ? 
  in my experience the * carabinieri * usually respond more swiftly than the police does , so i 'd call them only if i was in * very * serious danger ( like people trying to break in my home ) . 
  police is ok , while your local department ca n't be bothered by anything or anyone . 
  edit : perch\u00e9 i downvotes ? 
  btw , `` futbol '' is a spanish word - we just call it * calcio * . 
  i 'd suggest you not to confuse the two languages , as people may not appreciate it !, 
  yes , definitely . 
  ma c ` era da aspettarselo . 
  la fonte puoi trovarla [ qui ] ( https://rometheimperialfora19952010.wordpress.com/tag/dr-mariarosaria-barbera-ssbar/ ) . 
  the villa of livia was located below a smallish mound between the tiberine and cassian roads , near the locality known as prima porta ( then in the roman campagna , now one of the city 's suburbs ) . 
  ^ ^ ** 1 ** antonio nibby , one of the foremost archaeologists and antiquarians in the papal states , had already identified some of the few structures ^ ^ ** 2 ** that could be seen emerging from the earth as belonging to a building of the augustan era - possibly the very villa of livia - in 1849 , but he merely limited himself in reporting his findings within his * analisi storico-topografico-antiquaria della carta de ' dintorni di roma * ( tipografia delle belle arti , roma 1849 ) . 
  perhaps that year 's revolutionary uprisings may have had some kind of role in delaying further inspections , but we do n't know with certainty ... well , at the very least * i * do n't !, 
  as to why the place was n't excavated earlier , keep in mind that the campagna was a quite desolate and sparsely inhabitated - not to mention dangerous - place at the time ; brigands and malaria were n't uncommon occurrences . 
  the events of 1860 may have discouraged further research/excavations as well . 
  so the mound laid untouched for another 14 years until a three-man party , led by a certain giuseppe gagliardi with the assistance of a mr. senni and a mr. ambrogi ^ ^ ** 3 ** ( they 'd realised the site 's significance , having probably learnt about nibby 's studies ) began excavating the hill in the hope of finding something . 
  and something they did find !, 
  g. henzen described the findings as such :, 
   [ ... ] they produced , apart from many decorated floors they 'd discovered almost at ground level , three very beautiful busts portraying roman characters [ ... ] numerous pipes made of lead bearing the name of titus caesar were also discovered , thus confirming the attribution of the afore-mentioned villa [ ... ] various chambers , which have already been opened , showed walls once covered in lively colours [ ... ], 
  then ... 
   [ ... ] on the 20th [ of april ] one of the most interesting and beautiful [ antiquities ] of this kind to have ever been excavated was brought to light . 
  this one had been found in front of the villa , on a surface facing the tiber which might have been once a porch or a terrace located right in front of the building 's fa\u00e7ade . 
  it is a life-sized portrayal of augustus and is wonderfully complete in all its parts , in such a way that not even the tip of its nose is missing . 
  the [ statue 's ] right arm appears to be broken , and so is the lower section of its legs ; but all the parts have survived , and they only need be re-attached ... 
  seems like they had just found your guy , op !, 
   [ ... ] a few surviving bars of iron , [ protruding ] from the afore-mentioned arm and left leg , show that the statue had already been broken in antiquity . 
  its head was grafted on the torso . 
  the emperor , portrayed when he was approximately 40 years of age , has his head slightly tilted on the right . 
  he is nude , and so are his feet - something which , considering the armour which covers the rest of his body , lead us to believe he 'd been portrayed when he had already been deified [ ... ] or as a god , or a hero .

  good question . 
  actually , henzen 's description of the site does n't seem to mention much of its history before the discovery , so my guess is as good as ours ... and not being an archaeologist myself i find myself unable to give you a satisfying answer . 
  however , the place was not very populous to begin with and all the marble middle-age roman might have needed ( to get mortar , i mean ... ) was already available within the city walls ; there would 've been no need for them to get all the way out of town . 
  malaria was another - incredibly common - factor and so were bandits : but they too might have had no use for what was after all `` just a half-buried piece of rock '' . 
  it is also possible that no one ever bothered to get close enough to have a look , and even if somebody ( such as a pilgrim or a traveller ) did , there 's almost no way they could have brought a broken , useless statue with them ; and while someone might have spotted the statue , they may have treated it as little more than a curiosity ( `` who do you think this guy is ? '', 
  `` hell if i know ! '' ) . 
  moreover , the river 's located nearby and it is possible that it flooded the area more than once - this could explain the mound-like appearance of the site before the excavation , but i 'm not sure . 
  you 're welcome . 
  btw , really ? 
  well , that 's pretty much standard practice where i 'm from . 
  diplomas usually are n't ready until a few months after you 've graduated , and you have to pay a few $ if you want to take a copy ( which you 'll need to enroll at a university ) . 
  over here these kinds of documents have a real legal value , so it might make sense . 
  er , i was just pointing a mistake out ... 
  my answer too would be no ( as far as i 'm aware ) . 
  and i think that kennedy would 've needed to have been killed * in odium fidei * - for his faith that is . 
  i unfortunately do n't have much free time on my hands right now ... :-(, 
  and , i might add that in italy 's case both a dysfunctional procuring system ( in which some industrial groups , such as breda or fiat , were favoured over their competitors due to their closeness to * certain elements * of the court almost without regards to performance - the ba . 
  88 was kept in production at the government 's insistence ) as well as erroneous tactical assumptions ( the high command believed that an aircraft 's manoeuvrability was more essential than anything in their book , at least according to their experiences during the spanish civil war - this is why they pushed to have yet another biplane to be designed ) were something that heavily influenced its air force 's capabilities . 
  ecco [ com ` era ] ( https://twitter.com/rita_katz/status/592746532920827905/photo/1 ) , e com ' \u00e8 [ adesso ] ( https://www.skylinewebcams.com/it/webcam/italia/lazio/roma/colosseo.html ) - i lavori di restauro su quel lato sono finiti da tempo !, 
  i do n't know , perhaps the mass expulsion of german civilians from the eastern territories or the 1944-1949 istrian exodus might qualify ? 
  while i 'm in all honesty not particularly knowledgeable about the former - better wait for some other flaired user !, 
  - the other one saw almost 300,000 ethnic italians leaving what where then italy 's north-eastern territories ( istria and a few bits of dalmatia ) after these had fallen under yugoslav occupation . 
  while the slovene and croat groups living in the area had indeed been oppressed ( forced italianisation , beatings and , after 1941 , concentration camps ) by the fascist regime , when both the government and the german occupators fell around 1943/44 they left a power vacuum that many exploited for own private retributions ; around 5000 italians were killed and their bodies uncerimoniously dumped into karst sinkholes commonly found in the area ( * foibe * ) or often thrown in there while still alive . 
  this - as well as the partition of those territories between the western allies and yugoslavians - prompted a mass exodus of people towards the more secure rest of the peninsula , with many just leaving all their possessions behind them ( have a look at trieste 's [ warehouse n \u00b0 18 ] ( http://www.molfettadiscute.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/magazzino_18.jpg ) , where [ all ] ( http://www.goodmorningtrieste.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/giornale-di-brescia-4.jpg ) the [ belongings ] ( http://www.ansa.it/webimages/foto_large_ls_350/2014/2/13/604195d534ec61af58bd6d7c5b2e835c.jpg ) which did not have a [ claimant ] ( http://www.donboscoborgo.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cristicchi_magazzino_18_profughi_istriani.jpg ) anymore were stored ) . 
  it is worth noting that most of these victims were in reality innocent civilians ; most of the fascist perpetrators had already left around 1943 , with the result that those people were either killed because of some form of private vengeance or for having been mistaken for fascist collaborators . 
  another instance of that could be that of the 20,000 descendants of italian settlers from libya who had to leave the country at the time of muhammar gheddafi 's rise to power , in 1970 .
