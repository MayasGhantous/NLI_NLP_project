   italy : poor morale , leadership and equipment made the italian army a laughing stock . 
  its `` might '' was displayed to the world in 1940 with the italian invasion of greece . 
   italy was a damn joke - they should have just concentrated their forces in to one battle at a time and maybe the outcome would have been different . 
  here i am , playing the devil 's advocate !, 
  things are not as simple as they appear , and there are far more reasons behind italy 's performance than just dismissing the wole country as `` a damn joke '' or its inhabitants as `` a bunch of goddamn cowards '' . 
  to begin with ... 
  ** 1 ) ** ... the royal armed forces found themselves entangled in the struggle for power between the two most prominent elements of the same government , and they bore the brunt of such infighting ; to understand why that happened one should have a deep hard look at fascist italy 's power dynamics . 
  recycling an old post of mine on the subject :, 
   on one hand there 's ** mussolini ** - the * duce * of italy , but technically still a pm - and his closest associates , the * gerarchi * ( whose great council had duties not unlike those of the politburo ) ; on the other there 's a ** king ** who , while not powerless , has seen the balance of power shift in favour of the prime minister he appointed twenty years prior ... 
   ... and who 's growing more and more war-like , not to mention increasingly insufferent of the monarchy itself . 
   mussolini , however , does n't have complete control over the country like his german and soviet counterparts ; at least not yet . 
  his power , while relatively vast , is not unchecked and he still has to work in some sort of constitutional frame . 
   by the late '30s , his area of influence and that of the king were pretty much balanced - with the result that victor emmanuel iii was beginning to resent both the duce and his inconsiderate policies , to the point of resorting to secretly back a failed palace coup in march 1940 which should have gotten rid of him for good . 
  but neither party had an edge , and the status quo had to be retained so as to avoid a potential civil war that would have benefitted nobody . 
   one should also keep in mind the facts that the king was still the ** commander-in-chief ** of the italian armed forces , and that both the royal army and navy were more loyal to him than they were to the * duce * ; whereas mussolini could only count on the paramilitary branch of his party - the mvsn . 
  but having already recognised the unfavourable state of affairs , mussolini sought to weaken the king 's grip on these institutions : and he managed in doing so , first by appointing his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 - italo balbo - as minister of the air force , then by enacting a controversial set of reforms ( around 1931-7 ) that greatly damaged the navy , which would see almost all of its air-related assets confiscated and put under the control of mussolini 's far more malleable ... or , if you prefer , likeable minister of the air . 
   [ ... ] the navy just was n't sympathetic enough towards the fascist regime and the party itself held a very limited influence within its ranks ; most of its officers either had an upper-class background or were staunch royalists therefore mussolini was understandably wary of them , not least because an unidentified admiral was the person who should have been in charge of the attempted coup of march 1940 . 
  everything checks out . 
  what do we see here is a fascist dictator who , as part of his never-ending quest for power , had deliberately and purposefully weakened his country 's armed forces so as to be able to easily subdue any threat they might pose to his rule , and to bring these institutions within the reach of the party . 
  this strategy included appointing more malleable yes-men ( such as soddu , visconti-prasca , and others ) at the expense of qualified officers . 
  ** 2 ) ** a dysfunctional chain of command which relied on the regime 's bloated , and mostly servile , gerarchies whose operative autonomy was deliberately curbed by draconian regulations that should 've kept potential troublemakers in check . 
  the subject of the post i just quoted was * supermarina * - the italian royal navy 's war-time command - whose fastidiously precise orders had to be followed almost to the letter by any officer under its command . 
  while british admirals could not only count on the assistance of the fleet air arm ( something the * regia marina * had been actually stripped of by none other than mussolini himself who put all of its air-related assets in the hands of an already over-worked but far more `` docile '' air force ) and enjoyed a decent degree of autonomy , an italian admiral just had to, 
   [ ... ] follow [ supermarina 's ] orders to the letter ; even requests for help had to be evaluated and then approved by the command . 
  on top of it all the regime had forbidden the navy to fly its own aircrafts , therefore , any request for ( say ) air cover would have needed to be sent to the command first , which would 've then relayed it to the air force which , in turn , was often unable to assist or even deliver help . 
  this is definitely not something you would want to deal with in battle . 
  ** 3 ) ** the sorry state of most equipment in the army , with much of the stockpiles having been wasted either in abyssinia or in the pointless spanish intervention . 
  this , coupled with an equally-dysfunctional procurement system ( in which the conglomerates closer to the regime were given preferential treatment regardless of the quality of their products ) and an inadequate industrial network , was one of the main factors leading to such a debacle . 
  this means that whatever equipment the army lost could hardly be replaced , with easily foreseeable consequencies , and the very fact that much of said materiel was insufficient or even obsolete by 1940 did n't help . 
  let 's not forget that italy had been also undergoing a consistent trade embargo for four years !, 
  ** 4 ) ** strategical deficencies . 
  much like hitler , mussolini enjoyed micro-managing the hell out of his subordinates and often pushed for totally pointless , unreachable or simply suicidal objectives . 
  not that his chiefs of staff would ever try to instill some common sense in him - he 'd hand-picked the `` best '' candidates himself !, 
  - but the decision to attack greece via a mountainous route * and * with tanks , to force graziani move out of his defensive positions to invade egypt , to enter the war in the mistaken belief that it 'd be soon over were all mussolini 's . 
  and his concept of `` parallel war '' had really no other goal than try to rival hitler in a mortal dick-waving contest everyone but him knew italy could not win . 
  ** 5 ) ** the utter lack of preparation . 
  mussolini had imposed a war italy was n't ready to fight , a war declared upon a whim of his - so much that he had n't considered it necessary to recall the country 's merchant fleet home , with the result that many of these vessels found themselves in hostile ports almost overnight and requisitioned . 
  ** 6 ) ** the german ally , which more often than not proved to be just as useful as a box of bricks when it was n't actively contrasting the italians ' own plans . 
  the two commands - thinking of north africa here - distrusted each other , the italians ' repeated requests for equipment ( need those 88s , mr. ciano ? 
  you shall not have them ! ), 
  or materiel ( the fleet at taranto was delivered a fraction of the fuel it was promised ) were routinely denied and so on and on and on . 
  no one can possibly expect such a shaky and uneasy alliance to properly work out . 
  i find it amazing that a country plagued by all the problems a senseless regime imposed upon it , with the few resources at its disposal and in the situation it 'd so suddenly found itself into did n't fold much sooner than it actually did . 
  plus if you still think that the italians were only capable of being routed , i 'd heartily suggest checking out the east african ( particularly the invasion of somaliland , the siege of the amba alagi as well as the exploits of `` commander devil '' ) and atlantic campaigns or other battles such as kasserine , cephalonia or gela . 
  lastly , i would like to remind how the greek campaign was n't actually a single , clamorous turning point but rather a prolonged war of attrition which took place for almost a year over the mountains of epyrus , often at below freezing temperatures . 
  the italian commanders , goaded by the * duce * , ensured that the soldiers under there `` care '' were made to fight in the worst conditions possible - all over a front which was comparable to russia for brutality . 
  they have guns . 
  lots of guns . 
  and they 're not afraid to use them ... 
  victor emmanuel iii ( 1869 -1947 ) was actually the * third * - and second to last - king of italy , who had little to do with the creation of the flag ... something older than he was . 
  for what concerns the reason as to why the italian one sported the house of savoy 's own coat of arms , the simplest answer is that piedmont ( the state that ended up uniting the entirety of the peninsula ) already had that symbol on its flag as it was ruled by that very same dynasty . 
  why was n't another state 's emblem chosen ? 
  well ... it was not them who united italy in the first place !, 
  uhm ... 
  i believe that the city in question was jericho , and not jerusalem . 
  plus , undermining such structures with the help of explosives ( whose knowledge would n't spread out of china until the middle ages ) would have required digging a few mines so as to be able to reach the walls ' foundations and amass enough of material right there . 
  even assuming that jews might 've been able to somehow get gunpowder in the first place , there 's no way they could have passed it off as a divine act ; too many people would 've been required to dig the mines , handle the explosives ... 
  pretty much . 
  what are you doing ? 
  night shifts can really suck balls , but at the very least you probably did n't have to let some shady dude into your cab !, 
  i see . 
  but do n't give up ... and do n't trust a job interview that lasts less than two minutes !, 
  at least in the case of italy , no . 
  this was not a possibility the previous governments ( including the fascist one ) had even taken into consideration , and the country was actually stripped of most of its colonies - with the partial exception of somalia - at the end of ww2 . 
  but even there it was the un which set forth a road-map for the former colonial power to follow ; italy was allowed to keep administrating the former italian somaliland as a trust territory until it was to be merged with british somaliland and granted independence ... something that happened on the 1st of july , 1960 . 
  because if they told you all you wanted to know , you probably would n't accept their offer ; they want to keep it as short ( and vague ) as possible so as not to discourage potential 'em ployers ' from joining their pyramid scheme . 
  at one such job interviews they told me the company needed an employee for unspecified `` office tasks '' , the guy explained fuck-all about the job and told me to come back next week ... was stupid enough to follow suit and went there !, 
  but i discovered that they actually wanted me go sell gas/water/electricity contracts door-to-door . 
  hey - thank you so much for the info , i would have actually never guessed that !, 
  but i also wonder what was the logic behind setting such a strange goal into the five-year plans ? 
  does n't seem something worthy boasting about . 
   the driver interviewed goes on to say that people would tamper with the meters as a way of getting around the five year plan . 
  ~ ~ as a mere curiosity , would n't their taximeters have been sealed like ours ? 
  because i know that if i tampered with it in any way whatsoever , they would take away my authorisation - and that 's something no one in the sector wants to deal with . ~ ~ oh , but you probably meant the odometers !, 
  my bad . 
  oh no , you really have n't ... been fed a steaming pile of bs actually . 
   italy was worse than worthless but even very costly to their aliies in both world wars but somehow managed to find themselves on the winning side in both . 
  thank you for the kind words . 
  but no , italy was n't certainly on the winning side of ww2 - quite the opposite !, 
   [ ... ] this betrayal pissed the austrians off so much they came in and bitch slapped the country so it basically has n't recovered from it yet , thumping them so badly the entire country nearly collapsed in revolt . 
  the austrians `` came and bitch-slapped '' the country ? 
  lol . 
  dude , do you even history ? 
  the first two years of war were a total stalemate all over the alps , then in 1917 the austrians managed to break trough at caporetto after repeated assaults ... only to be stopped on the piave by * italian * soldiers and kicked back to their original positions . 
  and actually , the country was not collapsing in revolt - but austria-hungary was just about to !, 
  plus you seem to ignore the fact that the * strafexpedition * ( `` punitive expedition '' of 1916 ) was a complete failure for the central powers . 
  oh , nevermind - irrelevant pieces of trivia such as the battle of the solstice , the raids on a-h harbours , the flights on vienna and other assorted trifles should n't obviously be taken into consideration . 
  and fyi , the allied contribution was not * that * significant as they fielded a mere seven divisions against 51 italian ones . 
  and as far as the alleged ` betrayal ' is concerned , the triple alliance was based on a * purely defensive * treaty whose clauses could n't be applied to ww1 , as the austrians were the ones who had actually declared war on their serbian neighbour . 
  plus konrad von h\u00f6tzendorf - the austrian chief of staff - had been advocating a pre-emptive strike on italy since at least 1908 , the only difference being that the italians had the guts to follow through with their plans . 
   [ ... ] mussolini was going to rebuild rome by storming north africa . 
  except that the italians were atrocious and were having trouble even before the american effort in aftrica , to the point that the germans had divert some of their best troops ( including the infamous commander e. rommel ) to bail them out . 
  once the americans showed up forget about it , they fell apart faster than a low carb diet in naples [ ... ], 
  since when is rommel considered an `` infamous '' commander ? 
  btw if you really think that the front fell faster to the americans than `` a low-carb diet in naples '' , then you should really open your history textbook - always assuming you have read one - and check out insignificant trifles such as the battle at kasserine pass , where the italians apparently managed to kick their glorious american ass . 
  hard . 
  besides , the front did not actually collapse as most of the axis forces were able to successfully retreat from tunisia ... thanks to italian mariners . 
  oh , and would you happen know who rommel actually relied upon during the na campaign ? 
  just guess : the italians !, 
  who provided most of the ( un ) armoured divisions ?
