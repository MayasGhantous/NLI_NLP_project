  fine by me ... a pair of jeans , a nice shirt , a [ cheap soviet watch ] ( http://forums.watchuseek.com/attachments/f10/49298d1179469254-luch-moon-phase-vintage-kirovski-dscn2191.jpg ) and the only nice pair of shoes without grime on them i have got - the other one really was n't appropriate - and i 'm ready to hit the scene . 
  well , sort of . 
  i was a true nervous wreck . 
  i get to the car ( oh crap !, 
  it 's dirty !, 
  i forgot to clean it after having spent almost two weeks at the seaside ... ) which really is a sad , homely , fourteen-year-old [ fiat punto ] ( http://imganuncios.mitula.net/fiat_punto_1_2i_16v_cat_5_porte_feel_usata_99255291836472229.jpg ) . 
  so begins the second most stressful drive in my whole life . 
  i was planning on telling her what my truest feelings towards her are , but i did n't know how and i could n't think of a decent way to do so ; meanwhile i 'm going around in circles as i ca n't find the damn place !, 
  i somehow manage to get there , though ( almost newly-qualified driver here !, 
  ) , but * she * was late ; we got worried after a while and were about to phone her when she made her entrance in the place . 
  i was like `` wow ... she 's got to be the hottest piece of ass i 've ever seen . 
  maaan , she 's fit ! '' . 
  i could n't help but look at her , to which she would sometimes glance back and smile ; i felt feel like i was made of jelly or something . 
  the evening proceeds smoothly and nicely , everybody orders some sardinian wine ( which i already know to be rather strong ) but i drink a glass nevertheless , as i 'm in dire need for some liquid courage . 
  after a looong while everybody starts chanting `` happy birthday '' , the guest of honour opens her gifts and then - at almost 1:00 pm - the much-feared moment of bidding the others farewell has come ; that was the time i was planning to somehow tell her about my feelings and by this detail alone you can already tell i am a novice to love . 
  redditors , bear with me - beause this is where things get interesting !, 
  apparently gianni , the friend who was to drive her home is in no condition to do so ... he 's totally stoned . 
  nobody has got enough space on their vehicles , she still has n't got her driving licence and the area really is in the asswoods of nowhere . 
  in a rare bout of guts i offer to drive her home . 
  she accepts gladly . 
  we get on the ` love machine ' ( she does n't seem to notice all the sand on the back seats ) , i crank the old lady up and so begins the longest , cringiest , stressful , drive in my whole life . 
  i try to strike up conversation but it just does n't feel natural at all , for my brain is totally blank and my tongue dry ; after a bit we have to stop at an intersection . 
  now , some of the older fiat puntos have a weird flaw , that is , the engine turns off by itself whenever it is running low with rpms - and this is exactly what happens . 
  the traffic light gets green , i fumble with the key , then with the stick , but to no avail ; the arsehole behind us hits the horn and i work myself into a tizzy . 
  i notice the smile on her face !, 
  i could die right now . 
  but then the best part of me takes over , i take a deep breath , gently put the stick back into neutral and turn the key . 
  works like a charm , and we dart ( so to speak , my car 's a jalopy ) through the city 's empty streets . 
  i pull over in front her condo , and by now my heart-rate is sky-rocketing . 
  we wish each other good night and she 's about to get off the car when i ask her out of the blue : * `` e un bacio non me lo dai ? 
  '' * ( something along the lines of : `` are n't you forgetting anything ? '' ) . 
  she gets back , looks at me and then kisses me straight on the lips . 
  i think we made out for a good minute . 
  it was glorious . 
  sort of . 
  i just called her and we 're going to see a film at the cinema ... alone . 
  i guess that can be considered a date , right ? 
  what a jolly good idea , i admit i did not think about going to the bowling . 
  unfortunately , i think there 's only one in the whole city and is quite far from where we live ; it 's near the river . 
  i choose the cinema mainly because it felt , uh , less awkward . 
  i might have to reconsider that , though ... but what about an unpretentious dinner after the film ? 
  would that be ideal ? 
  ( in case you were wondering , yes , this is my first date !, 
  about time ... ) . 
   and maybe you should mention that it 's a date once so you both are on the same page . 
  good luck !, 
  i definitely will - thank you for the advice , i did n't think about that . 
   and btw i think what you said in the car was really smooth . 
  i do n't even know how did i come up with that !, 
  i was really ... do n't know . 
  everything happened rather quickly . 
  thanks !, 
  e chi si offende ? 
  tipo ? 
  pensa che mi ero abituato con una panda di quelle nuove , diesel , e la differenza si sente ... 
  sai come dice il proverbio , no ? 
  trust me , you wo n't have any problem whatsoever in finding some pub crawl - especially in or around piazza campo de ' fiori . 
  this said , you should be warned that public drunkenness is still pretty much inacceptable in italy , although things are slowly changing with the younger generations . 
  also , beware - sometimes campo de ' fiori can get a bit of a boxing ring because of the many foreign exchange students getting drunk and picking fights . 
  as far as beers are concerned ... even though i do n't usually like to drink , i find the * ichnusa * brand ( from sardinia ) to be rather good . 
  i do n't know about draught beers , as i 'm a total noob when it comes to these things !, 
  here are a few more ( and hopefully useful ) tips :, 
  * learn how to cross the street safely as soon as possible . 
  i had some american friends over and they did n't quite get the timing right - but crossing with droves of other people will be of great help . 
  * lots of restoration works going on this year ( coliseum , trevi fountain ) . 
  * public transit is ** not ** free , even though it may seem so . 
  atac tickets/passes - covering pretty much every form of transportation in city - are inexpensive if compared to those of most european capitals and ticket checkers do , in fact , check who 's got a ticket and who 's not ( even if randomly ) . 
  * you might also think that locals cheat the system just because nobody seems to be validating their tickets on the bus ... but this is patently false . 
  most of us do have monthly/yearly passes that require no validation ( except on the metro ) . 
  * remember to validate your atac ticket on the bus/tram/trolleybus otherwise you 'll be fined . 
  * and if you do buy a weekly/monthly pass , write your name on it : you can be fined for that , too . 
  * you ca n't buy atac tickets on the bus ( but you can do so on some of the newer trams ) . 
  * try to avoid the metro , and especially line b , at rush hour ( 7:30 - 9:00 am ) . 
  if you really have to take it , know that the last cars are - generally speaking - less crowded . 
  forget looking for a seat at that hour . 
  * if you 're planning on visiting a restaurant , know that the * coperto * charge is illegal in rome and the surrounding lazio region . 
  if you still find that charge on your bill , threaten to call the * guardia di finanza * ( italy 's tax police ; phone # ** 117 ** ) until the restaurateur backs off . 
  * being charged for bread is totally legitimate , but if you do n't want to pay for it just refuse that already on your table or send back any bread the waiter brings you . 
  * touristy caf\u00e9s will charge you more if you sit down . 
  neighbourhood bars wo n't . 
  * avoid any and all restaurants/caf \u00e9s / gelaterie in front of the vatican museums , on via della conciliazione or in the via cavour , near termini . 
  these are notorious for fleecing tourists . 
  * of course , * giolitti * sucks donkey balls . 
  do n't believe your guidebook . 
  * roman pizzas are thinner and crispier than the `` classic '' neapolitan pizza . 
  do n't listen to those who say it is n't real pizza - they do n't know what they 're talking about - and try it out instead . 
  * * suppl\u00ec * ( fried rice balls with mozzarella and tomato ) , a pizza and a bottle of beer are a wonderful combo . 
  * it is not customary to order for tap water at the restaurant , and you 'll have to pay for it . 
  * do not for the love of god ever buy snacks/water from the many carts located near the major monuments ; these all belong to a rather dishonest city councilor and you would n't want to fatten his wallet any further . 
  same goes with the chestnut vendors you can see in the historical centre every winter . 
  * really , taking a photo with the centurions is n't worth it . 
  they 're rude , obnoxious , are working illegally and will almost certainly rip you off . 
  besides , their `` armours '' are laughable ... at best . 
  * tap water in rome is good and safe to drink ; you can save money by refilling your bottle at the many small , cast-iron fountains called * nasoni * . 
  in order to drink from them , place your finger over the end of the spout and a stream of water will spurt upwards through a hole on top of the pipe . 
  * the xmas market at piazza navona is a total sham , and so is the open-air market at campo de ' fiori . 
  * rose sellers and beggars can sometimes be very insistent ... do not hesitate to shoo them away rudely . 
  * the area around termini is n't , actually , as dangerous as you might have heard . 
  caution is advised in the station itself , though , as gypsies like to concentrate - and operate - there . 
  * beware of fake taxis .
