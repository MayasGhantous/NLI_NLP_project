  the italians . 
  who managed to sneak in enough supplies at a great cost , so to allow axis forces to advance despite the best efforts of the royal navy and the faa ? 
  the italians . 
  who was sacrificed by the germans so to act as cannon-fodder against the british ? 
  the italians . 
  who actually made many ( if not most ) of rommel 's plans possible ? 
  that 's correct , the italians !, 
  but we hardly , if ever , get any credit . 
  and if you still think they were pussies , check out the siege of the amba alagi : 7000 italians managing to hold some 40,000 commonwealth troops at bay , and for a whole month , in may 1941 - only ceasing resistance when they ran out of water , ammo ... and men . 
  that 's just one example . 
   [ ... ] the italian people could see which side of the pizza their sauce was on and turned on mussolini , so by the time the allies got their they could say , `` see boys , we were with you all along !, 
  how else could you explain such utter incompetence ? '', 
  daaamn , this is a gross oversimplification and misrepresentation of historical facts . 
  victor emmanuel iii was actually the one who sacked mussolini - and he had already tried doing that in 1938 and 1940 , not succeeding because of opposition from the top dogs of the fascist party and the very fact that deposing him would 've led to a civil war . 
  no mention of mussolini 's escape , his fascist puppet-state , the resistance , civil war and all . 
   italy wins again , despite their extreme incompetence . 
  let 's see just how wonderful the prize we ` won ' is :, 
  suffered 320,000 kia , with 95,000 mia only on the russian front ; 130,000 civilians died ; 80 % of the nation 's infrastructure was in ruins ; the country was put under military occupation ; had to pay hefty reparations to the winners , which included giving away or even scrapping the few warships that were still serviceable ; lost all of our colonies ; lost the entire north-eastern border to yugoslavia with the subsequent/concurrent murder of some 5000 italians and the displacement of 350,000 others ; lost parts of the north-western border to france , complete with attempted `` crimea-style '' annexations ( val d'aosta , ventimiglia ) ; lost the dodecanese to greece and the italians living there were expelled ; the allies leading the lira to over-inflation due to their incompetent handling of the am-lira scheme ; the allies reintroducing the mafia in sicily ; having to replace the monarchy by means of a rigged referendum ... 
  ... and you 're still adamant in your ridiculous belief that * we 've actually won the damn war ? 
  even though the treaty of paris , let alone the historical facts , clearly state otherwise ? 
  i truly am at loss of words . 
  they 're also planning on recostructing at least some parts of it , but for the meantime archaeologists just have to re-inter everything ( the city 's been suffering from a chronic shortage of funds ) . 
  but let 's hope they do that !, 
   1946 : italians vote to turn italy into a republic . 
  king umberto ii is promptly banished . 
  a true shame indeed . 
  the republic was declared before the counting of the votes had even finished , the government declared its victory before the court of cassation could proceed with a review of the ballots , 3 million italians ( mainly from the north-east ) were left unable to vote , monarchists were either forbidden from campaigning or downright shot at ( as it happened in naples on 11 june 1946 ) , local results had been altered in at least a few cases , and dead people had risen from the grave ... only to vote in favour of the republic , probably with some help from the holy ghost . 
  the referendum was a fraud . 
  plain and simple . 
   for instance [ ... ] in italy ( mar\u00e9chal juin ) [ ... ], 
  well , uhm , the french did n't exactly [ cover themselves in glory ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marocchinate ) during the italian campaign . 
  be ' , l'idea era per l'appunto quella ... credo che la cosa fosse voluta . 
  translations ? 
  i may have interpreted this question in the wrong way but afaik there 's never been the need for an italian ` translation ' of dante 's works , simply because the language has largely stayed the same ... except for a few particular , obsolete or obscure terms that are usually explained with the help of foot-notes . 
  a modern italian schoolkid is indeed able to read the divine comedy no more , no less exactly as it had been written nearly 800 years ago . 
  oooh , finally a question i can actually answer ( eh , i 'm roman myself ! ) . 
   what types of dishes constitute the traditional cuisine of the city of rome ? 
  historically speaking , rome 's cuisine has been characterised by its relative `` poverty '' - i.e. 
  as far as meat is concerned , people used to eat the scraps and residues of animals such as pork , cow or sheep . 
  so you 've got delicacies such as the * pajata * ( a veal 's intestines ) , * animelle * ( an animal 's belly sweetbread ) , cow brain , or the infamous * quinto quarto * - that is , whatever 's been left of a cow or a pig after all the more desirable parts had been sold . 
  pidgeon , lamb and the like were reserved for important occasions or feast days . 
  but roman cuisine also makes use of a limited variety of pastas ( * alla amatriciana * , * alla gricia * , * all ` arrabbiata * , * alla carbonara * ) , soups , and of course the ever-present vegetables - such as the rather notorious * carciofi alla giud\u00eca * ( artichokes fried `` in the jewish manner '' ) ; perhaps surprisingly , tomato was not a staple of roman cuisine and it was used rather sparingly . 
  things such as the * pangiallo * were among the few sweets ordinary romans might have consumed . 
  local wines from latium ( frascati , velletri , rocca di papa , etc. ), 
  were drank by pretty much everybody regardless of their social standing and boy , did n't people enjoy drinking in the 1800s ... 
   what dishes were consumed by different social classes ? 
  it 's not much a question of dishes , but ingredients : the richer you were , the better parts of an animal or the more exotic wines you could afford . 
  unless we 're talking about the feasts of rich people , during which specialties from other parts of italy were served , your nobleman would 've probably eaten the same kinds of pasta a commoner would . 
   how has roman cuisine affected that of contemporary italy ? 
  not much , actually . 
  not much . 
  even its own variety of pizza , or the * suppl\u00ec * - which are relatively modern developments - failed to spread in other parts of the country ; and the last one 's totally unknown outside of latium . 
  this said , traditional roman cuisine has n't changed since 1870 ( but the eating habits of romans definitely have !, 
   did not know that was roman . 
  now you do ... :-), 
   historically , what served to distinguish roman pasta and pasta dishes from those of different regions ? 
  did the relative `` poverty '' of roman cuisine affect the composition of pasta dishes ? 
  well , except for a particular variety of * gnocchi * the kinds of pasta that are used in roman cuisine are pretty much undistinguishable from others that originated in neighbouring areas ; toppings , on the other hand , are their notable features . 
  and yes , roman dishes are simple - but hearty - in nature : ingredients are few and recipes make use of relatively common things such as cheese ( generally * pecorino * ) , meat ( * guanciale * - pig cheek ) , eggs and the like . 
   although typical wines were consumed by all , were wines consumed by elites noticeably superior in quality ? 
  no , not necessarily ... unless they were imported or sent as a gift to , say , a landlord or an important member of the clergy/nobility . 
  but many * ostarie * ( taverns ) often diluted wine or served what we 'd call military-grade plonk ... 
  do n't worry !, 
  anyway , no , the differences are surprisingly minimal ... 
  mmmh , i honestly ca n't think of any ; but in case you 're curious a few traditional dishes are mentioned in g. g. belli 's sonnets ( mid-1800s ) or in those of benedetto micheli ( who lived a century prior , and whose only edition of his works has been out of print for almost 20 years now ) . 
  note that these works are all written in the roman dialect , though . 
  other descriptions , not histories , can be found throughout giuseppe berneri 's mock-epic * il meo patacca * ( 1695 ) . 
  thanks but no thanks . 
  mine are from [ fleetwood mac 's `` gypsy '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex8tfvinn3y ) :, 
   she is dancing away from you now ,, 
   she was just a wish, 
   she was just ... a wish, 
   and her memory is all that is left for you now . 
  * jesus actual christ on a pogo stick - the whole `` looking at st. peter 's dome from some door 's keyhole '' thing is just as disappointing as the description implies , and is absolutely * not * worthy neither the ( looong ) lines nor the ridiculous hike to get there in the first place . 
  besides , your photo will probably look shitty - always assuming you manage to get one . 
  if all you want is a clean shot of the all-too-famous cupola you can take bus line n. 982 , get off at [ this ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/via+nicol%c3%b2+piccolomini,+00165+roma,+italia/@41.89219,12.443335,3a,75y,45.49h,87.74t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sletdm50wmcrtczo_or_f4a!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x132f600b0db623c9:0xd0369e18a4ed8c74!6m1!1e1 ) ( thankfully unspoiled ) lookout and enjoy the bonus optical effect . 
  * by booking tickets in advance for places such the vatican museums and the coliseum you will avoid the queues ... 
  * trastevere is a nice district , but if you think that it 's an authentic slice of town you need a reality check . 
  * same thing for the city centre , it 's wonderful but faker than disneyland . 
   any advice on general precautions ? 
  * keep an eye ( or , better yet , an hand ... ) on your belongings while on the metro . 
  * buses can sometimes get * real * crowded , so use common sense and do as explained above . 
  * the flea market at porta portese is big and busy ; watch out for pick-pockets . 
  * do not attempt to speak spanish to us - that 's ... that 's quite insulting , actually !, 
  feel free to speak english or to mangle our poor language ( we 're not frenchies ! ), 
  but for the love of everything holy , do not speak spanish . 
   any scams & sketchy plots to look out for ? 
  * real taxi driver here - legitimate ones drive white cars with taximeters , taxi lights , clear tariffs and all ; you can find us waiting outside the station/airport at the designated taxi rank . 
  we 're not going to ask you if you need a ride ... illegal drivers like to do that !, 
  do n't be fooled by those shady asshats , op - you 'll likely regret it . 
  * avoid restaurants with menus in multiple languages , in front of monuments or those with people eating before 8 pm - these are tourist traps . 
  the definition includes * any * and * all * of the places located around the vatican . 
  * touristy restaurants will probably try to make you pay for bread ; refuse the basket when the waiter brings it at your table . 
  they may also charge you for * servizio * or * coperto * , but these charge are actually illegal . 
  just sayin ' ... 
  * many caf\u00e9s in the historical centre will make you pay more just for sitting down ; the rest does not . 
  * just refill your water bottle at the many iron fountains you 'll encounter : buying new ones will cost you a fortune . 
  italian here - we usually round the bill to the next euro , and that 's it . 
  but only if service 's been very good ... 
  was finding the right piece needlessly difficult or expensive ?
