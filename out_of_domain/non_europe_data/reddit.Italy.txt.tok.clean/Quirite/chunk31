   there was lots of issues with other things however ... haha, 
  such as ? 
  some dude in a grey pullover is jogging in a park when suddenly a woman emerges from the bushes and proceeds to taze the everloving shit out of him ; she turns around , winks at me and then proceeds to explain how she 's actually training the poor sod to be the antichrist or something . 
  had too much chinese food , i guess ... 
  it 's ( part of ) my address ... 
  i have no boss , and i do n't have to spend entire days in front of a computer anymore . 
  also , you get to meet lots of new people everyday ... not so good when they try to mug you or do n't feel like paying , that kinda spoils the day . 
  during middle school one of our disabled classmates started jerking off under the desk while looking at our ( female ) teacher ; the other , handicapped guy kept staring at him while he was doing the deed , making funny faces and noises in the meantime ... then the teacher got mad and screamed at the wanking guy to stop , but he just would not listen . 
  that day i laughed uncontrollably - only to realise the sadness of it all a few years after . 
  edit : in case you were wondering , no , i was n't in special ed . 
  here in italy is not unusual for classes to have a few - usually two - disabled classmates , so as to give them a more ` friendly ' environment than their own classrooms . 
   dealing with public wanking is pretty standard issue for special ed teachers , community workers , and inclusive schools . 
  really ? 
  i would 've never guessed . 
  wow , i literally had no idea . 
  til !, 
  never happened ... but surely that 'd earn me a few quids more !, 
  actually ours was a mixed class ... if the school is able to , they 'll usually avoid relegating all the disabled kids in one place ; they put a couple of them in every classroom instead . 
  i think it 's a good thing , when done properly . 
  nope , i am 22 and i actually come from italy ... 
  probably not - simply because tourists these days have gps , iphones and whatnot plus many of them seem to memorise the routes in question better than you do ; not to mention that a lot of colleagues seem to rely on navigators instead of their own heads . 
  such a method could have worked ten years ago ... now i would n't try it . 
  i see !, 
  otoh my car 's third piston needs its scraper rings replaced , they 're letting oil into the combustion chamber ... 
  are we talking about 16th-century rome ? 
  because unless you like living ( very ) dangerously , i would invite you to reconsider your choice . 
  we 're talking about a city in which violence was literally out of control because of things such as knife fights , * breccolate * - youngsters throwing rocks at each other just for the sake of it and often dying because of that ` sport ' - muggings , murders and whatnot ; a city in which jews were forced to live in a cramped ghetto that was subject to the river 's caprices ; a city in which these very same jews were often publicly mocked , incessantly importuned with mandatory sermons and were often dragged on the streets and then forcibly made to roll down the capitoline hill inside a barrel - all of this as part of the roman carnival ; a poorly-lit settlement with an astonishing crime rate and an even more ineffective , corrupt militia ; a place in which hygiene was the least of concerns , where diseases were just as common as thefts and murders . 
  not to mention the unnecessarily gruesome executions ( let 's have fun watching some poor sod 's * mazzolatura * , anyone ? ), 
  and the rather suffocating presence of religion . 
  i am roman myself , i like my city 's history , i like its dialect ... but not even i would like to go back then !, 
  if you want to experience the city as it was before the unification , then i 'd recommend limiting your time-trip to the more civil 1850s . 
  but if you really want to have a look at 16th-century rome , hey , at least make sure to depart before 1527 . :-), 
  did n't know italy was a federation ... also , what do you mean by `` crumbling infrastructure '' ? 
  well - actually the entire city and its whereabouts are being restored by the authorities , which have been engaged in one of the most massive restoration efforts ever ... for some 49 years now !, 
  here 's a few stats : the lagoon 's floor has been cleaned , its typical environment thoroughly recreated , commercial waterways have underwent the same treatment , the banks around the lagoon have been restored , thousands of * fondamenta * - that 'd be the islet 's own banks - have been restored and reinforced , plus an awful lot of the churches/historical palaces has actually been subjected to renovation works ; even many of the bridges ( such as the * ponte di rialto * , * ponte dell ` accademia * , * ponte s. cristoforo * - just to name a few ) have been restored or , as in the last case , rebuilt ... albeit not from scratch . 
  as far as the biggies are concerned - st. mark 's just emerged from a 20-year-long cycle of restorations , the bridge of sighs reopened a few years ago , and much of the ducal palace 's been refurbished ... not to mention the facts that cruise ships are not allowed to dwarf the islands anymore and that the gigantic dam which will protect them from exceptionally high water is actually being finished ( the aptly-named m.o.s.e. 
  will be operative from next summer ) . 
  so it 's not like the government just sat there waiting for venice to disappear . 
  nope , italy . 
  then you should n't probably live in a place culturally more significant than bumfuck , kansas ... 
  it 's known as `` tre scatolette '' in italy ... but i 've only seen it done in naples !, 
  you 'll be glad to know that these guys get often beaten by the legit taxi drivers , when they find out ... 
  but anyway - a golden rule is to * always * go at the dedicated taxi rank !, 
  this is only true in touristy areas , though ; in the rest of the city you pay the same . 
   in italy you have to be very very very careful to follow every traffic rule, 
  well , uh , should n't you be doing that anyway ? 
   with fees i one paid about 150 $ for parking in a parking spot for resident only . 
  you probably parked your car in one of those spots with yellow stripes ... which is reserved to disabled people . 
   i had a nice local stop me from hailing a taxi in rome on the street . 
  well , you can actually * do * that - and i 'm saying this as a taxi driver myself !, 
  illegals like to hang around train stations and airports , where they 're too busy pestering tourists and trying to convince them to get in their cars ; they do n't usually get people from the street . 
  i 'm afraid the `` nice local '' in question was just a little bit uninformed . 
  so if you see a regular , empty white cab with its taxi-light turned off you can hail it - no probs . 
  my bad , meant the other way ... 
  i would also add this , albeit it is a relatively unknown episode : on 11 june 1946 , police forces opened fire on a number of protesters that were peacefully campaigning in favour of the newly-exiled king of italy , umberto ii . 
  the shooting - which took place in naples ' via medina - left 9 dead and 50/70 more wounded ... a few of them having been deliberately run over by the police 's armoured cars . 
  and some days earlier ( on 7 june ) a paper bomb had been actually thrown against another pro-monarchy rally , this time leaving a 14-year-old boy dead . 
   a majority of the drivers in italy still drive a stick-shift . 
   [ ... ] you can see this in how the italians tried to attack greece . 
  they simply walked into greek machineguns , having learned nothing from 1915 . 
  germans had to bail them out . 
  the attack on greece was a failure , but for reasons other apart from the usual incompetent commanders . 
  * first , the land invasion was initiated at mussolini 's explicit request , who then proceeded to put his trusted commanders in charge . 
  visconti-prasca was little more than a yes-man and a rather ... average officer all around but even he was skeptic about the whole campaign ; his successor , ubaldo soddu , was just plain unfit for command and by the time ugo cavallero was sent in * their * place to make up for * their * failures , it was too late . 
  * secondly , mussolini chose to override his chiefs of staff - who 'd spent months detailing * esigenza g * , the campaign 's ambitious ( original ) masterplan - and caught everyone almost by surprise by initiating hostilities much sooner than expected , thus leaving his collaborators to rely on superesercito 's own orders instead of their plans . 
  this left visconti-prasca with relatively little time to think of another , wholly different plan which had to take the mut ( il ) ated forces at its disposal into account . 
  * third , the theatre . 
  attacking through epyrus - a mountainous region - with winter at the door ( and with tanks , at that ! ), 
  was a less-than-stellar idea : no one , save perhaps for mussolini , imagined a walk in the park and the trench war that followed was at the very least kind of expected . 
  but it should also be mentioned that the greek forces were greatly aided by their own civilians and this obviously had an impact . 
   [ ... ] another example is italian forces in egypt . 
  they were handed crushing defeat by wavell . 
  they expected to walk into the british , fight , and win due to huge numerical superiority . 
  did n't happen [ ... ], 
  to be fair , graziani was fully aware of his units ' inferior equipment and supplies ; this is why he had actually set up a defensive line and was reluctant to attack the commonwealth forces in egypt . 
  mussolini was the one who ordered him , with a series of increasingly threatening telegrams , to dismantle everything and move against the british : he only acted because of what he perceived as a very real threat , that of a court martial . 
   [ ... ] there are cultural reasons too . 
  what does it mean to be a soldier in germany in 1939 ? 
  especially a prussian officer ? 
  what does its mean to be an italian bersaglieri ? 
  sorry , but this is indeed a huuuge generalisation and fails to take into account many historical instances - such as a well-led italian force routing the allies at kasserine pass , the valiant resistance of the men under the command of the duke of aosta ( amba alagi , ethiopia : 3000 italians holding off 39.000 commonwealth troops for a whole month ) , the exploits of the frogmen or even the 1941-1943 guerrilla campaign of amedeo guillet ( aka `` commander devil '' ) . 
   [ ... ] italy however lost its first war against ethiopia , took almost nothing out of the first world war except a huge casualty list , and fared poorly against greek and ethiopian troops in 30s/1940 . 
  not entirely true , and some of this is outright wrong or taken out of context . 
  * first , the first italo-abyssinian war of 1896 saw a 18.000-men-strong expeditionary corps led by his most incompetency oreste baratieri ( baratter ) being ambushed one night at adua by some 40.000 ethiopians armed with modern weapons courtesy of the french and russians , some of whom were also acting as military advisors . 
  * secondly , italy did indeed get something out of ww1 - namely trentino , alto adige , istria and bits of dalmatia - but the more nationalist circles began crying betrayal ( as not all of their demands had been met ) so this pre-reddit circlejerk actually made its way among the soldiers and the public opinion . 
  such hysterics , as well as the italian diplomats ' withdrawal from the peace conference , fueled the myth of a `` maimed victory '' . 
  * actually , no , the italians did not fare poorly against ethiopia ; the christmas offensive of 1935 managed to divide the italian forces in two trunks but not to rout them , and the ethiopians themselves would eventually find themselves curb-stomped at scir\u00e8 and mai ceu , with the italians suffering little to no losses against some 8,000 abyssinians dead . 
  certainly not a walk in the park but nothing of the likes of greece , either . 
   [ ... ] they had their wellingtons , their ludendorffs , their napoleons and suvorov and washingtons . 
  they had them in their dozens . 
  italy had none . 
  well - not entirely true , again . 
  eugenio di savoia , garibaldi , armando diaz , giovanni messe , italo gariboldi , the duke of aosta ... italy was not short on brilliant officers but many of them were either ignored in favour of totally incompent ( but much more loyal and well-connected ) officers such as zincone , badoglio , even cadorna ; or listened at too late . 
   [ ... ] people rarely display the kind of loyalty to their country 's aims that they do to their friends wellbeing . 
  if one person harbours a problem with the war he still has to fight because if his comrades ca n't rely on him they could be harmed . 
  but if the whole unit harbours a problem then that 's it . 
  this was italy 's case , but for an entirely different reason : the army 's loyalty to the king and not to the * duce * . 
  the royal armed forces found themselves entangled in the struggle for power between the two most prominent elements of the same government , and they bore the brunt of such infighting . 
  to understand why that happened one should have a deep hard look at fascist italy 's power dynamics ... recycling an old post of mine on the subject :, 
   on one hand there 's ** mussolini ** - the * duce * of italy , but technically still a pm - and his closest associates , the * gerarchi * ( whose great council had duties not unlike those of the politburo ) ; on the other there 's a ** king ** who , while not powerless , has seen the balance of power shift in favour of the guy he appointed twenty years prior ...
