  salty , or even tap , water may do harm to the engine : it can not only create some truly nasty deposits but it may also damage or even corrode those parts ( such as pipes ) that happen to be made in plastic . 
  putting alcohol in the radiator can help somewhat but , still , it dissipates fairly easily ; adding salt can lower the water 's freezing point albeit * at the cost of your engine 's structural integrity * . 
  do not try unless it 's an emergency for jeebus ' sake !, 
   what 's the purpose of anti-freeze ? 
  the shit gets mixed to the water so that it does n't evaporate/freeze too easily ... 
  ... occurrences of the latter may very well bust the radiator or a cylinder open !, 
   just how would you fill the water tank on your vehicle ? 
  wait until the engine 's cooled down , then proceed to carefully unscrew the cap with the help of a rag and * slowly * fill the expansion tank up - especially if the water 's cooler than the engine is . 
  otherwise the cylinder block might crack . 
   replacing tyres, 
  loosen the bolts while the car 's still on the ground - you can ( and should ) remove the wheel * after * it 's been lifted . 
   fan belts, 
  fyi most fans are electrically-powered ; older cars have them connected to the crankshaft by means of a belt . 
   exhaust systems, 
  catalytic converters - either porcelain or metal filters whose tasks are to 1 ) break down poisonous fumes into more innocuous , not to mention slightly more breathable , components and 2 ) reduce noise - do not live up to the hype as they can only function efficiently within a certain temperature range . 
  otherwise , they 're fairly useless i reckon . 
  lambda ( oxygen ) sensors , otoh , are located in the exhaust manifold : they literally ` smell ' the fumes , analyse them and send the data to the engine 's control unit so as to allow for a ( supposedly ) more efficient combustion cycle . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  do n't forget to tell us how everything went . 
  i 'd be glad to answer your questions !, 
  water and oil above all . 
  as average people there 's not much we can do but if there 's something we can interact with ... 
  ... that 'd be water , oil , tyres and the like indeed !, 
  ** motor oil ** : check and refill/replace whenever specified by the owner 's manual , or alternatively every 15/30 ,000 km . 
  if you need to dispose of the spent liquid before you replace it with new oil , let a professional do that for you . 
  ** spin-on oil filter ** : again , replace every two oil changes . 
  ** coolant ** : check and refill every 80,000 km by adding a mixture ( around 50/50 ) of distilled water and anti-freeze . 
  do not add too much or too little , and make sure its level stays between the min and max signs on the expansion tank . 
  ** washer fluid ** : just refill whenever you run out of it !, 
  ** tyres ** : check every 5000 km . 
  ** radiator ** : remove the dirt every 15,000 km or so ( same as oil ) . 
  ** engine air filter ** : clean or replace , the frequency 's as above . 
  after all is said and done , let your mechanic take care of the rest ... 
   [ ... ] and the former italian royal family . 
  actually , only a particular member from the former royal family was thought to be involved with the organisation - and that one was vittorio emanuele . 
  but it 's worth mentioning that at least part of the list is considered rather dubious at best and that the male members of the house of savoy were banned from entering italian soil until 2002 . 
  while this one guy 's past history of almost-neverending trouble as well as his worrying tendency to be a source of embarrassment for his own family * ( by getting disinherited by his father - umberto ii , the last king of italy - after marrying without the latter 's consent in 1970 ; having tried to ` depose ' that very same father a year prior , in 1969 ; having proclaimed himself king in his place ; emanating a couple of worthless , supposedly-royal decrees with the aim to nobilitate his soon-to-be wife ; having been held responsible for the `` accidental '' death of a german tourist in 1978 ; his controversial statements , absurd requests for reparations and later clashes with the law ; publicly punching his cousin - amedeo di savoia-aosta , who also happens to be the rightful heir to the throne - in the presence of the king of spain ; and much more ... ) * would certainly make an eventual participation of such a colourful character into the p2 not that unlikely , there is in all fairness no actual proof of him having ever joined the lodge in question . 
   [ ... ] the p2 lodge , who referred to themselves as the * frati neri * , hung his corpse under blackfriars bridge ; supposedly as some kind of warning . 
  we 're not even certain about the p2 's real extent , the identities of its actual members and the veracity of the list that had been found in gelli 's possession - let alone of the existence of a ( most likely fabricated ) nickname yallop thought members may or may not have used for themselves . 
  such an assumption is either yellow journalism at its finest or , if not , yet another reason to stay away from wikipedia ... as if we really needed any more of them !, 
  this said , i really would n't rely on yallop 's work . 
  and the one taught in italian schools as well , duh ... ;-), 
   would it have been the equivalent of reading chaucer to a modern day english speaker ? 
  absolutely not , the language has n't actually changed much in 800 years - to the point that any italian schoolkid is easily able to read the divine comedy , the only footnotes needed regarding dante 's choice of ( sometimes archaic , or obscure ) words as well as his numerous references to the politics/celebs of his time . 
   used rifles and pistols went onto the civilian market , were handed out to the recently defeated ( italy ), 
  yeah - dad told me that when he was conscripted ( around 1976/7 ) , they were still training recruits with garands . 
   might have just been the places i happened to go, 
  very much probably , this . 
  the pizzas you get in any touristy restaurant over here * do * in fact suck , and by everybody 's standards at that ... 
  depends on where you are ... 
   are there any royalist still around in italy, 
  of course there are , and i am one of them ... we 're not too many , but we 're growing !, 
  wish i could 've answered this question earlier !, 
  anyhoo , no sane monarchist would ever dream of supporting vittorio emanuele , the split in question being almost irrelevant ( amedeo being the legit claimant to the throne anyway due to a series of historical circumstances , and the supporters of v.e. 
  being even fewer than we are - not to mention the fact that these people are just in for the money ) . 
  btw there are actually quite a few young people in the u.m.i. 
  - that 'd be the italian monarchist union - which also happens to be the only legit party of this kind around , as it 's got explicit royal assent and patronage . 
  its ` clones ' are either much more irrelevant than we are ( simple fb pages ) or mere fa\u00e7ades ( * that * branch of the house of savoy would n't be getting the few supporter it 's got if they were n't paying them ) . 
   how is the royal past viewed ? 
  misconceptions abound , and ignoring a * most * important portion of this country 's history is all too common . 
  have fun trying to debunk 69 years of propaganda , you 'd be sneered at ... at best !, 
  hehe !, 
  you 've got that the other way around , though . 
  he fought in south america first , then in the italian peninsula ... 
  when in rome , go * ai marmi * ( on viale trastevere ) . 
  you wo n't regret it . 
  either that , or an * erboristeria * ( a herbalist 's ) . 
  one angry woman is usually more than enough . 
  windows 8 . 
  it 's good to be the shitlord !, 
   [ ... ] the italian red sea flotilla seams relatively weak and could have been dealt with by the rn . 
  they did not have the oil anyway . 
  not to mention the fact that * supermarina * ( the royal italian fleet 's high command ) was well aware of the flotilla 's inferiority , and saw fit to gradually relocate its vessels to penang and tientsin - a process that was complete by 1941 . 
   [ ... ] why start a large offensive their that takes months to complete , when you are fighting desperately in greek and north africa ? 
  i too would like to know the answer to that question but i suspect that the somewhat shaky control of the ethiopian highlands , as well as the presence of sympathethic ( not to mention active ) resistance movements , may have something to do with that . 
  edit : excuse this answer 's ridiculous shortness - been awake since 5 am !, 
  hey , feel free to ask any questions on the italian side you may have while we wait for another flaired user to drop in . 
  they actually did , however :, 
  * many , if not most , of the graduates actually came from the upper classes ( this was particularly evident in the * regia marina * ) and an awful lot of them happened to be appointed because of their influence with the court ;, 
  * party logic otoh meant that the regime - as part of a deliberate effort to weaken the court 's ( the king 's , actually ) grip on the armed forces - selected and appointed the most loyal among officers , often without much of a second thought about their effective capabilities . 
  people like soddu and cavallero are excellent examples . 
  so cronyism , thinly disguised as the will of the * duce * , was an effective force to be reckoned with . 
  edit : please note that the duke of aosta ( who was also viceroy of ethiopia ) was pretty much * the * exception though due to him being one of the most charismatic , valiant and capable commanders the italians could count on . 
   [ ... ] would at this time , these attacks , have weakened mussolini 's position in power fatally , or was it only when it was relatively clear , in what direction the war was going that the other italian power players were in a position to do that ? 
  the fall of mussolini was mostly due to a combination of factors , with the invasion of sicily being ` just ' one of them - ascribing it to the invasion only would be reductive , and this is why i 'd consider the second hypothesis far more likely :, 
  * as i already said in a previous , overly-quoted and much-abused post of mine ... the king and mussolini had found themselves vying for power , and both wanted to shift the precarious balance of power in favour of one party or the other . 
  their relationship had become sour by the late 1930s , with victor emmanuel iii resenting his subordinate 's attempts at gaining control of the mainly royalist armed forces ( which involved subduing and weakening perceived strongholds , such as the navy , in favour of the more `` fascist '' air force ) - something that led him to back a failed palace in coup so as to get rid of the more and more war-like * duce * in march 1940 . 
  * mussolini , on the other hand , did not enjoy the vast powers his german and soviet colleagues held by having to operate in an almost-constitutional setting with a higher authority above him . 
  despite the presence of the mvsn - the party 's paramilitary ^ ** 2 ** - and his desire to get rid of the monarchy , he could not have succeeded in his goals without sparking a civil war ; the prospect of an internal conflict that would 've benefitted nobody kept the status-quo intact despite the events of 1940 , and the early course of ww2 did not alter it . 
  at least not until ... 
  by then the war was clearly lost , the empire shattered , sicily under siege and parts of rome itself bombed with great losses . 
  * that * was the straw that broke the camel 's back !, 
  this time even mussolini 's closest associates had turned their backs on their boss - the responsibility of italy 's defeat fell on him - and backed his eventual sacking . 
  two parties had united against the other , leaving the soon-to-be-ex * duce * with no choice . 
   [ ... ] with better strategy , the british could maybe have pulled of raids and airstrikes on sicily in 1941 and/or maybe invade rhodes . 
  i 'd like to disagree . 
  genoa , turin and milan had all been made subject to allied ( french and british ) air raids by 1940 ; yet , neither mussolini nor his regime did suffer that much because of it . 
  if the early bombing of three of the most important italian cities did not , in the end , matter very much - why should have a few raids over sicily ? 
  ^ ** 1 ** the coup did not go through mainly because of the * gerarchi * objecting to mussolini 's proposed successor , a much more docile costanzo ciano . 
  and the king himself did his part by getting cold feet as soon as he read the memo .
