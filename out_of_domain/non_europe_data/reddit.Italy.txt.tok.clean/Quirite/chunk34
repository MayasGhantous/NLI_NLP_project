  ^ ** 2 ** with mussolini gone , the mvsn was among the very first organisations to be liquidated too . 
  i ca n't live in a place where there are no settlements , or at the very least other people/an hospital , around . 
  my biggest fear is needing medical attention and no one 's nearby ... 
  but only if the bride 's hot . 
  you 're not alone ... last time i celebrated my birthday was back in 1998 !, 
  that one last party too was the doing of my parents , did n't like it and my only gift was a friggin ' tracksuit . 
  i also happen not to like being under the spotlight - just got out of there and threw a fit ... a bit dickish tho . 
  do n't the earphones get in your way , though ? 
  i see that , but you do n't go there to get bored either ... 
  well , did n't think about it !, 
  but progress always seems so painfully slow . 
  anyway , no , all of my friends are either worse slobs than i am or do n't live nearby so that 's not an option . 
  like ... dunno ... crunches ? 
  i mean , who does n't like them . 
  right ? 
  right ?!, 
  i always look like [ one of those people from the commercials ] ( https://youtu.be/rx7nf3cgnng?t=14 ) whenever i attempt to do some . 
  thanks for that link ( and the good advice as well !, 
   remember that progress is slow , so do n't get discouraged if something does n't work after a short amount of time . 
  you 're right , and this will need a bit of work on my part ... not exactly the most determinate guy around . 
  otoh i 'm more than willing to change my dietary habits , i have a few other concerns that demand for such a course of action . 
  what about your phone/cheap-ass mp3 player/ipod ? 
  where would you put that ? 
  it might seem like the stupidest of questions ( and it probably really is ) but i honestly do n't have the foggiest . 
  just imagine the stench ... :-p, 
  their piss does n't , tho . 
   an arm holder for your phone ? 
  it straps around your upper arm so it doesnt get in the way or fall out . 
  that 's actually a pretty smart idea , i like it !, 
  thank you too . 
  yeah , noticed that as well ... too bad the lifters in both gyms happened to be either seniors who would rather not lift and have a look at the yoga teacher 's bum or overly zealous 20-sometthing too focused on training for some obscure competition you 've never heard about . 
  as for cardio , well , i got a dislike for treadmills - watching paint dry is funnier !, 
  eh , the food at the airport really is utter shite ... perhaps i should start bringing my own . 
  that might be a good idea , not least because gyms tend to be ridiculously , outrageously overpriced where i live ... by the way , even rocky trained at home and look how he ended up !, 
  he literally broke that soviet dude . 
  on a more serious note - thanks for the suggestion . 
  that might to the trick ... personally i 'm a bit partial to edm , but only as long as it 's not overly repetitive . 
  would do !, 
  why the downvote ? 
  you 're right , in italy too it was known as `` the [ rome-berlin ] axis '' . 
  it can be argued that * germany * was actually the one being not very useful to its italian ally !, 
  as i 've already explained in another post :, 
   the german ally [ ... ] proved to be just as useful as a box of bricks when it was n't actively contrasting the italians ' own plans . 
  the two commands - thinking of north africa here - distrusted each other , the italians ' repeated requests for support and equipment ( need those 88s , mr. ciano ? 
  you shall not have them ! ), 
  or materiel ( the fleet at taranto was delivered a fraction of the fuel it was promised ) were routinely denied , the commands were plagued by disagreements , and so on . 
  no one could possibly expect such a shaky and uneasy alliance to properly work out . 
  but yes - both countries ended up being quite a weight for each other . 
   [ ... ] and above all coordination of naval power with airpower [ ... ], 
  and to think it was a deliberate choice on mussolini 's part ; his very own plans called for the weakening of the king 's grip on the country 's armed forces ( especially the navy - a royalist bastion ) in favour of those ` newer ' branches that were arguably a bit more loyal to the party , such as the royal [ italian ] air force . 
  the ` reforms ' passed from 1931/7 were actually a systematic dismantlement of the navy 's air arm , whose assets were put under the control of the ministry of air ( which was headed by italo balbo - a favourite of the * duce * ) . 
  the navy was since then forbidden to fly its own aircrafts and had to rely on the air force for protection ... 
  ... all in the name of petty disputes for power . 
  off the top of my head ... the choice to cede what were perceived as historically italian lands ( such as savoy , tracts of liguria and nice - garibaldi 's hometown ) in exchange for french help against austria was quite controversial at the time . 
  not to mention the subsequent french repression and the displacement of many local inhabitants . 
  what do you mean by `` anything major '' ? 
  technical/scientifical advances ? 
  improving civil infrastructure ? 
  it 's hard to give a response without knowing precisely what you 're looking for , and even harder is giving one without appearing as some kind of fascist supporter . 
  anyhoo - hate to be the devil 's advocate , but here you go ... 
  * the penal ( 1931 ) , civil ( 1942 ) , public safety ( 1930 ) and navigation ( 1942 again ) codes of italy - which , by the way , are still in force after having been thoroughly de-fascistified - are a product of mussolini 's government . 
  * italy 's modern driving licences , as well as the slightly unremarkable fact that the entire country now drives on the right , was mussolini 's doing . 
  before 1929 you changed side of the road depending on the city you were in ... 
  * italy 's social security intitute ( inps ) as well as the country 's very own equivalent of the osha ( inail ) were created at the behest of the fascist government , a fact any nostalgic retiree is eager to point out !, 
  * italy 's current school system , despite it having been needlessly reshaped in recent decades , is still based on two reforms ( gentile , 1923 ; bottai , 1940 ) enacted under the fascist government . 
  our entire middle school system itself actually dates back to the reform of 1940 . 
  * his revival of the italian cinematographic industry , first through the adoption of dubbing and then by the establishment of a modern , grandiose set of studios in which films ( as well as political propaganda ... ) could be produced . 
  * cinecitt\u00e0 * , also known as the `` hollywood on the tiber '' . 
  * the introduction of early television broadcasts - or , better , * radiovision * , as it was known back then ( 4 june 1939 ) . 
  however , the aforementioned tv service was hastily suspended after the country 's entry into ww2 and the few archives were either scattered or lost during the war . 
  what little remains of it can be seen below :,

  * appeasing the country 's most devout strata , as well as finally resolving the so-called `` roman question '' , by recognising a newer - not to mention considerably smalle - papal state ( today 's vatican city ; 1929 ) . 
  * securing italy 's disputed north-eastern borders by means of the treaties of rapallo ( 1922 ) and rome ( 1925 ) . 
  * the oft-quoted , trite , abused showcase example most people are acquainted with would be the lenghty , and costly , draining of the pontine marshes ( located in what is today soutern latium ) - the newly-reclaimed land was mostly split among war veterans and an awful lot of new towns ( aprilia , pomezia , littoria ... ) were founded . 
  * the much-needed modernisation of rome 's viary axes and the thorough modernisation of its rail infrastructure ( by building the city 's railway ring ; the roma-lido line ; commencing what is now line b of the metro ; the rebuild of termini station ... ) is the doing of mussolini 's government . 
  * the building of a significant portion of the country 's current council housing stock . 
  * the concurrent edification , rebuilding , renovation of countless hospitals ( e.g. 
  rome 's s. camillo , s. eugenio ) , post offices , schools , party seats , gyms and literally whatever else the guy wanted to leave a mark on . 
  * the modern aqueduct that serves most of rome too was the doing of his government ; the city does n't have to rely on some 200-year-old conduit ( monumental fountains are fed by these nowadays ) , but on the * acquedotto del peschiera * - one of the most ambitious engineering projects at the time . 
  * the rationalisation and modernisation of much of the country 's railway infrastructure ( such as the bologna-florence line , 1934 ) can arguably be considered his doing ... and so were the prototypic ` motorways ' that first connected most of the important northern cities such as turin and milan ( 1928-35 ) . 
  * the conquest of ethiopia and the ( brutal ) pacification of libya . 
  while both events were downright execrable examples of the kind of colonial policies that would 've made the belgians blush , they were very effective in :, 
   1 ) healing a major national trauma ( specifically adwa ) ;, 
   2 ) somehow kick-starting the economy ( emigration was redirected into the colonies ; colossal infrastructural projects , such as the `` way of the empire '' or the renovation of colonial capitals , were undertaken ) ;, 
   3 ) securing those possessions which , in the case of libya , were in a state of near-anarchy . 
  as you can see , there was no shortage of accomplishments . 
  but the regime 's crimes were just as numerous . 
  you 're fine ... as long as you do n't set your chick-flicks here or try to inflict some shitty travelogue upon us . 
  or start acting `` italian '' ( notice the air quotes ) just because your surname happens to end in a vowel , your coworker 's cousin 's paternal great-great-great-grandmother once went here and you have mum 's spaghetti for breakfast . 
  you 're still very much american . 
  there 's a difference between `` loving our country '' and being downright annoying , though . 
  you can do that without becoming one such person - something quite a few acquaintances of mine failed to ... 
  well , op specifically asked for thoughts * against * the united states . 
  i provided some . 
  ** p.s. 
  ** first post is actually tongue-in-cheek , in case you did n't get it . 
  perhaps op 's already aware of it , but i shall stress the fact the dodecanese was an italian possession from 1912-47 .
