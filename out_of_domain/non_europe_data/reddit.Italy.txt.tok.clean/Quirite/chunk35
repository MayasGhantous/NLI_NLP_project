  campochiaro was a model village built c. 1935 in order to host a few hundred ` settlers ' ( but note that rhodes itself was never a colony ) from northern italy and more specifically from the * val di fiemme * , in the eastern part of trentino . 
  those folks were invited to rhodes at the behest of the then-governor , mario lago , as part of a larger scheme connected with the massive construction campaign which was taking place all over the island : it also called for the establishment of a few rural communities from all over italy , these particular colonists ' task being the caretaking of local forests . 
  now , this very governor was able - by means of a rather conciliatory stance and his oculate policies - to foster a climate of relative peace and co-operation between the island 's two communities but the appointment of a far more ` fascist ' and way less pleasant successor ( cesare maria de vecchi ) was enough to spoil years of hard work . 
  the war , and then the german occupation , did the rest . 
  most settlers left between 1940 and 1943 ; a few remained until 1947 ... when rhodes was united with greece , the italians expelled , and campochiaro given its present name . 
  parts of the cloaca maxima are still in use as a ( tiny , tiny , * tiny * ) segment of rome 's sewer system . 
  a few aqueducts , such as the * aqua virgo * , are operational as well - but they only feed monumental fountains for the water they carry is untreated . 
  the pantheon 's been a catholic basilica since the 7th century ad but the building 's far older than that ... 
  ... and then there are the two bridges - cestius and fabricius - connecting the tiberine island with the rest of the city . 
  well , yes . 
  it was a temple `` to all the gods '' ( albeit that 's disputed ) , hence the name ... but regardless of the deity it may have been originally dedicated to , the pantheon 's been a religious building for * quite some time * now !, 
   the italo-turkish war, 
  which is rather significant , as the first aerial bombing in history took place during that war . 
   [ ... ] it was interesting to see more city flags flown rather than italian flags . 
  i studied in firenze and holy shit every street had the fleur de leis but really only government buildings had the italian flag . 
  i think that 's pretty normal over here . 
  oceania has always been at war with ... uh ... nevermind . 
  most of them are housing blocks . 
   [ ... ] the same 1871 the italian nationalists matched into rome . 
  actually , this happened on 20 september 1870 . 
  plus it may be worth noting how the kingdom 's very own troops - not some band of nationalists - were the ones who had been sent to rome , and those who captured it after a short siege . 
  actually , the song 's called * tripoli bel suol d'amore * . 
  `` suon ( o ) '' means `` noise '' . 
  if you have a look at the text you 'll find that it 's not even * sort of * shocking - just pure corniness from the 1910s . 
  not just rhodes , but the whole dodecanese at that . 
  it was definitely what you 'd consider `` too big of a change '' . 
  the papal states ceased to exist in 1870 , while vatican city was founded in 1929 . 
  the holy see itself , yes . 
  its political incarnation ( s ) , though , not so much ... 
  i think of it as a ` proper ' nation recognised by the others - just like the papal states were and vatican city is now . 
   a much stronger force was somehow vanquished by a small and poor african kingdom with a weak military . 
  actually , you may have gotten things the other way around - a 18,000-men-strong expeditionary force under the command of the arguably incompetent oreste baratieri ( baratter ) got lost , scattered and was subsequently ambushed during the night of the 1st of march , 1896 , by some 40,000 ethiopians armed with modern guns courtesy of france and russia ( who 'd also sent military advisors ) . 
  think of adwa as the very italian equivalent to the little big horn . 
  by the way ... it was the first italo - * abyssinian * war . 
  the ethiopians were actually the ones who had started the war first when they attacked a few italian garrisons which had been moved to the recently-occupied tigray , a region that was immediately adjacent to the colony of eritrea . 
  these very same garrisons were then put under siege and had to capitulate a few months later , with the high command 's back in asmara soon entering full-panic mode ; baratieri thought - better yet , feared - that an invasion of eritrea was imminent and to counter such a threat he saw fit to split the few forces at its disposal along the border . 
  the negus , though , successfully circumvented the defensive perimetre and managed to get as far as into adwa . 
  at this point , the two armies faced one another ... after an uneventful lull , during which the ethiopian negus proposed a truce ( whose provisions the italian gov ' t refused ) , baratieri was goaded into attacking because of a few factors :, 
  * the pressure from the prime minister himself , crispi , who demanded immediate action to be taken ;, 
  * the dwindling supplies at his troops ' disposal as well as the closeness of the enemy ;, 
  * the growing disturbances among the local population ( s ) at their rear ;, 
  * and the overly-dismissing considerations on the part of his very own staff . 
  that very same staff proposed indirectly attacking the ethiopian lines - their positions being too strong , so they thought - by means of splitting the troops for a daring night raid which would 've required nothing less than exemplary coordination to succeed ; the general was too eager to follow suit . 
  we all know how it ended ... one nasty bloodbath . 
   i 'm a bit confused on the last part . 
  did n't ethiopians raid the italians , not the other way around ? 
  the italians wanted to assail the ethiopians but got lost in the darkness , their four columns got scattered and were then ambushed by the ethiopians who had , in the meantime , gotten wind of the whole ordeal . 
  it was a bit fucked up . 
   hahahahahahahah yall think i 'm serious ? 
  yes . 
  and thirsty , i might add . 
  was there around 2004 . 
  11-year-old me was too busy looking at all those * fr\u00e4uleins * to care about the beer ... 
  indeed , but such a large gap did not prevent them from putting up a stiff defence initally ( e.g. 
  the ill-fated christmas offensive ) before being steamrolled and subsequently curb-stomped by the italians ( like at may chew ) . 
  despite losing on the field , though , they managed to start a resistance campaign that saw many remote highlands being fought over ; these groups were getting actively suppressed by the italians when the war began and after 1941 they even clashed against the settlers who were conducting their own guerrilla war under amedeo guillet 's command . 
  fiumicino wins , hands down . 
  it 's got the only beach where you can actually grow an extra limb or get a fluorescent tan . 
  `` do i make you horny , baby ... ? 
  do i ? 
  do i make you randy ?! '', 
  imperivm ? 
  ca n't they fix old bugs without creating new ones ? 
   the australian 's used the carro armatto tank with a white kangaroo painted on them for help with identification . 
  well , but `` a carro armato '' is `` a tank '' indeed ... this specific model seems to be an m11/39 . 
  someone please tell me they 've just found the only known , intact copy of the * satyricon * . 
  on a more serious note - our current minister for the conservation of old ruins and the delaying of important public works , dario franceschini , says we 're * really * going to [ rebuild the coliseum 's arena ] ( http://roma.repubblica.it/dettaglio-news/-/39377 ) this time ( link 's in italian ) . 
  also ... a few columns , whose fragments had already been excavated in 1998 , [ are being re-erected ] ( https://rometheimperialfora19952010.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/fori-imperiali-1999-2015.jpg?w=627&amp;h=321 ) in their original location within the templum pacis ; the same goes for another set of columns [ belonging to the basilica ulpia ] ( http://www.repstatic.it/content/localirep/img/rep-roma/2015/04/14/211419949-b2291c92-c9b5-45b4-a854-80ae191dbdfe.jpg ) , all made possible thanks to a consistent donation from uzbek billionaire alisher usmanov . 
  lastly , the se side of the circus maximus is being excavated and a project for an eventual recomposition of the arch of titus is in the works . 
  you can check the imperial fora 's brand new lighting [ here ] ( http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2015/04/21/foto/fori-112543176/1/#1 ) . 
  ** edit ** : if anyone wants to know what 's going on with the various restoration campaigns in rome , feel free to ask !, 
  ** edit 2 ** : they 're also restoring the mausoleum of augustus , and redeveloping the square around it ( about time ) . 
  yes , the boulevard is closed to cars/taxis ( and now buses , too , albeit this measure 's only temporary ) . 
  too bad i never had the pleasure of driving there !, 
   are most people happy with the change ? 
  the kindest thing i can say is : no , definitely not . 
  the detours we have to make can be rather annoying - not to mention sort of pointless - plus taxi drivers are ( perhaps understandably ? ), 
  not so happy about it . 
  oh , the joys of having to pay good money for a licence and then being forbidden to bring tourists wherever they want to !, 
  it 's good for the monuments and for those who visit - not so much for the people who have to live here . 
   blame mussolini for putting it there in the first place !, 
  oh boy , if i think of [ what used to be there ] ( http://www.romasparita.eu/foto-roma-sparita/tag/quartiere-alessandrino/ ) i ca n't help but weep like a little girl . 
  yep , and should be til september ( if i am not mistaken ) . 
  it 's still undergoing restoration - there 's no deadline yet , but you can check the restorers ' progress [ here ] ( http://archeoroma.beniculturali.it/cantieredomusaurea/en/ ) . 
   wait , what , they want to rebuild the arena ? 
  our very own minister confirmed that !, 
  no definitive proof , but it 's already something . 
  and being the new structures made of wood ( not to mention totally reversible ) there should be no prob ... 
   also , how accessible is the column of trajan ? 
  i 'm afraid it 's not - guess you can still look at it from below , though . 
  wait - you 've been to italy but you 've never seen a bidet ? 
  every bathroom over here 's got one ... 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  just ... how ? 
  i honestly ca n't fathom such a thing . 
  were you , by any chance , staying in some old farm located in the backass of nowhere with no indoor plumbing ? 
  ok , whatever !, 
  it 's just that my experience 's the total opposite - bidets , bidets * everywhere * . 
  despite their quasi hail corporate-esque nature i 'd highly recommend these two videos - one about [ carrier ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vjnashtdka= ) , the other about [ osram ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpffv2hs7rm ) - concerning the latest conservation efforts ( new ac/filtration system and led lighting , respectively ) that have been recently undertaken within the sistine chapel . 
  they make for an interesting watch imho .
