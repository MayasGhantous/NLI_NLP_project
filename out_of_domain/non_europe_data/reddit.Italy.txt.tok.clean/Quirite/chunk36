  fyi we 've never been bailed out by anybody - only greece has , and italy is among its creditors !, 
  seems to be the coat of arms of the house of hapsburg-lorraine - the dynasty which held the grand duchy of tuscany from 1737 onwards after having succeeded to the last of the medici , gian gastone ( what a character ! ) . 
  as a related piece of trivia ... their rule ceased in 1859 , with the italian unification . 
  straiiight out of the uncanny valley !, 
  turns out op is creepy hand model . 
  actually the first aerial ( as in : with airplanes ) bombing took place during the italo-turkish war of 1911 . 
  an italian pilot , carlo piazza , saw fit to drop a few grenades on the ottoman lines * while * piloting his bl\u00e9riot xi . 
  the turks responded by trying to shoot him down with their rifles ... and that was also the first occurrence of aa fire !, 
  as i 've already said - the royal [ italian ] aeronautical service had already experimented with aerial bombardment in 1911 , during the conquest of libya ; a few grenades were dropped over ottoman positions from a bl\u00e9riot xi .

  anyhoo , despite their quasi hail corporate-esque nature i just wanted to share again these two videos - one about [ carrier ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vjnashtdka= ) , the other about [ osram ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpffv2hs7rm ) - about the latest conservation efforts ( involving the installation of new ac/filtration system and led lighting ) that have been recently undertaken within the sistine chapel . 
  same thing goes for :, 
  * the colonnade surrounding st. peter 's square ( marbles have been cleaned ; cracks filled ; statues cleaned and thoroughly restored down to the iron fittings ; the vault 's been repainted and the roof fixed as well ) . 
  * the [ two ] ( http://www.romaspqr.it/roma/fontane/foto%20fontane/f._p.zza_s._pietro_sx.jpg ) [ fountains ] ( http://roma.andreapollett.com/s3/ft216.jpg ) in the piazza ( both have been restored ; new water filters and [ led lighting ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/the_%22ancient_fountain%22_of_st._peter%27s_square_at_night.jpg/310px-the_%22ancient_fountain%22_of_st._peter%27s_square_at_night.jpg ) are in place ) . 
  * the basilica itself ( the two wings connecting it to the colonnade are now [ painted white ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@41.901187,12.456627,3a,75y,319.7h,94.16t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sehlyvo1o9ipnpmsza26uqa!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) , as per michelangelo 's intentions , instead of the [ 19th-century ochra ] ( http://www.vitatrentina.it/var/vitatrentina/storage/images/media/cumulus/roma_piazza_san_pietro_colma_di_fedeli_in_occasione_della_canonizzazione_di_jose_maria_escriva_de_balaguer/859162-1-ita-it/roma_piazza_san_pietro_colma_di_fedeli_in_occasione_della_canonizzazione_di_jose_maria_escriva_de_balaguer_imagefull.jpg ) ; both [ the cupola ] ( http://www.repstatic.it/content/localirep/img/rep-roma/2014/12/19/195659106-ea4c7c8d-a840-4494-94d1-3d7922a0e881.jpg ) and [ the fa\u00e7ade ] ( http://d2f65ghyiczsfu.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sanpietro-638x425.jpg ) have brand-new led lights ) . 
  * the vatican library had already gotten thoroughly restored , expanded and modernised in the meantime ; literally renovated from the ground up . 
  a rather exhaustive summary can be found [ here ] ( https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=10&amp;ved=0cesqfjajahukewj3isnc--7gahuflswkhzxibaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cultura.regione.lombardia.it%2fshared%2fccurl%2f763%2f488%2fal_stelline%25202011%252003%252003_vincenti.pdf&amp;ei=06qvvbdvhaqyazzfeq&amp;usg=afqjcne-pexmkdlnjq5gg9hsau-iflivcq&amp;bvm=bv.98197061,d.bgg&amp;cad=rja ) ( in italian with plenty o ' pics ) . 
  as for rome itself :, 
  * the basilica of st. mary major too sports [ new lighting ] ( http://www.repstatic.it/content/localirep/img/rep-roma/2015/01/17/204521208-59ea4b44-fa10-40b0-85b9-9b20a8cdac28.jpg ) . 
  * the so-called `` fountain of lions '' in piazza del popolo is being worked on . 
  * the basilica of maxentius is being reinforced , as part of the works for the new metro stop , by means of a new chaining system which is currently being positioned inside the walls themselves . 
  those horrible iron fittings that have been keeping the whole shebang together since 1998/9 should hopefully be gone ... one day . 
  * the [ porticus aemilia ] ( http://www.adnkronos.com/rf/image_size_400x300/pub/adnkronos/assets/immagini/ritagli/2015/05/porticus_emilia_%20foto_b_fruttini_per_soprintendenza_archeologica_%20roma-kai--1280x960@web.jpg ) has been restored and is now open to the public . 
  the old structures that used to occupy the premises have now been demolished and the shops moved nearby , in a more decorous setting . 
  * the pyramid of cestius shines once again [ in all its glory ] ( http://www.libreriamo.it/wbresize.aspx?f=/public/news/21042015102604_sm_11765.jpg&amp;w=650&amp;h=350&amp;c=100&amp;y=jpg ) . 
  the monument 's surface has been cleaned , the cracks/gaps filled , weeds rooted out , protective coating added and its lightning rod restored as well . 
  or the maine , too . 
  actually , she 's from canada ... you would n't know her . 
  i think of it as a pretentious pastime for rich people . 
  your average italian has probably never set foot in one such theatres , and likes cinema much more ... at least in my experience . 
  yes , but then again all films are . 
  mmmh ... yes ? 
  never heard anyone complaining about it ( apart from foreigners ) . 
  dubbing is serious business over here and it used to be of very good quality ; an awful lot of our voice actors are , well , either * actors * in their own right or have become minor celebrities . 
  those who do n't like it are probably trying to learn a foreign language or are fluent in one . 
  no , it just got worse and worse in the last 20/25 years ... with the wooden acting and all . 
  plus many dubbers do n't even bother hiding their native accents anymore , can be a very jarring experience !, 
  rome ? 
  too religious ? 
  oh my ... as if the other places have n't got any churches !, 
  if you want to avoid those , then you should probably stay away from the western world as a whole . 
   when i think of france i certainly do n't think of religion at all . 
  makes sense . 
  it 's not like there are places such as that church in montmartre or even the ones at notre-dame , chartres , saint-denis ... 
   the vatican is there ... 
  i 've done my research . 
  wow . 
  just wow . 
  but , hey , do you at the very least realise that the vatican :, 
  * is not in rome ;, 
  * is not even in italy , for that matter , and ;, 
  * nobody is forcing you to visit it ? 
  i mean , you can enjoy your stay here without ever setting foot in st. peter 's . 
  not to mention the simple fact that you can actually have a look at something that is not a church ... 
   the other cities in tuscany and emilia romagna i think of art and culture . 
  good luck with * not * finding religious art there !, 
  oh boy , you 're gon na have a blast at the uffizi . 
  whatever floats your boat , mate . 
  by that logic - while i like popular musicians such as elton john or david bowie i should probably avoid large swathes of my own city like the plague just because i might not want to be anywhere near `` those evil gay people '' ... a difficult feat i reckon !, 
  man , that 's just silly . 
  notice the sarcasm , please , because you 're probably not getting any of it . 
  mine was just an example of * your very own * reasoning applied to categories other than churches or `` those evil religious folks '' - and you can now see how wonderfully that works , right ? 
  avoiding certain people or places just because of a pet peeve does n't make sense . 
  woah , that guy must 've gotten a floppy dick ... 
  not quite , but i reverted back to my natural ( roman ) accent because i was tired of talking like some friggin ' news anchorman . 
  i 've * looong * had a love-hate relationship with the local dialect , and my dad can be quite coarse when talking !, 
  i was ashamed of it so that 's why i chose to do my best not to sound like him and cover my speech up ... 
  ... until i discovered that deep inside i really did n't care at all . 
  quite liberatory if you ask me !, 
  yeah - mine was actually a very tiring , pointless effort and it did n't feel natural at all !, 
  i prefer getting lots of shit because of how i speak rather than giving a damn about what the other people may think of me . 
  any clothing store with blaring music on and/or unnecessarily abundant scents ( ... lookin ' at you , hollister ! ) . 
  plus , supermarkets . 
  all of them . 
  waiting for my gf to compare the price of every single item can be - actually , * is * an excruciating experience : i am not capable of having to wait for a whole our while she thoroughly evaluates the pros and cons of the various brands , just buy that goddamn tomato sauce already !, 
  i 'll pay the difference , no prob . 
  have a look at either little britain or blackadder - both are hysterically funny !, 
  then i 'm glad to be too old for that shit !, 
  you surely meant greece ? 
  the invasion of albania ( 1939 ) was pretty much a bloodless walk in the park . 
  \\* buffi, 
  the * ospedale israelitico * has got some good doctors , but can be expensive and a a couple of branches are truly off the beaten path ; but there 's one in the tiberine island , see if your gf can get operated there ( in any case you 'll have to book an appointment either via phone or in person ) . 
  keep in mind the awful waiting times , though ... 
  and if you manage to get an appointment at a public hospital such as the eastman ( the one in front of the umberto i , despite not being part of it ) then it 's not too bad despite its looks and reviews . 
  most dentists actually train there !, 
  what you should avoid are the city 's various asl - now * those * are run by cretins . 
  listen , you do n't know just how good you have it up there ( apart from the health system that is ) ; immigrating to italy is not a wise idea at the moment . 
  it really is n't , unless of course you 've got plenty of monies to spare . 
  and i might very well add that moving just because of an ( arguably very tenuous ) bond to our country is gon na be rather problematic at best - especially if you do n't know much about this place or its current socio-economic situation , language ( s ) , customs , suffocating red tape and whatever comes with it . 
  get the drift ? 
  so do yourself a favour and think not once , not twice but at least * thrice * before packing things up and moving here . 
  edit : and if you think the u.s. are such a joke , you 're in for some big-ass disappointment ... 
   i want to work and i would join the italian military if it could gain me citizenship . 
  good luck with that , nobody 's hiring now !, 
  plus , as / u/bbonzz already explained , you need citizenship in order to be able to join the military . 
  and even if you have it ... there 's no guarantee whatsoever that you 'll ever make through one of the ( few ) open competitions the gov ' t holds from time to time ; not least because there are legions of southerners already looking for a place within the army . 
  the army is n't even looking for * italians * at this point , let alone foreigners . 
   i do not know what to do but i can not abide by a country who harbors criminals as presidents [ ... ], 
  then you 're * so * not going to enjoy your stay here , bud . 
   is your country just as corrupt ?
