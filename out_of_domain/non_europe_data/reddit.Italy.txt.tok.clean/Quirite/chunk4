  legitimate ones are white , have the [ city 's coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/archive/d/d9/20120421223242!roma-stemma.png ) painted on the car 's door , a meter and a taxi light on the roof . 
  there are ** taxi ranks ** from which you can safely board one , so ignore all the touts at the airport !, 
  * yes , there 's definitely graffiti around the city but this does n't mean that a particular district is dangerous ; there are no gangs or ghettoes to speak of . 
  just pay attention to pickpockets in the historical centre . 
  * both a/c and heater usage are regulated by the government so do n't be surprised if you find the premises too hot/cold for your liking ; we import gas and electricity from elsewhere and these things do n't come cheap . 
  * need some medical attention ? 
  feel free to pop into the tourist medical guard post located at the * nuovo regina margherita * hospital ( on via emilio morosini , 30 - trastevere district ) . 
  it 's open 24/7 and it 's free . 
  * if it 's a ** real ** medical emergency , then just call an ambulance ( ** 118 ** ) . 
  * just get used to * carabinieri * armed with sub-machineguns . 
  everything is fine and they 're not after you ( yet ) . 
  * i suppose i do n't really have to tell you this , but you should n't dip your feet in the fountains . 
  it 's illegal . 
  * somebody call the police !, 
  note that the * carabinieri * , despite the many jokes about them , are actually quite good at their job and quicker than the police . 
  * have fun !, 
   what are piracy laws in italy like ? 
  very ineffective . 
  it also happens to be the shittiest metro line in rome . 
   siete abbonati a servizi di streaming on demand tipo spotify ? 
  here are some tips ... hope they 're helpful !, 
  * italian unis have no dorms ; they work a bit like high school in that you get into the campus , attend the lessons/study/waste your time and then get back home ( or simply out of there ) . 
  * also , you 'll be left pretty much on your own - do not expect teachers or other members of the staff to actually give a hoot about you , or your work . 
  either swim ... or sink . 
  * be prepared for ( really ) big classes as you will likely be attending your courses with tonnes of other people . 
  finding a seat might be a challenge , too , * especially * during the first year . 
  * for the love of god , do not rely on the university 's website ( s ) , which can be outdated or just plain misleading . 
  always ask the professor ( s ) instead ... and preferably not by e-mail , as a good chunk of the teachers shows an annoying tendency not to answer back . 
  * red tape . 
  lots of it . 
  the sooner you get used to it , the better . 
  * an italian university is not , imvho , the best place to look for love ( many students tend to be stressed ) . 
  * the uni 's very own cafeteria may be overpriced . 
  * finally ... professors are always right . 
  always . 
  far registrare il voto di un esame ? 
  are you serious ? 
  i thought they were ... fun ? 
  i 'm afraid yours is not a sound idea right now ( and yes , the job market really is * that * bad ) . 
  also - i know you 're looking to avoid stress , but in reality you 'll find just as much here . 
  and the ever-present antonella clerici . 
  god , i hate her ... 
  the bidet is also a godsend if you happen to suffer from piles . 
  nothing better than a stream of cool water running down your crack ... 
  i do n't know whether this is your first trip to italy or if the both of yous are into art , but getting here and not seeing rome is imvho a bit criminal . 
  you * could * skip bologna or milan and add a few days in the capital ... 
  you 've never driven in rome , have you ? 
  honestly , i feel rather detached towards most of them ... they are n't italian to me . 
  however , i find it annoying when they try to pass their traditions as `` italian '' when these clearly are not , or when they bring their supposed `` italianness '' to ridiculous extremes . 
  imho argentinians of italian descent are somewhat different , though - those in my uni spoke excellent italian , had a good grasp of the culture and realistic expectations of the country they were in . 
  [ * so ' diabolico nell ` amplesso , sprupurziunato per quel che riguarda le dimenzioni del sesso ... * ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=vc-tnvnse9c#t=304 ), 
  your claim is still false , though - yes , it 's true that there are still many regional/provincial peculiarities , as well as a plethora of rivalries , but these are mostly for laughs ; nobody takes them seriously . 
  and going as far as to say that people wo n't associate with folks from other regions is , honestly , ridiculous ... 
  also , ** latium ** - with the exception of rome , the rest of that region is criminally overlooked by tourists ( viterbo , tivoli , civita di bagnoregio , bracciano and the roman castles are all delightful places to visit and easy to reach from the capital ) . 
  genzano di roma is famous for its bread and the annual flower festival , frascati and rocca di papa for the wine , ariccia for the * porchetta * . 
  do you like parks ? 
  the gardens near ninfa di latina are wonderful . 
  if you fancy a day at the sea then you should have a look at gaeta , sperlonga , sabaudia or the pontine islands . 
  just do n't be fooled by foligno , in umbria - the town is pretty but there 's absolutely nothing to do . 
  come va , va. . . 
  in my ( not so ) humble opinion , viterbo is better than orvieto . 
  there 's plenty of them in rome , too . 
  but there 's the former papal palace , which is just as beautiful !, 
  termini ai n't that bad , the op does n't even have to avoid eye contact or something . 
  the whole issue is overblown .

  true story . 
  things can change , you know . 
  and that happened in naples , not rome ... 
  the vatican actually has [ its own train station and rail network ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rail_transport_in_vatican_city ) ( which is , unsurprisingly , connected to that of italy ) . 
  - colosseo ;, 
  - fontana di ponte sisto ;, 
  - piramide cestia ;, 
  - stadio di domiziano ;, 
  - basilica di santa maria in montesanto ;, 
  - tempio di portuno ;, 
  go to a * rosticceria * ( which is similar to a pizza parlour ) instead and have a whole roasted chicken with baked potatoes . 
  with some beer , that dish makes for a wonderful combo ... mark my words : you wo n't regret it !, 
  genio !, 
  actually , the pyramid is open and can be visited ; the so-called temple of minerva ( a nymphaeum , really ) had been long neglected but is now under restoration . 
  porta maggiore is like that because those tram lines , as well the as local traffic flows , must pass there ; the same can be said about piazzale ostiense , which is home to a busy train/metro/tram hub ... keep in mind that ours is a living city - not a museum - and that we , modern-day inhabitants , have transportation needs which are sometimes in conflict with the pre-existing antiquities . 
  the point of this whole thread is how we do n't have enough money to take properly care of every single monument in this country ... and you 're missing it . 
  but yes - we do really need those * underpaid * , overworked employees in order to keep the monuments open to the public or , if need arise , protect them from ( a few ) uncivilised tourists . 
  well , op - to begin with , rome is not the south ... 
   the linear b is great , runs very reliably , never have to wait more than 10 mins ( the trains usually stop there for 5 mins as its the end of the line ! ), 
  i 've never got the night bus but i know i could get the 38 to 5 mins from my house ( 10 mins from conca d oro ) [ ... ], 
  metro line b is great ? 
  do we even live in the same city ? 
  agree ... `` the family '' beats them all , though . 
   ha ha ca n't stand italian men like this i 'm half italian , there are a lot like this constantly criticising your food your housekeeping skills etc because they grow up with mums who just clean and cook and tend to their precious men all day they ca n't handle women who do n't give a shit about all that and have their own opinions and life , i 've met loads of italian guys like this , bunch of babies . 
  well , on the other hand i * really * am italian and i 'm afraid i have to call bs on your comment . 
  have a nice day !, 
  i always thought she looked more like a horse . 
  or a donkey . 
  or both . 
  because tarring some 30 million men with the same brush is * very * objective , is n't it ? 
  con gli arabi in genere l'importo delle fatture gravitava sempre intorno ai 50000 pippi , ovviamente non comprensivi di banali amenit\u00e0 quali macchinoni a noleggio , serate * vipparole * con relative consumazioni a base di [ * scottecese * ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs7iva19ccs&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=33 ) e via discorrendo . 
  mmmh , no ... actually things here are * not as even nearly * as bad as you describe them . 
  i 'm sorry , have to call bs at your comment .
