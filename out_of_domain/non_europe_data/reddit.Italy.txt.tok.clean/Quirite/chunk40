  fyi the `` moorish '' connotations of your surname have nothing to do with race but , rather ... with the hair colour of one of your ancestors !, 
  * moro/mora * is a ( sort of ) dialectal word referring to a man or woman with black/dark brown hair , hence the surname . 
  ** edit ** : to answer your question , op , you just happened to ran into the proverbial bundle of sticks . 
  as somebody with partly abruzzese roots myself , i can confirm that i 've never found people to give a single , let alone a bunch of , fucks about that region ; as the others pointed out it has n't gotten anything to do with the place in question but probably more with you claiming your italian heritage ... 
  ... something that can actually annoy quite a few italian-italians . 
  as for the capital city thing ... well ... that was in 1864 !, 
  and if there 's someone who might feel robbed that 'd be the florentines . 
  ( their town was the capital of italy between 1865 and 1871 ) . 
  there 's a * game life * in via candia ; another such shop is located in via duilio , near piazza dei quiriti . 
  as for record stores ... the only one i know is located in the monteverde district i 'm afraid . 
  nowadays caf\u00e9 owners can charge you whatever they please , without any help from the local gov ` t. 
  problem is : those establishments that usually cater to tourists ( the definition includes most of the places in the city centre ! ), 
  are used to overcharging them , because they are the ones who like to have their coffees sitting . 
  this would n't normally happen in a local bar ... and the owners know it !, 
  [ '' ... lei * \u00e8 * inferiore !, 
  '' ] ( https://youtu.be/-ebknk2eeh0?t=151 ), 
  somehow i tend to forget the simple fact that we 've got not one , not two but * three * rivers ... 
  btw the bridge in the background is ponte mazzini . 
  i find it slightly ironic that the building above the site used host the friggin ' national geological institute . 
  but , back in the late 1800s , construction companies cared very little about archaeological remains and when they did n't raze entire sites they blew 'em up - with gunpowder , literally . 
  as it happened to an ancient roman gate , porta collina , which had the misfortune of being located in the same plot where the new seat of the treasury was to be built !, 
  btw , the former seat of the institute is being converted into a hotel - that 's how they discovered the ruins ... 
  rome 's got lots of other , more interesting fountains anyway ... 
  * you have died of dysentery *, 
  ... seriously , now you know just how shitty those colonists had it !, 
  you called ? 
  btw you might be interested to know that in italian , the term * quirite * is still used as a literary - and slightly antiquated - synonym for `` roman '' . 
  so you 've got a few phrases such as * la nobilt\u00e0 quirite * ( the roman nobility ) , * la borghesia quirite * ( the roman burgeoisie ) and so on ... that word 's something which can be often found in historical texts . 
  in rome there 's also a square dedicated to them - [ piazza dei quiriti ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/piazza+dei+quiriti,+00192+roma,+italia/@41.9091439,12.4662078,17.25z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x132f605f7a9e03e1:0xb6ab57e4995565e2 ) , in the ward of prati . 
  and if you take a closer look at the map , you 'll notice that the surrounding streets are named after notable ancient roman personalities ( mostly ) . 
  ** a ** , ** b ** / ** b1 ** e ** c ** . 
  the word * quirite * is pronounced as [ kwee - * ree * - teh ] . 
  * quiriti * , its plural form , is pronounced [ kwee - * ree * - tee ] . 
  holy shit , it 's the architect from the matrix !, 
  by any chance , is your grandfather called hattori hanzo ? 
  i 'm afraid the story 's actually little more than a. . . story , mostly . 
  afaik what * really * happened is that mussolini saw it fit to recall a few thousand people among those born between 1902 and 1915 - all of whom had already served with the royal army as engineers and whatnot . 
  these people were about to become ineligible for military service around the time of the wars in abyssinia and spain broke out ... 
  i know of the case of one of those persons , a certain corporal major ( the italian equivalent of a pfc ) called ignazio brambilla , who had previously been discharged from the army and was en route - as a colonist - towards the newly-acquired possession when he was recalled . 
  this happened around 1937 . 
  as for the volunteers you were referring to , they were 1 ) part of the mvsn ; 2 ) sent there of their own accord ; and 3 ) in a quite logistically sound manner . 
  otoh the soldiers belonging to the rctc/pai , italy 's colonial police , did not participate in the spanish civil war for two good reasons : their corps had just been established and their presence was just too valuable in ` pacifying ' abyssinia . 
  ** sauce !, 
  luigi scarpel 's * memorie di guerra * and [ the records of the 156th `` vicenza '' division ] ( http://www.divisionevicenza.com/caduti/cadutib ) ( guy belonged to the 278th rgt . ), 
   trastevere would give a good balance of being close to all the sites , while being a bit away from it all and more charming than staying in the center, 
  roman here !, 
  feel free to ansk any question about the place ... 
  as far as touristy-ness is concerned , well ; both places actually suck . 
  i 'd suggest trying to find an accommodation in the ( much quieter , and thankfully unspoiled ) ward of * ripa * - which is located on the other side of viale trastevere . 
   day 13 - rent a car and explore the medieval hill towns, 
  is n't the plan a bit too ambitious ? 
  base yourself in florence and add another day there instead ; you can always visit siena on a day trip . 
  there 's just so much to do , and see , and whatevernot !, 
  a day trip is not enough i 'm afraid . 
  roughly two paul blarts and a half . 
  no , they really are n't . 
  first of all the ` independentist ' movements are largely irrelevant and second , the so-called referendum was actually little more than an online poll . 
  catalonia and veneto could n't be more different !, 
  they may want more fiscal authonomy but that 's pretty much it . 
  but please note that `` padania '' - unlike catalonia or scotland - is not a real entity ; and what is more important , it 's never been one . 
  in fact , it was an invention of that very same party only loosely based on geography , with no basis whatsoever in either history or culture and one which makes no sense whatsoever from a linguistic pov too . 
  in short , the concept was just as real as ruritania !, 
  not even the northern league itself pursues it anymore , always assuming that they ever did , actually ( do n't forget that the party 's complaints were always mainly * economical * and * xenophobic * in nature - they just did n't want their precious tax money to be ridistributed within the country or anything to do with those `` lazy southerners '' ... until they focused on immigrants and started benefitting from all those sweet southern votes that is ) . 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  are you guys too ashamed of your recent past ? 
  who would 've ever thought ... 
  terrorist attack ? 
  you mean the farcical demonstration that took place in 1997 , during which a few wackos drove an ` armoured ' tractor into st. mark 's square and hung a flag on the campanile ? 
  if so , we 're still laughing our arses off !, 
  as for the poll itself , many - actually most - votes came from renowned venetian heartlands such as germany , argentina , ghana ... and yes , what they want is basically fiscal autonomy in the same manner of sicily or friuli . 
  well , well . 
  as far as i could understand the planned `` attack '' would 've very probably been a copycat of the first one , which i had mentioned earlier ... for he records we used to have * real * terrorists here - south tyroleans . 
  in the '60s the government gave them authonomy ; now everything 's good and well ( mostly ) , to the point that paradoxically they 're far better off staying with us than they would be once independent or part of austria !, 
  we 've already seen , and dealt with , worse things . 
   i 'm not doubting you , but do you have a source for this ? 
  cause this is the first i 've heard of it . 
  the allegations were all over the italian newspapers - i 'm on mobile right now so ca n't provide you with links . 
  i honestly would n't know , am roman . 
  indeed - last time i had a * maritozzo * i was n't even 10 years old , mind you . 
  have n't seen one ever since !, 
  well ... the poor morale largely depended on the antiquated ( and often downright brutal ) methods , such as decimation , employed by the all more incompetent luigi cadorna - exactly the kind of man who favoured attacking at all costs , and also the one in charge of the theatre for a good chunk of the war . 
  or at least until october 1917 that is . 
  his poor planning is what had lead to twelve senseless , bloody , mostly inconclusive battles over the same river - the isonzo - which ( unsurprisingly ) caused the troops ' morale to plummet to dangerous levels . 
  he also had a tendency to never acknowledge his own failings and blame the soldiers instead when things did n't go his way , which happened pretty often . 
  those under his command were subjected to extremely harsh measures as that old man 's idea of discipline was to be applied with nothing but sheer force and terror ( by means of what were basically drumhead court-martials , whose sentences were carried on by the * carabinieri * who , in turn , were acting both as mp and barrier troops ) . 
  when cadorna was finally relieved of command in late 1917 he was replaced with armando diaz , who could n't have been any more different than his predecessor ; truly `` a father to his troops '' whose treatment was much more humane and understanding of the needs of his soldiers , many of whom were also granted much-needed leaves . 
  meanwhile , reinforcements - a couple of french , british , american and czecoslovakian divisions as well as a whole generational cohort , the so-called `` boys of 1899 '' - had joined the fight . 
  by taking advantage of the fact that the german/austrian forces had in fact over-extended during the attack and the following retreat , the italians managed to rally , slowly regain the territory lost and successfuly engage the enemy in a series of truly decisive battles - such as those along the piave , at vittorio veneto , the 2nd battle of mt. 
  grappa - which opened a new front other than the isonzo , led to further morale boosts and whose outcome ultimately caused the collapse of the enemy home front . 
  the turn of the tide can be also explained by the fact that italy itself had been dangerously close to collapse after caporetto ; both the government and the high command knew that had this last front been broken , the war would 've been lost . 
  there was no second chance ... and the troops were well aware of this . 
  the very fact that the government chose to throw whomever could hold a rifle at the enemy , including boys and the customs guard , may have helped . 
  finally , propaganda and motivation . 
  for the austrians the war was mainly a matter of honour and prestige , and one to which some of the various nationalities in the empire may or may not have been favourable to ; therefore , if the ethnic czech and italian citizens could not suffer austrian rule - and in many cases joined the `` enemy '' - the same can not be said about those slovenes and croatians who fought to the bitter after having gotten wind of the plans a future italian administration might 've had in store for them . 
  in hindsight , their fears were not entirely unjustified . 
  for the italians , ww1 too started out of ambition but in the end it had turned pretty much into a fight for survival ... and one in which the austrians , who were for a long time seen - and depicted - as the sworn enemies of the country , just had to be destroyed . 
  at all costs . 
  whatever success was further boosted by an efficient propaganda machine ( personalities like d'annunzio , luigi rizzo , enrico toti - just to name a few - helped inspire the troops with their exploits , exploits wich were in turn promptly * exploited * for the benefit of the troops and public alike ) . 
  * personal considerations *, 
  in my opinion what happened afer caporetto can truly be considered as some sort of catalytic moment in which the whole nation was literally brought together and managed , thanks to a series of factors , to fight off a common enemy .
