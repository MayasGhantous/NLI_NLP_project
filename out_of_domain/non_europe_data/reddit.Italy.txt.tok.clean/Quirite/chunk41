  lastly , i think it 'd be appropriate to draw a parallel between the soviets after stalingrad and the italians in 1917-8 . 
  ** edit ** : how could i ever write a monstrosity of the calibre of * bartolomeo * diaz ?!, 
  my brain must 've farted , hard . 
  chad , of course . 
  it 's always chad . 
  i see where you 're coming from , but i think you have to take another factor into the equation : germany . 
  not only did the two countries share very similar backgrounds , but the prussians had basically allowed italy to get the veneto back in 1866 . 
  the royal family itself - especially the queen - was very much pro-german and not that warm towards the french whom margherita had always considered as little more than a riotous bunch , or worse , jacobines in disguise . 
  now , the distrust harboured by the anti-french faction was suddenly revived in 1881 : france had just taken over tunisia of its own accord , clearly interfering with the plans of the kingdom for that area - which the government considered well within its sphere of influence ( not least because quite a few thousand italians had already settled there ) . 
  the news were generally received with shock and horror , the act denounced as nothing short of a betrayal . 
  italy 's plans for a `` place in the sun '' , and with them the country 's prestige , had been dealt a serious blow !, 
  this is the main reason as to why the versatile francesco crispi - countless times prime minister and truly a timeserver if there was ever one - saw it fit , goaded by the queen , to sign the fatal piece of paper . 
  the triple alliance was thus born ... certainly out of wedlock , and against the wishes of both peoples , but it was born nevertheless . 
  the italian public opinion did n't exactly take it kindly albeit many , both at court and within the government , felt it 'd have been in their best interests to `` just hold the nose and sign the treaty '' if only to spite the french . 
  after all austria could be safely ignored , at least for the time being , and * perhaps * italy might 've even gotten a few concessions out of it ( which it never did ) . 
  the austrians too were either unenthusiastic or , like konrad von hoetzendorf , downright hostile to any and all such proposals - even going so far as to propose a pre-emptive strike against the new ally . 
  what about fiumicino itself ? 
  i mean the town , not the airport ... 
  try the fried fish there , ge.pa.gi does it better ( but watch for the queue !, 
  truth to be told i was hoping for an interesting , or at least decent , article about student life in the capital . 
  instead i was treated to yet another of those useless blog posts choke-full of the kind of touristy clich\u00e9s which we did n't need to hear - let alone read - about for the billionth time . 
  how does any of this even have to do with study ? 
  as a roman myself , i would also like to add that this is not roman life at all ... for the city that both me and a few million other citizens/students know could n't be any more different from the superficial , postcard-y portrait seen here . 
  hint : the city 's historical centre is * not * synonymous with rome but rather , it 's the least roman of all places !, 
  line a to termini and then ~ ~ fl1 ~ ~ lex to the airport ( train ticket 's about 14 funny monies + 1,50 for the metro ) . 
  actual roman here , hope i might be able to give a ( heavily biased ) perspective !, 
   [ ... ] i experienced and saw a fair amount of negativity and attitude from locals , not a bunch but enough to think `` what the heck is this about ? 
  '' , i saw plenty of arguments on the street and it seemed like italians or people living in rome , are generally hot tempered , not just with tourists . 
  cynicism , grumpiness , our particular brand of pessimist fatalism as well as the in-yo-face attitude you just witnessed have ( unfortunately ) always been part of the roman psyche . 
  it 's not that we hate you - we do n't , albeit from time to time we * really * do - but everyone . 
  and everything that gets in our way , on our nerves ... from the mayor to the traffic police to the atac to neapolitans to the * laziali * to the gypsies to the civil servants to the bloody unions down to the arsehole who drives fast enough to run a yellow but slow enough for you to catch a red and anything in between . 
  typical big city problems , so to speak . 
  imho one can also tell tourists from locals not by the fashion but rather because the latter are usually in a rush , look either surly or straight to the pavement when walking ... 
  ... many of us have become sick , sick , * sick * of it all . 
  and it shows . 
  but i can assure you that it was n't always like this !, 
   [ ... ] the city seemed kind of like a tourist trap , i was in the city center for the most part [ ... ], 
  the historical centre is indeed a disneyland of sorts , the kind of place you do n't generally go to unless you need to traverse the city from end to end , happen to work there or have to buy something really expensive ; personally , i 've never been inside the coliseum in 20 + years of living here !, 
  but i 've visited places tourists have n't even heard about . 
  many locals ca n't help but feel excluded from the centre not least because they 're being literally pushed out of it . 
   [ ... ] i felt a strong religious vibe there , both good and bad , i wonder if anyone can touch on the present situation of christians and christianity in rome and perhaps other religions . 
  i must contradict you here - religion is pretty much absent from the lives of locals and romans ... well , italians for that matter ... could n't care less about the church , let alone the pope . 
  both are actually fairly unpopular here ( not least because of their nosy attitude/hypocritical stance towards our internal affairs as well as his holiness ' brilliant plans for making us host an extraordinary jubileum at a time in which the city 's basically broke or still recovering . 
  good jahb ) . 
  methinks your impressions come mainly from immigrants , go to st. peter 's square on a sunday morning and try to count how many locals are there ; chances are that you will need just one hand . 
  for the records - have n't set foot inside a church since 2001 ( mum really wanted a confirmation ceremony , had n't it been for her i would n't even have gotten baptised ) . 
  my case is definitely not an exception but rather , something more like the norm !, 
  btw we also have a grand mosque , some synagogues , a handful of protestant churches and a mormon temple ... 
   [ ... ] is the economy okay outside of the tourist stuff ? 
  is the economy ok outside of the tourist bubble ? 
  my guess would be no , not at all . 
  the ( few ) factories in town have long closed , the general markets have left for good , the harbour is derelict , shops/companies keep closing , unemployment has gone through the roof and all that yadda yadda yadda . 
  but still , the picture 's improving . 
  ** edit ** : i realise that what i 've written may be a tad over the top - looks like i may have got carried away somewhat , not least because we have experienced quite a few of those things first-hand . 
  and probably , the picture is not as bleak as i might 've previously thought but you get the drift . 
  i still happen to love this place though !, 
  hey , both of yous ( including u/mauisd ! ) . 
  times are indeed tough but that does n't actually mean you have much to be worried about , at the very least security-wise . 
  yes , there are pickpockets but if you stay vigilant and exercise common sense you 'll surely be fine . 
  you still wo n't be visiting a fifth-world shithole !, 
  nossir nothing like that . 
  that 's pretty much all there 's to it , and keep in mind that it 's not like everybody will be out to get you ( unless you walk four abreast on a narrow pavement or cross the road at the last moment , * now * you 'd deserve a few lashings ) . 
  secondly , you should by no means let this discourage from visiting . 
  there 's still plenty of fun to be had , you 'll just be more aware of your surroundings and perhaps start exploring outside the pre-packaged experience ; we may be hard nuts to crack but once you do you 're basically mates !, 
  as for the reason ( s ) i still enjoy this place , well - they are by and large the same everyone as to why else does ; the history , the architecture but also more personal things such as the family and friends i 've got here ... the memories i have of the city ... speaking the dialect , enjoying the cuisine ... 
  ... in other words , my own roman-ness . 
  coaches do n't depart from via marsala anymore , though , the terminus ' been moved because of roadworks ... 
   where did they move it to ? 
  according to city hall , the temporary terminus should be located in viale einaudi . 
  via salaria ? 
  ok , it does indeed have some shops but it 's not exactly a pleasure to stroll trough and it 's a bit far out . 
  btw as far as leather shoes are concerned i 'd pay a visit to hemil , in viale regina margherita ... 
  luthor . 
  naaah - what about plug bayonets , empiricism and military access for 10 turns ? 
  perhaps a trade agreement ? 
  otherwise we can always divide the ottoman provinces amoung ourselves and call it a day ... 
   how is it posible for him to be elected year after year ? 
  the answer is ... a really incompetent left and their favourite pastimes , backstabbing and infighting . 
  so incompetent , in fact , that they could have rigged the local elections in bumfuck-of-nowhere and still have lost !, 
  to be more precise , here in rome we used to have this giant hole in the ground ( malagrotta , a former quarry located some kilometres out of town ) whose proprietor was a very powerful and corrupt consortium . 
  being able to just dump the rubbish in there without having to worry about it ever again was all too convenient for the city hall , not least because those local politicos were getting kickbacks . 
  it went on from 1963 to ... last year !, 
  until recently the city did n't really have a plan worth of that name . 
  fine , but we 're not the ones you should be worrying about - watch out for those prusskies !, 
  i reckon their a.i. 
  is pretty aggressive ... 
  not good , despite the apparent `` recovery '' our government 's so confident about . 
  i see him as the left-wing equivalent of berlusconi ( minus the sex ) . 
  that is to say , all talk and no action ... but still , he 's slightly better than the rest of 'em politicians !, 
  maybe it 's just me but while his reforms have some good in them , they just seem half-baked . 
  well , but you guys sure are tall . 
  everybody ( save perhaps the dutch and germans ) is short in comparison !, 
  prostitution here is still legal , and has always been . 
  what 's not legal anymore ( since 1958 ) are brothels ... which were closed by a socialist !, 
  1 ) rome , obviously . 
  i 'm * so * not saying that just because i 'm roman !, 
  2 ) i 'd rather not start another civil war , so wait for someone else to give you an answer . 
  also , * something * * something * central italy ... 
  3 ) french : hate them . 
  swiss : hate them .
