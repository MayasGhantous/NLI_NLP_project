  austrians : depends on who you ask , but most tend to slightly dislike them . 
  slovenes : either `` who ? '', 
  or `` fuck that stupid vignette ! '' . 
  bonus points if you belong to the right and mention istria/the foibe , or just go there because you like cheap petrol and cigarettes . 
  sammarinese : renowned knife/crossbow/bb gun sellers and former tax evaders . 
  the vatican : nosy old people with a worrying penchant for international intrigue , money laundering and massive ( local ) tax fraud . 
  and sex rings . 
  empire total war , actually . 
  i do n't know whether this ( admittedly overly-quoted ) episode fits your criteria , but ... 
  ... the italian troops under the command of amedeo , duke of aosta , were granted the honours of war after their last stand at the ( second ) battle of the amba alagi ; an impressive feat during which 7,000 italians managed to hold some 40,000 commonwealth troops at bay and for a whole month , from april to may 1941 . 
  none other than mussolini ^ ** 1 ** himself granted them permission to lay their arms after they 'd run out of water , ammunition , and * men * . 
  survivors were thus allowed to capitulate honourably and without a display of surrender . 
  however , unlike perhaps the north african scenario detailed by u/duxbelisarius , the east african campaign was definitely not without hate ; those colonial * ascari * would eventually suffer much abuse and brutality at the hands of the ethiopian irregulars . 
  ^ ** 1 ** & nbsp ; this was done not without some controversy - not least because the king , being the commander-in-chief of the royal armed forces as well as one of amedeo 's closest relatives , was the one with enough authority to grant such a request . 
  secondly , by allowing the troops to stand down mussolini would 've effectively spelled the end of both the empire and the country 's colonial ambitions ( much to the dismay of some of his propagandists ) . 
  to begin with , vatican city is not necessarily synonymous with the holy see ; one is a sovereign state , the other represents the jurisdiction of the bishop of rome . 
  that palace 's owned by the latter and is located on ** italian ** soil . 
  as for the reasons as to why , shortly before the lateran treaties were to be signed it was agreed by both parties that the new state had to take as less space as possible so that the country in q. could be administered more efficiently ... 
  ... actually the first drafts of the treaties included that palace within the borders of the soon-to-be vatican city ; however , pius xi saw fit to exclude it - along with a handful of other properties located throughout rome - from becoming part of the country proper . 
  indeed , during the preliminary talks the pope appeared prone to making large concessions to the other party and therefore his * rather * accommodating disposition must 've had quite an impact !, 
  on the other hand victor emmanuel iii ( the then-king of italy ) was unwilling to cede more than what was strictly necessary so there 's also that to consider ; without any doubt his subborness , coupled with the pope 's flexible stance , contributed greatly to such a curious outcome . 
  btw my source is [ this ] ( http://www.osservatoreromano.va/it/news/lo-sgabello-del-papato ) article on the * osservatore romano * . 
  please keep in mind that the * real * italy is completely different from what you see in films . 
  and those either ignore most of the city ( such as rome ) - instead focusing on a very small area - or just portray the holy trinity of tourist cities . 
  there 's * so * much more to it than what gets usually shown !, 
  riiight , because al the other corporations obviously never attempted such despicable things ... 
  ... as if giants of the calibre of apple , or microsoft , are renowned for their commendable fiscal practices . 
   ~ ~ luxottica ~ ~ every large company in this world runs their business with a mobster mentally . 
  they have complete disregard for international tax laws and other commercial practice . 
  ftfy, 
   for a company as big at that ... they talk openly about tax evasion in the business meetings with legal . 
  apparently , so does * everyone else * . 
  who would 've ever thought ? 
  rich people trying to evade taxes !, 
  * clock tower * is second to none when it comes to silly puzzles though - in the third game there 's [ another door ] ( https://youtu.be/7c5uhzgc7c4?t=487 ) which you ca n't access because apparently , some arsehole thought that covering it in friggin ' barbed wire would have been a good idea . 
  i mean , wtf ? 
  and the game makes you thoroughly explore another building just to retrieve that pair of pliers ... 
  it took me some time to realise that the whole place was nothing more than just a big , giant waste of my time . 
  i was 14 when i bought * clock tower 3 * ... and i never got past the second level . 
  the first subordinate traumatised the shit out of me !, 
  only when the protagonist 's panic meter is full ... 
   still under restoration , sorry . 
  afaik tickets can still be bought and one can actually tour the complex while it 's being restored ... 
  ] ( https://www.comune.roma.it/pcr/resources/cms/documents/dgcdelib284_13_08_2015.pdf ), 
  the area around termini is relatively gritty but safe ... no probs whatsoever . 
  i think op might be italian , that word appears to be a calque of the ( somewhat journalistic ) term * microcriminalit\u00e0 * . 
  this is a very interesting question which can unfortunately be answered with a simple word ... something that in our case would be `` no '' . 
  sure , you had lots of references and throwbacks to supposed roman values and symbols - even to the empire of old - but in the end it was all just plain propaganda , and should therefore be taken as such . 
  also , do n't forget that the empire which was proclaimed in 1936 was in fact an * italian * one ( the purported successor to that of the romans ) and that a kingdom - the kingdom of italy - laid at its heart , whose monarch ( victor emmanuel iii ) would have probably vetoed such a proposal * should one have ever been advanced * . 
  the rumour in question is not at all true - not least because there would 've been very little , if any , coffee available to the ordinary infantryman . 
  keep in mind that such a commodity had already disappeared from the domestic market a few years before the war due to the embargo , and that only the * happy few * ( including party cadres ) had access to `` the real thing '' . 
  those serving in east africa had easier access to coffee but afaik they did n't carry a machine with them !, 
  otoh some officers ( unlike the german military , higher-ups within the * regio esercito * had separate provisions and mess halls ) appear to have been issued [ coffee machines ] ( http://caffettiere.blogspot.it/2011/07/la-caffettiera-del-regio-esercito-1940.html ) - but whether these had ever been used is debatable . 
  * ford and fun !, 
  allucinante . 
  and * il vento * , as well . 
   i was wondering whether trastevere was a bit too ... `` pretty . '', 
  as in , overly-gentrified and lacking any edge or grit . 
  oh , it definitely is ... 
  ... albeit the part right of viale trastevere ( which is actually the ward of ripa ) is slightly better in that regard . 
  oh , if only op knew that the dukes of savoy used to speak * french * at court ... 
  when will you be visiting ? 
  be advised that the streets around the station are currently undergoing roadworks , so there 's also that to consider . 
  intendo lo statuto di roma capitale ( esiste ! ) . 
  i agree . 
  * pls bring monies and riches !, 
  afaik there 's a place , called defrag , in which amateur bands ( and not ) can play their gigs . 
  it 's a bit far out from the city 's historical centre tho !, 
  com ' \u00e8 ? 
  that 's actually a variant of catalan , though , something which is only spoken within * parts * of alghero 's city centre ... 
  se ci\u00f2 significa potersi liberare di scioperi , cortei ed auto blu allora consideratemi pure a favore di milano capitale . 
   [ ... ] hopefully this is n't a common sight in a g7 country such as italy . 
  no , it definitely is n't . 
  i have never come across any such sights , and i have been living here for 20 + years !, 
  seems more like an extraordinary case of bad luck ... 
  ooops . 
  due . 
  * internet hug *, 
  romans like to migrate * en masse * either to the city 's very own beach at ostia ( sometimes even to fiumicino ... ) or to the slightly-further-away , but just as equally crowded , mass-tanning facilities located at fregene and maccarese . 
  i would n't try it . 
  personally i find our current pm , kim jong-renzi , an unsufferable sack of shit with an annoying penchant for bombastic announcements ; he 's a master at bullshitting his way through pr while too busy stumbling from an half-arsed reform to another . 
  just like his mentor and predecessor , silvio berlusconi , he 's very good at masking his very own mediocrity through overly-optimistic propaganda ... 
  ... but mr. renzi also shows a slightly worrying ( not to mention suspiciously authoritarian ) tendency as he sems to enjoy backstabbing , shitting on and then steamrolling his opponents - especially if they happen to belong to his own party and/or are democratically elected . 
  berlusconi is something we 'd all rather forget : the guy 's now senile , broke and finally irrelevant . 
  even though he used to be ( at best ) quite a divisive figure , for lack of a better word , he 's long gotten universally reviled . 
  hardly cared for the nation , let alone the south !, 
  ( btw the salerno-reggio calabria is a problem that predates him , and by a long shot ) . 
   also what does the italian people think about the current pope ? 
  a nosy old man who should stop throwing surprise parties ( also known as `` extraordinary jubilees '' ) at other people 's expenses . 
  i feel that nasal vowels are the ones making comprehension harder ... 
   how strong is religion in italy ? 
  depends on the generation . 
  older people are more likely to be practicing catholics ; younger folks , on the other hand , could n't care any less about religion ... and it 's been like that since at least the '70s , when the voters chose in favour of divorce and abortion . 
  also getting baptised/married in a church is done purely out of tradition nowadays . 
   how involved is on politics in a scale from 0 - `` not at all '' to 5 - `` level usa '' ? 
  again , it depends on a variety of factors ; many politicians are still mindful of church * caveats * but only when it benefits them . 
  older people represent a significant voting block that needs to be reckoned with !, 
  apart from that the church still tries to have a say in our internal politics from time to time but generally , most of their efforts are to no avail . 
  on that scale the vatican would score a solid 2.5 ... 
  ... keep in mind that most of its influence is * very * indirect as it is exercised through charities or other organisations , such as the boy-scouts and your occasional - if cultish - institution ( * opus dei * , * comunione e liberazione * , * legionari di cristo * , * centro culturale san giorgio * ) .
