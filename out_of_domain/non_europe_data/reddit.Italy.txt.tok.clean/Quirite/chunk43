   [ ... ] italians have always sent less mail than , say , the french or british : they prefer to talk on the phone . 
  oh , cryptolocker !, 
  si amano . 
  fine . 
  [ sorry for what ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/b40qdtraqfk?t=6 ), 
  simple , yt has a `` copy video url at current time '' option . 
   [ ... ] somalia remains among the poorest nations in the world due to british resource exploitation , and its government remains unable to enforce even the most basic of laws . 
  actually most of what is today somalia was under * italian * rule ... 
  ... and truth to be told , i would be more inclined to pin the causes of the country 's current sociopolitical woes not so much within the colonial administration * per se * ( keep in mind that somalia was never a very productive possession as there were n't that many resources to be exploited in the first place ) but rather to what came after it . 
  not least because the un-backed italian administration of 1949-1960 had different goals and methods than its predecessor . 
  simply put , the ( delicate ) process of decolonisation was too short and not gradual enough so the shaky system that came out of it showed all its weakness when confronted with its first internal threat , that is to say , the soviet-sponsored rise of siad barre in 1969 ; as it was the case with most african nations , the newly-independent country simply was n't ready to be such . 
  and thirty years of brutal dictatorhip not only took their toll but also exacerbated those underlying ethnic conficts within the country that the colonial governments had managed to suppress . 
  but seriously - this was the first , complete renovation the monument has has underwent in its history . 
  the previous interventions in 1957 , 1991 and 1998 only focused on parts of it ; restorers also needed time for a thorough check of the fountain ( the data from 1991 was no longer reliable ) and to assess the most appropriate techniques/materials that were to be used . 
  also keep in mind that only a handful of experts were working on the monument at any time . 
  finally ... both the plumbing/water treatment system have been completely re-done , as was ligthing ( the old one being dismantled and replaced by leds ) . 
  so yes , i think the time and money spent on the project are entirely justified . 
  edit : in order to dissolve ( part of ) the accretions that have accumulated over the precious marbles , the way to go is to spray nebulised water on them over many , many , * many * days . 
  this is also how they ` cleaned ' the coliseum . 
  then you have to manually apply a coat of a special biocide product that prevents moss , lichen and the like from growing between the stones so that the new filling does n't get damaged - no wonder the whole thing takes some time !, 
   i need a place to stay until i decide if i will go back to canada or stay here for longer . 
  does n't seem like you 've got much of a choice , mate - why stay here if you have nowhere to actually stay ? 
  if i found myself in a foreign country with no accommodation whatsoever then i 'd probably get back home asap ... 
  you 're welcome ... 
   [ ... ] did i list this post in the right place ? 
  afaik yes , yes you have . 
  a roma ? 
   i would have assumed that for portable rations italians would eat bread and beans rather than pasta . 
  on mobile now , but the * manuale per il graduato * ( a soldier 's handbook , 1934 edition ) does n't indeed mention pasta as part of the rations . 
  perhaps the officers ' separate mess halls and provisions may have offered such a commodity - and coffee - but the soldiers almost certainly did not have access to them . 
  especially on the battlefield , and in north africa !, 
  not least because they resorted to drink water from their vehicles ' radiators , so there was none left for cooking ... 
  as well as the fact that both the royal navy and the faa were devastatingly efficient at doing so . 
  merchant losses were staggering , especially since much of the fleet was blocked in foreign ports at the start of the conflict ... 
  ... as it had n't been recalled in a timely manner . 
  yup . 
  francesco perfetti 's research ( published in the sept/oct 2002 issue of * nuova storia contemporanea * ) , which he carried on both the king 's papers and his son 's , shows that the former - as commander-in-chief of the royal army - too was well aware of it , and backed a failed palace coup in march of 1940 aimed at replacing a now war-hungry mussolini with a far more docile , loyalist ciano in his place . 
  that 's very probably another reason the guy was executed in 1943 !, 
  * brigadiere * , prego . 
  architecturally ? 
  at the very least * not quite * . 
  however , he ( as a now-elderly senator of the kingdom ) submitted a plan to straighten the course of the tiber , at a time in which the construction of new banks had just started after the flood of 1870 . 
  said proposal also called for the elimination of the chokepoint near the tiberine island , which should 've been joined with the left bank of the river . 
  the rationale behind such a plan was not only to further protect the city - a ` bendy ' river being far more prone to floods - but also to eradicate malaria ( the tiber 's then-grassy meadows proved an ideal habitat for mosquitoes during the summer droughts ) , boost tourism , as well as to provide the city with a more direct link to the new harbour at ostia . 
  such a proposal was then duly ruled out and rejected for both political and budgetary reasons .

  nicely put , op . 
  however , i just want to point a few things out :, 
   [ ... ] the kingdom of sardinia fought by itself was the first , 1848-1849 , and it was soundly defeated by austria-hungary [ ... ], 
  ... which was n't known as austria-hungary yet , the dual monarchy being established in 1867 . 
  besides , the piedmontese were n't defeated * that * soundly ; they had won at mortara but were then defeated at novara . 
   [ ... ] the gap inbetween the start of the third war of independence in 1866 , and the end of the second in 1859 saw piedmont deploy troops south to secure important cities and areas which fell to them , some areas of which were attacked indiscriminately by emmanuele ii 's general cialdini . 
  what are you referring to exactly here ? 
  the annexation of parma , tuscany , the papal legations ? 
  the battle against the papal troops at castelfidardo ? 
  the subsequent plebiscites ? 
  which areas did cialdini ` indiscriminately ' attack ? 
  perhaps it 's just me , but i must admit i have some trouble figuring this paragraph out . 
   [ ... ] my sources for this writing are sir david gilmour 's the pursuit of italy [ ... ], 
  sorry but no , just no . 
  * the pursuit of italy * can by no means be considered a reliable work !, 
  not only it 's choke-full of factual inaccuracies but the author himself does an excellent job at perpetuating outdated notions and stereotypes . 
  mr. gilmour 's rather heavy bias shows pretty well throughout the book ... a book whose author ( a journalist ) was trying to make a point - namely that italy should n't have united in the first place . 
  furthermore his descriptions , better yet , * distortions * of historical facts and figures ( such as victor emmanuel ) tend to veer towards the farcical ; in some places the author seems to have gotten an axe to grind against the very concept of italy and italians in general . 
  in short , this is not a book i 'd recommend - and it certainly has no place in academia !, 
   [ ... ] sir gilmour 's the pursuit of italy is a wide , but detailed , history of all of italy , covering in detail after the fall of rome , up to the presidency of berlusconi . 
  edit : not a work i ` approve ' of , would not recommend ( please see previous post ) . 
  i know , i know . 
  problem is - i could n't find it among them ... 
  this one 's too old !, 
  i 'm afraid it 's not that one , either ... 
  sorry , it 's none of the two . 
  i would n't know , we should probably ask him . 
  the jubilee does n't start until the 8th of december ... 
  ... and the holiday in question is not anything big ( just like most festivities in rome ) .

  edit : volevo editare , ho cancellato . 
  except that i 've never heard anybody in italy calling espresso ... well , ` espresso ' . 
  it 's just known as ` coffee ' over here , at least in rome . 
  otoh i just ask for a coffee ... 
  well , at the very least rome gets to keep its own flag . 
  in my opinion the best answer to both question would be probably ... not very much . 
  always assuming that by `` educated '' you mean someone like your average mediaeval notary !, 
  sure , there were some brilliant minds back in the day and a decent chunk of latin works kept circulating among those who could read them ; but the vast majority of the people who would have qualified for that definition might 've only had a * very * general understanding of roman history and it was definitely not uncommon for them to filter it through their own bias , ignorance or prejudices . 
  and there 's an excellent source from which such a level of knowledge can be assessed : it 's the so-called * liber ystoriarum romanorum * , a shortish volume penned by an anonymous roman chronicler somewhere in the mid-13th century ( which got later ` translated ' - i.e. 
  rehashed - in the city 's vernacular as the * storie de troja et de roma * ) . 
  the book in question is a retelling of the early history of rome as seen by a mediaeval erudite ... and one whose knowledge of the matter was either second-hand or cursory , at best .
