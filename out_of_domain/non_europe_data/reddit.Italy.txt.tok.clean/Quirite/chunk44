  so while the anonymous author tries hard to draw parallels between the times of aeneas and those he was familiar with , many inaccuracies do in fact pepper the whole text - an endless parade of consuls and emperors keeps getting mixed up , buildings and places are routinely misidentified or referred to with their mediaeval names and the entire narrative is generally filled with what historians ( ernesto monaci and antonio pelaez , who published the only modern edition of the book in 1920 ) have determined to be ~ ~ utter bollocks ~ ~ spurious events ; most of which seem to have come straight out of the author 's own imagination . 
  but the text - despite its apparent flaws - is actually a priceless manuscript which provides us with one of the earliest examples of a roman dialect of sorts ; it is in fact one of the * very * first documenting the evolution of our vernacular . 
  ** sources **, 
  in my fairly limited experience with roman chroniclers i 've found that , by and large , most authors expressed a certain sense of longing for what they perceived as the `` good ol' days '' which were usually compared/contrasted with the lawlessness of their own times . 
  keep in mind that 13/14th-century rome was a town in decline , one in which the noble families ( now free from any meddling authority ) engaged in bloody feuds and oppressed its inhabitants !,

  as well as italy itself , eh . 
  collassino pure , ma a debita distanza . 
  a most heartfelt * thank you * for not having included mandolins in your ( pretty spiffy ) soundtrack !, 
  you the real mvp . 
   [ ... ] especially italian-americans ? 
  well , it depends on the italian-american in question ... 
  ... most of them people are chill but there are quite a few that happen to be rather , rather , * rather * annoying . 
  like that asshole , nick from nyc , who not only could n't speak a lick of italian but also tried to lecture me about what is after all my own mother tongue . 
  therefore i would be inclined to say that as long as you do n't behave like one of those assclowns who prance around claiming to be italian despite knowing jack-shit about the country and its actual culture , you should be fine . 
  that 's pretty much all there is to it . 
  nice article op !, 
  but as a roman myself - and a smoker , at that - i feel the need to add my two pence on the matter :, 
   [ ... ] no gas stations , no supermarkets , drug stores , bars , caf\u00e9s or convenience stores : only tabacc ** h ** ai . 
  most service areas along the motorways sell cigarettes ; so do an awful lot of bars . 
  and there 's no h in `` tabaccai '' . 
   [ ... ] note that the older signs say `` tabbachi e sale '' [ ... ], 
  incorrect ... all signs say sali e tabacchi ( which is also the correct spelling ) . 
   [ ... ] packets of ten cigarettes are also available in some tabaccai . 
  most * tabaccai * have packets of ten available . 
   [ ... ] the codice fiscale ( co-di - ** sheh ** fiss-cahl-eh ) [ ... ], 
  that 's a very roman pronunciation !, 
  in ` proper ' italian it should be pronounced as [ co-di - ** cheh ** fiss-cahl-eh ] though . 
  thank you for reminding us that sicily is indeed in italy , op . 
  anyhoo , that 's a nice video . 
  is it just me or does the first track have a woody allen-esque feel to it ? 
  i 'm thinking of * midnight in paris * . 
  no - thank you for being attentive to feedback !, 
   [ ... ] while the proportion may seem high to a roman , compared to the us or the uk - which is the target for this site - the proportion in rome is still very low , since in those places coverage is nearly 100 % in bars via a machine ( as well as ~ 100 % of edicole , 100 % of gas stations , and in the us even farmacie too ) . 
  oh , i did n't know that . 
  til . 
   [ ... ] anecdotally in my experience as a former smoker in rome , tobacco licences in bars have very little coverage , maye 10 % ? 
  out of the maybe 40 bars in the fairly central quartiere where i live , there is only one that sells cigarettes . 
  i think it might depend on the district in question - since yours appears to be a fairly central one it is possible that most bars there are almost exclusively geared towards tourists who just want to pop in for a coffee . 
  in my experience at least a good half of the bars does sell cigarettes but again , the place i happen to live in is actually not that central ... 
   [ ... ] note that the older signs say `` sali e tabbaci '' [ ... ], 
  ahem !, 
  sali e ta ** b ** acc ** h ** i. 
  pazienza . 
  finisco per scordarmene . 
  ma vi rendete conto ? 
  e-r-o-e !, 
  ftfy, 
   [ ... ] in italy you should n't talk negatively about the catholic church [ ... ], 
  actual italian here ( as in : from italy ) . 
  i have to call bs on that one , everybody here does ... 
  ... would n't try that with older people though !, 
  otoh i , as a roman myself , could n't care any less . 
  hell - we already have a few protestant churches , some synagogues , a mormon temple , a mosque ... 
  older women * used * to do that , but only when going to church . 
  the practice 's pretty much dead nowadays ... 
  btw the law says that you can cover your head but not your face . 
  hijabs/scarves are allowed ; burqas are not . 
  let 's be honest though , most nudists are not the kind of the people one would like to see naked !, 
  fortunatamente no . 
   sensi si ritrae , forse imbarazzato : `` is not my cup of the '' , dice [ ... ],

   [ ... ] italians pile onto public transport without even thinking about buying a ticket as well . 
  most of us have passes , though , like these [ two ] ( https://www.comune.roma.it/pcr/resources/cms/images/metrebus_card_front22222_d0.jpg ) [ tickets ] ( http://1.citynews-romatoday.stgy.it/~media/originale/67416707718533/foto-9-4.jpg ) . 
  you do n't need to validate them . 
  this is also why many * tourists * seem to think that public transportation is free , and complain when they get caught ... 
  not only that , but one should bear in mind that there were serious concerns about the quality of the ammunition used aboard italian battleships as well as the overly-restrictive approach of * supermarina * - which basically forbade italian admirals from acting autonomously unless hq permission was granted . 
  it proved to be an unsustainable burden . 
  the navy also lacked air-related assets , as they 'd been turned over to the air force for political reasons ... 
  the answer you 're looking for is actually , and perhaps surprisingly , mundane ... 
  ... by the time the appian way was being built , there was already a ( much older ) * via claudia * . 
  that 's pretty much it . 
   why only savoy and nice ? 
  the main reason for that was napoleon iii 's initial desire to draw a new border based on the ` nationality ' ( as it was understood in the 19th century ) of its inhabitants ; cavour was willing to cede savoy but nice was another matter altogether as the county in question was , he retorted , more italian than french . 
  this did n't deter napoleon from pushing his demands , though : demands which cavour was almost forced to agree in the face of an increasingly unfavourable international situation in 1858 - but not without resistance from both his cabinet and the court . 
   were these regions mostly french-speaking/french-populated ? 
  actually ... no . 
  or at the very least , * not quite * . 
  only savoy and the val d'aosta could 've been considered culturally closer to france than they were to the rest of the peninsula ; whereas the former county ( then division ) of nice was for the most part populated by ligurian speakers . 
  and i 'm saying say ` closer ' because those inhabitants were hardly french in the modern sense of the word ; they would become such , and were made to learn that language , only after 1860 . 
  instead these people belonged to different cultures and spoke either franco-proven\u00e7al dialects - like vald\u00f4tain - or languages ( occitan , savoyard ) . 
   [ ... ] in 1860 which areas were predominately italian and which areas were predominately french ? 
  again ... only the divisions ( provinces ) of ann\u00e9cy and chamb\u00e9ry - that 'd be savoy as a whole - as well as the val d'aosta , which at the time was included within the division of turin , could somehow be considered as such . 
   how much were these regions changed by 1996 ? 
  i 'd say - quite obviously - much . 
  not least because after the annexations of 1860 the italian population of nice was forcibly expelled and/or frenchified ; then in 1947 a few areas of piedmont ( briga marittima , tenda ) and liguria ( the roia valley ) were ceded as war reparations to france , which actively sought to annex the val d'aosta and ventimiglia as well . 
   what is the true cultural border between france and italy ? 
  well , i 'm afraid that you 're looking at it !, 
  apart from the areas annexed in 1947 - whose current cultural status is in all fairness unknown to me - i guess that 150 years of french rule , followed by the mass exodus of the local inhabitants and the following waves of immigrants from both the rest of france and abroad , have inevitably split the cultural border among the lines of the political one . 
  roman here ... 
  i do n't know when you visited , but you should 've seen it at night and * after * the restoration . 
  it looks even cooler now with the new lighting and all !, 
   you ca n't go in it [ ... ], 
  oh no , you totally can !, 
  just like the one at fiumicino then ( the town , not the airport ) .
