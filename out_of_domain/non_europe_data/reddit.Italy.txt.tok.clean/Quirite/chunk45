  and to think that credulous passers-by routinely elbow each other every sunday to buy the ridiculously-priced fish straight from the fishermen on the dock . 
  only thing is ... those sleazebags actually buy their fish beforehand and when they make landfall they hurriedly sprinkle salt-water on them so as to make their ` catches ' look fresh !, 
   seriously fucking italy [ ... ], 
  hey fuck you too mate !, 
   [ ... ] and it 's fascist leaning [ ... ], 
  speak for yourself , please , as most people - including myself - are n't like that . 
  nor do we share those views . 
  that 'd be the vatican , which as you ( probably do n't ) know is n't even in italy ... 
  btw you 'd be surprised to find just how many - most ? 
  - italians would actually agree with you on this one . 
   [ ... ] and mafia corruption . 
  but fyi we 've been 1 ) fighting the mafias for decades now , at a high price and 2 ) tackling that issue ; ~ ~ besides your congress runs on what can be best described as * legalised bribery * . 
  if anything our politicians still pretend it 's illegal ! ~ ~, 
   where do you think i 'm from exactly ? 
  you know , with reddit being a ( mostly ) american site i must admit i thought you too were ... 
   also , i did n't mean to offend . 
  neither did i albeit your post has quite irked me !, 
  as far as the other one is concerned , i do understand where you 're coming from - your point being a fairly solid one and i agree on all the line even though the relationship between my country , the vatican ( not the papal states ) and the various mafias that circle around it is n't as cozy/granted as a foreigner might be lead to believe . 
   [ ... ] plus , you will admit that venice stinks , right ? 
  of course it does - but only in summer . 
  btw i do n't know where you read that but puccini was definitely not a fascist ... 
  the walkway was only there during the restoration , which has * long * finished . 
  and the fountain looks amazing now that it 's working again , especially with the new lighting !, 
  well , yep . 
  the works ended last november ... 
  per qualche motivo mi hai appena fatto tornare in mente magic tv . 
  1 ) not that much different , if at all ;, 
  2 ) yes ;, 
  3 ) yes ;, 
  4 ) of course . 
  the 25th is definitely * not * what you 'd call a big holiday - in fact it 's quite low-key . 
  universit\u00e0 del nord ? 
  nice ( re ) try , charles de gaulle . 
  roman here , that keyhole is * by no means * a hidden gem !, 
  and i 'm afraid it 's gon na be a disappointment . 
  btw a shit-load of tourist vans get up that hill every day - there 's always a sizeable queue ... 
  but ... it 's neither a hidden gem nor is it anywhere near the coliseum ? 
  really ? 
  that 's * literally * the cathedral of rome and i did not find it to be particularly near imho . 
  plus the place 's even more packed these days with the jubilee and all ... 
  tourists or no tourists it 's still ... uh ... underwhelming . 
  do yourself a favour and visit the giardino degli aranci instead !, 
  wrong island , mate . 
  and the local variety of catalan is only spoken in certain parts of the city centre anyway ... 
   [ ... ] i know a lot of migrants first stop in italy , but do they stay in italy afterwards ? 
  afaik , the shortest answer would be : no ... the current economic situation is already unfavourable enough for most italians , let alone immigrants . 
  unemployment is still rife ; state benefits virtually absent ; while taxes and bureaucracy are at their usual high . 
  there 's simply no reason or incentive for them to stay here , especially at a time in which many young italians are also emigrating . 
   [ ... ] are they having a more friendly exchange with the native italians , or are things tense and unfriendly ? 
  if by unfriendly you mean that those people are generally resented and that the two ` blocs ' are as distant as they can be - with the immigrants living almost-completely separate lives at the margins of society - then yes , i guess things might be described as such . 
  but there 's also plenty of people ( often long-time residents from the ex colonies who have lived here for decades , or ` newer ' arrivals that have successfully managed to settle down , like the chinese ) who can be considered part of the community . 
  case in point : my friend ... not to mention former employer ... is married to a tunisian woman and they 've had a daughter , now in her early 20s . 
  both are as roman as i am and everybody in the neighbourhood considers them as such . 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  il caso ha voluto che il primo thread di reddit in cui sia capitato fosse [ questo qua ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/vuo8j/hey_reddit_what_are_your_worst_roommate_stories/ ) . 
  * beep *, 
  `` this accessory may not be supported '', 
  what about tronald dump ? 
  it says `` h.e. 
  benito mussolini on the beach '' . 
  that 's pretty much it . 
  in this picture mussolini appears not to have shaved his head yet so my ( educated ) guess would be the early '20s ... 
  ... sometime after 1922 anyway , for the caption describes him as `` his excellency [ the head of government ] '' . 
  do you guys actually [ study italian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_uruguayan#italian_in_education ) at school ? 
  no , fuck that drawing * and * the crappy nail art as well !, 
  sorry mate , but this entire post is a load of bullshit !, 
  the ** first italo-abyssinian war ** began in 1895 ( no tanks back then ! ), 
  after nearly a decade of intermittent cross-border skirmishes between the two nations , and it was started * by the ethiopians themselves * . 
  a 18,000-men-strong italian garrison under the command of the arguably incompetent oreste baratieri ( baratter ) got lost , scattered and was subsequently ambushed during the night of the 1st of march , 1896 , by some 40,000 ethiopians armed with modern guns courtesy of france and russia ... which were also nice enough to send some military advisors . 
  think of adwa as the very italian equivalent to isandlwana or the little big horn . 
   [ ... ] the ethiopians were actually the ones who had started the war first when they attacked a few italian garrisons which had been moved to the recently-occupied tigray , a region immediately adjacent to the new colony of eritrea . 
   these very same garrisons were besieged and then forced to capitulate a few months later , with the high command 's back in asmara soon entering full-panic mode ; baratieri thought - better , feared - that an invasion of eritrea was imminent and to counter such a threat he saw fit to split the few forces at its disposal along the border . 
   the negus , though , successfully circumvented the defensive perimetre and managed to get as far as into adwa . 
   at this point , the two armies faced one another - after an uneventful lull , during which the negus proposed a truce ( whose provisions the italian gov ' t refused ) , baratieri was goaded into attacking because of a few factors :, 
   * the pressure from the prime minister himself , crispi , who demanded immediate action to be taken ;, 
   * the dwindling food and supplies at his troops ' disposal , as well as the closeness of the enemy ;, 
   * the growing disturbances among the local population ( s ) at their rear ;, 
   * and the overly-dismissing ( read : racist ) considerations on the part of his very own staff . 
   that very same staff proposed indirectly attacking the ethiopian lines - their positions being too strong , so they thought - by means of splitting the troops for a daring night raid which would 've required nothing less than exemplary coordination to succeed . 
  baratieri was too eager to follow suit . 
  outcome : one nasty bloodbath . 
  on the other hand the ** second italo-abyssian war ** , which is the actual subject of your post , began in 1935 - and this time italy was the one doing the curbstomping !, 
  especially after the failed ethiopian offensive which had taken place that christmas . 
  there were many battles , like tembien , where the italians suffered little to no losses against the ethiopian forces ... you should also keep in mind the fact that the whole campaign was pretty much like that . 
  btw no - the italians definitely did n't ` lose all their tanks ' ( wtf dude ? ) . 
  as far as the part about getting the attention of the natives is concerned the campaign was n't a failure either : 200,000 workers as well as a number of colonists ( who were assigned plots of land ) , entrepreneurs , government bureaucrats etc. 
  were recruited to settle there and work at big-time infrastructural projects such as dams , railways , plantations , schools , hospitals , the so-called imperial road network ( which ran through italian east africa ) and the like . 
  many italian firms also opened local branches , and addis abeba itself got a pretty smashing facelift . 
  so , ` attempted ' invasion ? 
  a pretty spectacular failure ? 
  my ass !, 
  it was actually the opposite . 
  as far as that skirmish is concerned , the italians involved were actually 250 and the battlefield was [ this bridge ] ( http://www.cumpagniadiventemigliusi.it/apparati/san_luigi.jpg ) . 
  which is fairly easy to defend or to bypass ( as it happened historically ) . 
  by and by if you 're interested in last stands you might want to check out the [ siege of the amba alagi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_amba_alagi_%281941%29 ) - during which 7,000 italians managed to hold off some 41,000 commonwealth troops * for a whole month * between april and may 1941 ; they only stopped fighting after they had run out of water , ammunition ... and men . 
  pretty badass stuff !, 
   [ ... ] springwater from the appenine mountains , sometimes brought along the original roman aqueducts . 
  most ( a good 95 % ) of rome 's drinkable water comes from just two aqueducts : the acqua marcia and the peschiera-capore ... both of which are actually fairly modern ( they date back to 1870 and 1937 respectively , even though the former follows roughly the same course of an actual roman aqueduct bearing that very same name . 
  cool , ai n't it ? ) . 
  now , all those fancy monumental fountains around town * are * fed by a few of the ancient aqueducts that had been restored during the papal times but this is exactly why you should never drink from them : the water is untreated !,
