  what about freni e frizioni ? 
  should be what you 're looking for , or close enough . 
  try bir & fud , perhaps this one too may be of your liking !, 
   also in 1896 ethiopia was able to beat italy with at the very least 50 % of the army still being spear troops . 
  sorry mate - this affirmation is incorrect and it needs some context as well !, 
  hope you enjoy the copypasta . 
  the first italo-abyssinian war was started in 1895 by the ethiopians after nearly a decade of intermittent cross-border skirmishes between the two nations . 
  during such a conflict a 18,000-men-strong italian garrison under the command of the arguably incompetent oreste baratieri ( baratter ) got lost , scattered and was subsequently ambushed during the night of the 1st of march , 1896 , by some 40,000 ethiopians armed with ** modern ** guns and artillery courtesy of france and russia ... which were also nice enough to send some military advisors . 
  as i 've already had to explain in countless other posts :, 
   [ ... ] the ethiopians were actually the ones who had started the war first when they attacked a few italian garrisons which had been moved to the recently-occupied tigray , a region immediately adjacent to the new colony of eritrea . 
   these very same garrisons were besieged and then forced to capitulate a few months later , with the high command 's back in asmara soon entering full-panic mode ; baratieri thought - better , feared - that an invasion of eritrea was imminent and to counter such a threat he saw fit to split the few forces at its disposal along the border . 
   the negus , though , successfully circumvented the defensive perimetre and managed to get as far as into adwa . 
   at this point the two armies faced one another . 
  after an uneventful lull , during which the negus proposed a truce ( whose provisions the italian gov ' t refused ) , baratieri was goaded into attacking because of a few factors :, 
   * the pressure from the prime minister himself , crispi , who demanded immediate action to be taken ;, 
   * the dwindling food and supplies at his troops ' disposal , as well as the closeness of the enemy ;, 
   * the overly-dismissing ( read : racist ) considerations on the part of his very own staff ;, 
   * as well as the growing disturbances among the local population ( s ) at their rear . 
   that very same staff proposed indirectly attacking the ethiopian lines - their positions being too strong , or so they thought - by means of splitting the troops for a daring night raid which would 've required nothing less than exemplary coordination to succeed . 
  baratieri was eager to follow suit . 
  outcome : one nasty bloodbath . 
  in other words , adwa was the almost-specular italian equivalent the little big horn ( or isandlwana ) . 
  nobody is disputing that . 
  i just wanted to point out how things were more complicated than the usual * `` hurr durr those eye-talians lost to spear-wielding tribesmen !, 
  '' * circlejerk i often see on reddit . 
  btw the ethiopians did have that many men at adwa ... 
   go to ponte milvio and leave a padlock of love . 
  not only this is kind of illegal , but those padlocks get regularly removed and thrown away . 
   buy a bottle of good wine and drink it on the spanish steps . 
  which you ca n't do - the spanish steps themselves are currently under restoration and even if they were n't , eating or drinking in a monument is forbidden !, 
  op would likely incur in a hefty fine . 
  btw most italians drink beer anyway ...

   andavi all ` augusto per caso ? 
  map 's inaccurate - it does n't show the part of the julian march that was annexed by slovenia . 
  could be done but ... is n't it rather costly ? 
  especially at a time - turn 10 - in which the ` new ' provinces are n't being taxed 'cause public order and the troops are needed elsewhere ( trying to hold brandenburg is a pain in the arse ! ) . 
  edit : perhaps i should ditch protectorates altogether ? 
  already done that with denmark . 
  eh , given the sorry state of in-game diplomacy this is probably the only sensible option . 
  words to live by, 
  i. . . er ... 
  i just happen to like nice-looking borders !, 
  this said i too pulled a similar stunt on the austrians :, 
  * turn 1 - cede west prussia to austria in exchange for silesia and an alliance . 
  ditch denmark asap . 
  * turn 2 - prussia declares war on the austrians ... always does ... join the fun and siege koenigsberg . 
  * turns 3/5 - whatever 's left of the second prussian stack ( usually with a high-ranking general in tow ) will move , besiege the weaker austrian garrison in wp and capture it at what i assume to be a reasonably high cost . 
  * turns 6/8 - you literally walk into wp and get the province before the prusskies can reinforce . 
  rest for a couple of turns and then zerg-rush all the way to berlin - which has to fall within turn 10 !, 
  if it does n't , poland is fucked . 
  * turns 9/10 and beyond - this is usually when the aussies grow sick of your geopolitical shenanigans and turn the tables on you by dowing saxony . 
  without prussia hindering your advance , and the now-enemies holding two provinces less , they can be squashed easily but do keep your troops in brandenburg ( invade from silesia ) . 
  monty monty ? 
  the best ? 
  you obviously meant saint rommel the white , lord of the desert and defeater of logistics ( praise be upon him ) . 
  to be fair the italian translation too is off , as are some of the placenames . 
  ( btw zara was a province of italy , not a `` territory '' like ... post-1949 somalia or something ) . 
  why would you even want to move here in the first place ? 
  do yourself a favour and look somewhere else . 
   need job within 4/6 months of living there, 
  well , good luck with that !, 
  i only had to wait a couple of years to get anything even remotely resembling one ... 
   i want to move there to get my italian citizenship ( much faster than in my country ) so i can study in europe . 
  my family on my mother 's side is/was italian . 
  it 's your choice . 
   [ ... ] and , sorry for asking , but how did you survive so long without working ? 
  i 've always worked ( even before turning 18 ) so i do n't really imagine life without having to work . 
  pretty simple : i lived with my parents ( even though i did n't want to ) . 
  now , even with a job , i have to stay with other relatives because my wage alone would n't be enough to cover for trifles such as groceries and petrol - let alone rent !, 
  your average , uninformed italian tends to be afraid of whatever other average , uninformed italians said to be afraid of . 
  critical thinking seems in short supply around here ... 
  ok , lem me make a few things clear :, 
  ** amedeo di savoia-aosta ** is indeed the actual - and * official * - heir to the throne . 
  no questions asked . 
  ** vittorio emanuele ** was disinherited by his father in 1970 because he 1 ) married without his consent ; 2 ) tried to usurpate the late king 's prerogatives in a pathetic attempt to ennoble his bourgeoise wife ; 3 ) became a member of the p2 lodge and 4 ) got involved with `` that damn thing '' at cavallo in 1978 . 
  umberto ii was not happy , not happy at all . 
  unsurprisingly the u.m.i. 
  ( italy 's monarchist movement ) supports amedeo 's claim ; and the dude 's already been king !,
