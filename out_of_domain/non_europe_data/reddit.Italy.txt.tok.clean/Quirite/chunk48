  ** emanuele fliberto ** is the son of a former heir and was born well after his father got disinherited ; he 's * not * considered part of the royal family . 
  the guy also bears an unrecognised title ( prince of venice ) and what 's more important , he 's got no male heir ( unlike his cousin ) . 
  so in the event of a restoration the savoia-aosta would get the throne anyway . 
  she looked truly , truly hot in * pearl harbor * . 
  hell , i would 've gladly switched places with josh hartnett !, 
  you know , i hate it whenever i 'm behind one of those bastards who drive slow enough for me to catch a red light but fast enough for them to cross the road . 
  should be a criminal offence . 
  also , the kind of people who hit the brakes when turning left or right . 
  you know who you are !, 
  pokemon ? 
  che il poster di misty , gelosamente custodito in camera mia . 
  fyi the flat fare from fco to rome is $ 48 ( not 60 !, 
  geez , i thought i had read that the fare from fco was 60 quid ... need better specs !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/x4aows53akw?t=59 ) *, 
  except that the whole affair is actually little more than , uhm , unsubstantiated bullcrap . 
  the two countries were never involved in any military engagement whatsoever ... not least because they did n't , and still do n't , share a land border . 
  as for as the extra dude who * might * or * might not * have ended up with the returning ( but from where , if there was no invasion in the first place ? ), 
  liechtensteiners he could 've very well been a friendly austrian officer ( keep in mind that liechtenstein was on the same side as austria 's during the prussian war ) and given the principality 's location - sandwiched between austria/switzerland - this would make much more sense !, 
  hey , fellow ( central ) italian here !, 
  i agree with what you say but my experience is slightly different . 
   [ ... ] yeah , we mostly go with wine, 
  beer is a much more common drink , especially among the younger generations ( and by `` younger '' i really mean anyone below 50 ) whereas wine is the kind of beverage you 'd drink in a ` nicer ' setting , and something only an old person would drink regularly . 
  as far as the * aperitivo * is concerned , this is more of a northern thing !, 
  here in rome you just have a beer with your friends , unless you want to have an overpriced happy hour with crisps and sanbitt\u00e8r ... 
  ... and usually only preppie wankers tend to do that . 
  just do n't . 
  there * has * to be a reason if so many young italians are leaving en masse ... right ? 
  hell , i 'd do the same if i could afford it !, 
  do yourself a favour and stay where you are . 
  dumb colleague decided to open a * totally * legit . zip attachment from my workstation ... 
  ... aaand that 's how we got cryptolocked . 
  yay !, 
  to be fair that was the first time i 've ever had to deal with something like that . 
  besides - overworked , underpaid 18-year-old me had already run out of fucks to give !, 
  that particular workstation was n't mine yet , and the dumb colleague in question was actually the one tasked with showing me how to use some of their new programmes . 
  i learned a lot that day but quit shortly after . 
  e ' assurdo . 
  but italy 's never invaded germany in the first place ... ? 
  while i must admit that this is n't exactly my field of expertise , as a casanova aficionado myself i 'd suggest you to start by reading his very own memoirs first - the aptly-named * histoire de ma vie * that is . 
  there are currently two main editions , the most modern and reliable of which are a three-volume critical edition published by [ laffont ] ( http://www.bouquins.tm.fr/site/histoire_de_ma_vie_t1_&amp;100&amp;9782221131350.html ) and another one by [ gallimard ] ( http://www.la-pleiade.fr/catalogue/gallimard/bibliotheque-de-la-pleiade/histoire-de-ma-vie-i-ii-iii ) ; both are based on the original manuscript , now stored at the biblioth\u00e8que nationale de france . 
  i 'd recommend the former which includes a wealth of useful notes/critical commentary as well as a handy appendix containing a table of the various currencies of the time , a section devoted to the card games casanova used to play , a list of the book 's countless characters , etc. , etc. , etc. 
  the gallimard edition is on the other hand a pricey reproduction of the manuscript as it is , with all its defects and without explanatory notes of any kind what-so-ever . 
  should you ever want to peruse the handwritten original , you can find it on [ gallica ] ( http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b6000810t.f11.langfr ) . 
  edit : should 've warned you that both editions are in french !, 
  i do n't know of any reputable english translation . 
  edit/2 : * do * avoid the older editons as they 're all based either on the relatively faithful - if abridged - 1960 brockhaus-plon text ( at best ) or some 19th-century bowdlerisation . 
  you probably do n't want any of these . 
  edit/3 : as far as the laffont edition is concerned do not confuse the one of 2013 with that of 1993 , which is a partial revision of the brockhaus-plon . 
  it 's a woefully incomplete mess with plenty of misprints and assorted shenanigans !, 
  pretty sure i 've read this piece already ... 
  ... it 's almost as if the guys at cracked rehash the same articles over and over again !, 
  italy 's actually got [ two ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_aircraft_carrier_cavour ) , the [ older ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_aircraft_carrier_giuseppe_garibaldi ) of which is going to be decommissioned . 
  w i briganti !, 
  it 's 48 $ , regardless of the number of passengers . 
  i 'm about 1.70 and i 've always felt pretty average ; no worries here . 
  by the way - for the love of all that 's good and holy , * please use the metric system !, 
  the incredibly deadly viper . 
  poor thing . 
  sometimes you 'll be taller , sometimes you wo n't ; most of the times girls will be just about your height . 
  anyway , bro , you 're really overthinking it - nobody whatsoever is going to give you shit because of your height which , by the way , is * perfectly * fine at least by italian standards . 
  and i may be wrong , but i suspect this to be a far bigger deal in the u.s. than it is here ... ? 
  * get the pitchforks , op is a phony !, 
  nope nope nope ... ever heard of [ isandlwana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_isandlwana ) , where the brits got their arses handed to them by spear-wielding zulus ? 
  by the way , the conflict you 're thinking about is actually the ** first ** italo-abyssinian war ... and the battle of adwa in particular , which took place in 1896 ; well after isandlwana !, 
  hope you enjoy the custom-made copypasta mate . 
   the first italo-abyssinian war was started in 1895 by the ethiopians after nearly a decade of intermittent cross-border skirmishes between the two nations . 
  during such a conflict a 18,000-men-strong italian garrison under the command of the arguably incompetent oreste baratieri ( baratter ) got lost , scattered and was subsequently ambushed during the night of the 1st of march , 1896 , by some 40,000 ethiopians armed with ** modern ** guns and artillery courtesy of france and russia ... which were also nice enough to send some military advisors . 
   [ ... ] the ethiopians were actually the ones who had started the war first when they attacked a few italian garrisons which had been moved to the recently-occupied tigray , a region immediately adjacent to the new colony of eritrea . 
   these very same garrisons were besieged and then forced to capitulate a few months later , with the high command 's back in asmara soon entering full-panic mode ; baratieri thought - better , feared - that an invasion of eritrea was imminent and to counter such a threat he saw fit to split the few forces at its disposal along the border . 
   the negus , though , successfully circumvented the defensive perimetre and managed to get as far as into adwa . 
   at this point the two armies faced one another . 
  after an uneventful lull , during which the negus proposed a truce ( whose provisions the italian gov ' t refused ) , baratieri was goaded into attacking because of a few factors :, 
   * the pressure from the prime minister himself , crispi , who demanded immediate action to be taken ;, 
   * the dwindling food and supplies at his troops ' disposal , as well as the closeness of the enemy ;, 
   * the overly-dismissing ( read : racist ) considerations on the part of his very own staff ;, 
   * as well as the growing disturbances among the local population ( s ) at their rear . 
   that very same staff proposed indirectly attacking the ethiopian lines - their positions being too strong , or so they thought - by means of splitting the troops for a daring night raid which would 've required nothing less than exemplary coordination to succeed . 
  baratieri was eager to follow suit . 
  outcome : one nasty bloodbath . 
   in other words , adwa was the almost-specular italian equivalent the little big horn . 
  otoh the ** second ** italo-abyssinian war , which lasted from 1935 to 1936 , was pretty successful . 
  * that * was the one conflict where the italians had tanks , planes and whatever ... 
  i was there for three years , why did n't all those chicks harass me ? 
  the changing of the guard has to be the most ... underwhelming , disappointing and overall discomforting experience i 've ever had the misfortune of living ; the very fact that i was literally being pressed * through * the palace 's fence for like an hour ( in the rain ) while the military band played a shitty rendition of a popular christmas song did n't help , either . 
  the english countryside is fairly nice , tho !, 
  also - i thought the big ben was taller , and louder ? 
  that 's spanish though . 
  in italian that 'd be :, 
  ne so qualcosa . 
  there , i said it . 
  sorpresa !, 
   [ ... ] italy did n't find sardinia or piedmont in a different country after the war . 
  actually - italy did lose istria , many of whose italian-speaking inhabitants were [ expelled ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istrian_exodus ) or outright [ murdered ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foibe_massacres ) . 
  username checks out !, 
  afaik there 's a palace on via cavour that * is believed * to have been a borgia property , but it 's actually all bullcrap . 
  hell , even the so-called `` borgia tower '' there did n't really belong to them !, 
  alternatively you can go to a place near piazza campo de ' fiori and have a look at whatever remains of vannozza 's own tavern ... which is unfortunately [ not much ] ( https://eu.ixquick-proxy.com/do/spg/show_picture.pl?l=english_uk&amp;rais=1&amp;oiu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nuok.it%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f06%2fvicolo-gallo-stemma-caetani-592x427.jpg&amp;sp=e668253c5c69fddc5c58dbc0ec792e70 ) . 
  both rodrigo and his uncle ( callixtus iii ) are buried at s. maria in monserrato so there 's that to see . 
  there used to be a family home near corso vittorio ( in what was once piazza pizzo di merlo ) but unless you 're a time-traveler you wo n't be able to see it , as the whole place was bulldozed around 1885/88 . 
  anyway , why obsess over the much-maligned borgia when the cenci were just as bad , if not worse , and their properties have actually survived the test of time ?
