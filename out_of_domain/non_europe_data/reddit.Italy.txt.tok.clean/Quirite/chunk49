  the sad , * sad * tale of beatrice is so sick that not even george r.r. 
  martin could have made it up . 
  mark my words . 
  not op , but as another roman myself i 'd just raze the city centre and build a 8-lane elevated motorway in its place . 
  one can only dream . 
  you ca n't imagine just how annoying it is to ( circum ) navigate - whenever you have to get somewhere else in the city there 's no way you could somehow avoid it . 
  it 's a royal pain in the arse but , hey , nobody lives in there anyway !, 
  live here for a few years , get a car and you 'll suddenly understand what i 'm talking about . 
   [ ... ] the people feel as being on the winning side [ ... ], 
  sorry but that 's some military-grade bs right there !, 
  we lost the war and got handed a punitive [ peace treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_peace_treaties,_1947 ) , without mentioning [ all ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istrian_exodus ) [ the crap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foibe_massacres ) that went down in istria and dalmatia . 
  i 've yet to meet another italian who claims otherwise ... 
   [ ... ] the previous invasion italy had attempted on it , in 1895/1896 [ ... ], 
  except that it was the other way around - in 1895 it was * ethiopia * which attacked the italian garrisons in eritrea . 
  and to be even more fair , it 's not like the austrians themselves were totally * not * planning a pre-emptive strike on italy as early as 1908 !, 
  this goes without mentioning the discriminatory treatment of italian minorities within the empire . 
  truly wonderful allies indeed ... ca n't really fathom why we ended up doing what we did ; especially if you consider that the very same empire also happened to oppress us for 200 + years , actively opposing any attempt at unification . 
   was the savoia family really that hated ? 
  no - not really , and not all over italy . 
  let 's just say that our teachers tend to have a. . . uhm ... bias of sorts . 
   also , were you taught of any fighting in kenya ? 
  yes , and more specifically the [ east african campaign ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_african_campaign_ ( world_war_ii ) - especially the siege at the amba alagi ( where 3,000 italians under the duke of aosta managed to hold off some 41,000 commonwealth troops for two months in april/may 1941 ) . 
  btw this is also why rome got a road tunnel and not just one , but * two * bridges named after that badass !, 
  pazienza . 
   when mussolini took power , people looked to the king and his family to try and stop him , but they did nothing . 
  sorry to bother you again but i feel that this part is not entirely true and needs more context/explaining anyway . 
  i 'll be shamelessly recycling an old post of mine so as to properly explain the power dynamics of fascist italy , so ... 
  ... enjoy the copypasta !, 
  italy was , at least technically , still a monarchy and mussolini a prime minister ; but his powers and those of the king had become more and more balanced over time and the two were , in a sense , ` forced ' to co-operate as neither could have gotten rid of the other by himself ; mussolini wanted to overthrow victor emmanuel iii sooner or later , but that would have probably lead to civil war . 
  both the army and the navy were loyal to the king ; indeed , they had sworn loyalty to him and not to mussolini . 
  however , he had the militia ( m.v.s.n. ), 
  and the fascist party - whose * gerarchi * ( most prominent members ) sat in the so-called grand council of fascism - behind him . 
  now , any successful attempt at getting rid of one party by the other would 've needed the intervention of either an external force or someone who could 've tipped the balance of power ; victor emmanuel 's attempted coup of march 1940 , in which he sought to replace a more and more war-like mussolini with a loyal galeazzo ciano , could n't be carried through because of the grand council 's opposition to such plans and the king 's own indecisiveness . 
  however , by 1943 the situation had changed - mussolini was now rather unpopular even among his own as his actions had clearly brought italy to ruin ; the invasion of sicily and the allied bombing of rome a few days earlier proved to be the last straw . 
  both the grand council and the king now shared the same goal , and an exhautorated mussolini was in no position to resist : on july 25th , 1943 , the council approved the so-called * ordine del giorno grandi * which was effectively a vote of no-confidence ... mussolini learnt of this and asked the king to receive him at the quirinal . 
  and after a brief meeting , he was sacked and arrested . 
   to this day the savoia family is still fervently hated by the italians because of this [ ... ], 
  actually , i feel this has more to do with far more recent events , and more specifically the actions of a * certain * member of the family in question . 
  of course the king 's ( often misunderstood ) course of action did n't help their reputation . 
  not op , but :, 
  * captain corelli 's mandolin * is , in my humble opinion , a shitty cringefest of a film which happens to be based on a slightly more enjoyable book which , in turn , is based on a real story . 
  speaking of which - the film in question does n't do any justice whatsoever to the historical characters and events it is actually supposed to portray . 
  there , i said it !, 
  btw what 's with nic cage 's horrid attempt at an accent and inability to act ? 
  how did he get there in the first place ? 
  * i can handle it maaan !, 
  anyway , he 's still a better actor than sofia coppola . 
  that 's for sure !, 
  unfortunately i 've never seen that other film so i ca n't help you with it . 
  * crickets intensify *, 
  i am saddened , confused and probably in need of a cardiologist . 
  never again !, 
  edit : [ puntualissimi ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4r836h/body_of_missing_college_student_beau_solomon/?ref=search_posts ) come sempre !, 
   [ ... ] leading to the british taking over the administration of the entire region . 
  eventually , somalia gained independence in 1960 . 
  while i enjoyed the rest of your - admittedly , rather impressive !, 
  - writeup i should probably point out that postwar italian somalia was in fact still administered by the italians themselves as a un trust territory from 1949 to july 1960 . 
  in italy napoleon has a somewhat-mixed reputation ... on one hand he was the greatest general of his time , as well as the man who ousted a bunch of backward petty tyrants and brought a fresh wind of change throughout the peninsula ( which helped kickstart the push for unification ) . 
  on the other he was an opportunistic traitor of the worst kind , the very asshole who partitioned venetia and gifted it - along with istria and the dalmatian coast - to the austrians `` because of reasons '' , therefore placing much of northern italy under their yoke for the rest of the century . 
  his nephew , despite all his faults , was better and that 's why there are so many places named after napoleon ... 
  ... the third . 
  ** alle medie ** : divina commedia e promessi sposi .

  one word : vignette . 
  besides the aforementioned , ill-concealed sense of superiority toward their neighbours there 's also the constant bitching about italians ( i happen to be one and i wish we did n't have to cross that damn border from time to time ) . 
  you 're not alone ; i 'm italian and ( until very recently ) we used to have some family there . 
  most of the times we 've never had a ` real ' problem like you did but there always seemed to be some arsehole looking for trouble !, 
  at least the younger generations appear chiller overall so there 's also that ... 
  * confession time *, 
  non so come attaccare bottone . 
  so ' probblemi . 
   [ ... ] the border departs from the alpine ridge-line very few times ( notably tenda and briga ) [ ... ], 
  speaking of which , these two were ceded to france relatively recently - in 1947 . 
  will do ... as soon as i 'm finished browsing reddit . 
  personally , i just use diceware to generate mine ( and they 're at least 50 characters , or 10 words , long ) . 
  of course they include numbers , spaces , random capitalisations , special characters , etc. 
  yeah , definitely * not * exaggerating at all ... 
  `` italian men '', 
  for the records , i happen to be one ; and i know that there 's plenty of shitheads over here ... just like in most countries . 
  but does that mean we 're all like that ? 
  i am not , and neither is the vast majority of the people i know . 
  you just ca n't tar some 60 milllion people with the same brush ffs !, 
  see ? 
  now that 's a fairer assessment . 
  even though , in my opinion , it still does n't quite reflect the actual state of things ; the saddos who like to hang near tourist hotspots and bother foreigners are , thankfully , a small minority of us - but a * very * visible one nonetheless . 
  oh , but why am i even arguing on r/worldnews ... 
  era un po ' che mancavo da reddit , sono capitato su [ r/worldnews ] ( https://reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4yp8cp/child_refugees_sexually_abused_by_italian_men/ ) e mi la cosa mi ha un po ' rovinato la giornata . 
  depends on the italian-american in question ; most of them are actually swell people ... there is however a rather vocal , not to say crass , minority that tends to behave like some caricature of an `` italian '' . 
  now * they * do come across as assholes and we tend not to like them . 
  anglo journalism at its finest . 
  but , hey , they 've been throwing shit at us for the last 150 years !, 
  no wonder they got pretty good at it ... 
  * silently cries in a corner *, 
   [ ... ] the general attitude of locals towards outsiders ( mainly , non-italian speakers ) is not at all the typical southern italian warmth . 
  well , rome is definitely not part of the south ; that may have something to do with it !, 
  ( this is * central * italy we 're talking about ) . 
   the thing is , would you say that there is such a difference in general attitude right between the south and center the lazio region ? 
  it depends on quite a few factors - southern latium is n't a monolithic entity and as such it can vary wildly . 
  there 's the * agro pontino * which has very strong roman , ciociarian ( is that even a word ? ), 
  and emilian/venetian influences ; go down there , tell 'em they 're southerners and see how they react !,
