   [ ... ] italy changed sides near the end and were counted amongst the victors . 
  no , we were n't counted amongst the victors , and for a good reason : we *** lost *** the war . 
  otherwise why did we have to pay hefty war reparations , dismantle half of our navy , renounce to all our colonies and cede a good chunk of our northern territory to yugoslavia ( and to a minor extent , france ) ? 
  the article on [ wikitravel ] ( http://wikitravel.org/en/rome ) is more complete ( and up-to-date ) . 
  yeah , i get how wikivoyage is more user-based than wikitravel is . 
  but i was just pointing out the fact that wikitravel has got more ( complete , and accurate ) content . 
  consent is [ fun ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvhyvupeqki ) !, 
  i actually never said that romanians are gypsies ... 
  well , there are other differences ... 
  ... students , to give you an idea , do not change class every hour or so ; it 's the teachers who do that . 
  also , you usually stay with the same classmates for the whole elementary/middle/high school years . 
  moreover , they 're expected to address the teacher or the headmaster by using the * lei * - unless the professor in question prefers an informal environment or does n't mind being addressed in a more colloquial way . 
  in my experience , teachers were always a bit stiff in that regard . 
  i think someone already mentioned it but , high school students have to go to school on saturdays too . 
  whenever a teacher enters the classroom students stand up ( you sit down when the lesson begins or he/she says you can do so ) . 
  there are almost no sports , no teams , no stadia , no lockers ( we bring our books from home ) and quite a few schools do n't even have gyms ; in ms we played volleyball in the parking lot . 
  the buildings themselves tend to be old and quite grey-ish ... 
  '' , `` una cancellata di luce al colosseo !, 
  avoid trevi fountain , as it is currently covered in scaffolding . 
  e ' quasi peggio di [ parentesi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvh65w-xqs8 ) [ tonde ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awi8sr_bmwg ) . 
  `` one man 's heaven is another man 's hell '', 
  oh , good , here we go with the rome-bashing again ... 
  yeah , i 'm definitely late ( sorry ! ), 
  but : the scavi tour is still being offered , it is actually * very * popular with tourists and tickets sell out quickly . 
  op , book in advance !, 
  or french . 
  either way , you do n't really kiss the cheek ( and you 'd only do that with family ) . 
   so an example of this could be a common interest for futbol, 
  fyi , * futbol * is a spanish word - we just call it * calcio * . 
  italian here - we 've got * avantieri * / * ieri l'altro * / * l'altro ieri * ( ereyesterday ) and * dopodomani * ( overmorrow ) . 
  note that both * avantieri * e * ieri l'altro * are perceived as being quite antiquated ; also , the former is mostly used by southerners while the other one is just plain old ( or literary ) . 
  * l'altro ieri * is fairly common , as is * dopodomani * . 
  if you do n't pay , you 'll have to deal with a credit collection agency back in the us . 
  i 'm afraid there 's no way out . 
  i think it may have something to do with president wilson 's meddling and his ( somewhat incoherent ) support for self-determination . 
  also , the italian delegates left the conference early and were awarded only a part of what they were promised , mainly territories in the country 's north-east ... 
  anyway , italy did n't quite `` lose '' its grip on the country . 
  even after ww1 , albania was well within in the italian sphere of influence despite it being ( at least nominally ) independent . 
  and a few years after , with the rise of fascism , it soon became to italy what manchukuo was to japan only to be flat-out annexed in 1939 . 
  the kingdom of the two sicilies was certainly at the forefront , in * some * respects : for example , one of the first manifactures ( the china factory at capodimonte ) and the first railway system in the peninsula were built there . 
  the problem is - they did n't go much further . 
  moreover , these few advances were counterbalanced by cons such as :, 
  * an archaic , staunchly reactionary , inept government plagued by inefficiency and corruption which was headed by a demi-absolute monarch from a foreign dinasty , who was neither loved nor feared by its people ;, 
  * plenty of localistic issues , seeing that the kingdom itself was sort of an artificial creation conceived as as result of the congress of vienna : the old kingdoms of naples and sicily were united in 1816 , and naples itself became the new capital . 
  the move - as well as the lack of a constitution - angered many sicilians , who often revolted against the central government and wasted no time in siding with the * garibaldini * in 1860 ;, 
  * a large and relatively modern military ( whose fleet was on par , if not superior , to that of sardinia ) with a terrible officer corps , whose members were chosen not because of their merits but thanks to their ascendancy and/or the good offices of their relatives . 
  moreover , both the soldiers and the officers themselves had little allegiance to the crown - many were just in for the money ( see above ) . 
  * a bigoted , penniless nobility who owned much of the land but acted as absentee landlords ;, 
  * an almost non-existent middle class , coupled with the lack of an healthy entrepreneurial spirit ;, 
  * crime was rife * well before * unification . 
  the barons themselves had armed bands at their disposal which were assigned with the task of protecting their properties or suppress any of the peasants ' claims for more land ( these bands would later evolve to what we know today as the mafia ) . 
  it is true , however , that the wife of the now-exilied king francis funded some of these bands ( and the * briganti * ) in order to sow dissent within the new kingdom , and hopefully start a popular revolt which would have brought her back on the throne . 
  maria sofia also sided with the austrians against the now-united italy during ww1 . 
  * widespread poverty , low literacy , health concerns ( both southern and central italy were rife with malaria while naples itself was dirty , overcrowded , had no sewage system and was prone to epidemics ) . 
  we still have ** november 4th ** ( `` victory day '' ) as a public holiday . 
  the celebrations would have been started by the * corazzieri * , who would lay a wreath in front of the tomb of the unknown soldier ( which is located at the vittoriano ) , with the king and mussolini standing nearby . 
  a military parade would have then take place at via dei fori imperiali - hell , it was built for that very purpose !, 
  - and finally , there would be yet another speech ; the king usually delivered his by radio , mussolini liked to harangue the crowd from the balcony at piazza venezia . 
  the tradition continues to this day : both the president and our prime minister go to the altar of fatherland and pay their respects to the fallen with a wreath . 
  but nowadays , all is very low-key ( no parades due to budget concerns ) . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  however , i would like to point out that malaria was rampant in the countryside . 
  the southern part of what is now latium ( which belonged in part to the papal states and the two sicilies ) used to be rife with it until the 1930s . 
  but yes , you 're right about the sewage !, 
  while here was indeed such a system , it was n't sufficient and had the issues you just pointed out ... now , as far as good books are concerned i 'm a fan of the * storia d'italia * by indro montanelli and roberto gervaso . 
  it 's really good quality and virtually ubiquitous over here , but it 's in italian ; i do n't know whether there is any english translation yet . 
  yes . 
  if you 're no longer here to pay the fine , hertz will provide the police with your contact info and they will likely cede your debt to an overseas collection agency ... but this might take some time , even 6/8 months . 
  indeed , when you get your ticket they might have even apply a surcharge . 
  if i were you , i 'd pay asap . 
  no , but the papal states tried more than once to `` have a say '' ( read : meddle ) in that nation 's internal politics or flat-out annex it ; last time it happened in 1749 , under cardinal alberoni 's ultimately unsuccessful expedition . 
  meaning that the papal states managed to annex it , but the whole affair caused an international shitstorm ; therefore , the pope was pretty much forced to relinquish any and all claims to san marino . 
   only found in palermo sicily, 
  i think we already know that palermo is in sicily , no need to specify ... 
  coccotello !, 
   ... for breakfast , they only have sausage , bacon , maple syrup on pancakes with whipped cream and drink butter . 
  and not just any butter , but * peanut * butter . 
  jeez . 
  i ca n't speak for poland , but there are lots of people of italian descent out there . 
  however - only the descendants whose paternal ancestor had died after march 17th , 1861 while still in possession of their italian citizenship are eligible to become citizens ; if you only have a maternal ancestor , you need to have been born in or after january 1st , 1948 ( the date in which our current constitution was enacted ) . 
  but it 's actually a bit more complicated than that ... 
   [ ... ] it sucks they can only be your parents . 
  i do n't think that you need to have an italian * parent * - the law in question reads : `` an ancestor '' . 
  as far as i could tell , yes ; but they need not to have renounced their italian citizenship before august 15th , 1992 , as the old royal decrees were still in force . 
  as i said , this is a juridical quagmire - you 'd better ask a consul !, 
  [ pangiallo romano ] ( http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/pangiallo ) . 
  you mean pescara ? 
  that 's in abruzzo ( central italy ) and would seem to explain the accent , which can indeed be confused for a southern one despite it sounding like a weird mixture of roman and neapolitan ... anyway , no clue about the game . 
  could it be a regional variant of [ * asso pigliatutto * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scopa#scopa_d.27assi_.28asso_piglia_tutto.29 ) ? 
  confermo . 
  o no ? 
  ama ? 
  viva , viva !, 
  no no , \u00e8 amedeo . 
  need i say more ? 
  prego !, 
  figurati !, 
  could that be * la campana di san giusto * ( also known as * le ragazze di trieste * ) ? 
  also - it 's not like the city itself switched allegiances , we just re-took it from the austrians . 
   fires per year in italy ?
