  the italo-abyssinian war of 1895 otoh saw some 140.000 ethiopians with artillery , modern firearms , as well as advisors from france and russia ambush a 18.000-men-strong italian-eritrean-somalian garrison . 
  at night . 
  of course it was a bloodbath . 
  btw for your own information the ethiopians ' so-called ` finest hour ' included them gladly torturing , enslaving , maiming or otherwise dismembering most of the eritrean and somalian auxiliaries that had been captured . 
  not exactly a shining moment in history . 
  edit : and it 's not like other western militaries did n't suffer similar defeats , just look at isandlwana ( featuring literal , spear-armed zulus ) or the botched invasion of afghanistan . 
  or the maratha insurgency . 
  or the boer war , even . 
   [ . . ] italian field rations were comprised of dry pasta . 
  which needed to be cooked in water . 
  this is actually a myth ; italian rations did not , in fact , include pasta . 
  even the officer 's mess halls - they used to dine separately from soldiers and depended from a different supply chain - were actually not that much more furnished than those of their subordinates , with coffee and some alcohol being almost the only luxuries they had . 
  and soldiers were literally drinking water out of their own vehicles ' radiators so , no way to cook pasta . 
  aaaand that 's inaccurate ; pasta was not part of the italian field rations . 
  not least because there simply was n't enough water to boil it in . 
  i think your grandfather may have been * slightly * biased or something ? 
  look no further than the siege of the amba alagi , where 3000 italians ( including their eritrean/somalian allies ) under the duke of aosta managed to hold off some 40,000 commonwealth troops for two months in 1941 . 
  or the raids at alexandria , souda bay , gibraltar . 
  or sinking convoys during operation pedestal . 
  or the invasion of british somaliland in 1940 . 
  or breaking out of the pocket at nikolajewka . 
  or the counter-attacks at kasserine . 
  or the battle at cape teulada . 
  or the resistance at augusta . 
  or the italian colonists ' very own guerrilla war in east africa ( 1941-3 ) against both commonwealth troops and ethiopian irregulars . 
  there 's plenty of examples . 
  king victor emmanuel iii , at the urging of many senior admirals , actually supported a failed palace coup in march 1940 which should have deposed mussolini and replaced him with a more docile ( or less warlike ) galeazzo ciano . 
  the plan did n't proceed due to the opposition of the grand council of fascism - think of a politburo of sorts - it being the only force which could 've tipped the balance of power between the duce and the king in favour of one party . 
   italian incompetence was a hallmark of the interwar years . 
  mussolini lost his entire air force in 1927 . 
  where dafaq did you hear that ? 
  i would like to see some sources , if you do n't mind me asking . 
   [ ... ] italy 's initial invasion of abyssinia , where thousands of rifle-wielding soldiers were driven back into the sea by people armed with spears and grass skirts , was another warning sign . 
  sigh . 
  i believe you 're referencing to the first italo-abyssinian war of 1895 , right ? 
  if so , you should probably know that :, 
  * the ethiopian troops at adwa outnumbered the italian-eritrean-somalian garrison almost by 10 to 1 ( 140.000 vs 18.000 ) . 
  * ethiopian troops were far from being `` armed with spears and grass gowns '' ( but the zulus at isandlwana certainly were ! ) . 
  in fact , in addition to modern firearms they also had artillery and military advisors from france and russia . 
  * they ambushed the italians . 
  at night . 
  unsurprisingly , a bloodbath ensued . 
  * for comparison , this was italy 's very own equivalent of the little big horn . 
  * the invasion of ethiopia of 1935 otoh was a curb-stomping contest . 
  honestly , it 's not that fair to base the whole war on a single episode at the narrow pont-saint-louis ( a bridge that can easily be defended by a single man with a machinegun , surrounded by mountains on one side , a crag below it and the sea on the other ) . 
  besides - only 250 italians attacked it as part of a diversionary tactic which saw the rest of their division successfully bypassing the bottleneck in question and taking out the coastal batteries . 
  fair enough ( and sorry to hear about that !, 
  must 've sucked ) . 
  infatti ho un x200 con tanto di libreboot ( thinkpad masterrace ) . 
  eh , sounds like my grandpa ... in a way . 
  in addition of having to fight the war on home soil he had his bank accounts , social security payments and property seized by gaddafi 's newly-established government in 1969 , only for him and his family [ to be expelled in 1970 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/day_of_revenge ) . 
  even cemeteries and war graves were emptied almost overnight . 
  he does n't have an healthy relationship with his past . 
  yep , it was really that bad and it definitely scarred him ; to date he still did n't get his money . 
  family had to relocate back to italy ( afaik they were initially hosted in a transit camp ) but later my grandfather was granted a council house . 
  you 'd be surprised to learn just how many people here actually came from far-away places like libya or east africa . 
  anyway , it was good talkin ' to you too !, 
  ** tl ; dr ** - while slavery is certainly too harsh of a word the conditions of the southern peasantry of the time were far from ideal . 
  historically , the lower agrarian classes of sicily ( and southern italy ) did not own the land they cultivated ; much of it was divided into large , unproductive latifundia with most of them being in the hands of a small number of mostly noble , mainly urban and often absentee landlords . 
  due to the aforementioned state of things the institution of * mezzadria * ( tenanted farming ) , while commonplace in the central and northern parts of the peninsula , was not widespread in the rural south whose peasants led fairly miserable lives ( even by contemporary standards ) and were for the longest time denied equal access to the same land they were tending to . 
  it could be argued that the post-unification governments - despite all intentions , promises and reports - may have exacerbated things further by extending the piedmontese system of taxation ( which carried a far greater fiscal burden compared to the relatively light one formerly employed within the kingdom of the two sicilies ) and a number of new taxes to the newly-acquired south ; these taxes , most notably the one on flour , targeted essential items and foodstuffs . 
  you can very well imagine how such a system - tailored on the more prosperous and industrialised north - could have damaged the already fragile southern economy and its society as a whole . 
  the industrial policy of the new state tended to favour the north , under the flawed assumption that it would 've acted as a catalyst of development and somehow help pull the south out of its misery . 
  all it achieved was diverging even more investments away from it . 
  moreover , the disturbances ( late 1860s-1870 ) caused by these taxes not only had to be brutally quashed by the army but left the countryside at the mercy of innumerable acts of brigandage , further worsening the poorer strata 's already low standards of living . 
  the central governments were pushed into seeking an accommodation with the landed gentry ( and by extension the many people , such as field guardians , it employed ) with the goal of putting an end to the commotions and keeping the peasants under check . 
  a situation that lasted well beyond ww1 ; keep in mind that the first nuclei of the infamous * fasci di combattimento * were formed by war veterans hired by landlords with the task of intimidating and/or beating the living pulp out of all those peasants who dared protest or fight in favour of a more equal redistribution of land ... something that would only materialise decades later when the long-awaited * riforma agraria * was passed and enforced , not without some opposition , in 1950-51 . 
  kate beckinsale in * pearl harbor * . 
   they were terrible fighters in ww1 as well . 
  no , they pretty much were n't ( but thanks for the gratuitous ass-essment ) , and ... 
   [ ... ] they wanted to surrender to the central powers , but the other allies bailed them out . 
  ... no , they pretty much did n't . 
  not even after caporetto which , by the way , is not the only significant part of the war effort ; many people seem to conveniently forget the subsequent events in which the royal italian army bounced back after cadorna was dismissed and went ass-kicking the austrians/germans at asiago , vittorio veneto ( 400k a-h pows ; literally their whole army ) , etc. 
  or even consider trifles such as the italians vigorously resisting the ironically-named `` punitive expedition '' of 1916 - a true embarrassment for the central powers - or the part in which both the austro-hungarian fleet and the german submersibles trying to run the blockade were successfully obliterated in 1917-18 . 
  all of this does n't obviously suit their narrative of `` italy sucks ballz lol '' . 
  and the ` allies ' ( you surely mean the entente ? ), 
  only sent some token units as reinforcements : of 51 divisions on the italian front by november 1918 * less than ten * belonged to the entente - including other nationalities such as the czechs , who were so fond of austrian rule they preferred fighting for the italians instead - and most of them actually operated at the rear in support roles .

  what about an x200 or a t400 with libreboot preinstalled ? 
  i got mine from [ minifree ] ( https://minifree.org/ ) and that 's what i 'm using . 
  quite happy with it . 
  of course not .

  i 'm afraid there 's something very fishy going on ... that 's why i would recommend using one or more of the several instances of searx instead , especially now that they too support proxies . 
  stay vigilant everybody !, 
  as far as debian ( currently running jessie ) is concerned , it 's been fixed with kernel version 3.16.36-1 + deb8u2 . 
  keep in mind however that i 'm no expert and may therefore be wrong ... 
  another instance i 'm quite fond of is https://searx.laquadrature.net . 
  hey u/lin3thewind , i would advise against using trisquel - at least for the time being - it 's just not secure .
