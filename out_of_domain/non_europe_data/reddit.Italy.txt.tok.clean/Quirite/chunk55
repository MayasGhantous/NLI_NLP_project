  on a more serious note ... programmes like jersey shore are as representative of italy ( and actual italian-americans , i suspect ) as john wayne films are of the u.s. of a. 
  foreigners tend to have this rose-tinted view of passionate italians doin ' plenty of pdas when actually our society tends to be , as a whole , on the slightly repressed and mildly conservative side of things . 
  not ideal this , nope . 
  do n't be !, 
  over here it 's not so much about religion - you 'd probably be surprised to learn just how little the church matters in italy nowadays - but more about one 's `` public face '' and a widespread belief that everybody is judging everybody else ... which , to a certain degree , is true . 
  not unlike certain asian countries ( such as korea ) i reckon ?

  hell no !, 
  at least in my country , you 're going to get judged - hard - by the whole company before she even decides to date you ... 
  i 've asked girls out at swimming pools , on buses , trains , while queueing at the job centre ; it 's not like i have n't got any exposition to or experience with them . 
  but i 'll be damned if i can even muster the courage to ask her out while her friends are there . 
  just nooope . 
  that girl 's name ? 
  albert einstein . 
  oh , you 'd be surprised . 
  dat vocal fry is kinda hot for us europeans ... in my experience it 's almost like the quintessential american accent and it 's got a certain `` i 'm a college girl and i 'm ready to party ! '', 
  vibe to it . 
  which is veeery nice - for the most part . 
  on the other hand i doubt anyone really finds hot in any way , shape or form the accent many italians ( and i 'm one ) have when attempting to speak english . 
  to me it 's like listening to bonobos mimicking human language , ca n't believe people actually like that . 
  but a lot of my english-speaking friends keep telling me otherwise ? 
  seeeeee . 
  til !, 
  this is the case in italy , too . 
  you watch a film , and after 20 minutes you get subjected to at least five of adverts ; now , in a regular film there are at least * four * ad breaks ( not counting the mid-film interval ) so it is entirely possible for you to start watching one at , say , 21:10 and finish around 00:30 . 
  what 's even more baffling is that compared to 15 years ago , there are way less ads on tv . 
  btw mediaset has a synchronised , network-wide , 1-minute long ad break taking place at 21:00 sharp ; and since most of its channels are contiguous you ca n't escape seeing the same commercial ... no matter how much you try to change them !, 
  oh , and this happens regardless of the programme 's / film 's timing so it 's not at all unusual for an ad break to start mid-sentence . 
  lovely . 
  no wonder berlusconi is going bankrupt !, 
  agreed , naples is the best city if you like chewing gum . 
  huh ... sour cream & onion-flavoured crisps ? 
  volvos so big they 're difficult to park ? 
  not sure it qualifies as knowledge of the country , but i like stieg larsson novels ( plus the original swedish films are way better than the hollywood remakes ) and paradox games ; judging from the - admittedly , very few - swedes i 've talked to at work , you guys seem to be overall cooler than the danes . 
  btw there 's also a slightly dated , but still widespread , urban myth regarding the legendary * trombonave * ... a swedish ferry headed to finland in which passengers get drunk as soon as she leaves port and then engage in massive orgies all night long . 
  since we 're already at it , i 'll also add in the ridiculously hot women . 
  but you already knew that !,

  i guess that explains it then . 
  it was a weirdly-shaped thingy with lots of cheese running around . 
  not a bowling alley but i might 've not noticed at the time !, 
  slightly misleading question : a good 90 % of us is ( at least nominally ) catholic but still , most people here ignore the pope and its church regardless . 
  we would have been better if that meddling tax haven was never created . 
  personally i 'm all for re-annexation of the vatican city !, 
  i was there some 10 years ago , wo n't be easy . 
  afaik it was smack-bang in the city centre ? 
  they 've been doing this for thirty years now , how is this news ? 
  some older people like to say : `` the war was his only mistake !, 
  he drained the marshes , fought the mafia , made the trains run on time and gave me a council house ! '' . 
  most of us hate the guy , for very good reasons . 
  of course this sentiment is not shared by some sympathisers and all those who happen to belong to a few select parties or organisations which , while not illegal , happen to be neo-fascist in all but name . 
   in what way do they meddle ? 
  examples ? 
  they were behind the christian democracy , the party in power from 1948 to 1989 , as well as every attempt at obstructing or reversing laws on divorce ( 1970 ) , abortion ( 1978 ) , civil unions ( 2016 ) , etc. 
   [ ... ] is a lot taxes flowing out of italy due to the vatican ? 
  not exactly , but the vatican and its affiliated orders do own lots of properties throughout italy - monasteries , b & bs , hotels , you name it - they do n't pay any taxes on . 
  and until recently the ior was known for laundering/hiding slush money for a lot of politicians and other questionable individuals . 
  and [ this ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/03/how-funky-tortoiseshell-glasses-can-beat-facial-recognition ) is how we might be able to beat it . 
  hopefully .

  ackshually - everybody knows tin-foil hats only * amplify * mind-controlling radio waves !, 
  the gentleman who wishes to conceal his identity from the tyranny of government should wear a pair of [ these ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/03/how-funky-tortoiseshell-glasses-can-beat-facial-recognition ) instead . 
  not sure there 's something even remotely attractive about me ... but i sure as hell can help them fill their taxes . 
  oh , and i 'll soon be able to grow my own pot as well . 
  checkmate , chads !, 
  cool wind is italy 's # 1 predator ... every year , countless italians catch a cold and die because they chose not to wear a scarf on what appeared to be a reasonably sunny day .
