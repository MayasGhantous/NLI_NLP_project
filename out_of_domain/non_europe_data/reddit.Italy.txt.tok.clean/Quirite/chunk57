  whatever you say , dude ; after all you 're the one who 's well-versed in italian affairs here !, 
  imho you would make an ideal correspondent for cnn - i 'm sure they 'd appreciate the spelling mistakes too . 
  this has little to do with the recent waves of mass immigration - the trend started some 25 years ago , and afaik the main ( at least theoretically ) centre-left parties of the time were more than happy to jump on the neo-con bandwagon as well . 
  civil servants are well protected , enjoy benefits and are almost impossible to get rid of ; the [ italian ] democratic party made sure to screw the rest of us in the name of ` flexibility ' instead . 
  oh , and they 've also been aggressively cutting health-care spending . 
  they figured that if you ca n't get any food , you do n't need teeth anyway !, 
  at least for us europeans , a net positive was the new [ general data protection regulation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_data_protection_regulation ) being approved . 
  or the eu high court striking down the uk [ snooper 's charter ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/dec/21/eus-highest-court-delivers-blow-to-uk-snoopers-charter ) and [ other data retention programmes ... ] ( https://www.accessnow.org/victory-eu-court-rules-indiscriminate-data-retention-not-permissible/ ), 
  or the same court [ ruling ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20161027225130/http://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2016/10/eu-dynamic-static-ip-personal-data/ ) that dynamic ip addresses constitute personally identifiable information ... 
  or that very same court shredding the safe harbour agreement ( thank you max schrems ) . 
  italy finally recognising civil unions ( a small step , true , but a highly symbolic one ! ) . 
  the eu-wide abolition of roaming charges taking place on the 1st of january ... 
  the fcc approving [ new rules ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/10/27/the-fcc-just-passed-sweeping-new-rules-to-protect-your-online-privacy/ ) aimed at protecting isp customer data ... 
  the recent eu and fcc regulations concerning net neutrality ... 
  matteo renzi being finally kicked out of office ... 
  and i could go on , and on , and on . 
  as you can see - 2016 was n't * entirely * bad .

  pretty sure italy is wrong , the papal states did n't exist anymore in 1871 ; rome was officially annexed in oct. 1870 . 
  i do n't understand . 
  why does italy get savoy , of all provinces , but not istria ? 
  i mean - not even the king gave a fuck about it . 
  and why is alto adige split in ... three ? 
  you even left the italian-speaking bits with germany and the actual german zones in italy . 
  italian east africa ? 
  sure . 
  italian * west * africa , on the other hand ... not so much . 
  looks like op dun goofed . 
  they 're friendly and can actually be talked to . 
  indeed , americans are ( in certain ways ) more sociable than italians actually are . 
  especially the women ; you can just chat them up and have a conversation , without them automatically assuming you 're somehow hitting on them or rudely shooting you down . 
  it 's amazing , and this is why i have plenty of friends from overseas but very few from my own country ... italians can be - and most of them are - insufferably clique-y . 
  see an attractive girl you 'd like to talk to ? 
  is she part of your circle ? 
  then forget about it . 
  if i were you i 'd ask for a refund , how could a fortune teller not see that cumming ... 
  huh ... 
  i do n't think she was `` right in the head '' so to speak . 
  how did that end ? 
  anyway , sorry to hear that . 
  have an internet hug . 
  tomorrow 's the big day !, 
  already ditched smartphones altogether , my plans for 2017 include thoroughly purging most of my accounts over the interwebz and take appropriate - if fairly drastic - measures to protect my privacy . 
  want a recommendation ? 
  try libreboot . 
  if you 're not ok with getting gangbanged by your isp , mark zuckerberg , the nsa and some rando working for the chinese government then you definitely do n't want intel messing around your pc . 
  what about tails ? 
  personally , i think a live cd + a libreboot-compatible laptop with no hd offers the best protection available to us average joes ( it 's impractical but i have become a tad paranoid lately ) . 
  as far as e-mails are concerned , check pgp . 
  for passphrases you may want to have a look at the diceware method . 
  oh boy , i 'm really looking forward to a new beginning !, 
  going to wipe everything soon . 
  not sure i would 've dropped her home in the first place , i mean ... she clearly did n't deserve it . 
  at least you learned a valuable lesson that day !, 
  e tanto . 
  l'accento . 
  why would anyone ever want to name their child `` hunter '' or `` gunner '' is beyond me . 
  i ca n't help but think of trashy , illiterate and possibly non-vaccinated kids playing in a trailer park ... 
  edit : per la cronaca , uso il sistema [ diceware ] ( https://ixquick-proxy.com/do/spg/proxy?ep=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&amp;epile=4q6n41784r7n41794q4467774s5638324r7935725n586o3q&amp;edata=d3ed715c2159037ff9ba29d94ab931d9&amp;ek=63327446626p357366546457655768744r47462o56566p6q513255725n6n6p654s545679507n5274&amp;ekdata=34b96792abaae0e97de65a9de543b7c4 ) . 
  great , now i can not unsee this . 
   now i live in rome - center - ** south ** italy - [ ... ], 
  oh no you did n't . 
  you take that back . 
  now !, 
  lying ... here ? 
  on my bed ? 
  it is , indeed . 
   [ ... ] how are relations among your neighbouring countries ? 
  * ** france ** : we hate them . 
  mostly . 
  they copy everything we do , or steal it if they ca n't . 
  make ugly cars . 
  * ** switzerland ** : neutral as always , but the italian-speaking ticinese dislike us . 
  * il mattino * has got to be one of the foulest , most passive-aggressive and overall hate-filled publications known to man ( second only to the * daily heil * and * der stuermer * ) . 
  * ** austria ** : all is fine and dandy until the issue of alto adige is brought up . 
  still butthurt about ww1 . 
  i went on a roadtrip with family through austria and germany in 2004 , and the aforementioned country has the dubious distinction of being one of the few places i would n't want to visit again ; we were literally treated like shit from border to border . 
  could n't wait to leave . 
  * ** slovenia ** : we do n't really like each other , to be honest , or at least that was the impression i got when i visited ( been there a few times ) . 
  much resentment and animosity going on both sides due to issues surrounding the north-eastern border ... you know , it 's the kind of can of worms that still stinks after 70 years and gives the balkans a bad rep. a reputation just as bad as their beer . 
  * ** croatia ** : not exactly a neighbour , at least not anymore . 
  but they 're way better than their northern cousins . 
  three reasons ... 1 ) hot women ; 2 ) great food ; 3 ) fucking toll booths ( welcome to the 20th century , slovenia ! ) . 
  did i mention the hot women ? 
  and the cheap dentists . 
  do n't forget the cheap dentists . 
  pola is a delightful - and bilingual !, 
  - city , it really felt like home . 
  * ** vatican city ** : nosy tax haven with money and no vat ( italian citizens can `` expatriate '' and buy drugs at the vatican pharmacy at half the price , whereas the supermarket is reserved to vatican employees ) . 
  why is it even allowed to exist is beyond me . 
  * ** san marino ** : a former tax haven irrelevant in any way whatsoever . 
  you can buy katanas and other mall ninja shit there . 
  yeah , agreed . 
  that 's pretty much the case nowadays . 
  not least because many of us would n't be able to pinpoint slovenia on a map ... 
   what 's the italian view on wwii , specifically about the allied troops who campaigned up the peninsula ? 
  is there a perception of them as liberators from fascism , or is it more negative ?
