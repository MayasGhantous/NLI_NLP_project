  according to [ this ] ( http://www.vigilfuoco.it/aspx/returndocument.aspx?iddocumento=8532 ) helpful pdf , there have been 244,254 fires in 2012 but only 196,196 in 2013 ( this includes wildfires ) . 
   fire station information ? 
  department communication ? 
  or even a contact would be nice . 
  do n't know about that , but one of the barracks in rome has got a little museum ; however , you need to book an appointment to visit . 
  here 's the address : via luigi galvani , 2 ( testaccio district ) tel. 
  06/5746808 ... hopefully the operator is able to speak some english !, 
  no , i graffiti sulle stanga no !, 
  the issues of overpopulation and unemployment - which were rather pressing at the time - could be easened by simply sending colonists to libya , but that 's about the only benefit we 've ever got from it . 
  oil was discovered some time after ww2 , when italy had already been forced to relinquish its claims on the region ... 
  i get your point , but for pete 's sake do not trust everything you read in that book ... 
  ... as it 's got some serious issues with regards to accuracy . 
  aaaah , be ' !, 
  absolutely do explore ** latium ** ; it is vastly underrated and is almost totally devoid of other tourists ( most of whom like to flock * en masse * to umbria and tuscany after having been done with rome ) . 
  it 's not like the capital is surrounded by wastelands ... 
  * the ** castelli romani ** are a very quaint and lovely area south of rome with plenty of lakes and picturesque medieval towns all around ( frascati , velletri , rocca di papa , castel gandolfo - where the pope 's summer residence is located - marino , genzano , nemi ) . 
  also , lots of good food and wine to be had down there !, 
  frascati , velletri and rocca di papa are famous for the wine , genzano for its bread and a peculiar flower festival . 
  * if you fancy lakes , then ** bracciano ** is another lovely place you 'd like to visit ( tom cruise got married in the city castle ) . 
  * another two big lakes are at ** vico ** and ** bolsena ** . 
  * a strange one is the carsic lake of ** canterno ** , home to a most interesting reservoir . 
  * ** ariccia ** is another quaint town renowned for its * porchetta * . 
  * ** subiaco ** ( home to st. scholastica 's abbey ) , zagarolo , and petrella salto are other interesting towns . 
  * ** anagni ** and ** sutri ** are home to beautiful cathedrals ; the latter also has a roman arena . 
  * ** tivoli ** , a short train ride east of rome , is where emperor hadrian 's villa is located - as well as the * villa d'este * and its gardens . 
  also have a look at the homonymous town , it 's delightful . 
  * ** viterbo ** is another picturesque town just north of the city and can be easily reached via train . 
  the * parco dei mostri * at bomarzo is located nearby and is definitely worth a visit . 
  * ** ostia antica ** is rome 's very own pompeii ( as it is located in the ostia district ) - do not miss it . 
  it is also cheaper , much less crowded and better preserved than pompeii is !, 
  however , do bring a guidebook with you as the points of interest are not well marked . 
  * do visit the etruscan tombs at ** tarquinia ** , or the necropolis at ** cerveteri ** . 
  * ** civita di bagnoregio ** , also known as `` the dying town '' , is a settlement built upon a tufa hill which is slowly being eroded by the elements . 
  the panorama from there is truly breath-taking , as is the town itself . 
  * ** santa maria di galeria ** is an abandoned village right outside rome ; it could make for an interesting day trip . 
  * ** tusculum ** and ** castro ** are abandoned towns whose ruins are well worth a slice of your time . 
  * head south to the abbey at ** montecassino ** . 
  while the abbey itself has been rebuilt after ww2 , the view from there can not be beaten ( and the building itself is a quite impressive , not to mention very accurate , reconstruction ) . 
  * the gardens at ** ninfa ** , near latina ( south of rome ) , are lovely and well worth a visit - as is the nearby castle ( castello caetani ) . 
  * you like skiing ? 
  the ** terminillo ** is a winter destination popular with romans . 
  it 's beautiful , and still cheaper than many of those fancy resorts up north that mostly cater to rich wankers or tax-evaders ( just kidding ! ) . 
  * if you always wanted to visit amalfi but ca n't stomach the drive to that place ( or the crowds ... ) , then ** gaeta ** is an excellent choice . 
  ** terracina ** , sperlonga , ** sabaudia ** and san felice al circeo are other renowned resort towns . 
  * i like ** fiumicino ** 's historical centre ( and when there , do not forget to have some fried fish at ge.pa.gi 's ! ) . 
  * the ** pontine islands ** ( ponza , ventotene , s. stefano ) are worth a day trip ; the first two resemble capri quite a bit . 
  latium can be easily toured by train , and there are 8 railway lines ( the fl network ) connecting rome with pretty much every other town in the area . 
  these trains can be crowded during rush hour but if you travel at sensible times they offer a rather relaxing - not to mention easy - way of getting around . 
  some delay is to be expected , but these are usually on time . 
  when you 're finished you could move on to the adjacent region of ** abruzzo ** - another underrated place whose landscape is on par with that of trentino and the hilltops are almost better than those of tuscany , for half the price and with a quarter of the tourists . 
  good to know . 
  eh no , prima c ` era la municipale . 
  we came out surprisingly well ... perhaps this is due to the fact that most of us * do n't * have a university degree at all !, 
  well , it 's no mistery that italy 's got [ one of the lowest ] ( http://www.universita.it/rapporto-almalaurea-laureati-italiani-2014/ ) [ ratios ] ( https://www.almalaurea.it/sites/almalaurea.it/files/comunicati/2014/sintesi-2013.pdf ) of university graduates in the whole eu ... 
  did n't greece heavily influence rome after its conquest in 146 b.c. ? 
   [ ... ] so what are some examples where the culture of a conquered nation seeped into the culture of its imperialist overlord ? 
  the lombards were romanised pretty quickly after their conquest of italy in the 6th century a.d. 
   [ ... ] slavic influences on the roman empire ? 
  i might be wrong here , but i do n't think the slavs were around yet . 
  speaking about italy ... ours was a pretty aggressive ( not to mention relatively short-lived ) phase of colonial conquest ; i do n't believe we stayed long enough to adopt some bits of the locals ' culture such as loanwords of cuisine . 
  and given the fact that a decent chunk of our colonial history took place during fascism , which was against any and all forms of tolerance , i doubt it would have happened . 
  italians from lybia were/are a partial exception - a few are acquaintances - but most of them had been expelled in 1970 and are almost indistinguishable from the others ( many can speak arabic and cook some libyan dishes ) . 
  i do n't know exactly but i believe works are still being carried on , albeit at a snail 's pace ( given these days ' * very * limited funding ) . 
  the newspaper article mentioned that archaeologists were still looking for a point of entry ... 
  you know what they do whenever there 's roadwork and a roman ruin pops up ? 
  if they ca n't ensure its preservation , the ruin is minor or simply not profitable , they bury back everything . 
  and this is exactly what they 're doing in [ via ] ( http://arvalia.romatoday.it/~media/pp_big/11267999861110/portuense-2-3.jpg ) [ portuense ] ( http://www.repstatic.it/content/localirep/img/rep-roma/2014/07/25/160836833-2cd34280-24b8-443f-86da-430c427697db.jpg ) , a few blocks from home . 
  due to heavy traffic , the road needs to be enlarged ; so , after having studied the site , they 're removing everything of note in order to bury the rest and let the new road be built . 
  i ca n't say i 'm a fan of archaeological campaigns , but the thought of demolishing that gives me shivers !, 
  as far as i know , no new images or theories have surfaced yet ; it is also possible that archaeologists have stopped working on that , especially now that there are more pressing matters at hand ( however , augustus ' house - which sits right upon it - has recently been reopened to the public after a much-needed restoration ) . 
  link please ? 
  no , \u00e8 che tim costa un botto ... genio . 
  thank you !, 
  i may very well be wrong , but is the silmarillion some kind of background reading or ... ? 
  thank you for your thoughtful reply !, 
  probably , as far as i could understand , before the silmarillion ... 
  again , thank you !, 
  ianah , but i would like to address your question nevertheless ... 
  it is my understanding that such a thing was not common in italy , except of course for a particular period under fascism ( 1938 - 1944 ) during which the racial laws were enforced , mainly against those italians of jewish descent . 
  these has also effects on the colonies , as the locals had up to that point enjoyed a relatively cordial relationship with the italians ( these were mainly the somalians/eritreans ; libyans and abyssinians were understandably not so keen towards us ) . 
  suddenly they found themselves barred from entering cinemas , cafes , and the like ... and sexual relations between the two groups became also a criminal offence . 
  after mussolini 's fall those laws were repealed but interestingly enough , the allies kept enforcing them in the former italian colonies now under their control until the end of the war . 
  no , it 's not !, 
  mr. gilmour is heavily biased and has clearly an axe to grind against the very concept of italy ; he also seems very keen on mocking , utterly dismissing , or otherwise downplaying whatever we have managed to achieve in the last 150 years . 
  moreover , his descriptions of italians often border on the farcical - drawing from outdated notions or stereotypes instead of historical research - and their merits are not taken into due consideration . 
  if the op wants to learn something about italy , then the * pursuit of italy * is just about the worst book to study from . 
  here are some tales of valour told from an italian perspective :, 
  * ** salvo d'acquisto ** , a young * carabiniere * ( he was only 23 years old at the time of his death ) who served in ww2 italy ; at the time of the german occupation he was the only officer left in the torre di palidoro area , near rome . 
  on september 22th , someone from a nearby german garrison failed to properly handle a defective grenade and the subsequent explosion blew up the whole hq : the germans held the partisans responsible and rounded up 22 civilians with the intent of executing them . 
  the next day he was informed of the whole thing and decided to step in , claiming that he alone was the only perpetrator of the `` bombing '' and offering himself in the place of the civilians ( who were freed ) . 
  * the sacrifice of the ** 33rd `` acqui '' division ** . 
  after the axis invasion of greece the italians had been given the command of the ionian islands , whose garrisons were reinforced by german units . 
  however , by 1943 the course of the war had changed and things started to become tense after mussolini was sacked and put under arrest on july 25th . 
  by september 8th italy had surrendered and the germans were now the enemies : they set forth to disarm the italian troops in greece but were met with resistance ( and in many cases , the italians fought along with the greek partisans ) . 
  at cephalonia - which was at the time being administered by by acqui division - the italian troops voted not to surrender and managed to overpower the german garrison , subsequently radioing the allies for help ( which never came ) . 
  the 12,000 italians were severely outnumbered by their german counterparts but managed nevertheless to hold out in a week-long bloody siege before being defeated . 
  the victorious germans then proceeded to kill their way through the island , and the quasi-totality of the italian garrison - as well as many greek civilians - was annihilated ; the pows were machinegunned and their bodies dumped into mass graves . 
  out of 12,000 troops , only 163 men survived to tell the story . 
  * ** amedeo , duke of aosta ** , the hero of the * amba alagi * . 
  a descendant of a cadet branch of the house of savoy , the young amedeo enlisted at the start of ww1 when he was only 16 ; both he and his father insisted that no special privilege be given to him , and he was soon sent on the front line on the carso , where he was promoted lieutenant for his bravery on the battlefield .
