  but that 's another story . 
  here in italy , we 've got plenty of scummy companies ( most with fake commercial names ) which exploit the rampant youth unemployment rates by deliberately placing misleading job adverts on dedicated sites and newspapers . 
  you send them your cv for a vacancy in `` accounting '' or `` back office '' and before you know it , you 're going door to door bamboozling elders in a city 60 km away selling phone or energy contracts via morally questionable methods . 
  they also tend to foster a cultish and vaguely brainwash-y following among their `` associates '' ... 
  op was indeed terminated , as in `` blown to smithereens by a relentless cyborg with an austrian accent '' . 
  shit always finds a way . 
  always . 
  actually , `` only '' 2.8 millions of us live in rome - 6 millions is the figure for the entire lazio region . 
   and we do n't know if it 'll be continued after that . 
  that 's the mayor 's fault though , m5s is notoriously allergic to infrastructures . 
  or just about anything that might alienate their electoral base ... we all know with * whose * votes they won . 
  username checks out . 
  there 's also capodistria and portorose , the latter is home to a casino . 
  vivo ? 
  punto . 
  no , senti , vivo a roma e qui le risate sono finite mesi fa . 
  [ quantum immortality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quantum_suicide_and_immortality ), 
  man , that shit is scary ... even scarier than prions ... it 's the very kind of stuff nightmares are made of !, 
  i thought the goons at [ rationalwiki ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/roko's_basilisk#so_you.27re_worrying_about_the_basilisk ) had debunked it ? 
  as i wrote in another comment :, 
   if it 's true that there are multiple universes and the quantistic technobabble scientists like to spout has a meaning then there 's a chance that somewhere , somehow a copy of you ( which might or may not be the real you ) will defy all odds and survive every malady , every injury , every traumatic event that may happen to it . 
   want to take your life with a gun ? 
  you shoot , the bullet splits your brain in two but you survive . 
   manage to get on a wheelchair and jump from the hospital 's window ? 
  you survive the fall . 
   make the nurse poison you ? 
  your organs gets recked but a part of you just wo n't die . 
   get hacked to smithereens by dr. lecter ? 
  whatever 's left of you is still there ... 
   try to wait it out and finally die of old age ? 
  years pass and nothing happens . 
  so , yeah , it ai n't too nice of a thought experiment !, 
  who knows ? 
  either way , it 's not going to be pleasant . 
  english is not my first language . 
  and neither is maths ... 
  there are worse things to feel shitty about , really . 
  your dating potential is something you can fix by yourself ; an injury , or a handicap ... well ... let 's just say that you ca n't recover from those things as easily . 
  and they can actually lead you to a lifetime of crippling depression . 
  but i 'm sure that this is not your case . 
  you 're going to be be fine . 
  you may need to turn your life around a bit , sure , but you 'll be fine . 
  if * i * managed to do it then there 's surely hope !, 
  ** hint ** : find a female friend ... they 're terrific social `` lockpicks '' . 
  and the more you talk to actual women , the better . 
  ** hint n \u00b0 2 ** : women are human beings , too . 
  just talk to them as you would with everyone else ; be upfront with those whom you are interested in ; and above all , do n't put them onto a pedestal . 
  you will make an ass of yourself and get rejected ( that 's the hard truth ) but you shall develop an immunity to it : it 's part of the game . 
  we 've all been there . 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  i do !, 
  and i find the [ radio garden ] ( http://radio.garden/live/ ) pretty neat for such purposes . 
  when i 'm not listening to the radio i like myself some eurodance ( yes , i 'm old ! ), 
  or other stuff from the '90s . 
  i 've seen better days ... or weeks ... but thanks !, 
  tomorrow i have a very important medical appointment so i 'm trying to be as optimistic as possible , even though it feels like a pointless fight - and an uphill one at that . 
  but who knows . 
  i may even end up being pleasantly surprised . 
  what do they say ? 
  live to fight another day ? 
  i too hope so ; there 's so many things i would love to do , so many experiences i want to live and so many other things i 'd like to share that i have no intention whatsoever of letting such silly trifles win over me . 
  not going down like that , no sir ... if it 's a fight they want , then a fight they shall have . 
  i 'm too young and beautiful for that shit !, 
  i 'm gon na smash their arses , and when i get back on my feet then i 'll smash the world 's arse too . 
  that 's a promise !, 
  not a matter of life and death - thankfully - but i happened to develop some sort of kidney problem that can have serious implication for the rest of my life . 
  and of course that * had * to happen when i was turning my life around for the better ... 
  i was about to re-enroll uni , move out of my parents ' home , join a gym and perhaps even find a g/bf . 
  but i like to think that this is just a minor hiccough . 
  what about you ? 
  enough with my problems !, 
  glad to hear that !, 
  i do n't know what you 're studying but if you want a suggestion , i hear chemistry is some truly hot shit right now ; at least in my country . 
  currently giving it a chance and if i do n't make it then archaeology it is . 
  i still have my old nokia 3200 ; it has a detachable cover with marijuana leaves all over it . 
  found that one in the woods during a field trip in middle school ... not gon na throw it away for one of them fancy newfangled contraptions . 
  the kicker ? 
  i have rusty 's ringtone from ocean 's 12 . 
  just because . 
  edit : in case it was n't obvious enough , yes , i 'm a pothead and one of the annoying kind . 
  you may want to see your gp at once . 
  trust me when i tell you that you do n't want to fuck with nerves ... not now , nor ever . 
  those teeny tiny fuckers are way more trouble than they 're worth and i 've come to hate them with every fibre of my being ( pun intended ) . 
  do yourself a favour and get checked asap . 
  just keep in mind that you only have one body - a check-up would be in your best interests . 
  i 've learnt not to take any chances with it , and i 've had to learn the hard way ... 
  chemistry , my man ( or woman ! ) . 
  industrial chemistry means more dosh for you and me ... and i 'm not saying this just because i 'm studying it . 
  i have recently ( re ) joined both the gym and a swimming pool ... 
  i 'm starting to see some results . 
  m'ladies are mirin ' too so if i manage to get the rest of my life back on track health-wise i swear i 'm gon na make chads cry in shame . 
  time to wake up and smash some arses , hulk-style !, 
  yeah , it 's the best feeling !, 
  do n't give up dude . 
  i used to be really mellow , on top of it all i 'm not too tall and have even been cursed with a receding hairline ( lost the genetic lottery ... ) so it 's not like i 'm used to compliments of any kind . 
  personally i find that gym is great for burning fat and acquiring mass ; swimming , on the other hand , is great for muscle definition but do n't expect it to work wonders for your waistline . 
  i like both so i 'm reaping benefits . 
  only thing is - stick to a regular schedule !, 
  skip a week and you lose resistance . 
  oh do n't worry about the bod - if you join a swimming pool you will notice that most people really are n't that fit .
