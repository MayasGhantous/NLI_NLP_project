  plenty of lube , plenty of patience ... 
  above all , you want to play it safe . 
  so no make-shift sex toys and no unprotected sex . 
  ever . 
  but this should be obvious . 
  relax and have fun !, 
  perhaps if you muster enough courage to actually talk to them like the human beings they are , without putting them on a pedestal , * perhaps * they cease to be such mysterious objects of desire . 
  who knows ... you might even get lucky !, 
  * stop !, 
  you violated the law !, 
  * pay your mum a fine or serve your sentence . 
  your good boy points are now forfeit . 
  you can always resist arrest or give the imperial guard some tendies . 
  sorry , i must 've posted the same comment twice and i accidentally deleted them . 
  damn . 
  anyhow - the issue for me was n't that much about coming out but rather , actually coming to terms with my own sexual orientation . 
  no easy feat i 'm telling you . 
  it was more like a self-rediscovery ... for a good 15 years of my life i chose to ignore a significant part of myself despite knowing fully and well its importance . 
  luckily i got some help from a friend of mine , a lovely lovely woman and an actual lesbian at that . 
  ours truly was a chance meeting too , you would n't believe it . 
  so one evening we were talking about exes and all those shenanigans when i asked her , in the most roundabout way imaginable , whether she was gay or not . 
  there was something about her ... 
  i do n't know ... but it turns out she was too !, 
  at which point i just felt the urge to tell her . 
  that night i was literally shaking so she brought me coffee and we had a very honest chat about it . 
  but i guess i was lucky - not everyone can count on such an understanding environment . 
  ** tl ; dr ** sometimes , all it takes is a good friend and a gentle nudge in the right direction . 
  do n't worry , the penalty for necrophilia in cyrodiil is only 500 septims . 
  morrowind is way worse !, 
  that awkward moment when ... the kid you called an emo freak was actually ... * an oblivion npc . 
  is that code for a dick pic ? 
  it is , perhaps not so much in the evenings . 
  there 's also a fl1/3 station at quattro venti , no need for op to go all the way to trastevere station . 
  no regrets . 
  satellite ? 
  what about your first-born and a sample of your dna ? 
  dna , this way we can serve you customised ads based on your genetic memories !, 
  of course . 
  please turn them in , we need new material to improve our pattern-detecting algorythms . 
  they will help us prevent future crimes and ensure a safe society !, 
  * you and me , baby we , are nothing but mammals ... *, 
  su internet . 
  when the film came out , i just wanted to punch that little shit robbie so bad !, 
  good thing i have libreboot on my x200 . 
  they do , it 's called [ psp ] ( https://libreboot.org/faq.html#amd ) . 
  hey , at least it 's not kde !, 
  he looks more like a * cocaine * plantation owner kind of guy . 
  all our bases are belong to him !, 
  oh boy , where do i even start . 
  where do i even start ... 
  ** the good ** : i 've been seeing a therapist lately . 
  wonderful woman , but she costs me good money ( 70 quid an hour ! ) . 
  ** the bad ** : i 've been undergoing treatment for some really nasty kidney stuff and since the problems started my life has never been the same ( that 's code for utter shite ) . 
  there 's hope for recovery but it 's going to take a few months at the very least , perhaps a year . 
  perhaps never . 
  who knows . 
  either way , whenever i sense some improvement something else just * has * to happen and ruin everything goddammit ; what does the song say ? 
  one step forward , two steps back ? 
  i also started to have some problems `` downstairs '' , if you catch the drift , in addition to a whole slew of side effects due to the meds i 've been taking for the better part of the past month . 
  nothing too worrying or permanent ( at least according to the couple of urologists i 've consulted ) but still , this is the dingleberry on top of the loser sundae . 
  i 've actually considered suicide a couple of times but still have a good friend and not all hope is lost ( yet ) so i 'm not going to attempt it . 
  or so i hope . 
  you know what 's really crushing ? 
  it all happened right after i joined a gym + swimming pool , was actively looking for a g/bf and was about to give higher education another go . 
  it hit me like a tonne of fucking bricks . 
  i also happen to look at other people 's relatively normal lives ( i 'm 26 for the records ) and ca n't help but cry . 
  i see happy couples my age and want to vomit , throw myself under a bus , jump from a bridge or whatever else have you got ... 
  the ** meh ** : everything else . 
  still unemployed . 
  my life 's in a shitty `` freeze '' mode right now . 
  sounds like an asshole ex-friend of mine . 
  according to him i do n't have depression , either , and seeing a therapist is no good because `` our grandparents had to live through the war and they did n't need no therapist ! '' . 
  fuck you , valerio . 
  yep , that 's me most evenings nowadays . 
  nighttime is fine , evenings ... not so much . 
  i can relate to the bit about doing a veritable grand tour of doctors , psychos , and other assorted butchers . 
  it 's hard - especially when they do n't seem to take your concerns seriously or keep getting the wrong diagnosis . 
  but if it were for me i 'd stay in hospital 24/7 so much i 'm alone and scared ; at least the guys in er would give a single fuck about me . 
  been there , done that . 
  i 'm left with one very good friend and my therapist ; do n't even talk to my parents anymore because they too happen to be sick of my shit . 
  no social or sex life due to the illness . 
  it really is the worst so i can definitely sympathise with your experience . 
  have an internet hug from a complete and total stranger !, 
  personally , i find evenings the saddest and most terrifying part of the day - that 's when my mood really goes down the toilet and i start having anxiety attacks . 
  then i somehow end up researching my condition for hours on end only to freak out at the smallest of changes . 
  and of course webmd says i have cancer . 
  hey , want to talk about it ? 
  i too have mild ed due to some medication i 've been taking , it is terrifying indeed !, 
  do n't know if you 've seen a ( sex ) therapist but in case you have n't done so yet i encourage you to give it a try . 
  also ... try to get a little bit more confident in your own body ; the best way to do so would be to go commando in the privacy of your own home , relax , lie down and get to know better how the different parts look , feel , etc. 
  now close your eyes , focus on your unit ( how it feels and the way it reacts to stimuli ) then think about something `` nice '' . 
  see if you can get a stiffy , even a weak one !, 
  escalate if/when you do but do n't despair if you ca n't get it up immediately or even at all ; it is perfectly possible to give yourself ed even with a fully working penis . 
  btw try to avoid masturbation and pornography , at least for a week or two . 
  a month would n't hurt . 
  have anxiety , can confirm . 
  well , thanks !, 
  and just to be even more clear , it 's working for me .
