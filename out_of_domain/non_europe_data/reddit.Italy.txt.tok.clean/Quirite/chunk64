  now they 're planning on tearing down terminals 2 and 5 . 
  perhaps we 'll even get a new train station somewhere in my lifetime ... 
  here where ? 
  well , but then again you guys also have naked women in shop fronts ? 
  right ? 
  right ... ? 
   [ ... ] subject to the whims of their padroni -- the men who owned the feudal land upon which they toiled -- italian women were commonly the victims of institutionalized , systematic rape . 
  there was a practice known as `` prima notte '' that allowed the landowner to sleep with the virgin bride of his worker , which extended into the 20th century . 
  or a disposable camera . 
  fine . 
  if * papers , please * taught me anything that means you 're probably hiding something . 
  and i 'm gon na detain you for that sweet , sweet ca $ h bonus ... 
  i still remember that time [ bush jr. choked on a pretzel and fell from his couch . 
  ] ( http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jan/14/news/mn-22490 ), 
  i have a feeling our gentlesir 's going to be questioned by the fbi sooner or later . 
  `` and if it 's a legitimate rape , the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down '' .

  is n't he the same guy who wanted to chase british tourists out of boston ? 
  edit : [ yup , it 's that guy ] ( https://imgur.com/a/bvr2i ) . 
  making fun of your son whenever he happens to have a crush on someone . 
  this is one of the many ways you can turn an already shy kid into a miserable human being with no self-confidence . 
  i should know , i was one !, 
  thanks dad and assorted assholes from elementary/middle school . 
  i 've only found the courage to start dating at the ripe old age of 26 ... and i did n't even talk much to women before i was 19 ... 
  how 's a man supposed to contain his excitement at the sight of exposed ankles ? 
  no , that 's grandma . 
  mum is the one asking when i 'm going to have kids of my own . 
  the first few times are going to be embarrassing . 
  after the third one you build up a tolerance ( so to speak ) and , hey , you 'll probably never see her again so it 's a win-win ; for example last night i saw a chick rolling what looked like a fat joint , asked her whom she got it from and only then i noticed it was a sandwich ... but it was a convo nevertheless . 
  not putting them on a pedestal also helps . 
  you are n't . 
  you really are n't . 
  and if you 're not happy with yourself or your predicament in life , in the first place , then a girlfriend wo n't give you happiness ; many people do n't seem to get this . 
  do whatever it is that you want to do . 
  i was shy , then bullied relentlessly throughout elementary/middle school and my dad 's attitude did n't help , either . 
  my dad actually offered to get me a hooker . 
  you just do , you force yourself to go there and actually do it . 
  but i was lucky , for i also had a good female friend of mine who kept prodding and supporting me ... 
  i 've got a 10-year-old x200 with a 9-cell battery ... this thing is a fucking tank !, 
  comfy to type on , it never gets too hot ( had far newer laptops quite literally fry away ) , plus libreboot + debian is quite the icing on the cake . 
  love it . 
  e quell ` aborto di uplay . 
  tithes for titties , huh ?

  yes , but getting some games to work is a pain in the arse ( looking at you , nightfire ) . 
  hey !, 
  corporations are people , too . 
  i see you have n't had to deal with m$ office 's ever-changing ui .

  dipende .

  at least he did n't pretend to have a canadian girlfriend . 
  ackshually - it 's * covfefe * , not * cofveve * . 
  well ... huh ... 
  i too happen to be another ( male ) italian and i do n't do any of that , either . 
  if it can be of any consolation - and that does n't mean it will be - i feel like i 've i 've wasted the past 15 years of my life . 
  not joking . 
  and yes , i feel more than terrible about it not least because the illness i 'm currently being plagued by * had * to happen exactly when i was opening myself to the outside world to make up for the lost time . 
  though there 's something i 've learnt from all this : you have to force yourself to accept things as they have turned out to be and then find a way to get your life back on track ... `` no crying on spilled milk '' as we say in italy . 
  it 's useless . 
  our past is all but gone now , ca n't go back to the good ol' days !, 
  we 're in a tunnel made of our own dark thoughts and we need to allow ourselves an emergency exit , said exit being doing something - anything - about it . 
  i for example have started doing small tasks which evolve into bigger tasks and so on ( kick-starting a virtuous cycle ) . 
  life 's like an engine ; all we need to do is to check the starter * and actually turn the damn key * . 
  to me , it feels like having ears but no mouth ... everybody 's talkin ' but you can only listen . 
  it 's like when you throw a ball on the ground , right ? 
  eventually it bounces back . 
  i too have plenty of depression attacks , especially in the evenings , but i feel like there 's this psychological `` hard surface '' which prevents you from sinking any further . 
  if i were to draw a diagramme of that it would probably look like a fucking seesaw !, 
  my illness . 
  three months in and not a sign of improvement ... but there 's hope or so they tell me . 
  ( btw , no , i do n't have cancer or anything - mild kidney stuff - but still ) . 
  oh man i 've got those too and they really suck ballz . 
  thank you for the support !, 
  will do my best to kick its arse to the moon and back . 
  imho the question you 've got to ask yourself is `` am i really enjoying the current state of things ? '' . 
  if you 're anything like me or anybody else probably the answer would be a resounding no . 
  all of this is fixable anyway , just how ? 
  try to write down a list of things you would like or need to do , initially they need to be small enough for you not to feel like a damn chore !, 
  start with just shaving or washing ... get into the routine ... then add something else , such as doing the dishes or collecting the mail ... then you add something else ... and so on and on and on . 
  you need to break this vicious cycle and the only way you can do that is by doing something - anything - about it .
