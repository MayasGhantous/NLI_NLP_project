  we have to kick-start a virtuous one instead . 
  life is like a car engine ; you need to find the starter and turn the damn key . 
  yer just jelly , one day glorious orange leader will notice me !, 
  ( if he does n't get impeached first that is ) . 
  parentesi t ( ) nde, 
  oh no , they caught me !, 
  what am i to do ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj8kndopvwi ), 
  they probably get to bang those violinists , as well . 
  yeah ... assuming they are over 70 . 
  btw ever heard of veneto and south tyrol , notorious godless strongholds ? 
  as is tradition . 
  and every summer , like clockwork , some of them get run over by a train or fall down the tiber 's embankments . 
  `` referendum ? 
  of course ; it 's a * libre * disappointment . 
  even though i passed both exams on the first try it still took me two months to get it . 
  * `` nooooooooo !, 
  * repeatedly sips on water *, 
  i have n't thrown a birthday party ( it 's just a month away ) since 1998 and i ca n't see why would i want to throw one now that my life is in the shitter , without any possibility of recovery whatsoever . 
  what 's there to celebrate anyway ? 
  looking forward to seventy more years like this one ... no , wait , i 'd rather stick my balls into a friggin ' blender !, 
  ok - to be fair my parents organised a family hangout at a restaurant last year and guess what ? 
  we had to call an ambulance because some dude at the table next to us had an epileptic seizure/stroke/whatever . 
  amazing evening . 
  welcome to the club !, 
  if it can be of any consolation i stopped seeing my therapist because i had to shell out 70 $ an hour ( not even 50 minutes actually ) and she was n't of much help , either . 
  all that body mindfulness drivel ... but at the very least she gave me meds ? 
  but they do little . 
  enough to raise my hopes but not enough to actually give me the illusion of progress . 
  a foreign guy had an epileptic seizure at the restaurant we happened to be at . 
  at some point he started having incontrollable spasms while his wife/gf/so / lover/whatever kept shrieking `` mikey !, 
  mikey ! '', 
  and then he fell down , face-first , on his plate . 
  we had to call an ambulance . 
  i also had to take care of him ( kind of ) because i was the only english-speaking person around ... 
  what a grand night !, 
  still not as sucky as my 27th birthday , which is going to take place this very august . 
  to be fair , * la gioconda * was just about the only painting the french did n't actually steal . 
  btw i use lynx, 
  of very course !, 
  ( just kidding , i actually use firefox ) . 
  less touristy ? 
  are you really sure about that ? 
  true that . 
  a few years ago i almost got fired from my first job for browsing random shit on reddit . 
  i managed to track down [ very first thread i happened to stumble upon ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/vuo8j/hey_reddit_what_are_your_worst_roommate_stories/ ) and saved it !, 
  author of what , exactly ? 
  i was imagining something more along the lines of * severus snape , professor and lover * . 
  [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/whatthefanfic/comments/2eesun/severus_snape_professor_and_lover_in_which_snape/ ) for the curious ( nsfl ), 
  eh ... today was my last day on probation in a knife shop and chose to quit because i just could n't take the long working hours , even though i do actually need a job . 
  feeling like a lazy piece of shit ? 
  me too , man . 
  me too . 
  the owner was even willing to take me but i 'm such an idiot . 
  cracked.com , back to when it was still ( kind of ) decent .

  il sito del fatto quotidiano disponibile in https ?!, 
  incredibile . 
  thanks renzi ( e verini ) . 
  huh ... thanks ? 
  what did we ever do to you , always assuming you interacted with actual romans in the first place ? 
  if you 'd like to get hurt by driving on a pothole , cobblestones or even gasoline slicks then sure ... go for it . 
  if you 're not from here and do n't know where the one-way streets or limited traffic zones are ... do n't . 
  taxis because uber is black limos over here ( and also because i was a taxi driver myself ! ) . 
  be aware of some of my ex colleagues , though ... plenty of decent people but also lots of sacks of shit too . 
  not that you 'll have much choice anyway because you have to board the first vehicle in the queue . 
  quite the hit and miss . 
  btw do * not * accept any rides from the illegals swarming the airport !, 
  exit and look for the taxi stall . 
  also there are some taxis that serve the nearby town city of fiumicino , they too go to rome but have very different tariffs so you may end up having to pay an arm and a leg instead of the 48 $ ( 30 if you land at ciampino ) . 
  bird shit is a problem in rome too from october to april because of the damn starlings , but even then we try the impossible to get rid of them ( budget cuts notwithstanding ) . 
  they 're only a problem in areas near the river , though . 
  there 's a giant-ass airbase at pratica di mare . 
  it 's nothing unusual . 
  could 've been worse ... be grateful you did n't have to stay in ciampino . 
  i mean - they do n't call it `` italy 's retirement home '' for nothing !, 
  ( btw it 's spelled trieste ) . 
  you have become a moderator of r/rome, 
  why , if i may ask ? 
  i 'm sorry to hear about your friend , but i can assure most of us are n't actually like that . 
  btw you sure it was actual romans ? 
  i feel there 's more to this story but i might be wrong . 
  well ... 
  i honestly do n't really know what to say other than to apologise again on behalf of the rest of us , albeit i 'd be kind of wary of making such wide generalisations . 
  shame your time here had to be ruined by a bunch such of assholes . 
  ( sincerely , a non-creepy roman !, 
  the only real danger here are potholes and the pickockets in certain part of the historical centre ( especially the train station , which is shady as fuck and should get nuked asap ) . 
  other than that rome is actually a surprisingly safe city . 
  why would that be ? 
  please . 
  as if athens was n't a tourist-heavy , run-down , * actual * dirty shithole of a city !, 
  it 's the naples of the north but without the friendly people or exquisite cuisine . 
  and everything closes at 8 . 
  not to mention the elevated highway cutting through the city ( which also obstructs the view of the sea ) , that shitty skyscraper that looks like a crayon , or the junkies roaming the streets ... 
  i had to spend six months there ... 
  idk about you but they failed me twice . 
  you can bet i was damn well prepared the third time ?
