  ( do n't try this at home kids ) . 
  internet !, 
  firing up windows 98 , the modem noises , waiting for the site to load ( remember the blue bar in internet explorer ? 
  ) , the chat-rooms . 
  you still were better off buying a copy of playboy - back to when it had actual nudies in it - at the newsstand or waiting until 1 am for the `` naughty '' advertisements to show up on local channels ; we used to pay internet * by the minute * but it was too fucking slow for porn anyhoo . 
  now the interwebz is different . 
  kinda soulless . 
  and it 's either dank memes or the nsa . 
  wwe matches ... rey mysterio , anyone ? 
  the magic 's broken . 
  same thing for the * goosebumps * franchise . 
  [ music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g6qdnc4jps ) also [ used ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irvgzffxhfk ) to [ be ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn_hrh8agnk ) way [ better ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgs9qutwc3m ) in the [ 1990s ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1fzj_ayaja ) and early [ 2000s ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w15owdh02k4 ) , when kylie minogue was still hot . 
  more like an anti-hero . 
  life has n't been kind to me and that 's all i 'm going to say about it . 
  probably it 's too old for most redditors to remember but [ terri nunn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx51eeglty8&amp;app=desktop ) was the very essence of the band berlin . 
  she truly was a stunning woman ... and one of the most talented singers i 've ever had the pleasure of listening to !, 
  not joking . 
  ( btw the very same thing could be said for debbie harry and blondie ) . 
  cleaning toilets in a stadium ... the sheer amount of drugs , druggies and all the shit that goes on in here is astounding !, 
  you know you 're in a tough spot when most of your colleagues are `` former '' meth addicts with all their front teeth missing ( except for the canines ) and they 're so damn thin you could literally carry them in your arms . 
  also , many taxi/limo drivers are on coke and a good chunk of them gets their first stroke before the age of 40 . 
  no , where i used to work there was some homeless-looking guy running around the sectors with one of those plastic bags they give you at the supermarket . 
  it was full of dope and i suspect my supervisors got a cut of the proceedings . 
  i wish they paid us in drugs , or even anything at all !, 
  technically our wage was $ 4/hour but we were constantly working - some of us even did 20-hour shifts - and paid according to how many hours we managed to clock in . 
  and our manager `` forgot '' to write down our hours . 
  luckily i did n't but then had to call the police when they refused to hand out the cheques ( you read that right ... cheques ) . 
  when they finally did , those very same cheques bounced . 
  police was involved and their fat arses are sitting in jail now . 
  oh no , they were absolutely chill people . 
  very humble . 
  just not great coworkers ... or employees . 
  * are you a boy , or a girl ? 
  tanto paga pantalone !, 
  [ italian-language sources ] ( http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/politica/2017/07/28/cdm-vara-missione-italiana-in-libia-navi-aerei-700-militari-_82cfdb5f-f546-4cd0-91f1-315fcee5b703.html ) report that the naval mission will consist of at least five vessels , a submarine , an untold number of drones and a 700-men-strong ground force ; these will be assisting the libyan coast guard ... in other news the un-backed libyan government denies having ever asked for support despite all indications to the contrary ( sarraj 's visit to rome , during which a formal request of assistance was effectively lodged ) but i think this has more to do with his desire to save face in front of the libyan public opinion , which is not favourable to such an intervention . 
  the mission may also be expanded in the future . 
  no , the italian navy will be assisting the libyan coast guard ( or whatever is left of it ) in turning back those vessels . 
  the goal of this mission is to assist the local coast guard in turning those boats back to libya : it does n't have anything to do with triton , which is ( at least theoretically ) an eu-wide sar effort with a completely different end . 
  i used to place sim toddlers in closed rooms with highly flammable furniture and a fireplace , wait for the carpet to catch fire and then watch the little fuckers burn to hell . 
  i guess i just hated the way babies looked in the sims 2 ? 
  my character 's wife in ck2 had just given birth to a healthy baby boy ... problem is , i already had one and tribals being limited to elective gavelkind meant that succession was going to be a nightmare so i thought it would 've been nice to throw the little shit in the oubliette and execute him . 
  my council was suprisingly chill with that . 
  what about that time i exterminated those damn raiders ? 
  i hired lots of mercenaries , killed the raiding bastard in battle , turned on his liege , got all his titles , imprisoned and executed the shit out of his whole family and then took his wife and daughters as concubines . 
  then i gave the duchy to a drooling imbecile with the `` dull '' and `` inbred '' traits . 
  ( of course i repudiated the former ruler 's wife and forced her to marry that idiot before he got those titles ) . 
  sigh . 
  the second italo-abyssian war was actually a fucking walk in the park ; not `` difficult '' at all , it would 've been ridiculous if it acually was ; just look at real-life curbstomping contests like the 2nd battle at tembien or scir\u00e8 !, 
  and the first war was started by the ethiopians who had modern artillery , firearms as well as french and russian advisors . 
  the italians were also outnumbered by a ratio of 1:10 ( 18,000 vs 140,000 ) . 
  this is actually bullshit ... the italians in north africa not only did n't have enough water to drink ( they had to resort to drinking the fluid from radiators , with all the consequences it entailed ) but pasta was n't actually part of their diet . 
  or the month-long [ siege of the amba alagi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_amba_alagi_ ( 1941 ) ( 6000 italians vs 40,000 commonwealth troops ) . 
  i call bullshit on that story . 
  it very much is n't . 
  pasta was n't a part of italian rations and they had to resort to drinking the water from vehicles anyway . 
  why ? 
  that story makes no sense whatsoever in italian . 
  turns out those assholes from it were monitoring my connection all along and caught me lurking on reddit . 
  so , kids , that 's how i lost my first job ... here 's the [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/vuo8j/hey_reddit_what_are_your_worst_roommate_stories/ ) i was guilty of looking at !, 
  edit : should 've clarified that i was browing reddit during lunchtime . 
  my ( thankfully ex ) best friend was a `` very devout '' catholic and hardline right-winger who attends mass every sunday , yet he screws multiple women on tinder and shunned me when i came out to him . 
  what about a joint ? 
  did i mention you that he also `` jokingly '' hit on me more than once ? 
  now you know . 
  mum used to tell me that videmusic ( `` videoclips '' in her parlance ) were satanic and would 've turned me gay . 
  joke 's on her , though ... 
  i turned out a pot-loving bisexual anyway !, 
  thank you mtv !, 
  these are all very rome/italy-centric tips but whatever :, 
  * at the airport do n't accept rides from the touts coming at you . 
  exit the terminal , find the stall and board the first taxi in the queue ; the cost of a ride to the city centre is fixed at 48 and 30 $ ( depending on the airport ) . 
  some of my colleagues are also pieces of shit , but most of us are actually very chill . 
  * if a restaurant has a person ( colloquially known as * acchiappino * ) on the front door ready to drag clueless tourists in , move along ; if a restaurant is too close a certain piazza or monument , move along ; if the menu is written in four different languages , move along ; if it comes with actual pictures of the food ... run away !, 
  * roman restaurants can not charge you for * coperto * ; bread has to be priced in the menu , the * coperto * is illegal . 
  * only touristy caf\u00e9s will charge you for sitting . 
  coffee should n't cost more than 90 cents , same for pastries . 
  * do n't give money to buskers , beggars and gyspsies . 
  it 's ok to shoo the damn peddlers away . 
  * you actually have to buy and validate bus tickets , do n't complain when you get fined . 
  * avoid any and all venues located in a kilometre-wide radius from the vatican . 
  * the `` swiss post '' thing is a scam and takes way longer than our post system . 
  * local police is useless , if you need to report a crime go to the * real * police . 
  * rome is very safe otherwise but watch out for pickpockets in the centre . 
  not worth your time . 
  * it 's very unlikely you 'll get to interact with an actual roman irl . 
  * try not to get drunk and fall from the embankments , please !, 
  * yes , it 's very hot here . 
  very hot indeed . 
  bring sunscreen . 
  * no , we do n't call the vittoriano `` the typewriter '' . 
  * do n't even think about renting a scooter !, 
  btw we do actually speak ( and understand ) the english language ; think twice before discussing last night 's gangbang or the sorry state of your piles , genital warts , or whatever else in public . 
  that shit is nightmare fuel . 
  thank you very much !, 
  the '90s ... someone please bring them back . 
  pretty please . 
  [ music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g6qdnc4jps ) really [ used ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irvgzffxhfk ) to [ be ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn_hrh8agnk ) way [ better ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgs9qutwc3m ) in the [ 1990s ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1fzj_ayaja ) and early [ 2000s ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w15owdh02k4 ) - and kylie minogue was still hot !, 
  yes , i used to be !, 
  * coperto * is only illegal in the lazio region , not the rest of italy . 
  you should refuse to pay it in rome .
