  he then followed his father in somalia - then an italian colony - and in 1941 he was in charge of what was left of the italian troops in east africa . 
  he gathered the remnants of his army and led them to the [ amba alagi ] ( http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/un/southafrica/eafrica/img/saf-east-africa-76.jpg ) peak , where he and his 7,000 men ( 3000 of whom were poorly armed indigenous allies ) held off some 39,000 commonwealth troops under gen. cunningham 's command from april 17th to may 17th , 1941 . 
  by april 14th , there was no water or ammo left so he sought mussolini 's permission to surrender ; impressed by such a display of bravery , the british conceded the honours of the arms and his troops could march out without a display of disarmament . 
  he died shortly after of malaria , as a pow . 
  * ** luigi durand de la penne ** and his raid on alexandria harbour . 
  in the early hours of 19 december 1941 , the italian submarine * scir\u00e8 * approached the entrance of the harbour at alexandria and released three human torpedoes , which managed to make their way through the british defences by sneaking under some destroyers ' hull . 
  torpedo n. 221 - that 'd be durand 's - headed towards the hms valiant but due to a failure in his equipment he had to swim there and attach the limpet mines by hand ; the other two torpedoes managed to get in as well , their crew managed to place the mines on the other ships and get back . 
  one of them was captured by the egyptians while the other one sneaked out succesfully . 
  durand was forced to resurface and was captured by the british , who tried repeatedly to get info out of him . 
  he resisted until 5:30 am - when the mines were about to explode - and asked to speak with admiral cunningham , duly informing him that the warship they were on was about to blow up . 
  everybody was given the order to disembark and indeed a few minutes later the * hms valiant * , the * hms queen elizabeth * as well as two other merchants nearby were sunk . 
  * ** gabriele d'annunzio ** and the `` flight on vienna '' . 
  in 1918 the war was still dragging out on the alpine front , and the italian supreme command sought to weaken the enemy morale and/or improve that of its own troops ; d'annunzio , also a famous writer who was then serving in the * regia aeronautica * , conceived a daring plan which called for a flight all the way to vienna just to drop a load of ... [ anti-war leaflets ] ( http://www.aereimilitari.org/immagini/storia/igm/ansaldosva/ansaldosva_15.jpg ) . 
  the first two attempts had to be delayed due to bad weather , while the third was successful ; d'annunzio flew all the way from padua to vienna on board of a rickety [ s.v.a. 
  10 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/vittoriale_biplano-ansaldo-sva.jpg ) and a 10-year old boy , the son of a friend of his , also flew with him ; on august 6 , at 9:20 pm , d'annunzio 's squadron reached the austrian capital , the viennese looked up in the sky and were surprised to see that it was raining leaflets ; two enemy fighters had caught sight of them but were subsequently unable to find them , and when they landed nobody took the pilots seriously . 
  the whole voyage had lasted more than 7 hours and had an incredible impact in raising the morale of the italian troops . 
  before becoming a ww1 war hero , was an accomplished cyclist and at the start of the war he tried thrice to enlist but was rejected each and every time because of a menomation ; he then saw fit to ride all the way to the front on his bike , where he was finally accepted as a volunteer and was finally given the chance to distinguish himself in battle . 
  he fell on 6 august 1916 , during an assault on hill 85 ( near monfalcone ) - after having been wounded multiple times , he stood up and threw his crutch at the enemy before being finally mowed down . 
  * ** giovanni battista cacherano ** , commander of the 7,000-men strong piedmontese army at the battle of assietta , during which he had to face 40,000 french troops ... and managed to utterly rout them , killing their commander in the process . 
  * ** eugenio di savoia ** , whose incredibly successful military career began at the battle of mohacs during the ottoman siege of vienna in 1683 , and went on with the battles of zenta , oudenaarde and malplaquet ; he was also the mastermind behind the audacious raid on toulon in 1707 , and the one who managed to held off 90,000 french troops on the rhine with only 30,000 men under his command ( 1734 ) . 
  he was perhaps the most successful commander of the late 17th - early 18th century . 
  * ** pietro micca ** , a turinese soldier who distinguished himself during the city 's siege in 1706 . 
  seeing that the french were about to pour in from a tunnel under the walls , he brought some barrels of gunpowder with him and blew himself , the walls and some hundred frenchmen up the sky . 
  no , seeing that greeks are white and that the racial laws only applied to jews and ` colonials ' . 
  moreover , rhodes was considered part of the italian mainland as it was gained in 1912 ... 
  i do n't think so - quite the contrary , just look at the beano 's ( a british comic ) wartime strips - it 's simply that like most of the things regarding our country 's role in the war , such a subject has been never properly researched . 
  to give you an example , books such as john hersey 's `` a bell for adano '' do not quite offer a. . . flattering portrayal of italians , who are mostly laid out in a rather patronising fashion as incompetent buffoons , cowards/war deserters or just backward people in dire need of ` civilisation ' . 
  all is made even more curious by the fact that the main character , victor joppolo , happens to be italian-american yet he does n't share any of these traits . 
  i would also suggest you to look at the [ soldier 's guide to sicily ] ( https://chiaraborzi.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/soldiers1.jpg ) issued to commonwealth troops at the time of the allied invasion of the island ; its description of the local sicilians and their mores was quite disparaging ( at best ) , not to mention borderline racist ... at least by today 's standards . 
  here 's an excerpt :, 
  * `` sicily has a long and unhappy history that has left it primitive and undeveloped , with many relics of a highly civilised past . 
  saint 's day feasts with their odd mixture of operatic songs and pantomime are a feature of the island ... the sicilian lives on pasta with tomato sauce and a little meat , sardines , tunny fish , cheese or olive oil to add a variety of flavours ; oranges , lemons , almonds are plentiful ; marsala wine , is the popular drink [ ... ] *, 
  * [ ... ] crime is highly organised in all grades of society ; ` gangsterism ' in the usa had its origins in sicilian immigration . 
  morals are supercially very rigid , being based on the catholic religion and spanish etiquette of bourbon times ; they are , in fact , of a very low standard , particularly in agricultural areas . 
  the sicilian is still , however , well known for his extreme jealousy in so far as his womenfolk are concerned , and in a crisis still resorts to the dagger '' . 
  the full page can be found [ here ] ( https://books.google.it/books?id=i568bqaaqbaj&amp;pg=pt94&amp;lpg=pt94&amp;dq=%22spanish+etiquette+of+bourbon%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hjye2c_7nt&amp;sig=oexli1xv5wbouygiv0tr5ldx0se&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=hmkyvj6ybcz2o9gvgdag&amp;ved=0cdiq6aewag#v=onepage&amp;q=%22spanish%20etiquette%20of%20bourbon%22&amp;f=false ) . 
  from our point of view , i believe that the british harboured far more hatred - and prejudice - towards their italian counterparts than the americans ever did . 
  as to why , i do n't know : i 'm not an historian . 
  perhaps we were n't seen as enough of a threat ? 
  given the relatively limited scope of our operations , that seems to be the case . 
  and maybe , * maybe * the very fact that many americans of italian descent played a pivotal role in the war effort was reason enough for not wanting to alienate a significant portion of the troops/workforce . 
  perhaps the month-long ( 17 april - 14/17 may 1941 ) siege of the [ amba alagi ] ( http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/un/southafrica/eafrica/img/saf-east-africa-76.jpg ) peak , during which 7,000 italians managed to hold off some 39,000 commonwealth troops , can count as such ? 
  the place ( which is located in the tigray region of what is today ethiopia ) is quite remote and hard to reach . 
  thank you for the detailed explanation !, 
  correct me if i am wrong , but i also think that the writings of british travelers to italy - especially in the 19th century - may have contributed to the negative perception of our country/people in the english-speaking world . 
  is this true ? 
  again , thank you for your answer !, 
  it is much appreciated . 
  while reading one of beppe severgnini 's books , i came across an excerpt of rev. 
  henry christmas ' travelogue ( ? ), 
  in which he expressed his distaste for roman catholicism ( `` if we had no other reason for being pleased about being protestant , it would be sufficient to consider that our religion prevents us from being as ridiculous as the [ italians ] there '' ) . 
  from this , i gather that while the british certainly had many occasions to get better acquainted with our country , many of them kept looking at it from a rather patronising and anti-catholic point of view nevertheless , thus contributing to the creation of a `` black legend '' of sorts . 
  but again , this is just a theory of mine . 
  btw , i too hated the * dark heart of italy * - it 's full of baloney ( and ridiculous stereotypes !, 
  i had a rather ~ ~ disappointing ~ ~ stressful job interview ... 
  good , i do n't drink coffee . 
  i 've already cut on pc time but might have to start exercising , as you suggested . 
  thank you !, 
  thanks for the advice !, 
  sorry , what do you mean by `` blue light '' ? 
  tried it , does n't seem to work ... 
  these are great advice , thanks a lot !, 
  * i feel that people either tend to downright hate him or praise his ` successful ' internal policy ( mainly older generations ) . 
  * textbooks obviously present fascism under a bad light , but do also explain the regime 's economical/infrastructural programmes ; until the early '60s , history books would stop at the end of ww1 . 
  the war itself is not usually explained very well , and teachers have a tendency to skip directly to the german occupation and the resistance . 
  * there are many , but they 're a joke ( mostly ) . 
  italian high schools tend to be very politicised , and a side effect is that these declarations - while relatively common - are not to be taken seriously . 
  a lot of people would proclaim themselves to be `` communist '' ( or `` fascist '' ) , despite the 16-year-old in question not having the faintest clue of what ( s ) he 's talking about . 
  high schoolers generally regain their sanity after the first year of uni . 
   [ ... ] not too bad things , however , like the pact state \\ church or the school system or the absence of celebration about the end of wwi . 
  i agree with most of what you said , but why would the absence of celebrations about the end of ww1 be a good thing ? 
  i can provide no article - there 's , curiously enough , a lack of them ( even in italian ! ), 
  - but i think i can tell you what happened to the italians living in the colonies . 
  i 'd personally like to do that because this is a subject which is not ~ ~ usually ~ ~ at all discussed , not even among italians ; most of them sadly are n't even aware of the issue . 
  so , ** italians in libya ** would make a fine example . 
  between 1934 and 1940 , they made up 13 % of the country 's population ( there were some 110,000 of them ) and were nearly half of the inhabitants in, 
  tripoli and bengasi . 
  after the war , many returned home but some 44,000 chose to stay behind . 
  however , on september 1st , 1969 , all changed when muhammad gheddafi came to power after having deposed king idris . 
  on july 21 , 1970 all the assets of the italian residents had , by force of a decree of the newly-established libyan revolutionary command council , been confiscated ; the ` colonists ' were ordered to leave with whatever they could carry on their persons while their land , shops , homes , furniture , cars were being requisitioned and their social security accounts frozen ( as far as i know , no compensation was ever paid ) . 
  the last italians had left the country on ** october 7th , 1970 ** ; this date marked a national holiday - the `` day of vengeance '' - until 2011 . 
  only in 2007 these people were allowed to visit the place they lived and grew up in . 
  * look [ here ] ( http://notizie.tiscali.it/media/11/02/italiani_libia_1970.jpg_415368877.jpg ) , [ here ] ( http://www.airl.it/public/asset_images/media_photos/147.jpg ) , [ here ] ( http://www.lindro.it/wp-content/uploads/logo/arton8392.jpg ) and [ here ] ( http://www.airl.it/public/asset_images/media_photos/146.jpg ) for some photos of the exodus ( this is all i could find ! ) . 
  * [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ywg7flauway#t=568 ) 's a short video about their ordeal ; unfortunately it 's in italian w/o subtitles . 
  i know this because a couple of family friends come from there - nobody told me about that in school . 
  there were also many italians in ** eritrea ** and ** somalia ** , but most left after the war or ( in the case of somalia ) in 1991 ; there are still a thousand of them left in eritrea with their schools and all , one of them was the grandmother of a close friend . 
  a very strained one . 
  ianah , but i know that mussolini attempted - and nearly succeeded , thanks to the help of cesare mori ( nicknamed the * prefetto di ferro * , or the `` iron prefect '' ) - to eradicate the presence of the mob from the island . 
  he viewed them as rivals , and a dictator ca n't possibly share any power with anyone but himself ... interestingly enough , the repression mostly targeted the ` smaller fishes ' ; the whole operation had to be brought to an halt because of the war and also the lobbying of those nobles/landlords ( some of whom were members of the pnf ) who were profiting from it . 
  if you 're interested in the subject , i 'd suggest reading * cosa nostra : a history of the sicilian mafia * by john dickie . 
  again , i am not an historian and i can only provide you with what i have learned . 
  how do i ever begin ? 
  well ... historically speaking , italy had fought no less than four ( 4 ) wars of independence against the same enemy : the austrian empire , which would later become austria-hungary . 
  it is no surprise then , that the italians were mostly hostile to any kind of alliance with the very country they considered to be a sworn enemy . 
  yet , in 1882 , an alliance with france was out of the question because of a colonial dispute over tunisia . 
  due to this , the then prime minister francesco crispi saw fit to rekind the country 's ties with a-h and signed a defensive pact - the ** triple alliance ** - with austria and the german empire , a pact deeply unpopular with both the populace and the intellectuals ( can you see the parallel with ww2 ? ) . 
  at that time , austria-hungary still held those italian-speaking bits - namely trentino , trieste , istria and dalmatia - which were considered * terre irredente * , that is , territories under foreign domination where ethnic italians were living and being oppressed . 
  moreover , that same year the execution of an italian patriot by the name of guglielmo oberdan strained such relationship from its very beginning , and crispi 's dreams of getting back these lands by means of peaceful talks was shattered ; it was clear that austria would n't have ceded . 
  which brings us to 1915 . 
  * crispi , the main artifex of the alliance , was no longer alive or in power ;,
