  nobody is questioning the illegitimacy of the whole thing . 
  people were resettled ... that 's what i meant by `` colonised '' ... one thing does not exclude the other !, 
  e al restante 60 % no ... 
  you can thank paul bremer for that one . 
  turns out that completely dismantling the armed forces and intelligence/security apparatus of an already unstable nation is not a smart move in the long term ... terrorists really do like power vacuums . 
  same thing for libya . 
  now now , do n't put yourself down . 
  is n't that pretty average anyway ? 
  unless i got the conversion from imperial wrong ... 
  * gaslighting ensues *, 
  trust me , men are n't that much better off ... ever had to squeeze a stone along the whole lenght of your urethra ? 
  what about those risky double streams , or shaking the shit out of your willy only to find that last drop of piss laying gloriously on your pants ? 
  not to speak about size issues , erectile problems and just about anything having to do with ballsacks ; whoever was in charge of designing the human penis was clearly wrong in the head , or at the very least did n't take his bloody meds !, 
  now - i would be curious to know what exactly makes me an idiot ? 
  and are you by any chance dealing with anger issues , as well ? 
  the 1982 attack on the temple was the doing of palestinian terrorists , not isis . 
  and the reasoning behind it was more political than religious . 
  orwell was right , he just got the timing wrong . 
  wtf britain ? 
  non-secret ballots , porn filters , the snooper 's charter and now this ... 
  more like the extensive use of [ numbered ballots ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secret_ballot#secrecy_vs._reliability ) ... 
  ... by means of which it is possible to link a certain voter to his or her political preferences !, 
  who says mi5 did n't do that already ? 
  i hear vinyl is all the rage these days . 
  those are too costly . 
  just cup your hands in front of your mouth , tarzan-style , and we have a deal .

  boy ... and i thought sheep , geese and oxen were weird enough . 
  watch out , the drunk chick is actually ellen ripley !,

  * press x to not-jason *, 
  but i thought tattoos were for chads ? 
  duuude , you got gilded in under five minutes !, 
  that 's a new record !, 
  do n't think it 's possible , and even if it was i 'm too broke for that shit anyway . 
  france selling louisiana to the u.s. for a pittance would be a close second . 
  the french could 've asked for more dosh though . 
  if only napoleon had read * the art of the deal * ... who am i kidding , he would 've ended up selling it at half the price !, 
  by an emma watson look-alike with a strap-on dildo , or a very feminine penis . 
  in all honesty , no ; many classics do in my opinion come across as kind of dry and it 's hard for me to form an emotional connection . 
  the only times something hit right in the feelz happened when i was perusing through pompeian graffiti and roman burial inscriptions , but i would also throw some of ausonius ' writings to the mix . 
  and italy !, 
  i do n't know about you but for me , he 's a welcome relief from ovid 's erotic mindgames . 
  say what you will but i do like it !, 
  e ' l'unica canzone che salverei da quell ` album . 
  confermo . 
  [ gunslinger girl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gunslinger_girl#anime ), 
  operation barbarossa was doomed to fail , regardless of its timing . 
  the axis could 've never , ever won the eastern front - not least because of their insufficient industrial base/manpower , horrid understanding of logistics , doctrine , arguably inferior designs and rotting economy . 
  hell , the only thing that kept the german war machine running was the systematic plundering of europe !, 
  had the reich not entered the war it would 've collapsed on itself . 
  i agree , rommel was too cool ... for logistics , that is . 
  at least he was n't too cool for art school . 
  the real shocker here is that nationstates is still around .

  minzione d'onore per mr. grey 2.0 e il suo [ ama sadomaso ] ( https://archive.is/5y5vq ) . 
  is this 1997 ? 
  and why would it include parts of central italy ? 
  insubria is even more ridiculous ... 
  italian here . 
  not even the northern league believed in secession , they promised and reneged on just about anything for purely electoral gain !, 
  besides , padania is a geographical expression - which does n't include clearly `` northern '' regions such as the marches or umbria - and it really does n't have an identity of its own . 
  plus the very idea of it conflicts with * slightly * more serious ( but still irrelevant ) autonomist movements such as venetia 's or more serious ones like south tyrol 's ... 
  i would also like to know why add umbria if it 's latium-lite ? 
  not to mention that the nl does n't even push that idea anymore - nowadays they 're just your generic xenophobic party , especially since they discovered all those sweet southern votes !, 
  padania was just as real as teletubbyland and , in all honesty , i 'm surprised foreigners take it so seriously . 
  as for insubria , wel ... it consists of three ( maybe four ) people getting pissed in a mountain hovel ... 
  ** tl ; dr ** the nl knew padania was fake . 
  all that brouhaha was about votes and money all along . 
  man , i loved that game !, 
  afaik if one of the parents is italian then she 's an italian citizen , too . 
  as long as the father had italian citizenship when your wife was born , she should be ok . 
  migrants are not on social assistance ... their upkeep is paid for with eu funds . 
  italy is n't even that much of a welfare state to begin with , at least compared to northern european countries . 
  you may have a point for what concerns social housing system ( which is a horrible mess indeed ) but even then we 're talking about * legal * immigrants with actual families and a permanent * permesso di soggiorno * which means they have a job ; there 's also no being on the dole here unless you 've been legally employed for at least three years and even then , the subsidies last six months maximum and you lose them if you refuse a job offer from the job centre . 
  it 's either that or disability/retirement pension . 
  not much else . 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  you prefer alternative facts ? 
  dude , the lira is no longer legal tender since 2002 . 
  you ca n't even exchange them in banks anymore . 
  fellow shelf-stacker here ... you 're spot on . 
  we * do * use helmets in rome . 
  naples or palermo , on the other hand ... 
  lol !, 
  you think 29 \u00b0 c is too hot ? 
  in rome 40 \u00b0 c are not uncommon , and that 's without taking humidity into consideration ( it 's humid here ) . 
  or you could just try a mid-summer 's day in sicily ... 50 \u00b0 c and no wind ... 
  you can say the same for helena bonham carter . 
  she plays the same goffik character over and over again ... 
  colonel , what 's a russian gunship doing here ? 
  dr. shekelberg strikes again !,
