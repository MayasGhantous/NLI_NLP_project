  there are no evil servicemen and the army can do no wrong except when the plot demands it .

  wasted, 
  which seat will i take ? 
  i find it ironic that the northern league has become a nationalist party . 
  is there any way to avoid getting annexed by italy ? 
  whenever i start a new game in 1861 , the papal states usually manage to hold out some twenty years before being inevitably invaded . 
  the army is useless , building forts seems to be a giant waste of time and the ( admittedly , tiny ) french garrison will always leave at the start of the game no matter what i do . 
  well , it just happened . 
  i 've fallen in love with my third ( ? ), 
  cousin !, 
  she is , simply put , the niece of my grandmother 's sister as well as my biggest crush to date ; she 's a year younger than me . 
  i met her for the first time at a family gathering a couple of years ago and since then i find myself unable to think about pretty much everybody else ... the fact that she seems to reciprocate ( we 've caught ourselves gazing at each other more than once , etc. ), 
  is only making things worse because i am both attracted to her * and * somewhat repulsed by the very thought of being in love with a cousin . 
  i feel like i ca n't resist any longer , but i do n't think that our family - or pretty much everybody else , for that matter - would approve . 
  can such a relationship be considered acceptable ? 
  also , even if i decide to go ahead with this i still do n't have a clue about the most appropriate way of telling her ... we have never spoken about it . 
  what should i say/do ? 
  ** tl ; dr ** : i 'm in love with my cousin , and she seems to reciprocate . 
  would such a relationship be acceptable ?

  so , i have just finished reading `` the sicilian '' . 
  this is my first review and come think of it , i do n't even know whether this is the right place to post it ; this is why i 'd like to apologise in advance if it 's not . 
  also , please excuse my english ... 
  i know it 's terrible but i hope to improve it !, 
  btw this review may contain a few spoilers , so read at your own risk . 
  ** what is this review based on ? 
  the copy i used is the first italian edition from 1987 , which was published as a tie-in to that year 's film by the now-defunct dall ` oglio publishing house ( you can recognise the dude from * highlander * on the cover ) . 
  why is this important ? 
  i noticed that the italian translation contained quite a few supicious interpolations which were not present in the original english ( more on that later ) . 
  since my copy of the book did n't seem to be exactly reliable , i thought it would have been best to compare it with the original - and this is exactly what i ended up doing . 
  the english text is that publicly available on google books ( arrow books , 2000 ) . 
  now , off to the review proper !, 
  ** the setting , plot and characters - what works , and what does n't . 
  * ** the plot ... **, 
  `` the sicilian '' is , perhaps unsurprisingly , set in 1943-1950 sicily . 
  the miseries of war , coupled with the widespread poverty and inequalities ( whose symbol is the unholy alliance between the mafia , the church and the society 's upper strata , which had been dominating the island since time immemorial ) have exasperated the sicilians ; a revolution is in the air . 
  this is also the time in which michael corleone sets foot in the restless island after having carried out the assassination of both virgil sollozzo and sgt. 
  mccluskey : he 'd been forced to go into hiding in the old country , where `` an old friend '' of his father 's ( the ruthless and powerful * don * croce malo ) is waiting for him . 
  michael marries a sicilian girl , she dies , then he 's tasked to bring the feared bandit `` turi '' guiliano with him in the states in the hope that hegembe safe from the clutches of the mafia ... well , from those of the * other * mafia families that is . 
  * ** ... and its characters . 
  but michael , despite having the first quarter of the book revolve around him , is n't really the true protagonist of this story ; salvatore `` turi '' guiliano is , and this is where the problems begin to surface . 
  puzo based the character of guiliano ( the spelling is intentional ) on that of the real-life bandit , terrorist , murderer and self-proclaimed revolutionary [ salvatore giuliano ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salvatore_giuliano ) . 
  unfortunately , this is also where all the similarities to the real word end . 
  while i am ok with the idea that a writer may want to romanticise his characters - there 's nothing wrong with that - puzo went a bit too far by depicting giuliano as an exceedingly beautiful , courteous , fearless and cunning robin hood-like popular hero , whereas his real life counterpart was much , much , * much * less nicer ( to say the least ) . 
  the result is a totally unbelievable , not to mention unlikable , character while puzo himself comes across as a bit of a gary stu . 
  but the other characters are n't immune by this kind of superficial characterisation , either . 
  sicilians are generally portrayed as a lovable bunch of blood-thirsty , passionate , corrupt , superstitious rascals ; mainlanders , on the other hand - and in this book they only represent `` the state '' , or serve ( through the * carabinieri * ) as the `` guardians '' of the established order - are depicted as heartless , ruthless yet somewhat-inept oprressors . 
  there 's no depth !, 
  sicilians = good , mainlanders = bad , and that 's the end of it . 
  a case unto itself is , however , that of cpl. 
  a loyal member of the * carabineri * , he gets court-martialled after guiliano stormed the barracks the very day he was on guard duty ; the distraught policeman ends up pleading his allegiance to the bandit ( !, 
  ) , something that would be * very * unlikely in real life . 
  indeed , he 's the only copper depicted in a sympathetic light ... but only because he too is sicilian . 
  the character of passatempo is another ruthless brigand , the sickest motherfucker this side of sicily , notorious for his fondness of rape ( and violence in general ) . 
  well , does n't he end up - inspired by the shining exaple of guiliano - repenting and trying to change his old ways mid-book , not to mention all of a sudden ? 
  you betcha . 
  on the good side , puzo clearly had a talent for dialogues ( i believe he was among those who wrote the godfather 's script ? 
  ) : shame he did n't stick to them , for i 'm afraid descriptions are n't his * forte * . 
  * ** the setting and its description **, 
  we 've already had a quick look at the setting , and we 've seen that there 's an almost-manichean dichotomy between sicily and the evil mainland , to which puzo refers just as `` rome '' . 
  and the usage of that word in the book is painfully obsessive , as if the author disliked the city , the looks of it , its inhabitants or whatever it embodied !, 
  aesthetically this is a curious choice , which leads sometimes to an awkward and repetitive flow of the sentence - in the book there are countless examples of several periods such as `` to lift the yoke of rome '' , `` rome they despised '' , `` they 'll follow you in a war against rome '' , all in a row ... after a while it becomes both annoying ( i 'm roman , mind you ) * and * exhausting . 
  also - puzo clearly did some research , but only to a certain extent . 
  while the plot roughly follows real-life events , the backdrop is something ridiculous : his idea of sicily is pretty much a big , giant stereotype that would n't look out of place in a 18th-century gothic novel . 
  corrupt , murderous clergy ? 
  check . 
  passionate , superstitious southerners making wild sex in the fields between a robbery and another ? 
  check . 
  looong descriptions of the island 's overly luscious and somewhat-menacing countryside ? 
  war deserters galore ? 
  cunning abbots with a dark past ? 
  amoral townsfolk ? 
  check , check and check . 
  but the author 's shoddy research also shows in more ( or less ? ), 
  subtle ways : just look at the characters/place names . 
  we 've got gems like passatempo ( `` hobby '' ) , hector * adonis * ( really ? 
  ) , don croce malo ( don croce `` bad '' ? 
  how subtle of you ) , la venera ( the `` she-venus '' ? 
  ) , the bellampo barracks ( `` fort beautiful lightning ? '', 
  charming name ... ) and so on . 
  finally , history is never - save for a few exceptions - black and white : in this case , the author neglected to tell all the previous events leading up to the birth of the local independence movement ( s ) . 
  it 's not like the sicilians woke up one day and suddenly wanted to shoot every pesky mainlander in sight . 
  also , calling romans `` northerners '' ? 
  you 're asking for trouble , mr. puzo . 
  ** differences between the italian and english versions **, 
  as i 've mentioned earlier , the ( rather sloppy ) first italian translation has more than a few flaws - sometimes the sentences are a bit awkward , some words appear to have been translated literally from the original english and what is worse , whoever was in charge of the translation added a few more lines of his ( her ? ), 
  own invention . 
  here 's an example - at page 128 , guiliano ambushes a convoy belonging to don croce with the help of some sicilian carters . 
  one of the convoy drivers gets off and starts cursing in a heavy ( and , arguably , fake ) roman accent :, 
  ( `` oi , get those fuckin ' carts off the road ! '' ), 
  guess what ? 
  i checked ( i was thinking : come on , how can puzo know shit about our vernacular ? 
  not even other italians can get it right ! ), 
  and ... surprise , there 's no such line in the original text . 
  this is n't even the only one .
