  * the new war had been initiated by austria , so the provisions of the defensive treaty did not apply ;, 
  * emperor franz-joseph had in the meanwhile put in place discriminatory practices and restrictions against the ethnic italians living in the empire , further angering the italian public opinion ;, 
  * the nationalists and the intellectuals , such as gabriele d'annunzio , began stoking the flames of war so much that those in favour of war became as many as those who favoured neutrality ( catholics * and * socialists ) . 
  * this led to the signing of the secret pact of london in april 1915 , a move that francesco giolitti - the then pro-neutrality prime minister - did not agree to . 
  giolitti tried to impede , or at least delay , the country 's entry into war but with no success as the king too was now all for it ; he then resigned in favour of antonio salandra - the very same man who had signed the pact of london - who wasted no time ( as the anti-war party was growing ) to summon the parliament and declare war against italy 's former ` allies ' . 
  in the end war-mongering , revanchism and rampant nationalism is what brought us into the war . 
   [ ... ] why did italy expect anything positive to come out of joining the war ? 
  was n't it obvious that a quick victory over austria-hungary would be completely impossible ? 
  nobody expected a quick victory but many - too many , actually - were deeply unsatisfied with the then-current state of things and that was reason enough to go to war and be forever done with the austrians . 
  the war also provided a handy release for the nationalist tensions which had been boiling within italy and europe as a whole . 
  and actually , most felt that the lands they were promised were worthy a lenghty war so here you go . 
  what 's with the ultra-orthodox jews ? 
  i hear that many israelis do n't like them that much . 
  also , what is the relationship between your average israeli and ( arab ) - christians ? 
  what is something i should absolutely eat or drink when ( more like if ... ) i 'll visit ? 
  finally , is it true that tel aviv is one of the best places in israel as far as more mundane things like parties and girls are concerned ( a friend of ours is studying there and , uhm , it seems like he 's having a jolly good time . 
  not that i 'm interested , of course ... ) . 
  thank you !, 
  * both mario rigoni stern 's * the sergeant in the snow * and giulio bedeschi 's * centomila gavette di ghiaccio * are autobiographical accounts of the authors ' experiences on the russian front , told from an italian pov . 
  * paolo caccia dominioni 's * alamein 1933 -- 1962 : an italian story * deals with the north african campaign . 
  * you might also like a more technical read ; i 'd suggest you , in this case , having a look at j.j. sadkovich 's * the italian navy in ww2 * and * the origins of mussolini 's wars * ( always assuming that you manage to find it ! ) . 
  * as far as the royal italian navy is concerned , you could have a look at angelo iachino 's * tramonto di una grande marina * , but i do n't know whether it 's been translated into english yet ( besides , i think it 's a bit too apologetic ) . 
  if you do n't mind a film suggestion , have a look at * el alamein - the line of fire * . 
  it is very well done and deals with the italian campaign in north africa ... but avoid * captain corelli 's mandolin * ( book and film ) - it 's simply libelous !, 
  in his book , * red horizons * , ion mihai pacepa - who , until his defection in 1978 , was the # 1 of the romanian * securitate * - alleged that ceausescu literally sold the right of romanian jews ( and germans ) to emigrate to their respective governments , in exchange for hard currency . 
  and i think that like yugoslavia , with whom communist romania enjoyed friendly relationships , the country generally pursued a somewhat-independent foreign policy ; for example , romanian athletes did n't boycott the 1984 olympics and due to the country 's * relatively * liberal stance ( mainly a fa\u00e7ade ) , the u.s. granted favourable loans to what was seen as a potential mole in the eastern bloc . 
  these loans , however , had to be repayed and this is one of the reasons as to why communist romania was forced to export much of what it produced , leading to the shortages in the '80s . 
  if pacepa 's allegations are to be believed , then the ceausescus did almost everything in their power to get hold of cold , hard cash . 
  yes , in rome we had the [ pierleoni ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierleoni_family ) family . 
  however , the founder of that house - a man by the name of baruch - converted to christianity in the early 11th century so i 'm not sure it could count as such ... 
  books . 
  i 'm currently helping out ( as an apprentice ) at a bookbinder/restorer - one of the last left in my city - and i 've come to appreciate a good book with decent paper , binding and cover . 
  i 've now seen my fair share of brand-new holy bibles intended for church service break open right before my eyes or literally shedding leaves , so much that parishes all around city are our biggest customers . 
  i 've seen beautiful books entrapped in cheap fake-leather covers and crumbling paperbacks ; giving them a good ` home ' is one of the pleasures in life ... 
  the quality of the paper the book is made of is also very important . 
  i for one dislike , abhor , downright * hate * glossy paper in all of its incarnations ; because to me , touching it feels like scraping nails against a blackboard . 
  also , when i buy a book i always have a look at the text . 
  is this edition truly complete ? 
  is the translation reliable ? 
  what about the critical apparatus ? 
  is the source material original or is this just a translation of another ( sometimes partial ) translation ? 
  and lastly , can i open this book knowing that the cover wo n't stay bent ? 
   [ ... ] were they the exception or the norm and were there difference between british , french , and spanish colonies in this regard ? 
  in our case that seemed to be the norm , sadly . 
   [ ... ] were there difference between british , french , and spanish colonies in this regard ? 
  i can only give you an insight into former italian colonies which have quite a bad record . 
  to be fair , though , since the end of ww2 we had little influence over these lands and most of that record is due to later events . 
  * ** eritrea ** : first colonised in 1882 . 
  occupied by the british in 1942 , formally lost by italy in 1947 and then federated with ethiopia in 1952 ; it gained independence in ** 1993 ** , and since then it 's got a human rights record worthy of north korea , thanks to its first ( and only ) president , isaias afewerki . 
  * ** somalia ** : an italian colony between 1890 and 1947 , then a un trusteeship administered by italy from 1949 to july 1 , 1960 when it was merged with british somaliland to form the country we know today . 
  at first relatively prosperous and democratic , it undertook an healthy change of leadership in ** 1969 ** when mohammed siad barre took power with the * placet * of the soviet union . 
  he ruled until 1991 , leaving somalia the human rights mess we know today ; religious strifes and piracy are also grave concerns . 
  * ** libya ** : gained by the italians after defeating the ottoman empire during the italo-turkish war of 1911 . 
  a large revolt soon broke out and actual control of the country was re-established , albeit with brutal ( even by the time 's standards ) means in 1921 ; as a political entity , libya was first created in 1934 and was home to almost 110,000 colonists , whose descendants [ were expelled ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2qiazy/any_major_european_populations_that_stayed_behind/cn6hawz ) in 1970 ; partitioned between the french , british and americans , it was lost in 1947 ; it formally gained independence in 1951 . 
  in ** 1969 ** muhammad gheddafi overthrew king idris and ruled until 2011 . 
  the country 's currently embroiled in a civil war . 
  * ** ethiopia ** : briefly an italian colony from its conquest in 1936 to 1941 . 
  hail\u00e9 selassi\u00e9 regained control of his empire but was deposed by a coup in ** 1974 ** . 
  the ussr-backed * derg * ( junta ) fell in 1991 , the former province of eritrea seceded after a long war in 1993 and the country is nowadays relatively stable . 
  many of those now-forgotten italian singers from the '70s / '80s are * still * popular in russia . 
  one is tot\u00f2 cutugno - on one hand , nobody cares about him in his home country ; on the other , he 's doing tourn\u00e9es all over the former ussr . 
  another such example is the * sanremo music festival * , nowadays widely considered by most italians the absolute worst as far as music is concerned , not to mention a total waste of taxpayer money ; yet , many russians ( especially older generations ) are still watching it and what is most worrying , they actually like it !, 
  in italy , television - or , better , * radiovision * as it was known back then - made its first debut on 4 june 1939 and the programmes were produced by the eiar ( the state agency tasked with radio broadcasts ) . 
  pre-existing structures were adapted for tv broadcasting , a few ones were created from scratch and most ( if not all ) of the programming was done live with a conventional - actually , an early variant of - analog broadcasting ; there was little recording going on and this also why almost nothing has survived to this day . 
  the tv service was hastily suspended after the country 's entry in ww2 ( 10 june 1940 ) and the few archives were either scattered or lost during the war . 
  there 's a book on the matter , diego verdegiglio 's excellent essay * la tv di mussolini * . 
  * [ this ] ( http://www.museoscienza.org/dipartimenti/catalogo_collezioni/images/02229.jpg ) is one of the few surviving early tv sets . 
  * [ here ] ( http://www.museoradiotv.rai.it/dl/portali/site/articolo/contentitem-da5e594f-7fb3-41a6-bf62-b2ab2bb81418.html ) 's an interesting slideshow ( requires silverlight ! ) . 
  * [ here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/6/6c/tele.jpg ) , [ here ] ( http://www.cartolinedalventennio.it/images/phocagallery/archivio_magneti_marelli/1940_sperimentazione_televisione_mm.jpg ) , [ here ] ( http://www.radiomarconi.com/marconi/eiar_tv.jpg ) , [ here ] ( http://www.radiomarconi.com/marconi/eiar_massimo.jpg ) and [ here ] ( http://www.radiomarconi.com/marconi/monoscopio/finetrasmissioni_eiar.jpg ) are some rare photos . 
  * a crappy , one-star motel we used to work with charged a russian tourist 4000 $ for a three-night stay ; of course , he did n't take it well ( but he proceeded to wreak havoc in * our * office , not the motel 's ) . 
  * a dude posted a pretty vague ad , according to which they were looking for new office employees . 
  i went to that place , and the interview lasted less than three minutes : this made me suspicious . 
  i inquired about my task more than once and the manager repeatedly evaded my questions , only to tell me to come back that wednesday . 
  i did , and when i got in his assistant handed a sheet for me to sign ... it read something along the lines of : * everything that may happen is my responsibility only , and neither my overseer nor the [ scam corporation , inc. ] will be held responsible . 
  i also accept to do this trial period for free '' * . 
  needless to say i did n't sign - and discovered later that they wanted me to sell their shit door-to-door . 
  * my grandma was scammed by some neapolitan ladies at the bus stop . 
  they first befriended her and then proceeded to tell her that the old lady they were with was about to inherit `` a very large sum '' , but needed some cash in order to buy stamps and pay for the notary . 
  she foolishly agreed to hand over her wedding ring in return for a share , and when the scammers got hold of it , they escaped ... basically a real-life 419 . 
  yours is a big , definitely not overpopulated country with a balanced demographic and enough resources to keep the economy afloat . 
  moreover , i 'd assume that being a superpower - as well as the home of many of the biggest corporations/industries around * and * the world 's largest economy - has its benefits ... 
  also , i sense that your companies fear little competition on their home turf . 
  nowadays most of our successful enterprises deal with niche sectors , and many of the ( few ) big corporations that have managed to survive the transition - such as steel mills - are being subsidised by the government , or else they 'd be wiped out in a second . 
  i do n't think that your average american worker has to deal with scores of other people looking for the same job : immigrant labour is plenty and cheap , so employers prefer to hire them for menial jobs . 
  the public administration is its own lobby , whose butt is covered by the unions . 
  our factory workers are n't competititve enough , but lowering their ( already low ) wages would do no benefit . 
  there 's some room in retail and office jobs , but the sheer number of people applying is preventing most of us from securing one . 
  as for graduates , we got no use for them ... 
  ** 1 ) ** when i was a child , i was nearly run over by a bus . 
  i think that was frightening enough . 
  ** 2 ) ** as far as embarrassing things go , i guess you never had to take a dump in one of [ these ] ( http://todaystoilet.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cesso_panetteria_michele_goina.jpg ) op ? 
  at the barracks i was in , most of the stalls had broken doors and a few did n't have one at all . 
  also , there was no toilet paper ... just old newspapers . 
  due to concerns about people cheating their way through the exam , you 're not allowed to go in the loo by yourself and even then you have to hurry . 
  i was doing well until one of these motherfuckers got in the gents ' , called for the latecomers to hussle it up and then proceeded to inspect the stalls - he knocked gently on the door but * opened it * instead , thus revealing the poor bastard inside ( me ! ), 
  in all his glory . 
  the guy noped the fuck out of there and a few minutes later i walked out in shame . 
  ** 3 ) ** once i was at the cinema with my cousin when a couple of frenchmen sat one/two rows below us . 
  i started joking , and at one point i ended up saying : `` ha !, 
  do these fuckers know that we 've got no subtitles in italy ? '' .
