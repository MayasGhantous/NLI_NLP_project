  `` we do '' . 
  i got the inspiration from my previous [ address ] ( https://www.google.it/maps/place/piazza+dei+quiriti,+00192+roma/@41.9093193,12.4641388,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x132f605f7a9e03e1:0xb6ab57e4995565e2 ) . 
  * i was forced to play tombola with family until 3:00 am at nye . 
  oh , the fun . 
  * that time our professor decided to explain every damn footnote out of the * divine comedy * on a saturday afternoon while everyone in the class was either tired , wanting to ~ ~ die ~ ~ leave or both . 
  i actually fell asleep . 
  * our parents brought us to the finnish circus once . 
  some dudes dressed like garden gnomes threw dishes at each other while yelling `` ah-eh-eh-eh-oh-eh ! '', 
  for a whole hour . 
  we got out during the interval . 
  * papillon * , detailing henri charri\u00e8re 's ( alleged ) escape attempts from french guyana . 
  it 's the ultimate page-turner , if you ask me . 
  blackadder . 
  i 'll probably come across as rude , but you know we do n't have * siesta * here right ? 
  and honestly the trite , overly-abused concept of `` bella figura '' foreigners seem to love so much is actually more about the way you behave in a social setting than what you 're wearing ... moreover , i would like to point out how most italians - including myself - are n't actually obssessed with stylish clothing . 
  the situation was quite desperate right after the war and most of the infrastructures such as railways , roads , factories , hospitals , schools and the like were either destroyed , unusable or in a very sorry state . 
  ** 1 ) ** in big cities , housing was scarce . 
  shantytowns popped up in the big cities ' outskirts ( particularly rome 's , where they were bulldozed in time for the 1960 olympics ) and even the schools were n't being used for their intended purpose as they housed the * sfollati * - that is , those who had lost their homes to the bombs . 
  ** 2 ) ** there were many health and social concerns , and naples itself actually suffered a pretty major typhus epidemic ; prostitution there was rampant ( as in : mothers selling their own daughters for food ) and so were stds . 
  ** 3 ) ** food ( particularly bread and meat ) had been scarce for some five years due to rationing , and people assaulted the bakeries from time to time ; many perceived ` luxuries ' such as coffee or sugar were unobtainable well before the war due to the league of nations ' sanctions against italy from 1936 . 
  in their stead , italians drank ` chicory coffee ' without any sweetener - a truly nasty concoction . 
  ** 4 ) ** going from city to city was unfeasible due to the rail and road connections not having being re-established yet . 
  even moving within the big cities such as rome , naples and milan was problematic at best due to the debris on the road and the fact the bombings also targeted the tram and bus depots - meaning that you 'd have had to take a military lorry instead of a now-gutted out tram or trolleybus . 
  ** 5 ) ** due to the allies printing the am-lira ( whose counterfeit variants were just as many as the real thing ) in massive amounts , the official currency greatly devalued and inflation was rampant . 
  the black market was also thriving ; for example , the flea fair at rome 's * porta portese * was born as a place where to buy stolen engine components . 
  ** 6 ) ** if you were an italian living in the julian marches or istria ( then in the country 's far north-east ) , things would 've been getting ugly pretty fast ; the region has had a troubled history and this was arguably its worst hour . 
  * to begin with , the area was inhabitated by both italians and slovenes/croats . 
  with the rise of fascism , a rather aggressive campaign of forced italianisation was undertaken by the central government , and these people did not obviously take it kindly . 
  croatian and slovene partisans were suppressed . 
  in 1940 , italy entered the war ; then assisted in the 1941 invasion of yugoslavia and when it surrendered in 1943 , the area ( as well as most of northen/central italy ) was taken over by the germans . 
  after they retreated , a social/political/military vacuum had taken place , with the yugoslav partisans easily taking control of what were now only nominally italian lands . 
  * these partisans set out to punish those people whom they thought had collaborated with the fascist government in oppressing the aforementioned minorities , but in doing so they also targeted many innocent civilians ; sometimes , even the ethnic italian members of the partisan formations were purged . 
  all those people were either killed and their bodies thrown in the karst sinkholes ( the * foibe * ) or were uncerimoniously dumped in there whilst still alive . 
  * private retaliations were rampant in that corner of the country due to the strifes among the various ethnic groups - without an army to protect them , many italians were killed ( this was also due to petty feuds between neighbouring families ) in the way described above and the rest was forced to flee , bringing what they could carry on their persons . 
  from 1943 to 1949 , some 5000 italians were killed while a further 300,000 was forced to leave and their possessions requisitioned . 
  here 's a pic of [ warehouse n. 18 ] ( http://www.goodmorningtrieste.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/giornale-di-brescia-4.jpg ) , were the goods w/o claimants were stored . 
  * these former italian lands were then partitioned by the allies , who put most of them under yugoslav control . 
  trieste itself was under yg occupation for 40 days and would n't be re-united to italy until 1954 ; the rest of the julian marches , istria as well as the city of zara were officially annexed by that country in 1947 . 
  many of the toponyms were also changed after the war and you can now find these on any guidebook , even though many places ( mainly on the coast ) are now officially bilingual following the treaty of osimo of 1975 . 
  * when these italians escaped to quieter corners of their own country , they were put in rail convoys ; one of those stopped in bologna and the * italian * partisans there - who were mostly communists - believed that the refugees were fascist collaborators escaping what they thought was the ` workers ' paradise ' . 
  they proceeded to insult and throw rocks at them , who were then put in camps . 
  many of the refugees settled in a suburb then right outside rome , which would later become a city district of their own ( the * giuliano-dalmata * ) . 
  * lastly - due to a good-neighbour policy with yugoslavia , which also claimed other parts of north-eastern italy as war reparations , these killings were only recently ( 2005 ) recognised by * our own * government and the very subject is still virtually taboo in italy . 
  the communists claim it never happened , left-wing squatters regard the exiles as fascists , neo-fascists like to use the events for propaganda purposes and according to the anpi - that is , the partisan veterans ' association - even talking about it is a disservice to the resistance ( seeing that it was n't entirely without fault ) . 
  you ca n't speak about it without offending someone . 
  the only good book on the matter with an english translation i can think of is arrigo petacco 's essay * a tragedy revealed : the story of the italian population of istria , dalmatia and venezia giulia , 1943-1956 * . 
  ** 7 ) ** if you were an italian living in the colonies , the situation would have been a bit better . 
  italian east africa was under british occupation and the colonists engaged in [ guerrilla warfare ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_guerrilla_war_in_ethiopia ) from late 1941 to autumn 1943 ; most had left ethiopia after the end of the war , while a few thousands stayed in somalia and eritrea . 
  libya was partitioned among british , french and americans but gained independence in 1951 ; some 30,000 italians stayed in the country until 1970 , when [ they were forcibly expelled ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2qiazy/any_major_european_populations_that_stayed_behind/cn6hawz ) right after muhammad gheddafi 's rise to power .

  it 's been always like that , both the carabinieri and the gdf hold smgs while doing road checks . 
  oh jesus fucking christ , enough bs in two lines . 
  the so-called `` mafia capitale '' in rome was nothing more than a bunch of dishonest councillors profiteering from the influx of immigrants , nothing like ` the godfather ' . 
   [ ... ] here was an amazing atmosphere even with 83 % of romes police not being there it still felt safe . 
  83 % of rome 's * traffic * police . 
  the ` real ' police and the * carabinieri * were all pretty much at their places . 
  that sounds pretty much like * you * . 
  and it 's a news article about ( admittedly , a significant part of ) the city 's * traffic * cops . 
  as i 've already said , both the police and the * carabinieri * were doing their duty on nye . 
   no idea how far a recipe like this goes back , though . 
  it 's pretty ` ancient ' . 
  the * cacio e pepe * is a traditional roman dish , whose recipe dates back to the early 19th century at the very least . 
  a\u00ecnate , curri currenno , ve ' !, 
  i 'm afraid i must disprove your assumption - there was indeed some kind partisan activity in pretty much every country occupied by the nazis ; italy , france , greece , poland , yugoslavia , the netherlands , just to name a few ... all had partisan movements . 
  as far as proper `` revolts '' go , such episodes did in fact happen from time to time - in 1943 , the population of naples rose against the germans and [ managed to expel them ] ( http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/quattro_giornate_di_napoli ) after four days of fighting ; in poland , there was the failed [ warsaw ghetto uprising ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_ghetto_uprising ) ... 
  why people did n't rise up sooner ? 
  the germans had every advantage and could have crushed such revolts very easily . 
  by 1943 , the allies were closing in so it became possible to resist long enough to receive external support : to give you an idea , the warsaw uprising failed because stalin chose not to back the rebels ( despite russian troops being a few kilometres away ) , and the italians at [ cephalonia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacre_of_the_acqui_division ) did not receive any external support as well . 
  also , one should not underestimate the impact of collaborationism : the germans had made extensive use of local militias ( such as the g.n.r. 
  in central and northern italy - what was then the italian social republic - or the security battalions in greece , the milice in vichy france ) which posed a significant threat . 
  i believe it is also harder to fight against * other italians * , * other greeks * , * other french * than against a foreign enemy ... 
  you clearly know shit about roman pizza . 
  i 'd suggest trying these places , truly the best pizzas in town . 
  * the * panificio mosca * ( via candia , 16 ; prati district ), 
  * * l'arte bianca * ( via di donna olimpia , 188 ; monteverde nuovo district ; take-away ), 
  * * prelibato * ( viale di villa pamphili , 214 ; monteverde nuovo ; take-away ), 
  i think we should begin by shedding lights on some aspects :, 
  * the inquisition was n't a monolithic entity . 
  there were different - and fairly independent - branches of it , the most notorious of which was the spanish inquisition ( founded in 1478 ) . 
  there was also the * congregazione della sacra romana e universale inquisizione * ... the roman inquisition , that is , whose jurisdiction applied to most states of the italian peninsula ( except for lucca , florence and venice - which had its own system ) ; interestingly enough it was established much later than its spanish counterpart , in 1542 . 
  * the inquisition , or at least its roman branch , was quite different from what we tend to think of it today ; it was basically an organisation tasked with censorship , which was done through the * index librorum prohibitorum * - a list whose books/essays/treaties were found to be in contrast with the church 's doctrine . 
  in order for you to publish your work , you had to apply for - and be granted - the * imprimatur * first ( the bureau 's authorisation to print ) and only then you were allowed to publish it : the books that did n't meet the criteria or were smuggled ... these were usually protestant treatises ... were requisitioned and burned , and the clandestine printers ( if there were any in the country ) , jailed . 
  * as far as its reputedly fearsome tribunal was concerned , the defendant - whose writings got the author in trouble , having caught the eye of the censors - usually had the right to defend him/herself in court and to summon witnesses in his/her defence ; in this respect , the trials were remarkably fair for the time . 
  also , people rarely underwent torture and executions ( not always by means of burning ) happened even more seldom ; authors like giordano bruno was an exception , rather than the rule . 
  * who did the roman inquisition burn then ? 
  if you - like bruno - had espoused heretical beliefs ( which in his case were hardly christian ) , published them without the bureau 's approval and refused more than once to repudiate them ... mocking the jury in the process as he did , well , then you may have been dealt with . 
  i 'm not justifying their means but capital punishments were carried out rather seldom and before getting to that point , you would have been given the possibility to defend yourself in a relatively fair trial . 
  * who did the spanish inquisition target ? 
  the two organisations had different goals and unlike its roman counterpart - more focused on censorhip - the spanish/portuguese branches mainly targeted * conversos * ( jews who had been forced to convert to catholicism ) and * moriscos * ( former muslims - not necessarily arabs or berbers ! ), 
  simply because many of them were deemed to be ` false converts ' and thus ` untrustworthy ' . 
  admittedly , its methods were a tad worse than those employed by its italian counterpart but still ... 
  * who was responsible for the deaths of ` the witches ' / unrepentant protestants elsewhere ? 
  the magistrates operating in the various italian , and european , states of the time : the secular authorities ... here 's who . 
  * how many died at the hands of the inquisition , * roman and not * ? 
  historians do not agree over the exact number , but some 100,000 trials took place all over europe throughout the centuries , and some 40,000 defendants were put to death . 
  * also , protestants were in many cases much more harsher towards non-conformists than the inquisition ( s ) ever were . 
  much of today 's stereotypes about such organisations come from 18th/19th-century works of literature , whose authors took - more often than not - an anti-clerical ( or at least anti-catholic ) stance .
