  imagine that i use the image of you in a crowd with the text `` people marching for the kkk '' . 
  you will sue my ass off ), 
  `` backgrounds '' are a bit of a grey area . 
  holy shit , the building in the second picture are in my neigbourhood !, 
  ( no , it is not that bad . 
  it 's just these building that look bad ), 
  it will , in the sense that you may not be able to find a seat . 
  nothing will change if you are able to get a seat , but trying to take a train on the spot is risky . 
  btw , we are talking about the high speed train here . 
  the ** frecciarossa ** ( or ** italo ** , run by a different company ) . 
  `` regular '' train do n't request to book your seat ( as far as i know ) , but they are obviously much slower ( and have less comfort ) . 
  forget the 1.5-2 h , that it 's the travel time for high speed trains . 
  high speed trains will cost more , even if you can find quite a deal sometime if you can book well in advance . 
  so , if you use the high speed trains you can use a day to visit florence , if you wish . 
  i 'm afraid that you ca n't do that for cinque terre . 
  that 's easily a 4.5 trip one way , taking the fastest route . 
  sulla is very controversial . 
  we have very few description of what happened , for what we know he simply disapparead from history . 
  obviously something happened , but we do n't have any real clue of what . 
  uh well , that 's because you read an oversimplicistic story . 
  wikipedia has a decent ( but not particularly good ) page on him . 
  if we have to really do a tl ; dr we can say that what made him `` exceptional '' was the fact that he stepped down from his role of dictators as the enemy was won , instead of keeping the position until his the end of the `` term '' . 
  ( also , historical reports of the time were not exactly objective . ), 
  a roman `` dictator '' was a very different figure than a modern dictator . 
  it was risky , yes , but still heavily istituzionalized ( the wiki page is good here ) . 
  usually it * did n't * end badly . 
  even if your 200 $ to 15 $ it 's a bit extreme , you should expect something like that . 
  first of all , an used book ca n't be sold for the full price . 
  assuming that your book is in pristine conditions that is at best a 150-130 price tag . 
  then the guy ** have ** to earn a big fat share of the price because he is taking the risk to have the item in his shop for a longtime , maybe so long that he will not be able to sell it anymore . 
  so yeah , 200 to 15 $ is a shitty deal , but not too far away from a normal price . 
  ehi , remember when the simpsons were actually funny ? 
  those were good times . 
  uhm , that 's what i said . 
  they have to put a big markup beacuse college textbook go out of market quickly . 
  if they have 3 used copy of the same textbook , for example , they need to sell them as if one copy is enough to at least earn back all the money spent . 
  ( i 'm using random numbers , it 's just to make an example ), 
  being unable to sort out the easiest typing mistake . 
  like , she say that she has a cold , i write `` oh , you 'll get bettr '' dropping the e by accident and she reply `` what ? '' . 
  for fuck 's sake , how can a missing `` e '' makes that sentence incomprensibile ? 
  we were talking about your cold !, 
  it really ticks me off , she does it every fucking time . 
  `` oh , by the way i 'm going to the grcery later '', 
  `` what ? '', 
  `` ehi , wan na go to watch a movi tomorrow ? '', 
  `` what ? '', 
  `` do you want to eat pzza ? '', 
  `` what ? '', 
  holy.fucking.shit . 
  that was just an example , not a transcription word to word of what happened . 
  i summarized . 
  nah , do n't think so . 
  it 's not like i make a typo so often , also this does n't looks like something she could do . 
  that 's actually very sad . 
  10 dollars for a once ( more or less ) of a lifetime special event is not `` not wasting money '' , it 's being so poor that you can not afford more than 10 dollars in litterally everything outside basic needs . 
  there is a difference between expensive and 10 dollars . 
  do you really think that people who buy those ring do that as a rebellion against consumism ? 
  they buy them because they * want * a ring for a special event . 
  but all they can afford is 10 dollars . 
  that seems to be : `` avoid the sun '' . 
  they did n't neglect that . 
  they actual filmed the whole stuff 'till the end of the first book , but decided to move that part as the first part of the second movie . 
  probably they thought that they would need a direct connection without switching to a different protagonist for a lot of times . 
  ( also , they wanted to postpome the whole `` kid as human sacrifice '' stuff , probably ), 
  years ago i sent an email to a movie theatre asking `` if it is possible to know which is the last day that [ insertmovie ] would be in the theatre '' . 
  they replied with `` yes '' . 
  just `` yes '' . 
  this is absolutely the most astounding yes that i receveid asking something . 
  no body hair . 
  i used vueling this year and the year before . 
  never had a single problem with them . 
  i read it as `` every time i pooped in a movie '' and was like `` wait , what ? '', 
  so you basically lived in a superhero comic . 
  they actually did this in the very first years of audio movie . 
  for example in many european countries laureal & hardy voice overs used a very peculiar way of speaking , giving them a kinda of british accent and putting the wrong stress on some words . 
  they did that to mock the very first movies of the duo , where they actually spoke in a foreign language ... 
  in a bad way . 
  still nowadays the `` laurel & hardy '' way of speaking is very famous and peculiar , everybody knows that way of speaking . 
  and right now there is and admin of abs screaming `` we are popular again !, 
  we are popular again '' . 
  the perpetrator sounds good for a villain . 
  `` oh noes batman , the perpetrator is at it again '', 
  they do . 
  it 's very , very noticeable . 
  if you have no idea that means that in your country they did a regular voice over . 
  if they used the mocking one you could n't miss it . 
  i 'm not sure i understood . 
  if you are asking if everyone * in those countries * knows about the mocking accent , yes they do . 
  because it 's not a nuance , it 's basically a couple of notches less than borat . 
  you ca n't miss it . 
  if you are asking if everyone know * why * the mocking accent is used , well no . 
  those very first film are lost in the foreign version as far as i know , the version they still nowadays use were dubbed at a later times . 
  then you are not from one of those countries . 
  i woke up early in the morning for the purpose of doing a nice ride from my house to the vatican , through some landmarks of rome . 
  i rode by the colosseum , the imperials forum , largo di torre argentina ( where caesar was probably killed ) , campo de fiori market , castel sant ` angelo and then st. peter basilica . 
  i do n't live in the city centre , so you have to add a 30-40 minutes of riding on the streets before that . 
  on the way back i used the bike line on the tiber 's bank up to the tiberina island , wandered around a bit in the old jewish neighborhood and the i reached the closest metro station ( at the colosseum ) because it was getting too hot and i was tired . 
  ( plus , the traffic ), 
  i 'm very proud of it . 
  i told you in the first post .
