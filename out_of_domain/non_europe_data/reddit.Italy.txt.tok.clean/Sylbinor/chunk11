  they did a voice over using a fake british accent and using the wrong stress on words . 
  they did so to mock their very firsts movies which were actualy shot re-acting all the scenes in different languages . 
  not *** every one *** did this , but some europen countries did this . 
  they speak like fucking walking stereotipes , you ca n't miss it if you speak the language . 
  the key words here are `` voice over '' and `` some european countries '' . 
  if you do n't have idea of what i 'm talking about is because you cleary are a native english speaker or was born in a country who used a regular voice over . 
  are we done shouting now ? 
  british ( ish ) accent - wrong stress on words . 
  this blog post is only about italy , but it 's a good explanation . 
  edit : spelling, 
  no they are noto asking for that . 
  and i posted a link already , learn to fucking read a post . 
  no they are not asking for that . 
  and i posted a link already , learn to fucking read a post . 
  uhm , italy was n't under german controll at all . 
  actually hitler was pissed by some action that mussolini did on his own during the war . 
  i mean , italy was the `` junior party '' in the relatiinship with germany , but that is a far stretch from `` being controlled '' . 
  i 'm picturing you cheering like a sport fan . 
  `` go go go you can make it ... noooooo !, 
  you dumbass that was so easy ! '', 
  last month . 
  just as a general advice , if you have a mole that is `` elevated '' ( it 's not flat , even more if you can grab it ) and hard ** go to a dermatologist rigth now ** . 
  it does n't have to be both . 
  only hard or only elevated , go to see a dermatologist about it . 
  do not try to remove it by yourself . 
  in the unlikely event that you will succeed , you basically just destroyed evidence of what caused the change and ** still have potentially cancerous cells in you ** . 
  yeah , i 'm fun at parties , but you do n't fuck with an unusual mole . 
  actually italy had an economic boom in the 50 . 
  also , being called again `` the axis '' is creepy as fuck . 
  i would just love to see the reaction of an american conservative discovering that the party expressing italy 's prime minister is a center-left socialist party which was born by the union of the majority chunk of the old italian communist party and the more left-leaning part of the democrazia cristiana ( a party which was center/center-right , it depends on the period ) . 
  the fun thing is that at the moment calling yourself socialist in italy is almost a cardinal sin ... because in the '90 they were at the center of an huge bribery scandal . 
  and also because the communist party was very , very strong . 
  make that at least 1000 bucks . 
  a serious law firm who meddles in copyright is very expensive . 
  because those places are not for travel . 
  they are for having a week of sea-drinking-dancing and possibly fucking . 
  basically people who go there are not going there because they want to see that country , they want to have a 1-week long `` saturday night '' . 
  ghent is relatively small , 4 days may be a bit too much . 
  but i 've never been in ghent , so better wait for some one else . 
  in having litterally a government member passing you what and how to say . 
  seriously guys , stop with the `` everybody is shit '' . 
  even if you are right and everybody is shit , you still want to tell apart the sitnky , impossibile to remove diarrhea shit from the regular turd . 
  roman sources always , or almost always , depict sulla as a bad guy . 
  he was the guy of the `` proscription list '' . 
  he made a long list of his enemies , put it up on display on the forum , and made the senate declare that anyone whose name was on that list was no more a citizen and had no rights . 
  anybody could kill them without repercussion , people were actually asked to kill them offering part of their estate as a reward . 
  plus there were money for giving information about them , and all the possesion left behind from those man were no more legally of their own family . 
  i 'm not sure that sulla actually stepped down , as far as i know we do n't have enough information on his last years . 
  some speculate that he simply died of old age , some speculate that he was forced in retirement by a disease and died pretty quickly , others said that he got crazy , like alzhaimer crazy , and so he just faded away from power while people arround him took advantage of his deteriorating state of mind ... 
  btw , here in italy sulla is regular part of the history curriculum . 
  ( yeah , we spend a lot of time on the romans . 
  shocking , right ? ), 
  `` well , who would have guessed that i ended up living 10000 years ? '', 
  wait , you usually receive a * public * blowjob ? 
  edit : guys , it 's from `` my big fat greek wedding '' . 
  i wrote that , you really ca n't read two lines of text before click on ` downvote ' ? 
  seriously ? 
  dude , and kimono came from the greek for `` winter '' !, 
  because they wear it in winter , right ? 
  did n't you know ? 
  if you do not get the reference , you have tree testicles . 
  princess mononoke, 
  hitler was quite a fan mussolini when he was seizing power . 
  it considered him a model . 
  after that , yes , they were n't on best term on each other . 
  but please be carefull , it 's full of neo-fascist ( as in `` nostalgic of mussolini '' ) who use this fact to tell a fantasy story where mussolini hated hitler but was bullied by him to join the axis . 
  they could not be best pal , but they still were pretty happy of having some common ideas to share . 
  just tell me , how exactly is made an american pizza that one is used as a meal for at least 2 people ? 
  the way pizza is done here , you usually eat one pizza per person . 
  yes , even the ones with a lot of stuff on it . 
  that 's actually impossible . 
  a severe burning on 2/3 of your body would cause so much water evaporation that you would die quickly of dehydratation . 
  oh , i 'm sorry , i was browsing / r/europe and forgot that here we do n't have a flair to show the nationality . 
  i 'm from italy . 
  it seems there is a misconception , i was n't asking for how you make pizza . 
  i was asking what is the difference between an usa pizza and an italian pizza , since it seems that yours is impossible to eat all alone . 
  uhm , so i have to assume that when i see people in a tv show/internet saying thing like `` ugh , i had two slices of pizza yesterday , i 'm so fat ! '', 
  it 's actually an exageration ? 
  because it still seems not that much a difference to me that two or three slices will be enough to fill your stomach ... or maybe i really have to check * how much * thicker the dough is , 
  i 'm not sure about the `` et tu '' , i do n't know if it can be used in this way . 
  edit : the two `` i '' in bibit are read as the one in `` bit '' . 
  edit : i forgot the accusative . 
  edit3 : maybe the best translation is ** `` quintus maximus bibit spritum . 
  '' ** thanks to / u/wintremute for the help !, 
  well , romans ( and greeks ) used quite often the subtext in a sentence , so it is n't completely off . 
  but yes , it * does * sounds off . 
  i really do n't know what they used ... the only thing that i can think of is using a very explicit form with an exortative subjunctive . 
  somethng like `` tu bibas ? '' . 
  but i really have no idea . 
  oh , right . 
  i was just going after the `` sprite '' reference . 
  never heard of a smaller amount on a receipt , it seems you are confusing a receipt with an invoice . 
  that is true , but as an italian i can tell you that this is not the case for italy . 
  edit : oh , i just read the comment about jiro 's . 
  it seems that the waiter is not in the room unless he is serving you , and you have a little bell to call him . 
  i have litterally never heard that by anyone , amywhere , for a scontrino . 
  for a fattura , yes . 
  for a scontrino , never even heard of people talking about that . 
  you can . 
  windows do exactly this , as everyone else .
