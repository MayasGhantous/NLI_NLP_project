  the trevi fountain will be closed in april , yes , and that 's a bummer , but it 's still mostly visible ( they used a special `` glass '' scaffolding and built an inner path for tourists ) . 
  the first part of the road between the coliseum and the forums has a construction site on it ( the new metro c ) but , the coliseum itself will be clear ( and clean ! ), 
  for april , afaik . 
  since 2010 some monuments have been cleaned and now we have a second trunk of the b line , the b1 line , and the first trunk of the brand new c line ( for now it works just on the very outskirt of the city ) . 
  that 's all , for now . 
  you are not the `` expert '' here , you are the salesman . 
  the fact that you are not trying to sell him a car right now does n't mean that is not your job and that you have a clear , direct economic gain by advertising a function in a car you do sell . 
  also , we are on the internet , and we have no way to know what really your job is . 
  wait , in the us `` college '' and `` universitiy '' are two different things ? 
  i ** always ** tought they were the same thing , just that `` college '' stressed the `` community of students and teacher '' part where `` university '' stressed the institution itself . 
  diarrhea and emorroids . 
  at the same time . 
  oh thank you , i was already freaking out at the idea that i spent the last 3 years of my life accidentally telling people that i attend a community college . 
  dude , if you can try to do the dolomiti superski sellaronda in the italian alps . 
  it 's a 4-valley connected system . 
  you pay once and can go around 4 valleys , each one with dozens of tracks , and each one with it 's own beautiful landscape . 
  you do n't have to take a bus or whatever , they are all connect with the regular lifts , chair lift , cable car etc. 
  it 's fantastic , trust me !, 
  thank you , i will try it !, 
  i have this strange feeling that i should thank you since english is not my first language , but since you just yelled at me i feel like i should n't . 
  is n't that `` pneumologist '' ? 
  uhhm , i would n't put anarchism on the left . 
  if we divide left from right as in the european way of socialism in the left and lasseir-faire on the right , they should be absolutely on the right . 
  event in the american way there is still a sense of the left being more favourable to the concept of a central government . 
  i know that anarchism is usually lumped with the left , but i think that 's mostly because of an `` historical accident '' . 
   italy is quite conservative, 
  is n't malta an incredibly religious country , where abortion is still illegal ? 
  i know you are joking , but the barbarians actually had a very little impact on the lifestyle and culture of romans . 
  by the time they went to power they were mostly latinized , and also they were n't enough to displace the local population . 
  that 's why we have romance languages nowadays , and why the influx of the language of the tribes of barbarians is almost non-existant in those languages . 
  the fall of the roman empire was mostly a change of ruling class as far as the general population was concerned , not a destructive invasion from a completely foreigner force . 
  ( i said mostly ), 
  the `` national tradition '' paragraph of that wiki page looks like it needs a good clean-up . 
  i 'm hobestly curious about why do they think that . 
  do they believe that doctors and lawyers are pulling stuff out their asses everyday ? 
  like that you just have to know how to run a blood test or avere a law is in a book ? 
  you usually still use paper with a bidet , actually . 
  i was actually talking about using paper before the bidet . 
  i 'm from a country where the bidet is in every house , and the process usually goes like this : paper -  bidet -  towel . 
  obviously the towel is personal and is used only for bidet stuff . 
  ( you usually have a spare in the rare event a guest have to take a shit while in your home ), 
  redundancy , mostly . 
  let 's say that you need 3 server to run you website . 
  if you have 4 server you can shut off one of them without anyone noticing , you `` just '' need a good work-balancing program to redistribuite the user load . 
  then you can procede to update one server at time , having always 3 server up . 
  yes , this means that some user will see the upgraded website before others , this is way you can not do this for every site . 
  i think you replied to the wrong comment . 
  oh boy , i 'm actually right now trying to explain to a guy on a forum that his `` one night stand '' was too fucking close to sexual harassement . 
  it was n't , but he got very close to it , according to how he wrote down the story . 
  he does n't seems to notice how close he was to actually molesting her . 
  i 'm actually very uncomfortable because this is not something that i 'm used to . 
  i mean , i feel that i should help him to understand what happened there , to avoid future problem , but then i 'm a bit freaked out . 
  you always assume that these thing will not concern you . 
  that everyone you know ( even if just on the internet ) is a mature , responsible person . 
  guess i was wrong ... 
  as in `` hermione granger '' . 
  somehow i manged to read 3 books reading her name ad `` garanger '' instead of `` granger '' . 
  yes , this was before the movies came out , and yes i was a child . 
  this is disturbingly plausibile . 
  doctors and biologist told us that actually . 
  since the term is not still fixed , this actually change a lot from place to place . 
  there are place in the world where gay is used prevalently for man-to-man relationship . 
  ok , this is n't the most memorable travel experience in the sense of `` wow '' , but it surely is in the `` i 'm growing up and doing shit , guys '' . 
  so , i was on a school trip in berlin and one night i ended up changing a few metro line having * no idea * of where exactly i was going , just following two others girls ( my classmates , not wild sex story here unfortunately ) who where going to met a guy that they knew that lived in berlin . 
  no one of us knew where we were going , we were just following the guys instruction to reach one of those bar where you can smoke an hooka/waterpipe . 
  our only information was that the place was very good because apparently a lot of turkish people go there . 
  we managed to reach the bar , and we spent a couple of hour there before literally running away to be on the last metro that we needed to use before it stopped running . 
  i still now have * aboslutely no idea * concerning where i was that night , the neigbourhood looked fine but it was clearly `` working class '' . 
  oh , did i mention that for some stupid reason ( because 17yo , that 's why ) we were on the metro wearing stupid fake badge with written `` tom tom go '' on them ? 
  like , i had `` tom '' , the next girl another `` tom '' , and then the last girl had `` go '' ? 
  and that we chatted to two very nice elderly ladies who where curious about our badges ? 
  ( seriously guys , why even your grandma can speak good english ? ), 
  as i said , this is n't a particularly interesting story ( well , excluding the tom tom part , i guess ) but for a 17yo being dragged around an unknown city with a stupid badge on the chest , chatting with two lovely elderly ladies and smoking a waterpipe for the first time and in an legit turkish place in a completely non-touristic part of the city was quite the adventure . 
  manda_panda , you seems to have a good eye for the composition of the image , but you should pay more attention on the focus . 
  a lot of your picture are a little messed up with the focus , usually there is too much bokeh . 
  you need a clear point to focus the attention of the viewer , regardless of how much bokeh yuo want to use !, 
  ooh , a manual lens , that explains a lot actually . 
  yes , you should spend some time learning how to properly focus with that lens , your picture will improve a lot . 
  to be honest 95 % of the people that i saw doing this werne ' t actually broken . 
  usually they just think that everyone else has a shitload of money . 
  seriously , most of them just think that there is something wrong with them because they should be having several 100 $ bills in their wallet everyday , as they think everyone else have . 
  then sure , there are people who have genuinely problems managing their finances . 
  what is an alternative school ? 
  it 's the first time i heard about it . 
  ( i 'm not from the usa ), 
  and do n't forget about the huge resentment and pts that it would create . 
  `` oh , you are the guy who shot my wife during the purge !, 
  sure , i will be your waiter today , no problem man ! '', 
  `` oh , hey , you raped me last night , but it 's totally cool , we can still be co-workers . 
  because you know , it was legal back then , so i 'm fine . '', 
  uh , why , the purge di n't apply to border patrol ? 
  they will just kill you straight on . 
  you will probably be safer smuggling that truck on every other day . 
  uhm , no . 
  not always . 
  the fact that absence of evidence ** is not ** evidence of absence is a pretty important point in medicine . 
  if i do n't find any evidence of something i ca n't tell you what happened to your body . 
  i can tell you that i ruled out x and x , given a certain amount of error caused by this and that . 
  i think that you should rephrase that in this way :, 
  * if you are able to analyze with a 100 % sensitivity and sensibility the enviroment then absence * ** is ** * evidence of absence .
