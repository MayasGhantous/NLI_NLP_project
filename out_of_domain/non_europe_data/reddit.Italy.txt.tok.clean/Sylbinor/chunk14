  if you ca n't , it is n't . 
  i 've read somewhere that maybe all this came from what is an `` healty and attractive '' smile in europe vs what is in the usa . 
  basically they consider a perfectly lined and bright white smile as the `` average '' attractive smile , while we europeans tend to be ok with slightly crooked ( i said ** slightly ** ) or not pearly white teeth . 
  thus people does n't feel any need to do as much work on their teeth as the americans do , because nobody will even notice that . 
  then why they picked you britons for this stereotype ... no idea , maybe they just pay more attention to you . 
  that stuff is clearly bullshit , but you actually can watch ( some ) live bacteria move using a microscope . 
  they look like little black dots moving around in short , quick , burst . 
  well , at least the one strain i watched . 
  yes , it 's very creepy watching live bacteria moving around . 
  unfortunately i know a guy ( not really a friend of mine , just a guy i met at the bar now and then ) who is in the terminal stage of osteosarcoma . 
  i do n't want to sound morbid here , but someone knows what will happen from now on with the pain and all ? 
  that 's a completely different thing , most of the research for turning back mature cell was actually done before any fatwa against embryonal stem cells . 
  they do that because they failed to prove themselves safe or effective . 
  i do n't know how this work in the usa , but many countries here in europe do have laws for this kind of situation . 
  here in italy is called , roughly traslated , `` compassionate cure law '' . 
  it basically state that you can override most of the safety and effectiveness check on a case by case choice if you are in a no-hope situation . 
  you still have to prove that your experimental drug is not a scam or can kill the patient . 
  as i said , i think that something similar do exist in the usa . 
  the problem is that they can fail killing you and other people . 
  and we had and still have a lot of people who are running from the law because they sell a dangerous drug knowing it 's dangerous . 
  that drug failed , but patients did n't know this . 
  how could you , as a layman , know what exactly is in that drug ? 
  how do you know if it is really a risk or a scam with 0 % of success ? 
  you ca n't . 
  you want to take the risk knowing * for what * you are risking your life . 
  because you hope for an improvement . 
  you will not take the risk for a 0 % chanche of improvement because the drug is quackery . 
  this is a situation where the user have absolutely no way of doing an informed choice on it 's own . 
  it 's not like you can google `` xxx drug '' and review it 's efficacy and pros/cons , because you do n't know how it works and all the stuff that you have to check to make it works . 
  i 'm pretty sure that you can try an experimental drug on a case by case choice , actually . 
  provided that they already know that is no quackery or it is going to kill you . 
  laws that allows this are present in europe , i would be very surprised if this was n't the case in the usa . 
  maybe i worded that wrongly , i did n't meant `` no-hope '' as in `` terminal '' . 
  i mean it as in `` no improvement is to be expected by any treatment '' . 
  it does n't have to be a life threating situation to apply for a compassionate cure . 
  again , this is how it works here . 
  the placenta is an organ of the baby , not the mother . 
  so it 's not self cannibalism . 
  castelrotto is one of those municipality that functions as a `` tent '' for a lot of smaller settlement who are n't big enough to form an autonomous minicipality . 
  the area that is called `` castelrotto '' thus is huge , probably he was n't near the real castelrotto . 
  or maybe he was . 
  lol , according to google this is the hotel op was in , the view behind the hotel seems to be even better . 
  i ca n't help you with what you are looking for , but testaccio is n't exactly an area famous for `` fancy '' lifestyle . 
  now do n't get me wrong , it 's absolutely possibile that there is a fantastic `` fancy '' club over there , the area has a lot of nightlife , i 'm just saying that when people here say `` fancy '' nobody thinks about testaccio , usually . 
  jokes on you , i was playing elder 's tale . 
  now if you excuse me i have a certain guild building to buy ... 
  you really ca n't pat the head or talk to small children ? 
  in basically all latin europe this is common behaviour . 
  and apparently also in scandinavian europe . 
  now we need to hear someone from central europe and the uk , i guess ... 
  excpet for the manual lever in metro cars , those point are 100 % true for italy as well . 
  man , we really are cousin . 
  edit : oh , wait , i missed the `` nobody honks '' . 
  that is n't like italy , at all . 
  about trains ( italian trains , at least ) , you * absolutely * want to book in advance . 
  this is how you can get the cheap tickets . 
  right now for 20th of november the lowest price for an high-speed train from milan to rome ( you really ** do not want ** to use a `` regular '' train here ) is 49 euro for trenitalia and 38 for italo , per person . 
  i was looking for the lowest ticket , so i did n't care about departure times , class of the seats or exactly which station are we talking about ( both cities have 2 different station for high speed trains ) , so maybe your tickets will be higher , but not much . 
  unless you go for the top class or extras , of course . 
  if you will do the ticket when you are already in milan , you can forget those prices . 
  they will be higher , even a lot higher if you are unlucky . 
  it may even happen that you have to reschedule your departure because the train you wanted it 's already full . 
  so ... book in advance . 
  i have never went from malpensa to milan myself , but looking on the web it seems that it should be around a 1 hour trip . 
  so i guess that you have plenty of time . 
  if you land at 7:45 even if they are very slow to give you back your luggages at max 9:30 you should be outside the airport . 
  worst case scenario here . 
  that means that best case scenario where everything runs smoothly you are in milan at 9:30 . 
  disaster scenario , you will be there at 11 . 
  if you book a train for around 3 or 4 in the afternoon , i think you will have plenty of time to grab a bite to eat and to explore a little , but this really depend on where exactly you will arrive in milan city from the airport . 
  you could have to use the metro to go exploring something ... 
  i do n't live in milan , so i ca n't be very helpful in what to see there on such a short time-window . 
  that actually rise a good point . 
  this story seems to be more about sexual harassment , with your young age being an aggravating situation . 
  the age for sexual consent is not 18 in every country . 
  here in italy the age is 14 , if the older partner is not in a position of power in respect to the younger partner ( a teacher , a policeman , someone taking care of you ... and yes , a doctor visiting you ) . 
  this is realy a good example on why those laws do exist , as in they are there to prevent or punish something done against the consent , and not necessarily because of sexual stuff . 
  i mean , the point here is that we protect the will of a person , regardless if he is an horny teenager ( sorry :p ) or someone who think of sex as something nasty and develop a strong guilt about it . 
  both of you must be protected . 
  ( p.s. 
  for everyone wondering why berlusconi was on trial for having sex with a 17yo if the age of consent is 14 : he was n't . 
  he was on trial for allegedly * paying * her to have sex with him . 
  prostitution with a minor is illegal . ), 
  that 's why there is either something missing in the story ( like , he was already in position for another examination ) or this is fake . 
  you do n't just do a prostate examination in any position , and you do not do it without asking consent . 
  because asking consent for everything is something they drill in your head , and because it 's way more difficult if the patient start clenching it 's muscles in surprise . 
  those muscles are strong . 
  this is true in every country . 
  it 's pretty basic stuff in law , no contract can be considered valid if one of the part it 's knowingly exploiting the other . 
  this , with some caveats , extends also to the the fine print : no chanche in hell that you can pull something like `` well , according to this dictionary from the xvi century , this word also means that you owe me 10000 dollars '' . 
  stuff like that works only in movies , or in veeeery specific situations . 
  actually there are quite a lot of cases when rape is very easy to detect . 
  a vagina , or anus , forced to sexual intercourse will show pretty clear signs of trauma . 
  and no , those sign ca n't happen if you are just rough with your partner . 
  really , it will not happen , your partner will be telling you to stop before it can happen . 
  then again , there are cases when this is n't so clear , but usually it is . 
  mmm , you are a bit confused . 
  the chatolic church do n't consider the bible as a book to be taken literally . 
  i ca n't link to you any actual quote right now , but i remember that there have been catholic thinkers and bishops writing about how you ca n't read the bible as a storically accurate chronicle since the iii - iv century ad . 
  the idea that the garden of eden was an actual place where two guy named adam and eve actually lived exactly how the bible says is n't in the catholic doctrine , to make a bit of a semplification .
