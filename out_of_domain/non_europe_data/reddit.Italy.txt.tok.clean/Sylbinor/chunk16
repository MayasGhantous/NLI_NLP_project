  you could still be showing enough information to make the person identificable , but you are making this much harder . 
  mm no , that 's more about the general `` i 'll do it myself '' attitude . 
  americans has a lot more of this stuff . 
  it 's probably just him trying too hard to be a smartass . 
  or he is one of those who believe in some pseudo-science blabbery and go around telling people how `` they are killing us with chemicals '' . 
  i do n't get the problem , it 's obviously an oversimplification for the sake of the narration , but roman culture was strongly rooted in militaristic and macho behaviour . 
  the rape part was true of about every ancient culture , more or less . 
  and even not so ancient culture . 
  soldiers considered pillaging and rape as part of their wages . 
  sure , it was n't a `` free for all '' , but sometime roman generals just said `` this time * is * free for all '' to let their soldiers be satisfied and loyal to him . 
  pillaging and rape as a common part of war was actually pretty normal until , what 1600 ? 
  someting about that time give or take 100 years . 
  it 's just that their commanders allowed that by closing an eye , instead of specifically allowing that . 
  well , i mean , you should still have an attraction for the male body in order to wanting to do sexy stuff with a guy . 
  the homosexual ( maybe it 's better to say bisexual ) part was present . 
  i mean , i can watch a picture of a male model shirtless and saying `` yep , i absolutelly can see why people want to fuck this '' , and then going to the gym and casually watching some handsome man naked taking a shower and not feeling the slightes attraction to his body . 
  yes , but i was talking about `` istituzionalized '' rape and pillage . 
  it was something that people expected as something that * will * happen . 
  the point is that an handicapped person can not be a b class citizen . 
  why should a disabled person not be able to go in a store , while you can ? 
  this can be an huge problem . 
  immagine that * all * the grocery store in your town are not accesible by a wheelchair . 
  what are you gon na do ? 
  ask a friend to do grocery for you every single time ? 
  this something that can easily happen in a small town . 
  i do n't see how a store would go bankrupt making his store accesible by disabled people , honestly . 
  you can eat in that place , you just can not eat that specific item on the menu . 
  a disabled person could not enter the building . 
  why ? 
  i think that you have to pay attention to his nickname ... 
  while i do agree that a double system is probably the best way to go ( it take pressure out of the public ones , making things easier for everyone , and it creates competition , which lower the prices and force improvement ) , i * really * want to specify that it does n't exist any difference in quality of care between a public and a private one by default . 
  we as ( future ) doctor are called to use the best treatment availlable . 
  nobody build an hospital and say `` eh , make it cheap this time '' . 
  if difference in quality of care are present among different hospitals , that is a matter of administration , ** not ** something planned by the beggining . 
  hey , i 'm sorry if it seems that i 'm always bothering you , it 's just that as a future doctor i have quite an interest in this . 
  i do n't know the exact regulation in the uk , but healthcare is always managed on a `` less time is better '' basis nowaday . 
  this was n't the case a couple of decade ago , but nowaday we use benchmarks for decide how much time a patient needs to stay in the hospital . 
  we know that , say , a miocardial infarction will need x days to be treated , and we will try to put you out of the hospital in that time . 
  now , let me be clear here : if a patients is still sick after the x days * he/she will still be treated as usual * . 
  the difference is that in that case the administration will know thay something is not working as it should , and will have to fix it . 
  this is how things works nowaday , no difference in private or public . 
  so no , you should not have been in the hospital for 6 month , in any case . 
  you need a direct line of sight for a laser to work . 
  you do n't have that for a comet . 
  wait , they are harmless except when they are n't . 
  they can turn into a melanoma , which is a type of cancer that is highly treatable in it 's first stages , but quite lethal if it 's in a more advanced stage . 
  check your moles every now and then , and report to your medic every change in form , coulour , simmetry and elevation that you notice . 
  also , if they itch or bleed . 
  you should also do a check with a dermatologist once a year , if possible . 
  please , look on the web for more information . 
  catching a melanoma in his first stages is litterally a matter of life and death . 
  actually the romance influences in english came when england was invaded . 
  it stem from latin and proto-french conquests . 
  you are literraly the most normal person here . 
  you can `` tailor '' antibiotics ti target just a kind of microbes . 
  chemo drug are less targeted to cancer cell specifically . 
  is n't the eurotunnel train very expansive ? 
  yeah , i know , it ' spelled warsaw . 
  my bad . 
  if the boy had some mental problem , even undiagnosed , it is not too strange . 
  what * is * strange and suspicious is that they were able to buy a katana with an actual cutting edge . 
  this obviously depends on the laws of your state/country , but usually swords that can actually cut things are not freely sold . 
  the tipical katana that people buy is just for show . 
  ( a sword is still an heavy and long metal thing . 
  ** please , do not ** use it against people or living things just because it probably ca n't really cut . ), 
  they may also `` break '' the cavernous bodies of the penis . 
  you ( we ) have this two spongy structure in the shaft of the penis that will engorge when blood is pumped there ( and mostly kept there ) when you are getting sexually excited . 
  this is what cause the erection . 
  a forcefull compression on a wrong angle can cause one or both of the cabernous bodies to `` snap '' . 
  data please . 
  i need a source . 
  that does n't seem a credibile source , sorry . 
  even if it was it actually point out that canada is an outlier on the topic of mri . 
  in my experience is not much a matter of speed , as one of aggressivity . 
  i ca n't tell you why , honestly . 
  while teenegers get wasted everywhere , the `` get wasted at every occasion '' is more an us thing . 
  when you can drink alcohol almost whenever you want , you do n't feel that much urge to drink . 
  honestly , has this actually happened to someone ? 
  has anyone ever met a sane person saying that they are a dragon or whatever ? 
  i ca n't even find non-ironic posts on the internet about this . 
  i have already wrote this here . 
  has this actually happened to someone ? 
  i ca n't honestly find any evidence of this happening in an enviroment where you can be sure that the person is n't trolling or honestly crazy . 
  uber is cheaper ? 
  here in europe uber is marketing itself as a classier , and so more expansive , taxi company basically . 
  they do have also a `` random guy '' cheaper service , but that is still in experimental and very limited phase . 
  wow , i entered this thread thinkinh `` prague '' , and this is the first post . 
  spot on . 
  i agree , it really surpassed my expectations . 
  or you can end up with the italian king in 1922 , who when the fascist marched on rome called off the already deployed army and gave the power to mussolini . 
  every time this pop up i have no idea how it started on the first starterd in the first place . 
  obviously , but the fact that people were n't assholes in the past does n't means that they can not be assholes in the future . 
  no mistake here . 
  1 ) the guy was taliking about norway 's king during wii . 
  the time frame here was between wwi and wwii . 
  i replied to that . 
  2 ) i never said that the mussolini had a bunch of people and seized power because he looked scary . 
  i said that he had the active support of the king . 
  having the king on your side is an * huge * boost to your image . 
  he refused to give the order to the army to stop mussolini and his thugs when they were going to rome .
