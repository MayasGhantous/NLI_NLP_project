  hmm , i 'm italian and 16 c on jenuary-february seems too much to me ... 
  it probably was a particularly warm winter , you were lucky !, 
  germanic tribes did n't had a really big impact on the gene pool of the population . 
  yes but `` typical use '' is skewed . 
  i 'm a medical student with an interest in sex-ed stuff , and you have no idea how many people , especially teenegers , have no idea of how correctly put on or store a condom . 
  lots and lots of condoms stored for months in a wallet or in a car and lots of people who had no idea that you have to squeeze the tip of the condom to push out all the air inside . 
  it 's fucking expensive , i tell you . 
  if i did n't mess up the conversion from eur/lit to usd/gallon , it cost on average about 5.5 - 6 $ / gallon right now . 
  ** spoiler **, 
  in a tl ; dr version :, 
  snape was acting as an undercover agent for dumbledore at the time . 
  having him in the inner circle of voldemort was considered to be extremely important . 
  dumbledore got cursed with a deadly and incurable curse , think about terminal cancer , and was bounded to die anyway , just later . 
  they got in a situation where voldemort explicitly requested to snape to kill dumbledore , right there right now , probably to prove his loyalty , and dumbledore thought that having snape as an undercover was more important than his own life . 
  snape reluctantly did so . 
  this is a tl ; dr version , there are more stuff about it , like the `` unbreakable vow '' and not wanting to have draco malfoy to became an assassin ... 
  i 'm totally pulling this out of my ass , but could it be that this is a result of the `` highlights '' effect ? 
  you know when we look at someone fb page and it seems that they are living the most amazing life , 'cause we only see the best thing that they do ? 
  maybe those guy just see someone being flirty and then after 2 months he see them kissing on a bench or something like that . 
  they never get to see what happened in that time , in his mind they met , flirted a bit , and then they were kissing . 
  again , i 'm pulling this out of my ass , just for the sake of discussion . 
  seriously , i literally do n't know a girl who has facebook and has n't received at least one `` strange '' message . 
  every single one of them . 
  does n't matter if they are good looking or plain ugly . 
  my girlfriend received one , and she has a picture of us kissing as her cover image on her profile . 
  but apparently this guy did n't care . 
  i have two different friends who told me that it happened to them to start chatting with an apparently nice guy , then out of the fucking blue receive a message with some sort of sexual proposition . 
  the logic of this strategy is really beyond me . 
  ok , i have to ask it . 
  why the cinque terre seems to be so impressive for foreigners ? 
  ( at least here on reddit ), 
  do n't get me wrong , everyone think that they are gorgeous , they are huge tourists attractions for italians as well . 
  it 's just that they seems to be way more popular here on reddit . 
  hungary is considered very unsafe in the usa ? 
  i mean , like the whole ex-communist bloc is not considered to be the top notch of safety , but i can think of a lot of eastern european countries that are considered far more unsafe . 
  bosnia , as you said , is one of them . 
  a little tip regarding the water for rome . 
  the city is full of fountain like this one http://www.romainrima.it/online/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/nasone.jpg which provide a continous stream of fresh and clean water . 
  they are by far the cheapest way to drink water in rome , just buy a bottle and then fill it every time you need . 
  oh , if you do n't have a bottle with you just block the water with your hand , thus the water will exit trhough another hole and it will be upwards , like an arch , and it will be way easier to drink it . 
  fun fact : those fountain are called `` nasoni '' by the locals , which litterally means `` big noses '', 
  oh i was genuinely curious about it . 
  i 've never been to hungary , and i know that it is n't the safest place in europe , but i had never heard of it as a place particularly unsafe . 
  i think that `` the early bird gets the worm '' means something along the lines of `` do not slack off '' , while `` good things come to those who wait '' means `` do not be impatient '' . 
  this . 
  i kinda hate when people start talking about their job as something absolutely soul crushing . 
  ** do n't get me wrong here ** , i know that it happens to being stuck with a shitty job because you need the money . 
  i 'm not talking about that , at all . 
  i 'm talking about people who seems to have * willingly * chose a job that apparently they had 0 interest in . 
  i met a girl while on vacation , we were staying at the same hotel and we spent some good time there , as friends . 
  we exchanged our msn account ( yes , this was years ago . 
  2007 , i think ) and started chatting . 
  after a couple of week she contacted me to say that she was going to be in my city for a couple of days . 
  aaaand i said just `` ehi , cool , have fun ! '' . 
  the idea that she was probably asking to met was beyond the logic capacity of my brain at the time , apparently . 
  edit : holy shit guys , just 10 second after i sent this post a girl that i like litterally misinterpreted a text i sent to her as an invitation to go out on a date and said ok . 
  i. . . do n't know what happened , but i 'm happy that it happened . 
  that 's karma paying back at it 's finest level here !, 
  wait , cave johnson was jk simmons ? 
  well , it makes a lot of sense now ... 
  i think he was talking about something along the lines of people telling stories of relatively petty argument and then plotting something nasty `` to show them '' . 
  like when there is a story of a child being an ass and an adult decides that the only way to make the child behave is to be a bigger ass to the child . 
  dude , every generation of 15yo try to be edgy on the web . 
  since the web was born the 15yo who talk about how he totally got how to fix half the problem of the world has been present in online communities . 
  really , the worst and best part of reddit is that half the shitty stuff that you read are actually written by 15yo who will eventually grow out of those idea . 
  til to never , ever , have a problem in glasgow . 
  hmm , i think that there is a couple of problem with associating this image with depression . 
  i suffer of a `` mild '' form of depression , i do n't know the specific term for it , but let 's say that i have never reached the `` i do n't wan to go out of bed '' stage . 
  ( yes , i have already seek for professiona help ), 
  while this can be very personal , the problem that i see with this image is that it suggest that everyone feels like shit , and just fake it like you do . 
  this is not what usually happens , you think that something is wrong with * you * , and see the fact that others seems happy as `` evidence '' that something is wrong with you . 
  thinking that `` the world sucks '' would be actually relieving , because it means that it 's not something that is up to you . 
  unless this is a very local saying ( it still should be `` dolce '' , not `` dolche '' ) , the phrase is * `` il dolce far nulla '' * . 
  roughly translated as `` the sweet doing nothing '' or , with some liberties , `` the sweetness of doing nothing '' . 
  greece screwed itself by faking the reports in their economy , you should really check your sources , you know ? 
  why the hell did they ever coded that . 
  oh god , this is really relevant to me right now . 
  i have a friend , who i know since we were 6 yo , who do this a lot . 
  i 'm 100 % serious when i say that in the last 2 years i can not remember a single time when i was with him and at some point he * did not * start talking about all the bad things that happened to him . 
  now , he actually has some serious issues going on , i 'm very , very aware of this . 
  but it is getting annoying . 
  i know that his problems are real , and at least one of them is a serious one , but sometime i want to just go out and drink a beer because i 'm happy . 
  sometime * i * do have a problem . 
  but no , we will have a fun time and then he will talk to me of his problems . 
  or we will talk about my problems and then he will talk about his problems . 
  i repeat , i know that his problems are not jokes , i have * no intention * of not being his friend anymore . 
  but it gets annoying to be unable to just have a fun time with him , or to just receive support when * i * feel like shit . 
  it is tiresome . 
  is n't shakespeare late middle english ? 
  english is one of the easiest language to learn . 
  your grammar is very simple compared to that of other languages , such as the romances language for example . 
  english has 12 tenses . 
  italian has 21 tenses . 
  ( and i 'm not counting the fact that english modifies the verb only for the third person singular , and use ausiliary verbs to form most of it tenses ), 
  what is a bitch is the pronunciation . 
  that is hard to learn , but the grammar is nothing particularly bad . 
  you know what is funny ? 
  because of this it happens a lot that people whose native language is a romance one but are n't good at english will tend to use the words with latin root , thus looking like they are trying to be posh-like , where they are actually using the simplest word that they know . 
  while this is true most of the time , there is a non-irrilevant * percentage of people who are fat because they have some health conditions and do not know it yet . 
  i was fat until i discovered that i had hypotiroidism .
