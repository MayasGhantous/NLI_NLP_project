  what a drug usually do ? 
  it starts a change in your body that will eventually cause you to feel better , for writing it as an eli5 . 
  now , sometime this `` change '' can happen on its own . 
  i mean that the body can actually do it `` by choiche '' , but wo n't do it unless we `` convince '' it to do it . 
  by giving a placebo , a `` something '' that has no real way to change anything in your body , we try to convince your body to do what we want . 
  if the people who felt better after taking the placebo are more or less the same number of the people who felt better after taking the drug , we can say that the drug did n't work , and that we just tricked the body to do what we wanted . 
  why we can not trick the body everytime ? 
  two reasons :, 
  1 ) we can not rely our healtcare on a psycological effect . 
  someone say to you that that pill is actually a placebo and puff , goodbye placebo effect . 
  also , doctors , chemistry , biologist and evereyone even vaguely related to healtcare would be fucked . 
  basically wikipedia would be a weapon of mass destruction . 
  2 ) your body have to have a way to do what we want . 
  if it needs x and y to kill those viruses and our body does not produce x and y , no placebo effect . 
  ( again , this is an eli5 ! ), 
  so , the placebo effect it 's actually both : our body can heal itself * in particular and limited conditions * and is a way to ensure that the drugs are working . 
  the placebo effect is still not fully understood , but it 's very interesting that it has been found even in toddlers and animals . 
  well , while the placebo effect is not really fully understood , there will never be a future where we could just trigger our body to heal itself . 
  a living organism works using chemistry , and chemistry works a lot like a domino . 
  you have x , then you put y nearby x and they reacts forming z. 
  now z is a new compound that can react with a , and thus forming b. 
  then b can react with ... 
  and this chain can go on ** a lot ** . 
  this is what is called a metabolic pathway , and it 's how our body works at the `` smallest '' level . 
  the two things that you need for a change in the body are :, 
  * 1 ) a trigger, 
  * 2 ) the chemical elements you need, 
  for reasons that we do not fully understand , * sometime * we can have a trigger even without an actuall drug . 
  this is the placebo effect . 
  but we need * both * point 1 and 2 in order to have a change in the body , we ca n't skip one of them . 
  also , the fact that we need an external stimuli to act as a trigger is a very , very good thing . 
  having controll of the `` fine tuning '' of our own body 's chemistry would be a nightmare , not really something that you would like ... 
  this happened to the the whole europe . 
  i do n't think there is a country in europe that still is `` patriotic '' in the way the usa are . 
  it 's simply not part of our culture anymore . 
  we can feel happy to be born in a country , but not proud . 
  even the whole fixation with soldiers that comes from the us feels * very * strange to us ... 
  i 'm honestly curios about what the average austrians thinks about dollfuss . 
  i mean , not if he was good or bad , he obviously was bad , i mean reagarding his tie with mussolini . 
  i know little about him , but what i read paints him as a mussolini 's imitator who tried too hard and was under heavy influence of the fascists and later of the nazis . 
  oh god , so that 's way i keep reading about the `` energizer bunny '' ? 
  well , it makes sense * now * . 
  oh c'mon , unless he really , really needed a thermos , this is just a joke . 
  obviously you need to have a similar sense of humour , but that 's kinda the point of being in a relationship . 
  really ? 
  it has to be a nickname , it litterally means something along the lines `` the biggest big '' . 
  ok , this is ridicolous . 
  i have no idea how many mathematics they have on their payroll , but talking about `` whole area of mathematics '' unknown to the world is just plain impossible . 
  this is just not how things work . 
  some years ago at the student 's association i 'm part of we had to deny a request for being a member from a woman for a reason similar to this one . 
  we usually do n't do any check , it 's just a `` oh , you can prove you are a student at a college ? 
  ok , cool '' , but this woman seemed really off , so we took some time to do some background checks on her ... 
  it turned out that she was under trial for allegedly having done something similar to this , but luckily this time nobody died or was seriously injured . 
  as far as i know she was the first and only person who was not admitted in our association . 
  it can also be a side-effect of something else and having no real purpose . 
  since hair loss happens after a male is fertile and usually do not lower your chanches to mate too much there is little selective pressure on the mutation . 
  `` come down here again , i 'm at the front . '', 
  well , it almost sounds fitting ... 
  i would really , really like to ask one of those guys if they are strongly against the divorce and premarital sex . 
  because you know , otherwise there is a big contradiction here ... 
  but ... 
  they are in the city centre , not northern rome ... 
  the area where the spanish step are is * the * centre , for us locals ... 
  this actually happens in several latin ( as in `` rome '' , not as in `` south america '' ) countries . 
  a possible explanation for this is that culturally the starting time is viewed as a '' from now on we will be there '' , unless explicitly stated otherwise . 
  while in germanic culture is viewed as the endline to be there . 
  oh , i ca n't speak for south america , i 'm european , do you guys really set a `` leaving time '' we you invite someone ? 
  like `` party at my house from 9 to 11 '' ? 
  because that would be strange as hell here . 
  also a bit rude . 
  nazism was n't a military dictatorship . 
  hitler and his men were n't members of the army , and they did not presented themselves as such to the public . 
  i 'm not bisexual myself , but i think that there is a problem with many of those characters ... 
  they portray bisexuality as a 50-50 attraction , while that is just one way to be bisexual ... a lot of bisexual people have a , uhm , `` preference '' for a sex or the other ... 
  but can totally and happily go to the other sex if they fall in love ( or if the guy/girl is really hot , i guess ) . 
  i guess that for tivoli you mean `` villa d'este '' and `` villa adriana '' ( hadrian 's villa ) , then yes , it is worth it . 
  5 days in munich seems too much to me , honestly . 
  milan is ok for 4 days if you plan to use 1 or 2 whole days at the expo , otherwise i would drop at least 1 day there . 
  you have a very packed itinerary here , and milan seems to me the most `` sacrificable '' of your list . 
  i think you should re-think paris . 
  5-6 days is ok for the city + versailles , but if you add mont saint-michel and those castles you are going to a ) have a very tiring day . 
  b ) be left with about 3 days to visit the city itself , wich means that you will have to be on a very tight schedule or drop some major attraction . 
  have you accounted for travel time ? 
  and rest time ? 
  if you spend more than half a day to go from a to b you can basically count that day as lost ( well , almost ) . 
  do not forget that you * will * get tired . 
  you ca n't plan a schedule when you are costantly doing stuff , because trust me you wo n't . 
  you will find yourself `` wasting '' time on a park bench or in a hotel room because you are too tired sooner or later if you do n't plan some resting time . 
  you should explain to us what you are looking for . 
  i ca n't speak for the uk , but in italy the `` bar culture '' is different from the us , so i think that we really need to know a bit more about you and your friends . 
  uhm , no we absolutely celebrate gift giving on christmas . 
  the january 6th is another kind of holiday . 
   it 's called `` epifany '' , and it 's about a witch who gift candies to good kids and coal to bad kids . 
  seriously , i 'm not kidding , the `` witch '' is called [ `` la befana '' ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=la+befana&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=kqzdvb_ommtvuqpugjgm&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969 ) . 
  ( obviously this has been both `` absorbed '' and battled by the catholic church in the past . 
  absorbed because there is a lot of , uhm , `` retcon '' that try to fit `` la befana '' with some biblical story , and battled because the church , at least off the records , supported the idea that it was baby jesus the one who gifted toys to the kids . ), 
  it seems that the confusion came from the fact that in some part of italy gift giving was * actualy * celebrated on january 6th , but that is not the case anymore since 30-40 years ago . 
  tim , vodafone and wind are the `` go-to '' carriers for access . 
  then there is tre , which is a bit behind those 3 for access to the network , but if you stay in the cities you will be fine . 
  there are also a lot of `` virtual carriers '' which do not posses their own network but rely on the network of tim , vodafone , wind and tre ( actually tre sometime uses tim 's network ... complicated stuff ) , but unless you reealy have to squeeze every penny from your budget it 's not worth it for a tourist .
