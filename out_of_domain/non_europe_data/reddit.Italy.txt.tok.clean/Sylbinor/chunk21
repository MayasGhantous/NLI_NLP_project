  if it impaired the ability of the kid to interact with the external world , no , it 's called a mental problem . 
  gender dysphoria is in the dsm beacause it can cause distress in the patient , not because is considered a disease . 
  health is considered as the combination of physical and mental well being , so if something cause you severe distress it has to be addressed by professionals , thus it will be included in the dsm . 
  yup , up until about the late 70s / 80s the second language was french . 
  english was common , but if you had a professional interest in it ... not as the default second language . 
  this is probably why french is still the most common third language here . 
  ( at least in italy the school curriculum mandates that you do at least 3 years of a third language , the 2nd being english ), 
  using an eyeliner . 
  i have blue eyes and black hairs , when i use an eyeliner for halloween or stuff like that i look very good ... 
  i was expecting australia for that . 
  so , gantz ? 
  actually open space its very harmful to machines . 
  even if you have proper shield you do not have resources to repair the damaged parts ... 
  staying on earth is simpler . 
  well , first of all doctors still do home visits . 
  i can talk about italy , here a gp works on a two `` shifts '' system , one in the morning and one in the noon , and one of them is in office and the other is for home visits . 
  i mean , their schedule is like `` monday 8-12 office visits - 13 -18 home visits '' the next day the switch it and it 's like `` 8-12 home visits - 13-18 office visits '' . 
  it 's just doing office visits is more pratical , you can see more patient and you are less stressed ( and you do not want a stressed doctor ) . 
  i think you are thinking of `` penne '' . 
  fun fact : foreigners asking for `` pene '' ( penis ) instead of `` penne '' is very common . 
  and fun . 
  penne has a double n. italian has double consonant , which are pronunced kinda like a very stressed consonant ... 
  i mean , in `` pene '' the n is pronounced as in english , while in `` penne '' its more like you are `` saying '' the n for a bit longer . 
  its an harsher sound . 
  i would really like to post some video to you , but the only one i found on youtube has a guy who is ** still ** pronouncing it as `` pene '' instead of `` penne '' ... 
  what is the meaning of euophori on the internet now ? 
  serious question . 
  moderation in the discussion ... 
  i have seen people believe things that where so obviously troll or sarcasm that i almost got actually angry at them . 
  last thing i saw was a guy on fb ranting about a tumblr picture of two dogs cuddling , and a comment who said something like `` if those dog are not two females , it 's harassment '' . 
  how the fuck can you think that that was not either sarcarsm or a very bad troll ? 
  how ? 
  or when there are picture of outrageous comments made by someone whose username is something like `` feminazitriggered '' and people take it for real . 
  you ca n't be this naive , do you also believe that `` cumslurper95 '' is the nickname of an actual 20 yo girls that want your dick ? 
  i do n't thibk so . 
  you want to be mad at someone . 
  wait , really ? 
  that 's hilarious . 
  but are n't the seats numbered ? 
  why should you be there early for goods seats ? 
  also , 18 $ for a ticket ? 
  here is 8 or sometimes 7 euros , so 9 or 8 $ for a no-reduction 2d ticket . 
  wow , theaters with no reserved seats are rare here , almost everybody started to use assigned seats since about 10 years ago . 
  i always assumed that this was the case everywhere in the wolrd , strange . 
  well , ok , but you stil should use rational thinking . 
  someone with a ridicolous username who write outrageous things should * at least * makes you have a doubt . 
  it 's not just that is dumb , is that is dumb and fit perfectly in a precise stereotype . 
  well , the problem here is that the `` nah girl condoms are too tight i do n't use them '' is a common excuse for assholes that refuse to use a condom for no valid reason . 
  you have to wait at least 3 months . 
  there are no other way . 
  the disease is aids , hiv is the virus . 
  you can have the symptoms of aids after 3 months like after * years * . 
  but if you have hiv virus in you , you will be still infective . 
  i 'm gon na say it , and i 'm ready to the consequences . 
  * the big lebowski *, 
  it 's absolutely a good movie , a ** very good ** one ... 
  but that 's it . 
  i ca n't see why people seems to like it that much . 
  * `` if you keep being like this people will not like you !, 
  they will abandon you !, 
  not a literal quote since this was many years ago , but you can get what i mean . 
  well , if there is a thing that i always had no problem , it was , and is , making friends . 
  like , real friends who helps you and care for you . 
  i was a teenager , and that was the moment i fully realized that there was something wrong with my parents . 
  that i should n't really care too much of what they say about my life because it 's useless . 
  they have unaddressed anger management problems , clearly . 
  they are not giving advice , they are venting their anger by going for an overkill of everything that displeased them that moment . 
  it was a turning point because it was something where i had 100 % proof that they were just ranting nonsenses . 
  i had several good friends , i have now several good friends . 
  i made friends with a lot of people in these years , some of them were `` true '' friends , others were `` just '' people to have fun with now and then . 
  as it is normal . 
  the knowledge that people tend to like me was a sort of shield against the numerous , numerous , rant of my parents . 
  i 'm 25 and recently i met my ex . 
  yes , with `` met '' i mean `` had sex '' . 
  my mother saw her going out of the house and went apeshit about it . 
  for no fucking reason , it 's not like we broke out for some abusive stuff . 
  but for unkown reasons she was mad about it . 
  and somehow my mother can not understand why i refuse to talk with her about my life . 
  she really ca n't wrap her mind around it . 
  if you use an high-speed train , and you really should use it , the travel is about 3:45 hours . 
  on an high-speed travel you must reserve a seat , it 's not optional . 
  going first class has it 's perks , but is nothing game-changing , really . 
  ( unless you have the money to go for the `` executive '' class , that is another story ) . 
  you can use trenitalia.it ( or . com ) or italotreno.it they are two different train companies . 
  trenitalia runs also `` regular '' cheaper but slower trains ( that is a 5 hours travel ) while italo runs only high-speed trains . 
  is strange that you guys in na do not use high-speed trains ... you are usually the ones with the bleeding edge technology . 
  edit : apparently you have some high speed railroads , but they are still limited to 150mph max . 
  gas * will * factor a lot in the final cost . 
  also , the stress of having to drive in a completely unknown city , let alone country , is something that should not be ignored . 
  you will have an hard time going in the city centre with a car ( actually in venice you cant go in the city at all ... but i imagine you have already figured that out ) , and probably you will have to spend money for parking . 
  i would consider to rent a car only if you plan to go exploring the tuscan hills . 
  also , if you book weeks before the travel 2 ticket florence-venice will cost way less than 100 $ . 
  ok , as a roman citizen i have to ask it ... what is `` ponte stroll '' ? 
  in school ? 
  you mean the place where everybody knows you and so you should fake to be transgender for the rest of your time in school ? 
  that 's not going to happen , for obvious reasons . 
  well put . 
  while i sincerly appreciate the effort , i do n't like very much those stuff where they try to explain to anxious people that they have no reason to be so anxious because everybody who is n't your immediate family of your partner have you in their mind only for a microscopic fraction . 
  well , no . 
  i do care way more than a microscopic fraction about people that i know .
