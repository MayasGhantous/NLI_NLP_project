  if you have the money and manpower to give the vaccine to everyone at risk since day 0 , then fantastic !, 
  do it . 
  but this rarely happens . 
  you ** have ** to test a drug for each specific tissue-pathogen interaction . 
  you can not just say that since this works with hpv in the uterus , it will works in the throat . 
  it probably will , but you can not be sure . 
  this vaccine was created to avoid cervical cancer , and was tested and approved for that . 
  it was created for cervical cancer because it is by far the most common complication of hpv infection among the serious stuff . 
  women are the group more at risk , a private company decided to develop a drug for that market , which is the biggest . 
  this is epidemiology and capitalism 101 . 
  `` golden '', 
  or `` northern '' , if you are british . 
  i 'm fairly sure that gas is not the primary general anesthetic anymore . 
  maybe at the time of andre 's surgery , but not today . 
  also ... 2l of vodka just to feel warm inside ? 
  do we have a better source ? 
  i mean , he was a giant , sure , but that still seems to much for just a buzz . 
  it 's not about the names ... 
  there is nothing trashy about a guy called `` kevin '' . 
  it 's that those parents are taking those names from the sub-culture of the trashy action bro and boobs and ass girl . 
  99 % the parents are from a specific demography , borderline redneck or straight full redneck . 
  italian here : for boys , basically every english names . 
  for girls , french names like `` chantall '' + the english name `` jessica '' . 
  jessica '' is especially bad . 
  if a girl with full italian heritage is called jessica , you can be 99 % sure that * at least * her parent are trashy . 
  `` i kissed several of the people that you now know as `` dad 's friends '' . 
  and they know it . 
  we are absolutely cool about it . '', 
  well , that is what i 'm not going to tell then when i will eventually have kids ... 
  mostly because i do n't know if their mother would be ok with the idea ... 
  seriously guys , while in high school it is probably just a rumour , in college join a group of whatever you like . 
  forget actual orgy , but `` promiscuous '' stuff are way more common than you can immagine . 
  and worst case scenario , you will met a lot of new people . 
  oh , absolutely . 
  this apply only if you are italian . 
  if you are from an english speaking country then it 's ok . , 
  those are full english names + suriname . 
  they are also stage names . 
  so no , they do not sound trashy . 
  the autocorrector strikes again : /, 
  it seems that all non-english speaking europe share this . 
  apparently trash is universal . 
  as i said int the other topic , it does n't . 
  it probably derive from a very old , regional , word that was used for iron-work related stuff , but it is so far from the actual world for '' blacksmith '' that no one in italy knows this . 
  the italian word for `` blacksmith '' is `` fabbro '' . 
  ferrari probably derive from `` ferrai '' , which can be intepreted as `` someone who works with iron '' . 
  while we are pretty sure that some of the substance released by the human body are capable to work like pherormones , we do not have evidence of an organ able to detect them . 
  so it seems that pherormones are irrilevant for humans , while `` conscious '' smell do matter . 
  i may be wrong , but i remember that usa are the only western country where the government can be `` shut down '' by the parliament without new election or at least a new government be required . 
  ( if you are confused by my last statement , in a parlamentary system the government is the expression of the houses , which are elected by the people . 
  so government can change without new elections , as long as the houses agree to do that . ), 
  the point is that people who are `` actual '' neckbeard have some serious problems . 
  being a `` neckbeard '' is not the cause of the problem , is the result of a big underlying problem . 
  they found a sub-culture where they are accepted . 
  i agree to what you guys already said , this article is way too simplicistic , but i have a semi relevant question to you ... 
  what do you think about kissing ? 
  i mean full kiss with tongue , not a kiss on the lips or a quick one . 
  because i know a group of people where long french kisses are the norm ( in specific occasions ) and this never causes any problem with friendship . 
  ( yes , i 'm part of that group of people , this is not a rumour , it 's 100 % true . ), 
  he wrote exactly the opposite of what you are saying . 
  using a card with your gloves on is an enourmous pain in the ass . 
  even if you have it attached somewhere , it is still difficult . 
  so yes , they are more or less comparable in the annoying factor . 
  i 'm pretty sure that a ski-pass watch was used in some part of south tirol back in the first years of the ' 00 . 
  he is a german ( austrian ? ), 
  model/photographer . 
  go look his facebook page , you can be so hetero that you watch only lesbian porn , but you * will have * to admit that the guy is hot as fuck . 
  you can do that with a retrospective analysis . 
  you just take the data about other or/and past culture . 
  nah , the nod is absolutelly * not * an international thing . 
  it 's not common in europe . 
  there is a semi-obscure joke to male fun of people who spell a lot as alot that say that there is the `` alot monster '' . 
  that is the alot monster , and he is formed by a map of the us because he said `` alot of * us * '' . 
  i 've seen mopeds with pedals up to the second half of the '90 here in italy . 
  but they were used to crank up the engine . 
  wen i was a teenager , before you could just open spotify and listen to an album by yourself , i * really * hated going to forums about music to hear about some new ( or new for me ) stuff . 
  apparently for those guys you should either say that a band was the worse thing to happen to the world since the plague , or you had to worship them . 
  if i say that i liked x album i 'm not expressing an articuled critic about the state of music and how that album is a masterpiece . 
  if i say that i did n't like x album i 'm not trashing the sentire band and all its discography . 
  the idea that you can simply say that a song is catchy and fun was completely lost to them . 
  yes , i would listen to that song while riding the metro to go home . 
  no , i do n't think that that song is a special piece of music that is better than other songs . 
  what i * really * dislike of this argument is that it imply that you are living in a sort of bubble . 
  yes , it 's 100 % true that you can not have a full understandment of how it is to manage the house budget until you have to do it by yourself . 
  but i have seen my parents do it , i have seen older friends do it , i have seen older friends almost * not * do it and be in serious problems , and whatnot . 
  the fact that i 'm not as experienced as you in something ** do not ** means that i believe that there are unicorns who fart rainbows out there . 
  guess what ? 
  i live too in the `` real world '' !, 
  did you eat chocolate and pastries even where you lived in calgary ? 
  if you eat the same amount of calaories and you are not losing any kg despite the physical exercise it may be useful to check that you tyroid is working . 
  you are thinking of depression as an * active * mood . 
  something that you feel . 
  i 'm sad . 
  i 'm happy . 
  depression is a passive mood , is not something you feel ... 
  it 's your baseline , it 's the ground where all the others emotions build up . 
  depression will make you not want to do things , because you know that they are useless . 
  depressione is like when you are dreaming of someone but in you dream you do not actually visualize his/her face . 
  you do n't need it , you * just know * that it 's him or her . 
  in the same way you do n't feel a specific emotion like sadness , you * just know * that it will be useless doing thing .
