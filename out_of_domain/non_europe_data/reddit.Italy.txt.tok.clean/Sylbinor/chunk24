  the important thing to note here is that a depressed person * can * laugh and enjoy the moment . 
  the problem is that he/she will revert back to the depression mood as soon as the stimulus ends . 
  i doubt that depression is over diagnosed , the criteria that you have to meet are pretty serious and evident to the trained eye ... 
  it 's not something that you can diagnose `` just to be safe '' . 
  i ca n't find the actual source , but i remember an article that said that there there is a limit to how much harsh your punishment can be . 
  reached a certain point you stop to see a decrease on the number of people convicted for that crime . 
  the reasoning was that after that point only people who tought that they would never be caught , or did it in an impulse , would commit that crime . 
  thus it would no matter to them how harsh the punishment is , because both of them do not factor the `` punishment '' part . 
  that 's the original sentence ? 
  in italian the translation is `` sono pazzi questi romani '' ... 
  this is not a forced translation , it 's a very natural one ... is a pun so perfect that i always thought that there was a similar pun in the original french ... 
  i 've never understood why in na mobile plan are so expensive . 
  unlimited talk to mobile/landline with unlimited text and 6gb of data would be about 45-50 $ in europe . 
  it 's not semantic . 
  * negotiated * means that they are discussing what this tpp * is * . 
  * done * means that it has been approved and it has full effect . 
  the process of getting the deal `` done '' is public and open to be shot down by everyone . 
  diary farmers or whatever . 
  every relationshio thread in every angle of the web is some variation of that . 
  most of the people are in those thead only for the drama . 
  yearly mammograph is pretty standard care , not something pushed by komen . 
  questioning of the yearly mamograph model is a recent and hot discussion in the medical field . 
  and the data we have varies a lot with the age of the women . 
  it is possibile that we will switch to a biannual mamograms for a certain age bracket and maintain the annual for another age bracket . 
  that was a semplicistic answer , or better , it 's a small part of the answer . 
  but he has a point . 
  in medicine everything is a risk , so you have to balance the risk/benefit ratio before you do anything . 
  women basically risk their life everytime they are pregnant . 
  according to who 's data in the developed countries 16 woman every 100 000 die during childbirth , or for complication due to the delivery . 
  now if i 'm testing a new drug and i find that 2 woman every 100 000 can have life threatening reaction to the drug , then i can say that the risk is acceptable , because 2 is way less than 16 . 
  ( this is an oversemplification , really ) . 
  for men there is no mortality rate for pregnancy , or any risk whatsoever . 
  so my `` benchmark '' to decide if a risk is acceptable is ** 0 ** . 
  especially if there already are others solution for the same problem that also have a 0 risk . 
  i want to stress here that deciding if the risk/benefit ratio is ok is always a decision made using ethics , context and personal inclinations . 
  i may very well decide that 2 every 100 000 is still too high and reject everything more than 1 every 100 000 . 
  you need way more testosterone , whatever the reason you have to take it , than what it 's needed for a pill to works . 
  since usa and russia have two completely different and * opposing * strategy about how to deal with syria , if the russians start enacting their plan the american one will be damaged . 
  so yes , it is your problem . 
  this is just an educated guess , but maybe they needed a place to act as a `` buffer zone '' . 
  i mean , one of the building of that area is where the pope helds mass audictions . 
  well , no since bisexual people can suffer from stigma by both heterosexual and homosexual people . 
  my educated guess as a medical student is that you are distracting your nerve receptors . 
  basically you can override the painful stimulus , at least in part , by `` filling '' the receptors with a different stimulus . 
  as i said i do n't know if this is the case here , but is something that exists and it is used in medical practice . 
  if you have to do an injection in a sensible area , like the genitals , tapping with a finger near the area will cause much less discomfort to the patient . 
  if something taste good it means that it contains substances that your boody needs , and milions of years of evolution made that you will find the odor of that substances good , in order to convince you to eat it . 
  actual depressed people do not care about fame . 
  the whole point about depression is that everything seems useless to you . 
  mmm , a lot of people are talking about testosterone here , but this is misleading . 
  testosterone promotes aggressivity , sure , but * not * as a baseline . 
  this means that unless you have abnormally high levels of testosterone you will not be significantly more aggressive than a ( human ) female . 
  what testosterone * do * is to make you more aggressive when you are already in an aggressive mode . 
  that is when production of testosterone will peak and can cause you to be more aggressive . 
  the reason to why most shooters are male is pretty much social . 
  terrorist are often males in the west , but in the middle east there has ben * a lot * o female terrorists . 
  this clearly means something , and sure as hell do not means that mid-easterners women has more testosterone in their blood . 
  the dominant culture want that the role model of the male is to be aggressive and this fuel the mind of those people with such ideas . 
  it 's not a coincidence that in `` ghetto '' or `` chavs '' settings girls are often very aggressive . 
  they grew up in a culture that expected that kind of aggressivity by anyone . 
  the revenge fantasy is also highly ingrained in american pop-culture . 
  so what we have in the end is that you have a subject that could not conform with society 's expectations of being strong and indipendent and that live in a culture that seems to love the idea of revenge . 
  testosterone is very probably just what fuel their rage when they are already shooting . 
  this makes no sense , you absolutely can not remove a bone from the nose . 
  half of the nose , maybe , more * is * bone . 
  the other half is carthilage , which is still a solid scaffolding . 
  how would the nose support itself without bone or carthilage ? 
  actually this is the very definition of `` the norm '' in a developed country . 
  the majority of people do grow up like you did . 
  if it seems that you know a lot of people who did n't , it 's because the minority who did n't still counts milions of people . 
  and this is ** bad ** do n't get me wrong . 
  this is n't unheard of , a theory is that they feel so profoundly guilty about it that they have a strong need to `` cleanse '' themselves by opposing strongly in public to the same stuff they enjoy in private . 
  that 's the parliamentary system , basically almost all of europe , japan and a bunch of other countries work like that . 
  plot twist : it was a story about a farmer . 
  they are probably so poor and difficult to reach that it did n't make sense to collect taxes there . 
  you would probably spend more to organize the trip than what do you collect . 
  my grandma lost her mother under american bombing in italy . 
  my mother says that when she was a kid my grandma was still resentfull against americans . 
  she needed decades to get over it . 
  i read that as a fl * e * shlight at first . 
  now * that * would have been dedication to the job ... 
  on a side note it always fascinated me an ancient greek verb that means both `` to enter '' and `` to exit '' . 
  everytime i had to traslate that verb , i could n't wrap my head around it . 
  how the hell can a verb have two opposite meaning ? 
  then a day it clicked . 
  probably the verb was the evolution of a much earlier word to express the action of '' passing trhough a door '' , or something like that . 
  so you can both mean to enter and to exit at the same time . 
  ( also , in most neo latin language you have way more words to describe shades of the color blue that there are in english ), 
  this does n't make sense . 
  almost one one in that video seems doing it right . 
  my guess is that those were just members of the organizer of the manifestation . 
  that actually was a way ending than the original ( that was later done in end of evangelion ) . 
  end of evangelion is very good , but it 's also almost `` standard '' . 
  the series is something completely new . 
  no , not for restaurant and places that sell food or basic stuff . 
  even if this story happened decades ago , i 'm 100 % sure that restaurants were open even on sunday . 
  usign `` romantic '' is misleading . 
  they mean that you do not feel a `` i want to be your partner '' emotion or a `` i want to fuck you '' emotion unless you formed a strong emotional bond . 
  basically you can be an hetero male and having emma watson naked inviting you to have sex and you reaction would be `` meh '' because you do not know her . 
  olive oil in the water that is boiling fort the pasta ?
