  hell no , no italian would do that . 
  the problem is that sometime the anxiety is not `` psicological '' but `` psychiatric '' , as in hard wired in your brain . 
  you can do all the logical reasoning that you want , but that will only ease the anxiety , not eliminate it . 
  absolutely confirm . 
  it probably come from the error of thinking that you give away more hints that you actually did . 
  everybody do it , everybody think that their mortivation are way clearer to others than they actually are . 
  so a girl can think that she was clearly showing that she is interested , and the guy knows it . 
  thus playing hard to get is an invitation to make a move . 
  but if the guy * did not * understand it really looks like you are trying to discuourage him . 
  since almost a years ago i got free movies and free train rides . 
  i wrote reviews of movies for a small scale website ( but big enough to be invited at the press events ) so i watched a lot of movies for free . 
  also both my mother and my father worked for the national railway operator , and thus i had the right to ride on any train operated by the company for free ( or playing just the booking fee ) until they retired . 
  ( since someone point this out everytime : free rides for the family of your workers are pretty common around the world , and are a part of your wage , * not * a bonus . 
  that means that if a month you are not using any train , or not enough , you were basically gettin less money than what your contractor said ), 
  it may , and i can not stress more the * may * here , a problem with her vagus nerve . 
  but it can also be something else , more serious . 
  *** tell her to get checked as soon as possible . 
  passing out for 10 minutes is no joke . 
  in europe every condom that is sold must pass the same test . 
  so even ifctor psicological reasons i would not buy the cheapest one , tecnically they are all tested for the same level of safety . 
  i do n't think the uk has opted-out of that . 
  i hope you did n't . 
  in italy every team operating on the train tracks ** must ** by law have a member whose only job is to look for incomings trains . 
  you know , a train is actually pretty quiet . 
  a moderate amount of external noise by the enviroment or your own tools and you will not hear the train untill it 's very close to you . 
  for me it 's more the very long life cycle that a good pc gives you . 
  i 've bought my pc something like 6 years ago , and i had to change my graphic card only a year ago . 
  i bought a mie range card and i 'm pretty sure that i would not need to change my pc for at least another year . 
  obviously i 'm not the guy who plays crysis at 4k . 
  you do realize that the fact that people , as a majoritity of the population , do not think like you say you do it 's why there are gender studies ? 
  people * do * care about who you like to fuck or how you dress . 
  that 's the whole point . 
  because gender is the social construct of how you are supposed to act based on your biologica sex . 
  trans people have a problem with their biological sex , not with their gender . 
  and actually there are evidences of the brain structure of trans people as being way more similar to the one of the gender they identify with than with their biological sex . 
  medium-high for stuff like marijuana and hashish , pretty much sure for everything else . 
  if it has to be produced in a lab , even if an home-made one , the probability of not having * any * link to a criminal organization are incredibly low . 
  born and raised in italy , never heard about about this radical group you are talking about . 
  also , your comment seems * really * biased . 
  two weeks ago , at a party , a drunk girl told me that she believed that i was gay because `` i 'm too cute * to be hetero '' . 
  she repeted that the next day , while sober . 
  ( she was there with her boyfriend guys , i know what you are thinking ), 
  * cute is not a good translation , the original word means something between `` cute '' and `` handsome '' . 
  i mean , she was n't telling me that i look too pretty and feminine . 
  ok , that 's why i used the * . 
  this is a translation problem . 
  in italian the phrase had zero ambiguity . 
  it really was n't a feminine vs masculine , or girlish vs hunk , thing . 
  it 's just that the english language lack a word without that ambiguity . 
  she was just saying that i looked good and that all the others boys at the party were either good looking gay or ugly heterosexual . 
  according to her , at least . 
  the amount of people that thinks that you can overcome legal rights if you sign a contract always confuse me . 
  uhm , where this came from ? 
  also , never heard of vaffa napoli outside of american circles . 
  you are mixing them up with the sardinians . 
  i think it still exist and hard limit , the speed of signal transmission in your neurons . 
  you still needs your brain working to `` dream '' , and the amout of `` data '' that can be processed will be capped by something like : time until death / max speed of signal transmission . 
  every human being produce the same hormones . 
  the only thing that change is the quantity . 
  males produce a lot of testosterone and a bit of estrogens , females produce a lot of estrogens and a bit of testosterone . 
  in females at a certain point there is a drastic decrease of production of estrogens : the menopause . 
  this means that now that tiny amount of testosterone has less `` competition '' , and can be more effective . 
  thus , it can promote the growth of a bit of facial hairs . 
  when i was a kid i stuttered a lot . 
  i overcame that by years of speech therapy but occasionaly , especially if i 'm anxious , i can still stutter . 
  it really buggers me when people , adult people , start to mock me for that . 
  why the fuck would you do that ? 
  i 'm straight , but i have a bisexual friend who introduced me to a lot of her lgbqt circles of friends ... 
  i 'm honestly still very surprised by the amount of gay men who tried to hit on me or said that they were dissapointed by the fact that i 'm not gay . 
  the point is to avoid to be forced to accuse yourself . 
  if you must respond or be charged with not collaborating , it can be very easy to extort you a confession , just to make it stop . 
  this is a very serious issue , ** everybody ** thinks that they will remain on their position because they know they are innocent , but we have decades of data telling us that ** a lot ** of people will tell you whatever you want to hear to make it stop . 
  it 's a pretty good comedy/slapstick series about a boy who fell in a cursed pit that cause him to change info a girl everytime he is drenched with cold water , and back to a boy when the water is hot . 
  almost everyone of the supporting character also fell in a cursed pit ( there are 1000 of them ) and transform in some kind of animal when wet . 
  telling it like this feel stupid , but is a comedy , it 's supposed to sound stupid . 
  it 's actually pretty good and fun to watch . 
  the area was almost completely closed to the cars 2 years ago . 
  there are 3 things to account for here :, 
  1 ) the social setting - if your life is already a mess you will have * a lot * more incentive to do drugs . 
  2 ) genetics - we do n't know much about this , but for some substances there are some genetic mutations that leads you to be hooked on them way faster . 
  there is a sub-unit of a receptor in the brain for nicotin that can exist in 2 form , and if you have the `` bad '' one is way much easier to become a smoker . 
  3 ) people often over estimates the power of addiction of a drug . 
  not all `` hard drugs '' give you an addiction immediately . 
  so the guy that seems to be `` immune '' from addiction could simply not being assuming enough drugs to develop an addiction . 
  honestly i think that is unhetical for college everywhere to do this . 
  do you know why every now and then you heard about a genius kid but very , very rarely you heard of any really big discovery coming out of one of those kids ? 
  because they proved to be able to learn exceptionally fast , but they did not prove to be better than anyone else who have learned the same thing but in a longer time span . 
  but why did i say that this is unethical ? 
  because you are making a kid skip some very important steps in his * social * learning . 
  will he be able to work in a team ? 
  will he be ok when he will not be the special one anymore ? 
  and why should him be the only 15 yo to not do the same stuff that teenagers do ? 
  if he is a genius he will * still * be a genius at 20 years old . 
  since i corrected my hypotiroidism , i can eat whatever i want without gaining any weight . 
  also , apparently light physical exercises twice a week are more than enough to lose weight for me . 
  i have a strong feeling that this is 10 % an `` i 'm not really trying to impress you so i look confident '' and 90 % `` i think that girl is interested in me , but i ca n't check if it 's true , so it 's true '' . 
  i mean , it happened to everybody , male or female , to think that one person was hitting on you only to discover that this was n't really the case . 
  if you are not single you ca n't try that , so you will remain convinced that she/he was really hitting on you . 
  do you have older siblings ? 
  maybe one of them was the cause of the scar , and this is why they say they do n't know about it .
