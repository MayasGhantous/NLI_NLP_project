  no plot shield . 
  a character is sorrounded by monsters ? 
  heavily wounded ? 
  well , he is probably going to die . 
  too bad the plot became incredibly stupid at about 3/4 of the story , because it was one of the best action cominc ever made before that . 
  * last, 
  piazza navona is extremely overpriced for food . 
  i mean yes , you are paying the view , but it is ** very ** touristy . 
  no , it 's not rude to not order a dessert . 
  no idea where that came from ... 
  it has . 
  it 's softened by the fact that digimon can reborn as eggs , but they could lost all their memory , so it 's still not as they are immortal . 
  there is some exceptions to this where a digimon can actually die and never be reborn . 
  guys , the point it 's not being modest . 
  the point is that you are saying that you did not expect anything for what you did to the other person . 
  what we are saying when we pretendend to refuse a gift is `` no , i helped you because i 'm a good person '' . 
  an important point is that a tranquillizer ** does not ** work as in the movies . 
  you need a specifically trained professional to estimate the quantity of drug to sedate an animal . 
  and this usually require knowing a good estimate of the animal weight , which you do not have . 
  too much drug and you kill the animal . 
  not enough , and he will wake up sooner than you expected . 
  it a very fine line . 
  ( this absolutely true also for humans . 
  the whole `` cloroform on a napkin '' thing will either not work or straight on kill the person . 
  guessing the right dose by just looking at a guy is hard as hell , and basically luck ), 
  a lot of religions did and still do that , actually . 
  for example , shintoism in japan is basically founded on the idea that individual objects have a `` spirit '' inside of them . 
  in the classical era you could destroy the rival city temple if they really pissed you off , even if you worshipped the same gods , because the gods protecting the city were n't * exactly * your gods . 
  they were the gods of that temple . 
  this last one is a bit murky as a concept , but the idea is the gods had a very strong relationship with their physical rappresentation . 
  for christianesim this simply is n't a thing , a statue is a statue and that 's it . 
  if you have it good , if you do n't have it is still fine . 
  on this note , people seems to grasp the concept only when is something ** extremely ** bad , like the parents beating the kids . 
  your parents are n't alcholics that beat the shit out of you ? 
  well , then you can not be really in distress . 
  everything is fine . 
  they ca n't grasp the idea that bad parents = / = monsters . 
  i did n't expect such a reply . 
  i 'm very sorry to hear your story , you are doing the right thing, 
  it depends . 
  if your problem was that the costant flux of stomach acid caused an ulcer to never fully heal , a ppi will totaly cure you , indirectly . 
  that 's what worked for me . 
  i 'm not sure about the fact that if you could bring a man 1000 years in the past he would have a poor health system . 
  the inherited part would still be there , since his ancestor clearly were able to defend themselves , and the `` random '' part is , well , random , so it does n't matter . 
  he would have a lot of problem with his/her gut bacteria and will catch a the flu very easily . 
  it depends . 
  in some parts of the world philosophy is part of the high school curriculum . 
  in europe is relatively common . 
  really ? 
  you do not study germans philosopher ? 
  this is absolutely true , but a yearly check-up for an healthy person is * not * reccomended . 
  this is a common misconception , a `` full '' check-up once a year is just a burden for the system and stressful for the patient ( and possibly dangerous for false positive ) . 
  now , an annual `` visit '' to the doctor where you talk about your health , diet and lifestyle is another story . 
  this is bullshit . 
  the `` she does n't cook '' is just one , irrilevant part of the testimony . 
  there is absolutely no law whatsoever that would process someone for this . 
  this is a case of domestic violence fair and square , the woman is violent and phisically abusive to her husband and her son . 
  stupid clickbaiting journalist pick the `` she does n't cook '' from the papers and ran with it . 
  i have several source for this , but they are all in italian . 
  you will be travelling in summer , this mean that you will arrive in milan whit the sun already out . 
  it will not be night , and this make a huge difference . 
  as you said just find a spot with something trustworty near and chill for about an hour . 
  they total exists , but you have to remember that those are heterosexual woman now . 
  so their sexual preference is towards men , and due to the hormone therapy trans woman have a lot of problem to have a solid erection ... ( and they usually do not want it , since it is a very masculine thing ) . 
  so to shoot porn with a trans woman banging a woman you have to found a trans woman with is homosexual/bi and that want to do porn . 
  or a trans woman who does n't care too much ( it 's not that uncommon for hetero actress to play lesbian scenes ), 
  that kind of porn totally exist , but it 's harder to shoot . 
  do you know what `` tiramis\u00f9 '' is ? 
  is a typical italian sweet ( * not * the gelato version ) that is very , very good . 
  here in rome there is a shop got extremely famous for his tiramis\u00f9 , and so people from alla around the city go there to buy it . 
  now you can immagine that this cause a lot of problems of traffic , with people parking their car where they should n't or like assholes . 
  a couple of years ago the city decided to act against this and basically made impossibile for people to park where they should n't . 
  the owner of the shop made a huge fuss * litterally * saying the administration should not enforce the law there because his business were more important . 
  and since apparently this was n't enough he closed the shop for a couple of day with a sticker on the door that threatened to `` sell the shop to chinese people '' . 
  he fucking used the idea of chinese people owning the shop as a scare tactic . 
  fuck that guy , there are hundreds of other places in rome which do a tiramis\u00f9 as good as his . 
  i 'm not buying anything from a racist who thinks that he should not follow the law . 
  ok , i have to ask it . 
  how 80 $ factors in the average budget ? 
  i mean , how much of your wage is ? 
  because i keep reading about 16 $ for a movie ticket in the usa , and this is litterally double the price that i pay , in western europe . 
  dude , italy is a net contributor of the eu budget . 
  we are paying for others as much as you guys . 
  it seems that there are chinese writings on the cross , so i guess that this is in china ... 
  i have heard that people in the east have problems with the idea of a god that does n't look powerful . 
  it is true ? 
  and if yes , maybe this is an attempt to address this problem ? 
  mmmh , so assuming that yours is an average position , it seems that 16 $ for a ticket is pretty expensive . 
  i wonder what caused this . 
  now i 'm curious , how did your father react ? 
  * i will not yell at them for minutes and minutes for every single mistake in their homework, 
  * yelling will not be my first response if something bad happens, 
  * i will not vent off on my children my frustrations, 
  * i will not use phrases like `` you ca n't understand a fucking thing '' when they make mistakes, 
  * i will not open randomly the bathroom 's door while they are taking a shower to see if they use soap , and get really angry if i do n't see the soap ( because i understand that you have to wash the soap after applying it ), 
  * i will not accuse my children of not using soap in front of strangers ( or anyone , really ), 
  * i will not accuse my children of faking to wash their face because i do n't hear the constant and uninterupted sound of the water flowing, 
  * i will not wait until it happens to me to not having hot water in the shower to call someone to fix it . 
  i will believe my children . 
  * i wil not show interest about their life only when school grades or bad things are involved,
