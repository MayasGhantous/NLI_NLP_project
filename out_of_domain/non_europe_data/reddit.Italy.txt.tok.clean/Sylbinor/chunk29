  because this `` the woman do not work '' ended pretty much in the ' 70 , and we are in 2016 . 
  hmm , actually a mouse has to be healty and `` happy '' to be a good test subject . 
  a stressed out animal can really screw up the result of a test . 
  most of the regulations for animal testing would make sens even in this fictional no-ethics world . 
  nothig to say about your post , excpet for the train part . 
  both the line florence-venice and rome-florence are served by the high-velocity trains , and i 'm talking about the frecciarossa , which is the fastest . 
  you can go from rome to florence in an hour and half . 
  i usually agree , but for a 6.5 houra trip ... 
  i would seriously considers it . 
  it depends on what the difference is . 
  i have been in trains where you had a lot more space for your legs and more comfortable seats ( and some stuff like free snacks ) . 
  ok . just do n't get to cocky about your knowledge of bears , ok ? 
  the `` crazy one '' exists in every species . 
  ok , maybe you can help me . 
  one of my very first porn was an hentai , the title was something like `` i 's '' or `` y 's '' ( or at least had those letters in it ) it was about a girl masturbating and i remember this scene with a her clitoris fully erect and she sorta squirting in a glass during the climax . 
  it was almost tasteful , nothing too raw . 
  i have never found that hentai again . 
  yes , you totally wanted to be a teacher but changed your mind for fear or being hit on by your students . 
  like , this is totally believable , dude . 
  that happened . 
  i think it was steinback who said that socialism does n't grow in america because the poor there views themselves as temporarily embarassed milionaries . 
  i do n't like many of the other replies , i 'll try to tell you a more concise and precise answer . 
  there are 3 reasons . 
  1 ) ** it was an exceent pr move ** . 
  at the time the political system was just * beggining * to came out a phase where it basically was a game for rich people . 
  the vast majority of politicians were rich dudes who split in parties because they had different views on how to be rich dudes . 
  it was at the end of 19th century that we start to have popular , as in from the regular folks , political movements gain momentum . 
  socialism was ** the ** political ideal for the regular folks . 
  skip to the first half of the 20th century , and having the word `` socialism '' in your name was sending a clear message : `` we are not burgeois fatcats , we are the good ones '' . 
  you have to remember that the usa is the only country where socialism is considered inherently bad . 
  2 ) ** socialism basically means that the state takes care of the well being of the population ** . 
  at that time the word socialism was n't so strongly linked to a specific ideology . 
  it meant that your party wanted that the state would provide most of the needs of the citizens . 
  the idea is the same , but a left wing '' socialist '' party will greatly differ in their policies from a right wing `` social '' party . 
  still now there is a liberist right wing and a social right wing . 
  3 ) ** in the beginning they had different policies ** no party can grow if their program is `` let 's beat up some people '' . 
  they have to start by making actual policies , and using those idea to rally people . 
  that is what hitler and his peer did . 
  then , they ditched a lot of those idea to impose heavy authoritarians ones . 
  it would be very long to write now , but long story short , after the nazi took power they killed a bunch of their down dudes , the sa , because they were too much bounded to the `` old '' ideas of the party . 
  ( * this is an over esemplification , i know * ) . 
  but how many hair ? 
  like some hair here and there , or like chest 's hair ? 
  hmm , ok , but i was asking because in a male hairs in an unusual area like the back , shoulders and back of the hand/foot is unusual but considered normal . 
  it 's an aesthetic problem . 
  but if you have a lot of hair in areas such has the penis shaft , the forehead ... 
  this may not be normal , and maybe a doctor can do something about it . 
  or even if he ca n't , you should check that this is n't connected to something else . 
  the problem is that i really do n't know anything about guitar . 
  for example , is ibanez a good brand ? 
  because i 've seen a couple of deal for an ibanez ... 
  oh , i just realized that i 'm a bigger newbie than i thought ... 
  i thought that `` acoustic '' meant `` regular '' guitar , i had no idea about that there are classic and acoustic ... 
  so , back to square zero . 
  which one should i buy , acoutisc or classic ? 
  i 'm mostly interested on the `` singing around a fire '' style for now ... 
  i mean , i want to being able to play the guitar for fun with friends in the long run . 
  thank you , but i just realized that i relly do n't know anything about guitars ... 
  i thought that `` acoustic '' meant `` regular '' guitar , i had no idea about that there are classic and acoustic ... 
  so , back to square zero . 
  which one should i buy , acoutisc or classic ? 
  i 'm mostly interested in the `` play songs with your friends '' style for now . 
  mmm , actually i really like the `` warm '' sound of a classica guitar ... 
  but i 'm also interested in learning how to play some `` popular '' song ... 
  maybe they legally could n't ban car , so they set a limit so low to render useless the use of a car . 
   if you have any other question , feel free to ask away , it 's exciting to help complete noobs to be honest haha, 
  ahaha , you should n't have said that !, 
  you 're right i 'm really thinking about buying a classical guitar , i really like its warm sound and since i 'm not going to spend a lot of time on it , at least for now , maybe an easier to play guitar is the better choice . 
  i 'm still not 100 % convinced , but i 'm leaning on that side now . 
  i know , that 's why i edited my comment , but you read it faster than i edited it ahaha, 
  add to this that if 10 % of sperm cels die in the process , the others 90 % are perfectly usable . 
  if 10 % of the cell of an organism die , the sentire organism can die or be severly affected . 
  what does skipping means ? 
  i 'm not from the usa . 
  but why that kind of bra caused the nipples to be erected ? 
  i live in rome , and now and then in the city centre you can find marble plaques with some old engraving telling people to to not trhow there their litter , by order of this or that person ... well , just yesterday i found one that was dated 1757 . 
  a sign telling people to not litter was older than the usa . 
  because storage data is cheap , and no more than a tiny fraction of your users are gon na use all their space . 
  if you offer 5 gb of space to 1000 users you do not need to have 5000 gb always at hand . 
  you may want to have the capacity to buy and deploy them very quickly , but not to pay for them from the start . 
  you have to pay for much less storage , and since storage is very cheap , you can serve your 1000 with relatively little money . 
  money that can come from little ads on your service , or you can choose to just spend them without any gain and use the service as advertisement . 
  the drug has to be either formed of a small molecules , which just phisically pass on the `` pores '' of the membrane , or be coupled with another molecule which can trick those `` pores '' to open a bit more , let 's say ( this is not really what happens , but the end result is the same ) ; i may be wrong , but your drug still has to be not to big . 
  it does exist , it 's called impact factor, 
  it 's not a list , but a rate assigned to each journal . 
  i think that actually only great britain and the nordic countries have this kind of right to roam . 
  i do n't think it exist in italy , the closest thing that i come in mind is the fact that you can freely roam on the seaside . 
  private owners ca n't block people to walk in their land up to a certain distance from the sea . 
  ( also every x meters of private beach it must be x meters of public beach , but this is another story ), 
  every time a serious program of integration has been used , the levels of success was more or less the same of any other impoverished comunities . 
  the problem is that is very hard to have a serious program of integration for gypsies because spending money for them means that your political opposition will use it against you . 
  proposing a project of social housing for gypsies means that the next second you present the bill some far-right politicians is shouting on tv that you are taking houses away from your citizens to give them to the gypsies , despite the fact that most gypsies came to europe more than 2 century ago , and are citizens like everyone else . 
  i 'm not makying an hyperbole here , this absolutely happens . 
  we litterally had protests for social houses given to gypsies family despite those families having all the requisite as anyone else . 
  now do n't get me wrong , gypsies ** do ** have a strong isolationist culture that makes it harder to do something , but the point is that this created a vicious cycle where it 's fucking hard to do something for them , so they grow a distrust for the society and get more isolated , thus the society grow a distrust for them and so on , in a cycle ... 
  it 's a very , very nasty situation where every part is doing something to make things worse . 
  buy them as much in advance as possible . 
  the lowcost company that you have to check are ryanair , easyjet and vueling , maybe wizzair , if you plan to go in eastern europe . 
  ( but take a look at `` standard '' companies now and then , deals happens ) . 
  the whole `` lastminute '' thing work if you do not care where you are going , and still is a bit of a gamble .
