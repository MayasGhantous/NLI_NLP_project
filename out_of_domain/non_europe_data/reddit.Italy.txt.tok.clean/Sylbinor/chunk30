  if you have a specific place to be is totally a gamble . 
  9 times out of then you will not find any deal for your destination . 
  tl ; dr book in advance , as soon as possible . 
  lowcost companies are ryanair , easyjet and vueling . 
  use the company website to buy the ticket . 
  i usually reply to those kind of people explaining how litterally everyone of their rights comes from the humanities field . 
  i mean , i 'm extremely grateful to the guys who inventend the fridge , but i 'm also extremely grateful to the guys who thought and spread the habeas corpus . 
  you mean that we are not the last one to adopt the 112 as universal number for emergencies in the eu ? 
  wow !, 
  colour me surprised . 
  when i was in high school a friend of mine decided to do a little prank to a teacher : he came to school in his pijamas and with his pillow under an arm , waited until everyone was already in class and then he rushed in the classrom yelling `` i 'm sorry , i overslept today ! '', 
  pretty simple and innocuos , right ? 
  except that the teacher became basically white , had her eyes wide open and almost fainted . 
  it turned out that some years ago she teached in a class with a mentally disabled kid that one day actually came in class in his pijamas and then threw himself out of the window . 
  so that was like an horrible flashback for her . 
  so everything is fine as long is your neighbour to be hurt and not you ? 
  because a rich person wealth is not going to be divided as the power of a government is going to be . 
  that 's not true , the vast majority of the infrastructure for passengers trains are shared with freight trains . 
  the difference is that passenger trains have always the right of way , usually . 
  if a passenger train is going faster than a freight on the same track , the freight will be ordered to stop at the first station available to clear the way for the passenger train . 
  fun things is , no , they are not going to bring you the check , ever . 
  ( unless they are closing , of course ) . 
  in europe you do not bring the check unless the guest asks for it . 
  it is actually considered rude to do this , and this is something that people , especially older people , * really * consider annoying . 
  the only exception is if the place is closing . 
  if there are a lot of people waiting to eat there they may do this , but * only * if it 's some kind of cheap place . 
  you know , a mouth barrier is n't considered actually useful anymore . 
  i mean , if you can carry it without it occpuying too much space then carry it , sure . 
  but infection passed doing a cpr are in the realm of extraordinary , and the general consensus in the field is that as long the airways are not obstructed what is keeping the person alive is the cardiac massage , the artificial respiration is not vital . 
  well , once you know how to use one , it 's mostly a matter of knowing how much exactly you do have to pay . 
  some cities use a system that is a bit complicated if you plan to go out the city center . 
  otherwise you just have to know how to read a map . 
  now , technology can come in your help . 
  in most cities with a good public transport you can check the route , the bus stop , how much time to wait and sometime even when to get off . 
  i suggesti you to use google maps or city mapper since you said that you are going to rome . 
  google maps is more straightforward and easy to use , but it gives you a bit less information . 
  city mapper instead is a bit more measy ( but very usable ) but will tell you ** everything ** that you need to know . 
  you set the starting point , the end point , and it will tell you which bus or metro to use , where to get in and where to get off , and it will allert you when you are approching the bus stop where you have to get off . 
  ( obviously since this is gps based , it wo n't alert you if you are on the metro . ), 
  it has also a tons of other stuff like alert for strikes and whatever . 
  i live in rome , so if you need to know something more specific , just ask me !, 
  oh you are totally right , now and then they change something ( with good reasons , i mean ) . 
  that 's why some association like the american heart association issue only time limited certification . 
  for the ahs is 2 years . 
  did you know that now is not anymore abc , but cab ? 
  the reason is that as i said , having a circulation is now considered more important than putting more air in the lungs . 
  edit : for everyone reading this , what i wrote ** do not ** mean to never attempt mouth to mouth respiration in case of a cpr . 
  it means that is not considered mandatory anymore for a good cpr , but if you can ** do it ** . 
  oh you are totally right , now and then they change something ( with good reasons , i mean ) .

  well , 24.000 people is still 24.000 people , regardless of what percentage of the population they form ... 
  it 's relatively easy to rally that much people , it 's something that is very easily done in bigger numbers in every country with free speach for a moderately hot topic . 
  whatsapp is by far the app with the most user base . 
  the only market where they are n't huge is the usa , but there no messaging app is huge because their telco gave away unlimited texts years before the rest of the world . 
  now facebook control the biggest opponent to their messenger app . 
  nobody can monetize from it . 
  well , for example in the usa market you text to a friend and if you have to send a file or do a group chat ... you use facebook messenger , mostly . 
  they do n't have a direct profit from messenger , their `` profit '' is to keep you using their stuff . 
  if you are using their stuff you will :, 
  a ) jump at every new thing they release, 
  b ) not using other 's company stuff, 
  keeping your user base is vital , if you have , 1,4 bilion of user like fb does , people are going to do business with you . 
  whats ` app was an incredibly strong competitor , and they bought that . 
  i know , i was talking about the usa market . 
  it never died . 
  what died was a cultural system able to keep a relatively stable linguistic standard . 
  a language is a tool of comunication among people , it 's a shared code . 
  if i say opple instead of apple , you will not understand me , because this is not part of that shared code . 
  how do you maintain this code shared ? 
  by giving people incentives to learn your code . 
  do you want to watch the last starical play ? 
  you have to know the code it was written in . 
  do you want to do business with a guy coming from 3 cities away ? 
  you have to know the code he use . 
  do you want to not be arrested because you break the law ? 
  you have to know the code in which it is written . 
  when rome fell , the pronvices became isolated . 
  all those incentives to share a code went away . 
  so now if people in a province say opple , then opple it is . 
  nobody from 3 cities away is coming to do business , no satirical play is coming from greece , and no law is coming from rome . 
  this caused all the local `` accents '' of latin to grow indipendently , and in hundreds and hundres of years they became new languages . 
  if you look at text written in italian or french around 800-900 dc ( not 1800 , i really mean 800 ) , they still sound like latin with french or italian in it . 
  but ehi , a power able to keep a stable linguistic standard ** did ** survive ... 
  the church . 
  and in fact they continued to use latin for more than a thousand years ... latin is still now the official language of the holy see , and they totally use it . 
  cultured and powerful people used latin as a lingua franca until about the 1700 . 
  well , first of all the greek spoken today in greece is very different from the ( various dialects of ) greek that was spoken in ancient times . 
  modern greeks are able to generally understand what a text in ancient greek is about , but not to * really * read it . 
  ( the same happens with latin and romance languages , but to a lesser degree . 
  latin is farther from the romances gramatically ), 
  then , there is a thing called the eastern roman empire , or bizantine empire , which used greek as an official language . 
  and the bizantine empire fell in 1453 . 
  so greek lost its `` standardizing '' force way , way after latin . 
  i live in rome , in the historical city centre the only difference between off-season and high season is that you go from `` hey , a lot of tourist here '' to `` is anybody * not * a tourist here ? 
  well , the trick is that rome is huge . 
  you are not going to the tourist crowded places unless you want to . 
  basically any further analysis will be destructive for part of vasari 's fresco .
