  norman conquest of sicily !, 
  also sardinians usually speaks with a very thick accent , so you probably speak italian with a sardinian accent , wich should be pretty funny to hear . 
  in all the major western city 100k is not enought to buy an apartment . 
  regarding point 2 , `` white coat high pressure '' as sometime is called , is a so frequent phenomen that it 's common practice to ask the patient to measure the pressure at home and stick with that if it is a bit higher than what the patient told you it was at home . 
  this is probably the only time when is medically sound to use the data provided by the patient rather than your own . 
  some people just get high pressure when they see a doctor , even if they are perfectly fine . 
  it depends . 
  taxis have a fixed fare from the city center ( inside the aurelian 's walls , and your hotel is inside them ) to fco which is of 48 euros . 
  do not accept a different price . 
  it is written on the side of the taxi , just ask for the fixed fare * before * you accept the ride . 
  there are a couple of private bus company , the most famous of them is `` terravision '' , i 've never used them so i can not really help you , but i 've heard good things . 
  the price to fco is about 4 euros , and they leave from termini station . 
  your other options are the trains , the public transit . 
  from termini station you have two options , the regional train `` fl1 '' which do several stops before reaching the airport , or the `` leonardo express '' which goes directly to the airport , no others stops , and is a `` guaranteed '' train : it will run even in case of a strike or whatever . 
  the normal regional train costs 8 euros , while the `` leonardo express '' costs 16 euros . 
  since your hotel is not far from termini i do n't think that 48 euros for a taxi is worth it , honestly . 
  there are huge ethical problems with getting paid for donations . 
  problems that trickle down on the medical side . 
  in order to be elegible for donation you have to answer a series of questions that can not be detected by a test . 
  if you are donating blood/body part , you have no interest in lying . 
  but if you are getting paid , you * do * have an interest in lying . 
  so now a poor guy has some ilness or a faulty organs because you needed money . 
  this may vary by jurisdiction , but you are still kinda guilty if you purposedly set something to be exploited for an illegal activity . 
  i mean , they have to prove that you did it on purpose , and you still would n't be guilty of the whole crime , but it 's not a `` get out of jail free '' card . 
  i think that a very interesting point is that rodger was good looking . 
  he could absolutely have a girlfriend , he just was too messed up in the head . 
  people think that a `` crazy '' person is a guy shouting nonsense at the sky and whatever , but they are actually the fringe of mental health issue . 
  a lot of people who * need * help seems normal until you know them better . 
  it change a lot on the pictures you watch . 
  i mean , in some pictures he looks good looking , in others he 's average . 
  it depends a lot about what you consider `` good looking '' , i guess . 
  wait , did you tell your doctor that your pressure was fine at home ? 
  your pressure should have been really high in his/her office if bp drugs was a possibility . 
  i mean , white coat high pressure is a well known phenomen , you usually just trust what the patient tells you . 
  unless the pressure is so high that it 's too much of a risk believing the patient . 
  why was rome able to take that kinf of casualties at that point in its history ? 
  well , it 's good but the humble bragging in that post is terrible ... 
  oh , totally . 
  i mean , it 's a bit of an over semplification , but i do totally agree with that post . 
  mindgames and all that stuff is crap . 
  i just found the second part to be very crongeworthy , like when a person that you hate tells a good joke . 
  you know that is a good joke and you laugh , but you still feel bad for laughing . 
  you know , horse riding lessons actually are n't particularly expensive . 
  i 've checked the prices recently for a gift , and the average cost is about , maybe a bit more , than an average guitar lesson . 
  i dated a girl who turned out to be an insufferable a-hole when things do n't go exactly as she wants . 
  we met in summer , dated a bit then just drifted away from eachother , we just did n't match * that * much . 
  we remained good friends . 
  until some months ago she just started annoying almost everyone in our group of friends , everyone for a different reason but always for small things that she blew waaay out of proportions . 
  it turns out that she take every fucking criticism as a personal insult , and * will * bitch about it for * litteraly * months . 
  it 's extremely tiresome for everyone involeved . 
  except her , i guess . 
  once you hit terminal velocity it does n't matter if you are falling from 1000 or 10000 ft. 
  a penguin is a fishy , obviously . 
  in young males with no pre-existing medical conditions erectile disfunsion is psicological 9 times out of 10 . 
  you very probably developed a block with that girl , you have to work that out . 
  at least half of the usa , maybe more , is at the same latitude as north africa , not europe . 
  europe is way norther than most people , even europeans , think . 
  it 's hot stream from the ocean , like the gulf current , that warms europe more than it should . 
  they do n't have kebab ?!? 
  oh god , that stuff is like half the diet of a college student here in europe . 
  in italy we use separate , little , towels for that . 
  pro-tip : if you are in an italian house and cant ' t find the towel to dry your band , ** do not ** use the small ones above or nex to the bidet . 
  you * first * use tp . 
  then when is clean you use the bidet and dry up with the towel . 
  it 's rare that you have a shitty towel in the end . 
  if it happens you just wash it and use a clean one . 
  i 'm fairly sure that at that point the japanese and german government were very stable on their own . 
  also `` do n't judge a rapist '' it 's a pretty unpopolar thing to pass to the public opinioni in the ex-allies countries . 
  two reasons :, 
  1 ) women enter puberty a couple of years before men , and this means that some change in the brain happens earlier . 
  2 ) culturally girls were , and to some degree still are , expected to behave as adult way earlier than boys . 
  as close as fifty years ago a 15 years old girl had already been taught how to manage the house and do chores , and she would be expected to help her mother . 
  a 15 years boy was not expected to learn or do any of this . 
  still nowadays is somewhat expected that girls behave correctly while boys can be `` unruly '' for some years more before we really start to worry about them . 
  uhm , no . 
  unless the cancer came back ** very ** fast , the organism would have recovered from the chemo . 
  sugar high is something specific to the usa . 
  nobody has heard of it here in europe . 
  absolutely nobody . 
  so yes , it 's a myth . 
  this stuff happens all the time , in italy people are 100 % convinced that if you feel sick you can eat only pasta or rice without any condiment . 
  we call it `` eating in white '' because well , pasta and rice do looks white without any condiment . 
  this has 0 % truth and nobody outside of italy do this . 
  but * just try * to serve a plate of pasta with tomato sauce to a sick person here and they will react as you are poisoning them . 
  i do n't know the math behind this , but an autetication dongle or software will be shipped to you with a pre-installed algorithm that use a secret key to generate a random range of numbers every x seconds . 
  when that specific dongle/software is linked to your own account , a software on the server side pairs your account to that secret key , and it too star generating random numbers every x seconds . 
  since they use the same secret key , they will generate the same random numbers at the same time . 
  when you type those numbers in a web page , they just check that they are the same to grant you access . 
  i may have got wrong some details , but this is the idea behind a two-facto autentication . 
  uhm , no , `` il galateo '' is mostly useless nowadays . 
  it cotains very basic stuff that are common of all the western country , or things specific of the renaissance period that are not useful anymore . 
  it 's not always like that . 
  some places charge you more for eating at a table , but many do not . 
  in tourist areas the places that charges you are more common . 
  the reason we have coffe and pastry standing is just a cultural thing . 
  we drink mostrly espresso , which is basically a shot of coffe , you drink it in 5 seconds . 
  it depends . 
  some places are totally free . 
  if they are in a things like a bar or a restaurant they will be free , but is considered a bit rude to use it without buyng anything ... 
  restroom in places like a train station or a museum can be free or you do have to pay .
