  a teenager with her mom present , a clearly very religious person ) talking like this is not doing your job well . 
  you are supposed to avoid any confusion when giving information regarding their healt to your patients , and `` adult activities '' is pretty vague . 
  people with parents that never told them about this stuff exists , like people with some mentale condition . 
  ok , i think i 'm missing something here . 
  `` mentale '' was my autocorrector fault 's , since my first language is italian and we say `` mentale '' for `` mental '' . 
  there is a pun in english with `` mentale '' ? 
  that 's correct . 
  the gird are national , but they are heavily interconnected . 
  about 10 years ago a line in switzerland failed , causing an overcharging ( or undercharging , those are a big problem too ) of the connected italian lines , and almost all of italy had a blackout for like 10 hours . 
  no , really ? 
  ca n't fool you , sherlock . 
  also , `` presenting '' ? 
  really ? 
  ahem , i 'm pretty sure that that was the point . 
  that it 's such an outlandish title that you should say `` this did n't happen until you prove me wrong '' . 
  well , but maybe we have more sex than them , it would not surprise me . 
  i mean , when they were young casual sex was a rarer thing ( even if it was n't nearly as rare as people think ) . 
  the difference is that we have easy access to contracception . 
  the very first interaction that i had with a fph member , when the thing was just getting big , was a guy who tried to convince me that hormonal-related obesity was rarer than an unicorn . 
  the funny thing is that ** i was saying that is rare ** . 
  but `` rare '' was not enough for him . 
  why ? 
  it 's not that the heart beat at that rythm , is that that ryhtm permit to have an acceptable blood flow . 
  and yes , it is one of the `` tricks '' that you can use . 
  well , yes , anything that is famous enough to be known by everyone and has a rhythm between 100 and 120 bpm will do the job . 
  that line is operated by , i do n't know how is called in english , a `` phone stop '' . 
  every time a train has to leave a station the stationmaster of the station has to call the next station and he have to say if the track is free or no . 
  if the other guy says that a train has already left his station , the second train ca n't move until the first one reach the next station . 
  what * probably * happened here is that one of the two stationmaster fucked up , and said something wrong to the other one . 
  no it 's not . 
  for fuck 's sake , this kind of system should be upgraded , yes , but they are not particulary unsafe . 
  they are used in many part of the western world , and no eu funds are strictly bounded to their destination , they do n't give the money to you until the actual works start . 
  what the hell erasmus have to do with all this , is a mistery . 
  yeah , i 'm being angry here , i know , but the erasmus project is one of the best thing for work relationship that ever happened . 
  and remember that any train that pass inside a station will not do it at full speed . 
  at that velocity you would die , it 's not a matter of `` if '' . 
  you should run to the back of the train to have some chanche . 
  that 's what they do . 
  the seizing happens after an agreement failed . 
  ok , i stumbled here following a google search , but now i have to ask if you can help me . 
  i have a friend who seems unable to go over a really huge crush on a straight girl . 
  it 's been more than a year since all this started , that girl is with a boy and she knows it . 
  she is actually friend with * both * of them ... but she is still clearly `` waiting '' for this girl . 
  and this really should stop , because she is clearly not happy , she do very cringey things like hugging her when there is a romantinc song , and go out of her way to get noticed by this girl . 
  it 's honestly sad to see her acting like this , but i really do n't know how to help her , if it is possible . 
  she had a relationship for 3 months in this year . 
  she was the one to broke up , and nothing changed . 
  yes , she has talked to me about it a lot of time , even if not recently . 
  but you developed all the others stuff , you voice is now lower , your penis and testicles are bigger and your shoulder are broader . 
  if not , please go see a doctor right now . 
  and sometime we use `` madre patria '' , which means '' mother fatherland '' . 
  it 's just that `` patria '' does n't sound as `` gendered '' as `` fatherland '' does , even if it totally is . 
  yes , but it 's not like they decided that bristol is 4 minutes behind london because they made a calculation . 
  the time was setted on the city tower clock , and the city tower clock was regulated using the position of the sun at noon . 
  which was slightly behind , or forward , london due to the latitude of the city . 
  real hippies were also a minority of the population . 
  to professionally print something . 
  you know how people says things like `` an e-book should cost way less than the book , because it 's just data ! '' . 
  if you are buying a 10 dollar book , the cost of printing it was probably 1 dollar . 
  the real expenses are in other stuff like the editor , lettering , graphics , distributions ... 
  newspapers , which are printend in huge quantities with cheap paper and ink can cost less than 10 cents each copy to print . 
  but normal weight woman can have problems reaching an orgasm , and also be anorgasmic . 
  his explanation seems to say that not reaching the orgasm is something more prevalent in fat woman , but we have no data showing that . 
  and i do n't know how he can claim that in the past they considered a woman orgasm as necessary when they almost did n't know that that was a thing . 
  i mean , doctors in the 1800 procured orgasms to woman to cure them from `` hysterism '' , and they did n't know that what they were doing were sexual pleasure . 
  please , do n't try it when you are drunk . 
  choking someone for sexual pleasure is always dangerous . 
  both partners have to be fully aware of what is going on and ready to recognize any sign of discomfort . 
  and the first time you have to start soft , which can be not that easy if you are intoxicated . 
  i 've never tried to chocke or being chocked by anyone , but i am a student of medicine and this stuff caught my attention some time ago . 
  to be honest choking someone is dangerous even if you do it in the most perfect way . 
  an artery in the neck can collapse due to the pressure , and that means big trouble . 
  i do n't know how it works in the usa , but usually this means that if a law openly contraddict an earlier law , it 's implicit that the old law is no longer valid , because the new one it 's considered more rappresentative of the people 's will . 
   no one wants to be known to taste shitty . 
  litterally . 
  with context it get worse . 
  it would n't be bad as in `` being a cripple '' or having a disease bad , but it would still not be the best outcome for the child . 
  long story short , your immune system has a random part that `` draws '' from what your parents passed to you . 
  if you have a lot of different part , you can create many different combination and so the possibility that one of them is the right one to fend off an infection is higher . 
  if your parents were relatives you have less variety to form combination , and thus less different combination can be formed . 
  conversely , here giving the check to you as soon as you finish eating is considered ** very rude ** . 
  and i mean * very , very * rude . 
  do you have sources about those statiscs on spousal abuse ? 
  i 'm genuinely curios about this topic !, 
  really ? 
  what the fuck was going on , why the guy on the left has those hair , why are they pantsless ... why ... 
  you know , a lot of people who were not very desiderabile for girl in high school ends up being perfectly desiderable in college . 
  attraction come from 2 things : how do you look and how do you make your partner * feel * . 
  when you are 15 or 16 years old you still have ** a lot ** of child tracts in your body . 
  you may not notice it now , but when you will be 20 you will look a group of 16 yo and say `` holy shit they look like baby '' . 
  this means that you are not anywhere near your physical peak . 
  your face will change and it will lose all those childish tracts . 
  then there is how do you make your partner feel . 
  but what does that mean ? 
  well , it means that you have to be able to hold a conversation , to propose fun things to do , to act confident ... and you knwo when you are able to do that ? 
  when the other person share most of your interests . 
  in high school you met people litterally randomly . 
  in college you met people that chose to be there because they like the same thing that made you chose to be there . 
  the mindset will be very similar for all of you ( yes , exceptions do exists . 
  but they are exceptions ) .
