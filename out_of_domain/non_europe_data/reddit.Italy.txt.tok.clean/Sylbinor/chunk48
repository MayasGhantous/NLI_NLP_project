  the problem is that the drug is not easy on your body , so unless the acne is really bad is better to avoid it . 
  the first rule is that society care a lot less than you immagine about faux pass . 
  this is the first step . 
  a guy is in the confessional . 
  father : son , tell me what you did . 
  man : a terrible thing father ... 
  terrible ... 
  i am an horrible man ... 
  i had sex with one of my customer ... 
  father : oh , i see , are you married ? 
  man : no father , i am no married ... 
  i am disgusting ... 
  father : easy now my son , so is she married ? 
  man : no , no , she is n't married i am sick , disgusting ... 
  father : why you are so hard on youeself ? 
  did you rape her ? 
  man : no father , no , what rape ... 
  i am worthless , disgusting ... 
  father : enough son !, 
  you slept with a customer , i ca n't understand why you think this is so terrible !, 
  man : father , i am a veterinarian !, 
  do you remember that scene in scrubs where jd has to say something to break up the tension between cox and jordan ? 
  in originale jd says `` banana hammock '' , but since there is not an equivalent word for that in italian , they decided to translate it as a completely random `` ammacca banane '' , which roughly translate as `` banana beater '' . 
  it 's completely random , but it works much better as a joke to hear jd spurting out something like '' banana beater '' in a serious situation . 
  usually faux pas means something from light to mild incovenience , not serious fucks up . 
  as you said , what you wrote are serious things . 
  my point was that nobody will change his/her opinion of you because you made a bad joke one day . 
  i do n't think it has much to do with how you translate it , but how you pronounce it . 
  `` hammock '' and `` ammacca '' both have an `` mm '' and an `` k '' sound , and they are in the same position . 
  if you try to say both words slowly , you would notice that you move your mouth in a peculiar way when you say that two sounds . 
  thus it would be a better lip sync for the dubbing . 
  i 'm not saying that nobody makes fun of anybody or think `` oh , awkward '' . 
  i 'm saying that they will forget about that very soon . 
  they will not think in a week from now , `` wow , sylbinor really was awkward with that girl today ! '' . 
  just to make things clear : i 'm not saying that someone judging you for a faux pass * never * happens . 
  i 'm saying that ** most of the time ** nobody * really * care . 
  they will forget about it . 
  the reason why brutus and cassius are there because caesar represented the roman empire , and dante was a strong supporter of a political faction that wanted the holy roman emperor as the only temporal power . 
  he was a supporter of the emperor , not of the pope , and was even exiled from florence when his faction lost . 
  brutus and cassius betryaing caesar rapresentend people betraying the holy roman emperor . 
  you absolutely need an annotated version . 
  dante wrote almost all the poem using metaphor , tongue in cheek citations and hints to this or that . 
  all stuff that in his time would be evident to a moderately erudite guy , but nowaday they are absolutely obscure . 
  as a fun note , dante 's `` italian '' can be very distant from the italian of today sometime . 
  we can still read it , but it 's not rare to have to stop and re-read what he wrote whit the help of annotations to really understand what he meant . 
  absolutely , the comedia is absolutely full of political propaganda , there are whole pages dedicated to metaphores for the holy roman empire and mocking of dante 's political adversaries . 
  but you do n't notice that without an annotated version . 
  more or less . 
  i am not an expert of shakespearen english to draw a comparision , but it seems that this is the case . 
  dante 's italian is about 60 % equal/very slightly different , 30 % `` i had to read it twice '' and 10 % `` wtf , i have to read the annotations to understand '' . 
  they are the size of a small dog . 
  the easiest solution of this paradox is that history can not be changed in a significant way . 
  the world is like it is now * because * an immortal meddled with it . 
  the things he changed have already happened , and we ended up here . 
  basically , you can change how you get there , but not the fact that you get there . 
  it has already happened . 
  if in 2034 i invent a time machine , go back in time and am the cause for a farmer losing his land in 1645 , nothing would change . 
  because it already happened in 1645 . 
  whatever butterfly effect that guy losing his land may have caused has already happened in ours day . 
  if ( and this is a big if ) we postulate that history can not be changed , there is no paradox . 
  i mean , if the universe is 100 % deterministic this would mean that every single interaction of energy that happened since the big bang is `` just '' an ongoing chain reaction that ** must ** go in a certain way . 
  every atom and sub-atomic particle was and is bound to collide in this and only this ways , and since we are big agglomerate of atoms our actions and thought are not really free , but the result of a chain of collision between energy that started at the big bang . 
  if this is true that means that the history of the universe is already written , even if it has n't happened yet . 
  you can not change that , even if you go back in time , because you going back in time was a side effect of that very first collision . 
  we are just speculating here , and there is no way at the moment to know if there is free will in the universe or not , but ... why it would be important if there is a point or not ? 
  for the universe it makes absolutely no sense if there is a point or not . 
  why that would happen ? 
  it 's a serious question , why it should happen ? 
  a lot of things could happen , but not all happens . 
  why this would be the one to happen ? 
  we are postulating a word were history can not be changed , if i have a face it means that that did not happen . 
  if the universe is completely predetermined , it simply happened that nobody did that . 
  that is the force that stopped `` me '' : the fact that it already happened . 
  i think you guys are missing the point of a completely determistic universe . 
  you are thinking about loops , but if the universe is predetermined there is no loop . 
  history has already ben written , it just did not happen yet . 
  that is a solution , but postulating the existence of multiple universes is way more complex than a predetermined universe . 
  it 's not really easy . 
  i do n't understand what you are asking exactly . 
  there would be a second you from the future around . 
  what is the problem with that ? 
  the you from the future would just appear the moment you chose , it does n't matter what your `` i '' of that precise moment is doing . 
  there would not be a `` first time '' where nobody appears , if it is what you are asking . 
  what could we change if it already happened ? 
  what is the difference between a person and a thing ? 
  why it breaks down ? 
  it depends . 
  if i already had kids when that happened i would be pissed , but not really that much ... 
  870k will not make you rich , but can easily assure that you will not have an economic problem in your life . 
  it 's not a bad deal , if you already had kids . 
  and before someone asks : prothesis for testicles do exist , so it 's not like you are going with a flap of skin under your penis for the rest of your life . 
  nobody would notice , maaaaybe at touch . 
  but if they can touch your testicles they are either a doctor or someone who is already really ok with your genitals . 
  is the therapy oral or they use an injection ? 
  if it is oral is really not an issue . 
  my thiroid does n't work well , so i will have to absorb a couple of hormones orally for the rest of my life ... 
  it 's literally a 5 second issue , you take the pill and you are done for the day . 
  and usually hormones replacement therapy permits you to skip a day without any ripercussion , if you just forget it ... 
  then if it would be an injection , that would be a problem ... 
  `` hormone replacement therapy '',
