i think he will appear because we saw his cocoon in guardians of the galaxy, 
  just my curiosity , what country are you from ? 
  latin brothers discuss, 
  i think satanism is a religion as many others and i do n't understand why people are outraged , they may say it celebrates evil , but i 'd like to remember that the cross was used for torture in the roman empire.by the way i 'm not criticizing , i 'm totally ok with it , but i hate this double standard, 
  i do n't think that 38 % of muslims in the usa are white, 
  well , over the citadel we see green spots with plants an trees , maybe there 's still some agriculture, 
  i do n't think this is possible because in many episodes they say that fairies lived for millennia , in fact i remember that once cosmo and wanda celebrated their 9875th ( or something like that ) anniversary, 
  ah , double standards, 
  i may be ignorant but i never understood the ontological argument , even while reading about it in `` the god delusion '' i was confused , can anyone explain it to me in a simple way ? 
  oh , so i understood it , it just does n't make sense, 
  i think it could be ok as a theory , but how do you explain the different races?north korea was quite homogeneous and i 'm sure it would kill all the non-korean people in the country , so assuming white people are korean , what about black people ? 
  ( i do n't remember if other races are included in the franchise ), 
  come on , it 's not that shitty, 
  i live in italy and as an italian i 've got to say that i never liked popes in general because their positions always influenced negatively ( in my opinion ) the italian policy on many issues such as abortion , lgbt rights , religion in public schools , drugs , prostitution and so on , but weirdly there is no debate about evolution in classes and politicians ( even the conservatives ) rarely talk about god ; maybe i 'm going off topic , but the point is that i wish the vatican and the point of view of the pope were less important for a secular country like italy , on the other hand i 'm seeing francis with his sort of liberal views , so i 'm still bothered but not at the level i was before, 
  of course not , for a very long time only religious people produced the thoughts and the inventions that made umanity what it is today, 
  actually ferrari is more something like `` ironer '' , smith would be `` fabbro '', 
  but they did n't recognize jesus as their savior and the son of god , so by christian standards i do n't think they would go to heaven, 
  thank you mate, 
  so what are the suitable religions in his opinion ? 
  well , i call cookies biscotti , but just because i 'm italian, 
  exactly , what the fuck !, 
  maybe , but as an italian i 've got to say that sometimes the titles have a really bad translation, 
  i think `` italy '' referred to that time period is more something cultural , in fact the first attempt to create an italian language was made between the end of the xiii century and the fisrt years of the xiv century with dante , boccaccio and petrarca , they proposed the florence dialect which then actually evolved in the modern form of italian.and btw romans had a concept of italy , in fact in the first years of the roman republic they called the populations living in the italian peninsula `` italici '' and with the empire the peninsula was a special province called `` italia '' , maybe we lost that in the middle ages but people living in italy were always close culturally, 
  who makes these maps ? 
  as an italian i do the same , but my strategy is to put an s at the end of every word, 
  well , only one in a nation of million ( s ? ), 
  would not appear in the charts anyway, 
  i do n't think so , istria and dalmatia where italian until relatively recent history, 
  i think it 's because of the immigrants , there are about 6 million immigrants in the country , and there is a region ( south tyrol ) where everybody speaks german, 
  ok , but i think that the mandatory education imposed in the second half of the xx century reduced the numbers of non-italian speakers ( outside of south tyrol ) , and today only a very small fraction of the very old population does n't speak italian, 
  i 'm a bit confused , does this help the project of catalan indipendence ? 
  pretty good, 
  are you italian?in italian mariavolavola means `` maria fly fly '', 
  it 's actually me, 
  same here, 
  really cool!thanks !, 
  awesome , thank you !, 
  this may be good but i do n't think that the croatian flag would change a lot from the current design , the `` tricolore '' is seen as very important symbol in italy , so if a union will happen the flag would n't be changed that much , and if they changhe it i 'm thinking about a redesign of the coat of arms , resulting in a mexican-ish flag, 
  as an italian i would n't mind a redesign like one of yours , and beyond that i 've always felt like dalmatia and istria should be italian , the only problem is that after wwii almost all the italian population in the regions emigrated to italy , so i fell like the slavic factor may be and obstacle , on the other hand the catholicism of the croats is a great start point . 
  anyway , i would really really love an union , and if the price for this is a new flag i 'd have no problem paying it, 
  an union would also be good for my city ladispoli , in fact we have a main street , viale italia , then all the streets perpendicular to the viale are called with the names of the major italian cities ( via roma , via venezia , via firenze ) , but because many streets were built during the fascist period we also have via fiume , city that now is in croatia , and as a geography nerd this always bothered me, 
  you are right , i think my extreme europeism infuenced my comments , the fact is that i think the eu should become a federal nation if its countries still want to `` guide '' the world economy with the us , just a few years ago countries like italy , france and the uk had really huge gdps , they still have but nations like brazil surpassed them , but my argument does n't apply only to europe , i would say the same for latin america , some african countries or even pacific island nations, 
  again , i would n't mind a redesign ( btw yours is awesome ) , but other italians would, 
  that 's not true , in italian we say `` tacchino '', 
  right wing lunatics that invaded other countries because of their fucked up ideas and principles.i have to say the flag fits, 
  i like it too , but he did n't use the current coa , in this versione we have the royal savoy emblem, 
  yes please!i live in the province of rome and i have to say that the flag of latium sucks , we need a redesign, 
  so you know the ongoing joke of molis n't, 
  if we 're talking about design , it sucks , if we 're talking about what it means , it still sucks, 
  thank you!it is much better than the current flag, 
  how orginal!no one has ever made this joke before, 
  are you calling every single country with its full name?i mean i do n't think you call north korea the `` democratic people 's republic of korea '' . everyone knows the fyrom with the name `` macedonia '' , so people just call it this way, 
  this is north-western mongolia , [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/flag_of_hungary.svg ) is western mongolia, 
  in my case a lot of people confuse austria with australia, 
  nah , estonia and finland are the same , estonia 's just like a bird chick who 's been touched by a human ( russia ) and now its mother ( finland ) does n't want to have anything to do with it, 
  i know , i just liked the concept of it and thought it would have been right for what i wanted to say, 
  as an italian i would actually prefer tartuficolo , it sounds adorable , and because the word patata is often used to talk about the famale genitalia it could be funny to change it to tartu ** fico ** lo ( `` fica '' also means pussy ), 
  molise and umbria have more land than usual, 
  like in the u.s. 
  exactly , let 's hope bernie sanders will change the situation, 
  sorry for the timing but i have to ask where did you find this version of the wallachian eagle ? 
  sorry , my source had different data, 
  ok , but how did the province of benevento suddenly come in into existence later ? 
  ( molis n't ), 
  i 'm sad to tell you that i do n't remember , i downloaded the pitcure months , if not years ago from a reddit post, 
  sorry , is n't the uk masculine ? 
  i mean , it is * il regno unito *, 
  there is a plural in the map , in fact the netherlands are called * paesi bassi * , which literally means * low countries * or * low towns * , so , being the world * paesi * masculine , * paesi bassi * is masculine, 
  some people say it is confusing and random that everything has a gender , but i do n't think so , you can see sort of a pattern , at least with the countries , in fact in central asia all the `` stan '' countries are masculine , in north and south america almost all the countries are masculine , in europe as you can see feminine is the predominant gender , so it is n't arbitrary , at least not completely , i think that knowing the lanugage can help you understand more about its features, 
  but great britain is n't the actual country, 
  i studied french for about three years , so if i remember plural nouns have a gender , but why are the netherlands just labeled as plural ? 
  should n't the shade of blue be darker ? 
  three quarters of the italian region flags are bad , in fact i hate the one used in lazio , my region , the only good ones in my opinion are lombardy , valle d'aosta , sardinia , sicily and piedmont, 
  it looks like the russian flag with the ukrainian one in the canton , but i ca n't explain the blue line in the top right corner, 
  where the hell is cervetrano !, 
  a popular word for cock in southern italy , especially in sicilly is `` minchia '' , which is weirdly feminine, 
  what was the name of the website where you compare the size of different countries ? 
  tai one, 
  it 's often impossible to translate puns into another language while keeping the `` punny '' aspect, 
  old but au, 
  in the roman dialect it could be `` viecce '' , although the meaning of this word can vary, 
  actually i do n't like the flag of the [ italian social republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_italian_flags#/media/file:war_flag_of_the_italian_social_republic.svg ) , but the kingdom of itaky , the third reich and the japanese empire have great designs, 
  how is this supposed to resolve the dispute ? 
  i mean , the turks want the land , right ? 
  in italian `` lotta meco '' is super archaic . 
  you may still hear it in some small village in tuscany , but in modern standard italian it would be `` lotta con me '' or `` battiti con me '', 
  or italian, 
  this is n't based on language right ? 
  is it all about ethinicity ? 
  funny how the basque word for son means seed in italian, 
  greetings from `` alsium '', 
  yes , i 'm from palo and i can confirm that the castle remains closed most of the year, 
  [ mine ] ( http://imgur.com/ubjobyy ) is pretty simple , i think you can figure out which countries are included, 
  well , the unicorn appears in coat of arms of the uk , so i guess it counts, 
  i still have to figure out what 's the point of the ablerta boundary, 
  i think southern and eastern europe are n't that accurate , in my opinion bosnia , albania and kosovo should be in the eastern europe cultural sphere , plus i do n't understand what you did with poland , slovakia and the czech republic , are n't they eastern european ? 
  did you go with the eu borders ? 
  if so why do hungary , romania and bulgaria are n't included ? 
  til finland had colonies, 
  actually it comes from the florentian dialect of the tuscan language,
