  [ like this ? 
  in my opinion there 's too much going on , simplify it a bit , maybe remove the buildings , in the future the skyline will probably look different and i think that a flag should try to be timeless, 
  i 'm working on some, 
  white and black represent brittany and cornwall , blue is one of the colours of scotland and it is also important in irish culture , in fact the previous flag of ireland featured one of the shades of saint patrick 's blue , with saint patrick being of course the patron saint of the island . 
  the triskelion symbolizes the isle of man and celtic culture as a whole . 
  the yellow colour of the triskelion and the balck of the top and bottom stripes are from the welsh cross of saint david, 
  thank you mate !, 
   not sang , only the first one is, 
  actually the first two are sang, 
  well , blue and white also represent galicia . 
  i thought about it when i designed the flag a couple of weeks ago , i just forgot to include it in the description , 
  what about spain , mongolia , canada , peru , argentina and many others ? 
  i made this flag for the rheto-romance languagues , three closely related languages spoken in switzerland and northern italy . 
  i chose the tricolour because there are three of these languages ( friulan , ladin and romansch ) , and beacuse the ladin flag is a horizontal tricolour . 
  the blue is the only colour that appears on all three the ladin flag , the friulan flag and the coat of arms of the graub\u00fcnden canton ( the only place where romansch is the official language ) , plus it represents the venice gulf and the rhine river , the two bodies of water that sort of function as the linguistic borders between this language subfamily and others . 
  white represents the alps and , it 's one of the two main colours ( the other being light blue ) of the trentino-altoadige flag , where ladin is spoken . 
  the golden yellow symbolizes the friulan eagle , the roman empire ( in fact these languages came from latin ) adn the republic of venice , which controlled veneto ( where ladin is spoken ) and friuli for centuries, 
  italy 's flag is the modern one too, 
  these flags are made to represent all the places where the italian language is spoken . 
  for the field i used two shades of savoy blue , in fact the savoy dynasty , kings of the kingdom of sardinia ( previously known as regnum sardiniae et corsicae in latin ) ruled italy from its unification until the constitution of the italian republic . 
  it was this family that united italy and popularized the national language , before the 1860 's nobody outside of florence ( except for writers and intellectuals ) spoke italian . 
  the white fleur de lis , or `` giglio '' in the middle symbolizes florence ( white is one of the city colours ) , in fact modern italian originated from the dialect spoken in this city of tuscany , it started to be the language used by most italian intellectuals after books and poetry made by florentian writers , such as dante alighieri , boccaccio and petrarca , began to spread across the small countries that once existed in the territory of modern italy . 
  in the corners we find symbols for each place where italian is an official language ( or spoken by a substantial majority ) : the swiss cross for the two swiss cantons where italian is the official language , the istrian goat for the italophone communities of slovenia and croatia , the san marino tower for the republic with the same name , and either the maltese cross ( where italian is n't official but two thirds of the population can speak it ) or the vatican coat of arms ( i did n't include it in a few versions because less than 1000 people live in the country ) . 
  the symbols are sort of placed according to the georgaphical position of the places they represent . 
  i did n't include albania because although almost three fourths of the population speaks italian , unlike malta , it is spoken just becuase of italian imperialism , in malta there even was during the 20th century a group of people that wanted to join the kingdom of italy because of the strong cultural ties the archipelago has with italy . 
  i actually took it from [ wikipedia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/fleur_de_lis_of_florence.svg/2000px-fleur_de_lis_of_florence.svg.png ) , i just changed the height-width ratio a bit, 
  i think you succeeded , it 's okay i guess, 
  technically the german flag itself represents northern germany ( red ) and southern germany ( gold and black ) , so maybe red is for low german and gold and black are for high german, 
  mordovia sounds like moldova said by a japanese, 
  fun fact : the city of tolyatti that you can see south of tatarstan was named after palmiro togliatti , leader of the italian communist party, 
  in 1996 they even had a referendum to go back to the previous name but 82 % of the people chose to keep tolyatti, 
  i see your point , in fact i think it is too ambitious to represent each west germanic language with one symbol each , as you said he should find one symbol that has some meaning for more languages, 
  i decided to do a bicolour flag for the anglosphere . 
  it was sort of inspired by [ the flag submitted by sodiumthiosulfate ] ( http://imgur.com/xmcm3qq ), 
  yottaphy is right , the symbol in the middle is a triskelion to represent ireland and the celtic nations within the uk , i felt it was n't fair to use saint george 's cross for the whole uk, 
  exactly , the symbol in the middle is a triskelion , i would n't have put another symbol for new zealand , in fact i think that four ferns a\u00f2ready occupy too much space for their purpose to represent a relatively small population , but i put them to have a symmetric flag, 
  was n't it dissolved in 2012 ? 
  moldova does n't speak a romance language , albanian and the north germanic languages are apparently slavic , the whole belgium speaks french , dutch does n't exist and in kaliningrad they speak lithuanian, 
  it means slavic scandinavian languages, 
  who uses a word derived from `` volcae '' for italy ? 
  and dutch is n't included at all , `` tedesco '' means german, 
  that 's what i said , in this map though in moldova they speak a slavic language and in the netherlands there is n't dutch , they all speak `` tedesco '' , which means german, 
  thank you, 
  [ there 's also this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ladin_people ), 
  why did you use the symbol of the cpusa if the flag is for britain ? 
  [ well , you asked for suggestions ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/nordic_cross_flags ), 
  you also missed the easternmost part of india , an island in southern china and quite many russian and alaskan ( not sure if it is the right adjective for something from alaska ) islands, 
  not only the aleutian islands , for alaska he also missed the islands in the south of the state, 
  well , the same colours have different meanings for different cultural backgrounds , for example in the russian flag red is for the ussr , white is for the snow that covers the country for 364 days per year and blue is for the smurfs , in fact the * amanita muscaria * , the typical smurfy mushroom , grows mainly in siberia, 
  you have northern australia , taiwan , singapore , northern south africa , southern florida and southern texas, 
  one thing i never understood , why the hell when the city of leningrad changed its name back to saint petersburg did this oblast keep the name leningrad ? 
  saint george 's cross is for english , saint andrew 's saltire is for scots , the orange in the top part is fo dutch while the one in the bottom is for afrikaans , then there are two german flags for both high and low german ( in fact the colours of the flag itself represent the nothern and southern regions of the country ) , the seeblatts are for frisian and the star of david is for yiddish,

  i sadly read it at school , in italy you have to study one book ( inferno , purgatorio and paradiso ) each of the last three years of high school , and i 'm with you , boring and repetitive, 
  i went there last weekend , i was in campania for the naples comicon and i decided to visit salerno , it was very nice and i noticed that a lot of people in salerno and naples instead of showing the italian or city flag on the balcony they usually have [ the flag of the kingdom of two sicilies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_the_two_sicilies#/media/file:flag_of_the_kingdom_of_the_two_sicilies_%281816%29.svg ), 
  bullshit , i live in rome and it almost never works, 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/3jteha/my_attempt_at_making_a_panlatin_flag/ ), 
  what the hell sweden, 
  there is a chilean city i think and most scientists that go to antarctica are white, 
  why does germany have a [ valknut ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valknut#/media/file:valknut-symbol-triquetra.svg ) in its logo ? 
  immigrants, 
  i genuinely red val d'arno and the design fitted my first misreading , in fact this is also the pisa cross, 
  and its skin got lighter, 
  is france just sideways yugoslavia with a hammer and sickle ? 
  yup , i agree , as an italian i hate how most of our flags suck and my home region of lazio is among the worst, 
  why is having large balls negative ? 
  is the animal ( beaver ? ), 
  taken from a totem made by native canadians or something like that ? 
  no italian fascism ? 
  i 'm disappointed :(, 
  i think alaska is so big because of the rest of the usa , not because it produces many papers , i think the map refers to countries as a whole . 
  i know , it 's sort of bullcrap , there are at least 56 distinct ethnic groups in china, 
  exactly , in 2013 i think moldovan was recognized as a dialect of romanian, 
  in fact i do n't , i just found that out and i think it 's an odd thing to do, 
  that 's a nice font, 
  why the hell is n't italy a member !? 
  in the region of valle d'aosta they basically only speak french and franco-provencal , i think it makes more sense for italy to be a member than any of the countries you mentioned, 
  the island is triangle shaped , sort of, 
  the island is triangle shaped , sort of, 
  why is the romania-moldova border not as dark as the others ? 
  it can bearely be seen , i 'm not complaining , i 'm a unionist after all, 
  it 's more like central italy, 
  so the only uninhabitated places in the world are antarctica , a couple of islands in the artctic and northern greenland ? 
  it does n't seem accurate, 
  i think that the fascists were great at designing stuff , maybe they stole a couple of ideas from other cultures , but i really like their ** designs **, 
  yeah , i find it very interesting, 
  wow , they already used modern italian in the late 18th century lombardy ? 
  yes, 
  i love how they put independent after moldovan, 
  someone knows why a lot of cities in northern italy started using a red cross with a white field ? 
  all fans of genua ? 
  [ aang died when he was biologically 66 and chronologically 166 ] ( http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/aang ) and [ kyoshi died when she was 230 ] ( http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/kyoshi ), 
  ok , but what about the statues ? 
  they say `` make me young '' before they die ? 
  wow , it 's like the logo of a cheap ice cream brand from eastern europe, 
  excuse my ignorance but , what 's the joke ? 
  for once someone thinks positive things about italy, 
  the baltics are satanic, 
  why sare some countries split in different constituencies while the most populated country in the eu only forms one ? 
  glad to know that sardinia , sicily and elba seceeded from italy,
