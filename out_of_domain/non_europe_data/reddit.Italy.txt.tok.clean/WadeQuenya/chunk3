  i do n't know , it just feels eastern european to me ( and as you can see by my flair i 'm partially romanian ), 
  i knew it , those leghisti are quick, 
  why is n't romania coloured ? 
  if you marked israel i think romania should have been there too, 
  are these just the colours of the romanian and hungarian flags or do they mean something else ? 
  estonia is trying to be nordic, 
  well , israel too , i do n't want to get into religious arguments but to be fair we are not sure that jacob existed and you marked israel red anyway , so we either consider both real and possibly fictional people like romulus or we just go for people we know existed, 
  it 's the devil 's music, 
  ( according to morons ), 
  you are not the first one that did so, 
  liguria is much less religious than what is shown here, 
  it seems more like a flag for french greeks, 
  i never understood why rieti became a province of lazio , why did n't it stay in umbria ? 
  the black field represents the black iron sand that my city is famous for in the north of the italian region lazio , the two light blue lines are for the two small rivers that pass through the city , the vaccina and sanguinara rivers , and finally the tower in the middle represents torre flavia , the symbol of ladispoli , it 's red because red is the main colour of the orsini and odescalchi families , the two nobil families that played the biggest role in the history of ladispoli , plus it 's red becaues the tower on the current coat of arms is red as well, 
  why rieti though ? 
  it 's the least populous province in central italy , why not grosseto or l'aquila ? 
  they have more people and they are richer, 
  i finally accomplished something in my life, 
  i guess you 're right, 
  actually on google.it the isis flag is the first result , but i 'm still proud of myself , when non italians google ladispoli flag mine is going to proudly stand as first, 
  rome was n't the capital when the first tricolour was adopted, 
  [ it has already been posted btw ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/30ohux/flag_of_italy_if_it_was_made_the_same_way_as_flag/ ), 
  i 'm sad it was n't successful in romania , it 's hard to be an atheist with romanian parents , and even though i live in italy and there nobody cares , when i visit romania ( my parents come from a small village with about 600 people ) all my relatives insist on returning to the christian faith all the freaking time and they often start arguments , but luckly my young cousins do n't even care and the only month that i spend there is n't that bad if i do n't stay too much around my grandparents and aunts or uncles, 
  i always found weird that no hungarian prime minister was born in hargita or covasna, 
  weird how far east the jewish autonomous oblast was placed , i guess they wanted to give the jews a godforsaken piece of land, 
  or reverse st. david cross, 
  it 's funny because in italian the word for potato ( patata ) is slang for vagina, 
  no way italy is that high, 
  does n't the map mark italy as 90-100 % ? 
  because with all the immigrants from muslim countries ( and even china and india ) , plus about 10 % ( but i actually believe there are more ) atheists and agnostics the percentage ca n't be higher than 85 % ( and i actually think it is about 75 % ), 
  i was there too like three days ago, 
  italy seems black, 
  same for me and my sister , my father and my cousin , i 'm called alessandro , my sister alessia , my father valentin and my cousin valentina , so me and my sister are both called `` ale '' for short and my father and my cousin are both `` vale '' , when screamed they are often confused, 
  you should n't have pointed that out , now everyone knows christopher walken 's reddit username, 
  a cooler filled with pepsi max , a $ 2 bill , putin 's tears , a goat 's penis and a copy of the necronomicon, 
  no , according to the map romania has less than 25 %, 
   public trans, 
  flowers have more to do with spring if you ask me, 
  south ossetia ? 
  i 've always wondered why none of them was born in hargita or covasna, 
  when was this made ? 
  i think italy could be green now , we finally passed the civil unions law, 
  about 30 % of the country is vegetarian, 
  none born in switzerland or south tyrol and only one in austria ? 
  that surprises me, 
  i think that red in this amount feels way too communist, 
  i do n't know if this is true but a muslim friend told me that according to the quran only anal sex is forbidden, 
  i think both the israelis and the palestians have done awful things to each other but overall i side with the palestinians , the creation of israel could have been handled in a much better way, 
  fun fact : in italian the word for potato ( patata ) is slang for vagina, 
  but does it also mean something other than vagina ? 
  actually italy did n't exist yet, 
  i always wondered why the `` ly '' from tolyatti was put instead of the `` gli '' , is it just to fit better the russian pronunciation ? 
  because i think that if you wanted to honour a foreign communist leader you should write his name as it was ( btw i know it might seem that i 'm saying this just because i 'm italian but that 's not the reason ), 
  we all know that yugoslavia was just greater serbia, 
  oh those eastern europeans, 
  for the last years italy had a center-left government, 
  the city was named after the italian communist leader palmiro togliatti, 
  ehm , where 's italy ? 
  i really love the old flag of portugal, 
  you forgot gli and gn, 
  cuba 's flag is so weird in this map, 
  grey is n't 100 %, 
  in italian the acronym is ggg : `` grande gigante gentile '', 
  tunisia , the outcast of africa, 
  resolution is n't the best but great work , i live in italy, 
  they 're not interested in the other kingdoms , they just want to pass through them to get to dorne, 
  the italian parliament has decided to discuss about the legalization of marijuana, 
  braavos looks very nice here, 
  in twoiaf it 's stated that in qohor there are still smiths that know how to forge valyrian steel, 
  i guess the italian translation is n't so accurate, 
  it 's the same for me as an italian for lorenzo richelmy and pierfrancesco favino in marco polo , even though the characters they play are actually italians netflix could have just decided to pick american or british actors , i really loved this decision, 
  they have the vale 's help and it is the most fertile land in westeros after the reach, 
  valyrian steel like dragon glass has a connection with dragons , they did n't make it on purpose, 
  well , sweden was more populated than the other two , so maybe this is a factor, 
  how moldovan, 
  the lithuanian commowealth is strong, 
  pod, 
  i 'm italian dude, 
  just being jon snow is so negative ? 
  in twoiaf it 's stated that in qohor they know how to reforge valyrian steel, 
  the italian constitution makes it impossible for the country to have a referendum about international treaties, 
  they took `` red sea '' literally, 
  and ... on amazon italy it 's 40 $, 
  the flying spaghetti monster manifested himself through house greyjoy , the kraken 's tentacles are infact the noodly appendages of the one true god, 
  i love the film but there is a mistake , in the shop of the airplane repairer there 's written `` non si fo credito '' , however the correct italian is `` non si fa credito '' , which means something along the lines of `` we do not lend money ( to the clients ) '', 
  ocd italians like me, 
  and hungary is upside down, 
  cough cough rightful italian soil cough cough, 
  what the hell is up with svalbard, 
  the dawn age, 
  watch the show so when you 'll read about dorne you will love it , if you read the books first you 'll hate what they did in the show for the southernmost region of the seven kingdoms, 
  i 'm so proud of italy right now, 
  hodor, 
  hodor, 
  hodor, 
  hodor, 
  fuck the show hodor 's not here, 
  hodor, 
  and the gospel of the flying spaghetti monster, 
  well , companies are greedy everywhere,
