  `` was '', 
  the vodka that makes you come back from the dead, 
  i would have thought italy was under a bigger threat , after all it contains the mecca of christianity ( i know the vatican is n't technically in italy but i think my point is clear ), 
  i completely agree, 
  there is some common vocabulary but the language itself is n't very similar if we speak of phonology and overall grammar , obviously it 's closer to french than it is to japanese but french and romanian are quite different, 
  the same is mosca in italian, 
  that also happened in china, 
  mordovia sounds like moldova said by a japanese, 
  lonely singapore is far from its friends, 
  [ ftfy ] ( https://ukipvoices.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/ukip-flag.jpg ), 
  northern gerrmans love their sucker, 
  i do n't see that happening because of the too many russians living in the republics and plus , there was a russian state to join for crimea , there is n't a tatar or chuvash state to join for these countries and even if there was being surrounded by your former country is n't the best imo, 
  in italy that already happens without taxes , sadly, 
  the english would never accept a flag with french on it, 
  season 1 : hodor, 
  season 2 : hodor, 
  season 3 : hodor, 
  season 4 : hodor, 
  season 5 : not hodor, 
  season 6 : hodor :(, 
  i think `` profit '' was intentional, 
  awesome , thank you, 
  really meh , i understand why they went for the weird shape now, 
  in italy the parliament is discussing about the legalization of cannabis but i personally do n't think they will make the law pass, 
  wait , the common tongue comes from the first men 's or the andals ' language ? 
  hodor hodor hodor ? 
  thanks for clearing that up, 
  i still do n't get why at the end bucovina went to ukraine and transnistria to moldova, 
  i thought the same my romanian mate, 
  well the alternative that tommen chose requires septons and i do n't think a septon would do that or cersei would even let them decide anything after the `` shamewalk '' and everything else that the faith did to her, 
  actually i 'm half italian half romanian so you 're my mate anyway , 
  ( only italian fans will understand ), 
  in italy usually twice, 
  but it has to be a 1:1 replica , 700 feet or nothing, 
  nope , he will shave his hair and his beard so melsiandre wo n't be able to resurrect him, 
  in italian it was horrible , we ended up with `` trova il modo '' , which means `` find the way '' , but i watch the show in english so i avoided it, 
  i 'm quite confident that nobody has steam in the vatican, 
  not really , in yemen at least 8 years old ca n't get fucked , in saudi arabia even 6 year olds , or younger for that matter , can, 
  i am romanian and i 'm 1.90 m and my dutch friend is 1.60 m , we are the exception, 
  fun fact : sabato means saturday in italian, 
  oh romania , the most religious country in europe , i wonder , why romanian communism did n't succeed like the russian in the matter of discouraging religion ? 
  i mean , in russia there are a lot of religious people , but there are also many non believers . 
  or maybe in romania there was n't a push to stop believing ? 
  wow , is manhattan really so much more populateted than the other boroughs ? 
  or are people living in other parts of nyc less interested in politics ? 
  i always forget his name and this time reading your comment i thought you meant the flags that were made a few months ago in the event of a roman colonization of the other planets of the solar system . 
  i 'm dumb i know, 
  and the crownlands should be annexed by the riverlands and the stormlands ? 
  i disagree , he comes from tyrosh ( if the tinfoils are n't right and he 's not euron greyjoy as the show may have proven ) , in tyrosh dye is a central part of the tradition , it 's thanks to the coloured dye that the city became an economic power so i do n't like what they did, 
  we need the blue hair and the yellow mustache , he comes from tyrosh ( if the tinfoils are n't right and he 's not euron greyjoy as the show may have proven ) dying your hair and facial hair is essential in the tyroshi tradition , it 's because of the commerce of dye that the city grew to become the economic power it 's now, 
  a poll made in 2012 found that 13 % of russia was atheist and 25 % was spiritual but not religion , so it 's true that most people are religious but 40 % of them are not and it 's a pretty big number, 
  i 'm talking about real countries, 
  isn ` it it just monopolar ? 
  i find it weirdly orthodox, 
  well , he 's missing a sperm, 
  i earn as much money as the president of bolivia , neat, 
  dani liz is my fav, 
  at least you have a job :(, 
  shame, 
  well , during the cold war you cared about who would have won elections in other countries and your secret services set up elections in various nations , just saying, 
  i think , i 'm not sure , that the eu flag is inspired by the betsy ross flag , so if that was true the eu flag would already be americanized in a way . 
  btw i 'm not criticizing your flags , they 're very cool, 
  it makes sense that argentina and croatia have a lot of people learning italian , but why montenegro ? 
  the us , austria and norway have quite a lot of immigrants it seems, 
  iirc their dialect is similar to the ones spoken in romagna , so if you want to make a romagnolo feel at home , san marinese is the way, 
  as an italian i went to romania to see a dentist , it costed 50 lei ( about 11 $ ) for something that in italy would have costed me 80 $ and i paid the airplain tickets 19 $ , plus i stayed with a friend of mine so i did n't have to pay an hotel and we visited the whole transilvania . 
  basically going on an amazing trip in eastern europe is cheaper than going to the dentist 200m from my house, 
  italians also go to romania , but mainly croatia, 
  we should be always careful , those turkmen agents are everywhere, 
  you should come to italy to hear the most amazing pronunciations , i heard tivin , tyson and chercei lannister , edward stark , maester peechelle and do n't let me start on quaithe, 
  i think that their army will have a few issues with winter in the south but she will eventually conquer the stormlands , the crownlands , the riverlands and even the westerlands , i also think that she will be greedy and try to conquer the vale and the north thus repeating napoleon 's and hitler 's error of understimating winter, 
  i can totally see nikolaj coster-waldau as a 90 's tv or movie star, 
  rickon : the useless wolf, 
  after winnig the world cup in 2006 we were satisfied and we just stopped every activity,

  i think [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pddkmx0pw7s ) is a better explanation,

  i do n't think this flag would be that good for unity , i mean , thery 're differenciating between one group and the other , it 's better to just use the already pancanadian symbol of the maple leaf that btw was first adopted in quebec, 
  wait , red , yellow , orange , white , grey , black and ? 
  well , it included piedmont back then, 
  seems legit, 
  i wish it was a joke, 
  i know , it 's too good , the day i found him i watched at least 20 of his videos, 
  i feel like it should be higher in 2011 , i live near rome and since 2009 only a third of the coins i use/see are italian , they 're mostly german or french, 
  molis n't, 
  the capital-rest of the country divide in eastern europe is astonishing, 
  it 's mostly due to organized criminality and the fact that when the country was unified the unifiers were northeners and they used all the money and the resources in the south to rebuild after the war , that is also the reason why if you see an italian company acting outside of italy it 's from probably from the north or , maybe but less likely , from the center, 
  alaska surprised me , with palin being elected i thought that the state was very religious because of the average republican, 
  basilicata will rise !, 
  i do n't think that molise and abruzzo are that developed, 
  italian church attendance is about 30 % , i live near rome and i do n't know anyone who goes to church that is younger than 40, 
  they 're definetly more yellow than they are green, 
  sardinia is wrong , they speak corsican in the north, 
  can you make me some examples of these words ? 
  man , the north south divide in italy, 
  wow , tokyo is astonishing compared to what it is now, 
  iirc it 's a traditional tent thing, 
  there would be more if only avram iancu ... 
  i bet they 're happy they got norn iron, 
  the indian subcontinent is sad,
