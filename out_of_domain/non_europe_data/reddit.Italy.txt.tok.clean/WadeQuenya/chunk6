  how progressive poland, 
  so , fascism in italy had no problem with homosexuality ? 
  i 'm going to be the edgy guy who says religion, 
  i had the same experience, 
  federal cities feel so special that they have to differ from the other states, 
  they are not gdp based , spain has a lower gdp than italy, 
  it 's iceland with two weird salitres, 
  why would it be illegal ? 
  if you said that you would be considered an idiot anyway, 
  what about [ south tyrol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_tyrol ) ? 
  the eight pointed star is a distinctive azeri symbol , why would ( i 'm guessing ) northern cyprus have it to represent itself ? 
  he has the most spanish sounding name i have ever heard, 
  why does greenland have so `` many '' males ? 
  too similar to greenland, 
  i 'm glad that there is no party from the european national front or the alliance for peace and freedom, 
  mic drop, 
  that blue on green is n't really good to the eye, 
  [ calm down , i have the answer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flags_of_the_ottoman_empire#/media/file:flag_of_the_ottoman_empire.svg ), 
  pizzigano will always win for me, 
  iirc tommen fired him, 
  catalan , sardinian , occitan , aromanian , corsican , friulan , neapolitan , arpitan , sicilian , venetian , ladin , galician , leonese , aragonese and many more, 
  is iceland light blue just because it 's considered neither in europe nor in north america by some ? 
  and trentino was n't that german or ladin, 
  wow , italy has its special statute regions marked , great job, 
  i do n't know about russian and ukrainian but this is definetly the case for romanian and moldovan, 
  the fascist have awesome designs, 
  the prefix `` trans '' usually means on the other side as we can see from the words transatlantic , transcontinental and even transylvania ( latin : beyond the forest ) , but then we have transgender meaning of the opposite , of another gender . 
  so the way they used it in the map is n't totally wrong but intercontinental would have been better in my opinion, 
  wait , what 's the matter with greece ? 
  no , i love the nazi flag , the iron guard flag , the national revival of poland flag , the golden dawn flag , the british fascist flag , the italians disappointed me though , we inveted fascism but forza nuova and casapound have horrible flags, 
  [ ftfy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_quebec#/media/file:flag_of_quebec.svg ), 
  bvt almighty roma can, 
  maybe you mean moldovan , but the map is in russian and romanian because neither moldavian nor moldovan are languages, 
  g'day mate , ich am osterstraya, 
  you ca n't say that just because it was written in another alphabet it 's another language, 
  you can call an avocado christopher nolan , it 's still an avocado, 
  i always tell them, 
  saying that italy is in the balkans is a bold move, 
  i never understood what 's the deal with aromanian, 
  but gopniks have to learn it, 
  the good old trst, 
  the orange may also symbolize the dutch heritage, 
  ash was a moron , he left charizard, 
   almost, 
  actually it 's more like cootsit, 
  i think it would become a blue state after this, 
  people from darmstadt have an element for their city , one for their state , one for their country and one for their continent, 
  it would be interesting , but i lack the skills, 
  not for the congolese, 
  yugoslavia left its mark, 
  romansh is the global language of the future, 
  maybe we are trying to justify the fact that we have to learn it at school for at least 3 years ( some schools offer spanish instead of french but most of them do n't plus there is the mentality of `` italian and spanish are basically the same '' that makes a lot of people think it 's useless to learn spanish ), 
  the flemish will never say french is useful, 
  lazio , maybe in the special statute regions is different or maybe i 'm just ignorant, 
  edit : according to [ this website ] ( http://www.insegnareonline.com/istanze/interlinguismo/insegnamento-ls-scuola-italia ) about 3/4 of middle school students study french and only 8.7 % study german , and i think those 8.7 % come from northern regions close to austria, 
  now that you make me think about it i would have loved learning german instead of french, 
  iceland , hispaniola and italy look really really bad, 
  what ? 
  why is n't vatican city included ? 
  the vatican museums are more visited than a lot of the museums that appear on the map, 
  it 's because bucharest is counted as its own district , but if you took individual transylvanian cities they woulnd ' t appear as poor, 
  calling polels slavs is derogatory ? 
  if someone called me latin i would n't get offended, 
  it says it was last updated on march 2007, 
  wait , which one of the part ... oh , right, 
  which of these has the largest percentage of people in the respective country ? 
  it 's the same in italian with marmellata and confettura, 
  alphabet, 
  he got to greenland and asked all the 17 people that live there, 
  the good old times when rieti was in umbria, 
  where do you live ? 
  i 'm just curious , if you live in a place but you do n't know the language it means that most people there speak english or some other language that you speak , so i was just wondering what place it is, 
  are you new to the sub ? 
  so it 's finalnd , i might understand why you have n't learned finnish . 
  estonian , finnish and hungarian , being not indoeuropean , are much harder for other europeans , i tried to learn a bit of hungarian when i lived for a few months in cs\u00edkszereda but it was too complicated, 
  seeing the thumbnail i thought it was the upside down ddr flag, 
  at least your school has wifi, 
  same in italian, 
  it 's certainly better than [ this ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/bandiera_della_liguria#/media/file:flag_of_liguria.svg ), 
  come on , sudan doens ' t deserve this, 
  in italy we use the word `` statiunitense '' , but i guess `` unitedstatian '' does n't sound as good, 
  soon ... 
  it 's basically south ossetia, 
  i went to naples and i saw this flag a lot hanging from balconies, 
  ww1 satirical maps are interesting for me, 
  they declared independece from ukraine, 
  italy is sal\u00f2 , right ? 
  `` finland is a japanese invention '' is amazing, 
  i 've just said what they did , i 'm not recognizing their legitimacy, 
  i knew about it , i was just amazed by the fact that it 's the most searched thing about finland, 
  basically austria with weird proportions and a coat of arms, 
  got bleached a bit, 
  wait , you use ciabatta in english too ? 
  i thought it was only used in italian, 
  to be fair intellectuals throughout the peninsula ( and even in sicily ) used tuscan since the middle ages, 
  what about nepal and bhutan ? 
  russia has six of them , crazy, 
  * romania mare intesifies *, 
  how is it possible , green squiggly \u2122 is one of the greatest american companies, 
  new mexico 's still deserving its name,
