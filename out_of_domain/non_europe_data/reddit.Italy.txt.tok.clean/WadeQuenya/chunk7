  no novi, 
  well , the middle ages came before the renaissance , the first example that comes to my mind is frederick ii 's [ sicilian school ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicilian_school ), 
  yes it was but they also used tuscan, 
  i live in ladispoli , italy , a city with about 40,000 people and i only know two people who go to church every week, 
  nice sideways yemen, 
  nah , he really captured the style of liberian county flags, 
  yeah , because all countries are based on ethnicity, 
  this makes me sort of proud on my italian side , but very ashamed on the romanian one, 
  it 's muslim antiamerica, 
  italian regional flags are awful , i live in lazio and our flag is possibly the worst in europe . 
  there are very good flags like piedmont and sardinia , but the pthers mostly suck, 
  i guess it would n't change anything for speakers of some romance languages such as us ( in fact it 's terra in italian too ), 
  i love how italy and france are on their own, 
  totally unrelated , a car from covasna killed my dog , i 'm sad, 
  come on two sicilies, 
  well , ireland had the uk, 
  for italy this is basically a `` non-old population map '' , i live close to rome in quite a small town and i do n't know anyone who does n't use the internet at least daily besides my grandma and other old people, 
  at least portugal has lisbon, 
  salaj is ruining the nice transylvania outline, 
  is n't that every city in norway ? 
  you know , crazy american republicans who point at scandinavia as this socialist-communist distopia where they share condoms and eat reindeers, 
  right , every country has its own bielefeld, 
  this was in middle school , one muslim boy bought pure alcohol . 
  he drank it and bit off the ear of a girl , than fainted and went to the hospital . 
  after that he did n't come to school for a week and he later told me that his father made him pray all day for five days for his sin, 
  yeah , i just find the `` transylvania , moldova , wallachia and maybe dobruja '' model simpler , i know there are crisana , banat , muntenia , oltenia , maramures , bukovina and some other region i 'm forgetting , but the point is , i forget 'em, 
  you gave me an idea ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  why ? 
  no one thought about elba, 
  to be fair most slavic words have a latin counterpart , usually much less widespread, 
  but nizza will soon join italia , for garibaldi !, 
  maybe you use the italian pronunciation because finland was with the axis powers during wwii, 
  well , nizza is also the german spelling , so maybe , but again you 're right , it feels too recent, 
  belgium is really real , finland however ... 
  it was created by the russians and the japanese for fishing laws avoidance, 
  i mean , germany as we know it today began in the 19th century, 
  few but good, 
  you could say the same about italy , from the fall of the roman empire to 1861 it was just a ton of duchies , city states , kingdoms and pope owned lands, 
  it seems like the italian heritage of argentina influenced something, 
  this reminds me of my romanian father who voted salvini in the italian elections, 
  apparently kaliningrad has seceded from russia, 
  yeah , but italy is the only serious rival of france on the world stage, 
  molise , like many italian regions , has an awful [ flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/flag_of_molise.svg/1280px-flag_of_molise.svg.png ) , so i wanted to work on the existing symbols to create a more visually appealing one, 
  it 's basically mali, 
  is this a request ? 
  you 're right , but finland has a flag , so it seems fair that other imaginary places can have flags, 
  thanks !, 
  [ forbes ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/karlsson/2015/02/16/france-is-the-biggest-wine-producer-in-2014-but-less-wine-is-made-and-drunk-in-europe/#4a27daf327e4 ) and [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wine-producing_countries ) think otherwise, 
  you may be right , but in italy roma are such a small minority compared to romania that for him to vote on the basis of that would just be dumb, 
  * italy is mostly pro-life ? 
  fuck them , we 're not like those savages *, 
  it 's not a white shark , it 's a carcharodon carcharias, 
  i did n't hate on pro-life though , i was just making a joke about people from valle d'aosta wanting to differenciate themselves from the rest of italy because they feel more french than italian, 
  the current flag without the seal, 
  i do n't think there really is a `` european style '' , this flag has a prussian vibe if you ask me, 
  pal , it 's clearly palinka, 
  in sardinia there is a town called olbia too, 
  i think it 's more distracting and that 's why many countries dub movies , the audience is lazy, 
  levant is srtong, 
  could you explain the design choices ? 
  why is nobody complaining about the flag of wyoming ? 
  it has the same shape of the state , how hypocritical / s, 
  why is the flair `` current '' ? 
  maybe gold because it was one of the colours of the roman empire and it is featured in the spanish , the catalan and ( sort of ) the romanian flag , while the fleur de lis could symbolize france and florence ( in fact the italian language evolved from the florentian dialect ) . 
  this way portugal does n't get much attention though, 
  i would argue it 's quite easy for a romanian speaker to read catalan , but maybe is because i also speak italian, 
  i 'm sure this got commented thousands of times , but do you mean either sun or moon or both sun and moon ? 
  how much is the time i 'll have to wait for my copy ? 
  i live in italy, 
  i do n't know if trump could win both ohio and florida, 
  meters mate , the supreme unit of measurement, 
  i wish there were more flags like this one, 
  man , i hope this will go on for quite a while, 
  it feels way too albanian if you ask me, 
  i think it perfectly captures the caribbean vibe, 
  often when i tell non-italian speakers that ferrari means smith they do n't believe me or they are really astonished , i guess driving a smith car does n't sound very cool, 
  many hungarians are wondering the same about many regions lost with the trianon, 
  wine vs vodka vs beer, 
  i think a lot of people ( mainly outside of europe or in `` western europe '' ) still have a vision of europe as east and west , plus maybe they added them to have more countries in the map, 
  i always thought that `` island '' and the latin word for isolate ( in italian it 's isolare ) came from the same root, 
  i would say moldova is very very complicated, 
  or `` stateves zittos testes des cazzos '' , it works this way right ? 
  you add an `` s '' at the end of italian words and you have a correct spanish sentence , or has my life been a complete lie ? 
  of course it makes sense but most people do n't even think about the connection between ferrous and ferrari, 
  not really monolithic because of that italian and ladin speakers in the south , but still , you 're mostly right . 
  the point is that they 're not the only ones , this happens a lot , look at the hungarian lands lost with the trianon , the whole mess in the balkans , the german speakers in belgium , galician speakers which are basically portuguese speakers and the russians in many parts of the former soviet republics . 
  it 's not that easy, 
  probably yes seeing portuguese , but i do n't speak spanish, 
  it 's based on [ the coat of arms of north dakota ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_north_dakota ), 
  they 're not sardinian, 
  how dare you . 
  no one 's laughing at umbria now, 
  not surprised that fattiehead is in scotland / s, 
  being in bucharest during the 1989 revolution, 
  hungarian california ? 
  to be fair that canton has only about 15 % of people that speak romansh as a first language, 
  white cross is the one true flag, 
  it 's the rebel flag from the hello internet podcast, 
  i certainly did and i do n't know how anyone could vote for club & claws, 
  come ti permetti lurido infedele ?
