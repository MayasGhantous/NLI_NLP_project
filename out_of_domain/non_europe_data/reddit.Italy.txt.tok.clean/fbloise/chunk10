  it worked for me , i recommended lumia to two of my work colleagues so i was lucky to get # 100 . 
  ** one thing : ** you can spend this virtually anywhere : phone app store , windows pc app store or even xbox marketplace . 
  i spend # 40 worth of games and paid using this sweet microsoft account credit !, 
  only software store ( anything digital based ) . 
  unfortunately does n't work in the hardware store . 
  source : a colleague of mine tried to buy a microsoft band but the hardware store only took credit/debit cards , the shopping cart never pulled his microsoft balance as a method of payment , later he confirmed this with a customer service agent over the chat . 
  i know , however still awesome . 
  with my # 100 i preordered fallout 4 and bought gta v for xb1 , bought few apps for my lumia and still got few pounds # # left , 
  check the terms , for you to apply yourself you need to have a specific phone in their list . 
  leave cocaine out of this !, 
  * lumia 635 ( 512mb ram ) still a good purchase for windows 10 ? 
  no , its not . 
  the only hamburger i like is the food kind ... leave the menus alone and go back to metro , which we all agree was the best . 
  can anyone name which models are here ? 
  me too , looks futuristic, 
  thanks , i think that 's what i 'm going to do too . 
  you can get it from evozi or apkmirror . 
  well , depends . 
  for you to keep using wp you really have to love wp . 
  to be fair , all microsoft apps are available for android , some of them are updated every week and feel much better , so you still will be covered . 
  the smartwatch subject , i agree . 
  none is compatible with wp , only the band but thats more of a fitness tracker and not a smartwatch . 
  i was eyeing a motorola 360 v2 , they have the moto maker in uk so i could potentially create my own design . 
  i was hoping microsoft to step up their game and launch something like that for wp . 
  finally , if you want to leave wp temporarily to try new systems , that 's what happiness is all about so i wo n't stop you because you are right . 
  it depends if the phone you are using allows you to do everything you want and you need . 
  for some , they want a good camera , for others they want to be able to share boobie pics in snapchat , etc. 
  as long as it makes you happy , then go for it . 
  i , for one , keep coming back to wp when i try other mobile os mostly due system stability , battery life , always the best cameras , etc ; and because i 'm well invested in ms ecosystem : i own a microsoft band , my kids have cheap lumias , i have a xbox one , 3 windows pcs recently upgraded to w10 , etc. 
  error code 14 means your phone is unsupported ( from the unsupported list ) . 
  here is a link with a thread in xda to allow support for unsupported devices :, 
  please mind i have n't tried that myself so ca n't comment but hope it helps . 
  no , it still shows those problems . 
  i agree, 
  same here , can confirm . 
  does n't work with office 365 home . 
  still no battlelog for bf4/hardline users :(, 
  i have had both . 
  for a woman , i would recommend the 730/735 . 
  its smaller , nicer to hold and the screen is much better ( oled vs a cheap crappy lcd ) . 
  the battery life is similar , not that different . 
  both have the same ram and processor so speed wise , they are same . 
  but the 730 is more beautiful , at least thats what i think . 
  with the black cover ( or blue ) it has a matte finish so no glossy or slippery . 
  if you want i can take some video or photos holding both and send it to you / post them here . 
  i have the 640 in black colour and the 735 with a cyan blue battery back cover . 
  they have destroyed part of dominican republic too , just look at pink river rosario dominicana, 
  is he hugging her at the end ? 
  good photos !, 
  lets add this to the rumor mill, 
  ms health is not like health & fitness , it does n't have exercises and plans . 
  is just a glorified step counter . 
  i use it with my ms band but it is n't as feature rich as the health & fitness app . 
  so your point is invalid . 
  excellent choice , enjoy your 735 !, 
  the lcd in the 640 looks washed out , its a cheap version of the nokia 's cbd . 
  the 73x screen looks much much better . 
  and lets not forget also a working step counter that worked awesome with the motion data from the phone . 
  man , i will really miss that app when they remove it . 
  agree , did n't noticed that . 
  it has now two new options :, 
  * find a workout ( to look for workouts and sessions ), 
  * find a course ( to find a golf course ), 
  ** some images : **, 
  if they have a 4g dual sim model , i 'm sold !, 
  ok ok , show us a video then, 
  same here, 
  the force is strong in this one, 
  they are way overprotective plus if you end up showing your bank statements you do n't know what they will be asking next , i bet some sort of silliness as well . 
  so stay put and do n't give up !, 
  colours is how we say it in england too , can confirm, 
  can confirm , the 930 has wireless charging, 
  hit them where the sun do n't shine !, 
  buckinghamshire , uk, 
  you hit a nerve on wp fanboys ( or winthusiasts ) when you said the 950xl better do n't look like shit . 
  i strongly believe they recycled the same camera modules in the 930/icon & 1520 . 
  knowing microsoft i would n't expect some newer/improved camera . 
  my fav episode was then one bashing pop music singers, 
  randy reveals he is lorde and how he makes the music in fl studio :, 
  gr8 m8 war, 
  i bet they will be using the same camera modules as in the 930/1520 ... 
  same here , i got myself a 735 after giving my 930 to my brother ( long story ) . 
  felt much nicer in hand , kinda reminded me of the lumia 800 and the old nokia n9 . 
  only orange in france had some secure sim that was able to work with lumias . 
  yup , like when you taste a spoon, 
  damn it !, 
  i was really looking forward to run sailfish 2.0 in my lumia 830 :d, 
  how do you check the expiry date on store balance ? 
  the good old dun , how do you do it on the lumia ? 
  i still know how to do it as a csd on an old nokia with symbian . 
  it uses apple own push notif methods, 
  or an ipod touch , it does the job, 
  i 'm 32 and in my circle ( mostly programmers ) we only use whatsapp or facebook/fb messenger . 
  never heard of it . 
  snapchat ? 
  ah , thats the apps the kiddies use to send nudes and not `` leave a trace '' *, 
  * still leaves a trace, 
  wow , it sounds like something i ca n't live without , like air or water !, 
  yeah right , 70 % of the communication in your own phone . 
  mine for example is more like 70 % whatsapp , and the rest divided between facebook messenger , skype and emails .
