  by this pace , i think it will be more like triple soon \u2122, 
  that 'd be epic !, 
  yup , he was put on garden leave , that is you 're not at work but still getting paid . 
  which always surprised me : why the vp of mobile devices at microsoft was in a year sabbatical especially during the launch of w10m ? 
  do n't be naive, 
  this sub will have users having seizures if that happens \u263a, 
  keeping my 1020 on wp8 .1 . 
  for many many reasons . 
  steve litchfield has a very good summary and the pros outweight the cons on leaving any x2x devices on wp8 .1 : http://allaboutwindowsphone.com/features/item/21407_10_reasons_to_keep_your_lumia_.php, 
  wen in india ? 
  you pretty much covered the current state of apologysm in / r/windowsphone, 
  i use it quite a lot , never had any issues . 
  the same can be said about wp when it dies . 
  still sad to see this one go , makes you rethink about staying or leaving this platform . 
  currently happening now that paypal announced they willfully their app out . 
  you need the windows phone desktop companion , i use it to transfer whole playlists i already have in itunes at the end they are shown in the wp8 .1 native music app . 
  that 's the trend . 
  they all bells and whistles but as soon as they pull out , they are disgusting , never worked or was never used . 
  haha , usually these one grind my gears . 
  are they sure to drop a service ( like a bank or something major ) just because stubbornly sticking to a dead platform . . thats fanboy up to a new level !, 
  jason ward was right after all , the smartphone ( at least the windows part ) is dead . 
  i can agree , i had the xperia z5 along with the lumia 950 few months back and the 950 camera blown any other phone camera away , except the one in the lumia 1020 . 
  the truly best pureview camera sensor is the one in the 808 pureview , all others starting with 1020 usually leave a yellowish hue in all photos . 
  on daylight , i easily sort that out by changing the white balance to `` sunny '' however not too easy on nights or cloudy days , that bloody yellow tint always chased me . 
  surprisingly that email was only received by the most wp fanboish website ... 
  i call it b.s. 
  most important question : how would a x86 phone save wp ? 
  sounds great , i will carry my 24 '' monitor , keyboard and mouse everywhere . 
  or i could just buy a surface pro 4 i guess, 
  se la recomendar\u00e9 a mi gente en la rep. dominicana \u263a, 
  according to the bearded man in the video : htc 10 is louder and delivers better quality for vocals and slightly louder bass . 
  lots of people have it as per the comments , up until they swapped for the ms band , which is `` magical '' ... 
  got ta stop teabagging people in battlefield 4, 
  just wondering if they sold the movie rights to universal or paramount , this levle of b.s. 
  deserves a movie !, 
  exactly , they do everything and anything for those sweet air time ratings . 
  is freephonie still working ? 
  i thiugh they went out of business, 
  gives a whole new meaning to tea bagging, 
  can confirm , it 's a p.o.s. 
  i reckon one will be safer riding a wheelbarrow, 
  can confirm , i ca n't either, 
  traveling to standsted , not really surprised . 
  i once saw a japanese man with his luggage overweight . 
  upon opening the suitcase , it was full of haribo gummy bears and alike . 
  do n't they get haribo in japan or they taste different !, 
  i noticed in an advert that the asus transformer book t100ha windows 10 tablet that has an usb-c port and was wondering if my hd-500 continuum will work , sort of like a docking station/ports replicator adapter . 
  what 's the variety of this plant , i want to buy one for my daughter . 
  tolerant left = domestic moderate terrorists ? 
  i 've seen similar ads in ebay for almost destroyed phones like this :, 
  `` samsung up for grabs , slightly used just few scuffs , excellent ** working ** condition '', 
  what we all latinos agree on is we love to make fun of the spanish from 1 . 
  `` zpain '' accent . 
  yeah , is not like we ever used it . 
  the latest out cry when an app goes bust or no longer available for wp :, 
  ** who needs an app , just use the website **, 
  who needs an app , just use the website, 
  amazon will reply something like : * do n't let the door hit you in the ass on your way out *, 
  that would be romania, 
  or madrid trains, 
  like finger-puncture but for pigs, 
  recognized the dominican police uniform and dominican republic landscapes ( barrios ) , so she must be dominican . 
  i know at least three dudes named jes\u00fas from spain , quite common name there . 
  unlike the new movie, 
  anything for uk ? 
  i agree with the sarcasm , but you are right , it 's mostly young male capable of working and fighting for their own country ... 
  unless they are secretly sent by isis . 
  i 've seen this a lot in latin women , watched a documentary in vice and it 's basically butt implants and a waist training corset, 
  i once had an african neighbour and he used to get absolutely pissed when heard the word african american . 
  he said the right term should be black american since most of them are 300 years back generations and at this point not really african at all . 
  cold , not in uk, 
  bicester ( it 's pronounced beester ), 
  i agree , is not like i ever used the app , the mobile web is much better ,, 
  correct , they pronounce it like that : bister ( bees-ter ) ... imagine the first time i went there and asked at the bus station which bus to take to `` bi-ces-ter '' ... 
  it was like in the movies : the music suddenly stopped and everybody looked at me lol in my head like `` what did i say ? '', 
  if james bond taught the british something was to shoot first , ask later . 
  voted cold , not available in uk, 
  i just left a strongly worded tweet . 
  nothing i can do , they can always justify their actions via the t&c 's . 
  however it means i wo n't believe in any b.s. 
  that comes out of microsoft like windows phone or band products . 
  i think isis should step up their game , all these beheadings are getting lame and boring . 
  they need to start doing some evil knivel to remain relevant . 
  one of the happiest days ever !, 
  the game gear might need recapping but apart from that , all is working awesomely . 
  i was looking for some mega drive systems and games to play with my son , ended up getting all this . 
  less than $ 500 . 
  but most is in mint condition and some games themselves like night trap or supreme warrior for sega cd cost a lot here in uk let alone the consoles , totally worth it . 
  choo choo , mofo - karma is a bitch !, 
  just did the upgrade , thanks for letting me know guys . 
  hopefully this fixes the issue with street of rage 2 at the pirate 's boat in stage 2 , the game always freezes there . 
  i tried both eu and usa versions ( i own both ) and was freezing . 
  pretty sure is the retron5 since my megadrive does not freeze at such point . 
  awesome collection , which ones are you missing ? 
  i recommend checking in vgcollect.com for your missing games . 
  man , is this android ? 
  is this ios ? 
  when will it be released ? 
  i would gladly pay for that game, 
  exactly my thoughts , they are part of the same democrat government so what would change for the better with hrc that has n't with obama . ?!,
