  but now the note 8 uses samsung notes ( different app ) for the screen off memos and that one only syncs with a samsung account . 
  if you are wondering how big is the lumia 930 next to an iphone 6 , have a look at these photos . 
  i take the lumia 930 hundred times , the iphone feels and looks like a samsung lol, 
  hey guys , i want to ask for opinions here . 
  i had the lg g watch r but sold it due to some o/s glitches ( always overheating , running slow and laggy ) . 
  now that i 've seen they all have a new software upgrade to the latest , i am undecided . 
  the sw3 looks ugly however it has gps , wifi , an excellent battery life and is the only one that charges off a micro usb . 
  i heard music can be uploaded to the watch and play music offline in a bluetooth headset . 
  the lg urbane just came out , looks way much better than my previous phone ( hopefully they ironed out the software as well ) , has wifi and hr sensor but its damn pricey ( at least here in the uk ) . 
  would the sw3 be a good purchase at this point in time or should i wait a bit longer to see whats the others will bring to the table ? 
  i have a quick question . 
  is there any app that plays mp3 ( or m4a ) audio files that support resuming of audiobooks playing ? 
  i searched but could n't find any and the xbox music app is awful for this . 
  edit :, 
  found a recommendation from allaboutwindowsphone :, 
  it plays from internal memory and sd card , this is exactly what i was looking . 
  ** some of the specs : **, 
  * 5 inch ips tft screen with 1920x1080 resolution, 
  * msm8939 octa core 1.7 ghz, 
  * 3g ram + 32gb internal memory, 
  * microsd slot , support cards up to 128g, 
  * 16mp rear camera + 8mp front camera, 
  * band ( 4g ) : fdd-lte 800/1800/2100 / 2600mhz ( it works fine in ee & 3uk ), 
  * slot for 2 sim cards ( micro sim ), 
  * contrary of what al reviews say , this phone ** does not ** use nano sim cards . 
  it uses micro sim cards . 
  i had to use a sim card adaptor to use my nano sim in this phone . 
  ** my quick review : **, 
  * very light weight yet sturdy . 
  * build quality is excellent, 
  * screen looks very good , color wise . 
  * the phone feels very fast , thanks to the 64bit processor & 3gb ram . 
  * camera app included in the phone is crap . 
  the photos were very compressed . 
  i have replaced this with camera fv-5 , to unlock the camera sensor true potential , photos are excellent in my opinion . 
  * speaker quality is ok , on par with most phones . 
  * the lenovo ui is unobstructive and resembles ios a bit . 
  ** yet to test : **, 
  * wireless screen sharing ( miracast ), 
  i 'm testing w10 in my lumia 930 & 830 and noticed when i take photos , they are not getting refreshed in the photos app . 
  the only way to access them atm is by going to the lumia camera app and use the preview option to see the last photo taken . 
  turning the phone off and back on does n't address this issue . 
  not sure but , does anyone has a workaround ? 
  love this latest update but this is a major turnoff , as i use both my lumias to take tons of photos . 
  considering rolling back to wp8 .1 update if i do n't find an option . 
  i was surprised when asked the creator , this is a feature i would gladly pay for.http : / / i.imgur.com/ocmyhcr.png, 
  * this is more like a rant on myself . 
  i keep asking why do i spend money knowing android is so shit . 
  i agree it has all the apps but the wp panorama is much better as it used to be 2 or even 1 year ago . 
  * i was this wp user , since the lumia 800 , moved to the lumia 920 , then 925 and so on until the 1020 . 
  i was impressed by the camera however the phone lagged compared to the competition and apps were not the best . 
  people often made fun of me too so i moved to ios ( iphone 5 ) and settled for a while but again its ios so , booooring !, 
  * so i tried android . 
  i know can be a battery hog , privacy issues are always around but hey , is cheap and it has all apps . 
  today i got the worse user experience ever . 
  i bought an otg memory card to move data between my android and pc ( sandisk ultra dual ) . 
  i plugged the memory and got a warning : memory unknown , please format . 
  * the silly o/s ended up formatting both the otg ** and ** my internal microsd . 
  how stupid can it be ?!!, 
  lost months of data , all game saves , etc. 
  man , if i could bitch slap this phone , i would gladly do it , but i know is not the phone 's fault but android . 
  reading some xda i found is a common thing . 
  * so after having this bad time today i asked myself which apps do i use . 
  i reddit a lot to readit is there and its good . 
  i torrent my american tv shows so wptorrent pro is there . 
  i use feedly so i just noticed a new app in town called ** feedlab ** ( you guys have to try it , is very smooth ) . 
  6tag for instagram with 1080 support . 
  and whatsapp has voice now . 
  * i do n't snapchat and i 'm trying to avoid facebook like the plague . 
  do n't understand the fuss for these apps , they are useless and time consuming . 
  and nothing productive comes from it . 
  well , spanchat probably a wank on some hottie 's photos lol . 
  * so to cut my rant here : i 'm back to my lumia 930 . 
  at least i know the battery wo n't die by noon , that i will get all calls and sms ( excellent signal ) and the camera wo n't let me down . 
  after using wp for a few years i have decided to go back to a more mature o/s as my main phone , wp will be demoted . 
  ** things i liked about wp : **, 
  * people 's hub and the integration with facebook / twitter and social . 
  * pining all the live tiles and how nice this worked, 
  * an o/s that did n't require tons of ram or processor to work . 
  * good battery life . 
  * the best camera optics in the market . 
  ** things i hated about windows phone : **, 
  * the wpcentral app is not free . 
  it is free ( and way much better ) on android, 
  * most of the microsoft apps are available , some of them are much stable and nicer, 
  * the current ( and usual ) state of apps availability in wp . 
  i mean i do n't care about snapchat but bank apps ? 
  * updates : apps like imdb that have n't seen an update since 2012 where the ios / android are miles away in terms of functionality . 
  i get apps updates ( even from microsoft ones ) on a weekly basis . 
  i am not a wp fanboy . 
  i was ( well still am ) a nokia fanboy at best . 
  i went to wp because of nokia ( as well as many others europeans , that 's the whole reason why wp has such a significant market share here compared to us ) . 
  since few weeks back i feel that microsoft does n't believe in its own product and kept their users in a constant denial promising and not delivering , i am moving to another mobile o/s that suits me . 
  also microsoft tends to push all marketing and special offers in a market where they do n't exist : usa . 
  the rest of the world is neglected to a second place , even though we buy their phones way more than americans . 
  also mark my words , expect w10 for phones in november or even later . 
  some phones might not even get it . 
  that 's so microsoft ( remember wp 7.8 ? ), 
  the wp mobile team is known for being late and full of broken promises . 
  hope some of you realize this and stop believing in joe belfiore or mr rubino from wcentral .
