  its their job , they, 
  get paid to keep you interested in the platform , but the reality is another . 
  i will really miss the cool apps ( 6tag , readit , feedlab , lumia camera ) but i got tired of the constant ** `` coming soon \u2122 '' **, 
  i went last night to watch it , i liked that a lot : lumia 930 all over the movie ( also few surface pro ) . 
  ** spoiler alert : **, 
  there was a funny part where ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) answers the phone and as a lumia 930 owner i noticed the phone was upside down , you can see the speaker up . 
  not sure why they did n't edit that out or make another take . 
  lumia 930 owners will notice . 
  edit : fixed typos . 
  i gave my lumia 930 to my brother so i want another wp to keep me entertained until the flagships are released . 
  i currently use a high end android so i do n't really need something speedy . 
  so my question : i can see good prices in my country ( uk ) for the lumia 435 , lumia 530 and lumia 630 . 
  i noticed the 435 has slow processor but 1gb of ram and 8gb internal memory . 
  the other two ( 530 and 630 ) has dual core and only 512mb ram . 
  since it will work as a secondary phone , is the lumia 435 a recommended buy ? 
  will it get windows 10 ? 
  435 users : is it slow or enough for daily wp tasks ( phone , sms , readit , 6tag ) ? 
  i just noticed microsoft is putting the lumia 830 in eol ( allegedly by an article in wmpoweruser ) . 
  this phone was the so called `` affordable flagship '' . 
  it had so much potential however was plagued by issues ( touchscreen ) and disappointed customers . 
  i 've noticed this trend from nokia since the n95 days . 
  they usually do this : make a phone ( flagship ) , then release a cheaper one with features not present in the flagship . 
  in more recent days , nokia ( now microsoft , but i bet the same people around ) released the lumia 930 . 
  missing microsd , non replaceable battery , etc. 
  terrible choice however was ( still is ) the only flaship along the 1520 . 
  me as a customer , was very upset . 
  anyways , then they released the lumia 830 . 
  everything seems ok and it had replaceable battery , microsd slot and still had a minimal but lovely design except the screen : that lcd screen was so bad some chinese android phones were much better , looked washed out and even though they said it had cbd , the blacks were more like grey . 
  also that microsd slot , so difficult to take out the microsd . 
  then they released the 735 , which was meant to be cheaper but the screen on the 735 was a much better higher quality oled screen than 830 . 
  if they would 've released the 830 with the 735 screen , history would 've been other . 
  this scares me to buy one of the new flagships to be released , because i know they will release the phone and few months later will release a cheaper phone with better features . 
  the same thing , over and over . 
  the only phone i would say is top in the last two years have been the ** 1520 ** . 
  they did n't spare and that is indeed a true flagship . 
  ** i really hope they come up with something like that **, 
  i 've seen quite a lot of us getting this error when trying the whole apk sideload process . 
  i have found , by reading through forums ( xda ) and disqus comments ( wmpoweruser ) that the `` compatibility '' list is more like a guideline , that it is not written in stone and that the error code 14 does n't mean you phone `` is n't compatible '' but that is missing an important requirement called `` developer enhancements '' . 
  i found few solutions in xda that i will copy and paste ( minus a bit of editing ) . 
  kudos and credits to the original posters :, 
  ** solution # 1 ( posted by marocco2 ) : **, 
  * assuming that you are in w10 , perform a hard reset ( settings - about - reset phone ), 
  * do not put the microsoft account and skip this part . 
  * open settings  security update  for developers ; click on the `` developer mode '' and confirm . 
  * head on windows update and searches . 
  it should say `` no updates available '' . 
  * head on the store ; download windows insider ;, 
  it should ask you to put a microsoft account ( the one you skipped ) , do it . 
  * click on and start the download . 
  note : ( after the hard reset , the store will be attempt to download about 32 apps in total , cancel all but microsoft visual c + + and windows insider ) . 
  * open windows insider and select the fast ring . 
  confirm it . 
  * go to windows update and check for updates . 
  it should allow you to get the `` developer enhancements '' . 
  ** solution # 2 ( posted by insignificant ) : **, 
  * at the first time when i tried it on my lumia 730 i always got the error code 14 . 
  even a hard reset did n't work . 
  and i did n't get the developer enhancement package . 
  after i got back to wp 8.1 and upgraded again to windows 10 it finally worked . 
  and i still did n't get a developer enhancement package . 
  ** hope this helps . 
  please provide your feedback if it works or if it does n't . 
  guys , i 'm in the uk and i 'm looking for a nice wp experience ( flagship ) . 
  currently i got a 735 but it is a bit slow sometimes and camera wise it is n't the best . 
  i was thinking in the l1520 or - again - a l930 , however camera purple hue and overheating put me off the l930 so i am thinking in the 1520 . 
  is it worth to get it now ? 
  mind it will be only to be used as a secondary phone not as my main phone ( i have another for that purpose ) . 
  also , ** does it matter the differences between the 1520.1 and 1520.2 ? 
  the ** 1520.1 ** , intl model is a freaking unicorn and people often selling it ask for # 250 - # 300 for it ( around us$ 500 ) . 
  this one comes with 32gb internal and qi wireless charge . 
  i have noticed the ** 1520.2 ** ( at&t american version ) goes for $ 199 unlocked in expansis usa , and they ship internationally so it will cost me like $ 220 shipped - which is around # 140 here in uk ) . 
  this one comes with 16gb and no wireless charge , which to be honest i wo n't use at all . 
  hope any one can shed some light about this . 
  thanks, 
  i broke down my lumia 930 so i had it replaced with this lumia 735 . 
  after few weeks of usage , have a look at my quick review in case you are interested in one :, 
  ** so far , first the good things : **, 
  * excellent battery life . 
  like 2 full days with average use ( a few calls & sms , 6tag and few other apps pushing notifications ), 
  * very good size , feels nice in hand like sturdy . 
  * beautiful oled screen . 
  * the signal and voice quality you expect from a nokia . 
  * 4g lte ( this applies only to the 735 , the 730 is only 3g/hsdpa ), 
  * microsd slot ( i use mine with a 32 gb card there with no issues ), 
  * many alternative to missing or crappy apps . 
  example : 6tag is an instagram app that 's much better designed than the official one . 
  feedlab for feedly , tubecast for youtube and the list goes on . 
  * superb gps app ( nokia here maps ) which can be used offline and without internet connection . 
  * front camera is 5 megapixels , along with lumia selfie 's app , very nice for whoever is into that . 
  * replaceable battery & back cover , multiple choice of colours . 
  ** the bad : **, 
  * apps : some of them are beta , some of them are terribly bad compared to ios/android counterparts ( i own an android as well and can confirm ) . 
  * no capacitive buttons as in the lumia 830/930/1520 , they are on-screen and it gets a bit annoying hiding / showing them . 
  * only 8gb . 
  but luckily has microsd slot so not that is that bad . 
  * not that bothers me ( i 'm 30 + yrs old ) but kids complain there is no ** snapchat **, 
  * i 'm not impressed by the back camera , however this is subjective as i am used to a lumia 930 ( 20 megapixels ) . 
  ** conclusion : **, 
  a very good phone for beginners who do n't need many apps , at an excellent price . 
  also future proof as it is in the w10 compatible phones .
