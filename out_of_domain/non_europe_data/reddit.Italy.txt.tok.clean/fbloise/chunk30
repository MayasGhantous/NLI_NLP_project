  it has the same ram and processor as the lumia 830/640/640xl . 
  i think if the camera is n't a must , then i suggest to consider this one over the lumia 830 . 
  i have yet to try the 640 but i think this is a much better choice .

  currently this phone goes for # 128 in argos , i got mine for # 124 few weeks back with etrade deal-of-the-day . 
  prices may vary but we have started seeing this phone price going down . 
  hey there guys ,, 
  got a lumia 830 from amazon last week as a birthday gift , beautiful phone , however today in the early morning i was reading readit while drinking coffee and logged into 8stream . 
  put it in my pocket and head to work . 
  to my dismay , the phone was in airplane mode ( or flight mode ) when i arrived to my office . 
  pressing the button goes back to enabled . 
  pressing the airplane mode button in the notification centre makes a very weird glitch which makes the phone overheat . 
  ** i tried : **, 
  * soft reset using vol down + power . 
  did n't work . 
  * full reset the phone ( using about  reset your phone ) . 
  did n't work . 
  * full restore the 830 to the latest device firmware , using lumia recovery tool in my work pc . 
  did n't work . 
  reading some entries in the wpcentral forums i found people having similar problems , which they kinda sorted by turning on the lumia while keeping the usb cable connected to the mains . 
  somehow the aerial antenna is directly related to the usb internal cabling . 
  not sure , i 'm not an expert . 
  i tried that and guess what ? 
  did n't work . 
  right now i 'm without a wp ( feeling a bit depressed and all the things that come with it ) , as i gave my previous phone , a lumia 735 , to my eldest daughter . 
  anyone having this issue ? 
  i think i will send it to microsoft for repairs , as this to me sounds like a motherboard issue , but i 'm not 100 % sure . 
  ** update **, 
  i received this email from microsoft :, 
  * hello !, 
  we were unable to repair your lumia 830 and have instead exchanged it for you . 
  the replacement is now on its way back to you via ups . 
  the ups tracking number is xxxxxxxxxx *, 
  so , if you have this problem , please contact microsoft to have it repaired/exchanged . 
  hey guys , i 've been testing the latest build , 10549 on two lumias , 830 & 930 , wanted to share my findings . 
  ** first the bad ( i do n't like to sugar-coat things ) : **, 
  * loads of resuming everywhere, 
  * issues with the photos app , it seems to hang sometimes , other times it crashes . 
  also display living images whenever feels like it . 
  other times when adjusting bright ( for rich capture photos ) it just force closes . 
  * photos taken with windows camera are slightly worse than lumia camera . 
  * microsoft messaging consuming a large amount of power whilst idle ( found this in the battery saver screen ), 
  * sometimes i see like apps taking shit load of time to open ( just a black screen ) which i 'm then forced to press & hold back and kill them at the multitask menu . 
  * sudden overheating , checked multitask and no apps were open . 
  * device specific ( lumia 830 ) : it hang and never recovered ( just showing `` resuming '' at start screen ), 
  * still no `` hey cortana '', 
  * i feel that when using wifi , the battery gets depleted quicker ( it did n't happen in 10536 that way ), 
  * battery life is a hit n miss . 
  during the day was ok with all my usage but during the night was awful , i woke up to a 13 % left ( when i went to bed it was 75 % ) . 
  thanks god is saturday , otherwise ... 
  ** good things : **, 
  * feels much faster through menus, 
  * swiping down the notifications and quick actions is much faster than previous build 10536, 
  * much stable and almost no disconnections when using bluetooth devices like microsoft band and bluetooth headsets . 
  * groove music seems more stable on this one . 
  * edge browser seems faster, 
  * lumia moments now has a new name : microsoft photos plugin and it gets embedded into the photos app . 
  quite nice imo . 
  * no issues downloading a new language in the keyboard . 
  i will be adding some more as i find them . 
  ** edit 19/10/2015 **, 
  ** added some new : **, 
  * sometimes in edge you type and the text does n't show on the screen ( due to black theme ) . 
  * random bugs caused by cortana . 
  turn off cortana to prevent random over heating and battery drains . 
  - search button -  hamburger menu -  notebook -  settings . 
  * tiles take a long time to show up on the start screen ( when pinning new apps to the start screen ) . 
  they also take some time to disappear when being unpinned , leaving you with a blank tile for a couple of minutes . 
  * store charging for apps already paid . 
  looking at the latest newd and photo samples from juha , i am really looking forward to buy a 950 as soon as it is avail in uk . 
  however i think microsoft w10m team should sweeten the deal by adding timelapse and slow motion functions natively in the windows camera . 
  heck , even some older phones ( 1520 , 930 ) are perfectly capable of shooting 60fps videos . 
  this should be definitely welcome by the users community especially mobile camera fanboys ( like me ) . 
  i mean , we all know and noticed microsoft marketing is as friendly as a club 's bouncer . 
  its appalling . 
  its terrible . 
  and worst : it does n't freaking work !!!!!, 
  but here are some ideas , hopefully someone at microsoft can pull his head out of his ass and act accordingly :, 
  * lumia rewards ( # 50 / $ 50 / $ 50 free voucher for apps , music and movies on your phone ) : why stopping at only a handful of devices ? 
  moreover , why in the world not making this a trend for new devices like 950 , 950 xl and 550 ? 
  * red stripe deals : for the love of baby jesus , please copy google ( celebrate milestones like 1 billion apps downloaded with tons of free apps ) or apple ( by having officially an app for free every week ) . 
  why relying on 3rd parties like myappsfree or adduplex hero ? 
  w10 users deserve something official from ms. amirite ? 
  * bring bing rewards to as many countries as possible . 
  this will kick googgle 's hegemony in the nuts . 
  there is nothing that people love more than rewards & money . 
  * spend in marketing as many screens as possible : tvs , movie theatres , train & bus station billboards , etc. 
  c'mon microsoft , you have the damn money by doing cuts and firing tons of people lately , stop being so stingy . 
  * and finally , for the love of god stop prioritizing all the cool stuff like bing rewards or new flagship microsoft stores in the country that cares less about windows in mobile devices . 
  concentrate in the countries where you stand a chance and currently have 10 % or more , like india , brazil , russia , china and europe . 
  usa is a lost cause , especially since windows phone never had a full support from carriers ( and never will ) . 
  but the world is not just usa . 
  regards ,, 
  a windows phone user since 2011, 
  i decided giving the lumia 950 xl a shot and here is my review . 
  i will start with the physical aspects of hardware . 
  ** hardware : **, 
  it felt a lot similar in hand to the 640 xl , so completely not the high end plastic as in the lumia 1520 or 1020 , but closer to cheap plastic like the 640 , 640xl and cheaper devices .
