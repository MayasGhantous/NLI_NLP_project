  although sturdy in hand , it does not feel like a premium device compared to other similar priced high end in the market ( iphone 6s plus , galaxy s6 edge + ) . 
  not that this affects the phone ergonomics plus can be easily resolved by getting a mozo backplate . 
  it looks and feels much much better with a mozo cover , trust me . 
  the size is similar to the 640xl too so not too big . 
  the buttons position is weird and it takes a bit to get used , it is a similar pointless approach to the weird volume buttons positions in the xperia z5 which i had . 
  i am not sure why microsoft went like this or which ergonomics studies they based this on but well , is worth mentioning . 
  positive remark is i really like and enjoy the 2-step camera button , very nice to have this . 
  i do not like the loudspeaker position ( next to camera flash ) because it can be muffled and covered sometimes , depending where the phone is sitting . 
  i much prefer this to be at the bottom , similar to the samsung galaxy s6 or the iphone 6 . 
  the sound is clear and loud , worth mention . 
  screen is very clear and quality is top , as expected at this price point so no issues . 
  resolution is 1440 x 2560 pixels so qhd . 
  i had a few ghost taps , similar to those in the lumia 1520 , where swipping is not recognized as such and it does like a tap . 
  also tapping sometimes not always means it will execute the action so i found myself tapping twice or three times . 
  not sure if hardware issue or w10m issue . 
  the backplate is sturdy and light , but feels cheap though . 
  it has wireless charging and a coil for gps and other rf antennas . 
  battery is 3300 mah and i noticed it last about day and a half with tons of usage . 
  light users might get 2-3 days out of this phone . 
  my android phone ( galaxy s6 edge ) does n't last more than 10 hours for comparison . 
  finally , in the hardware topics , this new lumia line uses a usb-c to take advantage of this usb bus speeds however at this moment it is 2.0 , but can be upgraded to 3.0 when microsoft release such update , which is great as it is future proof . 
  this unit was made in vietnam . 
  ** camera : **, 
  the camera is very good and fast , thanks to the 3gb of ram and the new processor . 
  i do n't see those `` processing '' messages like in my wife 's lumia 930 or worse , in my lumia 1020 . 
  results are slightly better than those from the lumia 930/1520 sensor , however processing is much faster as mentioned . 
  the resolution is 20 megapixels in the books , but the real resolution is 19.2 megapixels for 4:3 photos and 16 megapixels for 16:9 photos . 
  rich capture has been replaced for having it disabled altogether or automatic rich capture , where the camera app decides when is recommended to take those shots . 
  not a bad thing but i wanted to have the choice of turned off - turned on and auto . 
  hope this gets added to a later version of the camera app . 
  video can be up to 4k 30fps but this i noticed overheats the device so i tried to keep it to a minimum of 3 minutes . 
  i have seem similar approach in other 4k capable devices from samsung or sony . 
  also w10m introduces slow motion recording ( it shows a turtle icon , very nice ) but results are limited to 120fps and 720p resolution . 
  now lets get into what is wrong with this phone : ** the software **, 
  the windows 10 , although very eye candy and closer to android/ios to its predecessor wp8 , feels very buggy and beta . 
  when i got the phone it came with windows 10 build 10.0.10586.0 . 
  the buggiest shit ever , the phone was rebooting by itself , over-heating and trying to download apps from the store was a painful process , where apps sit there acquiring license or just a frozen download like 0.3 mb out of 0.3 mb , for days . 
  i was so upset that i felt like microsoft was playing with its loyal users , the few left in this platform anyways . 
  well , few days later and after two hard-resets and several reboots , the phone found a new update labeled ** microsoftmdg ** with build version 10.0.10586.29 which i installed right away , i mean could it go worse anyways ? 
  after this , the phone is much more stable and the over-heating seems kinda resolved . 
  i still get some `` resuming '' here and there especially when getting out of the camera , it seems to hang in the main start menu , but other than that , the phone is in a much better state at the moment . 
  my opinion is this mobile o/s is not ready for the masses . 
  if we power users ( as what i like to consider myself ) have so many issues , imagine my wife or someone older like my dad . 
  and as much as i hate to remind , once you recommend a phone , you ended up being that person `` free tech support '' . 
  i think ** w10 ** has so much potential but the lack of apps , coupled by the fact some apps are not even updated since like jesus days coupled with buggy hardware for some people ( besides all updates ) and we have the perfect recipe for failure . 
  add windows hello , in its current state which is kinda nice and a novelty but too buggy to be used as a daily driver . 
  but there is more and i am the type of person who likes to see the glass half full !, 
  i think there is a positive part , which is continuum . 
  ** continuum : **, 
  i feel there is loads of potential , from office 365 to salesforce . 
  i think microsoft should push the lumia 950/950xl to the enterprise instead of consumer . 
  this couple with windows 10 encryption and security ( windows hello ) is a great option from small & home offices to big enterprises . 
  most companies already use exchange or up to some extend office 365 , which makes this platform a great option . 
  also , if salesforce makes a good continuum version of their cloud sales and crm software , we have a winner . 
  i had the chance to play with my lumia 950 xl connected to a continuum dock and paired with a microsoft arc mouse and a microsoft universal foldable keyboard . 
  the result left me so impressed with what can be accomplished with this kind of setup . 
  i imagined small companies not needing to invest in new pc 's and allowing users to take their company phones home or for travel ( either business or leisure ) . 
  although continuum alone is not sufficient , it is a great option that the microsoft sales team should be pushing . 
  ** the problem : **, 
  the problem and i will be honest and brief , is that microsoft stopped believing in their platform soon after they acquired nokia mobiles . 
  from having the best hardware/camera/os they went to be the underdog that all tech blogs hated . 
  and worse , we as users could not disagree with them , since most of it was the truth . 
  after this , we all have witness how wp8 , which was catching up , started going down , how they forgot to launch flagships for like 2 years and flooded the market with overpriced under-powered phones . 
  this probably caused management confusion . 
  add the layoffs and some brilliant minds left this to pursuit other careers in apple or google . 
  and the icing on this cake was releasing an incomplete windows 10 mobile . 
  ** and how to fix it : **, 
  * microsoft should concentrate in releasing only fewer phones . 
  * microsoft should sell this platform the same way they showcase the surface platform everywhere . 
  * microsoft should spend the same level of commitment they seem to give android and ios , and release their apps and updates for all three platforms at the same time . 
  * microsoft should stop neglecting and ignoring their windows phone fanbase . 
  ** conclusion : **, 
  lets all hope these points are reviewed and fixed by microsoft . 
  thanks to the lumia voices team for lending me this device . 
  i decided to get one based on my impressions . 
  they will announce the release of a vr head unit in december 2017 , made out of cardboard and compatible with only lumia 660xl, 
  hello guys ,, 
  i am struggling trying to buy and download the lara croft go game , but can confirm this applies to any other app that is n't free . 
  the issue is i press the buy button ( marked with my country currency # 0.79 ) and it takes me to the part where i see the credit card info and a summary of the transaction and before i can hit the blue buy button , it flashes back to the game main page ( like a loop ) . 
  anyone having this problem ? 
  i tried also buying it from my windows 10 pc at home , same issue . 
  edit :, 
  it seems fixed today morning 14/02/2016, 
  i 've upgraded the groove music app few days back , now it is not showing any of my playlists or music . 
  if i go to album , nothing . 
  if i go to artists , or songs , same : nothing . 
  i selected to show all available not only streaming but also available offline . 
  the only thing now it seems i am not `` logged '' and it stays in `` signing in '' all the time . 
  good 4g , good wifi connection , it just wont sign in thus not showing my music . 
  connected to the windows phone companion app for pc , re-sync ` ed all the playlists again , and i can see them in the file explorer in the \\ music folder along with all the mp3 's . 
  damn it , this microsoft people fix one thing and break like 99 . 
  getting tired of this b.s. 
  to be honest . 
  lately i 've seen all my family and work colleagues posting silly photos everywhere ( facebook , twitter , whatsapp ) , most of them funny , taken with the masquerade app ( msqrd for short ) . 
  is there any app like this for w10m ? 
  i noticed the speed compared to the lumia 950 xl , and as much as i hate the 950 xl buttons layout , it feels like a much better option . 
  also the screen to body ratio seems much better on the lumia 950xl , size difference is n't that noticeable like i though would be . 
  continuum users will notice the speed bump too . 
  i will make a in-depth comparison between both phones , my 950 xl is supposed to arrive tomorrow morning . 
  so tl ; dr : selling my 950 to get a 950xl,
