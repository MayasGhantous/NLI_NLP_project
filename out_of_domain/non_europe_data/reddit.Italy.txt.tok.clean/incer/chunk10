  `` i loooove taxes !! '', 
  more likely they felt op is karma-whoring other people 's work . 
  not a good idea outing her to all the crazy people on the internet , please remove this, 
  * i feel safer than women in many circumstances . 
  traveling is easier when you do n't have to fear being raped , abused or simply pushed around . 
  * going out with other guys drinking , talking about bullshit and getting into ( reasonable ) trouble is great . 
  * i appreciate my strength and i like making my gf feel safe . 
  * obvious penis-related advantages . 
  * stronger personality . 
  * better self-reliance on average . 
  edit : being able to generate my own body heat . 
  and beer . 
  lots of beer . 
  infiltration . 
  those idiots with numbers for evaluating girls and intricate `` plans '' for getting laid . 
  i think they have a name ( apart from losers ) but ca n't recall . 
  she takes charge ? 
  ** great ** , less work for me to do !, 
  yes . 
  i know it may not sound politically correct , but on average men do have a stronger personality . 
  not every man of course , and many women actually have a very strong personality , but look around , who 's usually easier to control and push around ? 
  me and my gf are both like this . 
  finding stuff to do on weekends is hard . 
  poor kids ... 
  but a bottle opener wo n't get you into trouble when going to the bank, 
  not many do . 
  they get ridiculed . 
  italy not so much, 
  do n't you have metal detectors at the bank 's entrance ? 
  nope , i 'm from italy . 
  yes , even keys can set them off in sufficient numbers . 
  that 's why there are small receptacles with locks at the entrance of the bank , where you can leave your stuff and pick it up when you get out . 
  it 's hard to fight your natural instincts . 
  once the amount of immigrants goes above a certain percentage of the population , racism soars . 
  it takes a lot of effort to keep a level head , and given that most people are stupid ... 
  horrible . 
  `` hey , let 's turn myself into a freak ! '', 
  and horrible that she would toy with it !!, 
  it does n't look like an healthy thing to do !!, 
  or a person with a giant tumor in his foot, 
  i love this kind of comments ... as if anyone gives a fuck about him leaving . 
  from my experience , the smell and taste of a particular puss vary a bit depending on various things , and can be stronger or weaker depending on the time since it 's last been washed , but in the end , they 're all still variations of the same smell . 
  and it does n't change completely from one day to the other . 
  if op goes down on her as regularly as he says , he knows her taste and its variations . 
  nope, 
  an hard drive gives off more interference than a light bulb . 
  still negligible , though . 
  that said , it 's easier to just turn off your ipod for a few minutes while taking off just to make them happy , it takes little effort and it 's polite towards the crew . 
  he 's referring to a plane crash, 
  no doubt someone will mod one like that, 
  yeah , there was a * little * active aggression , actually . 
  red alert taught me that it would have led to a soviet rise to power and psychic troops !, 
  you just described an outgoing person , not a leader, 
  that 's just a reliable person, 
  you guys confuse your adjectives, 
  not really . 
  while most people who aim to lead must somehow learn how to interact well , it 's not necessary to be outgoing . 
  and many outgoing people are not really `` strong '', 
  it looks like she 's got a foot for an hand , when she 's actually scratching, 
  i 'd give you an upvote for making me read that in clarkson 's voice , but i disagree with the fact you 've stated , so i 'll give you a nonvote !, 
  here . 
  is there something you do n't like about the note 2 that makes you want to change phone ? 
  thank you for the laughs , the guy 's expression is great, 
  yeah , it kind of upsets me , and i 'm not even american, 
  safe mode ?

  and guess what happened to him ? 
  right , ** nothing ** . 
  beard discrimination ? 
  we ca n't know . 
  the other lane was n't moving , and in europe ( in my experience ) it 's actually more common to have one side of the traffic light all green for going straight and turning either way , than having green for one lane and red for the other on the same side . 
  edit : i ca n't english, 
  ew tiptronic ... used to own an audi a6 with that stuff ... horrible ... incredibly slow shifting . 
  in that case it 's a different story . 
  my audi was a great car ruined by a horrible gearbox . 
  it had a truly great engine ( 3.0 turbodiesel ) , but it 's useless if it takes more than one second to shift gear . 
  how are your maintenance costs ? 
  `` dildo mods '' makes me think of dildo upgrades like those for videogame weapons, 
  i played pacifist in deus ex hr ... until the chopper was brought down and i could n't ko all of the attackers before they killed malik . 
  i then became a ruthless exterminator . 
  you would n't download a person, 
  italian here , if i went into a bar and they tried making me coffee with a moka , i 'd most likely leave immediately and never come back . 
  but if you do n't specify , it defaults to a normal espresso . 
  exactly why would anyone study italian ? 
  it 's ( almost ) completely useless !, 
  ( i 'm italian ), 
  that 's a bit overkill , i 'd be in fear of explosions :p, 
  * coffee made using a moka can be good , but ... espresso is another world completely . 
  moka coffee is n't bad , but espresso is just better . 
  meaning that he ca n't `` point to the coffeepot '' anyway . 
  bere , not bevere, 
  that 's what i drink , actually . 
  no sugar . 
  unless i 'm having breakfast , then i 'll take a simple cappuccino . 
  with sugar . 
  the point is that you ca n't make espresso with a moka ... espresso is made with a high pressure machine , and is very diminutive in quantity , a moka would n't even work with that small amount of water . 
  bars are different here . 
  most are n't even open after dinner time . 
  it 's more of a place where you stop to have breakfast , lunch , or have a quick coffee ( or something alcoholic ) en route from one place to another . 
  also after work you can meet there with your friends to kill some time before going home ... or you can go there before an evening out on a weekend .
