  ... to the face, 
  they should build better quality ground . 
  sounds like a drink, 
  well , canada is in north america , after all, 
  ** hey guys we found one !, 
  no , he did n't, 
  i am normally hairy for an european male , and i do have hair on top of my feet . 
  i 'd say half the density when compared to my legs . 
  but a preliminary visit to a porn producer is mandatory . 
  i 'm on the pumpkin theme ... 
  it 's the one with the best finish in my opinion . 
  i even changed my phone 's theme to match it . 
  there 's also the face recognition software running , though . 
  ok , we all know that * it is still too soon for mobile-only to be a valid option * , and that he used a virtual desktop and so on , but this is more about showing where we are going than about where we are , and i find this fascinating . 
  cloud computing and powerful mobile devices get us closer to a world where we ** anyone ** can ** easily ** access his own data at any time in any place , and work on it in various ways . 
  there 's also the fact that he rides like chris pfeiffer even though it 's his first time . 
  i would n't look too deep into it . 
  it probably looks big because the picture was taken with a long zoom , which tends to screw up the depth of the scene . 
  nice decorations . 
  well , you got the meaning :p, 
  my lg 2x used to turn off too with the original firmware , but with cyanogen it stays on . 
  kind of strange . 
  also i 've never found a rom ( even the original one ) that did read charge correctly . 
  if you swap out your battery when you 're at 20 % with a fully charged one , when you turn back on your phone it still reads 20 % ... then slowly ** increases ** . 
  we have all this wonderful new and advanced military tech , and nowhere of relevance to test it !, 
  let 's say we have very flexible peeing capabilities !, 
  more like `` speed on , guy who saved his friend 's life ! '', 
  not if he catches you again, 
  whatsapp, 
  water on a frying pan makes oil pop, 
  maybe they hacked cheats in ? 
  great game , if somewhat short . 
  but it appears they 'll update with more chapters in the near future . 
  currently on sale with the humble bundle, 
  or to remove splinters ... that sweet , sweet thorium under my skin makes me feel so good . 
  ah , the pleasures of the modern life . 
  dude , you 're the only surviving australopithecus in the world , that 's got ta count for something !, 
  pain, 
  he 's talking about purchased apps you do n't have installed . 
   pee fetish, 
  that 's not really disgusting if he does n't happen to pee on you or try to steal your pee ... 
  i mean , it does n't influence you in any way . 
  oh ... well then , that 's disgusting , actually . 
  ... which does n't separate bought apps from free ones . 
  you guys keep playing with my emotions, 
  and it 's the same in italian ... 
  i 'd like to emigrate too and `` food-culture-shock '' is my greatest fear , as an italian . 
  veneti ? 
  quiet ? 
  are you crazy ? 
  and where would that be ? 
  there 's lots of fat people in italy ... 
  i thought you were saying it in spanish ... 
  which would be `` pene '' . 
  not my fault if you ca n't communicate . 
  dunno , but as someone from emilia , people from veneto sound fucking loud to me most of the time, 
  and opera, 
  kinda ugly , actually . 
  some things are best forgotten !, 
  could you say that in batman 's voice ? 
  usual stuff : men `` can take it '' , so everyone feels like it 's justified . 
  about $ 2,2 for those wondering, 
  italians are not as rich as americans, 
  i am italian . 
  it 's very hard to be able to afford your own place when you 're alone , if you 're not well-off or have an amazing job . 
  only chance is living with your partner or having a roommate ( or more ) , which is uncommon here . 
  that 's because it turns away both religious and non-religious people with its hateful users, 
  ... and he lost a wheel . 
  that 's what i call a tourist trap, 
  here in italy ( not that our education system is an example to follow ) , you have both oral and written grades , and teachers can decide how many of each they need . 
  the average classroom has about 25 people in elementary , middle and high school . 
  download it and open it locally, 
  unfortunately i 've had the same problem with this kind of long pictures , both in my reddit client ( baconreader ) and in the browser ( they probably use the same engine ) , they do n't zoom enough . 
  but if you download it and open in an image viewer , then you can zoom . 
  then send everything by mail, 
  different resolutions . 
  i guess that would depend on personal preference ... 
  the problem is not being able to zoom 100 % at all ... 
  pure ac/dc is even better, 
  people would come from other countries to vote for him . 
  from other planets , even . 
  afterburners on the liner 's cockpit ? 
  shit 's stayin ' real, 
  that 's seriously uncivilized . 
  i ca n't even imagine what could be the thought process that leads someone to make requests like these !, 
  nope . 
  just do as he said . 
  in some circumstances it 's better to say the minimum necessary . 
  that way you can later change the implications of what you said just by adding something . 
  it 's not like your facebook activities are the only important things for hiring you . 
  if they have any significant influence over their decision to hire you , that means the employer prefers submissive , albeit inferior in skills , employees . 
  is that somewhere you 'd want to work ? 
  only to lose you job overnight one year later because a company full of idiots has no future ? 
  you block port 80 ? 
  [ reminds me of the monkey forcing a frog into oral sex ] ( http://youtu.be/qve60zwxx1k ) ** ( warning : explicit frog rape . 
  it 's for android phones, 
  ... gross . 
  gay merman ? 
  my xperia t when put on automatic brightness still uses the slider to adjust the `` base '' brightness , so you can tweak it to your liking and still let it vary depending on outside light . 
  in this case your method would n't help you , as you 'd still have to set an `` average '' brightness ...
