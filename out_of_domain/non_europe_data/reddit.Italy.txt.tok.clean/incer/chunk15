  i tried the z and it could n't last one full day , so i went back to my t. 
  greenify is useful for apps which have notifications you do n't need ... 
  but if you have a messaging app that 's wasting a lot of battery ( i 'm looking at you , facebook messenger ) either you give up notifications or battery life . 
  [ we have very different usage patterns ] ( http://imgur.com/qnqxmru ), 
  in this area reception is poor with any carrier . 
  but if you look at the screen on time , that 's where the battery plunges . 
  as an european i ca n't understand this . 
  why would your government want to enforce this limit so much , even when individual states feel differently ? 
  captain boobius, 
  you mean it releases when under excessive pressure ? 
  not with phones ' crappy sensors . 
  actually it depends on the kind of customers . 
  most of them actually prefer if you do n't lie or bend truth to much . 
  bargain of the century, 
  [ hmmm ... no data ? 
  well , if you live in some areas ( like me ) you do n't really need caps , given that the woohoo 7 mbps adsl actually runs at 640kbps, 
  sounds like some experiment the cia would run, 
  different thing : russia is actually capable of fighting back to american retaliation, 
  it should be the boundary , border between the good comments and the bad . 
  sort of a `` abandon all hope ye who enter here '' warning, 
  that 's like the oldest ( and kinda saddest ) phone joke ever , in the same league as yelling `` pass me the joint '' when as kids someone was on the phone with his mother , and a girlfriend who does n't understand this is just stupid , sorry . 
  not his mother 's fault if the guy was cheating . 
  in my experience , meeting different cultures ( especially in their own land ) tends to reduce racism and hate . 
  mobility of people from all parts of the world should be encouraged , as while you can hate a population after listening to the news , your religious leader or whatever , it 's much harder to hate someone ( and his race ) after you 've talked to him , ate together and joked together . 
  as an european , after all the recent spy news i would have a different opinion on americans if i did n't have previous experience of traveling there and meeting all kinds of people . 
  in the end , most of the people in this world are the same , on every continent , they just want to live their lives in peace . 
  it 's the few psychopaths who wish to gain from conflict who are ruining life for everybody . 
  reading this thread is like watching somebody gradually growing up, 
  and make it a major point in the keynote . 
  `` and this release forces that guy on reddit to eat his dick '' * huge cheer *, 
  let 's start making 2000 $ - lumias, 
  could you elaborate ? 
  i 'm not american, 
  as if the german government could care less about an arab `` citizen '' . 
  warning : it 's extremely frustrating, 
  how much time does your pal spend with his arduinos to warrant a custom cake ? 
  it 's not like we 're all here waiting for you to switch to linux, 
  ... you 're one of those sgts ? 
  women wear heels mostly to enhance the look of legs & ass , not necessarily to appear taller . 
  moreover it 's common for women to wear heels , while it 's not for a man ... going against this custom as a man tends to betray an ulterior motive . 
  dude . 
  that way you 're closer to the goods . 
  nope , my statement is based on the statement of many girls : friends , girlfriends , sister , etc. . . 
  it 's not like it 's a well kept secret shared only between those of the female gender . 
  it does n't prove that he 's insecure , i never said that he 's insecure , i just said that doing something like that usually requires a reason , and in this case , what does that make you think ? 
  too bad for the original owner of that wine , though . 
   women wear heels ** mostly ** to enhance the look of legs & ass , ** not necessarily ** to appear taller . 
  your rudeness is totally out of place . 
  looks like i 'm the one wasting time here . 
  thank you . 
  people are n't getting this . 
  that 's why video evidence is important . 
  even if it ca n't stand in court , you can always have it `` leak '' on the internet . 
  but it may give them a better future in the long term , free of the risks that corruption brings . 
  reading comprehension , boy . 
  i never wrote that all women wear heels for that reason , and i never said that he is insecure , i 've just explained why people tend to come to that conclusion . 
  you know when you desire something so bad , even if you would n't know what to do with it if you had it ? 
  it seems you have trouble understanding , or do n't want to . 
  this conversation is going nowhere . 
  roughly 5 ' 11 '', 
  yeah well , let her work for it !, 
  uhm ... 
  i 've seen distros deploy patched binaries before the original developers even updated their sources ... 
  what he meant is that people use it to define hate of homosexuals , not fear . 
  and it 's wrong . 
  ... uhm ... do you want a few suggestions about ... that ... ? 
  poor people, 
  nope ... 
  it 's like that all over the world , as far as i 've seen . 
  ... dinner ? 
  italy here . 
  no it wo n't . 
  first thing to do after his wife gets convicted ? 
  go out and party with carlos !, 
  my van had one of those as an ashtray , it fit into one of the cupholders and could be removed . 
  ... cheerful . 
  weekend in vegas, 
  nah , i find it relaxing . 
  liberating , actually . 
  usually it 's just siths who deal in absolutes . 
  ahhh , parking cars in circles and performing infinite `` hood slides '' . 
  we need to invent customizable , vulcanizable sports bras !, 
  just fit on your ... ehm . . assets according to your preference and start the reaction !, 
  voil\u00e0 , perfectly fitting , hard shelled breast support !, 
  what a coincidence , i bought that exact device a few days ago . 
  cave johnson would have something to say to you !, 
  joint venture con l'ausl, 
  i would n't discard your idea so quickly without even a lab test . 
  but you must take in consideration the possibility of helium shortages in the future . 
  nah , they 'll become politicians and you 'll reap the benefits in old age, 
  penultimateredcoat, 
  i want to upvote you for honesty and downvote you for being an asshole ... hmm ... 
  already did , in truth . 
  it 's just downloading, 
  it 's just downloading, 
  it 's just downloading, 
  sorry , i already took all the karma, 
  it 's not easy for you but it should be easy for men ? 
  men have to overcome many difficulties too , you know ? 
  maybe working together and not expecting the other to do all the work would be better for both , do n't you think ?
