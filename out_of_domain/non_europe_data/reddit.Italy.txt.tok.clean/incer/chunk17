  do n't know why , but this reminds me of the guy from `` i love you , man '', 
  the plastic impeller is less likely to damage your car if it breaks , i guess, 
  tyl the difference between knowing and learning, 
  my gf opens google.com every time she has to search for something using her lumia, 
  nope , she opens the url, 
  i was n't shaming her , i was just pointing out that even if the default search engine is n't google , many people are willing to take extra time to use it . 
  but do n't let your brain get in the way of an internet argument , white knight . 
  perhaps if you live and spend all of your time in a big city , and can afford to wait to get to your data ... 
  magari se la interpreti come arte vettoriale ... 
  in italy it was common ( less nowadays ) to take a nap after lunch , it 's called `` pennichella '', 
  it 's a stat !, 
  and here i thought they were talking about the scorpions, 
  if it 's like my car , it 's just a screw you have to turn, 
  i know / r/arduino is missing , that 's deliberate, 
  he 's still confused from drinking too much, 
  that happens in the media of any country , not just the us ... 
  it 's just to let people know that nobody of their acquaintances or relatives has been hurt . 
  well :, 
  1 - it 's not really in line with the others , being more entry level and so on, 
  2 - it 's much more active , and would risk flooding out the others, 
  gel cases help with big drops . 
  i know . 
  what ? 
  you own a smartphone and do n't work in an office ?!, 
  are you crazy ?!, 
  do n't you know that a factory/workshop/field is no place for a phone ? 
  leave it at home in its velvet box , ffs , do you want to waste your $ 650 investment ?!, 
  even a crappy controller helps a lot, 
  fucking misaligned paintwork, 
  uhm ... no . 
  furthermore , tests do n't let you use `` instructions '', 
  imagemagick is really a tool that 's true to its name . 
  and it 's also pretty easy to use for many things !, 
  looks _ a lot _ like my '99 gsx1200 engine, 
  it 's oil cooled ... you 'll fry in under 30 seconds, 
  yes ... if _ cooled _ can be used in this context !, 
  just kidding , it 's an absolutely great engine . 
  you know , when liquids evaporate they carry away a lot of heat ... 
  my dead dog would have ignored them as inferior peons and guarded its owner . 
  when she was alive , i mean . 
  not for the child, 
  it 's not exactly like in the movies, 
  cassonetto stupro ? 
  the one with the paint ? 
  it looks like the people care more about the wasted paint than the dead person, 
  come mai ? 
  as a biker : trust nobody on any matter on any kind of road . 
  and always drive as if you 're invisible . 
  not just on a bike . 
  saved my life a few times with people running stop signs . 
  takes all your patience not to chase them and simply kick their asses . 
  maybe we should switch to 1-month leases for phones . 
  do you like playing any sports ? 
  do you currently do any kind of exercise or physical activity ? 
  personally , it helps a lot when i 'm feeling down . 
  please ... android looks much better than that, 
  it 's just for show . 
  they all know how stuff works and no european government has the nerve to stand up to the usa . 
  they 're just doing this so they can fool their people into thinking they are actually doing something about it . 
  edit : i 'm european, 
  more like `` hi mom , how the ministry of infrastructure going ? 
  school 's great , we 're about to sign a contract with the military for those jet fighters '', 
  let 's hope so ... what if every one of those bullets hit its target ? 
  it 's not like they 've started now . 
  depends on the breed . 
  i have some which are absolutely silent unless something is attacking them, 
  it 's actually a worldwide problem . 
  it 's the same here on the other side of the atlantic . 
  who 's going to stand up to them ? 
  the uk is on their side . 
  germany is in a complicated spot , spain and italy are wrecked and so is greece , if you want to consider them . 
  switzerland is off on its own as usual and the scandinavian countries live in their own world . 
  apart from france , what other country has any significant diplomatic traction ? 
  and remember that europe still significantly relies on the usa for military protection ( even if nobody knows who we need to be protected from ) . 
  and let 's not get into commercial considerations . 
  well , while the eu countries ' governments can gain from spying on their own citizens , they also stand to lose a lot from industrial espionage ... 
  i really would n't know .

  edit : forgot the most important , whatsapp !, 
  so , is google going to start tracking cars too ? 
  search app sucks , it often gives up on me without displaying any result , even with good reception/wi-fi . 
  i use the browser 's search . 
  i can leave my phone at home . 
  but i need my car to move, 
  red button, 
  soooo ... where do you learn to speak windshield-wiper-language ? 
  ... and they say trucks are dangerous . 
  i think he 's just saying that the most intelligent people understand that being altruistic is in the best interest of the whole community , or humanity , actually . 
  thanks for the laugh , dude . 
  right when i needed it . 
  power of the radio,
