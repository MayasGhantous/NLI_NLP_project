  software keys are awkward and slow . 
  pressing the `` call '' button to open the dialer is fast and easy . 
  you know , for making calls with your _ phone _, 
  well , there is a way to know that : pressing the button . 
  now , regarding the wifi settings , that 's a different issue : putting a menu inside a menu does n't make sense . 
  yeah , but not having buttons has tradeoffs too . 
  whoa , your friend is [ gaius baltar !, 
  try getting `` two taps '' away while you 're doing something else , like at work . 
  and with speed i did not mean performance , but convenience . 
  i think that the issue is more that people are tired of whiners who expect girls to fall on their lap , asking for the honor to please their master . 
  who has n't had a `` friend '' like that , who expects the women _ they want _ to make the first move , and do n't accept anything but the best of the best , rejecting `` first-movers '' who do n't meet their excellence standard ? 
  upvotes are not enough, 
  if she does that , run the fuck away and find a more sane one . 
  could you give more details please ? 
  sounds interesting . 
  not in my opera, 
  nice clock, 
  you misunderstood and downvoted me for no reason , all i 'm saying is that some people want all their work done for them , yet feel entitled to receive attention only from supermodel material . 
  newsflash : that 's not gon na happen if you do n't get off your ass . 
  and whining about it with your friends is only going to get them annoyed at your uselessness . 
  re-read my post . 
  i 've rejected women too , when i was n't interested . 
  unfortunately there are not many sources yet . 
  here 's another one :, 
  [ fukushima-diary . com ] ( http://fukushima-diary.com/2012/02/temperature-of-reactor-2-keeps-getting-high/ ), 
  italian here , just curious : where did you travel to , in italy ? 
  and by the way : you just explained why _ attractive guys _ can _ become unattractive _ through bad behavior . 
  maybe you should balance that with an anecdote about an ugly guy who you found attractive ? 
  i 'm not saying that it ca n't happen , but it is seriously difficult . 
  and an ugly guy surely ca n't go pick up girls at the bar with a couple of lines . 
  and you met inappropriate behavior in all of those places ? 
  seems strange in venezia , and most likely to happen in roma or napoli , in my personal experience . 
  i 'd like to apologize on behalf of my nation ... 
  there are many good people here , but also real idiots and assholes ... like everywhere else , but i believe that here the difference 's more marked . 
  some years ago me and 3 friends of mine ( guys ) went to amsterdam for new year 's eve ... on a tram we met some italian guys from a different part of italy , chatted a bit and then they shocked us with rude behavior towards nearby girls , leering , speaking obscene phrases in italian and sending kisses ... 
  in a clearly disgusting way , though it 's hard to explain in a foreign language . 
  when they asked to meet up later we made it clear we were n't interested . 
  with regards to the original topic , i myself have had girls `` above my league '' , mostly because of character affinity , but they always have been _ special _ girls . 
  you know , not the kind you meet every day , usually smart people , different . 
  if i had to rely on `` normal '' girls around here , they would have never found me interesting , and looks has a big part in that . 
  i 'm not ugly , but i also am not that attractive . 
  girls always got interested in me after they got to know me , and i 've never picked up anyone at the counter ( i 'm getting better though :p ) . 
  so i agree with you that looks are n't everything , but they are certainly important . 
  for example my current girlfriend did n't interest me at first , but i fell in love after knowing her for some time . 
  and believe me , i love her as much as humanly possible , but i 'm not blind , i know i had better looking options at the time , still they completely disappeared when compared to her . 
  i would have never got to know her , though , were n't it for mutual friends . 
  i would have never approached her based on her looks ( not that she 's ugly , mind you , just not `` interesting '' enough to warrant an approach ) . 
  ** that 's the point ** . 
  thankfully fate helped us out and now it 's great :d, 
  every american christian , by the way . 
  no , it 's not . 
  just wait 5 minutes . 
  dunno , it just is n't used outside the us . 
  not in my experience anyway . 
  everywhere else there 's one symbol : the cross . 
  i wo n't feed you bullshit like `` you can be whatever you want '' , but if you do n't like what you are , you can change . 
  over time . 
  you start by forcing yourself to change little by little . 
  fake it with others . 
  it will force you to behave accordingly when in public . 
  go against your instinct . 
  after some time , you 'll become what you were pretending to be . 
  people change all the time , during all their life . 
  i have a macbook and i never had any problem with mass storage on my lg using either stock rom or cyanogen . 
  are you sure the app is n't getting killed by android 's ram management ? 
  looks like 11 cheaters downvoted you . 
  you know what gets me upset ? 
  gender battles . 
  cheating is bad . 
  both sexes cheat . 
  do n't cheat . 
  period . 
  also , from my experience in this kind of thing , the cheater 's lover knows very well of the other relationship , and while they do n't share the same amount of responsibility , they both are at fault , especially if there 's children involved . 
  * and except for rare cases , the cheater and the lover are of opposite sexes . 
  yeah , talk about your europe . 
  in my european country ( [ yes , * that * country ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italy ) ) not 20 years ago we had a ** criminal gang ** made up of policemen , which committed around 100 criminal acts , resulting in the ** death of 24 people ** and the wounding of roughly 100 more in ** 7 years of activity ** . 
  bologna , where most of this happened , is in the northern part ... you know , where they make ducati bikes ... 
  `` what 's not to like there '' regarding cops or in a broader sense ? 
  agree with the above . 
  also , do n't act awkward ... 
  it helps when you show you 're confident . 
  maybe you 're great to hang out with , and they just want to be friends ? 
  if they enjoy your company but are only looking for casual sex / short term relationship , they may be unwilling to risk damaging a good friendship . 
  maybe you have some personality trait that makes people believe that a relationship with you would be problematic . 
  maybe they 're pursuing someone else . 
  or you do n't have the right chemistry . 
  this happened to me recently , i became close friends with a girl , and she wanted more , but i just was n't interested . 
  it 's not that she 's ugly , just ... 
  i was n't attracted . 
  it 's a matter of compatibility , i think . 
  still , she 's great to be with and we still hang out together and are very close , though we both are engaged with someone else . 
  there are many reasons and ways to lash back to such a person without involving childish remarks about penis size . 
  yes it did . 
  also when the solderless modchip shifted from its correct position . 
  i wonder why we 're being downvoted . 
  in some cities there are raw milk vending machines , but that 's a minuscule part of the total market . 
  edit : kinda flaky, 
  only with poor quality jeans , and over a long time ... actually for me it 's more common for the front pockets to get worn , because of the cell phone . 
  but since a few years ago i started removing my wallet from my pocket when i sit because it annoys me . 
  maybe that 's the reason ?
