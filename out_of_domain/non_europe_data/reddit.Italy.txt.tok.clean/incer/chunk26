  depends . 
  what 's your background ? 
  do you have experience building things , dealing with electronics ? 
  do you have tools , a workshop ? 
  i just built my first printer , a p3steel , and i completely self sourced it , spending 320 $ total , excluding the smooth rods which i got at work , and maybe a few screws and bits . 
  it is n't that hard but it takes some patience . 
  yeah , and you have to edit a few values in the configuration files . 
  easy if you refer to the wiki . 
   i do n't buy this . 
  first it costs money just to assemble the kit . 
  second it presupposes that the individual ca n't source parts at aggressive prices . 
  third , it discounts creativity in doing a diy machine . 
  i agree . 
  my self-sourced p3steel cost me like a folger i3 kit would have , but with much better parts . 
  and an ikea lamp !,

  i 'm still new to this , just started printing last week ... 
  i 'd like to get some suggestions !, 
  ^ ( sorry for the picture quality , i had no time for the camera , had to use my phone ), 
  i bought two extra from the start , feeling mighty wise at the moment :d,
