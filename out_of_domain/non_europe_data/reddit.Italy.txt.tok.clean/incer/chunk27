  it needs better headlights and a different bumper , other than that it 's not so bad, 
   also , i had a skirt , but took it off before i took the picture . 
  sexy . 
  great for everything , except for the camera, 
  you can use www.trovaprezzi.it , otherwise amazon is a bit more expensive than most online shops but is simpler . 
  and you do n't need google translate , we all speak english , we 're on reddit after all , 
  yes it is . 
  some examples :, 
  - galaxy s6 : [ amazon ] ( http://www.amazon.it/gp/offer-listing/b00x5tjun6/ref=dp_olp_new?ie=utf8&amp;condition=new ) - [ others ] ( http://www.trovaprezzi.it/prezzo_cellulari_galaxy_s6.aspx ),

  detonate over a river, 
  abs@240c + heated bed, 
  it did that before it even finished printing ... 
  hi all , i do n't really have a question , i 'd just like to tell you that i travel a lot for work , and the best hospitality i ever received in 12 years doing this job all over the world was in greece . 
  so thank you guys and stay strong !, 
  ma mamma !, 
  well , the only problems i have with my phone are the camera performance and the frail glass ... 
  problems that it shares with loads of other phones , so ... 
  well , there 's a few , but people do n't buy them , so maybe there 's no market ? 
  it 's their modus operandi , they have one for gog , too, 
  i watched the original version of that movie instead of the dubbed version in my language ... 
  i barely understood anything of what he said, 
  cheap keyboard + youtube , may not be like a piano teacher but kids learn easily , and also teaches them how to extract information without hand-holding . 
  you can also ask questions to the videos ' authors , they 'll probably be happy to help . 
  or more likely , sea, 
  check your z height and bed leveling , the nozzle may be scraping the printed brim and causing your printer to miss steps, 
  that would have been 500000 lire ... 
  1 $ was 1936 lire, 
  da means from , di means of, 
  dicaprio does n't really need to mean anything , last names get mangled over the generations , especially for emigrants, 
  maybe they have a commented version they kept for themselves, 
  * as reported by someone on reddit *, 
  there 's triangulation and there 's ... * barnaculation * . 
  what ? 
  where ? 
  since when ? 
  ah , muddy waters ' less ... charming cousin, 
  their looks do n't appeal me much . 
  and what 's up with all those photos of the phone showing the app drawer ? 
  it makes them look like iphones , it 's ugly, 
  you 'd need a programming device , though . 
  with the arduino it 's already included , then you can remove the mcu from the board and program another one . 
  but you 'll need to add an oscillator at least , while other mcus have oscillators on-board and stuff . 
  they just have to save enough money made through their minimum-wage-job to pay for their studies . 
  simple . 
  powerful people need to control peasants in order to maintain their lifestyle ... 
  in a robotised future peasants are not needed anymore,
