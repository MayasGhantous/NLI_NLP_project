  do you also happen to enjoy the sound of nails on a blackboard ? 
  my girlfriend 's z1c shows greatly improved battery life in stamina mode , my z3c not so much . 
  i have one but i still hate having my phone face down on a surface . 
  glass protectors are n't cheap either by the way, 
  libreoffice keeps getting better and better . 
  makes me wish i could do more than just donate a bit of money to the project . 
  you 'd need pre-configured systems . 
  on a professional level , outside of it almost no one wants to waste precious time installing and configuring an os, 
  well , in italy when my z3c came out it was cheaper than any other comparable phone . 
  now , on the other hand , those other phones have a lower price while the z3c still keeps the same price . 
  smoothness ? 
  my own is pretty smooth , i 've never seen it stutter or lag . 
  i do n't know how it could be any more smooth . 
  * sospiro *, 
  that one was just a fetishist, 
  well , if you 're from the usa you do n't need to worry . 
  not as much unexploded ordnance laying around as in europe . 
  well , maybe he likes being entertained . 
  anyway i have arch on my fileserver too , it 's worked flawlessly for a few years now . 
  it 's like the best argument ever , actually . 
  survival is the priority for any species . 
  people will talk a lot about this but i 'm happy that marquez is out . 
  he was hitting rossi all the time . 
  self defense, 
  yep . 
  it was deliberate , marquez kept hitting him , so he forced a physical confrontation where he knew marquez would do it again and used it to make him crash . 
  he probably made it inside the rules too , knowing him . 
  edit : i meant that rossi deliberately crashed marquez, 
  rewind and watch the confrontation again . 
  lorenzo slips by and marquez does nothing , then comes rossi and the fight comes to him , they keep overtaking , marquez slides dangerously all over the place in most overtakes , and even hits him . 
  it 's dirty , i agree with you , from a sportsmanship pov it 's crap , from a personal pov marquez was being a little shit and got what came to him . 
  i 'm sad , because i feel like this ruined the championship . 
  `` italian gesture '' ? 
  where the fuck did you get that from ? 
  i 'm italian and that gesture just looked like a `` come with me and let 's catch those in front '' gesture to me . 
  it looks mighty weird, 
  dorna owns wsbk too , now . 
  drinking in public places ? 
  that 's what he was trying to do, 
  yeah well that 's unlikely, 
  it would be risky for marquez to play the same trick three times in a row, 
  i think this would be his chance to `` prove '' that what rossi is saying is n't true . 
  this whole matter exploded , and if he helps lorenzo again even the staunchest deniers could n't say anything anymore . 
  everything depends on whether pedrosa can keep his pace up . 
  the fans , the image of the sport , and so on . 
  i do n't think he wants to be booed on every circuit for the rest of his career . 
  if he really wanted to win he would n't have wasted all that time battling rossi, 
  let 's hope that aprilia 's roadplan goes well , i 'd like to see another real contender to the hondas,

  and the fireworks, 
  that 's because you 're full of shit , there are loads of 4 door pickups in europe , mitsubishi l200 , toyota hilux , nissan pickup , nissan navara ... 
  even volkswagen makes a 4 door pickup , the amarok . 
  as an italian who 's main drive has been a renault trafic for a few years , let me tell you that you 'd be surprised where you can get with a big car in most european cities !, 
  holy shit * giant cups of coffee !!,

   yamaha has the best package at the moment , and both their riders are fighting for the championship . 
  i do n't think yamaha has the best bike . 
  i think they have a good bike with the best riders . 
   dnfs look very promising, 
  are you kidding ? 
  then we 'd have to hear him moan for the rest of our lives, 
  i 'd say `` fool '' or `` idiot '' except that it 's more offensive, 
  i 'm guessing people just want to `` settle the score '' , an eye for an eye , you know ? 
  and one thing most commenters do n't realize is that there 's a difference between this hypothetical situation and marquez ' behavior , between hindering one racer to help another and hindering a racer to make him lose ; the first is born out of goodwill towards a person , the second is born out of hate ... of course most people react better to the first one ( and they do n't even realize why ), 
  i for one just hope that everyone races at the best of their abilities , we might still have a chance , albeit very slim , to see a battle between the two title contenders . 
  there are countries that use imperial , and then there are counties that put a robot on a ** comet ** , 
  yet , anyone who ever designed a pcb knows what a mil is , and calling millimeters mils is a very stupid thing to do . 
  it 's more likely that the guy made a mistake when writing . 
  source : european , learned about mils during pcb design class in high school,

  this is motorcycle racing , not football . 
  no capes !, 
  the video, 
  yeah i 'm familiar , i was just letting you know about the video, 
  i think some context is needed for reggiani , as not everyone might know this . 
  reggiani has been a commenter for on the italian ( free private ) television together with guido meda . 
  meda is like rossi 's number one fan , he 's the voice of the passion most italians have for rossi , even in the recent years when the latter was lacking results , during the races meda always mentioned him and his position multiple times . 
  at one point reggiani left the tv job , citing a salary reduction and an excessively `` rossi-centric '' mindset as the reasons . 
  now that the rights for airing motogp have gone to the subscription - based satellite tv `` sky '' , reggiani is back in the tv world , not as a commenter but as a regular guest at the post-race show `` race anatomy '' . 
  i say all of this because , watching him on tv , it feels like a bit of meda 's fanaticism rubbed off on him , even if he 's naturally a bit more impartial , and he may be afraid of sounding too much anti-rossi , for various reasons that you can easily imagine . 
  oh and by the way , meda is now assisted in commenting duty by none other than loris capirossi . 
  who rocks . 
  a ( new ) dell xps 15 with more usb ports , an ethernet port and a reversible screen,

  a message that everyone can agree to, 
  if you 're in races , italian is a very useful language to know . 
  in motogp too . 
  i 've met a polish guy with a roman accent,

  bike bike to ever bike the bike in the bike, 
  edit : getting semantic satiation, 
  well , hell must have pretty good infrastructure and machinery then , the french engineers are among the world 's best . 
  well , i love japanese cars above all others , but i also think french cars get a bad rep out of preconception . 
  i had a renault trafic as my main drive for a few years , and apart from the cheap plastics kinda falling off sometimes , the rest of the car was pretty solid . 
  the engine never needed any kind of work for 200000km . 
  i know it 's not the usual `` french small car '' we 're talking about here , but still ... also i 've always loved the renault espace , and i drove a peugeot 407 for some time that was pretty nice to .
