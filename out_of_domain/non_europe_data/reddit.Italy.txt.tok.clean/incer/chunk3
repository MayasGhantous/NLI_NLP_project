  perhaps you should specify a time frame , as jeans for me hardly last more than 2 years ... 
  i 'm kinda rough towards them . 
  would n't care . 
  also , if it 's like the picture , it 's not very noticeable unless in full light ... 
  which is rare in the kind of situations we 're considering here . 
  man here , i 'd like to say that while porn excites me , when i 'm `` finishing '' i always end up fantasizing ( recalling ) about my girl . 
  not voluntarily , mind you . 
  i had a couple of wranglers and they lasted quite long . 
  i found levi 's to be kind of short-lived ( and expensive ! ) . 
  i have a pair of lee that are still going strong after 3-4 years , i think . 
  other than that i buy local ( italian ) jeans , so i would n't know that to recommend . 
  maybe you could just patch them ? 
  if you do it from the inside , it does n't stand out so much , and on `` ruined '' jeans it 's even stylish if he 's into that kind of look . 
  i know it 's probably easier to buy new ones , but i hate to throw away stuff :p, 
  works better if task n. 2 ( wifi set off ) is set to only work * if * % wifi * equals * on, 
  maybe you should edit your reply to make it clear you were talking about being hit on * at work *, 
  this would be a constantly transmitting drone . 
  it 's like playing hide-n-seek while constantly screaming . 
  uhm ... 
  i do n't think so . 
  i always interpreted the arrests as the police doing something , not the government . 
  i think that `` wagga wagga '' is a great name for a settlement . 
  catholics are christians, 
  the boundaries would be the world . 
  for now at least :p, 
  my van 's backside door can only be opened with the button on the trunk and has no lock , only auto . 
  one day the plastic thing connecting the solenoid to the lock broke . 
  not fun . 
  the spare took 10 days to arrive . 
  the mythical bad parking card , passed around since the dawn of time !, 
  * `` you do n't have permission to access / catholics.htm on this server . 
  that 's racist . 
  i 've always been under the impression that the police here works despite the government ... 
  thank you for your lesson about * my country 's * police forces , but first of all you did n't understand the meaning of my comment , and secondly the arrests have been performed by the guardia di finanza , which is ** not ** run by the department of public security , nor its parent , the ministry of interior , but from the ministry of economy . 
  the article is missing a detail : they were tax court judges . 
  i 'd rather have a paulaner or schneider . 
  i 'm quite serene actually , i 'm just trying to get my point across ( without succeeding ) . 
  it is true that the first minister can influence the police through the ministry of interior , the gdf through the ministry of economy and the carabinieri through the ministry of defense , but those police forces must retain some degree of independence , and that 's why i 've always believed that they try and do their job despite the government . 
  and the `` blitz '' in cortina was just a show to lull people , pretending that god knows what big change was taking place , while in reality this government 's job ( which no one elected ) is just trying to somewhat fix the state 's accounts so that our beloved political caste can live on our backs for a few more years . 
  edit : and just to be clear , i 'm not the one who downvoted you . 
  i changed that to invoke qr droid, 
  well , qr droid starts straight in camera mode . 
  but it 's extra insurance : if the phone does n't satisfy you but it can be rooted/flashed , you can always try to fix it . 
  i think i will buy my next smartphone by picking it from the ones in [cyanogenmod.com/devices] ( http://www.cyanogenmod.com/devices ), 
  [ these ?

  wow ... now i 'll have to try that ... on someone else of course .

  thank you , somehow the automated system did not engage the security protocols listed in directive 396 . b. . . 
  it could have been a disaster !, 
  agree , stress is a big problem in those kind of things , in my experience . 
  pretty common actually . 
  every pizzeria has it . 
  they know about the plan , and they are going to strike just before we have the chance . 
  it 'll go from eating out of our hands to eating our hands out !, 
  i 'd like to know too . 
  yeah , it 's not like we have other jobs that we perform correctly , expecting other professionals to do the same . 
  its legs look like fingers, 
  well , if you stink , yes , i 'll be glad if you 'll stay away from me . 
  i have the decency to make sure i do n't spread disgusting smells when i 'm in public , i just expect other people to do the same . 
  the same goes for any physical attribute on both sexes . 
  you 're a short man ? 
  tough luck . 
  you 're ugly ? 
  strange chin/nose/eyes etc ? 
  short legs ? 
  it 's all the same . 
  we 've all got to do with what we have . 
  and in the end , cup size is not as relevant as many people make it sound . 
  if you 're very beautiful but flat chested , you can still pick up people at the bar/club at will . 
  if you have an ugly/bent face ? 
  not likely , even with a large chest . 
  unless he 's seriously drunk/stoned etc. 
  but ... 
  battery life ? 
  i know , and it also has the fifth ( smaller ) core for powersaving , but i wo n't believe it until i see extensive tests . 
  i was actually more thinking about phones than tablets , the prime does n't even have a cellular connection , does it ? 
  oh god , you 'll have to explain my gf why i 'm never having sex again ...

  my htc p3600 would like to disagree . 
  as would many other winmo phones . 
  they did n't have the prettiest interfaces , but they worked , and did many more things than the original iphone .

  agree . 
  but that does n't work on gonewild . 
  probably it was n't their choice . 
  i do n't know about other countries , but here in italy if a dog performs certain acts of aggression it must be put down , according to the law . 
  looking is not raping . 
  if i went out with revealing clothes i would not get annoyed at people looking at me , as it was my choice to do so . 
  if you do n't want people looking at your skin , just dress yourself accordingly . 
  and regarding your post below , looking at a person you find attractive is simply a natural reaction , not necessarily sexual and most definitely ** not ** objectifying , ffs !, 
  i look at my gf 's `` assets '' all the time , and she 's not an object to me ** for sure !, 
  and , by the way , boobs and asses are not the only attractive parts in a woman , what about your face ? 
  your hair ? 
  legs ?
