  breast enhancement is a bit more practical than lip frisbees, 
  shit , and here i am , unable to force myself to get rid of half-broken ancient computers that i have no use for ... 
  if it 's a laptop it 'll probably break at least partially before then, 
  at that point you 'd be better off buying a chromebook , would n't you ? 
  modifications to the main ( c  partition tend to break the windows installation, 
  well , we keep asking for cheap energy ... 
  i use cinnamon with my uhd xps 15 and it works great . 
  some apps will still be problematic though . 
  personally i watched it multiple times , it definitely looks like the typical `` ma che cazzo fai ?! '', 
  italian gesture, 
  he had a choice between eliminating the yamaha team by hitting rossi , or eliminating ducati by hitting his teammate . 
  he failed with rossi ( and made them both lose their positions to dovizioso ) , so he went to the next in line . 
  [ no , i think he did it in the 5 seconds it took him to slide to that point . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqrxsa5kamq ), 
  me too, 
  edit : oh and by the way , i found myself sliding after a crash too , and time really slows down . 
  this exchange makes me very sad . 
  yeah so the ducatis have more power and stress the tires more , riders from other manufacturers complain that they have been penalyzed for this , but if the rules require the use of specific tires , i think those specific tires have to be able to work on all bikes . 
  if the brake hits something your bike brakes and you crash, 
  italy . 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  i 'd say the trick is getting in the right line of work ... 
  mine is great . 
  and i 'm actually working with it . 
  as in paid work !, 
  so it 's not just sitting on the desk looking pretty . 
  even melted it 's still shit `` cheese '', 
  boh , io mi diverto a fare shopping, 
  yeah , my gf is my heatsink . 
  the problem with my xps is that it takes forever to get to the bootloader, 
  boom, 
  now you see why i , as an occasional visitor to the usa , am a bit worried about your government having all of my fingerprints on record . 
  that would explain the troubles he had, 
  airports can be misleading , for example american airports have the tsa treating you like shit , but it 's often because they 're treated like shit themselves . 
  maybe the guy you spoke to just spent the day arguing with retards in english and was sick of it . 
  but no less either !, 
  not sure that would have helped, 
  dovi does n't get along well with rossi, 
  ordine per numero di poligoni, 
  edit : e trovati un ` amica femmina . 
  also , a championship win by rossi would be a gold mine for yamaha , so it 's in their interests to not penalize him , however slim his chances may be,

  and power locks, 
  where i live ( italy ) , many traffic lights turn flashing orange during the night when there 's little traffic , and they become like normal intersections, 
  as a warning . 
  `` take the intersection carefully '', 
  traffic lights are very rarely turned off completely here , when they are disabled they always flash orange, 
  thank you , i 'm not comfortable leaving reddit and imgur . 
  in his off time from building a time machine to stop the soviets, 
  we should blend them and see what comes out, 
  i think that was the one caused by the charger . 
  i 'm on the latest bios anyway . 
  and failed prints do n't have as big an impact, 
  because cinnamon is fast , looks good and works well . 
  claims that no other desktop at the moment can make . 
  lots of negativity in this thread . 
  very disappointing , as cinnamon is really a great desktop , i was using it on my previous computer and now that i 've made the switch to a new 4k , touch enabled laptop , i found that it works better than most other offerings here too . 
  which is funny because it was forked to get away from all the touchscreen bullshit . 
  my xps 9550 started out with windows problems , which were quickly solved ( and i barely use windows at all , my main os is linux ) , and has been a dream until last week when it encountered the throttling bug . 
  solved the next day , back to working like a champ . 
  i use this laptop for work and personal use , so i 'd say at least 8 hours a day , more like 10-12 probably , and it 's been wonderful . 
  i think the throttling bug was caused by overheating , i was working in a very hot and damp place , and had placed a plastic bag on my laptop to protect it from water splashes ; i was working on other stuff ( i build industrial machinery as a job , i use the laptop to program it ) , and when i came back to it , it was scalding hot . 
  i noticed right away something was wrong as the computer became so slow to be almost unusable . 
  [ i solved it this way . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dell/comments/4fzng2/another_way_to_deal_with_the_thermal_throttling/ ) it 's not a real solution as the bug may present itself again , but at least i know how to deal with it . 
  and honestly , overheating this laptop is freaking difficult as it 's got very good dissipation . 
  in fact it took extreme environmental conditions while running very taxing software to overheat it . 
  in truth , i believe the main problem with this laptop is that the skylake architecture is still young and the software supporting it is buggy . 
  both in windows and linux . 
  funnily , linux seems to work better on it , except for the poor battery life . 
  i expect that time and updates will further improve performance . 
  gnome looks like shit , plasma is slow compared to cinnamon and xfce requires customization to get it to the same level .

  beware : low quality pizzerias ( few in italy , more outside ) use '' [ pizza cheese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pizza_cheese ) '' instead of mozzarella , which is a variety of [ processed cheese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/processed_cheese ) . 
  processed cheese has the fame of being oftentimes made with `` recycled '' dairy products , and despite everyone denying that , there is truth in that belief ( i work with the dairy industry ) . 
  so choose your pizzerias carefully . 
  would be hard to digest, 
  [ maybe you could ask them ] ( http://www.dainese.com/eu_en/contacts/ ), 
  unsold products , stuff close to expiration or sometimes already expired , stuff that did n't come out right . 
  they use the excuse of pasteurization , which kills bacteria , to justify reusing stuff that they could n't otherwise .

  honestly , if you install arch a lot , you 're doing something wrong . 
  you 're either screwing up your system regularly ( and fixing it with a reinstall is n't ideal ) , or deploying many machines , in which case you would probably use a different distro .
