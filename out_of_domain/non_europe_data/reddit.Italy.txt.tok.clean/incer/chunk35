  i loved mass effect 1 , 2 and 3 , but one got to agree with everybody that the ending really let it down . 
  better than spraining your face, 
  what ? 
  lorenzo ca n't battle cleanly ? 
  you guys need to adjust your monitor 's contrast, 
  so conflicted , i like too many riders in this class !, 
  well , he 's there watching his own team, 
  bulega was also still in pain from yesterday, 
   mods of god, 
  i have both the z3c and z5c and the former is better, 
  e le norme sanitarie ? 
  decent . 
  cinnamon works great with hidpi . 
  what , ca n't he recommend trying out a ** free ** product based on the fame it has in the community ? 
  gimp has a terrible fame , honestly . 
  and anyway it 's free , anybody can try it out an simply uninstall it if they do n't like it . 
  finally !, 
  lorenzo may want to make sure to run away at every race this year , because if iannone ever catches up with him , he 'll do whatever to make him familiarize with the exhausts of his future bike . 
  none . 
  source : am op, 
  you still need to get from the train station to your destination, 
  people pay taxes in exchange for services : once they 're dead they do n't need services anymore, 
  the ** other guy ** had other stuff to do , and fenteke understood exactly what i meant . 
  you , on the other hand , undestood fuck all . 
  wtf , can you even read ? 
  off the road , on private land , you can ride and drive whatever you want , but on the road you need to be at least 14 to ride 50cc bikes or mopeds ( scooters ) . 
  and there are a lot of 14 year olds who love modding and upgrading their scooters/bikes . 
  and then do stupid things with them . 
  it looked like it was planned by both of them . 
  they most likely had an agreement . 
  never said there was , no need to be defensive, 
  misleading title , does n't sound mad, 
  well that statistic ca n't keep on forever . 
  the more italians on the podium , the better the fun for those attending the race at the track . 
  a sacrifice to the racing gods, 
  the sky team 's special livery is pretty cool , too bad that the scribblings are just tv show names . 
  tell balda that everyone thinks he 's been amazing this sunday !, 
  and full of coagulated blood, 
  do you ... eat it afterwards ? 
  both companies are owned by volkswagen , after all . 
  simoncelli 's crash happened on screen, 
  i do n't think it was because people would wonder about decapitation , more like people already saw it so there was no point in hiding it . 
  what the others said , and also of course once you own it , you 'll have to pay the property tax every year like a car , and that depends on the power of the engine and the emission standard it meets ( likely euro 1 or something ) . 
  and watch it roll down the slightest slope , in a city that was n't built on ground levelled by modern machinery . 
  just become a dad yourself , problem solved, 
  getting conquered by turkey could actually be a quick way out of the eu . 
   tourism dollars, 
  tourism eypos, 
  except being bad-ass, 
  i use it and it works , though in linux sometimes it disconnects . 
  if you only need ethernet , you may be better off with a generic usb3 gigabit adapter . 
  wait , do you need a secondary hdmi ? 
  do n't know about the xps 13 but there 's already one on board the xps 15 . 
  except that they 're little more than paperweights, 
   i use this one , because shiny but there are some dirt cheap versions out there . 
  hey that 's the one i use too , it works great , and the additional usb ports are handy , it even runs two 2.5 '' drives at the same time which is n't a given most of the time . 
  too bad . 
  yeah , no options for him , he was sandwiched between the other bike and the edge of the track , and it 's not like he could have tightened the curve anymore anyway . 
  he 's probably angry right now . 
  you mean app le, 
  the three-way differential could potentially cost more than the whole car, 
  i ca n't get draftsight to work right , it 's so slow it 's unusable on my linux install, 
  i use arch too , and your comment made me reinstall draftsight . 
  it seems to have improved since the last time , but the mouse still has an infuriating lag . 
  too bad . 
  also i do n't know if it 's my qt config or what but it does n't seem to support hidpi, 
  dell xps , expensive but not unreasonably so . 
  it 's for work also . 
  i remember an interview to rossi himself in which he said that lorenzo needs a less `` perfect '' bike than him to get good results . 
  i think it was an interview for the italian sky tv motogp channel from last year . 
  i do n't know if it can be found online somewhere , and it would be in italian ... do you understand it ? 
  tough guy acts aside , usually i either talk to their supervisor or find someone to keep them entertained . 
  also , communication helps . 
  even if they do n't understand , explain what you 're trying to solve and why you need to solve it . 
  of course if someone 's a chronic asshole , there 's not much you can do . 
  nope sorry i 'm on a business trip , i 'll look once i get home , but it 's unlikely that i 'll be able to find it, 
  unfortunately no , and even when i go to cool places it 's all work and no fun :(, 
  and there 's an option to disable that, 
  at my pool they had this same setup , the idea was that you were supposed to close the tap when you were done , but if you forgot it did n't keep running uselessly . 
  it was a pain in the ass . 
  ... you could always tear it open, 
  [ not op , but ... ] ( http://pastebin.com/x4zpyrbr ), 
  this is from my laptop running 4.6 p, 
  and design it with some degree of redundancy, 
  or masturbate, 
  i drive stick . 
  ... wait . 
  well , read your contract and see if it 's tacitly renewed or not ... 
  i 'm also pretty sure they ca n't be kicked out without going through a judge , even with an expired contract , and in italy that means months . 
   unlike ubuntu gnome and kde neon , linuxmint did install . 
  but cinnamon did n't scale for the hidpi screen and i had to bring the resolution down to 1920x1080 in order to make everything look ok . 
  weird . 
  cinnamon works great with my 4k xps 15 . 
  italy too, 
  i 've been using it since before 3.0 and it already supported hidpi ... maybe it 's mint that 's using a defective configuration . 
  i do n't understand what problem you 're having with thunderbird, 
  [ have you seen `` the 100 year-old man who climbed out the window and disappeared '' ? 
  as an arch user i do n't say what distro i use anymore . 
  ... well , except in this case . 
  it 's actually nice once you get used to it,
