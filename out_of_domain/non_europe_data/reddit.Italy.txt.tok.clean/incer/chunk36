  they make the xps 15 which i have and love . 
  it 's the size of a 14 '' laptop , has an amazing display and packs a lot of punch . 
  but the xps 15 is smaller than the usual 15 '' laptops , and it 's actually the perfect size for me . 
  i 'm running arch , now on kernel 4.6 , everything kind of worked out of the box except bluetooth , i had to swap out the network card for that . 
  the first few months i had some performance issues as the hardware was n't very well supported , but with each new kernel release it got better . 
  battery life is still a problem but it 's improving . 
  some people report outstanding results with optimization but i have n't been able to replicate that , so i 'm not sure . 
  mine is kind of a desktop replacement so it 's not a big deal . 
  there have been lots of complaints about build quality ( just check out / r/dell ) but mine 's been perfect from the start . 
  some people complain about the shallow keyboard but i got used to it pretty quickly and i like it . 
  i got the 4k touch version with 32gb ssd + 1tb hdd ... 
  the hdd was garbage , but i had already planned to swap out both of them and i did , got a samsung 950 pro and put in my old laptop 's 1tb 840 evo . 
  the screen is , honestly , incredibly good looking , reading text , code and so on is a pleasure . 
  the touchscreen is very cool too , but i have to admit that win10 does a better job of using it . 
  i 'm still trying to figure out video drivers , and watching videos in firefox hogs my cpu and kills my battery . 
  the touchpad is very nice and big , in windows it sucks because of weird drivers , under linux it 's much better . 
  hidpi support is getting good , and i love cinnamon on this laptop . 
  ironically it 's among the best desktops for the touchscreen . 
  all in all i like it , but you 've got to know that skylake support still is n't perfect , and 4 times as many pixels take more processing power , so some applications might be slow . 
  next thing i plan to try is move from virtualbox to kvm for my work vm and use gpu pass-through to make it more usable . 
  you 're welcome . 
  i like it, 
  [ i 've got this sleeve and it 's great ] ( http://adorejune.com/others/dell/dell-laptops/700/classic-case-for-dell-xps-15-2015-black/ ) , fits like a glove and is quite thick . 
  ... vedremo . 
  it 's one of the possible names . 
  it 's actually centaur ( s ) , as centurion would be a roman military commander , 
  holy . 
  shit . 
  what a race !, 
  i ca n't wait to see these guys in the upper classes . 
  edit : the italian commentator literally ran out of voice . 
  midori is meant to be super-lightweight , it 's for low performance devices . 
  epiphany is gnome 's browser , it 's made to be integrated into their desktop . 
  vivaldi is an experimental browser in its starting stages . 
  hope i answered your `` whys '', 
  oh look , the usual guy who tried ** openoffice ** 7 years ago and thinks that libreoffice is still the same . 
  maybe you could try something like fedora or opensuse , they 're probably friendlier than debian, 
   air-gap, 
  is there really as big a difference between the north and the south of italy as people say ? 
  where would the north/south dividing line be ? 
  naples ? 
  everyone has their own opinion , and usually , the further north one lives , the further north the `` divide '' is . 
  i have heard there is a large underground economy in italy . 
  is that why italy 's economic numbers look poor ? 
  are people better off than they are letting on in economic studies ? 
  some are , some are n't . 
  as for the numbers it 's a difficult question , i guess they would be much higher if we counted the various mafias ' illegal trades , but those are illegal after all . 
  how big is your immigration problem ? 
  are you dealing with it effectively right now ? 
  or is it a big problem ? 
  immigration rate varies by area , in my town there 's always been a lot of foreigners so i 'm not seeing much difference . 
  in the city i think there 's more , lots of african guys dealing drugs too . 
  i do n't care much as long as they do n't cause trouble . 
  i 'm not sure what `` dealing with it '' would mean . 
  i think that as long as everyone respects the law , the only risk is losing `` our identity '' , but that 's a matter i 'd rather leave to more enlightened minds than mine . 
  does your economy seem ok to you , or does it seem like you are having a bad economy . 
  it 's bad . 
  there 's little work right now , and i live in one of the richest areas . 
  i think that in the past many companies developed and kept afloat thanks to the economic growth , and now that it 's gone only the properly built companies can survive . 
  a bit of natural selection but also a bit of pointless extermination . 
  the main issue are taxes , honestly . 
  they strangle our economy . 
  draftsight is very buggy on linux, 
  usually those who live on the alps draw the line at the po river , leaving out emilia romagna ( ! ), 
  regulations are necessary , and yes some of them are stupid and hinder work , but they 're not the real problem . 
  it 's the tax rate , i mean , our tax to gdp ratio ( according to the national statistical institute , which may be a bit biased ) was 43.5 % in 2015 . 
  that 's a lot , but it 's in line with other eu countries , if it were n't that those other countries actually ** get their investment back ** , while ours goes down the shitter . 
  and having owned a business in the past , i laugh at that 40 % figure . 
  dude , emilia romagna has the nation 's third greatest gdp per capita . 
  germany actually has a pretty similiar ratio , just like france , etc. 
  there is talk about leaving the eu , but only from fringe parties right now , and it would be suicide , we live on exports . 
  oh , ciao reddit hivemind, 
   italy is like the lazy user which prefers to clic one thousand time a pop-up window instead of disabling it . 
  it 's more like a user who finds a way to disable the popup but ignores the cause of said popup . 
  we do n't like useless labor . 
  people from mantova and cremona have much more in common with those from emilia than with those from upper lombardy, 
  ha , so that 's why ... 
  well , they could just use the ground pin and leave the others disconnected, 
  in my ( rural ) area we 've got 30mbps wimax, 
  shit lens, 
  twisted sister !, 
  well , just start somewhere . 
  it 's all a matter of experience . 
  of course asking around about a specific issue will help a lot . 
  knowledge compounds , so the more you learn , the easier it 'll be to learn more . 
  no no its alien living flying saucers that come and help them, 
  it 's my time to eat you , fucking mosquitoes !, 
  it 's not an hybrid drive , it 's actually two different drives : an m. 2 ssd and a sata hdd . 
  you should only see the 1tb hdd , with the ssd acting as cache behind the scenes , but if you disabled intel raid in the bios , it 'll show you the ssd as a normal disk . 
  i , for example , swapped the m. 2 with a 512gb ssd and the sata 1tb hdd with a 1tb sata ssd , and disabled raid to use them both separately . 
  i ca n't remember now and i ca n't reboot as i 'm compiling a kernel . 
  [ ask google . 
  ] ( https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=xps%20enable%20intel%20raid%20ssd ) beware that if you change the storage setup , it 's likely that windows will refuse to boot . 
  well , the mechanical drive is horribly slow , so the ssd cache should make your laptop a bit faster ( after a while ) . 
  maybe there 's a way to change the config without consequences , but i did n't care enough to find out , i simply reinstalled windows as i was going to do anyway . 
  i 'd contact customer support first of all , see what they tell you . 
  brevetto ? 
  i 've got that one and it 's great . 
  fits very snugly . 
  he recognizes it as italian territory !,
