  or he 'll shoot you, 
  e star citizen !, 
  it 's not like the turkish military would just allow them to waltz into their bases as the iraqi one did, 
  even decimated , turkey 's military would easily defeat isis , we 're talking about a proper military here , not a bunch of guys with guns mounted on reposessed pickup trucks, 
  sooo ... who 's wondering whether yamaha 's really undoing a few screws on jorge 's bike ? 
  yeah , he 's pushing harder because the bike is n't performing :p, 
  uh ... dude ... are you even following ? 
  exactly , thank you . 
  i was talking about jorge 's bike , not rossi 's , come on it 's one simple sentence . 
  i was joking that yamaha 's sabotaging lorenzo 's bike , not rossi 's . 
  do you need me to illustrate with a sketch ? 
  he 's not known for his niceties, 
  vale listen to your team ffs !, 
  marc earned this win , and he 's earning the championship , working hard and smart . 
  yeah looks like panic, 
  the xps 15 is very compact and portable and is a viable alternative for portability, 
   infatti ci sono i determinati con tanto di part time . 
  culture shock for me is coming to america and never finding recycling bins around . 
  after a while i notice i 'm hoarding plastic bottles and paper bags cause it does n't occur to me to throw them in the trash . 
  they 're also in search of a plane, 
  i will , thanks for the support !, 
  fuck american airlines , they canceled my flight for `` bad weather '' while all the other airlines were flying merrily , and left me stranded without my baggage because they had already loaded it on a previous flight . 
  they did n't pay for the hotel `` because they do n't reimburse costs when the flight is cancelled for weather reasons '' . 
  except that the weather was n't that bad it seems ... 
  the problem is that they cancelled multiple flights ( all of them maybe ? 
  i ca n't recall ) for different destinations at the same time , and it was only aa who did that . 
  there are . 
  aside from better knives , they also use a kind of platform with a metal wire that gets tensioned and cuts through, 
  he just launched the crumbs he picked up with the cloth on the table behind him,

  stp being a fuckingdick, 
  some were for my same destination , but hey , you know everything , so you already knew that . 
  so what you 're telling me is that aa has worse planes than the competition ? 
  guess what , sounds like a good reason to avoid them anyway . 
  i do n't know , the gals at the rebooking desk were real assholes , but i was the n-hundredth customer they dealt with , and i was n't even among the last in line , so i do n't think making a scene would have helped . 
  can you imagine everybody 's reaction of they accommodated just a few among the crowd ? 
  yeah , given that this was the second bad experience with aa , i 'll do my best to avoid them, 
  the similarities with human-built machinery are fascinating . 
  is this knowledge recent ? 
  i 'm wondering how much inspiration engineers have had from nature . 
  i mean , in many cases there are obviously advantageous solutions that may come up both by evolution and design , but it makes me wonder . 
  that 's vittoriano guareschi , ducati 's former team manager, 
  we have dismissed that claim . '',

  catastrofe here we come, 
  i have a 4k laptop and a 4k 28 '' external monitor , switching back and forth is very annoying, 
  yes, 
  and bald eagles, 
  it still gets very hot in the keyboard area , i mean , it 's not a problem for the laptop , but for your fingers it is !, 
  yep . 
  also , who 's the idiot who connects the detonator before the bomb is in place ? 
  all it takes is a message from your provider to blow you up . 
  i have one to ... 
  if only i had something to connect to it ... 
  when servicing phones stops being profitable ? 
  everything that is n't programming tools . 
  hell , in my case , even programming for industrial automation requires software that only runs on windows . 
  i have that setup and it just works !, 
  well , cinnamon anyway . 
  io due !, 
  [ the italian sky tv had a sketch where they showed pirro filling in for various roles such as cameraman , sound engineer , commentator ... ] ( http://video.sky.it/sport/motogp/michele_pirro_un_pilota_tuttofare_in_pista_e_non_solo/v290673.vid ), 
  l'importante \u00e8 come ti senti tu dentro di te, 
  you do n't pour espresso . 
  in my area they 're currently picking tomatoes , and the other day i saw a crane rescue a truck trailer whose front `` stand '' ( i do n't know what it 's called ) had sunk in the ground . 
  it was n't muddy or anything , but field ground is n't very hard / compacted . 
  maybe he got caught spying for another team or something, 
  edit : from an interview with vale it sounds like romano 's been an asshole one too many times, 
  idk , i thought that the punishment seemed a bit harsh for just behavior issues, 
  that 's why you do n't put the price on the packaging but on the shelf, 
  well , that photo does n't prove anything of the above , it just proves that a baby was put on a bayonet once, 
  my 200 meters point to point wifi link made with two 15 $ tp-link access points pings about the same . 
  i 'm pretty satisfied . 
  i 'm not joking , it does n't prove that the japanese soldiers had a game where they threw babies on bayonets . 
  your guys did great . 
  holt mvp . 
  good move, 
  looks like hunger games . 
  no thanks !, 
  if a building is old enough , it probably has withstood earthquakes and survived already while others crumbled , it 's a bit like natural selection, 
  the rice itself is enough , we 'll just enlist the help of the recently numerous japanchinesitalian restourants . 
  well , we can eat italian dishes at home whenever we want , 
  i love sushi , even though it 's not usually made by japanese cooks over here , so i hope it 's at least similar to the real thing !, 
  well , while i 'm sure that paedophilia is quite widespread , i 'm not sure that there 's a large amount of pedophiles willing to risk the act of kidnapping . 
  well , for kids who do n't live in the city , school buses are better than having to rely on public transportation and its schedules, 
  via farini is better , via d'azeglio 's businesses ca n't sell alcohol after 11 pm so they close , the only places you 'd find any people over there would be `` vecchie maniere '' or `` bastian contrario '' which are on side streets , they are beer pubs and there 's usually not much chance for interaction ( great beer , though ) . 
  you should also visit piazza duomo and see the battistero , which is nice even from the outside , and visit the `` pilotta '' in piazzale della pace . 
  that last area is a bit depopulated at night save for immigrants , but it 's not dangerous . 
  try to avoid via trento ( near the train station ) and viale piacenza , there 's a lot of drug dealers , and while they usually do n't cause problems , it 's better to avoid them . 
  nothing to see there anyway . 
  if you want to meet other foreigners ( like erasmus students ) you could check out the `` tonic '' ( bar ? 
  idk ) near via farini , but it 's nothing to write home about . 
  unfortunately there are no good clubs left in the city , as far as i know . 
  honestly i have no idea, 
  a word for more ... civilezed times .

  it 's a nissan terrano,
