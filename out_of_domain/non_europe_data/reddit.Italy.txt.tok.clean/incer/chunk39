  i work in a small business making machines for the food industry . 
  i am the sole software `` developer '' in the company . 
  i use quotation marks because i 'm 100 % self-taught . 
  at an industry level there 's a ** serious ** disregard for the user 's time and work . 
  if there 's some menial task that could be automated with a little more effort , it 's often disregarded , why ? 
  because the ones making the machines wo n't be the ones using them , they just have to train the operator on how to perform that frustrating and repetitive task every day multiple times a day , and the managers who actually buy the machines and manage the installation do n't care either , because it 'll be the job of some lowly worker . 
  when we train users on our machines , they 're usually all enthusiastic , because they see that they are actually built to ease their workload , and that they 're intuitive to use ... 
  but that 's not something that makes the machines easier to sell . 
  what has helped lately is that the same automation which reduces labor also reduces user error , and that '' s something managers will appreciate . 
  it 's like nfc , you put your faces close together , and after the pairing you can exchange data,

  well , sorry but your understanding is ... wrong . 
  there 's actually little increase in the prime minister 's powers ( in italy the president does n't actually govern ) save for the ability to force the parliament to vote on a proposed law . 
  it does make the governing party stronger in the parliament , though . 
  the purpose is mostly to give stability ( very few governments managed to reach the end of their term in italy ) and to make parliamentary decisions quicker . 
  as for those voting no , it 's people who simply are n't satisfied with the changes proposed ( they fear strong parties with no opposition in the parliament ) or people who vote no out of spite towards renzi . 
  hey , no worries , just wanted to clarify, 
  tranne dio . 
  for a few days it 'll be a shit hurricane , though . 
   if you 're trying to change the constitution in such a way in italy , you ca n't decide whether or not you want to indict a referendum about it . 
  a referendum will be indicted , by law . 
  not really , you can do it without the referendum if 2/3 of the parliament agree,
