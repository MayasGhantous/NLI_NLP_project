  you 're objectifying me !, 
  are you sure you 're in the right reddit ? 
  cats are more effective than poison and usually do n't kill other non-targeted animals as poison does . 
  well , they do kill other animals but not ones we usually care about :p, 
  i guess it also depends on the fact that eating something that died by itself is usually not a good idea , and some animals are more suited for scavenging than others . 
  maybe due to the fact that their family was at the hospital and their house was a pile of ash ? 
   the excuse of , `` do n't flaunt it if you do n't want it stared at '' is like saying , `` do n't show skin or it 's your fault if you get raped . '', 
  to me . 
  show = flaunt ( kind of ) , so if show : rape and flaunt : stare then -  rape = stare, 
  and anyway i 'd like to point out that ** almost nobody ** stares at other people , except for fucked-in-the-head individuals that should n't be compared to the general population . 
  the way you 're putting it makes it sound like you walk around town surrounded by masturbating men . 
  i think he means that they did n't use strong frontal `` oh-god-where 's - your-nose '' lights, 
  yes , while i find baconreader extremely good ( except when i try to tap a link in a comment ) , friendcaster is n't as satisfying . 
  still , with the last update it improved a lot . 
  i do n't get the hate for physical buttons . 
  with every new model , handling a phone gets more difficult , trying to avoid pressing something on the screen . 
  i want a bezel , i want physical ( not touch ) buttons , and especially a 2-stage camera button . 
  if i wanted a frustrating buttonless phone i 'd have bought an iphone . 
  my brain can handle more than 1 button , thanks , and my phone is n't a fashion statement . 
  ** anything ** is better than the original fb app :p, 
  new ?

  do n't do this to me man , i 'm a few hours away from seeing my gf for the first time in 12 days ... 
  i never had problems in that regard . 
  my problem right now is suppressing the urge to just get up ,,

  you guys hate me , do n't you ? 
  * but i love you !, 
  up and away , submission !, 
  ... * speechless * . 
  not really . 
  i 'm italian and it 's the same here . 
  yeah , you might be right ... 
  maybe they did n't want to catch whatever illness you 're going through . 
  had the same issue , removed it months ago . 
  yeah , well , after having bought an optimus 2x , thanks but no thanks . 
  no , you ca n't . 
  i 'm from parma . 
  three people died at a [ a company we work with . 
  update : 9 people confirmed dead . 
  12 warehouses have collapsed in medolla . 
  update 2 : 10 dead , more minor earthquakes causing other collapses . 
  seems like there 's been a collapse in the [ duomo of carpi ] ( http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/duomo_di_carpi ) causing the death of a priest . 
  another one died in a nearby town . 
  it 's interesting to note that almost all collapses are of industrial buildings . 
  update 3 : [ the emblematic remains of the clock tower in finale emilia collapsed completely after the last shocks ] ( http://oddstuffmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/637.jpg ), 
  update 4 : another big shake , felt it very well at many km away . 
  update 5 : at least 15 dead, 
  update 6 : the earthquake has put a stop to the operations of a company that manufactures artificial hearts , [ one of which made the front page a few days ago for saving a newborn 's life ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/u4915/the_smallest_artificial_heart_in_the_world/ ), 
  i 'd say 30-40 seconds . 
  i was on the first floor and i felt like i was going to fall :p, 
  correct . 
  no more lg hardware for me , especially no more `` first phone ever with x ! '', 
  the problem is that we 've always been told that this area is seismically quiet , so the building standards probably were n't that high in regards to earthquake resistance . 
  well , it 's not my field of course , but what is suitable for civilian buildings may not be so for much different industrial ones . 
  we also have to keep in mind that in italy rules are not always followed , even in the industrial north . 
  [ this saved my face ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/incer/4947806277/in/set-72157624840249700 ), 
  the amperage may vary , a normal usb port from a computer can usually output up to 500ma , while most smartphone chargers output 1000ma , and tablet chargers even 2000ma or more . 
  in fact in some cases tablets are unable to effectively charge from usb when powered on . 
  yeah well , i would n't take it for granted anyway , given the quality of some computers lately :p, 
  i would consider the software factor . 
  i 've seen poor battery charge readings from android every time i 've swapped a battery . 
  i 'd check the voltages if i were you , probably the battery 's outputting it wrong ... 
  there 's no fix as far as i know . 
  i 've put fully charged batteries in replacing discharged ones and the battery indicator kept on telling me i had 10 % or whatever was the last reading . 
  no because pubic forests, 
  i do n't mind ( reasonably ) hairy armpits . 
  my issue with pubic hair is ... well , it 's not fun to put your mouth in that . 
  tongue rash . 
  is n't weed now forbidden to non residents ? 
  her bra has ... a strange shape . 
  when gnu/hurd does, 
  interesting . 
  what an interesting world we live in !, 
  so i 'll have to refrain from downloading those `` nuke from scratch '' podcasts ? 
  seriously overdone everything, 
  the real version is better, 
  i agree . 
  moreover , turn based games are well suited to phone gaming , allowing both casual ( when waiting something ) and continuous ( at home , lunch break , etc ) play . 
  see rebuild , for example . 
  there are paid games that do that too, 
  see [ mini motor racing ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nextgenreality.minimoto ), 
  mini motor racing is great fun but it 's ... well ... pay-mium !, 
  not only you have to buy it , but without in-app purchases it 's very frustrating from about 1/3 on ... 
  i bought the double winnings bonus , 0,70 $ , without it i would have probably grown bored before i finished it . 
  the point is that most of the time you 're not patenting an idea you wrote on a napkin , but a team 's work that may have taken up months or years . 
  if your competitor can just wait and copy your work , there 's no point in inventing anything . 
  that said , most of today 's patents are simply stupid . 
  it 's nice and all , but at the end of the day , the reason people use patents is to defend their work , not to share it . 
  sharing comes ( rightfully ) after the patent has expired and the holder has had the chance to profit from it . 
  the coca cola recipe is n't patented but it 's still secret , and that does n't allow others to copy it . 
  it 's not so easy for other things . 
  i build food machines , and anyone can disassemble one and understand how it works , i ca n't put a security guard at every one of my customers ' facilities just to prevent that .
