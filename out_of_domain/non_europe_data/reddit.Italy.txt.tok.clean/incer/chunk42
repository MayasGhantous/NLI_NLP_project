  yeah , try it next time , you 'll be surprised !, 
  ok so i 'm really wondering about this . 
  i 'm an outsider on this sub as i do n't have a voron , i 'm just curious . 
  but to the point : i have a p3steel where i used mild steel rods ( because i had access to that stuff at work for cheap ) instead of hardened ones and they work perfectly . 
  i actually bought proper hardened ones now , but when i tried the linear bearings on them they were n't as smooth as the mild steel ones . 
  they may get worn out sooner , but that has n't happened yet . 
  well , if you do n't mind `` coding '' your models , there 's openscad, 
  try a different slicer, 
  i love printing abs . 
  it 's so nice , prints well , strong , looks good ... 
  the only issue is the warping , but with the new ones it 's very manageable . 
  but the pink filament was in clearance sale !, 
  at that point you can get a cheap ip camera and use the rpi to create a vpn to your lan , this way you can connect directly to the duet and check the ip camera independently, 
  so , duet wifi owners , is the paneldue screen useful ? 
  or should i keep that money and just use the web interface ? 
  link does n't work, 
  the reason is that you can have the top of the heatsink flush against the bottom of the extruder without the `` bowden '' fitting being in the way . 
  it 's smarter than e3d 's version . 
  it would be even easier to use something different from the clip , honestly . 
  some wire wrapped up tight would probably be quite effective . 
  that looks a lot like what i wanted to design . 
  heated chamber ? 
  well , go for it !, 
  we 're 3d printer owners after all !, 
  me too !, 
  when you train people to act like robots , they make errors a robot would make . 
  works perfectly for me , but you have to try out different brands and products to find a good one , they 're not all the same, 
  well , it 's not like it 's sold all over the world, 
  why 316 ? 
  do you expect it to come into contact with strong bases or acids ? 
  that 's a big-ass reserve, 
  bear in mind that the pieces fit together through `` holes '' ( i do n't know the correct word in english ) , it should fit , but that depends on the quality of the cut . 
  you may have to use a file . 
  edit : just checked the drawing for version 2.01 , the `` slots '' are 3.3 mm , so that leaves you 0,15 mm of `` play '' , or 0,075 mm per side . 
  one thing that windows does right is the touch screen interface , though . 
  gnome tries and fails to equal that , and other des do n't even try . 
  i left cinnamon after the arch builds became way too buggy . 
  the trouble with the audio on my xps also made me switch to fedora , i chose the kde spin and i must say that right now kde is really great . 
  `` lines in the benchy '' could be the name of a 3d printing drama, 
  are you 100 % sure it 's the motor and not the driver ? 
  what about amazon.it ? 
  i 'm italian and i buy from ice filaments on amazon, 
  well , it 's not like a rail gun automatically has infinite kinetic energy . 
  you can still shoot in an arc . 
  well , i got one for my sister for christmas and they delivered quickly, 
  next on z nation !, 
  actually closer to real spaghetti, 
  to me , clear acrylic printers are truly beautiful . 
  oops, 
  in my case , i accumulate printer * parts *, 
  in those cases i use the blade from a box cutter . 
  the sharper the better . 
  of course you have to be ** very ** careful . 
  abs is hard to print on `` open '' printers like the p3steel , building an enclosure for them is mandatory . 
  it 'd be good for making plastic coasters, 
  yes , unfortunately they 're a bit more expensive . 
  well , what can i tell you , i love my p3steel , it prints fast and well , but unfortunately i self sourced everything so i ca n't help you with kits . 
  just hope that you 're not wrong !, 
  i only share my software with penguins, 
  unless you build a delta , any slicer is fine , that 's the last thing you should worry about , as you can also switch at any time ( and you will ! ), 
  do you plan to print from sd or from a printing host ? 
  even better is printing from your bed with the duet wifi :d, 
  do n't tell my gf i checked while we were out for dinner , though !, 
  xps 13 . 
  it 's smaller than any other 13 inch i 've seen . 
  i 've got an xps 15 and it 's the size of a 13/14 inch notebook . 
  nope , she does n't ... 
  but she 'll figure it out soon :(, 
  it was a news story about the state of italy 's economy , those are financial exchange operators . 
  he 's a real life pepe, 
  cinnamon , gnome and kde all have good hidpi support . 
  gnome recognizes my hidpi screen immediately and scales everything automatically , but ... well , it 's gnome , i just ca n't get used to it . 
  either a [ repstrap ] ( http://reprap.org/wiki/repstrap ) , depending on the [ tools available to you ] ( http://reprap.org/wiki/what_tooling_do_you_have ) , or [ buy a frame online ] ( https://duckduckgo.com/?q=!ebay+reprap+frame&amp;t=ffab ) and put in your electronics . 
  give mordin 5 minutes in his lab and the xeno is fucked, 
  stepper motors used in printers have 2 coils , so those 4 wires are 2 pairs , one for one coil , one for the other . 
  to reverse the motor you have to invert the coils . 
  to find if two wires are part of the same coil , you can check continuity with a multimeter , or short circuit them together and try to rotate the shaft : if it becomes hard , those two wires are a pair . 
  fun fuct , that means `` soft '' in in italian, 
   and i think that 's the general point . 
  high schools have become so soft that we 're now having to teach kids the basics in college , and they 're paying handsomely for the privilege . 
  honestly , i do n't think that 's a problem exclusive to the usa . 
  i 'm italian and i got my high school diploma as an adult at the evening school , and seeing school with an adult 's perspective is eye-opening . 
  speaking with professionals who went to high school 30-40 years ago made me realize how trivial and useless it became , and returning to school after 10 years confirmed my suspects . 
  i know italy is treated like a joke around the world , but we have a large industrial base and design services , our architects work all over the world . 
  our education used to be not excellent but good . 
  now i 'm afraid it kinda sucks , and being publicly funded in a country in deep economic crisis does n't really help . 
  the expanse season 2 ca n't come soon enough, 
  not on my netflix :(, 
   safely, 
  dude ... altitude, 
  i skipped octoprint and bought a duet wifi ... now i 've got the web interface _ ** and ** _ a barely audible printer . 
  well , importing has gotten more expensive , but local manufacturing and labor costs in the uk have gone down comparatively . 
  at least in theory . 
  of course they also brought down the euro with them , so that wo n't help with what 's probably their biggest market . 
  i take the glass off , clean it in the sink , dry , spray a generous layer of hairspray ( when i spray , at first it looks like frosted glass , i keep going until it 's in-between that `` frosted '' look and glossy ) , put it back on and heat it up . 
  works perfectly , even too much at times . 
  a lot of difference is in the filament : some abs warps like crazy , some works fine even without an enclosure . 
  yes, 
  i built my p3steel from scratch . 
  everything went pretty smooth .
