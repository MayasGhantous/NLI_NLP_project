  try vivaldi maybe ? 
  good move by his father,

  i 've managed to crack the screen on my asus u44sg notebook , ca n't find a spare on ebay and googling it yields some suspect-looking websites ... do you guys know a reliable supplier for this ? 
  should i open up the pc and google the part code directly ( if i can find it ) ? 
  hi everyone !, 
  i own a somewhat old dell 3007wfp ( 30 '' wqxga 2560 \u00d7 1600 ) that only accepts dual-link dvi input . 
  unfortunately my desktop has been broken for a long time and i 'm not planning to replace it for now , as i have a good enough laptop ( asus u44sg ) and i do n't spend much time at home anyway . 
  i 'd still like to use this monitor , though . 
  the problem is that my laptop has normal vga and hdmi out ports and no dvi ports , let alone a dual-link one . 
  i tried using an hdmi to dvi conversion cable which claimed to support dual-link but , as i pretty much expected , it did n't work , the resolution was low and the image was reddish and unstable . 
  since i do n't plan to do any gaming on it , i considered using an external usb video add-on ( my notebook supports usb3 ) but i have n't found anything suiting my needs , except maybe something with a displayport output which would have to be adapted again for dvi dual ... 
  ** do any of you here have any experience on the matter ? 
  any suggestions ? 
  thanks , 
  hello , i need to select an economic proximity sensor ( distance measuring ) for a project , with a range of about 35-70cm ( or something like that , i can adapt the design ) . 
  the issue is that i need it to have a somewhat `` focused '' beam , in order to identify the edges of an object , with relatively low precision . 
  to clarify : right now i 'm experimenting with sharp 's proximity sensors ( gp2y-whatever ) , these are ir sensors which have a `` cone-shaped '' area of detection , meaning that if i point the sensor perpendicular to a plane , and start to move an object on this plane slowly towards the sensor 's `` reading spot '' , it starts to generate a increasing reading when it 's still out of the sensor 's `` perpendicular spot '' . 
  of course this effect is also influenced by the `` height '' of the object relative to the sensor , not only its sides . 
  i am still taking measurements in order to find the function governing this reading , and see if by derivating it i can better identify these edges , but i 'm wondering if there are better suited sensors for this . 
  ** tl/dr : i need a sensor for finding the edges of an object upon a plane , with relatively low precision ( 10-20mm ? ), 
  from a distance of 35-70cm , that will be intefaced with an 8bit pic . 
  i 'm looking at proximity sensors right now but i guess i could use something else . 
  the budget maximum is about 50 $ . 
  can anybody help me ? 
  excuse me if anything is unclear but english is not my main language . 
  thanks, 
  so , after some years of inactivity i 've finally gotten back some free time to play games !, 
  it 's been a while since i built my last pc , so if you could give me some advice , it 'd be nice . 
  i 've read around a bit , and selected these parts , could you look it over and see if you have any suggestions ? 
  main points :, 
  * not to expensive , not too cheap, 
  * needs to play `` not-really-last-gen '' games for now , but i 'd like to keep using it for a while . 
  i have crysis 2 and borderlands 2 in my steam library and i think they 're the most `` modern '' ones in there . 
  * possible future upgrades if convenient/affordable . 
  * probable linux dual-boot in the future . 
  * * maybe * one day i 'll put liquid cooling in , more for the fun of it than for the usefulness, 
  * i like rtses , rpgs and fpses ( twitchy ones too , but i 'm not against lowering details ),

  * the stick is there because i like playing [ freespace 2 scp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freespace_2_source_code_project ) and maybe star citizen in the future, 
  * the monitor is there because of response time and because i may eventually try 3d , but i 'm not sure . 
  * i put a 250gb ssd because i currently have a laptop and ** tons ** of usb hds so `` slow '' storage is n't needed . 
  so ... is it ok ? 
  suggestions ? 
  hello everyone !, 
  next year i 'll probably come to connecticut from europe to perform some repairs and rework on industrial food machinery . 
  the original idea was to manage a local team , but since the customer is a bit strapped for cash , i 'm considering making the welds myself . 
  do you know what kind of authorizations etc would i need for metalworking in connecticut as a foreigner ? 
  especially since most of the work will be sanitary pipe welding . 
  hello everyone !, 
  i 'm happy to say that i 've joined you guys in owning a 3d printer !, 
  i look forward to being part of this community . 
  [ here are my first successful prints , in chronological order from left to right . 
  ] ( https://imgur.com/csut3jo,qafoc31 ) this is all pla so far . 
  i have a roll of abs too , but i only had time to rush one print so far that failed to stick immediately so i aborted it . 
  probably wrong first layer height . 
  those in the picture are all sliced with cura . 
  [ as you can see from this picture , it appears that horizontal holes cause some kind of tearing/lack of material . 
  at first i thought it could be a slicing error , so i tried slic3r ( which i dismissed before , because it was printing garbage causing the extrusion to wander all over the place ) , [ but the result , while a bit better , did n't change much . 
  is this a retraction issue ? 
  what do you suggest ? 
  any other suggestions on how to improve the general printing quality ? 
  i already went from 50 \u00b0 c heatbed temp . 
  ( no adhesion ) to 100 \u00b0 c in steps , it seems that 90-100 \u00b0 c gives the best result in regards to warping , despite the wiki and other sources suggesting 60-70 \u00b0 c, 
  also , i 'm still working out the settings , so i 'd like your advice :, 
  - suggested print speed for a printer like mine ? 
  it 's pretty stiff and stable , but i can start with a conservative setting . 
  - what about marlin 's feedrate , acceleration and jerk settings ? 
  - i have drv8825 drivers in my ramps setup , they are currently set at 1/16th micro-stepping . 
  i have read posts online that marlin is no good at 1/32th , is that true ? 
  is there any improvement apart from noise in going from 1/16th to 1/32th ? 
  - the bottom layer , both with cura and slic3r looks like it 's printed ... sparse ? 
  there 's less material than in other layers ... why is this ? 
  [ here it is ] ( https://imgur.com/oo7vlpb,mbk9li1,mkm3awh,iisjfrm,ddu27bj,hdzfnuh,eewzd0c ) , printed on my first printer , a prusa i3 steel !, 
  e3d lite6 0.40 mm , ramps and marlin , sliced with ** cura 15.02.1 ** , with the following settings :, 
  layer_height = 0.2, 
  wall_thickness = 0,8, 
  retraction_enable = true,
