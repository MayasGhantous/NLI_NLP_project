  and neither can i build `` black box '' machines or put c4 to kill anyone who tries to open those machines . 
  the opensource philosophy simply does n't work everywhere . 
  it 's not like you are proving your point either . 
  today is not the past . 
  today 's works , machines , inventions and products are a thousand times more complicated than what they could have been in the past , and developing anything requires a big investment in time and money . 
  people wo n't stop inventing simply because we 're human and that 's our nature , but it could seriously reduce the amount of resources that could be spent to develop something , and as a consequence could easily result in lesser products . 
  still , swipe to unlock is obviously something that should n't be patentable , just as `` screw to tighten a bolt '' should n't be patentable !, 
  i 've got 20 years old japanese products that are still working ... 
  so i guess that was more than 20 years ago ? 
  i do n't know , but i have a feeling that chinese stuff is way more flaky than japanese stuff could have ever been :p, 
  ah , german cameras ... 
  still popular in some niches !, 
  you are still talking about software . 
  at most you can push yourself to computer hardware . 
  not everyone works with computers . 
  stuff that keeps you alive , like food processing , agricultural machines , water treatment and so on has a very real cost because of very real resources required to build anything . 
  you ca n't copy-paste a sheet of metal , or a machine chassis . 
  in my field , you ca n't work if you do n't have expensive infrastructure , and the bigger you are , the better of you can be . 
  with $ 20k ( $ 16k ) , here , _ maybe _ you can barely cover the expenses for opening a business ( statute , etc ) . 
  surely not work . 
  i know , i 've done it . 
  add to it that banks do n't give credit to anyone anymore ( but we still have to bail them out and `` refinance '' them with public money ) , and what you say is simply impossible . 
  no , that was definitely new . 
  what if the disturbed person was the one with the gun ? 
  hah , when i found out death rally was out for android i rushed to get it ... had to use market enabler , tho . 
  it 's a bit different from the one from my childhood , but it 's still great :-d, 
  being together in silence is great , tho . 
  `` sir can i help y - '', 
  `` no thanks '', 
  well , i already did :p, 
  and then they spend hours shopping together, 
  yeah , it 's necessary , seeing the same actor with multiple voices is kind of disturbing, 
  yes , for my part i can say the italian one is quite good . 
  guy 's a genius . 
  they 're terrorist toilets . 
  they just explode . 
  still blue , less glorious . 
  engineeeeeering, 
  the issue with that is finding the right amount of cheating . 
  too little and you have trouble , too much and it 's not challenging anymore . 
  when i document some happening or a party with friends , i easily take 400-500 pictures in an evening ( not counting the instantly deleted ones ) and hardly drain half of my 450d 's battery . 
  but i use an external flash . 
  i 'd like to know where all you guys live , it seems that everyone around you is extremely judgmental ... or is it you ? 
  lay his girlfriend . 
  i 'd just go with `` fuck you guys '' . 
  upvoted for terseness, 
  re-read . 
  but their decision depends greatly on what you do, 
  in italy , i had spent about 20 dollars or so on supermarket alcohol and drank it in the club 's parking before getting in . 
  you can do anything you do in llama with tasker , it 's just more complicated because tasker has greater customization capacity . 
  llama on the other hand can do roughly 10 % of what tasker can ( i guess , i only did use llama for a short time ) , and do n't forget that some applications have the ability to interact directly with tasker , allowing some fun stuff . 
  holy freaking **** !, 
  you have an ass too , why would you stare at women 's ? 
  thanks . 
  going from mac to windows cost me the unit converter widget :(, 
  you mean you get people weighing more than that ? 
  here in italy they say that if you lose your shoes in a bike accident , you 're dead . 
  that 's why i always tighten my laces before riding :p, 
  of course some people survive , and final destination ensues . 
  while it 's true that psychiatric medications should be prescribed warily , i think medication can help in many cases if used correctly , and i do n't agree with vitojohn above implying that it should only be used for clinical ( chemical ? ), 
  depression . 
  in my case for example , i have been put in a very bad situation by my parents , essentially flushing my life and future hopes down the shitter . 
  for the last years i was essentially surviving , without the strength to actually do anything for myself ... until i was convinced to visit a psychiatrist , who prescribed me the right ( not too strong ) medication , and i 'm actually getting better , improving my situation and working for my future . 
  i 've always hated drugs , but i reached a point where the choice was either this or wasting my life . 
  i needed help to get through this situation and it 's working . 
  bear in mind that i 'm a naturally cheerful person , and i usually keep my problems inside myself , so if you met me you would never guess the truth . 
  many of my acquaintances never realized the gravity of the situation , because when i 'm with my friends i 'm always happy-ish . 
  one thing i always wonder about is this : i 'm used to opening doors ( buildings , not cars ) for women ( any , strangers included ) and letting them through an open door ** first ** , but when i do it outside my country ( italy ) , women seem suprised/flattered . 
  sooo ... is this custom uncommon elsewhere , or have i only met women used to discourteous environments ? 
  you know , maybe he likes watching you because he loves you ... 
  i know that i like watching my gf regardless of what she 's doing ( except gross stuff :p ) . 
  it 's great . 
  being hard does n't mean that you have finalize immediately . 
  the longer the wait , the sweeter the reward , 
  also if you like it , we feel good when pleasing our so , 
  keep looking bro , you 'll find her !, 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trazodone ), 
  i was skeptical , but it actually works . 
  one weekend i forgot it at home so i could n't take it ... got drunk , and pairing the rebound from alcohol with that , on monday i kind of ... freaked out . 
  it was ... unexpected . 
  of course i 'm not a serious case , so i only need a little push to feel better . 
  i also have xanax for the anxiety when needed , but i have n't used it in months . 
  i was too , but it 's probably better this way . 
  near where i live there used to be an old woman with dwarfism that drove something like that ( totally ** not ** pink tho ) for years before she got an electric wheelchair ... 
  i do n't know the story behind it , unfortunately . 
  probably she was just poor . 
  but who says it would have been found funny otherwise ? 
  actually spaghetti is already plural so it would n't need the s at the end . 
  the singular form is spaghetto . 
  better go get it back , then !, 
  he has your axe , so you better go get it back , if you need it !, 
  * but if you make me explain it then it 's not fun anymore !, 
  actually it looks like she 's addressing the driver of the car she was on , and it 's not `` her front '' , she was the passenger . 
  that 's kind of the stupidest accident ever ... 
  i was hoping he would crash on the tunnel 's entrance ... no such luck . 
  he was n't overtaking , the other guy just hit the brakes sooner, 
  last action hero :d, 
  well ... she 's gorgeous anyway . 
  kind of depends on the setting ... for example when i do it in the car , i want that stuff off my hands as soon as possible ... 
  i do n't want to get it all over my seats .
