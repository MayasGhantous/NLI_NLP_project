  that 's serious over-reacting . 
  would you like if your boyfriend spat on your car 's seats ? 
  is it because you find him disgusting ? 
  what if he came on them ? 
  cleaning man-goo from something you ca n't throw in the washing machine is not that fun . 
   the fact the you 're referring to it as `` that stuff '' sounds as if you find it , and by extension the girl it came out of , disgusting . 
  do you like shit ? 
  i do n't . 
  even if it comes out of my girlfriend . 
  and i do n't find her disgusting at all . 
  i 'm merely commenting on her looks ... 
  if she 's truly crazy , i might be ... wary . 
  yeah , well , i only used those words because it was a quick comment and since english is not my main language sometimes it 's easier to take a shortcut . 
  regarding shit , i was just pointing out that finding something that came out of your so unpleasant does n't mean that you think the same of her . 
  of course i do n't have any issues with vaginal fluids , when i clean myself is just so i do n't spread it over my surroundings and my partner ( not everyone likes that ) , it 's also much easier to get rid of than seminal fluid ( which is a nasty living glue from hell ) . 
  i do n't understand this . 
  in my country there 's no tip custom , waiters are paid a normal wage , and i almost never suffered bad service . 
  on the other hand , when i 'm visiting america , waiters are always annoying me trying to get on my good side . 
  i 'm fine , i do n't need anything else , just let me eat , i 'll call you if i need something !, 
  it 's also embarrassing how to me , this puts the waiter in a subordinate position to you , when he should n't , he 's just someone doing his work . 
  i have a few friends who did something like that , and worse , more than once ... 
  they were quickly forgiven . 
  everybody knows that a drunken person , especially one who 's experiencing hardships , may react in the wrong way to many things . 
  if they did n't understand that , they most likely never had to endure truly hard times ... one day they will and they 'll understand . 
  violentoctopus will avenge you !, 
  it smells . 
  then just do them . 
  well , that 's strange . 
  maybe it depends on what each of us expects from a waiter . 
  i 've noticed though that connecting or disconnecting from wifi bothers most apps that rely on the internet , if there 's a transfer going . 
  the facebook app used to have problems ( i uninstalled it long ago ) even when switching between 2g and 3g, 
  that 's my reasoning too !, 
  many of my friends ( and even my father ) do n't understand it even when i explain !, 
  if they call you it 's because someone ** is dying ** and you can save them !, 
  well , you can chime in for people all over , not only in the uk !, 
  when i subscribed i was told that there 's some kind of worldwide database ( still being expanded i think ) where all the organizations from the various countries contribute data . 
  yeah , i know ... their arguments are actually more about risk ... and the second method apparently is not easily available or widely used here in italy ... 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm not scared either way , though . 
  if it has to be done , it 'll be done !, 
  deadpool !, 
  nice hair !, 
  i 'm getting the opposite , i 've always thought to prefer women with makeup , but here the best pictures are the ones without !, 
  it might be because my gf rarely uses makeup and when she does it 's very light , so i 've gotten used to that look ... maybe ? 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/yus4s/iama_17_year_old_boy_who_has_an_extremely_rare/ ), 
  he 's providing race service on his father 's own circuit :p, 
  maybe because of the contradiction of saying `` the government is n't like that '' and then `` yeah , the government is like that , but only because it 's being manipulated '' . 
  bowser successful bachelor !, 
  d'you often fall in love with ugly stupid and bland people ? 
  i think it also has to do with men 's strive for independence , taking the `` here and now '' road for money , while girls have less problems ( and society puts less pressure for ) relying on parents/family for the longer time required for an higher education . 
  i believe it 's because of today 's crappy teaching method of `` repeat 'till you learn '' being more suited to girl 's learning processes , while it puts boys ( who are more driven by passion and less capable of focusing on uninteresting topics ) at a disadvantage . 
  but the statistics are being skewed by the chinese !, 
  ** he 's talking about different equipment from the one in the picture **, 
  is she stupid and boring also ? 
  sorry , but that sounds like cheap rhetoric ... 
  sorry , * this is an internet argument * , i ca n't let it go !, 
  yeah , sure :p, 
  it 's like seeing a mantis eating a mouse ... my brain is n't used to it !, 
  insects should be lower in the feeding chain !, 
  you mean stories made up by 13 year olds ? 
  for fighting in the early morning !, 
  heavy metal !, 
  well , this one has more surface for heat exchange ... 
  go sms already does this , and it 's actually kind of annoying . 
  well , in that case , why not show the full sms app conversation ? 
  luckily with android ( and cm ) we can choose which features to enable/disable !, 
  emergency fap area !, 
  that 's what they want you to believe !, 
  yeah , i did that ... 
  i have , in fact . 
  hey , simple question : in american movies we often see the `` asthma kid '' character ... is this such a common disease over there , or is it simply a well-liked trope in movies ? 
  i 've never known anyone with asthma here . 
  one needs a manly car : reliable and capable !, 
  no , it 's most likely a pain to drive and manouver , handling like shit on the road and absolutely useless off road . 
  it 'd be a fun target for a blowgun !, 
  i do n't think it needs a horn , with tires like that you 'll probably hear it coming from a mile away . 
  oh please ... that 's so stupid i do n't even want to have this argument . 
  unless by `` mudding '' you mean `` floating on a lake '' , that thing 's a trap . 
  the car in the link is n't manly at all : it 's neither reliable nor capable . 
  let 's clear this : in most of the world , people * do not * get locked into contracts . 
  uhm , i think most of europe uses `` rechargeable '' contracts for private phones ... 
  i do . 
  i do n't `` go '' at offroad events , i * partecipate * . 
  and i 'm sorry , but i do n't go playing in puddles with my car . 
  when i do offroading , i like climbing obstacles and taking on mud in actually challenging trails . 
  that thing would tip over at the first incline and would get stuck between trees . 
  even on level mud it would be dangerous to turn . 
  it 's stupid in so many ways that i feel stupid myself trying to explain it . 
  i think this is not getting anywhere . 
  we disagree . 
  yes . 
  very . 
  cool ... 
  so you do n't swing it on somebody 's face when you 're getting out . 
  you just need a custom wheelchair with a tank !, 
  there are things called online shops , you buy stuff electronically and you receive it * at your house !, 
  or there are things like customizations ... cyanogenmod lets you disable the camera shutter sound . 
  well , that 's actually useful in case of zombie apocalypse ... 
  you may be overestimating the value of corn . 
  well , if we 're talking about serious pervs here , i do n't think they would use a camera phone for that .
