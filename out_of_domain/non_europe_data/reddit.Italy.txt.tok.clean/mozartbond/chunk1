thanks !, 
  i 'm just using shaders . 
  without shaders i have more than 120 fps on far render distance and fancy graphics , with the shaders [ without changing any graphics settings ] i drop to 14fps . . but it does n't matter , for me the shaders are cool for screen shots and that 's it , 
  thanks !, 
  usually i use oak planks and logs for the second floors and dark wood for third floors and roofs . 
  but on this texture pack you do n't notice it much from a distance , i guess  i am working on a design with coloured wools for the walls though , coming soon , 
  thank you !, 
  yes i whatched some videos by jamziboy in the past , but i do n't remember him doing this kind of stuff . 
  i 'm very influenced by real life houses and by my brother , who is an architect , 
  yes , the texture pack is a custom john smith . 
  and i used glsl shaders for the screenshots . 
  you can find this stuff on the minecraft forums , 
  this has a lot of potential , the roof is pretty sharp looking and i like the randomness in the design . 
  maybe you can add some more trims ? 
   looking forward to the tavern, 
  wow you did a cracking job !, 
  will you release a world download ? 
  i 'd love to build something on this terrain , 
  ok thank you , 
  i agree with you , also i do n't like how they made the quartz block look like marble . 
  if they wanted to add a cool block like that they should just have added marble blocks in the overworld , and made the nether quartz block transparent , like ice for example . 
  it works for me , but with optifine 1.4.6 ultra a 2 and glsl shaders 1.1.5, 
  no , it does n't , you 're right . 
  also why do you call it quartz if it 's completely opaque ? 
  i know that diamond is n't opaque as well but still , they again missed the opportunity to make something cool , and choosen the cheap way of adding a sort of marble block , with a texture that does n't even work with the vanilla ones . 
  the redstone stuff in this update is very nice , though . 
  have you tried removing the blocks above the slabs ? 
  yeah i 've seen that and commented already !, 
  :p i do n't plan on uploading my world at the moment , because it 's just a bunch of houses and an underground base xd [ all made in survival ] but i have in mind something to upload , maybe a rustic town built in one of those cool world painter maps , 
  thanks !, 
  yes but i 'm not so good at it . . are you a map maker ? 
  check this out btw , i hope you like it http://imgur.com/a/yugvu#0, 
  thanks  texture pack is good old john smith 32x, 
  i 'd love to , but no xd my ign is mozartbond [ silly nick , i know :p ], 
  i might do a tutorial on it , so that you can learn how to build this kind of stuff and do your own version of it , 
  ahahaha dude i never thought about it this way , it 's pretty funny !, 
  :d actually my nickname comes from a mozart/007 soundtrack mash-up done by a couple guys on youtube , they 're very good . 
  i will provide a photo tutorial soon, 
  thanks !, 
  it means a lot to me  btw are you italian ? 
  'cause i am, 
  since i have no idea about how to record gameplay , i 'll start a photo-tutorial album thingy on imgur tonight . 
  stay tuned for it if you 're interested , 
  but fraps cuts your fps quiete a bit , does it ? 
  oh yeah that would be awesome man !, 
  please please do it if you have time , i 'll use it as my creative world and post stuff here if i come up with something good !, 
  i 'll give you all the credit , of course . 
  but i do n't need a huge map , as soon as there 's a round , plane area with some mountains in the background i take it , even if it 's 500x500 ahahah, 
  i 'd like to have a mountain range that encloses a plateau , with a cliff that leads into an open valley with some small hills , so that i can fit something like a fortress in the plateau and have a village down in the valley , with wheat fields and scattered houses . 
  is this possible ? 
  i hope i do n't sound unpleasant  a real life image of this could be the gran sasso mountain in italy , http://www.abruzzoturismo.net/immagini-regione-abruzzo/itinerari-abruzzo/gran-sasso-06.jpg, 
  even though there 's no cliff in the photo i linked , you see how the mountains sort of enclose the valley , 
  thank you very much , you are very kind , 
  wow thank you man , i 'm looking forward to see what you do :d, 
  yes it is , sir . 
  it is so well done , infact , that i think it should be an `` official option '' and be shipped already inside the game, 
  thanks man  actually it 's very simple , i 'll post a tutorial tomorrow and you 'll see that it 's just about knowing a few tricks , and the build comes up fast and nice , 
  thanks  this are glsl shaders, 
  fair enough , it was worth asking , 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvlcu1_notc enjoy , 
  why ? 
  a building is built around the textures you have , there 's no point in trying to have something that looks good in vanilla if it 's made with a texture pack and vice versa . - . 
  this are the glsl shaders v 1.1.5 for minecraft 1.4.6 . 
  they work with optifine ultra a2 for minecraft 1.4.6 , not with the latest versions . 
  thanks anyway , 
  the tutorial will be out soon , check my page if you want to see it  and please tell me if you like it or not , when it 's out , because i 've never done a tutorial before xd, 
  very nice !, 
  you can use some more depth though , 
  sorry i forgot to say that this is john smith texture pack , 
  i made the tutorial  http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/16hntl/spring_house_tutorial_as_requested_by_many_i_did/, 
  here 's the tutorial !, 
  :d http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/16hntl/spring_house_tutorial_as_requested_by_many_i_did/, 
  john smith , 
  i almost want to install feed the beast , just to have this awesome pipes and facades to use in creative lol, 
  thanks a lot , 
  yeah i know . . 
  but my english accent is very poor :p i hope it 's useful anyway, 
  i know lynchyinc from the early days  we never met , unfortunately , but i 've always followed his creations with a lot of respect . 
  i 'm glad you liked it !, 
  the shaders that you see are the glsl shaders, 
  it 's a customized pack , but you can use this website to find many options http://flying-sheep.github.com/texture-pack-customizer/# the crossed and framed wools are in the `` framed '' wool option, 
  give him all the love you have !, 
  he deserves it :d, 
  it 's glorious !, 
  yeah i know . . 
  i tried to say what block i was using everytime in fact . 
  the problem is that i built this house first and then people asked for a tutorial , and since i built it sort of `` around '' the texture pack i use , there was no real point in changing to vanilla just for the tutorial , firstly because this house looks a bit stupid in vanilla [ jungle wood roof ? 
  uhmmm ]  next time i 'll build something in vanilla, 
  finally someone who addressed the `` look at my awesome temple entirely made out of the same block '' problem xd, 
  wow !, 
  thanks !, 
  it 's a pleasure , 
  try it yourself . 
  it can be good looking in default , but you have to change some things such as the roof [ probably spruce wood instead of jungle wood is best ] and the double stone slabs at the base do n't look very nice . 
  i would replace them with furnaces facing the inside of the house , then covered with trapdoors to hide the front of the furnace , or pistons , maybe ? 
  the tut is up , if you have n't seen it : http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/16hntl/spring_house_tutorial_as_requested_by_many_i_did/, 
  yeah , maybe some time i 'll do a video tutorial  is there anything in particular that you 'd like to see ? 
  you can eat zombie flesh, 
  naah everyone has its own pros , it 's just about finding them , 
  i 'm very happy that you find this tutorial helpful  and yeah most of the builders do n't care about inserting real life architectural details in their houses , but i think that this details are very important 'cause minecraft tricks you into seeing things that you 're used to see and something that resembles a real life structure is a lot more interesting from the first sight , if it has this kind of details  i 'm working on a steampunk island now , btw,
