  whatch the game and then we can talk ... the koreans thought the world cup was a kung fu contest , maybe, 
  yes , depending on where you are . . most people are fine with this , it 's considered normal , 
  dude you 're fucking amazing !, 
  come on notch , you 're a grown man ... do n't play the role of the victim because of 12 years old kids hating . 
  balls out !, 
  hire a marketing expert ... this tweet is going to backfire so hard on notch 's and mojang 's image . 
  you guys are awesome people and great programmers and i thank you for this great game and all the work you 're putting into it !, 
  but man , if you decide to deal with stuff like the eula now you definetly should expect hate and such things . 
  people selling stuff and robbing kids on servers should 've taken care of ages ago . 
  also mixing your private life with your multi-million business is not a good move , just saying . 
  you guys want to be happy and open , of course , but you ca n't be so near millions of gamers without a big wall beetween professional life and personal life . 
  now i 'm getting downvoted in a subreddit of gamers but i myself am a professional and i 'd never ever expose myself like notch is doing with this tweet . 
  but this is my opinion of course , i do n't run mojang ( lucky me , maybe . . ), 
  i 'm not a parent but an `` old '' player and i absolutely get your point . 
  i think that mojang has been very nice to the community being so near to it , but they 're getting to the point were , to me , they seem unprofessional and a bit immature . 
  there should be a line , a clear line , beetween the makers of a game and this huge community of kids . 
  it 's unbelievable that the creator of the game is unable to handle a bunch of hate tweets . 
  what was he expecting ? 
  he clearly does n't know how to run a company , maybe he does n't realize that mojang is now , in fact , a big company and they need to take care of what they say and how they communicate with the community . 
  it ca n't be this open and free if you do n't have balls of steel . 
  so what ? 
  he 's the guy who wanted fame , maybe he did n't realise that fame comes at a high price !, 
  and , by the way , if you 're demorilized turn off your phone and go for a walk , it 's not like he has to read every single tweet , is it ? 
  i see your point but i ca n't agree with it . 
  i do n't care if his feelings are hurt , he is a professional and should act like it . 
  mojang should also apologize to the families of those kids that spent so much money on pay2win servers ** that were already not legal in the old eula ** , because the so beloved company did n't do ** anything ** to stop those servers !, 
  they let them grow !, 
  why ? 
  because of money of course , because of more copies of the game sold etc. . . 
  i do n't understand how people can feel so close to notch , he 's not your friend ffs he 's a business man, 
  yay not everyone is a fanboy !, 
  good lord, 
  omg someone with a brain !, 
  i 'd upvote you a million times !, 
  how can people be so blind sometimes ? 
  i do n't get it, 
  of course he can change the eula the problem is that the old eula already said you ca n't make profit out of ingame content but mojang never enforced this !, 
  i already said why too , because thanks to those massive rpg and the like servers , the community kept growing . 
  but now realms is ready worldwide and no-one is using it !, 
  oh guess why ... 'cause you have to pay for a crappy server and no-one will do that if you can chose to play on awesome custom maps etc , now they have to find a way to eliminate the competitors of course ... 
  then , mojang should apologize for not enforcing the eula ( because they 're biased ) and actually letting those server owners rip off the kids . 
  it 's not completely mojang 's fault of course , but they have their responsability . 
  but the betamax was a work of art , the vhs a cheap plastic bullshit reader, 
  it 's legal in so many countries , dude ... 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taau8ypxa1a never forget, 
  ahahah man ... as a musician myself i thank you for being so zealous !, 
  man , i 've played this piece in orchestra . 
  playing it and listening to it live is quiete a frightening experience , and i loved it, 
  i do n't get why people complimenting on this beatiful girl get downvoted ... what ? 
  is this considered rude now ? 
  meh ... by the way nice cookies and dress , 
  tall grass is now always centered on the block :(, 
  harvesting dark oak woods gives you `` oak wood '' blocks with no texture , they 're uncraftable and if you place them the game crashes !, 
  lol, 
  well done !, 
  oh the swedish humor ... ahahah, 
  alright !, 
  :d it 's not that important afterall . . 
  i guess that being able to place wood logs without having the game to crash is more important lol, 
  i have a couple stacks of those ... 
  i guess i 'll have to place and break them again ahaha, 
  it does n't crash anymore in the 25b snapshot  now , when you place them , they turn back into normal dark oak/acacia whatever they are , then you can break them and use them again, 
  lol , in some points entire biomes are floating on underground seas !, 
  so cool, 
  yeah i noticed . . but it 's funny to have the floating torch anyway , 
  it 's a glitch , it happened because there 's a block on the side of the slab . 
  so when you place the torch on the slab , it automatically gets placed on the block on the side , but rendered like it 's in mid-air on top of the slab . 
  if you place another torch besides this one , the other pops off , 
  lol ... yeah they would be nice , although i 'd prefer something like glass panes but `` fatter '' rather than vertical slabs that stay only on one side or another of a block, 
  yeah yeah i see your point  they 'll add them , sooner or later, 
  that 's so stupid ... `` no i do n't want that , screw you all fans ! '', 
  what the hell, 
  you need to have a full block near the slab like in my screenshot , 
  quoting the mogminer, 
   that would be baller as hell , actually . 
  i 'll see what the other dudes think of it . 
  torches currently only use 3 bits ' worth of data ( values 0-5 ) , so adding an extra flag for `` move half a block downward '' would actually fit . 
  yeah but dude do n't get that too far ... they do n't `` have '' to keep updating the game , no , but it 's in their interest to keep doing so . . it 's clear that if minecraft dies off , they stop selling merchandise and game copies . 
  and currently mojang does n't have another major selling game going, 
  yeah but as themogminer said earlieri , it would take already quiete a bit of data to have the torch down half a block on each of the slabs in the game . . if you take all the slabs we have ( 13 if i remember correctly ) , to have all the possible combinations we have to multiply 13 by 13 and the result times 2 to obtain all the possible slab combinations ( correct me if the math is wrong ) . 
  so we have ( 13x13 ) x2 = 338 . 
  last time i studied combinations in school was 7 years ago , but it should be like this i guess . . so 338 new blocks for all the possible combinations of slabs you 're suggesting, 
  no no , i also feel it 's great that we do n't have to pay but i do n't agree with all this hype about mojang not charging for updates . 
  you see , when i was a kid we use to buy games that lasted for ages , there were not even expansion packs . 
  then the first dlcs started coming out but still they were coming with a lot of content and hours of gameplay . 
  now they charge you for camos and some new guns in fps games and people got used to it , or were born into this system . 
  but i was n't because i 'm `` old '' so i 'm not surprised , mojang is doing what i think is the right thing to do but i do n't praise them . 
  i paid already for the game i 'll not pay for some more content , if they were charging money then i 'd probably just play some other game when i was bored with minecraft  but they 're great eh !, 
  sorry was n't the body kept in a `` fridge '' ? 
  yeah they 're doing a very nice job  i hope they 're also moving to some other games soon though , i 'm eager to see what they can do and scrolls is n't my cup of tea, 
  lol , actually italian living in sweden :p, 
  yeah , i also had a good laugh , 
  had this problem for a while ... 
  i also try to eliminate torches from everything i build  unless it 's medieval style then it 's ok , but i thought it was funny to see the torch floating like that , 
  we 're doomed, 
  how do they know it sounded like this ? 
  does a language change so much in only 100 years ? 
  uhm ... 
  yeah we actually sold sardinia to the french and invaded switzerland . 
  it was full of italians anyway,
