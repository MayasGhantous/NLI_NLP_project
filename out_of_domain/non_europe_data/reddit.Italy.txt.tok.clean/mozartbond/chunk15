  europe is still fascist inside and the fire will start if there 's not some serious actions to stop immigrants from behaving like they do . 
  i live in sweden and boy i 'm starting to think , when i see a muslim : `` maybe he rapes his wife , maybe he 's responsible for his daughter genital mutilation , maybe he wants all of us to live under the sharia law '' . 
  i 'm sure not every single muslim here is like that but cases like norkopping 's school ( 28 out of 30 schoolgirls found to have had genital mutilations ) and the lack of strenght and action from the state do n't help, 
  i think that booksellers could n't afford more discount than 5 % ... they 're already out of the competition because amazon is selling at loss in many countries . 
  also , editors sell their product both to amazon and the booksellers , so i think they 're another story, 
  yeah you 're right ... maybe i 'm one of the immensely few people who still enjoy human interaction , going out and look for things rather than having stuff delivered with a drone at my door, 
  yeah but amazon can offer you such low prices because they can sell stuff at loss somewhere and regain somewhere else in the world . 
  with an indipendent cd store of course you 're paying more , the guy probably has only one shop in one town ... amazon should be restrained from selling products at loss , that is unfair competition !, 
  it 's like chinese shoe makers , of course nike is going to have them produce their products because they save a lot of money but in the long run every other shoe maker ( in the world ) is busted because of the incredible chinese regulations . 
  sorry i do n't need the same as you . 
  i like diversity in the market and anyway it is too late for other digital sellers now . 
  it 's like with google and search engines , there 's no competition whatsoever ( so if google decides one day to prevent you from finding products of competitors of their `` friend '' companies , you 'd just think that there 's no other company selling the products you want ) . 
  plus , physical books are still wide-spread in europe and very few people prefer the digital versions . 
  on a digital version you can put copyrights , sometimes you ca n't copy from your reader to another or copy it more than 3 times . 
  with a book , you can do whatever you want , from giving it to friends and share it or selling it again , it 's yours , nobody can take it away from you . 
  there should be no drm whatsoever , i believe . 
  it 's a job of the state to prevent plagiarism and illegal copy selling , not the seller ... 
  it 's like if car makers where putting sensors on your car to prevent you from speeding and instead of giving the data to the police they 'd sue you for using their car badly !, 
  wtf, 
  not completely true come on . . 
  i find classical music all the time both in fnac and italian stores like lafeltrinelli and mondadori . 
  of course , if you want the last cd of a specific performer then you 'll have to go into a specialized store but for `` mainstream '' things such as beethoven symphonies , debussy , ravel and the like you can find things . 
  but i also found a vynil of a andr\u00e9s segovia recording in an indipendent bookstore, 
  yes yes i know , to be honest even in specialized stores you only find the now very low quality ( sometimes ) deutsche grammophone recordings ( deutsche grammophone has become really the prostitute of record companies . 
  they publish everything as soon as you pay them enough , it 's ridicolous ) , some naxos and emi and that 's it . 
  there 's plenty of cds left out all the time and it 's a stupid business policy , because as you say you do n't find what you want and big companies like amazon can instead buy and sell everything . 
  what i was trying to say about classical music is that for the general consumer , not the connoisseur , they have stuff . 
  and classical music will die if people do n't find it anymore going around in shops , also , not only at concerts . 
  there 's people that sometimes hear a piece and they do n't know what it is , how do you find it on amazon ? 
  if you do n't know what you 're looking for , that website is useless , while at a shop maybe you can find someone who knows what you 're talking about . 
  yes . 
  if the eu wants to keep going they have to make eu tax union and other laws to prevent evading . 
  but this will never happen because of the interests of the single countries, 
  as i said , they sell can sell at loss in ** some ** countries and regain in others . . 
  lol i too did n't have any idea about how water works ... 
  i remember once i tried to create an artificial lake in a valley ... ** one bucket at a time **, 
  actually not , in italy google has been forced to pay its taxes . 
  well it 's not the author , it 's who owns the rights . 
  ultimately , the editors, 
  yeah dude thanks but i 'm fine now !, 
  ahahah i was talking about like 2 years ago, 
  well anyway the planet ca n't sustain billions and billions of humans . 
  it does n't matter if people think it 's their right to have children to be honest ... that 's their opinion , but the ** fact ** is that the population is growing too much and too fast in very poor countries where they do n't give a shit about green economy . 
  does n't matter if in europe we work our butts to produce less waste if they keep polluting the shit out of their place . 
  see , you 're also getting downvotes ahahah damn yankees ca n't say no to their 5kg of meat a week eh ? 
  i know , it 's not simple and i seriously hope some measures will be taken ( apparently not though , as in china they 've taken away the 1 child law ... ), 
  ahahahah thanks for sharing because it was funny , but the idea was very neat !, 
  it should be a feature of iron trapdoors actually , how cool would that be ? 
  what do you mean about the solar powered cars ? 
  cars which , by the way , are not so likely to happen ... 
  i guess it 's easier to have batteries and charge them normally . 
  they were not being good it was the least they could do . 
  stupid idiot if you shoot a dog like that it means you do n't have the nerves to hold a gun and you should find another job . 
  a fucking dog behind a fence and you feel threatened ? 
  bitch please i hope the officer was a stupid retard and got scared and he did n't do it for fun, 
  what happened to that `` officer '' ? 
  omg a fly in the food !!!!! 11 !!!! one !, 
  what 's frightening is that all this us high-end military equipment will be sized by isis ( who apparently knows better how to use it ... ), 
  eeeh . . dude , i 've seen so many burqas around europe and i do n't think the muslism really come for freedom . 
  it 's for money . . you know the reel . 
  of course many of them are against the sharia but there 's also plenty who are pretty strict with their beliefs, 
  finally !, 
  yes i get your point , but it 's not everything about co2 . 
  just look at how they treat industrial waste in those countries , the fact they cut massive chunks of forests for agricolture ( food that will fly to us most of the time ) etc. . of course we produce more co2 , but try to compare population from cities and see the pro-capite co2 , then it 's different i guess . 
  i do n't think that in berlin they make more co2 than in bombay , pro capite of course, 
  til us is a police state were they can arrest you just to have you shut up, 
  yes but technically you ca n't declare war on a terrorist organization ... anyway bush handled the thing like the us are the world police and in the end bin laden was even killed without the chance of an international trial and interrogation . 
  none in the international community has ever said anything about this and it 's been a harsh demonstration that the us are above the rules and can invade whoever state they want on the basis of lies about weapons ( because they do n't have them so they 're entitled to say who has the rights to own those weapons of course ), 
  so they want islam to be the base of the state , but they also want to elect the leader . 
  and this is not like leaving under a religious dictator ? 
  i think it is . . just because you 're changing a leader every now and then it does n't mean you 're not under a totalitarian state . 
  actually by using islam laws in the state you 're forcing everyone to be muslim etc etc. . . 
  the correct latin is pro capite . 
  i do n't know why it 's said per capita in english speaking countries . 
  anyway !, 
  about the towns i 'm curious to know , because when you make the count of the population in india and see how much everyone is polluting , you 're taking into account a large part of population that is leaving in extreme poverty and almost auto-sustaining itself with agricolture etc. 
  so this people are lowering the pro capite co2 production a lot . 
  my guess is that if you take in account just the people leaving in 2 cities the story is different . 
  but i may be wrong eh . . 
  also i 'm not saying there 's nothing we can do , but i 'd like to see more efforts globally , especially in those countries were `` everything '' is allowed . . they 're corrupt and allow high levels of pollution behind the fact that they 're developing and they have the right to do so . 
  i 've studied latin in school for 8 years . 
  `` per '' is not a latin word , it 's an italian word today and has the same meaning of `` pro '' . 
  `` capite '' is single form of `` head '' , capita is plural and in latin it 's wrong . 
  the translation is `` for head '' `` for each head '' meaning for each person . 
  for some reason in america the form per capita is used , but it comes from very late latin after the empire . 
  it sounds bad to me , i 'm sorry . 
  anyway it 's already interesting to see how mumbai emits 3.83 a year per person while the average is 1.6 . . no ? 
  auto-sorting mega chest room, 
  have you tweeted mojang ? 
  hello from italy !, 
   what do you think the pope and the whole church can do in order to calm down the situation in the middle-east ? 
  what is the church 's position about isis ? 
  edit : missing word, 
  boom !, 
  in his face !, 
  sweden is pretty safe and nice , if you do n't mind a bit of snow ... 
  fastest ... a hamburger i guess , best for me would be a salad and some tuna, 
  in scandinavia is pretty common to see houses with overgrown rooftops , in the countryside . 
  it 's pretty cool and very good insulation in summer . 
  in winter the snow acts as insulation , instead,
