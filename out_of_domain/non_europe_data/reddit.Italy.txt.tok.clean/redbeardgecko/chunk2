  single particles actually pass through solid barriers all the time .

  in tal caso puppa !, 
  i recently had pneumonia , and it made me realize that i would have been dead now if it were n't for antibiotics , which were only properly discovered in 1928 . 
  it 's strange to think that i might not have been alive anymore because of something that is now * very * easily cured .

  i still have this weird and unlikely wet dream that they 'll team up with disney imagineering and come up with insane ideas for some attractions . 
  it kind of makes sense , since their perceived family-friendly appearance would go well with the disney brand .

  this is actually the reason why amazon re-released the kindle basic model in black instead of gray : it makes the screen look whiter in comparison .

  from what i remember they * had * to turn it off , because the coil melted from excessive stress . 
  i used to absolutely love it when i first discovered it in 2009 , then they seemed to gradually standardize on a single kind of sound and most of the differences between producers started to disappear . 
  i also became a lot softer , but that 's really a matter of personal taste . 
  i was always a sucker for buncy kicks + basses . 
  around 2009-2011 was the golden age , in my opinion : in early hardstyle everybody was using the same samples , in modern hardstyle it 's mostly the same style for everybody except for a few producers . 
  i realise i probably sound like a hipster , but i guess it 's just evolution in taste . 
  i 'd love for people to prove me wrong , though !, 
  here are some examples of what i consider to be the best examples of variety back then :, 
  * [ tuneboy - i will growl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gejbjqtszb8&amp;t=36s ) \u00e7 one of the bounciest kick-bass combinations ever, 
  * [ noisecontrollers - ctrl.alt.delete ] ( http://youtu.be/f0kxy7mqhlw?t=58s ) : this track becomes pure awesomeness once the melody kicks in , and the outro is just and example of perfect sound design that i 'm really struggling to find these days, 
  * [ crypsis feat . 
  sasha f - get hit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5fn1qkitjy ) : crypsis was one of the first to integrate hardcore-y kicks into hardstyle , and coupled with a friggin ' catchy melody he put out this masterpiece, 
  * [ dj phil ty - a kay a ( ehm ... 
  mix ) ] ( http://youtu.be/jxpwombavfk?t=50s ) : technoboy and tuneboy had this gift for turning the most stupid vocals into catchy stuff by coming up with a fantastic kick + bass for every track . 
  the melody is pretty great too . 
  * [ tuneboy - re-generate it ] ( http://youtu.be/9jqhy76o5f0?t=51s ) : starting to notice a pattern here ? 
  once again , silly vocal , catchy melody and kick + bass . 
  this wreaks havoc on a big system . 
  * [ headhunterz & wildstylez vs. noisecontrollers - tonight ] ( http://youtu.be/6tgp7w_huk4?t=40s ) : wildstylez ? 
  what are you , a dj ? 
  anyway , this was huge when it came out . 
  to me it feels like the perfect party anthem , but with enough original ideas to stand out from the crowd of usual bangers . 
  * [ wildstylez - k.y.h.u. 
  ( noisecontrollers rmx ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zk6foqbi2u ) : here we 're starting to get a bit formulaic , but that kind of reverse bass in the initial part just doesns happen anymore in hardstyle , and it makes me kinda sad . 
  * [ wildstylez - huh ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3ttsvncx9m ) : when this came out everybody was like hurr durr wuts that kick i want mah boings , but it 's still one of the more experimental hardstyle tracks of al time . 
  * [ showtek - black ] ( http://youtu.be/mmqv5sjh7ko?t=1m18s ) : this is the oldest of all these tracks , but i still feel like it 's the best . 
  probably because it 's the one that first got me addicted to hardstyle . 
  thing is , i feel like you would be able to discern he different styles of different producers in these tracks , whereas now it 's getting more and more homogeneous between artists . 
  i do n't know , maybe i 'm just looking in the wrong places . 
  please : if you 're a current hardstyle fan and can show me some cool recent track , please do so !, 
  i 've been craving for some `` oldschool '' stuff . 
  i actually watched it at the toronto film festival !, 
  it was pretty great , i got ta say . 
  very surreal . 
  i never watched the first nor the second movie , though , so i do n't know how it fares by comparison . 
  for me it 's usually scummvm to play old adventure games . 
  i have it on everything !, 
  this really reminds me of the lbj glitch in mario 64 . 
  i can see the disappointment in your dashes . 
  turin is a fantastic place to be . 
  regardless of what the torinesi will say , ever since the winter olympics it 's just been getting better and better ; the city is turning into an incredibly lively city , with plenty of things to do , lots of art and history , and a big english speaking community . 
  it 's often called the `` paris of italy , '' mostly due to the very similar architecture and for its constant intertwining with french culture and people throughout the centuries . 
  it also has the added perk of being _ way _ less chaotic than rome . 
  i swear to god , i would ** not ** want to drive a car in rome , whereas turin is waaaay more manageable , and the public transportation system is pretty well organized , if you do n't feel like having to deal with italian drivers . 
  a lot of your experience will be determined by where in town you 'll decide to live . 
  the downtown area ( il * centro * ) is the gorgeous , full of life heart of the city , but it 's expensive , a bit more annoying for things like grocery shopping , and can also be a bit sketchy in some areas , but that 's true of every big multicultural city . 
  if you can afford it , though , you 'll be rewarded by being minutes away from stunning places like [ piazza castello ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2040/2272070767_26af30602a.jpg ) , [ piazza vittorio ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/piazza_vittorio_veneto.jpg ) ( one of the biggest _ piazzas _ in europe , full of clubs , pubs , bars , and the like ) , [ monte dei cappuccini ] ( http://www.ikol22.com/images/20081228032123_cappuccini_back850.jpg ) , and the [ mole antonelliana ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/mole_torino.jpg ) , home of the [ cinema ] ( http://www.filmforlife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/museo_del_cinema_torino.jpg ) [ museum ] ( http://kidsarttourism.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/mole-interno.jpg ) . 
  the downtown area is also where a lot of concerts are held all throughout the year , and where most of the big happenings in the city take place . 
  if you 'd like to save a bit of money , you can move towards the outer edge : the _ periferia _ , where life is cheaper and generally more convenient but , just like american suburbs , you start to lose the `` gorgeous italy '' feeling and everything becomes a bit more plain . 
  this does n't mean that it gets any more boring though : reaching the downtown area still takes only around 30-40 minutes with transit , depending on how well served your neighborhood is . 
  the different neighborhoods offer themselves quite a bit of entertainment , places to be , and things to do . 
  they 're all quite different from a demographic point of view : some places are more posh and conservative , other more open and multicultural . 
  if you like hiking , turin is surrounded by incredible vistas , villages , and historical locations thanks to the proximity to the alps . 
  the [ sacra di s. michele ] ( http://www.sacradisanmichele.com/uploads/gallery/438.jpg ) comes to mind . 
  there are also closer museums , like the huge [ reggia di venaria ] ( http://www.venaria-reale.com/images/giardini.jpg ) , or the [ palazzina di caccia di stupinigi ] ( http://www.parks.it/fotonews/stupinigi_g.jpg ) . 
  now let 's talk about what 's wrong with the city . 
  first of all , _ it 's humid _ . 
  this means that , even if it does n't usually get below -5 / -6 during cold winters , it 's gon na feel worse because it gets to your bones . 
  same thing with the summer heat . 
  winters also tend to be quite grey and rainy . 
  if you really ca n't stand winters , this could be a deal-breaker , but in my opinion the beauty of summer makes up for it ^ if ^ you ^ can ^ stand ^ 38degrees . 
  the people . 
  now this is very hit or miss : it really depends on what kind of person you are and how you form new friendships . 
  middle-age and older people tend to be slightly rude and closed in a big-town kind of way . 
  their mentality is often : `` i 'm just going to work . 
  please do n't bother me , ask somebody else , '' but if you make it clear that you just need directions or help , then people will help you . 
  just do n't expect small talk with strangers , because it ai n't gon na happen . 
  young people tend to be a lot more social , especially because the city has a substantial student population coming from all over italy . 
  there 's also a discrete amount of native english speakers in the downtown area , mostly girls in their 20s working as au-pairs or families that moved from the states . 
  the language . 
  `` no '' is probably all you 're going to hear if you ask `` do you speak english ? '' . 
  a lot of us really do n't speak it . 
  blame our education system for not stressing how important knowing english is in the modern world , or , with older generations , for not teaching it at all .
