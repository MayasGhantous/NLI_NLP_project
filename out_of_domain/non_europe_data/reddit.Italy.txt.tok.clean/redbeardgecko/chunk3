  if you try to learn the basics and how to ask to speak slowly , you should be pretty much ok for basic stuff . 
  if you 're looking for italian courses i can refer you to a great school : my girlfriend is canadian , and in a matter of a few months she went from knowing a few words to getting a c2 fluency certificate . 
  all in all , i think you can tell from all the adjectives i used that i 'm quite in love with the turin area . 
  i think it 's a great place to live : not so touristy as to bother you , and not so secluded to feel restricted . 
  let me know if you 'd like to know more !, 
  there , now you 've made me homesick . 
  for a long time as a kid i had this theory that whenever you die for reasons that are not old age , the universe splits in two : in one universe you 're dead , but in the other one you miraculously survive , and that 's where your existence continues . 
  when you see somebody else die because of a disease or a car accident , it simply means that you 're in the universe where that person died , but he/she 's living on somewhere else . 
  then in time i realized that it was a fun idea , but it clashed with the agnostic views that i developed growing up . 
  reformatted for convenience !, 
   here !, 
  here !, 
  here !, 
   i lived in both cities !, 
  i miss turin and i would miss rome when i will leave . 
   ** weather ** :, 
   turin is the worst italian city for the weather . 
   ** pollution ** :, 
  ( no wind in turin , lots of pm10 ), 
   ** food ** :, 
   ** night life ** :, 
  turin has a very good night life , but rome is slighty better and offers more choice, 
   ** costs ** :, 
   ** life quality ** :, 
  turin has very good services and a less chaotic life . 
   ** people ** :, 
  turin has less * burini *, 
   ** racism ** :, 
  in rome , you will be treated as a romanian . 
  romans do n't like romanians, 
   ** economic crisis ** :, 
  piedmont is facing a terrible crisis , more than lazio . 
  i 'm an engineer and i had to leave my hometown in piedmont . 
   ** girls ** :, 
   ** friends ** :, 
  i hate to say it , but it is easier to find friends in rome than in turin ( at least for me ), 
   ** quiet ** :,

  somebody should write a script that tells you if you should upvote a post or not , depending on its length and its score at the moment . 
  hahahahaha, 
  blind luck . 
  i was on vacation with my family in a rented house . 
  i was just about to take a shower , and decided to feel the temperature with my hand before going in . 
  little did i know that a wire in the house electric water heater had peeled and was touching the water pipe . 
  220 volts went straight through my arm and made it violently jerk back . 
  had i gone in head first i might not have been here to tell the story . 
  we got a small discount on the rent . 
  ehh , i could have just as well decided to go in without testing the temperature first . 
  it was really just chance . 
  it does look way busier . 
  impressive how a change in art can alter so much the perception of the entire table . 
  i 'm very curious to try it , though , since those two ramp shots in the middle seem to monopolize the field . 
  well , he goes over basically everything , but says so when he 's about to drop so me major spoilers . 
  that 's exactly what we 've done a couple hours after i took the picture , we just did n't have the energy to do it right away . 
  thanks !, 
  thanks !, 
  yeah , they 're awesome . 
  we 're very proud of how the project turned out . 
  i 'll take a look , but i have a feeling that they wo n't ship to canada . 
  thanks for the heads up , though !, 
  this project was a lot of fun , yeah !, 
  heh , close , it 's mature student housing . 
  thank you , we 're quite proud of it !, 
  thanks , christmas redditor !, 
  that was one of the most amazing things i 've seen in a while , even with the crappy stream quality . 
  hopefully views from the various projection locations will pop up in the next few days !, 
  i 'm still watching the stream to keep me company , and they 're bringing all the floats back to small world via main street now . 
  is this normal procedure once the park closes ? 
  i always imagined they had a way to go all the way back while sneaking backstage , but i guess not . 
  honestly i think that if you 've been there for lunch already , then you probably should n't bother with dinner . 
  it 's a bit on the expensive side , and the experience is probably not different enough to be worth it , in my opinion !, 
  unfortunately the original was pretty low res , so the labels are not easily legible . 
  correct , that 's why i said basement in the title !, 
  unfortunately it would be very hard to show both levels at the same time , but to be fair all the ground floor has is the bayou , which is fairly straightforward in terms of layout . 
  the first drop is actually that black line you can barely see on top of the facades , at the bottom right of the entrance building . 
  you 're right in that it 's parallel to the upramp , and it overlaps that way because it happens underground !, 
  if you look closely you 'll see the entrance on the bottom left of the picture . 
  i know , unfortunately the layout picture i used was kinda low res . 
  check the overhead picture i posted in a comment above , that one 's easier to read !, 
  that 's to bring you back to the front building !, 
  if you look at the picture you 'll notice that there are two tunnels going through the middle part between buildings : one is the cave with the mist screen , the other one is precisely the section you talk about !, 
  yeap , there is . 
  it 's the narrow tunnel just before the ship battling with the fort , where they project davy jones on a mist screen . 
  oh wow , i knew that dinosaur used the same ride system , but i did n't know that even the layout was exactly the same !, 
  too bad the theming is n't nearly as good as indy . 
  your work is actually what inspired me to make this !, 
  thank you for your amazing work !, 
  i 'm working on a few other attractions now . 
  i was wondering if you 'd be willing to share the original vector files , though , as flickr horribly mangles your work with jpg compression , and the lack of anti-aliasing is a bit sore on the eyes . 
  yeah , doombuggies is a great site , 
  looks like it !, 
  it 's that long , but it appears even longer when you 're looking at it !, 
  i wonder if it 's going to be a more traditional bumper car ride . 
  seems logical considering the theme , and it would be close in spirit to what luigi 's flying tires was . 
  i 'm definitely curious . 
  you 're right , i had totally forgotten about that ride . 
  huh , now i 'm even _ more _ curious !, 
  the midi standard prescribes channel 10 as the percussion track , so fl helps you out by labeling what drum/percussion instrument the note corresponds to . 
  nope , the image you included is of the two floors overlaid onto each other , not the two rides .
