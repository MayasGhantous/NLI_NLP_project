  * you _ win _ or you die, 
  haha , i was wondering why i had a link that was already purple on my frontpage . 
  that video has helped me get through the disney blues so many times !, 
  he got you . 
  yeah , but it 's tricky to notice for a foreigner . 
  with ns and ms you just make the sound longer , whereas with plosives and co. you add a slight pause before the letter to make it sound `` longer '' . 
  ... did you ... did you mean prosciutto ? 
  a very similar thing actually happened in my hometown back in italy . 
  somebody opened a gourmet burger place , using only the finest local meats and ingredients , yadda , yadda , yadda . 
  they decided to call it macbun , which is obviously a play on mcd 's , but also happens to mean `` how tasty ! '', 
  in the local dialect . 
  within a year or so , they were sued into altering the name , which they promptly changed to m ** bun . 
  seems to work [ pretty well ] ( http://i.imgur.com/opn7sbc.png ) . 
  this is very , very cool . 
  that electromechanical duck hunt from nintendo was incredible . 
  sometimes they do that with computer controlled cameras which are able to perfectly repeat the very same movements , other times somebody manually replaces the green stuff in post production by drawing over it . 
  the band is elio e le storie tese . 
  apart from being a cult comedy band in italy , they 're also incredibly skilled musicians . 
  a lot of their songs are an insane mixture of eclectic and complex arrangements , with lyrics composed primarily of fart/dick jokes and juvenile humor . 
  [ here 's their wikipedia page if you feel like reading up on them . 
  they have always been very keen on performing everything live , often going to great lengths to ensure that they have a perfect sound on stage . 
  this , however , was a top of the pops-like tv show were the producers wanted to have everything under total control , so being a comedy band they decided to protest in a more obvious ( and hilarious ) way than just switching up their roles like other bands in the same situation . 
  hah , yeap , it 's a parody/celebration of disco music , aptly titled discomusic . 
  a lot of their lyrics are voluntarily written as an almost nonsensical stream of consciousness , like something that a kid would write in elementary school . 
  they probably get together , smoke a whole lot of stuff , and write down the first thing that goes through their mind , then they set it to music . 
  the lyrics are something to the effect of :, 
   disco music , disco music ,, 
   i like you a lot because, 
   you make everybody dance ,, 
   and sometimes you make me dance too . 
   with my bell-shaped pants i will dance, 
   little dances just as well as john travolta . 
   disco music , disco music ,, 
   you 're very addictive , disco music . 
   i love you then i hate you, 
   then i love you then i hate you then i appreciate you ,, 
   and i sing : `` please do n't let me be misunderstood '', 
   while i park my [ alfasud ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alfa_romeo_alfasud ) in the parking lot ,, 
   and i dart to the dancefloor, 
   because disco music is about to start ,, 
   that one from the 70s ,, 
   with that typical, 
   kick , snare , and hi-hat rhythm . 
   and if you see me sitting in * this party * [ * in english in the original lyrics * ], 
   just know that i 'm waiting for dance music , dance music ,, 
   dance music , do n't worry , the dj 's gon na spin it . 
  and so on and so forth . 
  [ this is the original video ] ( https://youtu.be/kr2nbzj1jta?t=59s ) , if you 're interested . 
  crazy , crazy stuff . 
  the music itself is full of citations of classic disco tunes from the 70s and 80s . 
  `` it-could-work ** s ** '' ? 
  you 've been living under a huge rock , because they did indeed open one at lingotto with great fanfare last year !, 
  go get some wings !, 
  thanks !, 
  i was actually impressed by the subtle dubstep hints in some parts of paint the night . 
  it 's probably my favourite parade soundtrack so far !, 
  thanks !, 
  if you go around my youtube/soundcloud channels you 'll definitely find a bunch more disney remixes :d, 
  caravan palace are amazing , they were definitely an inspiration for this track !, 
  sure thing !, 
  you can download it from [ the soundcloud page for the track ] ( https://soundcloud.com/iamjackg/grim-grinning-ghosts-jackg-electro-swing-remix-free-download ) , 
  if soundcloud does n't work for you just let me know and i 'll put it on my website . 
  hah , thanks !, 
  i love playing with sounds like that . 
  glad you enjoyed it !, 
  wow guys , thank you so much for all the kind words !, 
  i 'm glad you liked it . 
  you all made my day , 
  i agree , that track is way better than the # 1 in almost every aspect , except for the lack of vocals . 
  i highly recommend that you ( or any mod ) install [ naut ] ( / r/naut ) as the subreddit 's theme . 
  it 's simple , customizable , and very well designed . 
  as a testament to its validity , it 's currently used by hundreds of subreddits . 
  in a few easy steps :, 
  [ download the zip for the theme here ] ( https://github.com/axel--/naut-for-reddit/archive/master.zip ), 
  paste the css from the ` naut 4 - main css file.css ' file into the css textarea . 
  upload the images from the / images / folder . 
  ( do n't rename them ! ), 
  hit save !, 
  actually , if you give me a few minutes i 'll whip up some kind of temporary header image , although it would be nice to have the original logo file . 
  not pretty by any means , but it will do until i have a moment to make something fancier . 
  and finally i would add this at the end of the css , to remove the sidebar image , which might be a bit redundant . 
  . side : before { display : none }, 
  . titlebox . fancy-toggle-button { top : calc ( 314px - 80px ) }, 
  . comments-page . side . linkinfo { top : calc ( 494px - 80px ) },

  / * end addon * /, 
  you can edit the colors to match your brand 's scheme with an addon . 
  you can find a few useful addons [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/naut/wiki/index ) . 
  they 're just snippets that go at the end of the css . 
  let me know if you would like more information about all this !, 
  that was very well put together , as disney does , but was incredibly disappointing park-wise . 
  very , very little actually concerned disneyland in any way except for having been shot there . 
  thanks !, 
  animation was definitely the part that took me the longest . 
  after effects is a bit cumbersome , but the results are great !, 
  i 'm glad you enjoyed it :d, 
  thanks !, 
  i will definitely mention how the hardware could be expanded with extra neat stuff in the cartridges .
