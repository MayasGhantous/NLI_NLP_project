  [ here ] ( http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0580/0965/products/72dpi-videogames_world_map-full.jpg?v=1428514980 ) there is a bigger size view of the map, 
  just to be clear : i did not make this , i only found it and posted it here, 
  well , nice to see that he 's ok - ish, 
  you are right : [ fixed !, 
  holy shit , that outtro music . 
  too bad . 
  / r/firstworldanarchists would have been proud of you . 
  yes , [ that was duncan 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/sips/comments/37eljy/sips_vaping_at_comicon/crm8qqf ), 
  i really ca n't decide what element of this pic is the most hilarious but the writing `` let 's get physical '' on the shirt is the icing on the cake . 
  the [ ponte vecchio ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ponte_vecchio ) in florence , italy , has [ houses built on it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ponte_vecchio#/media/file:panorama_of_the_ponte_vecchio_in_florence,_italy.jpg ) . 
  it all started because nobles wanted the butchers to move from the center of the city ( due to the smell they made ) . 
  the butchers moved their shop to the bridge and later on they added some small rooms on the side of the bridge shoring them up with wooden poles . 
  some time later the bridge became the joining path between the political center of the city and palazzo pitti , the noble house , and the goldsmiths took over the shops which became permanent structures . 
  now suppose that something like this could happen in a fantasy world but with the difference that the developement of the bridge countinues . 
  the bridge get enlarged and it gets bigger housing more and more structure until the point when it can be considered a small town . 
  this could be an explaination . 
  edit : grammar , more or less, 
  it is inside out so it 's like it is containing the entire universe from inside the universe itself . 
  a week ago / u/jmh10331 posted a picture in / r/wtf with [ this explaination ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/37s1f7/earthworms_grouping_together_to_survive_the_texas/crpgw89 ), 
  every time i saw dogmeat stealing kills from mike i imagined them be like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t0bj0tf.jpg ) . 
  ca n't wait to see other `` oh , you '' moments . 
  amazing . 
  you know that a song is good when people start making covers of it . 
  [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/t1rxdtw.jpg ) is the answer . 
  yes , please !, 
  zemnl is the username, 
  it 's definitely shai-hulud, 
  i was watching hole diggers when he came to check their golf course and i remember i thought : `` who is this guy ? 
  what an asshole !, 
  i hate this guy . 
  go away , i 'm here to see only simon , lewis and duncan ! '', 
  then , later , i read somewhere about this genuinely funny guy called sips and i decided to give him a try . 
  now i do n't miss any of his videos and he is the only one of the yogs that i watch regularly . 
  also known as rythian simulator . 
  i 'd like to see him playing it . 
  edit : i tried it : changed my mind , i would n't watch anyone playing it . 
  go on then , i 'd make an exception for you of course . 
  i suggest trying the midsummer mode , i found it weirdly funny . 
  that makes two of us . 
  it 's [ majestic from wax fang ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b6e0mijv5a ), 
  you can find the whole trucking playlist [ here ] ( https://play.spotify.com/user/sips/playlist/0qietkmvy3zzhouprxue4a ), 
  in the video description there is a link to the stream . 
  it is from the 7th october stream , at 1h and 39 minutes, 
  come have a drink in here, 
  do n't remind me !, 
  as soon as i got my first mk ( pok3r ) i found out about the whitefox . 
  hopefully i 'll get one on the next drop ( even if it means that i have to wait almost a year ) . 
  i 'm gon na wait patiently for the second drop of the whitefox . 
  either that , or a plank . 
  nonono , with `` wait patiently for the second drop '' i meant `` wait for the end of the year when probably there will be another group buy on massdrop and finally ordered it '' . 
  i 'm quite jealous of you now :d the fox looks really amazing, 
  is there any other place where i can buy pbt keycaps with dsa profile other than pimpmykeyboard ? 
  oh ok , thanks, 
  italian here : i use the altgr variant of the usinternational so i can type \u00e1 \u00e9 \u00ed \u00f3 \u00fa with altgr + vowel . 
  the only problem was the '' \u00e8 '' ( that is really common in italian ) : the grave accent ( fn + esc ) is not a dead key so i remapped the ` on the esc key and now , weirdly , if i press altgr + esc on that layer it gives me the dead grave , so i decided to use that layer of my pok3r for typing in italian . 
  for me , being on linux , another possible solution would have been to use [ xmodmap ] ( https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xmodmap ) : basically it allows a full remap of the keyboard , i did not tried it though, 
  hopefully there will be another drop by the end of this year .

  your modifiers are the light gray variant or the dark grey ? 
  for some small tips about soldering you can watch [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6qvtmny9fo ) video of a defcon talk about soldering . 
  it is not long and it shows some examples of good and bad soldering and it gives advices and other cool infos . 
  i do know something about reverse engineering ( never disassembled arm stuff though ) . 
  sadly i do n't any have spare time to dedicate to this project until the end of february ( exams time ) , i hope i 'll be still somehow useful . 
  is there a place where i can follow the project in the meantime ? 
  perfect . 
  also , ( hopefully ) in a month or two i 'm going to have a working version of an ida plugin that will be useful , 
  i live in italy and , if you are reeeally lucky , the only mechs that you can find in shops are razers ... 
  lollipops , or candy shop, 
  he has no idea : this guy spent the last days reposting stuff . 
  this is probably another stolen pic . 
  there is no real fix , i also tried to contact twitter support without any success . 
  the only thing you can do is waiting : i read somewhere that it could be a caching issue . 
  i deleted all my tweets with a 3rd party app too and the count was stuck at 9 tweets , then some times later it went to 4 . 
  hopefully it 'll go to 0, 
  `` the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy has a few things to say on the subject of towels . 
  a towel , it says , is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have . '', 
  this fucking guy . 
  he never stops does he ? 
  now you should remap all the keys in a whole layer to esc, 
  my therapy is downvoting you . 
  and i feel so good when i do it, 
  i second this . 
  a programmable keyboard with unix layout and mx/zealios switches would be perfect for me . 
  yeah !, 
  i just saw the group buy and it 's ~ ~ kinda ~ ~ tempting me, 
  edit : it ' veery tempting, 
  do n't mind him . 
  he is a troll . 
  he even posted some * stolen * pictures of hhkbs himself . 
  zoz is great !, 
  his are some of the most entertaining defcon talks ever . 
  i suggest you to watch also [ pwned by the owner ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ob28ksiio ) and [ and that 's how i lost my other eye ... explorations in data destruction ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bpx8yvng6y ) . 
  those ones made me binge watch almost all of the other defcon talks . 
  i listen to the adventure zone podcast . 
  it is hilarious . 
  they are 3 brothers and their dad playing 5th edition dnd . 
  sometimes they do n't care about strictly following the rules though , but just for sake of comedy .
