  you should find new friends , dude, 
  wtf was that, 
  my thought , when i saw [ this ] ( http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?start=225&amp;um=1&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1c1ldjz_engb509gb510&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=pj8bip_lsr-t5m:&amp;imgrefurl=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:pink_salmon_fws.jpg&amp;docid=m7jhowomti6qmm&amp;imgurl=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/pink_salmon_fws.jpg/1024px-pink_salmon_fws.jpg&amp;w=1024&amp;h=464&amp;ei=yxdouc6jn4nb0gws14dgca&amp;zoom=1&amp;ved=1t:3588,r:26,s:200,i:82&amp;iact=rc&amp;page=13&amp;tbnh=151&amp;tbnw=334&amp;ndsp=20&amp;tx=232&amp;ty=67 ), 
  lithuania is of relevance somewhere !, 
  the best what they can do for revenge is to copy a joke ? 
  this is not funny anymore, 
  dear sergio , fans demand you vs ggg, 
  at first i thought it is a wrecking ball and half destroyed tower ... 
  the ~ ~ undercover cop ~ ~ informant is a dick and must go to jail , this is clear to everybody . 
  but how people can relate it with racism ? 
  i am stunned . 
  i love how he just looks super calm before every fight . 
  looks much more bad-ass than any other guy who tries to intimidate oponent, 
  at first i thought it is interesting that `` dick is your internal clock '', 
  you can overdose everything , even [ water ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/water_intoxication ), 
  damn laugh track was lagging a bit, 
  us , liberia and myanmar - nice company hehehe, 
  [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/adviceanimals/comments/1jqoy1/he_even_got_angry_when_i_refused_to_share_the_fine/ ), 
  in one song there was a sound similar to coming tram . 
  multiple times the song made me dismount the bike as i was cycling near tram line, 
  well this is not necessarily because he though you can not be only friends . 
  just sometimes girlfriends/boyfriends make people lose their shit, 
  i do n't think it belongs here, 
  same color t-shirts are not very convenient for the spactators, 
  this is some awesome stuff, 
  the end was super funny , 
  if someone points out my mistakes and does n't make insulting jokes ( funny ones are ok ) , i 'm happy to learn from them . 
  hmm ... made me curious how it may feel there . 
  like in a rain , like being spilled from a bucket or like in a flood ? 
  wow , did n't expect it to be so hard, 
  firstly , i do n't know the rules . 
  i could learn them , but why ? 
  just because in case i may like to watch . 
  with the same logic i should try to learn many other sport and not only rules . 
  second , there are no teams ( at least that i would know ) with which i could identify my self , e.g. 
  national team , my town team , at least team in my country . 
  thirdly , i do n't watch too much sports , but the ones i watch are thus i like to do myself or i used to do them , e.g.basketball , football ( soccer ) , tennis , boxing . 
  so the place is already occupied and to take it something extraordinary should happen, 
  that is hilarious . 
  could you elaborate more on what happened when you realized you are in the wrong place ? 
  this one was a teaser, 
  nsfw ? 
  funny , in the very beginning i was writing almost identical commentary , but decided that it is too long :d, 
  well op come across everyday when in the office, 
  that was kind of smooth, 
  have the rider posted this himself somewhere ? 
  call ambulance . 
  maybe there is no need for ambulance . 
  there is ... there is, 
  so ... the kid is yours ? 
  edit : why down votes , it 's legit questions . 
  i do n't see how the guy is being better , except if op is worse , e.g. 
  does n't grow his own kids . 
  and the guy is just postponing inevitable, 
  if not the can , the two guys would look like a couple, 
  please ... do n't play with the same card in all the games . 
  it gets boring . 
  israel is not famous for cooperation when criminals have to be extradited . 
  this is rather exception . 
  edit : so down votes because i did n't see the point bringing up topic `` about other country extradition practices '' and the annoying jew-arab each other mocking in every possible topic even if it is not directly related with their relationship, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  lol, 
  i 'm a bit lazy to google now , but you can check that israeli passports are quite popular among eastern european and russian mafia members , just because israel usually does not extradite criminals . 
  it is widely known so you should not have a problem to get sources . 
  also regarding war criminals , one case that i remember : [ nachman dushanski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nachman_dushanski ) . 
  i always wondered ca n't you get hurt from the bullets that drop ? 
  but can it kill ? 
  my theoretical reasoning : there could be genes that are not intelligent related but , for example , disease related , while this disease may interrupt severely your learning process and as a consequence your `` intelligence '' . 
  while it is very reasonable to think these genes may be associated with a race . 
  of course , it could be argued that `` intelligence '' is a consequence of this disease , but if it is concentrated only in one race ? 
  i also think that link between race and intelligence is more difficult to find because nobody wants to look for it and than be called racist, 
  i can confirm this is true and the practice still exists . 
  source : i 'm lithuanian, 
  we do not siege towns for meat anymore , we prefer western tourist , whom we let for nice walks in our old towns before the * production * , as lean meat is more trendy now, 
  it is widely known in lithuania that he was among thus who were killed ( actually tortured to deaf ) . 
  he was not some low rank guy who was hiding for 50 years . 
  my memory could mislead but i think he himself did n't try to deny it too much . 
  thus even if ** theoretically ** prosecutors had some antisemitic motivation , why he should be let go free ? 
  however , i do not believe that he was singled out , because there was very big society 's pressure to find and prosecute soviet criminals overall and also because it is not a single case . 
  there were multiple attempts to bring this type of guys from russia , which also does not cooperate . 
  well in eastern europe we have similar cuisines, 
  gasp means that everybody know what the picture represents , thus not everything lost yet, 
  not , it was taken when they were very young, 
  well , this was entertaining, 
  nice bird in the meme have an upvote, 
  til some women do n't know themselves where do they pee out of, 
  edit : made this conclusion while reading the comments, 
  it somehow reminded me [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/hpkw9pp ), 
  well i have seen a polish and a slovak talking to each other in their languages , so maybe it is, 
  still a nice story, 
  we got the rule who puts first dirty dish in a sink and leaves it he has to clean everything later, 
  it is not an advice it is a law, 
  it really surprises me how often people do n't even stop and just move along, 
  some people say movies are only imagination, 
  well according to surveys [ ] ( http://eastbook.eu/en/2013/06/uncategorized-en/92671/ ) russians do not like baltic countries, 
   france 's national aviation police , the gta , is leading the investigation, 
  hehehe, 
  when the party begins ? 
  just put a cement block in the middle of the pavement . 
  it will be more effective and safer than 3 people guarding it all day .
