  cro cop : good fight and tap wounded shoulder, 
  in lithuania if you refuse to blow into a tube or give blood , police just applies you the harshest possible penalty for drunk driving . 
  it does n't matter whether you were drunk or not or how much . 
   palestinian refugees, 
  one of the problems is that they are `` refugees '' at their homeland, 
   this could all be easily solved if we just took the roman approach and enslaved/killed those that disagreed, 
  roman approach ? 
  why not hitlers ? 
  the translator to the russian was terrible , but yes these two questions were answered pretty much like that .

   similar to every british tank since the centurion , and most other british afvs , challenger 2 contains a boiling vessel ( bv ) also known as a kettle or bivvie for water which can be used to brew tea , produce other hot beverages and heat boil-in-the-bag meals contained in ration packs . 
  [ 13 ] this bv requirement is general for armoured vehicles of the british armed forces , and is unique to the armed forces of the uk . 
  pretty much sums up how important is tea for british, 
  could you give source , please ? 
  yes , but it is not often that a random guy just starts talking and texting you out of nowhere . 
  how politely to turn that down ? 
  or shall i turn that down at all ? 
  well this works if other person knows your situation well . 
  but how about a situation when a person you unavoidably meet sometimes but is not a friend ( so does n't know my situation and i 'm not talking about my sexual preferences with him ) and he is `` super '' friendly to you . 
  he does not openly try to pick you , but show huge a attention to you ? 
   i would deflect it as politely as possible, 
  partly , this is what i 'm trying to find out, 
  well , i assumed that gay men know i 'm not gay too . 
  i guess , that is partly why i 'm confused now . 
  recently , i met quite a few gays and it not often obvious and not always even suspicious . 
  i think the same is for them and it is not that you rush to announce your heterosexuality if you just met someone . 
  if act normal with them that would also may include going out for some drinks but that probably would send wrong signal ? 
  thanks for your answer . 
  would you go out for drinks with them ? 
  if you want to keep your and her image , convince her to show that she wants to divorce . 
  you are not going to be the bad guy who leaves his disabled wife and nobody will need to know that she was unfaithful, 
  did that twice with the same girl . 
  she did n't look bad or something , i was just not attracted to her . 
  however , she `` caught '' me heavily intoxicated in the party and we ended up at hers place . 
  i got out before getting sober and , when i think now , just because of alcohol it was not very awful but far from good . 
  next thing , in a week or two she unexpectedly arrives at my place . 
  i was sober . 
  to get her of me and because of `` does n't matter had sex '' attitude , i had sex with her . 
  it was worst case ever . 
  i literally felt like fucking a piece of meat . 
  disgusted about myself and her . 
  zero pleasure . 
  this was probably felt by her too , so i do n't think she had any pleasure either . 
  i finished as fast as possible and asked her to leave . 
  conclusion : not worth , especially if you know her but beer goggles do help . 
  somehow was disappointed about the `` perfect '' steak . 
  you have to season or marinade at least a few hours before ( best a day before ) to feel a nice taste not only outside of the steak . 
  now look to the sky . 
  somewhere there live intelligent creatures who think the same about humans of earth as we about sentinalese, 
  whenever you are getting ready to go somewhere and she asks what 's the time , tell here 5-15 min ( depends on the situation and experience ) later time . 
  this + you should n't be so sensitive . 
  i do n't know how you too usually interact and in what manner that was said but this kind of sensitivity will make you only harm and not only in work environment, 
  what ? 
  battle of thermopylae, 
  would n't it be easier to start deconstructing from the very top ? 
  why they make it more complicated ? 
  try to call your ex, 
  all these details . 
  awesome . 
  entertain people with clowns , acrobats and trained lions, 
  i think zimbabwe is a bad example , as it was doing quite well just after decolonisation, 
  he did well in the end . 
  you just need to delete facebook , lawyer up and hit the gym, 
  lithuania supports you !, 
  we need 3 pi, 
  of course it is a specific angle , but it it 's not that i purposefully was searching for it , just to make interesting picture . 
  it is what i saw while walking around museum, 
  estonia happy , estonia into nordic friends, 
  well , if he really was innocent and feels like this but had to threw out couple years of his life just for trials , plus ruined reputation , than i do not see it such an evil to make some money , just as reparation . 
  it is not very moral , but not evil . 
  whoa whoa whoa , dude , this shit is not european , this is british, 
  do you know what she have done ? 
  how she may not know ? 
  thanks, 
  i do n't know who gave you downvotes but i appreciate every time when someone corrects my mistakes , even if they tease me, 
   every person i 've ever met who is learning english asks to be corrected, 
  true, 
  up vote , as this seems to be single reply to the question , 
  fools !, 
  it was chicken and cow, 
  yep , not everyone is able to see both sides of similar stories . 
  but [ hitler ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sudetenland#sudeten_crisis ) was ... 
  western europe was thinking exactly the same , when they advised to give up sudetenland for nazi germany . 
  did n't end well ... 
  i 'm not referring to similarities in ideology but how to his acts in international arena and how `` leading '' countries respond to him, 
  let 's take sex out of it and say you just get flat out wasted at a bar . 
  we 're talking stumbling , incoherent rambling drunk . 
  now let 's say the bartender , seeing you are completely incapacitated , says to you , `` i 'll give you one last drink , its is as usual 5 bucks '' you , being drunk , hand over your 5 dollars , pound that jack and coke , and take a cab home . 
  the next day when you try to get your 5 dollars back , the bartender laughs and says `` sorry , it 's mine now . 
  you payed it to me for a jack and coke last night . '', 
  no court in the world would accept your complaint because it is your fault that you were getting drunk and making poor decision . 
  i 'm not saying the same standard should be applied to a sexual agreement , just showing other perspective . 
  i have n't said that you should not read both sides . 
  i just pointed were russians were caught red handed, 
   just look at what he 's done, 
  kgb was an agency for outside as well as inside security . 
  citizens often were detained by it for political reasons, 
  i do n't see significantly different pattern from other ussr [ countries ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:arm:aze:est:geo:kaz:ltu:rus:lva&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=667958400000&amp;tend=857347200000&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ), 
  let 's not be naive . 
  russia 's economy was and still is hugely dependent on natural resources .
