  definitely nekros , so many cool possibilities to alter his already unique design . 
  that was not deadpool ... it was not !, 
  stalker wishes he was as cool as judge dredd . 
  dmg is not everything , dmg application is just as important and tekko 's piss poor range really hinders it , even if you have max primed reach . 
  it can only hit 1 enemy at once as well , another massive flaw . 
  i know it 's just your opinion but dual ichor and prisma dual cleavers are widely considered to be the best crit melee weapons , if not for the shitty dual sword stances , they would be absolutely broken op . 
  ca n't wait to try it out . 
  too bad i was a dumbass and did n't stack fieldrons , now i have to torture myself with invasions/infestations just to get enough to craft it : /, 
  if aegon truly is `` a mummer 's dragon '' then he wo n't sit on the throne for long , that is if he can actually take it . 
  blackfyres are widely despised across the westeros , even if he successfully takes storm 's end , that does n't guarantee him support of storm lands . 
  but if an alliance between aegon and dorne can be made then tyrells should be really worried . 
  when it comes to melee , choosing valkyr is a no-brainer . 
  easy to farm and ridiculously strong . 
  valkyr + crit melee ( crit chance higher than 15 % ) is a favorite melee combination of many players . 
   is there a specific place to go within the clan/dojo or do i just spam chat with what i 'm looking for ? 
  you need to have a [ trading post ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/c/cc/trading_post.png/revision/latest?cb=20150119021515 ) in your dojo then invite ppl to your dojo and trade with them using it . 
  person you 're trading with can also invite you . 
  there 's also a relay on earh called maroo 's bazaar ( you need to open the node itself so you could access it , do earth missions around the node to open it ) , both players can go there to trade . 
   any way to check general prices before i purchase ? 
  there 's no way to check general prices in-game cuz wf does n't have an auction house but it 's a work in progress for the future , try warframe.market website for general prices . 
   is it worth using the material for doubling the mod slots on weapons/frames if it 's not a prime variant ? 
  if the weapon or a frame already has a primed variant , always go for a primed one , it 's superior . 
  other than that , you can choose to upgrade any weapon/frame you want using that catalyst/reactor . 
   and lastly , why is it so hard to find a matchmade team for the interception missions ??? 
  it 's not only interception , most nodes on solar map are more or less empty with an exception of a few highly efficient farming spots . 
  solar map will get a complete revamp with the next major update , u19 . 
  hmmm ? 
  i was convinced that he 's just a small part of the movie . 
  i thought they said that black panther will basically take spider-man 's role from the comics . 
  i still believe that double is above everyone in sheer skill but his decisionmaking is fucking atrocious , it always was . 
  in the past it was n't as obvious cuz his pure playmaking capabilities were overshadowing terrible teamplay and decisionmaking , now the gap in skill got smaller and double 's faults are way more obvious . 
  if you 're using eternal war valkyr build and you 're actually gon na be using broken war instead of hysteria , i 'd suggest [ this ] ( http://warframe-builder.com/melee_weapons/builder/broken_war/t_30_230000002_224-6-5-226-5-5-241-1-5-247-4-5-251-2-5-307-8-3-321-7-0-488-3-10-636-0-10_636-7-241-6-251-11-488-14-247-9-226-9-224-9-321-4-307-10/en/4-0-94 ) . 
  hysteria does a lot of dmg but it 's just not fun for me . 
  it 's only single target , primed reach is just too good and mauling mobs at point blank range is just not efficient . 
  eternal war warcry + high range crit melee like atterax with primed reach is just so much better imo . 
  if you 're on pc and have more questions , feel free to add me . 
  we might be exactly what you 're looking for . 
  [ check our recruitment post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/warframeclanrecruit/comments/44srv7/eupcclanvanguard_elite_is_recruiting_super_active/ ) . 
  he have quite a few german speaking players as well . 
  it 's been there since void caches got their own models instead looking like a grineer or corpus caches . 
  quality number crunching right here , now i kinda want you to add in dual raza and dual zoren there as well and compare all crit dual swords . 
  it says `` property of the grineer '' . 
  i do n't about you but i do n't wan na be anyone 's property xd, 
  in the book he went completely bald to hide his identity when he escaped with brienne . 
  he really liked that ring dude ... 
  i ca n't believe i loved laurel this episode , she made so much sense . 
  i want a figure of blight that glows in the dark . 
  homework comes first ? 
  ciphers son , i stopped hacking consoles manually long long time ago . 
  nah you 're probably just too poor to afford ciphers :p, 
  regular stalker does drop scimitar engines . 
  ... and a huge rat next to it, 
  victor garber is fantastic, 
  all kinds of weird shit happens with it . 
  it clips into your frame 's model , flaps around like it 's being possessed by devil , completely disappears from your back mid-mission etc. 
  an excalibur with a terrible fashion sense xd, 
  having massive doubts about this one , especially since we now know about this [ upcoming new justice league cartoon with weird art style ] ( http://www.ew.com/sites/default/files/1454095644/justice-league-poster.jpg ) . 
  just solo razorback in 6mins with ivara without triggering an alert at all . 
  this movie deserves every cent of it . 
  it 's mr6 , someone was probably trolling . 
  look who 's talking, 
  [ t3 non-cheese survival ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ujguxxz.jpg ) ( not a single ash prime systems . _ . ), 
  another noteworthy thing is that nikana prime looks like chinese jian but with a slightly curved blade . 
  i 'd be okay with the stats if spira prime was accurate and did n't have that weird spread like normal spira has . 
  shadow step makes this way too easy . 
  that bug existed for ages xd, 
  i wish i was there : c, 
  nikana prime is indeed a beauty . 
  can mods remove this post pls ? 
  do n't bring bullshit drama into subreddit , nobody here cares about this shit !, 
  cerata does the job just fine . 
  you 'll get 9 energy drain from qt self dmg . 
  melee stance does n't matter . 
  all you need is a correct amount of dmg and specific mods like power throw , quick return , whirlwind and fury . 
  that 's why i prefer 99 % bless trin for sortie defense . 
  just keep up 99 % and you can forget about defense target . 
  it still has that weird spread pattern but it 's not nearly as prominent as on regular spira . 
  get good at using daikyu and get spring-loaded broadhead mod for it . 
  it usually oneshots or leaves your opponents barely alive . 
  it 's hard to hit and charge time is ridiculous but i 've seen some ppl just annihilate everyone with it without dying themselves . 
  ppl refer to vaykor hek in trade chat like that . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/94d4284351847bd165f3adac4ec23487.png ) my mag draco focus farming setup . 
  4 cps are not needed as long as you have a rhino to buff you . 
  why rhino instead of other , more effective buffer like total eclipse mirage for example ? 
  mirage 's total eclipse buff only boosts physical dmg so it 's perfect for pure ips abilities like excal 's radial javelin but mag 's crush does magnetic dmg so the buff wo n't work . 
  max power strength day form equinox can also work as a buffer for you . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnxjbmvbwj0 ) is a video made by my good friend . 
  in this video you can see saryn as a dmg frame on draco , almost capping daily focus in 3 rounds with a booster . 
  imo saryn works best because her spores do n't have a fixed range , they have rippling effect and expand outwards reaching further than max range . 
  any void endless mission . 
  make sure to break open all containers , i get a lot of argon crystals from them . 
  i just want one on a weekend . 
  i constantly miss them by being at work or asleep ... 
  there 's this one corridor in the void that tanks my fps to a pitiful 15fps which is weird , considering that i have a solid 60fps almost all the time . 
  it 's like laurel switched places with felicity . 
  now i love her and hate felicity with her forced drama bullshit . 
  yep, 
  we do n't know quaithe 's motives . 
  we do n't know if she has dany 's best interests on her mind . 
  to me she 's melisandre 2.0 cuz we do n't know anything about her .
