  download a mod that fixes scaling . 
  dude clearly loves his job . 
  just finished ng + at lvl 64 . 
  got legendary mastercrafted ursine set , playing through hearts of stone to get that max lvl 70 . 
  start with the last wish and sword of destiny . 
  those are the most important imo . 
  if you like those , you should read the main witcher book saga as well cuz the games are unofficial sequels of that saga . 
  considering that you need to be at least lvl30 to play hearts of stone properly , i think it 's meant to be played after main quest unless you 're insanely overleveled or something . 
  continuity-wise it makes almost no difference . 
  you get only 1 extra dialogue line each for ciri and yen if you start hearts of stone and talk to them before finishing it . 
  you 're in for one hell of a ride . 
  the most intense part of the game begins with kaer morhen . 
  they 're even bringing back concept ursine armour !, 
  cdpr delivers once again < 3, 
  dlcs will automatically scale with ng + so you 'll be able to play them, 
  try ursine set with adrenaline/heavy attack build . 
  really fun . 
  i really liked frye twins , probably as much as i liked edward . 
  with syndicate they definitely tried to make amends for awful unity . 
  one thing worth mentioning . 
  during elven sage hideout quest when caranthir opens those ice portals and keira asks : `` what is this ?!, 
  '' , geralt responds by saying : `` the white frost !, 
  mage from the hunt summoned it ! '' . 
  does that mean that the wild hunt actually has some sort of control over the white frost ? 
  or maybe they can merely aim its destructive power at their foes ? 
  that 's the biggest mystery for me . 
  if you played and really liked black flag like me , you 're gon na be disappointed with unity . 
  you can still try it out , most bugs and glitches have been fixed but syndicate is so much better . 
  it 's fine , your geralt is just embracing his flamboyant side xd, 
  some insanely strong and smart century old higher vampire, 
  i 'm already at skellige so in those 2 weeks i should be able to finish the game to 100 % completion . 
  [ spoiler ] ( / s `` biggest waste of an interesting character together with all that dijkstra fiasco . 
  as much as i adore witcher franchise , i must admit that they really botched this `` save import '' feature . 
  lack of iorveth and saskia in witcher 3 was one of the biggest disappointments for me . '' ), 
  i have this too . 
  after b&w it 's gon na be even worse . 
  i just hope that mass effect andromeda will be successful . 
  it all depends on how cyberpunk 2077 turns out . 
  if it 's highly successful which is very likely , witcher sequel might be years and years away . 
  i 'm sure they 'll find new ways how to improve on this formula they developed with witcher 3 . 
  it 's smart business . 
  if cyberpunk 2077 does n't succeed ( which is unlikely imo ) , they can always go back and make another witcher game . 
  lvl35 for regular save , lvl70 for ng + i believe . 
  enemies will scale up as well , not just you . 
  they 'll be more durable and do more dmg . 
  play ng + and you 'll feel the massive difference . 
  still one of my favorite games of all time . 
  it 's been 5 year already , time flies . 
  in march 2016 it 's been reported that witcher 3 sold almost 10 million copies worldwide . 
  that 's half of the entire franchise sales . 
  [ funny because exactly the same thing happened to me as well ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j0o8uuo.png ) . 
  sapkowski described the games as `` expensive and elaborate fanfiction '' , he does n't recognize games to be a worthy medium to tell a great story and was pretty clear about it . 
  it gets more fun when you gather more cards and try out different decks , at start it 's pretty hard to get into . 
  oh man all this feel trip today , first agents of shield and now this ... 
  at the start of the season he was pretty fucking scary but along the way his character got butchered like everything else . 
  ** red baron : ** i too saved his wife . 
  like you said he was on the path of redemption and got so much character development that i thought it would be a waste to let him die like that , knowing that he utterly failed his family . 
  ** keira metz : ** i sent her to kaer morhen and let her keep alexander 's notes . 
  i liked her character a lot despite her being the stereotypical scheming sorceress . 
  yes she manipulated geralt into doing her bidding but she was there for him when it counted . 
  ** whoreson junior : ** no one hurts ciri and gets away with it , the book geralt would 've gutted him on the spot too . 
  ** king/queen of skellige : ** this one was really tough . 
  i ruled out hjalmar immediately because he 's prone to violence and does n't think before doing important decisions so cerys was a clear choice between the two so i chose her . 
  on my ng + playthrough i chose svanrige , i think his ending suits the most . 
  he was a really nice surprise for me and i thought he was only a boy under his mother 's heel . 
  too bad he did n't get much character development . 
  ** the war : ** i chose dijkstra ending . 
  i think he was one of the best characters of witcher 3 . 
  obviously i could n't allow radovid to live , he was a complete madman and i blame philippa for that . 
  she dominated and demeaned him all his life and radovid 's hate for mages comes from his hatred for philippa . 
  not to mention that philippa had a hand in radovid 's father 's assassination . 
  imo selling the rest of the northern kingdoms just to have independent temeria was selfish and stupid of roche and thaler . 
  and there was no guarantee that emhyr wo n't turn on them once he sorts out his mutiny problems . 
  you can never trust emhyr . 
  nilfgaardians are aggressors and i 'd never support them . 
  ** novigrad 's mages : ** i saved them but just because triss asked for my help , i see geralt as a person who would do anything to help his close friends . 
  ** the fate of ciri : ** witcher ciri was my choice . 
  she 's all about freedom and ability to make her own decisions , i just thought that the witcher 's path was most ideal for her . 
  watching her struggle to abandon everything she liked to embrace her lineage was too heartbreaking for me . 
  ** the fate of geralt : ** chose yen . 
  i 'm really fond of her since i read the books . 
  she 's an interesting and complex character and yes sometimes she can be a real bitch . 
  the dynamic between the two is also really good . 
  i like triss too but i could never recognize her as an important character , she was always there in the background doing nothing of importance , especially in witcher 3 . 
  i was left disappointed with her treatment in the last game . 
  she was abandoned in favor of yen . 
  we were even , i helped him earlier and i never considered him to be my friend , just an acquaintance . 
  i always went for iorveth path in witcher 2 . 
  try iorveth path in witcher 2 , completely different experience . 
  [ spoiler ] ( / s `` dandelion will be in b&w 100 % . 
  his voice actor was recording new lines , he said so on his twitter . '' ), 
  expansions with scale with ng + . 
  devs said that ng + blood & wine will go from lvl70 up to lvl100 . 
  plot armor lol, 
  yes , as far as i know it does n't matter if you give him the crystal . 
  it 's not really related . 
  they ca n't make it as big as novigrad for lore reasons . 
  novigrad is supposed to be one the largest cities in the north . 
  there 's no doubt that beauclair is supposed to look smaller . 
  depending from how high you jump .
