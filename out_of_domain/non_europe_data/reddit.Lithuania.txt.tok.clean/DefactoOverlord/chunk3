  i think that in the show mutiny will still happen and jon gets injured but survives . 
  i think that thorne will definitely be involved , maybe he 'll even save jon . 
  despite being a total douche , thorne upholds command and honor above all else . 
  i do n't see him betraying jon despite hating him . 
  [ the detail on both daario 's arakh and dagger is incredible ] ( http://c0.thejournal.ie/media/2014/04/got-props-630x472.jpg ), 
  well , by the time 4th book begins , sam is a lot slimmer than he used to be . 
  in the show it 's down to actor . 
  what irks me is that in the books he categorically refused to burn ppl alive on his way to winterfell . 
  in the show he burns his only living heir , putting house baratheon on a verge of extinction . 
  when jorah saw the smashed faces of those stone harpy statues , it reminded him of his greyscale cuz he checks his arm after he looks at them . 
  at least that 's what i think . 
  the show introduced me into the world of got . 
  i watched first season of the show before deciding to read the books , finished adwd recently . 
  i suggest starting with books , it 'll give you lots of context that the show skips . 
  physically weak . 
  look at his appearance before and after , you can see that he aged like 10 years in couple of weeks . 
  warden of the north ? 
  maybe . 
  king in the north ? 
  no , never . 
  stannis would never allow it and jon would be just another usurper in his eyes . 
  only a handful of ppl knew that robb legitimized jon and almost all of them died in the red wedding . 
  i do n't think that will happen . 
  it 's not as rare as you think . 
  deal with it . 
  it 's omega size kubrow , the largest one you can have . 
  ah yeah , an occasional russian douchebag . 
  sometimes i 'm ashamed of being russian, 
  oh i know , dota is famous for retarded russian players . 
  davos for sure . 
  he 's the beacon of honor , trustworthiness and loyalty . 
  probably the only one left at this point . 
  and he got what was coming to him , got murdered in insanely brutal fashion . 
  i 'll be honest with you . 
  no fucking clue . 
  russians are arrogant ppl , most of them do n't even come into contact with foreigners cuz russian gaming community is absolutely massive so they rarely play with non-russian players . 
  that 's why majority of them do n't even learn to speak in english . 
  only some of them . 
  dany , cersei and jon end up like in the books . 
  tyrion 's storyline passed the books . 
  jaime 's , sansa 's , brienne 's storylines are completely different from the books . 
  aria 's storyline is a bit different but she also ends up blind in the last book . 
  sansa 's storyline was merged with the different character . 
  remember what stannis said to davos last episode . 
  there 's only one way for him and that 's forward otherwise he 'll be known as the king who ran . 
  if he would 've retreated , his battle for the throne would be over either way . 
  i 'm pretty sure that jorah is super jelly . 
  he was categorically against dany banging daario in the first place . 
  i would n't be surprised if jorah tries to kill him or infect him with greyscale or something . 
  maybe daario is the traitor , who knows . 
  he 'll have to wait for season 6 to find out . 
  definitely a nice improvement over original . 
  too bad that grakata sounds like shit now , i liked the old firing sound way more , it just sounded like it hard more punch . 
  now it sounds even worse than soma . 
  if you manage to be online during streaming times then yeah but we 're not doing them daily . 
  proto skin is not overpriced , prisma skin is . 
  visit the stream when we 're on before deciding . 
  we mostly do 2h + survivals these days cuz we 're a bit burnt out while waiting for u17 . 
  cersei appointed idiots to joffrey 's / tommen 's kingsguard . 
  she values blind loyality way more than actual swordsmanship skills . 
  in the show selmy was the last good kingsguard . 
  in the books only balon swan can actually live up to kingsguard expectations . 
  in one of jaime 's pov chapters he says that current kingsguard is a bunch of useless twats . 
  that was a big fuck up from mutineers . 
  alliance between jon and tormund kept wildlings in check . 
  what 's keeping tormund from slaughtering all crows at castle black now ? 
  we got some justice this season . 
  jon lobbed off slynt 's head , meryn trant got murdered in a quite horrific fashion , myranda got splattered and cersei got brutally humiliated . 
  this season was not that bad . 
  how dual ichor are compared to dual cleavers ? 
  i always used them instead of cleavers . 
  host migration while being 2h30min into t4surv . 
  playing with that host almost every day , never had any troubles . 
  u16 .5 hits , random host migration . 
  lost everything . 
  could n't stop swearing ... 
  [ this is what i use ] ( http://warframe-builder.com/warframes/builder/excalibur/t_30_300420003_2-3-10-4-7-5-5-1-5-6-5-5-19-2-10-34-8-5-411-4-10-481-0-10-524-6-3_481-7-5-9-19-14-2-6-411-8-6-11-524-9-4-9-34-14_15/en/1-0-5/62204/ ) . 
  i concentrate everything on finishers cause i like to run 2h + survivals and i need all the dmg i can get . 
  [ paired with a right weapon you can get some sexy dmg ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xbdvtky.jpg ) . 
  [ i use prisma skana specifically modded around channeled finishers ] ( http://warframe-builder.com/melee_weapons/builder/prisma_skana/t_30_000000002_230-2-3-235-1-3-236-3-5-240-6-3-241-4-5-247-0-5-254-5-5-307-8-3-368-7-3_247-9-235-5-230-7-236-11-241-11-254-11-240-7-368-7-307-10/en/4-0-81/62206/ ), 
  i almost never use slash dash unless i need to dash into nullifier bubble . 
  i usually spam radial blind and do channeled finishers . 
  radial blind also increases the dmg of exalted blade 's energy waves . 
  if i 'm low i pop large energy restore , i have almost 1k stacked up . 
  the old bear was a badass just as i pictured him in my head when reading the books . 
  that asshole raven keeps following jon , repeating his name over and over again throughout affc and adwd xd it 's kinda hard to replicate that in real life . 
  [ this ] ( http://warframe-builder.com/warframes/builder/mirage/t_30_402422003_1-0-10-6-6-5-12-4-10-13-1-3-34-8-5-49-3-10-397-7-3-411-5-10-479-2-10_1-7-13-13-479-7-49-8-12-8-411-8-6-11-397-9-34-14_0/en/1-0-26/46782/ ) is what i use . 
  even with max blind rage both hall of mirrors and eclipse will cost only 39 energy so you do n't need any efficiency whatsoever . 
  just slap on as much power strength and duration as possible . 
  phoenix intercept escalation that was last february gave stratos emblem but it was n't supposed to so there are 14 emblems in total but only 13 tac alerts . 
  wf is not in your typical beta , it 's in perpetual beta . 
  that means that developers can change core mechanics of the game anytime . 
  that 's why it 's `` beta '' game but it 's a finished product . 
  at least that guy was frost , happened to me when i was nekros with unranked gear xd it 's bound to happen in any playerbase . 
  warframe 's playerbase in general is very nice compared to some . 
  cuz with the right build and weapon you can do [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xbdvtky.jpg ) . 
  that allows me to do super endgame stuff like 2h endless missions and still oneshot mobs . 
  i agree it might be annoying and pointless if you 're forced to do finishers on lvl20 enemies or something , it 's counterproductive and redundant when you can spray the waves of enemies with your soma prime or boltor prime or whatever flavor of the month weapon is . 
  it 's situational , de made exalted blade 's attacks ranged for a reason , the waves also get blind multiplier so just whack away from range if you do n't wan na do finishers . 
  3,2 k steam hours , 2,2 k in-mission hours here .
