  looks like something from mass effect and i 'm ok with that . 
  i hope that these batman : arkham resurgence rumors are true . 
  wb montreal can fix what rocksteady messed up with arkham knight . 
  to be fair dc made wally into a black guy for no reason in the comics first . 
  when fans got mad and demanded original wally to return . 
  they did return him as alternate reality character with rebirth storyline . 
  now we have 2 wally wests at the same time . 
  this diversity business is disgusting . 
  they made cyborg into a founding member of justice league just to have a token black guy in the team . 
  i 've seen ppl who started criticising the show since season2 because showrunners did n't adapt danny 's house of the undying visions word for word . 
  i kinda feel like the entire robert 's rebellion plotline is a big homage to trojan war . 
  maybe it was martin 's inspiration . 
  witcher 1 takes place 5 years after the events of the last book , lady of the lake and yes , it spoils the ending of the book saga and a lot of other stuff . 
  if you beat witcher 3 , i do n't think there 's anything you do n't already know . 
  o'dimm is the devil incarnate . 
  as ancient as the world itself , he even speaks ancient elvish at the end , language from a time when elves were the dominant race in the world . 
  [ praise the power of modding community ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oylsgl1.jpg ) but yeah . 
  it is indeed strange that they removed best looking swords in the game . 
  [ these ones are also not in the game ] ( https://images2.alphacoders.com/600/thumb-1920-600255.jpg ) . 
  i just ca n't force myself to use aerondight , good looking sword but it constantly clips through the scabbard and drives me nuts . 
  would n't be a nightwing related thread without at least 1 person mentioning dick ' ass cheeks . 
  i love it . 
  i 'm really curious what they 're gon na do with dwarves and halflings in the show . 
  it 's very expensive to make them look realistic . 
  most notably , yarpen and zoltan have quite a bit of dialogue in the books . 
  that 's also a good option . 
  i guess it all depends on their budget . 
  you can keep playing afterwards . 
  after the ending you get transported to back to kaer morhen and you can roam anywhere you want , do unfinished side quests , do dlcs , farm money for ng + etc. 
  when you start ng + , you will keep all potions , decoctions , bombs , and armor/weapons along with alchemy ingredients . 
  you will lose glyph recipes , quest items ( obviously ) , and books , notes , and bestiary entries , and trophies . 
  you also keep every item you have stashed in your chest . 
  wow his [ euron ] ( https://orig06.deviantart.net/201c/f/2017/212/5/5/episode03_by_ertacaltinoz-dbibovi.jpg ) looks absolutely terrifying , i love it !, 
  jaime at his prime vs undead mountain . 
  we saw jaime fight only twice when he still had his hand and he was just toying with ned . 
  we did n't see how he carved up multiple northmen while trying to reach robb during the battle of whispering wood . 
  that would 've been epic . 
  eskel and the lil bleater . 
  i think it 's just a homage to the books . 
  in the books , he has it tucked away in his bed roll , carried by roach . 
  silver swords are incredibly expensive and he only uses it when it 's 100 % necessary . 
  on multiple occasions he fights magical beings using his meteorite steel sword . 
  watch witcher 1 recap on youtube . 
  you got ta know what happened , otherwise the beginning of witcher 2 will be confusing as hell . 
  there 's a lore reason for that . 
  geralt is really poor , regardless of how much gold you have . 
  that being said , i would 've liked more gear customization . 
  simply put , you can only incapacitate a higher vampire . 
  you ca n't permanently kill him . 
  get b&w asap , it 's an amazing experience . 
  if you count both expansions , you 're not even at 40 % of the game . 
  welcome to geralt 's life . 
  dude 's poor as fk . 
  i think , geralt has way too much fun cracking puns in this game lol . 
  just finished a quest that contained my favorite one . 
  `` hand over the documents , thief '', 
  a thief ? 
  i won 'em straight , i did , in a game of cards '', 
  `` not how muggs sees it . 
  claims he was ... mugged ... '', 
  wow , puts him right up there with luthor and his theft of 40 cakes . 
  i think you 're the first person i 've seen who lists game length as a negative in witcher 3 . 
  is it radioactive ? 
  we do n't know when it will be released . 
  late 2019 would be more likely . 
  it 's very early into production , still writing the script . 
  likely that casting will start once they 're done with it . 
  it 's possible to take them down if you run euphoria perk with alchemy build . 
  can you burn them to death with super high intensity igni , buffed by max toxicity and petri 's philter . 
  i do n't know another way since they will onehit you no matter what if your level is a lot lower than theirs . 
  sword is arguably the most efficient weapon for witchers , they need to be agile in combat and have good reach . 
  taking even a single hit from a monster can lead to death so they rely on speed and enhanced reflexes . 
  it 's one of the reasons why they do n't go all out on armor either . 
  as evident in byways village quest in velen , some monsters like katakans can bite and cleave straight through full plate armor . 
  this is my interpretation . 
  emhyr 's rule is a very fragile one . 
  he came into power after dethroning an usurper who murdered his father . 
  a significant part of nobles loathe him and constantly plot against him so instead of killing them all and making even more enemies within the empire , emhyr gave them a common enemy to fight , which happens to be northern realms . 
  as long as nilfgaard is waging war and winning , no one dares to challenge emhyr 's rule . 
  this massive feeling of contempt towards northern realms must n't be ignored either . 
  i think it 's the main reason , that explains nilfgaardian savagery . 
  it only grew after the humiliation they suffered after the battle of sodden hill . 
  this `` we must culture these barbaric nordlings '' saying is a bunch of pr bullshit . 
  but beric ... lost his priest t_t, 
  alchemy build with euphoria is arguably the strongest in the game . 
  at max toxicity you can do insane dmg , especially if you 're using manticore armor since you can down 2 decoctions at once due to higher max toxicity bonus that armor provides . 
  i use [ this ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/1841/ ? ), 
  mod to add [ this ] ( https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/952/images/1841-1-1469324360.jpg ) promo art sword into the game . 
  [ i think it 's the best looking steel sword you can possibly have ] ( https://www.hdwallpapers.in/walls/the_witcher_3_wild_hunt_geralt_trophies-wide.jpg ) . 
  [ winter 's blade ] ( https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/258210114355355099/18ee4070a764d3e7de84be0974c67735726b94c5/?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;output-format=jpeg&amp;output-quality=95&amp;fit=inside | 637:358 & composite-to % 3d % 2a % 2c % 2a % 7c637 % 3a358 & background-color = black ) you get for helping crach an craite is prolly the best looking steel sword if modding is not an option . 
  if you 're in just for the gameplay , you 'll struggle to like it . 
  it 's the weakest part of witcher 3 while story , characters and immersion are top notch . 
  you need to use script merger to merge ghost mode with this appearance mod if you want both to work correctly . 
  it 's a real hassle . 
  yeah , merging is not enough . 
  you need to merge specific command lines in both . xml files that script merger ca n't do automatically . 
  it might take a long time and it 's confusing if you 've never done it before . 
  look up other mods that change appearance . 
  some might still work with ghost mode . 
  these big overhaul mods like ghost mode are a pain in the ass , they break a huge variety of mods so i refuse to use them for this reason .
