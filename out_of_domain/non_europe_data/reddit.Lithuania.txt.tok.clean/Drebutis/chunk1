it did , most games were long af , because nobody knew how to close out game . 
  zz port became meta . 
  i just wish eu goes back to it 's roots - double tps . 
  sums up teams that are on the losing side of euw games . 
  european history pretty much sums it up - competition and nationalism . 
  it has nothing to do with the game itself . 
  japan and uk should swap places , since both of them do n't want to have anything with `` continentals '' . 
  hmm we have similar word in lithuanian language - `` pagaliau '' so i can relate to what you mean . 
  freeza be like - `` kurwa '' . 
  prussia-lithuania , oh boy , that could have been awesome and far more powerful than plc was . 
  if you want a historical fact , when [ german empire held lithuania ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruetmrjbkwi#t=25s ) in ww1 they tried to incorporate it into german empire as they had big grievance for being excluded from baltic region since fall of livonian and teutonic orders . 
  they wanted to make actual personal union with prussia , but it was opposed by k. of saxony and k. of bavaria because just like lithuania they were catholic and [ saxony already had ties with lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/augustus_ii_the_strong ) so prussia other than holding lithuania minor did n't really had any ties with us . 
  towards end of the great war , [ kingdom of lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_lithuania_ ( 1918 \\ ) ) was born with german prince on the throne , but did n't last for long as democratic republic was far more promoted , not only finally fully independent , but also does n't stir with rest of the world , especially allies who did n't want any one to ally themselves with germany . 
  just denmark thb .

  [ mmmm , no ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/the-tallest-and-shortest-countries-in-the-world/ ) ? 
  not like it matters . 
  still most of swedes are smaller than luxembourgers . 
  well i 'm something around that too and i 'm 21 y/o apache helicopter , plus i 'm hairy af , i feel like polar cub . 
  that 's why it 's measured in average , how else will find country with tallest people ?

  because people do n't even know that they exist . 
  not reaching finals , great insult mate . 
  when america has more nationalism than europe you know something is wrong . 
  under the under , the underrated comment here, 
  whole america is just pile of different nations . 
  well he did used that `` insult '' after / u/grzechooo noted that na have n't made past group stages for ages . 
  lissandra will be pleased . 
  kosovo and albania as one country , i see you want serbians to be triggered . 
   but g2 ... 
  lets hope they will get their shiit together until the next event . 
  they did n't play that bad , they just did what h2k were doing , chocking when it matters most . 
  unfortunately only h2k learned from their mistakes . 
  i was actually surprised by splyce , but also did n't disappointed after they lost to tsm , p/b was terrible for them and it was already obvious that they just lack exp in it , if they get favourable team comp , they sure can push for lead . 
  it 's like comparing ww1 to ww2 , dude what ? 
  na already importing shit load of eu and kr players . 
  i mean , we - eu have talent pool , but we suck dicks when it comes to team management compare to korea , it 's quite sad how much potential we 're missing . 
  i 'm pretty sure most mods are american . 
  since i 'm educated european who knows population difference between canada and usa . 
  na has n't been past group stages for ages . 
  berlin wall fell because of him !, 
  not really , no memelland and no southern east prussia . 
  na political map skills . 
  true painters are from europe . 
  funnily enough s1 was best performance na ever had , but then again , they could n't even win in phreaks basement , lolololol . 
  russian biased map . 
  they win , when you do n't want them to win . 
  for lithuania , no , basketball is far bigger here than football . 
  well you know after thousand of years of killing each other we finally started to love each other . 
  in mid 30 's lithuanian-american basketball couches would come to lithuania , i do n't know , we just naturally became good at it . 
  won 1st place in men 's european basketball championship 37 's and 39 's ( [ poor finns , did n't even stood a chance ] ( http://prntscr.com/ctvgwm\\ ) ) also took 2nd place in first women 's basketball championship 39 's , right before invasion and illegal occupation by ussr for next 50 years . 
  even under soviet occupation most players of soviet union were from lithuania likes of : [ stepas butautas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stepas_butautas ) , [ vytautas kulakauskas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vytautas_kulakauskas ) , [ justinas lagunavi\u010dius ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/justinas_lagunavi\u010dius ) and [ kazimieras petkevi\u010dius ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kazimieras_petkevi\u010dius ) . 
  fun fact , i do n't remember when and where , but once when ussr won gold ( ? ), 
  medals and caster said `` let 's congratulate our new russian champions '' all lithuanians refused to come and instead went back to locker room . 
  [ essentially basketball was one of the key things that showed our hopes of gaining independence again ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vleyzy_had8 ) . 
  also after re-establishment of independent state we looked at moscow as greatest rivals . 
  edit : basketball is just our way to expose our nationalism . 
  yeah nobody likes poles or russians . 
  those pesky slavs !, 
  edit : mad slavs not being able to take a joke . 
  sad . 
  please yes , all the memories of cs : s coming back . 
  that part was so well executed . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fxhf7to.jpg ) is pretty much how europeans felt after seeing americans booing ssg . 
  forgot your pills ? 
  qq more . 
  good for you being boring person . 
  i 'm not offended , you 're offended . 
  crying over me calling slavs shit . 
  when it comes to our foreign diplomats you very well can trust them .

  j\u00f3zef pi\u0142sudski was dead for 4 years when invasion began . 
  it is in polish not lithuanian . 
  you can spot it with ** klaip\u0117da ** not having '' ** \u0117 ** '' , '' ** i ** '' being '' ** j ** '' and '' ** l ** '' being polish '' ** \u0142 ** '' . 
  and he did the most sane thing . 
  the soundtrack represent gameplay of all yasuo 's . 
  i done because of faith . 
  what is that white thing pouring out of your mouth , is that ... salt ? 
  same , when i put it on highest 1080p the screen just starts to twitch . 
  borderlands = / = your work place, 
   that 's why people who indulge in video games are gamers , not readers . 
  so naive mate . 
   league 's lore about to reach a new low . 
  like how ? 
  character will have quote like `` let 's go together over butterfly fields ! '' . 
  who the hell cares ? 
   has mickiewicz something to do with this ? 
  he 's very unimportant to us .

  fyfy .
