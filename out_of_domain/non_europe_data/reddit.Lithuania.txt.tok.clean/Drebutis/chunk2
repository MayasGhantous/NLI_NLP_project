  balt ( lithuanians , latvians ) is ethnic group , baltic is geographical one . 
  not what i was expecting . 
   probably the ~ ~ support ~ ~ marskman player in this case . 
  ironically ~ 100 years earlier old prussian ( baltic ) language completely died out . 
  even in phreaks basement they could n't win, 
  turkey is not in europe . 
  there are 12th classes 1 for each year . 
  in lithuania ( north eastern europe ) there are 4 years of gymnasium 8-12th , 3rd is 11th year of gymnasium . 
  gymnasium is just higher tier high school to prepare you for university . 
   which prepares you for direct employment or for a specialized college program . 
  gymnasium = / = `` tech '' schools . 
  can confirm , same here in lithuania . 
  yeah please expand . 
  i 'd like you to prove that turkey is european country . 
  either way in polish-lithuanian commonwealth our borders were already cut the half . 
  plus not really a loss when we intentionally [ refused to re-create gdl ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pvwquor.png ) borders . 
  we wanted a state with ethnographic regions and as much homogeneous lithuanian state as possible , but it was impossible , given the fact that western lithuania was heavily germanized and eastern part was heavily polonized . 
   geographically speaking , turkey is in europe, 
  yeah , [ no ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/europe_orthographic_caucasus_urals_boundary_%28with_borders%29.svg/537px-europe_orthographic_caucasus_urals_boundary_%28with_borders%29.svg.png ) . 
  only very tiny part of it is , and if that makes turkey eligible for being european country , might as well call kazakhstan a european country . 
   politically speaking, 
  because turkey since day 1 ( end of ww1 ) knew middle east is going to be sh * t fest , ataturk tried to make turkey as european as pissble and align with european nations , that still does n't make turkey a european nation . 
  cyprus is part of european union , that does n't make them european nation , they 're just heavily influenced by it . 
   they even got the fucking `` european capital of culture '' award in 2010 . 
  how the hell are they not in europe again ? 
  because they 're not part of europe . 
  just because you associate yourself with european nations , does n't make you one . 
   both kazakhstan and turkey are european countries . 
  what the hell is wrong with you ? 
  i 'm done , you 're beyond saving . 
   if your land is in europe, 
  people who live in that part are european , but that does n't make whole nation european . 
   what 's your criteria of being european ? 
  either major part of country is in europe geographically or major part of population is in it , which unlike russia , turkey and kazakhstan have neither . 
  unlike most of europe , turkey and kazakhstan are not [ christian ] ( https://churchpop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/traditional-religions.png ) , [ they ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkic_peoples#/media/file:map-turkiclanguages.png ) do n't speak indo-european language , their culture differs immensely , even mexico is closer to europe than turkey , hell mexico has free visa pass , while turkey does n't . 
  mexico has higher chance of becoming member of european union than turkey atm . 
  even today turkey goes further from europe with erdogan . 
  simply put european is a person who lives on european continent , fallows judeo-christianity morals and has greco-roman intellect and is ethnically european - white caucasian . 
  this pic cracked me up so hard . 
  monday here i come . 
  old prussians were n't kicked out , they assimilated to either lithuanians , germans or even poles . 
  those zileans and ziggs screaming `` allahu akbar '' every game annoys me . 
  they anus cuz they ate us ? 
  sjokz  korean girls, 
  americans dig asian chicks , we europeans dig our chicks . 
  relevant flair . 
  guess you have a fetish . 
  you did .

  yes they can . 
  american redditors out number rest , that 's the reason .

  * wtf 2 trashtalk threads ?!, 
   introducing the idea of the stab in the back myth, 
  that also was very popular among lithuanians , since jews were most supportive of ussr occupation of lithuania . 
  because of it ~ 95 % of pre-war lithuanian jews have died . 
   the catholics , poles and socialists inside germany . 
  phew . 
  at least we 're in semis , while na barely can climb out of group stage . 
  can confirm , fascism for some reason produce coolest flags , lithuanian fascist [ flag ] ( https://i.imgur.com/f9cgdst.png ) . 
  unfortunately you had neither this year . 
  pretty sure he uses f keys to jump around his team mate perspective . 
  what do you expect from tsm fan ? 
  salt and trying to sh * t on eu . 
  what stoppped clg from advancing ? 
  by your logic aln deserves to go to finals/semifinals because they took game from rox . 
  good try , buddy , wo n't work , now go to sleep . 
  just re-arrange your keys in-game , some pro players make their primary keys e.g. 
  qwer as uiop so they could have more room and easier time reaching other keys for other purpose . 
  interesting . 
  they re-arrange them to other keys . 
  mouse buttons ? 
  look on top left corner . 
  feels like it is painted on empires state of religion . 
  since catholicism and latin script was banned in lithuania at that time since the [ january uprising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_uprising ) . 
  then this map is retarded af . 
   russia and interfere with states that were historically part of its sphere of influence . 
  russia has been part of polish-lithuanian sphere of influence , does that mean russia should obey us ? 
  man this delusional and dumb thinking . 
  prussian flag gives me hard on , maybe because i have [ lietuvininkai ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussian_lithuanians ) blood . 
  kill them all !, 
  but , we 're yours . 
  potato dumplings with meat inside of it . 
  here 's explanation . 
   our right accuse lithuania for discrimination of polish minority, 
  total lies , we homogay with your minority . 
  sweden taught us .
