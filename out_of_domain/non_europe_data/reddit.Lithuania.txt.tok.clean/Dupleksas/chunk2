  you can manually copy that game files or you can use steam backup function . 
  this text is from steam info , so if you cant get same mobile phone number from your operator , only steam support could help you :, 
  ** help , i lost ( or sold ) my phone and ca n't log in !, 
  what do i do ? 
  if possible , you should contact your wireless service provider and get a replacement phone with the same phone number . 
  steam will be able to send sms messages to your replacement phone , and you will be able to recover your account as described below . 
  if you no longer have access to your phone and do n't have your recovery code , you 'll need the assistance of steam support . 
  use the `` contact steam support '' button at the top right of this page to get help removing your authenticator . 
  if you do n't have access to the email address that is currently associated with your steam account please provide proof of account ownership within your ticket . 
  you could check project reality mod for battlefield 2, 
  maybe they will do something like ea is doing with origin access . 
  you pay some fee and get access for some package of games . 
  well that is steam cloud purpose to have games saves backup , however personally i never tried to restore game data after reformating my system . 
  on my notebook , when i press power button ( hardware button ) it shutdowns skipping updates . 
  ( windows 8.1 ), 
  are you using beta steam client ? 
  it 's just a feature request with edited image . 
  it does n't exist . 
  if file is configuration file and is created after first game launch , i do n't think validation will restore it . 
  i 'm not sure if banning by phone number will work . 
  operators recycle numbers after some time of unuse . 
  there is chance , that someone may get new number already flagged by valve . 
  so , i if understood correctly , phone number itself wo n't be flagged , but it would be used just to find all user accounts at the time ban issued , right ? 
  cheaters probably will use prepaid cards , which is easy to buy probably in every shop and can be easily thrown away . 
  yes , you can move numbers easily , but do n't forget , that new users appear . 
  when people buy first phone , they get new number . 
  looks like oneplus three ... 
  maybe check fuel filter ( probably you already checked that , but still ) . 
  i had probably similiar problems ( different car ) , when sometimes it was difficult to start car . 
  it seems problem disappeared after fuel filter change . 
  are you sure ? 
  as far as i know , higher frequency waves have lower penetration through solid objects than lower frequence . 
  but 5ghz frequency may help , because it has less radio pollution from other devices . 
  hey , its me , a person who wants free card . 
  game looks fun . 
  i 'll keep an eye on it . 
  when i had this problem , restarting steam helped for me . 
  you reached highest ascend level , your desktop turned into cat . 
  btw , table looks good . 
  i do n't how it works , but maybe reporting him will help . 
  you need to check in bios , if there is no option to disable integrated gpu , then you probably out of luck . 
  have you tried to do the same with other computers ? 
  maybe its the problem with your network equipment , because i have do n't any problems with that . 
  do you have any way to test that with some other internet connection ? 
  also , do you use router ? 
  if you have , maybe try to connect directly . 
  question out off curiosity , do games usually correctly get azerty layout , or do you need manually assign keys , for ex . 
  zqsd , instead of wasd ? 
  i do n't know if it is the same on linux , but it is possible , that renderer_settings . xml ( or something like that ) file is missing . 
  ( at least on windows , game quits silently with missing config file ), 
  it should be in game video settings . 
   supertux, 
  i think , you are talking about pingus , supertux is mario clone . 
  well i added it for legacy purposes . 
  it will be used in small museum so who knows , maybe it will be used . 
  i was given some guides , so i tried to follow them closely . 
  it will be used in small museum . 
  it purposes will be `` exhibit digitization '' , i do n't exactly what it means , because i 'm new there . 
  i think it will be used for photos editing and some small video editing and to use some specific software , which i have n't seen yet . 
  i was thinking about prebuilt too , because this looks like computer from next century compared to current computers . 
  i just followed recommended guides , which are given to museums . 
  these things come to my head :, 
  - maybe driver or some os service crashed for some reason ;, 
  - maybe your card overheated for some reason ;, 
  - or worst case scenario ... not much left for your card . 
  did you checked gpu temperature too ? 
  i am using lte and delay is always lower than 100ms ( for servers located in europe ) . 
  however delay depends a lot on network load , sometimes to same server is around 70-80ms , but on late hours it is 40-50ms . 
  edit :, 
  if i am testing via speedtest to closest server , i get as low as 19ms . 
  i noticed that , in my case , lte creates around 20-30ms overhead on average . 
  i have problems logging to origin . 
  i cant logging on both origin client and web page . 
  on client it shows `` online login is currently unavailable '' . 
  i had this problem sometime before , but it fixed somehow itself . 
  i tried to login through origin website , and i ca n't login too . 
  origin store itself seem to work , but when i press login , it tries to load until i get `` secure connection failed '' . 
  anyone has any ideas how to fix that ? 
  edit :, 
  my origin stated to work itself , without doing anything .

  ** what is your intended use for this build ? 
  the more details the better . 
  i need to build pc for my work . 
  i have some basic requirements for pc . 
  that would be 4 cores cpu , dvi , vga , hdmi connectors , 8 usb ports . 
  so far i made a draft for it . 
  can anyone review current parts and tell if there is any compatibility problems . 
  i have n't chose case yet , maybe someone can suggest not expensive , simple case with 2 front usb3 connectors and maybe with card reader . 
  ssd is at the moment as suggestion , not decided yet if it will be in the end , it will depend on budget . 
  edit, 
  i think mainly this pc will be used for office work , digitizing and editing photos , maybe for some light video editing . 
  ** what is your budget ( ballpark is okay ) ? 
  do n't know yet .
