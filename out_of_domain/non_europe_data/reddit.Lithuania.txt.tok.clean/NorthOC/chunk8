  update : damn , all of you have interesting goals  i wish you all luck for achieving them . 
  i hope you get over your depression . 
  i just found this subreddit and already want to start this but first i got a question i did n't find an answer to . 
  if i have a wet dream ( if this is somehow happens ) , do i have to reset my badge ? 
  i 'm 17 from europe . 
  been wankin and watching porn since 9-10 years . 
  i consider myself shy , i ca n't confidently talk to girls that i 'm attracted ( is this word correct ? ), 
  to so i think it 's time for a change . 
  i 've started working out , been going at it for 3 months ( since 1st march , 5 times a week ) , but i feel that it is not enough to boost my confidence . 
  i 'm going to start my hard mode 1 year journey from tommorow when i wake up . 
  i 'll do updates once a week ( if that 's fine ) . 
  wish me luck fellow fapstronauts/femstronauts !, 
  i 'm getting the urge constantly when i 'm at home . 
  trying to keep my mind off it with excercise . 
  i 'm just sitting here , listening to bulgarian folk songs . 
  i do n't even live close to bulgaria !, 
  like what the f * ck !, 
  before starting this , i used to fap everyday in the morning . 
  is it possible that this routine is affecting me ? 
  i have never been depressed or anything . 
  this started about a week ago . 
  everytime i wake up , for a few hours i feel tired even though i get about 8-9 hours of sleep . 
  story time !, 
  last friday , i went to a friends party . 
  when we arrived there i met this girl ( you know where this is going ) . at first we did n't think much of each other but later with some light drinking involved , we hit it off . 
  it was really easy to talk to her and i was n't nervous at all !, 
  we started holding hands and later there was a lot of cuddling involved and finally a kiss !, 
  now we 've been meeting everyday and everything is working out perfectly !, 
  we really like each other . 
  what has nofap to do with this ? 
  even though it 's only been a month of my one year journey , i feel like as a tool , it has helped me a lot already . 
  if we went to a party one month ago , i would n't have been able to pull a simple conversation with her or any girl there . 
  thank you for those who have posted encouraging things on this subreddit . 
  i feel like you also have helped me a lot !, 
  sorry if i made mistakes while writting this , english is not my first language . 
  and lastly if any of my friends decide to check my history and read this , i 'm sorry that i made you jelous . 
  now you know my secret . 
  about a week ago , i went to a friends ( lets call him e ) party with the whole squad ( e is also in the squad ) . 
  there i made 3 friends ( 1 dude 2 girls ) . 
  now , everyday , me and e hang out with these 2 girls . 
  it has been good . 
  now onto the rant . 
  when we hang out , i rarely have time for the old squad . 
  but that is actually a good thing . 
  why ? 
  because i want to change my friend circle . 
  the old squad , which consisted of 4 dudes , is anti - girlfriend . 
  we got e , who already quietly left the squad for a new , better friend circle , then we got this guy who is afraid to talk to girls , and we got a friend there who talks about his everyday video game experiences . 
  those 2 guys have n't changed a bit in 3 years . 
  i on the other hand , have changed a lot . 
  i sorted out my problems , became more confident , started working out ... 
  the problem right now is that if i decide to move on , i 'll loose two close people , whom i 've known for a long time . 
  and if i do n't move on i 'll miss a great opportunity to make more friends and have relationships . 
  should i say fuck it and take this opportunity ? 
  can someone please post it here ? 
  it starts with a guitar riff going back and forth on the same string . 
  then the first words you hear are : na nana nana nana na nana . 
  and i think then they say batman !, 
  ( sounds like it ) and repeats the same thing for a second time . 
  i have n't made a 90 day report since i was busy so i 'm making it now . 
  **** mini backround ****, 
  17 year old . 
  used to be insecure . 
  spend a lot of time playing video games with friends . 
  have n't had much luck with girls in the last few years and was really shy while speaking to them . 
  decided to change . 
  started working out and wanted to be more confident . 
  found nofap by accident . 
  set 2 milestones :, 
  1 . reach one year of nofap on hard mode . 
  after one year i will continue doing nofap , but i 'll allow myself to get off if a girl does it . 
  **** day 30-117 ****, 
  20-30 days were one of the best in my life . 
  brain fog was gone . 
  i was super confident , energetic and active . 
  had some fun with a girl ( cuddling , kissing , etc. ) . 
  after that my ` superpowers ' started to fade . 
  i really liked the boost and even considered relapsing so i could have them again but decided not to because i was curious of what lies ahead . 
  i finally hit day 50 . 
  damn time flies fast when you have summer vacation . 
  i met a lot of new people by day 50 and made new friends . 
  i was confident , i started caring less about what i was saying and noticed that the superpowers that i had from day 20 to 30 were n't gone . 
  they just became a part of me . 
  day 90 arrives . 
  i spend little to no time on the pc . 
  started to learn playing the guitar . 
  me trying to learn an instrument ? 
  that would have never happened if it was n't for this sub . 
  day 98-117 . 
  school starts . 
  the first week i was a bit shy and di n't want to talk much in class because all of our teachers changed and the whole class but after that i was good . 
  now , if know the answer i 'll always speak up and not wait for someone else to say it . 
  now i always confidently say hi to the girls in my new class if i meet them while walking to school . 
  it 's really easy to talk to all of them and i do n't feel anxious anymore . 
  time is going slow right now . 
  started reading english literature ( i 'm from europe ) . 
  **** conclusion ****, 
  your life really changes after you start nofaping . 
  thanks to this sub and the community , for helping in rough times . 
  i 'll continue to improve and work on myself .
