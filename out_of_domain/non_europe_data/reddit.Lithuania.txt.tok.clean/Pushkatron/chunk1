i 'd love a nice note app whitch could let you put note widgets on your screen . 
  well esports do n't need much physical energy , cant deny that . 
  but emails do n't require a pen , ink , or paper , yet we still call it electronic mail . 
  go to settings , developer options , and tick stay awake . 
  it should do exactly what you want . 
  [ fusion messenger . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/android/comments/19yqyc/fusion_messenger_is_out_google_play_link_will_go/ ) made by shortfuse , still in beta though , but working amazingly already . 
  he also said he wants to integrate steam in his app , thats the main reason i 'm using it . 
  i have a galaxy tab 2 10.1 and it 's running 4.0.4 . 
  is there any way to update to jelly bean without having to root , because i do n't want to void the warranty . 
  [ catch ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.threebanana.notes ) is the best one i found so far , fits your description pretty well and has a beautiful ui . 
  mathematician imagines everything theoretically , engineer practically . 
  there 's some sort of network location blah blah blah thing and because of that maps are always running . 
  you can hibernate maps by using greenify , but it requires root . 
  that is in no way a problem with android . 
  its a problem with the app . 
  htc one is a new android phone with great build quality ( full metal body ) as well as ridiculously good specs . 
  it has been getting lots and lots of love from reviewers and is probably one of , if not the best android phone currently out . 
  i do n't have one myself , but a friend of mine does . 
  i played around with it a bit , and one thing i noticed is that it 's insanely fast , it never lags out or anything . 
  s4 , even with better benchmarks , performs less impressively . 
  loads of crap apps on s4 you will literally never use . 
  i 'd say go with the htc one . 
  it beats s4 in almost every aspect except for the camera . 
  you just called everyone in this thread stupid . 
  rooting simply allows you to do absolutely anything you want with your device , no limits . 
  you can delete any of the system apps , such as phone or google play . 
  rooting itself does n't modify your device in any way , so sense 5 and everything else should be fine . 
  its not a software problem . 
  your nexus 4 ( together with most other phones ) simply does n't give a strong enough singal through the 3.5 plug . 
  iphone or ipod send a very powerful signal , so the sound sounds louder and better . 
  only way to change this is to buy an amp . 
  fiio e6 is about 30 bucks on amazon and should do the job wonderfully . 
  and vice versa . 
  / r/atheism and / r/christianity oh , fun times would be had . 
  i 'm red-green colorblind personally and i can say that it makes a huge difference . 
  mobile data in lithuania is rather cheap . 
  pildyk , for example , offers 1 gb of data for less 2 $ . 
  also you can order a plan which gives you 170 minutes of free calls and a ton of sms for about 3 $ . 
  as airazz said , theres no lte in lithuania , only hsdpa which is still decently good . 
  i can watch 720p videos with little to none lag . 
  aaaand it worked . 
  we 're really sorry , the `` s '' at the end must really hurt . 
  now that you 're done crying may i remind you that russians sent tens of thousands of people to siberia ? 
  that russian tanks crushed peacefully protesting people ? 
  but it 's okai , we 've got our revenge , your names must end in `` s '' . 
  a real toturte . 
  if it was a caption on a photo , i 'm pretty sure it means `` with my best friend '' in a little bit douchey way . 
  this is fucking next level of retarded ultra patriotism right here . 
  is there some sort of cool atheist club that gives every member a fedora ? 
  [ street workout . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jgxi2iirig ), 
  the beggining can be really hard , but results come quickly and they are amazing . 
  you do n't even need to go to a gym , all you need to do is find a bar in park near you . 
  also all the exercises involve only your weight , so the chances of fucking up your body in the long run are minimal . 
  depends on your camera . 
  some dslrs have a function where they will keep the shutter open until they get a nice bright picture . 
  on others you just set high exposure , smaller iso and hope that you guessed the values correctly . 
  youtube usually does n't pull down videos about protests , wars , riot and so on , even if they violate their rules . 
  yt allows content that really needs publicity like this one . 
  eu is very likely to get involved , because lithuania and poland wo n't do much themselves against russia . 
  also , because of the deal between us and ukraine , if there 's armed conflict , us is very likely to get involved as well . 
  taking all that into consideration , i do n't think russians really want to mess with either lithuania or poland . 
  the place that the \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0411\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b ( baltic russian media ) claimed to be `` protester training camp '' is actually a complex of 6 small cozy houses , 1 hut with table football and 1 dinning hall . 
  [ source : i 've been there . 
  are you asking what companies can ship a book from you to lithuania , or what companies sell books and ship them to lithuania ? 
  no it 's not . 
  this is n't the first time it 's happening , where in the thumbnail , you can see a cat image , but when you open it , it turns out to be something different . 
  it 's not ops fault , it 's something about the way imgur handles urls . 
  are your grandparents ex-drug addicts that were in jails since they were 17 ? 
  lucky you ? 
  -90 comment karma , just as expected . 
  all that work for that one porn video . 
  this still surprises me a lot . 
  i get 1gb , unlimited texts and 300 minutes for 5 $ / month . 
  if i ever pass that limit , i can pay another 5 $ and it 's all over again . 
  living in lithuania has it 's benefits . 
  if you need some decent ones , go to ogmios miestas . 
  there are tons of great outlets and the prices are rather cheap . 
  if you need something really cheap , like i mean it cheap , go to gari\u016bn\u0173 turgus . 
  for < 1 euro i get 1gb monthly mobile internet and for ~ 5 euros i get unlimited fiber . 
  internet here is really fucking amazing . 
  the other two are midgets . 
  how long is it ? 
  drop it somewhere here , someone may do it . 
  btw , you posted this at 3 am lithuanian time . 
  or maybe there are people who like dark humor . ^ ^ ^ ^ who ^ ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ kidding ^ ^ ^ ^ lets ^ ^ ^ ^ cirklejerk, 
  that 's why he has a tennis academy named after him here in lithuania , 
  rekd, 
  there are no tethering limitations on any of them . 
  btw , how much data are you going to need ? 
  oh so it 's time for the penguin post again . 
  i 've got a knock knock joke , but you must start it . 
  who 's there ? 
  actually caused ww ii pretty directly too . 
  hitler fought in ww i and on the day versailles treaty was signed , he decided to become a politician so he could get revenge for the lost war . 
  / r/atheism and / r/circlejerk . 
  why have 2 if you can have 1 . 
  we / r/circlejerk now . 
  i thought it was obvious that they are all trolls .
