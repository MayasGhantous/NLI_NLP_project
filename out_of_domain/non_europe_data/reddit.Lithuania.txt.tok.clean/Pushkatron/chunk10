  after the season ended , he took one used snowboard and drilled holes for 4 trucks . 
  he called it an octopus . 
  it was n't as bad as you 'd expect . 
  i 'm not too sure , probably sliding , some tricks and a little bit of casual downhilling . 
  go basic / r/streetwear fboi . 
  oh , kebabs are the kings of fast food , you 'll find kebab kiosks all over the place , especially further away from downtown . 
  i suggest going to jammi , the kebabs there are probably the best around and they have more delicious fast foods like kold\u016bnai ( in english that would be pelmeni , but it 's just a transliteration from russian ) , kalmar\u0173 \u017eiedai ( fried calmari ) . 
  and you can find kvass in everywhere , but it 's not very popular amongst older people , as beverages with alcohol are preferred . 
  nice one . 
  this could be used speed up the program op mentioned quite a bit . 
  or a place where guy on guy action is also very common , / r/bodybuilding . 
  games or movies most of the time do n't portray hacking accurately because in reality , hacking is way more boring than people expect . 
  alright , this is gon na be a little extensive but i 'm pretty sure i can give you a lot of help in this subject . 
  keyboards are mainly divided into two groups - [ rubber domes ] ( http://www.technologyuk.net/computing/computer_systems/images/keyboard_06.jpg ) and [ mechanical keyboards ] ( http://cchotspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/general-mech-pic.jpg ) . 
  the difference between the two as you can see in the picture are the buttons , so called switches and how they work . 
  here are two gifs explaining how a [ membrane rubber dome works ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5k9uy.gif ) and how a [ mechanical switch works ] ( https://i.imgur.com/rjavuy7.webm ) . 
  because of their tactile feeling , mechanical keyboards are usually more expensive and more widely used by people who type a lot , like programmers and gamers , and are often said to be superior to rubber domes in every way , and actually i 'm typing this on one right now . 
  if you decided that you do n't type as much or you do n't want to spend a lot of money on a keyboard , then there is n't much choice , because more or less every rubber dome keyboard is the same , you can buy the cheapest at your local electronics store . 
  if you do decided to go for a mechanical , i 'm gon na be explaining differences between various mechanical keyboards . 
  this may seem odd to many people , but mechanical keyboards come in a huge variety of sizes . 
  there are [ full size keybaords ] ( http://www.pcper.com/files/imagecache/article_max_width/news/2013-07-03/cooler%20master%20quickfire%20storm%20xt%20mechanical%20keyboard.jpg ) , [ tenkeyless ] ( http://www.metalvortex.com/blog/0539555bb778_8552/fkbn88mukb01.jpg ) , [ 60 % ] ( http://g01.a.alicdn.com/kf/htb1lbopifxxxxbdaxxxq6xxfxxxx/ikbc-pokerii-60-white-mechanical-keyboard-compact-poker-2-mini-poker-ii-cherry-mx-switch-gaming.jpg ) , even [ 40 % ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j9n11cc.jpg ) and a lot in betweens . 
  on smaller keyboards like the 60 and 40 , you have to do a lot of macros to get to certain keys , for example fn +6 for f6 or fn + l for right arrow . 
  it may not seem comfortable at first , but you 'll get used to it and some times pressing a combination of keys can be a lot faster than reaching a key on the other side of the keyboard . 
  the size preference is all up to you . 
  * switches . 
  this is probably the most important part of a mechanical keyboard . 
  the most popular switches currently are chery mx . 
  here 's everything you need to know about [ switches ] ( https://wiki.installgentoo.com/images/7/7b/mech_keyboard_switches.gif ) . 
  it may be hard to make up your mind which switch to go for just after reading a bit of text , so i suggest going to a local electronics shop and seeing if there are any mechanical keyboards with the switches you 'd like to try , or buying yourself a [ switch tester ] ( http://cdn1.bigcommerce.com/server3900/acc24/products/659/images/3805/tester_05__36815.1410845262.1280.1280.jpg?c=2 ) which usually has the most popular switches . 
  * misc things , like backlighting , programmable keys , multiple key layers and so on . 
  these are all up to you again . 
  anyway , that 's quite a bit of info , but that pertty much makes it for mechanical keyboards . 
  give / r/mechanicalkeyboards a visit , there are a ton of people who 'd be happy to help you and give a look at their wiki , but it 's rather messy there . 
  the best place to buy a keyboard is probably massdrop.com , they have a ton of good deals on them . 
  ** mouse **, 
  mouses have a lot of differences in them , such as the sensor position , weight , dpi and such , so the best thing to do here is again try out what feels the best . 
  again , try checking the local electronics shop to see if there are any decent mouses , the most popular one 's are steelseries sensei , razer deathadder ( however people had different luck with the quality of razer products , i 'd stay away from them if i were you . 
  / g / has a ton of guides on mice , [ here 's one ] ( https://wiki.installgentoo.com/images/7/77/1325457792930.jpg ) that 's relatively unbiased and mentions few mice that i did n't . 
  ** headset **, 
  usually , headsets are frowned upon in the gaming community for many reasons . 
  first , companies like razer or steelseries put in more work in design or leds rather than speakers . 
  secondly , the mic on the headset is usually rather shitty , picking up a lot of background noise and such . 
  instead i 'd suggest buying some decent headphones and a microphone seperatly . 
  almost any cheap acme desk mic will do much better than a headset one . 
  check out / r/headphones , they have a lot of good stuff in they 're sidebar , you can definitely find something for yourself . 
  a popular and somewhat cheap choice is audio technica m50x . 
  they 're praised for their quality , also sometimes you can find them on massdrop . 
  anyway , this about does it for my recommendations . 
  i 'd suggest you put a little research before buying any of those things , because you 'll be stuck with them for a long while  i 'm currently typing on a poker 3 60 % cherry mx blue keyboard , and using my steelseries sensei raw and sennheiser hd 498 . 
  i hoped i helped you at least a little . 
  if you have any more questions , feel free to reply to me or pm me . 
  make sure thee charger itself is n't some cheap chinese fake . 
  they create a very unstable current which can easily screw up your pi . 
  and / r/fatpeopleha oh wait, 
  any reason to unroot it ? 
  is it only because you have no use for root or does root create security holes ? 
  i 'm currently studying computer science and i 'm thinking of pursuing a career in network security or a similar field . 
  how do you think things in such fields are going to be changing in the upcoming years/centuries ? 
  if any asshole can get access to your phone ca n't he root it as well ? 
  any examples of what would be the right shoes and pants ? 
  hey , i placed an order and pmd you , not sure if you saw it , 
  i 'm not sure why you 're getting downvoted . 
  if russia attacked lithuania , that means an all out war between the west and russia , because we 're a part of nato . 
  i 'm pretty sure the russians would n't be holding anything back , and let 's be real , we 're really small in comparison to russia . 
  yeah , exactly , that 's why true randomness is rarely used in the wild . 
  for example every major music player ( itunes , spotify , google music ) use complicated algorithms to make sure that shuffle function meets certain criteria , such as no two songs by the same artist in a row and so on . 
  as somebody said , `` they made it less random to make it feel more random . '', 
  it 's probably not very legal to share such things , although i doubt anyone really gives a shit . 
  it 's better to pm them . 
  id at 6 o'clock in the inner circle ? 
  thanks . 
  fuck this is a post about an article about yesterdays reddit post . 
  for real ? 
  that 's a bad analogy . 
  people rarely post fits of other people here only to make fun of them , unless the fits are intentionally ironic or funny . 
  not exactly klaipeda , but not so far away is the curonian spit . 
  the nature over there is beautiful , tons of forests and dunes , also several small fisherman villages with old traditional architecture buildings . 
  that 's a custom right ? 
  i 've never seen a givenchy case . 
  seeing as there are stripes of pure red , green and blue i 'd guess that this is a very high resolution picture of a tv screen or a monitor , which was then severely smudged and distorted and then downscaled to a smaller resolution . 
  100 mb/s shared between usb and ethernet is a huge bottlemeck . 
  really limits the possibilities of a home server . 
  well , you technically can regenerate every previous prime , but that 's ridiculously inefficient . 
  anyway , to fix your code , there 's an easy and inefficient way and a tad bit harder but significantly more efficient way , especially when you need to deal with big numbers . 
  easy way : right now , you 're only checking whether your number is divisible by 2 and 3 . 
  instead , check that whether the number is divisible by every number up to sqrt ( number ) , inclusive . 
  a simple for cycle should do . 
  harder way : save every prime you 've already generated in a vector . 
  if you 're not familiar with vectors , they 're very simple , read up on google about them . 
  then , instead of checking divisibility of every number before your current number , you only need to iterate through the vector and check whether the number is divisible by any of the primes . 
  i hope i made it clear , if you need anything feel free to ask . 
  it 's nice and fun when a company throws around memes like that , but i think in some cases pointint the guy in the right direction of ascending would be a better idea . 
  if he does n't know much about pc gaming i 'm sure the tweet only confused him . 
  not exactly . 
  there are routines that aim for hypertrophy , while others aim for strength . 
  of course , one does n't come without the other , but it is possible to focus on gaining more strength rather than hypertrophy and vice versa . 
  the new orange pi pc or whatever it 's called is also pretty good and ridiculously cheap compared to others . 
  are you sure that you 're getting 10 megabytes per second ? 
  because that 's on the brink of the 100 mbit ethernet maximum speed , not even talking about the shared chip which should bottleneck it a lot more . 
  try rutracker or country specific trackers .
