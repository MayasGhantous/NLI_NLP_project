  * 1000 megabytes ( mb ) in a gigabyte ( gb ), 
  * 1 000\u00a0000\u00a0000 bytes ( b ) in a gigabyte ( gb ), 
  the difference here is between the [ si prefix ( powers of 10 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metric_prefix#non-metric_units ) and [ binary prefix ( powers of 2 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/binary_prefix ) . 
  there really is no discussion how many bytes there are in a megabyte , rather which prefix system is more practical . 
  anyway , we ca n't get rid of either of them because they have their own roles . 
  would you really care at that point ? 
   older version, 
  it 's not a good idea to use a very outdated client when there are better up to date alternatives . 
  you really do n't know what a ddos is , do you ? 
  it was probably [ `` ekskomisar\u0173 biuras '' ] ( http://www.ekskomisaru-biuras.lt/media/ess/photo3.jpg ) . 
  because of exactly what / u/tieluohan pointed out . 
  outdated software is riddled with vulnerabilities . 
  nobody 's arguing that 2.2.1 is nice and functional , but it 's simply stupid to be using a 5 year old proprietary program . 
  i see your point , but it 's a sort of security through obscurity , better take precautions and use some open source up to date software , but it 's your call . 
  i love your hierarchy op , probably going to steal something from it . 
  in the mean time , my ~ is a complete mess . 
  checked it out and i have 4 directories for storing ebooks , bunch of random scripts , a folder named ` trash ' which i should symlink to ~ , an empty file named ` echo ' probably from the time i accidentally used the wrong pipe , ` desktop ' directory even though i only ever used bspwm and oh god how many more terrible things . 
  time to clean up , i guess . 
  i do n't think the supply is poor , rather the demand is overwhelming . 
  the foundation could try increasing the prices to cope with it , but i think their whole point of the zero is to make a computer as cheap as possible . 
  usually they 're limited to 1 per customer , at least on the majority of retailers . 
  it 's aape you fucking casual . 
  lots of good stuff said here , not gon na repeat what others said . 
  as for appetite , i suggest drinking a lot of milk , it has relatively a lot of calories and liquid foods are much easier to consume when you 're not hungry . 
  leaking the source code of an unreleased game definitely deserves punishment . 
  if he had responsibly disclosed the bug to valve , i 'm pretty sure they would have actually offered him a job . 
  got a link to the third fit sweater ? 
  dope fits btw . 
  us seems to be moving in a completely different direction though , with all the efforts to legalize marijuana . 
  lovely picture and a beautiful pen . 
  you can see a tad bit of chromatic aberration on the end of the nib . 
  have one myself , a lovely keyboard definitely , but such a pain in the ass to disassemble and clean . 
  haha , trust me , you 're not the only one . 
  however other ibm keyboards are a lot more sane , the model m atleast does n't shoot springs at you . 
  i would disagree , gentoo is similar to arch because both start from almost nothing and the key difference between the two is that gentoo compiles everything , while arch uses binaries . 
  how good is bib for textbooks ? 
  i rarely find the ones i need in epub on mam or any other educational tracker . 
  i 'm more than sure nike thought about that . 
  it 's also very sad that quite a lot of people in the comments are absolutely ok with this and see nothing wrong . 
  well obviously it 's because of your fast metabolism and not actual eating habits / s, 
  nice post op . 
  \u0160aunu , kad user inputas n\u0117ra validatinamas . 
  for example eff or fsf . 
  damn they blend in together very naturaly . 
  well done op . 
  you do realize how hard it is to not have a majority on either grow or stay ? 
  currently we have 3055 members , so unless somebody goes to abandon , we will always have a majority somewhere . 
  used [ this guide ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards/comments/2n3soi/_/ ) for some directions . 
  the only things i did differently is i never removed the keycaps from the pot and let them cool down while still submerged in the dye . 
  results were great , i only tested this on some of my leftover keycaps from the banggood set . 
  next up i 'm going to be dyeing my pok3r modifiers . 
  whoops , fixed the link , 
  about 45 minutes and then let them cool . 
  that 's correct , 
  i was slightly jiggling the paper while it was scanning . 
  different dpis also produced different results due to the scanning speed . 
  industrial model ms are probably the most beautiful keyboards for me . 
  that 's an amazing snatch !, 
  that 's runway fashion , you 're not supposed to be wearing those clothes . 
  they 're more like canvas for fashion designers - it 's an art form that serves little to no practical use . 
  \u0420\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442 is dawn or morning , and \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442 is sport . 
  / r/upvotedbecauseboobs, 
   actually booted it last week on an old computer, 
  lts really standing for what it means . 
  those are beautiful !, 
  think you could make some of them 1080x1920 for a phone wallpaper ? 
  edit : [ op delivered !, 
  beautiful setup . 
  could you share you irssi theme ? 
  could n't find it in the links . 
  there 's no such thing as ` normally ' in arch , you have whatever you install and configure yourself . 
  and with a little time it can really become a work of art . 
  that 's pretty much on point , except i 'd change the sun - part from `` soon '' to `` sun '' . 
  the syllable is supposed to be short . 
  there was a post somewhere about how majority of the links form the pixels are already dead . 
  i prefer naming my machines after various country leaders . 
  `` i wonder where the source code is , did i leave it on genghis khan , or did i transfer it to henry viii ? '', 
  purely for fun and education . 
  i have three pis gathered from various occasions just waiting to be connected to a single cluster . 
  how do you like yabar ? 
  thinking about moving to it from lemonbar . 
  do n't really need them , but wanted to thank you op for doing this , that 's very kind of you !, 
  this guy knows his plugs right here . 
  that looks really neat !, 
  could you go into more details about how did you do the double exposure ? 
  did you just take two photos and merge them in photoshop ? 
   any program, 
   even games, 
  wait what ? 
  css is n't used anywhere past websites . 
  what mate , you 've got something terribly confused . 
  games are almost never developed with css , with the incredibly rare exceptions of doing it for a challenge . 
  as for the original doom , it was released in 1993 , while the first version of css in 1996 . 
  i usually just send the process to background or use screen . 
  if i only need the script to turn on every now and then , then i use cronjobs . 
  nope . 
  if you do everything the guy said above , doing . / filename.py will simply launch the script . 
  make sure you 're actually outputting something . 
  also , you can show us your code if you feel that that 's the problematic part . 
  i 'm not debating the fact that it causes slowdowns , but what 's the actual reason for them ?
