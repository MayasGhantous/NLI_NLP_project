  cmon , there 's atleast 5 of these comments on every video that reaches frontpage . 
  do you really think he 's serious ? 
  you created this account for karma , you bastard . 
  umarai is a pretty nice and big bike shop . 
  it 's located near ukmerg\u0117s gatv\u0117 , i 'd link you but i 'm on mobile . 
  the only concern is it might be a bit pricey , i 'm not sure . 
  what does mfa think about an undercut with the sides shaved off completely ? 
  actually wolfram can make almost [ any curve . 
  real nice to see the planes get along . 
  waratahs 26-14 crusaders, 
  because this gif was made with it 's main intention to be accurate . 
  thats also the reason he posted it to this sub . 
  here are some of my shots i took with my sii using a micro lens !, 
  [ some random text . 
  [ a water bottle . 
  and some shots of an old book, 
  umm . 
  this sub is called / r/android for a reason ... 
  that 's one of the reasons i love programming . 
  i remember when my friends and i were still learning the basics , everytime we needed to learn an algorithm , we would just google it and you could find a lecture about it by the guy that came up with it , while in maths , it 's a rare occasion if you can find a photo of the guy . 
  in most cases cameras were n't a thing back then . 
  no , it 's latvia exclusive . 
  it 's funny how they 're all looking to their left to see if they 're doing it correctly . 
  but dude , that 's not a cat . 
  [ okay , i fixed it . 
  do you think comparing different education systems is already politics ? 
  i mean the comment literally states it in the first paragraph . 
  did you even read it ? 
  like are you serious right now ? 
  did you even read the comment , never again he mentions the educational system , every paragraph is a different argument for the same topic . 
  this has been this way for a long time and it 's unlikely to change . 
  root and flash a rom or get a nexus . 
  bad kind of folks tend to hangout at nights . 
  i 'd need one . 
  haha ^ get ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ one ^ ^ ^ ^ oh ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ god, 
  edit : jesus most of the replies to this are from accounts less than 5 days old . 
  some people are really desperate . 
  and on / r/gifs, 
  maybe third one too ? 
  goddamn less than a minute . 
  my uncle has a heart of a lion and a lifetime ban from the local zoo . 
  try harder you say ? 
  i raped a girl last night . 
  it sucks , but she gave me aids . 
  how does a 9 year old get aids ? 
  either way , i guess my sisters hanging out with the wrong people . 
  thanks dude !, 
  claiming an invite until the preorders starts . 
  when they do , shipping times are expected to be longer . 
  nexus 6 came out already and it 's a huge let down . 
  note 4 is better in almost every category by a margin . 
  i was looking into the n6 and decided to go for the opo instead . 
  i 'll finish it when i get back home in an hour or two . 
  i 'll make a full boot animation . 
  [ here it is !, 
  also i 'll try and make it into a full boot animation now . 
  this has no intro or outro . 
  haha !, 
  here 's the [ bootanimation.zip ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/ez4876w4mdfa3f1/bootanimation.zip?dl=1 ) if anyone wants it . 
  she 's massive compared to everyone else . 
  ooooh , another dev found ? 
  that giraffe coin was unexpected . 
  very awesome of you !, 
  they 're gon na be shutting down what ? 
  great quality meme , thanks for contributing to quality content on the sub . 
  this is a trophy for you , op . 
  red wings i 'd guess . 
  this is a terrible way to compare raw pictures . 
  they 're made to be tinkered with in after processing , that 's why they look really terrible without any editing . 
  pssst , you forgot to photoshop your face on the third photo . 
  they may have been sold refurbished parts by the hardware manufacturer . 
  this was some russian equivalent of swat training . 
  i think i have some spare old humble indie bundle steam codes . 
  you want some ? 
  i 'm in bed right now , i 'll send you the codes tomorrow , 
  i think he meant the little stutter at the end of the loop . 
  btw , what program did you use to make this ? 
  actually i think it only happens on res . 
  if i open it in a new tab , the stutter disappears . 
  it says on the main page that the phone will arrive before christmas . 
  this is fucking beyond disappointment . 
  i 'm now listening so some trash song with no way to skip it . 
  what the fuck spotify . 
  reading the comments made me think about the consequences of this . 
  half of the comments here are calling the song bullshit pop radio trash etc. , so i do n't think any artist would like his music played as an ad . 
  it 's not like `` it 's free , they can throw as many ads as they like '' . 
  this whole thread would be pointless if we go by your phrase of `` deal with ads or make a budget '' . 
  we 're here to show that we do n't like this change and that we 're not gon na comply with it . 
  yes , it 's kinda a fad here , buying a diztronis case and putting a dbrand skin on it . 
  i have one myself and it both looks and feels amazing . 
  and yes , it 's grippy . 
  seeing as she is 11 years old , i would n't recommend android or ios app development . 
  it 's a pain in the ass to get started and it takes a long time until you can finally make something like a proper app or a game . 
  i 'd suggest robotics , because it teaches programming very well , is relatively easy and can be a ton on fun . 
  [ yup , here 's the dbrand website ] ( https://dbrand.com/shop/oneplus-one ) . 
  it was made to be put straight on the phone , but it fits the case very nicely as well . 
  all of the materials , except for the carbon fiber i think , are fake . 
  they do have the texture of the said materials , here are some photos i found on google ( warning , huge images ) : [ titanium ] ( http://www.tecnetico.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dsc01458.jpg ) , [ leather ] ( http://thedroideffect.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/s1100004.jpg ) , [ carbon fiber 1 ] ( http://www.todaysiphone.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/img_0670.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.todaysiphone.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/img_0667.jpg ) . 
  they feel very nice and are definitely worth the price . 
  there 's also the camera skin , a tiny piece around the camera , you can get it in different color than the rest of the skin , that 's why the area around the camera is red in op 's photo .
