  that flashbang throw was so smooth, 
  over an hour ? 
  how ? 
  imo the best thing to do is not to worry about crafting your own armour until you 're cp 160 . 
  i went all the way from level 1 to cp 160 with only looted gear and i had no problem with it . 
  but one thing i have to say is , take up researching in blacksmithing , clothing and woodworking as soon as possible . 
  what this does is it allows you to craft items in better sets with a wider variety of traits much sooner . 
  researching times get ridiculously long , so the sooner you start the better . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucb26io_5o watch this video and his follow up video explaining his build and such, 
  43-50 is nothing . 
  just play the game like you would usually , quest , or if you really want to get to 50 then farm dolmens ( in auridon for example ) with training gear and breda 's magnificent mead for the 100 % increase in xp received . 
  after that the first 100 or so cp will be extremely easy , and everything will slowdown once you enter cp200 + , and the xp requirement will increase by a lot every cp . 
  just as the others have said , he can be found in the east part of windhelm , in a small house to the left of the enchantment building , known as `` skald-king 's temporary throne '' . 
  oh hey another weekly head hitbox post, 
  all of your points should go straight to stamina . 
  if you have trouble with sustainability , try putting on siphon health glyphs on your weapons and using the best food for health ( or even health + stamina ) that you can get at your level . 
  also , i recommend using bloodthirst as your main cc spam ability , as it leeches even more health from the enemy straight to you . 
  i think that 10-17k dps is alright for most vet dungeons . 
  this has happened to me in a normal faceit game , also someone was able to use the console to send messages , and at somepoint someone in my team accidentally got noclip turned on . 
  to add to this , if you do n't `` claim '' this bonus on that day , it will stack onto your next bonuses until you log on and use up the bonus, 
  umm the op said heroic , not north . 
  heroic has 6 characters and so does fnatic . 
  wow , thanks man , i 'll be sure to check them out !, 
  greatly appreciate the help, 
  hm thanks . 
  despite my limited past interest in nba , i always had a thing for d. rose ( is that consider elitist around here ? ), 
  but thanks for giving me a general idea of how people view the teams . 
  yup , love the way he plays , found him extremely easy to root for during the rio olympics . 
  thanks for the suggestion , will make sure to look into it !, 
  oh , perfect . 
  thanks !, 
  thanks op !, 
  pretty sure any regular trainer can remove npcs and give you god mode , but they only work on single player, 
  your ma should 've pulled out, 
  what 's wrong with playing on 16:9 res and listening to music in the background ? 
  or turn down your music enough to not have it louder than the game ? 
  how true or untrue that is i can not say , but i 've realised that when i play with music in the background in an intense game , i tend to completely zone out the music and fully focus on communications and the game itself . 
  the music is there for me to relax in between the rounds , because i have the sound balanced in a way that i can barely hear the music if there 's sound in the game . 
  tell her how the ira made you run like hell away, 
  being knocked out from a minor qualifier by some unknown teams is good ? 
  thanks , exactly what i needed !, 
  i 'll probably pick it up today then . 
  perfect !, 
  i 'm definitely convinced that i want to try this out . 
  thank you both !, 
  are you actually serious ? 
  even sadokist pointed out that he heard him as soon as it happened . 
  in cs there 's more than just seeing people , you can hear them too fyi, 
  this is the stupidest argument ever . 
  even if you 're throwing every game of those 2200 hours you 're bound to learn how to play the very basics of the game , which is to stop and then shoot . 
  you ca n't excuse poor play with `` having fun '' . 
  great video . 
  and btw you sound a lot like steel, 
  when i smurf i behave normally with others , both teammates and opponents , unless someone starts talking shit or just being toxic in general , only then do i become a condescending twat to them . 
  ( but tbf , i only smurf in mg1-le level , so they 're not that much below me in terms of skill ), 
  what ? 
  the g303 is easily 1 of the best claw grip mice on the market . 
  ah fair enough , i thought there was something technical that i did n't know about them , because i often see them pop up in claw grip mice recommendations . 
  could also be martinkevicz if it 's polish , right ? 
  a fair amount of people do . 
  just because you think it 's shit does n't mean that everyone else does . 
  well why do n't you ? 
  there are plenty of guides out there for getting better at the game . 
  `` anything you want to enter ( do n't need to enter a number ) !, 
  i will use the ? sort = random command to choose the winner ! '', 
  thanks for the kindness !, 
  what ? 
  is this a joke that i do n't get ? 
  riight , i guess i do ? 
  note the year . 
  i doubt time and ammunition was widely available anymore . 
  very similar to ronald reagan 's joke https://youtu.be/mn3z3esvg7a ( from 0:00 to 1:18 ) . 
  ohhh i 'm flashed . 
  i 'm - oh my fucking god !, 
  dude , why is it that when i flash somebody , it 's like i just slapped them in the face with a fucking napkin from a little kid 's birthday party . 
  but when i get fuckin ' flashed , it 's like some big brollic black dude named fuckin ' requis pulls a fucking bedsheet up and around my head and just proceeds to skull fuck me ? 
  good argument there, 
  i have noticed on many occasions that having self-radio playing causes my fps drop by 10-15fps , and when i return to any other radio station , or just turn the radio off , the fps sets back to 60 ( i have vsync on ) . 
  i 'd like someone else to try this out so that we could get a confirmation of this being a legitimate thing . 
  so i was wondering about this ever since my history teacher told us about germans getting executed for not listening to hitler on the radio . 
  is it true ?

  [ removed ], 
  so as the title states , i 'm really unsure on how much max health i should attribute to my dps stamina night blade build , where i 'll most likely be using dw . 
  thanks !, 
  so as you can see , as a nord , i got items for khajiits and argonians , which i can not trade in to crown gems or use . 
  any clues on what i could do about this ? 
  as a lithuanian , i always liked basketball , but i never followed any of the basketball scenes . 
  recently i 've been having a great urge to get into nba and basketball in general as a viewer and a follower .
