crashed on pearl river late in the game . 
  playing in eu servers and not using any mods . 
  edit : looks like it happened for all the players on both teams . 
  was driving kv-1, 
  could somebody provide source on the picture ? 
  civ 5 number 7, 
  [ / r/asoiaf ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/ ) is my favorite subreddit . 
  thanks for the help brothers, 
  you could use a crack . 
  this is my first sale since ascending to the master race and i have been wondering if i should buy any of valves products now or wait till they go on a daily sale ( if they even do ) ? 
  also is dragon age origins worth it ? 
  thank you for the help, 
  how can i do that ? 
  thanks . 
  would be really happy if i got it . 
  nah not this one . 
  borderlands 2 would be nice, 
   as to alienate people into thinking that next generation is not as powerful as pc, 
  just wait till witcher 3 comes out . 
  everything shall be made clear . 
  risk of rain, 
  i 'm from lithuania . 
  and it 's seems i 'm the only one from there . 
  fits time steam sale here . 
  bought three games for $ 10 . 
  without the sale it would have costed $ 50 . 
  god i 'm happy to be part of pcmr . 
  i 'll be sure to give it a bash . 
  it 's a 2d moba style game . 
  i think . . 
  so i ca n't gift individual games from the collection ? 
  thanks for the info . 
  i guess i wo n't be buying the collection then, 
  sorry looks like this do n't work the way i expected it does . 
  aslain 's modpack is a good one . 
  has a lot of customizable features . 
  you are stuck with all 4 of them . 
  you probably should just ask on the official thread of the modpack in question . 
  i do n't really now much about these things . 
  as a lithuanian brother i can confirm this . 
  in the city where i live you could get a fiber connection of 500mb/s for 30 $ . 
  try dragon age origins or witcher 2 for rpg games . 
  metro series also have a decent story , in my opinion . 
  all gone . 
  bots must have grabbed them . 
  oh my god . 
  i 've been building pcs the wrong way all my life . 
  be right back guys have to redo mine . 
  that is mostly because consoles are expensive as shit there . 
  ace of spades : battle builder would be good http://steamcommunity.com/id/theeimas, 
  actually found it myself http://www.xvideos.com/video8020086/molly_jane_in_dad_thinks_i_am_mom_hd_, 
  god dammit . 
  anyway , thanks for the info , guess i 'll be waiting for the next sale . 
  thanks for the tip . 
  how can i make my games appear this way ? 
  thanks mate, 
  and that kids is how a woman orgasms . 
  here have some karma for the giveaway . 
  would really like it, 
  pc master race button does not work and it makes me sad . 
  now it 's glorious and i 'm happy . 
  thanks, 
  close , but no cigar . 
  thanks for the info . 
  also if i incorporate them do i get cores on their provinces or will i have to create them ? 
  i 'll probably just do as you said . 
  to answer your question : using eve mod i abdicated the throne to my 16 year old heir and claimed the austrian throne . 
  after waiting a few years i declared war on them to claim the throne and won . 
  and that forced them to go in to a personal union with me . 
  the same thing happens whenever a new nexus page for a game is made . 
  just tits and ass everywhere . 
  not sure why i did n't believe you , but now i have seen it all . 
  could anyone find the flash game they were talking about at the end . 
  for research purposes . 
  thanks mate . 
  going to do some research . 
  and maybe some more later . 
  matilda and pz-1c are mine . 
  but nowhere in the article is it stated that the train is bound for kharkiv . 
  that train could be going to russia for all we know . 
  is it really worth it ? 
  i fell you man . 
  i 've been using the intel stock one for years . 
  have you tried installing the unofficial patches ? 
  here is one : http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/51664/?tab=1&amp;navtag=http%3a%2f%2f, 
  and another one : http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/45104/ ? 
  do n't use both at the same time . 
  enable one and check if it works , if not then turn off the previous and enable the other . 
  you should use nexus mod manager to install mods ( http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/modmanager/ ? ), 
  and you will probably need to register , to download mods ( http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/register/ ? ), 
  pretty sure everything has been grabbed by bots . 
   in a new development , russia says it has set up its own team of experts to investigate the plane crash , according to ria novosti agency . 
  investigate , more like to cover up their involvement . 
  i do n't really have any money , so i 'm with you on this one brother . 
  thought [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fraemhqdlfs&amp;channel=6funswede ) would fit here . 
  `` who installs a power switch on a psu '', 
  `` so that 's where that screw should have gone '', 
  that actually is a very good idea . 
  thanks mate . 
  do n't really know how to do that .
