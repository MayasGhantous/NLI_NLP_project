  `` i 've been on the fence for a while about leaving and even told them in the summer that i was because i could n't stand not being able to do something . 
  but i do n't really see much point in leaving because i 'd still be down to do anything remotely if they approached me . 
  we 're not on bad terms or anything . 
  distant , but not bad terms . 
  i 've had plenty of moments where i 've gotten angry at them for not really getting included a whole lot , writing rants on tumblr , and i 'm sure that 's only contributed to the problem of becoming distant . 
  but i 'm working on it . 
  i 'm just doing my own thing for now and reaching out to record every so often . 
  i really enjoyed meshing both of these groups together . 
   i like everyone to be friends and to not dwell on our past histories with each other . '',
