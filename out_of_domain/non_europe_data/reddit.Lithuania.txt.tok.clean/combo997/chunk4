  * who 's day ? 
  * the day is n't named after the card ... the card is named after the day . 
  deep dude, 
  that 's what i 'm saying !!,

  * ... i have a dream ... *, 
  * `` do n't confuse an adjectival label ( sometimes called an `` attributive noun '' ) ending in s with the need for a possessive .

  do you attend a writers ' conference or a writers conference ?

  if you can insert another modifer between the - s word and whatever it modifies , you 're probably dealing with a possessive . 
  possesive noun .
