  i am not sure about this rooting stuff and these things , i heard that they give more power to the user , so i am asking , what about rooting on n910f model ? 
  what is that rooting process ? 
  what i will be able to do after rooting ? 
  how hard it is ? 
  please , explain it to me . 
  interested , because of reasons , and i knew someone who did that . 
  for example : if i see snow outside , i want to listen to the music that would accompany snowy weather . 
  so , we brought home a little laika and her name is taiga . 
  we brought her home when she was around 3 months old , but she lived close by , so i would go to pet and play with her everyday . 
  she used to bite me when she was growing up , i mean when she was 1-2 months old , it was okay back then . 
  but once she grew a bit more , her bites got rough . 
  i tried to train her , saying that i do n't like it , when she bites too rough , or when she bites too rough making a time off for a few minutes until she calms down . 
  i never used violence against her , trained her to sit well , however , the biting does n't stop , and when she is over excited she bites me even more and does n't listen to commands . 
  what should i do ? 
  she doesnt seem to bite my mother . 
  picture of when the culprit was still innocent .

  hello ,, 
  i am not looking for anything more than a platonic friendship . 
  sorry to dissapoint you . 
  i recently moved to uk , and i havent been going out anywhere , i am not the type to go out often , so i am fine with it , and i need to find someone to interact with , to share my life , my boring everyday life with someone . 
  rant , vent , talkg about how horrible some things are , or just being goofy . 
  i have weird taste in music , i like indie , some rock , a bit of pop and classical . 
  i like discussing serious matters too , but please be advised , that i am not very good at some things , but i think that i am rational at least . 
  oh well , just give me a message . 
  as someone who is learning programming , i recently got into mongodb , i do n't quite get it currently , why people hate it so much ?
