  i wonder if it 's worth the money , because i already know css and html ? 
  _ does udemy provide good quality ? 
  so , my father once played skyrim on my pc , and said that it was pretty cool !, 
  and that he liked it . 
  now i have no idea what to gift him , so i decided to buy him skyrim . 
  and i am not sure how to package it ( i will buy cd key ) . 
  i want to present it somehow nice looking or cool , without spending a fortune on it . 
  any creative ideas ? 
  ( please do n't tell me to just put the key in the envelope or smth like that . 
  if i will find the idea that i like , iwill definetely upload results !, 
  ^ ^ ) thank you all , cya soon !, 
  edit : i messed up title , ca n't change it : * sob *, 
  hello ,, 
  i was thinking , and thinking . 
  i decided to make coffee , and post here . 
  and i am here , sipping my coffee , and writing . 
  i realised that i might find some cool people here . 
  my favorite season is the cold one haha !, 
  basically winter . 
  my cup of coffee is half empty already . 
  i like gaming , though i do n't game as much as i used to , but i still game from time to time . 
  i like to read , i mostly read scientific books though , or philosophy , design . 
  i am not a christian haha , i am an anarchist and a free thinker , i love people who think for themselves !, 
  i am learning designing and programming and want to become a professional soon !, 
  i am a bit shy , but nice nonetheless !, 
  i think that i have strong accent that 's why i do n't talk much in english , but people tell me that they understand me and it 's fine , i am still self conscious . 
  i think the me of today , i would call myself an interesting person , at least a bit more than i used to be . 
  finishes his coffee okay , this will be all for me , i tried to put work into it . 
  ps i like anime . 
  no i am not weird . 
  thanks !, 
  i play a lot of zombies !,

  so hi . 
  i have been having a great week !, 
  until now !, 
  let me tell you what was going on in the past 2 days with my life . 
  first of all , my phone slid off , of my laptop , and then . . bam !, 
  yeah , a bam , it 's not working anymore , no ways of fixing , how cool , right !, 
  well , i was n't phased by it , it can happen to everyone , right ? 
  ^ ^ ok , now ... today . . 
  i accidently broke my sis 's bed ( it 's huge bed , and there 's this thing where you put your pillows onto or smth like that ? 
  maybe bed rest ? ), 
  i literally accidently destroyed that part ... 
  i look with the face of 100 seals . 
  well , poop happens . 
  well . . just minutes ago , i was using my earplugs , listening to music ( skullcandy ) . 
  as i was trying to put away my laptop , they apparently somehow were around me and i literally tore the connecting part from the earplugs apart . 
  ( the connecting part is still inside laptop . . ) so here i am , with the worst week in my life . 
  i ca n't wait for tomorrow , what will i break then ?
