  yeah , it was actually quite hot ... 
  i think he meant to say gameplay/game mechanics . 
  i understood him . 
  the first one had a bit more of survival horror to it . 
  the second game was feeling a bit dead rising to me . 
  ghost rider + floating cup . 
  they 'll be jumping faster than scooby on shaggy ... 
  my right ear lobe looks like buttocks . 
  erect penis points slightly left . 
  never broken any bones . 
  i wonder if someone had it with those snakes . 
  yeah i kinda hated him too , tbh . 
  he fucking lied about the `` living the dream '' in usa and fucking manipulated you in coming to sorting his mess out . 
  if there was a choosing option , roman would be swimming with the fishes by my hand . 
  seriously . 
  and i 'm not going into all that asking to hang out with him by phoning/texting , just ugh !!, 
  but i admit , he had some funny lines in the game . 
  what about authorities finding out about this breach of security ? 
  would n't that person get in trouble ? 
  i imagine everything is being monitored down there . 
  they ( cia ? . . 
  usaf ? ), 
  probably know even in what pose you sleep , lol . 
  not to mention the stuff you guys do for free time down there ? 
  are you constantly being tested with fake launch orders ? 
  war games movie intro segment made it look really realistic and stressful ( as far as i imagine and it looks convincing ) . 
  edit : yeah . . that question is already out there and answered . 
  anyway , thank you for this ama . 
  it it easily my favorite so far !, 
  i wish you peace and to launch boredom out of the silo roof instead of missles , 
  or a genius !, 
  everyone would assume that ` no idiot would use this simple code ' and no one would try it . 
  perfect .

  dressed up as hitler and walked around the city staying in character . 
  drank raw egg and puked . 
  sorry for your loss . 
  some people have no idea how to manage their pre-pube awkwardness and post stupid shit . 
  lithuanian is also the same : superior person , formal/group of people - j\u016bs ( `` yoos '' ) ; informal , friendly , personal - tu . 
  that 's mean . 
  a better half of you would respect your friend and not make it awkward/embarrassing for him by not telling him . 
  it 's not like it is fresh jizz and you 're hiv + . 
  your friend probably has less trust and/or respect for you now . 
   he 's ` cool ' simply because he owns something relating to half-life ? 
  well , that 's the concept of cool , it 's how it works . 
  you either be cool with your ` outside ' ( clothes , items , general behavior ) and/or with your character/personality/intelligence that fits some groups definition of cool in a certain time period . 
  therefore , that man is cool to me because i love half-life , and he is now more likable to me on first impression . 
  what is your field of healing ? 
  nice car !, 
  lucky boy to have such an amazing father . 
  i would be very proud . 
  [ whoa ... ] ( http://youtu.be/mqself6nk4y?t=15s ),

  5th element, 
  this posing is what would make an epic painting ( think leonardo da vinci  ), 
  earth 's forces would n't have minded some surplus of hev suits , to be honest . 
  im on my phone . 
  why these even exist , instead of embracing our youtube overlords ? 
  on a scale from 0 to 10 how realistic this game is ? 
  is it as ms flight sim to professional flight simulators ? 
  to me surgeon simulator 2013 was very hard to complete . 
  will surgeons of the future use this as training program ? 
  my heart is open for thoughts . 
  every single cell of those apartments has their own story to tell ... also has that very futuristic vibe going - shall i say ghost in the shell , blade runner , dredd 2012 ? 
  but wait !, 
  before rebooting , let me configure all these update files . 
  do n't turn off the vehicle engine . 
  your gf 's house is haunted . 
  you need to be careful with social media sites and work relations . 
  shit hits the fan so fast with they intertwine . 
  and what the fuck is up with registering one email as default incoming-to-phone account for actual emails and another as google play purpose only email . 
  and google play time to time just fucking switches as * it * likes . 
  like , one time i 'm downloading ` x ' and it uses normal acc , for downloading-only , that i intended for it to use . 
  then i download ` y ' thing and it uses that email that i never intended for it to use for downloading from google play . 
  is it just me doing something wrong ? 
  am i missing something ? 
  god damn it !, 
  when will this lying on the internet stop ?!, 
  i mean really , in 15 years of internet usage , i cought three people lying , including * you * . 
  is there no shame left ? 
  that matchbox . 
  i swear , the guy in the grey sweater is [ him ] ( http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/fix-it_felix,_jr . ) . 
  i bet he even sounds like him . 
  edit : typo . 
  this is not what i was expecting . 
  today i 've ingested two whole milks . 
  your boy better be good for you . 
  also , what field of medicine do you work in ? 
  what 's your job and hobbies ? 
  tell more about your family . 
  so what you 're saying is that op 's source is a faggot ? 
  only problem with me is the lighting . 
  it 's giving me cancer . 
  that cold whiteness , yuk .
