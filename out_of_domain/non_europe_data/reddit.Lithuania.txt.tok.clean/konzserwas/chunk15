  the reason why 3d printing is growing so quickly is n't because of some new technology , it 's because of some old technology that was patented . 
  3d printing became popular when the patent expired , allowing people to use it . 
  they got both . 
  the text in the end says the driver got arrested as well . 
  he was probably caught by the other cop ( we only see one , but they never ride alone ), 
  there 's another problem . 
  the shroud was woven in a way that did n't exist yet in jesus ' time , but was quite popular around the time that carbon-dating says it was made . 
  must have been quite a fire to completely remake the structure of the cloth without destroying it, 
  there 's a big difference between `` science ca n't answer that '' and `` science ca n't answer that yet '', 
  watts measure power . 
  think of it as speed . 
  a car going 100km/h will travel 100km in one hour . 
  a 100w device will use 100wh in one hour, 
  yes . 
  fun fact : when tarantulas are depressed , they lose their leg hair, 
  yup . 
  that 's also why lots of people do n't like how they look in photos : they 're used to a reversed image of themselves and a `` normal '' view looks weird . 
  i guess you could say consoles have a ridiculously low amount of memory , so games have to trade npc number for enviroment complexity . 
  the next tes game will be made with ps4/xb1 in mind , so hopefully we 'll see some actual cities . 
  space invaders managed even more npcs on even less powerful hardware . 
  oblivion could have more npcs with the same amount of memory , because the npcs and the enviroment were n't as complicated as in skyrim . 
  if the people who draw tattoos were accurate enough to not hit any cells with the needle , they 'd be out making millions by performing brain surgeries instead of drawing shitty tattoos . 
  ai is n't the only thing that uses memory . 
  everything does . 
  that bucket you just threw on the roof of belethor 's needs space as well . 
  even if the whole enviroment was the same , a different game engine might be enough to require trade offs in some parts of the game .

  n ( co2 ) = 5.48 / 44 = 0.1245 mol, 
  n ( c ) = n ( co2 ) = 0.1245 mol, 
  n ( h2o ) = 1.13 / 18 = 0.0627, 
  n ( h ) = 2n ( h2o ) = 0.125, 
  n ( s ) = ( 2.95-0 .125 * 1-0 .1245 * 12 ) / 32 = 0.0416, 
  so it 's c3xh3xsx . 
  now i 've no idea if it 's c3h3s , c6h6s2 , etc. 
  and i ca n't figure it out , because i do n't know the reaction . 
  i also ca n't check if this is n't nonesence for the same reason . 
  / r/whatisthisthing, 
  different method , same result . 
  you have 0,125 mol of h , not 0,0624 , because 1 mol of h2o contains 2 mol of h, 
  of course they eat honey . 
  why the hell would they make it if they were n't going to eat it ? 
  since 11/11/11, 
  lights on the other side are easier to see , no need to tilt your head up . 
  lights before the intersection are a bit less confusing , it 's clearer where do you need to stop . 
  in my country all intersections have lights both before and on the other side . 
  it 's perfect . 
  every time i 'm driving outside of my country i 'm wondering why could n't the cheap bastards place a couple of extra lights ... 
  start collecting the cats and tell people there was an accident . 
  though you would probably just get another bird on the next gift-giving occasion , since you loved this one so much .

  it was estimated that the sarcophagus would hold for ~ 30 years . 
  that 's until 2016 . 
  it 's also estimated that building a new one would take at the very least a decade . 
  it 's not started yet . 
  if plan a does n't work , we 'll go to plan b : we kill all the pigeons , grab as many mushrooms as we can and run for the hills . 
  you 're probably wondering what the hell i 'm talking about . 
  well , i was wondering the same thing about you . 
  could you elaborate what kind of a plan do you mean ? 
  active duty : being in the military is your day job . 
  you 're on base every day , either training or doing some work that needs to be done . 
  reserve : you join the military and go live your life like nothing happened . 
  in most cases you have to attend a week or two of training a year ( depends on the country and the military branch ) and that 's it , you can have any job you want . 
  however , you 're always on a kind of a standby , because you can be called for active duty at any time ( that usually happens when somebody declares war ) .

  botox is poisonous , because it relaxes your muscles . 
  when it relaxes the muscles you need for breathing , you die . 
  when botox gets injected into somebody 's face , it relaxes the tiny muscles just under your skin that are mostly used for facial expressions , and that kinda reduces wrinkles .

  it 's the movement of the rag . 
  the whole red color thing is a myth . 
  that 's not the homeless person 's problem, 
  in addition to what 's already said , the position in which humans give birth is completely retarded . 
  it 's designed to give the doctor good access without any concern for what makes sense physiologically , so births are actually much more difficult and painful than they need to be .

  if you think it 's impossible to have a good story without them , have a look at portal . 
  pretty sure arma 2 did this right . 
  anyways , i think the current system is actually better . 
  yes , it 's not realistic , and yes it does n't make any sense , but it 's convenient . 
  lots of genres trade realism for unhindered gameplay , a * truly * realistic game would be annoying as fuck . 
  that would only make sense if they added/forgot three digits,
