  best cheeseburger recipe ? 
  best gay porn video ? 
  it 's hard to think of a trophy design when you have no idea what the occasion is . 
  definitely, 
  that nobody gives a shit about your efforts . 
  result is all that matters . 
  which makes it * much * easier to stalk us, 
  the sims 2 is quite similar, 
  you might wan na make sure that you really ca n't run it though . 
  i 'm playing just fine with 2,13 ghz dual core pentium and intel hd graphics . 
  did you turn off advanced rendering in options ? 
  had exactly the same problem . 
  check the graphics options again , make sure all the fancy stuff is turned off . 
  are you by any chance euphoric at the moment ? 
  aaaaand now i 'll spend the evening wondering if it 's possible to legally own a submarine, 
  liver . 
  it 's fucking gross , but it has approximately all the vitamins . 
  [ yup ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liver_%28food%29 ), 
  if you wanted to do the most good long-term , the best idea would be to invest it , become a billionaire , and then donate your profits . 
  not if you live in a desert, 
  it 's pretty hard to answer this without getting called a racist , but i 'll try . 
  africa has a good climate . 
  if a person in europe decides to be lazy and just eat apples or something , he 'll be dead as soon as winter comes . 
  he has to prepare food , wood , build a decent shelter , etc. , or he wo n't see the spring . 
  if a person in africa decides to be lazy and just eat bananas or something , he 's all good . 
  winter does n't happen there , so there 's no need to build any advanced infrastructure, 
  that 's how it all started a long long time ago , anyway . 
  in more recent times africa is less advanced solely because europe and north america are abusing the shit out of them . 
  he severely underestimated the size of the earth , everyone who denied him ships was right . 
   helpless people , by the hundreds , are being slaughtered by their government . 
  and the solution , of course , is for more helpless people to be slaughtered by the thousands by another goverment . 
  by the time you find a way to block by keywords and specify those keywords , nobody will be talkng about it anyway . 
  internet forgets stuff like this real quick, 
  the one true god, 
  chernobyl warmed them up the last time ? 
  ** game of thrones next season spoilers below **, 
  your spine has spent the last few million years adapting to sleep on hard surfaces . 
  all that soft foam bs is one of the worst things you can do to your back . 
  sleeping on a really firm matress feels uncomfortable at first , but once you get used to it , you 'll never go back . 
  ** game of thrones next season spoilers below **, 
  printing is n't the same as developing . 
  people do it to digital photos . 
  * do n't log into stuff using unprotected wi-fi networks, 
  that 's true , but i do n't see how is that important to know . 
  it would be best for everyone if usa just turned off the damn fan, 
  that 's some impressive equipment . 
  too bad all of it will be either destroyed or abandoned 2 hours after the us air force gets there, 
  it might be difficult to go `` around the world '' having sex with people , when like half of people in the world would execute her for it . 
  we 're not there yet , folks . 
  10 bucks says this will be used as evidence that assad used them . 
  it 's like they 're not even trying anymore . 
  nice try, 
  a true optimist can always see a lot of pluses , even in a graveyard, 
  it was n't before you said it was, 
  nice try mr. kidnapper, 
  knees or gtfo, 
  first of all , define shock . 
  when most people say `` shock '' , they mean mental shock , which is n't actually the correct use of the term . 
  shock is a decrease of blood pressure , usually a result of bleeding out . 
  in this case , people die either of blood loss itself , or of infections that occur because white blood cells are n't there to defend you . 
  the `` do n't lift with your back '' stuff has little to do with muscles , it 's about not putting too much pressure on your intervertebral discs . 
  and then fuck it, 
  that 's exactly how they taught me in driving school . 
  never fails . 
  / u/presidentobama, 
  i bet somebody did . 
  cia took care of it . 
  that should 've been obvious because of the name . 
  took me a while too though . 
  fyi `` irregardless '' is not a word, 
  well , fuck you . 
  i 've never really noticed this , but i guess from now on i will . 
  so passes the age of enjoying moves :(, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ nah , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ we 're ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ good, 
  i never said it did, 
  there is a distinction . 
  gore is usually refered to as nsfl, 
  which society ? 
  somebody pulled the concept of fate out of their ass when they faced a difficult decision . 
  `` ummm , just in case i make the wrong choice , let 's pretend that it was meant to be '', 
  being gay then, 
  all you 're gon na get here is fans of one show poinlessly arguing with fans of another show . 
  truth is , there 's no way to know which one will be most enternaining for you personally , so just randomly pick one . 
  `` successful '' as in `` it does n't kill people '' . 
  they have n't even started testing if it works . 
  his shadow looks like a teletubbie, 
  except that , you know , nobody has any fucking clue who did the gassing . 
  but what the hell , we wo n't let such a minor detail as not knowing who did it to obstruct justice !, 
  let 's just bomb whoever is more convenient to bomb !, 
  i know i do n't, 
  nah , they 're learning how to properly clear your browsing history . 
  it 's a very useful skill , considering german porn . 
  doctors, 
  learn programming and try to create a similar simulation . 
  if i get the beginning right , everything inside that simulation should be exactly the same as in ours . 
  that 's like an all-access pass to everything in history and in the future . 
  i seriously wonder what would religious folk do . 
  would they just conclude that god exists , and he is sitting somewhere in a dark room with a bottle of mountain dew ? 
  i guess we understand the word `` workaholic '' a bit differently . 
  yes , they are dedicated and they work hard , but their work hours are n't any longer than any simple job , at least where i 'm from .
