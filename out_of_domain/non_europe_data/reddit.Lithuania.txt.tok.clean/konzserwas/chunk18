  except for on-call nights , but that 's what , once a week ? 
  they have lives outside of the job . 
  dead link, 
  actually , this will be totally possible soon . 
  a few months ago mit created a light bulb that cools down the air around it , having an efficiency of ( for practical purposes ) ~ 150 % . 
  i 'd expect that to increase even more with further research . 
  on the bright side , you would literally shit gold, 
  * sigh * did you even read what i said ? 
  no it does n't , hence the `` for practical purposes '' . 
  the light it emits has 1,5 times more energy than the electricity it uses . 
  the extra energy is n't created , it 's the heat energy of the lamp 's suroundings , hence `` cools down the air '' . 
  i know the actual efficiency is n't above 100 % , but since nobody gives a fuck about the used up ambient heat energy , it 's ok to disregard it . 
  you mean it does n't ? 
  ok , that 's it , never going usa 'cause i 'd be scared to get anywhere near a road . 
  are the people writing your laws drunk or something ? 
  over here a typical driver 's license gets you the right to drive a car under 3500kg ( idk , that 's like 7500 pounds or something ) , which can include a trailer no heavier than 750kg . 
  also , it ca n't have more than 8 passenger seats . 
  if you exceed any of these numbers , you need a special license . 
  that 's a weird fetish , but whatever floats your boat , i guess . 
  as long as they consent . 
  i would n't be so sure . 
  being homeless means you ca n't afford a home , an iphone is usually cheaper . 
  if you have a good spot ( few of them do , but still ) begging can earn you as much as a middle-class salary . 
  nah , only the brave ones . 
  same reason why muslims ca n't decapitate people legally, 
  username very relevant, 
   could only ~ ~ of ~ ~ have come, 
  is it ? 
  i mean yeah , it 's a bit gory and in poor taste , but the principle is really the same . 
  that is , you ca n't do illegal stuff simply because you chose a belief system where it 's allowed . 
  i 'm comparing an illegal activity with an illegal activity . 
  there is no reason to excuse a crime , no matter how `` light '' it is . 
  also , `` causes no harm '' ? 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  oh , so it turns out i 'm talking to a pothead . 
  should have realised . 
  anyway , it does cause damage , it 's a fucking well-documented fact . 
  it may have a reletively large ld50 , but that does n't make it harmless . 
  nor does slowing down the growth of cancer cells . 
  chemo does that too , is it harmless ? 
  etc. . . 
  it 's not as dangerous as most illegal drugs ( which is why some places are legalising it ) , but saying that it 's harmless is just ignoring the facts . 
  yeah , i admit it was wrong to assume you were an addict . 
  but i 'm afraid i 'm not the only one here guilty of making assumptions : i am anything but anti-marijuana , i believe very strongly in legalising it , and i would love to see a trade where we legalise marijuana and ban alcohol instead . 
  as i previously said , it is way less dangerous than other drugs , including legal ones . 
  however , that does not make it completely harmless . 
  and i do n't think a source is right because it agrees with me , i think it 's right because it is a scientific page citing actual scientific studies with real data , instead of a vague statement in a one-sided page . 
  if you think the data is wrong , prove it . 
  show me something that refutes it . 
  otherwise , i suggest considering that this sentence may apply more to you , than to me :, 
   idiots thinking a source is right because it agrees with them . 
  one more thing :, 
   i wo n't be clicking those links, 
  unless you change your mind , that 's the end of the discussion . 
  arguing with people who ignore any evidence you show them tends to be about as productive as rewinding a dvd , and i have better things to do . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ watching ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ cat ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ gifs, 
  no , it 's not kapow-like . 
  it 's literally `` fuck '' , except for the verb meaning of `` fuck '' . 
  yes , the coasters, 
  `` all day '' is just pathetic for 2013 . 
  five years ago i had a phone that held a week . 
  ~ 10 days if you did n't call much . 
  do n't forget to flair it, 
  nope , you are . 
  he accidently posted two identical comments . 
  the other one is on the top, 
  you probably noticed it subconciously . 
  rear view mirror is always in your peripheral vision . 
  also , adjust your mirrors . 
  if you do it properly , your blind spot will be pretty much non-existant , certainy not big enough to hide a whole car . 
  since when is `` 5 hairs a day '' a major hair loss ? 
  i 've been losing double that every time i brush mine for the past ten years , and i 'm not noticing any lack of hair . 
   only downside : not being able to open the last beer without keys or something, 
  done that a few times . 
  with enough force you can put a cap back on an empty bottle and use that . 
  it does n't hold very well , but just enough for this purpose, 
  it 's a suggestion where you should hold the illegal lock-picking tools, 
  this sounds exactly like the hunger games . 
  treated incredibly , honored , representation of strenght . 
  even the `` special raising '' fits perfectly , if you 're talking about districts 1 and 2 . 
  in case you have n't , go watch that movie , and compare your arguments with what the psycho lady says . 
  let 's say you have a bottle of something that cleans floors . 
  it has ingredients a , b , c , d , e and f. b is the active ingredient . 
  that means b is the chemical that does the actual cleaning , while a , c , d , e anf f are water , odors , colourings , other stuff that sorta helps , but does n't perform the function of the product . 
  yeah , there 's only one `` o '' in lose . 
  however , there are two `` o `` s in loose . 
  pretty sure that one 's not a word though, 
  wan na know what happened to robb 's wife in the show then ? 
  it was 12 years ago , get over it, 
  not recommended until you fully stop though . 
  you will lose power steering , power brakes and possbily lock your steering wheel . 
  that 's the mother of all confirmation biases,

  alone against 100 , you 're fucked either way, 
  op is a pony ? 
  yes, 
  i do n't think a baby 's death is a tragedy, 
  for example ? 
  the risk of penile cancer is very small anyway , so it does n't make much of a difference , and reducing the risk of stds is n't relevant for newborns . 
  might wan na try / r/askhistorians for a detailed answer from people who really know what they 're talking about .
