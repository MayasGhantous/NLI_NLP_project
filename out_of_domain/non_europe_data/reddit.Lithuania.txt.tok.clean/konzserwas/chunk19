  just make sure to read their rules before posting , it 's one of the subs where they actually enforce their rules and hate people who do n't follow them . 
  no , they 're not . 
  we 're talking about babies here . 
  you know , the small versions of people that usually do n't have sex . 
  when they get old enough for std transmission rates to matter , they can voice their own opinion about it . 
  i do n't think anyone here is trying to deny the right of circumsision to people who want it for themselves . 
  all of the above , except of course baby kittens . 
  those things are too cute to die . 
  seriously though , i 'd say all of the above . 
  note however , that i do n't have children , and i do n't plan to have children in at least 5 years . 
  it would n't be a big surprise if this opinion would completely change the moment i hold my own baby . 
   but that 's better because now instead of both lungs being blocked at the trechea , it 's just one , and you still have another to breathe with . 
  well , maybe . 
  if it 's small ebough to get into the lung , it was n't big enough to completely block the trachea . 
  also , foreign object in the lungs usually means you 'll have pneumonia soon . 
  1 ) make it a habbit . 
  if you wake up at the same time for many mornings in a row , you 'll soon be waking up at that time without an alarm, 
  2 ) go to sleep at a reasonable hour . 
  this ca n't be stressed enough . 
  most people ~ ~ who have trouble waking up ~ ~ do n't give themselves nearly enough sleep . 
  if you need to be awake at 7 , you should be already asleep at 11pm . 
  there are some people who do n't need as much sleep , but you 're probably not one of them . 
  pretty much everyone thinks they 're one of them , and most are wrong about it . 
  3 ) stop using the snooze button . 
  seriously . 
  i know it 's hard , i 've been there . 
  just do it in steps , over a couple of weeks . 
  sleeping 10 minutes at a time is n't nearly as useful as continious sleep , my mornings are much better since i stopped raping that button and set the alarm for the time i actually intend to wake up at . 
  waking up at once also trains your willpower , so you 'll end up being more productive as a side-effect, 
  edit : one more thing , do n't break your sleep pattern on weekends . 
  it 's not worth it . 
  very soon you realise that browsing reddit on saturday morning is n't any different than browsing reddit on friday night . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ unless ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ ^ one ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ those ^ ^ ^ ^ people ^ ^ ^ ^ who ^ ^ ^ ^ go ^ ^ ^ ^ out ^ ^ ^ ^ sometimes, 
  i 'm pretty sure he knows that , being a certified emt, 
  it does n't really matter from the practical side , but that 's not the only side . 
  you 're happy your parents did it , what about the people who are n't ? 
  their body was altered without their consent or any significant health gain , where consent could be implied . 
  the change does n't have to be major , it 's a matter of principle : baby circumsision is a violation of basic human rights . 
  personally i find it both hilarious and disgusting that a country like usa , which claims to be very free and respecting human rights , has n't made this practice a crime yet . 
  as far as double standarts go , this is a pretty big one . 
  when they grow up , they are free to get circumsised . 
  the difference is a person getting a plastic surgery he asked for vs a person being forced to have a plastic surgery, 
  nobody intends to give the decision to kids . 
  the point i 'm trying to make is , let grown-ups choose what to do with their bodies . 
  eating vegetables , going to school , vaccination , etc. 
  are necessary for kids at the time , while circumcision wo n't be necessary for a very long time . 
  besides , you are appealing to the extreme , which is a logical fallacy . 
  i looked it up , and who knew , you 're right . 
  turns out circumcision helps prevent hiv . 
  you know what else i found ? 
  absolutely no mention that doing the surgery to an adult has any more risks . 
  there are circumcission programmes in places with hiv epidemics , and none of them target infants , they go for the 18-20 year-olds . 
  so why are we doing this to babies again ? 
  excelent answer , but ... 
   follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer . 
  because they know what kind of battery they used , and therefore how best to treat it . 
  sounds silly , but no they do n't . 
  i have seen lots of devices using lithium ion batteries with manuals saying it 's critical to fully discharge before charging . 
  they started giving these warnings back in the day when nicad was the norm , and for some weird reason decided to keep them there . 
  there probably is , but i do n't see much point . 
  you have an immune system , let it do its thing . 
  experts say that sterilising stuff around you will not only weaken said system , so you 'll become more susceptible to disease , but also cause allergies . 
  seriously , germs are everywhere . 
  and it 's ok . 
  well , he 's right . 
  the whole emission trading thing is total bullshit that does n't decrease emissions at all . 
  well , the bot is technically correct . 
  `` hodor '' is not an english word :, 
  i do n't know , but my guess is that the person writing the manual is some student working for minimum wage , who either does n't know , does n't give a crap , or both . 
  what help would that be ? 
  in a situation like that the best thing you can possibly do is wait for the paramedics while staying away and not touching him . 
  good point , but that would require some crazy reflexes, 
  a common misconcption . 
  so common in fact , that some not-very-smart people even make explanation videos with it . 
  your explanation is n't too simple , it 's just wrong . 
  at one point a dude with an epic beard jumps out of a bottomless pit while pulling a demon by his whip, 
  the 30 %, 
   i do n't know how it works , but i 'm sure it 's not as good as mpc . 
  there 's your problem . 
  you 're `` sure '' , even though you do n't know . 
  i use vlc because it has sreaming . 
  other than that , i 'm pretty sure they 're the same . 
  codec packs ? 
  check . 
  customisable ? 
  check . 
  subtitle/audio track customisability ? 
  check . 
  truth is , these days there are very * very * few examples of one software being superior to another , and it mostly comes down to what you are used to . 
  hell , i mentioned streaming as a pro for vlc , but i would n't be surprised at all if mpc already has that feature too . 
  if you prefer mpc , that 's fine and there 's no reason to switch to vlc , just as there would be no reason to switch from vlc to mpc . 
  whatever floats your boat . 
  oh , and `` annoying bright orange logo '' ? 
  that 's textbook nitpicking . 
  read the damn sidebar, 
  natural selection, 
  looks like everything went according to plan . 
  well , they could gave gone with a lower barrel , for impact on the 3rd guy 's balls instead of just crushing . 
  the flowing water should serve as a hint, 
  `` oooooooooooooooo ^ o ^ ^ o ^ ^ ^ o '',
