  `` when the sun rises in the west and sets in the east , '' said mirri maz duur . 
  `` when the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves . 
  when your womb quickens again , and you bear a living child . 
  then he will return , and not before . '', 
  she totally did say that . 
  does n't really prove anything though , she might have been lying just to mess with her head ( hey , it worked . 
  big time . ), 
  that right there is an easy 6-0 win, 
  you could debate if she really meant it , or if she was just making it up , but it 's pretty damn clear what she meant . 
  do n't forget the context in which those word were said . 
  this was n't a clue to dany , because helping dany was the last thing mirri wanted to do at that point ; this whole `` prophecy '' was nothing but an elaborate way to say `` fuck you . '', 
  at first you talk to them like you 're going to give some awesome advice , and then once they 're listening closely you just, 
   if someone is truly guilty of committing heinous crimes against humanity that torture is an effective and morally justifiable way of gaining information, 
  well that 's the thing : it 's not effective , not even a little bit, 
  ** character a : ** yeah ... sure ... 
  i 'll give you what you want any day now , character b. 
  why do n't you go fuck yourself ... 
  ** r/asoiaf : ** omg guys , it 's a prophecy , character b will be cloned and have sex with it 's clone , and after that they will get what they want !, 
  edit : i hate reddit 's formatting sometimes, 
  edit2 : nailed it , kinda, 
  if he 's constantly busy sucking dicks , that 's a pretty good sign, 
  because right now they 're carefully limiting their catching per trip to make sure they do n't make too much money . 
  figuring it out by yourself is much more fun than being told . 
  does n't `` scratching '' mean pretty much the same thing ? 
   honestly i do n't think there are any real signs . 
  so gay people act totally `` normal '' some straight dudes act totally `` gay '', 
  obviously . 
  which is exactly why this :, 
   wow every comments so far `` if he 's obviously gay , he might be gay '', 
  happened, 
  ask anyone who cleans them ( or used to ) for a living . 
  men 's bathrooms look cleaner than operating rooms when compared to women 's, 
  because when you 're a kid , that shit is fun, 
  source : i 've been a kid, 
  that ... has nothing to do with the question op asked, 
  well , not literally * nothing * , since they both have something to do with hair . 
  but yeah . 
  i think it was n't , because that would 've been very very stupid on their part . 
  the government blowing up the towers sounds like something a group of b-movie villains would do . 
  there are far quicker , cheaper , easier and less risky ways to justify a war . 
  well , here 's my favorite cat gif for ya : http://i.imgur.com/fwfxs16.gif, 
  as you probably know , reddit is mostly populated by nerdy people in their early 20 's , and that group of people has a lot new atheists , i.e. 
  people who have been brought up religiously , but recently stopped believing . 
  i 've been in that exact situation , and trust me , it 's not easy . 
  waking up one day and realising that nearly every authority figure you 've ever had has been feeding you bullshit since day one ( i now know that is not what really happened , but that 's how you see it at first ) can be really rough . 
  as a result , almost every new atheist goes through this phase when they 're just , to put it mildly , angry . 
  religion becomes the reason behind every bad thing everywhere , and a villain to be defeated at any cost . 
  half euro , half korean . 
  25-30 years old . 
  it 's about as far off as other movies based on fictional events, 
  tommorow 's headline : obama deploys 100 thousand marines , two aircraft carriers to deal with education and health care issues . 
  yeah , that 's not how it works, 
   your funding is getting cut . 
  usa defence spending ( billions ) :, 
   fact : nato ~ ~ expanded a lot in eastern europe ~ ~ allowed some eastern european nations to join them 10 years after they started begging for it after the cold war and planned missile bases there . 
   fact : nato violated serbia/yugoslavia 's territorial integrity in the late 90 's and supported kosovo 's independence after voting for a un resolution that explicitly recognized the territorial integrity of yugoslavia ( with kosovo being part of yugoslavia and then serbia as the successor state ), 
   fact : nato then recognized kosovo 's independence referendum even thou serbia ( the successor to yugoslavia ) did not recognize or authorize the referendum . 
   fact : the icc said that what nato did was fine because self-determination does not require the claiming state ( in this case serbia ) to consent to a referendum . 
   ~ ~ fact ~ ~ mostly bullshit : the democratically elected government in ukraine was overthrown illegally by a rebellion that was supported by multiple nato countries , but not all of ukraine . 
   ~ ~ fact ~ ~ 100 % bullshit : the people of crimea held a referendum saying they wanted to be part of russia and overwhelmingly voted in favor of joining russia . 
  the exact same process that the icc said was legal for kosovo . 
  ftfy, 
   your word has no integrity from this point forward . 
  oh noes , my integrity !, 
  :( anyway ... 
  second to last is mostly bullshit , because every single revolution ever was illegal , that 's kinda the whole point of a revolution . 
  there have been elections since , and their results support the new government . 
  the last one ... seriously ? 
  fucking seriously ? 
  hmmm , let 's see ... how about the fact that this `` referendum '' was asking people if they want to join another country , while soldiers from that other country were staring at them with assault rifles in hand ? 
  or the fact that the question was `` would you like to join russia now , or a couple of months later '' , while `` everything is ok , i do n't want changes '' literally was not an option ? 
  honestly , i feel like i 'm explaining someone that the sky is , in fact , blue , while they stare at me like i 'm an idiot . 
  if you think this `` referendum '' deserves anything else than ignoring it , then your word has no integrity from this point forward . 
  yeah , sure , `` boxing ring for workouts '', 
  well , no , not obviously . 
  `` porn '' in subreddit names does n't mean anything, 
  well done !, 
  you can use your mouse to look around the world and aim your weapons or spells . 
  try this now . 
   czechoslovakia , whose people are czechs . 
  it would be funny to see a 100-post long discussion between him and / u/yourjokeexplained, 
  buzzfeed : the movie, 
  i do n't think inflation is what we should comapre the increase to . 
  these people do n't hold cash , they hold stock . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.yardeni.com/pub/peacockglstkytd.pdf ) , in 2014 the stock market 's value increased 2.9 % globally . 
  they got worse results than a random number generator would likely get . 
  that 's the clock i would get if i had the money to fuck around all day , every day . 
  google works for reddit , too, 
  1 euro coin . 
  it would probably be easier to murder without it . 
  umm ... 
  it 's in south america , it 's long and it has mountains, 
  what i 'm trying to say is , not much, 
  no need to be a dick about it, 
  no , but i think future me might be screwed over by present me, 
  well , different people might have different ideas about what 's fun , but in my experience the best roads trips are made by a complete lack of planning and being fucking insane . 
  why would you wear pants in the shower ? 
  that ... actually makes sense, 
  the price of overnight shipping would increase until the amount of people able to afford it would be roughly the same as the amount of people currently buying it, 
  i love it when people answer their own questions,
