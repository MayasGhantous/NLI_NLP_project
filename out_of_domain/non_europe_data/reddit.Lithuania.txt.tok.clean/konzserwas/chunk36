  ok , so they can measure a year , but why would they care ? 
  season cycles aside , there 's no reason for a year to be a culturally significant amount of time . 
  they 're all nsaids with slight differences in how strongly they affect pain/fever/inflamation . 
  aspirin is rarely used as a nsaid anymore , because it has worse side effects than the others and can be lethal to kids . 
  also , it does n't help blood clot , it does exactly the opposite by breaking down important chemicals inside platelets . 
  the dosage used for that is far smaller than what you 'd take for it to work as a nsaid . 
  well , technically possible . 
  people tend to severely overestimate the amount of calories excercise burns . 
  if she 's rewarding herself with a huge burger for every hour of activity , the result would be ... 
  pretty much what we see . 
  i 'm your cream , make you real, 
  i 'm your fries when you must steal, 
  i 'm your gainz when you ca n't feel, 
  sad but true, 
  100 is n't really a small sample . 
  unless you picked your 100 out of paralympics athletes , you would get a pretty accurate result . 
  you 're not being downvoted on principle , but mostly because people can see right through the pathetic and annoying attempt at reverse psychology that is `` lol i 'm gon na be so downvoted for this . '', 
  i 've been using one for 3.5 years now , literally no problems . 
  touchpad has everything you mentioned and works perfectly . 
  regarding no linux support and no physical buttons - it 's your own damn fault for not researching the product before buying it . 
  especially considering that linux support is n't really something you can expect to be in everything ; lots of hardware does n't have it , because the vast majority of customers do n't give a shit about it . 
  you do n't have a poorly designed product , you have a problem with your software . 
  and oh look , somebody already gave you a solution : http://www.reddit.com/r/crappydesign/comments/2xh562/this_ergonomic_mouse_found_on_amazon/cp0k9a3, 
  this should be stickied, 
  it was the single most accurate portrayal of a suicide on tv , ever . 
  that * is * how it really happens , there is no warning . 
  depends on whether you take paper or plastic . 
  [ nah , i have to carry it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tomr4ar.png ), 
  your vaginas are possible to look at without utilising [ one of these ] ( http://www.hu-friedy.com/products/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/800x800/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/s/r/sr1_h1_rgb.jpg ), 
  sure , let 's ban rt along with all media owned by the us government, 
  wait ... 
  it 's true though . 
  most atheists tolerate religion and do n't make such comments for one reason : pointing out retards has serious social consequences when the majority of people are retards . 
  with an attitude like that you 're more likely to eventually become like him . 
  there 's no `` duh it 's common sense '' in science , research has to be done . 
  and it 's not the kind of research that could be done by a 3rd semester student who ca n't spell his field . 
  intelligence is n't linear . 
  there are plenty of people who are geniuses and idiots at the same time . 
  this is not from 2015 though, 
  the whole concept of gastric band is a classic example of retarded fatlogic . 
  `` my weight is due to genetics , it just ca n't be fixed through diet and excersise . 
  i will fix it by having a surgery which does nothing but force me to eat less . '', 
  if it could potentially be misused , you have to assume it will be . 
  how the fuck is a `` fast '' or `` slow '' metabolism supposed to work , anyway ? 
  ever heard of the first law of thermodynamics ? 
  yeah , it 's not even close . 
  the average dude burns close to 2000 calories a day without any physical activity ; 1200 is just a bit over my usual biggest meal of the day . 
  but something tells me he wo n't be skipping his biggest meal of the day due to drinking that bottle . 
  the way i see it , tesla is currently the only option that exists , because all other evs have the range of a wind-up toy car . 
  i 'm not buying a car that can barely make it half-way to the next city . 
  i believe he was trying to start one of [ these ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2xkfjf/my_friend_moved_to_tokyo_and_is_working_80_hours/cp12r2k ) , but it did n't work out, 
  good question , wrong subreddit, 
  rule 3 :, 
   askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions . 
  technically a criminal, 
  well , to be fair , if i knew somebody who never brushed their teeth for 20 years , and then one day started to do it , a pat on the back would be in order . 
  along with a reminder that flossing 's important too , if you get what i mean . 
  eh , i 'm usually the one saying `` but she/he 's tryiiiing give them crediiitttt , '' but this fatass ai n't trying . 
  but you ca n't have the bacon , because heart disease, 
  [ if only there was another way ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gr%c5%abtas_park ), 
  exactly . 
  and the hole will probably be filled by sansa , because that results in something fans of the show really love - a fight between littlefinger and varys, 
  ok , you seem to have no idea what 's going on here . 
  allow me to explain : all the people who are downvoting you and replying to you strongly suspect that you pulled the amount ( `` half '' ) out of your ass . 
  they are now expecting some kind of evidence for your claim . 
  but instead of providing it , you just repeat the same claim in a different wording ( still with zero evidence ) and pull two additional numbers out of your ass ( 80 % and 1/4 ), 
  what 's with the `` most '' and `` unless ? '', 
  there are two major forms of uids ( you named both of them ) . 
  they both have their ups and downs , none is clearly better and both are easily available . 
  nothing . 
  call me an asshole , but there is not a single thing in this world i 'm willing to die for . 
  `` let 's send in a report saying it 's sexualising minors , that will show them ! '', 
  could someone try and rap this ? 
   infertility , < ...  preeclampsia , low sperm count , poor sperm motility, 
  i do n't see how any of these could possibly be a problem for a fatso, 
  step 1 : do n't be an idiot, 
  step 2 : not being an idiot , crop your face out of the pic, 
  step 3 : no problems, 
  good . 
  having a long list of soldiers who stand with the people sounds like the perfect deterrent . 
  in this regard , no , it is not . 
  oldschool runescape has pay-to-win microtransactions . 
  there was a poll , ~ 85 % voted yes .

  wait ... 
  damn sims 4 , they can get out without ladders now . 
  when you add the cost of building a wall around the pool , killing seems to be a luxury :(, 
  this is not membership . 
  it 's a token for membership , which you can buy with cash and then sell to other players for in-game money . 
  there 's absolutely no reason to recreate the complicated genealogy presented in the books . 
  `` this dude is harry . 
  when normal people boycott something , they generally stop using the product instead of starting to steal it, 
  are n't they more like a nation ? 
  actually , the standard international date format is 2015-04-22 ... so ... it 's actually 4/22, 
  probably because most brigades come with a complementary doxx attempt . 
  ... no it is n't . 
  yes , i am aware of the illogical american format . 
  but your suggestion of `` 22/04 '' makes no goddamn sense in either yyyy-mm-dd or mm-dd-yyyy , as both of them have `` mm-dd '' in them .
