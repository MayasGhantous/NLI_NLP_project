  i am sure we both do in our own ways . 
  i am guessing both of us could even prove it if needed ;-), 
  i will look into picking some more moderators . 
  thank you for your interest . 
  i am sorry , i disappointed you . 
  we do n't need no education ... 
  imho [ curonian spit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/curonian_spit ) is the most beautiful place in lithuania . 
  apart from that there are some breathtaking views here and there . 
  one of my favorites is on a road i take quite often :, 
  looks similar to this :, 
  kayaking on lithuanian rivers is also quite popular . 
  check : https://duckduckgo.com/?q=kayaking+lithuania, 
  i play a couple of times a week . 
  i avoid the servers with many players and connect to ones with 1-4 players to frag some noobs or get into an informal duel . 
  i like the collect mode although i rarely see anyone playing it . 
  so i mostly stick to other insta modes ( except protect ) . 
  yes you is n't . 
  no you is . 
  is you why ? 
  it may not seem a thing from the polish side , but here in lithuania the issue is quite important . 
  the polish minority in lithuania is much bigger than the german minority in silesia ( e.g. 
  [ one of the ministers ] ( http://www.enmin.lt/en/contacts/ministras/ ) in the current cabinet is from the [ polish political party ] ( http://www.awpl.lt/index.php?lang=pl ) ) . 
  there is also quite a [ complex history ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poles_in_lithuania#in_independent_lithuania ) leading to this in modern lithuania . 
  the situation is that there was a quiet and friendly period between the states and nations in lithuania for some time . 
  then , in the past couple of years political rhetoric and action from nationalists on both sides reached unhealthy levels . 
  thus this initiative to stop radicalism from going too far and spread some love :-), 
  * with \u2764 from vilnius ( wilno ) . 
  are there any live streams like from kyiv ? 
  kneel your self , you lair !,

  a handful of christians ( incl . 
  3 orthodox priests ) stood between the two fighting sides all night yesterday , praying for peace . 
  they were finally scared off in the morning by a misguided explosive projectile nearly hitting them . 
  greetings and prayers from vilnius , lithuania !, 
  my heart is with ukrainian people . 
  i probably spent more time watching live streams from kyiv than reading my local news during the last couple of days . 
  i wish you restore peace , justice and democracy in your home as soon as possible . 
  they faced both sides . 
  the current government lead by president viktor yanukovich decided to turn the overall direction from european union towards russia . 
  pro-european people went to a peaceful protest . 
  the government tried to break the protest by force . 
  they failed . 
  this happened in november-december . 
  then on january 16 , while the protests were actually losing their momentum , the government passed a number of laws criminalizing protests and other peaceful gatherings . 
  the protesters got agitated again and radical groups went to fight with special police units at hrushevskoho street . 
  there are now 3-5 people dead , hundreds injured and probably more violence awaits as there is an ultimatum from the protesters , but the government refuses to listen and may be mobilizing more troops . 
  see : [ euromaidan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euromaidan ) , [ 2014 hrushevskoho street riots ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_hrushevskoho_street_riots ) . 
  may be ukrstream.tv, 
  message from the moderator : i will now delete all posts and ban all users who post about us/russia behavior in the world in general . 
  if the user is not lithuanian . 
  they are completely off-topic . 
   `` and you are lynching negroes '' ( russian : \u0410 \u0443 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u043b\u0438\u043d\u0447\u0443\u044e\u0442 , `` but at your place negroes are being lynched '' ) is an anecdotal counter-argument phrase , which epitomizes the tu quoque arguments used by the soviet union in response to allegations that it had violated human rights . 
  the phrase refers to the racial discrimination and lynching in the united states .

  not a single mention of ** altgr ** ?? 
  i am disappoint . 
  put cursor into a text entry box , hold ** right alt ** key and then type in letters or numbers . 
  this . 
  i do n't have problems with ` this ` . 
  i understand it quite well . 
  it is just my least favorite thing about javascript . 
  now imagine how you would feel if you worked with es6 stuff back in 2009 ... 
  classes will probably replace ` this ` as my least favorite thing and may end javascript for me . 
  i do n't need any maintenance of ` this ` , because i nearly never use it . 
  i use a subset of the language that utilizes the power of scoping rules and functional programming features . 
  adding classes will probably push this mildly unpopular way of programming in javascript to the fringes . 
  i think javascript has also a problem of too many features/paradigms . 
  due to the language being forced on everyone working with the web , different developers choose different , sometimes incompatible subsets : good-parts , bad-parts , magic-parts , parts-i-read-on-some-blog , parts-i 'm - an-enterprise-blub-developer-and-where-are-my-classes . 
  adding more features/paradigms may add even more confusion . 
  i 'm curious : i guess you were writing js code with es6 features back then . 
  what were you running it on ? 
  i doubt it was rhino / [ ringojs ] ( http://ringojs.org/ ) . 
  five year plan in 4 years , comrade !, 
  a bunch of java `` geniuses '' decided they need to show these lousy scripters how it should be done ... would be fun to watch if they did n't have the mass of that brand behind them . 
  well they are known for embracing , monopolizing and extinguishing rss . 
  i meant it should log the arguments and pass them on . 
  it should behave similar to this :, 
  function betterlog ( ) {, 
  console.log.apply ( console , arguments ) ;, 
  return arguments [ 0 ] ;, 
  not good enough . 
  still relies on context and does n't help in the second and third examples . 
  yeah , right ... 
  one of the reasons i wrote my post is that i am so sick of typing ` console.log.bind ( console ) ` every time i need to pass a logger to some function i getting familiar with or testing . 
  imho javascript is not haskell or clojure .
