  yes . 
  that weird mixed reaction of laughter and disgust at that transition . 
  have you really tried ? 
  or did you not label it as an abstract art book ? 
  cause i think someone would manage to squeeze some money out of book like that . 
  it 's just their mating season . 
  why the hell would i shoot the victim ? 
  it was not new when surface came out too . . 
  instincts are usually cold blooded . 
  it might be an android as far as we know it , do n't be machinist . 
  well he is 41 . . 
  i am not sure wtf do you mean by this meme . . 
  why do you judge him when you do n't know him ? 
  so what does angry cab driver got to do with anything ? 
  shame !, 
  yea , that idea was pretty nuts . 
  you are literally worst than him , who is hitler . 
  that describes pretty much every leader of most countries . 
  come one , everyone here are polite and thinks trough everything they read . 
  i would expect living in rural sweedish city/town after enduring war torn country would something a person would love . 
  but no , these beggar-migrants are never satisfied . 
  is it at least good read ? 
  are n't they dumped into refugee camps in most places ? 
  it 's not like they are citizens of that country and can easily find legal job in a city or not . 
  transitioning takes quite a bit of time and the process can be done wherever . 
  the problem is the scale of the problem and not the migration itself . 
  you cant really expect those historical methods to work , especially when we are talking about european countries and not us . 
  we are getting ~ 10 times more refugees than us and we need to fit them in a more densely populated region . 
  discussing the situation without knowledge about it is pretty weird thing to do . . 
  even if we take only germany , it already takes way more refugees than us . 
  could you post statistics/source on your claims where i could confirm your claims ? 
  and remember we are talking about refugees and not normal legal immigrants . 
  and how current us refugee policies are even comparable to those influxes ? 
  ok lets take irish potato famine , most sources state it had influx of 1-2 million people during 5 years period ( some state ~ 250k/year ) . 
  scotland figures are quite unclear but they seem to be 5 to 10 times lower . 
  we again need to remember that we are comparing us to europe , and completely different time periods . 
  it 's like comparing apples to swarms of bees . 
  it 's to indicate the confusion . 
  could he be cool with chaplin stashe ? 
  i can nazi how that would make a difference . 
  sweet jesus !, 
  well i do n't know how to feel after laughing from that . . 
  yea . . 
  i imagine a brain surgery included in buying an mmo . . 
  only in lithuania ... 
  especially when porn is illegal here . . 
  tagged as stu pid . 
  probably definitely . 
  maybe op is some pr guy and staged this photo for promotion ? 
  / r/hailcorporate, 
  there is a difference between normal migrants and refugees complaining . . 
  getting gold is usually pretty random , i have 3 gilded comments with less than 20 votes . 
  ( well one does not count since it was a game to guess how many beans are there in a jar and i was off by 1 bean ), 
  no that 's only one factor in which they are different out of several . . 
  if they come , work and pay taxes , they have as much right to complain as locals . 
  just because you have not born in the country does not mean you have no rights to complain in order to improve your situation . 
  well it would not be so popular if it was not fun . 
  i would argue that it is fun for target demographic . . 
  just because your family lived there for 7 generations does not make you in any way more valuable to that country . 
  in fact migrants are usually arguably more important work force economically . 
  and your logic would make sense if humans were plants and not animals who migrate.and i never said about deporting anyone ... 
  i was only saying that persons right to complain and express their opinion has nothing to do with how long his family lived in that country . 
  at least they seem to be ok . or else this would be on / r/watchpeopledie, 
  how can you brag about something what most people see as very stupid idea . 
  and tentacle porn , probably the most culturally important product which enriched our lives tremendously . 
  it probably happened few times already . 
  there were countless memes similar to this . 
  that 's what a lot of people already living in those countries also want and are hardly getting . 
  just because people have one opinion or another does not mean they follow hive-mind . . 
  when you have to choose 1 out of 2 , both groups will be relatively big , especially when discussing something subjective . 
  this trick is called pumpkin smashed-my-face latte . 
  time to invest into creating swarms of robotic bees to pollinate everything . ^ ^ ^ ^ totally ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ take ^ ^ ^ ^ over ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ world, 
  is n't that pretty much definition of reddit ? 
  damn i even forgot they had those in that movie . 
  one of those movies which you loved as a kid and when you watch as an adult realize how bad it was . 
  it will end nicely , trust me , if i have complete control over them we will all benefit . 
  i can even swear on a bible . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ ^ agnostic ^ ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ ^ anything, 
  damn that 3 overtime match on season . . 
  use smoke signals . 
  she only agreed to marry if she can keep depp . 
  how much of those 100mil were for advertisement ? 
  i think my ears started bleeding . . 
  maybe op is crazy himself , we ca n't know that . 
  music does not give him credit too . 
  so you call him incapable of critical thinking , but you yourself deem other opinions as foolish ? 
  self driving bike . 
  delivering pizza to you in 10 years . 
  paint job cost 100 times more than the car . 
  jobs are cheap in romania it seems . 
  shut up you bastard , being fanboy is always better than not being fanboy . 
  being fanboy of being fanboy is probably most existentially important thing !, 
  this situation is pretty much lose-lose . 
  do not let them in and you will be racist nazi , let them in and extremists and other unwanted people who would contribute nothing to the nation will slip through with refugees . 
  ugh i am missing something , what happened ? 
  i thought it was a car , but ok . 
  well my country ( lithuania ) should not get a lot of refugees ( not to mention that those who would be assigned would not want to stay here probably ) so this might not cause problems , and i am all for letting small number of people who are willing to live here to come . 
  but in places like germany or hungary or w/e other rich country the situation is far worse . 
  still the price ratio would stand i guess . 
  ( i am not a car guy but i guess it would still cost a bit to buy , fit and apply the vinyl ? ),
