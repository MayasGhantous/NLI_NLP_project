  i personalty am thinking of making a base underwater in the ocean , make it look like some kind of research facility . 
  so non of my friends have terraria nor they like the gametype , so i was wondering if there are some people wanting to start 1.2 together ( we would kinda schedule the time according to when you are available ) . 
  so im very confused with the skill tree so i was wondering if some1 could give me some guidelines on my build , currently i have http://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree/aaaaagiaadekpsu_lolkfvb6wz1nohrbfxwhqyd2oskiqktcp9svp6_rtbq34rvjxkltftqn3bxddell73r0-paj_mx-uv7i, 
  so ive reached level60 and im now a bit confused where should i go next on my passive tree , my build is roa + frenzy ( dont plan on going for ci ), 
  my current skill tree :, 
  so im now at level 69 and i should start mapping but the problem is i cant , i keep getting owned in most of them , i almost finished one but ran out of flasks at boss and had only 1 portal left . 
  so there must be a problem with my build :, 
  im willing to switch out from roa if something else fits this build , any suggestions what i should do ? 
  of course gear also is a problem , but my guess is that build is causing more of the deaths . 
  so due to the recent news from us about the new `` trend game '' it got me wondering , what processes happen in your brain ( or body overall ) when you get knocked out ? 
  so is there a better way than using dropbox ? 
  ( sorry , studying for `` final '' ( its called a bit different ) and its 2am so im too tired to look if this was posted . ), 
  hi mates , could you suggest me some good books which has time travel in it ? 
  would like few suggestions as i 've read some but do n't remember any names to provide a list . 
  so im thinking about coming back after few months , any major changes i should expect ? 
  is it worth starting nemesis now as there is almost no time before wipe ? 
  so ive been playing civ5 for some time ( since bnw came out ) and i can beat king most of the times ( unless i try something funny ) . 
  but on emperor i kinda hit a wall and cant seem to progress . 
  is there a good source of material to read/watch to improve my play ? 
  as a title says , what you guys think about bee keeping being a part of game ? 
  it probably should be something you can get only from merchant and it could provide several resources . 
  i would make it myself but im only starting on c++ and im not even talking about how terrible are my art capabilities . 
  hello , so as title states i never played witch and want to start her in new sc league , so i was wondering what are the most important things i should know ? 
  i 'm not looking for build , i want to do that myself , but still , i do n't want to go in blind , as i have no idea about spellcasters . 
  for example is ci important for them or can i just get some es without going for ci , and other basic tips like that related to mage would be helpful . 
  so i got bored on my fb witch ( kinda hit a wall because of eq ) and im thinking of starting an alt , but i cant seem to locate a guide on how to level them efficiently ( what quests are worth skipping and etc ) . 
  * what will you be doing with this pc ? 
  be as specific as possible , and include specific games or programs you will be using . 
  mostly i 'm going to use it for gaming ( want to go through witcher series and my oldie is actually pretty much incapable in running it , other games includes cs : go , random indie games , minecraft , batman series and i guess whatever comes up new ) . 
  i might do statistical computation on it but i doubt i would use personal computer for it . 
  might start streaming , but that 's just a possibility so no need to tinker build for it . 
  * what is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes ? 
  my budget is 700-750 eur , 800 is a push and would require a non-linear increase in performance . 
  * when do you plan on building/buying the pc ? 
  pretty much this month/start of next, 
  * what , exactly , do you need included in the budget ? 
  ( tower/os/monitor / keyboard/mouse/etc ), 
  got monitor , mouse , keyboard and os already , so i need the box and parts . 
  * which country ( and state/province ) will you be purchasing the parts in ? 
  if you 're in us , do you have access to a microcenter location ? 
  im in lithuania so i need whoever sends parts here . 
  ( i could include few websites if its necessary , not sure if they have english though . 
  * if reusing any parts ( including monitor ( s ) / keyboard/mouse/etc ) , what parts will you be reusing ? 
  brands and models are appreciated . 
  got cheap logitech k120 keyboard , a4tech oscar x760 mouse ( also pretty cheap ) , and lg flatron m2094d monitor ( is a bit old and i would change it once i save up after buying pc ), 
  * will you be overclocking ? 
  if yes , are you interested in overclocking right away , or down the line ? 
  cpu and/or gpu ? 
  i doubt i would risk it . 
  * are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build ? 
  ( ex : ssd , large amount of storage or a raid setup , cuda or opencl support , etc ), 
  i 'm not too knowledgeable on the hardware , so i do n't have any preferences in that , though i think ssd is necessary these days ? 
  * do you have any specific case preferences ( size like itx/microatx/mid-tower / full-tower , styles , colors , window or not , led lighting , etc ) , or a particular color theme preference for the components ? 
  green lighting would be cool , also see-through case sounds fun if it does n't have any drawbacks ( these only if it not pushes the price and hinders the performance budget ), 
  * do you need a copy of windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget ? 
  if you do need one included , do you have a preference for one or the other ? 
  nope , im pretty sure as a student i can get win for free as my uni has that option . 
  * extra info if required :, 
  it would be great if it could be upgradeable as i 'm going to start getting decent income at end of the year , also some info on why build is the way you suggested could help me get into the hardware learning phase better . 
  if you need more info feel free to ask , im open to a longer discussion if someone is willing to help not-so-tech savy person on his pretty much first build .

  i will mainly use it for gaming and will upgrade once i can , i could put somewhat 20 euros more but this is close to my limit in price . 
  got monitor , os , keyboard , mouse , and speakers . 
  so got any suggestions to how improve , is something missing ? 
  i live in lithuania so shipping from most of usual places is a bit pricy so im going to get most of my parts from http://www.electronics.balticmart.eu/index.php?page=products_catalog&hl=en_us . 
  feel free to ask anything i might have left out .

  so first of all i still haven chosen the psu ( im looking into it but its harder as the shops im buying doesnt have xfx ) , and the motherboard is a bit on the fence ( suggest me if there is better option for similar/lower price , i think i might not need the 4xram slots as i wount be able to use all 32gigs anyway ) . 
  chose r9 280x instead of 770 because of price and relatively similar performance with r9 having potential with its magic thingy and all consoles running radeon , i might change to 770 depending on what deals i might get in the shops ill look , so keep in mind it might be either . 
  memory is pretty much price picked ( im not entirely sure thats the same one im getting but the main stats are the same ) . 
  case seems to have good reviews , and look ok . 
  so any tweaks , suggestions ? 
  my first time build . 
  already had a help post but made some tweaks and etc so figured its best to create new one .
