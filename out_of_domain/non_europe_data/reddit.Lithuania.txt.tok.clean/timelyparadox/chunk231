  any final thoughts ? 
  will everything i listed work well together and fit ? 
  edit : something to wrong with formating , im on work pc so idk what happened . . 
  prices are for german retailers , but thats just so that it would be in euros and have similar pricings . 
  im in lithuania so i would be ordering from local places . 
  so im about to get my new pc and it has r9 card , so if everything is ok with my seller i can chose 3 free games from amd list . 
  my first choice will be thief ( i really enjoyed the setting behind it and its world , also never tried thieving game so im curious ) . 
  for my 2nd pick i was thinking about murder : soul suspect , but its not yet released and hard to tell if its going to be any good . 
  another game im considering is deux ex : hr dirrectors cut , but im not sure about it . 
  as for the indies from the list i only liked banner saga so no point in choosing any of those bundles . 
  so anyone could suggest what other games in the list is good/worth to look into ? 
  i usually play rpg ( enjoyed me series , dragon age origins , skyrim , gw2 ... ) , but im not limited to it if the game has good story . 
  also game which would show ability of my 280x could also be a benefit . 
  so any suggestions ? 
  ok ive got my new parts and there seems to be a problem with standoff hole placement . 
  my mobo is gigabyte b85m-d3h , and case is cooler master n300 . 
  6/7 standoffs from the motherboard alligns perfectly with placement on case but one ( middle right ) hole is way too far from where the standoff place on the case is . 
  help anyone ? 
  edit sorry i mean middle right hole *, 
  so thanks to my uni program i got free win 8.1 pro , but up untill now i was using 7 and when i got to my 8.1 im quite confused , so any tips where to start learning whats where ? 
  as title states , i finished the build and want to test if there would be any issues ( like cpu/gpu temps on load and things like that ) . 
  so i am considering buying skyrime legendary edition but ive got few questions . 
  i already bought the base game on launch day from local retailer and i think it might be ru region or smth , will everything be fine if i buy the legendary edition i see on steam store ? 
  does the dlc add a lot to the game ? 
  so ive been tinkering around with mods and basically added most of the suggested graphical mods from realvision enb , disabled the grass on steroids and tree ones but rest are there , might also disable the mod which makes everything darker . 
  added few fixes and the unofficial patches , also got achieve that and got a different start mod.but thats not why i 'm here . 
  i 've played a game for several hours again ( i 'm back to skyrim after 2 year break and now got all the dlcs ) so i was wondering , can i install mods and still have my savefile uncorrupted ? 
  i am thinking about getting the immersion mods from http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/1ikhrs/the_list_of_the_best_must_have_mods_for_skyrim/, 
  and appocalypse spells . 
  might also get immersive weapons/armors , bandolier , ufo . 
  is it possible to add all these mods and not lose my progression ? 
  so i recently started to mod my skyrim , atm i have 70 mods . 
  an from time to time ( once in 30mins or so ) my game freezes and i cant even stop it without restarting pc . 
  freezes happened during i was mining , fighting a wolf , brawling . .
