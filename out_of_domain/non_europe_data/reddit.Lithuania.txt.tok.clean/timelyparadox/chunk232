  what could be the problem ? 
  im not sure what other info to give so please ask away . 
  so i 've recently got a new pc and i always wanted to try out streaming/youtube , who knows i might be funny . 
  so here is my questions :, 
  my builg is radeon r9 280x ( twin frozr or w/e its spelled ) , i5 4570 ,8 gigs of ram . 
  my internet is fairly capable and enough for hd . 
  is this setup good enough for streaming ? 
  what kind of games could i stream ? 
  is the raptr program good or is there other free alternative of broadcast program ? 
  what other tips do you have for someone who never done this before ? 
   so recently i started reading the books and im half way through first one.i already watched the series and was thinking of re-watching it side by side , so i was wondering if there is some guide for doing that ( after what chapters i should watch the episode ) . 
  so i played gw2 at first for the first month after launch and then i quit . 
  i guessed i burned up because of the amount of time i put into the game , finished the game , was one of the earliest people in guild ( was in kaeyi guild ) to reach max , i did n't do dungeons though . 
  and now after all this time i 'm thinking of coming back into the game . 
  so what after all this time should i expect in the game ? 
  any grand changes ? 
  is wvw active ? 
  is finding people for dungeons hard ? 
  thanks for your time . 
  so for this season i decided that i need to get back to my roots and play a ranger , looking at the passive tree i decided that i would like to build physical damage based one . 
  im thinking of using roa + barrage but that can change since i have no idea if it would be good skills ( if i go with burning/lightning arrow am i forced to take ele dmg nodes ? ) . 
  i tried to keep go for acrobatics and spell dodge , then took some evasion nodes , then tried to have my life as close to 150 % as i could and also took life flask nodes because the flask buff makes it very useful . 
  and at the end just took attack speed and bow physical damage where i could . 
  so at the end i wonder if this build is any good or am i doing it wrong ? 
  bare in mind this is pretty much my first build as i always tend to copy and save time . 
  was not sure how to share the build so i just took a ss :,

  few weeks ago accidently installed windows on wrong disk , formatted and reinstalled on correct , now there are 2 windows on startup and one works another , as i stated , was on formatted disk , is there a way to get rid of it without compromising data on my pc ? 
  using windows 8.1 pro . 
  only 1 hdd just with separated sections . 
  hello , so my family friend asked to help choose 2 computers for 500 $ ( each ) one for his co-workers kid and one for himself as a backup . 
  they probably are ok being the same . 
  they would be use for general purpose like surfing internet/watching movies , maybe the kid will do some slight gaming , probably word and etc for some work . 
  main requirements are that it would have eng/ru keyboard ( where there are russian letters written next to latin ) and a numpad . 
  the region is lithuania , but because i guess not a lot of lithuanians are here just give some general options and ill try to find them out here myself . 
  budget is 500 $ for each laptop , give or take ( prices tend to differ out here , so laptop might be a bit more expensive here ) . 
  any questions you have i will try to answer as best as i can . 
  ok so i 've had an urge so i returned to do n't starve , i did n't play a lot of rog content ( died few times when it came out and then ran out of free time ) but now im back .
