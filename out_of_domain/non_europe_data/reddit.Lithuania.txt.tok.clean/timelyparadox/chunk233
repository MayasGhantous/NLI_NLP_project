  almost survived first winter but dc killed me ( a lot of mistakes were made ) , i was playing wx . 
  now i unlocked wigfrid and thought that she seems a character which i would enjoy . 
  so is she hard to play ( the whole being anti vegan and all ) , and what tips could you give to survive winter with her ? 
  ( i 'm playing with rog on ), 
  also , ( if i end up dying too much ) is there some decent way to make game a bit more forgiving , i want to fully explore content , but i do n't have a lot of free time to do too many playthroughs . 
  hello . 
  so i had little time to put towards skyrim for few months and had to stop . 
  but now i 'm back and i want to get into game . 
  problem is that i pretty much wiped anything about modding out of my head and now i 'm worried if i will mess up . 
  when i run my old mo ( everything was left intact ) , i get this messages :,

  so something drops an error . 
  same error if i check for updates . 
  help anyone ? 
  here is my load order http://modwat.ch/wizis , any errors there ? 
  i can run game and play around with it currently ( not sure if its safe to do ) , but i see bugs here and there so i need to update something . 
  also is windowed mode required or not , i forgot and cant find about it , i keep getting thrown to desktop after clicking wrong . 
  if i left out any information , please ask . 
  so i was excited that i going to buy borderlands 2 during this sale . 
  now that it came up i was surprised that base game is only -50 % and goty -67 % . 
  where every other person keeps saying its -75 % . 
  so i looked into it and it seems like we are getting russian discounts but european prices here in lithuania . 
  is this a new issue or something what has been happening often ? 
  i 'm not exactly sure if its against the rules to post it but its a very unusual bug which cant be exploited . 
  hello , so i got an used iphone 5 during christmas , never used any apple products so just trying to get the feel of it . 
  as i am gamer i was wondering , what are some good strategy and rpg games , preferably turn based ( free is obviously a benefit ) . 
  currently trying out clash of clans and it reminds me of good old travian days . 
  so i would be really interested in knowing if there is a spreadsheet with all crafting mat names available ( will format the prices and quantities myself so only need names ) , i was going to make one myself but then i realized that there must be something like that online . 
  i would prefer it to be a downloadable . csv of other format so that i could use it in my algorithms . 
  i figured it would save me quite a bit of time instead of locating and copying all the names one by one . 
  mostly interested in crafting mats . 
  sorry if i somehow missed it but i checked the sidebar and could n't find it . 
  i 've heard some bad things about last 2 seasons of the series , so i figured i would ask here , are they worth watching ? 
  how are series without mulder ? 
  well as the title states , is there a way to do that ? 
  i just started to feel like i 'm progressing too slowly , sure it 's a challenge , but it is also taxing on gameplay time . 
  hello , last year i built a new pc but because of budget constrains i kept my old monitor . 
  now i am considering getting a monitor so would like to get some suggestions since i am not that good at that . 
  i live in lithuania so prices might be higher for some products ( or could be lower , really random ) . 
  so please try to keep that in mind . 
  current pc has msi 280x and i5-4570, 
  i was looking at something like this, 
  i will mostly use it for gaming and watching movies + maybe doing some work ( programming on r ) . 
  my main wishes is that it would be decently sized ( 25 + inches , but am i willing to go lower if there are advantages in price/performance ), 
  full hd is probably enough, 
  higher frequency is better since i play a lot of csgo . 
  but it 's not a requirement . 
  and my budget mostly goes up to 300 euros . 
  getting korean one might be a bit problematic with taxes and stuff so i would prefer it to be regular brands . 
  currently i have lg m2094d which has tv tuner and it would be a perk to have on new one . 
  but that 's if it does not hinder other stuff . 
  if i missed some info , please feel free to ask . 
  hello ,, 
  so i had a break from skyrim for some time ( 3months + ) , but i still have it installed with all the mods . 
  so my question is , is it worth updating the mods ( probably there is risk of breaking the game ? ) . 
  i could provide mod list . 
  just not sure how to do it in mod organizer . 
  hello , it 's been quite a while since i played poe so i am having some trouble with creating my build . 
  i will be playing life based witch and using lightning ( ball of lightning most likely , might respec to cold at late game if i do n't like lightning ) . 
  have 60 points added , but struggling with where to go from now on . 
  probably should move towards shadow and get crit nodes , but not exactly sure what path to take . 
  and not sure if rest of my nodes are good enough . 
  this is for non-hardcore league . 
  [ removed ], 
  so my msi280x twin frazor makes screen flicker ( monitor goes black and back in a sec ) during low usage ( browsing ) and it happens less frequently when gaming . 
  does this mean my card is broken ? 
  if i missed any info feel free to ask , this started happening long time ago and i thought it was monitor fault ( had other real life problems so could n't do better troubleshooting ) , but recently i tried to connect monitor to onboard graphics and it stopped happening . 
  hello , so christmas are here and since my headset is broken i decided to get something good ( better than usual shitty headset ), 
  so i will be mainly gaming ( csgo ) , watching movies and listening to music so for these i would like to choose a decent headset ( with microphone ) . 
  my budged is about 50-75 euros and i live in lithuania so prices might be different here . 
  if i missed some info feel free to ask .
