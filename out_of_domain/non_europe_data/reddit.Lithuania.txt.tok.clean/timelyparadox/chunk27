  yep its unicorn blood . 
  that would be about ( 3.14159 ^ 4 ) mod 3, 
  tbh clothes are hard to draw , and its his sketches where he did n't put a lot of time ? 
  have same/similar heli , though there is not much room in apartment so it got banged up a bit and now i think its missbalanced : / . 
  but you never spilled tons of tea into the sea , you have still where to grow . 
  what is this , money for black people ? 
  ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ long ^ ^ ^ time ^ ^ ^ since ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ made ^ ^ ^ racist ^ ^ ^ joke, 
  those eyes !, 
  i guess he has worms ? 
  why the hell frame color is changing ? 
  i cant get used to controls on pc and got no controller , ugh . 
  not really , he didint get any gold . 
  sad that a lot of people dont know that . 
  aliens ... am i only one who hates such videos ? 
  but but op is trying to look stupid ... how can he think he is clever try to look stupid and be a moron ? 
  this is why we ca n't have nice things :( . 
  so seems like the article about articles having factual errors have factual error about the extent of the errors . 
  several years later http://l.yimg.com/ao/2011/news/september/mahantamarbhartiji190911_630.jpg, 
  still hanging . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ noticed ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ its ^ ^ ^ ^ wrong ^ ^ ^ ^ hand . . i ^ ^ ^ ^ only ^ ^ ^ ^ tried ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ ^ funny, 
  i was too tired to make it look more like a paradoxical statement . 
  was silv1 before reset ( dont know if preseason counts ) now silver v, 
  i got from bronze 1 to silver 1 in preseason , went 6-4 now and im back at silver v , happy ... 
  well then look at this guy ... http://www.lolking.net/summoner/euw/27052233 cant imagine what he feels . 
  good old bomberman ... 
  also the least voted post i see someone getting gold on . 
  ill be surprised if he is still alive . 
  ^ ^ ^ now ^ ^ ^ got ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ alive ^ ^ ^ song ^ ^ ^ stuck ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ head ... 
  im talking about post not comment . 
  might count , though you are a walrus so i ca n't trust you . 
  im thinking about reading books from where series ended , will i miss a lot by skipping first book , and 2nd if i end up putting it after the new series season . 
  as much as i do n't like referring to mythbusters for proof , this is pretty accurate . 
  im looking at my 30 + african clawed frogs younglings i raised , thinking why did i do that and what to do with them . 
  wikibot , what is sex ? 
  thanks , did n't think robots understand concept of sex . 
  knowing i just used wikibot to make a joke on til makes me sad for myself . 
  what a low apm scrub . 
  looking at the comments , cant decide why i lost hope in redditors , either because they are all trolls , or because they do n't know what mammals are . 
  i though orthodox do n't celebrate christmas as we do ? 
  your move poseidon !, 
  wouldnt it get cold faster ? 
  though im sure its different kind of glass . 
  its a bit skewed version of capitalism though . 
  pretty sure more than centuries , its relatively safe when done correctly so if a person has a good sentimental reason its all fine ( same as tatoos ) . 
  about what now ? 
  would n't call that a decent amount . 
  im pretty sure i saw this couple of times , but still ... 
  not really on this subreddit , though on particular gaming related one they are pretty bad . 
  never expected for mods on such sub to be bad . 
  well i would n't know about it if it were n't on frontpage . 
  i rarely browse / r/all . 
  best i can do http://imgur.com/vrk8x8w ( sorry for old version ) . 
  how about stop generalising everything down to americans , they are not a majority of users , though they would like to believe so . 
  ceramic surfices usually are good with retaining heat . 
  oh just cut it out guys ... 
  its that long ? 
  was thinking of watching first one but if its 3 hrs ... 
  confused , what is that creature ? 
  live action version of rodger ? 
  not really ? 
  overall it depends if you like google or not , ive been putting off moving to ff for some time , but i will eventually . 
  at first i thought it was dirt ... 
  he delayed his escape without getting too much risk , seems like ggg . 
  how many ships did they capture ? 
  they wouldnt rip it out , they would crush it to prevent you from moving when dragging you up into a tree . 
  sorry cant see what dinosaurs have to do with this pic . 
  im pretty sure its a part of zombie , and it seems it tried to bite you . 
  wouldnt flash just rip everyone apart with his speed force ? 
  why would he , flash would deal with it before the laser got to anyone . 
  because he wanted a reason to force the fight . 
  thats the evil flash . 
  if i blink fast enough i see it as static , i must see a doctor . 
  no , only 6 for whom he shed a tear . 
  exterminate !, 
  exterminate !, 
  the key word here is could , he is too rich to be deported , he pays too much taxes . 
  she still would n't absorb fast enough + speed force keeps a barrier around him , im not sure about it but i think rogue would need a direct contact . 
  so who is a pretty lady now ? 
  so based on 3 . it actually makes you more sleepy ? 
  after reading that lightning tore the finger of rio statue this makes sense . 
  did it stop when you found out your super powers ? 
  who needs a corkscrew , students these days are n't inventive . 
  its hard to tell if gravity even works while on speed force , he is faster than light . 
  where is the gif from ? 
  yep that sub covers this question well . 
  well you do n't see much russian posts here and as all op are fags its not hard to make the connection . 
  in reality there tend to be quite some news about homophobic attacks in russia even knowing most of them are muffled down by censors . 
  tbh i dont see random writings on walls as graffiti , though its covered in the definition . 
  where else will i put my dreams ? 
  well still , you could have a new friend ? 
  no he is not , flash is several times faster than light as he can tap into speed force , superman is no way close to that . 
  yea i forget to mention im talking about barry . 
  well i didint see it so . . and there are tons of ways of doing it . 
  there were ties but mostly because comics creators wanted superman to be the top dog so deliberately upped him . 
  i think there is a good blogpost where it covers the races and flash didint lose any of them , and had several wins after they stopped franchising superman . 
  in reality its too hard to tell as dc has so many alt universes and all post-crisis stuff so its all speculation based on more recent timelines . 
  depends if it counts for cameras . 
  well most flashes tend to like ladies very much , so she might try to seduce him , though there would still be no time . 
  gl with buying gas for that . 
  yea it takes some time to remember what country flag it is , names probably would take some effort off mind and make it more funny .
