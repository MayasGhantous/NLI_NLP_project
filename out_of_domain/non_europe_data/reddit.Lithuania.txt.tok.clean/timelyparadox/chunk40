  also ended up with cheaper hdd and went with ssd though this model seems to have negative reviews and im looking for different . 
  any thoughts on the changes ? 
  i dont , please help !, 
  this was so dumb and awful that i actually lol ` ed . 
  yea that much probably wouldnt be a problem, 
  is there a need for a dvd reader these days , or can i go by without it ( drivers and etc ) . 
  yea i might do the last bit , though im not sure what 770 model to chose as there are couple of them which say 770 gtx in [ here ] ( http://www.electronics.balticmart.eu/index.php?mact=products,cntnt01,do_search,0&amp;cntnt01returnid=56&amp;cntnt01returnid=56&amp;cntnt01searchfield=vga_chipset%2cvga_ram_technology%2cvga_ram_mb%2cwarranty_term%2cvga_ram_width_b%2cvga_ram_frequency_ghz%2cgpu_clock_mhz%2cmulti_gpu_technology%2cavailability%2cvendor_name%2chdmi_port_nb&amp;cntnt01pagelimit=15&amp;cntnt01search_hierarchy_recursively=1&amp;cntnt01cd_allany=0&amp;cntnt01hierarchy=942&amp;cntnt01cd_prodname=geforce%20770%20gtx&amp;cntnt01cd_submit=search&amp;cntnt01cd_prodprice=&amp;cntnt01pagenum=1 ) . 
  and some people warned me about having relatively low 550w supply . 
  what if i after all , instead of ssd put the money towards 770gtx and get ssd later , which one of [ these ] ( http://www.electronics.balticmart.eu/index.php?mact=products,cntnt01,do_search,0&amp;cntnt01returnid=56&amp;cntnt01returnid=56&amp;cntnt01searchfield=vga_chipset%2cvga_ram_technology%2cvga_ram_mb%2cwarranty_term%2cvga_ram_width_b%2cvga_ram_frequency_ghz%2cgpu_clock_mhz%2cmulti_gpu_technology%2cavailability%2cvendor_name%2chdmi_port_nb&amp;cntnt01pagelimit=15&amp;cntnt01search_hierarchy_recursively=1&amp;cntnt01cd_allany=0&amp;cntnt01hierarchy=942&amp;cntnt01cd_prodname=geforce%20770%20gtx&amp;cntnt01cd_submit=search&amp;cntnt01cd_prodprice=&amp;cntnt01pagenum=1 ) i should get , all these different 770 models are confusing . 
  sorry for bothering again . 
  yea im not going to overclock it , especially since its already pushing the watts . 
  seems like there is also a promo for gtx , free watchdogs or something like that . 
  though not sure if my country/seller applies as they are very unclear about it . 
  yep , especially since its using uplay :d, 
  the thing is , adding ssd later would cost less than switching to 770 , and most of the time not having ssd would not hurt me . 
  770 is about 20 % faster so the price increase is pretty linear and it would be the upgrade which is at the end of power supply limit and it will push the time when i would need an upgrade . 
  as another person mentioned i should probably go with [ this 770 ] ( http://www.electronics.balticmart.eu/index.php?mact=products,cntnt01,details,0&amp;cntnt01productid=334509&amp;cntnt01returnid=56&amp;hl=en_us ) , is that right ? 
  ( wow im to tired to structure my sentences too ), 
  it will be weird seeing this spinning instead of my beautiful 9800 gtx + . 
  what are the main parts which uses a lot of watts , is it only processor and video card ? 
  also , will i be able to hook 2 monitors to it when ill upgrade my current one ? 
  as my monitor is a tv/monitor hybrid , so it probably would stay on the desk anyway . 
  the thing is , i thought i did like it , because when i was a kid i liked it , but after re-watching it i 'm thinking of a way to time travel just to slap myself in the early days for liking it . 
  i 'm not even that into star wars . 
  seems like some people forget to read the 2nd comment and see that there is a bundle of sticks among those commentators . 
  but i already have a doctorate in bull shit . 
  seems that you can pretty much find the definition of america in this picture . 
  now i think im pretty set , though i starter looking around other towers/cases , what i should look at when choosing it ? 
  also at what parts should i mostly look at to see how much power it will eat , is it only cpu and gpu ? 
  so far without case its 401w , does ssd add much ? 
  yea i am getting 550w , though 401w is with a different 770gtx , i think msi has a bit faster speeds ( i dont think this was there to choose ) , so it might take few watts more . 
  so msi would n't also change any comparability issues i guess . 
  what do you think about this case : http://www.electronics.balticmart.eu/index.php?mact=products,cntnt01,details,0&amp;cntnt01pagelimit=25&amp;cntnt01hierarchy=computing%20%7c%20computer_components%20%7c%20chassis%20%7c%20pc_chassis%2a&amp;cntnt01returnid=56&amp;cntnt01cd_origpage=56&amp;cntnt01productid=341712&amp;cntnt01pagenum=7&amp;cntnt01returnid=56&amp;hl=en_us , it is a bit cheaper than cooler master , has some better openings for ventilation and i think it allows for more fans , though this is not on pcpp . 
  yea , the one i mentioned does n't seem to have any reviews , so might be new maker which is n't tested well enough /, 
  yep but the one you using would increase the price for me , and im already pushing it . 
  also is quite higher , some prices are weird where im looking . 
  would these rams http://www.electronics.balticmart.eu/index.php?mact=products,cntnt01,details,0&amp;cntnt01productid=103045&amp;cntnt01returnid=56&amp;hl=en_us be as good as the ones i provided earlyer ? 
  it cuts price significantly . 
  sorry i think i had a stroke while reading . . 
  how many times have you spoken to average russian ? 
  the case is totally different , its just presented like that and no one even bothers to look into it . . 
  looks deadly , australia ? 
  how would you know something like that ? 
  stickley posts only porn gifs . 
  they said same about transendance , and i liked it quite a bit ( ignoring the ending ) , sometimes its worth just to see it for yourself . 
  look hot its going great for china and japan for not making humans anymore . . crashing economies is fun , i know , but still mate . . 
  ask him not me , i dont know the sources . . 
  no its not , japan growth rates are slowing down , and it is projected to continue to do so . 
  china is slowing down also . . 
  so you are the false one . 
  loosing the jar of dirt hit him hard . 
  that does n't mean he cant walk . . 
  he might be using those just so the bone could heal normally . . 
  nah , he repeats the same batch of them . 
  you do n't say ? 
  ** l ** aughing ** m ** y ** f ** at ** a ** ss ** o ** ff ** r ** ight ** o ** n ** t ** he ** f ** reeway ? 
  sorry for stupid question but whats tripwire , and why the hate ? 
  mine only sends dick picks everywhere : /, 
  minions !, 
  hail for my power , because im an almighty capybara !, 
  til its always a link to other comment . . 
  its falling apart everywhere mate , especially in roads with heavy truck traffic . 
  btw whats the car ? 
  if only that was the only cringe worthy thing in this picture . . 
  these texts are 99 % of the time fake , so are random statistics in comments . 
  source - im a statistician . 
  some of these probably would fail quite a bit of better cointegration / correlation tests but still nice graphs . 
  i would like one , but im not from us so if its expensive to send and i accidentally get drawn , send to someone else . 
  i guess there is vanity accounts for everything . . 
  so broken window fallacy ? 
  you can see how hard he is trying to act . . 
  ( of course that word fits nice in reply to your gifs . . ), 
  well how else will you start the engine ? 
  are those russian blues ? 
  wow you could burn those and gain few watts , what a great company to send you free energy !, 
  yea i was wondering which one of these 2 that is , still beautiful cats . 
  splinter looking for new recruits !, 
  wow thats least gory gore i 've seen in a while !, 
  the problem with vegetables , a lot of them , if not most , are actually `` man made '' , as they were selectively planted for millenniums . 
  define man made objects , because a lof of things might fit that . 
  im wondering , can this be safe ? 
  also imagine walking during a strong wind ... 
  the baltics can fuse into an unstoppable force , estonians has it , lithuanians has lasers and latvians has potatoes !, 
  fuck . . not jar jar again ... 
  which one of 280x would you suggest , the 3-fan one costs me same as 770 twin frozr ( its discounted atm ) . 
  all the tiny logic machines inside it is working constantly , drawing in electricity , and they are cramped in pretty close these days . 
  maybe after being exposed to it for all those years made his body adapt and be able to secrete miracuru naturally ? 
  mirakuru was actually holding him back , now he has his full power . 
  reminds me some of the fight they had in gantz anime/manga . 
  huh dont remind us of the peanut butter guy . . 
  fuck you , you scared me ... 
  thought i had another dead one ... 
  i usually like the movies he is in , but not him in those movies . . 
  ive been reading manga , but at the end it was very hard to do so , idk if it was me or the drawing went bad . . 
  though i would love to see alien ship arc animated !, 
  all those fight against giant aliens would be pretty cool . 
  have you watched the recent live-action movie ? 
  i7 and only 760 ? 
  ouch , well still you get i7 sticker , but still . . 
  but what about all the millions of dollars i won ?
