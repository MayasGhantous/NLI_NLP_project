  il-2 sturmovik : 1946 is old game ( 2006 ) , but gold for low performance pc and if you have joystick and you will put everything on realistic you will have a lot of fun . 
  p.s do not buy this if you do n't have a joystick . 
  or buy buy il-2 sturmovik : battle of stalingrad if you have powerful pc but it 's price is 5x bigger . 
  yes , literally joystick ( like in real planes ) . 
  i did not tried gamepad ( 360 controller ) and those games that you mentioned but i think stalingrad is better because it 's newer ( but maybe it is still in development ) . 
  read steam reviews who actually played it . 
  it does not matter if republicans are paid or not . 
  what matters that voters know ( i think ) that many republicans do not believe in global warming and they still vote . 
  many members of congress are christians not because they are paid to be them but because many voters are christians . 
  same . 
  maybe that was like daily deal ? 
  50 shades ? 
  : okay :, 
  how did you took picture ? 
  maybe this will help http://www.eu4wiki.com/europa_universalis_4_wiki, 
  i 'm going to build my own country with blackjack and hookers, 
  2133 utc , not 2033 utc . 
  us and eu are both in daylight saving time and difference between edt and utc is 5 hours . 
  til . 
  utc/gmt and bst ( british summer time ) are not the same . 
  who pays you when you win or even when you lose round ? 
  the losing team receives :, 
  $ 1400 after losing the first round, 
  $ 1900 after losing 2 rounds in a row, 
  $ 2400 after losing 3 rounds in a row, 
  $ 2900 after losing 4 rounds in a row, 
  $ 3400 after losing 5 or more rounds in a row, 
  if terrorists were able to plant the bomb but lose the round , all terrorists receive a $ 800 bonus additionally to the values above . 
  you are right . 
  if you are saving weapon then you and your team wo n't get money , but if your team is eliminated you will get money . 
  as i said you get money even when you lose round ( if you are not saving ) . 
  64 tick server, 
  it will first automatically take money from wallet and then from credit card . 
  imagine if this comes to , for example , cs : go . 
  buy if you want to play in dust 2 night or aim botz and so on . 
  dlc now has another form . 
  before paid mods skyrim was in 4th place by steam user reviews . 
  now skyrim is in 7th page . 
  top helpful reviews all red . 
  wise developers and publishers will learn from this lesson . 
  not so smart developers will have same consequences . 
  edit : now 17th page .

  edit : just 3 days and 10 % lost . 
  after 6 days with this pace you can reach mixed reviews . 
  you only used steam community market since 2007 ? 
  edit : `` after i sell dota and gs : go items on steam marketplace '' . 
  how did you get so many items ? 
  bought on community market ? 
  traded ? 
  it is possible that who is in fraudulent activity gets something then sells it to community market and someone who buys from there get ban ? 
  i am sure that you can get ban if you trade with scammer but what about market ? 
  so now i ca n't just go perfectly straight up to 10k and then start gravity turn ? 
  now i need from ~ 0.5 k start to turn like 1-5 degrees and then from 10k start same gravity turn as always ? 
  1.0.1 update . 
  * added part temperature gauges/highlighting ( toggle with f10 ) . 
  what exactly this thing does ? 
  if i press f10 what should it do or show ? 
  i did not see anything except that this is enabled . 
  steam review :, 
    even if you set steering deadzone to 0 , the game enforces a deadzone and a minimum steering angle that suddenly appears , making precise small corrections impossible, 
  can someone confirm and comment on this ? 
  even at 0 deadzone it feels like deadzone still exist . 
  i ca n't afford full setup ( wheel , gearbox , pedals ) so i feel disappointed . 
  no if you had this just ~ 1-2 rounds ( shooting through smokes like in video ) . 
  btw how many people watch one case ? 
  i wonder how rank symbol will look like at like 300 rank . 
  why ? 
  for the glory of satan of course, 
  i heard rumors that summer sale starts in 11th of june so this mysterious badge crafting confirms that it will be on next week ? 
  rip wallet, 
  mind = = blown, 
  one update is kb3035583 , how is other update called ? 
  as [ barkingtoad ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/windows10/comments/39394k/can_i_get_my_free_windows_10_upgrade_even_if_i/cs0d5n2 ) said `` you should get it eventually , if the update is installed '' . 
  i bought and installed two days ago and fully updated ( got kb3035583 ) and i did n't get immediately reserve button , but just now it came up and i can reserve . 
  so just wait ~ 2-3 days . 
  shoot to kill !, 
  what sold me is that just cause 3 will be same size as just cause 2 ( 400 square miles ( 1,000 km ^ 2 ) ) and more beautiful terrain . 
  so it is worth buying euiv without common sense dlc ? 
  i heard that you ca n't improve your development without common sense dlc . 
  and what about cosmetic packs . 
  they are just skins to exsisting units or they can add completely new units ? 
  worth buying cosmetic packs ( advisor portraits , landmarks , unit models ) ? 
  to me it was 4-5 days, 
  replace utc with bst, 
  correct time is 0500 utc, 
  when i logged in and windows finished installing apps instead of start screen i have black screen with cursor . 
  now waiting 20 min . 
  and still nothing . 
  same . 
  maybe there will be new heroes that they revealed at gamescon ? 
  is sapling got inspiration from treant ?
