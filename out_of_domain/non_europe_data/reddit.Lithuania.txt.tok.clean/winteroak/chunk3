  how would you determine whether someone is really christian or muslim ? 
  [ trump : london mayor made ` very rude statements ' about me ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/16/politics/donald-trump-cameron-khan/index.html ), 
  so trump can insult anyone and it is fine , but just try to say facts about trump that he does n't like and it is rude and offensive .

  you do n't need evidence for putin and trump relationship to not vote for trump . 
  it is enough to hear statements from trump like `` nato is obsolete '' or he would decide whether to come to their aid only after reviewing if those nations have `` fulfilled their obligations to us . '' . 
  do you want again nuclear missiles near us like it was in cold war ? 
  you want another soviet union with borders in germany ? 
  even if trump is not a putin 's puppet , he still gives him a green light to occupy baltic states . 
  look what putin already does in syria , ukraine and georgia . 
  you are not voting for democratic or republican ideology , you are voting for peace and stability or just plain stupidity , dangerous man who can allow putin to do whatever he wants like neville chamberlain allowed hilter to do . 
  bill tuesday , obama wednesday . 
  two party system at its finest .

  better elect someone who says nato is obsolete . 
  let russia occupy baltic states and let russians bring back nuclear missiles near us again !!!, 
  world stabilty is so yesterday . 
  world war 3 is so much fun after playing call of duty . 
  did you come to this conclusion after seeing r/all or you do n't see everywhere that enthusiasm ? 
  do n't forget about ttip when negotiations will be concluded . 
  ttip will bring usa and eu more closer and make us stronger against countries like russia . 
  also thank you , joe biden . 
  he was amazing . 
  they will yell and then move on to another country to influence elections .

  mexico !, 
   the meeting had not been announced by trump team officials or russian officials , and reports say iceland has not been formally contacted about such an event . 
  quote from thehill article . 
  are you saying that trump 's administration appointed sally yates and then fired her , because she gone rogue ? 
  where do you see similarities ? 
  nikki haley is appointed by trump 's administration not obama 's . 
  what makes you think that n. haley is not sending trump 's message to russia ? 
  us at war with iran ? 
  us at war with north korea ? 
  so let 's be frends with them and remove all sanctions ? 
  another example of this kind of journalism ( the hill ) that goes to front page : [ trump to meet putin in first foreign trip as president : report ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5o11wm/trumps_first_foreign_trip_as_president_will_be_to/ ), 
  headline : `` trump to meet putin in first foreign trip as president : report '', 
  in article : `` the meeting had not been announced by trump team officials or russian officials , and reports say iceland has not been formally contacted about such an event . '', 
  if you open all top comments and ctrl-f word `` deter '' you will see that comments have only 1-3 points with this word . 
  just shows how much echo chamber and bias this sub . 
  independent.co.uk is added to another list of news that just pushes its own agenda . 
  did article mentioned this :, 
  - [ `` the united states continues to condemn and call for an immediate end to the russian occupation of crimea , '' said nikki haley , president donald trump 's envoy to the world body . 
  ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/02/politics/haley-russia-un/ ), 
  - [ `` trump taps putin critic for senior white house position '' ] ( https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/03/02/trump-taps-putin-critic-for-senior-white-house-position/ ) , [ `` trump moves to name fiona hill as top russia adviser , source says '' ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-03-02/trump-said-to-choose-russia-expert-hill-as-white-house-adviser ), 
  - if trump is putin 's puppet then russia would want to see us and nato weaker or no ? 
  [ `` trump seeks ` historic ' u.s. military spending boost , domestic cuts '' ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-budget-iduskbn1661r2 ) , [ mike pence warns nato it must boost defence spending ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39027182 ),

  - did obama send lethal aid to ukraine ? 
  did obama abandoned missile defence shield in europe ? 
  yes . 
  did obama with hillary tried to do reset with russia ? 
  remember hillary 's reset button gift to russia ? 
  i am from baltics and i was genuinely scared day after us election , but seeing trump actions after inauguration makes me more safe than before . 
  so seeing this liberal media constant `` trump is putin 's puppet '' at this point becomes joke . 
  by the way bernie sanders still can win .
