  [ if you feel pirate-y ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb37cvaro24 ) mate , you can have some rum and download [ this book ] ( https://kat.cr/seducing-the-subconscious-the-psychology-of-emotional-influence-in-advertising-robert-heath-2012-pdf-t7730431.html ) . 
  it 's quite illustrating about the human judging process and it has a practical focus on advertising .

  welcome to the bane train !, 
  yeah , you 're not to blame for not liking `` mainstream '' social events . 
  the feelings you have playing videogames are mos likely what extroverted types feel when `` clubbing '' . 
  there are two `` social events '' i like : there 's a videogame tourney , just like the one you said , and the once-a-semester `` party '' ( drink fest ) where i hang out with my mates . 
  for me alcohol = liquid un-inhibition . 
  we can be sidekicks if we want , there 's nothing wrong with it . 
  but in general we can be supportive . 
  nevertheless our support can never be taken for granted , as if something stops being coherent/contradicts our morals/rationale . 
  being the president ? 
  why risking it * when we can be the power behind the throne * ? 
  not being able to have freaking manual or social skills , or those kind of skills that are embedded on every other personality type . 
  save for us . 
  re-kindled my `` study rush '', 
  i missed that one . 
  a lot . 
  even if you saw the alternate version where `` batman wins '' there is a part where lord vader states : `` your science did not defeat me '' to what batman replies : `` it was n't supposed to '' and frees the kriptonian , who ultimately saves him from certain death . 
  explain yourself . 
   i guarantee you no american servicemen thought '' by golly , lets bomb that hospital '', 
  like on that time when [ they were playing call of duty on real people ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rxprfnu3g0#t=9m36s ) ? 
  i think the color coding is appropriate . 
  upvotes are red like lord vader 's lightsaber , while downvotes are blue , like the lightsabers of those treacherous jedi fanatics . 
  but then again , the laser ordnance of any siennar fleet systems vessel is green , a color commonly used by the jedi , while the rebel scum 's laser ordnance is red . 
  it 's good to know that your people are the boots on the ground that go after sam sites to let us do our jobs when fire missions are requested . 
  i first fell in love while studying in highschool . 
  got friendzoned , hard . 
  on the start my attitudes were `` i have to protect myself '' , ( not having a girlfriend would naturally shield me from accidentally impregnating her , something common here in mexico ) `` i 'm beyond this '' and `` i 'm not interested '' . 
  bang . 
  well , we intp 's probably struggle with relationships because we lack the social skills necessary to court a partner . 
  otherwise we 're simply not interested . 
  lol i abuse parenthesis a lot too . 
  a very intelligent man . 
  he seems to `` think outside the box '' i first saw him on uncommon knowledge . 
  good . 
  now make my fe understand and act in accordance with this brilliant philosophy . 
  i 'm also much more flattered by someone who highlights my intelligence than by someone who highlights my looks . 
  by the way , i love your flair . 
  i hold that perception too . 
  it seems that society ca n't process a girl who is good looking and intelligent at the same time . 
  it does n't make sense to me . 
  i just thought about learning as an intp fetish . 
  and even though generally speaking is an asset , it can become a serious liability if it is not properly restrained . 
  we love to learn about things but , are we learning the * right * ones ? 
  i do not know about you , but i tend to spend too much time if i get interested in something ( like star wars , for example ) so i can accumulate layers and layers of completely useless knowledge , just because it is interesting to me . 
  time is important , and i tend not to appreciate it . 
  i just have one life to spend , ( as far as i know ) so i have to question if i am really pursuing the knowledge that will benefit my life . 
  fun fact : according to [ wolfram alpha ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=amount+of+books+in+the+library+of+congress ) there were 22\u00a0194\u00a0656 books in the library of congress in 2011 . 
  do we really need so much knowledge or is it actually an irrational behavior for our type to hoard information and knowledge ? 
  my long term memory is awesome , i can remember specific details about events that happened long ago and recall objects that i saw long ago very accurately . 
  but short time memory is my curse . 
  i forget everything . 
   so what should betas do ? 
  roll over and accept their fate as sexual nonentities ? 
  it 's not as hard as it sounds . 
  and it 's quite liberating . 
  i do n't think there is ever a case where any person should not be respected . 
  by the way on my definition one person respects another person until one of the two gets disrespected . 
  ( even though my morals are clear to me , some people do stuff that makes me disrespect them , so i 'm not 100 % consistent ), 
  ah , but i 've read lots of red pill articles that enshrine looks . 
  my idea with this thread is for redpillers to set a standard on as much `` alpha measures '' they can . 
  the measures that are the most attractive to women , or the most imposing/scary to other men . 
  so lifting , partially . 
  i know i ca n't grow more but having a standard for height as a reference would be nice too . 
  but i can change my body mass so perhaps i can comply with that if i choose to . 
  not looks , because in order to get that you 'd have to change your clothing or have cosmetic surgery done , so no . 
  i hope i clarified myself . 
  purely physique . 
  my god !, 
  not only do you read minds , ( trough internet , no less ! ), 
  but you can foresee the future . 
  i 'm genuinely interested in finding a comprehensive standard of measurements . 
  you redpillers classify people indiscriminately on the basis of certain traits , ca n't you classify just a little more , so that we have objective , unalterable standard ? 
  and no , i do not intend to bait anyone . 
  i just realized we 're all horribly deformed , then . 
  and what 's the perfect feminine shape ? 
  yes , i knew about the golden ratio , but i wanted redpillers to say , for example , `` the golden ratio is 1.680 '' and your hip circumference must be 25 in . 
  and you should be 6 ' 4 '' , your biceps should measure 15 in , etc. 
  with the obvious redpill justification of why did they choose such measurements in consensus . 
  they usually say : this is masculine , this is not . 
  but they fail to provide a perfect model where masculinity can indeed be measured and compared , rather than relying on `` gut feeling '' which can lead to biases . 
  wow . 
  now this is an enlightening comment . 
  no wonder why i felt such a strong sexual desire and i could n't concentrate when studying any math subject more advanced than algebra . 
  so , this is how [ alpha copulation ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d2/sphere_intersection.png ) looks like ? 
  ( bro , he 's even fucking two girls at the same time ! ), 
  [ nsfw ], 
  i see , thanks for the resources . 
  well , i guess being a literal god of thunder is not so good for sexual endeavors , is it ? 
  there is no other beth but beth . 
  username checks out . 
  i have a book that states that procrastination is linked to our conception of perfection , which can be positive and negative . 
  positive perfectionism leads you to get started an improve in a continuous basis . 
  negative perfectionism never gets you started because you 'll think you 're not going to be able to complete your task at 100 % perfection , so there 's no point in even trying it . 
  another pillar of this theory is the procrastination equation :, 
  self worth = ability = performance . 
  so , what happens when your performance is zero ? 
  your self worth is zero too , and that can not happen , so procrastination kicks in .
