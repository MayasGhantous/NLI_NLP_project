  take r/mexico for example : it should be called r/proceso ( a magazine which exposes corruption and impunity ) ; as much as half of everything posted is about corruption in politics or violence . 
  r/ru has very little activity , which is to be expected since reddit was banned in russia ( is there a russian equivalent of reddit ? 
  i 'd totally make an account to visit sometime ) . 
  i love how many of those adjectives are from groups that hate each other :, 
  * commie - nazi, 
  * fascist - terrorist reptilian, 
  because , as we know it , terrorist reptilians are actually freedom fighters ; it 's just that the fish confederacy has special interests in animalia and controls the media . 
  hence the mammalian news channel 4 reports the united front for scaled freedom as `` cold-blooded terrorists and murderers '' .

  that 's an interesting point you 're making . 
  anthropometry is one of those subjects i usually do n't give a damn about , but it seems central to american dynamics so i need you to check my knowledge . 
  * there are 3 races : caucasoid , negroid and mongoloid ; these races conform all people , albeit in different proportion . 
  * before the xix century , traveling was extremely difficult and human settlements lived for centuries on a single region , so enviroment features greatly shaped people 's phenotype . 
  the phenotype corresponding to a given human settlement is called an ethnicity , and these are what we could unrigurously -- just for practical reference -- call `` purebreeds '' according to mendel 's first law . 
  am i correct or just saying a load of bollocks ? 
  he 's not just a sir . 
  thanks for replying !, 
  i 'm all for flair systems . 
  they 're efficient and let you decide which content you want to see . 
  r/kotakuinaction 's flair system would work wonders here , since the sas arguments get repeated time and time again . 
  and i agree with you , american politics are far too entertaining ; actually , that 's the scary legacy of donald trump , in my opinion : he turned a serious , boring and important subject into an entertaining shitshow . 
  and it 's difficult to take an issue seriously when it 's been transformed into entertainment material . 
  edit : shoutout to you , u/fezzuk . 
  wow . 
  just wow . 
  well ... at the risk of sounding very ignorant yet again , i 'll have to say that popular culture depicts these guys as immobile statues . 
  so immobile that ... well , you saw austin powers 2 . 
  it basically makes them look like a curious prop , more than an elite soldier , doing actual security work for a very important person in britain . 
  and , being depicted like that , it 's natural that some ignorant jackass will try to take a picture of them or provoke them for fun , when these guys are not to fuck around with . 
  besides , it must be really frustrating to be a really well-trained soldier , and having lost friends on war in an ideal of protecting the civilians ( which in practice that may be real or not , but that does n't lessen the veteran 's struggle in any way ) , so that those same civilians , plus ones who do n't even live there try their assholery on them because they 're wearing a funny looking , furry hat . 
  so yes , a bit of both : everybody should understand british culture in order to be polite to britons , and also have some common sense . 
  it seems the argument is that he 's disrepecting the veterans by not honoring the anthem . 
  does n't an anthem stand for the entirety of people who live in a country ? 
  the armed forces play an important part and they have to be acknowledged accordingly , but not everything is just war , people . 
  this coming from a person whose national anthem is a complete glorification of dying in combat . 
  in order to refute their argument , i hereby present [ the wise words ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziuzlpo1kxi#t=1m33s ) of a ph.d in social science . 
  for all the ` murican supposed respect and praise to their veterans , this quote seems quite disrespectful . 
  wwii was a horrible , destructive war where violations to human rights were as abundant as candies at wonka 's factories , not some sort of sport . 
  gorgeous . 
  substitute ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  i was about to say that the [ corona commercial ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qo0boa4iz0 ) does n't help the queen 's guard 's image as a hardened soldier either ( albeit it shows him as an immobile statue as well ) ; but revisiting it , it seems to make way more fun of london 's metropolitan police than of the queen 's guard . 
  just curious , how do they get selected for guard duty ? 
  do they get summoned for service after some accomplishment or a requisite for entering other kind of army corps ? 
  or could they just apply for it upon meeting the requisites ? 
  we know immigrants , we have the best immigrants . 
  just for fun 's sakes , was that year close to 1984 ? 
  mexican here : at school there were `` civic ceremonies '' in remembrance of important dates in mexico ( february 24 , may 5th , september 15th , november 20th , amongst some others ) . 
  the ceremonies consisted in forming orderly lines surrounding the speaker 's podium , making a squared `` u '' shape around it , and listening to the historical context of the date , and maybe watching a small theatrical re-enactment of the events ( specially on may , september and november where the battles started or took place ) . 
  the ceremonies were held on a large courtyard , so we would be standing through the whole thing and attendance was mandatory and non-negociable unless you were demonstrably sick . 
  the anthem would always be played at those specific occasions and unlike some other countries , it wad not played for `` openings '' or `` closures '' . 
  i attended private schools from kindergarden to high school , so i do n't know how do public schools in mexico do it . 
  [ mexico ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/himno_nacional_mexicano#versi.c3.b3n_original ) . 
  i love how her `` hip clevage '' reveals that she 's either wearing some crafty panties , or nothing at all . 
  i 'd like the point of view from an arab person in this sub , their input would be very valuable . 
  i read that arab people are really keen on genealogy ; remember [ this guy ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/osama_bin_laden_portrait.jpg ) ? 
  i read the word `` bin '' means `` son of '' and arabic names tend to be long because they trace their genealogy for a few generations back ( therefore , `` bin laden '' is the last part of the surname of a very large and wealthy family who owns [ a huge construction enterprise ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saudi_binladin_group ) ) . 
  looks like arabs and americans are not so different after all . 
  just sayin ' . 
  preserving mexican culture by getting drunk at may 5th , amusingly unaware that some of us mexicans quietly pay respects to the irish ( and western europeans ) at paddy 's day to remember [ saint patrick 's battalion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_patrick%27s_battalion ) , who were desertors and traitors to americans who fought for mexico . 
  your comment reminded me of chief bogo . 
  i think it 's practically impossible to trace it back to * the * muhammad , considering he was here 14 centuries ago and that there are an awful lot of people called `` muhammad '' alive and through history . 
  during the 70 's hajj bombings , the leader of the terrorists who stormed the holiest mosque in islam claimed to be some sort of redeemer . 
  i do n't know anything about islamic or arabic traditions , but i 'll take the risk and call bullshit on this one . 
  damn nazis ruined cool symbols . 
  even if you do n't know which meaning is attributed to that eagle ( and many other symbols ) , you have to accept that for us foreigners , it looks badass as fuck ; same for the totenkopf . 
  if you think about it , hitler also ruined a very stylish and conservative look : hair neatly combed to the side , the chaplin mustache and trench coat . 
  if you wear all of those at the same time , you will be mistaken for a genocidal maniac . 
  this comment needs to be gilded . 
  the problem is that they are n't saying that with complete lack of emotion , it 's actually the opposite . 
  that comment shows a completely emotional response . 
  sadly , the us government has shown to share this sentiment ; although in a much more subtle way . 
  well , i was thinking about it in the `` super upvote '' sense . 
   and i would n't have a clue on what to do with reddit gold . 
  me neither . 
  i 've seen many mtt posts , but xvampire and xxpussyslayer98 are unknown to me . 
  [ how bad must you be in order to have * your very own flair * at this sub ? ], 
  i upvoted without having the slightest idea of what i 'm upvoting . 
   lots of anthems are so cheesy they put power metal lyrics to shame . 
  [ funny you said that ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqcawlf2gfs ), 
  so you were basically rambo for a while ? 
  was it because of the way trumpets portray sweden or was it the ( arguably swedish ) bodybuilder ? 
  if by `` preppers '' you mean people who hoard food an goods in order to withstand a natural disaster , then they 're still kinda wacky : as mexicans , we are in real endangerment of earthquakes , hurricanes and volcanic eruptions and i have to tell you that the sensible thing to do in such cases is to evacuate . 
  so unless they are preparing to secure a viable escape route and know how to survive on minimum resources instead of `` castling '' i would say they 're kind of paranoid . 
  or they live in engineered buildings with special foundations found in ultra-modern architechture to withstand earthquakes ( they do exist ) , which seems unlikely due to most american homes being made of wood . 
  holy shit , the huge irony makes laughing at their delusion so much better . 
  but is it good in lava , tornadoes , hurricanes , floodings , blizzards , soviet invasions and the imminent arrival of cthulhu , hmmm ? 
  #hhhhhmmmm ??? 
  god dammit , every time i make an uneducated guess on this sub it turns out to be wrong . 
  til . 
  and mexico . 
  mexican baseball is pretty competitive . 
  have we become self-righteous drama queens ? 
  lol all porn of asians with super large dicks and even two comparisons of the same teen with thw huge dick to ripped grown men of races that have supposedly larger dicks , according to descriptive statistics . 
  overcompensation , anyone ? 
  as a mexican , i 'm starting to perceive that american rednecks hate your guts more that they hate ours . 
  and my conjecture is that the scandinavian countries as a whole were portrayed as the closest thing to paradise on earth amd you greeted `` large '' ammounts of refugees from troubled countries . 
  some alt-righters are racists , fascists , islamophobes and xenophobes , all at the same time . 
  if sweden does n't `` fall '' ( in the apocalyptic sense of the word ) , then its social robustness will demostrate right in front of their eyes that they were wrong and their whole system of convictions and morals was mistaken .
