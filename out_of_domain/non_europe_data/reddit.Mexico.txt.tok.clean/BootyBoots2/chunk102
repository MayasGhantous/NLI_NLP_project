  thank you for replying !, 
  it 's very valuable input for me . 
  this sub is awesome . 
  the only thing that would make this shirt better would be if the flag was the one of the 13 colonies instead of the current one . 
  i fear we 've come to that point . 
  edit : not as bad as srs itself , obviously ; but pretty much along the lines of it , you could spot a comment of sorts once in a while . 
  quite an interesting point of view . 
  i thought `` i 'll add it to my watch later list ( aka the oblivion ) '' upon seeing it was an hour and a half long , but i sat through the entire thing . 
  [ some annotations ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/test/comments/51a6tp/text_wall_formatting_text/ ) . 
   `` even though his copper mine got bombed a lot , '' lohman said , `` he knew it meant the americans were coming . '', 
  i see . 
  did he know about * the other * bomb that americans had in store for japanese civilians ? 
  i 'm getting the impression that americans are * keen * on smugling their guns into canada , but not into mexico ( despite being way more dangerous overall in here ) . 
  i mean , i have n't heard about the spring breakers call for `` muh 2nd ammendment '' , which doens ' t make sense either , but alas , it makes even less sense in such a peaceful country as canada is . 
  i do n't know ... jebus has tracked lots of brigaders . 
  he says we brigade worse than srd . 
  and it 's srd we 're talking about . 
  that speaks pretty bad of us . 
  no , i do n't . 
  care to link the story for me , please ? 
  you could say [ they crashed ] ( http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/05/23/fast7jpg-dcfc22_1280w.jpg ) on that one . 
  [ you wan na get your eod suit if you 're going to find out about the puppies ] ( http://imgur.com/jdt1rrf ) . 
  off topic , but i had n't seen [ a burkini ] ( http://ep00.epimg.net/elpais/imagenes/2016/03/23/estilo/1458745542_742927_1458748403_noticia_normal.jpg ) before and now i 'm really pissed off . 
  these imbeciles willfully fucked up a stretegic victory ( ban on actual burkas or niqabs for security reasons ) and now it looks like they wanted to alienate islam all along . 
  the burkini does n't cover the fucking face . 
  i 'm afraid i turn into an unreasonable parroting machine given the right circumstances , for any unreasonable political stance conceivable . 
  the level of entrenchment is scary . 
  arghh ... this is an example of rule v being respected but damn ... 
  i could really use some context . 
  what did you say to trigger him that way ? 
  edit : grc ? 
  i can infer the `` g '' stands for `` gun '' and the `` c '' for `` control '' . 
  but what does the `` r '' mean ? 
  lmao . 
  thanks sgt !, 
  i already knew that sub , but i forgot the accronym . 
  i do like hershey 's chocolate . 
  sorry for not being european and covered in the best chocolate in existance !, 
  my uncle is mexican , but son of a german immigrant , so he visits the german family every once in a while . 
  he always cares to bring a bundle of ritter sport so we get to enjoy it . 
  hershey 's = good !, 
  ritter sport = brown elixir from the gods . 
  i dissent . 
  i have never seen such threads ( i guess they 're repetitive ) , and even though i already knew a general rule is to never touch them/greet by kissing ( we do that in mexico ) , they put much emphasis on their road ettiquete . 
  also on national parks ... 
  this is what reciting the pledge does to them in the mid-term . 
  i 've never been to the us , though i have met a handful of american people and they 're sweet as you know which flavor of pie . 
  but it seems one of their fetishisms is ww2 . 
  some americans are ** obsessed ** over ww2 . 
  i 've always found it kind of ironic that they find it amusing to call the french out for their surrender in ww2 ( which i have n't studied to dare to call them out for cowardice ) , conveniently forgetting that napoleon had europe on its knees a while back before the world wars , and if it was n't for a pan-european coallition to defeat him , you europeans would n't be speaking german , but french . 
  i , for one thank france for being napoleon 's birthplace . 
  if it was n't for him , we might still be subjects to spain . 
  you know your comment is fucked up when the red pill downvotes you . 
  this comment is especially sad considering my country is fucking mexico . 
  i mean , there 's the glittering goodness of [ chocolate abuelita ] ( https://www.elmejornido.com/media/1861/qv_product_hotchocolatetablets19oz.jpg ) to prepare for drinks ( or eat like a caveman ) ; but it 's made by nestl\u00e9 , you know . 
  looks like being big and diverse kind of backfired , eh ? 
  triggered . 
  i do n't know who got the stereotype that people in latin american countries ritually go take a nap in the middle of the afternoon either because of a cultural tradition , pure laziness or nothing in particular . 
  til . 
  lol .

  ** edit **, 
   the fbi could stomp out the cartels in a few months , and the 2nd amendment would allow newly minted american citizens to fix the problem themselves . 
  plus , small boarder with central america . 
  and that huge new gulf . 
  this comment is so mind-blowing it 's worth breaking in parts :, 
   the fbi could stomp out the cartels in a few months, 
  the last time your authorities tried anything funny * you armed our murderers * . 
  we do n't make guns , they all come from the outside , and even though i do n't know for certain , i 'm pretty convinced most of them are american . 
  your delusions of safety would only make things worse . 
   and the 2nd amendment would allow newly minted american citizens to fix the problem themselves . 
  not only will crime get worse because of the over-abundance of guns , now get to have regular school shootings * on crack * : because of course there are absolutely no people on your nation of morals that fantasise to mow down mexican people with an smg . 
   plus , small boarder with central america . 
  believe me , it 's porous . 
  but i guess the wall gets cheaper so , win ? 
   and that huge new gulf . 
  oh , do n't play saint on us ... were n't you cheating to get the oil already ? 
  well , either way prepare to [ greet your brand-new natural resources from the gulf !,

   leave me the fuck alone i 'm making it clear with my body language and short/quiet answers that i do n't want to interact with you, 
  different people have different abilities and talents . 
  i 've come to think that people who are good at reading other people often get extremely upset when they 're not read accordingly . 
  as a person who really needed to develop the `` social muscle '' from the ground ( via fucking it up and the growing pains of some very cringey experiences ) i 'd like people with great social skills to understand the lesser graced individuals in that department , and also use spoken language when necessary : body language did n't do the trick ? 
  say `` hey , i 'm not in a very good mood right now , and i 'd rather be left alone '' or i 'm not interested , thank you . 
  i know it kills the mood a lot and strips the mystery out , but some people are * really * oblivious and despite how one may feel , treating people is not some ingrained skill for many , many people . 
  of course , there 's a boundary of respect that gets crossed once you 've used spoken language ; and there are dangerous and violent people out there who bypass not just body or spoken language but also any moral restriction and to be fair , you 're most likely not going to get bailed out on just body language . 
  on the contrary , they 're just going to get worse by reading fear . 
  ** edit ** : did n't watch the video , just wrote this upon reading . 
  judging for the comments it must be reaaaally cringey but now i 'll make myself sit through the whole thing . 
  must likely the person shown in the video is being very disrespectful , and that 's not the context of the point i was trying to make . 
  ** edit 2 ** : fuck this , i could n't make it past 0:18 ; i 'm weak , beat me to it . 
  i do n't know how americans do it but at least here , the anthem is only played in ceremonies or important events . 
  singing it for no reason at all or doing it in a non-solemn manner is considered disrespecful , being an official national symbol . 
  i saw one guy who did stand up and take his hat off to follow the flow though . 
  name of the video and every actress [ here ] ( http://namethatporn.com/post/1581-what-the-name-of-the-video-.html ) . 
  difficult pick . 
  they 're all hot and i 'd bang anyone and everyone considering attractiveness alone . 
  * however * experience tells me that i need to find somebody of my own height , so i 'd pick one of the tall ones ( harley dean , anikka albrite or capri cavani ) . 
  i actually liked harley dean and i wished she appeared on that video , this picture does n't do justice to her face though . 
  i get the spirit in which this was written , but having access to information about what now is history and back then it was an unpredictable ( or certain ? ),
