  in order to satisfy my odd sense of fun and to increase my knowledge in geography , i found [ this cool interactive set of geography games ] ( http://www.sheppardsoftware.com/african_geography.htm ) ; the levels are increasingly challenging and force you to remember the country 's names , shapes , and locations . 
  there are also games to learn to locate the ~ ~ states ~ ~ administrative divisions that comprise mexico , the us , and canada , learn their capital cities and more . 
  edit : i should have known better those damn hosers are * so special * like the very snowflakes that fall onto their land . 
  [ go figure ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/administrative_divisions_of_canada ) . 
  if you pour a consistent two hours lapse on playing , you 'll be able to remember every country in a single day . 
  to be fair , some countries are easy ( egypt , madagascar , morocco , drc ) and others are small and not-so-heard-of like malawi , burundi and every country that has the name `` guinea '' on it ; of course that does n't mean they 're less important . 
  mexican here , also curious about it ... 
  agree ... 
  i 've never used a gun before , but i think gunfire is way louder than bubble wrap popping . 
  also ,, 
  * bubble wrap poppin ' schools droppin ' * . 
  this will go down as a perpetual mystery in the r-files . 
  ok , ok ; territories and provinces . 
  fine ? 
  ^ ^ ^ one of these days i 'm going to post a comment linking every time i 've been corrected so far . 
   on a more serious note , i find it ridiculous when americans say things like that , when it comes to countries like canada which are valuable trading partners for the us , it seems most americans ca n't even properly name the capital city . 
  extensive knowledge about america and poor knowledge of everywhere else seem to be a common trope for them , just like not learning other languages : it just seems to be not culturally important to them ; unlike sports . 
  did you actually visit the country , or just got correspondence from an ngo ? 
  it 's great to have positive impressions of african countries ; i think history books do n't give them the coverage they deserve and neither does the media . 
  i personally spotted nigeria and cameroon because of tears of the sun and sierra leone thanks to mw3 . 
  none which painted african countries in a slightly positive light . 
  barbacoa tastes different if you make it out of lamb meat than if you make it out of beef . 
  mexico is somewhat large and i do n't know which state your wife comes from , but if you ever have the chance to go to mexico , try barbacoa from saltillo , coahuila . 
  it 's simply unmatched . 
  once i saw somebody call the dutch `` zee germans '' ; besides , the dutch supposedly have one great threat to their existence : water . 
  that 's the reason why they have amazing dykes . 
  so , what 's the country that shares a border with germany and is not landlocked that is not poland , france , denmark or belguim ? 
  the netherlands . 
  if you have a problem telling the difference between belgium and the netherlands , remember that belgians speak french , and they are right next to france . 
  remembering which language small countries speak makes it easier to tell between the likes of luxembourg , liechtenstein , and san marino . 
  i 'm skeptical about that ... 
  i mean , every time a map of the world made by americans is displayed , it will show every country without divisions in administrative subjects , but it will show the us divided into states . 
  sure , beauty pageants may blunder when asked about other states , but i 'm willing to give common americans the benefit of the doubt . 
  it 's hard for me to believe that . 
  i 'm in shock ; if there 's one subset of american education that is stereotypically great , that would be californian private education . 
  y u hate us ? 
  you 're breaking article iii of our constitution , by the way . 
  you bet ... 
  that 's the reason why we 're so awesome : our mutant blood allows some of us to bypass amerivision \u2122 . 
  mexicans have been known to go from [ this ] ( http://entretenimiento.starmedia.com/imagenes/2013/05/laborial.jpg ) skin tone , to [ this one ] ( http://static.t13.cl/images/original/2015/05/1432047530_000dv2032903.jpg ) , to [ this one ] ( http://image.vanguardia.com.mx/sites/default/files/field/image/bc57589738573cc_145f9690e569d68de83e43bd2f378cc5.jpg ) , and also revert back at will . 
  [ look at my swag , bro ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/cavalier_soldier_hals-1624x.jpg ) . 
  i 'm not sure it committing suicide over a car is an american thing to do , [ or just a redneck thing to do ] ( http://www.eurweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dukes-of-hazzard.jpg ) . 
  proof ? 
  you know what we need to do ... 
  i agree with you on this . 
  thanks for the link . 
  many gun owners seem to have extremely entrenched ideas ( fighting a tyrannical government , the us has never been invaded because of armed citizens , etc ) built around the 2nd amendment . 
  i would n't call you crazy so right-off-the-bat , but the tone in which you replied to responsiblegunpwnr made it look like you were one of them . 
  this post breaks rule iii on this sub , though . 
  why 'd you take the bot down ? 
  tune down the self-righteousness , buddy . 
  and napalm . 
  do n't forget about the smell of napalm in the morning . 
  i honestly ca n't fathom why would there ever be a confederacy flag on canada . 
  is that about `` white pride '' or what ? 
  perfect . 
  i agree , this may be just another unfortunate search heuristics like in the cases for racist/sexist google . 
  however , we do get a dmca takedown notice as a footnote in italics explaining its fundament on american law . 
  i live in mexico . 
  theoretically speaking , i should n't need to care about american law . 
  i faintly remember reading about a controversy where the us was misdirecting people to find particular results through google . 
  but i may be saying bullshit on this one , take it with a pinch salt . 
  i do n't know . 
  i 'm calling poe 's law on this one . 
  comment on the submission : it appears to be that the person who wrote this was actually correct : grant did have a slave and lincoln was indeed a racist . 
  however , grant apparently only had * one * slave whom he freed `` as soon as he was able '' ( and most likely did n't treat him in the spirit of [ the alleged willian lynch address ] ( http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/perspectives_1/willie_lynch_letter_the_making_of_a_slave.shtml ) ) , and even though lincoln believed that white people were superior to black people , calling him `` hitler-style '' seems too much of a stretch for me . 
  anyway , there 's classic sas like `` americans identify with states , it 's in their dna '' for you to enjoy ; i just tried to showcase a refreshing title . 
  that will be u/jebusgobson 's job to judge . 
  he must have wanted the us to change from freedom units \u2122 to metric . 
  they 're plain african in cavani 's mind , though . 
  fluffy , do n't dare to provoke their ire . 
  otherwise , you 'll get sent lots of asian cuck porn . 
  it has happened before . 
  i think it is , it 's just not so obvious ; the 1/16 cherokee princess argument : they claim another country -- china in this case -- is the heir to the world and yada yada because they have some blood ties to it , despite probably having little or no contact with the actual social , cultural or political climate on that nation . 
  the novelty is that they claim that the us is militarily inferior to china , which honestly seems absurd in the first place . 
  so * technically * it 's sas , if he 's a nationalized american of chinese birth . 
  but i agree with wandarah in the sense that it 's definitely not stereotypically american . 
  i 've come to the point where i ca n't tell if this is legit or not . 
  earlier this morning i was thinking about republicans and their blaming of media on `` america 's death culture '' : they 'll blame violent movies , series , music and video games but never hunting , and god forbid questioning the actions of combat veterans , proposing to limit american access to guns in any way , or debating if a burglar 's life is worth less than property they 're trying to steal . 
  they 'll never step back and criticize the activities that * actually * involve or promote killing . 
  but i had n't considered religious extremism as form a part of said death culture until now . 
  perhaps reptile should be sceptile . 
  [ would you like to spoil his fun ?

  as a person who circumnavigated the turbulent waters of the red pill for a while , i ca n't fathom at which point they went from trying to decipher women to deciding that patriarchal systems are the best form of government . 
  bruh , you were just trying to get laid ... 
  [ looks like he decided to keep on sticking to the script ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7uabjbjs18#t=56s ) . 
   you ca n't really shake off your heritage , it 's something you 're born with , and especially with a country like america . 
  see , that 's how you identify americans . 
  americans are the only people i 've seen to make bullshit claims about heritage and how one 's culture is imbued in your genetic material . 
  a while ago i disclosed my `` heritage '' and i can safely say that i and my siblings have successfully shaken off our spanish and austrian heritage . 
   dear europe :, 
   you have absolutely 0 , zero , nada , zip , voice in our elections . 
  unless you have money , and then you give it the clinton foundation . 
  then she 'll pass a law for you . 
  i hope somewhere around in the future , the un will pass resolutions in which many countries can have voice and vote over america 's and russia 's invasions of other countries . 
  there was a post earlier today by donald jr. where he said that hillary will make the us accept hundreds of thousands of refugees from the middle east . 
  but , should n't she ? 
  europe is dealing with a crisis that would n't have happened if bush did n't unnecessarily invade iraq and killed saddam just because . 
  if anything , it 's americans who should keep their mouths closed about europe .
