  the only thing i regret about these type of comments is that [ they made jynx purple because it reminded of the blackface minstrels ] ( http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53ed083be4b0cc5a9eceb84f/t/542596cfe4b0cdc2904aecd2/1411749596549/ ) . 
  silly americans ; censoring pokemon wo n't end racism and hurtful stereotypes . 
  [ that blackface ] ( https://thelinguistgamer.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/screenshot-2015-05-05-at-3-07-16-pm.png ) is really hard to look at , though . 
  this is too much ; even for the us . 
  my guess is that it was july 4th or veteran 's day ... 
   `` just personally , ** as a military family ** , to have someone do that , thank goodness she was n't in that class because of her experiences having friends not come home , '' she said . 
  `` there are so many other ways that he could have taught that instead of trying to desecrate the flag that so many people in this country have fought so hard for . '', 
  i hope she never watches tom cruise 's film `` born on the fourth of july '' . 
  americans are known to have committed all kinds of military atrocities , including rape . 
  but 10,000 rapes ? 
  in which war ? 
  i 'd like a source on this claim if you could provide it for us . 
  it 's important to notice that violent tendencies are promoted by video games and movies . 
  * never * by this kind of attitude in real life . 
  rapes by americans in wwii is a pretty deep and emotional topic , but definitely something worth to take a look at , since popular media portrays them as the ultimate moral freedom fighters . 
  thanks for the sources , those are good places to start digging . 
  they chose the absolute worst blue they could find to repaint him ... 
  i did n't know he was painted blue in the us . 
  here in mexico , they did n't censor anything . 
  which is kind of awesome : being such a catholic country , dbz got away with stuff like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m4vby.jpg ) . 
  oh , hercule is known as mr. satan here ... go figure . 
  who 's the other one ? 
  you 've got a point ; the way i phrased could be easily misinterpreted as tom cruise producing or directing it , as many actors become directors nowadays . 
  i should have said `` i hope she never watches the film `` born on the the fourth of july '' , starring tom cruise '' . 
  neither am i , he was a certified son of a bitch . 
  but it 's hard to be condescending to americans given how the situation developed past 9/11 . 
  bush : bin laden did this , let 's bring him to justice !, 
  let 's nail that bastard . 
  bush : yeah ... now that we 're close why not taking advantage of our position and topple saddam ? 
  america : why ? 
  bush : because he 's got nukes . 
  america : ok , we have to bomb something to show strength anyway . 
  [ no nukes on iraq , the death toll on iraqi civilians makes 9/11 pale in comparison ; isis rises to power ], 
  america : \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  truth to be told , america has performed great displays of patriotism in some crises like the first responders at 9/11 or the blood donors for the pulse massacre . 
  i do n't know when they were brainwashed into thinking that only patriots join the military . 
  this is tangential to the comment but i 've come to think that if people achieve to lift the ban on the cdc researching gun violence and it comes to the scientifically grounded conclusion that the estimated lives saved by a full-scale gun ban vastly outweigh dgu 's , then the patriotic thing to do would be to give up your gun for the common good . 
  literally exposing yourself and your loved ones to die for the good of fellow countrymen ( and it does n't involve killing , unlike war ! ) . 
  it 's funny how `` collectivist '' measures could very well be seen as patriotic through a slightly different glass . 
  \u266b * i wish i was in dixie . 
  hurray ! , hurray !, 
  i love stories , but i think your post will do much better if you took it to the `` anything goes '' thread . 
  here is going to get deleted because it breaks article xi of our constitution . 
  if you think the northern border guard is bad , maybe you should hang out with the * southern * border patrol . 
  i 've heard they 're a charming bunch . 
   ignoring the thoroughly debunked myth about sweden being the rape capital of the world . 
  they claim sweden is the rape capital of europe though . 
  i do n't think even alt-righters would be so stupid to not take into consideration the war-torn african countries . 
  yes , but muh people per capita ... 
  i hope we do n't share the same fate . 
  two different compilations on the same porn scene . 
  is n't mandy charming ?

  there 's a moment in every patriot 's life when , in order to take a stand , they have to remain seated . 
  if you lack confidence in anything , take baby steps and make sure you can accurately measure your progress so that you know you 're going forward and avoid becoming impatient . 
  when you know you 're improving confidence follows . 
  social skills are very important and you 're in a great age to start developing them ( `` how to make friends and influence people '' by dale carnegie is a great book to get started ) . 
  beauty is a complicated subject and you should n't think that beautiful people 's lives are nice and easy , because they 're usually not . 
  yet still , it 's perfectly understandable that you 'll want to maximize your looks to get the optimal social response . 
  just for a heads up :, 
   this reasoning bears strongly on features of female faces and bodies that are generally perceived as attractive ( although there are certainly individual and cultural differences ) , including the following :, 
   \u2022 relatively large eyes, 
   \u2022 smooth skin, 
   \u2022 full lips, 
   \u2022 a curvy figure ( approaching a 0.7 waist-to-hip ratio ), 
   \u2022 a symmetrical face and body, 
   although these features vary across cultures considerably , attraction is still universally predictable from an evolutionary perspective . 
  research on women at miss universe contests ( along with other convergent research ) has demonstrated that many of the qualities rated as attractive ( such as a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7 ) are considered attractive across all corners of the globe . 
  i 'm too lazy to cite properly but it 's taken from the book `` mating intelligence unleashed : the role of the mind in sex , dating , and love '' by glenn geher and barry scott kaufman ; chapter 4 ; ed : oxford university press , 2013 . 
  welcome to the circlejerk . 
  same thing here , english as second , spanish as native . 
  i think english is more concise in communication . 
  i studied engineering and english books were much easier to digest than spanish ones . 
  there are some pieces of media where i really love spanish dubbing more than the original voice acting . 
  cases in point : lord of the rings trilogy , gears of war series . 
  and terrorists . 
  though it seems they have calmed down already :d, 
  rapists too , if i 'm not mistaken .
