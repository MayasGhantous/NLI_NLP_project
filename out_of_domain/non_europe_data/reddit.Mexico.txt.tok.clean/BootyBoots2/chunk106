  i know , but i had to come up with my `` witty '' comment . 
  still , even though i 'd understand if she got discharged ( is n't that too much of a stretch ? 
  are n't there less severe punishments to suit her offence ? 
  ) , revoking her security and * arresting * her seems too much . 
  but in the end , it 's up to the laws of the court martial ( ! ), 
  to decide her fate . 
  that 's all they need . 
  they do n't reproduce at rabbit rates , oh no ... 
  they reproduce at * bacteria * rates !, 
  as he puts it : the catholic church is a church , not an ngo ( though it does lots of ngo-ey stuff ) . 
  ok , new plan , everybody :, 
  why do n't we let republicans elect the democratic nominee and democrats elect the republican nominee ? 
  that way you would n't need to be cornered between $ hillary and cheeto benito . 
  i would have loved it to be kasich vs. sanders . 
  how about you ? 
  yet another perfect comment . 
  oh , royal highness u/wissam24 , i seek audience with thee to importunate with an inquiry : can we vote and comment in threads were the same article had been shared in other subreddits or does that count as brigading ? 
  yeah , that was my first thought . 
  although it 's a little bit different : everybody is on the same page discussing the article , unlike the linked threads where we make fun of the poster . 
  there had to be a republican nominee either way . 
  [ who would you have chosen instead ] ( http://cdn.redalertpolitics.com/files/2015/07/gop-2016-why-so-many_dobs.jpg ) ? 
  thanks for the update sgt. 
  i 've been pinging jebus quite a bit , and since there 's quite a large mod team , i tried with wissam . 
  actually , it 's about choosing any arbitrary metric in which the us is the best at in order to grant the us authority over anything . 
  e.g : gdp , olympic gold medals , military presence , etc. 
  i love how americans are so concerned about knife attacks : they say they need a gun for protection when [ actual protection has been out there for a very long time ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/04/39/47/0439479ba95822587c1967648a25879e.jpg ) , unlike guns ; where there 's hardly any effective protection against large calibers . 
  there 's also the 10 ft rule ... 
  i love how sexy and chilled she is . 
  great post . 
  i liked how you sniped the highlights a la srd . 
  could you fit them all in a basket ? 
  was n't that county the one `` overrun by muslims '' ? 
  it 's like omar mateen , who pledged allegiance to both isis and hezbollah , not minding about those two being at odds with each other . 
  wissam is out , contact u/sgt _ colon . 
  knee jerk rebuttal , but a valid one . 
  since america 's conception of free speech seems to be `` express * whatever * you want without consequences '' , displaying their pride about their `` heritage '' over a symbol that stood for the enslavement of human beings should be allowed . 
  for the particular case of american free speech , i think that both displays ( flying the confederate flag or stomping the old glory ) should be protected equally . 
  but alas , the american civil war is the best example of the case where challenging or overturning rights turned out to be the right thing to do . 
  stepping on the flag was ok , but he missed a ** great ** opportunity : reminding kids they do n't need to say the pledge of allegiance every day . 
  even though this is total sad , it makes sense to profit on idiocy . 
  whoever first exploited this idea is a smart person . 
  i knew college tuitions were going through the roof in the us , but i never expected elementary and middle schools to be just as inaccessible . 
  yeah ... 
  it looks like liberty of expression is moving from challenging status quo to express hatred freely ( while slowly sanctioning its original meaning ) . 
  it 's probably the argument about french being surrendering cowards . 
  a stereotype that frankly amazes me , since france did manage to bring europe to its knees during the napoleonic era . 
  there were mixed reactions ; if you saw the video there were ones giving him a pass , others who just thought it was `` disappointing '' and even one who had his jersey but modified it with tape in order to show his discontent . 
   france is literally the reason why the us gained independence . 
  as mexicans , we also owe napoleon our gratitude because he kept the spaniards busy with joseph in ferdinand 's throne , allowing our people to fight a long war of attrition , instead of having the insurrection swiftly crushed by spanish forces . 
  with the mexican forefathers on the north and bol\u00edvar the liberator on the south , napoleon making europe his bitch and a touch of disastrous economic policies , the spanish empire fell at once . 
  it 's been quite a bumpy road for us ever since , though . 
   polio still exists people . 
  an aunt of a friend of mine got polio and one of her legs is screwed up for life . 
  it 's a sad thing . 
  first of all : relevant username . 
  some religious lobbyists can be pretty anti-science , but i 've never heard of any religious person rallying people to stop getting vaccines . 
  proof ? 
  please do n't cite wikipedia or breitbart . 
  free airfare to an african nation of their choice for anybody who requests it would probably be much more costly than the reparations they were asking for in the first place . 
  african nations will be delighted to receive millions of people who do n't share anything with them except for not being white ( and that 's not counting white settlements like the german-namibian population ) . 
  i hazily remember about the story of a police officer who killed his daughter because she broke in the house for some reason and it was dark . 
  i wonder how many people die that way . 
  your dad is a certified badass . 
  according to [ this site ] ( http://www.distancefromto.net/ ) , the distance from sierra leone to kenya is 5590 km ; while the distance from central germany to the westernmost chinese county ( kashgar ) is 5112 km . 
  he was lucky to not die . 
  there was one about modern spain being an arab country . 
  it even inspired a user 's flair . 
  history is written by the victors . 
  history is filled with lies . 
  all you need to change the world is one good lie and a river of blood . 
  their majesty can return from official meetings in foreign lands whenever they please , your grace . 
  what is thine royal edict on my inquiry ? 
  if they took a similar quote from the qu ` ran , everybody would lose their minds . 
  there are some posts where the exact same website is shared and discussed by other subreddits , [ like in this article ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shitamericanssay/comments/54jxqz/if_you_change_your_kids_diaper_you_are_a_child/ ) . 
  below the big , star-spangled r/shitamericanssay banner , there are two tabs : `` comments '' and `` other discussions '' . 
  if we click on that tab , we can see the links to other subreddits where the material in question is being discussed . 
  i thought it would be cool to interact with users of other subreddits but i thought it may count as brigading so i refrained from doing so . 
  can we vote and comment on those threads , or should we stay in our cozy subreddit ? 
  [ official campaign picture ] ( http://65.media.tumblr.com/d3079ca5226cba771567d6d87b33793f/tumblr_muiqv8c0sf1r00l9eo1_500.jpg ), 
  him , kasich and rand paul struck me as the sanest of the bunch . 
  in order of perceived sanity : rp  kasich  mr. 
   he was against one of the most socially conservative people in congress rick santorum, 
  [ i think that statement does n't really do justice to the man ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxkpzxdae9u ) . 
   it 's hard being calm when every minute in america and on reddit a poor italian dish is violated and raped . 
  to be fair , that was a pretty dramatic statement . 
  yet still , i can relate to the feeling every time i see [ this ] ( http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/06/09/quesaritopoppromo-1/lead_large.jpg ) . 
  i thought it stood for `` shit nationalists say '' , but it 's not so far off ... 
  as a mexican , i 'd totally hit that place at paddy 's day to remember [ los patricios ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_patrick%27s_battalion ) with a drink to their memory . 
  also , have some tacos while i 'm at it . 
  i know this is written in satire , but i feel the need ~ ~ the need for speed . 
  [ awww !!,

  this may sound weird , but i love your ... bone structure . 
  you have a natural tight gap and it shows you take good care of your body . 
  keep it up !, 
  ^ ^ ^ or down ... 
  great picture . 
  looks more like material for r/curvy than this sub , though . 
  guys , remember the quarrel we had with the studs at r/aznidentity ? 
  well , one of them [ sent me an epic rant ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/9cg06 ) that i just had to share with you !,
