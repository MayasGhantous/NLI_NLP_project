  as a parallel example , i consider a frying pan a cooking device even though one can use it a shovel . 
   you 're getting stuck in a genetic fallacy where you arepassing judgement based on original intent , even though there are a large number of other uses outside of that intent . 
  that 's not how the [ genetic fallacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_fallacy ) works . 
  if wikipedia is to be trusted , the genetic fallacy `` is a fallacy of irrelevance where ** a conclusion is suggested based solely on someone 's or something 's history , origin , or source rather than its current meaning or context . 
  ** '' in the claim `` guns are killing machines because they 're designed to kill people '' , its functionality and design purpose are completely relevant to the * current * context , as there is n't a mechanism that prevents guns from not doing so ( yet ) , rendering them useless to carry out its original purpose .

   i think his point is that a tool made for killing is not the same as a tool made for murder . 
  no , that 's actually the whole point of the argument : if the specific design purpose of the machine is depriving another human of life , then the terms `` murder machine and killing machine '' are interchangeable ; since the only difference between murder and lawful killing is legislation , which murderers do n't enshrine and nobody is exempt from the possibility of being a murder . 
  i have to admit that you pointed out a major flaw in my reasoning that i ca n't really get around right now : if a murdering machine could be called by that name because it was designed to deprive * specifically * humans of life despite it being used lawfully because of the possibility of others using it to commit murder , then hunting rifles should n't be murder guns because they were n't designed for that purpose ; although most of them could comfortably get the job done . 
  which begs the question `` why do i have to call my guns in such a horrible way when slightly different guns do n't have to bear that burden because their creator declared that they were designed for an entirely different purpose that fits well within the limits of the law ( which i 'm abiding by ) ? '', 
  and if i wanted to call all guns `` murder mechanisms '' because they were designed to do so and can be used that way then i would have to define a performance human fatality range , because there are guns that are not suitable to kill humans ( like pelleting guns for squirrels ) , and i 'm just writing what comes to my mind on an internet forum , not enacting the reverse 2nd amendment , so i wo n't think more about it . 
  besides , there 's also the chainsaw argument : chainsaws satisfy both conditions ( being designed to terminate -- plant -- life and having the possibility to be used to commit murder ) , but it would be unfair to call chainsaws murder machines because they were n't designed for that purpose ; which directly contradicts the paragraph where i tried to include hunting guns as murder weapons . 
  i guess in the end of the day the core belief was that it 's wishful thinking to entrust the general populace with machines designed to kill because your personal firearm is used in a recreational ( or lawfully violent ) way by yourself . 
  my argument was that if guns met two conditions : 1 ) designed to kill other humans and 2 ) they were readily available to the populace ( meaning that they could get one to commit murder ) ; then they could be called `` murdering machines '' because when both of those conditions were met , breaking the law would be fairly easy . 
  when you cited all of those items or machines -- planes , fertilizers , etc -- that have been used for murder but not designed for it , then you 're not satisfying condition 1 ) , which is not part of my argument . 
   the idea that there needs to be a mechanism to prevent guns from killing to negate your genetic fallacy is absurd . 
  no , it is n't . 
  in the hypothetical case that such device existed , then it would be impossible to commit murder with a tool originally designed for murder/killing , so calling that fact out to discourage the use of guns once that device were working would actually be an example of a genetic fallacy at play . 
  since such device does n't exist and it 's possible to commit murder with a machine built with the purpose of taking lives , then both of the conditions i laid are relevant for the present time . 
  anyway , [ i backed down on my argument ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shitguncontrollerssay/comments/57a2dt/antigunners_are_always_so_violent_what_are_the/d8sp4va?context=3 ) . 
  it 's too much of a stretch to call all firearms used lawfully `` murder weapons '' . 
   edit : why am i being downvoted ? 
  you broke the circlejerk . 
   more people in sweden are fluent in english than they are swedish lmao . 
   edit : the only people that do n't speak english are migrants , why would they be expected to know it ? 
  swedes know it to a competent level , it 's not even a bad thing . 
  it shows strong english literacy like op . 
  if a country is fluent in two languages , its obvious that migrants would be more fluent in english than swedish , considering that it is the most common international language . 
  no idea why this is such a touchy subject for some individuals . 
    ** i 'm not american but it 's true , you can look through my history if you want ** lmao .

  oh , sarah ... you stupid , sexy governor . 
  i thought iowa was the farmland . 
  how many `` agricultural '' states does the us have ? 
  i think this has some merit ... 
  right off the bat , i ca n't see how vermont and new hampshire would be so different from one another , but i think you can have a unique experience if you really looked for it . 
  stereotypically , i did think of iowa as an agrarian state , but damn ... 
  it 's a serious heavyweight . 
  i did n't know illinois and southern minnesota were so fertile , though . 
  that person is not american . 
  what do you do in these cases ?

  by the way , do you prefer to be pinged in comments or reports ?

  even though i perceive that hillary is the `` least worst option '' , she 's no saint either . 
  the us has to be pretty critical of her every move once elected , and if the dnc rigged the election as wikileaks seem to suggest , even more so . 
  i wished a trump supported linked me to factual evidence of hillary being a criminal . 
  i think you 'd have to read the whole wikileaks archive , but it 's daunting to go through tenths of thousands of e-mails ( and that 's just the first set on her ) . 
  lacey johnson has pretty everything ... 
  you can tell them that the equatorial line that divides the earth into north and south hemispheres passes through ecuador , for a reference ... 
  and yes , it neighbors colombia . 
  i thought only santorum was capable of such madness . 
  you guys just went full cod : mw . 
  at least they 're not equatorial guinea . 
  seriously , those guys are the worst : there were two guineas in africa already and they just had to copy the other ones * and * name it after the line to differentiate it from the vanilla guinea . 
  least creative name ever !, 
  i think it 's a human need to feel part of something , and of course , nationality is a great club once you learn the concept of `` culture '' . 
  so when a person within your group achieves something ( like muh moon ) it serves as a reason for pride even if the citizen in question had absolutely nothing to with it , except sharing their nationality with the achiever . 
  likewise , people naturally get the ostrich bias when the nationality they form a part of did inhuman things , because which sane person could be proud of being in the murders , rapists , torturers , oppressiveness club ? 
  everybody wants to be a part of the good guys , except that more than good vs. evil , wars have always been about power , influence , dominance , greed and maybe the need for survival in some cases . 
  props to the germans for being so self-conscious about the nazis , though . 
  now i 'm stuck listening to the laughs that cue at the end of every joke i read on this thread . 
   just because he 's a comedian , it does n't mean he not an opinion maker , so he is not exempt from scrutiny . 
  hhhhhmmm ... 
  i do n't think he acts as an `` opinion maker '' because people 's opinions depend on their personal convictions and cognitive processes and are probably more influenced by the direct environment they live in , but he ( like any other political media outlet ) acts as an `` opinion reinforcer '' . 
  i follow him , trevor noah , bill maher , colbert and samantha bee -- all of them left-wing political comedians except for maher 's views on islam -- and as the election day becomes closer , i 've noticed how they 've all become much less rational and more righteous towards anything that trump does or says ( especially about the pussygate comments ) . 
  if [ this ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/56no7a/at_what_moment_did_you_realize_you_were_dating_an/d8llgq3?context=3 ) serves as evidence , i think that user is an american . 
  too late ; freeman001 or viking have already heard the call to ( fire ) arms . 
  he 's an englishman paying taxes and not allowed to be represented in the us . 
   but the thing is that , if you are us left-leaning and you only look at leftist pundits ( such as colbert , noah and bee ) your opinion will invariably be made by them as they provide information that only agrees with their agenda and you trust them to be fair . 
  the only part in which i disagree with your statement is that this behavior is definitely not limited to the us left-wing . 
  it actually describes the human bias regarding * any * political party that people are aligned with in terms of convictions . 
   they are the media . 
  what they say becomes the prevailing narrative . 
  uhhhhhhh . 
  this statement feels true to me ( looking at , for example , goebbels propaganda machine or any successful propaganda machine for that matter ) ; but i think we should be very careful to not generalize so much , because if we do , then our opinions about an opposing party or group could become entrenched and then we wo n't be open to discussion and negotiation , especially if we 're on the wrong -- or least beneficial -- end of the argument ( remember that unless we 're talking about psychopaths , people tend to think their opinions are always right ) . 
  yeah , i saw samantha call it that way and i just repeated it to emphasize how much of a stir people are making about that recording . 
  on a more serious light , my perception is that this recording could make the difference if it manages to lure the undecided voters who were easily shocked by the tape , then hillary has the election in her pocket . 
  but then again , this could the covert , hidden message they want to push around to trigger the bandwagon effect . 
  that 's a personal problem of mine . 
  you see , i do n't look deeper into rabbit holes , i venture to the [ mansions of the dwarves ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/1d/09/64/1d0964832c8d8dd32284c95bc8a42ed9.jpg ) . 
   you mention bee calling that tape `` pussygate '', 
  sorry , it was [ * pussyghazi * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltu3ms9rt5w ) . 
  i particularly enjoyed [ this joke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltu3ms9rt5w#3m46s ) because it 's quite sexist if you think about it ( and social justice is apparently quite important for the american left ) , yet the crowd bursts into applause . 
  edit : i do n't know about assange ... 
  if you check the comments on the r/all top post from yesterday about his internet connection , you 'll see that some people are very critical of him because he used to be more careful about the leaks , and now he does n't censor irrelevant personal information about the people featured in the leaks . 
  i really do n't have much of a comment on him because i 've read very few leaks and my information bias tells me i should read all of them ( tenths of thousands ) before i make a judgment on his leaks or more usefully , hillary 's accountability . 
  will [ master dogg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1ei5rwo7zi ) await for us in there ?
