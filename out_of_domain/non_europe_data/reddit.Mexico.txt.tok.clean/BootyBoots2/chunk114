  i hope it stays that way ( at only one incident ; friendly reminder : property damage is just as unacceptable ) . 
  may i know why ? 
  an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind , do n't you think ? 
  well , the discriminative behavior in question is perhaps a combination of xenophobia and islamophobia ( i think they 're assuming that there are no american-born muslims ) , but i agree with your statement . 
  that 's a charming picture . 
  proof ? 
  yes , i follow maher and i know his stance on islam but i 've never heard that kind of comment before . 
  what 's your definition of sexual assault ? 
  i do n't know the legal definition but i think women should have to verbally express rejection and men should * still * look for courtship and touching for it to become sexual assault . 
  i know rape is a difficult and sensitive issue , plus it 's well documented that it 's hard for rape victims to speak out and report the crime of which they 're victims but it 's necessary to establish some hard limits because normal human courtship would be much simpler if we could get away with saying stuff like :, 
  `` hey , i 'm attracted to you , and ... well , how to say this . . er ... 
  i hope you do n't find this inappropriate , i mean , i would n't like you to think i 'm a pervert but , can i kiss you in the mouth ? 
  * i mean , it 's totally ok if you do n't want to * , but it 's just that you 're very pretty and i like you so much that i 'm willing to run the risk to impregnate you ( given you expressly consent sexual intercourse with me , of course ) because you 're so beautiful and also because your personality is to just die for : i mean , you 're smart and cheerful and you achieve a lot of goals and i admire you a lot , do n't think it 's purely sexual ... oh , one last thing : could you teach me how to kiss ? 
  i 've never done it in my entire life so i would n't want to mess it up . '', 
  but unfortunately , it does n't work that way . 
  well , [ kissinger was an expert on the media panels ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usaai3m51jo#t=26m42s ) when the war on iraq erupted , so when we found it was a lie all along , it 's reasonable to me that people started to become more skeptical of politicians ; besides , politicians being educated does n't mean they ca n't make mistakes on policy . 
  i 'd venture to say that people became so tired of educated politicians screwing up ( either because of corruption , incompetence or simply bad luck ) that they just voted `` an outsider '' with no clue of how to run a country because , at least , that person is not colluded within the corruption . 
   the idea that those kind of of behaviors need to be unspoken and non-rational is pretty destructive , i think . 
  me too . 
  but as a person who had to figure out how human courtship works from scratch -- and i 'm still figuring , although i have much more confidence in myself -- i think the liberal hardliners stance on this issues just makes it too difficult to develop oneself if one does not have a clue on non-verbal communication , because we learn mostly from rejection and failure ( very little from success ) so if you 're a woman and you 're being `` hit on '' and the guy just does n't get it on non-verbal terms as it `` should be '' , then i think it 's not much to ask to be upfront and go for the verbal rejection . 
  the worst part about this line of thinking is that it 's very emotional and it sounds like * common sense * . 
  it is also the line of thinking that lead the us to the second irak war . 
  this is the line that supports your statement :, 
   i have just described a plausible scenario in which much of the world 's population could be annihilated on account of religious ideas that belong on the same shelf with batman , the philosopher 's stone , and unicorns . 
  because nuking millions of innocent people is justified with western fears ( and there 's no way an islamic nation would launch a nuclear strike `` pre-emptively '' out of the exact same fear and not out of religious zealotry ) , and also because the violent , volatile and outdated beliefs of muslims -- minor jihad -- are less moral than the violent , volatile and outdated beliefs of americans ( the militia argument for the 2nd amendment on modern times or the whole idea behind pre-emptive strikes ) . 
  speaking about digital media , that argument does make sense : those are american platforms that run on american interests , and the reason why they 're so successful is that people can choose from all the wide range of content available and stay away from content they dislike . 
  not the case of television , though ... 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  they mastered engineering to create a `` water wall '' that instead of rising up , becomes deeper . 
  they call it `` ocean '' . 
  holy shit hahaha . 
  they can still live in the same house , just not the white one ... 
  to be fair , i think trump would like it ... 
  i can just imagine biden going for the hit anyway and obama ducking at the last moment when realizing what biden was up to . 
  the ball hits trump right to the face and obama has a terrified look and starts apologizing but deep down he 's satisfied . 
  obama : you can have colored sprinkles , chocolate sprinkles , any sprinkles you want !, 
  [ joe should be in jackass ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1chhbi88vg#t=18s ) . 
  you can also be a racist and behave and speak in a very civil manner to the people who are the object of your prejudice e.g : abraham lincoln . 
  but when you express racist sentiments consistently and you do nothing to avoid ^ ( 1 ) or reasonably justify ^ ( 2 ) your language , is n't it understandable for other people to interpret your statements as if you were racist all along ? 
  ( 1 ) perhaps you entered a culture where a specific behavior is considered racist and did it without knowledge . 
  i do n't think it 's fair for people to call you a racist if you apologize and are culturally sensitive from that point on . 
  ( 2 ) i do have a problem with the concept of `` microaggressions '' : i get the idea is to prevent dog-whistle racism , sexism , etc. 
  but i think it 's wrong to call entire languages `` sexist '' for example if the nouns are simply masculine and feminine because that 's its structure and do n't account for the gender-fluid 's feelings . 
  never thought about it that way . 
  good call . 
  i wonder how that person feels now that his beloved president-elect ratified he 'll protect gay rights . 
  being vague is a weakness that he turned into his strength . 
  if his supreme court justice wants to overturn obergefell v. hodges , can trump do anything to keep his promise to defend gay marriage ? 
  ( legit question , by the way ), 
  yes , pence is his vp , some of his supporters have shown to be homophobic and the gop as a whole is against gay rights , but even with all of these `` clues '' we wo n't know if obergefell would be overturned until the case reaches the supreme court ( again ) . 
  for me , it seems like he 's just using the lgbt community as a political stepping stone to be discarded when they 're not useful anymore . 
  15 years ago trump becoming president was a recorded joke on a tv show renowned for featuring the most ridiculous hyperboles as comedic material . 
  never underestimate [ godess fortune ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adipoe2leps ) . 
  but he has expressed he wants to overturn roe v. wade and that 's settled law since 1973 ... 
  now , maybe it 's time for me to get my tinfoil hat , but i think trump 's plan to pander to the religious right is : `` hey , this gay stuff is good political capital ( especially after the pulse ) so spare me the marriage , but on the other hand i overturned roe v. wade !, 
  that 's got ta count , huh ? '', 
  it 's like when you 're at that rollercoaster ride and you realize that it was a bad idea as you slowly climb up and you want to get out , but it 's already too late to turn back , so you just resign and try to enjoy it . 
  you 're terrified but amused at the same time . 
  that 's the entire point of team america : world police . 
  you dropped this : / s, 
   and was the most direct cause of the rise of isis/isil , the syrian civil war and the european refugee crisis . 
  while i agree on the rise of isis/da ` esh , we have to remember that the syrian civil war and the european refugee crisis are a direct consequence of the arab spring . 
  the us ' actions may have worsened them , but they certainly did n't cause them . 
  urgently .

  edit : on a more serious note , why are you making such an emotional decision ? 
  it 's the future of more than one country that hinges on american elections , this is definitely important for yourself and millions of other people around the world ( did i say it 's important to ** yourself ** ? 
  ) , it 's not like random shitposting that you do for shits and giggles . 
  i 've read tons of annoying tumblerites and i 'm sometimes pissed off about what they 're saying , but i just brush them off and keep on with my life . 
  and if you say you were screwed by obama , let me remind you he was the one that was burdened to fix the housing bubble that was n't his fault to begin with ; he did n't screw up the automotive industry : he bailed them out . 
  bush 's solution to 9/11 was spending trillions of dollars on getting the us into a war that ended with the destabilizing of irak and rise of isis . 
  later on , obama would quietly send a seal team to kill him . 
  obama tried to pass many laws that blocked to the point of causing a government shutdown , and i wonder why hardly anybody blames the republicans for blocking him so hard . 
  that 's where we diverge . 
  i do think that there are people who are only worried about their economic status but they 're not racist , sexist , homophobic / other `` ists '' ot `` phobics '' . 
  those are the ones we need to win over . 
  i understand your comment . 
  nevertheless , i think subreddit culture evolves on some of them : srs used to doxx people and call for death threats ; when fph was banned , people were demanding for srs to be taken down as well but the admins decided not to do it on the grounds that the rule was not retroactive . 
  srd is still sanctimonious for my taste but they do n't brigade nearly as bad as they did two years ago . 
  if you go over to tia there 's a moderator -- or ex-moderator -- post that complains exactly about what you 're saying , but it was over a year ago . 
  i asked r/changemyview to tell me how is kia a hate subreddit and i could n't find any satisfying answer . 
  true , the whole gamergate thing was so bad that not even 4chan wanted them , but kia themselves do n't seem to be nearly as angry as gamergate , and my perception is that they even take care of their image to not be automatically discarded : there was a thread were roosh v chimed in to be a sponsor or something and the reaction was mixed as some of them were indifferent to him and other were dubious of him because they thought that would give more ammunition to their detractors .
