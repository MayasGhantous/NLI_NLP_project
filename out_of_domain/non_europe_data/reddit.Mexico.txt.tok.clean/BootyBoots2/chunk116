  and i think that t_d 's mods have already had long conversations with admins to reach an agreement on how far they can get without getting banned in order to operate on the absolute fringes of the rules . 
  there are already subreddits that fulfill that purpose : there 's r/againsthatesubreddits and r/hatesubredditoftheday . 
  once i was linked to r/shitguncontrollerssay . 
  it was a fascinating experience . 
  oh , give it time ... give it time . 
  i read your comment and thought the theme of the subreddits suited your purpose , but i see that 's not the case . 
  no , i have n't stumbled on a hate subreddit watchlist-styled subreddit as of now . 
  good luck with your sub !, 
  will do . 
  the title and the woman reminded me of matrix and the guy in a white suit who programmed the simulations . 
  more like stop `` winning '' . 
  fair point . 
   fuck this website . 
  oh , come on ; you already know we all love to hate reddit . 
  i do n't think downvoting is nearly as bad as banning . 
  when you 're banned you can not interact with the subreddit anymore , whereas if you 're downvoted , people will simply need to scroll down to see , and even then , they can sort by controversial and find your comment . 
  now , being pragmatic about reddit , it 's easy to see that subreddits naturally turn into echo-chambers prone to strengthen and radicalize ideas ; you can interact only with the subs you agree with , and the metasphere just makes it worse . 
  the_donald was designed to be an unapologetic propaganda subreddit right from the start , while r/politics was simply hijacked in response to t_d brazenness . 
  but remember that reddit 's structure * makes that happen * . 
  if you want respectful , critical debate ( not cloaked racism , xenophobia and other `` isms '' and `` phobias '' ) where people can discuss with facts with an open mind , then reddit -- and perhaps social media in general -- is not the place to go . 
  my conclusion is that it does n't matter that r/politics was hijacked by leftists ( thus not allowing for `` equal representation '' in a default sub ) when reddit 's structure allows for blocking what you do n't like and reinforcing what you believe . 
  hell , this is such a core component of reddit , that a few months ago t_d tried to shove trump down to every redditor 's throats by hijacking r/all , and the admins partially * adapted to them * by creating a better `` hotness '' algorithm for r/all instead of going through the simple , yet extremely risky route of getting rid of them . 
  to be fair , physical and/or verbal violence is intolerable , even when done to the likes of milo yiannopoulos . 
  does n't warrant being put on a fascist hitlist , though . 
  this one definitely has to go to yankbot . 
  was n't `` miss housekeeping '' a venezuelan ? 
  also , central america should have their own labels . 
  god-emperor has declared that only mexicans cross the border illegally . 
  edit : to be fair , this was labeled as `` the world according to americans 2012 '' . 
  it 's an incredibly human ( not humane though ) thing to say : one of the advantages of having a line of command is that the people who issue orders are not the ones who execute them , so everyone in the line can morally excuse themselves . 
  let 's take the case of a hospital droning that turned out to be full of innocent civilians ; so certain president ( let 's say the president of kenya for the sake of illustration ) orders a drone strike thinking that it 's an isis hideout on sloppy intel . 
  who is the war criminal ? 
  was it the president who ordered the strike , the intelligence agency who misreported the situation or the drone operator who pushed the button ? 
  the chain of command blurs that answer . 
  if the kenyan president carried the investigation and pushed the buttons on the console after consulting himself , then it 's pretty clear that he is the war criminal , but a chain of command lets people get away -- at least morally -- with the `` i was just following orders '' excuse . 
  taking into account the tense climate at the moment , i think it was reasonable to think that someone walking on to the stage could have been a threat to milo 's safety . 
   frankly , with a tour called the dangerous faggot , i kinda do n't care if he was physically threatened . 
  what he 's doing is worse and goes well beyond a simple threat , he 's actively harming others . 
  i understand your sentiment , but i can not avow of violence done to him because people feel that sometimes is ok to bend the rules for a greater purpose . 
  in fact , i 've observed that that 's partially the sentiment the movement as a whole wants to stir by creating a sense that conservatives and everything they believe is at stake so they have to protect their fellow people ; since they 're under attack and are heavily outnumbered ( according to them ) it 's ok to allow and/or use a little violence `` to do the right thing '' . 
  reddit ( and social media in general ) does n't foster civil , rational discourse . 
  sure , you can try and force your way like r/neutralpolitics attempts to do , but a website that allows to block the content that you do n't agree with and get instant notifications about the ones you do , only gets people to reinforce their ideas further . 
  if anything , reddit admins have shown to be extremely tolerant and only take action when there 's no other way around . 
  content like r/watchpeopledie is still allowed , srs is still allowed despite having a documented past history of doxxing and r/european was quarantined , not banned ( which means you need to jump through some hoops but you still can access the forum if you really want ) . 
  [ spez said they did strike down those subreddits because managing a handful of those takes away too much time to concentrate on other important matters on reddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ ) , not because he disagrees with them . 
  if the admins wanted to dictate the discourse on reddit , do n't you think that they would have banned the_donald a long time ago instead of bothering with modifying the hotness algorithm and briefly messing up the stickies in order to prevent t_d from littering the entirety of r/all , which was the stated goal of cwm as a head mod ? 
  do n't you think that if the admins wanted to foster meaningful discussion , it would be natural for them not to allow a political subreddit where dissent is a bannable offense ? 
  the sacrifice is worth it . 
  i think spez should n't have apologized . 
  if he decided to troll somebody , he should have had the spine to keep his head high for what he did , or otherwise refrained from doing it altogether . 
  but now he 's in a limbo where he legitimized the_donalds persecution complex and spawning yet more criticism which will shield them further from being banned , even if they rightfully deserve it . 
  i think the sas is not so much about being upset for other people having sex on a national symbol ( as it 's disrespectful ) , but about the irony of them complaining about this and not about other violations to the flag code like wearing us flag paraphernalia . 
  during the course of the fattening , spez claimed that the shutdown of fph and following crackdown on related subreddits was due to them wasting too much of the admins ' time to follow through other important functionality aspects . 
  if spez applied this logic consistently , he should have `` quietly '' written `` so be it '' on cwm 's explicit statement about taking over r/all and use that as a legitimate carte-blanche/excuse for his action . 
  still , i ca n't give him that much flak , being the reddit ceo is not an easy task , and i think the ghost of ellen pao still has a strong presence in reddit 's hq . 
  i would n't be surprised if kn0thing had a pstd flashback every time he goes to the cinema ; besides , the pressure to make revenue from the top owners of conde nast must be quite hard to bear , and like it or not , t_d is a literal goldmine . 
  welcome to reddit !, 
  [ a shit ton of times ] ( http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/files/2013/08/e984ce08fa8c68fe835b9f74c8c825ca.jpg ) . 
  sorry to prove you wrong , but `` atlas shrugged '' by ayn rand is quite popular among them . 
  having a tribal mentality only makes us biased and collectively prone to violence . 
  t_d is a polarizing sub , and if you hate them so much , you 're fulfilling its purpose in the same way that provoking terror is the terrorist 's goal . 
  oh , but productive discourse is needed . 
  it 's so needed , donald trump would n't be president elect , had it been used . 
  the only way to change a close mind is with an open mind , so we can not afford to close ours . 
  ca n't agree with you more . 
  the only thing i 'm advocating for is to have a more measured language : the bigots will keep being bigots and it 's ok to call the out * only * to let them know that you wo n't budge , period . 
  however , we have to win over those who voted trump in a welcoming and non-confrontational way , and a tribal mindset wo n't allow that at all . 
  for example , would you say that people in [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ppk2noqxs ) are bigoted ? 
  true , the problem is that fantasy is way too powerful . 
  people who now believe these sort of rhetoric were n't born like that : they were somehow indoctrinated by views that were n't too extreme , and once they were dragged to the other side of the argument , they reinforced their core beliefs by accepting more extreme ideas . 
  the alt-right is a hatchery for this : they bring on single-issue voters who do n't want to listen to their * inner criticism * and they validate their struggles ( let 's say those so-called economically strained voters from the rust belt ) while minimizing the red flags of siding with trump on mistreatment of women and xenophobia with a dash of racism . 
  when we call them bigoted simply for voting for him because of that single issue rather than his other views , we 're socially alienating them , and that 's when people like milo yiannopolous come into play to offer them a place of belonging . 
  then they 'll criticize the fringe ends of the ideological group that opposes them , thus creating and reinforcing the idea that * we 're irrational * . 
  once at this point , conspiracy theories and persecution complex propaganda starts being effective . 
  we hardly can do anything for these people . 
  but we can do something for those who are ripe for indoctrination ( namely indoctrinate them with * our * line of thinking ) by being welcoming and * presenting * our side of the narrative rather than * confronting * them with it . 
  thanks !, 
  fine , [ here 's a legible version of it ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/8u8de ) ( you 'll have to download the image , though ) . 
  we know it for a fact that donald trump only makes rational decisions . 
  the red pill holds that book like others do with the bible . 
  i 've never read it before . 
  spez and the rest of the admins wo n't do anything unless real-life consequences take place due to the_donald , and i 'm sure that they wo n't even ban them , but simply quarantine them . 
  i think that spez legitimately fears the_donald to the point that the subreddit is directly affecting * his * life . 
  or res . 
  like harassing some muslims or mexicans while having proof of it to the point that it 's considerable that users will keep posting related content unless banned . 
  and neither does spez , which is the reason why they 're not being banned despite having broken rules like blatant vote manipulation or spam the entirety of r/all ( now substantially reduced in comparison to three months ago ) [ which is supposed to warrant a ban ] ( https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205192985-what-constitutes-vote-cheating-or-vote-manipulation - ) , but it seems that the admin team is just scared of the massive shitstorm that wil ensue if they ban t_d . 
  thank you for your opinion . 
  i 'll still read it in order to form my own opinion about the book , and perhaps i 'll concur with yours . 
  no , i 'm talking about [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/4h1okg/announcement_vote_manipulation/ ) . 
  you can interpret it in any way you want . 
  the thing is , they operate on the absolute fringes of the rules : yes , there does n't seem to be enough evidence of them * directly * harassing a community , but they do `` suggest '' that a certain group of individuals is dangerous in accordance with trump 's agenda ( it 's almost like if they 're * happy * that today 's shooter turned out to be a muslim extremist ) ; if somebody decides to `` do justice by their own hand '' then it wo n't be t_d 's fault because they did n't incite violence directly , just outsourced prejudice in the form of memes . 
  i 've never seen any proof of bots being used , but back when it started , it was pretty obvious for regular users that there was no way that anyone would get so many upvotes without external help . 
  plus , t_d 's creator , ciswhitemaelstrom stated that his goal was to fill r/all with the_donald 's posts , which is spam for non-users . 
  instead , the admins decided to modify the hotness algorithm to avoid banning them . 
  fatpeoplehate was banned for less that that . 
  also , some users on t_d are death-threat happy , which is not supposed to be allowed on reddit . 
  donald trump looks way too awesome in this picture ; he looks evil rather than dumb , and even his hair looks good . 
  also , does n't this count as inciting violence ? 
  we should n't support what we complain about , regardless of how well done the art is and how much we agree with it . 
  it has happened before with another type of shitposting : robert dear murdered three people and injured another nine in the colorado springs planned parenthood shooting last year , and his motive was that pp `` sold baby parts '' , a claim made due to a certain fake news/conspiracy video that was later on proven false .
