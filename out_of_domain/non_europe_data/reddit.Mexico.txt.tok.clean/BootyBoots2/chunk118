  * nothing * . 
  you can just filter what you want , and people are no longer forced to see the content they dislike ; all of this while letting the content creators still submit what they want . 
  the admins had legitimate reasons to ban the_donald long ago , but now t_d 's most persistent talking point ( muh censorship ) has been disarmed because even when they should be regulated , they can still produce the amount of shitpost they choose to , * but we wo n't be forced to consume it * . 
  keep having an awesome day . 
  thank you very much for those resources , and also for the correction and proof that cwm did n't create t_d . 
  have a very nice day as well !, 
  then it seems that my definition of doxxing is incorrect : i thought doxxing was to publicize private information about real people such as bank accounts , addresses , etc. 
  on the forum ; not failing to censor the usernames on linked comments . 
  it does n't matter now . 
  you can filter whatever you dislike !, 
  but it does : r/all serves as a platform to sample content from different subreddits ; when a subreddit `` games '' the algorithm in order to block all other content in order to advertise itself , it 's spoiling the experience for the rest of the users . 
  r/gaming has over a million subs , thank god they did n't decide to litter the entire thing . 
  also , they catapulted their content via sticky abuse , not by simple voting . 
  lol , i 've got a new youtube favorite to play in repeat !, 
  you can do it now . 
  for a person who has been here long enough to talk down so condescendingly , it seems awkward to me that you do n't remember how passionate the berniebros at s4p were just a few months ago in the primaries . 
  you could ask r/enough _ sanders_spam , or look at [ this entire thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4oedco/lets_all_have_a_town_hall_about_rall/d4btdy2/?context=3 ) where people complain over and over about sanders spam . 
  the change in the algorithm happened * after * the change to stickies . 
  spez mentioned the changes to stickies in the orlando thread at [ june 13 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4ny59k/lets_talk_about_orlando/ ) ( [ bonus !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/4nyc5w/breaking_reddit_admins_cant_handle_the_donalds/ ) ) and in the bullet point below , he mentions the change to the algorithm that cwm was talking about in his takeover manifesto , submitted at [ june 15th ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/4o9r9a/i_like_the_new_reddit_tbh/ ) . 
  the most upvoted post with 12,711 upvotes -- and the only post with over 10,000 upvotes -- you have is [ the jeb !, 
  one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/471vn1/when_your_mommy_says/ ) ( great meme , to be honest ) . 
  the second one , short of 10,000 upvotes is the current head mod 's announcement of donald trump 's victory on election day 's eve . 
  may i know which post are you talking about ? 
  no more questions/comments/concerns , your honor . 
  if by opinions you mean polarizing and often offensive memes with no productive discussions , then yes . 
  i think it would look really cool if we shut down . 
  that would send a message . 
  yes , to be honest . 
  my future president ? 
  whatever dude , the fact that i can keep reddit clean is all that matters to me ; you can keep your victory circlejerk to yourself . 
  oh , by the way , it 's the electors who have the last say : everybody thought that trump would n't be elected and there he is , so do n't count your chickens before they hatch . 
  just today i was conversing with another user about the path we should follow and one of my proposed plans was to litter r/all with our posts and perhaps create more spam subreddits in order to provoke a collapse and hopefully get t_d banned along with us . 
  but then spez worked his magic , and now i think there 's no reason to contribute to r/enoughtrumpspam anymore ; which , quite frankly , makes me feel great . 
  i was n't on reddit for the time being . 
  how did enoughpaulspam end ? 
  so what ? 
  this sub is about the amount of trump spam . 
  what 's the point of enough trump spam if there is no more spam to complain about ? 
  if he gets elected president by the electors ( which is what will most surely happen ) , then let him take office and criticize his actions constructively ; do n't just oppose him for being trump . 
  if you do n't want to have civil , constructive discussions and actual speech rather than propaganda , then how are you different from those fanatical the_donald posters ? 
   you know what i did during the bernie spam last year ? 
  oh right ignored it . 
  i was annoyed with the bernie spam as well , but it was easier to cope with because it was just a bunch of dreamy folks who fought tooth and nail to get bernie to the candidacy . 
  not being an american , i understood that it was election year and this site is primarily american so i did n't speak out . 
  the_donald was and still is an entirely different beast : that subreddit understands and exploits well the most basic emotions , blowing things out of proportion every time a terror attack is committed by a muslim ( conveniently forgoing christian terrorism ) or fearmongering anything related to immigrants , being as loud as possible in their ramblings and not allowing dissent . 
  this whole meltdown exists because the_donald wants to keep pushing its content to r/all and litter it as much as possible ( though i admit the `` high energy '' dwindled after the change in the algorithm took place ) . 
  so we have a subreddit with low-effort shitpost with high effectiveness fearmongering that does n't allow dissent and is forced as much as possible into r/all for maximum exposure . 
  the_donald wanted to force its opinions and views to the rest of reddit . 
  of course that people wanted the admins to take measures . 
  as much as the_donald subscribers want to cry censorship it will still be incoherent because no content is being censored , instead , now let people self-censor what they do n't want to see . 
  damn . 
  [ the stickied post right after the election ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/enoughtrumpspam/comments/5bzope/the_future_of_this_sub/ ) made it clear that this sub derailed from its original purpose of making fun and countering trump propaganda by the_donald to full-on oppose trump . 
  i think it would make us look good if we put it to rest now because the trumpets would n't be able to use the argument of `` you only oppose trump based on your feeeeeeeeeeels '' . 
  i 'm pretty straightforward about my motives , check my post history . 
  just out of curiosity , why do you need this sub to protect your sanity when you can already block the_donald ? 
  beg to differ . 
  point in case : cameron diaz in the mask . 
  it 's likely that all of the other previous panels were a setup for the last one . 
  i am not an american but these quotes make him look like he does n't have any respect for life whatsoever ( which kind of makes sense , him being a career military man ) , yet the comments both here and on imgur praise the man ( he even seems to get praise from liberals , which is saying a lot ) . 
  could anybody give me a run-down on why this man is so capable and admired and how he may be an improvement over the past secdef ? 
  i want to see the outrage when it 's * muslims * who start abusing `` religious freedom '' to deny services like serving pork or alcohol . 
  sounds like the bush era all over again . 
  hey , what 's up with your last picture ? 
  there 's an angry bull coming after you and you 're just chilling ... 
  misleading star wars reference . 
  great jiggling , though . 
  * ** go out there and talk to strangers ** , it 's useful if you develop a routine to make you feel safer ( the point of the routine is to get information from questions to move into rapport and playfulness ; * which is something you feel , not something know * ), 
  * most likely , you 're going to engage in some embarrassing situations , take deep breaths and fight off the need to return to your safe space and chastise yourself . 
  ** learn from your mistakes ** ( it 's ok to theorize at this point ) and expose yourself more , integrating your knowledge to avoid making the same mistakes . 
  ** the rewards are worth it ** . 
  * learning from books is good aide , but in reality , it 's more like a tool than it is your workhorse . 
  ** experience is what will get you through the other side , so cheer up . 
  ok , my situation is a little different to yours so i 'll give you a little context and then you can take what you want and scrap the rest . 
  i used to identify myself as a clear intp but now i 've developed some sort of social muscle i think i might as well be an entp , the point is , i felt lonely and like i was missing out * on girls * specifically . 
  so two years ago i ventured on a quest to become a `` pick up artist '' to get a lot of hookups and whatnot ; it did n't come out as expected , but it definitely made me grow . 
  so i was surfing on the internet one night and browsed the pirate bay to download some porn when i thought : `` what comes out if i type `` seduction '' and sort by books ? '', 
  it was a tongue-in-cheek gesture but i downloaded several of them that caught my attention . 
  and i read , read and read and dipped myself in an entirely new world . 
  when i felt ready i called by bro as a wingman to put my knowledge to the test . 
  boy , i crashed and burned . 
  see , being good with people in a given social situation ( parties , gatherings , sales events , hookups , etc. ), 
  depends mostly * on how your brain is wired * . 
  there are certain activities that you can do easily and other that are mentally taxing , and at first , talking to strangers was very mentally taxing , and it feels ** awful ** when you get rejected . 
  for some , the cringe can be felt physically as much as * actual pain * . 
  so , the tide changed when i got out one day and thought about my very own routine and tried it on a gorgeous girl . 
  now , books usually disregard routines because , to the listener , they feel insincere and fake . 
  that happens , of course when you want to recreate a routine you read somewhere or saw on tv . 
  people can detect that , however , in my case , my routine let me connect with this girl and share some common interest , which let her know that i 'm an interesting person * to her * . 
  this is a really important concept : ** it does n't matter getting rejected constantly because you only want to filter all people to find the ones that actually like you ** , and yes , it does n't matter who you are . 
  ** there * are * people out there who want to meet you ** ; it 's just that you do n't know who they are , yet . 
  as you go out there and fuck it up socially , learning from your mistakes , sucking up the cringe and later on experiencing your first victories , you 'll get more confidence in yourself , which will make the process a lot smoother and easy . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  r/intp is the suicide prevention hotline . 
  edit : on a second thought , more than the suicide prevention hotline , it 's the chronic social anxiety support group . 
   it is yet another way to place all the responsibility of safe sex and parenthood , on women, 
  how come ? 
   that applies even if you use contraceptives and they did n't work . 
  that 's pretty harsh , since no contraceptive is 100 % efficient . 
  not even surgical ones .
