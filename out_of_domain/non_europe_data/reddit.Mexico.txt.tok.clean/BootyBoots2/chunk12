  edit 2 : this sidebar material , is n't it ? 
  this excerpt is from a book written from an intp ( geologist ) for intp 's :, 
  intp courtship behaviors, 
  keirsey ( 1998a ) notes that the ntps do not expend much effort to seek out a partner ; it would just, 
  require too much time and effort for too little a chance of return . 
  because of this , some ntps may, 
  simply settle down with the first person who approaches them without trying for anything better . 
  suspect that there may also be a certain element of fear operating here , i.e. 
  `` what if this is my only, 
  chance ? 
  what if no one ever wants me again ? '' this fits in with the keirsey 's description of the ntp, 
  as despairing of finding someone who fits their unique personality . 
  intps are not very good at initiating relationships . 
  the process seems to be one of compiling data on, 
  the person of interest ... procrastinating ... compiling more data ... procrastinating ... finally daring to make a, 
  move ( or not ) ... 
  this sort of style seems like it would be conducive to anonymous love notes . 
  googling `` huntsman spider bite '' yields ( they are ** graphic ** nsfw ) [ this image ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zmp69wpnxbg/hqdefault.jpg ) , [ this image ] ( https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-00lvmzjcmda/rhpzukfq8zi/aaaaaaaafoe/uwtavbwhgfi/s800/bite4.jpg ) , and [ this image ] ( https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-7xsrvtlpemu/riyt1aaeoli/aaaaaaaafoe/hwzo_jvwtic/s800/bite7.jpg ) , amongst others . 
  nevertheless , some australian sources like [ this one ] ( http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/wildlife/2012/08/australian-spiders-the-10-most-dangerous/ ) assure that huntsman spiders ' venom is not very dangerous , and they 're prone to flee instead of biting if they feel threatened . 
  moreover , two the images apparently correspond to funnel spider bite ( the most dangerous ) and to the recluse spider ( wtf ? 
  just ranked one position above the hunstman ? ), 
  of course , the images , being graphic and on the internet , may be misleading about the actual effects of the venom . 
  god , i miss the crocodile hunter . 
  most likely he knew about this stuff like no other . 
  may his reckless and adventurous ass rest in peace . 
  uhh ... actually , no . 
  the archetype for faithful according to [ this site ] ( http://www.16personalities.com/articles/types-of-loyalty-and-types-of-people ) are the guardians , because they hold stability as paramount . 
  but in the end cheating depends on many factors , including the couple 's story , hormones , the couple dynamics , personalities , beliefs ... 
  there 's a whole context behind , it ca n't be simplified like that . 
  the problem is that if your web is misplaced or not attractive enough for any fly to stumble upon it , you will starve to death . 
  besides , relationships are important to human beings , and there are most likely people who are better for you ( and you 're better for them in return ! ), 
  than the 1st person who takes a shot at you . 
  true . 
  and now , i 'm getting in the dark territories of the red pill with [ this article ] ( http://www.maggieloves.com/the-epidemic-of-single-30-somethings-can-and-should-we-try-and-fix-this ) and [ this article ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1213212/the-ego-epidemic-more-inflated-sense-fabulousness.html ) , that somehow covers both perspectives of the same problem . 
  this only means that it 's a problem , in general , but we intp 's have to struggle twice ( does n't matter if you 're male or female ) as much as other people . 
  hmmmm ... what if we follow u/s4g3t34 's advice and create sort of a tinder platform for intp 's ? 
  `` compiling data is an end for myself , as opposed to a means to an end '' sounds more natural to me in english . 
  do you speak spanish , by chance ? 
  and regarding the content of your comment , i see the compilation of information as both and end itself and a means to an end . 
  ( like a first step for the development of an ability , and such ), 
  i 've had a single girlfriend in my entire life ( 24 , though ) and she was an enfp . 
  i would have married her , and i still love her , but the girl i fell in love with only stays with me for as long as she perceives i 'm making my mind about her . 
  when she perceived she secured me , bam . 
  her corporate alter ego would kick in with everything i love ... 
  logical inconsistency , her wanting me to read her mind , nothing being good enough for her , damn . 
  but i 'm starting to think this is an average problem in society , and since i love being alone , well ... 
  [ i 'll let maverick say it for me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whyzc08jk_y#t=2m13s ), 
  well , i liked jeff corwin 's show , he did sort of the same thing but i think he 's american . 
  there are other shows of crazy cameramen who take insane close-ups of wild animals . 
  ( and i mean yards long close ups ), 
  i think those people , besides being bold and adventurous know animals too well . 
  there 's a certain element of risk , nevertheless knowing how animals will react lets you take good enough safety measures . 
  but you can get too overconfident by being too experienced . 
  ( happens in many other jobs though ) that manta was one of the most gentle animals in his documentary , and he had very bad luck , as it stung right in a vital organ , had it missed , he 'd probably still be alive . 
  and a very valuable one . 
  edit : just curious , do you live in kamchatka ? 
  i 'm not `` good at money '' either , because i do n't know how to manage my finances in an intelligent way ( this includes management of credit ) that leads me to optimize my spending and produce more money , while paying debts efficiently . 
  that being said , i have little problems with money because i receive more money than i spend , i tend to hoard money and ( thank heavens ) i 'm simply not driven to spend it on stuff i do n't need , i just do n't have that energy . 
  at first , i was reluctant to adopt any animal . 
  the less unnecessary responsibilities , the better . 
  but then a mouse came in and i lost it . 
  so i decided ( meditating it thoroughly even when in distress ) to adopt [ ver\u00f3nica ] ( http://imgur.com/899qvyr ) . 
  and i love her . 
  she needs to be loved but she 's not too needy . 
  she shows affection but she 's not sickly sweet . 
  you need to pour time and patience to train dogs , ( unlike most cats they can be trained to the point of awesome , to be fair . ), 
  my cat learned how to use her litter box at day two . 
  her odor is a perfect repellent for mice . 
  i wish she was more sociable and less hydrophobic , but it 's fine . 
  nobody 's perfect . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : my cat is more intp than me . 
  and i love her . 
  p.s : i love dogs too , but i do n't think i 'd commit to adopt one . 
  i 'm studying aeronautical engineering . 
  not breezing through it , though . 
  i think engineering is the practice of inventing and developing new devices , whether they 're physical , economical , etc. 
  software is a huge application of it nowadays , perhaps it 's not traditional , but it 's definitely necessary . 
  people like us need to learn to shake [ smaug ] ( http://periannath.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/hobbit-panel-16-470x353.jpg ) off once in a while and invest in stuff that can really be an upgrade in our lives . 
  although this is a repost , this solemn date makes up for it . 
  we honor those who served , because the bravery of their deeds when they were alive is what lets us breathe the air of peace and safety . 
  you got me . 
  i made my guess based on reddit 's time display and your information about the comment made at 3:00 a.m. 
  i 'm not very good at risk . 
  but i was always hell bent on defending the falklands another island close to iceland . 
  hey , that 's my squad !, 
  damn it barathar , you 're always taking pictures while flying ... 
  vessels like the tie defender , tie advanced , and the interdictor were designed to accomplish very specific missions , and their pilots go trough rigorous training to be qualified for their use . 
  i have flown the hunter and the interceptor and i have requested a defender unit to recapture wedge antilles . 
  what can i say ? 
  i 'm specialized in hunting the rebel scum . 
  tapping into their comms and listening their final scream before the explosion feels rewarding . 
  especially when you avenge fellow fallen pilots in your unit . 
  i 'm actually good at being uplifting to other people :, 
  do you feel ugly ? 
  listen to my knowledge and rationalization of why you 're actually beautiful . 
  ( highlight the good points and bring the negative points as an opportunity to improve , or take advantage of something ), 
  i even read it in a pubescent voice . 
  but , you 'll have to admit it has some comedic value for some people . 
  like the mlg no scope 360 xxpussyslayerxx type of gamers who overreact to things . 
  beware , wall of text .
