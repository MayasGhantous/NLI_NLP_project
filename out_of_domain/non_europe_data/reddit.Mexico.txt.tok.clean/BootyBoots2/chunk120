  i may even dare to say that there are some of us who are , in a certain aspect , good with people naturally ; it 's just a matter of identifying what you want and setting off for it . 
  you say you want to be `` good at talking to people '' . 
  in what regard ? 
  a salesman needs a different set of social skills than a party animator ; maybe you want them to create a friend network or find yourself a partner . 
  there are different aspects of functions and you should be able to anecdotally experience it with your own dominant or secondary . 
  for example , i royally suck at chess and i learned math through hard work rather than some ti magic , and yet i use ti as my main function . 
  conversely , not all fe dominants are good at treating people in every instance . 
  accept who you are and do n't care to change anything ; just mind to improve what 's important to your life . 
  the problem is that mbti is far from perfect and it should n't , by any measure , be used as the periodic table for people . 
  two people can perform the exact same action or hold the exact same opinion due to totally unrelated functions ^ ^ ^ 1 . 
  besides , if we could measure objectively the usage of functions you 'd notice how people from a certain type will probably have different scores for all functions ^ ^ ^ 2 . 
  , with some functions being used more by person x and some other being more developed by person y. 
  this is why it 's very inaccurate to ascribe a specific action to a certain function ( e.g : jane likes cooking , it must be her se ! ) . 
  imagine a ti user , a ne user , and a si user go together to a science fair : the ti user loves it because there are science projects , the ne user likes that there 's always new stuff and the si user just likes the nostalgia . 
  when you say x person loves going to science fairs , you do n't really have a way of knowing which function is at play when talking about a certain preference or event . 
  like [ dario nardi 's test ] ( http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm ), 
  i fell for it too . 
  i 'd fuck every square millimeter of her skin . 
  me too . 
  \u00a1 arriba suecia !, 
  should we upvote/downvote them to balance it out to 420 ? 
   i did n't say it was wrong . 
  it 's more than wrong . 
  it 's batshit crazy . 
  and if it 's batshit crazy , it should n't be published in respectable journals or accepted as a thesis . 
   criticism is n't allowed . 
  no commentary . 
  well , as r/fuck2016 has proven , it has the power to kill even the most stubborn of people ( and things in general ) . 
  castro 's already kicked the bucket , so why should n't the kim regime ? 
  this is important but , does it really belong in this sub ? 
  i thought this was about famous people dying . 
  perhaps it belongs more in the new york city or islam subreddits . 
  just sayin ' . 
  for the record , i realize this comment was made ironically . 
  hey , i dug a little bit in your post history and i notice you 're learning spanish , for which i 'm quite honored . 
  i think your spanish is good enough for you to start moving into grammar basics . 
  i 'm learning russian and my strategy is to acquire a good amount of vocabulary ( the 5000 most frequent words ) and then switching to reading and studying grammar ; maybe it suits you , maybe not ... 
  anyway , here 's [ the mexican official reading book for 1st graders ] ( https://issuu.com/cicloescolar/docs/espanol.lecturas.2015-2016.primero ) which includes easy reads and will hopefully help you to familiarize yourself with idiomatic expressions and let you notice grammatical patterns . 
  some extra resources :, 
  * [ frequency lists according to the royal spanish academy ] ( http://corpus.rae.es/lfrecuencias.html ) ( abbreviated in spanish as rae , it acts as the oxford of spanish language ) . 
  * [ official rae homepage ] ( http://www.rae.es/ ) with the dictionary feature on the red box to the right . 
  * [ pronunciation dictionary ] ( http://es.forvo.com/languages/es/ ) . 
  * [ words used in context with lots of examples ] ( http://context.reverso.net/%c3%bcbersetzung/spanisch-englisch/ ) . 
  be careful not to catastrophize ; that 's exactly what right-wingers do when they see an isolated islamic terror attack and say that the entirety of islam promotes that behavior . 
  she does it fast , though ... 
  yes , i know it looks ultra bleak , but until he starts actually enforcing fascist policies ( and when it happens you have to be careful to call him that way with incontrovertible , inexcusable behavior , not just minor inidents ) we ca n't accuse him of that ( hey , maybe he wo n't enforce them at all !, 
  we wo n't know until we get there ) . 
  because otherwise , the rightists will use this to falsely validate their opinion in which we 're biased and unapproachable catastrophists who only rely on our feeeeeeeeels . 
  don quijote is a classic spanish literature book ... hmmmm ... well , give it a try and see how you feel about it . 
  i read just a couple of chapters and got bored :p but , perhaps you should stay clear of it for the time being ; it looks to me like you have work a bit more with your grammar skills and don quijote , being an ancient text , may confuse you ( same for el cantar del m\u00edo cid ) . 
  * [ grammar exercise site ] ( http://www.todo-claro.com/c_index.php ) . 
  i shared the book that corresponds to first grade reading in spanish . 
  in mexico , every child ( regardless if they study in a private or public school ) gets -- or is supposed to get -- a bundle of textbooks that you can find [ here ] ( http://www.apoyo-primaria.com/2016/09/espanol-libro-de-lectura-segundo-grado.html ) . 
  you can read more advanced material by clicking on the squared , color-coded boxes with enclosed numbers on the right . 
  el periquillo sarniento ( www.inehrm.gob.mx/work/models/inehrm/resource/438/1/images/periquillo.pdf ) is a mexican classic literature book that is -- to my appreciation -- easy-intermediate reading and perhaps you can appreciate it more . 
  but who am i to limit you !, 
  read pedro p\u00e1ramo or la silla del \u00c1guila if you feel like it !, 
  i do n't know where you can find good a cool group to start speaking spanish online , though . 
  how about a trip to spain , if you have the will , time and money ? 
  it looks like it 's not so far away . 
  holy shit . 
  i 've read this hypothesis before . 
  could you share the sources of your claim ? 
  or is it a conclusion you reached based on your perception ? 
  i hate how american entertainment and politics are gradually blending into a homogenous mixture . 
  i 'd nod in disapproval and just lose interest if it were n't a country with an overwhelming military capability and a pillar of the world economy , but it is n't the case . 
  a couple of observations :, 
  * i think it should be obvious for us to notice how this article is straight propaganda , mixing confrontational opinions with reporting . 
  this is important , because as humans , we 're just as susceptible to propaganda ; regardless of if it is mother jones or infowars that writes that garbage . 
  * people who read these kinds of outlets regularly are -- in my probably skewed perception -- trying to reinforce and validate their political opinions , so they 'll be especially vulnerable to cherry-picking because they 'll look to the facts that support their opinions and worldview ( like in the [ breitbart article ] ( http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/11/30/global-temperatures-plunge-icy-silence-climate-alarmists/ ) that [ kait parker and the team from the weather channel debunked a few days ago ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhdymortz6m ) ) , so when a member of the production team states that the group which the alt-right ideologically feels identified with is the enemy in an extremely emotional , culturally relevant piece of media that simplifies the entirety of its universe 's destiny on the outcome of a battle between good and evil , you can expect them to be alienated and react this way because it validates their preconceptions and invites them to entrench their beliefs further . 
  i think we have to be careful about not cherry-picking the facts in order to suit our convictions . 
  the function of the example given in the dictionary is only to illustrate its usage , and it will usually be used in a way that is consistent with subjective experience . 
  think about this : should oxford illustrate derogative adjectives at the expense of groups that are politically correct for a certain group to attack or smear ( eg : the promiscuous * nazi * , the rabid * kkk member * ) ? 
  i think that oxford does carry responsibility as the moderator of the english language , but saying that a dictionary encourages sexism ( while disregarding factors that foster sexism like poverty , inequality , violence , drug abuse problems , etc ) is too much of a slippery slope . 
  extremely long but easy to read due to good formatting . 
  great job !, 
  i think that if somebody attributes negative qualities to any trait , then that person either has skewed and false vision of what mbti is , does n't understand the basics of how functions work , or is plain immature . 
  quite literally . 
  actually , i confess i did outright think about the sjw stereotype , but it turned out to be a completely different thing . 
  i kind of understand your thought process ( trying to understand the most fundamental tenets of an ideology and work from those , perhaps ? 
  ) , but i think you have to be especially careful to not oversimplify situations and end up proposing even more chaotic systems because you left some nuance out . 
  also , you should be careful of not letting your personal beliefs get in the way of impartiality . 
  does the cat discovering the secrets of the universe account for ni or ne ? 
  sometimes i get confused between those two . 
  lol these are so spot-on . 
  i 'm not a sensor judge but i think i can contribute a bit with my experience with the russian language . 
  as we know it , [ call of duty impacts some people more than others ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ca/ec/d3/caecd36b58554076b41257668e0cc44b.jpg ) , and i became quite motivated in learning the language . 
  since i ca n't go to russia ( and i do n't actually need to do it , since we 're on the dank age of information ) , i gathered some resources from the internet including the pronunciation rules , a lesson about the cyrillic alphabet and so on . 
  my strategy is to learn the first 5000 most frequent words and then grammar should be much easier to grasp when being able to understand colloquial texts , word by word . 
  but , as we also know it , the brain * hates * collecting useless or unintegrated information , and that 's where consistency chimes in ; when noticing how i 'm gradually learning vocabulary in a way that is measurable and noticing how previously difficult words become easier with repetition , i find comfort in repetition which is good because that 's what memory is about : spaced repetition . 
  not counting people who are sent to prison for non-violent drug offenses . 
  weed becoming legal , or at least not having massively disproportionate punishment for drug offenses is much more than just a social issue . 
  i wo n't miss his indiscriminate drone striking , but i think we 'll all miss him for other things that he just ran `` normally '' . 
  my crobat just got hit by an earthquake at victory road on diamond . 
  i 'm not making this up . 
  has this happened to any of you before ? 
  no , no gravity . 
  but i think i did use roost ; did that do it ? 
  thanks for the tip !, 
  thanks for replying !,
