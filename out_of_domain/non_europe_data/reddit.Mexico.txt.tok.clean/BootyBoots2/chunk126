  sorry to break the circlejerk but i have to remind you that modern islamic terror tactics were stolen from the french ( beheading dissenters ) and the japanese ( yelling stuff before exploding themselves ) . 
  surprised to see how primitively these stereotypically advanced people behaved . 
  they overran everything and spared the sexually pleasing anime tiddies but not before stripping her of her clothes and putting an obligatory german helmet on top of sauron 's eye . 
  back on r/place i thought it was funny for us to leave the duck from duckgame provided they agreed to let us put a sombrero on it , but seeing this in perspective , i think that racketeering art in the form of `` nationalization or obliteration '' is still vandalizing , no matter who does it ( yes , that includes mexico ; my country ) . 
  dropped this -------  konnen . 
  so ... basically france ? 
  just kidding . 
  i think it will work . 
  i have mixed feelings about the void . 
  i understand that the intelligent thing to do was to attack the weakest link but i hated how you oportunistically torned apart the art surrounding the mexican flag and the area under uk 's because individual art in that area was separated by black spaces and you thought we were weak . 
  we defeated you guys but not in time to repair the damage done . 
  if you are willing to attack the major powers ( seems like france is already receding ) and respect the small drawings in a sensitive campaign that works in favor of art over waste of space , consider me a brother of the night 's watch or a monk of the dark order or whatever . 
  true , but the frenchmen sure hot a way to make it theirs , did n't they ? 
  i hear that word and my arm uncontrollably raises to a 45 \u00b0 angle measured from the upper vertical ** axis ** . 
  speaking of which , i was baffled to see that since the 3rd reich is a no-no , you guys resorted to one of the previous two for your imperialistic tendencies . 
  and i call bullshit on anime tiddies . 
  you could have bulldozed her like every other piece of art but you did n't because she looks good . 
  i hope that at least you 'll stick to making your monumental portraits within your banner like the russians and unlike the finns . 
  i 'm helping with the pink background . 
  what 's your discord ? 
  i have also thought about this . 
  like it or not this is also territorial expansion game . 
  i suggest we divide the canvas in semantic groups to form a non-flag coallition to let small drawings rest there . 
  all small art creators need to be communicated to defend other 's artworks and help create new projects under a central administration . 
  until then we will be at the mercy of nationalists . 
  cosmic corner could be one `` republic '' while the anime section on top of ukraine could be anotjer section . 
  tldr : it 's normal for you to get obsessed over this . 
  emotionally speaking , this site is a powerbomb that just has it all :, 
  there 's a mission to complete and every three minutes you get a shot of endorphines for placing a tile correctly . 
  unlike in many tasks and abilities the reward is immediate because you can see the fruition of your work right in front of your eyes . 
  there 's more to it ; if you do it alone there 's a personal sense of achievement , but if you happen to recruit some people into your project you also get the feeling of belonging and unity . 
  if that was n't enough , fear is also there to put some dressing on your feel salad , as your work can get vandalized or obliterated by others . 
  since your drawing wo n't survive if you 're doing it solo , defense becomes a collective effort . 
  emotionally straining enough ? 
  having nationalism behind it is everything i mentioned ** on crack ** , which kind of explains the giant flag phenomenon . 
  have some blinchikis , then . 
  also , the size wil be quadrupled . 
  i need somebody to create a discord to rally the people there , as i 'm new to it . 
  lol , i did n't investigate how to create discords . 
  turns out it 's simple . 
  :p i already created a discord , however , i do n't know how to extract the url in order to share it here ... ( i did it on the app ) . 
  edit : done . 
  edit 2 : but now i do n't know how to contact the mods to have our discord shown in #factions . 
  can anybody help ? 
  i talked to vanilla and they 've already helped me with the process . 
  thank you for the support . 
  except they wo n't do it . 
  they 'll go over what they do n't want and under what they want ( actually the only art spared was anime tiddies on germany and taiga on poland/finland ) . 
  they have the strength and they choose to and i do n't think it 's right to let them bulldoze what they want unquestioned . 
  i agree with what you say , but they flags wo n't let anything over their art because they 'll interpret it as an attack . 
  when they devoured art on the first place . 
  finland was especially atrocious as they painted two huge monuments to their leaders taking up even more space instead of rendering them on top of their already giant flag . 
  could you link to the russian thread ? 
  it would be awesome to have a grid as a construction guide . 
  why do n't you join our discord ? 
  we 'll lay out the proportions and come up with a plan to get it done . 
  i 'd love to see flags going under . 
  really . 
  but that 's not what happens : art is either racketeered in order to fit the nationalism or destroyed . 
  we even saw examples of what happens when a giant flag gets built at the start ( france ) and what happens later ( everyone else ) : if the flag is built first they 'll take up more space than osu !, 
  could have ever dreamed of and only let national sources of pride to be drawn on top of it ( we saw that on r/place as well ) , thus taking up huge ammounts of unused space rather than having the flag act as a background . 
  i 'd also love to see how members of an alliance would be accountable for their memeber 's misbehavior . 
  the germans only did the pickelhaube thing , but the finns raveged everything they could find with a spurdo . 
  of course you managed to have a compromise to let then have mannerheim . 
  finland could n't afford to make enemies with germany while having hostile russia and poland around . 
  did finland compromise with the small art there ? 
  of course not . 
  just like they did when building kekkonen , they bulldozed everything . 
  the mtg moving was pretty much symbolic , as it was just a piece of art spared from , i dare say , a more than a dozen others ; many times ruining hours upon hours of individual efforts . 
  lets be real , if nationalists stuck to small projects ( and by that i mean smaller than the osu !, 
  logo ) or acted as a true background with dozens of small drawings ( unrelated to the nation at hand ) cluttered on top of it , i would n't have any problem with flags . 
  but that 's not the way you 're having it , hence the point of creating coalliton to complete and defend art from dick-measuring nationalists . 
  oh , i forgot the dick-measuring between countries : yet another instance of people 's work being destroyed because of some other people 's sense of belonging . 
  edit : what else did germany spared ? 
  sauron 's eye , that anime witch ( whose name i do n't know ) and the rubik 's cube . 
  not without forcing them to pay tribute to germany , though . 
  that 's the point . 
  while bulldozing eveything to create your solid banners you destroyed hours of work on artworks that cluttered your flags . 
  and on top of that , nationalists defaced art in order to suit their ego . 
  except for taiga ... 
  it would be cool if there was a flag-only section so flags could duke it out if they pleased , and other artworks could duke it out between themselves . 
  rallying people behind flags is easy . 
  and i do n't hate flags , just saying that they do spoil th experience of others because they feel strong in large swathes . 
  artwork hardly destroys the ammount of art that flags do . 
  besides , it 's especially hard to not do it at the early stages of the canvas ... and the surviving artwork will decorate the canvas artfully , unlike the huge national banners . 
  in that sense , i 'm ok with kekkonen and manneheim , though i did n't like them being so large and * outside * the huge finnish flag . 
  i think large artwork is ok as long as its complexity warrants it and it does n't hurt many ( preferably any ) other art . 
  a band on the arm to identify those who ca n't pay?hhhmmm , where have i seen that before ... 
  i actually liked the monuments to manneheim and kekkonen , but i hated that they were n't * inside * finland 's flag . 
  kekkonen , however , had lots of black space that could have been used to host smaller artwork . 
  eeeeeeeeee epicrapbabblesofhistory !, 
  calling this time `` the age of information '' is akin to intellectuals of the late 19th century thinking that the 20th century was going to be the age of peace and civilization because of the boom in science and the brutal wars left behind . 
  it 's more like `` the age of telecommunications '' for me : you can find information as well as disinfornation . 
  however , i think it 's easier to find disinformation than information . 
  every time i hear `` nabisco '' it reminds me of that stephen colbert episode where he did a product placement gag comparing cookie-eating binges to media coverage of trump . 
  and now i want oreos . 
  i 'll join you and get it done . 
  i come the independent art alliance , check our discord !, 
  coordinates on ( 15 , 800 ) . 
  we could start building some bananas next !,
