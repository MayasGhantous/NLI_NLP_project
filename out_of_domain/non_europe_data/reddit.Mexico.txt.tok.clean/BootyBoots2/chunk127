  we 're collecting individual requests and completing their art so they will join us . 
  we 'll collectively help other finish their work and provide cover from griefers . 
  we will be on the right side of the map after the wipe . 
  it would be much easier for us to have you on discord to plan the location of the banan army . 
  yes , that 's what we 're planning to do . 
  i suggest we start on this on the middle/lower side because that roughly the area where cosmic corner and the lattice will be . 
  hope to have you on our corner . 
  you 've got a really original and fun project . 
  gim me a second , i 've got my hands full with a project and managing the discrod server . 
  ok , we 're working on the middle right . 
  i ca n't give you exact cooridnates yet because we have to figure out the expansion plans of france and russia yet , but it would help a lot if you could tell me the domensions of your project and send me an image with the grid overlay to plan where it will be set . 
  edit : unfortunately , we do n't know of any other place than discord to communicate . 
  except you want to get into 2ch . hk , the russian 2chan . 
  all right . 
  i 'll communicate with you here then . 
  how many bananas do you want to build for a start ? 
  i 'm not sure you 'll be able to see this before the wipe , but the independent art alliance and the art protection guild are proud to inform you that [ we just completed your art , fam ] ( http://m.imgur.com/yxst6fx?r ) . 
  we 'd love to have you on our corner , later on . 
  it 's already visible on the entire canvas overview . 
  but hey , * we * are the cucked ones . 
  yeahh ... [ about that ... ] ( https://youtu.be/8_bo2ro60ro ), 
  [ maybe justified ? 
  but to be fair , it was professional soldiers with special equipment and authorization who did this , not some yahoos . 
  i think this is more of a `` corporate greed really loves to fuck over people for profit '' but yeah , that too . 
  `` war is entertaining for those who have n't experienced it '', 
  with climate change the way it 's going , you can bet the desert landscape will be the actual setting . 
  looks yummy . 
  muh ingrish . 
  too complex . 
  you can ask ryan about trumpcare . 
  at art protection guild , we do n't like the spurdo vandalism often associated with the finnish , but we know that the great majority of the finnish enclave is just focused on creating their impressive tribute to manneheim ( sp . ), 
  `` patriotism is supporting your country all the time , and your government when it deserves it . '', 
  - mark twain . 
  to be fair , the person censored in red had a point about being civil . 
  i fear that with all of these meddling combined with the fact that some european countries are `` small '' we might just return to diplomats dispatching their letters ( written with ink on paper , sealed with wax and ring ) by horse . 
  googled it without success . 
  care to explain it ? 
  lol you reminded me of the cute dogs . 
  why not checking out how it 's written in japanese to sort out the difference at once ? 
  we can play the song for gustavus adolphus by sabaton as background music . 
  it 's been hijacked by white nationalists already but we can take it back by just playing it anyway , no fucks given . 
  praise mainstream filtering option . 
  but ... but muh beer , muh engineering and muh gorgeous busty blondes . 
  also muh precision football . 
  which country will grace our world with these things if not germany ? 
  i did n't have that image until you said it was an image you did n't need . 
  congratulations , the image of tatcher lusciously stripping down her lingerie is now imbued on my brain because of you . 
  yeah , it 's not like it 's one of the most widespread languages in the entire world , spoken by hundreds of millions of people , one of the six official working languages of the united nations and authors in spanish have won nobel prizes for `` works '' written in that foul language . 
  also , it 's not like you would ever be attracted to some inferior hispanic genes , right ? 
  and even if you were a race traitor and went for it , it 's * them * who have to speak * our * language and not the other way around . 
  i wonder if the japanese have ever pusblished an article like this one with the exact same arguments . 
  link to the proper rae dissertation on it or it did n't happen . 
  serious question though : does that song have an english counterpart ? 
  and if it does , does it say that as well ? 
  sir , this it not memorial or veterans day . 
  please save your enthusiasm for the * real * heroes . 
  for one moment , i read it like `` marxist-tywinism '' . 
  but that would yield a radically different result . 
  gotcha , i was only exposed to the spanish version . 
  i suspect these are exactly the kind of people who will try to ridicule or threaten you if you do n't `` stand by the president '' . 
  old thread reply , but we even have cities in mexico and spain and a surname called `` matamoros '' , which literally means `` muslim killer '' . 
  the stafford-binet intelligence scale ( namely the iq test ) is chielfly an individual measurement of some important cognitive functions such as memory , logic and spatial relations . 
  it 's a valuable tool but in no way will the results of the test determine of how a person will do in society unless the iq is low enough to describe a cognitive impairment and even then , that person can receive assistance to carry on with a normal life . 
  there are multiple intellicences that are conveniently not taken into account by racists , you ca n't and should n't use the test results to discriminate in any way and grouping people on collective averages strips the tests off of their value . 
  what a dangerous rethoric . 
  really ? 
  wow ... 
  for the record , i did get the reference . 
  page not found . 
  i do n't know if you mistyped the link or it 's just that i 'm on mobile . 
  happy birthday , bilbo ? 
  i am hungry and i clicked . 
  do n't do it folks . 
  that thing looks scrumptious . 
  i understand the resentment towards us military personnel , but i definitely would n't dare to call them untrained , uneducated or poorly equipped . 
  i pictured a 7th century muslim raiding cavalry on modern london . 
  no wonder why the song `` america , fuck yeah '' features mcdonalds as the first item on the list . 
  i love this sub , but people sometimes enjoy way too much the `` merica so indoctrinated lol '' argument . 
  the flag has to be disposed in `` a dignified way , preferably by burning '' , * according to the us flag code * . 
  i do n't see how quietly reciting the pledge of alliegiance would not be a part of a dignified disposal ceremony . 
  it 's just a innocous part of their culture . 
  forcing children to recite the pledge everyday on schools , though ... that 's another story . 
  yeah , but cyrillic is shiny and novel to westerners . 
  at least it looks cool to me . 
  the last time i saw the term `` bio-weapon '' used unronically was on the sun level of star fox 64 . 
  the refugee crisis started because of the syrian civil war but it was made much worse by the us by, 
  * killing saddam , giving way to the power vaccum that spawned isis * in irak * . 
  * indiscriminately bombing syrian territory , sloppily worsening the war situation ; as russia was helping the continuity of the assad regime . 
  still , it would be disengenious to say merica started the crisis . 
  it did n't . 
  it looks funny to you because you 're used to cyrillic . 
  when i read the russian wiki , i need to spend a few seconds more on reading foreign names ( even of people i recognize ) , while a name like `` dimitry kunyetsov '' reads easy to me . 
  ( ok , i 'll admit it : i generalized in order to feel more `` in touch '' with people ; i thought it was fucking awesome when modern warfare 2 's logo changed some letters randomly and some cyrillic was crammed into it , also noticing all of those different cultural elements like the graveyard of orthodox crosses , or random posters in cyrillic or just the '' \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c '' sign on the road . ), 
  to be fair , the only reason * any * concacaf team goes to the world cup is because they 're on concacaf . 
  ( yes it sounds really stupid , but i meant that no cocacaf team would go to the wc if they were on uefa or conmebol ), 
  different people have different coping mechanisms . 
  if you are reading something that involves the likes of '' \u0432\u043e\u043f\u043e \u044c\u0443\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043f \u043b\u0443\u043e\u043a\u043b\u0441 '' and you see the simbol `` p '' and read it like an `` r '' , then congratulations : you 're officially used to cyrillic . 
  yes , but not * because * of saddam 's death . 
  it 's just a different outlook on things . 
  different people think in different ways .
