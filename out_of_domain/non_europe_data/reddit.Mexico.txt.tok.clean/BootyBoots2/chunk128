  i think it 's just a part of the ceremony , and it 's just a cultural aspect not really worth of paying attention to . 
  i read indianapolis is a great place as well . 
  it 's just that it 's surrounded by indiana ... 
  i think he knows perfectly that the statement was untrue , but it was just a white lie to slap some sense into crazy conservatives . 
  he is a very respected conservative figure , i recall . 
  yeah , but `` cosmo wars '' sounds more like a glamour models ' dirty war/catfight than luke turning on his lightsaber . 
  what if i told you that hell elects its representatives in an orderly and fair way where every demon has the same voting power , no matter their rank , seniority or circle of origin ? 
  you mean the man who has had like ... 3 wives , relishes in adultery and * probably * desires his own daughter ? 
  half . 
  it was half of it . 
  but hey , they `` paid '' for it , so it was legal , guys !, 
  i thought the german language fulfilled that duty . 
  i am an anti-natalist living in one of those 3rd world countries but let me tell you that your view may be a little bit wrapped . 
  see , these people do n't think they 're living miserable lives at all ; and actually , having large families is an important source of joy and happiness for them . 
  culture has much to do as well , as getting married is encouraged even at an early age in some places . 
  what you see as mindless procreation could mean important ties that bind the cultural , social , economic and maybe even religious aspects of family and community life . 
  different peoples have different outlooks on what does quality of life mean . 
  perhaps i 'm wrong , but i guess that the better the economy of a country , the more expensive life gets and thus the lesser children will couples have . 
  then you might get dangerously * low * birth rates . 
  well , you do have a point about people dying young from preventable diseases . 
  that crap is infuriating , but it 's mostly due to government inefficiency and corruption ( or at least it 's that way here in mexico ) , and it 's not like the entire thing is falling apart . 
  do mexicans have a decent chance at happiness ? 
  who knows ... happiness is a very difficult emotion to describe , as there are people all over the world who live in luxury , yet still they 're depressed ; and likewise there are others who live in dirt poor conditions and yet still they 're carefree , positive and hopeful . 
  i read it in carson 's voice , so i took a minute and a half to read the entire quote . 
  however , i do think he has a point though ... somebody who knows how business works and has a `` tactical '' mind for it could work his way up again ( i personally believe that somebody like warren buffett could pull off a small fortune if stripped out of his entire wealth ) . 
  on the other hand , people with poor impulse control or insufficient training in business could just burn the entirety of the cash because of mismanagement . 
  which is a reason to actually be more understanding of the unfortunate people who did n't grow in an evironment that fostered healthy economic habits . 
  to be fair , it 's a pretty cool idea , and the us flag 's simple design allows for a neat `` tattoo '' . 
  edit : does this make him a literal redneck ( redback ? 
  after reading this comment , i choose to believe that dreamworks ' rasputin was the one who did it as the ultimate `` fuck you '' to the romanovs . 
  of course , he needed something definingly german to complete the revival-transformation ritual , so there 's where the pritt stick comes in . 
   volsoo has played an ancient egyptian . 
  thank you . 
  if i die now i can rest assured that now i know imhotep 's real name . 
  i remember all the outrage of gamergaters about the `` censoring '' of hypersexualized content in response to the swj 's because of `` political correctness '' . 
  ironic how now that exacerbated nationalism is the status quo , challenging it is the politically incorrect thing to do but now it 's them calling for the censorship . 
  the people who are the most vocal about free speech are often the most prone to humilliate you in order to make you shut up and not question the state of affairs once their ideology is the one in power . 
  it 's a classical right winger point to deprecate feelings to give way to `` common sense '' ( namely firm beliefs held on baseless or biased claims rooted on personal experience or fears ) . 
  if an american gave up their right to the 2nd amendment - thus eliminating * possibility * to pull off a sucessful dgu in case of a life-threatening situation for themselves or their families - because they understand that carrying/keeping guns is a much greater danger to society in general , then that person would be an official cold-hearted/blooded/minded bastard ( ess ) in my book . 
  ready for some navy seal 's gorilla warfare . 
  will do !, 
  some dudes are just * born * to play the bad guy . 
  like that actor who played lucius malfoy and that total asshole sword brit in `` the patriot '' .

  something tells me that that damned bus was the dealmaker for the brexit . 
  lol `` tree hugging beta male '' . 
  these clips are really cool . 
  i 've always thought that americans are the first and most affected victims of massive psychological manipulation ( that works on all of us because we 're humans ) . 
  to somewhat different extents we 're all prone to adopt american unhealthy habits as we have our desires and fears exploited , so these videos really come in handy to explain what to watch for . 
  but on the other hand the delusional top minds believe that eveything is a conspiracy , and if uncareful one can slip from these videos to dowright illuminati lunacy ... 
  being a human is a nuanced job . 
  well , at least those cops will have the decency to bid farewell after punching you in the face . 
  you dropped these : '' \u00bf '' , '' \u00e9 '' . 
  more that that , i think is that some americans have a concept in which not being willing to be violent towards people who pose a threat is a sign of weakness and cowardice . 
  in other words , people who break the law * must die * . 
  the executioners then become righteous heroes and everybody who challenges the status quo is a weak slime . 
  yes , though i was thinking about those 2nd amendment advocates who preach it 's your right to kill a home intuder to protect * property * , or those who justify the nuking of japanese people on the grounds that `` they had it coming '' . 
  simply put : why are these people so keen on killing at the least sign of law breaking , but on the other hand they look the other way when soldiers commit war crimes , and they even dare to call themselves `` pro life '' for being staunchly opposed to abortions ? 
  i think it 's because of their convoluted concept of innocence : a home intruder broke the law , so their life is worthless , * but an unborn has n't made the `` choice '' yet * . 
  this is my best attempt at explaining `` pro-life , good guys with guns '' . 
  then you are lost !!!, 
  abstinence is as much of a birth control method as praying is a safety measure during a fire . 
   the us seems to have more skewed wealth distribution than western europe and , thanks to the red scare , no real way of introduction fairly sensible redistributive policies .

  what happened to being politically incorrect ? 
  i thought political correctness was killing the us . 
  what is this beta weeping i hear ? 
  could it be ... nooooo , it ca n't be ... 
  are those cries for censorship ??? 
  that 's it . 
  now i 'm one of them . 
  discovered sabaton because of the memes , stayed because of the music . 
  meh ... companies fire ( and publicly announce they just did ) employees who are subjects of scandal as a safety measure because their consumers think `` i wo n't consume this brand anymore because it goes against my values . 
  i will now buy the competing brand , that 'll show 'em '' . 
  racism has a brand new face : your culture is imbued * in your blood * , that 's the reason why takuma sato made this reporter uncomfortable . 
  the empire of the sun lives in him , he could have gone banzai at any moment . 
  same reason why people who have n't lived in germany for 7 generations are german , an also it is n't poverty or bad decisions that make them alcoholics ; it 's their culture , that they 're carrying in their blood , and their offsprings will keep carrying it for the ages to come . 
  bullshit , i know ; but that 's what i think they think . 
  sorry for the text wall . 
  upvoted because bigly . 
  ( now i 'm thinking like a republican ! ), 
  guys , we have to acknowledge this flag shenannigans really gets the creativity rolling , and it keeps us entertained . 
  that shit is awesome . 
  i mean , freaking engineering was probably needed to pull this off . 
  that dude with the merica sunburn was also really creative . 
  yes , but it was especially built for this . 
  the flag is so big that it 's likely to have drawn the center of mass of the truck rearwards . 
  also , the speedway is a little slanted so maybe that had to be taken into consideration as well , so the truck does n't slip by . 
  i do n't know , it 's quarter to four in the morning here and this what came to my mind . 
  maybe they just scaffolded the truck and let the old glory do its thing . 
  and it looks cool as fuck , so it paid off .
