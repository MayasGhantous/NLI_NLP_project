  but i 'm saying that the meaning of symbols change and fortunately , some people are stripping the racism away from it , which is cool . 
  guys , i 'm all fired up about `` thank you for your service '' . 
  this could be a great oportunity for a good criticism of america 's military culture . 
  i mean , ok , they went there and they lost limbs , friends and time there , and when they came back they were showered with shallow praise ( unlike rambo ) , but then when it comes down to taking care of them to adapt to civilian life , they 're left for dead . 
  some of them homeless and without psychological help , commit suicide . 
  and if it was n't enough , they have to withstand being the never ending republican excuse for not doing important things , and watch the circle of lies repeat itself with unnecessarily grand displays in nfl events to recruit naive youngsters . 
  jarhead explored the soldier 's problems within the battlefield , but when it came to civilian life , it just showed snippets of what the platoon member 's did , but not in detail . 
  `` rambo : first blood '' explored a veteran coming home and being abused by a hostile environment . 
  but this is a different time when they are praised but left behind and objectified . 
  ok , so republicare it is , i guess . 
  hey , i read in tifu that reddit was banned in russia . 
  how have you managed to get here , if you 're in russia at the moment ? 
  just curious . 
  a person sent this message to westminster and her majesty * actually answered back * . 
  she said she could n't intervene in the affairs of a sovereign nation ... 
  to be fair , it 's just a notion that i have and i have n't got any concrete example of it . 
  but i remember the mexican `` puto '' controversy in football : every time the opposing goalkeeper kicked the ball from his gate the crowd would scream `` eeeeeeeeeeeehhhhh puto '' in order to distract him . 
  now , `` puto '' is a homophobic slur , but it 's been so overused , it has been stripped of meaning , particularly in the football setting . 
  something that - understandably - the high ranks in fifa did n't understand and wanted to fine mexico for . 
  mexicans , ( and i think , even gay ones ) defended the shout as a pretty harmless , tongue-in-cheek tradition . 
  or swearwords , languages evolve to accomodate new swearwords because the existing ones fall into oblivion . 
  notice that the flags of the empire of japan and the hammer and sickle are banned in some countries for being considered symbols of oppresion . 
  yet still , dan-san used a headband with the symbol of imperial japan in karate kid , which is anything but a hateful movie . 
  now i want a book on the psychology of symbols ... 
  i 'm currently on mobile and since i 'm using limited data , i avoid googling images not to spend too much of them . 
  i could have sworn the headband was the one of the empire of japan . 
  my bad . 
  i really do n't know what it was supposed to represent so scrape karate kid off . 
  still , if symbols are forgotten an someone revives them attaching a new meaning to them , why ca n't this happen in a positive way ? 
  i think that if people ignorantly use the confederate flag in a positive way , at some point it will lose its racist original meaning and when racists attempt to use it like it was intended , southerneners will shun them off , not wanting to be associated to them but at the same time unwilling to give up their symbol of identity . 
  but do n't take my word , i think it 's worth researching if negative symbols can get positive new meanings . 
  then again , thanks for reading my argument despite the botched examples . 
  yes , it was an old story . 
  thanks for the info . 
  and what is that perspective ? 
  different people have different attitudes about what makes up for a hate subreddit . 
  by r/againsthatesubreddits ' standards , sas might as well count as a hate sub . 
  just mildly providing some perspective , i ca n't really tell you because i avoid your sub , as watching people die is not my thing ... 
  so they ca n't possibly be good at offering healthcare but they 're damn good at misspending billions of taxpayer 's dollars in looking for nonexistent nukes ? 
  that was the official nra twitter account ? 
  wow . 
  i mean , i get it 's humor and all ; but they 've come a really long way for an organization originally concerned with trigger safety . 
  i literally visit reddit for sas . 
  and porn ... 
  missed oportunity to have a distinctive saddam skull . 
  also , it turned quite ironic that the consequence of op . 
  iraqi freedom resulted in isis taking over iraq . 
  guys , i know what your thinking . 
  do n't do it . 
  just do n't . 
  she 's not even that hot . 
  could you imagine smooth han and reckless lando ? 
  lmao . 
  look at the sunny side , at least that hospital was n't drone-stricken . 
  easy now ... you should n't narrow your entire viewpoint to a loaded question . 
  also , so far the picture suggests , you were unnecessarily rude to a person who did n't disrespect yourself or your opinion . 
  how do you expect people to at least listen to us if you 're acting so contentious ? 
  thank * you * for coming by . 
  your text wall was a delight to read . 
  i read that book , and while it contains really good information and general guidelines , it falls short when the time for specifics comes . 
  this thread is about avoiding the `` hi , how are you doing ? '', 
  standard ice-breaker because in reality , not only do you have to create rapport in order to mitigate the fear that comes to the listener by being approached by a complete stranger , but you also have to be * entertaining * while being witty enough to hide your intention or otherwise you will provoke a sensation of cringe , pitty or threat ; namely the opposite of what you need . 
  it gets worse when you are a man trying to hit up on women . 
  once you 're cleared with thar issue , you can listen to the cues to develop a common topic of interest , according to the book . 
  but it 's the kickstarting that 's tricky . 
  lmao this is the actual pick-up line . 
  and this , kids , is how i banged sansa stark . 
  did they fulfill the back to the future 's prophecy or did they do ir one year later ? 
  at this point , i would n't have been surprised if it were legit . 
  could it be that the 4th of july is losing its meaning , much like christmas ? 
  i mean , christmas is important as a religious date for many people , but i perceive that in general it 's much more about the reunions , gifts , etc. 
  while jesus is cast aside or just has an honorary mention . 
  in the same light , could it be that americans are much more engaged in barbecues , family reunions , and grand displays of creativity - and wealth - for showing the old glory ? 
  having said that , this lawn is amazing and immensely aesthetic , much like other sad flag material on this sub . 
   from my point of view , the jedi are evil, 
  is that line atrocious or magnificent ? 
  i 'm pretty proud for these guys . 
  however , ot would have been epic if they actually made that classic movie 's random prediction become true . 
   rebrand and resell this in ... france, 
  it got me at `` dew-s-a '' . 
  on another post , somebody referenced chief justice taney and his decision on the dred scott case ( [ link ] ( https://www.loc.gov/item/17001543/ ) ) in which - so far i 've read - was about a black man who sued his owner , demanding freedom for himself and his family on the grounds that at the time of the case , he was located in an abolitionist state . 
  the supreme court ruled that he was unable to sue because he was property and not a citizen . 
  ** extract from the document : **, 
  the language of the declaration of independence is equally conclusive :, 
  it begins by declaring `` that when in the course of human events it becomes necessary, 
  for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another ,, 
  and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the, 
  laws of nature and nature 's god entitle them , a decent respect for the opinions of mankind, 
  requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation . '', 
  it then proceeds to say : `` we hold these truths to be self-evident : that all men are created, 
  equal ; that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights ; that among, 
  them is life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ; that to secure these rights , governments, 
  are instituted , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed . '', 
  the general words above quoted would seem to embrace the whole human family , and, 
  if they were used in a similar instrument at this day would be so understood . 
  but it is too, 
  clear for dispute , that ** the enslaved african race were not intended to be included ** , and, 
  formed no part of the people who framed and adopted ** [ in ] this declaration ; for if the language ** ,, 
  as understood in that day , ** would embrace them , the conduct of the distinguished men, 
  who framed the declaration of independence would have been utterly and flagrantly,
