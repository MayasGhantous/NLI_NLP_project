  inconsistent with the principles they asserted ** ; and instead of the sympathy of mankind ,, 
  to which they so confidently appealed , they would have deserved and received universal, 
  rebuke and reprobation . 
  yet ** the men who framed this declaration were ** great men -- high in literary acquirements --, 
  high in their sense of honor , and ** incapable of asserting principles inconsistent with those, 
  on which they were acting . 
  ** they perfectly understood the meaning of the language, 
  they used , and how it would be understood by others ; and they knew that it would not in, 
  any part of the civilized world be supposed to embrace the negro race , which by common, 
  consent , had been excluded from civilized governments and the family of nations , and, 
  doomed to slavery . 
  they spoke and acted according to the then established doctrines, 
  and principles , and in the ordinary language of the day , and no one misunderstood them . 
  the unhappy black race were separated from the white by indelible marks , and laws long, 
  before established , and were never thought of or spoken of except as property , and when, 
  the claims of the owner or the profit of the trader were supposed to need protection .

  notes :, 
  * the extract can be found in pages 36 and 37 of the downloadable pdf version . 
  * deleted the number `` 21 '' after the words `` they perfectly understood '' , and broke the text into more pargrapghs for the sake of reading easiness , highlighted a portion for the same reason . 
  * added the word `` in '' in brackets on a highligthed portion . 
  i have n't even clicked the link , but please let it be the `` servants of the archons - slaves of the eagons '' one . 
  i love it , even if i get the extremes misspelled . 
  edit : success !, 
  the horseshoe theory is pretty intuitive . 
  i even deducted what it was before finding in the internet about its existence and why it 's bullshit . 
  pretty much like the red pill . 
  it 's one of those things that solidifies in one 's mind when people have an extremely broad but not nuanced understanding of how things work . 
  you must be new here . 
  no , that 's how it used to be but now it 's changed . 
  now you call them `` cucks '' no matter the context of disagreement . 
  i have personally had mostly positive experiences when dealing with americans . 
  there was that * one * stressful time with betty but then she smiled and apologized to us and everything went very smoothly from that time on . 
  also , there must be really nice trump supporters out there . 
  redneck and everything . 
  it 's just that the media is extremely good at creating sides and demonizing people opposing its customer 's camp , so we only get to see the asshole trump supporters . 
  i did n't `` see it '' and gave up until i read your comment . 
  i was looking for an x-wing in the mirror 's reflection or something alike . 
  hey , your russian is leaking . 
  somehow related but not quite the case : when i feel my confort zone is being transgressed or i 'm being used , mu mind immediately devises vengeance . 
  but i let my inner drama flow and soon enough i 'll be back in business . 
  i 've never hurt anybody , and hopefully i never will . 
  not sure about improving on a measurable scale , much like iq , but daniel goleman 's `` emotional intelligence '' states that in esscence , emotional intelligence is the ability to break off inconvenient emotional states that could negatively affect or endanger your life . 
  examples : break procrastination , de-escalate angry situations , pull yourself up when feeling sad , push yourself through anxiety , etc. 
  and i could really , really do with some of that procrastination breaking roght now , to be fair . 
  man , when you get the ad hominem , you won . 
  it 's akin to them dropping the king in chess . 
  i also liked to engage in this intense , pointless debates , but i did sparked the tinderbox only to draw attention to myself because i felt lonely and arguing made me feel temporarily better . 
  it did n't matter if i `` won '' or not . 
  this . 
  looks like i missed the party . 
  man i 'm in the exact same spot as you : male , 25 and i feel like my time is running out . 
  also not a virgin and have enjoyed cool , long term relationtips bur want more and feel the need to hack onto women . 
  alright , this is what i 've got : there 's a book called `` mating intelligence unleashed , the role of the mind in sex , dating and love '' by geher & kauffman . 
  both of them evolutionary psychologists and phd 's . 
  that book lays the foundations of how sexual attraction works but does n't quite tell you the specifics on how to build a strategy , it just lays down the correlations and provides some facts . 
  a great match for it is goleman 's `` emotional intelligence : why it can matter more than iq '' . 
  you can pirate both of them , and form your own opinion , but my conclusion is that we 're just too empathetic in the limbic sense , but not on the cognitive sense ( like the dark triad people ) . 
  and i guess that unless you 're doing some heavy cognitive behavioural therapy , you wo n't pull the bad boy trick off . 
  so now i 'm going for the final gambit : i just got into the gym . 
  no more `` shortcuts '' , no more flirting to girls until < 10 % fat , no more bullshit . 
  i decided i 'm going to invest a lot of time , money and effort , and you kinda have to build your life around it to a certain extent . 
  why do i expect to achieve ? 
  it has been demonstrated that people are much more indulgent to sexually attractive people than those who are not . 
  the plan , then is to get ripped and then my social akwardness will suddenly not matter so much . 
  sure , i 'm not going to bang just about any girl i set my crosshairs on , but it 'll be a start . 
  from then on , it 's about slowly building confidence in successes . 
  i do n't know if it will work . 
  but like you said , at least we 're not gon na wait for the universe/god/time / whatever to make stuff happen for us . 
  good huntin ' . 
  this reply is nothing below epic . 
  way to go . 
  i wrote my reply before reading about your health problems ; that 's a big one , you know . 
  i assume you 're also an american , which does n't make stuff any better , heathcare-wise . 
  but let 's cut the politics , that 's not our focus right now . 
  you have a good point with competition . 
  but competition that will get you the girls , especially when other men around exist but not do anything about it : the only thing that counts is your `` sexual capital '' in relation to the other men in your vicinity . 
  you do n't have to become this awesome casanova ; * just outstanding within your immediate community * . 
  i have tried many ways ( funny , interesting , etc ) and looks like i 'm reduced to being buffed as the last resort . 
  whatever you do ( whether you opt for the gym or not ) , do n't be afraid of investing money , time or effort : even if you fuck it up you will learn because you will invest yourself in what you 're doing and then do it better next time . 
  emotional intelligence tip : when negativity starts creeping through , react by setting your mind blank . 
  just keep doing what you 're into but silencing your inner dialogue . 
  it 's hard - as we know it - but it 's worth it . 
  since you practice meditation , you should already know how it feels like and how to get to thar point . 
  it 's ok if you only hold a blank mind for just a few seconds , but you 'll get better in time if you put ypur mind to that . 
  obligatory , unnecessary advice you already knew if you do go for the gym : consult a physician to know specifically what are your limitations and how you can devolop yourself safely . 
  also , get a nutritionist and follow the feeding plan like your life depended on it and pay a personal instructor who can be there to make you follow a fitness plan safely and according to your needs and wants . 
  varying magnetic fields induce voltage in materials . 
  likewise , passing a varying electric current within a conductor creates a magnetic field around it . 
  different materials have different degrees of magnetic suceptibility , meaning that they can create more or less powerful attraction/repulsion to them by applying the same amount of current . 
  that depends on its quantum structure but lets think of them of that as [ some pretty little arrows instead ] ( https://www.electrical4u.com/images/september16/1481973605.png ) : electric current makes them align , and the more they align the more powerful the magnetic field will be ( think of marx and socialist governments ! ) . 
  the most `` alignable '' materials are called `` ferromagnetic '' ( e.g : iron ) , not so alignable but still conducing materials are called `` paramagnetic '' ( clay ) and insulators - that you can still pass current on , but with weak effects nonetheless - are called `` diamagnetic '' ( e.g : quartz ) . 
  you can induce a magnetic field by passing alternate current into a material , or you can magnetize ( for practical effects , rubbing , though there are probably more sophisticated methods ) the item in order to do it . 
  though in different proportion , but you 're gon na have to dig deeper and do some engineering if you want to know exactly how much . 
  if you just wanted to circlejerk for a bit and not really interested on magnets or how they work , i 'm sorry for beong emotionally tone deaf . 
  let the puppy bot brighten your day instead . 
  posted the link on mobile . 
  let me know if the link does n't work to delete this post . 
  needless to say that this does n't have anything to do with mbti but it 's awesome , intrincate and useless ; and that 's kind of our thing , so i thought you guys would appreciate it . 
  the point of taxes are to be used in the benefit os society .
