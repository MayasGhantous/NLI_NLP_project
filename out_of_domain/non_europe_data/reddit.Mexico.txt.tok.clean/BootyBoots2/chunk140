  `` i am here to break up with you '' sounds like the emotional equivalent of him sweeping in with a chainsaw . 
  but he must have gathered a lot of courage to come and say it to you before it turned into something more toxic , which has a lot of merit in my eyes . 
  arrrghh ... it sucks when the magic fades away . 
  i really hope you can use this to learn what to look for and what to avoid in the future . 
  anyway , we 're here for you . 
  currently playing `` oh fortuna '' performed by apocalyptica while drawing a pentagram on the floor with my own blood . 
  do n't waste your energy analizing these people ; it 's not worth it . 
  just for the sake of sharing a thought , i think people hate with burning passion what :, 
  * deviates strongly from * their * cultural norms . 
  * is not `` natural '' . 
  in the end it 's just tribalism . 
  keep you head high , you are a remarkable person for having the strength to deal with * your family * being so negative towards an inner trait of yours . 
  edit : hard as it may be , always put your physical safety first and trust your instincts if you ever feel endangered . 
  good read . 
  upvoted both posts . 
  the only guesses i made on my past reply were that :, 
  * you ca n't speak french . 
  * you 're dutch ( or european ) . 
  * the two missing languages are closely related to each other . 
  ok , in my first reply i guessed english , spanish , french , arabic , portuguese and polish . 
  and i got 4/7 or 5/9 which means one of them is language you speak `` badly '' . 
  when i swaped arabic with german you raised my score to 5/7 which means that you know german well , and you can either speak french or polish `` badly '' . 
  i hazily remember replying to somebody about polish , but i do n't quite remember being you . 
  you also complained about french people being uppity in their villages so most likely french is one of you `` bad '' languages . 
  in this very last reply you graded me 6/9 but i did n't include french this time , so i hit the other `` bad '' one unknowingly ( unless you condescendingly kept that hit despite me retracting from french as i can deduct from the words `` thus 6 correct '' in which case both dutch and afrikaans are amiss ) . 
  if the assertion enclosed in parenthesis is not true , then i hit another one of your `` bad ones '' apart from french , and i 'm guessing it 's dutch for the sake of semantics . 
  i still have to figure out which are the other two `` good ones '' ( and a bad one if dutch is not the other ) , and i swear that nobody has strained this much to know how can someone sound since ylvys wondered what does the fox say . 
  people are soooo good at deluding themselves . 
  i wonder how many of these puritans unapollogetically have anal sex with their partners , or how many of them have unsatisfactory sex lives because they 're still worrying about the lord almighty judging them with fiery eyes or thinking that sex has to ve strictly and exclusively limited to procreation, 
  tl ; dr : why not letting gay people the small consessions of kissing and holding hands like straight people do ? 
  i liked your response and i agree with it for the most part . 
  however , there 's one point i would like to add on the basis of this excerpt :, 
   how hard it is for you to understand how revolting the idea of gay sex is to non gay , at least between men . 
  it is distirbing . 
  it is unsettleing . 
  it is off-putting . 
  the level of display homosexuals present in public ranges from dressing perfectly within the socially accepted norms ( but you can just feel that `` gay vibe '' ) to the over-the-top gay parades . 
  while a i agree that the overblown parades are too much , i would argue to let them be just as much as we allow straight sexual displays in public . 
  of course we 're gon na frown upon straight couples making out in the middle of the street , but just a kiss or holding hands is quite within an acceptable range for the xxi century ( unless you live like in the conservstive middle east or a literal tribe ) . 
  a few months ago i was in arguing mood and i debated * against * breastfeeding with the argument that breasts are considered sexual in most places , even when nursing is the least sexual activity ever . 
  yet still , even while i was playing conservative that time , i recognize that letting women nurse wherever the baby needs is a very small - if real , for a start - sacrifice to make so that the mothers are not forced to stay at home . 
  being sensibly relaxed about other 's necessities is cool so others can takes us into account whenever * we * need the system to change a bit . 
  #and he shall smite the wicked and plunge them into the fiery pit !, 
  maybe that person was just trying to make a joke ? 
  i 'm glad - and suprised - we have n't gotten linked to a drama sub yet . 
  we need * your * brand of religious people around . 
  god bless you !, 
  true that . 
  ca n't blame homos , though ; it feels good . 
  while saying a context-appropriate one-liner . 
  when i hug people whom i care about , i stop after i feel that warmth exchanging from one another . 
  it 's normal if one of your shadow functions is developed . 
  i , for one , am intp but also have developed te , even though it 's not on my stack . 
  so you 're either intp with high fi ( unusual ! ), 
  or you 're an infp with high ti ( also unusual ! ), 
  it 's great to pack both great feeling and great thinking . 
  your type can be most likely found by watching your least developed functions . 
  anyway , you are not your type . 
  type is just an approximation of how you might be in comparison to other people . 
  cheers !, 
  it 's a fucking giant turtle with cannons attacthed to its shell . 
  pidgeotto/pidgeot looks majestic . 
  also lapras for the same reason . 
  venasaur looks cool too . 
  ampharos : cute but useful mofo . 
  i like frosslass for her design and type combination . 
  beartic looks intimidating . 
  and yes , you 're reading well : linoone . 
  i had two of these lads in my mono normal sapphire playthrough . 
  i chose normal because i did n't know which one to pick so i stuffed all types into an item randomizer and normal came out . 
  fighting roxanne is hell but it 's very satisfying to beat norman ( your dad ) with his same mono type , it 's like the torch was being passed or something ( i previously did n't know how the story went ) . 
  edit : i 'm so disconsiderate . 
  how could i forget my two sinnoh aces ? 
  i had two crobats ( lvl 85 before touching the league ) on my mono poison run and poor cynthia was reported to not having been able to sit down in an entire week . 
  username checks out . 
  dude ... not right now . 
  ohohohoho i 'm amassing tons of popcorn for when driverless , safe cars become a widespread reality . 
  the entire transport sector is going to be shaken , if not collapsed altogether . 
  `` freaky with you '' or `` careless whisper '' ? 
  anyway , i understand this tribalism is proper of human beings and maybe we need to give it time for culture to adapt to progressiveness , but man ... it 's retarded to try to enforce your morality on others ( sorry ixfps ) . 
  and twice as retarded if you condemn a group you belong to . 
  i used to watch a dude called seannaners on youtube and between all of his dumb and fun nonsense , i will never forget him saying `` gay sex does n't make you gay '' . 
  it 's ok if you wan na try whatever unless you harm others ( and even that could be sort of ok if the other person consents ? 
  that 's fringe hardcore sex anyway and a special subset ) . 
  ** what happens in your fucking bedroom is your business and your partner 's only ** . 
  but then again , i did n't have supply side jesus rammed into my head since i was small , thank god . 
  i think that 's a trend in american media as a whole . 
  theres * has * to be a muslim tucked in somewhere and an lgbt and some latinos and asians here and there . 
  seems forced . . 
  such a positive story . 
  i 'm glad for you . 
   also some are just super trippy and its fun to relive them, 
  once i dreamt of a ufc fight night , but the wrestlers were old soccer commentators dressed in full suits . 
  they were from latin america and i knew both of them spoke spanish but both of their names were john ( in english ) . 
  upon getting into the ring , they were given super soaker guns to fight with , rather than punching each other . 
  the guns fired french fries , ketchup and mustard . 
  i woke up laughing at how my brain was n't even trying to make it look like a dream . 
  well , my uncle is a conservative man , likeable but clueless at times . 
  he also likes to invade afghanistan and irak in his spare time and he has a banner that says :, 
  ** mission accomplished **,
