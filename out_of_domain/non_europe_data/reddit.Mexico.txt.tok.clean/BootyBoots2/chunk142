  what is not so intuitive is how war propaganda effectively dehumanizes the people who are perceived as the enemy , or even the innocents surrounding the enemy , dismissing their lives as `` collateral damage '' . 
  so perhaps the original idea is not so wrong after all , but it 's not songs or videogames what to watch out for ; it 's t.v news . 
  religious people ... 
  they voted for `` grab them by the pussy '' who does n't have a nice marriage record either . 
  he also said that his daughter has `` a very nice figure '' ( ca n't blame him , though ) . 
  for all their outcry about conservativism they should have figuratively burnt him in a stake for being `` a degenerate incestuous demon '' or something along the way but they did n't . 
  where did the stiffness go ? 
  well , i consider myself a centrist ( which does n't say anything in american terms ) and i do n't think that if the doomsday scenario your 're painting happens , the next president will be lenin reincarnated to balance things out . 
  america is way too stable for that . 
  gun advocates play the `` guns are what prevents the government from taking over '' card , but i think that actually is how decentralized the power is ( and no , it 's not all about `` states rights '' ) . 
  when trump tried to fulfill his promise of the muslim ban , he got deflected by a judge who ruled his ban unconstitutional and i think this is the 3rd time he tries to dismantle obamacare unsuccessfully . 
  the point is : he has a lot of power with consequences that can last for generations , but not nearly enough to provoke a very radical change . 
  this is why i do n't agree with the `` scorched earth '' policy of some trump voters . 
  america is not just another banana republic . 
  there are some things about merica that are very defensible indeed , and people will donwnvote you if you try to put up an honest , respectful stand against the circlejerk . 
  which happens all over reddit , but it 's proof we 're not `` better '' than mainstream reddit either ...

  wow . 
  that 's pretty awesome !, 
  i 'm glad you 're living a happy life .

  when does hillary come riding a dragon to reclaim what 's her 's ? 
  wait , the bride 's dad from big fat greek wedding is real ?? 
  edit : did n't scroll down . 
  so said einstein in one of the quotes on call of duty that appears when you die . 
  i do n't . 
  what 's the need to parade their morality ? 
  the wright bros. were american . 
  i share your sentiment wholeheartedly . 
  i 'm content that my country is not `` relevant '' because relevant usually means `` we conquered a shit ton of land and imposed our ways onto people '' . 
  i do n't think that 's something to be proud out of the realm of rts videogames . 
  scientific and technological development * is * something to be proud of , but ironically that 's being glossed over : the * real * thing they should be proud about is `` my country allocates effective resources in scientific development and that translates in many new technologies which benefit the world '' . 
  i 'm gon na get downvoted for this , but that 's the true american exceptionalism . 
  color t.v was invented by a mexican , but americans perfected it and made an industry out of it . 
  meanwhile we are left with the pride of his brilliant mind being born on our soil , but that does n't provide jobs for people nor it creates wealth . 
  americans excel at refining existing inventions and making money out if them ( and to be fair , they * do * register the highest amount of patents per year and their papers have the most citations ) . 
   i could n't think of many american names who were quite as influential in the field . 
  you 're begging for a moon landing reference . 
  and no , the nazis did n't do everything . 
  honestly , the history of aerodynamics is not my strong suit but maybe the names slapped in american plane manufacturers could be ones to add to that list . 
  as a student of engineering i have read of prandtl and his works because of fluid dynamics , but he was mostly involved in the science that led to those developments , but not in the technology developed after them . 
  agree . 
  the point is to showcase the written content , is n't it ? 
  anyway , this is n't about what people should or should not , i just expressed that i did n't like people downvoting suff to flaunt their morality and then taking the screenshot , much unlike the user above me . 
  easy now ... 
  congrats on your new job and welcome to a new stage in your life !, 
  i enrolled into a gym 6 weeks ago and i really did n't speak to anybody , just minding my business and following the instructor 's orders in a polite but boring way . 
  as time went by i slowly dared to nake some gestures as visibly but quietly grining/laughing at the jokes that i was naturally able to listen but when i was not a part of the conversation ( i did n't do it on purpose so they could see me , just let stuff happen ) , now i get along in a much friendlier way with him and i can chit-chat with more people as well . 
  maybe they did take notice and became more opened up to me when i tried bite-sized , meaningless conversations with them and when that happened , i made sure to introduce myself at the end and ask for their names in order to be able to greet them using their names in future occasions . 
  i also said `` good morning '' to people i knew when i had the chance . 
  you 'll be able to sort out the ones who are most open to making friends with you if you can read body language and social situations . 
  if not , just keep in mind that if you do anything with the intention of provoking a positive feeling and you fail , you 're going to provoke cringe , so the safe side is just not forcing any interaction . 
  footnote : you are a woman in peak reproductive age and most likely you 're gon na get hit . 
  take provisions for it , so things run smoothly at work . 
  good luck !, 
  you coud n't deny yourself the pleasure , could you ... 
  i feel you 're taking advantage of my ignorance to * heavily * downplay the contributions that america has made in the history of aviation and space exploration . 
  but since i do n't have any counterargument to prove my point , i 'll shut up about it . 
  thank you for your dedicated response . 
  spanish is my native language and we hardly call a fire extinguisher `` extintor de incendios '' in its entire lenght . 
  we just call it `` extintor '' . 
  but that 's mexico anyway , maybe other countries do call it by its full name , though . 
  when i replied to artboiz , i meant to highlight a key contribution to aviation . 
  not that america invented and developed airplanes and shuttles all by itself , because ever since antiquity humans have tried to fly , and the french and the germans started doing it with their balloons and zeppelins , and prior to that there was the da vinci experiments and stuff like that . 
  it 's just that around the wright bros 's time . 
  stuff started to develop really quickly and america took a very important role in that , which i felt you downplayed , that 's all .

  long ago , the \u2676 archetypes lived together in \u262e , then everything changed when the rational nation attacked . 
  only the avatar , master of all \u2676 archetypes could them , but when the needed him most , he vanished \u26da . 
  a years passed and u/rimmer112 and i discovered the avatar , an bender named u/epicdarkrai491 , and although his bending skillz are great \u2714 , he has a lot to learn \u2676 he 's ready to save anyone . 
  but i believe darkrai can save the, 
  easy girl , he 's probably a jaded esfj .
