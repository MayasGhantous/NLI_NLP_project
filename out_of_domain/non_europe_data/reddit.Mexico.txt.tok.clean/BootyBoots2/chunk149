  perhaps a variation of this strategy is using a passive element that makes you feel very good and distracts you from the boring house chore like aromatherapy , ambient music , a certain type of lighting , etc. 
  i think this is going to work because * it does n't feel like work . 
  * and at the end you get the satisfaction of looking at a clean area and getting maintenance work done while feeling good . 
  why do n't you give it a try if you can ? 
  maybe it suits you . 
  i 'm mexican , and i 'm aware that there are different variants of spanish throughout latin america . 
  nevertheless it 's still easy to communicate to a person that comes from , lets say , argentina . 
  i wonder if this happens in the arabic speaking sphere as well . 
  god dammit . 
  i 'm sick and tired of listening to this rebel scum propaganda over and over again . 
  they got lucky , the force was with them . 
  ( have n't you ever thought it works both ways ? 
  it empowers lord vader and emperor palpatine , but it also empowers those jedi terrorists as much our leaders ), 
  the engineers who designed our beloved battle station were counted amongst the most brilliant and gifted minds our entire galaxy has ever seen . 
  we are talking about the greatest weapon ever created on this galaxy , something that we could n't have even dreamed about 1 esc ( earth standard century ) before . 
  a battle station so mighty and colossal it was comparable to a natural satellite ( it even outsized some dwarf planets !! ), 
  and it * moved * . 
  of course it was not going to be perfect , it was designed to near perfection and taking into account the massive resources poured into it ( which include but are not limited to our finest men and women ) it was taken for granted that any attempt to hit those 2 meters wide thermal exhaust ports would be utter suicide . 
  and it was , for the most of the red squadron . 
  ( later renamed rogue ), 
  leia betrayed us and was resourceful enough to steal our plans and exploit our only weakness . 
  obi wan kenobi and his filth came just in time to rescue her ( she was about to be rightfully sentenced to death penalty ) and on top of this her disgustingly incestuous brother managed to pull off a lucky shot because the force flows through him . 
  it was the most unlucky turn of events for us . 
  ** it was not the engineers ' fault , not our personnel fault and it was not lord vader 's fault nor our emperor 's . 
  we just had bad luck . 
  this sacrifice will not go unanswered . 
  never forget the freedom star . 
  most importantly never forget it 's brave personnel and what their job on our monumental beacon of safety and civilization meant to the galaxy . 
  ** tl : dr ** : learning is directly proportional to motivation and reviewing and inversely proportional to the amount of new material covered per session . 
  this conclusion was reached by using a very simplified model . 
  context : i 'm currently learning russian ( with aims to acquire the abilities of reading , speaking and writing proficiently on that language ) and i inducted some concepts i want to share with you guys . 
  observation : i just realized i paraphrased [ this ted-talk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mgbikgcwny ) . 
  i know learning depends on many things ranging from genetics to proper feeding . 
  but focusing on the learning process as it is and assuming external and internal factors you can hardly control are beneficial to learning ( you have an average or above average i.q , you live in a quiet place , ( you do n't fear for your life , etc. ), 
  you do n't any psychological/psychiatric problems , you are well fed , etc. ), 
  you can simplify the learning and mental abilities effectiveness to a relation of direct and inverse proportionality . 
  * the effectiveness of learning and ability acquisition is directly proportional to your motivation . 
  ( do you need to acquire this skill to survive ? 
  are you infatuated with the nature/aspects of this skill/knowledge ? 
  do you need this skill as a basic building block of another skill you desire to get ? ), 
  * the effectiveness of learning and ability acquisition is directly proportional to the time spent on reviewing the concepts acquired . 
  ( you 're not going to forget your english language skills anytime soon because you 're repeating its use everyday , and each day it passes the grammar sinks more and more until it becomes hardwired , so it happens with walking and other abilities we take for granted ), 
  * the effectiveness of learning and ability acquisition is inversely proportional to the amount of new material covered in a single session of study/ability acquisition . 
  so the scenario where the most effective learning/ability acquisition happens for a person who is hypothetically `` personality-less '' consists on acquiring a small amount of basic material and review it until it `` sinks '' on the person 's mind . 
  then said person can use it 's previous knowledge/ability to acquire a new small amount of material and cover a slightly larger amount of practice that involves the usage of the new material and and the same time , that involves the usage of the * formerly acquired * material . 
  then repeating the stocking , acquiring and refining process until reaching the level of mastery desired/needed . 
  sounds guardian-esque does n't it ? 
  well , sadly yes . 
  but positive ( and negative ) habits can be acquired by all people ( hence the analogy with the hypothetical `` personality-less '' individual ) including us . 
  reflection about paraphrasing the ted-talk : has it ever happened to you that you store information ( can you name that `` learning '' ? ), 
  and reason it but you still need to live and experience for yourself before you get the same conclusion yourself ? 
  the difference between storing information and learning ( in my own concept , not a formal psychology definition ) is that when you 're learning , the abstract concepts become internalized in yourself . 
  whereas storing information just involves collecting it . 
  this includes but does not limit to : measurements of height , weight , width , biceps , thighs , feet , body fat and whatever you come up with to set a rp standard version of the man of vitruvius . 
  i read [ this article ] ( http://idibon.com/toxicity-in-reddit-communities-a-journey-to-the-darkest-depths-of-the-interwebs/ ) and i found it interesting that the upvotes and especially downvotes can be used as a tool to prevent bigotry , toxicity and keep our community `` nice '' ( that 's actually what the mod 's stickied post was about ), 
  so what 's on you mind when you upvote and when you downvote ? 
  ( `` i dislike this '' is perfectly valid choice ), 
  beforehand i want to assure you i consider this an extremely serious theme ( immigration , islam , inclusion , civil rights , amongst others ) i consider myself a libertarian and a progressive , but events like this really make me challenge my views . 
  being in ** t ** p 's i 'd like you to read your opinions about all that surrounds this event in terms of politics , with a projection to the future . 
  i am aware that a huge part of terrorism is to spread terror ( this will probably be discussed everywhere in the span of a month at least , or even more because of the charlie hebdo attacks ) and precisely lead the public to discuss this kinds of subjects in order to coerce them to their bidding . 
  feel free to send me a message to take this thread down if it 's too disturbing . 
  ( perhaps you consider r/intp a safe haven where you can escape reality in some way , i try to take stuff like that into account ), 
  edit : friendly reminder ; this subject causes intense emotions to surface , please keep it civil . 
  edit 2 : i did n't know beirut was attacked as well , and more people died there than in paris . 
  edit 3 : i just thought about this ... why the bataclan theater , the football stadium and a restaurant ? 
  think about it , amongst all the targets they could 've chosen , they chose those ones ? 
  why not any of the extremely iconic landmarks like the eiffel tower , the arch of triumph , the cathedral of notre-dame , the monument to the invalid , the louvre , the church of the madelaine , etc ? 
  they could have attempted to destroy or damage any of those invaluable landmarks that are too iconic of france , and they could have claimed they were `` symbols of infidelity '' . 
  ( monuments celebrating the military deeds of a secular nation , a museum filled with paintings which are haram and temples of non-islamic worship , one of them dedicated to mary magdalene , allegedly a prostitute before her conversion to christianity , [ and most importantly , a woman , we 're talking about isis here ] ) but they did n't ... 
  sorry , i 'll join twwa ( text wall writer anonymous ) someday ... 
  ** tl ; dr ** : how can we prevent radicalization within a system of beliefs ? , could it be that balance ( in order to prevent radicalization ) be detrimental so we need to radicalize ourselves for the greater good ? 
  when a person subscribes to a set of ideas ( belief system ) there are good and bad points about it . 
  nevertheless i think most ( or all of them ? ), 
  are susceptible of becoming radical , and the response of that radicalization is the opposite radical ideology sitting on the far side of the spectrum . 
  yesterday , i was dwelling in r/purplepilldebate ( sometimes i enjoy masochism , i know ... ) and i re-realized that both `` redpillers '' and `` bluepillers '' alike tend to have unhealthy visions of relationships and the understanding of human nature , this happens because of the radicalization of their system of beliefs . 
  take this example into account : a former `` beta '' adopts the rp lifestyle and now gets lots of sex and his life improves in many aspects , so he fully endorses the rp ideology because he 's seen `` the truth '' . 
  now , this ideology can go as far as trying to bring ancient harsh religious codes of conduct back `` because civilization was built on it '' so naturally , the blue pill had it 's stance that reaches as far ~ ~ as letting women get away with committing crimes against men ~ ~ . 
  neither of these ( example ) attitudes promotes a functional society , but they do have points going for them , and their ideology does reflect the world at a certain extent , but it 's easy for them to become fossilized on their beliefs . 
  i used the `` pills '' to illustrate my point but what about grooming , for example ? 
  in most cases , to care for one 's appearance is often more [ beneficial ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/4d/16/d6/4d16d62ca692992b3445b6e99ef4c62d.jpg ) than not . 
  so the logical thing is to groom more , right ? 
  the more the better . 
  could it be that [ overdoing ] ( http://img.izismile.com/img/img5/20120217/640/celebs_with_plastic_surgery_640_53.jpg ) it exists ? 
  this seems extend to every single belief system and/or group . 
  ( can we say we 're speaking about cults/their cultification ? ), 
  we know thinking and knowing is beneficial but , could it be that just mindlessly following ( the stereotyped opposite ) be beneficial in some cases/most cases ? 
  what about human rights ? 
  is there such a thing as `` too much human rights '' ? 
  is torturing , maiming and/or depriving a person of basic needs ever justified or could it be necessary to protect a certain community , ( ironically to protect them from groups that want to take down their human rights ) or are they truly universal ? 
  when a person lives in an environment where these beliefs are reinforced thoroughly at all times , a person can become a supporter of said beliefs because they do n't know any better and they do n't have a point of comparison to reach for new points of view that lead to new ideas . 
  taking this into account i ask : am i involved in a cult without knowing it ? 
  ( shaped by access to media , for example ) should i stop worrying about it ? 
  am i becoming paranoid ? 
  ( which at a certain extent fulfills the same damage as a cult ), 
  so a natural answer can be to always be balanced , but then again , could balance be overdone ? 
  should we lean or forthwith radicalize ourselves at a given time ? 
  edit : picked a bad example with the bluepill . 
  i spent several hours looking for a clear example to illustrate my claim but i could n't substantiate it . 
  in general , they appear not to be as nearly as overtly biased as the redpillers . 
  and by not providing a link exposing a critical , polarized bias of them , i incurred in a logical fallacy .
