  it simply bestows too much power and relies too much on the good will of the government so that abuses will not be committed against the populace . 
  perhaps it might work in functional democracies where the people in power are actually serving the public that elected them instead of helping themselves , but in other countries with structural problems this could be catastrophic . 
  an organization that draws my attention very much is the nsa . 
  the nsa stands for `` national security agency '' i have n't dwelled very much into it , but it seems their goal is to prevent american homeland terrorism . 
  if it prevented 9/11 it would have fulfilled its duty with flying colors . 
  but it did n't . 
  but the planes came from abroad , right ? 
  well , how about the tsarnaev 's and the boston marathon ? 
  that was entirely a homeland issue . 
  the most functional democracies are the ones that are scrutinized by the populace . 
  but , how do you scrutinize the effectiveness and behavior of an agency that has secrecy as its official language ? 
  everything is classified , if we know something is through wistleblowers . 
  how can we know the triumphs it has had , the catastrophes it has prevented ? 
  how do we prevent its abuse ? 
  is it a necessary agency for the security of the people or a waste of taxpayers ' money and a potential source if government authoritarianism and the institution of a police state ? 
  i 'm still trying to decode how this awesome cog cube relates to sex ... 
  edit : do n't try to frighten our fe with your erotic ways u/intp -02 . 
  your sad devotion to emotion and sexual pleasure has not help you gain happiness , or given you clairvoyance enough to find the g. . . 
  one of my personal rules is `` do n't spoil the fun unless said fun is harmful '' . 
  the problem with this is that when people gather in large groups they tend to acquire a `` hive mind '' and somehow loose their individual consciousness to replace it with a collective consciousness dictated by a random primitive mind . 
  trying to impose reasoning to a hyped large group is a complete challenge for us , as we have to use the collective mind to our benefit , not fight it . 
  ( but this is super counter-intuitive to us ), 
  but , why are we less susceptible to enter hive minds ? 
  i blame it to high frontal cortex activity ( aka overthinking ) that shields us from the said hive mind mentality , thus preserving our individual thinking ( although not entirely , as hive minds are hardwired into our brains because of human evolution ) but prevents us to do `` normal '' stuff like easing the acquisition of manual skills ( like driving , using tools , cooking , etc. ), 
  and `` letting go '' ( have you ever experienced the fun other types feel when dancing/screaming woooooooo !!, 
  to a beat drop/switch to other cool song/etc . 
  while drunk ? 
  i have , it 's awesome , but it 's not cool to not be able to reach that point without intoxicating myself ), 
  i think our challenge as intp 's is to modulate our brain and develop a technique to lessen the activity of the frontal cortex when convenient , and be let ourselves loose in any other situation . 
  social situations and dealing with others feelings is a different cup of tea . 
  logical systems can be dissected and analyzed at will , as long as their are functional and consistent , they 're fine . 
  science is a little bit different ; while logic is a great tool for advancing , there is knowledge that is counter-intuitive because it 's not compatible with common sense that is based on previous experience . 
  [ * skip the next paragraph if you want , it 's an explanation of mine about why logic is not always compatible to the progress of science * ], 
  ** e.g ** : it was perfectly logical to think the earth is flat and the sun moves around the earth and not otherwise because we see the sun moving in the sky across the day , it 's not obvious to the human eye that actually the earth is the reference point and that 's why our perception makes us think the sun moves around the earth . 
  same thing with the flatness of the earth ; gravity was not a well understood concept back then , so the earth being flat explained perfectly why you would n't fall into space if you were in , for example , argentina or actually anywhere else besides the north pole . 
  ** end of explanation **, 
  and then there are the feelings . 
  then again , to integrate said feelings to a logical system , the best way to deal with them is trough experience . 
  as other types are intuitive to social norms and we 're simply not intuitive because the configuration of energies that govern our life simply does n't allow us to do that . 
  we 're not likely to deal with feelings because it 's our inferior function , so the ti-ne solution to it would be to acquire data based on previous experiences , which means trial an error . 
  but , to the toxic perfectionist intp this could be daunting precisely because our fe would be like : `` no please nooooo !!, 
  i beg of you , do n't expose your ineptitude to society , pleaseee !!! '', 
  and sadly , our fe can be very vocal , mostly in social failures . 
  we are our worst critic , as most people wo n't give a single fuck about us . 
  i constantly end up writing freaking text walls , dammit . 
  awesome !, 
  i think if i had a girlfriend with a genius level intellect , i 'd feel very undermined haha . 
  but actually being a genius means you learn things much quicker and see patterns in a much more discernible way than others . 
  though this is extremely valuable , it does n't make you any better of a human being . 
  it seems terry is a nice guy to hang out with ... 
  bruh ... 
  there was n't a lebanon megathread on reddit . 
  the sad snoo is also holding a french flag , and now people on facebook have french flag filters , not lebanese ones . 
  maybe some people care about lebanon , but the entity known as `` the west '' has it 's eyes on france . 
  it sort of reveals that not just governments but people at large only care about the lives of people that can relate to , not to human lives in general . 
  i also had a relationship with an enfp . 
  much lesser sexual activity , though . 
  [ ** breathing intensifies ** ], 
  ohh . . 
  well , more than advice , i 'll point an observation :, 
  i 've enjoyed dancing and `` having fun and letting go '' when drunk . 
  and my suspicion is that mt frontal cortex activity is too high . 
  i saw the stuff about it in a video or read about it somewhere but i ca n't remember , so take it with a pinch of salt . 
  thanks for the resources !, 
  i 've heard a lot of negative comments about him , and i honestly have a loosely preconceived image of him . 
  ( i laughed when i read the title ) but i ca n't judge him because i know anything about him . 
  ( and even if i devoured all the media surrounding his life , how could i ? ), 
   i can blend into any group or situation, 
  [ it 's in your blood , son ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifj-0lknycc#t=1m25s ), 
  or their dialect of arabic , so they can read it . 
  well , it 's difficult to know what would i do , because i think people act in accordance to their emotion in times of such distress ( or at least i had , it 's hardwired as a survival instinct i guess ), 
  but thinking it a little , going with the flow does n't sound like a bad idea because people tend to move like a fluid when moving in large groups at the same time ( like in this year 's hajj stampede ) so in order to not die by being stomped on , getting to the center would be a good idea , but just to not get squashed . 
  after that contact security officers if available , if not try to get out of there as fast as possible . 
  while doing that , try to warn the police via mobile phone . 
  ( although by the time this happens they 'll already be on their way ), 
  after crossing one of the exits go to either a police station , friend/family house or the place where you 're staying . 
  do not use buses , as they 're a favorite target for islamic suicide bombings . 
  ( most probably islamic but they could be due to anything else ), 
  stay tuned for news in your mobile . 
  they can shed a light in the current events so that you avoid the areas where other terrorist attacks are taking place . 
  the quicker you get home or someplace `` safe '' the better . 
  i do n't know if getting to your car or stopping a taxi if you 're lucky is a good idea ... 
  they might be waiting for you in the parking lot as a trap , or perhaps people get too distressed and traffic accidents become prone to happen . 
  i do n't know ... 
  ignoring the foul language , and as an intp who read many books on body language and pick up artistry , i can tell you that saying `` you ca n't be needy '' or `` stop overthinking at once ! '', 
  is an insult to our personalities . 
  it turns out to be our inferior function is fe , ( extroverted feeling ) which spoils our social skills for the most part . 
  those abilities and knowledge that most people have `` by default '' are totally lacking on us . 
  we have to develop them from the absolute zero , nevertheless , society expect us to behave like if we started with at least 20/100 ( the scale is just to illustrate the example ), 
  as for overthinking concerns , ti ( introverted thinking ) is our main driving force , and our secondary and tertiary functions compliment , enrich and empower this main function . 
  ( this means we 're natural overthinkers ), 
  being a pick up artist is quite a challenge for us because we have to hinder or even reverse our nature to achieve the skills we need to `` get dem bitches '' . 
  tell a `` natural '' to create complex logical systems , question his/her life or government or solve calculus or differential equations problems , see how it goes ... 
  it was a demoralizing defeat for us all . 
  i was up at the space in my interceptor and i saw the super star destroyer fall and explode . 
  super . 
  star . 
  destroyer . 
  you ca n't get any more badass than that , and it was destroyed by a damn suicide vessel !, 
  i thought such a colossal destroyer was invulnerable to such poor attacks .
