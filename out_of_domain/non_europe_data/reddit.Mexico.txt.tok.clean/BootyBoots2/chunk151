  i 'm stuck near the first order territories , could a fellow trooper or pilot tell me where are the hub points to get to the corellian sector ? 
  and how did you deal with it to implement such knowledge to your growth ? 
  e.g : i kind of empathize with creationists now ; they believe the world is literally around 5000 years old because that belief has been hammered in their lives for a long time , so the idea of evolution rustles their jimmies because it heavily contradicts their values . 
  people , creationism vs. evolution is ** not ** what this thread is about , please do n't loose scope . 
  ** edit : ** people are coming up with valuable testimonies regarding religious background , it 's acceptable and most welcome . 
  what i did n't want was this thread becoming a discussion of creationism vs. evolutionism ( which is improbable because fortunately we do n't have any preachers but possible becuase ... well ... we 're intps , it not uncommon we derail from stuff ) . 
  i am intelligent : i can discern patterns , think trough problems and propose solutions ; yet i often struggle at making simple calculations fast , sometimes forget people 's names and do n't quite think what i 'll say next , or simply do n't have the right words at hand so i need to break for a while -- which is very bad in conversations because you come off as slow witted -- in order to get my speech together . 
  does anybody else have that problem ? 
  taken down , and re-submitted because i briefly forgot that any content discussion is , by definition , a spoiler . 
  does n't matter how mild it is . 
  [ this link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sktc8chvw5k#t=0m47s ) leads to a talk between cersei and littlefinger in season ii , which corresponds to `` a clash of kings '' . 
  please keep it civil and refrain from posting spoilers ( i 'm reading the 3rd book ) . 
  context for the people who are not familiarized with game of thrones/a song of ice and fire :, 
  ** queen cersei does anything it takes to keep power ** and is queen regnant now in place of her son . 
  in order to better accomplish this , she needs to recapture arya stark , a young girl . 
  thing is , ** the king -- cersei 's son -- and his bothers ** -- prince tommen and princess myrcella -- ** are the offspring of her and jaime lannister , her brother ** . 
  incest is a * big * deal in this medieval setting because of the justice system , and ** the political situation is quite delicate at the time ** . 
  ** littlefinger is an ambitious man who grew up from being a nobody to having an important seat in the king 's council because of his good management of money ** ( he 's the minister of coin , the kingdom 's equivalent of a minister of economy/secretary of treasury for most countries ) . 
  this is remarkably meritorious because in the got world , if you were born in a wealthy family , you could have easy access to wealth , food , sex , power and basically you had all your needs and wants covered . 
  but if you were born a peasant ; things were a lot more rougher . 
  there was hardly any social mobility ( it was rigged for things to be that way ) . 
  ** littlefinger was the personal accountant to one of the realms ' -- riverrun -- leader until he got exiled for trying to marry his life-long love ** ( arya 's mother ) . 
  conversation, 
  | actual conversation | actual meaning |, 
  | cersei : a mockingbird ? 
  you created your own sigil , did n't you ? 
  appropriate . 
  for a self-made man with so many songs to sing . 
  | i can extract any information from you by torturing you at my leisure . 
  | littlefinger : i 'm glad you like it . 
  some people are born into the right family , others have to find their own way . 
  | bitch please , your merit was to be lucky enough to be born off the right vagina . 
  i climbed up the ladder to success * despite * people like you , so do n't try to intimidate me ; it wo n't work . 
  | cersei : i heard a song once , about a boy of modest means ... found his way to the home of a very prominent family ; he loved the eldest daughter , sadly she had eyes for another . | it 's rigged , so what ? 
  deal with it . 
  if it was n't rigged your sweetheart would have married you but instead she married the man assigned for him on a scripted marriage by her father . 
  or was it due to your lack of manliness ? 
  ( littlefinger lost a duel to the groom-to-be ), 
  | littlefinger : when boys and girls live in the same home , awkward situations can arise ; sometimes , i 've heard , even brothers and sisters develop certain affections . 
  and when those affections become common knowledge ... well , that is an awkward situation indeed . 
  especially in a prominent family . 
  prominent families often forget a simple truth . 
  i found ... | i know you 're fucking your brother . 
  but guess who does n't ? 
  the people . 
  if the people find out about that your precious power will be of no use to you when the populace looses it up for having enough of your shit . 
  and guess what ... 
  | cersei : and which truth is that ? 
  | spit it out , asshole . 
  | littlefinger : knowledge is power . 
  | i know your dirty little secret . 
  and if you get any funny ideas , you 'll pay up with your head . 
  or get raped . 
  | cersei orders the guards to seize him , and murder him but then repents and orders them to ceremoniously retreat | this is an obvious display of power . 
  | cersei : power is power . 
  do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the stark girl for me . 
  i would very much appreciate it . 
  | do n't come at me with your petty mind games . 
  i control the swords that can chop your head and dick off . 
  try not to piss me off . 
  keep me happy . 
  * yes , the targaryens did n't give a fuck about incest because they were the rulers of all the land and they kind of did a better job at unifying the realms . 
  however , nobody ever approved that . 
  what do you think about it ? 
  i guess we need to be able to interpret * people 's intentions * rather than their words sometimes to really get what they mean . 
  it 's certainly not logically consistent with what 's it 's said ( after all , cersei seemingly ordered to get a man 's throat slit because of some chatter involving affectionate brothers and success ) , because `` the feels '' -- or in this case , the ** intentions -- need not be communicated within the frame of logic that gives logical speech coherence and structure needed , it 's more of an unnecessary constraint ** . 
  during my service years , i mated with a twi ` lek female slave . 
  there . 
  i finally said it . 
  do you think niles samson from gow 2 is an intp or an intj ? 
  i think he 's one of us . 
  edit : on a second thought i think he leans more to the j side , with the whole superiority discourse and intolerance to filth ( stereotypical intj , i know ... ), 
  with all these sanders and scalia drama + elections to come i guess there must be lots of people who are kind of confused about it ... this sub should be a superb place for people of other countries to talk about stuff . 
  or any other important personal belonging ? 
  i stumbled on [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfrtkcge40a ) thanks to r/circlejerk or the like and i re-read leviticus to fact-check the song for fun . 
  i have actually read the whole old testament -- minus the psalms -- and i remember the part about the fall of sodom and gomorrah . 
  because of that , i thought anal sex -- sodomy -- was forbidden ( and explicitly pusnished with death on leviticus in the case of men-to-men interaction ) . 
  yet leviticus does n't specifically state punishments for male-to-female sodomy . 
  is heterosexual sodomy specifically forbidden ( or better yet , having a punishment for being commited ) in a later text of the old -- or new -- testament ? 
  if yes ; could you cite the versicle , please ? 
  ** edit ** : i fucked up with the title , it should have been : is sodomy -- referring to anal sex -- not explicitely punished in the bible for heterosexual relationships in the way homosexual anal sex is ? 
  on either my laptop or cellphone ; i do n't know why it happens or how to fix it . 
  when i click on a timestamp the video re-starts from the beginning , instead of playing at the exact time of the timestamp i just clicked on . 
  solutions , anyone ? 
  edit : it looks like this is a general problem on youtube , independent of the browser . 
  but for the record , i use chrome on both of my devices . 
  while walking , i had this idea : maybe sensing and feeling are some kind of fast-tracked thinking devices . 
  since thinking ( ti , te ) requires * analysis * it also requires * time * to perform calculations and evaluate principles dictated by knowledge . 
  time that we do n't have even in modern life , less yet in ancient times . 
  for instance : if you have to cross the street by walking and there 's fluid but still somewhat heavy traffic then you have to be alert and trust in the input your senses generate in order to quickly evaluate the situation and make a decision . 
  with te you 'd probably be pulling out your calculator and physics notes to compute the time you 'd have if you took the shot . 
  by then , you 'd have lost your chance and if you were on the middle of the road you 'd have cause and accident or be already dead . 
  for the notion and blurry concepts i have about feeling in the sense of cognitive functions , i think it works just like sensing in the sense of self-preservation , just oriented to the treatment of animals , rather than just physical objects . 
  e.g : if you encounter an intimidating loose dog that barks loudly at you and slowly approaches your position , then the choices you 'll make most probably will depend on what your `` gut feeling '' -- completely independently of logic -- tells you ( run !, 
  freeze !, 
  keep walking and pretend it 's not there !, 
  show dominance !, 
  show submissiveness !, 
  befriend it ! ) . 
  same for social occasions : boss is jewish and your friend told you an obscene but awesome jew joke .
