  crack it open in the company 's party or not ? 
  hello !, 
  i 'm a non-mensa member who is above average intelligence but not quite at your level ; and i do struggle at college . 
  now , i understand that being successful at school is mostly hard work , rather than intelligence for average people ; my idea is that past a certaing degree of intelligence -- genious like , but i do n't know how much , numerically speaking in terms of iq -- you can only review the material for a short period of time and them `` absorb it '' . 
  pick any controversial subject you want : in many cases information about the topic are so broad and thorough , it 's really not worth it to go through all of it ( let alone recall it ! ), 
  to have a true , unbiased vision . 
  moreover , this implies having a skill in finding * and interpreting * trustworthy information ; this is specially important when weighing in future consequences of present desicions . 
  i have just come to think how difficult is for me to have a completely unbiased opinion because my mind usually accepts the first piece of information it has from what i consider a reliable source as `` true '' in some issues ( information i was taught in school , for example ) . 
  my motivation to write this post stems from my afterthoughts of visiting a the_donald post about `` muslim science '' . 
  i knew ( probably from a history textbook or some article on the internet ) that an arab scholar discovered algebra . 
  on the_donald there were people arguing that actually there actually were n't any scientific achievements made by muslims , even on their golden age . 
  i checked wikipedia and found an article that confirmed my views , but i did n't perform a full-on research about this to dispel ( at least on a personal level ) the claims of those who said muslims attributed these achievements to themselves and actually stole them from other cultures . 
  i frequent r/subredditdrama and there was [ a linked thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/4kqykr/rkotakuinaction_is_hate_subreddit_of_the_day/ ) to and [ article ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/hatesubredditoftheday/comments/4kneo0/2016523_rkotakuinaction_part_1/ ) in r/hatesubredditoftheday that criticizes kia . 
  i criticized the featured article about kia and got pretty downvoted in srd . 
  it looks like srd shares the opinion that kia is a hate subreddit . 
  the more i read kia to find the hateful parts o it , the more it seems like they are not a hate subreddit . 
  they may be circlejerky and sarcastic , and the main discussion does n't look like it 's ethics in videogames anymore ; but it 's a long way from many r/the _ donald and r/european posts that are fertile ground for legitimately hateful conversations . 
   * hello , users of cmv !, 
  this is a footnote from your moderators .

  look , the need for moderation is becoming increasingly notorious in this sub . 
  the self-policing approach was good while the sub was small , but it has grown ; much to be expected from the intp sub which is the type most prone to deepen in mbti theory . 
  it 's ok for confused newbies to ask if there 's anyone else who also blasts wow music on the car and gets weird looks from people , or to get questions from concerned lovers about whether or not a tactic may work considering the couple 's type ; but it 's not the kind of content we all want to see . 
  so i propose a sort flair system a la r/kotakuinaction . 
  i 'd ask u/thebullshitpatrol or u/omfgninja to grant me moderator status with full permissions and do it myself , but i honestly do n't know how to do it . 
  perhaps somebody from this userbase is better suited to do it . 
  we could add categories like `` typing and identity '' ( questions about other person being intp according to evidence or perception , dae x ? 
  happenings ) , `` relationships '' , `` self help '' ( depressive and asking for advice ) , `` positive observations '' ( for circlejerk and positive praising from other types ) and `` miscellaneous '' for everything else . 
  there have been many threads asking for moderation , the only thing that 's different is that i 'm not asking if somebody will step in . 
  i 'm asking * who * will step in and save us from ourselves . 
  i thought this was about the t.v show , lol . 
  interesting subreddit nonetheless !, 
  hi , i 'm mexican and i 've recently started watching this great show in it 's original language without subtitles . 
  this show sometimes strains me because it 's difficult to follow the technicisms and idioms ; besides , some people make it difficult for me to understand every single word they say ( especially doug and remy ) because of weird accents or the tendency to speak in whispers . 
  #bush and the manipulation of uncertainty, 
  this documentary explores the relationship between media and the way it was colluded with the government in order to convince the american people that their wars were rightful . 
  however , the way this was done across the xx century was unprecedented -- in my perception -- and the tactics used were efficient . 
  as humans , who are quite frankly prone to being biased an rely on emotion , americans bit it hard . 
  think about 9/11 and its aftermath : americans were in utter shock about the wtc attack and bush announced the attack on iraq as :, 
  * liberation from saddam . 
  * eliminating the threat of iraqi nuclear weapons . 
  now , the rationale for invading iraq because of nuclear weapons is * the perception * that saddam was crazy enough to actually use them , bypassing the supposed effectiveness of the mutual assured destruction doctrine . 
  so in the end saddam gets busted , nobody dies by nuclear weapons ( what if all of those civilans bombed with `` small bombs '' make it up for 3 nuke strikes ? ), 
  and america exports its `` freedom '' so the iraqi people live in democracy and american-like stability . 
  seriously , what 's not to like about that plan ? 
  the us , being world 's first economic superpower and having a military force unrivaled at the time , seemed like an unstoppable force . 
  what would possibly go wrong ? 
  well it turns out there were deep religious conflicts in the country that saddam kept in check . 
  brutal and despicable as he was , he kept isis from existing . 
  now that he 's gone said group took much of the middle east and commited horrible attrocities for these people , never mind the social and political instability that shocked europe because of the refugee crisis . 
  * but that was n't evident back then * . 
  which makes us think : what are the unknown unknowns ( quote for somewhere on the video but i could n't find it for context ) of our time ? 
  how could we possibly prepare for them ? 
  #are we less critical than we wish we were ? 
  the manipulation of perceptions and emotional reactions is central to propaganda . 
  what so many people call `` common sense '' . 
  think about this : would it be a good idea to get rid of the entire police force in a population on any given moment ? 
  the obvious answer seems to be `` no '' . 
  however , common sense has the power to create beliefs based on broad guesses that may or not be accurate ( come on , tell me [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usaai3m51jo#t=51m25s ) does n't make sense ) at a first glance and take it as hard truths ; especially when faced towards uncertainty . 
  an example of this is how far right groups claim that europe will have a complete cultural turnaround because of immigration combined with low reproduction rates on european countries . 
  since the european imperialistic powers managed to invade and permanently change ( when not destroyed ) the cultures of the regions they visited , now they fear that europe will go through the same . 
  or safe spaces ; `` good thing criminals obey rules '' , when guns being prohibited ( along with good enforcement ) may prevent shootings . 
  i do n't know about you , but i personally recognize i have an `` authority bias '' , where if a supposed expert shares a possitive opinion , their opinion becomes more valuable that common people . 
  of course you will demand heavy facts before going out on such a huge leap as it is going to war , but for those people that have already been quite indoctrinated at this point , they will simply support the decision . 
  and one or two dissenters do n't really matter when the virtual entirety of the populace supports you . 
  i think this was the reason why people relied on the american sources like hannity rather than more critical ones around the world . 
  ironically , you can see an example of propaganda in the documentary at [ 42:30 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usaai3m51jo#t=42m30s ) : the documentary does n't present any reliable sources to back up that claim ( even if it were true ) , and shows increasing percentages that show that the civilian toll is larger as time goes by , suggesting that in the iraq war , the us basically went there to commit murder to innocent civillians . 
  along the documentary and at the ending speech ( [ 1:08:00 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usaai3m51jo#t=68m0s ) ) there are images of human suffering , which do n't contribute to facts , but cause a powerful emotional reaction which is the opposite of what we need to think critically . 
  as a concluding thought , i think we 've seen the ultimate refinement of propaganda were states do n't have to be openly totalitarian to hide the truth to people . 
  but rather people are looking to get fed the totalitarian confirmation of their own beliefs ; at this point , people brainwash themselves in an environment of free choosing of information ; the dictators utopia . 
  and i think that , while it takes a lot of personal conviction , every one of us has the chance to be manipulated , were the circumstances correct for it . 
  hi , i got cod : mw3 and it came with two extra missions from the ( first collection ) . 
  i was able to download some free maps but when i tried to introduce my code for the missions , it said call of duty elite suspended its activities quite a while ago . 
  is there another way to get it or is it lost forever ? 
  lol . 
  thanks for reading !, 
  they did so by making people associate the meme with ridiculous conspiracy theorists so they would be less self-aware about the actual cabal . 
  the mourning time is up , donald j. trump will become president and his actions have already gotten us worried of what 's in store , he already appointed a white supremacist for chief strategist and acts of violence are starting to erupt in the us . 
  there 's little i can do , and to be fair , there 's little that americans themselves can do in terms of real power , but much we can all do in terms of influence : a russian shill or ctr has the exact same power as a genuine supporter writing on the internet . 
  bannon , ciswhitemaelstrom and his alt-right sphere , [ newt gingrich ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4f5ewiyyuq ) et al. 
  were one step ahead of us when they appealed to the feelings when they masterfully created invisible enemies and something to get behind . 
  they know how the primitive aspect of the human mind works and they exploited far too well . 
  being `` keyboard warriors '' was something some of us mocked and we 're paying the price for it . 
  it 's our turn to do this and voice our opinions , whether we believe in them or not , on the social media . 
  now , i think the new image we need to project is one of welcoming acceptance . 
  think of bush 's approval ratings : they started falling once people realized that he lied , and in trump 's case that 's the vein we have to attack once he fails on his promises . 
  but * instead of confronting trump supporters with logic , we want to validate their feelings and let them see that our side is greener * . 
  i think there are two kinds of trump supporters : the deplorables , who are the ones that adjust to the liberal stereotype , and the strained ones , who are normal people who decided to perform a tiring series of mental gymnastics to see a change . 
  in my perception , * the voter base that selected trump were the deplorables , but it was the strained who supported him into getting elected * . 
  the battlefield has changed and the alt-right has new objectives : brainwashing the strained into deplorables . 
  the deplorables are immune to propaganda because they 're already so brainwashed , they wo n't listen to anything ; it 's not them who we need to target : it 's the strained who we desperately need in our ranks . 
  now , in order to do this , we have to provoke basic emotions on them and i think fear needs to be our workhorse .
