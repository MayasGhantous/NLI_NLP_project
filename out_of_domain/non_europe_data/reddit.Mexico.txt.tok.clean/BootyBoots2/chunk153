  then , * as we give then a cause to fight on our side there will be belonging * ; so in the end , we want to take their strained to turn them into our very own brand of strained and progressively turn them into our fringe group ( tumblr sjws ? ), 
  to cement their ideology and prevent them feeling from our ranks . 
  some assorted observations and tips :, 
  * convincement is not a switch but a sliding bar : progress gradually and do n't get stuck on somebody who is entrenched . 
  ben garrison 's loud cartoons only resound withing the most extreme trumpists who live for politics , rather than those who need good politics to live . 
  * propaganda does n't need to convince everyone : it just needs to convince a majority . 
  so do n't get stuck ; if somebody wo n't budge move on and do n't waste your time . 
  * people need a sense of belonging : grant them that * even if it goes against your beliefs * . 
  do you believe in gun restrictions ? 
  never let that get in the way of de-trumping the gun crowd ( this is much more important than our personal convictions right now ) . 
  suck it up and do n't oppose them on that regard , everyone is a valuable individual on our group . 
  * [ the hasbara handbook is a great resource if you want to know the details of basic propaganda tactics ] ( www.middle-east-info.org/take/wujshasbara.pdf ) . 
  i read the rules to decline the nouns in prepositional case but i could n't find a rule to decline nouns that end in \u044b ; so if i wanted to say `` in his pants '' , for example , i 'd have to decline the noun '' \u0448\u0442\u0430\u043d\u044b '' . 
  what do i do in these cases ? 
  thanks in advance !, 
  apparently , it means `` rest '' . 
  however , i 'm not sure if they mean rest as in `` remainder '' or as in `` break from work '' . 
  i notice that in many aspects of my life i refuse to look for hard data in order to strategize from scratch because i find it fun ; case in point : competitive gaming . 
  there are many people who use the core game mechanics and glitches in order to win by any means necessary , and even when there are many tutorials and resources , i 'll still play the game my way because it 's fun and re-discover strategies even when there are competitive manuals available . 
  another one is chess : i will never read a manual because i feel it would take the fun out of casual matches . 
  what do you guys think ?

  they 're trying to re-create the senate speech . 
  i hope they manage to pull out a huge image , since i 'm a fan . 
  just below the french nyan cat . 
  the ball is still in construction but somebody 's writing text next to it . 
  pokefans unite !, 
  there 's been an announcement on pxls discord that the canvas will be wiped out within a day from now . 
  on the next canvas , we need to do things right . 
  the artwork will be swallowed by nationalists and their monumental images consuming art and taking valueable space if we do not reclaim that territory by force . 
  i liked cosmic corner but it did n't get the necessary strength . 
  lets divide the canvas on semantic sections to help each other out . 
  semantics i can think of right now :, 
  * anime, 
  * pokemon . 
  * movies . 
  * logos ( sports teams/corporate/tv shows/etc ), 
  * hentai ( at least that survived the germans ) . 
  * subreddit representation ( r/foxes was great ) . 
  lets plan ahead to divide the canvas to accomodate these themes . 
  i suggest we plan send our plans - detailed with grid - on advance to the an alliance discord to place the art next to each other and avoid waste of space ( it will be easier to prrotect the art that way ) . 
  that way , all members of the alliance will work on to protect and complete each other 's art . 
  first things first : what is the numerical strength of the nationalists ? 
  how many germans , frenchmen , poles , ukraninans , finns , russians and norwegians were there ? 
  could we compute how many non-nationalists were there at a given time ? 
  how many 4chan members at a given time ? 
  this is important to know who do we have to ally with and who can we afford to make enemies with . 
  discord : https://discordapp.com/channels/300402893658521600/300402893658521600, 
  we 'll help you guys when the canvas resets . 
  in the meantime , why do n't you help us out with our current project ? 
  check our discord out . 
  i need to find the diplomats for her . 
  we 're a support group that want 's to help you get completed . 
  we are currently protecting the nerd [ left to that leaf ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/qofcn ) , but the owner decided to paint the rightmost tooth on the foreground rather than on the background . 
  as a representative of the art protection guild , i apologize for that behaviour , yet still we need to contact your people to agree on a definitive border and if so you please , an alliance . 
  contact us on discord : https://discord.gg/w3swn4s . 
  welcome to the guild . 
  we are an organized server devoted to protect art from griefers . 
  what we do :, 
  * protect art from ongoing attacks . 
  * launch restoration assaults to retrieve art from girefers . 
  * restore damaged art to normal when griefers are not active . 
  * watch over our members art . 
  occasionally , our members help with project completion , but we always prioritize defense and restoration over building . 
  notice that art protection guild will * not defend or restore artworks who have n't requested our assistance * . 
  how to become a member of the guild and have your art protected :, 
  simply file a request on #protection and we will answer the call . 
  use the following format :, 
  @here attack on [ name of artwork or prominent feature ] ( coordinates ) [ template ] e.g :, 
  @here attack on kana ( 1948,183 ) [ load template ], 
  once your art is restored , we will permanently watch over it . 
  as a guild member , we expect you to join our forces when we launch corrective assault on other members ' art . 
  in short , we scratch your back and you scratch ours back . 
  please keep an eye on #protection once in a while . 
  upon feedback , we have decided to stop using the @everyone tag when calling for defense . 
  current defense/restorations templates will be pinned on #defense . 
  who we help :, 
  everyone who requests our help with the following exceptions :, 
  * flags . 
  * political symbols in general ( we consider pepe and to be one due to the association of its image with the recent american elections and the alt-right movement , same for left-wing associated political movements such as blm and communist paraphernalia ) . 
  * nsfw art . 
  * art that is still in the construction stages . 
  our defense priorities :, 
  upon requesting assistance , admins or the highest rank available will decide which artwork to protect or restore first * in case there are multiple attacks at once * . 
  however , just for information purposes our general guidelines are :, 
  * seek diplomacy when possible over taking immediate action . 
  * defend small art over large art . 
  * defend senior members ' art over newcomers ' . 
  * restore minor damages over major damages . 
  * complete restoration/defense jobs before moving on to new requests . 
  ( which means we just prioritize the first job on the queue , not defense over restoration or vice-versa ), 
  * restore or defend art that provide a template with grid over those who do n't . 
  * restore or defend simple art over complicated art . 
  this framework allows us to be more efficient on request completion and enables to attend more requests in order to expand our community and keep our art clean . 
  our alliances :, 
  we are currently allied with the allied weeb forces and we have come to peaceful terms with the void , who have agreed to not devour our members ' art . 
  we also currently mantain peaceful terms with all major flag powers ; axis or otherwise . 
  factions are more than welcome to send their representatives to the diplomacy channel after contacting our admin team to let you in .
