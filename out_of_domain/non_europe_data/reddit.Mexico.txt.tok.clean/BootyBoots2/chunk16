  we were creamed . 
  my team came up almost intact , ( no life losses that time but two ships needed critical repairing ) nevertheless the tie pilots had massive losses , almost the entire fleet was lost that day either because of the explosion or because of the rebel support ships and fighters . 
  but we learned a valuable lesson : we are not invincible , and we must not underestimate our enemies despite the greatness of our empire . 
  this was back on the day when i was more reckless . 
  i had just been promoted to a tie hunter pilot , so we were on acmtm-02 on the planet mustafar . 
  ( advanced combat maneuvers training module 02 covers surviving in planets with extreme thermal conditions like hoth or mustafar itself ), 
  being born on tatooine and having been in touch with pod racing i decided we might have a little fun , so i challenged trianna baresh , a very ** very ** proud and hardcore woman to a race in the lava pit circuit near fraildeja . 
  she accepted the challenge and we got on our vessels . 
  what we did n't know was that there were [ lava fleas ] ( http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/lava_flea ) and the bastards jump from the lava attracted to metal alloys ( that 's the reason why they 're so useful to the locals ) so one of them grabbed a tip of her hunter while in speed mode ( closed ) and dragged it into the lava . 
  it actually sunk a few meters , i was behind so i blasted the dammed thing . 
  now , these vessels , like most ties do n't have shields , so the tie was heavily damaged . 
  i flew to her left and supported her with my wings so she was stabilized while she assisted me in blasting the fleas , then we miraculously returned to base . 
  needless to say we faced administrative charges and caused diplomatic tensions with the locals ( those fleas are important to them ) but our instructor saw our skills and foresaw our further training . 
  after the accident happened , i became interested on deep space zoology and read books about it . 
  if it was n't for that , we would n't have survived the [ neebray manta rays ] ( http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/neebray ) at the balmorra run . 
  yes , but it needs time , effort , guts and probably a way to lower our frontal cortex activity ( because it controls morals and complex thinking ) in order to `` let go '' . 
  also a ton of experience in order to get the `` social abilities '' which means exposing oneself to failure ... oh , painful failure . 
  it 's a wild ride being an intp ... 
  do you remember needing to drink at least 3 liters of the hydrate replenishing formula ? 
  good hot times ... 
  some of my teammates also got mustafarian lung fever because of the occasional gas leaking in the base 's chambers . 
  damn , we could have let the techno union run the place if we were to have bases there ... 
  some of us have to hit rock bottom to rise up . 
  and twice as hot as hell itself ... 
  edit : four years ?? 
  we were spoiling our hyperdrives to get outta there , and the module was only 2 months long . 
  man , our previous officers where rough ... 
  you are a rare specimen , sir/madam . 
  you acted as a voice of reason . 
  updated stormtrooper uniforms !, 
  hurray !, 
  entirely replacing the old law with the new law actually seems like destroying it . 
  it sounds like if angela merkel was n't elected to guide the german people in a different direction than hitler . 
  she 's just fulfilling the reich . 
  ( even when references to it are illegal in germany , the in the same fashion jesus predicated tolerance and forgiveness making the extremely harsh religious codes of the past void ), 
   what was evil in the mosaic law was still evil to jesus . 
  did n't the mosaic law come straight from heaven from the perfect god , and therefore the law being perfect and immutable itself ? 
  yeah , i read that article late at night and i think i fucked it up in illustrating how bp goes overboard . 
  sorry about that . 
  i 'll correct it asap, 
  i might hire you to synthesize my posts . 
  good call !, 
   a nomadic shepherding people rebelling in the desert may respond better to a law of `` thou shalts '' and punishments , while a culture long civilized under mosaic law will be ready for a more nuanced understanding of morality . 
  so not being ready for the perfect law yet justifies laws that create huge disparities like treating women as inferior human beings , capital punishments just for being yourself ( like homosexuality , or being a woman with a high sexual drive ) or promotion of slavery . 
   i tell my kid not to touch the stove , maybe later i can teach him about thermal conductivity and tissue destruction . 
  the difference here is that your child can perfectly see , hear , touch and perceive you . 
  your kid has full awareness of your existence in the first place . 
  we can not demonstrate the existence of god , and even if we could , we should n't , as we were supposedly created to live in accordance to his laws , so what 's the big deal in manifesting ** himself ** ( then again , * no more prophets * ) at once to humanity so we can have an homogeneous , comprehensible law that applies to every single human equally ? 
  ( or not , like solomon not being executed for his crimes just for being david 's son , it 's important to know the exemptions beforehand as opposed to `` in the making '' ), 
  do not be mistaken , my conflict is not against religion . 
  my conflict is against religious laws or religious-inspired laws . 
  i actually share your sentiment , i 'm too prone to write text walls , and that is counter-productive on reddit . 
  ( it 's exhausting to write them and it 's unattractive and exhausting to read them ), 
  most likely religious and non-religious people will never come to an agreement because the non religious tend to center on the people , whether it 's their personal growth , or the growth of countries and the people who live on them . 
  the other end are the religious , who act on accordance of the appeasing of a god of whom they have no proof but faith . 
  when it comes to the institution of law , both ends are incompatible when trying to reconcile the self-centerness of the un-religious with the ancient laws of the religious . 
  if god was real and merciful , he could have spared of of all this so we could engage on the proper worship , but apparently he does n't care . 
  otherwise we 'll have to wait until science demonstrates that there are no gods . 
  those concorde glasses ... 
  hopefully his burns were treated there , so that he cruzed back to the us safely . 
  some of them may be smarter than they think . 
  [ proceeds to enforce their rules due to beliefs on you ], 
  that 's bait for me . 
  as someone who read the complete old testament minus the psalms ( as the psalms are just worship chants and poems that do n't reflect religious history or basic teachings ) it 's hard to resist the temptation of pointing one of the multiple , ** multiple ** inconsistencies the bible has . 
  in certain instances , it actually is . 
  the reverse , ( `` it is more important to be intelligent than to be courageous and kind '' ) is not as evidently false , but it is false nonetheless . 
  oh [ saint george ] ( http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100305041710/uncyclopedia/images/6/6a/saint_bush_of_conservatism.jpg ) guide us with thine doctrine [ mis-alliteration intended ] , in thou we trust . 
  the problem is , this is somehow true ... 
  `` stop overthinking and just go for it ! '', 
  [ \u266b bernin ' , bern ... \u266b ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbfgh0mhw3w#t=0m43s ), 
  according to me , rationalism is a philosophy that seeks to reach the best models for a phenomenon through thought . 
  the opposite being empiricism , that attempts to model phenomenons through experience . 
  taking into account that overthinking is a problem typical to us , it seems plausible that you leaned towards empiricism . 
  both systems have its advantages and disadvantages . 
  i expressed the definitions i remember from high school philosophy lessons . 
  i will abstain to read the material you provided ( nevertheless i 'm thankful for it ) because i tend to loose myself no reading when something interests me . 
  ( and i can not allow that anymore lol ), 
  nice test !, 
  first : i think religion is supposed to be mainly a force for good ( yes , islam included ) . 
  what i ca n't stand is people trying to enforce their pointless , ancient , draconian religious laws on me . 
  second : really ? 
  what i meant by inconsistencies was stuff like solomon breaking every possible rule and god giving him a free pass just because he is the son of david ( even though the sentence for his crimes was death ) . 
  according to me most of the plot is based on `` who is the son of who '' which is explained in the books of kings and chronicles . 
  could you elaborate a little , please ? 
  besides , i did the test on the page suggested and i 'm ( in the secondary type ) as much of a 9 as i 'm a 4 . 
  does this mean that i have two wings ? 
  is my dominant one the 4 because it 's just next to the 5 ? 
  i see !, 
  it 's just that type 5 seems the most logical counterpart for mbti . 
  i can hardly picture an intp being an 8 on an enneagram . 
  i 'm new here . 
  ( but that 's maybe because i 've scored low on 8 on the 2 tests provided here ), 
  i 've dwelled a little bit into jungian cognitive functions to further understand mbti , but ... 
  i want to avoid too much of this thing , and mbti too . 
  but you 're writing/posting here !, 
  you may think . 
  true . 
  i tend to dig too deep into the stuff i like , the problem being that i study subjects that do n't improve my life at all but are too interesting . 
  too interesting ... 
  i 'm resisting the impulse to search and devour enneagram books .
