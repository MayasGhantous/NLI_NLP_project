  my favorite movie is `` the hunchback of notre-dame '' . 
  which one is yours ? 
  yes , i knew your wing necessarily has to be a number just next to your main , nevertheless , for example , if my quantified energy level is 7 units i 've got 6 units for type 4 and 6 units for type 9 . 
  other people have mentioned tritypes to me , but that sounds like you have the same amount of energy for 3 different types . 
  ( in this case 6 units for type 5 , type 9 and type 4 , which is not the case ), 
  i literally hear the chorus of hallelujah in my mind when this happens . 
  for what i 've heard about icelanders , i 'd better become and icelander myself . 
  iceland seems like quite an intp country . 
  `` brilliant analysis '', 
  happened to me once after writing a text wall on reddit . 
  it 's very satisfying . 
  one stupid , personal , lifelong macho challenge of mine is to be able to say that no movie has ever made me cry . 
  ( i 'd been on the ultimate brink of crying but i contained myself ), 
  watching `` up '' : [ challenge accepted ... ] ( http://edgecast.tech.buscafs.com/uploads/images/38264.jpg ), 
  reality kings * tries * to record what happens naturally in your family . 
  alice * is * wonderland . 
   if he was feeling something was off , as an intp he 'd likely let me know . 
  well , si is our tertiary function , and we do n't even have se on our stack !, 
  ( speaking about `` catching '' the stuff that happens in the world ) and fe is our inferior function , so so we 're usually bad at both expressing our feelings to others and capturing the feelings of others and interpreting those in order to fix problems . 
  ( i personally cheat on that and use my knowledge and analysis about people to compensate for it ) so do n't expect that !, 
  ( i thought about my girlfriend everyday when we were in a relationship but i did n't talk to her in a month because she was my first girlfriend and i do n't like speaking on the phone ... yeah ... ), 
  something i did n't like about my girlfriend was that she expected me to read her mind and do/say things in certain situations because somehow , that was `` cute '' . 
  but i had no clue of what she wanted !, 
  do n't be like that . 
  if something bothers you , tell him . 
  if you feel insecure , talk to him . 
  if you want/dream/need something , express it !, 
  we usually suck at reading and processing emotions , and what would be an accurate tell of disinterest on any other type , with us it could be nothing at all . 
  so do n't worry . 
  [ we 're all sensitive people ] ( http://a.scpr.org/i/fa16ff9433a85cd805e34b0208d8f595/107279-full.jpg ) !, 
  i do n't fear that because i 've been heartbroken ( badly ) due to friendzoning , so i know what it feels , already . 
  about the sexual part , i intellectually know it 's supposed to feel awesome but even when i had my girlfriend we never had good sex so ... 
  i went on a quest to get laid and started to collect information about the human arousal process , pick up techniques ( not lines ) and else but failed badly . 
  ( i did n't know i was an intp at the time ) so i gave up on that , i can rationalize it 's overhyped . 
  nevertheless i 'm open to a possible romantic/sexual partner in the near or distant future . 
  i just do n't seek her anymore . 
  i 've had only one girlfriend and we broke up really smooth . 
  * too smooth * actually . 
  and i was paranoid about relationships because of my parents ' failure as a couple . 
  that girl showed me a brand new world . 
  take a shot , the right girl will open up a door of scientifically proven brain chemistry that feels like magic . 
  my respects sir . 
  please make yourself at home . 
  like your title asserts , you 're already there . 
  sure !, 
  actually it happened twice . 
  one is [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/intp/comments/3r4p5v/is_entp_like_an_upgraded_intp/cwl3biu?context=3 ) and the other one is [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/intp/comments/3scgfn/what_is_it_exactly_that_makes_cheating_in/cww4byd?context=3 ) . 
  that dog knows [ where ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pevdstgleba#t=0m15s ) it 's loyalty is at . 
  that would be more iconic since the russian national animal is a bear . 
  i do n't get chills if i zoom in/out slowly but i get some vertigo if i scroll quickly !, 
  [ it gets worse ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-r_adhh_z_pe/ufuis16wd8i/aaaaaaaan2a/dbn7enuofus/s1600/gay-sailor-boys-nude-chested-hats-ripped-torso-sixpack-ribbed-body-saluting-navy-twink-hunks-marine-fleet.jpg ), 
  i literally imagined [ this guy ] ( http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s---5kajbz6--/1528985313952532878.jpg ) asking the question in your comment . 
  it is bro ... big time . 
  my parents wanted to go out to meet another couple when i was four . 
  i was stubborn and i did n't want to go with them . 
  they thought that if i heard the car engine ( pretending to go and leaving me there ) i 'd get startled and run to them for being afraid of getting left behind . 
  after a few minutes they realized their plan did n't work out , they returned to the house and found me watching cartoons with a big glass of choco-milk . 
  they say i asked them : why have n't you left ? 
  i thought you wanted to go . 
  20 years later , you ate his liver with a nice chianti hththththht !, 
  [ you can do things , ca n't you tom ? 
  things other children ca n't ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gps8xe8wiu#t=1m39s ), 
  actually yes !, 
  the name is kinda misleading . 
  well , i have never dealt with a bad breakup , but i definitely dealt with a collapse due to harsh friendzoning . 
  perhaps that 's an approach . 
  i concur with all other comments , it 's the time that heals . 
  when i was at the bottom of my sadness ( i would n't call it depression , i mean for me `` depression '' means clinically proved depression ) i remember playing gears of war and the massacre ( and avoid being butchered ) kept my focus so the sadness was gone while playing . 
  when i put the controller down , it would come back again . 
  usually the sadness would build up i 'd self-torture by listening to hopeless romantic 80 's music , [ especially this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rangeq3_dtm ) , ( this song was especially meaningful to me because i had n't had a girlfriend at the time ) and then i 'd cry my eyes off and feel much better . 
  then the sadness would keep building up again ( i was in high school at the time ) and then release . 
  after some time i noticed the sadness would take longer and longer to build before i cried for this girl . 
  6 months of being somehow unable to feel happiness . 
  it may take longer depending on you brain chemistry . 
  501st troopers are instructed to wield lightsabers ? 
  are some of them force sensitive and they receive training in the ways of the force or do they use lightasbers like any other tactical weapon ? 
  which vessels did you pilot , sir ? 
  interesting project . 
  had it succeeded we could have access to the best of the tactical approach of our troopers with long range weapons , and the best of the ways of the jedi scum together to protect our galaxy . 
  does n't matter , we still have enough firepower to do it our way . 
  [ this guy . 
  ] ( https://guillemhp.artstation.com/portfolio/501st-legion-vader-s-fist-vs-space-cockroaches-4 ), 
  you sound pretty logical ... 
  well , in my case i do make associations , lets say , `` stuff pops in my head '' . 
  it happens mostly when listening to music . 
  i listen to music and awesome stuff happens in my head . 
  ( dammit imma become an animator after i can speak russian , i promise ) i can replay those imaginative thoughts or add new stuff !, 
  that happens to me at other times , i get `` strokes of genius '' ( at the scarcity of a better phrase ) once in a while , but i presume they happen because of my secondary and tertiary functions . 
  i 'll give you en example of my intpness . 
  ( since i understood you get examples better ), 
  a friend of mine got mad for a stupid reason and now he 's too hurt in his pride to go to the awesome after semester period party that has already gained a reputation for being epic . 
  so i ** though ** ( ti ) about a solution because i 'm not good at social stuff and `` changing others ' feelings '' ( fe ) . 
  i was analyzing the information i could get of our facebook chat when ** i read something he texted me on my inbox ** ( si-ish ) and then the ** idea ** ( ne ) came into my mind : he said the [ drunk mario kart ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou1w94jig5w ) would be awesome and he was hyped about it , so why not going to his house and give him a little taste of it to soften his hurt pride ? 
  i do n't recall having all those thoughts at a time ... 
  it 's more like i structure a thought train and attack it with counter arguments or see every possible sides . 
  when i recall the start of the argument or other kind of thought i follow a thread instead of having very possible piece of information floating around . 
  ( when the argument is already structured in mind ), 
  when i 'm building the argument , i 'm kind of receiving , considering and integrating more information so my mind is a little more `` plastic '' . 
  i hope i helped more than i tangled things ... 
  more than discussing c3po 's personallity , i shared this video with you guys because it 's hilarious and because it revisits the `` mad scientist '' trope that fits the intp stereotype .
