  this chart was made to please us , right ? 
  coincidentally , it 's perfectly tailored to satisfy the intp 's views and biases ... 
  intps - yoda - of course . 
  we 're the wisest , oldest ( still puts up great fights ) greatest force user , most intelligent and most respected of the jedi . 
  istps - chewbacca - basically how some people in this subreddit see istps . 
  walking carpets who ca n't play chess like a civilized person . 
  intjs - palpatine - those manipulative , aloof , evil bastards incapable of good . 
  there 's a good reason why they 're our enemies . 
  estjs - vader - sounds alright . 
  mindlessly revered in the whole empire , this certified asshole choke her girlfriend ** while pregnant with twins ** , and then killed her with his rage on childbirth . 
  damn , he earned those burns . 
  esfj - jar jar binks - ` nuff said . 
  ( on a side note , they could have been oola or any other sexy female twi ` lek slaves ), 
  enfp - qui gonn - there 's a reason why we get along so well with those people . 
  they come up with good ideas ( that sometimes need to be a little bit more down to earth , yes ... ) and they have a good heart , yet they 're more active than us and are no pushovers . 
   please help me . 
  well , as a usual text wall writer i have to tell you it 's important that you break the text in pieces where the story follows-up . 
  that way is more pleasant to the eye , and easier for the brain to process the information you want to communicate . 
  also , below the lower right corner of the text box you can see the formatting help in blue ( right to the reddiquette ) . 
  follow [ this link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/comments/1vjfm9/how_do_i_insert_a_blank_line_between_2_lines_of/ ) for a tutorial on how to insert blank lines , just to make it look more appealing . 
  ok , now let 's get down to the * real * help . 
  ** actual advice : ** let 2 weeks to pass without texting . 
  after that say hello to her at school , walk straight to her looking to the front and to her eyes when speaking to her , initiate casual conversations . 
  no more texts until a month has passed . 
  no more text walls . 
  ever ( time lapses are suggested but plastic to your personal assessments of the situation ) . 
  you sound a little nervous . 
  do n't be . 
  you sound like a kind person , if things do n't work out with jane , do n't despair . 
  most likely she wo n't be the only woman to ever cross your path again in the future . 
  end of advice , perhaps a useful breakdown of the situation ( skip this if you 're feeling sensitive , i did n't quite factor your feelings in when i wrote this ) :, 
  i 'm going to tell you some general rules that are not rigorous or unbreakable but are useful :, 
  * girls love to be admired , arguably more than they like sex itself . 
  ( then again , not all of them , but some/most of them , depending on your perception ), 
  when they 're told the obvious ( you 're beautiful ! ), 
  they feel like elven queens , above everyone , watching their peasants from above . 
  has a queen ever married a peasant ( in ancient history ) ? 
  * you disclosed all of your feelings really quickly . 
  girls are extremely aware of boys wanting to have sex with them . 
  they notice when a guy wants to have sex with them like sharks smell blood on the water . 
  that sense is rigged in them and is natural . 
  the problem is that perhaps your romantic feelings were true , but their mind protects itself by interpreting the information like this : `` there 's no way someone can fall in love like this * that fast * , he must want to do me . 
  no way i 'm letting him '' . 
  mbti parenthesis : this defense mechanism is valid because it works with the vast majority of people , save for us . 
  our lack of extroverted feeling ( fe ) makes us wildcards , but evolution covers generalities , not singularities . 
  * even if they realized your feelings were true * they do n't want a sensitive poet for a couple * . 
  they want a fighter , a risk taker , a captain !, 
  ( preferably ripped , thank you . ), 
  they already have to deal with a lot with their own feelings , so carrying yours not only is uncomfortable , it 's unnecessary . 
  being as attractive as she is ( based on what you say ) she can choose whatever guy she wants . 
  and i 'm sorry i have to be the one to bring this to you , but our type is not what we could say attractive to the preconceptions and ( shallow ) values of western societies . 
  * you apologized too much . 
  never apologize unless the situation is really compelling . 
  ( like you broke somebody 's car or so ... ), 
  there 's a strange concept ... 
  the one of * neediness * , the one that says that the lesser valued people ( can you believe some people rate others based on looks and attributing subjective numerical values to them ? 
  e.g he/she is a 6,7,9 , etc. ), 
  are the ones that shows its desperation to feel human connection , therefore , in order to keep their `` social value '' , its imperative that they * never * start relationships with needy people , actually avoiding them is perfectly acceptable . 
  talk about producing sociopaths right there . 
  when you texted her with such long texts in the middle of the night , you gave that appearance away ( it does n't really matter if it 's true or not , many people tend to let themselves be drawn to what appearances tell them and not question them ) . 
  * you do n't know who else besides carson talked to her . 
  perhaps her friends ill-advised her . 
  people , but women for the most part tend to be extremely wary of their social environment , and they take good care of it . 
  if the social circle is too closed and toxic , she may live her life in accordance to her peers ' expectancies . 
  the breakdown by points i above corresponds to a very toxic system of beliefs whose name i will spare you from at this moment . 
  the catch is that that system of beliefs is a somehow accurate model for shallow societies obsessed with looks and wealth ( like the us ) . 
  however , you must recognize that such model is not entirely true . 
  i repeat : * it is not entirely true * for all women . 
  there are wonderful women who may not be like that at all and who appreciate your strengths and your personality as a whole ( so being introverted is not a liability , nor being sensitive , for example ) . 
  i do n't know if jane fits the model or not , the only way to find out is by communicating assertively . 
   where do you learn all this ? 
  ; is it an intp thing ? 
  no it 's not ... ughhh ... 
  the toxic system of beliefs i was talking about is [ the red pill ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/theredpill/ ) . 
  i have to warn you of it , it is pretty much like a cult , and we intps can fall prey to it because of our thirst for knowledge . 
  the red pill is not knowledge , is a system of beliefs sprinkled with some witty observations about the behavior of women . 
  nevertheless you have to acknowledge that many negative emotions are poured into it which makes it incorrect . 
  since they appear to like the [ pareto rule ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pareto_principle ) so much , take it from me : ( less than ) 20 % of their `` theory '' is valuable and ( more than ) 80 % is bullshit . 
  what i did was selecting what i consider the useful parts of it while discarding everything else , and integrating the healthy rp concepts into my life . 
  [ venture at your own risk ] ( http://venturebeat.com/2015/03/20/reddit-study-shitredditsays-is-sites-most-toxic-thread-theredpill-is-most-bigoted/ ) . 
  do n't . 
  for a year i read lots of books , designed lots of experiments , tested and developed hypothesis only to see myself crash and burn . 
  being `` good at women '' is an ability , and a especially difficult one to acquire for us because of our dear friend , the fe . 
  so it does n't matter how much you read , when you 're out there fear will grab hold and paralyze you . 
  besides , there 's so much knowledge that recalling every piece of information on the go is incredibly daunting if not simply impossible . 
  the people who are good at anything do not recall information , what happens is that they * internalized * it in their subconscious mind . 
  think about driving . 
  driving is a cluster of abilities working all at the same time . 
  you 're changing gears , pushing the pedals , watching the mirrors , trying to interpret the other drivers ' intentions , taking care of the speed , looking for pedestrians and generally staying alert . 
  you simply ca n't think about everything at once . 
  when you have achieved that ability without thinking about the individual processes that happens , you have gained [ unconscious competence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/four_stages_of_competence ) ( you can accurately say you 've gained a skill when you 've reached this point ) . 
  but remember we 're intps , and successfully integrating our inferior function takes time , decades apparently . 
  so either you integrate your fe at once and become the best version of yourself within your teens/20 's , ( a little bit unrealistic if you ask me ) we become good at pick up artistry ( difficult because our fe usually does n't let us develop the skills ) or ... 
  ** we use the only pieces of knowledge we need **, 
  * [ use the pareto principle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pareto_principle ) . 
  do you need a makeover ? 
  most likely not , but if you tried a different haircut that suits you , would you look dramatically different ( for the better ) ? 
  what if you bought some other clothes or a lotion that makes you smell really good ? 
  those small changes that make big differences ...
