  congratulations on your well-deserved promotion . 
  i heard darth maul became the 3rd most remembered character in star wars . 
  how much stage presence do you need to be remembered so well in such a franchise like sw and appear for * less than 10 minutes * ? 
  ( holograms included ), 
  you must be familiar with the book of job . 
  what 'd you expect from a god that literally sits there and toys with his most faithful servant for the sake of `` proving a point '' to satan ? 
  they must 've been having a blast together ... 
  lol maybe we would n't get along well . 
  i admit that `` plate used , plate washed '' habit is a really good one . 
  but i 'd rather pile them up and then wash them all at once . 
  i suggest you talk to that person in a non-combative attitude and explain him it 's your place , your rules . 
  i like your perspective . 
  now i 'd like you to have another one , for the sake of rant , perhaps . 
  i definitely support the fact you need to speak up for yourselves . 
  it 's the right thing to do if you do n't want to be harassed anymore . 
  nevertheless as a young male i was hungry for sex . 
  i went every once in a while to clubs with my buddies and whatnot obviously with the intention of flirting . 
  now add layers and layers and layers of pick up artistry that did n't quite work because women seem to have been evolved to detect sexual urge . 
  ( intuition ) i finally gave up on it but in the context of `` nice guys vs. jerks '' ( nice guy understood as the dude who is chivalrous and does n't quite want to have sex with you but a relationship ) it appears to be jerks win ( even in one night stands ) because they show sheer masculinity ( 50 shades of grey , perhaps ? ), 
  the more masculine , the better . 
  that means the more aggressive , the better . 
  ( not violent , aggressive ) so nice guys finish last . 
  heck , they do n't appear to finish at all and the world appears to congratulate guys for this uncooperative , dog-eat-dog attitude with having everything they wanted . 
  it appears to be that if you happen to be a man and you 're not pressing hard enough , you 're life 's gon na suck . 
  so maybe that 's why you got hit on , and believe me , you 'll still get hit on . 
  p.s : we men ** suck ** at reading body language . 
  communicate on spoken language in a direct manner , non-verbal cues are not our thing . 
  hate is contagious , and so is fear . 
  there is a continuous fear mongering across the media that spreads over the world . 
  we fear you guys because we worked hard as westerners to grant freedom in many ways ( and we 're still fighting for some ) so suddenly we 're shocked when we see the stuff that the media selectively portrays in a shockingly negative way about muslims . 
  but i also understand muslims and mostly syrians who just want to gtfo for dear life . 
  ( i 'm mexican , go figure ), 
  so i decided to stop thinking negatively about you , it takes time and effort . 
  i have n't even met an arab in person , or a muslim , or a person who speaks arabic in my entire life . 
  it 's just not logical to have such a detailed preconception of a group in which you have n't even met a single member . 
  and then again , those bastards want us at each other throats . 
  that 's why they ca n't be separated from their fucking cameras . 
  as long as we do not hate nor fear each other , and we become inclusive rather than alienating for being different , they can go suck our dicks , or vaginas for that matter . 
  i see . 
  well , my point is maybe she was n't so lazy , she just did stuff differently . 
  you know there 's a problem when you try to speak in a civilized manner and they get offended over simple , non intrusive things . 
  ** speak out ** it 's your right . 
  it 's my pleasure , admiral . 
  curious . 
  there was a time when my own sister was an utter mess . 
  she went to parties and left the house * for a whole month * and then returned . 
  she did that several times for 2 years or so . 
  i kinda despised her for that . 
  and all of a sudden poof !, 
  she meets this guy and returns home for good this time . 
  it 's like a reverse romantic comedy . 
  she definitely `` got her shit together '' and changed for the better . 
  idk , maybe she just needs time . 
  but i would n't bet on it . 
  ok ... that was deep . . and shallow at the same time , lol, 
  once a small mouse entered my house . 
  lol i did n't know what to do . 
  so i thought about if for a day or two and i got the resolution to adopt a kitten . 
  she did n't chase/eat the mouse but i got a nice , loving companion , plus cats are the best repellents for mice . 
  but i do n't know about rats . 
  i 've heard dogs are pretty good at killing rats . 
  hope you can deal with your palgue . 
  so does my sister . 
  i usually do n't get along with ground pilots , being a star pilot myself . 
  but the next time i bring hell onto the rebel scum in my tie interceptor , you can be sure that i 'll avenge your father . 
  a valuable asset to our cause and a pacifier . 
  may he rest in peace . 
  thanks for the insight !, 
  i appreciate you for taking the time to reply my thread . 
  hhhmm ... 
  it was a little bit beyond that . 
  i did n't see it as `` using '' , so much as `` living '' an experience . 
  much more like sharing an awesome experience with a stranger ( i do n't know , like sharing a balloon ride together ) than using people as a stepping stone , never did i think , `` damn , this chick 's hot , but does n't have value other than sex '' i just was n't in the search for a * bride to share a life with * either . 
  i 'm not blaming my failure on alpha males . 
  i thought they 're awesome and i wanted to live the experiences they were having , so i gave a shot a studying their techniques . 
  but one has it or not , and i do n't have it . 
  so girls should not be discomforted . 
  me going in full monk mode only means one less `` threat '' to them . 
  when i was `` on the chase '' i ran an experiment : no sexual intention . 
  round 1 : not attractive woman with kids . 
  great conversation . 
  r2 : not attractive , but young woman . 
  great conversation again . 
  r3 : hot young woman . 
  failed miserably . 
  even when i consciously did n't have sexual intentions , my body would react by paralyzing me and sending waves and waves of `` signals '' that girls would pick up immediately . 
  so now i want to eliminate desire forever . 
  but my body clings on desperately to the hopes for sex and relationships . 
  thank you sir . 
  i 'm on it . 
  antilles will bitterly regret the day he thought about joining the rebellion . 
  i looked for this comment before i submit the same joke . 
  some of this comments are redundant . 
  inception redundant . 
  `` i hate myself for hating myself '', 
  `` i fear being afraid '', 
  `` i 'm worried about being worried '', 
  `` i procrastinate by learning how to avoid procrastination '', 
  i 'll turn her hyperdrive on . 
  that is quite a refined way of spending taxpayer 's money for the sake of patriotic allegiance .
