  the other piece of knowledge we need is not so much of a concept but a number : 1.6 ( it 's actually irrational because its stems from pi but 2 significant figures will do , speaking about the body ) that number is present in many pieces of art , is a numerical quotient of proportion that was discovered by the ancient greeks ( does the phrase `` the looks of a greek god '' ring a bell to you ? ) . 
  why does the female measurements ( in inches ) [ 36-24-36 ] ( https://images.rapgenius.com/855f8d6923b23226e59265855575fba0.400x615x1.jpg ) are so appealing to us ? 
  ( notice how the dress is colored to further highlight this ) divide 36/24 , see how much it yields ... 
  the same is [ true for men ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rnrmtbbbe-q/tktwfbjogfi/aaaaaaaafb8/0lvpjxi2xhe/s1600/023.jpg ) the difference being the ratio is shoulders-to-waistline in men as opposed to bustline-to-waistline for women . 
  in summary : do n't chase them , let them chase you . 
  when you get to that point , you 'll just have to move the tip of your finger to get the dates you want ( [ aang explains it better ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuofgjpne44#t=11m58s ) ) . 
  it 's perfectly understandable to get frustrated if you pour all of your energy into knowledge to get results . 
  it 's the logical thing to do . 
  but logic , although useful , is not the end all - be all . 
  and sometimes science and logic do n't seem quite compatible at times because we lack `` hidden '' knowledge , that we do n't previously have or is difficult to get . 
  therefore , in this particular case , ** direct your energy to where is needed ; your body , not your brain . 
  one year of experience right there ... 
  i do believe there 's a god somewhere , and because i lack imagination i `` template '' him ( or her ? ), 
  in the judaeo-christian fashion . 
  it 's just that ** the ** god from the bible does n't make much sense to me , being the source of good and all ... 
  yes , actually be yourself but :, 
  * speak to her regularly : 5 minutes every day will do . 
  i can be much more if you want ... 
  * promote good communication : express your feelings , thoughts , ideas , etc. 
  clearly and encourage her to do so as well . 
  * yes means no and no means chocolate flying unicorns : your girl may ( or may not , depends on the girl ) sometimes say something expecting you do otherwise . 
  * surprise her once in while : do n't overdo it but do n't let routine consume you . 
  * plan activities together : you 'll have something a refreshing activity to perform with her . 
  those activities bind you together . 
  i ca n't think about anything else . 
  you do n't even have to do the ritual stuff like going to the cinema , ( although is a classic for a reason ) just spend time with her . 
  you 'll notice you 're going to want to so something different other than visiting her ; talk about it and make plans , share stuff . 
  when i was younger i had exactly your same fears , but after having a girlfriend it becomes clearer . 
   right ? 
  you republican fascist , white supremacist , patriarch , muslim hater , oppressive , scruffy looking nerf herder !, 
  [ we all know how fava beans and a nice chiani tastes ... ] ( https://images.rapgenius.com/91c6d2dd7a4b14b33b0be6a697a83ada.630x374x1.png ), 
  and a dangerous one , my friend . 
  because of the way psychology works it 's easy to fall prey to the `` us vs. them '' mindset . 
  this , combined with mass psychology can lead to [ regrettable events ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_anti-sikh_riots ) . 
  there are examples all throughout history : british vs. french , protestants vs. catholics , sunnis vs. shias , americans vs. soviets , you name it . 
  all of those may take lives ( and they * have * taken too much of them already ) . 
  lets focus a little bit on the us : the prejudice and discrimination against the african-american people has hampered their integration into a the larger culture . 
  ( true , there have been successful and wealthy african-american people but they do n't seem to reflect the bulk of the population ), 
  so they withdraw in an environment of their own , that sadly involves violence but not because they 're `` black '' but because of the toxic environment they live in that has been a result of centuries of consequences , but the `` whites '' perceive them as dangerous , so they distrust them instead of integrating them ( a real integration of them , not filling quotas like affirmative action ) . 
  tensions escalate and events like the ferguson shootings happen . 
  a sense of belonging is important to the human psyche . 
  enjoy the groups you 've joined and your identity , but always question their actions , always hold to your personal thinking as opposed to letting yourself be drawn into the hive mind . 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  thank you muse !, 
  you make me feel good !, 
  and no . 
  i 'm not a prodigy . 
  [ i 'm just another dude in this simple life ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm7ibrszcl4#t=0m55s ), 
  first , a small rant :, 
  i hate the hypocrisy of russia and the `` west '' . 
  they bomb down entire cities without taking the slightest care for civilians and call it `` collateral damage '' . 
  if an arab does the exact same thing in a microscopic level compared to the world powers with home-made devices they 're called `` terrorists '' ( never mind `` shock & awe '' tactics , totally ** not ** terrorism ) . 
  end of rant . 
  now , sadly it seems humankind works that way . 
  two sikh bodyguards killed indira gandhi , and what was the logical thing to do ? 
  dispense justice to the murderers perhaps ... 
  no , actually [ attempting to obliterate innocent sikh population who had nothing to do with it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_anti-sikh_riots ) sounds like a better idea . 
  change the ideals and the name of the group . 
  it 's not about countries , not about ideals , not about specific groups of people . 
  it 's about how tribal we all are . 
  sadly , it appears to be human nature and our behavior when we feel threatened in large groups . 
  about `` fixing '' the situation in a non-violent way : well ... 
  apparently that 's not going to happen with the da'esh because of their military endeavors . 
  there is not such thing as '' [ bombing the shit out of 'em ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r5a0pg4on8#t=0m8s ) '' because even though you can kill an ideology ( the hitlerian nazis are not around anymore , nor the khmer rouge nor the medieval holy inquisition if i 'm correct ) it 's really hard to do so , especially if it 's self preserving or religious ( how long did the catholic inquisition last ? 
  i do n't know but the span seems to cover several centuries ) . 
  i 'm usually against military dictatorships but ... 
  some people really look like they * need it * ( i ca n't believe i 'm writing this ) . 
  some brutal government systems fall when its founder dies ( like saddam or stalin ) but others keep on going even after its founder had died . 
  perhaps a review on the loss of political power of the catholic church may help us understand the process to accelerate the end of the muslim dark ages . 
  being down to earth ( using pragmatism here ) , and trying to use the teachings of history , ** this seems to have no peaceful ending ** , and the governments that have the greatest military power seem to be using this human crises to push their agendas , instead of minding the humane aspect of life . 
  * conspiracy projection, 
  i 'm interested to see what israel will do . 
  i get the notion they wo n't feel `` secure '' until the whole middle east ( or a very large chunk of it ) becomes israel , but of course , russia can not allow that , meanwhile the demographics are changing and the islamists know it , they simply need to wait until the structures crumble because there are not enough people to support it . 
  perhaps wwiii will explode after tensions build up some more . 
  will this turn out to be right ? 
  who knows . 
  [ most likely not ] ( http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/01/soviet-growth-american-textbooks.html ) . 
  back in 2001 it made perfect sense to invade irak . 
  now , not so much . 
  it 's hard if not impossible to predict the future because the lack knowledge and understanding of the key factors at play ( gee , who would have thought sectarian tensions were a big part of the iraki population and saddam kept those in check ? ), 
  using logic in some cases is as good as using hunches . 
  we 'll see how this turned out to be in 50 years . 
  nevertheless , there 's a reason why basic became the official standard language of our galaxy . 
  policies must be correctly enforced . 
  we 're all hit in our hearts because of this crises . 
  big text wall inbound . 
  every single country in the world has cultural problems . 
  attitudes , traditions and laws that are either nonsensical or downright harmful . 
  does n't matter how rich or advanced , there is no escape from it . 
  now , different countries can have more or less of those problems , and the problems one country can have can be much more grave than others . 
  ( [ japan ] ( http://wwf.panda.org/?21231/japanese-whaling-science-or-sushi ) apparently has a fixation on eating fancy sushi made out of endangered whales , while south africa and congo have serious problems with [ rape ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/12/48-women-raped-hour-congo ) ) . 
  that being said , i notice there are two approaches to the handling of this problem :, 
  * receive them and integrate them . 
  we have to ask ourselves : is our country mature enough to receive them ? 
  is integration possible in the first place ? 
  how do we deal with their cultural baggage ? 
  how do we promote their spread through the country so they adopt our identity ( thus not having entire communities of migrants where their former country 's identity can be preserved ) ? 
  * cold turkey : deny them and forget about their problems . 
  then again [ japan ] ( http://uk.businessinsider.com/japan-says-it-will-not-take-in-any-syrian-refugees-2015-9 ) is doing this . 
  think about it for a second : sure , not every muslim is a terrorist/islamist ( i call an `` islamist '' any person who promotes the establishment or preservation of the sharia law ) but it seems that most of the large muslim settlements have an islamist terror group of their own :,
