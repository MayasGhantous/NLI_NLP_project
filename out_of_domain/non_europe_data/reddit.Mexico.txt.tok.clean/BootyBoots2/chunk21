  the cold turkey approach 's vision is to simply denies passage to these groups by not letting muslims settle in their country , thus preventing the islamists to find a trojan horse and a niche of support for their radical ideals and cannon fodder to carry on with their plans . 
  but is not always feasible . 
  [ australia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_laws_in_australia ) has low gun violence and tough gun control laws . 
  could you import the australian success story regarding this issue to the us and expect americans to comply with it in the good spirit of social safety ? 
  [ most likely not ] ( http://rlv.zcache.com/shall_not_infringe_poster-r1aa9b04759d34defad55c389e9a20676_i1lba_8byvr_324.jpg ) . 
  the same holds true for the syrians . 
  the cold turkey approach wo n't make sense in some countries because they have large muslim populations already . 
  others do n't . 
  will the muslim people become majorities and push for the establishment of the sharia law in europe by the year 2050 or sooner ? 
  or will the countries successfully integrate them and show the ultimate social robustness of europe ? 
  we do n't know . 
  the history of human conflict , as far as i know , has been settled through conventional warfare , which it appears ineffective against deeply indoctrinated militants such as the da'esh . 
  then again , as far as i know , the west has never experienced this kind of conflict in its history . 
  we do n't know which will be the outcome . 
  everything seems blurry . 
  we have to find an equilibrium between being cold pragmatists and being hot-headed idealists . 
  we have to pay attention to what statistics tell us without forgetting we 're talking about people who breathe and feel . 
  may god , the universe or fate help them . 
  that trooper will be remembered like the valiant hero he/she is . 
  sure , the loss of life is equally tragic . 
  but strangely , some sacrifices tend to be unique in their kind and therefore are remembered more easily . 
  may all the heroes who fell on hoth find their well-earned peaceful rest , wherever they 're now . 
  read the paragraph after that and the title of the paragraph you read ... 
  well , you should always do what 's best for you . 
  perhaps your fe is more developed than mine and therefore you can use the dating techniques found on seduction books . 
  nevertheless the printing press was invented sometime around the xix century and the internet started to spread out among civillian since the mid 90 's . 
  courtship has been around for centuries in most of the world , so if you need to know that as a foundation for action startimg from zero rather than to `` fine tune '' your basic skillset , i heavily advice you to stop reading and start working . 
  bash my head against a wall ( figurative speech lol ) . 
  as time goes by , i 've learned much more about how to behave in public , social norms and expectancies and why to comply/disregard them . 
  turns out some of them do have a logical explanation , nevertheless the knowledge required to make the pieces come together and justify that social norm is not always available so , unless the `` hive mind '' is clearly loosing it and engaging in violent/dangerous practices , just go with the flow and question what you did when you have plentiful time to understand it . 
  i do n't improve my fe . 
  i cheat and compensate it with analysis and knowledge . 
  ( even if your analysis is academically worthy , in practice , analyzing is usually * poor * at most social situations . 
  so damn me ), 
  [ world of warcraft ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlw5mx7bzqi ) . 
  p.s : this could actually be the musical theme of how we feel when we end , for some reason , in a night club . 
  might as well remember the epic soundtracks as auto-defense while we 're there . 
  and no , i did n't commit the sin of referencing wow and forgetting about [ him ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlyoj_qd4a4#t=1m24s ) . 
  it seems the reason we overthink is because of the ti-ne combination working in overdrive ; we * think * ( ti ) about every * possible * ( ne ) outcome . 
  now , i identify two main motivators to analysis :, 
  * operational pondering . 
  * emotional pondering . 
  in the former , you are trying to break an event down in order to reach a solution to a `` real world '' problem ; this will somehow be an asset to your life . 
  in the latter , you are trying to break down an event as a mean of self defense in order to handle or avoid emotional pressure ( like analyzing in stressful situations or desperately trying to find the source of a problem that will cause you stress in the future ) . 
  notice emotional pondering is usually more of a liability than it is an asset . 
  you will have to assess the situations to realize if a particular emotional pondering is valuable or not . 
  i think metaphorically about overthinking as if overthinking is like fire : fire , in order to exist needs an oxidizer ( the environment where combustion is possible ) and a combustible ( the material that burns ) . 
  the combustible is your intuition , and the oxidizer is your thinking . 
  so , in order to stop the fire you need to cut one of the two resources out ; as overthinking ( like fire ) can not perpetuate itself if it runs out of one or more of these resources . 
  ** proposed solutions ** :, 
  this meditation requires you to focus on breathing or another `` anchor '' thus cutting out your supply of intuition , but not of thinking ( you will keep thinking about breathing , nevertheless it will widen your brain length activity ; in a certain way like in the process of sleeping ) . 
  * recognize if the your analyzing is an operational asset or an emotional defense . 
  if it is an emotional defense and you recognize it is more of a liability than an asset , just move on . 
  realizing that these kind of processes are working in you mind makes them stop , like in suggestion or hypnosis . 
  * if you can not break free of overthinking using the point above , use the fire analogy . 
  direct your thoughts about something else ( cut down ne ) or engage in an activity that does not require thinking ( cut down ti ) , it can be a thrilling activity that makes emotions override thoughts ( thus activating your reptilian brain ) , for example : watching a good movie of any genre , taking a roller coaster ride , practicing sports , etc. 
  usually i find cutting ti more effective but more difficult to achieve . 
  i hope this helped . 
  lol typical intp vs. feeler right there . 
  if i may intrude , perhaps a more fruitful exchange would be , after `` i like them '' instead of you saying :, 
   that 's fine . 
  go ahead and watch it , i can do something else . 
  you could have said : `` i do n't like that movie , but you do . 
  what if we do x thing together ? '', 
  x can be an activity that :, 
  * fulfills her need for feeling while being entertaining for yourself . 
  ( i 'd choose going out over staying at home while dealing with a feeler and if she likes indoors activities i 'd choose mario kart over chess , for example . ), 
  * fulfills your need for thinking while being fun for herself . 
  * bonds you together like the love birds you 're supposed to be ( romance ) . 
  by doing this , you 're acknowledging her need for feeling , validating it and helping her to fulfill her needs ; something that should make her appreciate you more as a boyfriend . 
  later on , convey to her that instead of holding fast to your personality ( independence is important amongst us intps ) , you stepped aside a bit in order to make the relationship grow , which is good for both of you . 
  so she should take you into account to find an enjoyable , relationship-growing solution instead of holding fast to her feeler needs . 
  just for curiosity : that was ** the ** actual breakup ? 
  ughhh ... women . 
  as a regular text wall writer i have to tell you it 's important that you break the text in pieces where the story follows-up . 
  that way is more pleasant to the eye , and easier for the brain to process the information you want to communicate . 
  also , below the lower right corner of the text box you can see the formatting help in blue ( right to the reddiquette ) . 
  follow [ this link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/comments/1vjfm9/how_do_i_insert_a_blank_line_between_2_lines_of/ ) for a tutorial on how to insert blank lines , just to make it look more appealing . 
  and here comes the part where i try to help you with analysis . 
  she likes you a lot and she is probably confused about her feelings for you , as they are very intense ; a clear giveaway for this is that she rationalized whether or not to stay with you based on mbti , even when [ isabel briggs recognized she would n't have married her husband , had she known his type before ] ( http://personalitycafe.com/intp-forum-thinkers/158195-unexpected-friendships.html ) . 
  so do n't give up on her yet , but be alert : she 's acting emotionally rather than rationally ( we intps use analysis as a method of defense ) . 
  every type is formed from a combination of [ cognitive jungian functions ] ( http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/213-mbti-descriptions-of-cognitive-functions-from-various-sources ) where the position of them plays a significant part . 
  in our case , our inferior function is fe , the extroverted feeling , which usually means it 's hard for us to express our feelings and it 's hard for us to notice and interpret feelings and emotional intentions . 
  this also means ** what is a clear sign of anger and disinterest may be nothing at all in intps ** . 
  this is important because communication is a hallmark of happy couples , so if she 's having a hard time expressing her feelings , being assertive and reaching towards her will show how much you care about her , and you will be appreciated further by her ( most likely she 's going through a thorough assessment of whether or not you 'd be a good boyfriend ) . 
  develop your abilities . 
  i personally like to study languages but you can channel your interest in other productive/beneficial areas of your life . 
  why do n't you try sports ? 
  suggestions :, 
  * learn a new language ( russian is quite a challenge ) . 
  * try sports . 
  * engage in some kind of art ( there are people who spend so much time trying to be the best at rock band that if they invested that time in learning to play an actual instrument they would have acquired the skill already ) . 
  * learn about economics and money management . 
  * read classic literature ( or any for the matter ) . 
  * start a project that has to do something with your career ( it does n't matter that you 're in first semester ) . 
  * learn a craft . 
  if you do anything over ten hours a day and it 's not your profession , you should really consider therapy .
