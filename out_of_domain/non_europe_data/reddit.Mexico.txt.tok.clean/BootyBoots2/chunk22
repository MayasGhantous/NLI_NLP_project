  life really did bail you out on this one , trust me ; it does n't happen to many people . 
  i do n't know why people downvoted you , your point is perfectly valid . 
  for centuries people have been butchering each other because of religion as a mean to impose their culture and system of governance over each other . 
  on the other hand , religion has actually helped many people ( apparently , some [ seventh-day adventists live over 100 years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_zone ) ) , giving them direction and purpose . 
  [ muslims are compelled to share with the poor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/five_pillars_of_islam#zak.c4.81t:_charity ) and [ christians created the ymca ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ymca ) . 
  that being said , in a numerical cost/benefit analysis banning religion altogether does n't sound like a bad idea ( assuming people would n't go ape shit about it , which they would ) . 
  edit : you know what ? 
  i 'm gon na support u/nobear441 's [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa85lvmqg0m ) . 
  my only problem with religion is that religious people want to enforce their religious laws on us , and i hate it . 
  nice video !, 
  lol !, 
  the only ways this comment could be better is if your username was `` brodofappings '' . 
  the fact that your post wo n't even reach one upvote ( i did contribute with mine ) should tell you what people around this sub think . 
  last time obama emphasized how exhausting this * routine * has become . 
  i wonder what he will say now . 
  i 'll paraphrase a comment i read once : `` the discussion was settled after sandy hook . 
  if the massacre of innocent children wo n't make people react , then nothing will '' . 
  as a mexican , i 'm surprised you even care about these things instead of just accepting them as `` normal '' ( yes , i know violence is not normal , awful and it 's must be always prosecuted ; but everyone has a breaking point where one naturally just become jaded and indifferent to things like this after prolonged exposure ) . 
  i 'm learning russian through the internet . 
  it 's not impossible and i think there are much more difficult languages out there . 
  neverthless the challenge of `` unlearning '' that this symbol [ \u043d ] is not an h , this symbol [ \u0440 ] is an `` r '' instead of a `` p '' , and such is fun in its own way . 
  do n't even get me started on the cases . 
  [ certain videogame ... ] ( http://cod.demotivationalposters.net/image/demotivational-poster/1003/call-of-duty-cod-demotivational-poster-1268168885.jpg ), 
  i hope you get back to it !, 
  russian people are amazing . 
  even though my native language is spanish i tend to search most of my internet content in english because the information available is broader in range and usually more accurate ( sadly ) ; but maybe i 'll find lots of interesting content in russian !, 
  plus , even though i like the angloshpere a lot , i think being able to access the content from russia and other russian speaking countries can give me a fresh perspective of the world !, 
  sorry , got drawn by emotion . 
  cod4 was my * inspiration * . 
  i 'm learning through books pirated via [ kat ] ( https://kat.cr/ ) , [ this site ] ( http://masterrussian.com/vocabulary/common_nouns.htm ) , this [ other site ] ( http://www.russianlessons.net/articles/index.php ) and [ antonia romaker 's videos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9be_-nmefe&amp;list=plcl8prsnnvvfjwbyxoi4mqqecekyy2my7 ) . 
  russian language also has genders ; but they have masculine , feminine and neutral ; unlike spanish ( this means no tranny ; not sorry ) . 
  see how many fucks he gives . 
  edit : my cis ( not white ) male privilege made me forget that the naked backs of sexy ukranian females are nsfw . 
  sorry about that . 
  damn ... that 's a catchy tune .

   never knew it was so fucked south of the border and i hope something becomes of today 's shooting . 
  that uncomfortable moment when someone realizes the us is the mexico of canada ... 
  good call brah . . good call !, 
  but , you see . . the `` p '' is actually an `` r '' , the `` h '' is the `` n '' and the backwards `` n '' is an `` i '' . 
  also the `` b '' is `` v '' and `` y '' is `` u '' . 
  but at least `` a '' keeps being `` a '' and `` t '' keeps being `` t '' . 
  damn russians . 
  they 've got everything so backwards , even their backwards letters are wrong . 
  i saw this picture and [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz6u7nlgwps ) played in my head, 
  bad . 
  i was on the pua scene for a little while . 
  i wanted to `` live it off '' as a compensation of lost years because of fear of doing stupid things because of being a teenager . 
  i tried to compensate my lack of social skills with getting as much information as possible from human nature ( ne ) , applying it to create hypothesis for functional experiments ( ti ) and remembering my fuck-ups ( si ) in order to not make them again . 
  failed badly ; there are some instances of life that depend heavily on fe and can hardly be replaced with anything else , no matter how well structured your plan is , how much you know or how experienced you are . 
  feelers feel feelings ( take your time to process this , it 's not an oxymoron lol ) , and therefore they bypass our thinking , rendering it useless ; for the better and for worse . 
  nevertheless , in time , i 've been able to process others ' emotions more than before . 
  probably because of a deeply settled si . 
  i 'm not extremely socially awkward but i do n't shine in society as much as i 'd want to . 
  source ? 
  ( for the gun-lovers ), 
  thank you !, 
  i 'll give it a try !, 
  but perhaps trannys think that 's oppressive to them , so they 're gon na change it so that there are words that have * two * genders at the same time . 
  hmmmm ... 
  i wanted to go a little beyond further wikipedia and :, 
  * i could n't find statistic reports for homicide in 2015 for any of the two countries ( perhaps data is not available yet , as they have to comply with an activity calendar to release the data ) ; so i found data for 2014 instead . 
  * i tried to use official sources only ( government webpages ) . 
  and the u.s had only [ 4.5 murders per 100,000 people ] ( https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/murder ) . 
  my dearly beloved mexico on the other hand , had [ 16 per 100,000 ] ( http://www.inegi.org.mx/saladeprensa/boletines/2015/especiales/especiales2015_07_4.pdf ) . 
  if you 're not a spanish speaker translate the 1 ^ st paragraph for the link about mexico . 
  i will do what i must . 
  or decrease ; this is a very interesting point . 
  i 'll check what are the birthrates of places like jordan or uae . 
  mexican here :, 
  it 's * \u00a1 viva m\u00e9xico !, 
  if you want to sound even more mexican and politically incorrect , then :, 
  sigh ... only border mexicans speak ese-cholesque all git out !, 
  not meanin ' that you care , y' all . 
  we 're not havin ' a hissy fit for that . 
  where in mexico did this happen ? 
  most likely in canc\u00fan , monterrey or culiac\u00e1n where the stereotype ( among us mexicans ) claims the mexican hot chicks are . 
  the real mexican flash mobs look like [ this ] ( http://controversia-oax.com.mx/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cnte_marchas_notimex-624x337.gif ) . 
  lol we 're having a little language entanglement right now . 
  the crime of murder ( homicidio in spanish ) is defined on the mexican federal penal code ; chapter ii , article 302 as : `` comete el delito de homicidio : el que priva de la vida a otro '' ( commits the crime of murder : [ the person ] who deprives of life to another ) . 
   ucr program does not include the following situations in this offense classification : deaths caused by negligence , suicide , or accident ; justifiable homicides ; and attempts to murder or assaults to murder , which are classified as aggravated assaults, 
  the rest of the code pertaining murder defines that and more nuances , it 's just not so compact but conveys the same thing . 
  perhaps now is a good time to say i 'm not a lawyer ... 
  anyway , the government source is [ here ] ( http://www.diputados.gob.mx/leyesbiblio/pdf/9_120315.pdf ) ( scroll for the article 302 if you want ) and a more direct link to that same article is [ here ] ( http://info4.juridicas.unam.mx/ijure/fed/8/374.htm?s= ) . 
  up and rolling ... 
  financial sector . 
  i had just finished flight school and was assigned to my 3rd mission , so i was sent to cato nemoidia and surrounding systems . 
  i was enraged because i wanted to be on the `` death star '' -- it sounded so cool ! -- but i was n't assigned to it . 
  some of my friends were assigned to it and they had the jolliest look on their cheeky faces . 
  they never came back . 
  it 's so sad when that happens . 
  the empire should n't be the replacement for anybody 's family , be human or not . 
  this is what we try to prevent in the first place . 
  what we are willing to give our lives for . 
  the worse part is that our empire * does * become a second ( or replacement in some cases for ) family . 
  but they 're likely to die , and a part of you dies with them . 
  i read lots of stories from the ground troops . 
  but mine is one of the stars above . 
  god dammit ... 
  a few months ago i was assigned by u/rotallyrotroobyroo to pursue and kill the rebel wedge antilles .
