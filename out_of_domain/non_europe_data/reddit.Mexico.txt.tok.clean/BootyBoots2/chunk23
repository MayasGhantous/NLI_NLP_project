  we departed from vsd indomitable and tracked him and his team to garos iv , near yavin , according to intelligence reports . 
  we knew what we were up against . 
  elite rebel pilots : the rogue squadron . 
  god dammit , i should have declined until i was able to request a defender unit . 
  we were a tie interceptor squad of 6 versus an elite detail of 10 rebel ships escorting an hvi . 
  we came in hard from the hyperspace and all hell broke loose . 
  we already knew the hvi was not of importance , so we let them go , pretending to try to shoot it to distract attention from the real target : antilles . 
  all of them were hard but outmaneuvered by trianna , zarek and i , but they were much more experienced than the other three lads . 
  so we shot them while trying to protect our own , those guys were very good , but they needed more polish before they were able to face elite rebel starpilots . 
  one of the three youngsters who died flew right in front on me to prevent myself from getting shot from an ambush of two vessels who followed me while trianna and zarek had their hands full . 
  his sacrifice let me perform a barrel roll , aileron roll and sudden break to get in position and nail the two bastards at once . 
  that gave me the idea to ambush them in the same way , so i coordinated trianna and zarek for the last assault [ there was an especially skilled pilot amongst their ranks ] , as trianna distracted the very skilled pilot with zarek on her back and forced him to pursue her while i ambushed antilles . 
  the next scene happened in less than 3 seconds . 
  zarek had the pilot pinned down , above us and trianna was coming down as i was coming up facing her . 
  we avoided each other by spinning on our axes ( this is an advanced coordinated tie interceptor maneuver ) to let her get away and let antilles take the decision of running away from me ( i was n't in position to shoot him ) or save the other pilot from zarek 's blasters . 
  he accelerated to save the pilot , who accelerated into hyperspace without a doubt . 
  but antilles was fast and resourceful and he was massively damaged but not destroyed . 
  so i uttered the command i 've regretted the most in my whole career : i oredered zarek to ** not ** shoot him . 
  we hounded him all the way to garos vi to capture him alive and bring him back to the indomitable for further interrogation . 
  we were received as a heroes , the whole fleet cheered upon us . 
  some said the emperor wanted us as his private escort for space . 
  mission accomplished , with honors ... 
  a week after , we found out he escaped . 
  bothan spies and a rebel suicide detail sneaked into the indomitable and rescued antilles . 
  the team leader was no other than luke skywalker . 
  remember the skilled pilot ? 
  it was him . 
  ** it was fucking him !!!, 
  ** god dammit !!, 
  the imbecile who blew the first ore extractor and the one who blew the second . 
  the two of them ... at the reach of my hand ... and i did n't do it . 
  i did n't push the fucking button , or let zarek push his . 
  so much responsibility . 
  so much lives . 
  the stability of the galaxy , the greatness of the empire . 
  all lost because of me . 
  i 'm sitting here with along a standard trooper rifle . 
  the fact that i have n't pulled the trigger to end my unworthy existence makes me even more miserable . 
  but i have n't done it because of her , trianna . 
  she has been by my side the whole time . 
  sorry for venting myself here . 
  and what happens when said theoretically ill society has an extraordinarily easy access to tools designed with the sole purpose of killing in the most efficient and widespread rate possible ? 
  do n't listen to your harsh words yourself !, 
  instead of giving advice to your son , i 'd rather give an advice to you : when you enforce your rules on him , always explain the reason why you 're doing it ; of course , your rules must be consistent and reasonable in the first place . 
  if you do that , you 'll have a happy , obedient son . 
  my response was directed to u/aolironmaiden . 
  your comment has nothing to do with mine . 
  thanks for the reminder on what * data * is ( you can have a reminder on capitalization rules [ here ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/es/palabras/general-advice-on-writing-capitalization ) . 
  if you need to emphasize a word or a phrase , check the formatting help on the lower right corner of the text box ; it is died in blue ) . 
  expanding on your comment , i checked official data sources and the homicide rate is indeed decreasing ( [ according to the fbi ] ( https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/table-1 ) ) . 
  since i 'm writing comments on reddit , i really do n't perform in-depth professional analyses but i like to stick to sources that i consider reliable ( namely local government or un sources ) . 
  nevertheless , if you check government sources like i do , you will find little information about it ; the us presents information updated to 2014 ( so it 's impossible to verify the `` there have been more mass shootings than days in 2015 '' claim ) . 
  i tried to find data about australian murder rates for 2014 -- as [ australia has been exemplified as gun control done right ] ( http://www.betootaadvocate.com/uncategorized/australia-enjoys-another-peaceful-day-under-oppressive-gun-control-regime/ ) by [ this subreddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gunsarecool/ ) -- but i could n't . 
  same for japan . 
  also , while fact-checking i noticed that [ this un chart ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2012/12/14/chart-the-u-s-has-far-more-gun-related-killings-than-any-other-developed-country/ ) does n't match the fbi information so , which organism is to be trusted ? 
  if you are familiar with college level statistics or you have a higher formation than that on the subject , you 'll notice that linear correlation would be a useful tool to analyze this sensitive topic . 
  it would confirm or debunk once and for all the common perception that the greater the gun possession among the populace , the higher the homicide rate ( which sounds like common sense but since the us is so hell-bent on preserving its ancient laws , science needs to be strictly observed ) . 
  however , the treatment and interpretation of this data pertains * inferential statistics * ( the branch of statistics that lets you validate hypothesis about observations ) , which is different from * descriptive statistics * ( the kind you 're typically exposed when you see graphs and tables in reports ) . 
  in summary , two problems usually arise when looking for ** data ** : first , a consensus must be reached about reliable sources of public concern to standardize the pool of raw data . 
  and second , not everybody is able to correctly perform the analyses required to take decisions based on inferential statistics . 
  ** edit ** : gee , i got lost in all this science talking and i did n't answer your question . 
  well , perhaps the problem is that american people are so paranoid , they value guns more than they do value people ; otherwise they are easily scared about killings that are pretty much normal under a `` free '' society that needs not trust its security to the government , like other developed countries do . 
   apologies in advance to all the intps out there for the feels . . 
  girl , we do have feelings -- strong ones -- deep inside us . 
  do n't worry , you 're welcome here !, 
  for personal experience i have to tell you that most likely you will never * persuade * him of having a baby . 
  in a cost-benefit analysis having a baby is a tremendous handicap and offers no `` operational '' value , just emotional ( so no appealing whatsoever ! ) . 
  but do n't despair , it 's not the end of the world . 
  personally i can somehow relate to the openness of having a child because of the time when i adopted my cat . 
  i did n't want pets , but once a mouse came into my house and i went nuts ( state of emergency right there lol ) and after pondering to adopt it i said to myself : `` oh , what the hell ! '', 
  and i went to the pet store and adopted her . 
  i do n't regret it ; i love her . 
  i buy her food and sand and take her to the vet for vaccines and when i come home she 's always waiting for me . 
  i kind of thank that mouse because if it was n't for it , i would n't have taken the decision to adopt my cat . 
  so , what 's my advice to you ? 
  try to be in an environment where he is able to appreciate kids !, 
  an environment where he can * feel * the children , perhaps he changes his mind after that . 
  good luck !, 
  damn !, 
  there are types that have harder times with fe than us !, 
   coincidental statistics are n't necessarily facts to make decisions by . 
  as you say , data must be interpreted . 
  yes !, 
  there is a term for coincidental statistics as you define them already ( it 's called * descriptive * statistics ) . 
  the ones that let you validate hypothesis are the * inferential * statistics . 
   i kind of get the feeling that you 're attributing these mass shootings [ almost ] completely to gun laws . 
  do you really think that the psychological attitude of a society has no basis in the matter ? 
  yes , i do recognize the cultural attitude plays a hard part on it ; nevertheless , i do think laws can change for the better and actually * influence * the culture of a nation ( think about it , do n't you think the us would be much more racist than it currently is if slavery had n't been abolished ? ) . 
  that being said , the us has a long way to on this . 
  it 's hard to escape from every vicious circle ( they are circles after all ) , and the us is stuck in a big one here : a shooting occurs , then people get paranoid , then they get more guns and by doing so they enrich the nra -- that will keep lobbying harder to safeguard its interests -- so it holds a tighter control of congress and makes it harder to pass gun laws , giving the people an illusion of safety and facilitating access to guns , then a shooting happens and the whole process is repeated . 
  i perceive that , because of its history , americans equate having guns to being safe ( when it appears it 's the other way around ) . 
  to be honest , replying to u/goblinbob made me re-evaluate the situation . 
  what is the goal when it comes to passing gun control laws ? 
  murder is on decline despite the over-abundance of guns , as it 's shown on the fbi site i linked . 
  perhaps what we want to avoid is more shootings like this one , and that 's a challenge of a different kind : the odds of getting killed -- overall -- are decreasing but the odds of getting killed by a terrorist/nutjob on a spree are on the rise , so limiting access to guns in order to prevent the wrong people from acquiring them sounds like a good idea , but the problem is that then you would be interfering with the second amendment : the great american safety blanket . 
  sorry for the long posts . 
  i 'm addicted to text walling . 
  i * love * that show !, 
  dude ... she though lando had a sword ? 
  lol nice detail !,
