  you 're very good at graphic design !, 
  in the context of this conversation , yes it is . 
  sure , the responsibilities and feelings invested are worlds apart , my point was that if he saw children from a purely rational/logical point of view , he 'd never agree to have a child . 
  but if he experienced it first hand , he 'd probably consider his feelings ; as feelings are usually bypassed by logic , which is bad because feelings are very important . 
  yes it has . 
  but the greatest danger lies in the making of stupid laws , not of religious violence in large scheme . 
   what you do n't see or hear about is how many shootings/explosions are stopped by legal gun carrying citizens , or how many home invasions , robberies , burglaries , are stopped by the same . 
  you can , if you [ look for it ] ( https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/expanded-homicide-data/expanded_homicide_data_table_15_justifiable_homicide_by_weapon_private_citizen_2010-2014.xls ) . 
  taking into account that [ 14,249 people were killed in 2014 ] ( https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/table-1 ) ( [ 8,124 by firearm ] ( https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/table-1 ) ) , and only 229 were able to successfully kill its assailant , that leaves us with approximately 1 successful life preserved in self-defense thanks to firearms per 35.4 who killed other people thanks to firearms . 
  gun lobbyists ( and americans in general ) must be tired of yet another dose of uk-australia-nz-canada success shoving . 
  hmmmm ... well , he should n't take 10 years to meditate it , that 's for sure . 
  and i did n't suggest they had a baby recklessly just perhaps op could take him to a kindergarten or something , where he could be more in contact with children so he could factor his feelings into his analysis . 
  if she breaks up with him or not , that 's up to her . 
  thanks for the resource , but i 'd rather stick with the fbi on this . 
  in the same way , i 'm not citing [ r/gunsarecool ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gunsarecool/ ) and its tracker like some media outlets do . 
  sure , but over 30 people killed with a gun per 1 person successfully killing his assailant does n't sound like a good ( or feasible ) bargain to me at all ... 
  true , we men can impregnate a woman even at old age ; nevertheless , we should n't do it . 
  the quality of our sperm decreases with time , meaning the baby is at a higher risk of developing a congenital disease ( same for pregnant women over 40 ) . 
  fair point . 
  the way to find out would be to conduct rigorous hypothesis tests . 
  but by doing so we 'd be abandoning the realm of descriptive statistics and entering into the realm of inferential statistics , to do so we should be expert mathematicians and be in contact with first hand raw pool of data ( i 'd go for the police statistics ) . 
  retuning to the ( not very useful in this particular case ) use of common sense , justifying gun use according to the data i provided -- courtesy of the fbi -- would require saving 34 or more people in a single sitting ( avoiding an actual equivalent of the virginia tech massacre ) . 
  and i 'm get the feeling those people did n't save more than 5 people , at most . 
  we 'd have to ask the cops and the survivors to find out ... 
  to answer your question , i presume yes : they account for all crimes , or that 's what my current level of english lets me understand , as the footnote under the table says `` the killing of a felon , during the commission of a felony , by a private citizen '' . 
  ok , here we go . . 
  there are two simple ways a population can enjoy a low occurrence of gun deaths/violence . 
  * having heavy restrictions to guns . 
  this includes but is not limited to the governments having strict control over gun manufacturers/retailers and imposing obstacles , formats and restrictions to the populace for the acquisition of guns . 
  * having an educated and responsible population that handles guns properly , safely and professionally . 
  the first point is the `` cold turkey '' approach ; no guns , no gun problems ( japan comes to my mind ) . 
  this approach is impossible in the us because of the over-abundance of guns . 
  the second is what people wishes the us was but it is n't . 
  although apparently there are segments population with large gun ownerships that have low gun violence . 
  and the homicide rate is indeed decreasing ( [ according to the fbi ] ( https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/table-1 ) ) as years go by . 
  what is the goal when it comes to passing gun control laws ? 
  murder is on decline despite the over-abundance of guns , as it 's shown on the fbi site i linked . 
  perhaps what we want to avoid is more shootings like this one , and that 's a challenge of a different kind : the odds of getting killed -- overall -- are decreasing but the odds of getting killed by a terrorist/nutjob on a spree are on the rise , so limiting access to guns in order to prevent the wrong people from acquiring them sounds like a good idea , but the problem is that then you would be interfering with the second amendment : the great american safety blanket . 
  ** edit 1 : ** why do americans distrust their security forces so much ? 
  i keep reading -- not on this sub but still -- about people who pretty much disregards the police force as police is `` minutes away '' from crime scenes . 
  why not trying to do things the functional way and calling for a strengthening of the police force ? 
  and i do n't get the militia argument ( that appears to be the foundation of the 2 ^ nd ammendment ) either . 
  if there was a hypothetical us dictator , you guys would be ** fucked ^ 5 ** . 
  dictators do n't give a damn about people and they do n't care about genocide if it helps them keep control , how can you even hope to fight a large army with resources that exceed the next 7 countries combined , the most modern weaponry and some of the best trained personnel in the word with load of guns , enthusiasm and armed yet untrained * civilians * ? 
  ** edit 2 : ** when the country that has the greatest amount of nobel prizes [ bans the research on a correlation between guns violence and gun ownership ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/congressional-ban-on-gun-violence-research-rewnewed-2015-7 ) , you know there 's a hard cultural problem ( or some serious profiteering going on ) . 
   there is real no definite answer to this problem . 
  there is no black and white solution to this problem . 
  for what i 've seen in american media outlets ( and judging by the large amount of opinions and comments i 've read ) , i think they look at most of the `` hot issues '' in terms of extremes . 
  you 're either a ( proud ) climate change denier or a hardline treehugger that wants to see coal factories closed . 
  such polarization . 
  much country . 
  [ i shall now cast my veredict . 
  [ yes i can !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prediction#statistics ) ( or at least mathematicians can . ), 
  and yes , i would seek to repeal such legislation if it turned out to be counter productive -- and i was an american living in the us in the first place -- provided there is substantial , scientific and overwhelming evidence that the correlation between gun ownership and gun violence is inversely proportional , as opposed to directly proportional . 
  but as you said it in another comment , we wo n't know for certain if the the nra is afraid of science . 
  good god !, 
  where do you live ? 
  as a thinker , it 's very different to have a feeler so than having close family member feelers . 
  so perhaps you 've already widened his perspectives !, 
  as a side note , i love when people like you come to this sub , it 's just refreshing . 
  we intps were engaged on a discussion and a flared istj came and proposed a very well structured solution . 
  you could feel his personality just by reading his comment . 
  the same holds true for you !, 
  i asked this very same question back on r/intp . 
  i hardly ever downvote . 
  actually i run a quick analysis each time i intend to downvote :, 
  * does the content contain an ad-hominem attack ? 
  * does the content contain overt bigotry ? 
  * does the content shows disgress in a complete non-constructive manner ? 
  well , if any of the 3 happens , [ then ] ( http://d2ws0xxnnorfdo.cloudfront.net/character/meme/down-voting-roman ) ...

  love is a worthwhile feeling . 
  it hurts , but finding the correct person can enhance your life for good . 
  your so can compliment you , help you see your problems and make you grow ; just like you can make your so grow as well , in the same way . 
  i presume you are hurt . 
  if i 'm correct , then time is the only cure . 
  it may take from 6 months to year and a half depending on your emotional capabilities to recover . 
  meanwhile , i suggest you accelerate the process by identifying the times when you filter the positive thoughts out , as [ this is a cognitive distortion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cognitive_distortion#filtering ) . 
  if you just felt dramatic for a moment -- like we all do at certain times of our lives -- feel free to disregard the preceding paragraph and keep being happy . 
  i am a text wall writer , but my posts are not nearly as lengthy as this one . 
  great post . 
  great formatting too . 
  i have read a couple of posts that say `` the us stigmatizes mental health '' . 
  your people is the wealthiest and one of the best educated in the whole world ; how come americans stigmatize mental illness ? 
  it could happen to anyone . 
  it 's even easier for me to understand -- yet certainly not endorse -- stigmatization of sexually transmitted diseases : because of prudishness , religion and the like . 
  in your opinion as an american , why do you think that happens ? 
  thank you for replying !, 
  for the section about the police corruption/geography , i 'll say that 's the biggest issue to fix . 
  some folks say that the better armed , the lesser amount of crime , because of civilians able to replace the police . 
  that happens to be not true ; anarchy and a failed states happen when there are not strong enough political , social and economical structures , and when political power does n't rest on the people ( cronyism , dictatorships ) . 
  this is not the case for the us , in my opinion . 
  the us has a large involvement of its people in government affairs and there are mechanisms to scrutinize the performance of public servants , also it is sought after to promote equality ; something that is difficult -- or sometimes downright impossible -- in 3 ^ rd world countries . 
  the state should hold the monopoly of violence , but at the same time , there should be structures for the people to remove an underperforming/corrupt/criminal politician from office . 
  you know what ? 
  i want to discuss this , but it 's late at night here and i 'm physically tired . 
  disregard the content of this comment so far , i 'll finish it tomorrow morning and give you a call when i do . 
  on a quick overview -- taking into account the comments i 've read -- intps tend to fall in 4s , 5s , 6s and 9s . 
  could someone cite an example of an intp 3 or 8 ?
