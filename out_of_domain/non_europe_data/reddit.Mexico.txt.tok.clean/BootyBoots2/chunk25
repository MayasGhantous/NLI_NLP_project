  errrmmm ... 
  thanks ? 
  not sure if sarcasm . 
  i suck at processing sarcasm . 
  if its sarcasm , then i think my point has been quite misunderstood . 
  my idea was to try to somehow bring the people who do n't want kids in a kid-friendly environment where he/she can appreciate the good side of children , aka human contact . 
  if its not sarcasm or you 're having plain fun , then lol !, 
  i can be such a killjoy sometimes . 
  i was actually surprised when the cop who did the killing at ferguson was n't sentenced by the grand jury . 
  that kind of thing happens in mexico , not the us . 
  a functional democracy ca n't have special treatment for anybody ( and if is such corruption exists it 's the duty of the people to create/support/maintain structures that prevent arbitrary favoritism ) ; this is especially true when it comes to the institution of police , since it 's the organism that takes care of public safety . 
  when i called for police strengthening i was thinking about an optimization of the police resources . 
  to illustrate point :, 
  check [ this map ] ( http://data.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/gun-deaths ) out and assume it shows reliable data . 
  you can see there is a huge disparity in gun violence in the eastern seaboard as in relation to the western seaboard , and that the mid-west is relatively pacific : if you divided the us in east vs west the only places where an optimization of the police on the west are oakland , los angeles and at a lesser extent phoenix , seattle and denver ; all with their metropolitan areas . 
  it looks like violence in large cities tends to drag its metropolitan areas to violence particularly in the baltimore-philadelphia-new york belt . 
  so by strengthening i do n't necessarily mean letting them get better equipment , that would depend on the specific needs of the problematic cities and its metropolitan areas . 
  for example they could enlarge the police force and set new police stations in key areas , whatever a comprehensive study and their own experience dictates its the best for the people . 
   well ... 
  i feel like from your perspective , gun abolition is the correct course of action and that gun law leniency ( or freedom , or whatever you want to title it ) is incorrect . 
  it seems like you 're assuming this is a natural fact and insinuating that the reality of the issue is quite black and white . 
  ideally , i think the abolition/harshly strict control of guns by the state is the most desirable objective to reduce gun violence ; nevertheless i acknowledge this is simply not possible , there is no black and white solution to the problem , and as you said , its a solution we all have to build together . 
   when you said that gun laws influence the culture of a nation - ya , sure . 
  to a significant extent ? 
  not so sure . 
  to a significantly positive ( or productive ) extent ? 
  really not so sure . 
  i said laws as a whole ... but you 've got a fair point there . 
  lets return to the slavery example : when slavery was abolished , the african-american people finally became free -- this means his lives were not owned as property anymore -- but they had to face the segregation laws , a remnant of discrimination and hatred . 
  then tensions arose , martin luther king came in and the segregation law was abolished . 
  nowadays the us still has a huge problem with racism , but there has been a huge leap from owning african-americans to granting them but isolating and cornering them to not successfully integrating them into the educational system at large and having more chances to end up in jail than people from other races . 
  there is much more to do and you ca n't stop improving now , but you have to agree that there have been important advancements in the topic ( they used to be freaking property ! ) . 
  regarding the band-aid comparison , you might as well conclude that culture is the ultimate solution to most of the large problems : abortion would seldom be an issue if couples were responsible about their sexuality to the extent of impregnating women only when they 've planned having a child in consensus and gun laws would n't be such an issue if people used them only for regulated hunting or marksmanship -- which means there would be zero gun deaths/violence --, 
  nevertheless , this does n't happen ; that 's why laws are required rather than regulations and guidelines . 
   you said that it appears having more guns actually decreases safety . 
  you can say that , yes . 
  but i put it in a different way : americans appear to have the notion that having guns will allow them to successfully defend themselves in case a violent assailant threatens them , thus protecting their lives and the integrity of their loved ones ( what 's the role of the police force , then ? ) . 
  the fbi also has [ data on justifiable deaths by firearm ] ( https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/expanded-homicide-data/expanded_homicide_data_table_15_justifiable_homicide_by_weapon_private_citizen_2010-2014.xls ) ( this means armed civilians killed a felon while committing a crime ) . 
  taking into account that [ 14,249 people were killed in 2014 ] ( https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/table-1 ) ( [ 8,124 by firearm ] ( https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/table-1 ) ) , and only 229 were able to successfully kill its assailant , that leaves us with approximately 1 successful life preserved in self-defense thanks to firearms per 35.4 who murdered other people thanks to firearms ( i 'm using 2014 information because that 's the most updated data i could find for official american sources ) . 
  so now we get into the terrain of inferential statistics . 
  it 's up to the government to prepare and expose a scientific , rigorous and comprehensive study based on a reliable pool of data ( the most reliable in my opinion ) that tests two -- or more -- hypothesis :, 
  * are armed civilians effective at defending themselves in cases of danger ? 
  * does gun ownership correlate to gun violence ? 
  ( and if it does , is gun ownership the * cause * of gun violence ? 
  -- it sounds like a stupid question , but it 's not -- ), 
  your post was well written . 
  the ad-hominem attack at the end was unnecessary . 
  thank you !, 
  have a nice , jolly weekend too !, 
  for the formatting question : it looks like you figured out later when you wrote your reply !, 
  nevertheless , the reminder is to write three asterisks in a blank row ; like this :, 
   a law is not a magic switch that can change people 's attitudes and opinions . 
  yes !, 
  but can help modify cultural attitudes . 
  if slavery was legal in the us today and a caucasian person murdered an african american , perhaps the caucasian owner would sue the caucasian murderer for * property damage * . 
   think about prohibition ; this did n't last long because people did n't simply stop drinking/selling alcohol because the law said so . 
  that 's exactly what i had in mind when i wrote we ca n't have black-and-white solutions to these kind of problems . 
  nevertheless give this a thought : if prohibition had succeeded how many lives would n't have been lost due to alcohol abuse and violence/accidents derived from it ? 
  i 'm a responsible alcohol consumer and i do n't know about you , but i 'd be happy to give up my right to consume liquid fun and courage in order to spare the lives of troubled people . 
   what i 'm saying is that we , as a society , should strive for the ideal and treat it as a realistic goal to work towards rather than blowing it off as an impossibility and settling with the imposition of law and force to `` fix '' society . 
  but i digress ... 
  look like we 're on the same frequency here , we both agree , but then you said you digress . 
  what i understood is that you still want to give people a shot to fix social problem as a group where i 've given up hope and call for tighter government control . 
  am i right ? 
   gun owners are n't always aiming to kill the criminal but simply defend themselves/family/property . 
  yes , they might pull the trigger and might hit the assailant , but that does n't necessarily mean they 're looking to kill the person ... 
  so i think what i 'm saying is that , again , interpretation of data is integral to utilizing it effectively . 
  true . 
  i did n't quite see it that way . 
  using that number it 's also impossible to know how many conflicts were solved by simple intimidation using guns , and how many other justified , non-lethal engagements there were ( aka successful use of guns in self-defense ) . 
  then again i insist : americans must demand such comprehensive study to the correspondent competent authority ( that i guess it 's the fbi ) . 
   the goal is to alleviate violent crime , the goal is n't to ban guns . 
  it 's imperative that debates like this stick to the ideal goal of peace and harmony rather than taking a side and winning a debate . 
  true again . 
  but the logical thing to do ( even if you do n't want/perceive it necessary to go for a full gun ban ) is to manage to restrict access to guns to people that could cause a massacre , which is bluntly incompatible with the 2 ^ nd amendment . 
  in my opinion the problem with the 2 ^ nd amendment is that is too broad in its scope , and it does n't specify why are guns needed . 
  it 's just inferred that it 's needed so that americans can fight their government in case of a dictatorship . 
  so now you have people who want to keep them because :, 
  * they 're hunters/marksmen . 
  * they feel their homes are safer ( [ even when they 're not ] ( http://www.iansa.org/system/files/risks%20and%20benefits%20of%20a%20gun%20in%20the%20home%202011.pdf ) ) . 
  * feel the need to form a militia to stand out for freedom in case of disaster . 
  * are downright criminals . 
  and on top of that some people think of it like a [ dogma ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dogma ) . 
  perhaps there should be an amendment to the 2 ^ nd amendment to let americans keep and bear arms like they 've always done but limiting the ridiculous reach ( in both firearms permitted and instances that allow its usage ) it currently has . 
  i take up as much information as possible , create an opinion and when it 's clearly defined express it , rather than engaging in debate as a method to build my own perspective ; yet i do n't think * any * of my views/opinions is the ultimate truth and i take my own words with a pinch of salt , as i know i do n't know everything . 
  out of the question but i 've observed that particularly in american politics/social topics the people tends to fit in one mold with a predefined set of views or another , without a common ground to share and being opposite poles : i 've never heard of a libertarian `` pro-life '' or a conservative activist on climate change . 
  sounds reasonable . 
  mexican here . 
  in spanish , `` cursive '' means the illegible calligraphy . 
  thinking . 
   it seems like each religion has its `` enlightenment '' phase . 
  christian enlightenment was full of horrible shit what with the inquisition , witch trials , and justifying slavery . 
  now it is the muslim 's turn . 
  i do believe that this is the time of the muslim dark ages , too . 
  but all nations -- the more developed nations and the one that are not -- will learn their lesson from it ; and if it finished soon , the muslims will be able to shove in our faces how less violent than ours their process was . 
  i think there 's going to be a shooting too , lets hope it 's just a bad hunch . 
  acknowledge that there are many tragedies happening that the media does n't want or does n't care to show . 
  personally , i do n't watch the news and i blocked the news outlets ( even though that 's bad at a certain extent ) to protect my sensitivities . 
  if i found out about the paris , mali , beirut and san bernardino attacks was because of reddit . 
  [ not what the fbi says ] ( https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/expanded-homicide-data/expanded_homicide_data_table_8_murder_victims_by_weapon_2010-2014.xls ) ( not pro gun , it 's just that i trust official sources better ) .
