  back when iraki terrorists were something to laugh about ... 
  i tried to be a pick up artist for a year . 
  devoured lots of books in the process . 
  i learned a lot -- which is always good for us -- but i had a bittersweet taste in my mouth , as i did n't achieve what i wanted . 
  you can not replace social skills with analysis , intuition o logic ; unless you develop an [ alternate personality ] ( http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/135089/4690745-4267361267-ifwt_.png ) , but maybe you should stay away from that ... 
  this is my last try : women can be as sexually attracted to men as we 're usually attracted to women ; it 's just that their bar is set much higher . 
  if you comply with the [ golden ratio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_ratio ) aesthetic ( 1.6 shoulders to waistline ) , girls should water their mouths at your sight . 
  that way you should be able to keep being you and attract girls at the same time . 
  thank you for your kind words , i really needed them ... 
  so much happened so fast : the second ore destroyed and lord vader and our emperor dead -- rebels even say lord vader betrayed us and overthrew the emperor -- plus the super star destroyer and most of our fleet killed . 
  we even lack the guidance of admiral piett , who died in the super star destroyer . 
  i 'm depressed and confused . 
  this whole thing 's really killing me ; the empire had become my life , and now the empire is gone . 
  there 's just a small remnant now . 
  skip the rethoric if you want , my thoughts about the us are not so organized , lol . 
  but then again everything is rethoric . 
  damn . 
  ** rethoric ** : the fact that i 'm a mexican . 
  now , i love mexico and i consider this my homeland , but i also consider myself an americanophile . 
  -- assuming this word exists lol -- i admire many things about the us history and its development as a super power . 
  i also believe in the whole `` american exceptionalism '' thing at a certain extent ( as they have proved it ) . 
  americans have demonstrated they are exceptional for the good , but they 've also demonstrated they are far from perfect and they do n't care if their actions are detrimental to the rest of the world if they can get a profit or feel threatened . 
  in my opinion , the us has a foundation in the principles of equality , therefore they designed a system where ( at least initially and excluding the slavery/racism issue ) the government could n't abuse the people ; ( namely the bill of rights ) the whole american continent has had at least 1 dictatorship , except for the us and canada , as far as i know . 
  the us has robust institutions that can promote launching businesses that provide products and services worldwide : ( i would n't be surprised if facebook alone was worth more than every african nation 's gdp combined ) only americans pull that off . 
  ** actual answer ** : i have seen my people crumbled because of the lack of robust institutions that promote prosperity , equality and security . 
  the us has those , but i consider they have choked on their culture a little bit . 
  one does not simply try to replace the police because of their love of guns . 
  honduras is heavily armed and lacks a capable police . 
  i live in guanajuato and i 'm in contact with hondurans a lot , as it 's part of the central american 's route to the us . 
  it 's heart breaking to see their poverty and how they were displaced in order to seek for a better life ( or just survive ) . 
  africa has same problem for a different reason : heavily armed militias trying to wipe out entire ethnic groups . 
  my point with all this is that a well organized security force , one that 's well scrutinized by the people guarantees the safety of the populace , not the populace itself . 
  the violence in third world countries is a painful example of this , and so is the peace enjoyed by the first worlds . 
  and then there 's europe with its functional democracies and whatnot : school shootings are not a part of their regular life ( and if there are shootings now it 's because of a complex demographic adjustment ) because they use what makes functional democracies functional : not just a voting system , but a system that is * fair * towards citizens , and where citizens can be actually heard by their governments as opposed as just hoping they do n't steal so much the next devaluation/inflation makes life even more difficult to bear . 
  but americans still have * public servants * , perhaps nowadays they do n't shine as much as fdr or jfk but at large , they still work for the people ; this is not representative of the world : how many countries there are ? 
  and how many of those have functional democracies ( not `` democracies '' that practically are more like monarchies in disguise ) ? 
  i would n't say there are many . 
  the us has done much for the world . 
  it has had its mistakes ( terrible ones ) , but overall it has contributed in a positive way . 
  the us has been ( in my opinion ) much more of a blessing to the world than a curse . 
  that 's the reason why we -- or at least i feel -- are compelled to help them preserve its culture , but at the same time prevent its fossilization . 
  why ? 
  because besides the inherent beauty of their culture we ca n't do anything to stop america 's power . 
  but instead of trying to make it change with terror and hatred , we can contribute with ideas to help the us realize what it 's doing wrong so it can grow and keep working for to a more equal , more peaceful , better world . 
  many of us do . 
  did n't you read [ the thread on the 2 ^ nd ammendment ?

  ( dramatization of r/intp according to katie : a feeler-judger ), 
  jokes appart , u/vmxeo had a great response , i 'd just add a few things :, 
  * people are intuitive about social norms ( social * also * includes you two in your intimacy , as a society can be as small as two people ! ), 
  but not to other kind of stuff . 
  we work the opposite way , as we have a whole lot of stuff happening inside our minds ( as you might had noticed ) but social stuff does n't come easy , nevertheless we have our si that lets us remember our mishaps and not making the same mistakes over again . 
  how to fix it ? 
  unfortunately i ca n't find other solution than to make mistakes and learn from them , but i 've noticed ** that learning the theory about body language and social dynamics ** does wonders for us because they are theory and knowledge ; ** it 's a language we understand ** , and knowing the basics of human behavior actually helps us * understand and even justify the social norms * we usually despise . 
  * you are an judger , he 's a perceiver, 
  this causes some trouble because if he messes up with something important because of his distractions ( i lost a judger 's keys once ; stressful situation indeed . ), 
  you 'll be more than annoyed . 
  that can happen because of his ti-ne combo that seldom lets us escape its grip , whereas your observing judging capabilities -- i do n't know what your functional stack is ; do n't feel like you 're unimportant to me , i 'm taking my time to write a thorough response to you -- probably do n't let you be forgetful about anything . 
  ** do n't be so harsh when he fucks it up ** . 
  * let him ** compensate his lack of fe with analysis ** : something we 're good at, 
  did you noticed how i empathized and took care of your feelings ? 
  like any other ability , this can be achieved with time and practice ( although the ultimate goal is to * develop * the fe : this is just a `` patch '' but it 's certainly better than nothing ) . 
  a -- hopefully -- more illustrative example is [ my conversation with gamedrifter ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/intp/comments/3uz75b/hey_infp_here_i_made_my_first_intp_friend/cxkgj9j?context=3 ) . 
  but you 're the feeler anyway , so judge my assessment !, 
  and if it 's useful , comment it with your boyfriend . 
  structural steel drafter ? 
  sweet !, 
  i 'm studying aeronautical engineering and from my perspective , your job sounds appealing !, 
  what do you do , exactly ? 
  do you manufacture the structural steel ? 
  ( there must be different processes because there are lots of different types of steel ) do you operate a cnc machine or something ? 
  that 's a huge thing .

  thread question : no , but a person who develops his/her full potential must be really impressive , much better performer and person overall than many of us can even dream of . 
  bonus question 1 : depends on the subject . 
  calculus was cleared by solving an awful lot of examples but i passed fluid dynamics by working an awful lot of examples and * understanding the formulas * . 
  one can not use the formulas correctly if he/she does n't understand what 's going on . 
  bonus question 2 : all combinations are possible ; it 's a well-known fact that motivation plays a crucial factor in learning , so if you genuinely do n't care about something , it does n't matter how many times you 're exposed to it : you 'll never learn it ( not because of you being dumb but because of the nature of human learning ) .

  i ca n't vote ; i 'm not even american ( nor i have stepped on american soil ever in my life ) . 
  but from here it looks like hillary should be very experienced by now : first lady , senator , secretary of state and now running for president . 
  she definitely knows the white house , that 's for sure . 
  i guess if you liked obama , she 's going to be obama version 2 ( would n't bill version 2 sound better ? ) . 
  sander 's policies on the other hand sound pretty good too !, 
  on the conservative side rubio sounds pretty much the only reasonable guy ( he sounded strong , convincing and level-headed ) . 
  i saw a conservative debate once ( the one that lasted 3 hours ) and him , christie and huckabee seemed the most down to earth for me . 
  sadly , it appears that only carson and * my favorite american person in the whole wide world * -- mexican here -- have true chances of running for the final debate on the republican side . 
  it 's almost like if americans got fed up with traditional politicians already ...
