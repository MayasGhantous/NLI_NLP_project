  [ * repeat as necessary * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_3hrbp1ipw#t=3m13s ), 
  hyper massive text wall ; sorry in advance . 
  it 's an animation idea i 've had since a long time . 
  sadly , i ca n't animate, 
  [ from the start to 1:54 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tai3ym_49my ) --, 
  ned he knows he 's done for : he walks downs the sept of baelor to his ultimate fate . 
  shamed by the ignorant populace he tries to keep his head high but it 's difficult , as his body has suffered much abuse lately , especially his leg . 
  cersei looks to him with an air of arrogance and superiority . 
  meanwhile a guard with lannister reinforcements enter the main door , as the guards recognize the imp ... although ... something looks odd about the guard ... 
  the guard , comprised of about 20 guards , plus the guard leader , an old man and the imp approach the sept and break trough the people to reach the cersei and the condemned . 
  arya feels hopeless ; she watched her father , and her father watched her back . 
  they both know this is the end . 
  * music fades out and stops *, 
  cersei notices something 's wrong with the guard . 
  there 's not only one but * two females * . 
  father 's prostitutes perhaps . 
  or tyrion 's , power makes males have idiotic whims . 
  and who could be that old man with the white staff ? 
  - who are you ? 
  do n't you recognize your brethren when you see it , m ` lady ? 
  said meriadoc brandigammon as he smiled in a playful fashion . 
  shouted cersei . 
  she did n't want to kill stark at first , but priorities need to be changed from time to time . 
  [ 1:57 through 2:43 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tai3ym_49my#t=1m57s ), 
  steel meets steel as aragorn elessar , the high king of gondor jumps in front of ned just in time to save him of certain death . 
  its a furious battle : the old man shouted a couple of unintelligible words as he smote his staff upon the ground and a blue wave expanded though the air from the ground and as the wave touched the warrior 's feet , golden glitter changed the appearance of the alleged guard 's armors as it kept rising from their feet to the their head 's , changing the scarlet chest plates to coats of arms featuring a tree embossed on the chest plates . 
  meanwhile aragorn is having a hard time with ilyn : ilyn is skilled and vicious , its bloodthirst seems makes his stronger each as time passes by . 
  he is quick , and has a fighting style that he knew nothing about except for gandalf 's narrations . 
  parry one thrust , block another . 
  ilyn cuts open one of aragorn 's wrists and after blocking one of his thrusts , he kicks him in the chest and pushes him down long stairs to a dark alley that leads to a medium sized , dim courtyard ; aragorn dropped his sword -- anduril -- as he fell down . 
  the courtyard was surrounded by buildings connected by streets with the city walls at the back and was used as an an armory for the lannister . 
  this was a new experience for payne . 
  now , in the privacy of that area he would have enough time to slay a king at his pleasure . 
  he was obviously superior in combat so he climbed down the stairs and saw were he was hiding . 
  what a coward . 
  a man like that is not worthy of calling himself king . 
  `` i 'll cut his manhood first '' thought ilyn as he approached to the crates where the back of his armor was standing out . 
  he could hear his breathing more clearly as he approached with each step . 
  the crates were blocking him so he slashed them violently , only to reveal hay stuffed in the armor . 
  a desperate gasp was thrown by ser ilyn as aragorn pierced ilyn 's armor with a spear , and nailed him to a nearby wooden crate . 
  then he grabbed a sword and cut his head off . 
  * music stops *, 
  gandalf smokes his pipe in pensiveness while merry , faramir and eowyn are restless as they do n't know what was the fate of his friend , the king of gondor . 
  they are located in a guard tower they improvised as a nursery for ned stark , regent of winterfell . 
  [ 3:51 through 4:14 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqzlfsaz8zw#t=3m51s ), 
  aragorn comes into the small room . 
  faramir , eowyn and merry have radiant smiles and looks on their faces . 
  gandalf , who was sitting on a nearby bench just gave him a sly smile and after a brief and ironic tone and ceremonious reverence he said : `` hail aragorn , son of arathorn , king of gondor . 
  perhaps the king will need the relic of his people '' and handed anduril to him with a smile . 
  begrudgingly he gave him a cold stare at him as he took his sword . 
  why are you here ? 
  -- said ned --, 
  -- get up and i will show you . 
  * music stops *, 
  with the help of faramir and eowyn , ned gets up and walks slowly with the cane that merry handed to him . 
  [ 4:24 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqzlfsaz8zw#t=4m24s ), 
  the late afternoon light bathes ned 's face as he crosses the frame of the keep to the wall 's rampart and follows aragorn , when he turns his head right , he sees a mighty gondor army outside king 's landing 's doors . 
  -- summer has finally come . 
  men of gondor rush into kings landing, 
  the female fountain guard watches how to men hoist the banner of gondor to replace the lannister 's . 
  men drop a large banner of gondor [ like this one ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/7/7a/occupied_gates_of_omashu.png/revision/latest?cb=20121004224644&amp;path-prefix=es ) the soldiers and the fountain guards , puffed up with pride , watch how the banners wave in the air . 
  soldiers are seen helping an old man to pick up the pieces of his partially destroyed wooden fruit cart and taking up formation elsewhere as they stand up to save a child from the beating he was taking by bullies . 
  a drop-dead bombshell with very light clothing steals a pouch from another person and a soldier reaches from behind to seize her arm behind her back forcefully but not brutally against a wall he takes the pouch and whispers to her ear : `` not on our watch '', 
  his companion with crossed arms grins as he watches the scene and then looks to the sky when he hears the cry of an eagle . 
  the gondorian messenger eagle viewed from [ this perspective ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd-zdxateli#t=0m15s ) flaps its wings once , then twice ( as the trumpts roar ) then extends it as it glides through the entrance arch . 
  the camera keeps behind the wall and makes a climbing motion . 
  the camera catches up with the end of the wall to reveal a massive gondor army in shining armor , glittering by the reflection of sunlight as seen from above . 
  5:45 to end . 
  -- you did n't need all the might of gondor to save me aragorn . 
  tell me what 's happening at once . 
  did you come to aid winterfell against the lannisters ? 
  camera focuses on aragorn 's face as he avoids ned 's . 
  -- i fought and corrected the bane of isildur to straighten the sins of my bloodline and save my people . 
  ( turns his face to ned 's worried face ) but now songs will be sung about the bane of aragorn . 
  ( camera shows the face of a wretched , psycopathic looking orc for two seconds ) i hope the wall has enough men . 
  lord of the thrones . 
  friezaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa !!!, 
  i 've watched dbz in segments . 
  never in a continuum . 
  perhaps one day ... 
  i know what the big plots are , but i never watched episode by episode . 
  but they banter way more . 
  and thankfully , they remember * way less * . 
  it 's ok if they do it once in a while but naruto takes it to a whole new level ... how many flashbacks did you count about the fight in the `` valley of end '' -- i do n't know it 's name in english -- where mid transformation naruto faces phase ii cursed sasuke ? 
  there must be literally over eight flashbacks of that scene at least ... 
   it 's actually si . 
  although it seems pretty clear that that is what you meant . 
  true !, 
  little mistake , but i was indeed talking about si . 
   intp -  esfj reverses the order of the function stack , e -  i conversion swaps dom/sec and ter/inf functions . 
  useful observation . 
  what really got my gears is that [ spoiler ] ( / s `` the power relations were absolutely inconsistent -- best shown in the fact that might guy defeats kisame although he had experience on defeating him * and * that he 's got the greatest amount of chakra on the akastuki team * and * he was surrounded by a freaking ocean !, 
  ! -- , and it was always a win for the good guys because of the massive and indiscriminate use of deus ex machina ; like naruto gaining massive power boosts just when needed . 
  also , the akatsuki never pulled clever tricks off while the good guys did it all the time -- i understand that coming from shikamaru , but naruto never characterized himself for being that way -- perhaps the only time the bad guys pulled a clever trick was when deidara tossed the mini-bombs to gaara 's face ; and that 's pretty much it . '' ), 
  sorry for the unbroken spoilers ; spoiler formatting does n't allow breaks . 
  edit : i think reddit 's spoiler formatting is broken . 
  individual subreddits manage their own spoiler format , but obviously this one does n't . 
  would you like me to send you a private message to continue our conversation ? 
  so i think you 're a mechanical engineer , right ?
