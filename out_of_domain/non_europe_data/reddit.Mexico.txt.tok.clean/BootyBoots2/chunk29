  mathematician and philosopher assorted with some economics and korean i think ... 
  you must be an interesting girl . 
  are you a mathematician ? 
  i salute you . 
  dammit , mathematicians always make me feel stupid ( even though they 're usually nice people ) ; i have always struggled with demonstrations . 
  math is a very large science . 
  what are your interests within math ? 
  girl ... 
  that moment when you realize a friendly redditor can be a teacher at your college ... good for you !, 
  keep it up !, 
  dat bastard and his amazing dating skills ... 
  ok , let 's start over with a series of more useful questions ; you have already established you 're not ugly or severely overweight , but i 'm 95 % sure you do n't look like [ this guy ] ( http://i.ytimg.com/vi/vptoowvwerc/0.jpg ) either ( that 's actually important , we 'll get to that later ) . 
  * are you socially awkward ? 
  * do you get stressed easily for not achieving ? 
  * do you think the correct thing to do is to know everything of a determined subject before getting your hands on it ? 
  * do you say things that hurt other people without actively trying to offend you ? 
  * do you analyze situations and consider every possible outcome ? 
  * do you procrastinate a lot because you 're afraid of failure ? 
  * do you avoid social situations because they 're stressful ? 
  * are you tired of the advice `` stop overthinking ! '', 
  because you simply * ca n't * ? 
  you do n't have to answer all of these question back in a message . 
  but if the questions happen to make you feel like you relate a lot to them and the answer to them is an energetic ** yes ** , then feel free to continue the discussion on this thread or send me a private message if you feel like it . 
  thank you for your insight !, 
  the thing with these philosophical riddles is that they can summarize thousands of years of experience , and still mean nothing to the mind that is not prepared for them : to whom it will seem like nonsense rhetoric . 
  great post !, 
  thanks for sharing . 
  it is ... on saudi arabia . 
  if anthony hopkin 's hannibal is an intp , i 'm scared of myself . 
  brilliant explanation . 
   let 's start counting down from 3 !, 
  so much enthusiasm , though !, 
  a better question could be : why have n't the militarized world powers seized the political control of saudi arabia to extract the oil in tranquility while letting muslim authorities take care about mecca already ?

  it 's actually water flying , but yeah ; it 's like the water version of charizard : looks like a dragon , can learn like dragon , ( dragon type moves ) and lance -- a dragon type master -- had a gyrados in his `` dragon '' team ( but being fair there were 3 dragons at the time , and only one fully evolved version ) . 
  \u266b i 've got the moves like dragon , i 've got the moves like dragon i 've got the mooooooooves like dragon \u266b, 
  fight or flight ? 
  * i feel the need . 
  the need for speed woooo !!, 
  pidgeot soaring the skies like a boss !, 
  my problem is something like inverse premature ejaculation : even though it sounds awesome , it 's not . 
  she was the one who asked me if we could end having sex . 
  every time . 
  `` in theory , theory and practice are the same thing ; in practice , they 're not '', 
  we can compensate a bit with analysis , true . 
  but ultimately there 's no escape from developing fe to become whole intps . 
  thank you for the resource !, 
  there are five stages of human courtship behavior ( * all * of them must be met but not in a specific order ) :, 
  * eye contact . 
  * smile . 
  * talk . 
  * touch . 
  * preening ( also known as courting body language ) . 
  it 's impossible to move forwards if there 's not enough touching ; but then again , too much can make the girl repeal you or even get you into trouble if you live in the us or other hard-left places . 
  besides , what is your goal ? 
  a relationship is different to achieve than a one night stand . 
  personally i have no problem in doing the 5 things but in order to pull off a successful attraction you have to make sure * she does those things on her own initiative *, 
  as for the reading on body language goes , i can guarantee you 'll learn to read russian faster than women 's attraction cues ( i 've read 3 different books on the subject , memorized all sorts of body language cues and any regular woman can beat me anytime ) . 
  sorry to be the one to bring it to you but it 's about developing fe . 
  and after a year of devoting myself to the study of pickup and women , i need to tell you that no matter how much you learn and how accurately you can analyze a girl , you wo n't be able to secure her if you do n't have social skills . 
  those we have to struggle with because it 's our inferior function ( as we know it ) . 
  physical, 
  societies have evolved from a much more primitive state and we have n't caught up with technology and improved social structures ; our reptilian brain is still in charge . 
  a woman will make the decision of whether or not you 're attractive -- in person -- within the first or second second of looking at you . 
  it 's not something she needs to/can assess ( unless she 's considering a relationship apart from sex ) . 
  this can seem life a burdening disadvantage , but it can become a powerful advantage if you receive it with a welcoming attitude . 
  oh , this means you have to be sexually attractive . 
  worry not , it 's simple for us men ( yet not easy ) to be physically attractive : try to get your body fat under 10 % ( that 's the athletic realm , 13 % to 18 % is fit and over that is acceptable or overweight which is pretty much non-important because most women wo n't be attracted to you if you fit in those categories ) . 
  i did n't invent that ; see for yourself what [ the ladies ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ladyboners/comments/3w32gn/i_put_those_6_gifs_of_captain_america_breaking/ ) say -- or react -- themselves . 
  you might think : `` hey booty , it 's not the same to try to get laid than to seek for a relationship '' . 
  in this particular case , yes it is . 
  because the attraction is the building block of whatever you want to do with the girl , whether its just having sex with her or building a relationship that may or may not lead to marriage . 
  it 's something we have to literally work out . 
  by the way you can not hunch ; keep your posture straight . 
  i always ask the same : do you comply with the golden ratio for men ? 
  ( you said you lift . ), 
  if you do you really should n't have problems with girls ; they should be throwing themselves at you , and even if they 're not because you happen to live in an extremely sexually repressed culture then just move on . 
  having such body * makes them actually realize you qualities or even attribute nonexistent ones to you * . 
  i think there 's just a little misunderstanding where she interpreted in this particular case `` why does she pick such colors in class , is there any way to pick * better * colors '' -- operational efficiency -- as `` damn , she picks the worst colors : could she ever improve to get the coloring right ? '', 
  -- harshly judging performance which can lead to emotional hurt --, 
  perhaps a clarification would be necessary to keep doing your thing . 
  but since we 're intps and we like to optimize performance i 'd like you to consider this : do n't talk about performance with her . 
  that 's a hell of a good way to stimulate conversation for intps and istps and good to let intjs , entjs and pretty much any other non-feeling j a chance to show their achievements and get some ego-stroking in return . 
  when speaking , be a pitcher and pitch the balls each type wants to catch . 
  use your feeler friend as a guinea pig ; next time you talk to her talk in terms of feelings . 
  if you ca n't / does n't come off naturally to you ask her about what you feel , take advantage of your functional stack ( ne , si ) to create a magical world of feel good where she can thrive in . 
  learn about other types and assess them . 
  if you can accurately predict the types of other people and talk accordingly to their desires , you 'll be the perfect conversant : being able to win the favor of whoever you want . 
  i just had an ah-ha !, 
  moment . 
  if you excuse me , i 've got some reading to do . 
  and afterwards some conquering to do . 
  [ the world will be mine !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7edeoeuxdmu#t=0m9s ), 
  not quite , but yes quite !, 
  perhaps you 're talking about the [ pareto principle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pareto_principle ) . 
  what i referred when i said the `` golden ratio '' was [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_ratio ) . 
  men wo n't take you more seriously , they 'll just be afraid that you might get violent ( but at a certain extent yes , they will associate physical power with social authority in average , but not always ) . 
  women wo n't adjust , take that for sure : but most likely you 'll make their underpants tingle which is pretty much the same for practical effects because of the overriding effect of the reptilian brain -- provided you accomplish to provoke physical sensations on them . 
  i 'm trying to avoid saying `` making their vaginas soaked '' but fuck it .
