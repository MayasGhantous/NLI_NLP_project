  this mishap shall not occur again . 
  the price of the stamp and mostly the shipping price . 
  in the context he 's saying it , it seems like a good investment though . 
  which country do you live in ? 
  was n't `` fetish '' a word to describe a concentrated sexual interest for a certain attribute/attitude ? 
  someone having a fetish for boobs will like busty girls * because * of their bosomy and in spite of everything else whereas a person having a fetish for indian girls will do the same , with focus on her race/ethnicity and in spite of everything else . 
  let 's see ... spiked narrow tunnel entrance , with a particular elliptic shape guarded by attractive women and crowned on top by a defiant snake . 
  [ it has to be said . 
  i 'm mexican . 
  i thought you lived in a latin american country . 
  you know . 
  in my spare time i 'm a consumer of animation and i can safely say this is the finest i have ever seen . 
  having said that i have to sate every victory won by a group takes a joint effort . 
  the result is just an overlap of everyone 's excellence on their task performance . 
  qatar beats us at obesity ? 
  wow , this is such a relief , [ as i thought mexico was the greatest soda consumer .

  like on may 1st attacks , where the `` narco-blockade '' happened ? 
  it was in guadalajara . 
  i 've said this before and i 'll say it again . 
  violence is never to be condoned , diminished or failed to be prosecuted but . . 
  we 're living in year 2015 . 
  they 're living in year 1436 . 
  what was christianity doing in christian year 1436 ? 
  you know what man ? 
  screw them . 
  you must be like 14-16 . 
  i 'm 24 and i can tell you that what you did was ** epic ** . 
  and not many guys dare to do what you did in their entire lives . 
  you needed all the courage you could get and you 're * not * to blame . 
  from a logical standpoint you did well , but you still need to learn about the layers and layers and layers of nuances girls have in their minds . 
  and let me tell you a secret : * they 're never satisfied . 
  * so raise your head up , `` fapmaster '' because you 're the bravest bastard that school has to offer . 
  if he ever comes to mexico and i run into him , the coronas are on my account , bro . 
  true , but the message is that those bastards are running wild there , and able to racketeer at their discretion . 
  ( namely `` protection tax/money/derecho de piso '' ) i hope violence never escalates at michoac\u00e1n 's level though ... 
  [ totally stupid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p7redbwsyi ) by andrew wk . 
  it progresses from being a cool rebellious song ( where i ca n't find it 's relation to stupidity whatsoever ) to a part that makes you think to a part where it becomes an absolute anthem for people who are afraid of change , or of themselves . 
  van persie is way too good of a head striker . 
  ask casillas . 
  \u266a do-do-do do ! \u266a, 
  yes . 
  the prefix `` mega '' equals multiplying by 10 ^ ( 6 ) , the prefix `` giga '' equals multiplying by 10 ^ ( 9 ) . 
  * fainted . 
  mexican guy . 
  it 's not . 
  the [ law for statutory rape in mexico ] ( http://www.diputados.gob.mx/sedia/sia/spi/spi-iss-32-10.pdf ) in almost all states coincides that criminals charged for statutory rape are those who `` copulate with a person ( explicitly woman in half of the states ) who is over 12 years of age and under 18 years of age '' . 
  ( lower limits vary but 12 is the lowest , lower than that constitutes another crime ) so even though the concept of `` age of consent '' is not explicitly stated in mexico , it 's safe to say its the age of 18 . 
  trivia : in two states it 's not considered statutory rape if the offender marries the victim . 
  ( yep ... mexico ),

  / u/ihavethatpower the initiative sparked after concerns of treason on troopers due to improper use of footage included on intelligence reports regarding bobba fett and high value targets for the empire on jabba the hutt 's barge . 
  i appreciate the fact you drew our predecessors , the clones . 
  and three times less people than mexico city . 
  ( just the city , not the metropolitan area ), 
  the more things change , the more they stay the same ... 
  internet rule : does n't matter how obscure your thing is . 
  if it 's there , somebody will relate to it and like it .

  well i wrote this because it 's perplexing to me how we 're sometimes so self absorbed we it 's almost impossible to realize certain things . 
  there are people who would give anything to get back to when they were single with no kids . 
  and since we have little power to change who we are , why not taking that for our advantage ? 
  that 's why i recall the big lie . 
  because it 's a lie . 
  not all women are evil , sure , but if you genuinely fear `` the witches of the west '' , perhaps you wo n't feel bad about your loneliness . 
  ( quite the opposite in fact , you can make your loneliness feel liberating and awesome ), 
  anyway , different people have different brain chemistries , and have different life stories . 
  if it suits you , take it . 
  if not , not . 
  well , yeah but ... society is rewarding the others while rejecting us . 
  so our nature punishes us . 
  what if we could renounce our nature ? 
  i replied to crystal logic why i wrote this on this sub . 
  you hear an ultraaaaaa ^ aaaaa ^ aaaaa ^ aaaaa, 
  revenge is never discussed , and i do n't intend to do it , at all .

  lol , tell donald about it ... 
  seriously though , ( mexican here ) forget we speak different languages , forget immigration , forget the economy , forget everything . 
  all americans should agree with me when i say to both mexicans and americans that :, 
  ** nature **, 
  ** hates **,
