  why do lack of contact with the opposite sex ( for straight guys ) can demoralize us so much ? 
   like a relationship . 
  pretty much a normal one . 
  if a `` human '' pet is the new definition of a relationship where there is a master and a sub-human party that devotes all of his/her life energies in being happy and making you happy while they 're at it ( hence human treating them nicely but not as a dignified human equal ) , then i 'm worried about the course of human race . 
  giving it a thought , why is it so necessary to `` accomplish '' ? 
  is it so that we can be famous and recognized by other people ? 
  ( `` validation '' is what i think some people in the datesphere call it ) . 
  true , i ca n't think of any famous eunuch but people have proven to be very resilient : and women ( just by being women they have much lesser quantities of testosterone than men ) have managed to get in power places and get scientific achievements so testosterone is not a magical chemical that lets you be great in life in the eyes of others . 
  neat advice , however ... 
   you need a baseline of testosterone to be healthy . 
  well , i did read a book by a therapist that said that treating men with low testosterone levels improved their lives dramatically , so you might be right ... 
  damn . 
  hmmmm . . that seems like another issue on its own . 
  nevertheless it seems that the post wii war trend is to happen only in poor/conflicted areas and tensions about secession in some areas . 
  so the countries with mass destruction capabilities do n't want to engage war with each other , because the risk of getting nuked is not worth it . 
  i ca n't see how war would re-establish a status quo in the dating world . 
  no , but regular pets are not human so by definition they 're sub-human ( this does n't mean you can/should treat them in an * inhuman * way ! ) . 
  the normal situation with having a pet is a human master who takes care -- owns -- of a sub-human pet ( namely an animal ) , i simply think you can not ( or should not ) extrapolate that kind of relationship into a human-human relationship ; it would be dehumanizing . 
  it 's frustrating that humankind is so primitive , we can not enjoy long lasting peace and prosperity because that 's `` feminine '' . 
  sounds more reasonable . 
  alas , it seems that whether we live in poverty and violence or wealth and prosperity , sexual fulfillment is impossible . 
  currently doing that . 
  not doing peanut butter though . 
  it seems that women get hit as hard as men when their primary instincts are not met :, 
  * male : sex . 
  * female : stability ( monetary , emotional , etc. ), 
  trough marriage . 
  helping them is important too , as all people are valuable assets to society . 
   work harder at being more attractive . 
  currently doing that . 
  i 'm a starter yet i 'm doing it for myself , not for women . 
  nevertheless , i would feel more frustrated if girls sexually invited me after i get jacked because it would confirm how primitive they are , and how love is just an ideal . 
  on this regard , i ca n't see the end of the tunnel . 
  yet , if there was a way to get rid of sexual desires in a natural way , catholic priests would already be praising the lord in jubilee , instead of raping kids . 
  care to share one with us ? 
  holy shit !, 
  so apparently women have the upper hand in modern life . 
  damn . 
  well , i guess we 're on our own now . 
  i wonder where our emperor was at the time . 
  surely he must have been coordinating an important diplomatic affair elsewhere . 
  does somebody know if our emperor had good fighting capabilities ? 
  and he shall smite the wicked and plunge them into the fiery pit !, 
  i posted a [ long daydream ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/intp/comments/3vvkhu/what_is_your_current_infatuation_going_on_in_your/cxr9eax?context=3 ) some days ago . 
  [ i know !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgnwoy37u64#t=1m14s ), 
  damn !, 
  good use of those cognitive functions !, 
  could you provide the link , please ? 
  skill is power . 
  originally i subscribed to the `` knowledge is power '' ideology , but then i came to realize that knowledge is just an important building block to get what ultimately gives us power : abilities . 
  abilities enable us to do what we need to achieve our goals , but knowledge -- most of the time -- enables us to have a starting point to get such abilities . 
  so even though knowledge is more fundamental than skill , it 's important to not lose sight of the fact that in the end , skill matters more . 
  edit : do n't think i missed the russian `` i '' ( backwards `` n '' ) in your flair . 
  nice detail . 
  oh , perhaps i did n't state that : i do want to avoid the `` brutally honest '' stereotype , as it could be harmful ; so while expressing honestly , respect and tact are paramount but not limiting . 
  god , i love open minded religious people like you !, 
  i get your point . 
  nevertheless i did try to compensate social situations with analysis : it did n't work for me ; i tried different approaches , read more information , crafted new hypothesis , then tested them and failed . 
  so the sense of failure withdrew me from action and made myself withdraw , which in turn would make me feel unaccomplished and a little miserable , thus falling in a downwards spiral . 
  then the events in my text happened and i remembered about the perspective of mental limitations , one of the most obvious being the self restrictions associated with not sinning . 
  when you rationalized the schr\u00f6dinger 's cat analogy into your life , you decided to not allow fear of failure to take over your life . 
  same outcome , different thought process . 
  i do n't hate christians . 
  actually i do have my reserves about osho 's somehow disdainful remarks on christianity in the first chapters of the book i cited . 
  if you re-read the quote you cited , you 'll notice i wrote `` strict religious environment '' which includes all fanatic/literal religious practice ( this also means i 'm not pointing out the dangers of christianity only and that every non fanatic/literal religious practice falls off the scope of my current criticism ) . 
   born and raised christian, 
  nobody is born a christian or a muslim or a communist . 
  the dogmas you accept as true depend largely on the culture imposed to you and on the degree of commitment and importance you bestow to them . 
  christmas spirit right there . 
  ugghhh ... 
  ok , knee-jerk answer is the typical `` stop overthinking and go for it '' but just read me : our cluster of thoughts is paralyzing , and our fear of failure even more . 
  so i suggest you try this : while minding your business * do not think * . 
  that 's right ; shut your brain up . 
  do what you 're doing but do n't let your brain talk to you . 
  did you succeed ? 
  cool !, 
  now you know how it feels ; pick yourself up and go talk to the girl . 
  if you analyze the worst case scenario , you 'll notice nothing physically harmful can happen to you ( unless you 're like mr. bean or something lol ) . 
  but the real worst case is if she rejects you and you panic and cringe hard . 
  that 's what is to fear : cringing . 
  perhaps by silencing the mind you 'll be immune to cinging ( a physical * sensation * ) and you wo n't come across as awkward !, 
  if she rejects you , maybe she was n't prepared for the train of awesomeness that you are , or she 's shy , or she rejects you only to repent later ( stuff women do ) , or she simply does n't want to be with you . 
  either way she 'd be missing out . 
  mexican here . 
  yeah , that happens . 
  nevertheless you could simply be honest and say `` i 'm just not in the mood to go out right now , do n't feel bad '' in an assertive way ; though i recognize this could be tricky in our cultural environment . 
  it 's difficult but i think it 'll pay off in the long run . 
  lol , ecuador ... one of the things i love about latin america is it 's music . 
  especially it 's * bad * -- yet catchy -- music . 
  [ \u266b ay mi conejito era tan banid\u00f3n , ay caramb\u00e1 \u266b ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymvqef5ef5q ),

  usually yes , i 've let the sense of failure interfere too much in my life , effectively halting it . 
  but now i see a new , much more unconstrained panorama in front of me . 
  jobs was kicked out of his own company ( a huge failure ) but he came back like a boss . 
  arjen robben failed a clear goal opportunity on a champions league final and chelsea won . 
  later on he scored a critical goal on the next manchester united cl final . 
  if he became depressed because of losing that first match , he would n't have been the key figure for the win the next time . 
  there must be lots of examples in sports , finance , politics and basically anywhere in life .
