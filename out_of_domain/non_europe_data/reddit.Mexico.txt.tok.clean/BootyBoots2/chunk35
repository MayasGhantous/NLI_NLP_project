  ( or at least i do . ), 
  your writing style deliciously matches your flair . 
  i love having visitors on this sub ( unlike real life lol ) . 
  share with us more often !, 
  ** tl ; dr ** : the future is unpredictable . 
  we do n't know what will the future be because we try to predict the future by projecting the present ( look at back to the future 's 2015 and the real 2015 ; that 's what they thought 2015 would look like in the 80 's ) . 
  i read a famous economist -- whose name i ca n't remember for the time being -- predicted the soviet union would surpass the us by 1998 ( then he changed it to 2002 or so ) . 
  what he did n't have in mind was [ this man ] ( https://esp.rt.com/actualidad/public_images/8f7/8f7142a2843a32a205b815f05617a59c_article.jpg ) . 
  modern day jihad : when the attack on ny happened everyone thought attacking the middle east to find osama and -- since they were already there -- kill saddam was a great idea . 
  why ? 
  because imaginary wmd 's and freedom , bitches . 
  what the us could n't predict was that saddam , dictator and all , safeguarded iraq -- and as we 're seeing now , europe -- from fanatics so hardcore al-qaeda says they 're brutal . 
  now , the exodus from syria to europe and the turmoil in the middle east will have consequences ; but although many people have a catastrophic mindset saying that muslims will overrun europe and their states and cultures will disappear forever , those people are using the present -- and a dangerous mixture of fear and logic -- to try to predict the future : perhaps it will be the way they say , or perhaps there 's a critical factor we 're not seeing right now because it 's not obvious that will decide the outcome . 
  few revolutions are revolutionary . 
  they 're mostly a bloody change of people in power , perhaps boundaries on the map may change a bit . 
  if it makes you feel better , i recognize the republicans have lost the great shine they once had . 
  it 's a loss for the us and at a lesser extent , for the world . 
  take it from one of the people who will pay for your border wall . 
  as a regular text wall writer i have to tell you it 's important that you break the text in pieces where the story follows-up . 
  that way is more pleasant to the eye , and easier for the brain to process the information you want to communicate . 
  follow [ this link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/comments/1vjfm9/how_do_i_insert_a_blank_line_between_2_lines_of/ ) for a tutorial on how to insert blank lines , just to make it look more appealing . 
  i noticed you wrote an entire paragraph in italics . 
  if you write like this you 'll defeat the purpose of italics because the text you tried to put emphasis on * will be lost in a sea of words * . 
  trust me : with correct formatting you can make long posts both enjoyable and attractive to readers . 
  after the obligatory formatting scold i can simply tell you i empathize with you . 
   i am just able to suppress them better than others . 
  that 's not so good because just like you stated afterwards , the pressure accumulates and you do n't want to go all krakatoa on others ( actually i think we could be dangerous , even potentially deadly on a given unleash ; so be careful !, 
  consider therapy -- which is nothing shameful , as we know it -- or something else ) . 
  besides , the other face of `` being able to suppress feelings '' is actually not being able to * demonstrate them * which is particularly bothering to feelers because , since they see the world in terms of feeling -- just like we naturally see the world in terms of analysis -- they process your apparent lack of emotions as very negative . 
   i feel this way with my girlfriend , that i am dropping that little soft , still warm , fuzzy dead creature from my mouth at her feet and say , `` see baby , i love you '' and she heartlessly vomits . 
  it did n't happen to me like you describe but when i was in a relationship with my ex-girlfriend she wanted me to read her mind because it was n't `` cute '' that she had to tell me what she expected from me . 
  and i tried to guess and give her experiences and gifts i thought she 'd appreciate but instead f her exploding in joy and thankfulness she put her pretty face on and be like : `` meh '' . 
   that logical barrier is the reason i am unable to relate to so many other types , that is the purpose of me seeming emotionless , but in reality , i am just as emotional as any other person . 
  welcome to the intps inferior function : ** fe ** . 
  the freaking function that everyone else has , save for us ; we 'll have to develop it in time . 
  ** experience and life will make you carve your way through blood , sweat and tears ** . 
  so your repressed feelings make you have physiological reactions ; that 's a really bad thing , i suggest you go see a therapist if you feel physical pain because of emotions , for your safety and the safety of others . 
  even though you 'll need to find your own way to deal with the lack of fe i 'll suggest you something i 'm doing and i 'll share an idea with you . 
  the suggestion is to * stop thinking * while you 're doing things : you can hear the non-stop voice in your head that 's talking to you with a variety of topics that range from details about your favorite videogame to quantum physics to ranting about brittany 's bitchiness . 
  just like you can stop talking you can stop thinking and just paying attention to your surroundings . 
  vipassana meditation focuses on this aspect . 
  if you do n't have a clue of what i 'm talking about or you simply ca n't conceive shutting your mind up -- fellow intp , i get you -- i suggest you try it . 
  there must be guided meditations on youtube . 
  the idea is many feelings are just mental constructs . 
  you can read what i wrote if you you 're interested on it and follow [ this link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/intp/comments/3x8j0u/failure_is_sin/ ) . 
  i 'm trying a new strategy and i think i 've nailed it , so i 'm sharing it with you : do n't think . 
  shut your inner dialog up like you silence your mouth . 
  vipassana meditation can show you how to do it if you do n't know how , most likely there are guided meditations on youtube ( perhaps a superb stress reliever too ) . 
  i 'm also amazed by how certain stimulus and perceptions provoke * physiological reactions * . 
  my problem is with the concept of the fear of failure . 
  but i think it can be extended to many other feelings . 
  so what are we to do ? 
  recognize the negative labels and get rid of them ( uselessness for example ) . 
  more than coping , its realizing we can do * anything * we want , our limits are literally in our minds . 
  i explain myself in [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/intp/comments/3x8j0u/failure_is_sin/ ) . 
  tell both parties separately ( or jointly if you do n't cringe ) that you appreciate them both and that you tired to mediate peace , but they 'll have to fix their issues on their own because it 's being tiring to you and you have no obligation to be anybody 's emissary . 
   he is a very good friend and is definitely worth more than all the shit in the world . 
  perhaps , but no friend is worth taking any amount of shit . 
  i lasted with mine for a year and a half . 
  it 's tough , more so if any of the two parties is not very mature . 
  not wonderful at all for me . 
  oh , mobile user !, 
  never mind , then . 
  it 's actually remarkable that you wrote such a lengthy text on mobile . 
  vipassana is about concentration but not for the sake of it ; the goal is to stop the train of though : so concentrate on breathing and if you think about something it 's ok , you do n't have to beat yourself to it , just go back to not thinking . 
  i did n't try with bootyboots1 to be fair , just went right for the 2 . 
  i wonder who the original booty is . 
  edit : damn ... 
  i knew [ alma ] ( http://imgur.com/2d8ffuv ) was into something . . 
  that sounds like a heartwarming response ... costumers may feel better after talking to you than expecting the boring standard answers, 
  stuck in a massive traffic jam in a highway and i could n't hold on a call of nature anymore . 
  so i said `` fuck it '' and urinated in a nearby bush , so kinda everyone saw it . 
  the cringy part was that there was actually a restaurant ( with restrooms ) nearby uphill -- accessible by simply walking -- and the sign for it was just aside the place where i released myself . 
  i also got whistled for that . 
  why 'd you cringe for being romantic and a dedicated boyfriend ? 
  dude ... 
  if they explained your situation and include terms like `` needy '' , `` pussy '' , `` alpha '' and the like , then yes ; i do n't think you should be ashamed at all ... 
  but otherwise [ treat women like they deserve ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dirvrndhwt4#t=7m41s ) . 
  god of war clip so obligatory nsfw | also sarcasm . 
  simply refuse to be anybody 's emissary anymore . 
  you were nice and you 're getting paid with insulting and manipulation ? 
  also , you do n't have to keep doing something you hate for your class 's entertainment . 
  your friend seems really immature -- at least the way you portray him -- by the way . 
  does n't matter if he 's an intellectual genius . 
  ok ... nice story anyway . 
  guess the covenant got their religion wrong . 
  thanks for sharing but i 'm a little confused : why 'd you reply to me with a story ? 
  is this what you imagined while reading my comment ? 
  [ want some more fun ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utzswwiv9i4#t=3m48s ) hehehe ... 
  then , why do n't you tell them to cut if off ? 
  simply say to your friend : i do n't want to hear about the teachers anymore . 
  think what you want about me . 
  tell you professors : could we move on with the class ? 
  or is x the subject ? 
  if they do n't move on , pack your stuff and get out . 
  `` if you want a symbolic gesture , do n't burn the flag ; wash it . '', 
  - norman thomas, 
  basucally , you were so so concentrated and had so much fun , you forgot you were interacting competitively with * your dad 's boss * . 
  you also forgot you were in a social environment .
