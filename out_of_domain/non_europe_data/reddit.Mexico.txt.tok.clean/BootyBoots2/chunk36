  hip hip !, 
  take your time katie . 
  i know people have lives to live outside reddit . 
  it feels good that you answered me because i was n't expecting a response from you !, 
  ( that 's a positive thing by the way . ), 
  i 'll be delighted to read your reply if you care to do so . 
  if not , do n't feel bad : [ my heart will go on ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2wh8mhjnhm#t=0m19s ) . 
  [ i 'm in the mood now ] ( https://i.warosu.org/data/fa/img/0063/45/1371473782246.jpg ) ... 
  have you taught him the basics yet ? 
  ( sit !, 
  come here !, 
  lay down ! ), 
  i had an enfp girlfriend , can confirm : they have high feeling standards that sometimes we ca n't comply with . 
  i know it 's hard to see past the emotional wreckage but it seems you 've got two options : try go all in to recover her by impressing her or just suck it up and move on with a girlfriend that is perhaps more mature and understanding . 
  dammit , the first 10 words resonate hard in me . 
  so i tried to use [ this code ] ( http://codepen.io/squarecat/pen/kuhsl ) to make it more dramatic . 
  i 'm poking fun at a previous conversation i had with her . 
  since she appears to hate being on the spotlight , as a manner of courtesy i 'll refrain from posting the conversation i 'm talking about ( unless she tells me she 's cool with it ) . 
  nah , just having a little fun . 
  but since it 's not as fun to you , we 'll leave it here and pretend nothing happened . 
  you said you hated being an infj . 
  are you sure you 'd want to be one of us ? 
  we tend to be forgetful because we 're stuck up in our minds . 
  * wo n't you hate yourself after you 've spent a hefty amount of money ( and being stressed and embarrassed if you lost someone else 's stuff ? ), 
  for re-purchasing lost stuff ? 
  * wo n't you hate yourself when the world painfully shows yourself you 're a `` social retard '' incapable of understanding social norms everybody else seems to have integrated by default ( and therefore never explaining them to you ) ? 
  * wo n't you hate yourself to know you 're intelligent enough to pursue your lofty dreams but you 're too `` lazy '' to follow them and that fear of failure could paralyze you for years ( or decades ) making you feel even more miserable ? 
  * wo n't you hate yourself when you lose hope of ever finding a partner even though you know you 're good looking , intelligent , capable and mindful because dating consist on a cluster of attitudes you simply . 
  do n't . 
  * wo n't you hate yourself when you see that you lack `` commonplace '' , low skill abilities everyone else is qualified to do but yourself ? 
  if you do n't mind about any of these things , then welcome to the bane train !, 
  nice ... 
  r/empiredidnothingwrong because it lets me roleplay in a star wars themed environment . 
  r/reversedrescuegifs because they 're hilarious . 
  r/ru because i 'm learning russian and the articles posted help me improve my language skills . 
  i unsubscribed to every default sub except for tifu because the stories are entertaining and eli5 because they bring up interesting topics . 
  sometimes i dwell on r/seduction and r/purplepilldebate because i 'm a masochist in the sense that i know reading reddit comments about that is not good for me ; yet i still visit them . 
  use magical scissors that paste ... 
  great gif !, 
  i do n't know if there 's a subreddit for those who are not ~ ~ foolish enough to side with the empire ~ ~ brave enough to defend the galaxy from religious terrorists whose plan clearly is to undermine the stability and prosperity achieved by our late emperor palpatine . 
  uhhh ... 
  this is fe territory , mate . 
  logic and analyzing can do little to no good . 
  it could actually backfire . 
  why do n't you try to speak upfront to her and tell her you like her ? 
  if she rejects you or not it does n't matter . 
  but not letting her play games with you is important . 
  hold your ground . 
  perhaps you disagreed when you read the part where i said that it does n't matter if she rejects you or not . 
  it 's true . 
  what you really have to care about is cringing . 
  the emotional hurt is what -- redundantly -- hurts the most on the long run because it can paralyze you from approaching other girls , therefore refraining you from meeting girls and making you feel miserable which scares girls further and so on a downward spiral ... do n't let that happen ; simply breathe deeply and let go of your feelings and do n't assign negative adjectives that can limit yourself ( i 'm a looser , unattractive , depressed -- even if you are -- etc ) . 
  you are welcome . 
  i 'm reading a book called `` the confidence gap '' by dr. russ harris . 
  as a complimentary reading `` how to silence the mind '' by osho . 
  thank you , fellow mastermind . 
  functions are not mutually exclusive , the catch is to develop your functions so you can be a more wholesome person . 
   so ti users will have hard time writing 100page essay more than te users . 
  not quite , actually writing essays should be exciting for intps because of the ti-ne combo . 
  just analyze ( ti ) the motherload of information you collected/observed/produced about the given subject ( ne ) and write it down . 
  i think writing a thesis involves more te , as you have to organize and report features -- most likely measurable -- of the subject at hand , that 's why i agree with you when you said :, 
   every business/school all uses te writing format . 
  so when you ask :, 
   how do i communicate and write like te ? 
  i 'd say you focus on observable/measurable features of the subject and write a * report * . 
  writing a report sounds te to me . 
  writing an * essay * sounds ti to me . 
  hello !, 
  i 'm an intp male who has recently had an epiphany about life : we need to develop all cognitive functions because they 're simply the right tools to act on specific situations : if you need to drill a hole and your only tool is a screwdriver ( yet the finest screwdriver that has ever existed ) you 're going to have a hard time ; you could have a much easier time if you have a drilling machine , even if it 's a low quality one . 
  perhaps your so needs to develop fe asap . 
  regarding him being not sure about if he 's in love with you i think this boils down to semantics :, 
  * he simply has n't formed a conceptual definition about love and maybe this happens because love is a very important concept in his life but he feels he has n't gathered sufficient data to conclude one . 
  * he does n't care about it . 
  -- on a quick overview this does n't seem the case --, 
  answering your question i feel emasculated when a girl i love can perform a certain task that i subjectively consider `` masculine '' * but i 'm unable to do so * ( driving , changing tires , fixing cars and actually any mechanical car-related ability ) but i really do n't mind her being more proficient than i am in say , cooking or if she can perform the `` masculine '' abilities but i can , as well . 
   i look at it more like i am trying to gradually help foster the development of the fe , without putting him into shock . 
  nice , considerate girl . 
  i wish mine had been a little bit like you . 
  that 's a good point you made but more than pointing out the need to develop the rest of the cognitive functions , we need to identify where to use them ( and do use them ) . 
  actually i think my worst weakness is not lack of fe , but lack of se . 
  * going shopping ? 
  se time . 
  * embarking in a spiritual journey ? 
  ne time . 
  * need to craft a system to minimize loss and maximize gain ? 
  ti time . 
  * care to preserve traditions or recall past mishaps to not repeat them again ? 
  si time . 
  * party time !, 
  fe time . 
  * organize facts previously gotten by a field practice and report them in a neat and professional way . 
  te time . 
  * see through people 's masks to reveal their true self . 
  fi time . 
  * acknowledge how systems interact with each other and what links them together . 
  ne time . 
  excelling at the two main functions but not developing others deprives us of the many experiences that life has to offer . 
  it also helps oneself to better bond to others , rather than missing the experiences because of being thrown in an environment where one 's two main functions are not useful .
