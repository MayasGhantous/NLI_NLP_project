  there 's no way , but i certainly know how to defend those exhausts : with experienced ground troops to guard the shied generators and vessels to crush pilots on the air or space . 
  actually space , they should n't have even crossed the exosphere . 
  capable for slaughtering unarmed people but useless to defend their weapon . 
  true , the empire failed twice but the circumstances were unique : we were too well defended to expect the disaster . 
  the first order had a precedent set forth by us . 
  it 's inexcusable that they did n't learn . 
  who did i betray ? 
  i stuck close to my emperor and lord vader until our empire and their lives ceased to exist . 
  how could i betray the first order if i have n't joined them ? 
  romance ... 
  ok , so far the responses i 've read do n't address the issue nor give you a positive feedback . 
  since we 're intps instead of saying `` be calm , everything 's gon na be alright !, 
  rise and shine ! '', 
  -- though you could use some emotional pat on the back , as i perceive it -- i 'm going to tell you the science of what 's happening : you 're having a cluster of cognitive errors -- or distortions -- that make you feel that way , but they are n't true ( so people were right when they encouraged you ) . 
   lack of efficiency , intelligence , originality , are all things that make me as an individual . 
  [ labeling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cognitive_distortion#labeling_and_mislabeling ), 
   something i 'm good at . 
  there does n't seem to be anything . 
  labeling + [ splitting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cognitive_distortion#splitting_.28all-or-nothing_thinking_or_dichotomous_reasoning.29 ), 
   i make no meaningful contribution to society and today especially this realization is wearing me down . 
  [ emotional reasoning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cognitive_distortion#emotional_reasoning ) or [ overgeneralization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cognitive_distortion#overgeneralization ), 
  ok , now the actual advice :, 
  * it 's ok if you do n't trust what i 'm saying as i 'm not a psychologist , just a fan ; why do n't you ** go see a psychologist and get therapy ** ? 
  the fact that you said :, 
   so then , why am i even living ? 
  is worrying alone , perhaps you 've contemplated suicide or have signs of depression building ( i had a slight depression so i know how it feels ; it sucks ) . 
  * choose a random skill you 're interested on acquiring and devote to getting better . 
  and when you measure your progress be objective ( which means getting rid of your cognitive errors or biases ) and feel good for improving . 
  in my case i started studying russian because it 's a language and culture that fascinates me , and a language perceived difficult for westerners , so i challenged myself to it . 
  now i can read cyrillic at a much better pace than when i just stated and i know a handful of words ( approx . 
  when i read some russian texts i catch the context every once in a while , it 's cool to see your progress and that demonstrates you * can * generate abilities . 
  * in general , identify negative thoughts and cut them off . 
  just shut your mind up , silence it . 
  if you do n't have any idea of how to do it look up in youtube for some vipassana guided meditation ( just so you know how it is to not think for a while and then make a conscious effort to deter your negative thoughts ) . 
  * notice the relativity of things and re-frame your values :, 
  intelligence , wealth , power ... how much of this things is desirable/acquirable/needed in your life ? 
  how much money does one need to have in order to be considered rich according to your standards ? 
  one million dollars ? 
  100 million dollars ? 
  let 's suppose your standard is 10 million dollars . 
  how rich is that person in comparison to bill gates , warren buffet or carlos slim ? 
  maybe you 'd be surprised to know that the people you considered rich have a very modest amount of money compared to the richest people out there . 
  * start from zero . 
  no , do n't sell all of your stuff and start a new life in a new city , -- even though is an extreme resource that may have been of use to more than one person in the history of humankind -- just acknowledge that ** you can start to develop any ability and building up on it to reach a desired level of skill , no matter what 's your initial level of skill ( talent ) ** . 
  the best performers develop their abilities , and for those people talent has little to do with their success because they have a [ growth mindset ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/achievement_orientation#growth_mindset ) instead of a [ fixed mindset ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/achievement_orientation#fixed_mindset ) . 
  * could talent be relative as well ? 
  i suggest you watch some documentaries on michael jordan and how we was n't talented * at all * when he started his basketball career and interestingly how he was n't talented at all when he started his baseball career ( some fans even perceived insulting the fact that he crossed the boundaries and joined a baseball team ) . 
  i saw he got so good he was going to make it to the major league the following year if there had n't been a strike he did n't want to take part in which was against his personal values . 
  you said you 're tired ; are you sure you 're not falling prey to [ learned hopelessness ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/learned_helplessness ) ? 
  sigh ... 
  i came from a poor place , one of violence and disgrace : mos eisley . 
  i was about to join jabba when i was given the opportunity to join the ranks of the pride . 
  my whole life changed : i met a new family , i was fed , i was sheltered , i had friends and comrades , i had a purpose in my life : to bring the much needed prosperity to the galaxy . 
  i saw development in places where hope was already abandoned like the homeworld of the rodians . 
  i saw peaceful , advanced species ( refusing to have an army due to their advanced appreciation of life ) be protected by us from their enemies , allowing them to thrive . 
  i saw education being brought to the uncivilized and justice to the anarchists . 
  my lord vader and emperor palpatine ruled with benevolence but intolerance to crime , exactly how a leader should behave . 
  but the rebellion stripped us of our leaders and after a disastrous battle we failed . 
  now , in the so called `` imperial remnant '' a new breed of stormtroopers is rising : the first order . 
  although the troopers are now bolder they are nothing like we once were ; they 're quick to kill but not to care . 
  they 're strong to subdue but not to create . 
  a part of me died with the empire . 
  hahaha i do n't think you can , kid . 
  piett died decades ago by a suicide attack carried by an a-wing on the super star destroyer ( executor ) command bridge . 
  a-a-a-a-a ... 
  i , but you ... no way ... 
  i was there i saw it , the downfall of the executor . 
  how ? 
  ... [ really deep breath ] sigh ... 
  please excuse my irreverence and childlike behaviour , sir . 
  i 'm trying my best to contain the emotions of hope and relief in the presence of such a senior member -- and commander -- of our forces . 
  welcome back on board sir . 
  [ welcome back , admiral piett ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/es.starwars/images/d/d4/captain_piett.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140708165941 ) . 
  i did understand what the thread was about , that 's why the very first statement of this comment thread tree is :, 
   hmmmm ... 
  i think the bulk of your post has already been addressed but i 'll add an extra thought : we can become stuck in the relationshipzone . 
   your ex girlfriend anecdote is largely irrelevant and out of context , due to a misunderstanding somewhere down the line . 
  although rigor is important , useful and needed in certain contexts one must be careful where to demand it and when not to do so . 
  no wonder why kids nowadays ca n't initiate conversations casually after more than a decade of proverbs like `` silence is golden '' being said to them frequently . 
  loosen up a bit . 
  i 'm a man . 
  i can sing `` california girls '' and `` call me maybe '' matching the girl 's voices almost exactly . 
  i have tons of short * animation * ideas , but none of clips ... 
  hmmm ... what do you want to do ? 
  would you like to film stuff that happens in the world ( like a documentary ) or would you like to hire actors or what ? 
  because if you 'd like to produce films with acting , filming common , everyday stuff may be a great way to start . 
  are you a spanish speaker ? 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykk824m9sx8 ) is an awesome short film about the friendzone , but subtitles are only available in spanish ... 
  a note on mexican style filming : our directors ( except for del toro and cuar\u00f3n who apparently love fantasy ) usually tend to portray the hardships of the common folk in film , so they use familiar settings and familiar problems one relates to . 
  for example , if you watch the film from the link i provided the bench in the park he 's sitting in is at parque hundido in mexico city , which is landmarkish and very familiar . 
  you 're doing this on purpose , right ? 
  it 's not hard for me to show love for the people i care about : i love my friends so i display true camaraderie and stand up for them when necessary . 
  i love my parents and i spend time with them when i can , mostly with my mom : she 's an esfp and really appreciates my insights . 
  i love my sisters so i 'm naturally playful with them and i support them if they request it to me . 
  all are different types of love with different nature and levels of intensity and one that stands out is romantic love . 
  romance is ... not so well explored by me , as i 've had only one girlfriend in my life . 
  but when i was around her i showed my love to her by adopting positive changes that made me come out of my comfort zone ( now i dress better , i was very reluctant to that change ) and forced me to grow for the benefit of our relationship . 
  when i was inspired i 'd send her texts with my poetry . 
  she said they lit up her day in tough times . 
  \u266b the pleasure is to play , play as much as you can stay \u266b,
