  crazy ass bastards ... 
  i 'd say kudos for their fearlessness but ... 
  i 'd slap them in the name of their families for their recklessness .

  how about elijah 's prophecy ? 
  hurricane `` december error '' or `` fobaproa '' would make us flee like if there were no tomorrow . 
  it 's perfect that way ; no damages , no deaths . 
  just , for the love of god never name three adjacent hurricanes `` paris '' , `` britney '' and `` lindsay '' . 
  total wreckage is expected from those 3 .

  there are no opening question marks in the english language . 
  but there are in spanish . 
  sounds fair . 
  this is some gondor-tier monument . 
  i upvoted you because i think it 's interesting you brought up this testimony to get a grasp of the atrocities of mankind and how this extreme psychopathy works . 
  but not because i `` liked '' it . 
  got ta make that clear . 
  not so much to you but to myself . 
  jefferson national expansion memorial ... that 's pretty badass .

  nah , it 's not necessary , i gave up . 
  but thanks for the advice . 
  i thought we * might * need them sometime . 
  have n't you ever thought about being a star pilot ? 
  we get deployed all the time . 
  you get to travel through the galaxy . 
  ( and if you 're good , to live to tell the tale ), 
  you seriously deserve more upvotes , sir . 
  it would actually be kinda cool if abrams showed a gungan passing by and suspiciously looking to the camera for 2 seconds to hint a possible gungan/jar jar appearance and then walking away like anything happened . 
  this with the clear purpose of trolling the audience . 
  because i found it funny . 
  and i had n't read it previously . 
  why do n't you [ try this ? 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/p6lmdyk ) my alleged enfp girlfriend ( i 'm an alleged intp myself , according to the 16personalities test ) proposed this dynamic : at first we 'd both have empty containers , of the exact same size and shape , and we 'd fill them up with our poetry and mad love thoughts about each other written in colored post-its . 
  when the containers were filled we 'd give the container we filled to the other person . 
  advice : trust your * analysis skills * ( sort of anti-jedi lol ) we can be shy , and being too bold can scare us . 
  but sometimes we need our so to be bold , especially on the first move , stuff can come naturally after that . 
  my story is that of the 2 ^ nd case . 
  i heavily think i 'm an intp ( but since i have n't taken a professional mbti test , i guess i do n't really know ) here 's how my girlfriend seduced me :, 
  i found her attractive since i met her . 
  that being said she actually friend-requested me on facebook when i met her at an event and we started talking . 
  i liked her personality very much too . 
  but since i was terribly afraid of marriage and relationships and [ i had kind of this stance to love . 
  ] ( http://38.media.tumblr.com/11bfb1e23641b8f4da198649ed28080b/tumblr_inline_mi8n22ql7a1qz4rgp.jpg ) so i asked her out once ( as friends of course ) and i was wearing one of my balloon festival t-shirts and we talked about it . 
  what happens with this balloon festival is that as a crewman , you get access to a free ride on one of the days , so i remembered the words of an american pilot who i befriended : `` balloon riding is something everyone should try at least once in their lifetimes '' so , since i had already done it an i was interested in her , i invited her to attend with me . 
  ( i 'd give her my ticket that granted her the ride ), 
  so there we were and lots of trouble happened , but at the end everything went just fine . 
  we had the greatest time . 
  so being on our tent ( the festival is hosted on a large park , and you can sleep on it if you take your tent with you ) i was just about to sleep when she started kissing me everywhere on my face but carefully avoiding my lips . 
  so i open my eyes and she asks : what are you thinking about ? 
  i answer : if i kiss you or not . 
  moments later i kissed her on a long , sweet night . 
  ( first kiss at age 20 , bordering 21 ), 
  the next day was the end of the festival , and we returned to my house ( i live alone ) and we had not have a shower on the last 2 days . 
  things got intimate . 
  after fighting my mind every day for most of the 24 hours contained on each one for the span of a month , i yielded and decided to ask her if she wanted to be my girlfriend in a somewhat ritualistic way . 
  that was the start of a beautiful year-and-a-half relationship . 
  i do n't know . 
  i just found the image and posted it here , but i presume it 's a photoshopped hulk buster from avengers : age of ultron . 
  ok , ok , so who 's left ? 
  i take it as the ideal gas law . 
  can you use it carelessly and universally ? 
  is it perfectly exact ? 
  is it based in general observations about a given phenomenon ? 
  yes . 
  ( the igl , since i 'm not a psychologist myself i ca n't really tell about mbti but i 'm surprised by how the description of intp suited me ), 
  lol , we all have to experiment and discover what suits us best . 
  if i play ariana grande in my study breaks , ( i try to follow the 30 min study x 5 min rest regimen ) i 'm doomed . 
  living alone ... is hands-down, 
  ** the best . 
  ** thing . 
  ** ever ** . 
  it 's so awesome it made me wonder how did i put up with living with my family for 18 years , straight . 
  i like your perspective . 
  damn , i just realized i 'm too weird , even within the intp sphere . 
  i just ended a year-long adventure where i set off to become a pick up artist . 
  ( promiscuity , yay ! ), 
  i have to warn you , those are dark terrains for us . 
  why ?
