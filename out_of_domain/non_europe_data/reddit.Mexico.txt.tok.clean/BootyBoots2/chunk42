  did n't understand what happened until i read your comment !, 
  no need for cringing . 
  according to guy best rated on that yahoo answers question , [ there are 35 different settlements named `` springfield '' in the us ] ( https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060613205644aaajyje ) , so your line of thought is not wrong at all . 
  my dad is an airplane pilot and there was once a contraption with a flight because the boss was n't specific with his wording and wanted to go to [ toluca , illinois ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toluca,_illinois ) and they were en route to [ toluca , estado de m\u00e9xico ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/toluca+de+lerdo,+m%c3%a9x.+m%c3%a9xico/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x85cd89892a50ebb9:0xad3f4ad5550208c4?sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjl94rw3afkahxcurqkhtj1bogq8geihdaa ) . 
  ( the boss 's hangar was in mexico , not the us , so they assumed he wanted to come back ) . 
  welcome to reddit and r/intp , also thanks for sharing !, 
  i 'm bewildered by the fact you can modify the size of the font but not formatting spaces ... 
  your post would be much more attractive if you gave it proper formatting , so i suggest giving it a try !, 
  if you were on mobile while you posted this never mind , just try yo do it later on a pc/mac when you have the chance if you care about this post . 
  read you later !, 
  i 'm feeling gay too !, 
  it 's a lovely day to be colorful !, 
  it 's important you do n't let emotionally charged events like this affect you , otherwise socializing will become much more difficult . 
  it may lead to a downward spiral pf loneliness and depression amped up by the fact that people perceive and avoid depressed people , furthering his/her depression . 
  of course , this is an extreme example but it happens to more sensitive people than it meets the eye . 
  i want to believe this , i really do . 
  but if it was true he would have healed himself had he need to , found some kind of transport , rally the troops and commanded the rest of the empire ; maybe he would have even taken palpatine 's role as the second emperor . 
  but he did n't . 
  the stick !, 
  this stick !, 
  come on , you stupid piece of s # ! t. 
  gee , no wonder why you became extinct . 
  [ proceeds to be blinded and eaten by the `` stupid '' animal . ], 
  this post ... so many memories . 
  this story is yours only but we all have our individual ops . 
  thank you for sharing . 
  hi , fellow outer rimlander . 
  i wo n't lecture you on what to do with your life : it 's your choice . 
  but [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/empiredidnothingwrong/comments/3ohedg/i_am_pleased_to_serve_the_empire/ ) was the reason why i joined the ranks of the pride . 
  this is a progressive but somewhat limiting comment , in my opinion . 
  by believing that you 're dismissing every knowledge of the intangible to pursuit the tangible . 
  have n't you ever thought that perhaps the occult is actually extremely advanced science enclosed in rhetoric for the understanding of a given culture ? 
  what evidence do you have about him being an intp ? 
  could you post them for reference and validation ? 
  i second this , the fi seems strong in him . 
  true , he was so awesome he kept his clothes while all others were ... orgying . 
  since the problem is one of the mind , the solutions must mindset oriented as well . 
  there are all kinds of people out there and most of them are going to be primitive -- aka trying to exert dominance on the weak -- so you need to be aware of them ( there 's a reason why police exists in the first place ) . 
  you ca n't be liked by all anyways ; somebody will hate you for the exact same reasons others love you , and confrontation is unavoidable . 
  so if you wo n't be liked by anybody ( meaning some of them will hate you for being any way you are , including nice ; anybody \u2260 nobody ) , confrontation is a natural part of human life and you know some people are willing to diminish your life for their own profit , then why would you put up with their shit ? 
  answer : because of the self-preservation instinct . 
  evolution has made us good at surviving , so some of us will have a very developed self-preserving instinct to protect us from harm which may make us fearful and avoid risks at all costs ( this being actually dangerous on the long run ) . 
  so what to do ? 
  i 'm dealing with the same problem now , so imma lay down solutions i propose :, 
  * be quick at evaluating : is it worth risking it ? 
  lets assume you see a gang beating up a dog and animal welfare is important to you . 
  can you take up on the gang and stand for the dog ? 
  if it 's a bunch of rascal children you can do something , but if you live in central america and [ this folks ] ( http://cde.peru21.pe/ima/0/0/0/7/1/71790.jpg ) are the ones beating up the dog , you might want to reconsider if it 's worth dying for the pup . 
  if you see a smoking hot girl , your self preservation instinct may freeze you to spare rejection but if there 's no physical harm probability , what are you to lose ? 
  * clear your mind about values . 
  other than trying to preserve your life and integrity , what would you die -- or sacrifice physical integrity -- fighting for ? 
  ( tough questions ) . 
  * create an emergency plan . 
  emergency means a dire and unexpected situation that ranges from calling someone out for littering to getting your house robbed . 
  what would you do in such situations ? 
  what if it gets violent ? 
  ( of course , if it does your plans may be worth shit in the heat of the moment , but it 's great giving it a try , since we 're intps ) . 
  * realize some problems can be solved through assertive communication . 
  if you 're in the middle of a family -- the people who are supposed to love and care about you the most -- feud , perhaps things can be better solved by simply talking to them and expressing how you feel about this . 
  of course , assertive communication varies depending on the people you want to address : if you call someone out on the street you have to sound friendly , non-threatening and civil , but firm ( body language takes care of that at a certain extent ) ; you certainly ca n't be vulnerable with your feelings like you may be with your family ( although there are some really fucked up families , evaluate if being vulnerable is a viable option for you ) . 
  * become more independent ( `` powerful '' ) . 
  the more you rely on other people for your survival , the less capable you are of fending for yourself ; revert that . 
  are you so physically feeble that people abuse you on sight ? 
  put up some body mass . 
  poor ? 
  work enough to start a business and produce a surplus of money . 
  there are times when we * feel * we depend of somebody else and we put up with their shit ; it 's not true : humans are extremely resilient . 
  so be more capable physically -- this does n't necessarily mean having big/strong muscles but being effectively capable of doing harm to others so guns are an option in extreme situations -- economically , in terms of skills and education , and in general acknowledge that your freedom is inversely proportional to your needs being met or restrained at the will of other people . 
  footnotes ( footquotes ? ), 
  on taking action :, 
  * when the times comes , do n't hesitate ; just act - wolf o ' donnell . 
  * actions of confidence come first , feelings of confidence come later - dr. russ harris on his book `` the confidence gap '' . 
   i usually do n't mind doing things for others or inconveniencing myself a little . 
  careful here : some people confuse courtesy with submissiveness . 
  be civilized and courteous but do n't tolerate disrespect in any way . 
   that just seems to ramp up irritation , and i do n't know what to do with these feelings . 
  perhaps meditation can help ... 
   thanks for the comprehensive reply . 
  it was surprisingly easy to read, 
  your appreciation is the most welcome !, 
  thank god for reddit formatting . 
  to make long posts enjoyable , one should make them skippable so a certain part of the content attracts the reader ; he might as well return and read the whole thing !, 
  god fucking dammit people !, 
  even [ street fighter ] ( https://geekwisdom.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/winnersdontdodrugs.gif ) arcades knew better . 
  if you 're having such a hard time to connect with people but you desire to do it may be because of self preservation instinct and anxiety . 
  caring about others ' thoughts and feelings is feeling , not thinking , therefore not rational . 
  work on that ; some people may be extremely sensitive but if you take the same approach -- not approaching -- to all people to not inconvenience the one extremely sensitive person ( who you do n't know who he/she is ) , you 're going to be missing out on a plethora of many awesome people . 
  massively failing to connect to others may make you enter depression , so it 's paramount -- for your own welfare -- that you reach out to others . 
  it 's easy !, 
  about overthinking : your mind and your brain are awesome tools , but they can wreck you if you do n't use them properly . 
  when you 're taking pictures you 're enjoying the taking and the light and stuff but you may be analyzing the composition of the elements , frame , angles , etc. 
  ** when talking to people there 's nothing to analyze ** ( unless you 're an on-duty psychologist ) , just enjoy the interaction !, 
  taking all this in mind , if you 're still feeling anxious then shut your mind for a second ( i 'd recommend mindfulness meditation if you feel you ca n't ) and reach our to others . 
  realize that ** actions of confidence come first , feelings of confidence come later ** and put it in practice . 
  if you still feel anxious doing this , then expose yourself to gradually more challenging socializing tasks parting from a `` safe zone '' ( an interaction that 's acceptable for you , such as asking for the time ) . 
  refer to cognitive behavioral therapy . 
  if you 're still anxious then you might as well need drugs . 
  it 's okay , people 's brains are configured differently . 
  just go see a psychiatrist who knows the kind and doses of drugs you need for your treatment while you improve . 
  ground hogs ... we really do need you .
