  from time to time . 
  four year rule periods and refugee complaints ? 
  what is this , some democracy loving earthling country ? 
  this is the empire . 
  one ruler for life . 
  sadly , our leaders have been long gone , and they 're not coming back . 
  this rupture is inevitable . 
  there will be sympathizers of the first order and sympathizers of the old guard . 
  though i appreciate this kid 's ( fn-299 i believe ) effort to neutralize the rebel scum , he 's been a breath of fresh air . 
  imagine if there was a boom for every single tie heroic suicide ... 
  thankfully , i was n't seriously raised in any faith . 
  i went to catechism because my mom forced me to do something that `` needed to be done '' ( has n't gone to church in years , though ) . 
  i read the old testament on my own in a search for god . 
  became more discouraged , lol . 
  i have a copy of the quran ( not a jolly text but it 's culture at last ... ) . 
  i do have a faint belief on a single god , like the abrahamic religion preaches but i have no way to know about why he ( she ? , it ? ), 
  loves us , cares about us , etc. 
  i 'm more interested on knowing about why people go so bat-shit about such a beautiful concept . 
  stupid question ; it 's because of the archaic built-in laws they had , partially abolished by jesus and further hardened by mohamed ( does `` archaic '' stand for the arc of alliance ? 
  system to not forget things :, 
  * think about places as control volumes, 
  ** before going through any doorway think about what you 're going to do next , and what you need to perform it in the place you 're going ** . 
  * block your thoughts about anything else * . 
  e.g : i 'm having lab session at college : what do i need ? 
  * lab coat . 
  * safety boots . 
  * protective glasses . 
  * miscellaneous extra material . 
  when i 'm putting my boots on i say out loud `` i 'm wearing my boots '' , then i put the lab coat in my schoolbag and i say out loud `` i 'm carrying the lab coat '' and then `` i 'm securing the lab coat '' -- closing the zipper -- and so on with all the stuff i need * before crossing the frame of my entrance door * . 
  * be mindful of your essentials . 
  i ca n't go out without my wallet , keys and cell phone ; you must have a list of your own things you ca n't go out without carrying them . 
  so every time you think about crossing the frame of any door -- especially in transports -- ** put your hands in your pockets to make sure everything 's in place and you 're carrying everything that 's handy ** . 
  * take care of your non-essentials . 
  just like your essentials , sometimes you carry extra equipment you do n't carry every time ( sunglasses , jacket , backpack , etc ) . 
  ** make sure you 're carrying all your stuff at all times ( if your memory is faulty you can use a checklist , there must be apps for that ** , otherwise use post its or another convenient device ) . 
  by default , it 's easier to train your mind to not forget your essentials , but it 's tricky because you may not remember you had something else . 
  just a little mindfulness is necessary to improve . 
  bonus warning : if you 're tall , there will be times you have to bend your knees to sit ; when that happens it 's likely that the things you 're carrying on your pockets fall off due to gravity without notice . 
  be especially mindful if such is the case , otherwise look for another place you can secure your stuff ( bags with zippers , fanny packs ) . 
  bonus 2 : i feel you , once i had a cell phone that literally lasted less than 24 hours . 
  you kept your dignity . 
  worth more than $ 50 . 
  or not ... 
  there 's one thing that does n't make sense to me : why did the white spectrum recede on its intention to show the other black spectrum its drawing if the drawing was an orange spiral instead of an orange square ? 
  ( assuming the square is what the black spectrum did n't like ), 
  no , it 's not . 
  the infp subreddit reflects the attitude and values of its denizens , just like this one ( thus making it a good subreddit ) . 
  if you think they 're way too whiny take another look to our own sub , we whine all the time ; we 're just less outspoken about it . 
  i believe that if you wait for god/fate/the universe/the force etc. 
  to make you meet your lifetime partner it 's not gon na happen . 
  titanic-like love stories are hollywood material , not life . 
  so if you want a partner , go hunt for it . 
  changes must be made to improve while preserving one 's identity , but we should n't brush off improvements for the sake of `` keeping real '' . 
  there should be a balance . 
  i hope somebody makes a mbti relationships compatibility matchup chart like [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vnstodv.jpg ) instead of like [ this one ] ( http://i340.photobucket.com/albums/o354/misterf111/forum/typechart-bulbapediathecommunity-drivenpokeacutemonencyclopedia_zpsd77627cb.png ) . 
  more than mbti thing , i think you 've got a man-woman thing going on . 
  evaluating what you wrote , i think you are approaching too softly . 
  if you want a relationship find a suitable time ( not necessarily the `` perfect time '' just an easy time where none of you are distressed or feeling bad ) to go meet her ** and tell her you want a relationship , asap ** if that 's the case . 
  if not and you just want to be friends with this girl , that 's fine , you 're doing ok ( that 's why if you want a relationship , it 's imperative for you to change course before this girl 's brain scans you as a friend ) . 
  intps hate being expected to catch `` subtle social cues '' from other people because we 're unfit to do that , moreover it does n't make logical sense for most of us . 
  so ** be explicit with what you want ** . 
   i really like her , but i know sharing emotions with an intp can be toxic . 
  not really ; when not overloaded with overwhelming positive emotion and provided you keep negative emotions in check , positive emotions are a relief for us : they color our lives . 
   normally i would consider silence from a girl that i liked to be that she does n't like me , but with the present circumstance and the previous direction that the relationship was going in i would assume this is not the case . 
  true . 
  my enfp girlfriend was bewildered by my bad habit of not talking to her . 
  at first , i never showed tangible expressions of affection , yet i thought about her day and night . 
  worry not if she 's in love with you . 
  as a regular text wall writer i have to tell you it 's important that you break the text in pieces where the story follows-up . 
  that way is more pleasant to the eye , and easier for the brain to process the information you want to communicate . 
  also , below the lower right corner of the text box you can see the formatting help in blue ( right to the reddiquette ) . 
  follow [ this link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/comments/1vjfm9/how_do_i_insert_a_blank_line_between_2_lines_of/ ) for a tutorial on how to insert blank lines , just to make it look more appealing . 
  did you create this in your procrastination ? 
  we could use some decoration at r/intp ( which is the only mbti subreddit that is n't decorated in any way , and it 's by far the largest ) . 
  also , why did you choose the name intpcss ? 
  what does it stand for ? 
  he sounds somewhat immature . 
  yes , i did ; perhaps one of my biggest mistakes : i suspect she interpreted me adopting positive changes to help our relationship grow as submissive or unattractive . 
  needless to say she did n't change back for me . 
   p.s. 
  feels like i 'm entering a den of wolves here . 
  very logical wolves . 
  i kid you not , another female user expressed she was somewhat intimidated by the atmosphere of this subreddit , to what i replied with [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/intp/comments/3vug0g/hello_yall_i_am_an_isfj_seeking_information_on/cxqywb1?context=3 ) . 
  god dammit . 
  my dad 's an esfj and for some reason he uses hes fe the wrong way ; making obnoxious jokes that add more tension to the family ( my esfp mom and him are about to get divorced ) . 
  since i 'm so sensitive to discussion and unrest ( something i definitely have to work with ) , i really have a hard time connecting with him . 
  he also has a habit of asking for help to me while pressuring me if i do n't do things * his way * ( why 're you asking for help if you can do it yourself ? 
  i do n't really get what 's the scary part of us/this sub . 
  it 's not like we 're waiting to jump over somebody that does n't use perfect logic or attack anybody that does n't share the hive mind -- like it happens on r/theredpill -- there are recurrent threads about dating and vents about procrastination and the like . 
  though most of them were answered politely and precisely . 
  i 'm fascinated by the perception of us being wolves . 
  ** edit : ** giving it a second thought , feelers are tastier meat than observant ( s ) people ; and our diet comprises mostly of sentinels : estj 's being the premium , high protein meat and therefore our preferred choice for hunting . 
  esfj 's are seasoned , more delicious meat we eat in * other ways * ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) ( they make up for great couples according to some folks ) . 
  istps would be like panthers or something ; predators of a different kind . 
  according to me , cognitive dissonance are errors or biases , such as mind reading , catastrophizing , fortune telling , amongst others . 
  are we talking about the same thing or are you referring to something else ? 
  i see , i confused cognitive dissonance with [ cognitive distortions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cognitive_distortion ) . 
  male intp here :, 
   how he logically uses extraverted feeling, 
  unless you want to waste time and emotional resources , you do n't want to replace fe with ti .
