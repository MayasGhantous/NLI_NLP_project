  every function has its use and we should strive to develop them all . 
  why not ? 
  you may ask ; because it 's simply not designed for it , and * feelings are usually not logically consistent * , so analyzing feelings wo n't get you anywhere . 
  feelings may be approached as another kind of language that has a structure of its own : a language of * intentions * that resonates or becomes dissonant with the values of oneself , this is meta-communicated to people by non-verbal ways , that 's why the logical structure of written/spoken language is often unfit to express feelings ; it 's simply a `` not supported platform '' . 
  e.g : you go out `` dressed to kill '' for a ladies night with your friends . 
  * you always provoke emotions in other people * , so what emotion will you provoke , what will you communicate ? 
  this particular scenario may tell people a variety of things to different people , ranging from `` i 'm available ! '', 
  and `` i 'm beautiful ! '', 
  to `` i 'm horny '' amongst others . 
  `` half the money i spend on advertising is wasted ; the trouble is i do n't know which half '' - john wanamaker . 
  it 's hard to know which specific actions sub-communicate intentions , but since you 're a woman , perhaps it 's easier for you to know the intentions and predict the behavior of people by noticing cues from unrelated actions , attitudes , body language , outfits , manners and others . 
  achieving this needs fe , and sadly , it appears the only way to develop it is by exposure , trial and error and practice ; no way around it . 
  i think i get the intimidating part now : being theorists we use the ti-ne wombo combo to dissect things , and actually the reason why this sub is so active is because we * want * our intpeers to analyze and assess our problems so we can have * another fresh point of view * to integrate to our main theory of the current event of interest . 
  so , for most of us ( you 'll notice some of them are shy and occasionally some of them delete their posts ) , feedback is * nurturing * as opposed to `` divide and conquer '' -- which we 're totally capable of doing if we need to -- but you 'd have to be a legit asshole persistent on your assholery to make us reach that point , or the intp would need to be a legit asshole , which is uncommon but possible . 
  for the sake of reddit , intp assholes simply get downvoted to oblivion , and the loud people get their points painstakingly dissected ( the action other people get intimidated by ) . 
   fire it up . 
  now , that 's a cool s catchphrase ... 
  it 's easy for me to empathize with feelers -- though i absolutely love and feel grateful for being in the t team -- because our dominant functions can sometimes be too aggressive , preventing other functions to take charge and make your life easier for oneself . 
  ti is a very low energy , maximum efficiency resource for us and we tend to see the world in terms of it , feelers tend to see the world in therms of fi or fe ; it 's their trump card , and it 's gotten them out of trouble many times , so it 's understandable they trust their feels like we trust our thoughts . 
  finding a logical reason behind feelings sounds like an academic endeavor to me : it has value as a decoration at the palace of athena but lacks it anywhere else . 
  feelings are to be felt . 
  after we 've been exposed to feelings enough we 'll be able to speak the language . 
  if the stricken words are to semi-censor aggressiveness , you need to change your definition of aggressiveness ... 
  nope ... borbons are the monarchs now . 
  but you can think the blood of ancient kings runs trough your veins .

  just for the record , this is the comment that deserved today 's guildling . 
  so when you triumphantly return to spain to claim what 's rightfully yours , make sure to stop by the spanish [ shire ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wznlv41fol0 ) . 
  you 're too sexy for yourself ... 
  are you a man or a woman ? 
  edit : stupid question . 
  of course the answer is woman . 
   i hope my mention of shikamaru in another thread did n't trigger this . 
  i was hesitant to even mention naruto because i knew a lot of people looked down on it, 
  meh . . the worst case scenario is people downvoting me . 
  it happens even in reasonable posts . 
  besides , take a look at the most upvoted posts : they 're webcomics appealing to intp stereotypes ... point is , i would n't mind about r/intp 's opinions very much . 
  i love-hate naruto . 
  it 's an awesome anime ( never read the manga ) in my opinion ; and tobi is my favorite villain ever : that 's why i hate the way kishi turned him into a sensitive prick ( he was the one who turned the good guys into hopeless bastards ) . 
   they 're not always going to adhere to a certain personality type because it 's impossible for them to follow a certain function stack when it 's artificially a mindset created by someone else . 
  true . 
  i still think one could try to get a -- subjectively -- considerable amount of material from a series and try to type the character for fun . 
  yes , i do know who he is . 
  yet still i 'm being civilized and trying not to spoil stuff ( as far as i 've tried , reddit 's spoiler formatting is broken ) . 
  besides , he was awesome until the moment he took the mask off . 
  then he became his lame old self . 
  so tobi he is . 
  major energy turnaround from fossil and coal fuel . 
  it 's going to become a biiiiiiig industry , a guy with the right acquaintances and a keen eye for business may become the next great player in the energy industry . 
  i would n't run the underworld . 
  i 'd run a plan to destroy the humankind . 
  apologizing policy :, 
  if you feel you really wronged that person , meet him/her and , rather than continuously and profusely , apologize once and in the most sincere and heartfelt way . 
  it 's important to `` watch '' what you 're saying because it 's hard to back down , but once you do it , you ca n't undo what you did , so in order to protect your mental health i suggest you stop thinking about this , because you will cringe if you do n't ( this is a natural thing but some types have it more than others ) . 
  lol infj 's are the rarest , according to 16personalities they do n't even comprise the 1 % ( and apparently , they love us ) . 
  i felt the same way when i discovered this sub . 
  i * really * have to emphasize u/lagover 's comment : ** do n't become the intp stereotype ** . 
  embrace your outliers and take advantage of them . 
  you 'll also find that this sub is quite depressing at times , there are people who discovered the sub at a difficult time of their lives and have deep issues mostly regarding hardcore procrastination and extremely scarce human connection . 
  try not to get dragged down if you 're sensitive . 
  ** edit ** : i forgot about it ; this sub * loves * drugs . 
  please educate yourself about them before you try anything -- i do n't have to remind you of this , but ... basic civility -- and be mindful that any pleasurable action may become addictive , and even non-addictive drugs -- the ones that do n't contain alkaloids like cocaine or other `` hard drugs '' -- may become addictive if you let them . 
  other than that experiment at your leisure . 
  esfjs are supposed to love us as well ... flaired xnfps also show quite a bit of appreciation to us , so i 've seen . 
  so be it . 
  welcome to the bane train !, 
  now , that 's a truly special snowflake . 
  very interesting article . 
  i 'd like to read more about it with practical examples of sociopaths using clueless people as an escape goat . 
  i feel the need for more confirmation to validate this model but so far it seems consistent with other material i 've read . 
  ** edit : ** i used the example of power plays but it extends to many other areas such as dating . 
  for me , intelligence is the ease of learning . 
  the faster/easier you learn , the more intelligent you are . 
  mental agility does play a part on it ( as being `` wake up '' intellectually makes it easier to discern patterns ) but i would n't say an aspect of intelligence is mental agility , as there are amazing , sluggish learners . 
  or is it ? 
  are there recorded examples of geniuses that tripped over at talking or computing ? 
  gauss for example , was incredibly fast at computing ( he boasted he could compute faster than he could talk ) . 
  [ dubya plz ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wnvz2otkfu#t=2m3s ), 
  could you elaborate ? 
  * do you heavily admire other qualities besides his intelligence ? 
  * do you feel better or even blissful/very happy when you 're at his side even if you 're not talking insightful conversations ? 
  * do you feel you 'll hardly ever encounter other person like him and you 'd miss him terribly if you took separate ways ? 
  * do you feel jealous if you see him talking to other girls the way he talks to you ? 
  casually touch is arm and explore how you feel . 
  did you feel pleasure ? 
  if many of this answers are `` no '' perhaps he 's just a friend you admire a lot and a breath of fresh air in your life . 
  otherwise consider the possibility of you having a crush on him . 
  the thing with names is that i * know * the person 's name . 
  but i forget about it and then casually remember it in 3 hours or longer when it 's not needed anymore . 
  i read napoleon could remember all of his soldier 's first names , so did roosevelt with his working white house staff ( so the legend goes , but i think it 's possible ) . 
  have you ever played nintendo 's brain age ? 
  there 's a game that involves quick , simple arithmetical calculations like 9-7 and you have to perform them as fast as possible . 
  i do n't think feelings are involved in them , decisions , however may be approached as `` gut feelings '' . 
  i see . 
  you 've mentioned past bad relationships twice . 
  my `` gut feeling '' tells me you 're probably not unemotional or lust-less ( though perhaps have low sex drive but not asexual per se ) , but you 're recovering from the person who wronged you a while ago . 
  because of foul experiences , now you have a great opportunity you can capitalize on : do n't look to fit labels and boxes . 
  just let yourself go and treasure the feelings that pop when you 're around him . 
  maybe he triggers your romantic/sexual instinct and you give it a go with him . 
  you may also be unknowingly highly demanding in the sense you wo n't feel attracted to any man who does n't comply with your expectations for a couple .
