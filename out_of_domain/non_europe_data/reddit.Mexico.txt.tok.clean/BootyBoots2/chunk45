  just go outside and enjoy life , if you feel like kissing him , kiss him . 
  do whatever that makes you feel intensely alive . 
  i know what you 're talking about ; and yes , that does happen often , but there are times when it 's plain brain sleepiness . 
  seriously , man ; you ai n't getting those 100,000 pieces of pussy with dat mindset ... 
  stop thinking , complaining and mourning and clean something , start a new project or simply discover what you actually like , then do it . 
  well , i 've just read it . 
  it says you should approach women you like and interact with them . 
  you can star by asking for the time and moving on . 
  of course , this is only to give your brain a head start . 
  once you grow accustomed to ask for the time to hot women you may approach them like him , by saying hi and your name . 
  start to small talk an either progress with her or leave . 
  if action is everything , then mindset is more than everything . 
  actions are favored or turned down from mindset . 
   i do n't really want to be associated with most of the fanbase . 
  like what you like and do n't be afraid to show it . 
  people will talk shit anyways ... 
   i have n't gotten far , though , still on the 3rd season of the first series . 
  child naruto 's load of filler is pretty much the last 80 or so episodes with the very last 3 or 4 being important . 
  get the list , just so you 're not discouraged by it . 
  shippuden has like 200 evenly distributed episodes of filler so you really have to get the list lol . 
   it 's just difficult for me personally realizing that they can do contradictory things , especially as the characters develop, 
  oh boy ... naruto and especially shippuden has a crap load of logical inconsistencies . 
  they 're so inconsistent that they define what 's possible and what 's not and then break that rule with something -- technique , hidden power , stroke of genius or plain feelings -- they pull off their ass . 
  if you can put up with that , cool !, 
  it 's a very enjoyable series . 
  god , the guard on the left is beautiful . 
  as a regular text wall writer i have to tell you it 's important that you break the text in pieces where the story follows-up . 
  that way is more pleasant to the eye , and easier for the brain to process the information you want to communicate . 
  also , below the lower right corner of the text box you can see the formatting help in blue ( right to the reddiquette ) . 
  follow [ this link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/comments/1vjfm9/how_do_i_insert_a_blank_line_between_2_lines_of/ ) for a tutorial on how to insert blank lines , just to make it look more appealing . 
  most of us value freedom above all . 
  most likely ** you 're such a central part of his life he does n't want to stop pursuing his dreams , but he wo n't give up on you either ** ; maybe he 's afraid to fail you , as he 's not sufficiently confident on himself . 
  trust me , he must be banging his head on a wall for doing this , as it 's not logically consistent ; and we do not tolerate logical inconsistencies . 
  ** arrange a meeting and tell him how you feel in an assertive but explicit way ** . 
  the picture you 're painting does not seem that of a normal intp , but someone who has a severe anxiety case ( it 's ok , but it has to be taken care of with therapy or something ) . 
  so , prepare this meeting in such a way he can be as relaxed as possible , no worries whatsoever , do n't wear anything too sexy -- that could scare him off -- and tell him exacly how you feel . 
  tell him you want to become his couple and you do n't expect him to marry you ( unless you do . 
  i do n't want to fuck this guy up but if you want to get married you should look for another person ) . 
  fe is a challenge to us because we have to learn how to look beyond the meaning of words and go what actions and meanings behind them to have a clear idea of what people want ( especially girls e.g : i was talking to a girl i liked at a party and we got on really well ; she placed her thigh over mine and i did n't kiss her , fml ) . 
  so then again , be explicit but not overburdening . 
  as a last note , some of us are very sensitive to cringing and emotion so cringing -- negative emotion -- may haunt us for years or decades if we humiliate ourselves ( this can become intense ) . 
  on other hand , our `` container '' for joy could be overwhelmed and we 'd suddenly want to break off of the ecstasy ( weird as it is ) . 
  highly developed ni ? 
  this ... 
  so much freaking this . 
  do you want a really bad piece of reddit advice ? 
  plan how to `` steal her '' for the night and have an amazing night . 
  face consequences later . 
  she 'll probably get crushed ( romantically ) on you , as this action comunicates you value her enough to take such risks , also that you get ehat you want ( her ) and that you 're fearless and fierce . 
  is it kidnapping if the girls consents it ? 
  no , the scenario i was talking about was him `` stealing her '' for the prom and having an amazing night together -- as presumably she wants to be with him -- so there 's consent on her part but not her mom 's . 
  there is an actual downside of trying too hard for too long and not being able to achieve : learned helplessness ; there comes a point where you just think it 's impossible for you to achieve anything and you give up when you were almost there , this condition is not obvious , if it was n't for the internet i might have committed suicide already . 
  as a male , trying too hard becomes obvious to girls and it 's definitely a turn off : combine it with the learned helplessness and you have a complete bomb . 
  of course , you have to actually try if you want anything but it 's a little bit like fighting oneself ... 
  manual because you feel when you have to change gears and you do it . 
  in order to drive auto you have to know how to drive auto , otherwise you 'll wreck the gearbox and they 're very expensive . 
  the retailer also told me it 's much easier to sell your manual afterwards , and it 's less likely for an auto to malfunction than a standard . 
  because of this `` romeo and juliet '' clause a guy who 's say , 16 can have sex with a girl age 13 or even 12 ? 
  damn ... 
  nowadays there 's an uproar for everything in the so-called 1 ^ st world . 
  i think it 's as unethical as grabbing fruit from a tree . 
  whales have many uses , i believe . 
  and i think it 's preferable for people to give a good use to an already dead animal than doing the japanese `` research '' for fancy sushi . 
  purely emotional , i 'd say . 
  immigration , for example is an organizational topic of public interest . 
  yet it has turned into a highly emotional one . 
  emotions everywhere , damn it .

   english is not my first language , and i 'm trying to improve my english , sorry for the grammatical mistakes, 
  i 'm not a native speaker/writer of english , but yours is quite understandable . 
  ironically though , the people who have the worst grammar never apologize for it . 
  really ? 
  well , dammed be i hehe . 
  i referred to the fact that there 's a certain care you must take when driving automatic ; otherwise , the gearbox will malfunction . 
  pay attention to u/lamiyers 's comment . 
  the difference between intp 's and istps is that we have ne as our secondary and istps have se as their secondary . 
  perhaps both your se and ne are both very developed . 
  take the test : my guess is your se is slightly better developed than your ne . 
  i 'll have to believe in you because i do n't actually know much of car mechanics , i 'm repeating stuff like a parrot at this point . 
  the whole world can thank him , as we do n't need to use a complicated system of cases that makes russians look like linguistic sissies . 
   latin is what 's called a `` dead language '' . 
  after the fall of the glorious roman ~ ~ empire ~ ~ republic . 
  fify . 
  ** edit : ** true , latin died with the empire . 
  but the glory fell with the republic . 
  yes it is . 
  when in high and middle school the stress was social rather than academical . 
  in college is the other way around . 
  i demand a compatibility chart that looks like [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vnstodv.jpg ) . 
  yes it is . 
  they get much more pleasure from stroking the headtails than from stroking the ... crotch . 
  twi ` lek anatomy is very similar to that of humans . 
  it was a moment of weakness . 
  i am ashamed of my behaviour . 
  yet still , its a memory i 'll forever treasure fondly . 
  she was a slave . 
  after we raided the slavers ' ships on imperial command as a freedom operation we were commanded to take care of the remaining twi ` leks and repatriate them to their homeworld . 
  most of them were sex workers , one of them was ... 
  grateful , and ... lustful ( it 's hard for me to write this , ok ? ) .
