  dominant ni sounds perfect for the job , i guess . 
  so you analyze it ... well , logic does n't equal science and it 's very hard if not impossible to be accurate on your assertions based on plain logic because sometimes we lack the correct knowledge . 
  moreover , psychology is not an exact science : two people can demonstrate the same attitudes or behavior and be using different cognitive functions . 
  provide examples of good editing and suggestions for improvement if you 're so concerned ; one gets the most of people when being supportive . 
  i went through your history and saw [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/43gh2t/intp_on_infjs/ ) . 
  first of all , i 'll say i 'm just expressing my opinion about your writing style with the hope that maybe you can benefit from it . 
  ** the best communication is the one where you convey the message the best/clearest/most accurately using the fewest words ** . 
  under that scope i noticed this particular post was quite confusing because even with the tl ; drs at the end of each section -- pretty good tactic if you ask me -- the message is still not clear at the end of the paragraph : this makes reader be even more tired by your long posts , as long posts are tiring to look at themselves ( i 'm telling you this becuase i really like writing long posts ) . 
  let 's check the first bullet point of your actual comment :, 
   i 'm hyper critical about myself , to the point where i factor in the `` quantum mechanics level of insane logic '' that feelings produce into my logical conclusions . 
  what are you trying to communicate ? 
  * are you boasting about your capacity for logic ? 
  * are you aware that you feel your logic is superior and therefore you try to contain that feeling so it does n't affect the objectivity of your analyses ? 
  * other ? 
  i do n't intend that you answer this questions , just notice things you can change in your writing style . 
  then you wrote this :, 
   in a way , it 's very entp . 
  but every time i try to explain my intentions / motivations , it 's always met with `` no !!, 
  i know you just hate us !!! '', 
  please be careful with your wording : when you said `` it 's very entp '' it comes off as if you 're implying that the negative statements you just said on the paragraph above -- or the statement next to it , and both of them are negative -- are inherently true for entps , which must be false as there must be at least one entp who wo n't disqualify you automatically for thinking you hate them or fail to see the good intentions of trying to refine the best data for the next discussion . 
  writing tips, 
  * avoid stating negative generalizations about people, 
  ** if you need to support an hypothesis ** -- not theory , as theories must either based or ratified on hard evidence to be approved as scientific knowledge which ca n't be acquired by simple logic/philosophy , no matter how good it is -- then ** disclaim yourself by saying this does n't apply to all people ** , but you have observed it multiple times , and also ** provide reliable sources to substantiate your claim **, 
  * avoid odd wording like `` quantum mechanics level of insane logic '', 
  because it 's confusing and does n't really convey anything so you can be writing a lot and not saying anything ( this is a deal breaker for long posts ) . 
  * use formatting to your advantage . 
  i know it 's difficult to write succinctly while analyzing posts and behaviors so use formatting to your advantage ( formatting is pretty much the `` body language '' of text walls ) : some people have told me my posts are easy to read , and i think this is because ** i use breaks to group the main idea of a series of paragraphs and i also make posts `` skippable '' by using bold and drawing attention to main ideas ** . 
  they 'll probably skim through the bold text , get curious and read the whole text . 
  * use italics rather than capitals to emphasize . 
  * you 'll look elegant * , not shouting like a 5 yr old seeking for attention . 
   are you serious ? 
  there 's no way i can teach this guy to write in a reddit comment . 
  it 's bewildering for me that you just replied this , because telling him how to improve his writing [ is exactly what i just did ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/intp/comments/43ia0f/do_you_feel_youre_a_largely_misunderstood_person/czjsb4l?context=3 ) . 
  ok , i understood from this reply that you actually crafted your writing style as we see it to project your negative feelings -- confusion , anger , hopelessness -- outwardly , rather than to clearly contribute something to the discussion . 
  you 're also not interested on changing your formatting to allow people to get more and better insights -- because it looks good enough for you -- with your contribution , so it 's more like venting, 
  am i right ? 
  then you 're talking about checking periodically , which is ok . 
  still , i was curious about `` rationality '' understood as objectiveness . 
  i think its curious that you got jaded instead of more eager to meet people , as most likely you developed fe over the years . 
  that 'd be intelligence ... 
  i spoke to him . 
  he told me this was indeed a venting post . 
  god dammit haha . 
  on the sunny side i now have a handy piece of formatting advice i can simply link to . 
  did you noticed that with your fe ? 
  also , which enneagram type are you ? 
  i 'm supposed to be 5w4 . 
  yeah , i was talking about functions . 
  if there is a function that i struggle defining , that 's ni . 
  how would you define it , being your dominant ? 
  i get you . 
  but that 's pretty much the standard way for a reason . 
  most people are unable to trust a stranger while skipping the smalltalk . 
  if it was n't obvious , intp lol . 
  i got here because of following aurorus on our subreddit . 
  i see !, 
  r/intp has lots of dae posts . 
  sometimes we get two of the exact same topic in a few hours ' time . 
  we are supposed to be the pinnacle of system craft logic . 
  and i thought i wrote thorough text walls . 
  i ca n't write shit compared to you . 
  moreover you provided an awesome methodology that 's most likely scientifically accurate ( i 'll believe you , i 'm simply not so eager to dig enough to prove it right or wrong and i 'm an intp ) how long did it take you to write this ? 
  20-25 hours between writing , formatting , fact checking , grammar checking , spelling checking and general re-checks for the 3 pieces ? 
  i have n't finished reading your guide -- though i certainly will -- but my super intuition tells me you 're an intp . 
  correct ? 
  obligatory props for the time and effort poured in this text , great display of knowledge , domain of reddit formatting and general editing . 
  way to go . 
  if i cared about gildlings , this would be it for me . 
  consider , if you may , this comment as the equivalent of a white star on a yellow medal . 
  hmmm ... nidoms and tidoms are much alike . 
  so i assume you crafted this through internal connections oriented hopefully oriented towards better interactions towards people instead of system crafting ? 
  you wan na be intp ? 
  because this is how you become intp . 
  lol . 
  imma cross-post this gem to my subreddit . 
  thorough , efficient , well explained , well formatted ... fine . 
  by the way , is this info your own synthesis of jung 's work or is this an arrangement of a collection of methods you found or what ? 
  the posts 1 & 2 are linked to one another . 
  the link to part 3 is [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/43sks2/typing_for_beginners_part_3_typing_triangulation/ ) . 
  if you notice , in terms of objective goals and processes , this was a completely unnecessary gesture . 
  his verbalization of the subtext in his non-verbal communication ( gesture ) should have been something like :, 
  `` hey !, 
  i got halo 5 !, 
  this is a source of happiness/feel good for me and i wish to connect with you emotionally by sharing you this !, 
  bonding is a two sided rope , want to pull the other way ? '', 
  a way you could have pulled the other way of the rope was saying : cool !, 
  this must be a awesome game , wan na test the game mechanics ? 
  if you do n't have that much time or you 're not so interested just play a 5 minute round with him , that gesture says much more than a simple sentence , it communicates : `` i do n't care about the game itself very much , but i do like your enthusiasm because you 're important to me '' . 
  the downside is that by turning him down most people -- including him -- could have interpreted : `` you do n't care or even pretend to care about my game , which is important to me , therefore i 'm not important to you '' . 
  agreed . 
  if you need air support/air raids , contact me . 
  i 'm not qualified to do medevacs , extractions or bombing runs but i know very capable people who are . 
  both xnfjs and isfjs . 
  infjs loved the joke , apparently . 
  [ to ask how do we become humans , is to ask how leaves fall ... 
  it is in their nature . 
  perhaps there is a better question ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvyxoyxlv64#t=0m13s ) [ * wind softly caresses your face and you close your eyes as it scrambles your long hair * ], 
  you are already a human , and a sensitive one ; with desires , passions and fears , even if their not anything alike the society that surrounds you . 
  and that is not bad at all : being different is what makes you special and interesting . 
  you will pursue the activities that make you release endorphins and they can be about * consuming others ' productions * ( movies , songs , food other people prepare , etc. ),
