  or you can do activities that * produce that on your own * ( doing a fulfilling job , taking care of children , drawing , singing ; doing stuff * other people enjoy * ) . 
  the former is just a temporary patch , the latter is a positive way of living . 
  have a purpose in life , new goals , enjoy the company of your friends and loved ones , follow your faith if you have one , give yourself some time to contemplate nature or our environment and enjoy it , ** meet new people and genuinely care about them , share your feelings and connect to them , rekindle the flame for old friends and family ** . 
  how do we become humans ? 
  we already are , we are a cluster of passions and emotions we can not escape from . 
  for our kind , the true question is : how do we live our lives to the fullest ? 
  thank him/her in the original !, 
  well , just narrow down stuff . 
  for example , my current fetish is to look for heart-shaped butts . 
  so i look at tumblrs of that if i 'm fancying images at the time . 
  sometimes i fancy a pornstar or a certain style of filming . 
  besides , you really do n't take much time to jack off ... and you can always use your imagination ; o do n't stop working that off either . 
  i took it as a joke ... 
  probably the differences in perception marked whether if it was downvoted or not . 
   we 've known each other for about 4 months now over the internet . 
  have you had face-to-face contact yet ? 
  the normal human courthsip ritual requires :, 
  * eye contact . 
  * smiling . 
  * preening -- body language courtship signals , usually female --, 
  * talk . 
  * physical touch . 
  if you see each other through webcams , up to 4 of these can be satisfied , but not all of them ; if not , only one can be satisfied !, 
  1 ) how long has she been aware of your feelings ? 
  i 'd advocate for you being patient , but if it 's been 6 months since that happened then she 's probably made the decision to friendzone you ( which is impossible because you 've only known her for 4 months ; i 'm just laying the example ) . 
  2 ) ** when flirting , the risk of scaring her off is unavoidable ** ; actually if you do n't take risks you 'll be friendzoned for sure . 
  my interpretation mark manson 's definition of flirting , conceptually validated by the book `` the machiavelian 's guide for flirting both men and women '' -- colorful name , is n't it ? -- and successfully tested by me is : ** flirting consists in playfully risking the rapport you have already built with her through words ** . 
  leading consists in playfully risking the rapport you have already built with her through actions . 
  example of flirting ( after you 've already built some rapport on the actual conversation ) :, 
  * you : your black hair looks incredible today !, 
  * her : thanks !, 
  i really do take care of it . 
  * you : too bad i 'm only into blondes ( say this while you lean forward to her and touch her arm or just a little above her knee ), 
  subtext translation :, 
  * you : you 're attractive to me . 
  * her : i know , and i like you being attracted to me . 
  * you : but if you do n't respond to me the way i want , i 'll leave you for other girl , probably more attractive than you are , so make a choice . 
  leading is a more powerful version of flirting , as it communicates the same thing using actions instead of words . 
  you could make her your accomplice in something that is `` just a bit illegal '' like pranking a common `` enemy '' or smuggling candies into a cinema . 
  in summary , ** you must take risks ** . 
  3 ) yes ... once a woman makes the association of being friends , you 're in the friendzone and even though some dating counselors do have expanded on ways to get out ; all of them coincide in the fact that it 's very difficult to do so . 
  4 ) gather epic levels of courage and say it ; progressively touching and letting other people touch us . 
  certainly something that requires tons of confidence in the other person . 
  i 'm positive to say that intp is the type that struggles with dating the most as it 's difficult for most of us to date and be dated . 
  i noticed you have a desire to heal her and show her how you can make her happy . 
  that 's not a good signal . 
  as sansa stark thought once , ** compassion kills passion ** ; at least on the woman 's end . 
  i wrote the flirting part having in mind that she is a woman . 
  now , her hard intp personalty does interfere with that to an extent i do n't know . 
  mind you : what is needed to flirt normally with other women may be too overbearing for an intp , more so if she 's anxious or damaged by previous relationships . 
  bring that fe up and sense what 's happening wether you build up or break rapport , and how aggresive are you is up to you . 
  good luck . 
  edit : forgot a warning ; ** flirting is based on the concept that you can not be more emotionally invested than she is into you ** . 
  because if you are then she can dump you whenever she wants , as you 're available for her whenever she wants . 
  ** you can not fake `` un-investedness '' as women are extremely receptive to this ** , so you have to work on your feelings to project the right vibe . 
  my response to your leaving would be to shrug your rejection and look for another girl . 
  too bad , would 've been a fun ride . 
  i do n't even know what negging is , but i 've read about women aversion to it ; as they think the purpose is to make them insecure . 
  in my case at least is not ; it 's to playfully have fun . 
  in the book i cited they mention tricks to banter men by teasing their masculinity , which could be hurtful if the man is insecure about himself , and there 's no way to know if a person is insecure or not unless you ... well , unless you do banter with them and see what happens . 
   if you 're any type of authority on dating as you purport yourself to be, 
  no i do n't intend to advertise myself as such , i 'm just condensing a shit ton of pages about the subject through my own words and understanding of the underlying concepts in a way that is hopefully useful to him . 
   stop stringing op along and giving him false hope . 
  op is a ken doll to her . 
  and if a ken doll tried this risky business on me i 'd smack the shit out of that neutered magpie . 
  when reading about pua/seduction/self growth , the theory does narrow to a certain point to claim that the principles apply to all women at their core . 
  this becomes blurry because ** women are extremely different between one another : that 's the reason why there 's no universal technique that works on all women ** and why one may not be the man for a specific women ( but still because of the same thing there could be many compatible women out there for said man ! ) . 
  the point with all this is that if there is a group that is apparently extremely different to the theoretical , nonexistent , conceptual , faceless woman that dating principles are 100 % effective on , that would be the shy , anxious , ** intp girls may work the exact opposite way than puas think ** and therefore being the supportive , nice , dragon-slaying , i 'd - do-anything-for-you disney prince charming might as well do in this particular situation . 
  ** that 's why i think * maybe * there 's a hope for a 4 month old relationship ** . 
  intp husbands here on this sub report marrying their best friend . 
  but i 'm talking from the point of theoretical uncertainty , maybe i 'm wronging him with my best intentions . 
  comparing sources , everything points to the fact that attraction is `` immediate '' -- she makes the decision of wanting to have sex with you or consider you a suitable mate for a relationship -- within the first 20 hours of meeting her ( maybe even less ) . 
  so , when i wrote this i took in the fact that she is a * woman * and like all women she has a reptilian brain ( like we men do ; although ours works different ) that works in a certain way and gets aroused in a certain fashion . 
  according to your story everything points painfully in the direction of a snape-grade friendzone . 
  not pretty . 
  but ... 
   i have n't committed much ( emotionally ) to our friendship yet so losing the prospect of having her a romantic partner will not affect me much . 
  sounds fine and dandy to me . 
  you want to establish an emotional connection with her so go for it . 
  ** just keep your expectations in check ** , emotional breakdowns arise from unmet expectations . 
  by the way ; i 'm saying this last part in care for you . 
   she basically sees no value in having friends in real life . 
  bruhhh ... and you want to become her truest friend ? 
   this is because i can say without exaggeration that she 's probably the most unfortunate person i 've ever met in my life . 
  she is a very damaged person . 
  i wo n't give specifics out of respect for her privacy , but her social anxiety is crippling . 
  i repeat ; compassion kills passion . 
  she wo n't reward your efforts and desire to help her grow with her love : it would be awesome if it worked that way but it does n't . 
  true attraction , love and sexual desire are all fires that light when certain circumstances and features are met . 
   if you disagree , then you can ignore the rest of the post and tell me right away that i 'm delusional enough to believe so . 
  well , i do disagree with your methodology and i would save you time , money , effort and emotional pain , but then again there are married intps who married their friends . 
  we.are.weird . 
  that 's why i wo n't dismiss you . 
  now , i 'd like you to keep a detailed journal of your journey . 
  if you get friendzoned , well there goes another one : at least you had the guts to try . 
  but if you do succeed , please give us the detailed feedback , much refinement can be done with this useful information . 
  edit : why do n't you make a timetable ? 
  plan your moves ahead and set goals , give yourself a deadline and strive to accomplish your goals on it . 
  if you do n't achieve your goals , leave it for good . 
  ** girls are not stupid , and they are n't angels either .
