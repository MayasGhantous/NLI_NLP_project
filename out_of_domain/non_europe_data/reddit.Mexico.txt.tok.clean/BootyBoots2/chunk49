  some ** of them friendzone guys because they care about their feelings so they do n't crush them with rejection but others ** will keep you around for narcissistic validation ** . 
  be mindful . 
  the wording has to be playful , the subtext does n't . 
  if you rescue somebody from a burning building the subtext is `` i care enough about you to risk my life and integrity for you '' ; nothing playful about it . 
  noble , but serious . 
  if you approach a hot girl out of the blue for no apparent reason other than talking the subtext is : `` you are sexually attractive , i want to mate with you , but first i need you to trust me so we can go on with this . 
  wan na hop on the train ? '', 
  allows for a ton of fun in the future , but the subtext itself is not fun at all ; it does n't have to be . 
  are you a man ? 
  watch mr. bean and feel better . 
  are you a woman ? 
  watch bridget jones and feel better . 
  `` common sense '' is a very vague term that usually means being perceptive to the world that surrounds you ( se ) and to the people who surrounds you ( fe ) . 
  functions that are dominant found in abundant , hence common types . 
  intps are * un * common . 
  there are rich people with amazing partners , beautiful children , family and people who love them and in short , `` perfect lives '' . 
  yet they still feel miserable and dead inside , and they may be ending up committing suicide . 
  there 's a valuable lesson we can learn from them : happiness comes from the inside , and it 's different for all of us , so you 'll have to find it on your own . 
   perhaps that 's what i really wanted to ask right from the start . 
  how do we live our lives to the fullest , without feeling like we 've had to give up almost our entire individuality ? 
  by actually living your individuality . 
  you do n't have to sacrifice any of it ; it 's pretty much the other way around : by * highlighting * your individuality you 'll be able to enjoy yourself the most . 
  do what you want in your life for yourself ; help others without sacrificing an ounce of your essence , if happiness is what you seek . 
  are you a man or a woman ? 
  if you are a man or a woman who does n't care much about her feminine figure you 'll want to have broader shoulders and big arms . 
  most likely he noticed your fear and decided to have fun on it . 
  you should * feel * like you 're not going to take shit from him and do resort to violence if you need to ( even if you do n't actually get to it ) . 
  our insides can be easily projected outwardly and intense feeling can be noticed by even the most insensitive people . 
  in your life , there * will * be confrontations . 
  people try to take advantage on others all the time , that 's why the police and lawyers are necessary in the first place . 
  moreover there are psychopaths and sociopaths on the loose ; and there 's no way to know who 's who . 
  now , you may not want to take advantage on others but you will need to confront to * prevent * others from taking advantage of you . 
  this was a very obvious example but life is full of more subtle ones : from the guy who does n't respect a cue to somebody who cons people or the rich man who builds a monopoly . 
  be ready to confront people . 
  ** edit ** : if you 're fearful , worry not ; it 's not cowardice , its a natural high self preserving instinct -- good for keeping alive ! -- so do n't beat yourself to it . 
  people like the thug you mentioned wo n't thread upon people who do n't care about their lives because it 's not worth it ( physical risk vs. pleasure obtained from pranking ; physical risk is too high to make up for the pleasure , in your case it was the exact opposite ) . 
  when an animal feels threatened -- human or else -- there are three common reactions :, 
  * fight . 
  * flight . 
  * freeze . 
  you want to go from the third one into the first one . 
  do n't think , just run or fight . 
  running is submissive because you 'll preserve your integrity if you 're fast and agile enough ; so you 'll want to fight . 
  did you know that there are only two natural fears ? 
  those are fear of heights and fear of loud , sudden noises , all others are learned . 
  if your fear of pain is crippling , you may want to look for therapy . 
  ** edit 2 ** : you were most probably thinking about the whole process with thousands of possibilities , did n't you ? 
  a higher self-preserving instinct , like anxiety is more commonly found in people who overthink a lot . 
  a decisive , risk-taking person ** does n't think and just act ** . 
  i suggest you practice mindfulness meditation ( aka concentrating in your environment and not thinking about it ) . 
   [ jesus was ] probably one of those fuckhead infj 's who are so great and selfless . 
  lol 'd . 
  i ca n't vote for trump because i 'm mexican . 
  [ but if i could , i 'd definitely do it ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/meme/images/2/2d/genius.png/revision/latest?cb=20120617084433&amp;path-prefix=es ) . 
  it 's nice of you to guess how i feel and how my words are inconsistent with my own values . 
  moreover , i managed to somehow entertain you !, 
  how 's stuff on your end ? 
  [ feeling ostrich-y ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/denial ) already ? 
  good automoderator !, 
  may i know what 's the downside of fe ? 
  sometimes we want what we ca n't have . 
  most of our problems regarding fe is that we simply do n't know how to treat people because there 's no `` manual for living '' . 
  moreover , we 're rare and everyone takes social skills for granted ; we do n't . 
  add that we need proof of everything to validate it , and social stuff is something that `` is common sense '' or `` it 's already known '' . 
  being an intp can really be a curse for many of us . 
  ** edit ** : the life of a proton is over 10 ^ 40 seconds , 23 orders of magnitude greater than the entire life of the universe . 
  yes !, 
  after watching a bond movie , i 'll grin slightly and be completely aware of my surroundings . 
  it happens to other characters as well , it does n't matter if they 're feelers or not ( as long as it 's not a funny jim carrey character ) . 
  this hypothesis you 're submitting regards science ( which is awesome ) . 
  now , logic is a great aid to science but it 's definitely not the end-all be all . 
  i 'm pretty sure there 's already a study about what you 're posting , it might be more useful than non-specialized feedback . 
  but then again , you might as well find an intp astrophysicist . 
  interesting . 
  high fe shares some problems with low fe . 
  * i ask people to stop venting on me because its drags me down as well . 
  * i do feel guilty when i screw up in social situations . 
  * i freeze as well . 
  * this is the one in which we diverge : i really do n't care about asking for stuff when it 's not clear to me or if others do n't like the idea i 'm saying . 
  of course , even though this is the opposite attitude to the one you mention it also has issues ; some people wo n't voice their discomfort and just hate me secretly ( like when i ask weird questions to my college professor in class to clarify concepts , apparently confusing others ) . 
  i seriously do n't know what you 're talking about !, 
  109 m - 97 f. 
  got ta stop singing and dancing to lady gaga and katy perry and start burning shit up & enjoying natural catastrophes . 
  my yesterday affection was word of warcraft . 
  i 've been listening to the game 's soundtracks -- awesome ! -- and reading youtube comments ; that has sparkled my interest over the lore and story , i find some characters intriguing : like arthas and deathwing and races like the blood elves and mostly the pandarens ( that everyone hated and now kinda miss thanks to wod ) . 
  i 've always avoided wow like plague ; i 've heard of what it does to people , and i think i 'd fall prey to it if i got into it . 
  that 's much better . 
  hmmm ... 
  there was actually one situation when i was * really close * to unleash my high quality venom and emotionally wreck a girl when i got extremely pissed off -- to the point of being physically enraged -- once . 
  i think i had the -- thankfully wasted -- opportunity to show my demon fi . 
  so i understand what you 're saying . 
  if you did the 16personalities test , t indicates you are `` turbulent '' . 
  this means you may be easily stressed if things do n't go your way , and your strategy is to improve my yourself . 
  ** this **, 
  i could have just wrote this . 
  scary stuff indeed . 
  i 'm more scared of the damage i 'm capable of doing than of the damage others can do to me . 
  are you gaston ? 
  yes , it 's there twice . 
  one about calling/remembering friends ' birthdays is also repeated .
