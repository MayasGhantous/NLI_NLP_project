  really ? 
  could you elaborate ? 
  there were threads about relationship compatibility a few days ago ; i 've never thought them about seriously . 
  yet we get appreciation posts from responses from xnfj 's quite a lot . 
  charts usually say that infps are a bad couple for us , and intellectualisms wrote a post about using mbti to aid in the selection of partners . 
  i think it would be a good idea to contact a statistician and contribute to an orderly study to produce our very own relationships compatibility chart . 
  what would we do without our lovely mathematician ? 
  it would be awesome of your behalf if we could get this done . 
  sadly , besides some observations about what flaired users say i do n't think there 's a very good pool of data we could pick up on to build our chart . 
  we 'd need info to meet certain criteria for it to be useful , for example :, 
  * which quantitative feature of a relationship is a good measure of compatibility ? 
  * should n't we create our own system of points based on some criteria and select scores -- [ like this other lovely lady ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6wg_sadp0u#t=8m6s ) -- for `` very compatible '' , `` somewhat compatible '' , `` not very compatible '' and `` hardly compatible '' ? 
  istp sounds nice . 
  they 're like us , except they get things done . 
  but that 's just fantasizing . 
  i think falling into the stereotype of any personality is downright toxic . 
  an extreme entj will have loads of problems , just like an extreme intp , e-isfj , and so on . 
  we do n't know the struggles of other personality types that we admire because we just see the good parts of it , oblivious that being an intp naturally protects us from the hazards and struggles other have to endure and we 'll never need to . 
  maybe if you did an effort to improve you would n't sulk under stress . 
  and no , i 'm not scolding your or being condescending : i 've been there , so i know pretty well how paralysis works . 
  as usual , you can read this post as a one-paragraph response by reading the ** letters in bold ** . 
   nowadays if i get rejected , i do n't get depressed , and instead get angry , and possibly call someone a fucktard until i feel like getting an ice cream cone, 
  come on , you have to be better than this . 
  but , we 're kind of repressed feelers so i do n't blame you . 
  from the male perspective and my shaky journey into pua the ** approach anxiety gets reinforced by crushing experiences of rejection ** , it feels awful ( a female friend of mine told me i had a worse looking expression when i was turned down -- amicably -- by a hot girl than she had when she got suspended from our school ) . 
  so , why does this happen ? 
  i think it 's ** because we take unknown people too seriously ; and by doing that we 're opening up in a bad way , so we can be hurt by strangers by having our concept of self-image damaged ** ( could n't get the girl so i 'm not worth anything ) . 
  you appear to be just like that , leveled up : if you take it just one step further and actually meet the person and bond with him , it 's natural that you take it personally and feel like his rejection is due because you -- your very essence , what makes you unique and special and what you can not change -- are not worth it . 
  this is simply not true . 
  i 've seen from other posts you discriminate quite heavily when choosing partners ( you even posted about narrowing your possible partners to analysts excluding intp ) , so it 's clear that your partner needs to have certain superficial traits in order to comply to your standards so you give it a go . 
  when you get rejected , he has either :, 
  * satisfied what he wanted to you ( e.g : sex ), 
  * noticed he does n't want to formalize a relationship because he 's insecure about it/realized a deal breaker from you/you do n't quite qualify by his standards . 
  ** so acknowledge it 's not * your very essence * whats being rejected , but your superficial traits that are ** ( lifestyle , intelligence , looks , money , sense of humor , etc ) . 
  in order to really get down to the others ' uniqueness a lot of time must be spent with that person and you and the other person should have accepted each other 's superficialities . 
  you already stated superficial rejection means nothing to you . 
  i think the perception of that is quite relative . 
  how deep can superficiality go ? 
  it 's up to you to decide . 
  for me , superficiality ends when both parties have decided they love each other and will stick together no matter what until they die ( also willing to die for each other ) . 
  so i have plenty of space for superficiality , in my own definition . 
  enough philosophizing ; ** for me , dealing with rejection means controlling my mind to the greatest extent possible to not pour mental and emotional energy into the person who may reject me ** . 
  a girl to whom i bonded emotionally rejected me , it 's ok ; i 'm not the man for her . 
  from now on thinking about her is strictly forbidden . 
  ** in case of emergency hardly focus on the environment ( being mindful as in mindfulness meditation ) ** . 
  by the way , you seem like a quite colorful girl . 
  i 'd like to meet you sometime but i get the hunch we 're preeety far away from each other . 
   it 's just how i am . 
  no , it 's not . 
  your procrastination is due to you linking your self-worth to outcomes , so when you delay stuff , you 're giving yourself and excuse to under-perform ; which is understandable , taking into account what 's in stake ( if your performance is zero , then your self worth must be zero as well ) . 
  but your self worth is always high , you are a unique individual and how well you perform , how intelligent you are , how beautiful you are , etc. 
  are just superficial traits of yours , that identify yourself on a superficial level , yes ; but not you . 
  perhaps if you risk failing more and more and realizing that your `` spirit '' is not linked to your subjective vision of success then you 'll improve much more . 
  welcome to the bane train !, 
  we all feel like this when we discover mbti . 
  my thoughts are usually expressed through listening to my own voice in my head , so when i shut my inner voice ; i stop thinking about that ( which usually is hoping from one thought to another ) . 
  practice mindfulness meditation : it leads you to pay attention to all of those things your subconscious discards : your breathing , the sensations in your inner organs , the noises of the environment , the weight of your clothes . 
  when you pay attentions to the sensory input , you can break free of the ti-ne combo . 
  you seem to be extremely turbulent . 
  you ca n't get stuff done because your procrastination is crippling , is n't it ? 
  if yes that 's because you link your perception of self-worth to your desired outcome . 
  you were so anxious of blowing of the opportunity to be in a relationship with her that you never approached and now you 'll probably never have the chance to be her boyfriend anymore . 
  you were thinking about the outcome all the time . 
  relax . 
  to be good a anything you have to screw up stuff and move past . 
  in order to move past screwing things up to further screw stuff up in order to get good you have to place very low emotional resources in your failure . 
  and i 'm procrastinating by telling you this , by the way . 
  better get moving at once !, 
  i was going to write suggestions but the tone indicates me you 're simply venting . 
  why do n't you flair your venting posts in the title ? 
  i think this would be nice gesture for other readers . 
  information about you ? 
  i do n't have any concrete one , i simply remember what you wrote on other posts and try to connect them to get a mental sketch of yours ( that is not very trustworthy , i know ; but it 's better than nothing ) . 
  what i said about procrastination is taken from a book about it . 
   when i do that occasional thing i have to do , it always turns out well . 
  this does n't make me procrastinate less . 
  does this mean you will advance your skills to a certain level and then hit a block when you 're ready for more advance challenges/refinement of skills ? 
  my impression of you was that you 're a successful , happy person . 
  was i wrong ? 
   i 've said many times that esfjs are fucking selfish creatures , and rarely does anyone disagree with me . 
  ** generalizations , stereotypes and discrimination are useful -- and often necessary for survival -- tools we can use ** ( if a person who looks like an aggressive drunk comes straight towards you , you 'll most probably trigger your reptilian brain ) , ** but you know you 're overshooting it when you imply or say that * all * feelers are selfish , or all estjs . 
  it 's simply not fair ** . 
  some of the people who appreciate us the most -- at least flaired users on this subreddit -- are feelers ( except for some infps ) . 
  i was adamant against the opposition to dating based on types because i thought it was unfair and the risk of missing out * the individuality * of that person was too great . 
  but on a statistical sketch it seems it 's a fairly good idea to know how to accurately type and look for a relationship . 
  you helped to change my view . 
  but i get the impression you 're going too far ; you 're brushing feelers off through a rationalization of their beliefs and traits rather than on pure , processed data from an objective study ( probability through numbers based on previous experiences of a sizable sample , not traits ) . 
  feelers have issues of their own : have you ever though that maybe it 's a little annoying for them to get their hearts crushed by every . 
  single . 
  person . 
  they . 
  meet . 
  because they open their hearts up too quickly , too often , too deep and with way too many people ( and they ca n't avoid it because they * are * feelers ) ? 
  how about the disgruntled sentinel that enjoys their security so much that the prospect of slight change is simply terrifying ? 
  or that absolutely breaks down at all levels when a crisis hits ? 
  or that wo n't try anything new because their comfort zone is basically a black hole that holds him/her back of living new experiences making rough edges with his/her partner ? 
  or the artisan that hops from one job to another , one new place to another , one partner to another , never ever settling down at once and never being able to build up on anything because they 're so free they do n't have rules and guidelines to have the structure necessary to grow ? 
   can i ask why you thought that ? 
  well , you know what you want in life and you go for it . 
  happy people are known to do that .
