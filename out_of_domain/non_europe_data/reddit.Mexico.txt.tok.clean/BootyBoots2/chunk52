  and do n't get discouraged by the downvotes . 
  when it comes to them , r/intp is just as superficial as mainstream reddit , so do n't take it to heart . 
  because you value your opinions , and do have a personal investment to american politics . 
  messing with your values means messing with your essence . 
  did you know post-season depression is a thing ? 
  some people are so invested in the outcome of their team that is it looses the final they do become pretty bleak for some time . 
  it 's interesting how we can become attached to an idea or an abstract concept such as a team .

  i have n't even played wow or deepened on the lore . 
  as a usual text wall writer i have to tell you it 's important that you break the text in pieces where the story follows-up . 
  that way is more pleasant to the eye , and easier for the brain to process the information you want to communicate . 
  also , below the lower right corner of the text box you can see the formatting help in blue ( right to the reddiquette ) . 
  follow [ this link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/comments/1vjfm9/how_do_i_insert_a_blank_line_between_2_lines_of/ ) for a tutorial on how to insert blank lines , just to make it look more appealing . 
  read the ** bold ** to compress this comment to a single paragraph . 
  ** communication is paramount , ** there 's no escape from that fact ; ** in both your family dynamic and with society you must be able to effectively communicate your needs , wants , desires , opinions , etc. 
  it seems that you 're pretty homesick . 
  may we know where do you come from ? 
  if you live in another country it 's expected for you to adapt -- slowly but surely -- to the new place you 're living in . 
  i 've always said it : all countries have cultural problems . 
  identify the cultural values that you can hold tight from your culture and adopt the positive things your new home can offer to you . 
  ** do n't be ashamed of your past identity , there 's no reason for that ; moreover you could n't decide where to be born , so there 's really nothing to be ashamed about ** . 
  of course , knowing all this wo n't change your feelings -- that chain you to your bubble -- and i know it 's easy to put this words on paper and living is an entirely different thing , but ** your best shot is to open up and interact with people . 
  ** you have n't done that so much , so you may not really know that ** you 're missing out on a plethora of amazing people you can get superbly well with ** . 
  loosen up and then teach your little intp sibling ( i suspect the infp will find her own way ) . 
  oh , and by the way ; i 've read here on reddit -- certainly not a very reliable source altogether but still -- that anglophone countries * suck * at learning other languages because they feel they do n't need it , as english is now the common language . 
  and just like any other beginner at speaking another language , beginner anglophones may fail to produce the specific sounds of a given language , compensating with english sounds , like palatalizing ; this is a common mistake done by most learners , including you and them . 
  there 's absolutely no reason to be ashamed . 
  plus , ** even if you 're good at speaking the language , you can be afraid of talking to people at large ** ( i 'm a mexican whose spoken english has been praised by 3 american -- white -- natives ) , which does n't really make use of such ability , so ** keep that in mind : they 're separate abilities . 
  maybe you can find a friend who likes you ( despite your broken english ) and who will speed your skills up !, 
  yeah , i actually became curious of wow first for its fame of being the cocaine of gaming and that led me to read about the mop and cata hate , also wotlk , tbc and vanilla love . 
  then i saw all the trailers and loved mop because of the awesomeness of chen and the way he thoroughly stated how his culture worked in 15 seconds of video and a few lines of wisdom . 
  also cata because ... well there 's a huge scary dragon . 
  who does n't like huge scary dragons ? 
  although wow music is quite enjoyable it does n't communicate much to me because i did n't associate that music with a specific moment in my life -- like high school -- but boy ... naruto shippuden and gears of war soundtracks do bring the nostalgia train back . 
   we 're an english-speaking family living in spain . 
  i assumed you were like , a croatian emigrating to the u.s or something . 
  lol . 
   they 've been turning more and more towards the internet to find friends and such ( especially the intp sister , she seems to rely a lot on these people ) . 
  this is n't necessarily a bad thing , but in this case it 's not a good thing , as it 's avoiding the big issue . 
  yes , it is a very bad thing because ** physical contact is really important to human beings , and computers simply wo n't make up for it . 
  ** i see your situation is so deep , it 's beyond comprehension of `` normal '' people and your family has very specific problems of your own , and people are likely to not understand them . 
  progress little by little . 
  how about this ? 
  take a walk for at least 15 minutes a day . 
  when you feel comfortable with it add 5 more minutes until you feel perfectly fine with walking in public -- maybe even crowded ! -- places . 
  go out and ask for the time to strangers from time to time . 
  time is irrelevant , but telling the time is just a common courtesy and will force an interaction within a perfectly acceptable social range . 
  damn , here comes the hard part : people tend to talk in groups . 
  if you listen to something that matches your interest why not sticking physically close to that group and intervene with that observation ? 
  then the conversation can flow naturally : you 'll make bonds with these people ( but maybe your intp sister avoids bonding because your `` hermit '' parents did n't quite bond with her when she was a baby ... 
  anyway , she has to do it in a certain point of her life . 
  now 's the best time to do it ) do n't worry about the intervention : as long as it 's not intentionally rude you have nothing to worry about ; that 's how we humans work , by voicing our interests we bond with people * which is opposed to initiating conversations based on `` utilitarian '' exchanges such as asking for the time . 
  the purpose of point 3 . is to let you loosen up socially but you can not get stuck in there * . 
  spain is a latin country -- we 're called `` hispanics '' for a reason -- so most likely the custom is to kiss on the cheek -- male to female/female to female -- for greetings like here in mexico . 
  the point is that it requires way more physical contact than for example , the u.s where the custom is to stretch hands ; regardless of the gender . 
  getting comfortable to kiss on the cheek on greetings -- in case they actually do it -- should n't be bothersome after a while because your brain will accept it as a social gesture rather than a sexual/romantic gesture . 
  it 'll bring you closer to the culture * and * more involved in your community . 
  have more friends . 
  perhaps start a relationship !, 
  ** if any of these points becomes insurmountable -- they 're not -- i suggest you check a book on [ cognitive behavioral therapy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cognitive_behavioral_therapy ) . 
  ** you can download some of them at [ kat ] ( https://kat.cr/ ) or buy one at your bookstore , whatever is more practical to you . 
  i 'd like to visit spain one day . 
  those folks are awesome . 
  or was it * guay * ? 
  hehehe . 
  off with you !!, 
  [ we only adore satan ] ( http://www.yossum.com/filescontent/menu/menu000274/images_meditation_circle_by_night_500.jpg ) in this house !, 
  you have to admit the title is sweet bait for a `` shit x says '' subreddit or r/subredditdrama . 
   why ca n't we have mods remove these again can someone explain it to me . 
  read the stickied post . 
  so , she commits a very serious crime and ... 
  needs to `` face '' therapy for it ? 
  i admire a man who stands for his ideals . 
  perhaps you wronged your son , but you stuck with what you thought was right . 
  i can not blame you for that . 
  but then you should have been equally consistent and pushed for charges relentlessly until she had to sleep in the companionship of the most violent women your country has to offer so that your actions were truly consistent with your ideas . 
  i hope you 're right . 
  i knew that thread was going to make it ti this sub .

  seventy nine ? 
  wow , he looked like ... 50 or something . 
  camo done right ... 
  the other story is even worse . 
  well , i presume most redditors are american -- i 'm not -- so 9/11 , although a sad and shocking event , did n't cause nearly the amount of shock so many people report to have had . 
   3000 miles away, 
  alaska or south america ? 
  the cancer story was the one i was talking about . 
  mexican here . 
  i owe my english skills to nintendo . 
  and i do agree with u/imostlyjustread when he says you have to expose yourself to the language ; for example , most of my searches are in english because the information that can be found is generally better than the one found in spanish ( just compare wikipedia articles in both languages ) . 
  if you 're into videogames , i suggest you play a rpg . 
  i it * forces * you to speak to every single villager for hints on what to do , and there are lots of times an animation to progress on the game activates when you speak to a certain character . 
  if you already have the most basic vocabulary set -- you can already understand most of the words that repeat over and over -- then just keep reading : you 'll learn new words by contextualizing ; rather than looking for them in the dictionary . 
   i think a lot of the shock people had was surprise , many people thought something like that would never happen in new york . 
  true . 
   a small town in the uk . 
  not exactly 3000 miles away , but 3000 is close enough . 
  europe !, 
  i guess life in a small british town must be quiet and gentle ... stereotypes maybe , but my picture of a small uk town evokes pure pleasantry .
