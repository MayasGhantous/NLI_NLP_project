   scottish town , not an english one . 
  i said british , 
  are you ok with scotland being a part of the uk ? 
  or would you like scottish authorities to take care of itself rather as a part of the union ? 
  i live in [ guanajuato ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/guanajuato,+m%c3%a9xico/@21.062219,-100.9233236,3.88z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x842b5b8f509b7f7f:0xe78ea61981be43a0 ) . 
  i do n't think there are any metrics of stereotypes for us mexicans speaking about localities ; which makes the `` general '' stereotype even more inaccurate , as mexico is very diverse and the people have different customs and traditions from state to state . 
  guanajuato is a somewhat rural state with a two or three large cities one of which hosts [ a large balloon festival ] ( http://www.vivefig.mx/eng/ ) to which lots of balloonists attend ( most of them american but there are many others that come from europe ) . 
  i still do n't know why some people stereotype mexico to be the 1800 's tijuana-esque place depicted by speedy gonzales ' cartoons . 
   i know , but most stereotypes of small british towns are of rural england . 
  caught me . 
  although i think all british rural areas look pretty much the same way . 
  or at least scotland 's and england 's . 
  i 've no idea how wales looks like . 
   you 've also got the stereotypes that lead to walls being built ... 
  the stereotypes evoked by [ this guy ] ( http://images.dailykos.com/images/184772/story_image/trumpeagle9_copy.jpg?1449687339 ) ? 
  the more you know !, 
  uh ... that 's not entirely false . 
  it 's not that the * whole country * is run by druglords per se , but the states of tamaulipas and especially michoac\u00e1n are so overrun by corruption you might as well say they 're run by druglords . 
  of course not everyone is rushing to the border , middle and high classes do exist but * social mobility is pretty much nonexistent * . 
  so when you have over 50 million people in poverty , most of the times the only hope lies up north . 
  actually there 's another way you can become rich overnight without risking a trip to the u.s. . you guessed it : become a drug hitman . 
  to hide it from the world ? 
  not much , actually . 
  but they do give away lots of stuff in campaigns , some bastards refrain to give social benefits -- from established welfare programs -- to people who need it by making it look like they can have them * if they vote for them * , when they 're actually entitled to them ( by the way mexican welfare consists mostly on some monthly food supplies and some cash ; it 's not like you can decently live off of it , like in europe or the u.s ) . 
  mexican politics . 
  indeed shady business . 
  no wonder why a discouraging amount of people flee the country and why the u.s * needs * to secure it 's border . 
  i do understand the problems on both sides . 
  that 's the part that hurts the most . 
  at least for me it 's not like i can loose cellphones and just buy another one like it was candy . 
  there 's something about the damn cellphones . 
  i keep loosing them but not keys or laptops ( thank god ) . 
  that is not only inefficient ; it 's cruel . 
  i am a fond user of such breakthrough , modern piece of tech ; yet i still loose my cellphone every year and a half or so ( and i hate myself for doing so ) . 
  i developed a system to not loose stuff and the * one * time i did n't follow it , it happened . 
  and no , the main lesson behind this is not `` make your bed '' . 
  full speech -- and more lessons -- [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqzfhrw0fu ) . 
  i get what you 're saying . 
  there was a time when i 'd refuse to buy any cellphone that costs over 300 pesos ( around $ 35 usd before the chinese devaluation and its carry-over ) as a `` safety '' device to lessen my losses in case of loosing a cell phone . 
  this is shameful to share , but there was one time when i lost 2 cellphones in a 24 hour period . 
  conversely , i have never ever dropped my cellphone in the toilet , and i 'm surprised this actually happens to people ( often ) . 
  here in mexico , doing that means you can kiss your car goodbye ... 
   i 'm not a native english speaker so maybe i 'm missing something . 
  neither am i ; and checking a grammar site , i recognize i screwed it up . 
  i should have said `` dae keep losing his/her cellphone '' . 
  i do n't think you 're * losing * anything here . 
  yet i recommend you to be * looser * about the importance you bestow to good spelling so you enjoy more the content of the posts you read . 
  i think this common mistake has its roots on associating the sound of that word with that specific spelling . 
   made a mistake of my own, 
  which one ? 
  i ca n't locate it ... 
   maybe in 10-20 years it 'll actually be the correct spelling . 
  i wish that did n't happen ; i prefer people adjusting to the correct rules than the correct rules binding to people : they 're rules after all ... 
  frank : yeah !!, 
  this new passage to the mib hq is da shit !!, 
  -- gets stuck in toilet --, 
  frank : uh ... k ? 
  anybody ? 
  shit .

  you ca n't see the forest full of trees . 
  is the custom in japan to pay for the girl 's meals ? 
  i 'm asking because , for what i 've read on the internet , most high-income countries are somehow progressive and the girl might take it as a sexist offense if you offer to pay for her meal . 
  conversely , here in mexico , it 's kind of the social norm to pay for the girl 's meal . 
  there 's a beer company ? 
  wow ... 
  well ... 
  i wish i could meet an infj like you guys did . 
  both of my girlfriends have been exfp 's , and they love me the way i love them . 
  perhaps it 's because of my outliers ... 
  ** edit : ** a couple observations ;, 
  * most matches reported in both threads talk about intp male paired up to infj girl . 
  is the match as compatible the other way around ? 
  * infj 's seem quite smart and love information just like us . 
  if they think so much , how come they 're feelers ? 
  do they base their decisions in feelings as opposed to thoughts despite large amounts of information ? 
  do they usually develop their te ? 
   i adore intps as friends . 
  my success rate with them romantically is basically zero . 
  in my perception , if there 's a type that struggles a lot to date and be dated , it 's us . 
  yeah , it 's not very well distributed , tough . 
  hmmmm ... 
  i share your attitude towards him . 
  i 've heard he 's got some issues when it comes to respecting public order ( which i dislike ) yet still i keep reading comments of praise towards his productions and his new album seems to have a very high quality . 
  it seems the man is a perfectionist , and therefore giving a try at his music does n't sound like a bad idea ; you might even like it . 
  i guess he can just go to people 's houses [ and have orgies on their motherfucking fish tanks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhjteynolbi#t=1m41s ) . 
  we have to be more careful , though . 
  i have a system , but the one time i did n't follow it , this happened . 
  we 've got to do something about this fast ... 
  every time i `` cross a portal '' -- doorway , entering/climbing down public transport , entering a taxi cab , entering a lab , going to school , and generally speaking leaving the current place i 'm in or entering a new one i feel the contents of my pockets to check for my `` essentials '' -- wallet , keys and cellphone -- while also minding any non-essentials i may be carrying outside my pockets : jackets , bags , schoolbags , glasses , watches , etc. 
  that i may lose . 
  perform this ritual every time you enter or leave a place .
