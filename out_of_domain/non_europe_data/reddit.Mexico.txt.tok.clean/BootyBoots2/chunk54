  it has actually prevented me from losing my cellphone in taxi cabs twice . 
  but maybe your problem is about losing stuff * within * your house ; then i suggest you designate places to leave things ( e.g : keys on a keyholder , money in the safe , etc. ) . 
  and as soon as you arrive home , empty your pockets/bag and place everything where it belongs on their designated areas . 
  do not do anything else ( unless it 's an emergency ) until you put everything where it belongs . 
   thomas sowell could be an intp too . 
  i saw the man in a conservative show called `` uncommon knowledge '' . 
  i love his interviews . 
  [ even uncle sam himself dissaproves . 
  ] ( https://localtvkstu.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/eagle-attacks-trump.gif ), 
  as interviews come and go , peter 's hair gets whiter ... and sowell 's belly gets bigger ... 
   college is about getting certified in something . 
  it 's not about learning . 
  you learn on your own time . 
  yes . 
  when i become a teacher , i 'll repeat this phrase nonstop . 
  hmmmm ... 
  your dad sounds like and extremely achievement-oriented person : so much he even criticizes the performance of the entertainment of * your * choosing . 
  i suggest you have an honest conversation about your limits and his expectations , and maybe you 'll get to an agreement about this . 
  perhaps he 's oblivious to your situation ; it 's a common intp problem : so it 's easy for me to understand obliviousness in other types . 
   `` wasting '' only # 20 . 
  wasting `` only '' # 20 . 
  fify . 
  accidental promo !, 
  i did n't quite see it that way , but i think your reasoning is valid . 
  when i wrote my comment , i was thinking that # 20 loss fuck-up is not something many people can spare . 
  as a battle of endor veteran , i wish your statement was true . 
  it 's easy to misspell when words are homophone , our brain wants to react to everything fast so you may accidentally get confused once in a while . 
  i do n't know ... he seems pretty connected to tangible things . 
  the very fact that he 's questing all the time instead of learning about the power -- and source -- of magic in hyrule kind of makes me think he 's not one of us . 
  i think niles samson from gears of war 2 is an intp , but since his `` appearance '' was very short , i ca n't judge his type properly . 
   what is a seal , anyway ? 
  what are they related to ? 
  [ armament .

   i should be able to tell anyone any of my ` darkest secrets ' and not have to worry about any repercussions in terms of judgement or harassment . 
  except that that 's not the way the world works . 
  if we 're discussing the apple issue , then we 're talking about the u.s ; a country that is exceptional in a number of ways : one of them being that it 's absurdly hard , if not impossible to have a dictatorship . 
  latin america has seen dictatorships come and go -- most countries , if not all ; not sure about the french guyana , suriname and costa rica , though -- but not the u.s and canada . 
  i do n't think it feasible for a dictatorship to happen on those countries because the social conditions wo n't allow it . 
  so , even though there is such thing as american corruption and maybe even some theft in the form of `` deviation of resources '' on behalf of governors and county majors , you 'll never reach the point where the american government will kidnap , torture and kill dissidents like you would expect on a common dictatorship . 
  you have to share your personal information to people at all times to do things such as requesting a driver 's license or applying for a job . 
  your data is retrieved , managed , stored and disposed by professionals . 
  think about this scenario as the u.s. 
  now , if you randomly post your full name and telephone number on a large default subreddit thread ; you can brace yourself to have a very bad time . 
  you should n't , true ; but your correct moral reasoning wo n't prevent you from having it . 
  that 's the rest of the world . 
  i have read most of your posts and i can see you are conflicted person : i recognize that because i 've been there and i know how it 's like ; perhaps not at your level , but still i empathize with you . 
  i think most of your posts , rather than trying to communicate something to people are self-reminders of your convictions and new plans to turn around your life for good . 
  and i know you 'll be able to pull it off . 
  i also think you 're most welcome in our community but , have you ever thought maybe it 's more productive to keep a diary rather than redditing ? 
  that way you would n't be prone to escalate so quickly and then apologizing , given your current situation . 
  this is the internet , anyway . 
  we do n't know who you really are , where you come from , what do you do , how you look like ; and most of us do n't really care . 
  but there 's a whole world out there with face-to-face interaction where you can not afford to screw it up like this . 
  be mindful of people . 
  cheers !, 
  if i had to describe in a single word the most negative aspect of american society -- in a general , perhaps stereotypical and somehow unfair way -- i 'd struggle hard to decide between `` paranoic '' and `` uncooperative '' . 
  i agree with you . 
  every single type has lots of struggles . 
  given a certain context having any of the 16 different personalities could be a blessing or a curse . 
  r/intp is just the one sub that is the most active , and therefore the one more prone to express its woes ; which is natural considering our insightful nature and thought processes . 
  it 's kind of like what we do . 
  an underdeveloped estp is too busy yolo-ing to post on reddit . 
  no , not quite . 
  sometimes i daydream about how cool it would be a stereotypical istp or about how convenient would it be to be an xxtj . 
  but make no mistake , if i could change to be any other type i 'd stick with this one . 
  i hate some aspects of my intpness ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  but i certainly love most of it . 
  jack napier is still larger than that . 
  i was thinking about han solo/mcgyver-like mechanical geniuses . 
  although , han solo sounds more like an estp than istp giving it a second thought . 
  so , we 're 4chan and canada is tumblr ? 
  i 'm flattered . 
  when i was around your age i fell in love for a girl that is the closest i have seen to be like an elven queen : beautiful , happy and intelligent but also ambitious and kind . 
  the exact same thing happened : she rejected me just like your girl did to you . 
  and just like you , i wanted to break off of it ( my gawd , how come love strike me when i have my superior intellect ? 
  just kidding bro ) . 
  truth is , ** only time diminishes that off . 
  high school crushes last for years and maybe they last for the rest of some people 's lives . 
  ** wait , wait and wait some more . 
  do n't worry ( or maybe start worrying already ? 
  ) , ** she 's definitely not the only girl you 'll fall in love with ** . 
  perhaps , even more intense crushes are on their way . 
  so ** you should start getting ready for them ** . 
  if you 're already athletic , keep it up . 
  if not , start working out ; girls dig it . 
  and do n't read psychological theory in the hopes of gathering enough knowledge to solve your day to day problems ( it 's never enough ) : even though that seems coherent and true , pure theory wo n't be of any use in the real world : it 's mostly just of academic value . 
  for the love of everything you hold sacred in this world listen to me :, 
  * if you physically like a girl , approach her and sub-communicate your intentions of relationship/hookup from . 
  the . 
  start . 
  you can not swing back and forth from friendship to relationship . 
  decide what you want and stick to it , all the way through . 
  that 's the way of least heartache on both parties , i can tell you that . 
  * if you want to read a book , i suggest you read mark manson 's `` models '' . 
  and get your hands dirty going out and meeting girls , talk to them and do n't let the fear of women creep up in you : it 's very difficult to fight off and your age is quite a good time to get started already . 
  so do it !, 
  why am i telling you this ? 
  because i 'd tell this to my 16 year old self if i had the chance to magically go back in time . 
  you certainly remind me of me .
