  to be fair , some points are basic civility . 
  thankfully , i have n't got any mental diseases , but when i hear `` trigger '' used in such context i always picture something like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb_eipmbwyw ) . 
  and it must be way worse in real life , because of the horrors of war but still . 
  our so-called `` leaders '' prostituted us to the west . 
  also cyrillic . 
  only russia uses cyrillic script .

  want to start a business ? 
  i 'm the master partner . 
  as i was taking a shower i wondered how a canadian would ever vote for trump . 
  every time there 's a big shooting in the us , r/grc and r/dgu trend . 
  and europeans , australians and canadians always express their disbelief about american stubbornness regarding guns . 
  some canadians express that there are some places in the us has gun violence rates they can only have nightmare about . 
  for fun , i wrote that it 's quite the plot twist to realize the u.s is the mexico of canada . 
  as a canadian , do n't you think it 's a little hypocritical that us wants to build a wall between us and them while they can always have a w i d e open border up north ? 
  mess with their profits and you 'll get beheaded corpses on common pits , or bodies hanging from bridges with messages written so poorly ; a 3rd grader would facepalm . 
  no , i have n't watched too many movies . 
  i have read too many newspapers . 
  really ? 
  i 'm one of those folks ( never been there though ) . 
  and i live in le\u00f3n . 
  i 've heard you have to be very careful when picking up girls there ... you never know when you can be hooking up with a hitman 's girlfriend/hookup . 
   ripping a generally emotional issue -- for the us -- right back to bare facts . 
  fify . 
  as a mexican , i do n't see what the big fuss is all about with this racial thing . 
  props for cuar\u00f3n and i\u00f1\u00e1rritu , though . 
  ai n't that the truth ... 
   and , you 're correct , of course , this issue is generally an american one , but watching it as a thinker and as an outsider is quite interesting . 
  true . 
  american social and political drama attracts me like bees are attracted to honey . 
  are you an american ? 
  because of the fact that the spaces i used ( alt +255 ) on my emphasis of the word `` wide '' are forgotten each time i edit a comment , i did n't care to edit that i thought it was hypocritical that trump wants to do so , not the us as a whole ; i recognize i did n't express myself correctly . 
  my bad . 
  i have always stood by the fact that americans can secure their borders the way they see fit . 
  what conflicts me is not so much the us border wall but * trump 's * border wall . 
  he says he 's making us pay for it , when -- although most trespassers are mexican -- people of other nationalities -- especially honduras for what i see -- rush to the border . 
  why are we paying their share ? 
  besides , it shows his utter ignorance on mexican socio-political issues ( or central american for that matter ) . 
  mexico has a huge social disparity -- over 50 million mexicans living in poverty -- and in many cases there 's absolutely no possible way these folks can make a decent living , so they go to the us ( i 'm not condoning the fact that they 're committing a crime out of despair , i just want to illustrate my point ) . 
  politicians and rich people are too busy stealing money and getting a hold of their monopolies , and then there 's us : the middle class . 
  we struggle every day to not fall to poverty and now we 're yet to be burdened again ( unfairly , since we 're neither the cause -- poors -- nor the root -- monopolists , politicians -- of the problem ) . 
  how about overburdening the amnesty-granted illegal mexicans ? 
  or their offspring ( since they had the privilege of being born american citizens rather than in their parent 's `` hellhole '' ) ? 
  or every common american , since it 's a device that will positively affect all of them ? 
  lol . 
  were you talking about scott walker , governor of wisconsin ? 
  what a guy !, 
  nevertheless , i do n't think canadian border plans can ever come to be realized ( at least not in our lifetimes ) , while trump 's wall ... 
  it 's a much more real issue ; it seems americans want to `` disestablish '' themselves , either by the hand of trump or bernie . 
   another point to consider is that the president controls the executive branch . 
  in order to build a wall , he 'd likely need house/senate approval . 
  true , i overlooked that fact . 
  i also overlooked the fact that politicians are very vocal when on campaign . 
  which overhyped/outrageous campaign promises did obama promise and never delivered ? 
  here in mexico , the party leader holds quite a prominent and influential position , and it 's likely for him to run for office ; but he 'll not necessarily become president . 
  i think it 's quite cool they get to choose the republicans they want , here , it 's the party that does that ( all primaries are closed ) : hence a divided party may lose the general elections due to divsiveness ( like the pan on past election ) . 
  what seems unfair is the `` winner takes all '' dynamic regarding delegates ( and the fact that republicans and democrats need a different number of delegates to win ) . 
  i dislike breastfeeding in public and i have actually called a woman out for doing so , but i have to admit your argument is quite convincing . 
  for what i 've understood after watching quite a bit of explanatory videos on youtube , the `` winner takes all '' mechanic means that if on a given state more people vote for a candidate , * all * of the delegates go to that candidate , instead of bestowing the candidates the delegates they `` earned '' through popular vote .

  do you want to break this sub ? 
  because [ this is how you break this sub ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/intp/comments/33uksp/evolutionary_psychology_vs_feminismpsychology/ ) . 
  and also innocent and unrelated students , teachers and personnel . 
  actually , this image made me think about it and this thread answered the question :, 
  talking about `` different genders '' for the sake of inclusion and `` social justice '' -- whatever that means -- will probably lead you into an exhausting and mostly pointless argument open for yet more drama in the future . 
  pok\u00e9mon in the other hand , is pure fucking joy .

  mein dear fappers , i found the girl : she 's [ katt leya ] ( http://es.xhamster.com/photos/gallery/5563890/black_women_thick_5_katt_leya.html ) .

  oh , yes it does .

   i 'm asking this here because i 'm convinced most people in this subreddit are rational and can give reasons, 
  lol no . 
  start a feminism thread and see it for yourself . 
  r/intp can be just as passional as mainstream reddit ( yet i recognize it 's much better worded ) . 
  as usual , this long post can be compressed by reading the ** bold ** words . 
  but humans being tribal is a great way to start the opinion you 're asking for : i 'm not european , but i do n't have to be to realize that ** every time cultures clash , there 's going to be a blood bath ** ( yes , being white and european does n't protect you from doing that ) . 
  history has taught us that countless times : it 's quite sad . 
  now , we 're talking about people in * dire * need . 
  we 're fine and dandy having a meal on our tables , a roof above our heads and not having some maniacs trying to dismember us for not submitting to their religion-disguised power craze ; the humanitarian dilemma comes with the fact that if you were unlucky , you would have been born in that country and therefore you 'd be one of them . 
  it sucks , does n't it ?
