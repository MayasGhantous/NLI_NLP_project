  now , ** this is a multi-level problem because of ** the whole ** terrorism ** thing : people now fear bombings -- rightfully so , as we 're still animals and we were negatively conditioned by the terrorist attacks -- ** and people wanting to institute the sharia law ** ( what i call islamism which will take away the rights people have been fighting for centuries to achieve ) . 
  the negative identity bestowed to muslims is an issue because if it 's true that not all muslims are terrorists , ** muslim terrorists/islamist groups exist in -- i dare to say -- every country that has islam as its major religion . 
  then ** there is the economic aspect of it ** : some countries in europe are doing much better than others and i do n't see any refugees pleading for assylum in greece ( if this is incorrect , feel free to correct me ) . 
  this event took us by surprise and i do n't think ** any country had infrastructure already pepared to deal with this situation , especially if they already had welfare systems . 
  then there 's the fact that ** europeans have dangerously low birth rates , in comparison to muslim very high birth rates . 
  europeans have a legitimate concern about the dissapear of their cultural identities ** , even though , on a second thought cultures change with time and traits that once were part of a country 's identity can be lost forever as time passes by because societies evolve ( it 's not like you see french people in [ this outfits ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/f4/9e/27/f49e27e97e75915b8bc1a104f6ce7915.jpg ) anymore ) . 
  now , i doubt that the cameras they use to film their beheadings , the ak-47s they shoot with and the ( circa ) 1976 toyota trucks use to get by were designed and produced by the people of the levant . 
  all of these are either american , japanese or european inventions ( like pretty much every appliance we have ) so somebody is making a profit with this conflict by supplying isis with technology , or perhaps they just scavenged the remnants of the cold war : the greatest power play history has ever seen . 
  which leads us to the us : the great arbiter of nations . 
  these people are now facing the consecuences of the us invading irak to find wmds -- no wmds were found -- and bringing some enduring freedom while on the way simply because they could . 
  though , to be fair , none of us really understood that there were extremely important social and political undercurrents going on in irak and saddam kept europe safe by controlling the islamists ( and the general populace ) with an iron fist . 
  who would have thought about that ? 
  now , americans are retreating -- or if not at least they 're announcing plans to do so -- and leaving europe to take care of the mess they started . 
  to be fair , then again ; the us military presence and might has indeed put and end to bloody conflicts , and let european countries spare large quantities of money to invest them in other areas of their economies . 
  but if the us becomes the world 's police , who will police the us military ? 
  how will the world make the us accountable for its war crimes ? 
  how will the world have an effective voice about/against the desicions of a us president that can have negative repercussions to europe in the long run ? 
  so wrapping it up / ** tldr : ** you have a situation where a massive amount of people has been displaced to europe due to the aftermath of war started by the us . 
  those people have a bad reputation thanks to the effective propaganda spewed by the same people who are causing the displacement ( and a bunch of very vocal and dogmatic others ) . 
  the us -- that overthrew the dictator that kept this group in check -- is now retreating because of it 's actually pointless for them to be there ; leaving europe with the task of either shutting its doors for security or * carefully * letting them in ( which implies accomodation ) . 
  i provided just an overview of my own view of the subject . 
  regarding actions to be taken and solutions to the problem , i 've written other posts .

  no , seriously , that 's the name of the tumblr page . 
  please stand up to pay respects to [ the new anthem of r/intp ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3iqc3hcg-w ) . 
  in my opinion , entj 's are necessary because leading and directing is natural for them , * and we need it * . 
  we need structures of power to serve us ( banks , goverments , armies , and any agency you can think about ) . 
  perhaps they hinder innovation for being so stubborn , but i do n't think labs are their work environments of choice , and if they are , then they 'll be open to suggestion because that the area they want to work in . 
  anyway , being the leaders , it 's the position of leadership the one we want them in . 
  if an intp provides a well thought , * working * system that improves productivity in a tested , operational way , i do n't think said entj would stop you for implementing it . 
  stereotypically speaking ; we want them leading , they want us inventing .

  seriously though , i want to put distance to myself and reddit an focus on school . 
  i 'm way too interested on reddit and that has to change . 
  but otherwise , i 'd be honoured to preside over this sub . 
  thank you for remembering me !, 
  i feel honoured . 
  agreed , but the old testament is too large to re-read it in it 's entirety just to quickly fact check for fun , speaking about the dreaded penalties contained in leviticus , chapter xx . 
  true , but this falls into the realm of `` what 's not forbidden is legal '' . 
  i just want to know if there were any specific rulings targeted against heterosexual anal sex by the bible . 
  edit : thinking it twice , perhaps i should have worded the title better , but it 's too late now . 
  interesting !, 
  could you cite the versicle that states it ? 
  yep , i 'm completely aware of how archaic ( does that word referece the * arch * of aliance ? ), 
  these laws are , that 's not the point of this thread . 
  i was just curious if there was an actual penalty for heterosexual sodomy ( in the sense of anal sex ) . 
  yeah , i fucked up with the title , lol . 
  thanks !, 
  this is the answer i was looking for . 
  thank you . 
  actual mexican here . 
  no , the descendants of aztecs ( or any pre-hispanic culture for that matter ) are not vulnerable from cultural appropriation . 
  they are vulnerable of being displaced , discriminated , arrested without trial -- and still serving sentence years after innocence is proved publicly -- and abused by the mexican armed forces ( federal police , marines ) . 
  there are right functions for every activity . 
  of course it 's pretty swell to fall in with the definition of success of the culture you 're living in , and we tend to be biased about our strengths ( logic is best !, 
  empathy is best !, 
  creativity is best !, 
  safety within traditions is best ! ) . 
  perhaps we should strive to rely so much on our main two functions and start developing the others to an acceptable level to be better well rounded . 
  uploading your art to a social platform and sharing with people is a great way to keep track on your work and perhapas encourage you to keep going .

  well , if you 're bored with `` professional voyeurism '' already and you want to feel like a badass for watching non-national security endangering naked people , then [ go to hell ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/imgoingtohellforthis ) and on the left side of the upper banner where the you can find the `` my subreddits '' list , along with front - all - random and randnsfw ( this button does not appear on the mainstream reddit an will keep showing as long as you navigate within the nsfw redditsphere ) . 
  keep the eye in the sky for freedom , boys and girls . 
  it 's ok as long as it 's not [ lady ] ( https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/ad_137583211.jpg ) . 
  more than miscommunication ; it 's likely that we get along so well because ni behaves quite similarly to ti . 
  perhaps i have met intj 's but i have n't successfully typed people as such yet ; so i kinda have to follow the thread on the stereotype . 
  having said that , i admire your folk for being able to get stuff done ; also for jumping straight to the `` meta '' of things and short-cut your way to success . 
  i dwell on the long path because of the fun of it : it 's kinda cool but not so functional ... 
  i have thought quite commonly about how would i handle situations if i were a teacher . 
  most likely i 'd be pretty laid back , but i 'd let the [ banhammer of justice ] ( https://unbanservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wow-ban-hammer.jpg ) fall upon them if it were necessary ( seductive female student , successful-in-sports-not-giving-a-shit-about-education sports jock types ), 
  ok , type does n't have anything to do with this . 
  this is an obvious motor coordination skill , and it does n't depend at all on the way you percieve things and the decisions you make to face problems ( personality ) . 
  so in order to get better you have to do the thing that works to develop any skill : ** practice , practice , practice ** ; in time , you 'll improve ; it does n't matter how hard you suck at the beginning . 
  we humans are hardwired to acquire skills that way ( it 's called `` neural pathways '' if you want to check some information on that ) . 
  also , as u/sugoruyo said , do n't give up . 
  ** edit ** : did n't scroll down to see his guide , it 's funny we thought about bolding the exact same things . 
  u/sugouyo : props for your guide , bro/sis ; it 's thorough and well-formatted , thank you for your time poured on this .

  i do n't think so ... 
   is there anything that science ca n't give us ? 
  happiness , material wealth and safety . 
  if the right policies are enforced within the right social context at the right time , then science will become a stepping stone towards achieving this -- at least it is easy to observe that the wealthiest countries have high education standards -- but definitely not on its own . 
  e.g : if you are an adventurous college professor and you want to venture to nigeria to bring higher standards of living through education alone , i think you will be disappointed ( asuming you 're still alive and in one piece ) . 
   is there something other than science that is superior to providing us with knowledge ? 
  i do n't think so ... 
  it 's kind of science 's business to unravel knowledge for us to know how thing work and design systems to take advantage of them . 
  but we have to be aware of the limitations of science : pure theory can not make up for experience on some areas of life , and we have to deal with the fact that some of us need to fulfill a spiritual need in our lives ; it 's a human need and it is off limits of science , or at least that 's the current status , in my opinion . 
   is n't technically everything science if you approach it in the right way ? 
  the grammatical construct with which you phrased that leads me to think it 's not : take art for example ; is art a field of science ?
