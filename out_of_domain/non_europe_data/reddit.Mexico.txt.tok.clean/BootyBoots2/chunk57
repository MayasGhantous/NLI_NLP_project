  art is an expression of the human psyche embodied through a physical mean to be percieved by other human through his/her senses and it may or may not be intended to provoke an emotional reaction ( that 's my definition , by the way ; i do n't know if the un has a board of artistry with their own definition or something ) . 
  is there science * contained * within art ? 
  of course : there 's optics within all of the fine arts except probably for music . 
  there 's acoustics for music and psychology for cinema and theatre . 
  math has been associated with music for centuries . 
  moreover techniques have been developed to increase the aesthetics of each discipline across the fine arts and all other ones ; that is knowledge on its own but i would n't consider a piece of art to be knowledge . 
  why do n't you write a witty post-it and leave it on your car to be found by your would-be-valentine ? 
  take advantage to set a meeting so you 'll know if he ( or she ? ), 
  just likes your car or you . 
  an obvious advantage of this is that you can arrange a meeting on a convenient place at plain daylight , or a crowded place or have it any way you want it to be . 
   if you mean superior with regards to it 's level of certainty , then clearly formal logic is superior to science , as logic is deductively certain by definition whereas science is essentially probability based .

  check out r/intpcirclejerk . 
  i wonder if enfx 's would laugh or be offended by this gem ... 
  perphaps his situation is kind of a loop or more like a vicious circle : due to it 's cyclical nature it 's quite difficult to get out of . 
  him and wookie keep posting the same over and over and over , thus contibuting greatly to the depressive undertone of this sub . 
  i wonder is the sudanese , russian , indian or any other country with secessionist portions of its territories are as bitchy as israel ... 
  more so considering israel is a world power while palestine 's greatest achievement is to be recognized in the un as a country ( although being recognized as a nation is quite an achievement considering the stuborness and power of israel and the us ) . 
  i admire you for posting on the * correct * subreddit . 
  keep it up . 
  also fuck estjs , they 're supposed to be a `` thinking '' type but they are absolute jerks and manipulative ne'er - do-wells . 
  fellow outsider here . 
  today 's morning i was thinking about how low bernie did on the primaries and what would happen if trump becomes president . 
  i 'm not exhaustively informed about both of them but i get the impression that if trump wins , it 'll be a win * for the establishment * : the exact opposite of what voters want . 
  because when he gets to the oval office and demonstrates how unfit he is to take office `` the power behind the throne '' will show up , leading his decisions and effectively exerting their political agenda . 
  and who would that be ? 
  the establishment . 
  the people who * excel * at politics . 
  the most experienced and influential politicians who do n't like the spotlight . 
  power voids are always filled quickly . 
  take a look at irak . 
  wow . 
  i 'm frankly surprised by this statement . 
  up a few comments there 's someone who will vote for trump based on how hillary 's deceiving eyes look . 
  but you do have a well articulated opinion -- and in my own opinion -- that 's valuable to know why reasonable bernie supporters would make such a radical and seemingly stupid decision as voting for trump . 
  yet there 's one sentence that tingles me :, 
   i 'd vote trump because a trump presidency would likely be a shortcut to the worst-case scenario that americans need to finally push the reset button on this electoral process . 
  through history , the us president has repeatedly call himself `` the leader of the free world '' . 
  consider this to be true . 
  can the us and the rest of the free world afford pushing the reset button right now ?

  i honestly thought they were stereotypical mexicans . 
  i 'm not american , but it becomes obvious after a while that reddit 's userbase is primarily american , this means we get a flavor of america 's drama on the frontpage / r/all at all times . 
  at first it 's amusing but boy , it becomes tiring after a while . 
  and it 's always the same issues . 
  * tully . 
  rekt . 
   the `` free world '' is just the anglosphere + western europe anyway . 
  i was talking about other countries that do depend on the us for commerce , because what i had in mind was a broader span : countries that are not ruled by dictatorships/miliatry regimes . 
   they ca n't afford to wait much longer , because that button 's not going to be available forever . 
  if you stick with hillary clinton for 8 years , the parties will regain control by 2024 , and the world will look no brighter then . 
  i agree . 
  but , at which cost ? 
  if trump wins , it wo n't be long before the really experienced politicians and influencial people in the us will make trump his puppet , one way or another . 
  power vacuums do n't last for long . 
  i think the real win for the establishment is a trump victory , not a hillary . 
  or maybe power will just switch hands on the white house , i do n't know ... 
  but taking into account the massive displacement of people isis caused and the change in demographics in europe , plus the instability within the middle east and how little regard trump has for other countries other than `` no non-christian , european , white people allowed anymore '' and `` i love israel , let 's bomb some arabs '', 
   no one could genuinely believe that without being way deep in the tank for shillary . 
  perhaps , i think i did n't express myself correctly : the us exerts a tremendous amount of power , therefore there will be people attracted to it because it 's the nature of the humankind . 
  now , it 's likely that with such a change as donald trump new players will step in , in addition to * other ones * who will not waste the chance to become richer or more powerful but could n't under the obama era . 
  so perhaps the current players will further consolidate their power if hillary wins ( which i presume it 's going to be awful for american people but i do n't know because i 'm not american in the first place ) , but if trump does , then there will be a turnabout and new players will take the places of the old ones ; so it will just be a change of hands , but not a structural reform . 
  in the meantime , we do n't know what kind of idiocies trump will be capable of -- although saying he will trigger ww3 seems quite frankly absurd -- that hillary wo n't do because she 's quite experienced in politics ( actually , it seems her sin is being * too experienced * ) . 
  it 's those kind of idiocies i 'm concerned about because in the us , mistakes can be fatal . 
  appoint the wrong justice and the country could stagnate for decades , sign a wrong deal and a recession could follow , invade the wrong country ... you get my point . 
  but that 's just me . 
  maybe i 'm saying bullshit , maybe not . 
  time will tell . 
  god bless america .
