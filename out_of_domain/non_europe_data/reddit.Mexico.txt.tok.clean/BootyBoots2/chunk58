  awesome !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i also noticed the site is in spanish . 
  nice detail , amigo . 
  nope , it 's spanish . 
  can confirm . 
  source : mexican . 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  i saw a video of yours on youtube you posted here , once . 
  i plan to become an animator and submit my toons to youtube . 
  of course , i first need to draw ... 
  once i saw a chart about type distribution ( for the us ) . 
  turns out we 're 5 % for males but it balances to 3 % becuase intp females are super rare ; i think under 1 % ( intp females are just as rare as infj 's or intj 's in general ) . 
  did n't bother to look for the source because :, 
  * i 'm lazy ( as we know it ), 
  * i tend to distrust percentages . 
  i had n't watched rick and morty at this point . 
  i have a lot to catch on with ... 
  that 's a pretty neat approach to it ( correlating intelligence to the intp type ) . 
  but in order to have better claims for your * hypothesis * the assumption that the intp type is the most intelligent ( and that the probability of people scoring intp is overwhelmingly higher as iq rises ) has to be very well founded . 
  here in mexico , april fools day is celebrated on december 28 because of a common language/cultural misnomer : december 28 is the day of the innocents and , at least here in mexico some people condescendingly call oblivious/distracted/fool people `` innocent '' . 
  why do americans prank people on april the 1st ? 
  where do that tradition stems from ? 
  god-fearing people wo n't use polyester and wool coats . 
  also , i demand women to let me know if they are in their period before i greet them . 
  i would n't want to be impure for the rest of the day . 
  and who would want their stuff contaminated for weeks ? 
  not me . 
  if you excuse me , i have a few pigeons and goats i need to sacrifice in holocaust as a pay for the sin of existing . 
  same . 
  but it has the effect of making me turn my inner youtube and replay the awesome ( according to myself ) images my brain spouts when i imagine things because of music . 
  i can get stuck for hours there . 
  not correcting , but participating a lot on discussion and exposing alternate points of view . 
  i stopped doing it not because of shyness but because i learned the hard way that others find me obnoxious -- though i try to be nice all the time -- so now i speak to the professor in private . 
  it 's important to notice that regardless of intelligence , there will be certain situations ( even if rare ) where we will take decisions based on feelings because we have evolved to do so . 
  from the perspective of evolutionary psychology , for hundreds of years siding with a coward/indecisive person meant death , so it makes sense that projecting confidence is necessary for leaders . 
  in defense of nature , that defense mechanism is state-of-the-art . 
  we do n't have claws or shells , tusks , etc. 
  we ca n't fly or run/swim fast . 
  the only thing we have going for us is a luxury item : an energy-draining brain . 
  but it 's because of the wonders of the rational an irrational parts of the brain we have thrived to the point of being a plague ( oh , human reproduction only spawns one of us an takes forever compared to bugs so we ca n't use their strategy -- continuum of species via insane reproduction rate -- either ) . 
  what a time to be alive !, 
  we are so advanced at this point we need to get rid of the primitive minds that let us survive for so long in order to not self-destruct . 
  ok . ** mathematical correlation * describes * one feature in terms of the other ( s ) ** ( e.g : cod fish 's lenght and age are correlated so measuring the lenght of a given cod can let you know how old it is ) . 
  that does n't necesarily means causation although , ** in simple events such correlation * can * mean one event is caused by the other ** . 
  i read intps are good at iq tests because our perception -- guided by our personality accroding to mbti -- helps us greatly in that specific kind of tests ; but ** in my opinion , intelligence varies greatly depending on various features ** -- some of them unmeasurable -- like genetics , the socio-economic environment , the emotional state of the person at the time of testing , nutrition etc. 
  ** therefore , it would n't be very reliable to assert that intp type causes having a higher iq or vice-versa ** . 
  ** however , if it 's reasonably true ** ( test of hypothesis ) ** that mbti type and iq are correlated , then your assertions that intp females are rare based on how rare exceptionally intelligent women are could be deemed as true ** . 
  in other light , if almost everybody who belong to a given group * are * a given type -- ( stereotypically , just an example ) worshipping services for infjs , performing a certain sport for estps , charity for infps , military for estjs , etc. -- you could infer with a high confidence percentage that a person belongs to that type if said person joined that group and feels highly satisfied on it . 
  i am not a matematician . 
  but perhaps u/jsurata could shed more light on this topic , as she is a top-notch math . 
  no ... decimals are not to be trusted either . 
  they could stab you in the back while you sleep . 
  i said i distrust percentages because they stem from a pool of data , anyone can make up a number but in order to check percentages , you 'd need to have access to said pool of data to verify if it 's reliable . 
  it 's just me ... 
  no , it is n't but the numbers are quite close . 
  we are not that uncommon -- speaking about males -- we 're the most common analyst type and xnfj 's are both rarer than us . 
  making up for the 6th rarest or 10th most common type . 
  i 'm not a special snowflake . 
  you are welcome . 
  wear what you please . 
  alas , i love when women wear skirts ; that 's pretty much one of the few gender constructs i have left . 
  i 'll take a woman wearing a long skirt over a sexually appealing outfit anytime . 
  personally , i think it 's a shame the `` dress culture '' is falling into oblivion a this point . 
  i love your flair . 
  `` el que no tranza , no avanza '' -- common mexican saying that means `` that who does n't cheat , does n't move forward '' . 
  the worst part is that the saying holds true in fucked up parts of mexico -- and the world in general -- so it preserves the culture of corruption : while effectively preserving/improving people 's lives at some point it reinforces the belief which in turn reinforces the corruption that caused such adverse conditions in the first place ; repeating the vicious circle . 
  i agree with your thoughts entirely . 
  there 's just one itty bitty problem :, 
  abrahamic reiligions come with a built-in set of limiting -- albeit on it 's time edifying , i recognize -- laws that are incompatible with modern societies nowadays ( torah , shar ` ia or the [ j+m kansas bill ] ( http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/kansas-gov-signs-anti-abortion-bill-article-1.1322804 ) ) . 
  people can get very stubborn on it because they believe god 's law necessarily needs to be perfect , taking into account it stems from a perfect god ; thus making it impossible to push for modern laws that allow freedom and a better quality of life in general . 
  in other words , they tend to fossilize . 
  well , it 's all fun and games until the druglords get out of control and power-hungry presidents slay peaceful protestors for prostesting against the ludicrous expenditures of the olympics ... 
  to further the joke , there are americans who say : `` they should try to improve their country in the first place '' . 
  like if have not tried . 
  like if we have not bled . 
  it 's simple . 
  you did n't invest emotionally on your aunt enough to weep her death , but you did invest emotionally on your ex . 
  you think this is funny ? 
  ** well , it is not !! ** . 
  donald trump thinks he can stop uuuuus but he ca n't !!, 
  ** and when he gets to that oooooffice . 
  lem me say it again !!, 
  when he gets that office ** we 're gon na immigrate so hard !!, 
  ** that not even dr. phil will cuuuuure his butthurt ... 
  [ i 'm telling you donald ] ( http://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/001/866/715/randy_savage_crop_exact.png?w=1500&amp;h=1500&amp;q=85 ) . 
  you do n't wan na mess with uuuuus ... 
  since i do n't live in the us , i do n't know for certain , but it looks plausible so ... * yes * ? 
  more than fluctuating , it 's * rising * . 
  there 's evidence on that and it 's a worrysome problem for the whole world . 
  pollution can be correlated to periods of greater economic activities so there is sufficient proof to assert the current state of temperature rising is man-made . 
  therefore the international community should play a part in regulating it 's economic activities to comply with standards of gas emission and other polluting agents . 
  especially the us and china . 
  but we already know it 's not going to happen , anyway ... 
  that depends on your view of what a true conservative is . 
  of course !, 
  ( ** yes ** ) you can have a different point of view and still care about the best interests of the people of your nationality . 
  since the question asks me to choose the statement that is * closer * -- does n't mean i share it -- to my opinion , then c. [ here 's my take on it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/comments/3jwva0/why_are_abortion_gay_rights_etc_such_big_issues/cvp0v52?context=3 ) if you 're interested . 
  none of the above . 
  american permission to keep a dangerous tool used to efficient murder because of paranoia sounds more like it . 
  it appeared to be arms were to be used on militias to prevent a tyrannical government , but thanks to the 2008 ruling ( columbia vs. heller ) militias are not needed : you can keep them to your hearts content .
