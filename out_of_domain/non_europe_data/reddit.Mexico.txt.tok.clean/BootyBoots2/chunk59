  d sounds like a reasonable patch although a temporary one . 
  perhaps solution a will be needed on the long run .

  google told me it 's called `` commerce clause '' . 
  again , google told me the missing word is `` socialist '' . 
  ** yes ** . 
  there are lots of people working for the government and they do receive their salaries from it , so yes ; this is sufficient proof . 
  speaking about the new dollar print , the motto is `` in god we trust '' . 
  the older one was `` e pluribus unum '' ( out of many , one ) . 
  ** yes ** . 
  police needs the tools necessary to fight crime ; since criminals can acquire ammunitions and weapons from legal ( us ) and illegal sources police , now more than ever , should be armed and ready to fight crime . 
  it should also be strenghtened in states and counties that require it but mostly it needs to be * scrutinized * and law makers should pass laws to prevent criminal police officers to go unpunished . 
  the attack on the world trade center occured -- as osama bin laden said -- due to retaliation because americans `` let '' israelis to attack lebanon . 
  so , apparently having a like-minded country to support on the middle east caused the greatest security breach on american soil since the attack on pearl harbor . 
  but that 's the word of terrorists , so you might as well dismiss it ... 
  personally i have n't perceived any security benefit to the us from israel . 
  of course it should ( ** yes ** ) . 
  it 's still a theory , but evidence strongly points it 's a fact . 
  personally i think there is enough evidence to deem it as a fact . 
  are you a mod ? 
  these are super controversial talking points . 
  i applaud your civility . 
  i 'm sharing your experience right now : a girls who loves me is becoming quite overburdening . 
  this makes me feel bad because i like her a lot too , and instead of attaching to a girl who loves me i feel freaked out by her great emotion ( friendzone effect ) . 
  that 's ... not cool at all , i know it because i 've been in the other side as well . 
  i feel guilty ... 
  anyway ... before you have sex with girls , make sure they 're not too emotional , otherwise they 'll become severly attached to you . 
  you 're not alone bro . 
  i feel the same too , and i know there 's something that need to be done about it . 
  more than an intp thing i think it 's more of a personal thing : the envirnment where you grew and your temperment greatly influences your decisions . 
  * it 's a trap !, 
  * do n't listen to their propaganda !,

   it 's more than a bit frustrating when our strongest weapon has no effect . 
  although , on a second thought there are brilliantly intelligent feelers with impressive thought processes ( that even leave ours to shame ) ; ask infj 's ... 
  i do n't know where that reference stems from , but it sure sounds awesome . 
  i know three efsps who are important in my life : mom , sister and girlfriend . 
  all very different amongst themselves . 
  my mom tends to let go by the moment and not give a single fuck about the future consequences of what she 's doing , so if she 's mad at * anyone * she will yell at * everybody * until she clams down ... from an early age , i became good at appeasing her , so now she can be pissed by everyone but happy towards me !, 
  my sister is elegant , intelligent and ** outgoing ** . 
  she feels trapped if she does n't go out with her friends every single friday . 
  she is fun and cool until she enters diva mode . 
  while in diva mode she feels not even european royalty deserves her . 
  my girlfriend is an intelligent , adventurous , free girl . 
  but she 's clingy . 
  she always writes to me and she talks to me on the phone for a long time ( a 30 minute long phone call is painful for me , i love her but i just want to hang so bad ... ) . 
  stereotypically , i think that 's something an xstp would say . 
  he does have an [ awesome song in spanish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk4srzceth4#t=0m18s ) , and is also featured in lots of cool animation clips . 
  you edgelord ... 
  it 's a different type of brilliance . 
  your ni is a true powerhouse , and actually it 's kind of blurry to me how ni differenciates from ti . 
  ti thinks about systems , ni connects the information on subjects rather than objects to connect for webs ; hence building systems ... 
  edit : i typed my uncle and i was sure he was istp , then i changed my prediction on intp based on how he speaks . 
  turned out to be enfp according to 16personalities . 
  still , he 's one of those people you can have deep , intellecual conversations . 
  i do n't know anyone i can converse like i do with him , and he 's a feeler . 
  damn , how confusing !, 
   then again , infjs are pretty quick door-slammers . 
  care to elaborate ? 
   intp ( intelligent people who are always willing to join me in on stupid ventures ), 
  lol yep , that 's me ... 
  i 've never met an infj in real life . 
  it would be cool to meet one . 
  spanish cultural appropriation , not mexican . 
  uh ... you know , if you 're going to write in spanish then stick to it . 
  if you 're going to write in english then stick to it . 
  i do n't know why people love sprinkling words of other languages into vernacular . 
  and yes , i can understand what you say in english perfectly . 
  i wish you the best , as well . 
  meh ... on each massive extintion , nature found the way for the next generation of life forms to become more powerful . 
  can you smell it ? 
  ahhhhh ... 
  the fragance of existencialist dilemma fiiiiiiillsss the aaaaiiir . 
  nazi germany was a painful reminder that it does n't matter how intelligent , orderly and disciplined -- qualities revered as the paramount of rationality -- a given settlement of people are ; ** under the correct circumstances we can all become tribal , bloodthirsty ** -- [ yet fashionable !, 
  we can not overcome our animal side , which is worse than actual animals because it becomes powered by cognition ; as far as i know animals do n't torture and the only way of premeditated assassination consists on stalking its pray but not quite the elaborate plan , but we can . 
  ** so in the upcoming millennia there will be wars , there will be raping , there will be maiming , there will be torture and all those things that on the dark side , make us human . 
  however , taking a quick look at today 's society and comparing it back to the most ancient forms of civilization we 've come a long way ** ; i mean : now we can cure diseases that for the most part of the existence of humankind were incurable ( and if you live in europe it 's covered by quality universal healthcare !, 
  ) , now there are functional democaracies ( very few but there are some ) , and complex justice systems that are lightyears away from laws such as the code of hammurabi ( one of the reasons why shar ` ia law is so despised by westerners ) . 
  so maybe ** perhaps in a very long time we will achieve the perfect society where no one has to suffer ** . 
  but several more centuries or millennia of suffering will still be necessary to achieve that . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** i 'd be perfectly fine if mankind were to extinct . 
  actually , engineering an extremely fast-spread , high-durability virus to infect people and grant them a painless death woud be very desirable . 
  the only argument against it is that the future is uncertain therefore it looks bright but distant ; and looking back , it 's possible we get there , although not on our lifetimes . 
  i see now !, 
  thanks for the explanation !, 
  being social is mostly an ability that has to do with feeling , i approach feelings as an animal , built-in , survival-oriented , primitive , analysis-less device to quickly assess situation that involve other animals . 
  the key to being social/loved/accepted is to play upon moves that will positively affect the feelings of other people . 
  ### step 1 : be comfortable with in your own skin, 
  people can infer others ' emotional states just by looking at them ; and broadly speaking , emotional states are contagious . 
  since nobody likes being depressed , they flee depressed people like if they were plague ; which further drepresses a depressed person . 
  so try not to feel down . 
  this takes us to step two . 
  ### step 2 : become less self-conscious . 
  i suggest three ways to do this :, 
  * stop taking yourself so seriously . 
  there are a wide variety of things you can do to increase your sense of humor such as watching comedy .
