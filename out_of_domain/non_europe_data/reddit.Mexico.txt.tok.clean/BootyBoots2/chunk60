  i personally enjoy listening , enjoying and mocking bad music , and then sharing the reasons why i find that music so bad with friends and family through talking and quite a bit of mimicking ( which looks ridiculous , makes other people laugh and helps you laugh at something * via yourself * ) . 
  * another route consists in directing your mental energy elsewhere . 
  not caring -- aka not giving a fuck -- means you 're not pouring energy or resources in a given object ( an event , condition , person , etc ) , therefore you wo n't be worried about something because you 're not thinking about yourself . 
  this will center your attention to the world that surrounds you instead of the chaos in your mind . 
  if you have a developed se this may be the path of least resistance . 
  [ there are exercises on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vx8iuvfycy ) . 
  ### step 3 : approach people . 
  once you 've overcome your anxiety ( in any ) , you can approach people and talk to them with the sole intention of bonding . 
  us , the human beings are still quite primitive and we love being in similar groups . 
  besides , every single stimulus of the environment will provoke a feeling , even if negligibly small ; so use that to your advantage : if you 're on public transport and see someone who looks interesting and is just waiting to get there , then there is n't a better time to approach . 
  go talk to him/her because the emotional impact of somebody wanting to meet you is different and exciting , while waiting is unnerving . 
  if you get rejected , do n't despair !, 
  it 's not you , it 's most likely them being on a bad mood because of causes completely unrelated to you . 
  a warning : you want to avoid topics that involve disgust , grief or an identity clash since these emotions are powerful and negative ( e.g : vomit , 9/11 if speaking to an american , politics , etc ) . 
  talk about anything but these . 
  if you 're posting this , it means your extraverted feeling is not very developed . 
  do not despair ; in time you will develop it more and more and there will come a point where your `` gut feeling '' will direct or make you aware of pitfalls . 
  do turn back to thinking : analytical skills will be of little to no help you here . 
  trust me on this one . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : clear your mind , remember the principle that people love to be talked to and start friendly , easy going , fun conversations with people for the sake of bonding with them . 
   i have decided to delete this post in a couple of hours since it now seems like not such a good idea to get feedback about the complexity of emotions , life and relationships from strangers on the internet on the basis of a paragraph . 
  how come ? 
  i think its quite an intelligent idea to keep this for future references : after all ; is n't knowledge , power ? 
  are you , by chance , american ? 
  oh , yet more sage advice from the supreme overlord of r/seduction !, 
  mind you : perhaps i 've been reading a little too much r/the _ donald lately , which may have wildly biased my perception of american society ... 
  although the bullet points you describe are common to all nations , they also seem exacerbated in the us . 
  since political opinions are polarized , people quickly become really stubborn about what the other side has to say ( and yes , that also happens to the left side of the spectrum ) , so there goes point # 1 : typical viced communication . 
  to be fair we all do that on a certain degree , and if you do n't care about the `` envelope '' of your message , people will completely disregard it ( newscasters joked -- and are still joking -- about carson 's speech ) . 
  well-articulated speech is important ; ideally we should only focus on the content of the message but we can not get rid of the emotional component of the emission of that message . 
  structures exist for a reason : they work . 
  on the context you are , all those dumb traditions have served ( or still serve ) a purpose and they are basic units in the preservation of that system . 
  if the social system relies on religion , then you 'd expect religious traditions to be observed strictly , otherwise the system would fall apart . 
  traditions , rules and laws have to be scrutinized and reviewed to change or remove the parts that become obsolete ; but of course , that 's where our rationalist mind guides us . 
  for the sentinel , iconoclasm is what anti-intellectuallism is for us . 
  but we still need to change once in a while to not become fossilized . 
  feelers ... 
  i 'll briefly revisit my point : people have evolved from a primitive state , but nature shapes primitive states to be harwired for a long time , and in this marvelous time we 've come to the point where we finally need to dispose many aspects of those states ; but un-doing nature 's evolutionary survival mechanisms is no easy task . 
  just develop feelings and go with the flow ... for our own good , i have to work on it as well , brother . 
  are you one of those people who does n't pour much effort or thought about what you 're wearing ? 
  i am , and i clash with people whose eyes * bleed * because i wore random shoes with a random pair of pants and top that with a random shirt . 
  i sincerely dgaf ( attribute that to lack of se if you want ) . 
  now , there are people who dgaf about thinking because it 's not an important function in their lives and they have other working mechanisms for survival that are well suited for them ... 
  ** edit : ** what 's up with the downvoting ? 
  is it simple disagreement or something else ? 
  it would be interesting to know . 
  and yes , feel free to keep doing it if you please . 
  talk about a non-judgmental article , eh ? 
   what assurance ( if any ) would you tell your so if you knew it would help them tone it down ? 
  woah . . tough question !, 
  well , it turns out to be i 'm a magnet for intense , sentimental girls . 
  therefore , i think it would be very difficult to try to communicate to them in such a way i do n't mess up with their feels . 
   do you guys ever suspect or identify neediness in yourselves ? 
  personally , i like [ manson 's definition ] ( http://postmasculine.com/understanding-neediness ) as it enables me to quickly assess if i 'm being needy . 
  am i spending too much resources ( energy , thought , money ) on x person ? 
  public . 
  nudity . 
  ( or worse yet , public sexual behavior ), 
  yes , you 're free to display your sexuality at will for your couple/audience ; but looking for a private place to do so is really not much to ask for ... 
   fuck ... its ... its ... 
  removed ? 
   haha , hypothetically !, 
  if you were somehow promised that while they would be intense and upset in the moment , it would help in the future - would that encourage you to just say it ? 
  oh , god ... you 're pressing me . 
  gahhh !, 
  yes !, 
  but i would struggle a lot : i really hate to see girls i love crying because of my fault . 
  it 's heartbreaking to me , but i 'd force myself for her . 
  and now i find myself filling the politician 's shoes : not actually answering questions asked , lol . 
  what assurance would i tell them to tone it down ? 
  specifically , i do n't know ; i have n't constructed a sentence in my mind . 
  when i get one , i promise to share it with you . 
   i 've always held onto the traditional version of `` wanting x and x from x person that they are unable or unwilling to satisfy '' - not on this version of `` giving x and x to x person to satisfy yourself '' . 
  it 's a little mind-blowing . 
  i know right ? 
  his treatise on dating -- models -- is ... it is ... it 's the fucking [ * principia * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philosophi%c3%a6_naturalis_principia_mathematica ) of dating , the [ no-slip condition ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no-slip_condition ) of romance . 
  [ * sniffs and rubs off a single tear * ] [ so beautiful ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etves23djxm#t=1m10s ) . 
  i 've seen you regularly at r/intp . 
  out of curiosity , what 's your iq ? 
  i 'm organized in some aspects of my life . 
  for example , i follow step by step instructions when setting up a device ( except for cellphones : i keep instruction booklets for reference rather than reading them before using them ) and i also follow safety guidelines almost religiously ... 
  i also keep my environment clean and tidy but only as a part of a system i built to have a clean house for most of the time . 
   intp with mild ocd ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  i 'm really * really * tolerant to untidiness : that 's why i developed the system in the first place ( assuming a descriptive aspect of people with ocd is always keeping their stuff clean and tidy ) . 
  my dad -- esfj -- is an airplane pilot and therefore i was taught to follow safety guidances and warnings since i was very young . 
  in aeronautics like in everyday life , little safety practices can make up for huge differences ; so why not enforcing them ? 
  ( i see this as the small sj component of my personality lol ), 
  well ... 
  houses were chosen around the `` essence '' of oneself , but their skillsets were independent of the stereotype of the house ( look no further than the differences between ron and hermione ; but also cedric diggory -- hufflepuff -- was hogwarts ' champion at the same level that harry was on , snape was a potions prodigy although the smart ones are suposed to be the ravenclaws , the list goes on ) . 
  also , what 's up with gay people ? 
  the most powerful , wise and intelligent character of hp was homosexual , indeed . 
  the game of thrones environment works in an entirerly different way than harry potter does because of the social context : game of thrones is a harsh medieval environment where acquiring privilege -- and withholding it -- was the top priority ; whereas in hp we 're talking about modern magical britain , with a complex democratic and judicial system ( compared to `` just send all of them to the wall '' or plain absolutism ) that is built to fulfill the needs of the people , not of the regents . 
  but even so , there were the dark times where an extremely powerful dark lord joined by an unstoppable entourage of criminals would murder , control and torture at will . 
  that alone sounds got-esque . 
  sounds plausible . 
  well , it looks like our rational minds do not quite immunize us from tribal behavior . 
  thanks for the feedback . 
  about procrastination in studying , i work in the same way you do ( to be fair that also holds for housecleaning but not quite since i implemented the system ) . 
  we must start seeing stress as a limitation rather than as an engine .
