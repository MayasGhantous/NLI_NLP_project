  and the winner for the most passive-aggressive comment goes to ...

  i did test all of my family members with the 16personalities test though . 
  my sister is the other sentinel -- the dreaded estj -- and she 's not douchey at all . 
  i like her a lot . 
  at one point in my life , i 'd like to have a rationalist girlfriend to see how it 's like ... 
  i thought the `` i rebel '' one-liner was the sound featured here .

  are its irises colored that way because of age ? 
  i do stack my coins that , although i do n't know what it has to do with intpness . 
  not quite . 
  i embrace my outliers because they make me stronger . 
  i see mbti like if our type was a dog breed : the more they stick to the canon , the more problems they will have but the more `` pure '' the dog will be . 
  inbreeding `` refines '' the race and breeding with other races yields an ordinary -- but healthier -- dog . 
  in the same page , abusing rational analysis ( ti ) causes huge problems with social adaptation because of the lack of `` social common sense '' ( fe ) . 
  being too intuitive can even be dangerous as you 're incesantly thinking about possibilities to the point of not looking to see if a car is coming towards you on the street you 're crossing . 
  the finer the pedigree , the more problems a specific dog breed will have . 
  the more a person embodies the stereotype of a mbti type the more type-specific problems the person will have . 
   i imagine being in touch with my feminine side contributes to being more in touch with my feelings . 
  great !, 
  can we sing [ do n't go breaking my heart ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqmrgfzg0ji ) in duet ? 
  choose if you want to be elton or kiki . 
  i feel comfortable singing either part .

  i love disney . 
  it has buit a legacy in more than one way : excellent animation , a huge theme park and resort -- i think the concept of disneyland was ahead of its time -- great music , and recently they have demonstrated that they can venture on doing great movies out of concepts that are quite foreign to their original works ( see how tfa and some superhero movies worked out ) . 
  my favorite movie is actually a disney one : the hunchback of notre-dame . 
  and that 's the reason i 'm sad at seeing how the markets are adapting to ideologies ( either conservative or sjw ) ; awesome movies like that wo n't be possible today . 
   that would be so rude b-baka,

  well , as a usual text wall writer i have to tell you it 's important that you break the text in pieces where the sto ... 
  you know what ? 
  fuck it . 
  the story was so interesting and well written i 'm not gon na bitch about not formatting your text wall . 
  and the prick even teases it further . 
  just did it . 
  could you provide some examples please ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious about your point . 
  there is an interesting trend now : some people want the establishment to step down so bad , they are willing to elect trump * so everything collapses * . 
  and then , after having gotten rid of the plague , rebuild a new one ; one that works for the people once again . 
  what they are probably not taking into consideration is that when things burn down to the ground , re-building is necessary and the people who harness enough power to do the re-building may not necessarily be the ones who those who wanted the system to burn in the first place wanted them to be . 
  * what if it ca n't be re-built ? 
  ( what if there were a social , political or economic factor -- domestic or foreign -- that wipes out the possibility or re-building it properly ? ), 
  * have people got a back up plan if all else fails ? 
  * who do they think will take care of re-building the us political system post-trump wreckage ? 
  * what possitive structures of american government necessary for the allies of the us will be broken after trump ? 
  is it worth sacrificing those ? 
  * have n't you considered the possibility of trump being so unfit for the presidency that he will be subjected to another 's bid ? 
  ( like bush to cheney , as some people say . ), 
  although i 'm positive that some american people desperately plea for -- radical -- change , i do n't think they agree on how it should change or to which extent . 
  some of them even want to even get rid of the two-party system . 
  from a mexican perspective , the problem of the multi-party system is that if there is not a very high level of transparency , corruption transforms a good-on-paper system into a feudal clash for control . 
  what is the most intelligent -- careful , i 'm not talking about the `` least stupid '' -- course of action ?

  perhaps * i * would be the sentimental , intense guy on that relationship . 
  feel-wise , we 're not persistent ( or consistent ) at all : we want to be loved and desired but not too much so we feel choked by it . 
  sometimes we want someone badly and when he/she finally recedes we lose interest quickly . 
  who read this article ? 
  my opinion coincides quite a lot with yours . 
  thank you for your thorough reply . 
  i ask this because since i 'm not so intelligent ( you guys are the top 2 % after all ) , and i try to connect the dots about how school works . 
  and because of my strife , my point is to get across school sucessfully , period . 
  it sounds like common sense to me that you mensa members should breeze though it , because you 're geniouses or at least gifted people ; what is not so obvious is that there are other factors that hinder your grading and that intelligence is not magic : even if you 're gifted you will fail school if you do n't work . 
  you * have * to work at some point as not even very high intelligence is a guarantee of success under the current educational model . 
  the question is how ? , when ? , how much ? , how do we increase the efficency of studying for so to speak ? 
   their intuition works in a manner that creates logically inaccurate scenarios based on a feeling construct . 
  frankly , i have never met -- or realized i met -- an infj but judging from the posts written from infjs i have read it seems like quite the opposite : they make up for excellent computer programmers -- who work within a strict logical environment -- and are capable of impressive analyses like [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/41gpkx/typing_for_beginners_part_1_the_squarerectangle/ ) . 
  although the feeling component is secondary , dominant ni can get aid from tertiary ti ; and a ni-ti loop should be a logical force to be reckoned with ( look at xntjs ), 
   when said advice is not helpful or even wanted by a person ( who has already rigorously thought through a problem ) . 
  the infj literally has no idea how to react , they simply go into an emotional melt down . 
  that really sounds like a fi-dom problem , not at secondary fe one . 
  a fe-dom problem sounds like being cornered in an awkward clash of cultures where you ca n't avoid pissing someone off . 
  but well , that 's coming from an armchair theorist , i guess . 
  my mbti mantra is to never take it as the periodic table for people . 
  it may be put to use successfully like that on a sketchy , yet not exact way ( which does n't take away its merit or usefulness ) yielding decent results ; but precisely because of the fact that is not exact , you can not trust 100 % on the type 's various descriptions ( general personality , work and personal relationships , etc ) . 
  ** edit ** : just realized xntj 's work on a ni-t * e * loop . 
  well , sometimes i look at their ni as a somewhat different version of ti ; [ so infjs get another ti .

  more impressively , he * outran * that thing ... 
  i 'd like to thank you for the effort you 're willing to make to help this student . 
  remembering my first -- disastrous -- crush , ** i 'd recommend that after a session you invite him to somewhere where you two can speak privately ; then have an honest , adult conversation about what he feels and make it clear that you 're not interested on him romantically ** but you do value himself in another regard ( as a student or friend ) . 
  if you do not pop his bubble early , * he will suffer a lot * later ; our rationalist hearts are quite different to those of the feelers . 
  when i was in high school i fell not for a teacher but for a classmate . 
  god , she was * perfect * . 
  she had -- and still has -- a beautiful , pale face , a smile that can light up a town ( yes , i 'm unapologetically stealing that line from taylor swift ) , a fairly small waist and wide hips , elegant demeanor , an extremely smart and extremely happy girl who even at this point -- 6 years after high school -- the closest i have ever met to female perfection . 
  basically galadriel minus the blue alter ego . 
  it was painfully obvious that i fell for her and she avoided me like if i was sick with ebola . 
  this was unnecessary , you know : all i wanted was to tell her i loved her so she would reject me properly and i would be fine : i was terrified to death about a `` yes '' ( thought process : wooohooo !!!, 
  ... now what ? ) . 
  but rejecting me like that , oh god ... that hurt every ounce of the little pride i had left . 
  naturally , i cried my way out in 6 purging months ; please do n't be like that . 
   after losing friends , i no longer participate in political discussions with most people . 
  this is genuinely sad . 
  most probably you have already figured this out but , you do n't have to close your opinions to everybody ; just the ones you know they are -- consciously -- completely closed to new/opposed ideas or the ones who rely so much in feeling they will actually disregard facts while accepting any media that aligns with their views/values . 
  i downvoted your comment not because i disliked it , but because insanity wolf is perfectly suited for it . 
  that was all i needed at that age . 
  we are quite different indeed ...
