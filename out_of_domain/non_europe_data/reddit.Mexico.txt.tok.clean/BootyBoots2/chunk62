  i 'm actually booty-kun , not booty-chan . 
  it 's got nothing to do with it but damn , [ your writing sure is fancy ] ( https://readability-score.com/ ) ( copy and paste any of your comments on the box ) . 
  i agree with you wholeheartedly . 
  the problem for most of us intps is that , although we rebel about regulations that are outdated or unnecessary in our minds , -- so we could attain maximum freedom -- we are still quite constrained by our own morality : in other words , we need rules , and we comply to the ones that are consistent , `` better '' in the broad sense of the word , and the ones that coincide with our personal values ( still subject to scrutiny ) . 
  i suspect u/firebird5637 is quite an intelligent person , therefore his/her frontal cortex does n't let him/her `` just let go '' and enjoy many things out there . 
  firebird , i 'd reccomend you to practice mindfulness meditation ; you do n't need to emulate the behavior of a psychopath in order to let go . 
  i definitely ca n't speak for all of us , but in my personal case -- anectodal evidence , as so many like to call it these days -- i suffered because the rejection was worse than she could imagine : maybe she did n't want to confront me and reject me so i would n't be heartbroken ( perfectly understandable ) . 
  but when she abandoned me like that ( not even flinching after staring at her for long periods of time so i could receive some crumbs of negative attention ; that 's how lonely i felt ) , she did n't just reject my proposal of relationship , she rejected the very foundation of myself . 
  i was invisible and worthless . 
  so i went back to retreat in my cave and [ slayed some locusts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhwb1mt9q6w&amp;list=plbfb0840b12331606 ) . 
  but it only distracted me for a while : as soon as i put the controller down the grief struck me once again . 
  i became sadder and sadder until i cried my eyes out for 45 minutes listening to 80 's love songs . 
  and then the sun did n't shine as much but it was acceptable , and i 'd fall back into sadness , rinse and repeat the process until the periods before a crying session became gradually wider and fade out . 
  six months of agony , but in retrospect , think it went great for me in comparison to other people . 
  all i wanted was to tell her i loved her so she could reject me and i did n't torture myself for not having the balls to tell her that . 
  instead she evaded me and i felt worthless and abandoned . 
  god fucking dammit . 
  i analized your comments paragraph-by paragrapgh to prove you your overly complicated comment is not efficient -- nor effective -- at all and i hit the refresh button , and now it 's lost . 
  always save your text walls . 
   how long did you wait before you told her that you were interested in having a relationship with her ? 
  i never did . 
  i was always ready to `` declare '' myself to her but i procrastinated to find the `` perfect '' time to do so . 
   time and friendships will heal your wounds . 
  they already healed , thank you !, 
  those wounds made me evolve into other problems that i will solve to grow as a person . 
   i 'd take my own advice , and jump into another relationship , except , no one comes close . 
  after i was done with this girl , i closed myself off until i met my first girlfriend and then i finally knew the `` magic '' of relationships . 
  when i finished my relationship with her i realized that waiting until your prince -- or princess in my case -- comes only holds true for romantic comedies . 
  * go for them * . 
  oh , i get it now !, 
  i understand your point . 
  i read once that the frontal cortex is most active when in complex thinking and also brain imaging shows their frontal cortex activity quite reduced in the mind of psychopaths in comparison to sane people . 
  but that 's something a remember, 
  hypno-foam . 
  hmmmm ... she already knew i loved her , i mean , you could notice miles away ; that was the exact reason why she abandoned me . 
  * i wanted her to reject me * but i was expecting her to reject me through words , not through coldness that rivals the artic . 
  but i guess i did get closure ... 
  [ drop the payload , now !,

  there are different `` levels '' of right-wing or left wing policies . 
  we mexicans could be considered leftist in comparison to americans , but we could come off as rightists in comparison to the rest of latin america . 
  if i had to pigeonhole myself somewhere , i 'd say center right . 
  although one question comes up to mind : what is the scale ? 
  nazism -- talking about extreme right -- on one side and soviet/north korean communism for the left side ? 
  and if i 'm right , that means the reich is in the right , but that does n't mean they were right , right ? 
  i 'll write the wright brothers ( pioneers in flight ) a plight with all my might for them to fight for what is light and bright .

  i think i support the [ horseshoe theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horseshoe_theory ) now .

  thank you . 
  dr. j , i 'm starting to think you 're basically the gallowboob of r/intp . 
  yes , i have also noticed some patterns and trends within reddit but i 'm not so infatuated with it right now to kickstart my reddit domination plan . 
  however , a handful observations wo n't hurt anybody :, 
  * ** first and foremost , reddit 's userbase is overwhelmingly american ** . 
  followed by it comes a large european userbase ( that 's the reason why we wo n't stop getting ~ ~ littered ~ ~ informed about the current state of ~ ~ drama ~ ~ actions about the us presidential race in r/politics , r/sandersforpresident and r/the _ donald in r/all until november , when i believe the gates of tartarus get opened by darth vader riding a dragon or something ) . 
  besides , [ every single time the us gets cold ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/museumofreddit/comments/1iv343/the_boston_bombing_debacle/ ) , reddit gets hypothermia ( or rage ? ) . 
  * ** the default subs are quite important , as most of the frontpage ** ( which coincides with r/all for those who have n't changed their subscriptions in any way ) ** posts stem from those ** . 
  frontpage submissions typically include :, 
  novelties . 
  ( include arts and crafts , technology posts , etc ), 
  coverage of news relevant to american interests . 
  articles that deal with people ( amas , tifus , jokes , coverage of news relevant to word interests , etc. ) . 
  pornograhpy ( reddit apparently now loves r/bustypetite ) . 
  * ** it 's common for a popular thread on one of the default subs that primarily deal with people to start a trend ** ( usually til , tifu or askreddit : the only case where a self post makes it to r/all ) . 
  * i have n't had my first cake day , but according to what i 've read on r/museumofreddit ** there are certain events once in a while that make reddit go crazy , like the fappening ** or the takedown of certain -- popular ! -- hate subs ( ellen pao drama ) . 
  to expand on this point , my hypothesis is that reddit fears to be silenced , so it will get as far as staunchly defend hate subs for the sake of free speech ( add the fact that racism and xenophobia -- and its derivatives -- are everyday american -- nowadays , also european because of the refugee crisis -- controversy talking points ) . 
  * taking the above points in consideration , plus adding the case of being an admin posting relevant information about sidewide changes or improvements ; ** a self post will hardly ever reach r/all [ or else , it has to be extremely emotional or appealing to a current event ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/starwars/comments/3qvj6w/theory_jar_jar_binks_was_a_trained_force_user/ ) ** . 
  playing ~ ~ the ~ ~ * le * `` reddit game '' . 
  really ? 
  hhmmmm ... would you accept the challenge of submitting a post that makes it into r/all ? 
  i 'll admit i succumb to the commercial books + media combo . 
  i read the harry potter novels and then went to watch the movies for comparison ( and also enjoyed hp on both types of media ) , and i 'm currently doing the same for a song of ice and fire . 
  strangely enough , the hunger games never drew my attention . 
  oh , bloody yes . 
  it happens a lot when writing text walls : sometimes i find a more economical/better way to write a point and i miss the correct grammar once in a while ( because the whole sentence has to be restructured ) ; then , when i re-read my post ( one of the several times i do ) i discover that error and correct it . 
   to clarify , first and foremost , i have to make sense to myself and i am inclined to use words that will accomplish that regardless of outer recognition , and that is where obscure words come in if needed . 
  the contrast between that paragrapgh and and the rest of your reply subtly communicates the idea of the entire reply . 
  clever . 
  i also agree with your point .

  that 's paradoxical , mr. douglas . 
  that means the people suited for presidency are not capable of campaigning ; therefore , they can not get elected : which leads us to think democacy is an inherently failed system of government . . 
  which a quick revision of history ( democracies vs * de facto * military dictatorships , fiefdoms , communist councils , kingdoms ) would allow us to deem it as false . 
   `` people of different cultures/values should n't mix at the rate they 're doing now '' . 
  completely agree with you . 
  but now comes the fun part : how do create a piece of legislation to enforce that principle ? 
  do you close your borders to these people ? 
  do you allow a limited amount of them in ? 
  how will you keep their birth rates at bay ? 
  and once you have it , how do you pass it ?
