  ahh ... 
  communism . 
  [ the wheat of glory , labour and equality ] ( http://ci.memecdn.com/112/4371112.jpg ) . 
  speaking about idealized systems , communism is probably the best . 
  sadly , the human psyche is completely unprepared for such system ; but maybe we could run simulations to see how it works in advanced machines . 
  perhaps it works even better than free markets in an all-machine environment where machines govern other machines . 
  [ oooo-k ? 
  uhhh really ? 
  because i get the impression some of them did rape girls -- a very serious issue that must be dealt with with justice 's full extent -- and/or others who are vocal and preach radical islam loudly ( like that guy ; choudary , i believe ) and now people became scared and preach that all of them are potential rapists/extremists , while dismissing the fact that even if there were n't any refugees there would still be rape . 
  i need some help to contextualize myself because i have n't played league of legends nor dragon realms , and the only thing i `` know '' about them is the severly bad reputation that league of legends fanbase has . 
  but i infer you imported some vocabulary from league of legends to fit more properly into a dragon realms game mechanic , correct ? 
  if that 's the case , i have two observations :, 
  * people are tribal ( yes , even on this sub ), 
  so the mere mention of a rival fanbase or one they hate will cause them to downvote you , as it seems you 're `` sympathizing with the enemy '' . 
  * it creates some confusion . 
  granted , your brand-new adaptation of terminology may be better , but inexperienced people with the game may resent the change if the game deals with many technicisms . 
  so even though it 's an improvement , a cost-benefit analysis may show that making the change is really not worth it , even if does make up for a slight practical ( but correct ! ), 
  advantage . 
  le gentleman has spoken . 
  that 's when you take care about stuff through legislation . 
  it 's your duty to enforce your laws and prevent anything that resembles sha ` ria to be enforced ( and also integrate them into the culture to prevent disenfranchised descendants of muslims to join the terrorists ) so its your law the one that rules , not theirs . 
  nope , i 'm just ( mis ) using the language he spoke in a double * entendre * . 
  russian language ( currently learning ) and the fall of communism in europe . 
  well , the_donald projects quite a particular image , and since some media outlets reported him as entertainment at first -- not aware he would become a serious option to become the republican candidate -- i thought that maybe his supporters are not what they seem at first glance either ( in terms of influence , reach , motives , etc ) . 
   more precisely , is he the `` not 2 % '' type or the `` good shot at being elected '' type of serious ? 
  the `` good shot at being elected '' type of serious in my perception . 
  he 's the current frontrunner -- that alone is saying a lot -- and he needs 503 more to secure the candidacy ( he 's got 845 at this point ) , and he 's got plenty of time to achieve this . 
  but well , it 's the first time i 'm following an american presidential race ; so i might as well have a skewed view of how it 's developing . 
  hmmmm ... never done it while walking by , to be honest . 
  but i have been sucessful in public transportation : when you get on the bus or a subway -- mostly buses , as they 're slower -- and see an empty seat next to a girl you like , use it ( even if there are complete rows of empty seats behind her ) and start talking to her . 
  having developed my own sense of humor gave me confidence as i started `` seeing '' results ( trough a painfully developed fe ) . 
  there 's a particular girl whose exit schedule coincides with mine ( we 're both out of school at the same time ) , i stated applying kino and whatnot and i already kissed her as we started seeing each other outside because the first time i saw her we exchanged phone numbers ( i asked for her 's ) . 
  maybe making `` cold approaches '' is best on an environment where you 're forced to wait -- queues , buses , airplanes -- rather than walking or approaching randomly to somebody who is waiting on their own because you have an `` excuse '' to do so . 
  otherwise , your sexual impulse can come off as `` creepy '' ( protip : you will hardly come off as creepy if you 're physically attractive and you start conversations in a friendly , non-sexual way in a start ) . 
  ** edit : ** u/olenna reminded me of a time i might as well could have ended on r/letsnotmeet , so i still encourage you to take a seat next to a girl you like despite lots of free seats being available but * smile and ask her if she if she minds you sitting next to her * ; that way you let her choose ( thus non-verbally stating you respect her space , privacy , safety , etc. ), 
  while making clear you do want to bond with her . 
  ** bonus : ** i did n't know r/letsnotmeet existed . 
  read it and try to empathize with these women to get the * feel * of insecurity and threat they feel and why their self-preserving instinct prevents them from explicitly stating verbally they do n't want to interact with the guy anymore even though it 's the logical thing to do . 
  do n't think , do n't deduce , do n't theorize , * just feel * . 
  fe is the function that deals with people . 
  since your fe is -- presumably -- underdeveloped because it 's not necessary for your survival , you really do n't bestow much importance to it . 
  but other people do , so they interpret you not smiling as you having a problem -- even when you do n't -- because most of the time a person in his/her environment does n't smile , they * do * have a problem . 
  conversing is a way of bonding , hence the `` uncomfortable silences '' . 
  when people trust someone enough , they can be perfectly silenced for a long period of time while still being comfortable ( then again , if your fe is underdeveloped you might as well not feel this in-context ) . 
   can we not encourage the captive environment thing ? 
   and do n't fucking sit down on the bus bench next someone ( pinning them in ) if there are open benchs . 
  i summoned you in my edit . 
  check it out !, 
  ( thanks for pointing that out . ), 
   or places where it could potentially greatly inconveniences us or makes us late to work or something if we get creeped out and want to extract ourselves from the situation ? 
  sorry , but no . 
  we could -- and we should -- try to develop ourselves to the point where we can empathize with you ( thus enshrining the respect for your integrity ) but we 'll never be able to fully read your mind ; although the civilized , functional and chivalrous way is to make you feel comfortable and pleased , * we can not be held accountable for your feels * . 
  but if you feel threatened you can :, 
  * explicitly communicate verbally -- supported by negative body language -- you do not feel ok , so the guy is conscious about what 's happening ( aka the `` hard no '' ) . 
  * pray to god for him to stop ( not recommended : many guys wo n't stop until a `` hard no '' takes place ; this option is `` the soft no '' and you can get away with it a lot of times , i recognize that ) . 
  at this point you 're done dealing with normal , non-violent men . 
  * any * man who respects a woman 's integrity will go as far as the `` hard no '' reaches ( but you do have to state it !! ) . 
  and those are the men my comment was oriented to . 
  if he still keeps on going when you 've already stated `` the hard no '' keep your senses up ( you 're in defcon-1 now ) and scan the area for escape routes and possible help : you 've encountered a potential rapist , and any amount of niceness will backfire if he 's made his mind up . 
  things * are * likely going to get violent and the question is how much time you can buy yourself before the violence get physical . 
  but well , rape and strategies both men and women can take to prevent and erradicate it are a topic for another thread . 
   you 're on the bus minding your own business and some big dude askes to sit next to you even though there are open seats . 
  that 's fucking weird , right ? 
  no it 's not , you 'd be amazed about how much it 's not for many girls ( though i respect it may be for you ) , especially if you look like ryan gosling or something . 
   now your pinned in with some dude . 
  if you did voice you opinion , there 's no reason why you 'd be pinned down with some dude . 
  if not , well , then i 'm no one to try to help you . 
  the point is : we are not mind readers . 
   there is a baseline level of respect for the space of strangers people who are not creepy try to respect . 
  true . 
  but mind a swede can feel different than an american regarding space ; sometimes it 's impossible not to step over the boundaries of the absolute most sensitive people in the world , even if you 're making an effort not to ( i 'm not talking about the bus scenario anymore for this paragrapfh ) . 
   like the hypothetical guy that would choose the urinal directly next to you even though the rest are open . 
  sorry , but that 's not a valid comparison . 
  in one scenario you 're talking about waiting to get to another place for a relatively large period of time -- that you advantage of to socialize -- and your genitals are covered at all times , while in the other you 're excreting . 
  trying to pick someone up at a public restroom is always creepy because at some point you 're exposing your genitals -- thus rendering yourself vulnerable to an * actual * sexual assault -- and because urine and feces are naturally disgusting ( toxics ) ... 
  god , i do n't know why i 'm explaining in this depth , you should 've gotten it by the first line . 
   also , it 's cool . 
  not looking for lessons on how to deal with potentially threatening guys from you . 
  `` thank you '' would have sufficed . 
   enjoy your weekend . 
  same for you . 
  [ mfw reading your whole reply ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knqgs24u1e8#t=0m8s ) . 
   men are required to initiate , but not show interest . 
  women are not allowed to initiate , but must show interest . 
  who the fuck came up with this shit ? 
  most likely , mother nature . 
  my conjecture is that at first ( in the times of the australophitecus and other hominids ) , there were n't many cognitive functions ; and extraverted feeling was one of the most primitive ones , so we started relying quite heavily on it . 
  and now , in a world where we do n't fight nearly as much as in other ages/centuries , we 're still constrained by the fear ( lost of different brands of fear for both men and women ) that effectively kept us safe enough for humankind to not go extinct , even at those violent times . 
   imagine if we could start off honest with intentions clearly stated . 
  none of this male pressure to be a stud , none of this female pressure to not be a slut . 
  whether you just want to get laid , or get into a relationship ; you should be able to make that intention clear - no matter male or female . 
  maybe one day , my friend . 
  maybe one day ... 
  in the meantime , we * can * know what 's going on without being so straightforward and in order to do so , we must develop and use the damn fe . 
  no other way around it . 
  cheers !, 
  sigh ... you meant photoshopped . 
  i thought i jerked off to the * other * kind of morphs . 
  but it 's a good one , in my opinion . 
  why 'd you say it 's terrible ?
