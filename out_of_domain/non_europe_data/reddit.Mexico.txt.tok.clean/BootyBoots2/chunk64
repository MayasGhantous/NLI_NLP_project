  i love animations . 
  i do give it more of a shit than the average person . 
  i 'm pretty much some kind of sexual [ abradolf lincler ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xegtkyyii7i#t=0m53s ) who craves sex -- i can do it pretty much everyday , sometimes more than once a day -- but is constrained by his low fe to find partners . 
  it is really some kind of curse . 
  well , it depends on your vision and what you want for the us . 
  some people want the establishment to step down so bad , they do n't mind an openly rich ( which usually means manipulating the law to become richer and not the other way around ) , xenophobe , politically inexperienced , islamophobe , war crime advocate who thinks women should be punished for abortions . 
  others grip hold to the false sense of security hillary gives them even though she has databases of classified information for her personal gain , she did n't manage the benghazi affair properly , she resigned being secretary of state and she has a quite suspicious record of * private * speeches to her wall st. donors . 
  now , i just spouted popular opinions -- based on feelings -- on why both candidates are bad . 
  and when the candidate your backing does n't win , you enter in damage control mode when you evaluate which one is the `` least worst '' president ; rather than the best option . 
  this is the stage where hardly anybody will agree with each other . 
  ** how come my opinion about x ** -- let 's take trump for example -- ** be biased and based about feelings ** ? 
  you may ask . 
  ** because when you find evidence for a view that reinforces itself , there comes a point when it becomes fossilized ** . 
  maybe he 's not going to do all that loud shit he says he will and actually be a good president but it sounds highly unlikely . 
  ** and when speaking about making an effective change with your vote , there 's really not a very firm way to predict how will each candidate act in case of emergency . 
  ** who would have thought the bush administration would be directly responsible for the rise of isis to power ? 
  when 9/11 happened an overwhelming majority of americans supported the invasion . 
  i think there was no way to predict the social event that was brewing up in the middle east and what the consequences of american action would be in the long run ; and in the same fashion , ** we do n't know what `` little '' events in the world ** ( a conflict anywhere , the discovery of a mine in asia , a policy change in latin america , a dictatorship in asia -- or europe ! -- , depletion of resources vital resources anywhere , etc. ), 
  ** can make up for heavily fortunate or unfortunate decisions taken by the new us president that can have long lasting consequences for the us ; and more importantly , the rest of the world ** . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : speaking about `` effective vote '' you 'll always vote on your feels , because hardly any amount of previous infromation is useful to predict the president 's behaviour in crises ( and more importantly if you 'd regret electing who you elected for managing a particular event of great importance/proportions ) and the internal/external factors that influence him/her to take such decision . 
  yes , it did . 
  true . 
  but as we know it , politicians are professional liars , and just because they promised to make such a massive cut to military spending it does n't mean they will , not even bernie . 
   i 'm in college and marriage is n't a current concern , but if i know i would n't marry them , then why invest ? 
  * marriage is a huge deal . 
  your happiness and the one of your spouse and most likely your children 's depend on you making the right choice . 
  when you have short-term relationship experience , you discover what you like or not about other people ; and you become self-aware of your own flaws in a way introspection would never allow you to . 
  expanding on experience , casual sex allows you to do that and get a sense of what you like , and what other people like -- though all of them are different and you have to have an open , good communication with them in order to not trespass their boundaries and make it enjoyable for everyone -- so when you hit a stable , long term relationship , you 'll be `` better '' in general terms in something that is ( i presume ) very important for most people within a relationship . 
  * the anti-religious fanatic argument, 
  you 're talking about relationships . 
  pick a partner that makes you feel happy . 
  it does n't need to be logically coherent to other people because you are the one who is choosing that person because of how it makes you feel . 
  * your own emotional health ( at least i have observed this in men ), 
  some men become depressed as they feel worthless because they perceive women despise them , which furthers their depression , which in turn makes women to put distance to them because depression is very unhealthy and kind of contagious ; thus becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
  sex cheers you up in that regard . 
  although i do encourage casual , consensual sex , i also encourage -- and stress -- responsiblility on your party and others . 
  please use condoms as much as you can while in hookups as a way of preventing std spread and visit your doctor often for check-ups if you suceed a lot at getting one-night stands . 
  demonstrate yourself that you 're capable . 
  there must be an ability you wish to be proficient at ; pursuit it consistently and gradually show yourself you 're better and more resilient than you thought you are . 
  when you feel better , pursue your dreams . 
  i was going to post the exact same excerpt you posted . 
  the perfect example of when your own logic comes and bites you in the ass . 
  unfortunately , as we would expect , the_donald supporters are too simple minded to follow logic , so they revert back to the memes they can understand . 
  this is the definition of hourglass ... 
   who the fuck allows this ~ ~ racist ~ ~ xenophobic ads ? 
  i 'm hispanic , and i have no idea about what he/she meant or how is his/her message related in any way to that bundle of coke . 
  wow ... that sounds like actual social dynamics . 
  oh ... now it makes perfect sense !, 
  i really do n't know why you people deny scientific advances achieved by muslims on their golden age . 
  they may not be very impressive in comparison to today 's ( because since the advent of the internet knowlege has incremented exponentially ) advances but they did have an organized , wealthy and somewhat intellectual society on their peak . 
  meanwhile , europe was too busy slaughtering each other . 
  still , this is the post conveys the kind of dangerous ideology that we all must unite to fight . 
  islam is a system of faith , not science on itself and even muslim scientists from the golden age researched from observations in the tangible world , not from blindly following islamic dogma . 
  this kind of post is laughable but [ this article ] ( https://www.researchgate.net/profile/sayed_shahabuddin_hoseini/publication/257594844_masturbation_scientific_evidence_and_islam%27s_view/links/0a85e539c2c6f9c7d0000000.pdf?inviewer=0&amp;pdfjsdownload=0&amp;origin=publication_detail ) is not so much . 
  maybe the trained eye would recognize the fallacious content quickly , but since it has a format shared by legitimate scientific studies many people would be fooled by it . 
  and in a community where access to information is restricted , it can easily pass a legitimate , further confirming existing biases and views and creating misinformation ( to be fair this also holds true for all religions and `` christian science '' in particular is something we should also be watchful about at all times ) . 
  that 's why i dislike the strategy this sub takes : i understand that you firmly believe that no publicity is bad publicity and that shock is a cheap way to draw attention and win ; but when people become so polarized , it 's hard for all to agree on anything because now are all with their guards up about anything . 
  in this particular case , i do n't think you 'll ever convince hardcore progressives about the dangers of religious ideologies creeping up in science even if you 're right in this case because you 've attacked them so much they 'll never listen to what you people have to say , even when you do have a point . 
  that sounded like an actual bot comment . 
  yes ; putinism . 
  also , videos_ss would horrify most religious people with it 's statement . 
  place the period before `` capitol '' and be amazed of the huge political power that changing a tyre around nebraska can have . 
  that is [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/ka4gmd0 ) for anybody who wants at look for it . 
  great guide !, 
  thanks . 
  never go full chocolate . 
  damn son ... this is so high-res i would n't be able to see pussy in such detail irl . 
  female snoop dogg ? 
  how come it 's not symmetrical ? 
  i 've always thought the uk flag was the most glorious example of symmetry . 
  ** edit : ** never took a closer look to it , it 's definitely not symmetrical . 
  you know , i 'm mexican and a while ago everyone was amped up by a poll on a website where people chose which was the most beautiful flag in the world . 
  mexico won . 
  while i definitely love my country 's flag , i 've always thought the most beautiful flag is the uk 's . 
  of course , the will of the people is the most important thing ; but it would a shame for the uk 's flag to keep getting butchered as countries leave it . 
  it reminds me of the soviet anthem and the changes they did to it : even though they kept the music , the lyrics did bestow a huge degree of epicness that the russian anthem simply did n't inherit , in my opinion . 
  or police ... 
  i hated myself for liking that movie . 
  trump 's posts are up because they were upvoted by trump 's people . 
  it does n't mean they will raid everything they do n't agree with ( perhaps some will , i 'll give you that but could you prove they massively do ? 
  i never got it , why do people called him that way ? 
  not related to this post but in any way , but i love your replies . 
  you 're like ... 
  the tyrion lannister of reddit imo . 
  so quick-witted ... 
  poor girl . 
  i hope all of this negative attention does n't fuck her mind up or anything . 
  never saw the actual video ( too cringeworthy ) did she actually do that ? 
  she * looks * fucked up , but even the most reasonable people can lose it when very emotionally strained . 
  hit the nail . 
  the republicans said they would do anything in their way to block obama 's candidate for justice ( merrick garland ) . 
  can you imagine 30 more years of a reloaded scalia ? 
  dude ... 
  i , i , i. . . dude ... fucking 80 's man and and and and bloody fucking thor and hot chicks and wow , like wow man . 
  truly , one of the greatest cinematographic experiences i have ever had in my life , certainly the greatest on youtube . 
  thank you for sharing . 
  very interesting !, 
  but it kinda blows your cover off to wear a big banner that says `` police '' does n't it ? 
  the blonde boy at the middle of the bottom row is re-evaluating his life ... 
  so much this .
