  i especially hate it when they quote an academic paper to support their claims with `` science '' or with actual science taken out of context ; taking away what makes it scientific : an unbiased observation and repeated experiments reviewed by a community of specialists to validate or dispel the theory . 
  or when they deny the existence of mountains of evidence on x subject because it does n't suit their beliefs so they present factually wrong and misleading `` evidence '' . 
  finally , my personal favorite : misinterpretation of statistics ( especially of descriptive statistics ) . 
  gun ownership is inversely correlated to crime ? 
  ** it 's because of guns , everyone should have a gun in their hands . 
  ** white people score better in average in iq tests than people of other races ? 
  ** the white race is the superior race , we should forcibly sterilize non-whites ** . 
  almost forgot , the loudest people -- in my personal experience -- tend to often be the most bigoted . 
  whenever i read this , i know i 'm having to brace for that god damn lv . 
  88 pikachu from hell . 
  oh , and that snorlax with rest ... 
  hmmmm ... 
  i do n't think the iq has much to do with controlling emotions ; one could have a high iq and be very emotional . 
  you 're even aware of what your problem is , so work on it and stop lumping people in groups !, 
   i was just answering the questions as an individual , not how all infps would answer ... 
  i agree , but never did i say or imply that ... 
   ah i did n't mean to lump anyone , and i 'm not really sure what gave the impression, 
  well , but you did ; in your first comment you said :, 
   maybe because i 'm in the minority , i just automatically assume everyone else too ; - ; which does n't make sense at all ... yup . 
  that statement communicates to me that you categorize people you do n't know as either ( for this case at least ) a minority like you or a majority like white males . 
  in either case you 're assuming people behind a keyboard belong to a certain group without any evidence . 
  and that 's fine to me , as long as you do n't use discrimination ( read : in my own definition , discriminating means categorizing objects -- people in this particular case -- in a certain group before gathering evidence that your suspicion is true ) in a way that is harmful or detrimental to yourself or other people . 
  i have considered the s and f traits to be the `` fast response agents '' and t and n to be the `` slow response agents '' in decision making . 
  if you have no objective anchor to speak of ( namely no previous information to work with , rendering your ne somehow uselss as well ) and you need to solve this quickly , then i think it 's natural for your s or f functions to heavily influence your decision . 
  language can be tricky : if something `` feels '' right , it does n't necessarily mean you 're using the f trait . 
  it means you chose one object -- could be physical thing or a decision -- amongst another ( s ) because you had a sense of that object being consistent with your perception of what 's positive . 
  example : you are in a hurry to reach a place at a given time . 
  you have to cross the street and a car is approaching slowly at a far distance . 
  should you cross it now or not ? 
  in this case you ca n't know objectively which is the speed of the car and how many factors can slow it down or not , even if you had them , by the time you came up with a number , the car would have been long gone and so would your date . 
  example 2 : you need to buy a tuna can for your salad and there are hundreds of different brands on the shelf . 
  which one will you pick ? 
  ** tl ; dr ** : there are times when information is insufficient or it 's really not worth it to analize something . 
  trial and error is valid stance in many cases and that does n't necessarily have to deal with the feeling trait . 
  this is an excellent , thorough reply . 
  i suggest you format it so all of these great points get to actually be read . 
  the cliche 'd `` just be yourself '' is actually great if you 're willing to meet a lot of people . 
  i could n't believe it at first , bit there * are * people who love my tendency to explain stuff , as they find it interesting and compelling ( this does n't coincide with most people i have met who get bored easily for it ) . 
  good god , i made you write a wall of text . 
  sorry , this must have taken you an hour or so . 
  i should have explained that i find lumping people in groups a decision encouraged by the extroverted feeling trait , as it :, 
  * deals with other animals ( people ) . 
  * helps you make a quick decision . 
  then again this -- in my own conception -- observations about the properties of the extroverted feeling function , amd both of these qualities apply to it . 
  that 's the reason why i said `` controlling emotions '' ; people tend to really abuse discrimination and make it a very serious problem when there 's actually good parts to it , and i would say the lack of f would have killed individuals in any society that it 's not `` progressive '' ( and even on those you have to be careful ! ) . 
  for me , this is more of a security concern than a self-esteem one . 
  call me biased , but judging for what i 've read , you seem to be a very kind person . 
   when i first meet someone , i assume they are the best they can be . 
  kind , intelligent , etc. 
  in my mind , they are initially perfectly flawed beings , blessed with all that is great in the world . 
  so it 's not harmful , nor detrimental ( except maybe to myself , but my self esteem is a work in progress ) . 
  having made the prior point clear ( hopefully ) , i 'd seriously advice you to proceed with more caution regarding people . 
  out there there may be people who wo n't care to harm you to further their objectives , or they 're simply `` evil '' . 
  feeling this way may render yourself unnecessarily overexposed , in my opinion . 
   i know how ridiculous it must seem to do this , which is why i said , i would n't trade any iq points for attractiveness . 
  it was meant as a light hearted comment , and i 'm sorry if it offended you . 
  i knew it was a light-heated comment all along ... 
  damn , i just could n't resist arguing : i notice many people discriminate indiscriminately ( talk about irony !, 
  ) , and i just wanted to communicate what i thought about that . 
  i was never offended , and i 'm actually very hard to offend . 
  in this `` outrage = power '' climate i perceive that currently dominates reddit , i may have come out as loud , but it was never my intention . 
  cheers !, 
  to be fair , i stole the tuna can example from the book `` seducing the subconscious : the psychology of emotional influence in advertising '' by dr. robert heath . 
  it 's a great read if you 're interested on the subject . 
  i originally intended to talk about the f trait in general , but i kind of deviated into discussing fe . 
  these are my observations , and i 'm well aware they may be false ; as i 'm not showing a professional dissertation on cognitive functions . 
  perhaps my premise is , indeed , invalid . 
  but that would be because the ideas i put together are not consistent with the fundamentals of psychology , not because the person i adressed to is a fi user . 
  not directing speech to a fitting public does n't necessarily make one 's speech incorrect , it 's the contents that dictate if such is the case . 
  your statement is fallacious . 
  and even if it were the case , how is the nature of the functions modified in any way by the types who use them ? 
  i agree !, 
  could you provide a link to it ? 
  on a country in the middle east . 
  well , i have been told i 'm good at reddit formatting ( you can look for the formatting help died in blue on the lower right corner of the comment box ) , but then again , hardly anyone upvotes my posts . 
  perhaps they 're too long :(, 
  i took the liberty to format your post according to my personal style . 
  perhaps you 'll like it !, 
  ( the links are dyed in blue , at the bottom of the comment ), 
  use headers for titles by typing '' ### '' . 
  i usually try to separate one main idea from another ( paragraphs and blocks of paragraphs ) by inserting a line break , then typing the `` nbsp ; '' then breaking again twice and type on the second a new piece of information . 
  the brain gets ideas much quicker and in a better way if similar bits of information are grouped close to each other . 
  when the post is too long , i manage line breaks , single breaks and continuous lines to break and organize information in a way that is `` friendlier '' to the reader . 
  highlighting really depends on my mood ; sometimes i like how a post looks without being sprinkled in bolds -- i add a tl ; dr -- an in other times i `` compress '' the core of my argument within bolds so the readers can skim trough the important parts . 
  i mostly use bolds in that way , i think italics look more elegant and i use them to stress a key word on my argument . 
  pre-edit : i had n't realized how bad it looks to highlight that way , keep the bolds to a minimum , as it 's difficult for the eye to navigate in a sea of bolds ( same goes for italics ) , and avoid parenthesis abuse . 
  to make comments unrelated to the argument , i use a continuous line by typing three asteriscs in a clean line break , as you can see above . 
  tip : always write the tl ; dr 's on top to allow the user to decide if your post is worth a read or not . 
  the more `` skippable '' your text walls are , the more attractive . 
  the formatted post looks like [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/test/comments/4imfi1/formatting_for_takestwototangent/ ) ( uncut post , minor changes , mostly reorganizing ) or like [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/test/comments/4impoi/formatting_for_takestwototangent_smaller_better/ ) ( major cuts , based off the first edit , wrote synthesis of bullet points according to my interpretations ) . 
  thanks !, 
  maybe ... 
  just maybe `` metaphorically suck dick '' is being courteous and serviceable , and since tourism is an industry based on hospitality , you can expect people to have that attitude ... 
  maybe english is the * de facto * lingua franca of the world , so japanese people will probably get service in english and not japanese . 
  maybe lots of countries speak english as an effect of the widespread colonization by the * british * empire ( america is one of those , btw ! ) . 
  maybe the person who wrote that is delusional ... 
  ** tl ; dr ** : practically speaking , trying to replace functions can backfire . 
  work on the ones that are weak for you !, 
  this is anectodal , but i 've noticed that there 's no other way around than to use the correct functions in the correct situations ; therefore , you 'll have to develop them . 
  if you use ti -- the opposite of fe -- in a situation that deals with the emotions of people , you 'll probably come off as `` weird '' , or make people feel insecure because people , especially feelers or people with a highly developed feeling functions can immediatly recognize when you 're not being authentic and acting according to a method/script , and naturally they will be suspicious about your intentions .
