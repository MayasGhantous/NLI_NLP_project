  * people need to feel safe in order to establish a connection * . 
  moreover , even if you venture to gather knowledge about feelings , you 'll probably have trouble identifying and acting according to a system you designed -- that even when logically consistent it may work or not -- because it 's too much information to handle and then become baffled because people are not consistent within their words and actions ( of course they wo n't , it 's * feelings * we 're talking about ) . 
  you may not be even counting that all people are different , hence your method may work on a reduced amount of them . 
  all of these problems go overboard if you just develop fe !, 
  do n't you dare to invoke that [ dumb politician milf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf_1hvygajw#t=5m33s ) !, 
  well ... technically the claim about modern germany is true , though . 
  the berlin wall came down in 1989 . 
  i know . 
  i think i need to get checked though . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm mexican and i 'd do ann coulter as well . 
  do n't ask . 
  i think size was never the problem , but their numbers ... 
  saluting inanimate objects that are not official national symbols ... [ where have i seen this before ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gllrj-pfskg ) ? 
  or because is quite an easy language to learn as well ... to be fair , perhaps the us economic and military dominance contributed to it , but i think it would be incorrect to just assume it 's the lingua franca solely because of that . 
  that 's actually pretty sad . 
  also pretty sad . 
  the quotes on this bots ... 
  they are * dramatically superior * !, 
  did n't know there was a 50 shades of grey version of erotica stories for men . 
  that if mr. grey was a xenophobic fear-monger . 
  i 'd wear makeup to seem as white as possible , maybe get some blue colored contact lenses and spout some republican shit up , somehow manage to get her worked up and after sex , when she 's all tired and weak after a hot , long pounding ; slap her ass , kiss her neck and tenderly whisper into her ear :, 
  and she wo n't know what to answer , even while understanding the question . 
   the language with absolutely no regular grammar , spelling , or pronunciation, 
  well , spanish needs conjugations for verbs , and that means lots of different endings for verbs according to the tense and pronoun . 
  english uses auxiliaries that reduce all that amount of words to the convenient number of 3 . 
  besides , we bestow meaning to sentences through word order . 
  russian , for example , uses cases . 
  and that my friend , means a hell of a lot more entanglement with suffixes . 
  them phrasal verbs and idioms , though ... 
   cobbled together from untold dozens of other languages, 
  meh , english creeps up to more languages than other languages creep up to english , in my opinion . 
  languages evolve , just like culture ( do n't tell republicans about this !, 
  it 'll be our dirty little secret ) . 
   a million-word vocabulary, 
  you do n't need to learn a million words to speak fluently . 
  if the cheeky articles i read are correct , the first 5000 words or so account for most of the text ( over 90 % ) in any random reading you have . 
  an adult native speaker uses 10,000 words . 
   that not even its own native speakers can use correctly, 
  did i link the sarah palin video on this thread ? 
  lol . 
  well , yes ; that happens with people using any language , i guess ... 
  mexican here . 
  no ... like just no , lol . 
  most foreigners have trouble -- big time -- pronouncing spanish , mostly the `` hard r '' ( like in `` cigarro '' , `` rusia '' , `` arroz '' , `` rata '' , etc ) because it 's a sound that is hardly found on other languages . 
  '' \u00d1 '' has a weird sound for anglophones but people who speak french and protuguese may be familiar with it , as it could be emulated by sounds like `` gn '' ( like in `` gagner '' for french ) and `` nh '' ( like in `` maranh\u00e3o '' for portuguese ) . 
  also , us latins butcher the spanish language . 
  bad . 
  of course , it 's not like you need to learn whole different sets of spanish ; but colombian , mexican , argentinian , * chilean * , dominican and other version of spanish contain lots of words just spoken locally , and do n't even get me started on accents ... 
  the way spanish changes according to geography is kind of like a middle point between english and arabic ; accents and words alike change but not so much they could be considered dialects of spanish . 
  american vp 's ... 
  they have this ... [ waves hand in circles ] je ne sais quoi [ that is so seductive ] ( http://cde.2.trome.pe/ima/0/1/0/0/2/1002794.jpg ) ... 
  worry not , my friend . 
  having had contact with americans i can say you guys are very nice people . 
  i understand reddit attracts the worst of your people . 
  [ mfw i found out people will go down on me to acquire british citizenship ] ( http://www.ldnfashion.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/queen-elizabeth-ii.jpg ) . 
  the worst thing is that , within the `` white race '' there are several different ethicities ( was n't in part the war of the balkans fought because of racial tensions ? 
  yet still , as far as i know , albanians are white ) within it . 
  basically , their racist logic is n't even coherent within it 's own frame .

  [ her majesty ] ( http://www.milsurps.com/images/imported/2015/07/sniperqueene2-1.jpg ) . 
  i was aware of the existence of that sub , but ... is it common for crazy shit to happen there ? 
   i 'm not upset . 
  just got bored with the usual level headed commentary and thought `` why not be an asshole ? '', 
  so fuck you , that 's why . 
  at lest op is self aware ... got ta give him/her that . 
  so ... shall we raise our pitchforks against chelsea ? 
  actually , the deleted comments are quite well-elaborated and respectful . 
  but gulag it is , i guess ... 
  `` if you factor out the gypsies , europe is better than the garden of eden . '', 
  which one is it , the one on the right or the one on the left ? 
  you know what , i actually agree with this guy . 
  hell , they should even keep their fucking numbers and math to themselves . 
  i remember somebody called out an op on a top post once for `` being a terrorist '' . 
  op had a tattoo written in quenya or sindarin ( fictional languages from `` the lord of the rings '' ) . 
  some people now equate an entire writing system to terrorism . 
  you can cheer loudly today \u0442\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0448\u044c . 
   / r/european refugees, 
  hatefugees ? 
   it 's the defacto subreddit for the candidate . 
  the sad part is that r/trump actually features news about trump 's campagin and trump 's policies . 
  it does n't feature fear/hate circlejerk like r/the _ donald does . 
  yet still , it 's a tiny little sub that is irrelevant for committing the sin of not appealing to fanatics ( or keeping it civilized ) .
