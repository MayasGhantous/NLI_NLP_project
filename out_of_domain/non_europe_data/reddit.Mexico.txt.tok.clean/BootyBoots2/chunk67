  do you have proof ? 
  it 's ok if you do n't ; but if you do : holy shit , fox [ news ] ! . 
  how can you possibly manage to do both at the same time ? 
  i mean , i have never robbed anyone but robbing liquour stores must require certain skills ; let alone performing abortions ... 
  oh carol ... are n't you so supportive of tony , now ? 
   because it 's too long, 
  but but but ... but it 's pretty well formatted !, 
  true , it could have been more succint , but this is a pretty text wall in my opinion . 
  i , for one , recognize donaldsanders420 's effort poured in this post . 
  he must have worked on this for at least an hour and a half . 
   and because i 'm dutch, 
  well ... 
  i 'm mexican and we still have n't forgotten nor forgiven [ that dive ] ( http://sipse.com/imgs/062014/290614f19c285c0med.jpg ) . 
  and i upvoted you !, 
  an aspect of human spirit is that we can cast our differences aside and eliminate every trace of prejudice in our hearts . 
  alas , for the most painfully long time have we been hinderded from it . 
  but one day shall come , where we forgive all quarrels and set aside all differences ; and then , constitutions shall become guidelines , for true peace will be achieved . 
  so ... nahuatl ? 
  because , that would totally not be spanish . 
  unless ... spain is not considered european because they are not anglophones and most importantly because they do n't share french or british line of values or culture . 
  i thought about writing something that would be featured on this sub . 
  but i thought that maybe , the line above is too stupid ; even for them . 
  so now , r/the _ donald does n't want the `` hatefugees '' from r/european because they fear their collapse due to accepting them ... 
  if this is not karma , i do n't know what it is ... 
  it 's interesting to notice how some people 's communication is so vitiated , they think they 're being attacked at all times . 
  looking at the original post on trollx , somebody was pointing out a thorough fact about bass size ( i could n't find anything condescending about that ) . 
  in that particular picture , it 's hard to notice op is a professional bassist , and even if she was , does that mean we have to imply said speciallist knows everything about their subject of expertise and therefore any attempt to expand on any form of related knowledge is condescending and offensive ? 
  i actually notice my own double standards here : i agreed with the 20x gilded post about why the people who claim that `` all lives matter '' in response to `` black lives matter '' are diverting the attention on an important subject but disagree with the `` mansplaining '' issue on the grounds that the term is unnecessarily divisive . 
  probably because in the former case lives are being lost and in the latter `` mansplaining '' is just a subset of being condescending and the way the term makes women bitter as opposed to aware , fuerthering the perpetuation of the gender war ; therefore being counterproductive . 
  perhaps they 're both right at the same time : the major care of some religious leaders that instigate warfare is money and power , but the militants of the armed movement are genuinely motivated by religious zealotry . 
  but anyway , that 's just a thought i just had ... 
  broken spanish , though ... 
  also known here as `` thank you for your service '' . 
  everything about this gif is perfect . 
  i edited the post . 
  on a second thought , i do n't think armed religious extremist leaders are necessarily detached from their preachings . 
  actually , i think they * need * to believe what they preach to a certain extent ( that could be neglegible in comparison to staunch militants ) in order to inspire the militants . 
   ( i mean do you ever notice the religious leaders never sacrifice themselves personally in their attacks , it 's always others under their control, 
  they never * risk * fighting as they could die and that would be bad for them because they would lose the advantages gained through the armed conflict ( money , influence , legistlative power ) or because the movement could lose it 's guide ; in this latter case then , the leaders * do care * about the ideals behind it . 
  i have the notion that some religious leaders find the idea behind martyrdom appealing . 
  but , for martyrdom to be effective , the sacrifice must be widely known amongst the militants . 
  well , i 'm talking about the particualr case of leaders of armed religious extremist movements like the kkk or isis . 
  i think the leaders on those kind of cases matter a lot , and the organization/cult may take a very different path without the guidance of the leader . 
  sometimes , it 's very difficult for a successor to follow through a doctrine established by the previous leader/founder of the movement because he/she may have built many ideologies and strategies around himself/herself ; in this cases you can kill a movement if you kill the leader ( perhaps that was the case of irak under saddam , although he was secular ) . 
  agreed !, 
  more like am ^ 1776 !, 
  he even got a movie about it ; something about a record . 
  killing `` dune coons '' somehow makes you a hero on the eyes of some americans . 
  ** pre-edit ** : i was going to say `` killing `` dune coons '' * abroad * somehow makes you a hero on the eyes of some americans . '', 
  but it sadly seems this also apply for people of african descent at home , as well . 
  it 's just more frowned upon . 
  this tsundrami would be the reddit equivalent of the 2002 tsunami that hit the indian ocean . 
  saved this comment in case it turns out to be true . 
  i 'll post this prophecy to r/museumofreddit if that 's the case . 
  the earth is actually around 5000 years old . 
  read your holy bible already !,

  i think they just went full azula by now ... 
  i 'm mexican and i 've never heard it in any variant of spanish other than the iberian one . 
  the most common mexican slang for `` testicles '' ( `` cojones '' being a slang term for `` testicles '' , as well ) is `` huevos '' . 
   us spanish, 
  it 's a thing now ... :o, 
   i 'm an argentine-australian though so i do n't actually know shit . 
  to be fair , i just know * some parts * of mexico . 
  looks like we definitely need to travel some more !, 
   i 'm an argentine-australian though so i do n't actually know shit . 
  god , i 'd love to live in argentina and straya for some time . 
  just to see how it 's like !, 
  i have always said it : google translate is a good dictionary , but an awful translator ( so it 's convenient to look for a certain word but it 's not reliable to hold up with the grammar on the language you want to translate to ) . 
  in most cases , spanish sentences use articles before the subjects . 
  so it sounds off to not say `` the lifeguards are not working '' ( * los * salvavidas no * est\u00e1n * trabajando ) , it 's also important to include the verb `` to be '' ( `` ser '' or `` estar '' ) in it 's correct conjugation before the gerund . 
  moreover , `` off duty '' can be better translated as `` fuera de servicio '' for emergency services such as police and firemen . 
  so , a much better translation could be : `` los salvavidas est\u00e1n fuera de servicio '' -- though that sentence implies that they may be working in another schedule -- or `` no * hay * salvavidas trabajando/en servicio '' ( there are no lifeguards at work ) . 
  then again , articles : tel\u00e9fono * de * emergencia . 
  `` keep off '' can be translated as : `` no pase '' , `` no entre '' , `` mant\u00e9ngase al margen '' , etc. 
  hot chick though ... 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  new pasta ? 
   godverdomsche brusselse wafels me fraisen . 
  excuse my ignorance but , does n't that sound a little german ? 
  i understand belgium speaks french , but it 's close to germany . 
  so , could it be there is some ancient rivalry drama going on ? 
  i * love * this rare breed of plump women where the fat is nicely and evenly distributed . 
  though she could honestly look a bit better if she worked out to cut off some fat , her body is deliciously * shapely * . 
  girl , if you 're reading this , know you have an amazing body . 
  if you think you 're unable to provoke sexual desire , you 're wrong .
