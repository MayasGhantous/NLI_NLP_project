  so it 's dutch , then ? 
  ** edit ** : nevermind , mighty google translate says it 's luxembourgish ( though i may still be wrong :p ) . 
  ** edit 2 ** : til luxemburgish and flemish exist and flemish is a belgian dialect of dutch ( question : if you can speak dutch , can you understand people who speak afrikaans and flemish easily and vice-versa ? ), 
  thank you u/didimeister , u/iamagermanshepherd , u/rh-mup and u/jewwithgardenbeans . 
  this sub is really a cultural melting pot and that 's where our strength comes from .

  well , that 's one of his classic techniques . 
  * believe me , folks * . 
   almost refused my then 17-year-old girlfriend sex, 
  * clicked the link . 
  * heard his `` laugh '' . 
  * immediatly paused and cringed really hard . 
  i was about to hit the arrow to return to the coziness of sas when i thought to myself : `` hey , do n't you dare to act on your fee-fees . 
  sit . 
  through . 
  the whole . 
  damn . 
  thing . 
  and do n't judge until you 're done '' . 
  and i did it . 
  not a pleasant experience . 
  actually , this just reinforces the negative stereotype of trump supporters being delusional and irrational . 
  is n't this like ... straight up attempt to genocide/terrorism/the most repeated arguments for which islamists get called out other than mistreatment of women/non cisgendered people ? 
  great !, 
  i wonder if the accent now slants more towards accents of african languages such as swahili or it still sounds more european ... 
  britain : the place any football fan has to look for when he/she feels his/her team is crappy and ca n't possibly win in an uneven league . 
  ** edit : ** lesson learned : one does not simply make cheeky comments and speak from ignorance when talking about football . 
  do n't you ever dare to question the holly text written by the immaculate prophet ( ~ ~ s ~ ~ ) .

  well , maybe i 'm wrong , but having some of the finest teams in the world does make it a little unfair for teams who can not afford to have the best players/trainers/staff to compete with them , does n't it ? 
  the absolute worst case for this is , in my opinion , spain . 
  it 's barcelona vs. real madrid and the other teams ... are just kind of there ( with some pleasant surprises now and then such as the atl\u00e9tico de madrid uprising ) . 
  damn , the way i phrased my statement made me look really bad , now that i re-read it . 
  that 's the wonderful thing : this kind of sports prowess happens once in a while and makes you keep up the hope even if your team has n't won in decades . 
  leicester fans may remember in 2040 : `` we 're doing so bad ... but do you remember 2016 ? 
  holy shit , all the other teams were so star-spangled george washington would have cummed on himself and nonetheless we still did it !!, 
  we 've done it before and we 'll do it again ! '', 
  alas , nobody knows how much disappointment one can take before tasting the sweet , sweet victory . 
  take the dutch into consideration : nobody in their sane mind could argue they 're not a power in terms football . 
  quick , orderly , precise , you name it . 
  one of the best national teams in the world and has been to the final match of the world cup three times , but won none . 
  but there 's hope ; and hope keeps us around . 
  it does n't matter if your team is good or not . 
  that 's one of the things i love about the us . 
  they have a fine way of making the people entertained and get away with the big bucks while also making it less uneven :, 
  * fans win because they 'll get their hopes up if a really good player gets drafted onto their team . 
  * the owners of teams win by keeping the people entertained and making them spend on tickets , merchandise , sponsorship , etc. 
  * the advertisers win because a huge load of people gets exposed to their ads . 
  it 's a fully rounded win-win situation !, 
  i do n't like the nfl , but you have to admit they 're good at creating an industry around it . 
  of course . 
  there 's a huge amount of money managed around football , and football works in a different way than other sports do . 
  perhaps if there were drafts we would n't be able to enjoy a massively competitive league such as the uefa champions . 
  definitely not sarcasm . 
  actually , i think that 's the most competitive league . 
  or do you think there 's an even more competitive one ? 
   it 's the price that has to be paid to have the by far far best league in the world i guess . 
  really ? 
  i felt like the netherlands , germany and italy have a faster brand of football , and it 's more of an `` everyone 's gain '' for a shot at the cup ( aside from the corruption issues in the italian case , of course ) . 
  sure barcelona is a showstopper and cristiano competes closely with messi for the trohpy for best player pretty much every year , but i feel like i 'd enjoy a more random league where the team i pledge allegiance to has more chances of winning and it 's not gasping for air because it does n't have so much money to hire high-profile personnel ( though , to be fair barcelona `` breeds '' most of it 's stars , so they 're sort of exceptional ) ,, 
   not to mention that apart from this season , the pl winner has n't been all that more diverse at all , just one of manu , city and chelsea . 
  fair point . 
   i can tell from this statement right here that you do n't follow football at all . 
  you caught me . 
  thanks for the explanation !, 
  ** edit : ** hold on a second ... 
  i 'm pretty sure the one horse must be bayern munich , but ... was n't borussia dortmund important ? 
  a few years ago , i recall they were becoming dangerous at the champions . 
  praised be dramallah !, 
  gotcha , thanks for the tip . 
  terrorism percetion is inversely proportional to the melanin concentration of the perpetrator . 
  but ... reddit is an online forum . 
  by definition , social media ... 
  this is an interesting post . 
  why do n't you observe the patterns to try to predict his behavior ? 
  perhaps being backstabbed is a function of time , or of enemies on the field , or it is n't correlated to anything . 
  mind that while playing on these platforms , it 's anything goes . 
  so there are probably very few people you can trust to suit your play style . 
  it 's like agar.io . 
  sure , you can cooperate and there are actually proficient , well-organized teams . 
  but i really doubt you can find a random person to feed and not take advantage of you when the time 's right . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : find a partner in real life to play with . 
  there are trade-offs . 
  when picturing an intj , i aways come to think about tywin lannister . 
  can you imagine what the severe lack of fi is like ? 
  we can become social outcasts if we do n't develop fe , but in their case , it means -- stereotypically , of course -- getting all kinds of achievements and using whatever means necessary ( this can even mean stepping over people ) . 
  but ultimately , all efforts and achievents are vain when the real goal is not met : to force your life to a moral structure , because you apparently lack any other kind thereof . 
  you might be looked up to ; but , will you ever look up to yourself ? 
  will you ever find peace in yourself ? 
  ** edit ** : fucked it up , fi is the fourth function of entj 's . 
   i 'm not even sure my english is accurate here . 
  it is . 
  studying for finals . 
   please do n't think that all of us are like this . 
  i do n't . 
  lately i 've noticed how easy is to fall into a tribal mindset , and i acknowledge it can happen to people who share any possible ideology . 
  therefore , i make a conscious effort to not to act on my self preserving feelings and make blatant and incoherent generalizations about people i do n't know .
