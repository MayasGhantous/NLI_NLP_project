  please , do n't think all leftists/progressives/millenials are irrational and delusional sjw 's . 
  we know we have some of them amongst our ranks , but not all of us are like that . 
  i do n't think you should trust people like that . 
  i 'm not paranoid , but i always keep an eye on people and slowly trust in them ( this is when the fe/fi becomes useful ) . 
  [ cpt . 
  $ , plz ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dafnyvmmhbe#t=0m25s ), 
  can you back up that claim with a link ? 
  i 'm now craving for that drama . 
  sorry , i love drama , so i visited his website to become horrified because ... masochism . 
   hits on his webshites, 
  not quite ... 
  i 'm also very self conscious and i came to realize that not even drunk i would loosen up on my fears and general sense of consciousness . 
  it something that comes up from the inside . 
  i have come to think that , while ti is our workhorse , we get interested on things because of ne . 
  so , even though it 's a jaded thing to say , try not to think , or otherwise think about the current thing you 're doing : the flavors of what you 're eating , the chipring of the birds , the traffic outside , how the paper feels on your hands . 
  whatever . 
   i just do n't care or know anymore , moving to fl to become a beach bum sounds more practical now days . 
  i ca n't live this routine lifestyle anymore, 
  well , there comes a point in your life where you need to evaluate if you need this . 
  do it if it 's necessary !, 
  pot has never been my thing ... 
  i suck at smoking ( ironically ) , so i 've got that going for me . 
  if i 'm better at dealing with people it is because i have been able to develop a sense of humor where i `` act '' and ridicule everyday stuff . 
  kind of what colbert does at his `` news '' shows . 
  e.g : exaggerating at sing a ridiculous love song and pointing out the dumb parts or simply `` outplacing '' myself . 
  so i 'm now britney , or bruno mars or anyone but me . 
  it 's ok if they make fun at me , * it 's supposed to happen * . 
  besides , i 'm mocking the original artist , not exposing myself . 
  not quite the case . 
  but back on my `` pick-up artist '' period i found myself frustrated than i could n't consume enough alcohol to go talk to the `` hot '' girls on that party . 
  not even alcohol would loosen myself up . 
  i learned to relax and somehow `` misplace '' my ego ; effectively entertaining people and protecting my ego from being hurt at the same time . 
  it 's a matter of developing a strategy that suits you . 
  i do that too . 
  i like to hide my abilities because there may come a time where i can impress everyone with a cool ability nobody new i had ... 
  usually i 'm repelled by willful ignorance , but in terms of drugs , i bury my head in the ground like an ostrich . 
  i do n't know what meth is , and i do n't want to try it out . 
  thanks . 
  i said no thanks . 
  ** no sir , i do not want to try it out for free , lalalalalalalala not listening !!!, 
  i 'm mexican and i do n't know what happened in chiapas . 
  could you breifly explain it to me or link to where i can read more about it ? 
  i do n't think we can gather significant evidence to get a `` defining '' sense of what type you are , but still , mbti leaves much room to speculation and it 's not so reliable in the sense that many people score different types consistently . 
  what you should pay attention to is functions . 
  now , you 're deciding between those two types . 
  take a closer look to your `` workhorse '' ( 1st function ) and your weakness ( 4th function ) . 
  fi deals with how concepts trigger emotions . 
  so if somebody scientifically demonstrates to you that allowing abortions is the best course for society in a variety of different instances ( it 's just an example ) and it conflicts your moral system , there 's absolutely no way you 're going to accept that and you may go the greater lenght of opposing abortion from becoming legal to the last intances . 
  it does n't matter how accurately science demonstrates how beneficial it could be . 
  ti deals with logic . 
  objects and it 's immutable properties are defined at first . 
  then , in order to get information about a not obvious interaction between those two , ti has to build a coherent system . 
  so when one says something according to feelings or emotions and it 's not coherent , ti will protest . 
  e.g :, 
  * intp child : i do n't wa n't to go to church . 
  * isfj parent : you have to go because god is watching you . 
  * intp child : do you have any proof that god exists ? 
  * isfj parent : the bible . 
  in this example , after the last dialogue the intp child goes nuts because he 's being forced to do something he does n't want to * because * of a non-verifiable entity and even worse : the parent cites an incoherent , ancient holy text and tops that off by invoking it via some cognitive errors , argumentative errors and logical fallacies . 
  an interesting point of this is that as long as every piece of information is coherent within a certain frame , we can accept erroneus conclusions , or deem a stament as false when it 's actually true because of lack of information . 
  i think it is important to care about how you make other people * feel * , as you an use it to your advantage and prevent negative reactions from people that way ( which is actually developing fe ) . 
  but not caring works wonders for many people . 
  glad you found your way !, 
  also , approach many different people and never take rejections at heart . 
  you 'll eventually find who clicks with you , and that will be super rewarding . 
  i do n't know about you , but i 'm perfectly fine with orders * as long as * :, 
  * a competent authority ( uncorrupt police , scholars , parents [ most of the time ] , etc. ), 
  says so . 
  * the authority backs its power and takes its decision based on a piece of information that was previously agreed upon ( constitutions , rules previously stated by parents/teachers , etc ) or it 's proven that following said order/guideline/rule is objectively best for people/groups . 
  could you explain yourself ? 
  i did n't understand ... 
   the kind of situation when someone think that he `` knows '' what 's better for you and tells you that you have to do it [ ... ] specially if it 's not sympathetic to me . 
  i would have no problem complying with a non-authority i dislike that tells me to do something it it 's beneficial in the long run ; but i would n't do things right away ; i 'd need time to examine what the other person says , and do it or not * if it 's coherent * and not how we feel towards the person ; that 's because we gravitate towards the bias that the logical way is the best . 
  maybe you 're an infp but have a well developed ti . 
  i took the test as well and it turns out to be i 'm a good te user , but that does n't make me an xntj . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but , is n't `` british '' the denonym for people who live in the british isles and therefore all people who live on them with the exception of the irish ( republic of ireland ) live in the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland ? 
  paraphrased : if you live anywhere [ here ] ( https://metofficenews.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/may-temp.gif?w=343&amp;h=427 ) you are british because that is a map of the british isles . 
  if you live in the green part ( ** edit : ** or the crown dependencies ) , you 're also british ; but you are not governed by the united kingdom , so the most appropriate denonym would be `` irish '' for this case , as you reference the independent country of the republic of ireland . 
  i think that person needs to watch [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnu8xdbsn10 ) . 
  ** edit : ** bad idea . 
  denonym is how people of a certain country call themselves . 
  what i 'm saying is that all the people who live in the british isles are british , and all british people with the exception of the irish ( republic of ireland ) are governed by the uk and are represented by [ this flag ] ( http://wallpapercave.com/wp/paxa7ah.jpg ) . 
  yeah , i messed up and edited my comment . 
  maybe you read that before i changed it ... 
   but as i said i could even go in defense against something that might actually be good for me, 
  even if the person is harrasing you , going against something that you know that will benefit yourself in any way is irrational ( we intps cam be irrational at times like any other person , but we strive to minimize that ) . 
   still an infp but with a developed ti ( 4th main function ) ( my ti and te are also quite similar ) . 
  te is the 4th function of infps . 
  ti and te are quite different functions as they deal with different things : ti manages systems and interactions based on the properties of abstract concepts and objects while ti does the same with tangible concepts ; besides , a te-dom user can be bad at using ti and vice versa . 
   at the end of the day we are too complex to be completely described by only 4 letters , we have so many shades varying from situations to situations, 
  agreed !, 
  i see , thanks for the correction !, 
  ok , so wrapping it up : independently of geography , you 're british if you live in the united kingdom because those two words because people commonly associate them ; and even in that case , people prefer to be referred by their country of origin , rather than the union they live in ( english , scottish , welsh , n. irish ) . 
  read the rest of the clause ... 
  i see . 
  i thought `` british '' was a geographical rather than political denonym . 
  thanks for the clarification !, 
  yeah , i remember that one now . 
  my point was that , both being part of the british isles , you could say irish are british too , alluding to the british isles . 
  i was unaware that the denonym actually refers to the people who live in the uk as a political demarcation ( i 'm aware of that now , thanks ! ) .
