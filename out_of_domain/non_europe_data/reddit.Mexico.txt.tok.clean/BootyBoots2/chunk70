  kind of like the spanish and the portuguese are different countries but they 're both iberian , because of their geographical location . 
  talking about a pick up artist period is kinda iffy because it 's likely that sooner or later the red pill will pop up , and later up feminism ( with all its corresponding degrees of extremism , like trp ) will shop up as a response . 
  and then the thread will go to hell really fast from that point on . 
   the term british isles is deemed unacceptable as it includes ireland and given the history , the irish do not want to be referred to as geographically british , or indeed in any other way . 
  yeah ... this thread made it quite clear for me now . 
  thanks for the information . 
  you are welcome !, 
  ** tl ; dr ** : lack of fe causes some people to look for information to design a system to fulfill their romantic/sexual pursuits , when they should do the opposite and develop fe . 
  severe failure may result in people believing in the red pill as if it was some revelation . 
  naturally , underdeveloped intps can be a vulnerable group to this situation . 
  the problem is , that we 're especially ill-suited for the dating world 's `` rules '' because of our weakness , but it gets progressively worse because of our * strengths * . 
  i studied pick-up for a year and went down on some runs with my friends . 
  i felt very lonely at times , even bitter ; although -- thankfully -- never at elliot rodgers levels of low . 
  how it happeed to me :, 
  at the beginning i had no experience whatsoever with women and was actively avoiding them ( classic intp sense of superiority plus shear fear of impregnating a girl ) , and then , a beautful accident happened and * a girl led me on * . 
  we ended up in a relationship that wore out a year and a half later . 
  then , being exposed to how awesome relationships -- and sex -- are , i thought : hey , there must be a procedure , some kind of science behind why some guys ca n't ever hook up with a girl and why others are `` drowned in pussy '' . 
  knowledge is power ( as we know it ) , so i read a shit ton of books ; now aware that my body was fearful as it gets because of low fe . 
  a few tries , a few crashes ... the thing is that some rejections make some men feel like : `` hey , this is not bad at all , why was i so afraid ? '', 
  but for others , rejections were like : `` omg , kill meeee plzzzzzz !!!, 
  so fucking embarassing . 
  oh and i must have made that girl so uncomfortable . 
  shit !! '' . 
  for that second group , things will probably spiral down . 
  because those horrible failures make you want to avoid failure at all costs . 
  so , in order to do that , you need to :, 
  * fine tune the system ( and theory behind it ) . 
  * be more careful selecting the girls you engage . 
  this only makes you use the ti more ( being the opposite of fe , the least situable function ) , while sweeping fe under the rug . 
  and of course , all of your tactics are cool and all , but the itty bitty problem is that * girls smell sexual desire miles away * -- as it 's pretty much an in-built mechanism for self-preservation -- and having the golden , secret info of seduction tactics at the palm of your hand just boosts your sexual hopes up . 
  so you end in a vicious circle where you :, 
  1 ) read some material . 
  2 ) get your hopes up . 
  3 ) get nervous when spotting `` your prey '', 
  4 ) are unable to recall the information/tactics because of the massive amount of info you read . 
  5 ) the girl instantly notices you want to get under her pants and brushes you as undesirable . 
  6 ) girls rejects you . 
  7 ) it does n't matter how smooth the girl 's rejection is , your self-esteem gets crippled . 
  8 ) you feel ashamed of your failure ( on later iterations this turns into fear , then fear turns to anger , anger turns to hate . 
  -- holy shit , yoda was right -- you know how it ends ) . 
  9 ) you decide your problem was n't you , it was the lack of information to build a comprehensive strategy . 
  rinse and repeat . 
  and the more men fail , the more angry they become . 
  would n't you be angry after spending countless hours into a theory for fixing an important part of you life that turned out to be dust ? 
  at some point of the journey , we will invariably find the red pill . 
  the catch with it , is that it sounds coherent at first , and if you 're selective , you can find great self-improvement advice within it . 
  but for the people who have accumulated so much hate , the red pill can turn for the worst ; actually brainwashing them into feeling like women are sub-human monsters who use their looks to lure men in and suck them dry in every aspect of life . 
  when you top that off with a society that can actually be described by the red pill to a great extent , then people will take it as a revelation , and self-delude into justifying anti-social behaviour by citing it . 
  it gets worse : some girls do fall to the charms of `` the asshole '' , so they may get a lot of sex , conversely to their previous identity and their biases will further settle in . 
  and all because of a little lack of fe . 
  agree wholeheartedly . 
  some observations :, 
   would n't it just feel disingenuous to the strong intp need for independence and self direction as the red pill is essentially denying that to another human being ? 
  i 'm not judging at all . 
  i 'm sure that trp is perfectly acceptable between consenting like-minded adults , even though it just seems like an iteration of sadomasochism to me . 
  at that particular point in the male intp 's life , the strong need for freeddom goes overboard because our desire to make a human connexion via a relationship or sex is so strong , we are just too dazzled for our insecurities regarding the loss of freedom to kick in . 
  when we gather a better sense of social skill , the fear kicks in , and we evaluate hard if `` she 's worth it '' . 
  we can procrastinate a lot to take this desicion , but the time will only come * after * we perceive a relationship is a sure thing with a potential partner . 
  the red pill goes through a very slippery slope . 
  it starts fine and dandy with encouragements about getting fit and getting iterested and engaged in other aspects of life other than women . 
  fair advice for me , so far . 
  the problem is how hard it derails into arguing that women are inherently inmoral , that they should n't vote , that all forms of sex are shades of rape ( the lines about consent or not are blurred ) , and that the best way to be ruled is by the patriarchy ( not the one annoying feminists talk about , i 'm talking about the * actual oppresive * patriarchy ) . 
   they are suppressing their attraction until they trust you because women have a ridiculous labyrinth of unspoken social rules we have to follow to be loved/respected/appreciated . 
  this is a major source of frustration for the `` incel '' types . 
  they 're following everything on the book but not what matters ; * the unwritten * . 
  and the mind-reading/catastrophizing cognitive error combo is just as harmful for women as it is for men . 
  one one side , we feel like crap if we 're sensitive and a sexually attractive girl rejects us ( the more attractive the worse it feels . 
  i know it 's not coherent ; do n't ask :p ) , so we may not approach for a plethora of excuses when the true error is `` she 's way too good looking for me , she 's gon na reject me on a heartbeat '' when we actually do n't know anything about that girl and therefore we are unfit to make any coherent asessment about her in any way . 
  goes the same way for women : perhaps you girls catastrophize about letting us engage into more sexual touching because you think we think you 're slutty and easy . 
  and if you let us `` use you '' we 'll brag with our buddies about it and suddenly * everyone * will know , and you 'll be ashamed forever ... 
  i 'm gon na quote myself . 
   i was unaware that the denonym actually refers to the people who live in the uk as a political demarcation ( ** i 'm aware of that now , thanks ! ** ) . 
  the republic of ireland is not britain ; i know , now . 
  well , the red pill line of thinking goes like : `` i 'm tired of being a doormat ; from now on , we play hard . 
  we get what we want and we 'll stop at nothing to get it '' . 
  so there 's not much room for the bdsm people 's rules ( find a group that 's into this ) . 
   so how did you , specifically , learn to take the good of being a pick-up artist ( which seems to me to read like a functional human being who has their interests , passions , and dies some grooming based on what the opposite sex finds attractive ) but stop short of the borderline sociopathic aspects trp ? 
  well , i 'm not a pick up artist in the sense i go out and just `` pick up '' a sexually attractive girl and have sex with her that night . 
  but after a year and a half -- one year of experimenting with pua techniques and reading books -- i was able to seduce my current girlfriend ( who is the second i 've ever had ) . 
  i learned how to get an intuitive feeling of other people ( fe ) , trying to recognize if they were comfortable or not . 
  and i read a really good book * about * pua : models by mark manson . 
  it 's not like any other pua book because it 's actually a criticism of it . 
  and it basically tells you to forget everything you have read and focus on the important parts :, 
  * talk to any girl ( using your fe to asess the situation of course ), 
  talk to any girl you find attractive because you do n't know what 's happening on their minds : maybe they do want to be approached , maybe not . 
  some of them will think you 're hot , other will think you 're not . 
  there 's somebody out there who * craves * you . 
  but you do n't know who is it , so in the end , it 's really worth it to face your fears and go for it . 
  you will creep some girls out , it 's unavoidable ; but you 'll get good as you progress so you 've better get started already . 
  * recognize that flirting has a small rate of success . 
  very few girls will be attracted to you . 
  if a pua has had sex with a hundred different women , it 's because he 's been rejected thousands of times . 
  so develop a `` thick skin '' and go for it . 
  * touch her, 
  the great difference between having a girlfriend and having a female friend is sexuality . 
  you do have to touch her and progress at at a pace that your sense of feeling will tell you . 
  i 've personally devloped a method : get close to her ( intimate zone , bordering personal ) once the initial small talk is done and every time you agree with her on something , say something on the likes of `` i know right ? '', 
  touch her forearm lightly . 
  as the conversation progresses , touch her leg starting by a light tap close to the kneecap and advance to the thigh ; at this stage , it 's a good strategy to tell her : `` wow , your boyfriend must enjoy doing x with you ! '' . 
  by doing that you give her the chance of escaping by replying that she does have a boyfriend , but if she replies she does n't you may take it as a sign that you can progress ( be mindful of other cues though ) .
