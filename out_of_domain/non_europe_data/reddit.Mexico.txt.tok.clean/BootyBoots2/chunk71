  be wary of body language signs ( mostly wanting to leave ) ; if she avoids you in some way , stop it already . 
  if she has no problem with you invading her intimate space -- leaning towards her -- and touching her thighs for relatively long periods of time ( 3-5 seconds , close to the pubic area ) , then you 're in for the kiss . 
  also , remember that different girls have different levels of `` permeability '' , so while you may get sexual with a girl on the first couple of hours , other can take several dates to reach this stage . 
  trust your feels . 
  to be fair , it looks like anoian does n't believe in the patriarchal system of the biblical times ; it 's just that he acknowledges that they were ignorant and `` god 's law '' was the only code of conduct they had back in the day . 
  being a christian , he enshrines the way people stuck to them because they had strong beliefs that those archaic practices were the commanded by god himself , even if that meant not questioning the fact that they may have been created by the mysoginist people of ancient israel . 
  yes motherfuckers , [ you call mexico ] ( http://s01.s3c.es/imag/efe/2009/04/19/2115674w.jpg ) . 
  it 's funny how trump supporters are -- apparently , quite frankly i have n't really checked -- not quite dissappointed about the ban on muslims not definitive and just `` a suggestion '' . 
  it 's quite a different thing from `` a complete and total ban on muslims until our representatives can figure out what the hell is going on '' . 
  does that mean the wall is just a suggestion too ? 
  women being -- further -- punished for abortions is a suggestion too ? 
  the man is backing up from stuff that was pretty central in his campaign , and nobody bats an eye ... 
  i wonder what will happen when muslims or jews refrain to hire these people on the grounds of `` religious liberty '' granted by the overturning of this bill .

  [ literally the mexican song for saluting the flag , always ( at least in my exprerience ) played before the anthem ], 
  do n't get me wrong : i 'm mexican and i recognize they have the right to secure their borders in any way they see fit . 
  i actually support the idea of the wall . 
  just not * trump 's * wall . 
  it 's outrageous to build the wall on the premise that we 're a threat and that we 're all potential rapists and they 're going to toll * mexicans * for it . 
  what ? 
  why us ? 
  the fact that you have your unsolicited military presence on europe `` protecting it '' does n't mean other nations have to pay for the expenses of yours . 
  want a wall ? 
  fine , pay it yourself !, 
  it 's not the mexican middle class ' fault that our politicians are shitty ( it 's not like we have n't fucking tried to fix it from the inside , trust me ) . 
  moreover , why is mexico going to pay for the wall when so many central americans cross the border every day ? 
  it sounds like trump likes it simple . 
  perhaps * too simple * ( `` every person who crosses the border must be mexican '' ) . 
  what baffles me is wondering how is he going to handle a major event ; those where the american action is really needed ( major natural disaster , economic crisis , major terrorist act , `` based putin '' making cucks out of america [ to speak in terms the_donald understands ] , the never ending chinese hunger to swallow industries to raise its poors , long etc ) . 
  true . 
  but his ardent supporters should see it as a red flag that their champion actually wo n't deliver the extreme measures he promised in the first place ... 
  [ unless ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grwbioir04c ), 
  unless republican voters wanted major republican candidates out of the race in the first place right out from the start . 
  to achieve this , they had to elect trump ; but this was only the means and not the goal . 
   ~ ~ religion ~ ~ christianity is ~ ~ protected ~ ~ shoved down people 's throats 'till they love it . 
  despite what some americans may believe , the high lords of the us government do anything it takes to further their agendas . 
  hardly anything apart from the european theatre of wwii can be even hinted as `` honorable '' . 
  building the wall would be very hipocritical . 
  but hey , when has hipocrisy stopped them from doing anything they can ? 
  i do n't know why the fuck is the notion of living in an organized , neat , clean , happy , civilized place `` feminine '' . 
  in the end , it 's all we want : safety , happiness and efficiency . 
  but no , lem me display my crotch like in the old west , where rural bandits can plan to steal other 's property while saying `` maaan '' ( mine ) with their perfect teeth . 
  tell mr. spaghetti hair about it ... 
  well , il mio car\u00edssimo robotti , you are implying that i would pick spaghetti for the rest of my life if i was pressed to do so , in which you incur in the cognitive error of mind reading . 
  still , i 'm a person who really can eat the same type of food every single day and not be grossed out by it . 
  so spaghetti really sounds like a good choice since it 's so cheap and easy to prepare , in terms of practicality . 
  nonetheless , it 's a carbohydrate-rich food , and not very healthy for me to consume as a single source of energy given my sedentary lifestyle . 
  well , if i did n't misinterpret your point , you were stating that pick-up trucks tend to be marketed towards men ( the clearest example being the `` wild west '' commercial ) . 
  if having it rough , caring for one 's own , and surviving in a hostile environment is manly , then the intuitive thing is that when somebody feels comfortable in the opposite conditions ( caring , coopertive , friendly ) , then that person has a preference for the `` feminine '' . 
  this jumps out because from a rational standpoint , the honda commercial does n't have any appeal to the traditional western feminity image whatsoever ; it 's just portrayed as friendly as opposed to tough , and judging by this section of your comment, 
   insfoar as cars go , hondas are n't `` masculine '' with v8 's and rear-wheel drive . 
  to illustrate this fantasy -- just look at how they are advertised , and for whom they are targeted . 
  keep in mind the vast majority of these are bought by suburban men , software developers and insurance salesmen , not wildcatters and loggers . 
  if your perception is indeed true , then people who are affected by these commercials should be the ones who claim that hondas are `` feminine '' cars because they 're eco-friendly and used by happy people in friendly cities .

  the need to [ anschlu\u00df ] ( http://www.writerightwords.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/5113847621_10e4cbdb2e_b.jpg ) . 
  the time has come ** for me to wield [ mein panzerfaust ] ( https://i.imgflip.com/i84eq.jpg ) **, 
  ### once moaaaaaar ! ###, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ yes , i know this comment is a grammar disgrace as well , but it 's satire so it does n't really count, 
  dammit bot , you 're ruining the joke !, 
  [ absolutely nothing !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogckfzgafq0 ), 
  seriously , i think this is one of those ideas that sounds great on paper , but it will be awful on the long run . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : i think laws effectively influence the attitudes of people , and this law may lead to people arguing gun control is not necessary because people would be `` trained '' regarding guns ; thus making the us ' gun problem worse . 
  children should n't be instructed to use guns becuase the vast majority are not mature enough to use them . 
  in my opinion , laws do have a significant contribution to the collective mentality of people ( sure , there is a lot of racism in the us ; but i think present day 's racists are nothing in comparison to the racists back in the time when it was legal to own slaves , or when the segregation was enforced ) . 
  some people argue that violent media encourages people to commit violent acts , but i think media is just a catalyst for crime when people are exposed to violent environments . 
  e.g : black people may have been inspired by a hip hop song that glorifies crime to commit an actual crime ; but in the end the song would have had no effect if they had n't lived on adverse conditions in the first place . 
  in my perception , this law means people have given up to any form of sensible gun control . 
  moreover , i feel children should n't handle guns because they 're not mature enough to use them . 
  personally , i would n't teach my child to use a drill or a car until they reach a certain age -- 15 to say a number -- where they can really understand they are using a tool that can be lethal when handled improperly , i think it 's unacceptable to prepare them ( or almost any civillian ) to use a tool * whose main purpose is to kill * . 
  using a gun safely does n't necessarily mean there will be no accidents regarding guns . 
  although it can reduce a lot of accidents , this does n't mean people ( not just children ) will be qualified to use proper tactics to protect themselves in distress situations that must be handled by competent authorities . 
  the thread that was originally commented by avanbeek links to an article that hints that some russian schools want to give a more structured military training to schoolchildren , which is a completely different situation than the one discussed in the american context : ( if the article is to be trusted ) russia wants to structure militias -- the article ambiguously calls them `` military movements '' -- into organized movements , and perhaps draw people to military culture and encourage them to pursue a military career . 
  the us just wants to play being a cop . 
  educated about them , yes . 
  get a blueprint and a replica and teach them which parts fulfill which functions . 
  ** stress that guns must be treated with respect and they are not toys ** . 
  teach them where the safety mechanisms are located and how to safely carry/transport/clean / * handle * them . 
  but that 's as far as you should get , in my opinion . 
  no aiming , no shooting , no reloading ; in short , not teaching them the specifics about how to * operate * them . 
  at this point , we 're talking about a blanket measure to try to prevent problems due to a much deeper issue . 
  but if this can save a handful of lives , then it is worth giving it a try . 
  or end your misery on a blood splatter . 
  yankbot , i know you wo n't answer back , but you 're my favorite bot ever . 
  i love you . 
  i would n't say `` retarded '' . 
  i feel it 's more like yankbot is from the midwest while elsbot is from florida . 
  different flavors for the same thing . 
  agreed . 
  you 're on the intp realm . 
  i feel like most of us work like the way you describe . 
  of course , there are different levels of intensity , so work on your weaknesses and exploit your abilities !, 
  speaking about european cuisine , it does n't really matter ; it 's all going to become kebab in 25 years or so . 
  it 's sad and ironic that they 'll lose all of their diversity for being inclusive with the terrorists , but hey : they 'll reap what they sow . 
  while i understand the spirit in which this post was written , i can do nothing but to cringe hard at this .
