  i agree with you when you say kia is anywhere close to the_donald . 
  my point is that it could be the case ( turning into a blatant hate subreddit ) if you let your paranoid sections of users take over ; generalizing about people and expressing their hate/insecurities loudly . 
  but it looks like your mods are doing a great job at not letting that happen . 
  i 'm waiting for misandryomgguize to debate your argument , as i want to judge the arguments of both parts . 
  if they do n't answer , consider yourself awarded with an inverted delta for * confirming * my view . 
  thanks for your involvement !, 
  take screenshots and post them to the bunch so you can circlejerk about being civilized !, 
  one for the team . 
  it 's long and well-formatted . 
  but if you deepen in the context of the quotes the author brought up for examination , you 'll notice their claim is very weak . 
  the only quote that raised my eyebrow was the one of the `` niggerfaggots '' , but even that one has a context of a comedy sketch . 
  i 'd advise kia to tone down their circlejerk a bit , but in my book , it 's far from being a hate subreddit . 
   this is really entirely dependant on what you consider a ` hate subreddit ', 
  for me , a hate subreddit actively promotes violence/discrimination and tries to spread ideas about a group of people being inherently bad ( dangerous , stupid , unfit to enter a society ) based solely on perceptions rooted on fear and prejudice ( read : misinterpretation/manipulation of descriptive statistics ) . 
  a feature of these people is that they tend to expect people of said group to do what they fear they 'll do ( `` all terrorists are muslims so we will be harmed from terorrism is we let them in ! '' ) . 
  another one is they want to `` easily identify '' the people on those groups to express their hatred , ostracize , assault or in general `` be prepared '' for the case they attacked as they expect from said group [ like when people made a huge mess about the sikh guy because they thought he was muslim and therefore , dangerous ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/29/sikh-man-arrested-bus-terrorist-bomb-islamophobia ) . 
  context is important and there 's a big part of it you have to take into account . 
  also , this post turned out to be extremely long because of the style in which i cite people , formatted to make it easier to read , so i 'll post my response in three parts , this is part 1 . 
  * kia thrives in sarcastic comments . 
  sometimes , these sarcasm is way too over the top ( censurable ) , like with the `` niggerfaggots '' comment . 
  * gamergate is extremely controversial , and while there are lies and hatred on all sides ( gamergate was even banned from 4chan , giving birth to 8chan ) , kia has apparently been pounded since it 's inception from media , and the media -- as we know it -- [ can lie ] ( https://archive.is/8r1xw ) ( i know it 's a telegraph article about how the guardian lied , but how can you be so sure the telegraph is a reliable source and they do n't lie when convenient ? ) . 
  having said this , kia is not a subreddit which you can expect to be politically correct at all , and this is where they can come off as hateful . 
  #rape and rapecounseling are equal to coontown . 
   this is a subreddit where 217 people can celebrate the idea that blocking them from a subreddit makes that sub as bad as an obvious and vile hate subreddit . 
  no it 's not . 
  that response was the top comment to a r/showerofthoughts discussion where the premise was that r/rape and r/rapecounseling are discriminating girls who could need their help by banning everyone who has even posted in certain subreddits ; kia being one of them . 
  i think it 's easy to agree that this is a terrible implication of a harsh moderator decision . 
  the post by wasniahc [ +175 ] directly below the one you cited , argues that is over-the-top to compare r/rape and r/rapecounseling with coontown . 
   this , for starters , tells us people who have posted on kia are considered a problem by those two subreddits , which is itself evidence . 
  this sounds like fallacious reasoning : not being allowed to post does n't in a certain subreddit does n't mean the sender subreddit is necessarily a hate sub ; it 's just a measure the mods took because of thinking of the recipient subreddit should n't accept redditors from the sending subreddit ; as they perceive them as troublesome ( which can be true or false , kia argues this is unfair to potential kia-simpathizing victims of rape ) . 
  #amy schumer, 
   kia largely downplays that misogyny is a serious issue . 
  it 's telling that they would even talk so much about accusations of sexism that are n't directed at themselves : it 's because they want to be able to deny misogyny is serious or real . 
  seems like [ they 're celebrating ( and supporting ) ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/4lg1az/twitter_bullshit_liana_throwing_some_truth/ ) that a woman is tackling issues about sexism and agree with a woman when she critizices `` white nights '' for complaining too much and doing too little . 
   this is also the behaviour of a group that wants to violently harm women 's interests . 
  how come ? 
   i think it 's also fair to consider this in light of how seriously they take discrimination against themselves ( kia , more or less , views relatively minor discrimination against themselves as far , far more serious as discrimination against women , and at least equal to open racial hatred ) . 
  their stated objective is to denounce corruption in gaming , propelled by the social justice crowd . 
  it 's reasonable that achieving social justice goes to a secondary plane to them . 
  more so when they perceive their active opponents do seek to achieve a distorted view of social justice where the `` oppresed '' groups get unfair benefits and can not be question or they risk being excluded ( i 'm not saying this is what actually happens , i 'm intuiting that this is the way the vast majority of kia feels about what they call sjws ) or `` blacklisted '' . 
   it 's also funny , because white women are infinitely more privileged that white men . 
    again , with this quote , we have the denial of misogyny as serious , real or relevant , which is an attitude that has obvious and real consequences against women . 
  no it 's not . 
  it was a sarcastic remark using a `` buzzword '' ( privilege ) that is commonly associated to sjws in a [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/4b2x6q/woman_screams_at_reporter_to_leave_because_he_is/d15s0eg ) that discusses the questionable behavior of a person who fits the stereotype for sjw [ who urges a reporter to leave and calls him a `` fucking white male '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hk1hfud_d4&amp;feature=youtu.be ) ( note : they are making fun of a person who made a sexist , racist and censoring remark in a single sentence ) . 
  ## part 2, 
  #roosh and profiling, 
   this quote is interesting because it meets your second ` feature ' , about easy identification , almost to the letter, 
    misogynist '' is a hyperbole here . 
  he is a pick-up artist . 
  he , like many pua , have extremely objectifying thoughts ( no literally , the whole 9 yard `` bang girls for points '' mentality you see in those cheesy college frat boys movie ) on women , but it is almost contradictory to say they `` hate '' women ( i mean , they just want sex , not rape/murder/harm ), 
   this quote essentially says that only rape , murder or physical violence genuinely qualify as hatred . 
  now , do you consider rooshv someone who actively promotes violence and discrimination against women and actively tries to spread ideas about them being bad ? 
  i would think you would have to , and it 's telling that kia is here trying to say that he is n't even a misogynist . 
  read the [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/2qowzf/psa_reaxxion_is_not_our_friend/ ) . 
  op is suggesting that is not a good idea to be associated with such a character . 
  therea are many different users who disagree that kia should have contact with this guy because his views are violent and archaic . 
  others argue that swjs will make them `` guilty by association '' ( a self-fulfilling prophecy , taking into account this excerpt made it into a hsrotd 's fallacious compilation ) anyway . 
  within the thread , there 's a link to [ another thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/2jxthl/response_to_pastebin_about_return_of_kings/ ) , that has a similar discussion of the same topic . 
  notice how the most upvoted comment did n't even reach 35 upvotes . 
  in the case of the post with zero upvotes notice the top comment has 35 upvotes , the general thread has 0 upvotes and the thread has 241 responses . 
  i think that 's a clear giveaway that kia users did n't agree with each other 's views regarding rooshs ' involvement with the movement . 
   the next two arguments are pretty ambiguous, 
    hair dye ? 
  check . 
  white and privileged ? 
  check . 
  token black girl ( look everyone , we 're diverse ! ) ? 
  check . 
   this meets your second feature , and maybe ` the blue haired beluga makes a rare appearance ' does as well, 
  both statements are inappropriate and do fall within my second feature . 
  still , if you bother to follow the [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/3m4t8d/the_woman_who_started_shirtstorm_was_invited_to/cvbzsq3 ) , you 'll find the thread was making fun of google inviting a bunch of well-known feminists -- [ including the one who started a major controversy about dr. matt taylor that ended up in him apologizing to tears ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/shirtstorm ) -- to a talk about fighting online abuse . 
  the irony should be obvious . 
   i have to ask you why you do n't consider the systemic devaluation of women 's interests and issues , and the systemic dismissal of misogyny as real or problematic , does not constitute good evidence ? 
  i would consider it good evidence , it that were the case . 
  the cases made were citing kias user completely out of context and making fallacious remarks about them . 
  i am open to the possibility that , in this particular moment , kia is indeed a hate subreddit that conceals its hatred really well , but the lack of hard evidence about it and the fallacies and abundance of argumentative errors that can be found by analyzing the `` evidence '' contained in the hsrotd argument point to the direction that , in this specific period in time , kia is * not * a hate subreddit . 
  i see . 
  thank you for your contribution !, 
   i also have a hard time believing that a group of people who have so much problem with people censoring their supposed ` sarcasm ' is really being sarcastic . 
  i also have a hard time seeing that too . 
  that 's the reason why i suggested zhangar that it would be a good idea to tell kia users to downplay their sarcasm a few notches . 
  even though they are not nearly close as the_donald , being sarcastic and associating with the alt-right can become a slippery slope . 
  but that 's a conjecture of mine . 
   i do n't see how this means what i said there was not true . 
  clearly , 217 people thought that blocking kia users from posting in those subreddits was as bad or worse than extreme , open and hateful racism . 
  i do n't see how , even in light of your response , you 're reading that differently . 
  because you conveniently did n't acknowledge that there was post countering the one directly above it , and 175 people agreed with it !, 
   i 'm not presenting a series of arguments that , in isolation , are supposed to necessarily prove that kia is a hate sub . 
  i 'm building a case for why they likely are . 
  testimony is good evidence to this end , hence i brought up the news media sources , and hence i point out that kia users are banned from those rape counselling-related subreddits . 
  and i linked to the telegraph exposing a media outlet as capable of lying because i do n't consider the attitudes or opinions of external media outlets or other subreddits valid pieces of evidence . 
  i would consider them * only * if they link to evidence found * within the subreddit * , as only the bad behavior of their userbase can tell if they are part of a subreddit that engages into hateful discourse . 
   if you suspected the kkk was racist against black people and learnt that you could n't wear their uniform in a majority-black neighbourhood without encountering hostility , you 'd have some evidence , however incremental , that supports your conclusion . 
  ok , i 'll build upon your example . 
  if i were to prove that the kkk is racist and horrible , i would n't reason that maybe they are racists because black people do n't like their uniform , as there may be thousands of reasons for this . 
  if i were to prove that the kkk is racist i gather evidence out of compelling , in-context pieces of unfalsifiable evidence , like videotaping a racist manifesto handed out by a leader or watching how they gather together to crucify and burn a black person . 
  people call these guys misogynistic , but i ca n't find any comments that are obvert misogyny like `` fuck women '' ; `` they 're only useful for sex '' ; `` men are the superior gender '' . 
  instead , the claim is that they `` downplay '' the struggle of women by circlejerking to feminists who lie and exaggerate ( like in the case of anita sarkeesian and her [ misinformation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgvyj9ei90y ) or the excessive outrage aimed towards dr. taylor for a simple shirt ) . 
   i do n't really understand the whole notch scenario , but do you really think that the fact that they 're supporting someone who 's largely arguing against outspoken activists for women provides evidence that they 're not a hate subreddit ? 
  it seems far more likely that they 're simply supporting whoever criticises their ` enemies ' i.e.
