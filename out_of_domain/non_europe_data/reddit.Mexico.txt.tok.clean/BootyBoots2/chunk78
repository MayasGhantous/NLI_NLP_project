  also , how about access to tranquilizer darts and riot-control methods ? 
  i think guns are extremely commonplace , but finding a juggernaut suit ( does it work like in call of duty , though ? ), 
  which is body armor does n't sound easy to get in the us . 
  thanks for the insight !, 
  taking into account it 's a `` no trespassing '' sign for a ( probably nuclear ) missile launch facility , i think it 's just a cheeky joke . 
  you * will be shot * , and they wo n't care about the cost of bullets ... 
  holy shit , that 's dank . 
  it would be awesome if a company started developing non-lethal , efficient tech specifically for home defense . 
  i wonder how would the american populace view the 2nd ammendment if self-defense was no longer an excuse to carry a gun -- as we know them in present day -- anymore ( taking into account the supreme court ruling interpretation of the 2nd ammendment where they said militias are not necessary and that self defense was the main focus all along ) . 
  but , is it guns or lethal ordnance ? 
  do these people want an excuse too shoot * and kill * criminals ( or people for that matter ) ? 
  while i lust her more in the shopped version , i acknowledge she looks fantastic , even without the huge ass . 
  i love living in mexco . 
  we have marochi and lacos . 
  could you blame him , though ? 
  today 's racists have no excuse for their ignorance ; but back in the dawn of the xx century , the human genome had n't been broken yet and genetics was on its baby steps . 
  with such a limited worldview , i dare to say that without proper contact with other races and being ignorant of how science works , that train of thought was natural to a certain extent . 
  i had to dive into the depths of all comments to find yours . 
  i think i 'll hang on with you now . 
  i really do n't understand what 's about bashing kia . 
  yes , their mission sounds odd ( why could you care about gaming journalism ethics in the first place ? 
  it 's not like it 's influential on more important matters like politics ) , and they kind of have expanded more into sjws and other affaires ; yes , they are a bunch of edgy rascals and sometimes their sarcasm raises eyebrows and some of them get to say some really stupid shit once in a while ... 
  but why do people feel the rush to call them haters at all time , ceasslessly ? 
  i started a thread in cmv about kia being a hate sub ( about 180 children ) and all they did was to throw shit at each other rather than proving it 's an actual hate sub . 
  for the love of god , do n't call that article `` excellent '' . 
  it 's the poorest , most biased review of anything i have ever read . 
  maybe kia * is * a hate sub . 
  that article , by taking quotes out of context and getting its point accross in a childish tone , makes you wonder if the writer does n't just hate kia itself . 
  which is a shame , it 's well edited for being such a massive text wall , and the great amount of effort is easily visible . 
  whatever . 
  she 's gorgeous . 
  i like her hair color picks , they look good on her !, 
  plus , she 's got some sick tatts ( this coming form a guy who 's not so much into tattoed girls ) . 
  and overall a beautuful face and nice , round shapes . 
  this sub rocks . 
  agreed . 
  hmmmm ... 
  i have just recently joined this sub , so i do n't know if you have recently came up with some of these girls , but my suggestions would be :, 
  * joanna bliss . 
  * anna song . 
  * september carrino . 
  * shelby gibson ( if they 're into mature women ) . 
  * diamond kitty . 
  * carmella bing . 
  * leanne crow . 
  * harmony reigns . 
  * ninja edit : selena star . 
  the united states of america ... 
  for all i love that country , i have to say the one attitude i hate the most about its citizens goes somewhere along the line of `` we are the most powerful country and hence we have the right to make the world our bitch simply because we can '' . 
  the germans thought they were superior , and the world united against them . 
  i 'm afraid of what will happen when the world stops being afraid of nukes . 
  so , what was the point of `` saving -- american -- lives '' with the japanese nukes , again ? 
  interesting proposal . 
  you would have to first define what exactly is `` hateful '' , `` xenophobic '' , `` ultra-nationalistic '' or `` bigotry '' , and design an algorithm that objectively identifies that behavior . 
  it 's important to note context is relevant ( a sarcastic/ironic comment here at sas could pass as bigotry when it 's actually mocking ) , and the algorithm has to take those subleties into account . 
  i started a thread on cmv about kia and one guy showed me how they [ * welcomed * ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/3xmld9/im_a_former_rgamerghazi_mod_ama/ ) an ex-mod that got kicked out of ghazi . 
  good lord , you 're pressing me !, 
  ( it 's difficult to narrow them ! ), 
  * anna song . 
  she has heavenly looks though ... 
  i was just thinking a few hours ago that maybe , subs like againsthatesubreddits could turn out to be ( by design or accidentally ) hate subreddits themselves . 
  they just found the perfect group to satisfy their need to hate somebody : haters . 
  hardly anyone will frown upon you if you hate on nazis or islamic extremists , as they provoke a negative emotional reaction that the general populace does n't enjoy ( which is perfectly understandable ) . 
  so we could say hating those groups is socially acceptable ( which is easy to understand but not acceptable though ) . 
  back to kia itself , i find amusing most anti-kia people point out hardly any of kia 's content is related to games and mostly focuses on detracting a certain brand of feminism and sjws , but if you go to ghazi 's frontpage you 'll find ... mostly content supporting the brand of feminism tha kia dislikes and sjws , effectively antagonizing kia ( still more about gaming than kia , though ) , which conveniently no detractor of kia has ever pointed out to me . 
  whose idea was to create yankbot to refresh the bullshit these loons said a while ago ? 
  man/girl ... 
  i wan na buy you a beer or something . 
  do some americans hate their identity ? 
  i mean , the republic is completely antagonist of royalty ( you have to forfeit your titles gave by nobility if you were to become american , as far as i understand ) . 
  if they abide with the `` true melting pot '' theme , then why the rush to highlight their `` genetic heritage '' , and moreover preserving and accentuating it ? 
  ** edit : ** holy shit . 
  this thread is the sas master thread : the one to rule them all . 
  it 's like that delicious chocolate cake that has a glorious taste but will get you cloyed pretty quickly . 
  this is a great commercial . 
  it 's becoming a thing though ; this is anecdotal but here in mexico the nfl is getting a motherload of advertising , and it 's becoming bigger -- in the sense that it 's gathering more attention -- as time passes by ( it definitely wo n't match what happens in the us the day the superbowl is transmitted , but still ) . 
  a person performs a cool trick , and what is the main focus ? 
  big hands , and whether this person is a man or a woman ... 
  oxus , if you see this then notice me sempai !, 
  oh , hold on your horses , my red pilled friend . 
  men -- like me ! -- masturbate a lot , and that is indeed waste of sperm . 
  waste of millions of poor potential newborns of our descendance with our very own features lost forever in a single wank ... 
  tragic indeed , but that 's how it goes . 
  how it * must go * if you are a responsible person , because even if you 're an absolute stallion -- and i 've no doubt you are -- and you only release your load inside a lustful , gaping woman ; those millons of spermatozoids will die because that 's what contraception is for . 
   your high moral prince/princess ? 
  no , i am not a high moral prince . 
  a man does not keep his morality when he obeys the orders of [ die f\u00dchrer ] ( https://emception.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/grammar.jpg ) . 
  so please replace the first question mark with a comma and decapitalize the first letter in `` your '' or complete the question by writing `` are you '' instead of `` your '' , i will leave that decision to your fine judgement . 
  are you walder frey ? 
  [ thank you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkbylrvx8gy#t=0m35s ) . 
  so it was burger king !!,

  it must be legit frustrating to live in a modern country revered by its peacefulness , quality engineering , abundance of hot women , economic prosperity , cultural riches , its relavant impact on history , quality football , the great amounty of scientists , philosophers and scholars who contributed greatly to human knowledge , beautiful landscapes and landmarks -- amongst many other things -- that ignorant people just keep bashing nonstop about a horrible war that happened generations ago ( where hardly anyone who played a part at the time is alive today ) and that the ignorant citizens of that country who blame * you * for the atrocities of your ancestors actually defend the most massive killing of civillians that has ever happened with a single bomb in human history ; an atrocity commited by their home country , most ironically . 
  ** edit ** : just looked what `` arbeit macht frei '' means : `` work sets you free '' . 
  is n't that nazi saying * perfectly * compatible with today 's american obsession with `` self reliance '' ? 
  many a redditor 's conscious and subconscious minds are quite synchronized . 
  if i distributed american propaganda , i think they would easily believe in m\u1ef9 lais . 
  what 's a `` citizen arrest '' ? 
  happy cake day !, 
  you know ... there comes a point where the physical prowess is so admirable , it 's not sexually attractive anymore .
