  this girl is impressive . 
  that spinning '' @ '' symbol at the end though ... 
  so much nostalgia . 
  wat an awesome rant bot , is n't it ? 
  i took the 16personalities yet again and when i hit the results button i was thinking , `` here we go . 
  aaaaaaaaaand in ** f ** p what the fuck ? '', 
  turns out my perspective on many issues has changed ( adapted and relaxed0 ) as i matured as an intp . 
  great body shape !, 
  also , nice tan !, 
  it also means we are way faster and work at maximum power output at all times , so we can explode sometimes ; making us the perfect vehicle to drop the nukes . 
  are you serious in that statement ? 
  i mean , part of the circlejerk is to imitate the people we mock but sometimes it comes off pretty accurately and natural ; so we have to add a / s. 
  bloody yes . 
  those things were heavy , though !, 
  there are people who do it overly well and thus , their sarcasm is not obviously notorious like in talentlessbluepanda 's case . 
  some dudes really need the / s. 
  she 's beautiful , i love that type of hips . 
  i really do n't know what 's all about the french-american friendship criclejerk . 
  as a mexican , i cringe every time this gets brought up because people hardly ever remember that if france helped the us secede from the british empire , it was because the british were a powerful force to be reckoned with , and it was everyone 's gain to be the top empire of the world ( france and spain combined their navies to fight off the brits ; not solely because of jolly cooperation , i believe ) . 
  take the battle of may the 5th and the following french occupation into account . 
  the french invaded mexico ; and who provided ammunition , uniforms and other goods ? 
  the us . 
  it 's almost like if france wanted to take over mexico to have a platform to invade the us , or expand on american -- continent -- colonies . 
  countries make alliances , people make friends . 
  congratulations , you think like a normal person . 
  it seems like some americans think that cultural attitudes are embedded in people 's genetics for some reason . 
  it looks good , but ... 
  if you could take a few more pictures of yourself from a little bit further to appreciate your roundedness ; we would appreciate it better !, 
   also where do you get this information of france wanting to take over mexico to eventually take over usa ? 
  i was never taught that . 
  i read it somewhere ... take it as a conjecture of mine . 
  the us was vulnerable at the time , and mexico has been vulnerable since its independence . 
   if they would have wanted they would have installed a real empire there but maximilian never received the support he asked for . 
  yeah ... 
  the sad story of maximillian . 
  i 'm glad that prussia started feeling aggressive towards france ; so the french withdrew most the army 's forces , paving the way for ju\u00e1rez to work his way back to mexico city ( and executing maximillian , thus ending the second french occupation of mexico ) . 
  but on the other hand , maximillian 's mistake was to have a middle ground between two opposite factions . 
  not taking a side and trying to conciliate two points of view can cost you your life . 
  i 'm mexican , and i think the wall may be a good idea to control immigration . 
  all countries have the right to secure their borders the way they see fit ( within reasonable boundaries ) . 
  patriotism is generally a good thing . 
  * exacerbated nationalism * is what is toxic ; people just need reality checks every once in a while . 
  moreover , their bodies and minds are not sufficiently developed to engage in a sexual relationship . 
  having a sexual relationship with any girl who has n't reached puberty yet ( the stage where bodily sexual maturity starts !! ), 
  will probably end up in the girl being injured . 
  this not even taking into account the psychological damage . 
  there 's no way you can justify a sexual relationship with a pre-pubescent person . 
  post-pubescent people are another deal , as their bodies are ( at least theoretically ) able to sustain a sexual relationship . 
  nevertheless , it 's necessary to have laws stating a hard limit below which it 's illegal to have sexual relationships with anybody ( the age of consent ) . 
  it 's gratifying to see such a high-quality resolution of this amazing girl . 
  curvyness aside , i love her full lips , `` innocent '' gaze and how her hair is not entirely straight . 
  native speaker of spanish with english as a second language currently learning russian . 
  the first thing i do when i wake up in the morning is to visit a list of russian words and memorize five of them , to do so i :, 
  * write them up in my whiteboard ( to check them later if i forget ) . 
  * make individual associations of every word with something that rings a bell for me . 
  example : \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c ( slyedovat ' ) means `` to follow '' , so i imagined a guy * following * another person across a slide using a * bat-shaped sled * . 
  i incorpotated a way to memorize the meaning and recall a difficult ( because it 's unrelated to the english language ) word by recalling an image that made sense to me and why i bestowed that image to the word in the first place . 
  * in order to remember which were the five words , i make up a quick sentence/story about them . 
  for example , if my words are : `` full '' , `` here '' , `` collection '' , `` garden '' and `` barely '' i 'll make up a sentence like : `` he * barely * arrived * here * in time to see my * full * * collection * of * garden * flowers '' . 
  i 'll stop at the english translation of every word that i 'm learning in russian and them remember what was the russian word , then carry on with the rest of the sentence in english , doing the proper pauses . 
  the point of doing this early is to remember them every two hours . 
  it 's difficult at first , but as the day progresses , it becomes easier to recall the words and their meanings . 
  twice every week i review the word lists from the beginning and cover the english translation , so i remember the english meaning of words written in cyrillic script . 
  i hope this helps . 
   you never see two people making amends in the name of their country , only killing each other . 
  [ here 's one ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/14/ar2007041400627.html ) . 
  i think you can look for another one if you want to challenge your view . 
  oh , did this person meant [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/azteken-menschenopfer.jpg/400px-azteken-menschenopfer.jpg ) ? 
  well , i guess it was a little tradeoff to live in a huge , splendorous , vibrant city with an efficient tributary system , monumental architecture , huge amount of cultural legacy , food security and widespread education for all classes -- respectively -- that the northern native americans in the current american and canadian territories could only have dreamt of having ( the letter to chief washington was touching and on-point , though ) . 
  but , yeah . 
  we clearly were the [ uncivilized ] ( http://www.entornoturistico.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/la-ciudad.jpg ) , [ violent ] ( http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/thanksgiving-guilt-trip-how-warlike-were-native-americans-before-europeans-showed-up/ ) ones . 
  that person seems ... dictator-y with a whiff of genocidal , but i 'm judging without actually knowing who i 'm talking about . 
  could you illustrate me on who that man is/was ? 
  patriotism is great for nation-building . 
  a unified national identity is necessary : people 's countries can collapse if there is not something to unify them , and it 's healthy to derive a sense of pride on it . 
  true , national chauvinism is a great envelope to saciate the lust for power that has caused so much death in mankind ( like many other `` envelopes '' such as racial bigotry , religious intolerance/deus vult mentality , stalinism , etc. 
  ) , but that 's an extreme form of something that -- i believe -- is healthy and necessary in relatively small doses .

   my very liberal friends think that this means i 'm ok with school shootings and think anyone should be allowed open-carry everywhere they go ; my more conservative friends think that this means i want to make it impossible for people to get guns . 
  both get angry ... 
  i call this `` the maximillian mistake '' for maximillian of habsburg . 
  he was welcomed to mexico by the rich conservative mexican class that wanted to preserve its privilege by supporting a monarch , as opposed to liberals who wanted mexico to become a republic once again . 
  turns out he was a liberal monarch . 
  got shot by ju\u00e1rez . 
  morale of the story : when people are polarized , trying to conciliate a middle ground could be your life ( i belive this also happened to ghandi because of the muslim-hindu riots when pakistan seceded from india ) . 
  * realize that there are times where logic will do no good to you ( many `` illogical '' social situations/conventions that have a reason of existing but anyone knows/cares to explain to you ) . 
  * try to empathize with people ; ask yourself , how would i feel if x happened to me ? 
  * realize that * every * person causes at least a minor emotional impact on others , including you . 
  take that to your advantage and try to get your best look to provoke the most favorable reactions from people .
