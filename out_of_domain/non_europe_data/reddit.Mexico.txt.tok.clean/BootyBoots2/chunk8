  not complaining , even when right . 
  i disliked the fact that my ex girlfriend expected me to do stuff without her telling me anything , and now i 'm putting up with something i should n't and would be fixed just by talking . 
  double standards ... 
  knowledge is power . 
  at a certain extent ; one gets power and independence trough abilities , not just pure knowledge . 
  sure , knowledge is power when it comes to having privileged information , but of what use is it if you do n't take the measures to take advantage of it ? 
  those measures usually require the a person of having the tools and abilities to perform the action that is beneficial to him/her . 
  and as long as said person does n't have the abilities or tools to perform himself/herself , he/she is dependent of another person . 
  nevertheless , one can star to acquire the necessary abilities by acquiring knowledge first and then constructing the ability desired , one step at a time . 
  knowledge is not power . 
  is the building block of power . 
  do n't leave us like this bro ... 
  i do n't even know who mckayla is ... 
  male 24 . 
  my first relationship was at age 21 with an enfp . 
  and that happened because i let myself go and give it a try at relationships . 
  porkins . 
  talk about a self-explanatory surname ... 
  the other day i was talking to the emperor , and he almost fried me to death with his lightning . 
  omg , did you see the new tie fighter model ? 
  justin had a chance to test it , i 'm sooooo jealous . 
  you know what ? 
  lets go get some new crystals for my lightsaber ... 
  but first , [ lem me take a #selfie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdemffbs5h0#t=0m56s ), 
  i actually avoid competition . 
  i only do it if there 's no other choice or if it 's not very serious . 
  i ca n't bear failure , especially if i 'm responsible of other people . 
  nevertheless when i 'm engaged in something i care i strive for the best quality possible . 
  by `` how was '' i meant `` describe '', 
  do n't worry . 
  this will be our dirty little secret ... 
  ehhh . . not quite . 
  it was like that a few decades ago , but not any more . 
  now they coerce people around them to work for them , even if they were n't actively voicing their crimes or cooperating with ( uncorrupted ) law enforcement officers . 
  if they see a pretty girl they like , the kidnap her and if she 's lucky the hitman will use her for sex/marry her and on the worst case she can end up in the prostitution marketplace against her will . 
  that also works in a similar fashion in plantations of all sorts . 
  sure , the main source of income are illegal drugs , but why limit to that ? 
  they racketeer the farmers and leave them dry with collecting their `` protection '' money from legal consumption goods such as tomato , avocado , maize and others . 
  the american government most likely does n't label the cartels that way because the cartels do n't have overtly law enforcing motivations , actually the best scenario for them is a failed state where they hold the monopoly of violence and the population is coerced to work for them on the basis of fear . 
  thinking about a bit it makes perfect sense calling them terrorists . 
  they coerce the people in their areas of action to work for them , and viciously murder anyone who opposes to `` leave a message '' . 
  which include beheading , torture and unnecessary dismemberment of the murdered corpses . 
  ( that usually show signs of torture ) media that praises them usually talk about `` control '' and even though the motivation is not political control per se , they do have such control in a couple states ( michoac\u00e1n and guerrero ) that they can afford to setup puppet governments that favor their profiteers . 
  ( like shown on the infamous assault on ayotzinapa ), 
  perhaps the american government does n't label them as terrorists because they have supported the cartels in their incompetence , ( fast and furious ) and directly supplying a terrorist organization would n't sound ok . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : let my only girlfriend seduce me to give it a try on relationships , there were positive and negative aspects of this , overall more good than bad . 
  went on a journey to become a pick up artist . 
  crashed an burned . 
  now seeking to detach from sex and relationships . 
  in summary , they 're good but nothing mindblowing . 
  dude , you are literally me in the past . 
  i had my first ( and only ) girlfriend at age 20 bordering on 21 . 
  [ so i 'm fastening the seat belt on doc 's delorean now ] ( http://www.october212015.com/images/timecircuits.jpg ) . 
  she made the first move , i was reluctant to have a girlfriend because i saw how shitty marriages around me were , ( almost every couple i knew had serious problems/was unhappy/divorced ) but she seduced me and i gave it a try . 
  ( btw if you 're fearful about impregnating the girl you have to fix your mind first or you 're not going to reach orgasm , seriously ) it was a beautiful relationship and i learned a lot from it , but in the end it was not satisfying for a variety of things , so it 's cool , its has a `` magic '' on it 's own and feels good but it 's not the epitome of happiness , besides you 're seeing the positive aspects of it and not taking into account the negative ones , the differences and the arguments . 
  it does have a crappy side you know , not everything are roses . 
  then i thought to myself , well there 's got ta be something else past this , maybe if i have sex with another girl i will experience the awesomeness , maybe if i date another girl i can have another relationship experience , so , how do we start when we are clueless about what to do ? 
  seek knowledge . 
  lots and lots of knowledge . 
  if `` players '' can pull it off , why ca n't i ? 
  like in every ability there has to be a fundamental principle behind it where techniques , tactics and technologies stem from . 
  well , turns out to be that in order to be an awesome pick up artist you have to have a large variety of assets like :, 
  * confidence, 
  * a * major * `` i do n't give a fuck '' mindset, 
  * nice clothing, 
  * hot body, 
  * social status, 
  * carefully groomed image, 
  amongst others . 
  ** but ** there 's an itty bitty detail : girls can smell sexual desire like sharks can smell blood kilometers away . 
  plus , each time i failed , even though i was conscious that rejection is perfectly valid and at a certain extent necessary for girls to choose a right partner and survive , i felt i wanted the earth to swallow me , i 'm not very good at dealing with this . 
  on other types , rejection contributes to the `` i do n't give a fuck '' mindset that furthers their confidence . 
  and of course , us being intp 's means if something does n't work out , the theory is wrong and needs refining !, 
  so you read more and more , and it 's more difficult to recall the sea of concepts , tactics , openers , etc. 
  the more you read , the more you become emotionally invested in the subject and the more frustrated you become if things go wrong , which further creates an image of `` neediness '' that i repeat , women can perceive miles away ( and this drives them further away from you ) because they have evolved as caregivers to know so . 
  and you fall into a vicious circle . 
  most likely that will lead you , naturally or letting reddit guide you , to the red pill system of beliefs . 
  a very toxic one if you 're not * en garde * . 
  in my way , i subscribed to the mgtow philosophy , i know it 's a lie , but as long as i handle it in a goebbles-esque way in order to shield myself of the romantic ideals and sexual urges , it 's fine to me . 
  now i feel liberated . 
  but what do i know ? 
  i 'm just 24 . 
  what difficulties and challenges did you encounter on your academic life ? 
  was college or major difficult to you in a certain way ? 
  i 'm currently studying an undergraduate engineering program . 
  things work differently here in mexico and i 'll lay my situation to you , so you get an idea :, 
  first of all , i thank heavens i 'm a middle class mexican . 
  had i been born in the usa i 'd be in trouble now , because the student loans are huge ( actually i think americans actually compute the life time they 're going to need to pay their loans ) and unforgiving . 
  my university does n't work like that . 
  we pay a ridiculously low contribution each semester ( and that 's optional , you do n't even need to ) and we have a large amount of time to complete our careers ( the time of the career plus half of it if you fall back for some reason ) in my case 6 years , and even if that fails you can get another extra 2 years if you do the paperwork to request it , but i feel very guilty about it . 
  well , there 's 2 reasons it works like that : 1 ^ st , the national polytechnic institute was founded under a socialist mindset , which is cool and 2 ^ nd , our campus is famous for being the strictest on the institute on its respective careers . 
  i requested the overtime , because i 've fallen back pretty hard ( 3 years ) because of advancing slowly ( i admit i have strong demons to fight back such as extreme procrastination and loss of confidence in myself ) due to failing and studying and pulling off my subjects , i 've tried lots of different studying techniques and learned a lot , the hard way . 
  i 've much to thank to the campus ' psychologist , she has helped me a lot . 
  i feel much better now , and kind of enlightened by knowing what 's up with us intp 's , many things fall into place and i had those aha !, 
  moments . 
  i felt curious about other intp 's and their academic experiences and struggles . 
  by the way , you 're taking in average a little bit more than 30 minutes to complete a physics exercise . 
  in my experience , that 's pretty standard . 
   i thought that nazis were cool-looking, 
  they were .
