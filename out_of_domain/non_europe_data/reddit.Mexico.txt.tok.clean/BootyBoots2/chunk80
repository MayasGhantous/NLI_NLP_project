  * ( if you 're a heterosexual dude ) when attempting to flirt with a girl , remember to never be * verbally * explicit in your sexual intentions , progress little by little , one step at a time ( and one fuck-up at a time , to be honest ) , do n't think on strategies , * do n't read books * and just let your feelings guide you . 
  and now , the golden rule that enables the others above : ** do n't be afraid of failiure ** . 
  if you fuck it up and embarrass yourself big time , do n't lock your room and dwell on a mental abyss punishing yourself : you 'd be amazed at how short is some people 's memory for recalling events , and how little they care about things . 
  ** do n't mind-read and do n't catastrophize .

   this place was run by the same people who ran a facility in mexico named `` casa by the sea '' , which was shut down by the mexican government for child abuse & neglect . 
  holy shit !, 
  i 'm mexican and i still remember the ads for that shit , it looked like a legit cool place to be in ( i was 7 or 8 at the time ) . 
  are n't you talking about [ oce\u00e1nica ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxs1-4oobyg ) ? 
  dude ... 
  your original comment was 4 hours ago , and you lost her 9 minutes ago ? 
  introversion or extraversion is not wether you 're `` social '' or not . 
  it means your main cognitive function is extraverted . 
  entps have ne as their dominant while intps have ti as their dominant . 
  perhaps you tend to use ne ( or other functions ) more when you 're around people , but in the end , the rest of your functional stack is still there ( si , fe ) . 
  also , as you develop further your 4th function can seem less problematic than , say , a shadow function -- se is the bane of my existence -- or the 3rd function . 
  that does n't mean you changed or mistyped . 
  lol keep it up , man . 
  i wonder how it 's like to have an analyst girlfriend . 
  so far , i 've only had feelers ( and they 're * awesome * ) , but i still wonder what it 's like . . 
  i do n't have enough information to judge if she 's intp or not . 
  but i do have suffient information to judge if she 's beautiful or not . 
  this is -- in my opinion -- our greatest strenght : the ability to detach ourserlves and not let be overcome by emotion . 
  but you have to understand that , for some people doing this is extremely difficult because their `` nature '' simply is n't oriented like this . 
  feelers have their own advantages in comparison to us , but they also have their challenges . 
  a common problem for this sub 's users is severe procrastination ( i 'm one of them ) . 
  yes , i am aware how awesome -- and necessary -- judging is , but that does n't mean i wo n't struggle when trying to stop my mad prospecting . 
  in the same light , it 's easy for me to empathize with the problems of introverts living in a place that culturally favor extraversion and so on . 
  that is one use of small talk , but the bigger picture is that it lets us bind emotionally ( for an extremely short time , if necessary ) with other people . 
  think about body language like the non-verbal approach to small talk : have you ever asked `` how 's it going '' to a passerby neighbor you know and trust ? 
  it does n't make any logical sense to do so . 
  you already know that person , so there 's not a need to establish a trust bond , as it has been already established . 
  but it * feels * wrong to simply ignore them . 
  i actually do n't know why that happens but there must be a reason for it . 
  in the same way , contact with people * always * provokes emotion of some kind and magnitude , and naturally , people like feeling good . 
  maybe small talk is hard-wired as some early defense mechanism from harsher times ( or not ) , but the point still remains , even from a technological standpoint : it 's better to get good at it . 
  dating sites ... 
  i love the cognitive dissonance that dating sites provoke in me : i know it has a lot of major benefits and advantages over the `` traditional '' kind of dating but i 'm still reluctant to accept change ... 
  my feelers have never been extreme ; there has * never * been any shouting in my relationships . 
  but boy , it breaks my heart to see girls i love crying when discussing the `` meta '' in our relationships . 
  i just feel miserable , but actually they have told me to not feel bad , as crying is healthy and natural for them . 
  because it has [ low repeatability and does n't correlate with other -- arguably more trusted -- instruments ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/myers%e2%80%93briggs_type_indicator#criticism ) . 
  to be fair , if mbti was pefectly true , we would be talking about the periodic table of people ; and that would be mindblowing . 
  i went to vancouver once . 
  man , it 's an awesome place . 
  but i got the feeling that instead of a chinese neighborhood , there is a * canadian * neighborhood and the rest is asian !, 
  instead of a packed , techonological city , my ideal is kind of the opposite :, 
  * if it is populated , it should n't be `` packed '' , there should be room for people . 
  * it should be monumental/glorious . 
  * it should be a city known for its output of art , science , crafts , economic bloom and military power : a place i can feel proud to belong . 
  * its people should be kind , generous and have a sense of pride but not so much it becomes insufferable . 
  also , its citizens should be encouraging to take action to improve and open to criticize tradition if it 's a change for the better . 
  they should have a communal growth mentality but not like in the ussr or venezuelan brand of communism/socialism . 
  more like the scandinavian thing . 
  * bonus points if it 's set on a beautiful landscape .

  people said yankbot disappointed yesterday . 
  i think this fine quote compensates for it with surplus . 
  at least the ammo has the lowest priority . 
  in which context is the word `` soap '' used ? 
  do americans believe cleanliness is a path to liberty ? 
  recuerda irlanda , [ recuerda ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jw8g-ompig ) . 
  i 'm a straight guy and i think that picture is hot af . 
  by using a sword that looks suspiciously british ( or hyrulean ) . 
  sometimes , when we are not exposed to a certain group of people it 's easier to believe in stereotypes and lies . 
  i have been exposed to american people at the annual balloon festival at le\u00f3n , guanajuato . 
  although it 's an international festival , people from all over the world attend it and in my experience americans shine for being some of the kindest , coolest , most generous folks i have ever met . 
  reddit appears to be a platform dominated by white americans and europeans who have their own challenges and backgrounds . 
  i do not condone racism , but i understand why so many americans are voting for a person like donald trump . 
  it 's important to take into account that anonymity somehow provides hateful people a venue to express their rethoric , so certain subreddits could be taken as a sample of the * worst * that the us has to offer . 
  but then again , always remembering that only some of them behave that way and it would be unfair to generalize the whole country . 
  [ turn down the lights , babe . 
  i know your body is ready ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtxgl0xpyla ), 
  oh , i did n't know a soapbox was like a speech corner . 
  but now i do , thanks !, 
  mexican here : once i went to canada and i went to a taco stand in a mall -- edomonton , i believe -- because i was curious about what to other people think a taco is . 
  it was horrible , but i did it for the shits and giggles , so i do n't regret it :p, 
  this guy has n't been to a raiders game , has n't he ? 
  where 's the original ? 
  god , i love self posts . 
   karliene ( scottish born ) is acquiring an aussie accent . 
  really ? 
  the focus was the lyrics , actually . 
  although i 'm well aware that this was a civil war song and the events i 'm referencing ( saint patrick 's battallion 's role in the mexican-american war ) happened decades before . 
  wonderful body . 
  i 'm not such a fan of the blue thong front but damn you make the back look good . 
  i do n't know !, 
  i 'd have to visit europe and try the mexican food they have to offer to compare . 
  but if i went to europe , you can be sure i would n't have mexican food if i can try the local . 
  how dares that person to be unfunny with death ? 
  being actually funny in the exact same situation is acceptable though , just do n't mess with my feels !, 
  the `` 48 laws of power '' book , perhaps ? 
  i think it 's obvious that he was n't trying to be deliver a low blow ; it was just a failed intent of comedy . 
  it baffles me how inconsistent people can be with feelings : some things should be killed with fire if they fail to provoke a good feeling where the exact same thing that does manage to provoke a good feeling is not questioned and celebrated . 
  they also have written an article `` exposing '' [ reddit 's favorite person ] ( http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/06/09/failed-discrimination-complainant-ellen-pao-write-book-silicon-valleys-toxicity/ ) in a completely neutral and totally not biased light !, 
  president and ~ ~ vicepresident ~ ~ chairman united for victory !, 
  and then proceded to void the core source of freedom : the second amendment .
