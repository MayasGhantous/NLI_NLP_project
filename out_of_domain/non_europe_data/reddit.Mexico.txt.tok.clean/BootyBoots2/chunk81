  i 'm surprised the site actually lets you pick a homosexual pairing instead of automatically switching to the opposite gender . 
  does he have to wait for it or can the russian buttfuck her while she 's blowing him ? 
  did n't he want to undo the ruling that allows gay marriage ? 
  i mean , he 's not as staunch as cruz was , but still . 
  has his voting base ( tea party style conservatives ) forgot about the whole gay marriage issue for good just to have a talking point against liberals ? 
  damn , this would be an illuminati type of achievement if that was the case . 
  classier than miley 's version , to be honest . 
  i was n't joking , it was an honest proposal . 
   how does that make any sense ? 
  it does n't . 
  your point is perfectly logical , but that 's the catch of it : we find couples and start relationships with people who are compatible with our feelings and system of values ; both of which are faintly attached to -- if not completely detached from -- logic . 
  question : can transgender women get a `` vaginal cavity drilling '' surgery so they can be vaginally penetrated ? 
  as far as i know , the penis skin is used after the castration to simulate the vulva , so a cisgender man can notice `` something 's wrong '' when he wo n't be able to penetrate the woman . 
  i do n't know , 20 . 
  i do n't know . 
  i disagree on the sexuality part . 
  i 'm very sexual but i fit well within the intp stereotype . 
  i would n't take individual signs -- or `` vibes '' -- to judge if someone belongs to a type or not , as they can be misleading and hard to interpret . 
  for me , the strength of the mbti is the ability to produce the general descriptions of the 16 types -- stereotypes -- that sort of predict how people 's might act based on how developed their cognitive functions are . 
  so i would look for mbti stereotypes upon guessing a person 's type to get a general picture of why the person is * more prone * to manage their perceptions and take decisions , but in order to do so i would try to get a measure of their dominant and auxiliary functions as opposed to looking for dichotomies ( like in `` sensing is opposed to thinking '' ) . 
  notice that this dynamic is extremely loose ; guessing someone 's type is as sketchy an unreliable as mbti test itself . 
  so back to the matter at hand : ** how to know if someone is not an intp ? 
  ** the necessary and sufficient conditions for that the person not being intp are :, 
  * their dominant function is extraverted . 
  [ not i ], 
  * their perceiving function is a sensing one instead of an intuiting ( the orientation does n't matter ) . 
  [ not n ], 
  * their judging function is a feeling one instead of a thinking one ( orientation does n't matter ) . 
  [ not t ], 
  * the perceiving function is the dominant one . 
  [ not p ], 
  if one or more of the conditions above are met , the person ca n't be an intp . 
  usually knowing which are the dominant and auxiliary functions is enough ( as the third and fourth functions are necessarily the dichotomous inverse of the auxiliary and dominant functions respectively ) to judge it . 
  but we have to remember that bombing the families of terrorists is the sane thing to do !, 
  yes , you parsed my comment correctly . 
  i thought trans women could n't be penetrated after vaginoplasty , but had a vulva that looked like a born woman . 
  6 inches , that 's a good range . 
  most men should be able to penetrate trans women after vaginoplasty ( by the way , i would call them simply `` women '' , disposing of the `` trans '' pronoun after that surgery ) . 
  you have an awesome username !, 
  ok i believe you . 
  but still , i 'd still call them simply `` women '' after vaginoplasty because :, 
  * it 's simpler ( i think reaching [ this point ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/smj0w-h3mcxalflugahwvk9t_gvyrh6wb8lmkjyuyrs.jpg?s=2995ca98e48d70276a7427a0cbcef020 ) is absurd , to be honest ) . 
  * if the woman does n't look like she was a man before it 's better that the lesser amount of people know about it ( of course , the right thing to do would be to disclose that to a person whom she wants to have sex/start a relationship ) because she 's safer , and also less socially divisive . 
  for example ; i do n't like the word `` mansplaining '' as the word `` condescending '' conveys the exact same behavior , but it just adds an unnecessary tone of women victimization that makes reactionary anti-feminists ' blood boil , making it harder for civilized conversations to happen . 
  yeah , but i do n't like using cues to make decisions like these . 
  i think they 're extremely unreliable . 
  it does n't have anything to do with mbti but judging on stereotypes is one of the worst things to do ( as they can be used to justify hate ) , and some people rely on them way too much . 
  i posted that in order to know if someone is not intp , they would have to know the person 's dominant and auxiliary functions . 
  i like the arrested development kind of `` awkward '' humor . 
  so ... will you embark on an epic quest along nine companions to prevent your idyllic , peaceful homeland to be invaded by irrational and wretched haters ? 
  i will help you bear this burden , u/whyarentihigh ; so long it is yours to bear . 
  when i was -- more -- immature , i view everything from a functional standpoint : so i 'd put a prime on clothes that worked ( i would n't care about wearing a giant , yellow jacket than made me look puffed like a bear if that meant being warm on a very cold day ) , rather than on things that made me look good . 
  for this reason i actively despised accessories , as they 're only cosmetic attachments that served no purpose . 
  and of course , i had the classic underdeveloped intp sense of superiority of `` let the primitive animals care about attraction , i 'll stick to what 's logical '' . 
  but then i realized that people -- including me ! -- judge others even if minimal on the basis of appearance , and that it does n't matter how you look , you will provoke an emotion on people ; no way to avoid it . 
  so then ... why not taking advantage and maximizing people 's positive perceptions about me ? 
  to be fair , i 'm not one of those types of people that wo n't go out unless they 're completely groomed ( and to this day i still commit fashion crimes unapologetically ) , but at least i 'm much more open to make a conscious effort to care more about my image than i did before . 
  damn , that guy is on a sticky situation ... 
  this is prime quality music for getting high .

  [ pets white cat ], 
  there are controversial and emotional subjects and people react accordingly when discussing them . 
  when communication is very vitiated , there 's not a channel of communication anymore because everyone treats the members of the group with opposing ideology like they 're always attacking them . 
  i ca n't blame them because it 's a primitive survival mechanism , and one does not simply shrug primitive survival mechanisms off , but that 's the cause behind racism and every `` us vs them '' kind of conflict where there is prejudice and hatred . 
  it becomes worse when people have the notion that it is ok to attack or hate the group that defends the opposing ideology ; as their group `` is the one that stands with righteousness and truth '' . 
  as a final note , if we try to look for cues to determine if these people are worth discussing with instead of indiscriminately trying to breach through people 's stubbornness in an attempt to save us time and energy ; then how are we different from these irrational people ? 
  perhaps you do have connections already , but you ca n't see them because you 're feeling a little down at the moment . 
  every human being is unique and adds something to the group . 
  check this out : if someone invites you anywhere , this implicitly means that they want your presence and contributions in their group , and they perceive that the experience they want to live will be richer with your companionship . 
  people are like youtube channels : it does n't matter how weird is the content you upload ; people will still watch what you offer . 
  and of course , there are much more popular channels/people than you ; but that means your audience ( friends and meaningful connections ) is out there , somewhere . 
  you just have to find them , or let them find you . 
  keep it up !,

  first of all , there might be a chance you mistyped . 
  mbti is far from perfect . 
  second , if my knowledge of functions is to be trusted feeling means you make judgments according to you the emotional prime you put in the topics that matter to you . 
  emotions are not feeling but the feeling functions do trigger a range of different emotions . 
  infps are fi users . 
  that means they have to make their environment match the ideals they believe in . 
  a possible match therefore , is the american 1.95 m tall , 150 kg , redheaded , bearded lumberjack who thinks ( actually feels in terms of cognitive functions ) he needs guns to eventually fight off a tyrannical government is an example of a possible infp that is anything but cuddly . 
  any news about gun control will trigger his ire , news about further protection of his rights will trigger a sense of relief , his friends in the range will make him feel safe and connected in an environment of similar people . 
  all of this without the rainbows ... 
  boobs are huge , which is cool and all but . . 
  damn , those legs !!!!, 
  ** edit : ** she 's hot but , she also seems rad judging from the pictures in the album . 
  an interesting girl , i wonder how she 's like irl . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : beautiful people can hardly feel thirst for sex when there are always people throwing themselves to them , lonely people can hardly realize how suffocating is to be requested for sex nonstop . 
  it 's easy to empathize with both sides of the coin :, 
  on one side , you 've got frustrated , lonely people who crave the slightest bit of attention whatsoever ; but since they are `` creepy '' ( read : unattractive * ) people naturally avoids them -- which is also a safety mechanism that is perfectly understandable -- making their depression and hence creepiness descend into a downward spiral . 
  somewhere along the way hatred chimes in and when you least expect it , you can have an elliot rodger on the loose . 
  some people feel they need sex because that will make them experience human connection . 
  an incorrect premise but alas , who can blame them if they have n't experienced it and apparently society loves rubbing that to their faces ? 
  on the other side you have people who are extremely beautiful , which gives them a powerful edge ; moreover there 's people within that group that really learned how to harness and further maximize that power and benefits . 
  which is ok if they choose to , but what about the people who do n't care about it ? 
  what if you do n't want to base your identity upon your physical beauty ?
