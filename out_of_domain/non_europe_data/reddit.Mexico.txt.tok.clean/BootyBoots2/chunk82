  sex is a great experience , but it can become awful when violence is implied ; something that beautiful people ( but especially girls ) are subjected to . 
  for the ones who are not blessed with divine beauty it 's hard to perceive how these people are exposed to objectification and prejudice . 
  it 's hard to imagine how much they have to struggle to find a person who actually loves them for their personalities , rather than their bodies . 
  sure it sounds awesome to live in a golden cage ; but that does n't make it less of a cage in the end of the day . 
  and neither part wants to acknowledge the each other 's problems ; which is ironic when you think about it : both types of people crave for deep human connections , but none of them can get them because of how superficial other people ( including themselves sometimes ) can be . 
  \\* attractive people can also act creepy , but people are way more condescending about it than they would be about the exact same action or series of actions performed by a much less graced individual . 
  see the [ creepiness equation ] ( https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ihzwjkcj--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/rkh64vcxfddf66boy9i9.jpg ) . 
  no , it is not copypasta . 
  and no , i did n't say it 's the only fate for them , but i 'm implying that is definitely a possibility when taken to extreme circumstances . 
  ** edit : ** to be fair , my language was pretty direct , i corrected it to leave more room for uncertainty . 
  never did i say that was the worst possibility for both sides ; that 's a conclusion you 're taking by misinterpreting my words . 
  i attempted to illustrate problems that one side * can * face , but the other side can find it difficult to acknowledge ; but by no means the situations that pop in my head are the only or the worst problems they face . 
  why is it so ? 
  ( if your reply is long , please feel free to pm me so we do n't disturb the peace in this buttery shrine ), 
  true !, 
  but if you 're socially awkward and ca n't really figure your way out with society you may end up being lonely and desperate ; you do n't have to be deformed for that to happen . 
  my perception is that people as a whole tolerate social blunders much more if they have a blessed physique . 
   that is probably true , but being sufficently socially skilled and attractive to get laid is not that hard . 
  believe me , it can be . 
   if they really think that having sex is so important , then they should work to improve their physiques and social skills instead of whining . 
  curiously , one of the reasons they get put off as creepy is because they can come off as `` tryhard '' . 
  trying everything that made logical sense ( with whatever you can find on books or the internet and lacking the social skills -- which is what matters -- ) and failing time and time again is crippling . 
   sure some of those people may have some kind of mental illness , but most are just lazy entitled whiners . 
  that 's a harsh statement ; while some of them are classier than others handling this problem -- even if they are not mentally ill -- brushing people off as `` lazy entitled whiners '' at best polarizes groups , fueling hatred . 
  you do n't know what they have been trough . 
  i think it 's a sensible move to not disrespect if you do not agree . 
  i get what you say , and i agree completely . 
  it 's just that the way i arranged my words led you to think that , sorry . 
  i meant we should not * avoid * or brush off people based on cues like `` he 's a trump supporter , so there 's no use discussing gun control with him '' , instead of `` breaching '' like trying to force your opinions on others ; we should never attempt to do that . 
  my bad . 
  having `` common sense '' can be quite the challenge for some people though , but it 's definitely attainable if people want to put effort on it . 
  i but agree with this statement in general . 
  i would still advice you not to disrespect immature people unless the situation really warrants it ( in other words , i advocate for respect , not sympathy ) ; they need to live experiences to crawl out of the hole . 
  admins ... 
  what r u doing, 
  admins !, 
  staph !, 
  do n't tie that rope around your neck !, 
  incurring in actual , true censorship ( not what the_donald panders about ) will only make radicalize people to flock to the sub ; as they -- for once -- will be telling the undeniable truth about an emotional subject . 
  more than the inevitable gun control debate that will be discussed because of this tragedy , there is already drama because of reddit 's censorship ( actual censorship -- it seems -- not what r/european preached as `` censorship '' ) . 
  i agree with the mod 's decision on this . 
  people will go haywire for presumably more than two days . 
  curiously , i also posted [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0yudfcohva#t=11m19s ) earlier , but in your case it fits perfectly lol . 
  back to the subject of speaking to people who do n't like their views challenged ; i 'm glad you 're open to debate these people ( even though you * feel * -- sometimes accurately -- it wo n't lead anyway ) , disregarding dangerous stereotyping . 
  if all people were like you , perhaps the world would be different . 
  but let 's be honest : the enjoyment of a cold , unemotional conversation with a person who has solid arguments opposing your view in a controversial subject is a rare treat that tastes better because it 's rare . 
  ughh ... 
  but this is what we came for ... here 's the shitshow . 
  gun control and mental illness is not so prominent if a brown guy does it . 
  the conversations tend to be more about `` allowing '' , `` religion '' , `` refugees '' and `` terrorism '' . 
  it is too soon to cast a veredict on r/news actions ( i am guilty , i 've already jumped to the conclusion that they did censor ; not being able to weigh on the little information available ) ; but the situation is so tense that the_donald capitalized on it . 
  and boy , they did take advantage of the situation to the full extent . 
  i ca n't blame r/news for not having a contingency plan for this shit but it definitely backfired not having a plan ( the unreddit undeleted megathread is still loading after 45 minutes , and i ca n't see what they deleted ) . 
  you know , what it really troubles me is how the_donald is * happy * about this . 
  they needed this desperately , it 's like a blessing to them , and it 's disgusting ; but their userbase is so bigoted they really ca n't see that they 're sensationalizing the headlines with utter disrespect for the victims to push their political agendas . 
  i did n't think they could fall so low . 
  ** edit : ** i do n't know what to think anymore . 
  maybe i should not confront these people for a while as a sign of respect for the victims , so that it does n't come off as me pushing an agenda of my own like they do . 
   besides , aderholt said , `` the vast majority of those who are legitimately on the list and pose a legitimate threat '' are not american citizens or lawful permanent residents . 
  that means they ca n't legally buy guns now . 
  the man who shot the pulse gay bar was american born . 
  hence american citizen * and * lawful permanent resident . 
  i though i read he acquired the murder weapon legally . 
  can anyone confirm ? 
  knowledge is power ; but only when it is used . 
  thanks for telling me this . 
  i deleted my comment because the only stage where this knowledge could have been used is at prevention , not law enforcement . 
  law must be enforced * after * the crime has been committed , not prior . 
  that 's why aderholt 's statement is so wrong ; people being put on hold for their guns is not nearly comparable to the lives that could have been saved if omar had not have access to guns . 
  this is not serious , but i make a toy replica to mock gun nuts , i 'm going to baptize it as the bmcm9k lol . 
  thanks for painting a smile on my face , among all these grief . 
  damn , i 'd have this girl over megan fox anytime ... 
  first of all , nonsensical violence , no matter the context , is inadmissible . 
  much less for a country that purports itself to be a beacon of progress . 
  if you 're saying this because of the killings in orlando , then your post does n't even make sense from a vengeance perspective : omar was a born american , with the citizenship and the full permanent residence his birthright entailed . 
  fighting hatred with more hatred is like fighting fire with fire . 
  we all burn needlessly . 
  from spain ? 
  i wonder how long will it take for islamophobia to creep into mexico . 
  i hope it 's a mighty long time ( or better yet : never ) . 
  there 's an important thing we have to bear in mind : this man , omar , though within his own conception of the world that he was doing the right thing : he gloriously helped all-powerful allah to get rid of sinners like you and hence `` make the world pure again '' ( you should know where i 'm going at by now ) . 
  and , within the very specific frame of his own backwards thinking it sounds ... noble [ do n't lift up the pitchforks yet , this is part of the argument , just keep on reading ] . 
  this event was massive because of the amount of groups implicated on this massacre . 
  it was targeted towards homosexuals , perpetrated by a muslim ( the only thing that could have been worse was him being an undocumented person ) and apparently bought his guns legally , but nobody has yet focused on the issue of mental health and there is only one word in r/all 's mind : ** muslim ** . 
  i was one of the people who thought that donald trump could n't have been a serious candidate , but i underestimated the discomfort , the ignorance and the bigotry of the american populace . 
  earlier this morning there was a massive event of alleged censorship in r/news and the_donald capitalized on it . 
  take a look at it and it 's * flooded * with the_donald 's bigotry ; most of the posts do n't ever cover the events in florida , but they do cover one thing : islamophobia and people look like they are biting the bait pretty damn hard . 
  the tinderbox was set , and this `` spark '' was more than enough to trigger it . 
  could reddit be a trustworthy barometer of the us social tension climate ? 
  people are going to be pissed by this . 
  bad . 
  emotions are on the wild right now and the hatred will be focused on one group ( muslims in general ) , rather than on one individual ( omar and da'esh ) . 
  it 's likely that soon , people will overlook or even encourage radical hate speech towards muslims ( like if people cheering to trump saying that he would slay the families of -- alleged -- terrorists if elected president is n't months before this was n't enough proof of this lunacy ) and committing violence upon them will seem ... noble . 
  because , when have perfect angels hating and slaying evil demons been a bad thing ? 
  ** edit : ** anyway , this is just a massive conjecture i just made . 
  predicting social movements is difficult if not impossible . 
  i hope nobody gets hurt from this point on . 
  i sincerely hope you and all of your loved ones are ok . 
  muslims , communists , nazis , gypsies , jews , americans , protestants , catholics , shias , sunnis , frenchmen , germans , brits , spaniards , dutchmen ... god . 
  it 's impossible to list all of the groups of people that are or were considered a threat to the stability of the world and therefore it was ok to hate them and kill them on sight .
