  naturally , the members of these groups retaliated ( maybe the roma did n't , or did they ? ), 
  with the same hatred , and when violence erupted hatred exploded in a spiral of nonsensical violence that typically ended with the lives of hundreds of thousands or millions of people . 
  hope my conjecture never becomes real !, 
  the ironic thing was that when i was spell-checking my comment i found you called for the extermination of muslims . 
  that is a very well worded ad-hominem , [ i 'll give you that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkbylrvx8gy#t=0m35s ) . 
  sorry for misquoting you . 
  i am not qualified to make accurate predictions about the behavior of large groups of people , but i do know that when group a is atrocious to group b , it 's easy for group b to commit the exact same atrocities it was bound to prevent by fighting group a in the first place . 
  the soviet war memorial ( culminating the most violent conflict in human history so far ) is called `` the tomb of the unknown rapist '' by some germans . 
  the history of the partition of india is a sterling example of what happens when two groups hate and abuse of each other , looking for their members rather than the perpetrators of crime . 
  like those two there are countless examples than can be traced from the dawn of humankind itself . 
  so no , the solution is not to kill them all , as we do n't even know who , how many or where they are . 
  we can not afford to damage innocent people . 
  if they are to be punished , they must be trialed when captured . 
  if you think an islamist is a person who is sought to enforce the literal interpretation of the qu ` ran and the sharia law , then agree with each other , i just did n't made myself clear in the last comment . 
   a good guy can remain the good guy even if the good guy must kill to protect their higher moral standing . 
  the itty bitty problem with that line of thinking is that both sides feel exactly the same , thus they rationalize their violence because they hold the higher moral standing in their minds . 
  the higher the horse , the greater the fall .

  who is the good guy ? 
  he also said that innocent americans brought the attack on themselves for electing their leaders . 
  which makes me ask : was little timmy responsible for the actions of raegan ? 
  he was a fucked up man , with very backwards thinking but a deliciously good rhetoric ; his poetic words can easily lead you to think that the terrorists are the good guys , it 's just that the need to do what needest ' to be done in order to bring the righteous peace & freedom to the land . 
  just like [ w ] ( http://a5.files.thedailybanter.com/image/upload/mtm2njq1mjuxmza1nzc2nzm3 ) . 
  not my kind of comedy , but then again ; what does this collection of fallacies about multiculturalism have to do with the tribal mentality of good vs. evil where you choose to believe you 're on the light side ? 
  [ here 's an interesting excerpt ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/4noaau/im_being_charged_for_911/d45x8i8 ) showcasing some quotes by osama bin laden , an awful man who wielded words like a scimitar . 
  the worst thing is that he does have a point ; the free world ( basically the us and others when they are forced by treaties or they find it convenient ) attacked nations and overthrew democratically elected governments , it did n't -- and still does n't -- shy away from murdering civilians in warzones or bombing hospitals . 
  it has belittled the misbehavior of their armed forces even when they incur in crimes against humanity , defended torture when it has been proven ineffective as intelligence gathering and who knows what else . 
  certainly not the proudest actions concerning moral superiority , but at least they get the job done , or do they ? 
  the islamists thought the same thing : it was impossible to make the us stop trough conventional warfare , so maybe attacking the civilian population ( like the us did on coalition with israel according to bin laden ) [ would make americans demand their leaders to stop the massacre ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhofcobxi80#t=0m7s ) . 
  they had the moral upper hand if you think about it , the us did first blood . 
  who brings justice for the crimes of the most powerful nations ? 
  unicef ? 
  there is no point in perpetuating violence because of standing on a moral high horse . 
  i understand that ultimately , countries have to look after the security of their citizens and the end justifies the means ; and that 's not ok , but that 's what countries do . 
  just do n't claim the west is morally superior ; it just has fancier bombs and we are comfortable living on it .

   i 'll read your memoir entitled `` i screwed the pooch : how to land in prison by badmouthing a dog . '', 
  it 'll be a nice write-up , i promise . 
  i can send you the book and some pictures of the beautiful locale of m\u1ef9 lai and the thriving city of hiroshima from my travels in the region and in exchange you can send me a biography of joseph mccarthy . 
  i 'm starting a collection on the liberators of america and i heard the man did much to keep america free by fending off communism . 
  that is mildly infuriating , indeed . 
  at least you 're honest about it . 
  first of all , thanks for your effort . 
  it 's valuable to me to receive replies of this kind . 
  my point was that i think we can agree that nobody saw this -- donald trump being the presumptive republican nominee -- coming and frankly , there was no way to formally deduce it by using logic and evidence available ( or did we ? ) . 
  it was like trying to deduce the social events that led up to the creation of the da'esh by taking a look at the societies of the middle east . 
  the social bomb was there , right in front of us and ready to explode ; but we could n't see it . 
  i mean , just think about it : he was the joke character to the race but people elected him into where he is now and he is a serious contender for the presidency . 
  and he did n't get there by merit alone : behind him there is a voter base that has all of the classical prejudices of the republican voter base plus the widespread distrust of career politicians ( especially clinton ) . 
  trump is just all of that , personified and caricaturized . 
  how can we know if we objectively are n't underestimating ( or overestimating ) the reach of trump supporters ? 
   i am largely worried for what trump will say in tomorrow 's speech . 
  if we 're having trouble in this sub deciding what the difference between an `` islamist '' and a `` muslim '' and a `` radical muslim '' is without getting snooty at one another , how are the masses or / r/all going to ever make any kind of distinction like that ? 
  lol this sub is not very level headed for so to speak ( even though we love to circlejerk about it ) . 
  if you talk about topics life feminism or the second amendment , sparks fly . 
  liberty of expression , right folks ? 
  it sounds stupid at first glance ( and it is concerning prevention of mass shootings ) , but i think the development of effective non-lethal technology for home defense can be a major way to bring down the argument `` i need them to protect my home '' , which is a major talking point for 2a supporters . 
  the heroic defense from the tyrannical government and self-defense in the streets still remain but alas , it can be helpful in the long run . 
  that 's clearly an * african * thing . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk9o-lgh7ve ), 
   those types of people do n't want a weapon that only injures . 
  my idea is to create defense systems that do not injure the trespasser , it is to stun them for enough time so the police arrives and takes care of the situation . 
  so ... these people want an excuse to kill ? 
  i think it is used in the `` not all muslims are terrorists but all terrorists are muslim [ so since any of them could be a potential terrorist and since we do n't know who could they be , it 's ok to fear , discriminate and even harm people from that group ] '' . 
  ** the west is not intrinsecally `` morally superior '' by any account **, 
  true , islamic countries have n't `` caught up '' with `` the free world '' yet because 30 years ago or so , we decided it was time for women , homosexuals and transexuals to have a place in this world ( and even today , hate towards women , homosexuals and transexuals is alive and well , it 's just that they do n't get openly executed ; much less with purposefully shocking methods such as behading ) . 
  but , can you blame them ? 
  70 years ago you could n't have hoped for women to be engineers or mechanics ; much less a ceo . 
  homosexuals would get murdered by mobs for being `` faggots '' and transexuals did n't even exist , to my knowledge . 
  even the mighty moral authority known as `` the west '' was atrocious to itself by modern standards . 
  these people evolved with a different culture , a culture that was disrupted after the greed of the military powers of the west , precisely . 
  so now an extremely regressive movement has appeared in the middle east and western nations , who played an important part in this mess and are to blame , accuse islam as a whole ( and at it 's core ! ), 
  for the tragedies that are in a large part provoked by the west itself , most ironically ( i 'm not blaming the victims , just pointing that out ) . 
  ** what do we do now ? 
  true , this discussion has to be had ; there * is * a branch of radical islam that threatens us all , but it has to be done * without * islamophobia -- i do n't know if you agree with my definition -- and in the wake of recent events , i highly doubt that a serious , cold , unemotional discussion about this and the means to prevent it will take place . 
  put it this way : when the berlin wall was built , some people crossed over to west germany . 
  as time went by , the wall was further fortified and people * still * crossed over , albeit less frequently . 
  if a wall is built around mexico ( this coming from a mexican ) , my people will * still * cross over to the us ; albeit in much , * much * reduced numbers . 
  they might be so reduced that authorities should be able to catch them and deport them back here easily . 
  same thing holds true for guns : the more these guns are restricted the riskier and harder is to get your hands on one of them , and the easier and more effectively will authorities keep track of terrorists . 
  the fact that he could n't have gotten his hands on a state of the art machine designed to have a very good rate of fire ( as opposed to shotguns or pistols with low capacity that need precious seconds of reloading and a very reduced capacity ) means people might have physically overpowered omar , instead of him spraying death all over the place . 
  now , one might think that it 's not desirable that the government is informed of who has which guns ( and even worse : law abiding citizens being deprived of their proper warfare tools like ~ ~ tanks and espionage satellites ~ ~ m16 rifles ) ; as that would be disastrous for the pure-hearted , law abiding people in the americalypse ( the impending doom of a government takeover ) . 
  if you share this opinion , then i guess rooms packed with schoolchildren and homosexuals are necessary losses . 
  this is ** not ** shopped ? 
  gawd . 
  i have to thank mbti for introducing me to the concept of cognitive functions . 
  knowing what fe was and trying to actively develop it helped me pluck myself out of a dark hole . 
  i was trying to change , but in an erroneous way : trying to force my ti to replace fe with a `` manual for living '' . 
  this , of course motivated by lack of contact with women . 
  in other aspects of my life like conforming to social rules i was like `` fuck them '' .
