  lol great idea !, 
  but first : how does one make ridiculously big headers like in r/the _ donald ? 
  i want the last \u0423\u0420\u0410 !, 
  to be very loud , as it expresses its passionate love and desire to labor for the motherland . 
  hey u/spez ; take a look at [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/4nyf2v/admins_using_the_orlando_massacre_to_change_the/d4809up ) , man . 
  mexican here . 
  stegosauruses did n't live in mexico ... 
  but there were lambeosaurus !, 
  r/fullcommunism will love it lol . 
  yeah ... 
  i know the feeling , man . 
  #who are you ? 
  what makes you special ? 
  i used to be really shy . 
  i do n't know if you 're shy ( it seems so , but it 's just a conjecture ) but boy , i remember when i was . 
  i would feel * physical * reactions simply by coinciding with people i knew in a public setting like a mall . 
  and it sucks . 
  i * hated * dancing with a burning passion . 
  once my parents were off to somewhere and i was listening to music ; i had the house all to myself and i thought : `` hhmmm that 's weird . 
  i understand that i wo n't sing and dance in public so i do n't embarras myself but i 'm alone now . 
  why ca n't i dare to do it if i am * alone * with no public to * judge * me ? '', 
  so i said : `` fuck it '' and played started to mimic and * mock * music i liked . 
  i started dancing as [ mocking choreographies that i found to be silly/exaggerated ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gujqsaiodqi ) and i found it was a really fun thing to do . 
  there was a radio show that called `` el gallito ingl\u00e9s '' that has really good comedy , and they just love poking fun at [ los temerarios ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymrffr1qkvw ) . 
  at the time , lightheartedly commenting how corny their music was made me tie bonds closer to my mom , because we listened to that show on the way to school at the mornings and we laughed together at the broadcaster 's jokes and she laughed at mine 's . 
  mocking helped me find my own brand of sense of humor and to `` step aside '' from my serious self : it 's not you who could be judged , it 's `` your inner dr. 
  evil '' or `` your inner gay man '' or `` your inner commando '' or whatever ; it 's just roleplay and make believe . 
  but now i do n't need multiple personas . 
  i know that 's a unique part of me and an interesting feature that i can bring to the table and people enjoy : that 's the way i am . 
  and i recognize that there are people who * hate * me . 
  screw them . 
  people love me for the things others hate ; i limit myself to be decent . 
  this is my story . 
  the point of this is that i found a stepping stone and now i am more open to people . 
  it has sure paid off and it 's been worth it . 
  it wo n't happen overnight , i 'll warn you ; but it pays off to face your fears and do n't fear judgement : dare to be [ totally stupid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p7redbwsyi#t=2m20s ) [ careful with the volume ; also , take a look at the lyrics from that point on and reflect on them ] at times when you * need to be * . 
  #social conventions, 
  man , i hated those with burning passion as well . 
  people expect you to do or refrain to do things based on * unwritten * conventions . 
  fuck that . 
  they 'll chastise you hard for not following them and they never question if they 're functional or outdated at all . 
  the worst thing is that there is not a freaking manual to at least consult to know what to do in these situations . 
  but you can figure it out with patience . 
  the thing with us intps is that we are way too oblivious and much hardened in comparison to other people . 
  perhaps if somebody just comes in and says `` hi !, 
  i 'm laura , nice to meet you . 
  hey , what 's your stance on abortion ? '', 
  you 'll say in your mind : `` hell yeah , juicy argument time , thank god !, 
  '' , but anyone else will be utterly repulsed by laura because they 're putting their beliefs -- a very , very important and personal thing -- on the line to some person who has not even gained their trust . 
  social conventions are not just there as ornaments . 
  they do serve a purpose and even though they are not logically consistent ( they 're established to give fe a cultural platform ) at times , they keep you safe within that environment . 
  take the recent orlando massacre into account . 
  why is it bad taste to make a joke about it ? 
  because people would interpret it as like you enjoy poking fun at a tragedy that entails inconceivable injustice and suffering . 
  this is inconsistent because you * can * make people laugh and joke after tragedies happened [ but only if you 're a masterful comedian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kogzgwvbsms ) . 
  not everybody has that power and [ sometimes is better not to try at all ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys8cm3kmyws ) . 
  has somebody ever overreached your boundaries and gotten too close to you ? 
  this is an example of `` social boundaries '' that i consider great for us intps because space is important to us . 
  well , that 's a social convention right there : there 's no rulebook stating how close is too close , yet the boundary is still there and you will let some people touch you can get close . 
  same holds true for * every * single aspect of human interaction . 
  i 'll spare you the details : ** do n't bother trying to create a comprehensive manual to sort out every situation ** ; it wo n't work . 
  instead expose yourself to more social situations ; interact more with people , try to empathize with them ( what would i feel if ? ) . 
  that will develop fe to an acceptable level . 
  i hope this helps . 
  yes , she 's muriel from argenteens . 
  you da real mvp . 
  ok , let me fix it . 
  i remember the masterful , deep strategy used by the seahawks when they finally won :, 
  they played a tight and aggressive defense . 
  that was it . 
  the 9/11 hijackers hijacked the plane using only [ this ? 
  ] ( http://i.ebayimg.com/t/100-lot-6-inch-utility-knives-knife-box-cutters-snap-off-blade-razor-wholesale-/00/s/nzk1wdc5mg==/z/inaaamxqlgtswzve/$_3.jpg ) and not even two people were able to restrain them ? 
  wow ... 
  i never thought i 'd say this , but there were some serious cucks there . 
  bitch please , the us is divided in states . 
  russia is divided in republics . 
  the real sas for me is when a guy suggested to take the people to a un court and someone replied `` fuck the un '' . 
  taking [ donald trump 's speeches ] ( http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a39031/trump-fourth-grade-level/ ) into account , it 's easy to know why they did that . 
    and most importantly , we do n't try to hide the problems that we do have . 
   i do n't know if i should laugh now , or cringe . 
  they do try to hide them ? 
  i thought it is a very american thing to expose your ignorance blatantly . 
  unless you 're talking about the `` but . . if you exclude this non-white demographic , the us xcrime rate drops to [ shire ] ( http://www.jonathanphotos.com/pictures/australasia%20n%20oceania%20web/new%20zealand%20web/hobbiton/shire%20hill%20panorama%20in%20spring%20web%201400%20n%2072.jpg ) levels '' argument . 
  oh , i did n't think about that . 
  the us tends to be ambiguous , you know ; there are some people parading diversity as the ultimate strength while others think it 'll be their doom . 
  i thought americans hated fascism , as they have been congratulating themselves as singlehandedly saving the entire world for invading normandy , but then you listen to the don and his supporters and some others openly praising hitler and you get confused . 
  damn ... 
  i just realized i commited a huge grammar sin . 
  it 's already a dramadan . 
  a sad one , but a dramadan nonetheless . 
  sloth and lust . 
  yes . 
  why would n't it be ? 
  you are telling the truth , i assume . 
  hmmm ... 
  if that 's the case then i suggest you to look for an excuse and leave ; it 's not healthy to play `` games of deception '' . 
  unless of course , that you 're into international spying . 
  then it 's your job . 
  you earned it man . 
   `` a molotov cocktail would have done the same thing . '',
