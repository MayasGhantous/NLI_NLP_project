  yeah ... about that : i do n't know how to put this but [ he may be a muslim ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jesus_in_islam ) . 
  i do n't know if we should let him in , man . 
  seriously , thanks for being humanitarian . 
   we are the only one 's that fought a war to end slavery, 
  [ estos cabrones ... ] ( http://65.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mej8mq3fjf1rpmjza.jpg ), 
   the only ones that conquer land and then return it to the people rather then holding it as a vassal state . 
  [ mexico became a republic ( formally proclaimed on 1 november 1823 ) and offered to the previously annexed central american provinces the right to determine their own destiny ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_republic_of_central_america#absorption_into_the_empire_of_mexico.2c_1822-1823 ), 
  being a dramanaut and cheering for elfa is pretty much like being a soviet and cheering for stalin though ... 
  america : being the most democratic , moral nation and totally not imperialistic since 1776 . 
  you mean you literally oppress people like elfa does , right ? 
  [ because ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw9pdj1jqru ) . 
  i have made a distrubing ammount of soviet references lately . 
  i 'm i becoming a tankie ? 
  savage . 
  did anyone else get welcomed by a pop-up saying `` sharia law should be banned in all 50 states '' ? 
  great body . 
  awesome artwork . 
  the_donald has also been spiraling down to azula levels of delusion and madness and r/quityourbullshit is in the forefront of calling them out . 
  will the anti-bullshitting army continue the glorious war declared by r/sweden ? 
  are they our only hope for sanity until banning day comes ? 
  hey , [ you got a permit for those guns ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztidn2dbyby ), 
  i really wanted them to call bullshit out in the glorious way they 've done it so far . 
  but it 's on the mods to regulate their subreddit the way they see fit . 
  at sas , we hardly ever `` shittalk '' trump . 
  he 's not dearly loved , but he 's not nearly a main focus on our posts either . 
  i just visited it and i completely agree with the mods on their decision . 
  i love it how subreddits are now having to take a stand on r/the _ donald specifically , some of them cutting off posting about them ( the wall ? 
   speech that is protected by the first amendment to the united states constitution ;, 
  as a r/shitamericanssay contributor , i think this quote will be well received by our community . 
  true . 
  and it 's better that way , in fact . 
  at last , the cat is not portrayed as the villain of the story . 
   we 've never been more alive . 
  what a time to be a redditor !, 
  this is a situation that looks like it was directly taken from black people twitter : we want the sub banned or restricted but at the same time we want a donald bot to laugh about in subredditsim . 
  as time passed by , she got more in shape than when she started . 
  i like her best at her plumpest . 
  should n't you have used d\u00e9sol\u00e9 ( e ) instead of pardon ? 
  long gone are the days of kennedy . 
   i 've never watched star trek ( i will though ), 
  neither have i. 
   when i take a shit i usually get completely naked, 
  * i 'll sniff my hands after scratching my balls ( also toe fingernails ) even though i know they stink . 
  i blame it on primate instincts entirely . 
  * also , i 'd like to bang the corner stores ' shopkeeper 's wife so hard i 'll blow her brains out . 
  she 's got an ass that simply ... is so round and protruding ... 
  * i was n't able to not piss on the bed like , until age 15 . 
  * discovered porn because of checking on my dad 's browsing history ( up to date he still does n't know what browsing history is ) . 
  that 's it reddit . 
  my darkest secrets and i really hope not cannon fodder for subreddit drama . 
  if you 're reading this from subreddit drama because you need to find something to discredt me with you 're a lowly lowly person sir/miss . 
  other than this i 'm a model citizen and a pillar or my community yada yada , exemplary yada yada , gawd guides my path . 
  you know the drill . 
  hmmmm ... 
  the us and its political tensions greatly amuse me . 
  all of this shitshow is not an isolated event but a series of them . 
  the us is a very polarized country where two political parties hold the opposing views and you have to be on one side or the other , with no room for a middle ground . 
  so when convictions clash , emotions rise and communication vitiates to the point where both sides wo n't listen to what people with different views an opinions think , which is the basis os civilized discourse ; both parties * hate * each other , establishing an `` us vs. them '' mindset and waiting for the other person to make a mistake an discredit their opinions so one can feel better about their moral convictions ( e.g : abortion , 2nd amendment ) . 
  when people are too idealistic and defend their views at all costs and are willing to break the rules or incur in violence in order to overcome the action others did in order to secure their policies , then there will be no more discussion . 
  #the fiasco, 
  a terrible display of biased moderation towards the left made the moderators to take extremely poor choices that ended up in what we knew ( including the downright atrocious deletion of the donation information ) . 
  and now , the right 's prejudices looked like prophecies coming true for the right to strike , and they did . 
  to each their own ; ciswhitemaelstrom/dylan-w is great at being a shitlord and has no parallel in doing the manipulation that he does . 
  the attack , being as emotionally stirring as it was the perfect ground to lure as much undecided and moderate republicans/democarats to their side . 
  all the sources seem to point out that the mods censored that thread , but we do n't know for certain ; maybe they did n't preparare an emergency action plan and then they realized they needed a newer thread so they locked the other one , mixed with really poor decisions or as u/794613825 seems to sugges it could have been an inside job by the likes of suspiciousspecialist . 
  it does n't matter : people emotionally parsed this as censorship generating much more drama apart from the distressful situation going in the pulse bar ** because it confirmed a popular suspicion that had been going on for a while ** . 
  u/fly-ntp i just finished editing my comment in case you already read it a few hours ago . 
  lol i do n't know , as i 'm also an outsider . 
  but i think he 's revered by americans as one of the greatest presidents the us has had . 
  at the very least , [ his speeches were smart , inspiring and decent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rpg2zm1vi0#t=0m9s ) unlike trump 's . 
  seriously though , if porn keeps tilting more to erotic/art more `` mainstream '' acting , a dramatic non-porn director could give this girl a shot at acting in a dramatic non-porn spinoff of a porn movie . 
  well , i should have specified : i was talking about jfk specifically , not his family . 
  it 's a bit surprising when you read v/european users suggest that they should leave us alone . 
   how is that new censorship algorithm working for ya ??!? 
  working wonders , apparently . 
  the_donald is off of r/all !, 
  no more spam . 
  thank you white christian jesus for acting by the hand of spez and the reddit engineers . 
  thank you for your service . 
  i salute you . 
  [ 07 07 07 07 07 07 07 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvobcwfu5u0#t=2m47s ), 
  today , you did yankbot 's job . 
  i would n't mind the admins banning them since they are clearly a hate subreddit , at least from my own perspective . 
  but that does n't mean the admins should ban them . 
  like it or not , the_donald has n't broke [ the rules set forth by the admins ] ( http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html ) during the fattening ( more [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/cs25u4n ) ) . 
  true , [ their top mod was banned once again ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mkdw6af.png ) , but there has n't been -- to my knowledge -- sufficient proof that the_donald 's users actively harrass or call for violence onto others ( calling for violence is not the same as reinforcing prejudice ; it 's a slippery slope that leads that way but it 's sadly still within the rules ) . 
  the opposite of hate is not love . 
  love can spur hate and hate can spur love . 
  the opposite of love and hate is indifference . 
  so ... is your mind telling you no ? 
  [ ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtxgl0xpyla ), 
  come on ... you know you want to engage in an argument , babe . 
  surrender to your desires . 
  r. kelly ? 
  what did he do ? 
  it 's ok , i just wanted to know why you said that . 
  well , your perceptions were incorrect ; i did n't know about his long trial for pederasty . 
  i still enjoy his music , though .
