  oh ... my ( mexican ) dad went to malta once and he said maltans were really nice people . 
  quote : judging a group of people based on their voluntary associations and acts is just plain smart , and trump supporters have given the rest of us plenty of reason to laugh at them , hate them , and just generally refuse to tolerate their ilk in polite society . 
  this is the exact same brand of careless profiling that ( some ) trump supporters are guillible from . 
  while i do n't agree with the man 's policies nor his attitude or my general perception i have about his supporters i do n't think hating is ever justified . 
  the next step in this line of thinking is `` doing what it takes '' to stop them ; that 's when trump rallies get stormed by violent anti-trump protesters . 
  while i understand their point , it does make sense to call mass shootings ( a term coined by r/grc and subsecuentially used by the media if i 'm correct ) four or more people being shot ; taking into account the fbi 's definition of mass murder . 
  much porn ? 
  there are usually 4 or 5 posts from different subreddits ( bustypetite and nsfw for the most part ) . 
  is that too much ? 
  of mass killing . 
  or is there a standard definition of mass shooting ? 
  what i 'm saying is that when you justify hate , there 's a slippery slope between hating and violently taking action to thwart them . 
  natural urges , i guess ...

   central americans, 
  taking into account the abuse that druglords , authorities and corrupted authorities commit on their illegal migrants , i can hardly blame them , to be honest . 
  of course my dad 's adventures are not to be relied upon , as it 's anectodal evidence , but he went to argentina and he says people are really nice there . 
  three of the nicest people i 've ever met are argentinians .

  sure , maybe lots of men ( or even most ! ), 
  coincide in this foul behavior . 
  but how do you know some of them are n't just really misguided dudes with little to no common sense that just got lured by a book or some anecdote and decided to give it a try ?

  first of all , i do n't aprove sending dick pics : it 's downright anti-social behavior for what i 'm concerned . 
  having said that , no ; i would n't say it 's the same thing : doing that in public means they 're `` targeting '' the woman without any physical interaction . 
  i would say pulling their dick out in public does fit the category of uncivic behavior of exhibitionist models ( including body painting ) , shooting porn in public places and uncovered breastfeeding , though . 
  yeah , i agree about the targeting ; but the important part was the lack of physical interaction , though . 
  because there is a cultural consensus where breasts are always sexual , much like labia and penises . 
  although the whole body can be erotiziced , the crotch , buttlocks and breasts -- on the woman -- always cause a sexual reaction of sorts because we 're not used to see them directly on a daily basis ( maybe if we lived on a tribe in africa where women 's breasts are not covered , breasts would be as sexual as hands are ) , so i think nipples are not requiered to show in order to provoke that sort of reaction . 
  [ e.g1 ] ( http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/titfreak/4186520/495761690/image.jpeg ) ; [ e.g2 ] ( http://g01.a.alicdn.com/kf/htb1ci26hpxxxxbexxxxq6xxfxxxr/222329440/htb1ci26hpxxxxbexxxxq6xxfxxxr.jpg ) nsfw , obviously . 
  yes , that 's a fact . 
  but , what 's your point with it ? 
   maybe thing are different where you are , but where i live ( midlands , uk ) breasts are n't always seen as sexual sexual . 
  i do n't know anyone who sexualises the breasts of a breastfeeding women . 
  you just made me re-think my stance and i do get your point . 
  lets consider the beach scenario , and tell me what you think about it : at the beach , you can have very little clothing on your body , and you expose parts and amounts of skin that are reprenhensible in any other environment . 
  none of that exposure should be sexual because there is a general social agreement where as long as you cover up the crotch and breasts for women ( excluding nudist beaches ) , you 're good to go . 
  that alone is huge , i mean ; how come you expect showing that much skin not to be sexual when in any other environment it is . 
  how come [ this ] ( http://g04.a.alicdn.com/kf/htb1o1.tgvxxxxayxfxxq6xxfxxxq/201418889/htb1o1.tgvxxxxayxfxxq6xxfxxxq.jpg ) may not be considered sexual but [ this ] ( http://www.balbinalingerie.com/uploadfile/b9/balbina_saud9439/product/plus-size-lingerie/2015-plus-size-babydoll-lingerie-nightdress--7088-1440580941-4.jpg ) does , despite more skin area being covered ? 
  the answer seems to be the * intention * with these clothes are being worn , which is really subjective if you think about it . 
  but on the other side , just because you 're on a certain setting your brain will tell itself : `` all right , i 'm gon na turn the sexual arouse off because we 're at church '' . 
  it just does n't work like that . 
  there are people who you wo n't help but feel sexually aroused by . 
  now comes the fun part : where do we draw the boundary between which parts are sexual an which are not ? 
  true , legs can be sexual if you make them , but what about the crotch ? 
  both labia and penis have reproductive functions , but they also have urinary ones . 
  why is n't it acceptable to show your bare breasts casually at anytime like you would show your ankles , wrists or neck taking into account that breast do not have sexual functions at all ? 
  i know i just asked more questions but i hope that i made my point across : it 's ok to breastfeed in public , as women have their own life stories and i 'm nobody to judge them ; but bringing a large piece of cloth as opposed to showing the world your motherly glory is really not much to ask . 
  it 's just like calling men out for not wearing shirts on the street . 
  #unintended sexual arouse, 
   would you say a woman with big boobs , just shopping minding her own business is drawing sexual attention to her boobs unless she 's wearing a burka . 
  no , she would n't be purposefully drawing attention , and therefore she would n't be * sexuallizing * herself in my perception . 
  but a girl with big breasts definitely draws sexual attention either she wants it or not . 
  there 's where us men should have to have the decency to not cat-call women . 
   what do i expect , if i do n't want comments i should just wear baggy jeans and shapeless dresses, 
  well , if you intend to reduce the risk of being cat-called to the max , maybe that would be a good idea . 
  ideally , you should n't ever be cat-called , but we do n't live in a perfect world . 
  since nothing but self-defense justifies violence , it 's not like you can throw yourself to a man who cat-calls you , but feel free to answer him back . 
  that 's a very interesting example indeed . 
  i did expand on my argument with micia19 about how what it 's percieved as sexual depends on the way and the ( then again , perceived ) intention with which clothes -- or lack thereof -- are being worn . 
  your opinion would be valuable for me . 
  * because it 's never ok to tell people to kill themselves , as it is a deliberately hurtful thing to say ( hence violent ) . 
  it gets worse if the person is depressed and actually considering suicide . 
  * we are talking about a moderator : a person whose responsibility is to keep the community 's conversation and content in order and prevent people from insulting each other in the first place . 
  i hope this has sufficed . 
   i thank you for providing me an hour of entertainment this evening . 
    y tu . 
  god dammit . 
  i hate when people use broken spanish to sound more interesting . 
  done . 
  thanks for the reminder . 
  i thought that was just a random illustration and not one based in actual events . 
  yes , it does n't make logical sense at first , but maybe there is so much sexual advertising that we do n't parse it as sexual anymore , while an uncovered woman can make people feel uncomfortable .
