  i 'm ok with women breastfeeding anywhere . 
  i 'd just ask them to bring some clothing to cover themselves up . 
  unless they 're in a designated space to nurse with other women . 
  to my knowledge , roma people were never enslaved , segregated or selectively targeted for police abuse like african-americans were . 
  but african-americans were never targets of genocide or legal maiming , though there was so much hatred that [ this shit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lynching_of_jesse_washington ) happened . 
  maybe it 's a stalemate ? 
  both of these peoples have suffered a lot of terrible injustice through the centuries . 
  i would n't call sas on this one . 
  well , at first i had [ this ] ( https://images.contentful.com/6m9bd13t776q/3vzqg0f2ceauasquoow2gk/562178d90755b90708d2bdb6ffd39a66/itzy-ritzy-nursing-happens-435x580.jpg?q=75 ) in mind ; but for those mothers who do n't want to cover the baby i think [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/bc/86/83/bc868360023bb17b869cd3c6801cf9dc.jpg ) would be just fine . 
  i like the sentiment in which you want to protect women 's rights . 
  but it 's war . 
  never in human history has anybody truly cared about human rights at wartime . 
  acceptable losses , maybe . 
  the way to say `` you 're welcome '' as a reply to `` thank you '' in spanish is to say :, 
  `` y t\u00fa '' means `` and you '' , and it 's not used in the context of greeting . 
  literally google translate in action . 
  i like it the way it is , really . 
  i does n't even prevent the_donald from appearing at r/all , but i 'm cool with one or two posts from them within the first 50 . 
  they 're just limited to a small amount of space at r/all rather than littering the entirety of it ; same for funny , s4p and others .

  [ * i am ciswhitemaelstrom * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6nxd7rqpf0#t=2m29s ), 
  there was a drama thread about r/hillaryclinton and many dramanauts ( including me ) were a little bittersweet because it was n't quite the same ( butterwise ) without `` cuck '' being thrown back and forth ; this happened around the time when trump refused to debate sanders so the_donald was so very quiet , you could hear the crickets singing . 
  then the orlando massacre happened and they took a second breath : bigger and more powerful than ever before . 
  and that was the moment i regretted about missing them . 
  that 's why i hope his vile war never becomes true ; the drama is not worth the shitstorm . 
  you came to wrong neighborhood muthafucka . 
  yeah , there 's the geneva conventions and whatnot . 
  in the end , nobody is going to really put a stop to america 's ( or any other hegemonic military superpower for that matter ) atrocities in the ages to come . 
  i do n't know if they did it more than once and neither i know if people claim they do this regularly on the present day ; i discovered reddit 8 months ago , and i had learn about the lore at r/museumofreddit . 
  but what srs did back then was no joke and they should n't get away with it by modern standards . 
  if i was on the admin team during the fattening , i would have voted in favor of banning them on the evidence of threatening violentacrez . 
  holy shit , i check most of the items in the picture . 
  if i was born on the us , i would have probably killed myself by now . 
  people are damn obsessed with self-reliance . 
   because we 're actually normal people that realize the night is full of terrors . 
  [ perhaps their weapon of choice is a flaming sword ? 
  ] ( http://www.amoeba.com/admin/uploads/blog/kelly/3665682-tumblr_mm8vs4gouw1sp6labo1_500.gif ), 
  but circlejerk apart , i think that 's pretty reasonable in context . 
   perhaps i am , so long as the problem does not harm me , i do not care if i 'm part of it . 
  children die every day , as do adults , as a christian , i do not see this as a necessarily bad thing . 
   i do n't believe that death matters . 
   i simply do not see it as a problem , i see your belief that it is a problem as ignorance , and that is where my faith comes into the matter , a gun can not damage a soul , and life on earth is so insignificant as to be near meaningless , compared to what waits after . 
   not really , i care for the souls of others , life is fleeting and inconsequential . 
  hello sir , peace be upon you . 
  i understand you prize no value on human life , but in spiritual life . 
  we understand you and we agree with you wholeheartedly . 
  but life has its pleasures , and would n't you like to savor the earthly delicacies in the afterlife forever ? 
  do n't you think it would be nice to have 72 young , beautiful and lusty maidens at your disposal as a just reward for your manliness and bravery ? 
  would n't you like to fight for the one true god and spread the true religion across the world ? 
  call me if you 're interested .

  if i try to harness my cat , she 'll do [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emqt-mv92x0#t=1m38s ) . 
  maybe he 's a transchristian demijew who spiritually indentifies himself as a neobuddhist . 
  nice tan . 
  me too . 
  but i ca n't even say i am competitive because i always tried to play it `` right '' and never abused glitches or refined my precision to [ this level ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3evvrx7jls#t=6m24s ) . 
  holy shit , i remember when the trainer for croatia at the 2014 world cup -- aka [ le chiffre ] ( http://nukethefridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/image-62.jpg ) -- mocked mexico and there were lots of circlejerk after their defeat . 
  but americans are on a whole new level , apparently . 
  the us was n't even the us as that time ... 
  the simple fact that he calls black people `` people of color '' is a huge giveaway . 
  i thought there was some sweet [ you know who ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/8e/f0/e1/8ef0e15a90fd79a4597e4f0f83621daf.jpg ) bashing . 
   the mere thought of having sex with a woman that has has sex with another man disgusts me on so many levels . 
  [ just tell them to come over , man ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr89yq2wc9o#t=3m34s ) . 
  you make it look really good . 
  how about laced lingerie if you feel like changing ? 
  [ he is real ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np2_9jcvzaa ) . 
  but i ca n't really judge him , to be honest . 
  he 's not a regular gun nut . 
  these fuckers ... 
  why does he want to nuke people in the first place ? 
  i could use some context here . 
  americans have used american territory ( mainly nevada ) for nuclear testing [ and have also displaced some people to conduct others at oceania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bikini_atoll ) . 
  but they were not killing anybody . 
  why are some americans so hell bent on exterminating the ideologies they do n't like ? 
  funny , i met my first girlfriend at a baby shower ... 
   however the italians did set up one camp in croatia which killed almost 10,000 people . 
  there was another thread about the croatian concentration camps . 
  they say they were the worst ones ( even worse than the german ones ) . 
  care to explain for the lazy ignorant people ? 
  works in call of dewty , though . 
  my least developed function is se . 
  if anything , differential equations really pulls te off , in my experience . 
  he also mods r/shitamericanssay and does n't have the judgemental righteousness part , which is kinda cool . 
  i do n't know . 
  once you get used to their 5 word vocabulary length , the rate of word repetition simply wears the insults out . 
  but r/drama ... 
  drama evolves , drama adapts itself . 
  drama creates a poison that makes you die of tuberculosis slowly and painfully while forcing you watch miley cyrus in a weird pink bikini spin and wave your life goodbye . 
  not that i know ... 
  but neither did m'lady , right ?

  i trust your messianic leadership m'lawd . 
  my dame of dusk , it was your request that i knocked this issue off . 
  why are you bringing it up again ? 
  [ sapeeee ] ( http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nlomwwuo_ee ), 
  off topic , but the reddit admins acutually hinted ti the fact that there are lots of passwords called `` hunter 2 '' . 
  ehy is that password so popular ? 
  thanks for the explanation !, 
  we love you too .
