  you also do n't have to have sex if you don ' want to / is unnacceptable in your belief system for the time being ; but it definitely does give you an edge in terms of knowing which kind of girl you like or do n't like ( sexually or otherwise ) . 
  the 40 year virgin exists and it 's especially easy for our type to become if we let our guards down . 
  i have n't been said that by girlfrienfs but my parentdls seem keen on that attitude . 
  perhaps it is my that i 'm permanently intuiting and therefore , i hardly pay attention to the outside world . 
  when a person ( worse if it 's one of my parents ) reminds me of every single tiny mistake i have ever made , plus fills me with all of their unsolicited life advice . 
  also when they vent on me . 
  great idea . 
  oh , my mistake ; ser brienne . 
  i know you are . 
  percentage only reaches up to 100 , though . 
  same !, 
   it makes me sad that violence in non-western countries almost never gets a moratorium because nobody cares enough to make it drama . 
  we have to remember which is the main userbase in reddit : americans . 
  therefore , reddit has to adapt to its american userbase ; that 's the reason why r/news is for american news only and r/worldnews is for everyone else ( although european news that have to do with terrorism are almost exclusively the only type of news that make it into r/all for some reason ) . 
  i get stressed about foul events i have no power in controlling so i bury my head like an ostrich and avoid the news . 
  american hot topics are simply unavoidable when visiting reddit ; that 's how i find out about them . 
   this sub sharing mods with the sub , there are no moratoriums for / r/drama . 
  who are the mods that drama and srd share ? 
  mexican here . 
  different countries have different histories , and have evolved according to their situations : some have prospered and become world powers , others have carried ancestral social problems that caused terrible injustices and will still cause them for the ages to come ( e.g : castes in india ) . 
  i read a good book called `` why nations fail '' , and it exposed many reasons why some countries prosper , become rich and have polite and safe societies where crime is practically non-existent ( say , singapore ) , but right off the bat the one that comes to my mind is that ** the countries that prosper rely on their law enforcement officials ** , and also that ** functional democracies have tools for the common people to scrutinize and demand power to step down ** ( for example iceland pm in the wake of the panama papers ) . 
  the us was founded upon these principles . 
  but it seems american people only care about their precious guns and their freedom to discriminate indiscriminately ( 1 ^ st and 2 ^ nd amendments ) . 
  i can hardly see anyone complaining about the breaches on privacy due to the patriot act ( ironically an example of an act that is anti-american in principle , in my opinion ) . 
  this is why the recent police violence in the us disturbs me so much . 
  it does n't matter if only rich people can get their diseases treated , it does n't matter if there 's rampant inequality , it does n't matter if trans people have issues about where to go the restroom . 
  these are all important matters ** but none is as important as upholding the rule of law and letting americans know and feel they can be safe when a person in a blue uniform comes close to them ** . 
  why ? 
  you may ask . 
  well , that tiny thing marks the difference between living in a state with lots of `` normal '' crime and a state where the police force kidnaps 43 protesters only to torture and then murder them , all of this allowed/madated by a corrupt governor who is a puppet of a large criminal organization ( masacre de ayotzinapa ) . 
  or when a governor represses protests and the police force murders and rapes the populace , and a few of them get indicted as scapegoats , leaving crimes impune . 
  you would expect said governor to resign , do n't you think ? 
  think again : he became president ( masacre de atenco ) . 
  the united states in no shining city on a hill . 
  but it 's not mexico either ; do n't let if fall . 
  cheers . 
  exactly what we need after thundering buttslams !, 
  a friend of mine works in the hospitality industry -- hotels -- at canc\u00fan . 
  he says that at spring break time , there 's at least one death a month because of alcohol related stupidity ( plain alcohol poisoning , throwing themselves out of balconies , etc. 
  ) , usually from foreigners . 
  i think mbti theory states that temperament and upbringing contribute to your definitive type and i 'm not quite sure about this , but it appears to be that type is not inborn , it 's more like it consolidates at an early age ( 5 to say an example ) . 
  mbti states that circumstances may force you to develop other cognitive functions or use your auxiliary more than the dominant in some cases , but you 'll always revert back to your main if that 's the case . 
  this sub is to point out hyperbolic shit that americans say , and i do agree with the mod 's decision to take it out . 
  this is just not content that goes along with this sub 's theme . 
  however , i liked your open letter and i think you would n't like the effort to go to waste , so why do n't you post it in r/self ? 
  i think it would be quite welcomed there . 
  think about this : if romney won , gay marriage would not be a reality because he believes `` a marriage is an act between a man and a woman '' . 
  that was a huge social advancement that would have gone in the opposite direction , had romney won . 
  there are many issues that press the united states . 
  i know it 's hard to do so , but try to think ahead and vote according to your perception of what you want for the future of your country . 
  because other people will , and these people will have agendas of their own that will be opposite to your own interests . 
  i 'm mexican . 
  if you think it 's hard having faith in the us , try having faith in this country . 
  there are lots of people in this world that would kill or die to be a citizen of your homeland ; so cheer up my friend !, 
  think about your interests and let democracy serve you , as it is supposed to be . 
  circlejerk apart , that letter had quite a patriotic sentiment . 
  but r/murican 's would perhaps deny it on the grounds that you 're deleting the post : it does n't go along with the sub 's theme . 
  r/murica is all usa # 1 forevah , rah rah !, 
  and these are the kind of people the letter calls out to put their blindfolds aside and be conscious that america first needs a change in attitude , so that a much needed change in laws trails along . 
  nice art on your skin . 
  the thong looks great on you too . 
   i would want the flairs to keep a largely unbiased tone . 
  me too , i 'd like the flairs to be neutral well . 
  the examples i provided were simply the first thing that came to my mind . 
  who would have said that the power to unite races would be unleashed by the japanese , of all people ? 
  which soundtrack ? 
  she 's put some pounds on and she even looks better than before . 
  that 's exacly what i meant . 
  just make some tags in order to comfortably sort between the discussion you want to see . 
  i really do n't know what 's up with the libertarian approach to life ; this is r/intp for pete 's sakes . 
  the whole `` moderation = censorship '' does n't even go with this sub because this is a mbti sub , not a political one , nor controversial , nor is prone to ideological polarization either . 
   the last thing an intp wants is to be told is , `` you ca n't see that because i decided it was something you should n't see . '', 
  that 's not how kia 's sort-by-flair system works . 
  check it out ; not a single post gets hid by the mods : if you want to see all of the posts mixed like they would without being sorted you can simply refresh the page . 
  i do n't think we 'll ever have mod drama on this sub , since it 's not political or prone to ideological polarization ( e.g : the red pill , kotaku in action , twoxchromosomes , atheism , srs , etc. ) . 
  better modding on this sub only means the '' ** hot wife needs to fuck young cock 3 miles away from you ** '' posts will be promptly deleted and this sub can have a well-deserved decoration , plus the sort-by-flair system that will only make this tidier and more efficient ; efficiency being a feature that intps apparently love to circlejerk about . 
  does n't mean we can not change for the better . 
  i do n't think we 'll ever have mod drama on this sub , since it 's not political or prone to ideological polarization ; if we were a drama , shitxsay , political or otherwise confrontational or controversial sub , we would definitely need to keep an eye in the mod list . 
  but this is r/intp , come on ... 
   i bet you also want all the hot singles of my area too, 
  to be honest , argentinian girls are legendary all across mexico for their fabled beauty and well , you know ... [ this ] ( http://www.taringa.net/posts/imagenes/18699780/las-hinchas-mas-sexys-del-mundo-son-las-argentinas.html ) . 
  or endangered whale . 
  well , they do love them but they ca n't help but keep killing them . 
   for some reason this sub makes me feel i should be just okay being alone . 
  but i am not :(, 
  these are just underdeveloped intps , and it 's pretty logical when you think about it : when underdeveloped intps find mbti and subs like this it 's quite relieving because you think you know what was `` wrong '' with your life , so you can expect many of them to hang out around here . 
  then the identification stage kicks in and we take a proud on being `` the warmest machines '' , no emotions baby only l\u00d8g\u00efk . 
  i actually did test infp on 16p after i answered taking into account the experiences that made me mature as a person ( feeling skills , both intraverted and extraverted ) . 
  being a `` pure '' type and sticking to the perfect stereotype is a recipe for disaster : ideally we would like to use all 8 cognitive functions altogether to sort out situations appropriately as they come out and let 's face it : ti-ne is useless in many situations ( dating or manual skills come to my mind ) , even though it 's nice to see ourselves as the ultimate misfit because of the perception that the vast majority of scientific or technological output comes from the analysts and our type ( which may not even be true to begin with ) . 
  relevant username . 
  i upvoted usernames i recognized and the ocasional feeler visitor because i like when they show up . 
  oh , come on . 
  you 're just half way through . 
  that sounds like a pretty normal metal song . 
  i thought you were talking about blasting the instrumental epicness from cata or mop . 
  there are flavors for everyone . 
  i like your style , though . 
  i actually did `` break in '' to an -- i believe -- american 's home once and it ended up being a smooth situation . 
  my cousin and i were walking by the beach along the shore of an island and we ran out of beach ( the coastline ended and was followed by a rocky cliff ) . 
  we were carrying electronics such as cameras and we saw a staircase carved out of the cliff so we decided to just use it .
