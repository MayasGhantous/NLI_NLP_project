  they wore freaking hugo boss and had the ss had a skull on its insignias . 
  if ww2 had n't happened , you would think that was some awesome stuff from warhammer 40k . 
  i do n't know why anyone goes batshit about the slightest mention of ww2 . 
  it 's over already and the germans have been apologizing ever since . 
  because of the holocaust ? 
  [ i do n't see anyone complaining about the purges , the khmer rouge or any other of the genocides that happened after wwii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genocides_in_history#1951_to_2000 ), 
  richard dawkins is a fascinating starting point for this discussion :, 
  he stated that '' [ it would be immoral to bring it ( a down syndrome fetus ) into the world if you have the choice ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/aug/21/richard-dawkins-immoral-not-to-abort-a-downs-syndrome-foetus ) '' . 
  later on he apologized for starting a flame war , not for the statement he made . 
  now , thinking about this , consider he is a professional geneticist , it 's his field , and he knows it much more deeply than almost any person who read his tweet . 
  ( or perhaps the entirety of people who read his tweet ) being a very emotional subject , a lot of people backlashed at him without giving him time to put it into context . 
  ( on [ his apology ] ( https://richarddawkins.net/2014/08/abortion-down-syndrome-an-apology-for-letting-slip-the-dogs-of-twitterwar/ ) , he later wrote without the 150 character restriction the view he summarized in the statement on top of this comment ), 
  i link this event to [ watson 's racist comments ] ( http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/james-watson-sell-nobel-prize ) and tim hunt 's '' [ sexist remarks ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/09/tim-hunt-sexism-controversy-ucl-attempts-to-draw-a-line-under-saga ) '' even though he later on apologized for it . 
  it appears to be that you 'll get crucified for saying something stupid after winning a nobel prize . 
  ( even if it 's a joke ), 
  now , watson had `` racist '' ( in the sense that he believes people of african descent have lower iq than people of other races , not of the type that actually incites violence toward said group ) * remarks * on the subject . 
  hunt was just joking . 
  so it 's interesting how close-mindedness can be perceived on both the public and the scientists . 
  yeah , i 've given a thought about it too . 
  just take into account some things :, 
  * the more you think about a system of believes , the stronger it becomes . 
  this can happen to you if you follow a logical , scientific or philosophical thread , but so it happens with all people , especially those who live in a very closed environment ( like north korea ) and it 's difficult to gather more information other than what 's available/what a higher power considers convenient . 
  if somebody are a heavily religious person , the more he/she thinks about the immaculate conception , the more will he/she believe it . 
  he/she can even rationalize it , because it would become a part of his/her core beliefs . 
  ( that do n't have to be true/legal in the first place to become justified ), 
  * not because there is no evidence of something available , means it does n't exist . 
  bacteria exists but we can not see it , nor black matter , yet it 's still there . 
  i actually learned this lesson trough observations and readings on image and human nature . 
  when i was a kid i disregarded grooming a lot because i just thought people were stupid , what i did n't know is that * everybody * judges other people on their looks ( including myself , but obviously some judge ** way more ** than others ) because it 's a survival mechanism . 
  if you see [ these folks ] ( http://marcianosmx.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tropas_militares-6.jpg ) coming straight to you , it 'd be a natural reaction for you to feel startled . 
  maybe they just need a hug and talk about their feelings and you do n't know that , but it looks improbable , because it most likely it is and if you took the time to rationalize this like a civilized person , you 'd be dead . 
  nature made us evolve like this for an important reason . 
  so personal image had been important to survival , ( and still is ) and people will treat you on the basis of your looks , ( you can not change thousands and millions of years of evolution in 40 years of social change ) and do that too , so you 're not a special snowflake . 
  this kind of knowledge , like many others , is especially elusive to pure reason and logic , so be aware . 
  * you have biases . 
  we all do . 
  is there something you * want * to keep on believing ? 
  let me tell you an embarrassing thing : i believed in santa claus until the painful age of 16 . 
  i remember a classmate of mine telling me : if you 're so logical , how can you believe in a fairy tale ? 
  it does n't make sense . 
  i even rationalized he most probably woud n't live on the north pole , and my mom trolled me by conning me into a discussion of where i defended my ideas in front of a beautiful waitress . 
  god damn . . haha . 
  well , the answer to my classmate 's question was : ** because i fucking want to believe it ** and when that happens , nothing will change your view , so be careful about this . 
  what i 'm doing right now is trying a variation of the 30-5 rule ( 30 minutes study and 5 rest ) where i study until i feel a little overwhelmed and then relax for a `` short '' period of time . 
  the relaxation period for me involves thinking and reviewing the subject i 've just studied , an it 's useful for two things :, 
  * makes me more interested on the subject . 
  * helps me review what i just saw . 
  of curse , based on previous observations of my behavior i avoid listening to music , watching videos on youtube , watching a movie ( or `` just a piece of a movie '' ) because i can get lost on these , and that means the risk of loosing the entire day on it . 
  also try to cover a small piece of material and review it . 
  then stack some more and keep reviewing the newer material and bring back the old once in a while so you do n't forget it . 
  of course , if you do this , you 're gon na need time to do it , so the `` powerrush '' is not an option . 
  ( and yes , i 'm seeking to let go of the bad habit of waiting until the point where passing a subject becomes compromised because of procrastination and saving it at the last minute ), 
  but that 's just me . 
  find what 's useful for you !, 
  have you ever read the book `` how to make friends and influence people '' by dale carnegie ? 
  i think you would find valuable information about interpersonal relationships . 
  i just did that on facebook , actually . 
  somebody posted [ a gif image of a pornstar jiggling her breasts and similing ] ( https://www.facebook.com/motelmaracay/posts/399062336953171?comment_id=399078586951546&amp;notif_t=share_reply ) . 
  ( she 's clothed , but perhaps nsfw ) there was a painting of cottages covered in snow on the back . 
  i was funny and not at the same time :, 
  the op 's statement was `` hey , does anybody know where i can get a picture like the one on the back ? '', 
  note , this was a * painfully obvious * joke . 
  the girl jumping does naturally draw your attention . 
  being a puzzle fan , i remembered there were ravensburger puzzles with that motif so i linked to a site that featured a couple of puzzles with the snow cottage motif . 
  the op tagged me and continued the fun . 
  the unfunny thing was that i also made a comment ( then deleted it ) about the assumption that the girl probably despised the cameramen an the director for telling her to do such a stupid thing . 
  but op 's response was not nearly as judgmental as your op . 
  analyzing ( fun analysis , i 'm not a psychologist or anything ) your case i think you made three mistakes :, 
  1st . - you assumed everyone would know your good intentions ( what 's wrong with letting them experience some emotion ? 
  the lives of most people are dull and they are absolutely thirsty for excitement , that 's why entertainment is such a large industry ) as they were n't explicitly expressed in your first comment . 
  ( nobody can read your mind ), 
  2nd . - the correction you did to the op 's dad is actually right , you just paraphrased his words in a much more consistent way . 
  conveying ( for us logical , rigorous , less emotionally vulnerable types ) the same thing , just adding clarifications to make it logically consistent . 
  nevertheless , the dad `` protected '' his son by stating what he said . 
  then you used some cultured language . 
  now , the content of your words express just a little bit of what you communicate , and what you communicate is the `` end product '' of your wording . 
  that 's called meta-communication . 
  ( look it up if you do n't believe me ) when you spoke in such a cultured language disregarding his idea , it sort of made you look more intelligent , and by being such a powerful and dismissive argument , it made him look less intelligent than you . 
  this , likely caused a chain reaction for the op 's comment to happen . 
  ( op backlashed at you because you made him look stupid , he reacted like this in other to protect his dad ), 
  3rd . - you became emotionally invested in your intentions of `` enlightening '' the audience and being oblivious of the strong feelings of other people , and being oblivious of your own feelings yourself !, 
  you did n't like how it felt , did you ? 
  well , neither did them . 
  it 's just that feelings are somehow hidden to us intp 's because we follow logical threads , and feelings do not . 
  ** but ** they 're intuitive to other people so they can perceive them easily . 
  it 's a handicap to us because there 's an understated rule that feelings are to be `` just felt '' , never explained . 
  [ that 's the reason why you can kill a relationship by telling your crush you 're lusting her ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3p3x92/tifu_even_further_update_to_tifu_by_telling_my/ ) ( this last part is true for most women , for most men you 'll most likely end up having sex , because of evolutionary stuff and the like ), 
  that 's the catch . 
  if you want to have it perfect at the first try , you 'll never succeed . 
  you * have * to fail . 
  planning can reduce losses , but it wo n't shield you from failure . 
  nice !, 
  go for it op !, 
  do n't be careless though . 
  in case you fail ( statistically you 'll most probably will ) learn about it , and reach for the stars . 
  that 's what [ jobs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/steve_jobs ) did . 
  brave or stupid ? 
  correct answer : heroic . 
  true . 
  arrr !!,
