  we ended up in the backyard of a house and a person just waved at me and smiled from the back . 
  he had an obvious white american phenotype but i approached him and tired to communicate in spanish for the sake of not sterotyping and when he replied in broken spanish i switched to english and politely asked if we could cross his garden and his house in order to reach the other side , as we would have to walk several miles back in order to reach a street from the beach . 
  he said yes and we said goodbye , they turned out to be really nice people ( he actually offered to call a cab for us ) . 
  but i guess americans in the us are quite different from those having a summer house in mexico . 
  one thing is racial diversity and another thing is including people of different countries . 
  you can be a xenophobe and have no problem sharing a nativist feeling with friends of similar thoughts but different races . 
  countries can be very diverse ... 
  they can be so diverse they can have different attitudes regarding diversity . 
  take the us for example . 
  i guess a campus near silicon valley can have very racially diverse workgroups or groups of friends . 
  and then there 's [ this ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/27/map-segregation-america-race_n_3824693.html ) . 
  in order to make r/aww melt down about girls with cats , do n't talk about a specific race of cats ; talk about * the number * of cats she has . 
  artorias would like a word with you , sir . 
  i think the incels/truecels problem is just a natural consequence of forever alones swallowing the red pill ( whether they deduced it by themselves or found it in a blog ) ; i think there are some extremely competitive societies and evironments where it seems like it 's governed by the red pill principles ; so it 's understandable that they came to those attitudes and yes : although it 's their choice to be like that , i think that under the `` right '' circumstances , we could have these deranged views ourselves . 
  stages of smiling :, 
  * normal . 
  * cameron diaz . 
  * joker . 
  i fucking lover her smile . 
  and her attitude ( if she 's in real like thw way she plays her characters in the movies ), 
  if she 's batshit crazy and she 's threatening you with a weapon that could be potentially lethal , go for the first hit in order to disarm her . 
  when you feel threatened , the fight has actually started ( for me ) . 
  pay attention to her moves , if she attacks first , dodge and fight her . 
  try to use miminum force , but if you cant help but knock heer out because the situation is pressing do so . 
  your life is what matters the most ; needless to say you should use minimum force , you 'll manage the legal aspects later . 
  verbal insults never warrant physical aggression . 
  that sounds like a quote taken straight out of [ this feeling ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/8/82/sadness_fullbody_render.png/revision/latest?cb=20150615091236 ) . 
  i have n't read the communist manifesto or any of his works but based on my perception of historical development of communist/socialist societies and governments i say marxism is the greatest of ideas on paper but an extremely bad one in practice . 
  this is an accurate representation on my fast definitions of cognitive functions . 
  was n't that joy ? 
  i think this classic intp thing is due to one of two problems , or a combination of them, 
  #ne problems, 
  i have found this is ne problem . 
  when ne is extremely active you tend to jump from one pleasure center to another . 
  i have recognized that i can easily spend more than 5 hours straight in front of the computer doing nothing productive if i let my guard down . 
  my most time-consuming unproductive activity is daydreaming , which in my case means imagining the fucking awesome animation projects i have in my mind that come to life when i listen to music , so i repeat youtube music videos over and over and over ... 
  i simply do n't get tired of them . 
  so you would have to answer [ the question ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq-ru6kqhe4 ) that the philosopher known as ludacris posed to the world , and then get rid of them to do some productive work . 
  the problem with ne is that the extroverted part of our personality is used by intution . 
  my hypothesis is that any other combination would be better for productiveness ; people who have extroverted judging functions ( fe , te ) are driven by their environment to achieve things ( people or improving life conditions ) , whereas se users ca n't stand an environment that does n't satisfy their senses . 
  but ne is just satisfied exploring the posibilities and ti just likes joining them together in a coherent system . 
  procrastination occurs when you are the bad type of perfectionist : the one that wants to get things done flawlessly at the first try . 
  if you pair this up with the [ fixed mindset ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mindset#fixed_mindset_and_growth_mindset ) you get a trainwreck where you do n't get anything done because you * fear failure * . 
  think about it : have you ever had a piano in front of you with absolutely nobody around and did n't give it a try to play anything because you knew you 'd surely sound awful ? 
  or did you think it would be the coolest thing to draw something but never started because you were -- deep inside -- worried that it would n't match your lofty expectation ? 
  i mean , there 's literally nobody around to judge you * but yourself * . 
  basucally , it all boils down to the procrastination equation ( part 1 ) :, 
  self worth = competence = performance, 
  so , if your performance value in something is very low or zero , that means your self worth is zero . 
  your subconscious mind in not happy about this , so it will do anything to protect the precious self-worth . 
  the device for achieving this is to procrastinate . 
  self worth \u2260 competence - procrastination time \u2260 performance, 
  and now the subconcious mind is happy because the perception of self worth is protected ; plus , you had lots of fun doing all these things you were n't supposed to . 
  the trade off is feeling guity but that 's affordable to the subconscious mind . 
  but it 's not so good for your life . 
  solution : develop your abilities and more resistance to frustration . 
  get exposed to challenging situations and detach your mind of the outcomes ( meditation is a good way to stop thinking about failure and everything else ) . 
  recognize that theory is valuable but you ca n't build everything around it ( unless it 's theoretica physics or something like that ) and that every failure is a necessary building block for learning . 
  i visited my school 's psychologist frequently and i doubted of my intelligence . 
  we did three separate intelligence tests -- although i only remember two -- in which is was comfortably above the median ( but anything really bright ) . 
  i still doubted about my intelligence and my ability to develop abilities due to many failures in college so i started learning russian ( a supposedly hard language for westerners that features a different writing system [ cyrillic ] ) . 
  i ca n't speak it nor read it yet to the point of functional literacy , but i 'm encouraged by being able to increasingly understand texts simply by memorizing words on lists ( i do have a specific pnemotechnic device though ) . 
  nope . 
  edit : call me retarded , but what does this post have to do with modship ? 
  booty call . 
  we 're gon na build a wall . 
  and make r/circlejerk pay for it . 
  amen , brother . 
  + / u/user _ simulator / u/bootyboots2, 
  no results on google reverse image search . 
  who is this godess ? 
  a bot that takes stuff you said and mixes it up to make a brand new phrase . 
  apparently i 'm extremely sad because a girl with dubious connections has n't kept her word . 
  come on jebus , you can do way better than this . 
   ok : a subreddit constantly making explicit death threats to a specific redditor . 
  the death threats may be in poetry form , youtube video , or just stated outright . 
  proof ? 
  not quite ; it 's actually entertaining to me . 
  but i understand perfectly that it 's not the content you want to see . 
  if i was a mod , i 'd tag this so you could filter it out ; but i would n't delete it because apparently more than 66 people have enjoyed it so far . 
  edit : to be fair , this post sounds like it deals more with fi than fe . 
  it 's probably better suited in a sub with fi users ( xxfps ) . 
  you have never encountered [ a wasp ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/06/03/18/1d9342a700000578-0-image-a-51_1433353341623.jpg ) before , have you ? 
   they always say how things would be so much better if all mexico had been ** annexed ** ( favorite word of such people ) . 
  trivia : what 's the slightly politically charged word for annexation in german ? 
  answer : [ hover over this blue text to see ] ( / s `` anschluss '' ) . 
  holy shit , i take back what i said . 
  you must have [ sam gamgee levels of bug control ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfjirrzrq60 ) . 
  also , friendly advice : patio = backyard . 
  she did us see her frustration and sense of failure before trying to resurface with bing bong . 
  it is an interesting point of view , but i do n't agree with it . 
  the video argues that it was all joy 's fault , but all of this mess was started by both joy and sadness clumsily tussling over a core memory which activated the vacumm to get powered and suck them in . 
  leaving riley incapable of feeling joy and sadness and leaving fear , anger and disgust in command . 
  the morale of the story is that all emotions are equally important and serve a purpose ( like when sadness comforts bing bong ) , regardless of which emotion is felt the most ( and also that it 's not healthy to dispose an emotion that is conventionally `` bad '' by cultural standards ) . 
  a key point of discussion in the video is that joy was manipulative . 
  well ... she kind of was because she was the leading emotion in riley ( her mother 's was actually sadness and his father 's -- and the bus driver 's at the ending credits -- was actually anger ) , and also because she was immature and thought that she could dispose of sadness , joy being the main emotion and sadness antagonizing her ; at the end of the film all of them share the console and actually the core memories [ were colored differenly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh0yn2ds1pi#t=6m29s ) ( hinting that joy matured and let core memories also be terrifying , disgusting , anger-inducing and sad ; accordingly ) . 
  if it was shopped i ca n't see the difference . 
  also , the image on deviantart is in a very high definition . 
  what 's the bad news about this ? 
  edit : it seems like this comment is being downvoted .
