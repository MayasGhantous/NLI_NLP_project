  may i know why ? 
  perhaps it 's because it 's on tumblr . 
  i just wanted to carry on with the got meme . 
  she is actually beautiful . 
  she just has to lose some 175 kg . 
  and get the consequential skin removal . 
  bluuuuud !, 
  i do n't think she 'd have an emotional disorder , but joy being so dominant she may have left her unprepared for a devastating blow in life such as the death of a loved one . 
  she 's gorgeous , but if you visit [ her tumblr page ] ( http://kellilynnsage.tumblr.com/ ) you 'll know much her make-up artist and photographer made her shine on that picture . 
  like 5 times a day . 
  i do n't know why some people say not papping energizes them . 
  different physiologies , i suppose . 
  i made a tremendous effort to not fap for nearly a month once ( to lose the habit ) and at the end of it ... well , let 's say kyle 's dad knows the feel . 
  i do n't know about thick skin ... 
  but maybe they have got, 
  #thick fat . 
  then scalia kicked in and said that it was not quite the case ; but for people to `` defend themselves '' . 
  or call the cops and let them do the shooting . 
  i think what captain america here tried to explain is that the us speaks english as it 's primary language for common , daily exchanges ; since english has become the lingua franca of the world , people of other countries/cultures * learn english to communicate * . 
  so it 's easy for americans to let foreigners adapt to them instead them adapting to other people . 
  it 's a cultural thing , and it 's ok : nobody should bash americans for not knowing other languages ( [ as long as they are not fucking ignorant about them ] ( http://www.npr.org/2016/04/20/475015239/flying-while-muslim-profiling-fears-after-arabic-speaker-removed-from-plane ) ) . 
  if they do n't want to invest on them , they 're missing it . 
  holy shit , domestic violence exists in switzerland ? 
  whoa . . 
  expanding on this :, 
   use your wit and analytical skills to figure out social mechanics and how to applie them . 
  social analysis is only good for starters . 
  in the end you want to be able to * feel * -- like in fe -- the situation to correctly assess how other people are feeling and which actions you can do to provoke a favorable impression to meet your needs for the situation ( do n't be selfish shitlord all the times , though !, 
  blaze it !, 
   i 've seen people from both sides of numerous `` internet culture wars '' claim that srd is too neutral, 
  proof ? 
  what we want :, 
  * arguments . 
  * gossip . 
  * scandals . 
  * witch-hunts . 
  * ** lolcows ** . 
  * ** assholes ** . 
  * ** trainwrecks ** . 
  * ** meltdowns ** . 
  * dramatic news articles . 
  * dramatic rumours ( with context ) . 
  * ** dramatic everything from anywhere ** . 
  from the r/drama 's sidebar . 
  i 'd still hit her , though . 
  ok , that makes a lot of sense now . 
  i personally ca n't see -- for the time being -- how being `` too neutral '' on issues as long as you stay informed and not indifferent is a bad thing . 
  nice , well-written hypothesis . 
   the fact that people ca n't seem to just say `` man , this movie looks dumb , think i 'll pass '' and instead launch into a sermon about how it 's an affront to `` us . '', 
  do n't you think it 's a little ironic to point out that the problem is that they ca n't let go off of things when this self-righteous sub effectively antagonizes their views and it 's just as stubborn and biased in its position ( which has the undesirable effect of futher polarizing them ) ? 
  arab-israeli conflict in a nutshell . 
  / u/user _ simulator / u/bootyboots2, 
  true . 
  but that 's the reason why it 's so hypocritical to enjoy the popcorn and and wonder why these people are so close-minded and combative ( standing from a moral superiority stance , no less ) . 
   i do n't take anything on this website seriously and neither should anyone else, 
  easy to say so . 
  i agree with you and i wish all visitors were like you ; that would spare us from all the caamibs , red pillers , trump supporters ( the type that says `` cuck '' like there was no tomorrow ) , etc. 
  out there , which would actually improve the world we live in with the trade-off that hardly anyone would contribute to this sub ( which is a pretty great deal if you ask me ) . 
  but sadly , this is impossible . 
   i do n't see that it 's hypocritical to also wonder why they take it so serously at the same time, 
  because they feel their moral framework is being attacked by critics like dramanauts and what they consider to be `` swjs '' . 
  this polarizes them and makes them reinforce and fossilize their views . 
  as a dramanaut , you 're well aware of this , but you do n't have any interest in making it stop because you enjoy their collapse and how them doubling down on their views will produce further entertainment . 
  actually , perhaps `` hypocritical '' is not the best word to describe this attitude . 
  it 's more like obliviousness with a dash of malice . 
  with my dick . 
  i just had a `` what have i become '' moment in which i realized that calling out the bias in this subreddit out for being smug , casting judgements from a high horse and being inconsistent does make you become what you criticize in the first place . 
  now i find myself calling dramanauts `` malicious '' for having fun when i 'm subscribed to r/shitamericanssay which is pretty much the same thing , in a different presentation . 
  i 'm just saying that if you already know these people are so easy to polarize , maybe it would be a great idea to not generate popcorn at their expense . 
  these people can be dangerous ( just yesterday this sub and drama hosted puffinmasta who threw death threats away like they were candy ) and it 's not convenient for anyone to have them around further consolidating their ideas that are not in touch with reality ( for christ sakes , donald trump is the republican nominee thanks to these folks ) . 
  but i 'm nobody to judge anybody 's thoughts or actions ; sorry for calling you `` malicious '' . 
  being an intp does n't mean you comply to the `` starry eyed , good at math , obsessive chess player who loves wow , attends to comic-con and is socially awkward '' . 
  it means having this specific functional stack :, 
  each function may focus on a certain activity or aspect of life , and while chess or math are typical areas where logical consistency is needed and ti thrives on it , one could be really bad at them and instead use ti to try to figure out how to bake cakes better and quicker . 
  there are many outliers out there , making us intps very different between individuals . 
  that 's the reason why you should n't attempt to type using stereotypes . 
   now i just want to ... never talk with them again so i do n't have to deal with their judgement . 
  it 's not other 's judgement what you fear ; it 's * your own * . 
  you did change for the better , keep on it . 
  i know that plane tickets are expensive and it 's understandable if you 're beating yourself to it right now . 
  but it was a mistake and you 'll lose much more than the money or the time you spent if you ruminate on this . 
  let it go , and instead try to develop your se to pay more attention to your surroundings so this never happens again . 
  i bet you were thinking about the endless possibilities of your inner world or you were revisiting a thread like if you were dumbledore in the pensieve . 
  fuck it , i did like that commercial . 
  gee , it appears that the metasphere is in a permanent grief/moratorium state these days . 
  orlando --  dallas --  nice, 
  also medina , baghdad and dakka in between , but i guess not being * chic * and fancy does n't warrant media coverage . 
  or moratoriums for that matter . 
  or an asshole fearrow . 
  did you take out shakirabot yet ? 
  americans seem to americanize everything that they like/see as virtuous . 
  t'challa was completely african , with no ties to the us ( or the american continent ) whatsoever . 
  cnn slapped the `` american '' in his description to make it look like he was from an african diaspora in the us rather than completely african . 
  i agree with you . 
  it sounds reasonable given the absurdly tense racial climate in the us . 
  remember folks : the us can be many things , but imperialistic is not one of them . 
  sgt , you are really the herald of tragedy . 
  not even [ gandalf ] ( http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2011/09/08/who-is-gandalf-stormcrow/ ) was like this , man . 
   but it has nothing to do with trying to make black panther american because he virtuous . 
  sorry , my bad .
