  we actually had a taste of what 's that like in mexico with the whole energetic reform debates . 
  did you remember that one ? 
  there were very stubborn people on the conservative side . 
  it gets better if you get to central america . 
  look at the names of their soccer players ; something along the likes of jefferson montero or washington tavarez . 
  i remember the good ol' times when he played for jaguares de chiapas . 
  but now he 's gone to some fancy european club ... 
  i do n't know why latin america likes to do that , seriously . 
  it 's like we 're going to name all of the american founding fathers by naming soccer players at this rate . 
  who 's in for some fun regarding the 2nd ammendment , abortion , immigration , challenging traditions and instituting/abolishing religion-based laws ? 
  we 're all the same type , yet different people . 
  my problem has never been being too icy ; it was a bad case of awkardness and anxiety . 
  but i 'm trying to empathize with you . 
  it seems that it 's not so much a problem with your partners , but with you . 
  how about if the next time you see your couple you stop for a moment when you feel really happy with that person and treasure how you feel ? 
  and the next time you feel overbeared you can remember how it felt and how wonderful that person is . 
  people will want to be affectionate for the most part . 
  i for example love my feeler girlfriends . 
  but you may want to look for somebody who is less affectionate that you ; although it may occur that now it 's going to be * you * the one who is overbearing the them . 
  a possible outcome would be to make you realize how good your former couple was . 
  but then again , it may be too late to salvage that . 
  never take things ( and people ) for granted . 
   crimes are only newsworthy when it was done by a muslim or an arab . 
  in the free world \u2122 . 
  i do n't think people care very much if a much worse killing happens in a muslim , african or latin american country . 
  a massive bombing happened in kabul and there was no reddit live thread , nor 3 posts on r/all ( post algorithm ) . 
  upvoted for username . 
  what did they say ? 
  great one . 
  no we wo n't . 
  the classic sas keeps getting repeated ad-nauseam ( moon landing , peacekeepers of the world , ultimate freedom -- given by guns of course -- , yuropistan , americans do -- insert stereotypical activity from x country -- better than xans , etc ) . 
  it gets boring at times because of the way it 's repeated , but that makes sense due to the fact that propaganda needs to be repeated to sink in . 
  my girlfriend is esfp . 
  she 's loyal to me even though she 's gone to the us , thousands of kilometers away from me . 
  it 's possible that the word is found more often due to the fact that more books are pusblished as time goes by . 
  well , it 's just a hunch . 
  we `` broke up '' before she went to the us ( she 'll be back in a year ) and we agreed to give each other carte blanche to date/have sex with other people and if any of us engaged in a relationship , just to let each other know . 
  she was very attached to me before she left , and we keep in touch constantly . 
  it 's not : they go further and say `` i 'm trying to explain to educated europeans '' or something . 
  but it should n't be something to lose our minds for , granted . 
  as a mexican , the inability of some americans to use '' \u00f1 '' is quite funny , as they write `` anos '' ( ani ) instead of `` a\u00f1os '' ( years ) . 
  so much for a wavey diacritic symbol , eh ? 
  edit : actually , i personally think greek script looks really cool , even if it 's cheeky english and not greek . 
  this does n't have to do anything with the current topic but ... could you translate [ this epic speech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vymqpcaasu4#t=0m17s ) into greek ( in greek script , obviously ) pleeeeaaase ? 
  ** awesome !, 
  thanks a lot !, 
  now that was fun , was n't it ? 
  i do n't know about you , but that speech makes me feel, 
   `` ninio '', 
  maybe they 're yucatecs . 
  diggwaswaybetter 's reply should be an indication of why it 's still a default . 
  there are some people who think that not including or `` representing '' them -- even in a way that is forced or convoluted -- is discrimination . 
  i thought it meant `` power '' , like in `` democracy '' ( which means `` the power of the people '' unless i 've been living in a lie ever since i was a child . 
  i 'm not very well versed in greek mythology , but i 've read that gow does not have very accurate depictions of mythological events , creatures or gods ; but santa monica really did a good job on putting its own spin to it . 
  gow kratos is a very iconic video game character as of now . 
  #high energy, 
  #build the wall, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ( to keep them away from us ), 
  i 'm ignorant on this subject , but maybe `` kratos '' means `` power '' only as an administrative power , rather than as a synonym for `` might '' . 
  curious russian parallel : [ \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c ] ( https://translate.google.es/#en/ru/power ) ( vlast ' ) means `` authority '' -- first word from the synonym list -- and [ \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c ] ( https://translate.google.es/#en/ru/area ) ( oblast ' ) means `` area '' -- third word from the synonym list -- as a political boundary . 
  #obraka = obama = osama but the again mods = gods . 
  i am getting really confused about what to think and i also ca n't avoid abusing caps and headers . 
  probably that 's what the admins had in mind when they asked the mods to let it become a default . 
  but there are a lot of people who think that not being included equals being discriminated . 
  it does . 
  the ghostbusters drama was spawned because of these guys . 
  do n't even get me started on pe\u00f1a nieto , who says so much shit he deserves his own tracker . 
  he said the marines were fishermen and monterrey is a state ( it 's the state capital of nuevo le\u00f3n ) amongst many , many , many other things . 
  this sas has a very special place in our hearts . 
  it 's like the scandinavian eugenics one . 
  well , yeah ; i did n't think about that . 
  i 'm using an english keyboard though , and i am able to use accents and the letter '' \u00f1 '' ; it becomes easy when you memorize the layout . 
  nevertheless , smartphones are a pain to use . 
  i straight up ignore \u00f1s , accents and opening question and exclamation signs . 
  maybe there 's a not-so-hidden option to change the layout according to the language , but i have n't looked for it yet . 
  i 'm guilty !, 
  it looks really cool , though . 
  the store clerk 's reaction is priceless . 
   100 buttholes of solitude, 
  [ i liked that thought process ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/gabriel_garcia_marquez.jpg/250px-gabriel_garcia_marquez.jpg ) . 
   incidentally , that 's a thing i 've noticed native speakers are just ... bad at , placing accent marks . 
  sadly true . 
  truth to be said , spanish is not a simple language . 
  gee , that actually makes sense . 
  but you know what would be even more stupid ? 
  giving inconditional military support to countries that already have a large , working and powerful military , advanced nuclear capabilites * and * are rich and technologically developed on their own to the point where they developed an anti-missile system that shoots rockets ( arguably the worst threat to national security ) with rockets of its own and have an effective , pressing blockade on their enemies . 
  now , that would be plain stupid . 
  right guys ? 
  guys ? 
  i think they think that equating diversity of culture to diversity of skin tonalities only applies to `` white '' people . 
  there are lots of different tones of `` black '' but they 're all thrown into the same cathegory . 
  who 's the gorgeous girl far right ? 
  jaden james would be impressed . 
  she is . 
  i 'm doing my part !, 
  [ also , letting out she-wolves from their closets is mandatory . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bookp974b0k#t=1m34s ), 
  that 's what we do . 
  and remember : service ** guarantees ** citizenship . 
  could somebody explain what happened there ?
