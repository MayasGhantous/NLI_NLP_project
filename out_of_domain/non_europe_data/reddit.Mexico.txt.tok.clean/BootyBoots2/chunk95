  to be fair , that 's also a mexican problem . 
  they lack the helicopters though . 
  does n't every single lower to middle class american does that every day , already ? 
  ok , how do you go from `` inability to casually get laid '' to `` only white people are humans '' ? 
  entps ... trolling people for fun . 
  i am mexican as well , and though i know it 's very hard to spot morbidly obese people here ( like the stereotypical american ) , we do have an obesity problem . 
  `` beer gut '' people are usually obese ; you can actually train your eye to spot overweight or obese people . 
  so , twitch causes stimulation ? 
  well , it 's hard to determine one 's type ; let alone others . 
  but were n't entps stereotypically the ones prone to argue for the sake of arguing , and not necessarily taking factual information into account ? 
  since clubbing or partying are activites that could be described as a target rich environment by maverick mitchell . 
  since i do have quite a sex drive , the possibility of going out and meeting girls is exciting for me . 
  also , alcohol lets me loosen up a bit , and meeting new friends through friends is cool because it 's hard to imagine how people are without an excuse to socialize . 
  a party is an excellent excuse to meet them , as opposed to many other situations where approaching simply does n't feels right due to inferior fe . 
  this is my intp outlier now , but i used to be exactly like you before the high sex drive kicked in . 
  setting goals to measure progress is great ; just one word of advice : human interactions are the fe turf , and you 'll want to stop analizing and start developing feels in order to `` read '' other people . 
  if you 're very socially awkward you 'll naturally have a lot of blunders at first but that 's a necessary part of the process . 
  just do n't kick yourself if you do n't reach the goal or you screw it up ; the more you go out , the greatwer ability you 'll develop . 
  this one turned out to be true , though . 
  we have a shameful record of mistreatment of central americans ; i 'm sorry for any inconvenience you might have had because of us . 
  `` se hace notar '' also sounds more natural than `` se hace saber '' . 
  relevant comment for a relevant username . 
  holy shit , that quote is legit . 
  exact same percentages !, 
  or people with their intestines popping out . 
  you did great !, 
  it 's going to get better the more you do it , though ; i hope you had fun . 
  i just love that color combination , the thong does frame your buttlocks , though . 
  edit : did you forget to take the label out or you just like it how it feels there ? 
  just curious ... 
  cue x-files music . 
  someone should animate this jewel . 
  the original , or course !, 
  he would have replied with a :, 
   what an emotionally loaded rant , you 've entirely missed my point . 
  your inbox must be dead now , but let me tell you that as a mexican , i love how your wife 's style does pay respects to the ancient mayan codex art . 
  i love the artwork in general . 
  it would be dope if she tried aztec codex art ; how about a scene with the `` mexican pokemons '' ? 
  ( cacnea evolutions , maractus , maybe rayquaza as quetzalc\u00f3atl , and ho-oh or mega pidgeot as the eagle on the coat of arms and the snake could be serperior or geen seviper ; lotad evolutions and hawlucha could fit in 1950 's illustrations of daily life ), 
  yes . 
  her `` mayan '' artwork is impressive , but i thought that it would be cool if she tried a more [ aztec ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_l2uq-k2-mtc/tkgaove9a_i/aaaaaaaac2g/momtk17fyri/s1600/507px-codexmendoza01.jpg ) type of art ( which is not so squared ) . 
  she could also try to depict scenes of the evolution of mexican society by including pokemon in an art that resembled [ david alfaro siqueiros style wall paintings ] ( http://321ignition.free.fr/pag/es/art/pag_001/pag.htm ) , or [ diego rivera 's ] ( http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2011/rivera/es/images/img/chronology/fig22.jpg ) . 
  bonus : diego rivera was heavily invested in communism and [ this ] ( http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2011/rivera/es/images/img/chronology/fig10.jpg ) is his artwork for a soviet magazine , back in the day ; which i did n't know that existed !, 
  one truly learns stuff everyday . 
  great modding , sgt. 
  i heard she krushev 'd her plane : c, 
  so much disregard for other 's lives ... 
  why are you saying that ? 
   few of them [ foreigners ] understand the subtleties of actual policy discussions or situations, 
    to be fair , many americans do n't understand the subtleties of policy or the situations at hand either . 
     yeah but mexico is going to pay for the wall . 
  what the fuck ? 
  what does us paying for the wall has to do with not understanding subtleties ? 
  yeah , that was my initial thought as well ; it 's just that i do n't think any of us would write in that particular style . 
  impresonating someone in writing takes some kind of `` writing acting '' , and this looks like pure sas on the wild , i do n't think any of us would do that . 
  now , * i want to believe * we have n't fallen so low as to need to both go brigade another thread and generate fake sas to have a laugh . 
  the title says it : the thread is full of it , and well ... you 're on reddit for a start ; i guess the only social network/imageboard that are worse than reddit saswise is 4chan and voat . 
  we 'll never run out of sas . 
  relevant flair . 
  edit : my flair is relevant too . 
  i adopted a female cat because as a male person i thought it would be cruel to castrate him in order to get him neutered . 
  turns out they do n't care and actually it improves their lives , as they become less agressive besides other health benefits . 
  declawing them on the other hand ( or so i heard ) , is barbaric . 
  have you got a reliable source on that ? 
   i questioned why people always suggest mass genocide as a solution for climate change in a thread yesterday , and multiple posts stated that since sub-saharan africa did n't contribute to scientific advancement as much as the west , they deserved to be eliminated . 
  if anyone with the smallest bit of intelligence -- and morals -- was to do that , the obvious country pick would be both the us and china , that are not only by far the most polluting countries but also refused to commit to the kyoto treaty , making it basically useless . 
  sub-saharan africa , on the other hand is probably the least polluting region in the world , as their economy is sadly the weakest . 
  i 'm getting the impression that there 's a dangerous group of americans who have complete disregard for life ( much more disregard for other 's life than their own , though ) . 
  no group of people should be genocided . 
  is it so hard to stop being so blind and invest in cleaner energy ( at the sad expense of coal and petroleum workers ) for global benefit instead of nuking the group that pollutes the least ? 
  also , regarding the white man 's burden about sex in africa , scott lively insipred uganda 's death penalty ( and he is not a muslim ! ), 
  for homosexuals and it seems like the us pepfar was a failure in our favorite region , making americans spend $ 1.4 billion dollars that could have been better spent in ~ ~ education or healthcare ~ ~ a brand new aircraft carrier . 
  i 'm nobody to tell you how you shoud feel or think ; i can just limit myself to share my opinions . 
  the reason why i consider this to be worrisome is because it 's dangerous ( in the sense of accidents ) , makes it not only easy but also lawful for school shooters to enter their target buildings and creates a `` good guy with a gun '' / castle doctrine mindset that is disregards the role of trained law enforcement officials and endangers innocent people ( and the license holder ) by allowing them to try to engage the shooter at the risk of shooting a bystander . 
  i think the worst thing is that it does nothing to keep firearms away from civilians -- which is the root of firearm violence in my opinion -- who should n't need them in the first place . 
  if attacks keep happening , is because people acquire the means to commit them . 
  of course , this last paragraph is just a hunch ; and uninformed opinion of mine and a conjecture at best . 
  perhaps an official institution devoted to science and statistics could prepare a comprehensive study about gun control to implement policies based on science and not speculation , but [ the nra hampered it ] ( https://www.google.com.mx/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;q=nra%20blocks%20gun%20violence%20research&amp;oq=nra%20bloc&amp;aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l5.3796j0j7 ) . 
  sir , you just made my day . 
  actually , only the first one has a link that leads to research papers that do n't have a paywall . 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  now i 'm convinced that outdoor cats are a problem to themselves and other species and we should keep them indoors . 
  [ said link ] ( http://www.kittycams.uga.edu/research.html ) . 
  at least service guaranteed citizenship in starship troopers ... 
  meh , the us has a kenyan muslim president . 
  beat that . 
  if he 's seriously consider crossing an actual ocean and thousands of kilometers for you , then yes ; i think that 's sufficient proof that he 's interested in you . 
  i had an enfp girlfriend , it 's an amazing experience , but remember that mbti is not definitive and people within a type can be very different between themselves ; it 's also hard to thruthfully cathegorize if a certain action/desicion was taken using a determined cognitive function , if it can be done at all . 
  in my experience , you do need physical proximity to really enjoy -- as opposed to suffer -- a relationship , but you might as well do fine and develop a cute love story ( people loving each other with a tight bond even though they 're thousands of kilometers away are real but scarce ) , there 's not a manual on human relationships . 
  i personally would n't do it in this time of my life , but you 're not me . 
  why do n't you try confessing to your crush on a video call ? 
  the worst thing he could say is that he 's not into you , which is not at all catastophic , thought you might feel like it was for a while . 
  when people ask this question , the first song that pops in my mind is [ `` reg\u00e1lame la silla donde te esper\u00e9 '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3966l3zmf4 ) . 
  it just has a very chill vibe , in my opinion ; i also love the transition from guitar to keyboard to trumpets . 
  the lyrics talk about the nostalgia that one guy in love feels when remembering his love interest and asking her to give him an artsy chair for some reason ( arguably of a memento of the romance that never happened , though it leaves much room for speculation ) . 
  i 'm not even a fan of alejandro sanz , but this one song strikes me . 
  ho-lee shit . 
  i ca n't even ... 
  you 'll pull it off mate . 
  stay strong .
