  hmmm ... have you ever considered moving to another country that is less expensive than the us , say ... mexico ? 
  spanish is not that difficult to learn according to the us government , or you can venture like my fellow countrymen and just come here not knowing spanish ; depending on how dire your situation is . 
  you might have to hurry up though , trump 's building the wall . 
  if i was kept there for ransom by terrorists , i would n't know if i would feel threatened or relaxed . 
  at the jihadi luau there are beautiful `` opressed '' girls who dance hawaiian and arabic dances for double sexiness and are wearing the sterotypical hawaiian miniskirts but having their faces covered with a niqab so the eyes are highlighted for yet more sexiness . 
  men are also really cool but somewhat hotheaded : they will go bonkers if you mention religion or lilo & stitch ( some of them think l&s is absolutely haram and cringey but others think it 's a heartfelt story ; much blood has been spilled over it ) but cool otherwise . 
  they 'll offer you non-alcoholic tropical drinks and they are also the controversial inventors of `` sand surf '' ( the new national sport of oman , which will drop off the world cup to host the desert people 's world tournament of said sport . 
  i heard saudi arabia was becoming very competitive in it , though ) . 
  at the jihadi luau you can listen to music played with ukeleles and plucked flutes playing at the same time . 
  they used to only sing nasheeds but they grew tired of them , so they now have musical diversity . 
  it 's not so bad to be at the jihadi luau . 
  a bit crazy though : you fear for your life at times but then you find yourself singing with them and dancing with the girls , just like in a party ... 
  i love the light distribution on this picture , besides the happy camel !, 
   just a warning , enfps can be prone to boredom , waffling , and basically can never be trusted to be 100 % pleased with their partner . 
  so much this . 
  i do n't know if this is part of the enfp stereotype but my former girlfriend was insatiable fun-wise . 
  i did my best at capitalizing oportunities for larger-than-life romantic gestures but i was n't able to produce them ; i keep in touch with her and she says her new boyfriend does create those chances . 
  i hope she 's doing well . 
  three percent ? 
  whoa . 
  in mexico , the custom is to leave 10 % to the server . 
  i hate it when they include the tip on a receipt , i feel like they 're forcing it on you , i like to be in control of the option to leave a tip or not ( i always do ) . 
  how come 3 % is fucking insane ? 
  i say it 's too little of a tip . 
  godesses are usually portrayed as ridiculously good looking people and i choose to deem that notion as true for ... reasons . 
  so post a picture of yourself to prove it !, 
  i get it now . 
  for a moment , i thoughtr you meant it was insanely high , lol . 
  look at the downvotes , i 'm already incinerated . 
  my mistake , i corrected that now . 
  thanks for pointing that out !, 
  guys , the brigading is so blatant that some of us were even advertising this sub . 
  come on , we 're better than this . 
  til that [ mexico ] ( http://mexdesc.impresionesaerea.netdna-cdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/adaptive/public/fichas-destino/historia-bandera-mexico-actual-2016.jpg?itok=nmnofadp ) is better than [ italy ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dpp8ws9vfzy/u6i3kwvd3vi/aaaaaaaafzc/qykjm-qrttg/s1600/bandera+de+italia.jpg ) . 
  gianna michaels says `` fuck you '' to weather ? 
  that shit looks fun but tropical storms are nothing to fuck around with . 
  she 's ridiculously hot , though . 
  nazi germany is an example of how deranged humans can become : there were genocidal , fanatic , fascist people who enjoyed killing and torturing other people who they considered inferior . 
  but of course , the worst thing that could have happened to the world is to speak a fancy agglutinative language . 
  god , these italians ... could you post pictures of marika fruscio some time ? 
  you shoud check her out . 
  what an awesome round ass . 
  i can see why you got so spanked . 
  however , though i spank my girlfriends a lot , i 've never left them bruised . 
  you can do that just from slapping ? 
  no , the other users did by the grace of your divinity , or they were just trying to please you . 
  fun `` fact '' about islamic peace and timetables : there was an ancient prophecy that said that the redemer would come on the 1st day of muslim year 1400 , so [ a group of terrorists seized the grand mosque ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_mosque_seizure#background ) ; this happened during hajj .

  the bamboo cane explains the bruises . 
  you 're one naughty girl . 
  actually , it is quite popular in mexico and the caribbean . 
  12 megapixels of booty . 
  nice . 
  this is actually a very reasonable post ; maybe `` american voters are asked to do more than citizens of other countries '' sounds hyperbolic at first , but right in context . 
  the hapbsbara is strong with this one . 
  edit : i 'll leave my retarded spelling so the succeeding comment makes sense . 
  they actually have a [ handbook ] ( https://www.sott.net/signs/hasbara.pdf ) , but it seems that op was n't following its guidelines . 
  my first thought . 
  the olympics have been a far cry away from what they were meant to be for decades . 
   was more just being a smart alec, 
  i see what you did there . 
  that would have been swell around the 1500 's . 
  too bad white people did n't stay in their lands . 
  not just that , but despite having a lot of smaller divisions on the european side , russia has huge states like krasnoyarsk and [ sakha ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/f13q0 ) . 
  it also has freaking 92 federative subjects ; while the us has 50 , plus puerto rico and some tiny islands . 
  or like donald trump . 
  altough , to be fair [ he speaks like an eleven year-old ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/03/18/trumps-grammar-in-speeches-just-below-6th-grade-level-study-finds/ ) ; not a four year-old . 
  as much as i love to bash trump , we have to be real here : it would be political sucide nowadays to speak in abraham lincoln 's fashion ; i believe that good speeches must be kept simple and powerful , it 's just that trump overdoes simplicity because he lacks communication skills ( e.g : bing bing-bong bong ; `` bigly '' ) , which makes him sound childish and unprofessional ( not that his voter base cares at all ) . 
  as a mexican , i was in bliss to listen to romney 's speeches : he spoke in a perfectly clear , simple and `` economic '' ( in the sense that he said much with few words ) way ; but that 's just my opinion .

  but come on , alaska is not so problematic , is it ? 
  guys ... we just found the new navy seal copypasta . 
  upvotes are not a testament of intelligence , but of popularity . 
  which is more than enough to prove these dimwits wrong , as angela merkel is the chancellor . 
  and she 's a woman ... 
  just lurking on past stuff , if you feel odd about the late reply . 
  i think that quote was used in sense of [ legal personality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legal_personality ) , not like if he thought of corporations like one thinks about human beings or something like that . 
  but his direct , no-nonesense style killed his campaign with the [ 47 percent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2gvy2wqi7m ) private speech . 
  ah ... back to the time where one comment or opinion was enough to destroy an american politician 's carreer . 
  a time that feels so distant now . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but do n't indians and pakistanis share the same racial background ? 
  pakistan and bangladesh seceded from india to form independent states that house a major religious minority from the former british india . 
  it 's sad to reach the point where a statement is so hyperbolic that people will argue with it 's author not about the human catastrophe that is genocide , but about how it 's reductionist given other political factors . 
  i know you will only flatter my legs , but this post looks like something straight from r/subredditsimulator . 
   welcome to the ~ ~ tribe ~ ~ [ pack ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/intp/comments/3vug0g/hello_yall_i_am_an_isfj_seeking_information_on/cxqywb1?context=3 ) !, 
  if you change i for e the 1st function is swapped for the 2nd , and the 3rd for the 4th . 
  which means your dominant function is ne instead of ti and your third function is fe instead of si . 
  think about the your inferior function : do you have trouble connecting to people or do you seem to defy all that is known just for the sake of contrarianism ? 
  perhaps answering that question could help you determine your type . 
  top kek . 
  no , but it 's quite a hallmark of stereotypical entps , is n't it ? 
  you got ta be kidding me . 
  why not giving a try to [ this ] ( http://www.celebritytypes.com/test.php ) ? 
  scroll down to the bottom to find the differentiating quizes . 
  should n't they have written `` a usa '' instead of `` an usa '' ? 
  granted , the letter `` u '' is a vowel , but in this particular case it sounds like the english consonant `` y '' like in `` you '' ; therefore , should n't it be written as `` a usa '' because of the way it sounds to the reader ? 
  taking into account we 're talking about black people twitter , then yes : i 'm surprised . 
  white people with guns = patriots, 
  black/brown people with guns = thugs/terrorists/rapists, 
  i do n't know how this is sad .
