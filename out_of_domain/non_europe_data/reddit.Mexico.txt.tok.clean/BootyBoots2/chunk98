  i 've noticed you provide steady sas regarding muslims ( 07 ) . 
  are you one of them ? 
  i told you these people wanted to recreate '' [ takedown ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4mt1fdj0he ) '' and '' [ the hornet 's nest ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhpineptn-e ) '' . 
  because -- as america has proven true -- all you need to restore freedom , destroy corruption and spur economic growth is to invade/nuke the county wholesale ( no . 
  japan does n't count as the japanese pulled themselves up ) . 
  holy shit . 
  ok , here it goes ... my great grandmother was born a mexican , but she was a daugther to spanish immigrants ( so technically spanish following ` murican logic ) . 
  she married an austrian man , making my grandmother fully european ( in fact , she has n't set foot on spain ) , racially speaking . 
  that makes my dad 1/4 spanish , 1/4 austrian and 1/2 mexican . 
  which in turn makes me 1/8 spanish , 1/8 austrian and 3/4 mexican ( neglecting the racial ties to yurop on my paternal grandfather 's side or my whole mother 's branch of the family ) . 
  i 'm 100 % mexican and i 'm proud of it .

  to be fair , i think this is a pretty cool and civil display of patriotism . 
  it 's just a guy stopping his activity to respect the anthem , which is reasonable ; it 's not like paramedics will stop their activities to do so . 
  great picture . 
  lol that title may raise some eyebrows , though . 
  aww ... guys , we 've got keisha and karlee , but we 're still missing sasha . 
  i regret nothing . 
  i 'm so handsome , my beauty is only surpassed by that of the empress charlotte herself . 
  if 3000 people died at the wtc attack , i can safely say that you 're decigigaexaggerating the proportions of the catastrophe in case . 
  i have noticed that it 's pretty difficult , if not useless to try to identify others ' types because :, 
  * typing on stereotype is vague and the least rigorous option . 
  * typing on cognitive functions , albeit rigurous is not easy because it requires to have a very conceptual understanding of functions . 
  and even if you do understand the cognitive functions , how will you do that ? 
  will you try to analize an action or pattern and attribute to the use of a certain function ? 
  i 'm not convinced . 
  i have an uncle who is pretty much the personification of the stereotypical istp . 
  when i asked him to answer the 16personalities test , he turned out to be an enfp and when he read the stereotype description he felt very identified with it . 
   are you a moron ? 
  even if your point is correct , there 's no need to be rude . 
   mislabelling others, 
  not so long ago you were very dubious about being introverted or extroverted . 
  perhaps you should know better that typing is difficult , and that mbti is far from perfect . 
  same goes for me . 
  i used to * hate * prom-like parties , but now i enjoy them like there 's no tomorrow because i 've worked internally in order to stop feeling in a negative way and actually enjoying the experience ( that 's what parties are for , after all ) . 
  it 's rewarding , because it allows you to further explore other scenarios or even exploit your strengths in a way that was previously impossible or hidden . 
  perhaps we all have elements of other types , so we `` are '' all of the types at the same time , although there 's one component which is very dominant and that 's the one that mbti returns ; the presence of other types should be weak and mostly neglegible . 
  [ i beg your pardon ? 
  ] ( http://yesionair.com/resources/alicia.jpg ), 
  can we talk about the need for moderation now ? 
  i used to dislike math . 
  having studied an engineering carreer i learned to like math exercises . 
  for me , the thing with them is that they require lots of complex , abstract thinking that could :, 
  * require to grasp mathematical concepts in order to `` be creative '' about the way to solve problems ( and translate those problem into math ! ) . 
  in my experience , this is frustrating because it seems like you are left on your own instead of following precise instructions ( sounds `` j '' i know , but that 's one of my outliers ) . 
  * require to perform a long series of boring basic math ( algebra , arithmetics ) , which are repetitive and tiring . 
  plus , the larger the amount of calculations you have to perform manually , the more likely it is to make a mistake and a single mistake is all that is needed to be incorrect . 
  as you may have noticed , there 's a component that sounds prospecting and another that sounds judging . 
  if your outliers align in a negative way , you may be more propense to dislike math . 
  yet still , the feeling when you perform a long calculation that turns out to be correct is priceless . 
  son 500 billetes de a $ 500 . 
  sorry if i offended you . 
  i just voiced my ignorant perception of the german people ; i read once or twice that being patriotic ( even when not reaching ` murican levels ) is frowned upon there because of wwii , and that there was a large debate discussing patriotism spurred by the 2006 world cup . 
  then again , i 've never gone to germany and the contacts i 've had with germans in real life have been shallow at most . 
  i do n't see how this is sas . 
  imperial british were extremely racist back in the day , i did n't research his point , but it sounds more like a reply out of context than a racial supremacy rant . 
  of course , he accused us of perpetuating this belief through an image on our sliding banner and i now wonder which one is it . 
  damn son ... some hard truths right there . 
  who are your favorite brand of [ insert country/culture ] - americans ? 
  or which ones are the ones that annoy you the most ? 
  i think the irish-americans and the italian-americans are tight on the race to be the most circlejerky of them all . 
  ohhhh , i see !, 
  how dare they to insult our retarded looking patriotic snoo !, 
  just let them in , they 'll get shot by him every time we hover over him to listen to his wisdom . 
  ah ... the worst thing is that these folks get lumped up with mexican revisionists and attribute their negative attitude on the entirety of mexican people . 
  i agree . 
   the only `` buffon '' i know is [ this one ] ( http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/32400000/buffon-season-2012-2013-gianluigi-buffon-32492971-764-1024.jpg ) . 
  well , the goalkeeper is a [ buf\u02c8f\u0254n ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gianluigi_buffon ) and a silly entertainer is called a [ b\u0259fun ] ( http://upodn.com/phon.php ) . 
  i wished i met an esfj female ... my dad and a dear friend of mine are both esfj , but there have been lots of exfp girls in my life , including both of my girlfriends . 
  the word `` wackos '' used that way reminds me of sam the american eagle from `` the muppets '' calling terrorists or foreigners `` weirdos '' . 
  and they 're * still * beyond the stone age . 
  actually , they can just ask for some money to try to rebuild their nation ( which of course , not the us nor russia will pay for ) and get riddled by debt , which may prompt yet another civil uprising . 
  nice job promoting freedom and safety , america .

  how did they manage to record that laughter ? 
  hmmmm i 'm suspicious about the `` cock '' segment . 
  like north korea , they have to recite a pledge of allegiance there ... 
  * were n't * enough ... 
  if they 're going to post genocidal shit on the internet , at least they should worry about their grammar , just to not sound like retarded hicks . 
  amazing what tiny countries with small populations can achieve , huh ? 
  edit : can you hear that ? 
  is this the sound of americans unknowingly calling small european countries `` relevant '' ? 
   this is very flawed reporting of an important issue . 
  they did n't mention the woman from norristown successfully sued the city . 
  as a result they repealed the `` nuisance '' law , and enacted a state law preventing the practice statewide . 
  the law in lancaster was also overturned as a result of bad press related to multiple lawsuits . 
  obviously direct civil action is effective so why not mention that ?

  ok , i did n't understand this post at all . 
  somebody care to explain ?
