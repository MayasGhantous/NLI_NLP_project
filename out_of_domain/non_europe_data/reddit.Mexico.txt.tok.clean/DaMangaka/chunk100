  kim stared at the screen , her twin brother peering from behind . 
  she had an expressionless face , her eyes only moving when needed , flickering the information with her fingers on the holoscreen . 
  `` well , you 'll be surprised at this one jean , '' after some 10 minutes , the korean girl turned towards the captain , playing with the ring on her finger . 
  `` and i think you will not find it pretty at all . '', 
  takashi sighed , not really in the mood . 
  the captain felt his shoulders stiff and had barely slept in the last 2 days or so . 
  they had been tracking the bogey for almost a month and when they crept closer , it simply vanished . 
  `` what is it ? 
  did you find out what it was ? '', 
  kim 2 - the twin brother - had suggested a possible glitch on the system but his sister had scoffed him away . 
  takashi just wanted an answer soon , even if it meant having to engage into * another * time travel adventure with a dead end . 
  `` this is just strange in overall . '', 
  kim 1 began to explain , turning to the screen and flickering the time tree upwards so it projected the full image in three dimensions . 
  `` all of these events here , '' she pointed to the ` branches ' of the tree . 
  `` are independent regardless of what we do or not . 
  in other words , we really do n't care . 
  except for this one of course . '', 
  she pointed to a small ` leaf ' of a branch . 
  the name and information of jean ` takashi ' coming up in japanese . 
  takashi nodded , crossing his arms and listening carefully . 
  `` but all of these events have the peculiarity of coming from one strange trunk . '', 
  she slid her finger towards said part which to the captain 's surprise did n't seem to have roots . 
  any origin , any information beyond that was missing or inaccessible . 
  `` that computer is bugged . '', 
  the male kim grinned amused , cybernetic arms on the back of his head . 
  `` if anything , it is * you * who are bugged , brother dear . '', 
  she replied in her home language . 
  `` i can do the boogie . '', 
  `` jong hye , '' takashi interrupted . 
  `` can you tell me what this means ? '', 
  `` did n't i just say what it means ? '', 
  joon suk walked towards the captain . 
  his face showed amusement . 
  he poked the japanese on the cheek . 
  `` the computer is old . 
  i do n't think it can follow up with chronos ' database at all . 
  i 've been working on it and all , you know ? '', 
  `` which might explain why it is useless . '', 
  his sister chimed in . 
  `` it 's a work in progress . 
  ca n't say i can make miracles in a day . '', 
  he walked towards one of the panels on the computer , patting it softly . 
  `` these things are what ? 
  20 years old ? 
  `` in any regard , '' she stared at her brother with a scornful face . 
  `` the data i have here was delivered by angela herself . 
  this is from mainframe chronos at the tsp . '', 
  `` so even if it 's from source , it ca n't track it before this particular event ? '', 
  takashi tilted his head . 
  more like it wo n't allow access . 
  i 'm pretty sure miss - or mister depending on how she 's screwing you around - angela can hack into the system and get more information but i do n't believe blowing her cover would be wise . '', 
  `` aw , but it sounds fun , does n't it ? '', 
  joon suk chuckled . 
  `` it is in my conclusion , '' the female kim stared once more at the time tree , signaling for the empty spot after the trunk . 
  `` that what ever chronos wants you to investigate is exactly what it 's trying to limit access to . '', 
  `` huh ?! '', 
  the captain stared at confused . 
  `` well , that 's odd . '', 
  joon suk scratched his head . 
  `` chronos can decide ? 
  it is * sentient * ? '', 
  `` according to the time and space patrol 's own lore , chronos is a very advanced ai that helps the organization with it 's time traveling deeds . '',
