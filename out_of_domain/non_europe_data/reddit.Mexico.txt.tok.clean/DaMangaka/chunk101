  jong hye turned to them , explaining . 
  the holographic time tree flickered off , returning to be nothing more than an image on the 2d panels . 
  `` an ai can achieve a level of consciousness to commit it 's task . '', 
  `` why would it want me to go there ? '', 
  takashi tried to think on the manner . 
  he was already tied to this whole mystery by having discovered that he was a product of a time paradox , the worst of the offenses the tsp punished , and now it seemed that chronos was eager to have him help him with something . 
  something that angela was * also * involved in as the time hacker . 
  he let his thoughts cast a shell around his mind , ignoring his surroundings and the explanation jong hye was starting to give about the way the tsp 's infrastructure worked with chronos . 
  the blip they had been chasing for a earthen month ( mt in french ) came on and off the same time tree as if inviting to be given chase only to disappear back into nothingness . 
  it was at that moment that the captain realized something : the possibility that chronos had been monitoring him even as a young lad . 
  the possibility that his father had realized it and that being the reason why he was taken out from the timeline . 
  what if - out of all the possibilities - chronos was not inviting him to investigate more in the matter , but his * father * . 
  there had been clues since day one at the tsp , and the crew he had gathered seemed to have the abilities he needed to crack the case . 
  it was at some point , too perfect . 
  what was going on ? 
  what laid behind that barrier chronos had erected onto the information , he now seemed obligated to discover it 's truths . 
  the paradox of his life . 
  `` when 's the closest you can put me on ? '', 
  takashi asked suddenly , interrupting the female kim 's explanation . 
  she blinked , staring at him before turning towards the screen , searching as quick as she could . 
  small holographic screens began to pop out around her as she worked , her fingers touching one side and another , displaying results on the one in the middle . 
  `` according to this , that would have to be january 28 2256 at 5:40 am . '', 
  `` well , that 's . 
  very precise . '', 
  the brother remarked . 
  `` well , of * course * it 's precise !, 
  this is time travel we are talking about ! '', 
  she glared at him . 
  `` we ca n't just throw him onto a random spot in time , can we ? '', 
  `` x/z coordinates ? '', 
  takashi inquired . 
  `` i 'm on that already , give me some slack yourself . '', 
  jong hye growled , returning to the screen . 
  the screens around her merged to become one large 3d map . 
  `` there . 
  x is @ 35.6984 \u00b0 n , 139.7722 \u00b0 e , z is @ 5hrs 40m 23s direction se on p. '', 
  `` wait a moment , '' the captain frowned , approaching the map to see it for himself . 
  the landscape was of a ruined city , overshadowed by a much brighter one on top of it . 
  a specific scenario he had only seen back at home at a well known spot in his country . 
  he pushed away the floating city above the ruins and inspected it further . 
  there were legends of that area and by his time it had returned to a nicer shine . 
  but these were laid off ruins , neglected and shoved away . 
  signs of once bright luminous banners adorning the buildings were all that were left for the imagination . 
  the rest was rubble and electronic trash everywhere . 
  few scatterers recovering what they could . 
  `` this , '' he rotated the image once more . 
  `` this is akihabara . '', 
  `` huh ? '', 
  joon suk stared at the image . 
  `` what about it ? '', 
  `` the electronic city in japan ? 
  was n't it completely destroyed during the cyber wars ? '', 
  jong hye approached him . 
  why on earth would this be the last stop ? 
  was n't this the day when said war had finally ended ? 
  i 'm at work . 
  does this mean i have to stare at you ? 
  i think i can . 
  it was kind of odd you know ? 
  i knew i liked girls too but really did n't knew how broad of the spectrum was until i dated a mtf and i was ok with it . 
  i then realized that i was practically genderblind and i was more on people 's ways of being than what they looked physically . 
  of course , i appreciate a good body but it 's regardless of gender . 
  the though part was trying to explain my mum when i came out to her on national coming out day . 
  i do n't think she still understands and kind of hopes it 's just me ` picking ' to be like this but . . oh well . 
  at least we are still bickering as normal . 
  the rest of my family does n't know , though . 
  she loves me regardless . 
  i just wish she understood fully about this matter . 
  . not that . 
  she understands me more on other manners so . . 
  i guess it 's ok = v = ; ; ;, 
  it 's taking quite a while to make the internet better . 
  we are currently installing fiber optics over here . 
  running some tests . 
  also , solving the issue on regards servers an electricity . 
  do n't worry . 
  i 'm here . 
  his boots clanked on the metallic surface above chronos ' core . 
  it hummed softly , an ominous sound escaping from the opened gate . 
  renault glared at his former ally , blood trickling down his forehead . 
  he was still in a state of disbelief but more than anything he was angry that it * was * real . 
  tina laid behind him , unconscious . 
  the rose made of that strange metal still laid clutched on her hand . 
  `` why ? '', 
  the alto captaine slowly rose from his crouched position , glaring at the one who was responsible for their deaths , for their demise . 
  half of his team was down , many had decided to leave for a reason of another . 
  `` why did n't . 
  `` oh hoh , you wonder why ? '', 
  salvatore scoffed , crossing his arms and shaking his head . 
  `` believe me , it is precisely for these reasons alone that i should have killed you when i had the chance . '', 
  he began to play with his auburn hair . 
  `` you meddle too much in affairs that are n't meant to be poked on . 
  the idea was for me to have miss jakobsson here to open me the gates to chronos . 
  i really expected you * not * to come but i was sad that indeed you are that predictable . 
  if only you did n't think too much with your crotch , jacques . 
  it seems you are still weak to the begging of any pretty lady you find your way . '', 
  renault reached to his gun , holstered on his right side . 
  he gritted his teeth . 
  `` ah , ah , ah '' the italian wagged his finger . 
  `` i would n't do that if i where you , capitano .
