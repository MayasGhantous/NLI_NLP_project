  it would be unwise to set this whole facility into a turmoil , would n't it ? '', 
  `` what ?! '', 
  the french growled , keeping his hand on the gun . 
  `` what do you mean ?! '', 
  `` this place is sacred . 
  it is the pinnacle of humanity 's achievements stored in an artificial intelligence that can fit the closest description to god . 
  it lurks and watches upon us all , recording data to make sure the time frame stays pure and without tamper . 
  of course , the only exception is ironically the room it is laid upon . '', 
  salvatore extended his hands , letting him see the vastness of his assertions . 
  `` imagine if , by the flicker of your hand , you would end all of this . 
  you would sacrifice the greatness and powers that chronos has to offer for the life of another expendable girl ? 
  who are you ? 
  you who would flirt with them in your youth until you finally settled down with that japanese girl from who knows where . 
  it is ridiculous , stupid . 
  `` so that 's what they are ? 
  expendable ? 
  is that what your sister was too ? '', 
  renault replied coldly , standing at him in defiance . 
  the italian shook his head . 
  his expression became cold suddenly . 
  `` see , this is what happens when somebody meddles in somebody else 's affairs . 
  i suppose that now shall be the perfect time for me to teach you just * why * you should stop being such a meddling rat , delacroix ! '', 
  yes , please make texas the next one, 
  i 'm sad as a ipod touch gen 3 user that i ca n't use it . 
  well , if you want to be * very * optimistic , look how the anti-abortion bill did n't pass . 
  according to my so , there are many areas in texas which are pro-lgtb , specifically austin . 
  so , who knows . 
  maybe can become ` yes ' . 
  yeah , the ones i listed are the ones i found in amazon.jp . 
  it ca n't wait to see the movie and see if the soundtrack 's epic enough to buy . 
  the zimmerman telegram everyone is talking about actually comes from wwi . . but they * also * asked for help ( more like resources ) in wwii . 
  we went like `` sure , no problem . 
  just do n't involve me in war and stuff , k ? '', 
  guess who got us in ? 
  ^ the ^ answer ^ is ^ the ^ us, 
  yes , and you selling the country to foreign powers - specifically the us - is totally acceptable . 
  salinas would be proud of such shit ... 
  hemo - honestamente , en mi opinion . 
  \\* se esconde detras del sofa \\*, 
  yes and no . 
  there are sources that the torpedoing was n't exactly the germans , more like people * looking * like germans . 
  that 's one rumor , i need to investigate . 
  regardless of it , after the bombing , we kind of accepted the first invitation from the us to join them in war . 
  . really did n't do much ( other than send the 201 squadron to asia ) and continued to provide oil to the axis powers while nazi propaganda was allowed to circulate , likewise any other kind of propaganda . 
  we were friends with the us but allies with all . 
  neutrality at best . 
  that and . 
  . we * really * never wanted to be involved at all : /, 
  that sounds like the spanish pronunciation of `` platano '' , which is banana in english . 
  professor banana .

  does anybody remember that act of defiance in [ mexico 's summer olympics of 1968 ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_olympics_black_power_salute ), 
  why not do something like that on these winter olympics ? 
  make them the gayest they 've ever been : p, 
  i know . 
  we go all over it every october the 2nd ... 
  not like they really * remember * it and just go with the meme and marches and all . 
  the symbolism was lost a long time ago - _ - ;, 
  . ah , my people . 
  when will they wake up < / random rant , 
  the point was to do an act of defiance on the olympics . 
  bless your fairy-type soul ; ; v ; ; < 3, 
  man , and i thought they 'd ran out of x/y/z / 3d / plane puns . 
  guess they are more creative than one would grant them for . 
  i read that too . 
  that was just fucking epic xd ;, 
  those ticket stubs . . . 
  i want them + n + < 3, 
  i wanted to go but my foot is still healing : (, 
  sounds like it was fun, 
  op will * sure * deliver : p, 
  first doma repealed in the us , now this news in the uk . 
  here hopeful towards a better and happier world . 
  cheers , my uk friends = v =, 
  i raise my glass of water to you . 
  inui pursed her lips . 
  under the strong sun of the sahara , the idea that the blond ` witch in training ' in front of her wanted to eat waffles was ridiculous . 
  the whole idea of her quest was ridiculous , now that she thought of it . 
  kumiko stood up , cleaning the dates that had fallen off a nearby tree . 
  they looked so fresh , despite the weather and despite her constantly reminded sun burn . 
  if only there was a special meal to prevent such things . 
  aloe vera would be a blessing . 
  `` yes !, 
  they are nutritious and quite good at breakfast . 
  the best ones - they say - are the ones from belgium , but they could be better . '', 
  those waffles in front of here were a mirage - inuit thought - though to have both girls seeing them must mean that it might not be so . 
  who brings waffles into the desert ? 
  `` there is n't anything in the maps my people handle that speak of this place you call belhiam '' the tall moroccan lass stood herself staring at what she still believed to be a mirage . 
  there was really no explanation . 
  stranded in the middle of nowhere , looking for some strain or mythical fruit with no more supplies . 
  suddenly an uncharted oasis . . . with those ` uaphls ' . 
  something did n't quite match . 
  kumiko 's mouth was watering . 
  she was fed up of the natural desert fruits - such as the date she held on her hand - and wanted something closer to home . 
  to think that to create what was called the ` philosopher 's stone ' of magical cuisine , she had to travel all the way to the desert . 
  understandable , but still a bit bizarre . 
  `` well , if you are not getting them , i sure will ! '', 
  kumiko announced , raising her hand , energy restored with excitement . 
  inui was against the idea and was about to comment on it when she saw the blond girl run towards the batch of baked sweets .
