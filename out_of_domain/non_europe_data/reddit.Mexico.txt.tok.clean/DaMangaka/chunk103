  she jumped over them as if they were some sort of wild animal needing to be fought upon and began to gnaw onto her prize . 
  inui pondering for a moment what was really the difference between her own race and the so called ` civilized ' english . 
  kumiko kept munching on the sweet soft concoction in her mouth . 
  the date-flavored syrup and slices of said fruit just made it even sweeter and perfect . 
  a rare treasure . 
  perhaps that 's what she was meant to find ? . 
  just before the moroccan decided to move forward , restrained desire pointed out by her rumbling stomach , he froze in her place when she noted a shadow on top of the date tree above the blonde . 
  the leaves and the sun made an excellent work on obscuring the figure 's face , and furthermore the cloak it held on it 's hands . 
  `` watch out ! '', 
  inui scram at the english witch , reaching out to her not before she was pulled back by another hand . 
  kumiko took time to notice the whole scenario but by that time it was too late : a shrouded figure that had skillfully restrained a struggling inui from behind , followed up by some more emerging from the short bushes . 
  it all turned black as a heavy coat fell down on her . 
  she cried out , both for herself and her friend as she fell her weight shift by the figures in an attempt to bag and carry her . 
  she should have seen it coming from far - kuru kuru would have pecked her by now - but it was worth it at least . 
  for now , she had to find out what to do for the next course . 
  as somebody who has been participating in a lot of reddit exchanges , it is much cheaper and easier in usps . 
  as an example , [ i 'd like you to see this last gift i sent ] ( http://redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/reddit-gold-and-elf-gifting/ ), 
  i 'm not unhappy really , but i can get really frustrated . 
  right now , i am working a job that barely gives me any money and i have plans to build a business and move out but with 120 usd a week as pay , i do n't know how long it will take or how hard it can be . 
  also , there 's the matter that i wish to rescue my so from where she is , but that 's why the house and the business comes in . 
  i want to have economical stability and well . 
  yeah . 
  i also . 
  kind of wish i had irl friends to hang out with but . 
  they might not really like me that much . 
  there 's also the fact that they introduced a new type to balance the whole pool too . 
  it 's the hacker-type . 
  i remember how hyped i was with bradley and now that they 've announced this type and the legendaries assange and snowden , i do n't know if these teams can even stand a chance . 
  the game is n't out yet , but the fact that putin ( an ice/spy type ) can tackle snowden rather easily , makes me think there is still a lot to be showcased .

  i would love to get my hands on it . 
  i really do n't want it for the phone service - i do n't have one nor the one i wish to give it to - but it would be a good replacement for my so 's broken ipod . 
  the home button is destroyed and it 's all cracked over and she does n't have any funds to repair/replace it . 
  it would be really awesome to get her a replacement .
