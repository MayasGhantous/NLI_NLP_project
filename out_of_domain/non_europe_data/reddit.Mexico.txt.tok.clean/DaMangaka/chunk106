  100 percent effective . 
  100 percent strong against the same poisons i sell to * your * own people . 
  they are simply killing themselves slowly and * paying * for both the disease and the cure !, 
  what a deal !, 
  what a deal !, 
  it 's a complete steal !, 
  see , there are far better ways to control the world , mr. 
  bond . 
  and as you might be well aware now , it only takes one itty bitty piece to change it . 
  now , shall we begin with our session . 
  \\* high five *, 
  though , i do need to move out already ... : /, 
  likewise i 'm a woman . 
  but i earn less than 150 usd per week , not enough to move out and live comfortably : /, 
  that 's why i want to make a business . 
  maybe we can party together . 
  i tend to eat alone on my birthdays ever since i was 15 . 
  oddly enough , this was * not * one of the things i knew i was going to do when i grew up . 
  my parents are used to wake up at 6 am to do stuff . 
  whether it is work or some house work . 
  so , i grew with the idea that waking up at 8pm was * fucking late * . 
  i still try to sleep in on weekends but then i get this stare from both as if i had raped somebody or stolen a bank . 
  this is why i no longer eat breakfast with them . 
  i 'd finally have somebody to play smash brothers with . 
  a poster ? 
  i wanted a small figurine . 
  fffffffffffffffffffffffff -, 
  i preordered * both * games exactly for that . 
  i got my ho-oh figurine but `` nope , we ran out of lugias '', 
  i was all heartbroken , i wanted to say ` nope ' to the game just because of that . 
  ~ ~ well , itdidgetstolenanyways ... ~ ~, 
  . are we like . 
  . long lost siblings or something ? 
  they had recently switched from analogue signal to digital ( hdtv ) here in my city . 
  they announced they 'd be doing that 2 years before . 
  when it occurred , there were protests that were reported not only locally but * nationally * . 
  it was shameful because these people could n't `` lay down and watch the evening novela '' and the politicians rode that horse as to have it pull back longer since their propaganda ( political ads ) could not be aired . 
  it became a clusterfuck from nothing , really . 
  who cares ? 
  why do you even watch shit tv people ? 
  really embarrassed by that . 
  not from a movie , but if we are having a vampire fest , let 's toss alucard in it too . 
  i have to cross the border ; n ; it 's not that easy . 
  i have n't been able to do anything at all unfortunately . 
  my foot got twisted and thus was pretty much stranded in bed . 
  still need some rest . 
  i would have loved to help you though , i 'm sorry it could n't happen . 
  if it makes you happy , i earn $ 2.23 an hour . 
  i work 10 hrs a day . 
  go ahead and do the math . 
  ladies and gentlemen , i present you the manufacturing industry in mexico . 
  people that do the actual manufacturing win around 800 pesos a week . 
  that 's around 65 usd a week , 1.35 usd an hour and many try to get overtime to get a bit more of cash . 
  if you think that 's bad , the minimum wage in the north of the country is 7.30 pesos , in the south , it can go down to 5 . 
  but , we got ta do what we hafta do . 
  i 'm a graphic designer assistant . 
  basically , what i do is make cad drawings for custom spa covers . 
  drawings that are so ridiculously simple , i could do them on paint . 
  i also graduated from a prestigious university in my city . 
  fuck that crap . 
  it is n't in my country , sadly . 
  and to be honest , that 's above the minimum wage . 
  see one of the threads i 've posted here . 
  my country is mexico , btw . 
  it 's enjoyable really . 
  lots of good stuff . 
  but it 's these things that overshadow it . 
  if you want more details about it , the company i 'm working on is * american owned * . 
  as somebody that frequents cracked , this is high quality material there . 
  is there a way you can submit it ? 
  i 'll wave pon-pons at you : d, 
  you mean margaritas . 
  considering nafta , he 's a bottom . 
  a very sexy bottom . 
  veracruz is bigger than florida . 
  just sayin ' ... 
  \\* stands up and claps \\*, 
  wow . 
  witty reply that will be granted gold and will then be edited to show gratitude, 
  talk to the finns . 
  they 'd the the perfect kind of people for the job . 
  out of topic but . 
  i love your flair : p, 
  more like [ snipers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simo_h%c3%a4yh%c3%a4 ), 
  \\* peeeeeeek \\*, 
  hello there . 
  i would like to have prime . 
  \\* vanishes \\*, 
   there is a flying type move called wind shift that dispels all weather effects . 
  you weather abusers are going down !, 
  . tempting but i need to settle my finances . 
  i 'll probably end up buying it the day before x & y. 
  i just * hope * they do release at least one of their special editions . 
  yes , but to have an attack that does so is different . 
  sure , you can summon sunny day or rain dance but , what if you just want any of them to stop ? 
  this is good . 
  not all pokemon have it . 
  if i recall , only psyduck/golduck have it , the other 4 in dream world . 
  and i do n't think any of them are good with it : /, 
  my father had told me many times about this event but never thought i 'd see something about it .
