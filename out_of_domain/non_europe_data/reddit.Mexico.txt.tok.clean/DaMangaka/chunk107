  all i knew was that it was in san ysidro and they demolished the mcdonalds . 
  this is , while morbid , part of the history of the city . 
  i do n't know how my city reacted to it , though . 
  ( i live crossing the border ) . 
  my goddesses !, 
  it ** is ** a muse reference ?!, 
  you are now awesome in my book . 
  that is awesome . 
  i 'd like to learn how to do that sort of thing . 
  i like coldplay too but , thanks to the abridged series , [ all i can think of them is this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu0l4hcuivq&amp;t=1m19s ), 
  i thought i was the only one who called their pokemon as with their japanese names : d, 
  i actually said something like that in a thread like these . 
  let 's not boycot the games , let 's just make them the gayest of games ever . 
  it 'll be fabulous !, 
  not to mention that , despite the fact that you can only perform them in those 3 states and the capital , mexico recognizes any marriage nationwide . 
  if you got married in netherlands , for example , your marriage is legal in mexico . 
  so far , though , the only state that has banned gay marriage is jalisco , despite the fact that guadalajara is know to be one of the biggest hubs for the lgbt community . 
  just throwing more info here . 
  as somebody from baja california , you 'll love soca . 
  lots of things to do and see, 
  i propose any song from `` priscilla , queen of the desert '' to be used for these purposes . 
  i , da mangaka , offer my services to create a manga out of this . 
  much like having sex outside of marriage . 
  the point is that for the church , sex without procreation or outside ` the law ' is a sin . 
  everything is a sin for them anyways : /, 
   es una creencia popular en estados unidos, 
  i love volunteering , though it has mostly been for cons . 
  the ones i 've done are a con in tijuana ( tijuana innovadora ) and of course , comic-con . 
  thing is that right now , i 'm thinking on volunteering on another type of events - though i have done some humanitarian help before , such as a fundraiser for a retirement home , occupy movements and greenpeace donations . 
  i have been eyeing becoming a volunteer at the hrc 's branch in san diego . 
  it seems like a good way to meet new people , though i 'm not sure considering where i live and what limitations i might get . 
  good to see you have received lots of benefits . 
  makes me jealous you managed to get to see muse too : p, 
  ** age : ** 46, 
  ** gender : ** male, 
  ** vocation : ** none really . 
  however , the cyberians see him as the key to achieve salvation . 
  ** physical description : ** he 's a tall , bulky character with defined muscles . 
  his face barely holds any expression and if it does it is usually of annoyance or bitterness . 
  his hair is dark blue and it is long enough to be held by a petty lower ponytail . 
  his eyes has visible dark marks underneath . 
  his eye color is blue blue though his left eye can sometimes change into some sort of red-hot orb . 
  ** personality quirks : ** he does n't seem to be able to see very well or at all using his left eye though it moves naturally despite it probably not being an eye at all . 
  the only live descendant of the ` black chaos ' , ichimura is able to display her same powers . 
  mainly , the ability of absorbing projectile attacks and returning them , as well as to eject and control a form of energy that is highly radioactive . 
  this last bit can also be the cause of his slowly yet noticeable decay in health , despite the fact it also helps to boost his strength . 
  just before the * cyber wars * began , he was put in on stasis to be awaken 200 years later when the war was in full fight . 
  he refuses to accomplish ` his destiny ' , despite there being signals by the own goddess of machines to go and do so . 
  a lonesome character who prefers only the company of few , with the interesting quirk of being a former attorney at law . 
  i made an account only to post this, 
  edit : reddit gold ?!, 
  thanks so much kind stranger . 
  ~ ~ i wish i was unbanned from there ... ~ ~, 
  the more you know . 
  sort of a variation of `` he grew up '' . 
  we were very close friends , and even lived next door of each other . 
  we were both shy and not too prone to make friends outside so to find ourselves as friends was awesome . 
  he was short tempered - is actually - and i would help him try to chill out when he lost at mario kart 64 or ssb . 
  it was cool . 
  i could say i enjoyed playing nintendo at his house and make legos . 
  we would make the most awesome stories and adventures . 
  many of the stories i have are derived from what we made while playing . 
  soon , i discovered the internet . 
  i became a bit more informed on world-wide events and started to learn more things . 
  due to school and other things , i barely could see him as much . 
  he also got himself some new friends which he would play halo on his xbox so i found it cool . 
  the thing was that he was also changing for the worse , and the friends he had made did not make or give him any positive influence . 
  i suppose he became a honchkrow , if you can understand my interpretation . 
  soon , as the whole yu-gi-oh craze hit , we began to hang out again but i noticed the changes to the point my father did to and forbade me to hang with him anymore . 
  i did n't understand why , for he was a close friend , until i began to see what he had become . 
  he became a misogynist , a thief - he stole quite the pile of my ygo deck - a liar , homophobe racist idiot . 
  worst is that since he became the leader of that pack ( a pack of kids that were a bit younger than him actually ) , he made them even more . 
  close to delinquents even . 
  i had heard stories of how these guys would go around trashing a poor hamburger stand for the lulz , steal from some family owned grocery stores and even use some illegal substances . 
  it was such a shock . 
  i just could n't believe it . 
  in the end , though , they moved out and so did i. 
  he was n't really fat to begin with , but as his diet - his family were fans of take out and pre-cooked meals - and lack of wanting to do anything but to be in the computer or playing his xbox went out , he became morbidly obese . 
  he graduated as a film maker ( thing ? ), 
  but really . 
  i do n't even care about him anymore . 
  there were rumors about me spread by his group about me being a lesbian ( . 
  . kind of . 
  . . true really , i 'm actually pan ) but in a derogatory and cruel way . 
  i heard from one of his ` associates ' which i found out in an art class - and was really meek . 
  the kind of guy who joins a bunch because he does n't want to be alone . 
  - of how i had joined the ` dark side ' . 
  dark side my ass . 
  i negated that - really i was n't going to come out yet , do n't think i can really - but it just hurt me that he could think of it so . 
  and this is the story of how one of my friends simply died for me . 
  i really wish you did n't get caught by this twisted world , mike . 
  after being one month out of the gym due to my foot injury , i am back in the game baby !, 
  i started to go to the gym . 
  . and now i 'm all full of ouchies . 
  man , it * does * feel stingy when you start doing your regular routine when you have been out for a while . 
  not to mention that it seems i need to get balanced on my back and hips . 
  still , it 's good to be back . 
  i 'm also drawing more than before , which is awesome . 
  i hope to finish this zelda poster soon = v = b, 
  and here i am hoping that it is true .
