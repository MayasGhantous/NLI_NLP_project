  reminds me of the walking fish from gyo ... 
  thanks so much for reminding me . 
  not to mention that now i am committed to loosing weight and decided to go 2 hours to the gym . 
  my body feels like a truck hit me really hard . 
  and i only walked and lifted some weights, 
  i want you to critique what is so far my best wp in here . 
  [ from this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/writingprompts/comments/1g9vc3/wp_lost_life/ ), 
  `` he was . 
  . fragile . '', 
  i began , cautiously thinking my words . 
  rethinking on the last moments we shared . 
  it felt awkward to comment it , even to svi , but she would understand . 
  she knew me and i never hid anything from her . 
  the whole thought of her expression gave me a sense of amusement . 
  i 'm sure he 'd be both amused and embarrassed by it too . 
  i pictured his face . 
  i had to admit , he looked cute . 
  `` i noticed it when we were dragging our derrieres across that wasteland we fell into . 
  it was hot and our suits did n't exactly help with that , you know ? 
  along the way we started to shed it off : first the shoulder plates , the leg guards ... 
  in the end , we just ended up with the our basic uniform . '', 
  `` i 'm surprised you did n't run naked in the dunes . '', 
  svi grinned at me . 
  i then gave her one of my own and her face went from amusement to surprise . 
  `` wait . 
  do n't tell me you actually * did * ? '', 
  `` sort of . '', 
  i chuckled . 
  `` it was n't just any of my usual workings however . '', 
  i began to retell her about yves ' last moments . 
  how despite my efforts to find a place to cover ourselves from the sandstorms that hellish planet had to offer us , there was n't a single rock or cave to hide in . 
  it was getting hard to see , hard to breathe and that did certainly not help his punctured abdomen at all . 
  perhaps the sand aided as a way to clog his wound with something else but there was no way i could treat him under such conditions . 
  after hours of struggles to keep ourselves from drowning in sand and noticing how getting rid of our helmets was perhaps a * very * bad idea , night fell and with it the rage of the dunes . 
  we sat down , had a chat about life and i went to check his wound . 
  by that time , it had become infected . 
  our supplies burned with our aircraft . 
  we were alone in god knows where , bare handed . 
  i tried to liven up the situation but yves did n't really needed to . 
  he was smiling all the time , even though the pain and mental effort to keep himself awake was taking a toll on him . 
  i reminded myself of a lesson fireheart had told me long before i decided to embark into the path of the haute captaine : the harshest and most painful knowledge is that one of your jobs is to keep the timeline clean but when encountering difficult choices , you might begin to have second thoughts about it . 
  to be able to travel through time , it is both an amazing adventure and a curse . 
  even if i wanted to , or could , i could n't bring him back . 
  i could n't go back and tell myself ` do n't do it ' or ` do it this other way if you do n't want to loose your best friend in the worse manner possible ' . 
  you could , but you know you ca n't . 
  it 's a hard realization . 
  no matter how much power , you ca n't change the past . 
  it does n't work that way . 
  i remember yves turning to me , wheezing , with the realization that perhaps one of us was n't really going to make it . 
  his smile turned much gentler than usual , placing his right hand on my lap and rubbing my knee . 
  `` you * do * know i do n't swing that way . '', 
  i chuckled . 
  `` it 'll be our secret , if you let me . '', 
  it was a bizarre idea , one which svi began to make a wry smile when she started connecting the dots . 
  yves had never actually done something on that manner - which i used to pick on telling that swiss never ever got laid and all about them doing so were lies - and even as a child he had confessed his ` true irrefutable love ' towards me . 
  my father was n't a 21st century conservative politician , but he was n't into letting this 6 year old kid chase me around school trying to kiss me . 
  i remember him sitting me by his side and tell me not to let that kid 's mind loose on the matter . 
  it was then when i learned that i could also swoon boys . 
  but i never had any interest on the matter . 
  `` you ca n't tell me . 
  svi sighed , shaking her head in disbelief , trying not to either chuckle or laugh too loud . 
  that you granted jean yves rousseau his most treasured wish . 
  really . 
  how ? '', 
  `` i have to admit that maybe i was n't sound mentally , but also there was this part of me that just said ` sure , why not grant this dying man his wish ? ' '', 
  i then proceeded to tell her the rather hilarious tale of how i had to take off his clothing - with him protesting in a meek voice that ` it was n't what he expected in his first time ' and me shutting him down with an irked ` well , i 've never fucked a man . 
  give me some credit ! . ', 
  - take my own while i watched over so he did n't die on me before and have him * mount * me . 
  me , the one who has fame in the tsp for ` knowing ' much of the lady staff ... 
  sverige could n't stop laughing . 
  `` but you know what ? '', 
  i spoke again once her laughter quieted down . 
  `` it was very different from what i expected . '', 
  `` what ? 
  you having yves grind you while he was * dying * ? 
  as it was n't strange enough . 
  you were doing borderline necrophilia there . '', 
  i chuckled and shook my head . 
  looking down at the gravestone under us , i spoke again . 
  `` it is true that i have done strange things . 
  heck , i 've lost count of my sexual escapades and with whom . 
  but that brief time with yves was the first time i had actually dedicated myself to give somebody else pleasure . 
  it was n't just for a `` how many i can fuck ? '', 
  count , or to feel good about myself . 
  this was the first time i gave myself to somebody other than myself . 
  and you know what ? 
  despite the strangeness of it all , it felt good . '', 
  he tried so hard to keep up and after just 10 minutes or a bit less of going in , it was hard * not * to notice his jagged breaths and his overall weakness . 
  i made him stop in his feeble trusting and had him lay on my chest instead . 
  he was apologetic about how he had been a bad partner but i just assured him it was all right while i kissed his head . 
  all he wanted was that moment . 
  the act itself was part of it . 
  thinking about it further , i 'm surprised he made it up to late in the night . 
  i clothed him up , clothed myself up , tended his wound once more - it was hard not to get disgusted by the bile-like goo stuck in there - and had him set his head on my lap . 
  `` this is how i dreamed it 'd be like . '', 
  his voice was very quiet by that point and i 'm sure the soft trembling was not due the cold misty weather it fell upon us . 
  `` even that sad attempt at sex ? '', 
  he nodded `` exactly as i envisioned it . 
  thank you for giving me that chance to experience it . '', 
  i was probably so entranced by my tale that i had not noticed my own tears .
