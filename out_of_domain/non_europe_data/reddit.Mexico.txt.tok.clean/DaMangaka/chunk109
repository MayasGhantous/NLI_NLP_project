  i sighed . 
  `` he died while he slept . 
  i was n't sure what to do at the time . 
  the signal was sent from the very moment we crashed but nobody showed up until it was too late . 
  all the time , i kept him by my side and kept petting him , singing softly at him . 
  i do n't know if it was my mind at denial but i swear i could hear his mousey-like squeaks when he enjoys something . '',

  we stared down at the grave again . 
  a single rose laid on the ground . 
  yves , my friend . 
  the one who , without knowing it , had thought me to love . 
  may the alps be a guardian of that heart of gold of yours .

  just so you know , we do n't even have the budget for living . 
  less to have a war . 
  ~ ~ unless it 's against ourselves ~ ~, 
  i appreciate greatly these comments . 
  english is n't my first language and sometimes i write as i think it around , but that means that it might come structured similar to how i 'd do it in spanish . 
  more-less . 
  i 'll await the next critique thread and keep posting . 
  i think i can get better : ), 
  the time and space patrol ( aka * patruille du temps et l'espace ) is a story i 've been writing since i was in 8th grade . 
  if it looks a bit cut out it 's because it 's a small bit of the story and not the whole . 
  to be honest ~ ~ and here goes some spoilers ~ ~ the main character of the series is jacques ' son . 
  this story is practically a prequel to the main series and an explanation of what happened to his father ( which is in essence the main plot or motivation of the character ) . 
  the tsp also attends space , which in this case is what was mentioned as both characters fell down to an isolated barren planet . 
  this would motivate the survivor to stick just to time travel missions instead of tending also space missions as an ` alto ' should do . 
  maybe my problem relies on the fact that i write down prompts from stories i already have and thus look incomplete . 
  i do n't know . 
  it 's the letter sch if i remember correctly . 
  before anybody starts crying and wailing , remember how one of the leaks from that guy said that moves would be dual typed too ? 
  what if this is a psychic move ( stab for fennekin ) that acts like a fighting move ( due to being a punch ) and thus being effective ? 
  ~ ~ just throwing that out . 
  . do n't give up yet ! ~ ~, 
  i get confused with those two . 
  ** age : ** 18, 
  ** gender : ** male, 
  ** vocation : ** cadet in training at the time and space patrol, 
  ** physical description : ** jean is around 185cm tall , with light brown spiky hair and green eyes . 
  his built is n't too muscular but he has been training lately so that might change , he does seem to have longer legs . 
  ** personality quirks : ** jean used to be a very insecure child , shielded a lot by his widowed mother while living in japan . 
  in fact , as a consequence of his years living in the asian nation , he never managed to learn french despite his father 's heritage and actual country of birth . 
  called ` takashi ' by her mother and soon his peers at the tsp , jean joined the organization in order to discover the whereabouts of his father after disappearing in his last mission . 
  he has gained enough courage and trust over himself but there is still a long way to go . 
  he knows enough basic - or as the tsp calls it `` federation english '' - to communicate fortunately and other impressive hand-to-hand combat he learned from a group of rouge space pirates as well as super human agility and strength enabling him to leap up to 40 meters with ease . 
  he is now aiming to become an ` alto captaine ' , a special rank in the tsp which allows him to work freely in high risk missions in both space and time , all in the hopes of finding more clues as to what happened to his parent . 
  however , it seems destiny has other plans with him . 
  so i 'm not the only one . 
  schsh , is n't it ? 
  * is * a sort of anime character , i suppose . 
  ~ ~ well , are n't they all . 
  the super strength comes thanks to genetic modification . 
  i can just take this down . 
  \\* shrug *, 
  i wonder what would that make us pansexuals , giving that we do n't care about the gender-orientation spectrum : p, 
  mexican from / r/mexico here . 
  . we actually do n't deny our sad reality . 
  i * hate * those things . 
  it 's exactly that : stupid propaganda . 
  as a tijuana person , allow me to explain why you get these shitty messages : most of the radio antennas are in tijuana , which is as you might know is in mexican territory . 
  due to a law , the frequencies generating from the country must be able to carry out government messages , even if the destination of them is not really mexico at all . 
  the fact that they take their sweet time to translate means that somehow they might even * want * to use them as a way to show `` welp , in mexico we are all fine guys . 
  nope , really . 
  and we all go to cast our vote and we are abiding happy citizens '' . 
  fuck that . 
  i hate it . 
  it 's north korean level propaganda . 
  specially the one thrown in televisa . 
  and i will stop ranting now or else i 'm going to end up burning the palacio municipal . 
  in the maquiladora/factory i work , worker 's minimum wage is 7.50 pesos an hour . 
  convert that to usd ( atm 1 usd = 12.45 mxn ), 
  and that 's in the border . 
  in the south it can go as low as 5 pesos . 
  think about it . 
  and most of your tvs come from our factories . 
  holy shit . . that 's just . 
  . . wow . 
  i wish you the best of luck , girl . 
  you can do it = v = b, 
  you have inspired me to continue on with my fight , despite not being anything revolutionary or anything extreme . 
  when ever you feel low , try to remember that you [ will win , 'cause you chose to survive ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkfhs0cqle8 ), 
  : d good luck there !, 
  if you need a hand , i 'm also in cali ( well , baja cali ) . 
  we can meet and hang out too xd, 
  why , thank you . 
  i 'm always here tuesday and thursday nights if you need me . 
  i 'm also on facebook and twitter and at your local malt shop . 
  glad to be of help ; ), 
  pobres gringos que la andan sufriendo igual y en un ingles medio monotono : /, 
  not really north korean propaganda in context but in repetition . 
  it 's annoying . 
  you 're listening to the radio and you 're interrupted by these ` skits ' of `` omg , we defended our right to vote . 
  let 's all vote this july 7 : d '' or how `` we at the chamber of representatives are working for you !, 
  it 's also present in the tv , and let 's not begin with a certain television channel who spews 99 % bullshit . 
  but on comparing it to n.korea propaganda , it 's mostly on how repetitive they can be : /, 
  y no nomas por que nos digan : /,
