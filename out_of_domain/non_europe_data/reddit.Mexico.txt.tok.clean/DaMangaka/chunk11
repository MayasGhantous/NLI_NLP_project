  ca n't any of these people grab a dictionary or type the full word ? 
  i 'm surprised to * not * see mexico on the top 10 or on that top 12 for that matter . 
  yay !, 
  there 's a museum like this in california ? 
  oh dear goddesses i want to take my mother there and see what she thinks about it : p, 
  though , are there any texts in spanish ? 
  i can not upvote you enough . 
  i think this is the main problem with all religions tbh . 
  it 's the process or brainwashing they use upon you to stop thinking and make you overlook things . 
  either in the organization or the things they teach . 
  a thoughtcrime . 
  if people where to show these kinds of aspects , i 'm sure there would be less people inside . 
  usually , religions or many of the new age movements tend to be all like that . 
  all `` free your mind '' and happy trees being painted . 
  only when you are deeper you realize you are * not * meant to question anything they tell you . 
  it 's kind of sad . 
  and it can be applied to many things actually , not just religion/ideologies . 
  good thing you are awake . 
  never give away that right to think by yourself, 
  the goddess of machines xanadu is not pleased to find that she is not on the list . 
  you shall be asimilated inmediately . 
  the inegi is actually efficient ? 
  holy crap !, 
  that 's something new, 
  climate change denial ? 
  seriously ?

  right , time to get serious . 
  for starters , thanks so much for being here in reddit . 
  it 's really cool to get a chance to see ya here . 
  for my questions :, 
  a ) as a graphic designer i am curious as to what motivated the change of not only the windows logo but the whole gui for windows 8 . 
  it works for mobile but i have to admit it 's one of the reasons i 'm not updating my win7 , ca n't get used to the new interface and i have no touchscreen . 
  b ) what has been the biggest challenge at programing windows and which windows has been the hardest to do ? 
  c ) i 've heard a lot of stuff that the gates foundation has done in mexico , particularly my city ( tijuana ) when opening the bit center , so thanks for that . 
  on regards to the nation as whole , what do you think we must do to upgrade our own network and systems to be as competitive as other nations ? 
  i would like your insight on that . 
  i have always wondered how the wbc has such funding to make the amount of webpages that you have or is it just diferent dns , same ip ? 
  i thought this kim was the * supreme leader * . 
  guess they wanted a fancier name . 
  if you are north korean , why are you on the internet ?

  well , hopefully you have a smoky taste, 
  you 're now a mod at / r/atheism, 
  well , this is odd after reading the comments here but i became a picky eater on regards to my family 's food . 
  my mother has always made from scratch food , going as far as making 100 % all veggie baby food and not giving me a pacifier and replace it with a celery stick . 
  the thing is that the diet of my family consists of the following 3 ingredients : eggs , beans and chicken . 
  there 's nothing wrong with them but they do it so * often * and in the same fashion i roll my eyes and growl and wonder if they can do anything more . 
  my father can happily spend his week eating just eggs and beans and my sister seems to have acquired his taste of food . 
  mom could try to make different kind of food but is always ignored or rejected because it * does not have * any of the three ingredients stated above or made in a `` traditional '' matter . 
  so by the age of 10 , i decided to say `` screw this '' and learn cooking by my own . 
  now , i surprise to family with `` fancy '' dishes that most of the time they wo n't eat because they are n't the usual or do not have beans . 
  fortunately , i 've been slowly introducing food to them that i found out they like and even gone as far as to make them eat organic . 
  i 'm not really sure , was i the picky eater or they ? 
  psh , we tied cherry bombs to rockets and let them fly into a close by manufacturing factory . 
  they put up a wall 4 years after we had reached the age 18 and most have moved away : p, 
  mexican here . 
  brace yourselves . 
  i have mixed feelings about ~ ~ america ~ ~ the united states as a whole which makes me divide them in two categories . 
  for starters , the good , is that you have a lot of advances and benefits that many of us * really * wish to have - like a better minimum wage ( compare the proposed 9usd against 60usdcents in the north border of the country , it 's worse in the south ) , stores with a variety of clothing choices and sizes , better prices for goods and a better netflix ... - despite the whole lapd dorner case or what not , we * can not * trust our policemen ** at all ** . 
  we are on our own on most cases while i 've seen many good policemen in san diego give people a hand and be resourceful . 
  the whole `` american dream '' of working hard and getting a living - despite of the criticisms - is indeed still possible albeit locked in extra hard mode nowadays . 
  finally , most of my friends are from the states and my so is from the states ( from texas , of all the possible states ) and i find them to be really awesome . 
  despite of this - here comes the bad - the states has a lot of cons which i 'll cite :, 
  * mexico is a `` catholic '' nation with many adherents and people who literately go on their knees to the church on certain days . 
  despite of it , few believe in creationism or rather creationism is n't thought at schools . 
  it baffles me the level of religious dogma thought * at schools * !, 
  this creates a bigger and harder barrier to pass than our own border which makes it hard for you guys to bind together . 
  and not only on education , but in politics !, 
  there are so many people that say that the us ' founding fathers where christian when in fact they where perhaps deists or agnostics than anything . 
  mexico * was * founded under the idea of one language , one religion ( the white in the flag originally meant religion ) and yet we are more secular than you guys !, 
  what happened here ? 
  if we see a politician use religion for voting means , he 'll be shunned forever . 
  if we see a school that is n't a catholic private one or anything that teaches religious dogma , it 's shunned . 
  we love our state-religion separation . 
  what the heck united states ? 
  get your stuff together !, 
  * apparently , because you are ~ ~ american ~ ~ ` murican ^ tm you have a sense of entitlement . 
  heck , even * latinos * who `` escaped '' from here or other parts of latin america suddenly become dicks because they got into the us . 
  or their kids become dicks shunning their heritage and only using it as a victim flag in case their rights are being denied and roll on the floor and cry . 
  really , no , the world does not go around you ( a lesson we have also tried to tell the argentinians but they wo n't listen either ... ) and in fact , if you feel and know that your country has such power you should realize that you also have a big responsibility on your shoulders . 
  do n't just throw your crap at us because we are `` second world/third world '' idiots that do n't deserve better and are the cause of it all . 
  in fact , [ please do refer to this link here as to why most people in latin america do n't like you ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cia_activities_in_the_americas ) . 
  * ~ ~ your politicians are stupid but so are ours . 
  we are even here ^ let 's ^ swap ~ ~, 
  * so many lazy guys . 
  really . 
  my aunt that lives in the us goes on crying on how hard her job is ( 4 hrs at costco ) . 
  i work 10 hrs a day .
