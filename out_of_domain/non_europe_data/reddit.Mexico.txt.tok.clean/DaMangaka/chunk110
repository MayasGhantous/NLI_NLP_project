  i believe you have forgotten about capcom 's fiasco with mml3, 
  if they are ex-gay and therefore heterosexual . 
  * what * rights are they being denied again ? 
  if they are indeed heterosexual , they :, 
  * can marry and have their marriage validated everywhere in the us, 
  * can get spouse benefits . 
  * can not be discriminated at all . 
  * employers wo n't have any bases to reject them . 
  i mean , come * on * , they are making more drama than a drama queen at prom  :|, 
  * a long time ago . 
  as you might know , megaman legends 3 has been a game super anticipated since the beginning of the millennium . 
  after a lot of protest and fans going crazy , capcom * finally * decided to start with the project . 
  and there was much rejoicing , further more when capcom stated that the fans could co-develop the game by receiving ideas from the fans about characters , plots and more . 
  it was set to be released on the 3ds and people went nuts in helping the team . 
  however , one day , [ capcom released the following statement ] ( https://twitter.com/capcom_uk/status/93558391309471744 ) . 
  fans were not only heart broken but utterly pissed . 
  not only because they cancelled the game , but because it was ** their fault ** that the game had such fate . 
  way to be classy , capcom . 
  at least you are releasing a new phoenix wright . 
  i was referring to this part, 
   what business actively attempts to piss off their customers ? 
  sounds like that describes capcom a bit : p, 
  it 's understandable to hype people and kind of say ` nope ' if in the end you do n't have the man power/resources . 
  but to blame the fans . 
  . that 's just low : /, 
  it 's like saying `` welp , you ca n't get x or y because we do n't think there are many people in america who wants it '', 
  it 's just plain ridiculous . 
  all i have to say about this is . 
  ** unleash the rainbow !, 
  i 've seen that video before , except that in here we call it `` obedece a la morsa '' ( obey the walrus ) . 
  no freaking idea why . 
  my hotmail account , dating from 1997 . 
  it used to be from another free mail provider ( letera ) but then it was eaten by microsoft and thus became hotmail . 
  now kiss !, 
  this is why if a pokemon can learn metronome , i keep the move . 
  though it 's a big gamble . 
  examples like this happen a lot and it 's super epic . 
  it surprises your opponent because you really do n't know what to expect . 
  however , you * too * are also unaware of what might happen and things can become disastrous , with your pokemon self-destructing or making a memento . 
  but i have to say , metronome is my favorite move . 
  france : where being a biggot is utterly gay . 
  i hope i have n't arrived late  _  ; ; ;, 
  welcome baby jack !, 
  happiness and love for you / u/usensucht on this great day . 
  i shall now bring the blackjack table . 
  it 'll be grand = 7 = b, 
  no problem dear friend of mine = 7 =, 
  next , we need to go to las vegas . 
  where do i put the answers ? 
  otz ; i wasted one of the ` free prime ' offers so i guess i ca n't take it ; ; ;, 
  i can become a mod if need . 
  i am just wondering what happened . 
  nobody seems to post . 
  we need a coordinated team if we want this to survive . 
  a sort of plot . 
  we have geographical maps and some population problems . 
  we can make this work  v <, 
  this sounds like an awesome idea . 
  let me fire you up an pm so we can discuss about it . 
  i will add some samples too : d, 
  en cetys universidad la elogiada pero ignorada carrera de ing . 
  ~ ~ sin macs y photoshop pirata ~ ~, 
  i 've read your stories . 
  all of them . 
  i love them . 
  thing is , they kind of need to be inclusive . 
  it shows the schematics of the world but there is n't something we can jump on or interact with . 
  perhaps , using your story as base , we can create a scheme for this that could turn into an arg . 
  survive not online online but sort of take the game offline too . 
  make it more inclusive . 
  it 'll be the / r/outside of a dystopian future . 
  t at # /, 
  wtf ? 
  neta ? 
  es algo triste , y como que mi hermana no se decide . 
  / * sigh / *, 
  no pinches putas mames t _ t ;, 
  violentos ? 
  hmm , the flag stays as normal , but i will make myself a nice ` royal banner ', 
  if we are using geographical sites for pokemon , they are missing sinnoh ( hokkaido + disputed islands ) and unova ( new york city ) . 
  yup . 
  posting here just to see . 
  i have now gotten some wicked inspiration for a one shot with sweden here . 
  ~ ~ if you want me to post , i will post ~ ~, 
  but i did n't even ask for karma . 
  i expected my thread to die but it got around 300 + upvotes on it 's own . 
  then i got the pm that i was banned due to asking for upvotes despite i did n't : /, 
  i 've noticed . 
  whats ' up with the whole `` one thread at a time '' policy ? 
  ~ ~ dae they are leteraly being hitler ~ ~,

  specially the bad karma .
