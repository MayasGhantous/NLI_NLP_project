  i 'm one myself . 
  he rose his pen into the air in an exaggerated fashion . 
  he had seen it so many times on his favorite anime shows and he wanted it to try it himself . 
  he did n't feel as fabulous or as handsome as that writing assassin , but certainly he could feel as exhilarated as said character : his latest masterpiece was done . 
  he stared at the a1 sheet once his small celebration had ended , proud at what he had accomplished ; the latest page from the much anticipated chapter of his manga . 
  golden week was almost done and he was happy that this time he might have some chance to see the sun , get some ice cream , get to know somebody . 
  katsurawa yuuki - real name yamamoto kenji - was the latest of ` prodigies ' in the industry . 
  discovered by a publisher house by accident , at least according to what he stated on the magazine * monthly ` romance for you ' * , since then he had little to no contact with the world . 
  there was no doubt he loved his job as much as any mangaka would but there were at least two problems that came out in his mind on regards to it : the contract that bound him to create at least 2 chapters per week would turn excruciating sometimes . 
  he had lost count of the days he would go without sleeping . 
  such is the cross of a comic writer . 
  his only company so far were a lot of cute figurines from other tv shows and manga he had read himself and the occasional plush doll laid around his bed . 
  he was shy already and the self exile from the outside world was taking a toll increasing it to the point of awkwardness . 
  it got worse with girls . 
  and boys . 
  and there comes problem number two : relationships . 
  without a proper time to go out , with an increasing restrain of one self , kenji could n't even start imagining what would his life be out of the 10 by 10 room he had to move due to the crisis . 
  at least that 's what he heard people murmur during his search for independence . 
  despite of the inconvenience , he found this little place to be his own paradise and utopia . 
  a place were he could work , play and be what he truly was . 
  what * she * was meant to be . 
  her awe at the picture lasted as much as the bowl of cheap noodles that was at hands reach although by this time it was already empty . 
  she pursed her lips in disagreement noting how the man 's torso in one page looked too ` bulky ' for her liking and so within her mind comes the dilemma of whiting out or re-making the whole page all over again . 
  she looked at her alarm clock , 1:30 am . 
  yuuki stretched her body while sat , rubbing one of her eyes and grunting in discomfort . 
  she knew it was too good for her to have the last day off . 
  she could always let this small imperfection go although her consciousness would go to haunt her all over again . 
  her fans would certainly notice and she would be dishonored . 
  scratching her head , making sure her blonde wig did n't fall off , she gave a sigh and brought the items necessary for the remake . 
  she 'd probably find more errors along the way . 
  she knew she 'd end up reworking the whole chapter until it was the epitome of perfection . 
  she knew that the sun would never rise in her place , but that somehow so long as she worked she 'd find her own sunshine . 
  such is the cross of a mangaka .
