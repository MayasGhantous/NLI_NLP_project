  i 'll just res tag you as `` cool editor '', 
  maybe one day . 
  a taxi driver tried to give me a massage . 
  he still ended up getting my money but i kind of wanted to gtfo from there t vt ; ; ; ;, 
  yeaaaaaaah ;, 
  on what console is that ? 
  yes , but the point of other m was to explore adam 's relationship with samus ( although that was also touched in the metroid manga but . . eh . 
  we wanted to know how he died or something ) . 
  however , they started well . . and then the plot failed miserably . 
  i regret not having a 360 . . 
  might get me one once the 8th gen consoles start to arrive . 
  i know fusion was the sequel but . 
  let me explain myself a bit : metroid other m as a game is good but the premise of it all was to be the link between super and fusion . 
  many were awed by adam and wanted to know more so the response by the co-creator of metroid ( yoshio sakamoto ) was to bring us this game which he told us that ` will show a lot of what you do n't know about samus ' . 
  turns out . 
  . it was a complete crapfest where the characters were horribly 1 dimensional/bland . 
  i never got acquainted with any of the other allies nor cared if the deleter killed them . 
  heck , i do n't think the design team did so either . 
  as for the secret factor about samus , it was perhaps her mole . 
  yes , a mole on her chin . 
  chick but not exactly the reason i play a game . 
  the overly hated ptsd would have been taken better if it was n't because the gamers considered the prime series canon within the series while sakamoto * did n't * . 
  it was all convoluted , all random and just . 
  did n't work . 
  and the music , which is a * very * important element in the metroid franchise was un-inspirational . 
  there are 2 or 3 songs out of who knows how many and they were used in * cut-scenes * . 
  my point is that i know fusion is the sequel , but fans were quite hyped for this ` prequel ' and let down due to a team of people who ca n't agree on what the fuck to do with it . 
  i 'm kind of worried about the $ 110 in his ` pot ' . 
  it 's good to know that they have reported this on amazon but , will the money go back to them or how will it work ? 
  good job on detecting this so soon . 
  wonder what that guy wanted  _ , 
  this is why i am kind of against using the cups i 've gotten for birthdays , reddit exchanges and gifts . 
  i know i can and i just need to be careful but the thought of them breaking . 
  i will admit that i have a * huge trouble * doing that . 
  not that i hate me but i 'd rather spend my money on others than in myself - for example . 
  i do n't feel i deserve things or that things will be wasted if i get them for me . 
  or that i do n't have enough time . 
  how can i make it so i can start gifting me things without any guilt ? 
  \\* nod * that special thing ( cup , pencil , desk ) that it 's the best for you even though there are many others . 
  it hurts so much when they break/no longer work : (, 
  yeah , i thought that might be the case . 
  it really depends . 
  the card i get deposited on gets emptied 3 times a month so it can be converted to usd and put on my * other * us card . 
  this last one is the one i use for leisure . 
  it 's my savings/leisure card while the mexican one is my ` bill-paying , grocery , stuff-in-pesos card ( usually on the 4th week of the month . 
  like this week . 
  so , yeah . 
  it 's not a bank card , it 's a magical multi-use card < <, 
  i used to visit 9gag for my daily funny . 
  one day , i linked a picture to my so . 
  i was all `` lolololol , look at this picture , it 's so funny . '', 
  noticing where the hotlink came from , she practically dragged me to reddit while saying how 9gag was the scum of earth and all that i now have come to realize . 
  reluctantly i joined reddit . 
  i 've never looked back ever since . 
  you forgot to add 4 states in the mainland : ca , az , nm and nv ( though nevada and arizona are fused ) . 
  texas , while not exactly an official part of the nation , is a protectorate . 
  just putting that out . 
  i will morbidly admit that i was rather relieved to see the fact that half of the population in the territories of the empire ( if not more ) were dead . 
  the reason is simple : those who use the internet are more aware of the world , more easy to integrate in groups and have far more openness than the regular citizen . 
  it is true that bigots still exist but the internet peer pressure which has now manifested itself on the survivors in the real world plane . 
  this helps us to act more orderly and debate on a similar goal . 
  as for the bodies , we sadly are used to them . 
  dead bodies were a usual sight in the northern parts of mexico due ot the stupid drug war and a lot of people know what to do and where to take them . 
  we later decided to execute a simple idea : we 'd collect as many bodies as we can and use them as fuel . 
  mexicali - for example - is using the already existing termoelectric to create the needed energy to supply 4 of our states ( baja california primarily but also [ alta ] california , arizona and sonora ) . 
  in fact , this is the main reason google * still * exists : we are constantly supplying energy to silicon valley in order to keep these existing servers alive , so you do n't have to worry about your late night porn searchs to die . 
  indigenous tribes in the country managed to survive thanks to outreach but there are still questions as to how they did so given the fact that no electricity reaches to them in a constant flux . 
  they say it 's divine justice but i 'm sure it 's due to how far they were ( or their cats ) . 
  right now , given this chance , i announce that we are selling termoelectrical technology for your needs . 
  we are willing to ship it out for you if you have the means to . 
  also , we can teach you how to transform waste into energy . 
  let us revive the world as it should . 
  - hrh da mangaka i, 
  chuckle fucks ? 
  cheapest i could find [ was this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/b00001sies/ref=dp_olp_new?ie=utf8&amp;colid=33xe74j0rmjkr&amp;coliid=i1ck57fbc1a351&amp;condition=new ), 
  6 usd . 
  not too bad . 
  and the album is amazing . 
  i shed many manly tears at that video . 
  glorious . 
  spoon !, 
  all i want for x-mas is youuuuuu ... \u266b, 
  wait . 
  . it is n't x-mas yet ? 
  well , maybe [ this would be a great help ] ( http://www.amazon.com/drawing-head-figure-perigee-jack/dp/0399507914/ref=wl_it_dp_v_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=i33lhems4rm2yl ) . 
  see , i know how to draw . 
  [ here are ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h2yobtw.jpg ) [ some examples ] ( http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs39/i/2008/341/4/a/it__s_feels_like_xmas_already_by_gslucky.jpg ) of what i can do and while pretty i want to broaden my drawing skills . 
  not everyone likes the japanese anime style and even some people go as bad as to frowning it and saying it 's stupid due to it 's popularity , the stereotypes , etc and i ca n't blame them , it * is * rather popular and it might work with what they want . 
  so as somebody who who wants to make epic stories , i want to draw epicly , this can also open me doors for better jobs ( instead of the one i have which i barely get enough money to spend ; ; ) and simply raise the bar in my skill . 
  so , if you 'd help me on this quest , i 'd appreciate it very much . 
  it 's 6:23 pm est. 
  btw , gim me my money !, 
  surprise me if you wish = v = b,

  all the colors to create and draw my world or any world for that matter . 
  this is the crown piece for coloring .
