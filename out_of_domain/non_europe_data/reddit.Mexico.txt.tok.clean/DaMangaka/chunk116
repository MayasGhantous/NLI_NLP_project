  that 's what i first claimed . 
  philipines and north korea are technically territories/protectorates . 
  but . 
  yeah , i 'll admit i am proud of myself . 
  take your shirt off ? 
  yes please ; v ; it 's so hot . 
  / r/ainbow and ~ ~ / r/circlejerk ~ ~ / r/worldnews,

  it 's a huge motherload . 
  i hope you enjoy it : d,

  hooray holidays \\ = 7 = / my city earns a lot of cash from you vacationist people . 
  then again i have to work . 
  . no holidays for me = v = ;, 
  but 's ok , i had a good weekend nonetheless, 
  i remember the good ol days of nokia . 
  made in finland , it was the beacon of phones all around the world . 
  built by atheist sci [ ent ] ists to make it portable and wonderful , indestructible even . 
  there is even a town built with nokias that was meant to survive an apocalypse that might soon come . 
  but this has tarnished their euphoric reputation . 
  now they 've sold themselves to the fun [ die ] supported biggots of microsoft who we all know are contracted by the nsa which was built by hitler in his dreams . 
  farewell nokia . 
  until you wear a enlightened fedora again . 
  ~ ~ now where are my upsnowdens ? ~ ~, 
  humans are bizarre creatures , let me tell you . 
  for starters , they do n't have any sort of natural protection of their own . 
  they are literately flesh and bones . 
  no wonder they are so easy to scare and confuse . 
  imagine this if you will : you go to one of those xenozoos , get to an area full of humans , loaded plasma gun and * bam * !, 
  they all drop like flies . 
  really , they ca n't really defend themselves ; they 'll just cry and scream to the point you really care for these furless monkeys . 
   gear ... 
  right . 
  but , despite their inherent stupidity which causes them to be paranoid one with the other to a point were they are prone to * kill one another * just to prove who 's more worthy of being scared , they can really go rather ballistic . 
  just because they are inferior does n't mean they are worthless in battle : in fact , you might be surprised at them nara . 
  while they are soft and squishy , they are able to build strong armors . 
  almost as strong as our exos . 
  they do n't have claws but they can create impressive scythes and sabers . 
  they are smart , can get quite smart and their own need of self-extermination helps them achieve further destructive equipment . 
  it is no wonder older raced did n't want to cross paths with them : with their instinctive need of destruction and their increasing intelligence , their persistence , resistance . 
  hmm , come to think of it , humans are both a weak and strong race . 
  strong enough to destroy itself , bold enough to take on anybody else no matter the circumstances . 
  the galactic federation * has * become better structured thanks to the humans , more ballistic if i can add as well . 
  say , you think the hunter was human ? 
   you have to be joking . 
  so do i. i do n't know what 's the hate about it : (, 
  i suppose having a [ pasta making machine ] ( http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=utf8&amp;node=289791 ) would help . 
  to be honest , i love past a too but when ever my mother sees me eat/cook pasta , she automatically believes i want to get fat = n = ;, 
  joke 's on you facebook people !, 
  i only upload my drawings !,

  dae getting more upvotes for posting ** this ** in japanese, 
  yeah bub , i 've heard of maine but only in my dreams .

  well , hello there : d, 
  supposedly , you 're meant to say `` he sits on your ** lap ** and licks your ** face ** '' . 
  the guy 's dislexya scrambled the words \\* flies away *, 
  such a shame that he had to miss out such an euphoric era .

  upsnowdens for you . 
  i 'll throw a quantity and say you 've spent around $ 386 usd, 
  i thought so : p, 
  kind of strange actually . 
  when i see one of those things , i just ca n't resist and i pop them : /, 
  but i do it carefully to avoid scarring . 
  it 's actually very easy :,
