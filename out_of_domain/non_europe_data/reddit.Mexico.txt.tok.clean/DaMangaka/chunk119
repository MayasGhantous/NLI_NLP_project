  we just need to give him a staff and ta-dah !, 
  i post here . 
  i suppose you can too : p, 
  normal ds games are not region locked . 
  3ds games are the ones that are , unfortunately : (, 
  huh , i did n't knew . 
  i thought they were just regular ds cartridges . 
  so far i know , there are n't any specific dsi cartridges . 
  alright , [ pasta talia ] ( http://cachosessions.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_2670.jpg ) it is then . 
  huh , i see . 
  til, 
  a team of crobats . 
  . it 's beautiful man . 
  living in mexico , ordering ` penne ' at an italian restaurant always causes somebody to grin goofy and start snickering at the name . 
  i ca n't avoid grinning myself as well , specially when the one ordering it wants it ` very creamy ' . 
  aaaaaaaaaaaaand added to my icalendar, 
  dude !, 
  i * am * from tijuana xd, 
  you might have gone to the giuseppi 's : p, 
  such a small world, 
  ~ ~ saverios is so freaking expensive ... ~ ~, 
  wow , that was a long time ago !, 
  i think i was like 6 xd, 
  i 'm picking up my special edition 3ds xl . 
  we currently have a lot of resources to continue our growth . 
  we are rather lucky to be a country with such resources . 
  we are always open to receive your corpses , though . 
  we are currently neutral . 
  we will see how many people die and use their corpses for energy supply . 
  we are n't exactly sure how many survived in the philippines actually . 
  . might actually need to start a census . 
  we will happily accept your help given that the territory of philippines is far away from the mainland , but we are also accepting your corpses . 
  we are transmiting directly to our scientist at the [ politecnico nacional ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/instituto_polit%c3%a9cnico_nacional ) ~ ~ because the ones at the [ unam ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_autonomous_university_of_mexico ) are making experiments regarding themselves investigating under the influence of weed ~ ~ to determine not only the location but the cause of said frequency . 
  from what they have discovered , it has a similar pattern to this [ buzzer ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2ekwgtneyu ) . 
  can somebody from east europe calibrate their radios to a 4625 khz frequency and see if they can find it ? 
  we are unable to connect with the ` proclaimed ' protectorate of ostpreussen at the moment and thus we ca n't say for sure if it 's the same device . 
  * dear united states , *, 
  please stop fighting about stupid things and work on other important issues like immigration and the whole drug thing . 
  for the record , our government has never made such a tantrum before . 
  sincerely ,, 
  * mexico *, 
  lgbt sandwich sounds like an excellent treat . 
  i 'll try it soon enough . 
  mexico here . 
  we 'll take back california , nevada , arizona and new mexico . 
  texas is . 
  we 'll leave texas alone . 
  we 'll sell you the lots of houses our politicians have here . 
  how about that ? 
  es entendible pero . 
  lo del final se not\u00f3 , la neta : /, 
  we are neutral on all situations but if you need any related technology to detect the frequency and other readings , please let me know . 
  the scientists at the politecnico have done a lot of advances so far , while the ones at the unam are sober enough to implement some updates on your current equipment . 
  do please let me know if the area of the former oblast of kaliningrad is safe . 
  actually , we are selling uranium . 
  we have a lot of resources to exploit in asia thanks to the territory of ch\u014dsen . 
  we are still trying to see how to extract it safely ( and get more people there as literately the place got eradicated thanks to the r-virus ) and most possibly we 'll move the people from the territory of philippines there given the fact that there 's this hurricane coming and what not . 
  we can also exchange technology . 
  i 'm sure the guys at the politecnico would * love * to play with your mechs . 
   finally , male characters can not wear female clothes , and female characters can not wear male clothes . 
  as somebody who likes to crossdress . 
  this made me sad . 
  welp , i 'm sticking with the female character then . 
  mexican here . 
  can confirm that i 've never bought something from taco bell in my life . 
  but would n't that imply that it 's a condor ? 
  to be honest while it is true that not all of mexico is fucked up , people just do n't want to know about it . 
  they are too busy or do n't care and life goes on . 
  sort of a ` eh , nothin 's gon na change , why bother ? ', 
  sort of attitude i can read in many of my fellow mexicans which kind of makes me sad . 
  so many opportunities wasted . 
  a ** key pokemon ** ?!!, 
  omg, 
  where do i sign to get this on my team ? 
  pretty much indeed . 
  how can i upvote you like 1000 times ? 
  [ there will be no changes to our glorious flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/20/flag_of_mexico_1917.png ), 
  our nation has bad memories of being under an organization that does nothing but to invite nations to a place to squabble while the whole world burns . 
  unfortunately , until it proves it 's worth , we 'll remain as neutral as possible and reject the invitation . 
  i will be taking ( # 347235 ) thank you = v = b, 
  rest assured , our engineers can have plenty of fun with only one . 
  we plan to learn from them in order to create better versions for the future . 
  we do have a lot of people in the need of work . 
  manufacturing seems ideal . 
  i once went to buy my groceries rather early in the morning at a walmart here in mexico . 
  i was picking my produce when i heard how they called a department for a meeting via the intercom . 
  next thing i know they were gathered , made a round and talked about today 's goal and made that cheer thing . 
  it kind of creeped me out . 
  like somebody pointed out , it seemed kind of cult-ish . 
  i did n't think it was the usual thing on other walmarts . 
  i 'd feel embarrassed and pointlessly useless if i had to do that every day : /, 
  omg !!, 
  did you hear ? 
  pokemon x and y are coming !, 
  i ca n't really hold my excitement about this whole thing . 
  first , they announced the games and i was like `` yeah , ok pues , i 'll choose the one in blue pos nomas and it has that little venadito thing over there '' but i was disappointed that i needed a pinche 3ds . 
  ca n't they see i 'm poor and stuff ? 
  but i am determined to get the newer versions and start saving and i apart my game for the day it comes out and suddenly there are many leeks y woahhh !, 
  no mames !, 
  and then everyone and their dog has megavolutions y esa madre and it pumps you and it makes you want it more and then when you least expect it , * t\u00f3mala !,
