  my dad 's coworkers ( all ~ ~ american ~ ~ ` murican , he 's the only mexican auditor of the team ) go around talking about when are they going to retire . 
  life is working guys , and it 's your fault you have like a gazillion of usd in debt after using 10 credit cards ... 
  i could say more but i do n't want to write a book on reddit : /, 
  hand made caesar salad dressing . 
  when i discovered the recipe i never went back . 
  if you 'd like , i can give you the ingredients . 
  does mario party count ? 
  i can be indeed a very bad balance between the people who are really struggling with stamps and no jobs and those who stretch out a hand and go `` plz give me moneys '' . 
  but i want to poke too to the regular salary man that blows his paycheck buying crap they do n't need and then going `` wai does thiz happen to me ? 
  this is ` murica , i should be able to earn enough to buy that expensive as hell car that i saw at the superbowl and threw away a dude a room away '' . 
  they want stuff for almost * free * without working . 
  sure , it also goes with people over here but the amount of people asking for credit and going bankrupt is too damn high . 
  in making the united state 's economical situation better , it would be a great leap if people would stop buying unnecessary crap and learn to save . 
  ~ ~ and also stop bailing the bankers , sure , why not ? ~ ~ . 
  in mexico , if you earn 100 usd a week , you * know * you must survive with that . 
  what i 've seen in the us ( and i cite my aunt again on this ) , is that one can earn 100 bucks and spend like 500 . 
  that ai n't good . 
  and on top of that you wan na retire ? 
  fuck you . 
  ~ ~ i will need to see your sources son , because last time we actually where on the # 1 position there . ~ ~, 
  and i know there are a lot of ~ ~ tea ~ ~ douchebags there but , like i said earlier , there are also a lot of people i have learned to embrace and love ~ ~ and have plotted to flee to canada or s [ weed ] en with me ~ ~ . 
  and i cite that my so is from texas , which from what i 've heard and seen on reddit can safely call it the redneck jesusland . 
  you guys need benito juarez . 
  ~ benito juarez for president 2016 ~, 
  close but no cigar . 
  i live in tijuana , i get to see both sides of the border quite frequently . 
  but that also might be a deterrent on how well i know the us * and * mexico . 
  i mean , i went to puebla last year and i was blown away of how beautiful it was . 
  once i get enough money , my plan is to travel all around my country and end up in monticello in the us . 
  yeah , i know . 
  it 's still no excuse to allow religion in politics though . 
  granted , it still pokes in our own legislation ( curse you pan * shakes fist * ) but we seem more secular overall . 
  juarez | jefferson 2016, 
  ~ ~ i blame my father for this ~ ~, 
  well , it 's not working , but you should n't expect things for free . 
  and if you do get things for free , take a look what it happened so it became free . 
  i mean , i 'm currently `` working '' but i really would like to be in bed snuggled up on my blanket because i 'm technically doing nothing but sitting here . 
  the thing is that many people want a good life doing little or nothing . 
  even if you do live in a nice family with goods and great earnings , one needs to learn to appreciate life . 
  yeah , saw another reply regarding this . 
  i actually am surprised tbh : p, 
  still , no reason to push a religious agenda on schools and politics . 
  keep them separate , plz, 
  i hope i can get retirement too , tbh . 
  current laws in mexico make it nearly impossible to get seniority here . 
  i 'm working to get enough money for a business . 
  if you thought the `` american dream '' is in super hard mode right now , most of us are starting our work life in hyper ninja gaiden hard mode, 
  ~ ~ i have always wanted to go to houston . 
  nasa ftw ~ ~, 
  i always go around saying that i ` type ' as i ` talk ' . 
  and i suppose since my head works around in translating my messages from spanish to english and * then * goes to typing , it can get a bit odd . 
  like me using ` on ' where ` in ' should go , etc. 
  i know other parts of texas are liberal ( my so lives in san antonio , i 've heard about there being a lgtb community in austin and who can forget houston ? ), 
  but you ca n't avoid the image of a cowboy with a huge-assed gold cross hanging on his chest with guns on both hands and riding a horse . 
  it 's a long stretch , but there are such cases . 
  * shrugs * then again , chihuahua is kind of the same , is n't it ? 
  they passed a law which allows employers to hire people * per hour * . 
  this is pretty much - according to them - so they do n't go around sitting on their chairs for 10 hours when they really do nothing ( like myself right now :p ) and spend more time doing things . 
  however , we 'd be paid per the hour ( again , 60usdcents here in the border ) and since employers do n't extend a contract there is absolutely no way to prove our seniority . 
  also , since we get ` commissioned ' per work/hour/period without contract , there 's no way we can get into out free healthcare system , our pension system or any other system of the kind ( like the infonavit - government credit loans for housing ) . 
  also , employers are now able to fire people via e-mail or a phone call ( like in the us ) and * if * they do give you a contract , employers usually give you a 3 month ` test trial ' contract in which they see if you are adept for the job . 
  since it 's cheaper to rotate employees , usually at the end of the 3 month contract , you 're out . 
  this has been me for the last 2 years after i finished my degree : i have n't been able to find a stable job and been going on around . 
  worse is that manufacturing companies frown and stare at your cv funny because you have n't been able to stay put in a company when in fact they wo n't and might even not hire you due to that . 
  another thing is that they hire more internees than full fledged engineers/graduates because it 's * cheaper * . 
  to graduate from a bachelor , you need to have worked at least 3 months as an assistant in a company . 
  the current laws say that employers are free to see if to pay the assistant ( which thank the goddesses mine did , but like 70usd a week ... ) so you can see why they prefer these people . 
  it 's very complicated really . 
  i 've sent job cvs as far as to canada to see if i am able to get a job but . 
  . just now i got one but my contract lasts a month . 
  who knows . 
  my mom kind of is more stuck to creationism though u _ u ;, 
  she is an avid catholic and even gives classes to children about that . 
  it makes me lol that i am a frequent lurker in / r/atheism and my family has crosses and pics of the virgin mary . 
  ps : i 'm more agnostic or what ever but . 
  yeah . 
  my family lives in mazatlan sadly , so we kind of have to go to visit them once in a while . 
  but ... word of advice : never travel by car and if you do , do n't do it alone . 
  it 's just a comparison point . 
  i know you guys earn more and sadly have to pay more for living : /, 
  and in related news , he 's being backed up with the richest man in the world to [ bring more monsanto everywhere ] ( http://m.impatientoptimists.org/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.impatientoptimists.org%2fposts%2f2013%2f02%2fpartnering-to-empower-poor-farming-families-and-ensure-global-food-security ), 
  i 'm sorry , is russia going back to 1970 ? 
  mom says the final word . 
  no exceptions . 
  it can be one of the following :, 
  ** easy mode **, 
  put a lot of chili into your food ( preferably something like a taco or a sandwhich ) and eat it . 
  the spiciness will make your eyes cry and your nose runny . 
  you 'll also drink a lot of water which helps you push away the cold faster . 
  repeat as necessary . 
  ** hard mode **, 
  make a cup of chamomile tea and let it cool down . 
  do n't add anything . 
  grab a small cotton ball , dunk it on the tea and carefully make drops of the liquid fall into your nostrils . 
  do not inhale but let it slide all the way down your throat . 
  when i do ( or was forced by my mom to do this ) that , usually the cold is gone the next day guaranteed . 
  but it feels horribly icky  _ < ;, 
  apparently comic-sans ( i 'm a graphic designer ) , though i use it to spite my friends . 
  a real trouble though are those people who think they * know * what they want but really have no freaking idea of how things work or just ... 
  it 's hard to decipher them at times , like giving an untrained monkey a puzzle and hoping they will solve it only to find he 's eaten it .
