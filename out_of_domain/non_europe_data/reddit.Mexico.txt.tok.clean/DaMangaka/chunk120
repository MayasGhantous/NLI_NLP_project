  * , un pinche 3ds xl with pokemons in it . 
  you become poor but your happy for your new 3ds y eso . 
  and now , we are just at one pinche semana del pinche juego and theirs leeks in all the internets . 
  y pues no quieres ver pero you ca n't and you see and you want it more . 
  se ve , se siente . 
  por cual version te vas a aventar ? 
  a ver si te compras la * wai * so we can trade y esa madre . 
  i literately scram `` no !!, 
  come back you little f * ck ! '', 
  remembering how frustrating it was to catch that thing on the safari zone . 
  then , suddenly , little me wanted red to glitch the game : p, 
  * of course !, 
  we have a microwave but we never use it . . . 
  we are too used to heat things up in the stove . 
  i do n't know why you find this weird ... 
  mexican here . 
  can confirm . 
  ** now i 'm doomed to rage at such thing every time i see it !, 
  i 'm preparing a ship to pick up any corpses you might find . 
  just say the word and i 'll alert my territory in philippines to pick them up . 
  so long as they keep the trumpets and the sea ~ ~ gulls ~ ~ intact and epic , i will welcome our overlords of hoenn . 
  hoenn has the best ost of pokemon so far . 
  i 'll be bold enough to say it has * the best * . 
  i wonder what the mexican pattern will be . 
  if it 's epic and does justice to the country , i might well change the region from california back to mexico < _ < ;, 
  killing death . 
  yeah , good luck with that ... 
   sun : mexico, 
  brb , changing my region to mexico again . 
  i wonder : if you get an x pattern vivillion and you breed it , will it have the x pattern from the mother or based on the region you are located ? 
  much science must be done . 
  my kingdom for all those plushies . 
  this is kind of how i started in pokemon . 
  i had passed from 5th to 6th grade with good scores so dad bought me pokemon blue . 
  the rest is history . 
  dads can surely change your world in significant ways : d, 
  hmm , i 'll take some time to fill my info . 
  i promise it 'll be interesting . 
  i have a friend who wishes to start his kalos journey too but he does n't have any money nor any chance for a job ( he 's studying ) . 
  i really wish to gift him a 3ds for his birthday ( which is on oct 31 ) but i really am tight on my own assets . 
  good that you are part of the troupe that will start the journey on the 12th : d, 
  i will see what i can do . 
  but first , i need to pull out some info . 
  not sure if he wants x or y but boy i * do * want to surprise him = 7 =, 
   calor, 
  your god , where is he ? 
  ditto on that one , and i waited long enough because i * knew * nintendo would milk out the series and launch a special edition 3ds . 
  i was not disappointed and i became poor spending my last 200 usd on it . 
  i am a very happy person . 
  same name since blue : gslucky, 
  being from mexico , ludicolo and hawnchula come first in mind , right ? 
  but then there would be hordes of vivillion that come from canada to make their nests here . 
  we have squirtles , krabbies , basculin and mantines on the seas . 
  perhaps some milotic in cancun . 
  and of course , garbador in the bigger cities . 
  given the ruins/archeological sites , we might find some claydols , sigilif and unowns . 
  tl ; dr : lots of pokemon . 
  we are after all irl diverse . 
  finally !, 
  somebody that post regards the music in pokemon . 
  one of my main quirks is holding a videogame 's soundtrack in a higher place than the actual game or graphics . 
  thanks to this , i did n't like d/p/pt that much and i never bought fr/gl due to how horrible ( imo ) they made the soundtrack . 
  so far , x/y is elegant , fluid and beautiful . 
  i am very pleased . 
  i think i 'm going frame that last phrase . 
  [ mfw i was told that . 
  ] ( http://media1.giphy.com/media/c7pk7i1vkrqq8/giphy.gif ), 
  wait a moment . 
  pet insurances as in . 
  . you know , * pet insurances * ? 
  i might not be too used to it but . 
  . why ? 
  when ? 
  how ? 
  these things are a thing ? 
  i picked the girl and i want some male clothing : /, 
  they shooed me because that was n't the correct section . 
  conservative kalos . 
  and they * follow * you . 
  you stay on a certain area away from it . 
  and they wait . 
  . wait for you to come closer and then `` boom !, 
  wild pokemon popped out ! '', 
  the wind does n't make it better : /, 
  ditto here, 
  psycho cut , iron tail , earthquake , return , brick break . 
  [ you can see the list here ] ( http://www.serebii.net/pokedex-bw/150.shtml ), 
  =  and this is where i shall put my epic stuff < =, 
  did you say , comic ? 
  / r/circlejerk , is that you ? 
  tijuanense here . 
  there are a * lot * of skilled bilingual dentist in tijuana of any kind . 
  from the simple ones to the fancy kind . 
  i do n't think you 'll need to go and stay 2 days in san diego , though that depends on the kind of treatment you want to do . 
  what i recommend you is to get on a bus that takes you to the * otay * border ( much safer and less people to cross in and out the states ) . 
  i 'll get to you on which bus line is but if i do recall correctly it 's called `` estrella de oro '' . 
  you can then cross over to tj and grab a cab or a azul y blanco bus to downtown/centro ( which is where most dentists are located ) . 
  most if not all accept usa insurances and speak english . 
  if you do cross from otay there is the former bugambilias ( now lausana ) or many other good name hotels nearby ( hotel city express is one of them ), 
  if you want more info on local dentists in both otay and other area , just let me know .
