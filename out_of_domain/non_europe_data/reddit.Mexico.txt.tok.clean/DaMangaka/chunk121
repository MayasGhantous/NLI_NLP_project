  . just until now i realize that this girl was * really * coming up to you . 
  even if your character is female . 
  wow . 
  it 's like real life : i really ca n't notice when somebody is giving me hints < _ <, 
  what ? 
  why ? 
  most of their good stuff costs at least 25 usd . 
  probably this is to make people spend more but . . this is a bad move on their part , really . 
  so the kgb certainly continues to exist , huh ? 
  i can only wonder given that snowden is there . 
  i am decided to get [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/nintendo-ds-limited-edition-pokemon-pack/dp/b001cd3ksi/ref=wl_it_dp_v_s_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=2cic7le9qyh7v&amp;coliid=il88wny3ebois ) for my so . 
  she recently lost her job , is really sad and i want to make her smile . 
  i had given her some pokemon games to play but i just got word that she had to sell her 3ds to pay her bills . 
  the way she lost said job was stupid too and thus the reason why she kind of feels crushed . 
  i 'm also aiming to get her the [ red pokemon 3ds xl ] ( http://www.amazon.com/nintendo-pok%c3%a9mon-limited-edition-red-3ds/dp/b00ev4o7b4/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pc_s_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=2cic7le9qyh7v&amp;coliid=i10snefk2r4uc7 ) so she can get playing on her y version she bought but could not play . 
  first one , then the other ( i got her emerald too , so that 's why the dsl : p ), 
  it will be hard to get them both given my salary but i will make it through . 
  i do n't need the money as much as she needs the support . 
  wish me luck guys , i 'll try to finish this quest by december . 
  i love those flowers !, 
  i 've always been curious about it but never really got to buy me one . 
  they are so simplistic yet cute : p, 
  dad came back from europe after 3 weeks there working and stuff . 
  i got lots of goodies and a peeing boy from brussels . 
  anybody know why it is the symbol of that city ? 
  where is the link for this marvelous album ? 
  as a muse fan , i need to collect them all xd, 
  also , their b-sides are awesome . 
  i would suspect that as a german thing but . 
  hmm . 
  i have both digital and cd versions of them . 
  i like to support them with what ever i can and collect their albums . 
  i think i have all their side bs but i still want the album . 
  after all , ripping the audio from the source must be better than a random download somewhere : p, 
  perhaps it 's a bit of self promotion but i 've been writing up a pokemon comic with a prof. willow in it : p. 
  he specializes in the pokemon-human relationships and the effect in their environment, 
  and since you have a 3ds , best recommendation out there is ocarina of time . 
  back in it 's prime ( n64 era ) , it was considered the best game of all time . 
  i 'm not kidding . 
  heck , some still hold it in said pedestal after 10 years of being published . 
  my # 1 recommendation . 
  yesterday , after almost 10 years of not being able to , i bought a ** big ** halloween pumpkin . 
  it has a lot of pulp too , so i may be doing some cupcakes/pancakes too . 
  i accept any suggestions on both what i should cook with it and carve on it . 
  i was thinking a pokemon carving xd, 
  that actually would be wonderful . 
  is there a way to contact them ? 
  `` the greatest wealth is health '', 
  hmm , i suppose the best thing when i was younger was that i had these epic adventures with my friends . 
  one day we would be space patrol , another one we 'd be bikers and other times they 'd pester me out . 
  on christmas we 'd buy lots of fireworks and do all kinds of things with them . 
  pretty cool actually . 
  oh , we made sure we were careful . 
  in fact , part of our whole deal was to also instruct newbies on how to handle the fireworks properly . 
  if you got hurt , you were probably retarded or playing with them wrong . 
  some never got to use ` stronger ' ones because they were n't perceived as skilled enough . 
  it was all about skill : p, 
  it 's actually a pumkamboo . . with a mochimerica on it 's head ( a shoutout to my so ) . 
  i seem to need to learn to carve pumpkins better ... 
  i reject all of your pokemon religions and follow the path of mewtwo . 
  none shall enslave me, 
  this is not for me but my so . 
  she had pre-ordered y on amazon and was bound to buy a 3ds on the week the special edition 3ds xl when she had an accident at work . 
  she was fine and not hurt but that accident caused her to loose her job . 
  she was devastated and kind of shut herself out for 2 weeks out of depression . 
  i really am enraged at how they treated her as an expendable thing . 
  i am saving to get her a 3ds ( or dsl for the pokemon b/b2 and emerald i had sent her before i knew the news ) so it 's ok if you do n't choose me . 
  and that 's pretty much it . 
  my childhood is pictured here !, 
  i also got some of those buildable pokemon figurines stored . 
  dunno if you want me to take a picture of them . 
  they came in the sabritas as well, 
  i 'm wondering if you can breed me a female modest ralts . 
  pm me for fc : d, 
  si se celebra . 
  this was actually posted in / r/mexico, 
  the community 's response : we do n't care really . 
  go ahead , dress as la catrina . 
  we then also bombed the possible sjw who posted that on the sub because well . 
  . really . 
  . no , the whole thing exposed here is retarded . 
  also , if she 's really from the tijuana-san diego area , she should * well know * that tijuana does n't really celebrate dia de muertos . 
  we do . 
  but we are more into going to halloween parties and celebrations as such . 
  some even mix halloween with dia de muertos . 
  does that mean we are culturally appropriating a celebration that is not ours ? 
  excuse me while i go head palm at barrio logan . 
  kangashtan would like a word with you, 
  g\u00fcero / g\u00fcera technically means ` blond/blonde ' . 
  so , yeah . 
  i was actually going to post this here !, 
  you beat it to me : p, 
  saving it !, 
  thanks !, 
  may i have one too plz ? 
  raginmund uses feels !, 
  critical hit !, 
  it 's super effective !, 
  da mangaka fainted !, 
  ~ ~ no , realmente no .
