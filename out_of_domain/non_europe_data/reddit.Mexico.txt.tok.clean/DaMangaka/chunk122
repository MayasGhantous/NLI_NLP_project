  i have one word for you : switzerland, 
  ftfy, 
  ~ pewpew ~ = 7 = /, 
  my first added item was [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/dp/b000mrsuee/ref=wl_it_dp_v_s_ttl?_encoding=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=i2rhide2twiazz ), 
  ... holy crap , it 's still expensive ; ; ;, 
  y tardan * 1 inche mes *, 
  y eso es en cartas . 
  para mayor comparaci\u00f3n : mand\u00e9 una postal a noruega por medio de / r/randomactsofcards y dur\u00f3 como 1 mes y medio . 
  translating the other image :, 
  `` so you are leaving me . 
  it would be a shame if i, 
  killed myself '', 
  well , i know mexicans are well known to laugh at death and disgraces but this is just morbidly wrong  : |, 
  le diste al clavo . 
  the sad thing is that if you call off the bribes or the law slips everyone does , you are a `` mam\u00f3n ''  : | . 
  mexico is fucked in part thanks to our own people who wo n't do shit because they want things easily without a sacrifice, 
  this hits home so hard . 
  i live in tijuana . 
  i see this everyday . 
  i work in a maquila that manufactures spa covers that can cost up to 700 usd , yet the workers ( the `` operadores '' ) earn up to 70 usd ( depending on the exchange rate . 
  currently at 12.92 in the border ) a week and most * await * to see if there 's an opening for extra time shifts for more money . 
  it 's really sad realizing that many of those nice smart tvs that can cost up to 1200 usd are made by people who would need to work at least 4 months for one . 
  omg !, 
  i * so * wan na participate on this : d, 
  happy art-mas !, 
  i want _____, 
  [ link goes here ], 
  i do n't know if amazon can fulfill it , but i wish i had more time . 
  you forgot a bill ! , you fundie, 
  \\* throws money at screen *, 
  there is never * too many * bills . 
  ever, 
  check your bill privilege !, 
  hello , ~ ~ amateur pseudo-mangaka and ~ ~ graphic designer by trade . ^ though ^ i ^ make ^ cads ^ for ^ a ^ living, 
  i wont ' show my illustrations due to me feeling they are n't really that good enough to show yet . 
  but that 's not what i 'm here for . 
  i have a simple question : do you consider that art can be a design and vice versa ? 
  i remember that in my first design class , the whole `` art is not design '' was remarked repeatedly . 
  just had that small inquiry . 
  i 'm a pigeon and i 'm fucking confused about this : /, 
  the poster is actually really awesome . 
  i want one, 
  he also posed as wanda to fuck around with the avengers . 
  he * has * had his moments but has never really been a woman . 
  prequel actually . 
  if you want to cry more , try to get the cd drama and the script in english . 
  you mean mewtwo returns . 
  i was referring to the first part ( birth of mewtwo ) . 
  sorry if i made myself unclear, 
  mexican here . 
  there is little to * no * information regarding the existence of the tpp . 
  all we know is that the president in turn ( calder\u00f3n ) signed us for the treaty while traveling to japan in 2011 without the congress approval . 
  given the fact that the media is ridiculously retarded here and few have access to actual facts , what can we do in order to put a stop to it as well ? 
  b-bu-but there * is * a kids day !, 
  at least where i live < _ <, 
  . . a ver . 
  the fun part is that once the streetpass file has been created , you do n't even need to have the game in the 3ds ( if cartridge ) to pick up data . 
  it 'll pick them up too : d, 
  count me in !, 
  it so just happens that i 'm breeding perfect ivs zubats . 
  i wish i had one with infiltrator , though . 
  nope . 
  you make a clockwise circle with the pad and then press down + a. 
  * everyone * knows that 's the correct way to do so . 
  ( ^ still does this on x as well ),

  ftfy, 
  welp , today is that day . 
  the day of my birthday . 
  it is meant to be special considering that i 've hit the quarter of a lifetime . 
  however , this makes me go into thinking mode : when i was 10 , i had a grand plan of how things would work when i got to this age . 
  i 'd grow up , go to the best schools , graduate , study in japan and become a famous mangaka . 
  i 'd be out of my house by this age , in particular . 
  10 years after that , i realized that maybe i was n't good enough to study in any of japan 's universities and decided to stick to the best university in my city . 
  was it worth ? 
  i suppose . / * shrug *, 
  now i 'm 25 . 
  it took me 2 years to get this job that barely pays me . 
  in fact , i 'm paid like an internee when i have my big bumbling engineer diploma . 
  the job barely gives me to move out to a comfortable setting ( i could move but really , you 'd probably end up in a sort of ghetto with the kind of money i earn ) but at least i 'm grateful to have enough to spend it on reddit exchanges and you guys ( btw , i * still * need to finish those postcards ... ) . 
  if i were to see myself as i am now , my 10 year old self would probably be disappointed . 
  kind of , considering i have money now in my pockets . 
  but regardless , i 've also been blessed with many things : i have reliable friends to count with . 
  experiences which has made me broaden my mind and pull me out of the little hole of insecurities i had ( and still kind of have ) when i was younger . 
  i am bolder in the kind of stories i do and in overall , i 've had a grand time . 
  something tells me that from now on , stuff will change in my favor . 
  though for some reason i kind of fear it because it 'll be a 360\u00ba spin in my life and something that still startles me is sudden changes : good or bad , does n't matter . 
  just rambling here , but this is me hoping that things will settle in my favor . 
  i 'll keep on with my little fight , doing drawings and designs here and there for one bit of a presentable portfolio i can show to my potential customers and say good bye to this horrible * maquiladora * life . 
  - da mangaka . 
  well , i suppose that due to today being my birthday , many things are n't pissing me off . 
  but what really grinds my gears is that i have a crappy hell of a job that does n't pay well enough to move out or do something life changing like i had been planing to do precisely at this age . 
  even more than that , i 'm pissed off at the whole situation my so was let out of her latest job . 
  so unfair and such a biased opinion that manager had , it was ridiculous . 
  she would stay extra hours working just because her co-workers never even give a crap about her having to cancel plans to fill in while they go watch football or do some useless thing like that . 
  she 's kind of anxious and the idea of closing at 1 am was nerve wrecking the first times . 
  still , she did it because nobody gave a fuck and just extended her time there . 
  on top of the extra hours ( which at least got paid ) , the way they axed her was ridiculous and angering : due to a small accident which toppled a rack of beers ( which from her accounts , almost fell * on * her ) , they decided just to let her go . 
  not to mention that she did utter the usual ` this job is n't really that good ' and some bitch just decided to be a venomous snake and tell the manager in order to push her off . 
  my so mentions that this snake was also a sort of teacher 's pet and was mostly who she filled in for .
