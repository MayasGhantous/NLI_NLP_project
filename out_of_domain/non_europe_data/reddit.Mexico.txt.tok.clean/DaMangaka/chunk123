  now , it seems impossible for her to get a job , her mum is demanding her part of the rent and i really wish i could help but i 'm so freaking far away from her now . 
  it frustrates me to no end and she is equally frustrated . 
  in general , the whole job and employment system sucks and i really wish those big guys had to suffer the same situations we go through . 
  that is my main rant . 
  sorry for that ^ ^ ; ; ;, 
  holy shit !, 
  that 's just wrong  : |, 
  i remember when i too was robbed but by that time i kind of was weaning from the fad so it did n't hurt that much . 
  but one time they stole my wallet ( which i used to put my pokemon cartridges due to not really having any other use for it ) and it just made me so pissed and sad  : (, 
  i 'm mostly interested on your experience on berlin . 
  why were you detained during that time ? 
  how did they treat you while detailed ? 
  where the soldiers at the east mostly russians ? 
  east germans or an equal mixture of both ? 
  did you see any crossing attempts during your time ? 
  what was the protocol if you saw somebody jumping the border ? 
  thanks, 
  what is love ? 
  people have such high regard on love . 
  people seek out love , at least that 's what i hear from the whispers of people . 
  i remember the times at that waiting room before my weekly therapy sessions and remember the looks of pity from their faces . 
  `` she does n't seem to be empathetic '', 
  `` poor girl . '', 
  replied the other one . 
  `` hurt at such young age . '', 
  to be able to love , one needs to know how to . 
  all i remember you doing during that time was to put me through the most inhumane pain possible . 
  all of me hurt ; inside , outside . 
  whips , chains , awkward poses . 
  mind and soul , shattered leaving behind a hollow remnant of what supposedly i am to be instead . 
  they say one is thought to love . 
  i suppose i got my intended share . 
  now that i 've grown older . 
  i wish now to return the favor . 
  so please , daddy , let me show you some my love . 
  happy thanksgiving = v = ; ; ;, 
  i swore to my so that if texas allows gay marriage , i 'd fly over there on the next flight and propose . 
  let 's see how long it takes ...
