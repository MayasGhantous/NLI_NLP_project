  the united states ? 
  b-but . 
  there was an agreement ; ; ;, 
  that place is cursed , i tell you . 
  that whom possesses it is doomed to fail ; ;, 
  * why do you think i did n't claim it , it being originally from the empire ? 
  i can allow panama to be neutral ( . 
  though , if you might have read my info , you 'd see i 'm practically neutral ) but i ** will not ** give you our northwest states . 
  that area was part of our empire long before those horrid yankies decided to rape our lands with an unfair war . 
  now , it 's ours again . 
  we have learned our lesson and do not like to meddle in the affairs of the texans . 
  we learned with a high price . 
  we used to be a cowardly nation that liked to clean your home and lick your boots . 
  now , under this new government , we shall do as our anthem does and declare war if necessary . 
  but not now . 
  we do not want war , but what you want is an unnecessary expansion , much like your predecessors . 
  we shall remain in stand-by . 
  [ meanwhile , this will be playing all across our northern border ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4xi3rg7m6i ), 
  done . 
  \\* shrug *, 
  that was it ? 
  i thought we had it . 
  my mistake , i suppose . 
  ** note to all **, 
  mexico is * neutral * . 
  also , there ** is ** free flow on the panam\u00e1 channel . 
  just ask your local authorities to help you cross . 
  that 's all . 
  why are you so intent on keeping california ? 
  california is not going anywhere . 
  the panama chanel is open already , btw . 
  i 'm sorry , but the answer is still ` no ' on regards of the territories . 
  um , i do not wish to be rude but . 
  which country survived ** in it 's full entirety ** and not only did that but added ** more ** to it 's territory ? 
  that 's right : mexico . 
  the former united states fell too quickly to even start to comprehend . 
  if you truly represent texas , you should know that texas used to be also a sole republic * away * from the united states . 
  and , that ` land of the free ' moniker does n't really compare to other former states like sweden or finland . 
  your negotiation is negated . 
  we shall play defense on this down . 
  liberty of * what * i dare ask ? 
  our nation is free already and does no harm at all . 
  your notion of liberty is as skewed as them . 
  do not keep such line of thought because in the long run * you * will be destroying yourself in a near future . 
  i 've actually posted something popular and i 'm still at 100 xd ;, 
  damn you pasto !, 
  \\* shakes fist *, 
   california has the largest minority population in the united states by numbers , making up 60 % of the state population.in 2000 , hispanics comprised 32 % of the population ; that number grew to 38 % in 2011 . 
  non-hispanic whites decreased from 80 % of the state 's population in 1970 to 40 % in 2011 . 
  add the reddit virus and you get a much lesser population of your so called `` gringos '' . 
  in other words , * we * refuse . 
  signed . 
  hrh da mangaka i, 
  ps : panama is open . 
  what more do you want ? 
  i could concede nevada * only * if not for the fact that i question the purpose of these actions . 
  proud citizens of a nation ? 
  who are you to claim lebensraum ? 
  or have are you so keen on restarting manifest destiny ? 
  are you really that eager to go back to your roots and pick on others who are n't even bothering your existence . 
  your claim on texas was something to be wary of but nonetheless we let it happen even after many nations had virtually agreed that said place was claimable or touchable . 
  granted , there is a good saying that `` nobody messes with texas '' and we just did that . 
  but to let go panama as it 's own nation ( and who knows if it 'll be eventually absorbed by you or converted into a puppet state ) and grant you a piece of land you do n't necessarily need is just outrageous . 
  tyranny is not to bend to the whims of others , it is to impose an unnecessary order so one does as the other pleases . 
  - hrh da mangaka i, 
  i just saw this in / r/tumblrinaction, 
  i wondered when it 'd reach here . 
  huh . 
  these sjw clearly are something , right ? 
  i can grant nevada to you . 
  nevada does kind of seem unwilling to cooperate ( that protest was mainly because classes are being shifted in spanish . 
  california and new mexico are ok with it , but not nevada . 
  small issue there ) . 
  ~ ~ as for panama , it can become another seat for the uop with the following conditions : ~ ~ ( read the stance of the uop . 
  i 've withdrawn this statement therefore ) . 
  ~ ~ - * it shall be held as a protectorate of the empire * ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ panama will become it 's own independent territory but it 's safeguarding will be directly under the wing of the 3rd mexican empire . ~ ~, 
  - * free trade and access will be granted to * ** all ** * nations regardless of alliances *, 
  panama will not be able to negate any transit of goods unless it is in dire threat of it 's sovereignty and safeguarding . 
  if said safeguarding is in stake , the uop will be the first to intervene in peacemaking . 
  if they fail , the mexican empire will be the one to handle it 's protection . 
  - * proposition of a common currency *, 
  given our vast differences in currencies and systems , the 3rd mexican empire proposes the positioning of an exchange system which will keep our currencies intact while interacting with others . 
  this new currency is to be named the ` amero ' and will have a standard of 1 amero = 10 imperial pesos . 
  it is to note that 1 usd is equal to 8 imperial peso ( as before the virus ) which would leave the amero at 1.25 ( bv ) usd, 
  - * peace treaty of nevada *, 
  the mexican empire wishes to keep peace throughout it 's territory and the nations that surround it . 
  in order to do so , a treaty of peace and allegiance is important to consider . 
  this peace treaty - hereby named `` tratado de nevada / peace treaty of nevada '' - should ensure that neither nation will attack the other and will ensure mutual protection . 
  this can be extended to all the nations that will incorporate the north western alliance ( nwa or ano in spanish ... though we are kind of wanting to use another acronym for lingual reasons ... ) . 
  upon approval , this should create the ultimate super power , bringing further peace and prosperity . 
  each member can withdraw from the treaty but will do so with it 's possible consequences . 
  these are the conditions we have reached out . 
  also , please excuse our web news for sending that shameful picture . 
  our senators are still . 
  . iffy . 
  - hrh da mangaka i, 
  i am happy to see what diplomacy is able to do . 
  this is a new world . 
  a new era .
