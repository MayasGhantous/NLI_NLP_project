  there is no time nor need for idiocy ( i 'm looking at you , my senate ) . 
  i also accept a seat in the nwa , hoping to reach new horizons . 
  - hrh da mangaka i, 
  ohhhh . 
  they can be tricky in the electronics/gadget department . 
  both usps and sepomex . 
  though , the only bad experience i had was from usps : i ordered a pokemon emerald from somebody from the us and i only got an open package ) : note that this was us address to us address . 
  always insure stuff that is valuable . 
  \u00a1 \u00bf catorce ?!, 
  my so commented about this existing and i had to give it a shot . 
  suddenly , it 's my # 1 entertainment at work : p, 
  to be honest , the game itself was ok . 
  it offered a new dynamic and a return to the typical 3rd person adventure thing . 
  . but most people bought it for the story and by the goddesses that story was so full of plotholes and nonsensical stuff it made me disappointed to no end . 
  the soundtrack is n't even memorable and that is a big minus for me given that i enjoy videogame soundtrack . 
  i can only rescue 2 songs ( ridley 's remix which was kind of obvious and that piano theme ) and well . 
  utter disappointment of a game . 
  what makes me cringe is that the story was made by the co-creator of metroid - whom presumably should know more of the story ; ; - and he event went to ` kindly ' brush off the prime series as non-canon , even if they were just simply amazing in both game and story wise . 
  i salute you , fellow mewtwo player . 
  not unless it is beans * and * rice . 
  * then * you can ask them to check their privilege and harvest the oppression points . 
  and tortillas . 
  never forget : p, 
  ( ( it 's sad to see this downvoted but , i 'll give it a shot ) ), 
  * the korean peninsula is the host of two proud nations separated by a conflict that happened not too long ago :, 
  in the south , friends with america , lies south korea . 
  he is well known by the nations . 
  sk : i have one of my people as the secretary of the un da ze !, 
  of course , that is because the un is a korean initiative . 
  \\* suddenly chilly *, 
  * however , in the north , lies a much more reserved and dangerous nation . 
  always watching what ever his little brother does , is the nation known to the world as north korea . 
  nk : \\* stares at the viewer with a kind of scary poker face *, 
  * he does n't have friends , but he has strong allies such as russia and china . 
  lately , however . 
  n.k : \\* creeps from behind a sitting china * my . 
  . ally . 
  china : stop bothering me-aruuuuuuuu !!!, 
  china : i ca n't stand him !, 
  i hate him !, 
  i do n't want to be his friend anymore !, 
  chairman !, 
  chairman : we have no other choice . 
  to leave north korea unattended may be catastrophic to us . 
  officer : cheer up . 
  at least you know how to handle him . 
  officer 2 : yeah , what 's the worst that can happen ? 
   japan to secure islands ! <, 
   japanese pm shinzou abe to defend islands from stupid chinese . <, 
  china : what , what . 
  what is this ?!, 
  china : what is the meaning of this-aru ? 
  japan : hmm ? 
  \\* turns slowly * i 'm sorry , but my boss has requested that these islands be under my jurisdiction . 
  china : do n't you have other things to be worrying about ?!, 
  japan : what could you possibly be talking about ? 
  \\* shoves away a lump of glowy material *, 
  america : hello !, 
  ** the hero is here !, 
  china : and now * he 's * here ?!, 
  japan : \\* startled * a-america-san . 
  w-what are you doing here ? 
  i heard that you were threatened by china , so i came here to help you not fight . 
  that 's what heroes do . 
  china : b-but * he 's * the one who started it !!!, 
  japan : ^ i ^ do n't ^ think ^ this ^ is ^ the ^ most ^ appropriate ^ thing ^ to ^ do ^ at ^ this ^ moment, 
  china : you are both idiots !, 
  s.k : guys !!!, 
  i 'm in a bit of a trouble here ; ; ; ;, 
  japan : e-eh ? 
  china : not you too !!, 
  america : turn on the tv already !, 
   we are live with the latest announcement regarding north korea and their intentions to attack . 
  n.k : \\* looms * i will go visit my brother soon . 
  we shall be one at last . 
  . we shall be one . 
  we shall be one . 
  we shall be one . 
  see what i mean ?!, 
  china : how is this possible-aru ? 
  japan : everyone . 
  look !, 
  \\* points at the background behind nk , showing a nuclear missile *, 
  america : what about that rocket ? 
  ~ that 's a rocket ?!, 
  america : alright !, 
  team america , assembleeeeeeeeeeeee !, 
  japan : that is * not * the appropriate thing to do at this moment . 
  china : i 'm sick and tired of him-aru !, 
  young soo , give me that phone . 
  i will call him off . 
  s.k : i 'm sorry , but he cut down the phone line ; ; ; ; ; \\* panicked smile *, 
  china/america : he did ** what ** ?!, 
  j.officer : sir !, 
  we have detected a missile launch on course to this place . 
  america : that 's it !, 
  we are going in !, 
  china : i 'm not going to let you do that-aru !!,
