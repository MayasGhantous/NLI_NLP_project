  chats about the world as either understands it , rants about how stupid some things are and just talk all night until one falls asleep . 
  then you wake up . 
  there 's nobody there . 
  however , you smile when you realize the extra cup by your night table . 
  that 'd be rather cool . 
  if there 's anything about cats that has been already exposed is the fact that the owners seem to be more the cat 's pet . 
  so , i suppose this would apply here as well . 
  oh for f * cks sake texas !, 
  first you secede for us in mexico and now you want to leave the us ? 
  make up your mind already !, 
  yup, 
  como entrenadora pokemon , me ardi\u00f3 demaciado . 
  if anybody is interested , the term can be translated into ` g\u00fcey ' if using spanish . 
  everyone is one : p, 
  \u2611 female, 
  \u2611 mexican, 
  \u2611 kind of likes to talk to herself, 
  \u2611 does n't really give a damn about genders, 
  \u2611 possible pigeon-kin, 
  i suppose i can collect my oppression points , right ? 
  wait ... l4d2 ... for free ?!, 
  why was n't i informed of this ? 
  i was out for most of the time that was going on . 
  but it 's ok , there will be another time . 
  mexican here . 
  . do n't let another '68 happen ever again . 
  may i ask what a strawman is in this context ? 
  i 'm still new to this . 
  i know that feeling . 
  i have a legit mystry mew that is shiny . 
  i made a pokecheck and it 's legit so far . 
  i was worried since it 's known that event pokemon can not be shiny but i have also heard that some of the toys-r-us events back in gen iii , employees could give you a shiny one . 
  ca n't say if the rumor is true or not but i 'm super happy for my blue mew = v =, 
  i 'm kind of afraid how the pressure from the sjw is * actually * creating some sort of newspeak in the media ; ;, 
  there is a saying that we have become way too sensible/ease to insult these days ... 
  the ** united ** mexican ** states ** would like to have a word with you . 
  also , for the sake of simplicity , we do have words to describe you guys : it 's either the polite ` estadounidense ' or the better known ` gringo ' . 
  stfu . 
  please . . 
  * flash edit : * i ** dare ** you to call a north korean like that . 
  i ** double dare ** you . 
  they are * korean * because in their mindset they are still one country divided ~ ~ by the imperialist bastards ~ ~, 
  so , please ... do go tell them they are north korean . 
  they 'll take it but glare at you . 
  btw , the correct name is `` democratic people 's republic of korea '' . 
  i do n't know where the heck you got the ` north ' from . 
  i suppose you barely know anything about the world at this point . 
  . i 'll stick with united statian or ` statian ' until i find something that does n't eat the whole continent for such country 's sake . 
  maybe you 're from france ? 
  ~ ~ or you are one of those rebel jedi ? ~ ~, 
  are n't you the ` people 's republic of china ' ? 
  not really . 
  allow me to give you a somewhat long lesson in history . 
  ever since the aztecs , the place they lived on was called mexico-tenochtitlan . 
  in fact , their race was meant to be called ` mexicas ' by the wills of their gods ( but was never really recorded as their main name for some reason ) . 
  the spanish came , conquered and very ingeniously called us new spain . 
  once we became independent , we became the ** mexican empire ** ... which failed . 
  because ... fuck politicians and their . 
  but my point is , we have * always * been mexico . 
  our pursuit for democracy ( a la gringa ) made us adopt as our official name the whole ` united mexican states ' thing . 
  heck , we are a republic right now ( we are actually more used to the name ` mexican republic ' or ` rep\u00fablica mexicana ' ) but the whole point is that * we have always been mexico * \\* ultimate le shrug *, 
  going back to the states : the united states have almost * always * referred itself as ' [ united states ] ( http://freedomslighthouse.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/us_senate_seal.jpg ) ' only . 
  i 'm not saying the name is incorrect ( the whole united states of america thing ) but to the rest of the american nations and given their history with said country . 
  kind of stings . 
  now , i do refer american people as american because people frown at me for saying ` united statian ' though also for simplicity sake because it 's actually correct ( as them also being part of the continent ) . 
  all in all , american is an inclusive term for all the continent , not just the us itself ( after all , they are ` of america ' . 
  they are part of it , not all of it as whole . 
  ~ ~ i 'm looking at you , manifest destiny ... ~ ~ ), 
  \\* dies *, 
  not any at all , but from what i 've read and seen on certain documentaries , they are n't really that fond of being referred as ` north koreans ' . 
  again , it is n't technically wrong but within their philosophy as nation and all , they are still one nation even though they are divided . 
  they do refer the south koreans as ` the - insert propagandist slur here - southerners ' or something of that kind but under their own propaganda world they are still one country . 
  ( which is why n.korea does n't recognize s.korea . 
  i am not particularly sure if it goes the other way around as well ) . 
  unless i am mistaken , of course . 
  i do plan to go to north korea one of these days . 
  oh , * that * republic of china . 
  you win . 
  i 'll give you a cookie . 
  my opinion is n't exactly popular right now ; ; ;, 
  i 'll suppose i 'll retreat to that corner of shame over there . 
  i am now confused . 
  also , fine . 
  i was retarded . 
  please excuse my retardiness . 
  no need to blaster me and put more comments on how retarded i was t _ t ;, 
  well , in english there is no other alternative but american . 
  we do have one in spanish that is `` estadounidense '' . 
  i suppose i 'll use both in their appropiate context then . 
  see people ? 
  admiting you are wrong wo n't kill you . 
  you actually learn more from your mistakes . 
  / * psa brought to you by tia *, 
  mold plz, 
  i had this happen to me once . 
  wasted at least 5 minutes on all that, 
  you know , the whole key thing so happened to come up in [ one of my dashboards today ] ( http://aubrey-plasma.tumblr.com/post/71949997425/everchangingworlds-queerassfolks-tips-for ), 
  i wonder just how well they 'd do reaching those key points ( pun not intended ) . 
  . . . autistic people explode stuff with their minds ? 
  i like to buy dinner to my male friends at times and i 'm a girl .
