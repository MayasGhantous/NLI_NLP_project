  + fedoratip / u/wrestlingisgood 9000 fedoras,

  tijuanense here , ready to help you . 
  as / u/dillon06 has said , once you cross the border , grab a taxi that takes you to zona r\u00edo . 
  you 'll find the best places in tijuana for shop and eating . 
  while he did say to avoid ave revoluci\u00f3n , there are some parts to be rescued specially if you are into the growing art scene that is blooming over here . 
  as for food , tacos . 
  tacos are the # 1 food in tijuana . 
  to my surprise , when i visited mexico city and surrounded areas , i was confused not to find as many taco shops/restaurants as i 'm used here . 
  that 's when i realized why the taco ( at least the carne asada taco ) is regarded as a typical tijuana food . 
  you can go to any corner to find one or go to ` las humarelas ' to find a street riddled with taquerias . 
  you can not disregard another typical tijuana meal which is the caesar salad ( served at hotel caesars in ave revolucion ) . 
  it 's 80 pesos ( around 6.50 usd ) and it 's prepared and served just in front of you . 
  fish tacos are great but i 'd rather recommend you to head to playas de tijuana or rosarito if you are venturous . 
  there are many places to go and eat but i 'll let you know what i think it 's be the best . 
  ** places to go **, 
  plaza rio - the oldest and best known mall in tijuana . 
  you can find stores , groceries , restaurants and ~ ~ a mime ~ ~ ( um ... scratch that ), 
  cecut ( tijuana cultural center ) - the name is self explanatory . 
  here you can find expositions , a small museum with the history of the region , a video club and an aquarium !, 
  let 's not forget the imax theater inside ` la bola ' . 
  mercado hidalgo - if you are looking for real mexican ti-bits to take home , mercado hidalgo is your place . 
  this is the area from where all the food arrives . 
  you can find some few restaurants ( if i remember correctly ) but mostly you 'll find from fresh produce from farms to herbal remedies for anything you need . 
  * centro *, 
  pasaje rodriguez - it 's a small street packed with art , cafes and sometimes some performances . 
  you can get some nice t-shirts from local designers starting 200 pesos which are unlike your typical mexican curio . 
  parque teniente guerrero - chillax at the oldest park in the city . 
  plaza galerias - the most ` uff ' of the malls available , it is a brand new ( compared to other plazas ) and fully loaded with stuff to do . 
  there 's a koi pond , cinemas , shops , and it 's just in front of caliente : the biggest casino chain in mexico . 
  hip\u00f3dromo caliente - this is perhaps one of the oldest vestiges of tijuana . 
  it 's a huge casino which has a greyhound racing area , machines and the stadium that hosts the xolos . 
  - there 's a new mall around ` las torres ' ( small twin towers that are easy to find in the area ) . 
  i 'm not sure how it 's called or what it has there . 
  it does look nice from the outside , though . 
  ** restaurants **, 
  * mexican *, 
  [ restaurante el mexicano ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/ypcwz ) - well , you want mexican food ? 
  why not go to a restaurant called ` el mexicano ' ? 
  it offers almost anything you can imagine mexican food is : tacos , enchiladas , tamales ( on season ) , mole . 
  you can sit by the bar or at the table . 
  i recommend the bar so you can see them working on your food . 
  it 's fantastic . 
  they are * great * in their breakfasts btw . 
  las humarelas - in front of `` el mexicano '' lies a hospital . 
  on the left side ( this is pretty much how we give directions in mexico , be warned ) you 'll find a street packed with taco stands . 
  called ` las humarelas ' ( from ` smokey ' as in it will get smokey due how many taco stands there are ) you can find tacos of any kind and at different prices . 
  i do n't have a favorite here . 
  it 's up to you . 
  tacos are around 1 usd each . 
  * fish *, 
  [ tito 's ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/tfdg9 ) - well known in playas de tijuana , the restaurant gets packed ! . 
  there is a setup here you must know though : if you eat inside you 'll get a selection of seafood . 
  if you are outside , you 'll get fish tacos !, 
  delicious !, 
  there are various styles and other kinds of sea food used but it 's really good ! . 
  * pasta *, 
  [ restaurant caesars ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/gc0nt ) - located in hotel caesars , it is the home of the caesar salad . 
  prices are rather cheap in most dishes and they have an outdoor dining place so you can see ave revolution as you eat . 
  [ saverios ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/s1byq ) - located in the ` restaurant area ' in paseo de los heroes , this is perhaps one of the most expensive restaurants in the city . 
  but it 's worth it . 
  i think the chef is from the city . 
  if you can , you should give it a shot . 
  also , do the following when visiting ( for safety reasons ) :, 
  * do n't wear anything that is too shiny/attractive . 
  [ use a bag that is closed with zippers ] ( http://www.wenger.ch/belp-boarding-bag-sa18262166 ) so what ever guy wants to take your stuff has a difficult time from swiping it from ya . 
  * if using a taxi libre ( white with orange lines , please . 
  or maybe a yellow cab like those you find after you cross to tj ) * do * write the name and the number of the cab . 
  you never know . 
  * if you wish to use the phone , you can find many small businesses that sell you cheap cellphones with air time included . 
  you can also head to telcel ( there 's one in plaza rio ) to buy a chip you can put to your phone or ask for any way you can use yours . 
  you may also check for roaming rates with your carrier before heading south . 
  * i can not stress this enough but ** buy pesos ** . 
  try * not * to use dollars . 
  the exchange rate might look fixed but restaurants and taxi cabs are known to make ` micro scams ' by giving you a lesser value for your money . 
  atm , the usd to mxn rate is 1 usd = 12.88 if buying usd and 1 usd = 12.79 if selling them . 
  as a bonus , the further you are from the border , the cheaper they are in their exchanges . 
  ** always ask if they charge a commission even if there 's a bloody banner saying `` no commission '' **, 
  * it is ok to say no to the curios vendors . 
  the best way is to say `` no gracias '' and move along . 
  nobody will die , do n't worry . 
  * i hate to say this but ** do n't trust the police ** . 
  i mean , they are n't bad or anything but it 's best not to make a hassle with them . 
  most of the time , they 'll look for trouble in order to get some money out from you ( via bribing so you do n't go to jail , etc ) . 
  avoid them like a plague unless they seem trustworthy enough . 
  have a 100 pesos bill prepared if you really need to shake them off . 
  hope this helps !, 
  i can make a small comic about it . 
  it 's as much as i can offer .

  i have only started in dogecoin but i am not sure if i 'm doing it right .
