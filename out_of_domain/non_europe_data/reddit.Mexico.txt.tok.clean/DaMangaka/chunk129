  it 's taking almost a day to sync the official wallet , i have an android one but dunno what to do with it and the miners i 've downloaded come as `` malicious '' on my avg . 
  i really wan na mine on my laptop but this is becoming a bit confusing = v = ; ; ;, 
  tijuanense here . 
  huh ... so you - have - heard of us . 
  ca n't say if it 's good you know us for such things . 
  i suddenly had the urge to blaze it . 
  realizing i had nothing like that close by , i decided to drink 1 carton of cans of mountain dew while proving my fundie family that god does n't exist . 
  in other words , i was suddenly euphoric . 
  i wonder if they considered cuar\u00f3n among the poc ... 
  to be honest , as a mexican , i actually find chipotle to be close to the real thing . 
  i enjoy their burritos though i am disturbed at the lack of lemon and chili . 
  i 'm also interested in this regard . 
  i 'll send you an e-mail soon . 
  what does the last one mean ? 
  i actually made a sort of fanfic about what happened to her . 
  let 's say she did n't make it , but she did n't die . 
  she 's the only one who remembers seeing the castle but nobody believes her because those who went there had their memories erased . 
  so she sets off in a long quest to become strong enough to face that pokemon master . 
  never finished it though ; ; ;, 
  i am still learning from this whole doge-thing and hope to have a seat for when this reaches the moon . 
  in the mean time , please help this poor shibe : (, 
  also , how do you do the ` shibe ' text in here ? 
  [ i 'll just leave this here ] ( http://youtu.be/mcigc-g_irg ), 
  according to the title and what has been reported to a very respected newswoman in mexico , that you hear ( see is practically impossible due to it being in the dark and at night ) are the mexican armed forces shooting at the people composing/supporting the mexican vigilantes group . 
  4 people died , among them an 11 year old girl . 
  the youtube title alludes that these armed forces were sent by none other than the interior secretary osorio chong . 
  tagged for later . 
  [ ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) ] ( https://images.encyclopediadramatica.es/8/81/intensifying_doge.gif ), 
  i tried it like this :, 
  . / cgminer -- scrypt - o stratum + tcp : / / doge .247 mining.com :3333 - u username.worker - p password, 
  but it 'll just blink and vanish : |, 
  this shibe is a thankful shibe, 
  it 's an old laptop actually so i have n't checked that up . 
  i suppose the answer is no given that i have never opened it to mod it in any way . 
  according to my device manager , it 's an `` ati mobility radeon hd 4200 '', 
  basically it 's your ` default ' video card . 
  this is an 2 old rescued laptop ( kind of new , never really used due to it * missing an ac cord * ) and i have n't done anything to it hardware wise . 
  sot it 's default by default . 
  toshiba satellite l505d if that 's needed . 
  let me try 3.7.2, 
  i think i 'll end up building a cpu just for mining in any case : p, 
  yay !, 
  [ it appears it has worked !, 
  as for the airplane thing , to be honest it has always made that kind of noise when i work on photoshop/illustrator on it : p, 
  thanks so much !, 
  let 's see if i get this right . 
  i think i 'll let it run while i go to work . 
  i get back at home like at 8pm . 
  so at least i 'll get 50 dog more or less ( maybe . . who knows . 
  . . ^ i ^ have ^ a ^ lot ^ of ^ expectations ^ ... 
  thanks so much for your help !, 
  i 'll check the link tomorrow . 
  time for this shibe to sleep, 
  i got a bitcoin tip a long time ago but the first crypto coin i have fully engaged on is dogecoin, 
  mexican here . 
  i have yet to find a decent place outside of mexico that serves what * we * classify as mexican food . 
  and even if there was said thing , fucks that would be given would be 0 . 
  if anything , we 'd be impressed . 
  now if you excuse me , i 'll eat a caesar salad . 
  but magic no relevant in fairy tales . 
  only feels are to be noticed . 
  did you know that [ tacos al pastor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al_pastor ) was basically what happened when lebanese came with their food and we just so happen to roll it in a tortilla ? 
  so , am i culturally appropriating lebanese food by eating tacos al pastor ? 
  or can i shrug it off as a mexican who by default falls into poc category ? 
  wow shittywatercolor, 
  such art, 
  lots of epicness wow, 
  to the moon !, 
  i wonder if lambie is interested in going south the border for a bit of an adventure = v = \\* wink *, 
  it is an easy choice , do n't you think ? 
  it is also a bit of an irony in this ever changing world , allow me to explain : for centuries , men have perfected the art , weapons and tactics of war . 
  they change depending the subject , the army , the resources and the terrain they are to face . 
  it is foolish to think that you can take down the harshness of a russian winter with the summer rush of a blitzkrieg or that you can endure swampy traps with a bulky tank . 
  nyet , that is why you plan ahead , you learn , you evolve , you survive . 
  through out all the weapons and arsenals created and modified , there has n't been anything close to the beauty in my hands . 
  fast , precise and so maneuverable . 
  you can use it on land and while riding the skies . 
  under the rain or snow , dusty winds . 
  easy to clean , easy to load . 
  that is kalashnikova . 
  but that is not just why i have chosen it as my faithful companion . 
  any weapon can become obsolete , or can become more powerful than this one . 
  but they will not be as meaningful as this one . 
  to me , this represents what i most adore in the world : revolution . 
  since it 's creation , it has been a key and symbol of rebellion , of change , of freedom . 
  freedom not like said amerikans aspire , but one of brothers and sisters waking up , rising up and fighting for an ideal . 
  it is inspirational , reliable , / real / . 
  wars should n't be fought nowadays , it is true . 
  but when it is needed , at least i know i have somebody i can trust . 
  i know it wo n't let me down . 
  it will never leave my side . 
  the weapon of my core , revolution incarnated , that is the reason of my choice . 
  applied . 
  thanks so much for the opportunity : d, 
  graphic designer here . 
  fuck them . 
  use comic sans . 
  nope ... you are not from my country ... 
  i refuse to belive there are mexican sjw . 
  nope nope nope ...
