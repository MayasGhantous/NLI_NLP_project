  i wan na go to north korea too !, 
  let 's go together : d, 
  i was born ready . 
  in fact , and i 'm not joking , ever since i 've known about the place i 've * dreamed * of going there . 
  really , just having odd dreams of being there , walking around and being impressed by a land stuck in time . 
  also , this little voice telling me to go before i am 35 because `` things will change by then and the experience wo n't be the same '' . 
  ~ ~ kind of creepy my obsessiveness i have over that place . ~ ~, 
  another place i 'm obsessed with going is kaliningrad . 
  sadly/fortunately it 's no longer a closed city but i need to go there . 
  though that 's mainly due some * fanfiction * i 'm making !, 
  i do n't like to throw out things on any of the stories that i write if i 'm not well informed of the subject and to talk about a certain place i need to have gone there or know somebody from there . 
  the language too ( german | russian | old prussian ) , food . 
  i can get quite obsessive . 
  yeah . 
  ~ ~ i 'm fucking crazy man ! ~ ~, 
  wait , they did what ? 
  let 's save some money and let 's roll !, 
  when did this air ? 
  i did n't see it this super bowl < _ <, 
  i 'll see what i can do in the weekend . 
  i 'm interested . 
  samborn 's , is that you ? 
  california would become so ashamed ... . 
  do it !, 
  it 's until july ? 
  i dunno , i thought you 'd be excited, 
  based ?

  these are trends that are comming up upom switching to mexico 's trends , more specifically the ones in my city . 
  i am sadly * not * making them up . 
  they are depending on where your location . 
  they can go as far as `` worldwide '' or local ( your city ) . 
  i currently have it set to my city 's tt, 
  more `` pe\u00f1abots '' with torta and frutsis huh ? 
  why must they use these hashtags . 
  it 's ridiculous the amount of trends they use to sway away from what it 's happening in our government that in the end we get knowing . 
  i am just glad * most * people seem unhappy and have highjacked the tts . 
  shows how supportive mexico is with the lgtbq . 
  i just wish these trends would stop . 
  our government is trying so hard to cover the sun with a finger it 's pathetic ... 
  as a mexican , i 'll humbly decline texas . 
  you guys left us so ... stay with your people there . 
  we 'll take austin and houston though, 
  i do remember reading a book about nazi atrocities and about a woman that would go around the camps and when she saw a prisoner with a nice tattoo , she would get him skinned and made lamps with them . 
  and i think soap too . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's the same woman but that kind of fascinated me in a morbid way . 
  i was 13 back then . 
  nice book to be brought to a `` reading club '' at a catholic school , i say . 
  * sigh * and the sad part is that , even if he would n't have died here and he would have been successful in becoming president , he would have been killed nonetheless . 
  that 's how mexican politics is : if you are good , you are good as dead . 
  i think you 'll apreciate ichimura 's take on mewtwo . 
  so godly ... 
  brb , photoshop, 
  til there is a subreddit for people banned from / r/pyongyang, 
  noooone can triforce !!!, 
  half life 3 ... confirmed ? 
  as a mexican , i want to know how you guys did it . 
  you know , he could at least hire some cheap graphic designers to do a decent video . 
  heck , most of the youtube vlogers do better content than him : / . 
  i know these videos are meant to be menacing but the way they are done makes me just sigh and click another thing . 
  my father calls the frys store `` disneyland '' due what a wonderful electronics place is : p, 
  sadly it 's too `` far away '' in san diego , which would n't be a problem if our car would n't be so unstable . 
  i 'd become an intergalactic time traveler by the name of jean ` takashi ' delacroix . 
  i could also go and use this power to kill every asshole leader in the world , starting with the one in my country ... and the senate . 
  heck , let 's just burn their hq, 
  this seems like they are developing an arg . 
  go to the movies and hang around in the city . 
  there is a reason nightmare is called nightmare ... 
  i was disappointed at the mom version though . 
  . , i expected more ~ ~ in overall of the game actually ~ ~, 
  to be honest , i saw tron : legacy as the 2nd movie daft punk had made , the other one being `` interstella 5555 '' . 
  if you see it that way , the movie becomes incredibly more epic . 
  or you just say you hate club america and you 're off . 
  though , tbh , the america is full of douches ... 
  the strict `` atheism '' made by elias calles ( who was atheist ) was due him interpretating the 1917 constitution * too * literately in regards to church and state .
