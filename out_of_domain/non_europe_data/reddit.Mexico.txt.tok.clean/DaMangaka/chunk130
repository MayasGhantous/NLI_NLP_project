  \\* sigh * who am i kidding ? 
  they are everywhere , right ? 
  i was just about to post that part xd, 
  now * where * do i start ? 
  for my first round , i 'll pick esmeralda , cindy and belle . 
  b-but . 
  . . that 's what * i * am doing . 
  every day . 
  for at least 12 hrs while i go to work + gym . 
  ** i 'm insane **, 
  hey , i 'd wish there was doge or even * any * kind of crypto coin back when i was 8 . 
  it 's a good way to teach him about the economy too and how it works . 
  how to spend his well earned money/doge , etc. 
  just make sure he does n't blow up his computer . 
  i kind of did that to my win 95 comp when i was 8 by accident : p, 
  . . this is the finest rig-porn i 've ever seen . 
  it makes me want to do my own ... once i get enough money perhaps = v = ; ; ;, 
  do i get a tip too ? 
  so you are saying that the person in the picture is * not a girl * ? 
  alright !, 
  that sounds awesome !, 
  they did the same in the # 1dmx in mexico . 
  the ` anarchists ' burned businesses and cars and the media focused on them solely . 
  i would be glad to help . 
  my usual rates are 20usd per hour . 
  do n't know how much that 's in \u0110, 
  let 's do this !, 
  ohhh . 
  seems i have stuff to do now : d, 
  i only mine like 50\u0110 a day at most in my feeble laptop . 
  this whole thing makes me feel a bit worried . 
  i ca n't invest in anything like that !, 
  that 's pretty much why i jumped off the bitcoin boat ( and swam to shore ), 
  funny thing is that my first date was a mtf from okcupid . 
  she was nice but not my type : /, 
  i do hope she 's ok since she told me she was having troubles at her family while she was transitioning . 
  i suppose it depends from person to person . 
  i first signed in due to the quizzes : /, 
  eventually i met my so and dropped off completely . 
  though it 's incredible to see how people seem so desperate on online date sites < _ <, 
  it 's only for the us : (, 
  it does n't seem to have an option for mexico yet . 
  yes !, 
  it is !, 
  and i actually need to start working on something ^ ^ ; ;, 
  what can i do for you ? 
  sure , pm away ! . 
  hello !, 
  somebody referred me to this link/project in one of my weekly '' ~ ~ bother ~ ~ ask the doge community '' posts . 
  i noticed that you do n't have support for mexico . 
  do you contact the carriers per country or is it a different system ? 
  i 'm very interested on this . 
  this might be something that can genuinely help a lot of people around here . 
  here , have some more, 
  here 's for a bunch of carrots and noodles . 
  yay !, 
  that is awesome !, 
  thanks . 
  if this tip is good , go ahead and take it : telcel is the most flexible carrier for these kind of services so far and the # 1 in mexico ( thank you mr. 
  slim ... ) after that comes movistar and iusacel . 
  just a heads up, 
  good luck on your endeavor fellow shibe . 
  may you reach the moon soon !, 
  make it three . 
  never met him either : /, 
  considering the shitty economical policies of my country , i too wish that dogecoin be used instead of pesos/dollars . 
  i must begin to spread the word . 
  hello and welcome to dogecoin !, 
  hope you have packed all your stuff , because we are in our one way trip to the moon ! . 
  have fun !,

  managed to get 200\u0110 cpu mining for 5 days . 
  i think i know what to do, 
  noooo !, 
  i 'll save it as my wallpaper : d, 
  but . . . 
  how would that work ? 
  i can mine up to 1k in coins . 
  . by using 2 of my workplace 's computers and my laptop . 
  though , my pool just died : (, 
  any place you can suggest ? 
  wrong !!!!,
