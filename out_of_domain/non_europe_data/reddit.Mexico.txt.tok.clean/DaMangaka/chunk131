  but . 
  what about fat files ? 
  is that another appropriation ? 
  mexican here . 
  can any latin american confirm that we got it too or are we stuck with the us ? 
  ~ ~ not that it matters since i have my ds registered as being from california ~ ~, 
  the legion of hawlucha is paving it 's way to there , my brothers !, 
  we will power-punch and fly press the hell out of them ! . 
  . then we 'll do a u-turn . 
  ) : / hmmm ... 
  so , i 'll be the one looking stupid at asking this but : how do you * buy * dogecoins ? 
  all i 've been doing is mining in my poor and crappy laptop . 
  i have 50 d so far = v = ; ; ;, 
  it was given to me so i ca n't really prove otherwise . 
  from what i know , there * are * legit english version shiny mystry mews . 
  i even did a pokecheck back when it was on my white and came out clean . 
  i do n't know , i just like to see it on 3d . 
  it 's also something nice to see for those shiny collectors . 
  aw man : (, 
  at least you can still see the cute little critter in all of it 's shiny glory . 
  granted , this little one wo n't be going anywhere . 
  it has a close space in my heart as my first shiny legendary . 
  my only one , actually . 
  sad to see it 's just fake . 
  while in mexico we did have zoicite and fisheye voiced by females , uranus and neptune were shown as a couple ( with the odd addition that haruka 's voice sounded a bit deeper as a civil ) , hotaru did see the couple as mom/dad ( which was cute ) , the sailor stars season was shown with the three lights/starlights doing their thing and we had ep 200 's naked usagi/serena . 
  i just * love * the 90s in mexico , where anime was taken from the source and not from the munched/processed versions the us utilized . 
  i think there is now a revival of this method but it 's not by all chances `` cheap '' as it used to . 
  on the other hand , i always saw it to be a cool power to be able to transform into the other gender . 
  i suppose seiya kou was my first lgbt anime crush and i was jealous she/he could do that : p, 
  i 'll be hoping for this very anxiously . 
  sailor moon was one of my fav series growing up . 
  we do call it `` dia del amor y la amistad '' over here ( love and friendship day ) . 
  so i suppose that covers it \\* shrug *, 
  i saw this and i squealed . 
  got really excited , i must say . 
  good for them : d, 
  how or where do you ( suggest to ) buy dogecoins ? 
  i 've been interested in this given that mining via laptop is rather hard : (, 
  damn !, 
  you beat me to it !, 
  no mention about doge or anything about a sponsor though : (, 
  they did recall the movie from the last time they went xd, 
  i live in mexico but have an american bank account . 
  does that count as us/canada for satoshi ? 
  where is that at ? 
  is it a website ? 
  thank you : d, 
  tijuana counts ? 
  love the ascii art : d,

  such a kind shibe ; ; v ; ;, 
  i ... actually * wanted * them to kick me out of there . 
  i earned like 120 usd bucks a week : /, 
  granted , by mexican standards ... is not even ok ... 
  but given the minimum wage of 60 mxn a day ... 
  now , i can finally pursue my dream of becoming a ~ ~ crappy ~ ~ mangaka or t-shirt designer . 
  i do n't know . 
  i just wish to draw as a living : p, 
  btw , i forgot to tip : p, 
  verily tip so, 
  of course , young shibe . 
  wow such tip, 
  very generous,

  there 's also a saying that `` giving is the best way to receive bountifully '', 
  so here = v = < 3,

  that 's ok . 
  i actually wanted to get rid of it \u2310 v \u2310 ; ;, 
  it is no problem , fellow shibe .

  that 's ok ^ ^ /, 
  i 'll get something better later on .
