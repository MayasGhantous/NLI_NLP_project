  there were at least 80 movies made for last year and only 4 of them made it to theaters . 
  the rest were just shamed and shown in horrible time tables and short periods or shelved away . 
  fuck you , mexican media and theaters , stop circlejerking about how awesome this win is when you do n't fucking help the art grow . 
  cuar\u00f3n had to get out of the country to do what you wo n't let other epic mexican directors do . 
  * on the topic of nyong ` o : she was born in mexico city , however ** she does not ** consider herself mexican . 
  of course , the media ( not sure if us/mex or what ever ) are loving to point out that she is mexican-kenyan when she has clearly stated she is not . 
  i am not rolling into this topic because to be frank i did n't knew she existed until today . . or her nationality for that matter . 
  * speaking more about her win , my twitter feed was infested with sjw circlejerking about her oscar and how she was so kind in dedicating the award to the slaves and blah blah . 
  yeah , we get it people , she is black . 
  she won an award . 
  so what ? 
  people that do good things get an award regardless of colour . 
  good for her . 
  then again , she is ** a strong poc womyn who ai n't need a man ** so i guess this was the sjw 's victory too . 
  i did n't get too many against leto which was good since my sister is a huge fan of his . 
  * i barely follow any people in tumblr to report what happened there . 
  * ** super quick adding/edit ** : apparently , somebody in / r/ainbow made [ a rambling about leto ` blackfacing ' trans * people ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/1zdkw1/jared_letos_performance_was_basically_blackface/ ) . 
  that 's my report on the oscars . 
  back to you , jim !, 
  as a mexican , i can pretty much assure you they go in dry . 
  the difference is that mexico is pretty much a masochist by this point . 
  living in soca/bc , i can confirm that the ` super storm ' that was so much announced was as disappointing as a shyamalan film, 
  challenge accepted, 
  i actually read other of the author 's comics presented on the page and i have to say : what am i reading ? 
  at least this gives me hope my webcomic wo n't suck ... 
  ftfy, 
  * russian might not be properly spelled though *, 
  tip to piss of mexicans : while ` mejico ' and ` mejicanos ' is actually gramatically correct , never spell it like that while around mexicans or else they 'll consider you a `` pinche espa\u00f1ol de mierda '', 
  ist gud , do n't worry . 
  just a funny fact thrown there . 
  i just enjoy people talking spanish here all of a sudden . 
  and we all know our pronouns are shitlord/shitlord/shitlord : p, 
  burrito should keep attract : (, 
  we should get rid of sand attack instead . 
  i do n't think she knows that the aztecs used to have monarchs/tlatoanis and sometimes they were n't better than the spaniards . 
  there is a reason the tlaxcaltecas joined the spanish in the battle against them . 
  then again how can i , an actual mexican , refute to the logic of an empowering latin @ mind ? 
  way to traumatize and actually beat the crap out of her dreams and his sign of well being ... 
  one of my close friends rebloged this . 
  should i worry ? 
  while there is indeed good discussion have a look at the poll itself . 
  it 's rather interesting on that side . 
  of course , you can also see gems like, 
   i am female and the answer is obvious : violation . 
  human . 
  being . 
  not . 
  object . 
  should have added `` tw : sanity '' but i was n't sure . 
  this is quite cool actually . 
  i 'm still setting a portfolio online but you [ can check my blog ] ( http://gslucky.tumblr.com ) and check out my style . 
  sent a pm, 
  hey there !, 
  i 'd like to give it a try !, 
  pm me for info !, 
  numbah 5 ready for action !, 
  i 'm not sure but i can head to the place the atm is at and record myself using it . 
  i 'll report back to you then : d, 
  til i 'm not a woman . 
  does that give me privilege points then ? 
  wow !, 
  such exitement !, 
  very racing !, 
  much awesomeness !, 
  for november, 
  ** my body is ready **, 
  fuck ssb4 , i 'm ready for my trumpet infested ocean . 
  no escape from shadow tag, 
  i 'll have to say that hoenn is my favorite region * because * of the soundtrack . 
  inb4 `` moar trumpets '' jokes , this was a really well orchestrated game that knew when to be cutsey and relaxed , epic and grand or soft and emotional . 
  the only pieces remarkably close to hoenn are in gen v with n 's theme , the bridge village and some other like that but mostly it 's techno-ey . 
  not that it 's bad but ... 
  i guess i am really attached to this ost . 
  i hope they do n't try to remake it ( as in fr/gl to which imho tried to make them too grand ) and just polish it enough for this new generation . 
  ~ ~ ** bring up some trumpets !, 
  \u00d5 _ \u00d3, 
  come to tijuana . 
  we have drive thru tacos to satisfy your highs . 
  * this message was brought to you by the bureau of turism of baja california *, 
   what a shame following the same team of that guy ... 
  ftfy, 
  there 's / r/techoblanco and / r/mexicocirclejerk for mexico . 
  i 'm not sure which one is the official one though . 
  / r/mexico sure acts like a circlejerk of it 's own at times, 
  til i 'm a rapist . 
  and probably made others likewise, 
  is my astronomy hobby going to be ruined by these people too ? 
  while in space none can hear you scream ( since it 's a vacumm and all ) , i can certainly hear the bitching about something no intelligent xenoform could give fucks for . 
  today , my toucan has died . 
  rip chatot . 
  mexican chiming here . 
  you automatically loose your man card and become * puto * if you seek for help . 
  so , no . 
  you know , that 's exactly how much i owed for a class i took . 
  i have payed it with fiverr gigs . 
  i 'm sure it ca n't get easier than that . 
  i saw the whole thing and i am ready to make a full podcast-like rant at . 
  what kept me going through out the whole thing was that i was trying to find the most important element of all of this : ** the plot ** . 
  i know what the story is about but they have no plot to work on and just the little ti-bits and subplots ca n't add up or work up . 
  i did n't care for anybody except for the token white male cis : / .
