  i 'm sorry , but after this i 'm just going to enclose myself in my room and write `` cyber wars '' . 
  i am open to podcast suggestions/recording . 
  wait ... 
  i thought it was something unique that mexicans hated their own country ... 
  there 's an option in the game where you can mute them completely . 
  you can add me if you want . 
  i saw !, 
  congrats on the shiny !, 
  you know , you are the second guy i know that gets a shiny on my safari in that record time . 
  the first one got a shiny kirlia : p, 
  do these people even know what `` for the lulz '' means ? 
  it kind of is worse at some point : there are many reports the mexican government actively works * with * and * for * the drug cartels , mostly when it comes to human traficking cases . 
  there is a very thin line between a typical corrupt politician and one with strong ties with drug lords and organized crime . 
  source : i am mexican . 
  have an uptrumpet for speaking the truth, 
  for some reason , i had always assumed efs to be a girl . 
  so , sorry for misgendering you , oh great overlord, 
  i did n't want to post in this specific post because i 'm still very sour about mexico 's loss in this match . 
  i could make a rant post about why i am angry about that last goal but i actually want to point out to a funny [ thread i found in gaia online ] ( http://www.gaiaonline.com/forum/2014-fifa-world-cup/so-much-racial-appropriation/t.92895993/ ) just after the game . 
  it could be relevant for this and i just found it funny enough to chill out . 
  [ this other post ] ( http://www.gaiaonline.com/forum/2014-fifa-world-cup/the-official-hug-mexico-thread-please/t.92896507_7/#7 ) is also related . 
  really , as much as i love futbol and my country , i really do n't want any sjws on board ruining it more for me : /, 
  yes , we do banter but not like this . 
  we know europe has a better life quality than us . 
  and really , we are more angry at the referees than the actual dutch players . 
  it 's really interesting . 
  thanks fellow shibe . 
  + / u/dogetipbot 100 doge verify, 
  signal boost for indiejuice.com goes here ... 
  mexican with esl here . 
  according to my friends , i have an accent . 
   chicano, 
   argentino, 
  in my experience , you can only be one of these . 
  woah , the voice you put to him was much deeper than i expected it xd . 
  i 'm going to have a golly good time to my island full of crazy people : p, 
  i 'm actually trying to start a webcomic myself . 
  to make it successful you need to make it known to a lot of people as possible . 
  it can take a lot of time of you let it grow naturally or you can accelerate the process by displaying your work at conventions which in the end require some money . 
  i 'm trying yo find a sable job to fuel my plans and strive forward : d, 
  i am finishing some pages to have them ready to shamelessly plug myself during comic-con . 
  the website ... let 's say i 've been slowly working with it and my friend since 2012 ( otz ) . 
  interestingly the story is called `` tales of a jobless mangaka '' . 
  it 's a comedy but it can be a critique of what it 's seen nowadays . 
  good luck eating insects , ms squirrel, 
  mexican here . 
  can confirm . 
  nobody gives a f * ck here . 
  ** yes **, 
  next question . 
   if you use these genders you probably should know a little about music theory in order to conceptualize them, 
   correct me if this is misinformed , i am a solo pianist + other solo instruments + band class and never took a real music class in my life i just took private lessons, 
  in mexico , president fox started to address his speeches to the `` mexicanos y mexicanas '' in order to make the whole inclusion thing more visible . 
  the following presidents and government institutions have followed through . 
  and yes , they also use ` mexican@s' at some ads ( specially if targeted to the youth ) . 
  i just find it ridiculous . 
  it sounded nice at first perhaps but now it 's just mere pandering  : |, 
  we shall miss you , great leader . 
  it was an honor being amongst your people . 
  til i 'm white . 
  i know that this is n't much but i write for a online game website called `` indie juice '' . 
  it 's rather new and needs better manageament in certain articles but i would like to run your story . 
  maybe in an article or interview format . 
  your choice . 
  just let me know . 
  as somebody who lives in baja california , * bitch please *, 
  we barely have enough water in general to have greenery everywhere you go and having the ice challenge wo n't cause people to curl in fetal position and cry . 
  check your drought priviledges . 
  ps : ensenada * could * use some more water though ... 
  did n't robot chicken * already * did a ml ( apocalypse ) p a long while ago ? 
  it was hilarious btw, 
  [ well , if we are talkimg about bread , here 's one apropiate for your cause ... ] ( http://www.vidayexito.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bimbo-mujer-500g.jpg ), 
  i 'll see what i can do . 
  ca n't be worse than pe\u00f1a-kin, 
  wait ... so the leaks are confirmed to be real ? 
  but what does it say ? 
  i thought you guys already had registered unions . 
  i guess it was just natural . 
  if i remember correctly baja california is bidding for this too . 
  i know . 
  i jusr want baja california to start officiating marriages too : ), 
  it actually happened to me once . 
  except that ... it was the whole one-piece swimsuit i lost at the sea, 
  i was like 5 and i decided to wash my swimming suit before we left the beach . 
  the details as to how or why i even did that are lost to me but let 's say i became to loathe mermaids and my parents got a story for when hanging out on the beach . 
  season 2 's ending is based on `` the final problem '' which was the story sherlock 's author went `` fuck it !, 
  i need to write about something else ! '', 
  and killed holmes and moriarty off . 
  the way they did it on the show was rather brilliant imho, 
  i actually like this table . 
  it 'll help me draw the different factions from europe better . 
  mexican here . 
  if she were a true mexican ( tm ) she 'd know part of our culture is not giving fucks about little things and actually go ahead and poke fun at . 
  this tumblerina sounds like your typical gabacho that makes a big fuzz about the 5th of may . 
  mexican here , from just under the border with the us . 
  shesh ... this will sound very awkward considering how everyone seems to have had a `` positive '' reaction ( of support that is ) . 
  i was 11 at the time and when i first heard the news i was on my way to my secondary school . 
  i was sleepy and kind of not putting attention to the news on the radio since i was sleepy but i was glad carlos arjona was n't singing about his problems . 
  when i got into my classroom and everyone was talking all excited or interested . 
  when i asked what had happened one of them came and told me that there was some bomb on new york and the twin towers were gone .
