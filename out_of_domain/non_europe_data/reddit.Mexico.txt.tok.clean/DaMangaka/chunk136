  because pretty men meeting other preety men = sex . 
  these are the kind of things that swayed me from the original series and made me start a whole serious reimagining : /, 
  so the scientist from unam and the poli does n't count ? 
  kay guys !, 
  you are n't real scientists !, 
  do you guya take curps ,, 
  not entirely agreeing with your point but ... that comic art style / does / remind me of some comics i 've seen in tumblr ... 
  - sigh - it 's always the ` shit ' question . 
  to answer you about that : unlike you humans , we do n't have restrictions on natural urges such as that . 
  therefore if it needs to happen , it happens where ever it needs to . 
  now , if you 've been a dick , we do n't forget . 
  least you know , we chase you like if we were a flock of crows . 
  yes . 
  unfortunatelly i do n't have the it knowledge they required . 
  i can read code but ca n't code even to save my life : /, 
  am i a mod now ? 
  i once shipped a small box of kinder eggs inside a bigger box with stuff in a reddit exchange to california . 
  when i got the news it arrived whole , i could n't help but snicker . 
  i had shipped kinder eggs to the us and none could stop me !, 
  tijuanense here . 
  from experience , the ` good mexico ' is los cabos and cancun . 
  the ` evil ( tm ) / bad mexico ' is basically any non-turist place and borders . 
  on regards to donkey shows ... let 's say it 's a half way legend . 
  '' voted no on military border patrols to battle drugs & terrorism . 
  ( sep 2001 ) '', 
  along with prohibiting making yet another wall on said border , this guy seems ok . 
  you have my vote , person of whom only i realized their existence up until now . 
   salsa ( that 's actually not spicy whatsoever , for the record , but is actually just smashed tomatoes and disappointment ), 
  all of my whats . 
  this person has clearly never heard or made sauce from chile de arbol . 
  the ` smooched ' tomato as she calls we usually call it pico de gallo which is not meant to be spicy but you could always add jalape\u00f1o . 
  interestingly , nobody in mexico ( except for the poblanos ) give a fuck about 5 de mayo ( which tbh is sad ) . 
  so go ahead and grab a beer in our name pinches gringos : p, 
  hmm . 
  meanwhile in argentina . 
  ah , yes , suicide by twitter . 
  a rather ridiculous way to go , and most definitively a treat to watch . 
  word of advice : only do that when you have a safe distance to run and you are not by a freeway . 
  trust me on this ... 
  i have like 3 of those left . 
  want one ? 
  death ? 
  you come to / me / specifically to be told about death ? 
  sure , why not ? 
  it 's not like i have any hurry at aaaall . 
  you see , as the saying goes , everything has a begining and an end . 
  you probably popped like some viscuous goo from your mother 's flacid cooch and you became one of the 6 billion idiots that so happen to be at the same time as you . 
  imagine all that goo and broken vaginas . 
  yeah , it so goes on and on . 
  so you are here ; you are a retarded drool dispenser that gets smarter and smarter - then again the fact that you are asking me such a question makes me wonder just how smart you really are . 
  you get wasted , do bad decisions and then waste the rest of your period on earth trying to be something other than idiot number 6 billion and 73 who 'll inevitably realize something : you will close your eyes one day and never open them up . 
  i ca n't promise you it will be painless - and i hope it is n't , just for asking - but it 'll happen . 
  you know that `` death and taxes '' saying ? 
  well that 's true . 
  you ought to cough it out later . 
  your so called precious life full of special moments is just one of the many flickering candlelights which can be blown off easily with a clap of my hand . 
  and that 's it . 
  the end . 
  thanks for playing . 
  is there anything afterwards ? 
  i do n't know !, 
  why would / i / know ? 
  just because i 've been here for almost forever does n't mean i know . 
  by this point i do n't care . 
  and you know what kid ? 
  maybe you should n't either . 
  life is a flickrring candlelight . 
  do n't waste your time staring at it . 
  or , eh ... fuck it , let 's get more tequila shots . 
  the night 's young and i 'm just getting started . 
  super quick edit : ohhhhh ... it was the - other - way around ... whoops, 
  that 's pretty much what started me on losing weight . 
  so far i 've lost 10 kilos : d, 
  oddly enough i * like * coca cola life * because * of the aftertaste . 
  i 'm not a fan of coca cola . 
  in fact , when i have to choose soft drinks i generally avoid it . 
  it leaves me burping for a while and it 's too sweet for my taste . 
  this one , however , i find it to be perfect : not to sweet ( or barely sweet ? ), 
  and does n't make me a burping machine . 
  i usually go for the mini-cokes or the can presentation but still , it 's not something i drink often . 
  i think i 'm really weird ... 
  ... but . 
  . but i do that too . 
  and i 'm biologically female . 
  ^ ~ ~ i ^ have ^ the ^ soul ^ of ^ a ^ pigeon ^ so ^ i ^ dunno ^ if ^ that ^ counts ~ ~, 
  they are actually !, 
  a `` gringo '' taco or torta usuallt has american cheese ( thus why gringo ) and bacon ( on some areas , mostly on tortas ) . 
  but yes , they are a variety of taco too : p, 
  source : mexican, 
  i 'm stealing this . 
  thank you . 
  ... i kind of am writing a story with muse as a ` soundtrack ' . 
  their songs have proven to have a great potential to become other things . 
  i 'll love you until lp8 if you do so, 
  you could catch a drowzee and trade it for a machop at the goldenrod shop-tower thing . 
  however , most of the times you 'd cry yourself to sleep at knowing you had a super-effective type yet it was worth * nothing * . 
  i often defeated the thing with my togepi after a bout of hardens and metronomes ... not before my whole team was plundered to death, 
  as somebody that ~ ~ manages a bunch of dimensions and universes ~ ~ writes stories , * no * . 
  that is * not * how au!something works . 
  also , technically ~ ~ as per the rules ( on certain universal conventions ) ~ ~ , you * can not * have the memories of the other au!person because being from au automatically makes you another person .
