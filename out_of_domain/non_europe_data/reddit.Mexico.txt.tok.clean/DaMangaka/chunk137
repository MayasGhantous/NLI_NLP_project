  you * may * have similarities but your experiences will never be the same and thus you can * never * be that other au!person . 
  this is where fanfiction idiots and ` mai headcanon ' people miss the point of making aus or new canons : they do n't make * any * bit of sense because you either do n't follow the stated pattern to help you deviate enough for you au or ca n't even form a solid base to form a whole different universe importing and molding that character into this new au . 
  it should n't be this hard people !, 
  even in wacky alternate universes there should be some sense and logic to it !, 
  um , right . 
  just ignore my little rambling over there ^ ^ ;, 
  i wanted to post my own playlists here but i was a bit shy to do so . 
  it 's for the story i 'm writing . 
  given that you 've done that here , i 'll just leave you one of them and see if you like it along with a small explanation . 
  intro - new born, 
  - part a -, 
  butterflies & hurricanes, 
  bliss, 
  i belong to you / mon coeur c'est toi, 
  popcorn, 
  please , please , please , let me get what i want, 
  - part b -, 
  soldier 's poem, 
  sing for absolution, 
  * adagio for strings *, 
  space dementia, 
  - part 3 -, 
  citizen erased, 
  micro cuts, 
  falling away from you, 
  interlude, 
  * the story * - `` stories are always written by winners '' they say . 
  but what about that other part of history lost or disregarded ? 
  this is the story of the rise and fall of a region called samland , nowadays kaliningrad . 
  it includes , of course , the pride of the prussian empire and the german downfall . 
  `` let me tell you about the sins of my brothers '', 
  let me know if you like this list and if you are interested in listening another one . 
  i think i do have it on spotify but i need to arrange the order  : |, 
  citizen erased ? 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but is n't the stereotype of country music of it being a bit mellow and tame on their lyrics ? 
  talking mostly about days in the fields , the skies and the country like it was some sort of lovely lady . 
  i really ca n't think of a * good * reason why these tumblerinas would hate it : / . 
  it 's not rap and definitively not banda . 
  then again , i must remind myself that * anything * that seems remotely white is bad to these people . 
  as a baja californian , i fear that last sentence ... 
  - rekt list goes here -, 
  i would n't be able to study with that album . 
  i 'd be way high on muse imagining stuff . 
  yes , you can get high on muse . 
  it 's a hell of a drug . 
  save me is such a mellow song , i loved it the first time i heard it . 
  i 'd love to hear more chris-made songs in the next album . 
  that 's kind of what i was imagining when listening to drones . 
  really chilling . 
  the end of the world and you 're the only one standing . 
  step 1 - get showbiz cd/digital album, 
  step 2 - place it on your favorite music player, 
  step 3 - click/press the play button, 
  step 4 - congratulations , now you are listening to showbiz : ), 
  in all honesty , showbiz is n't much of an album i poke much and as many others prefer oos . 
  but if i must give you songs , i 'd go with unintended and sunburn . 
  really good starters . 
  dude !, 
  i also imagined a child !, 
  it was for another reason though ( a story i 'm writing ) but definetively a child !, 
  i am not even sure why i am so excited about that xd ;, 
  damn !, 
  you beat me to it !, 
  so . . will i get discounts for being a pigeon with my formely named gender ? 
  happy birthday my beloved muse . 
  may you keep on rocking and inspiring thousands !, 
  hey !, 
  as a mexican this triggers me !, 
  admiring narcos is part of our culture !, 
  by admiring female narcos you are being part of those evil white men that fetishise our culture essencially raping it !!!!, 
  urgh ... this is getting ridiculous . 
  and i thought people that liked hearing komander were idiots . 
  ps : while some poor marginalized regions in mexico * may * admire the lifestyle of a narco , it is not part of our culture . 
  ffs ... 
  am i late for the train ? 
  are you me by any chance ? 
  ~ ~ another one ?!, 
  fuck ... so the battle continues then ... ~ ~, 
  ( [ i actually have a tumblr ] ( http://gslucky.tumblr.com ) !, 
  and soon a website with my comic < though i 've been saying that for 2 years  . 
  but hey !, 
  being poor has it 's perks !, 
  for once , i 've learned to utilize as many art materials as possible , from crayola crayons to ballpoint paints . 
  necesity is the mother of all needs after all = 7 = ), 
  i actually find it * easier * and satisfactory to color with my prismas than digitally ( unless it 's illustrator . 
  dem illustrator is a fine program ) and it 's actually my weapon of choice when i want to do something cool . 
  you just have to learn how to blend and work around with them . 
  my recomendation is to start tests with the crayola color pencils ( of 48 colors : p ) . 
  easier to manage and cheap enough to get some practice . 
  i am saving some money for a surface pro , though , so i 'll get both a tablet and new laptop \\ 0 7 0 /, 
  in your defense , you * have * to order your quesadilla with chese in mexico city . 
  i have no fucking idea why ... 
  i heard the scientist from unam are working on it . 
  so far , no positive results have come out yet . 
  and * this * is why mras exist . 
  the good , the bad , they exist because of people like * you *, 
  i disagree . 
  i have interlude as the ending of one of the playlists for my stories ... but only because it is * not * the real end ... 
  it can work ; ), 
  i have an incredibly long playlist and no matter what i am just * waiting * for defector to come up .
