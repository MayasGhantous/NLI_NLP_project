  when i hear jfk 's speech i just begin to grin knowing what 's next . 
  it 's taken over my mind !, 
  help !, 
  i usually avoid mexican news ( as most is usually about corrupt politicians , massacred people/students and or rt quality ass kissing from the media ) but this is really * really * good to hear !, 
  considering more lgbt people are getting amparos and their marriages consumed ( after a loooong process ) i would like to think that we are close to have ssm soon . 
  if it helps , even as a kid i felt like i was something in between . 
  i never felt too uncomfortable being a girl ( hey !, 
  it has a toooooon of advantages ) but i identified more with boy stuff and still do . 
  i would like to crossdress and go full male and have a bit more of an androgynous feel to myself . 
  about what i am , i always check `` female '' on forms and stuff but i could care less if i am a chick or not . 
  sure , my parents are n't too happy when i 've tried to go full male but it just annoys me rather than upset me like ftm would because i know they do n't understand and i need to find my own place . 
  what i am tellimg you is to forget a bit about labels and enjoy yourself . 
  if you are a guy who likes dresses and are n't gay or so , who cares ? 
  more power to ya . 
  it takes * guts * to go out there in a flowy skirt , be a dude and say `` i like this '' . 
  the least you should do is trying to be something you do n't feel as . 
  screw labels , screw groupies , be your own fulfilled niche . 
  i think i 'm straying off ^ ^ ; ; ; ~ ~ it 's 1amafterall ~ ~, 
  as a mexican , let me go ahead and say '' \u00a1 a webo g\u00dceyes !, 
  shenmue was basically one of the best dreamcast games out there . 
  i believe part of the hype why it 's so awaited ( aside from the story and all ) is because literatelly the last scene of shenmue 2 is the main characters facing a door that 's about to open . 
  you are left with that image . 
  all of a sudden , the dreamcast is dead . 
  sega is no longer a console producer . 
  the fate of shenmue is thrown here and there and there are no hopes for a game and the conclusion and the fact of wondering what 's behind that fucking door . 
  now we can now ... 
  oddly enough , they * never * seem to point this out in mexican history classes . 
  it 's always ** teh evul spaniards destroyed teh pure and proud aztec race . 
  they never teach everything that was involved in the conquest , like how the tlaxcaltecas were * really * happy to see somebody on their side for once and how the aztecs ( which according to their own legends should not even be called like that ) were quite the bunch of dicks to their own ` protectorates ' . 
  spain had really little to no chance to conquer tenochtitlan on their own , it was only thanks to the rival tribes and smallpox that they did win . 
  and * do n't * get me started on the mexican-american war ... 
  sep can go fuck itself . 
  let 's begin saying that antonio lopez de santa ana is viewed as one of the worst traitors in mexican history . 
  it is no doubt that selling half of the mexican territory is horrible but that in fact may have not only saved mexico but the * whole american continent * given that the united states was following a certain [ destiny ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=manifest_destiny ) . 
  ~ ~ ok , that last statement may be a stretch but who knows ... ~ ~, 
  little do most mexicans know is that the generalissimo was * also * the one who propelled the ** creation of the national anthem ** . 
  you know ? 
  the one that we proudly sing on each ~ ~ arranged ~ ~ fifa match ? 
  yep , that guy ordered the anthem to be created after mexico 's morale was obviously thrown to the ground after the war . 
  speaking of the war itself , the main reason why mexico lost was because the ** same mexicans turned against mexico ** . 
  when the us forces bribed mexican soldiers to join their forces or leave their weapons in exchange of becoming american/having some land/usd , they said '' * you know what ? 
  fuck mexico . 
  what has mexico been but a mess these 50 years . 
  * '' it is worth to note that the mexican soldiers were badly paid because for those past 50 years , there were endless civil wars and power struggles to the point there were at least 50 presidents ( in and out ) on that period . 
  1 president a year you guys !, 
  iturbide sure is happy he left the throne so the country became a republic . . oh wait , no . . you murdered him and made him a traitor too . 
  why not ? 
  the main force defending mexico were ** irish ** , which is why saint patrick 's day is ( supposed to be ) celebrated . 
  the irish did it for two reasons : 1 ) fuck the uk and 2 ) fuck that bastard of the us . 
  the last seige at chapultepec had to ( debatable though ) be defended by * kids * ( ok , teens . . but eh ) because much of the army had fled , defected or just nope 'd from away from the us forces . 
  and so , that 's how we lost . 
  yes , the us army was strong but if 5 de mayo has thought us something is that organized patriotic mexicans can do * anything * . 
  we lost because we were a bunch of assholes to our own country ... or were creating [ * another republic * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_yucat%c3%a1n ) because fuck mexico . 
  oh . . but that delicious opression at the oea ... it tastes * so good * ... 
  granted , i am not saying that the united states [ has n't done bad ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacto_de_la_ciudadela ) things against mexico , but to claim that the reason as to why we suck is because the us exist is incredibly ridiculous . 
  we co-exist , whether either side wants to or not . 
  and i 'll stop here because i 'll end up writing a book about it ~ ~ well , more of a fanfic of a certain anime but shhhh ~ ~, 
  screw your opression , i have privilege !, 
  and that is why my comment of `` fuck sep '', 
  the secretariat of public education has actually been dumbing down education and for a good reason : a dumb population continues to keep a dumb governmetn ( read pri ) . 
  basically our history is put in black/white shades where foreigners or any contact with foreigners is bad and anybody who fought against it were good . 
  they also keep key events like * el maximato * really obscure . 
  ca n't have them reflect on our politics either . 
  also , speaking of the mexican independence , it 's a rather curious case : the insurgentes did n't exactly want to become independent at first but were * against * napoleon 's imposition over spain which led to a crappier life . 
  it was only after hidalgo died that it did turn into a full fledged war of independence . 
  even after the country became independent , they wanted to follow a spanish model and even bring a noble from there to continue the * empire * but spain basically said `` ha ha , nope . 
  fuck you ~ ~ new spain ~ ~ mexico , you 're on your own now '' which is why iturbide was selected since he was the `` dude that helped us win after all , so why not ? '' . 
  shit happened and he was thrown away to spain and deemed a traitor without even telling him that he was a traitor or * why * . 
  maximilian was a sadder case : he actually came to mexico ( after the whole 5 de mayo actually ) happy and encouraged to make the country better . 
  he even asked for proof that the mexicans wanted him . 
  the conservadores brought him a letter with 10,000 signatures ( forged or not , who knows . . eh ) and he came in . 
  turns out , though , that maximilian was more liberal than the mexican liberals of the time and the conservadores ( which means conservatives btw ) were like `` dude , da fuq ? 
  wai u do dis ? '' . 
  most of them betrayed him by joining juarez ( the outsted liberal mexican president ) and defeating his few loyal troops . 
  his final words were `` viva mexico '' as he was shot along with miram\u00f3n and mej\u00eda . 
  ... oh and porfirio d\u00edaz ... - shakes head - no , i 'd rather finish that ~ ~ fic ~ ~ story i 'm writing . 
  they do , but it 's still very * very * polarized . 
  granted . . it * is * for elementary school kids but . . 
  i 'm sure they wo n't be too keen to learn more . 
  i was a very strange kid ... 
  on the 20th century though , you are right on the money . 
  what i do mean about sep is that they are dumbing the content even more , and if i heard correctly they are taking out civismo which is both stupid and dangerous . 
  i ca n't say about the state of public schools though as i was only once in one ( 1ro - 2ndo semestre de prepa ) but what i do know is that we * can * put a biiiiiiiiit of blame on the sep. 
  i actually thought it * was n't * given that there is this whole hatred against spain . 
  granted , their accent is not the best but . . eh . 
  that or i read too many comments on dbz youtube videos when they fight upon which dub is better . 
  dunno , again ... something is happening that they do teach it but it does n't exactly stick . 
  ~ ~ otherwise we would n't have the shit of government we have ... ~ ~, 
  using d&d logic , he was a bit into lawful neutral while villa was chaotic good and zapata was lawful good . 
  do n't take me wrong , d\u00edaz 's goverment did become authoritarian but was the government period where mexico flourished the most . 
  he brought the industrial revolution to mexico and modernized it to the point the mexican peso was very * very * strong . 
  in some places it was an exchange currency like the usd . 
  the abuses workers faced were actually * very * similar to the ones suffered by american workers in the later xix century/early xx , but of course unlike in the us most of the families in mexico were extremely poor with few chances to succeed and get out of their bad situation . 
  only 5 months after the mexican revolution started , d\u00edaz realized the situation would pretty much destroy all his 30 years worth of work and decided to leave . 
  `` madero has released a tiger , let 's see how he rides it '' . 
  zapata was actually a very well read man that did belive in his ideals of fighting for people and bringing equity . 
  aside from the flores mag\u00f3n brothers , he was the closest thing to a social revolucionary . 
  ( well , the mag\u00f3n brothers were anarchists but . . eh ), 
  villa did a lot of things for the lulz . 
  yes , he 's a hero but he would always go and troll the us , raid their bases and get away as fast as he could ( by lol logic , he 'd be a jungle ) .
