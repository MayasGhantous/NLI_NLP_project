  his raids proved to be useful during the mexican revolution and he continued them well after they were done . 
  villa wanted to become a head of power , zapata did n't . 
  they were polar oposites in many ways but complemented each other , specially when realizing how madero was an idiot that should be ignored ( zapata ) and trolled ( villa ) . 
  carranza later on went to kill them , because we ca n't have an idealist and a troll in the same forum . 
  that 's pretty much why i am doing it so : ), 
  mexico 's history is really interesting and i 'd like people to know as much as possible . 
  and i * love * that comic . 
  pretty much my feelings over that topic . 
  generally private schools are better ~ ~ and less prone to missing/marching teachers ~ ~ but i dunno . 
  from my experience , while private education is better , the kids are generally not  : |, 
  pinches juniors ... 
  baja california : p, 
  such is the life of any troll : p, 
  at the end they persuaded him to stop doing what he did best and gave him a car and some lands . 
  then he got properly shot down in his car . 
  to be honest , i went to a public high school in my first year before being a snob ass and going back to a private one ( having gone only to private schools and all ) . 
  i can say that while the overall school faculty and teachers need a lot of improvement , the guys at the public school were more down to earth and humane than the bunch of snobby kids i got to know on high school . 
  then again , i * did * go to one of the most expensive schools in my city . . so that might be a factor as well . 
  1 ) you 're right . 
  2 ) right again though we can not forget guadalupe-hidalgo which was where the anex happened . 
  they did give some compensation money ( if i recall correctly ) but eh . 
  3 ) yes and sort of : most of the mexican army were pesants but the saint patrick batallion was quite the bunch . 
  so yeah what you also said is true . 
  4 ) i do * not * have the source as of now where i read it but it was n't per-se bribed . 
  maybe `` bribe '' is n't a good wording . 
  simply they were offered a chance to get stuff in return to forfeit the battle . 
  in this source ( i will go to look for , i promise i am not making this up ; ; ; i read it ) it was well known that the us army would execute members who fled/forfeit/turned against them ... as any army would . 
  well , any army but the mexicans . 
  for some reason they did * not * execute them for treason and the what not . 
  these were mainly the peeps the us army would aproach to try to either join them or make sure to just leave it all . 
  wether it is true or not about the pay , fact is the mexican army was a horrible mess and most prefered to avoid battle however possible . 
  the theme of my relationship with my girlfriend . 
  if muse had to play one song , it 'd be this one before the toast . 
  so muse is abelist now ? 
  well , fuck , my last name * literatelly * means flowers . 
  guess i can thank * the patriarchy * ^ tm for that ... 
  i 'm 26 and i am a pigeon ... 
  fear me . 
  i 've actually had cases of `` this smells so pink '' so it might not be farfetched, 
  the [ secretariat of public education ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secretariat_of_public_education_\\ ( mexico \\ ) ), 
  to be honest ... 
  i like her without make-up . 
  in fact , most i like my girls without ( too much ) make up . 
  dunno , i myself find it a hazzle : /, 
  i did notice , yes xd, 
  however , i ca n't travel that far in such a short time, 
  ... you 're actually right xd, 
  had * no * idea this would be there . 
  will not attend . 
  does n't seem interesting . 
  you 're so lucky !!!!, 
  i missed my chance to go to the san diego stop on 2013 and i regret it still . 
  i hope to feel as amazed and awed as yourself too . 
  muse , i believe , is something to be lived rather than just heard . 
  what about adobada ? 
  adobada tacos never get enough love : (, 
  huh , i wonder what the ` like ' count for this post is ... 
  rather sad at what level some people can go for the sake of white knighting . 
  this is a time for * all * to celebrate . 
  unless you hate lgbt people ... which in this case , i 'm sad for you too . 
  / u/trollabot damangaka, 
  soooo ... in otherwords , the artist is erraising their identity by trying to make them less ` sexualized ' ? 
  what a plot-twist !, 
  i 'm a mexican from mexico with high-med priviledges . 
  do i get like ** super extra special ** snowflake points or do i have to redeem them for usd ? 
  montly reminder that , unless you are from puebla , nobody gives a crap in mexico about cinco de mayo . 
  so crack open a beer , eat some tacos , wear zarapes and sombreros . 
  we do n't care . 
  * enjoy *, 
  we do that over here in the border . 
  there are fireworks in rosarito ( if i recall correctly ) and you can see the ones in san diego on playas de tijuana . 
  heck , we have apropiated thanksgiving too ... and black friday ... heck , at this point , the border could be it 's own country . 
  and that , kids , is how cultural * sharing * works . 
  as a mexican , they probably did it for the lulz and the money . 
  then again , buying mexicans to protest/rally for things is n't uncommon in mexico : (, 
  can somebody explain me the relationship between u-haul and lesbians ? 
  i was actually going to post that, 
  that 's what spain and portugal are for dummy : p, 
  so 10 % of their haul is actual stuff the cat needs to live . 
  i 'm glad to know its going to be cared well / s, 
  which in the end makes me annoyed/angry when mexicans/mexico-americans cry about being treated badly . 
  yes , i know our country is shitty on many aspects , and yes in part there are better oportunities in the us . 
  that does n't excuse the fact that :, 
  * you got in illegaly, 
  * as an inhabitant of that country , you are * supposed * to learn the main language which is in this case english . 
  i do n't care about you so called ` national pride ' . 
  teach your kids spanish , that 's cool too . . but for goodness sake learn english/that other language !, 
  ( and do n't forget the other one too ), 
  * you * could * have gotten a better life oportunity if you are really passionate about it/have the skills to/are smart/etc without leaving the country . 
  getting into the united states does n't magically solve your problems . 
  i am not sure if there is any sort of subtitled version for this movie , but if you watch the [ golden dream ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2042583/ ) , you 'll realize that what these guys ( the guatemalans ) go through from south to north is fucking hell . 
  worse of all : nobody gives a shit about them and most of them are n't even included as ` casualties ' among the many other pile of dead people in mexico . 
  smh / end rant, 
  but for the love of all that is good , put some guacamole on them  : |, 
  12 hours `` how is the kittynapping investigation going along '', 
  for some reason i would think the unreleased `` soaked '' would get most of the feeling out of it . 
  sure , people are pissed , but the overall thought is close to soaked . 
  that 'll be easy for me !, 
  comic-con is much more important than reddit, 
  ~ ~ fortunatelly ~ ~ most of my family is mexican and lives in another state .
