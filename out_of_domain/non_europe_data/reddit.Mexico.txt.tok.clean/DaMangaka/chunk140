  the few family members that live in the us are far too busy working that day to celebrate ( long story short , they did n't exactly get in there the right way ) . 
  and from that few , the ones that * do * celebrate do n't exactly bitch about immigration and the gays ( but they do eat burgers ) , mostly because we do n't bring it . 
  my great-aunt used to have a gay brother ( who since passed away 2 years ago ) so even though she is catholic and somewhat conservative she does n't seem to be preachy on that regard . 
  that and well ... my family is rather weird : |, 
   source : i went to a convention about rape and ~ ~ asked ~ ~ raped 6 people, 
  ftfy,

  please do not deport da mangaka . 
  this is meant to be a joke . ~ ~,

  i plan to keep it in downtown for as long as i can, 
  and it was n't even porygon 's fault : (, 
  i think it would be good to have a small funeral for reddit . 
  poor guy , killed by a cancer worse than the cancer that is / b /, 
  sooooo ... how 's that salad working for you so far ? 
  classic sonya is the best sonya imho : p, 
  for examples of aging gracefully , please refer to [ meryl streep ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/meryl_streep ), 
  i know the article is a joke but ... the whole sjw movement will make the masquerade line rather interesting . 
  you get to delight yourself of a bit of everything while you wait there : the good , the odd and the weird . 
  2011 's was top kek due to the twihard situation . 
  we had a fun anti-twilight rally . 
  i 'll keep you informed : p, 
  lady , as a graphic designer myself allow me to tell you that there 's really * no * functionality on that redesign at all . 
  heck , you can * barely see * the detail you so much gloat about without having it shoved at your eye . 
  and if that 's not bad design , i do n't know what that is . 
  just got back from sdcc . 
  it was amazing , i got really kick ass collectibles , hung out with some friends , won a shirt at the nintendo lounge ... 
  then i got a dm : i got some bad news : iwata 's dead . 
  i just stared down at my phone in disbelief . 
  how ? 
  why ? 
  he was just fighting reggie a year ago ... he looked so powerful , full of life . 
  i ca n't get over with this ... 
  i ca n't say my day was ruined but ... this feels like i was hit by a truck, 
  i feel i was hit by a truck when i got the message of his passing . 
  rip / f, 
  returned from sdcc just some hours ago . 
  i can tell you that such rules are * not * in place . 
  mostly it 's based on ** common sense **, 
  sjws are n't even a minority here : p, 
  that explains why most tumblr posts end with the infamous - drops mike - sentence . 
  hmm : /, 
  `` we are cooks not eaters , it 's ok to admit this '', 
  i wonder if you like to eat your own shit ... 
  finally , an ask reddit that might be relevant . 
  while i may have had many of these moments , the one that has surprised me so far is the following :, 
  this was after i had just become 15 years old . 
  with my quincea\u00f1era and all , i had been bought contact lenses so i did n't have to be wearing my glasses that day . 
  after that , i had decided to just wear them regularly and try to ditch the glasses since i kind of liked how i looked without them and wanted to try out . 
  it was february 29 , a sunday . 
  i know because the oscars were going to play that day . 
  we went to ride our bikes on a park and we had planned to get some pizzas . 
  i originally wanted to wear my contacts as i had done so but my friends were already pressuring me to go and after many failed attempts i said ` fuck it ' and went with my glasses on . 
  it is worth to note my bike had not been in the best of states but i went anyways . 
  what 's the worse it could happen anyways ? 
  when we were on our way back , the worse did happen : my brakes failed me . 
  it was n't that they could n't break but it was n't strong enought break in time to stop me from going into the street ( over were we tend to ride on the sidewalks . 
  bike paths and that stuff are still relatively knew in my country ) so i made a gamble : i 'd make a sharp turn towards the nearest sidewalk and try to go between two telephone booths that were just the start of it . 
  crappy plan is crappy and i end up hitting face first with the corner of one of the phone booths . 
  i did n't feel anything but i can feel blood trickling . 
  all i want to do is stand up and eat my goddamed pizza but my peers push me down while they call an ambulance . 
  just while they do so , a sports car rides off like if it were in a race . 
  i 'm a bit relieved that i did n't choose the street after all . 
  at the hospital , the doctor checks me up and fixes me . 
  fortunatelly nothing is broken and it 's just some stiches that i need . 
  after the wound healed , my dad noticed that the scar i developed stops just right were my glasses would have been on that eye . 
  in other words , had i not taken my glasses that day , i would have most likely lost my left eye . 
  now i sport a cool scar which few people can see as my hair naturally covers it but is a good story to tell . 
  ** tl ; dr ** - got contacts lenses at quinceanera and began to use them instead of my glasses . 
  the day i 'm too lazy to wear them , i go face first on a phone booth on a bike accident . 
  glasses save my eye . 
  still no pizza . 
  ** an announcement from a now former lurker **, 
  i have no idea what to expect and i 'm excited enough to do a small game : i will draw draw the character ( s ) that appear on the timer mark that random.org has generated [ here are your clock times : 08:35 ], 
  you have until 4 pm pt / 7 et to tell me * how * i should draw them ( clothes/pose/etc ), 
  ready , set . . go !,
