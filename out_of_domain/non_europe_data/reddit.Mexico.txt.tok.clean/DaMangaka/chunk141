  i have a legit question : is pansexuality actually legit ? 
  i used to go by that until people ( read reddit ) groaned about it just being a ` special ' label for a broader bisexuality or what not . 
  tbh , i do n't mind using either denomination but considering some of my dates have been trans and i do n't care about genders ... 
  i often wonder ... 
  sorry , but all i can hear is ` dat ass ', 
  if you 're expecting people wo n't sexualize you when you use a sexy outfit , you 're gon na have a bad time ... 
  regardless if the pictures depic real women or men ( though i 've actually come across comic-book like skinny sexy women and big muscled me ) what i also noticed is that they make them * boring *, 
  not to diminish the everyday person but , come on ... these are super heroes . 
  these are super people who do incredible feats . 
  these are not ` normal humans ' or ` normal people ' who go to work from 7 to 5 and eat crap and get all stressed out . 
  these are people who most of the times live a double life , have to fight a galactic invasion and most likely have the body to be able to hold it . 
  also , as an artist , the more spiffier a character is ( though not going too ff on the design ) , the more memorable it is . 
  why , can anybody tell me that [ the blob ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blob_\\ ( comics \\ ) ) is realistic ? 
  a fat man that has incredible superhuman powers despite his obvious weight ? 
  and the design choice is simple enough to separate him from actual existing blobs irl ... 
  i could go on a rant about this , but technically ... it 's up to the artist and universe they are writing/drawing/creating . 
  ~ ~ the blob / berta is mah new otp ~ ~, 
  i do n't mind japanese characters ( please check username ) but i do kind of get bothered how easy it is that they get powers without much development and what not ( something i actually and pleasingly enjoy on american cartoons/comics ) . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/as6lqs6m1w5hefqb8ew2.jpg ) is what i had in mind when i mentioned ff style art . 
  yes , that 's batman . 
  as you can see , even if it looks spiffy it just does n't cut it for an easy id which is why sometimes anime looks generic despite how incredible it might be designed . 
  so , yes . . even if your character is fat or the ` ideal physique ' , if it does n't stand out somehow ( my favorite way is by their character , just like irl people : p ) it 'll be forgotten along the thousands of heroes/villians/characters that exist out there . 
  also , you can not force an ideal on a pre-set character . 
  it 's * very * hard to pull if you do * not * know said character and how to mesh a different concept together . 
  then again , with the amount of shitty aus around ... 
  there were a ** bunch ** of gem cosplays by the children 's park fountain on friday . 
  i remember a lapis lazuli * inside * the actual fountain ( it 's rather big , think of a shallow pool ) being taken photos and posing and what not . 
  really cool . 
  wish i could have taken photos ( i was with some friends and forgot ), 
  just link it in a post over there . 
  then again , * most * things are nowadays thrown at / r/bestof so who knows ... 
  ### needs moar jpeg, 
  bitch , my celphone was robbed from me from some wannabe cholo with a knife while i was waiting for the bus . 
  did you know what i did ? 
  i gave it to him because my life is more important ... ~ ~ and chased the motherfucker later because i 'm crazy as fuck ~ ~ but that has * not * in all sense made me afraid of men . 
  bad * people * exist , good and bad , female or male . 
  i feel sorry that you have created a self contained bubble of paranoia and fear about something that may not even happen to you at all , all so can harvest speshul points . 
  you ... * do * know you have the options between tampons and pads ? 
  you 're not obligated to buy one of them , let alone a specific brand . 
  then again . . that was kind of my first reaction when i had to use one of those in an emergency . 
  what happens in vegas . 
  bitch , i grew in tijuana . 
  according to the us government it 's a hotspot for crap like this to happen . 
  at most , i have had guys drive by fapping at me while they ask me for ` directions ' but for goodness sake it never went further than that !, 
  also , mexico seems to be a bit more * macho * and i have yet to see this kind of shit ( though i 'm sure it 's matrialchal deep down ) . 
  true privilege is believing people will give a fuck about you all the time , enough to actually fuck you  : |, 
  that was like , what ? 
  2 scenes that lasted less than 10 seconds ? 
  this is maybe why they ca n't go outside and live a life  : |, 
  flair is suddenly relevant ... 
  1847 happened . 
  we have n't recovered from that it seems . 
  it 's much easier to play as a victim than to actually do something about it . 
  is she 14 ? 
  because that 's what 14 year old girls sound like . 
  holy fucking shit !!!, 
  i think i 'll be mama diablo when it comes to mexicans , so please excuse my rant . 
  of.fucking.course most of mexico will seem white to you under this new standard ... because newsflash !, 
  75 % of the population is technically criollo ( spanish/european + native mexican ) . 
  unlike the united states ( as far as i can tell ) , we blend fairly well with anybody including foreign population . 
  it 's unsusual to create social or demographic cliques . 
  now there * are * ** class ** cliques but that has been forever and ever and shall remain unless ~ ~ we put our shit together and work as a team ~ ~ the government is killed or something . 
  everyone outside of the priviledge class gets fucked equally and in some odd way binds us together to be the wonderful mess that mexico is . 
  these men , btw , won not because they are mexicans , or white , or speak english , but because they are * good at what they are doing * . 
  cuar\u00f3n himself made it note on one of his interviews ( specially to the mexican media who wanted to put this as a ` mexican award ' ) . 
  it 's good that i\u00f1arritu dedicated his prize to us ~ ~ and said in a rather nice way ` fuck you mexican government ' ~ ~ but let 's not forget the prize was given to * him * for his achivement , not to the country nor to him as a mexican . 
  little things to remember to avoid ripping our vestments for something that we should ignore completely ~ ~ and not use for victimization purposes as usual ~ ~, 
  in a way , she 's right but . . holy fucking shit ... 
  it 's like our culture , values and existence is tied to our skin !, 
  bitch you ai n't know nothin ' about mexico because if you did , you 'd realize that more than anything we are a mosaic of colors and flavours . 
  - your possible employer . 
  uh , not to be an ass but a * lot * of people were dying . 
  not just the jews . 
  that they slaughtered their numbers is one thing , but if my numbers are correct , an equal amount of germans/russians died on the east front , so yes ... * all lives matter * . 
  yes ? 
  can confirm : when ever tia tires me , i bask in the warmth of su, 
  plot twist !, 
  he 's a trans-man !, 
  how is teaching math racist ? 
  how ... ? 
  what ? 
  i 'm basically a pigeon with a non specific gender ( that used to be known as prince ) and presenting as a female . 
  what 's your point ? 
  ~ ~ also , how many points do i need to get some watercolor pencils ? ~ ~, 
   apollo is * not * straight, 
  i do believe this is the whole reason of ` headcanons ' and all of that jazz . 
  make things that ar normal , * not * normal and squeeze points out of them ~ ~ is that were good boy points come from ? ~ ~, 
  i mean , other than making everyone spechul ^ tm , what do you get from having apollo being specifically * not * straight . 
  did you save the world by changing his orientation to something other than straight ? 
  psh , please ... this is as bad as asking for likes to cure cancers . 
  these people are like the characters they wish people like us would create : shallow , defined only by a single specific trait which could either be gender , ableism or status as trans . 
  i have a story i 'm still sorting which has one of the main characters be a tranvestite . 
  but that 's not what defines that character !, 
  that 's not all there is to they . 
  they is a * person * and as such has a backstory , good , bads , flaws , virtues ... 
  - head/desk - you know what they call characters added to a story just for the sake of representation ? 
  ** tokens ** and no good author should resort to them . 
  yes !, 
  various actually . 
  the one on the post is still a wip that i plan to make a manga out of it once i finish publishing * another * series .
