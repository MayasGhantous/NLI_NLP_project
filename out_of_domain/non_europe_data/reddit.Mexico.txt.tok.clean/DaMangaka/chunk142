  although both of them are independent , they are kind of in the same common universe and some elements might not be understandable until i do so ( at least that 's what i tell myself ) . 
  i 've been making rough drafts for quite a while but until now i 'm getting the courage to start doing something . 
  my first story will start being published on an e-comic hopefully in november . 
  i have a [ tumblr ] ( http://gslucky.tumblr.com ) that i plan to keep updating regularly and my [ website ] ( http://www.gunasunito.com ) ~ ~ which i 've tried to launch for the past 2 years ~ ~ . 
  i do n't like to call myself a lgbt artist or somebody that writes lgbt stories it 's just that some of my characters just happen to be gay/lesbian/bi / trans/ace/agender - shrug -, 
  so let me get the straight : my ** 2 ** posts for a gamergate meetup ( i still owe you photos ... 
  i 'll get to that later ; ; ) get ignored , yet [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/3dhyu7/neogafs_evilore_solidifies_the_sjw_agenda_of_the/ct5s09o ) is the comment that got me tagged ? 
  what should my reaction be ? 
  anger ? 
  confusion ? 
  right now , i 'm in ' i do n't care ' : |, 
  + / u/user _ simulator / u/damangaka, 
  if i recall , mexico is * also * part of this and very little people know about this . 
  we are pretty much aware the president is making huge contracts but there is little to no talk about tpp . 
  what should we do to raise awareness or ? 
  activism here is pretty much shoot and miss : /, 
  what happened to comedy central ? 
  which made latinoamericans white too if i recall ... 
  more like how * not * white you look . 
  graphic designer here . 
  can confirm that is how it works . 
   you negas need to chill da f * ck down, 
  have i killed somebody alread ? 
  i 'm a pigeon with a digital graphic design engineering degree . 
  are you saying i ca n't have a degree , shitlord ? 
  mexican here . 
  as long as they are not taco bell tacos , it 's all cool bro . 
  taco bell ... - shakes head - that 's another kind of breed ... 
   i 'm a fat and i hate skinny people because * they are prettier than me * [ ... ], 
  the whole philosophy behind the `` fat acceptance movement '' ladies and gentlemen . 
  my co-worker stared at me like i was crazy . 
  laughed way louder than usual . 
  does that mean i can start calling you gringos ? 
  because that is totally the best alternative to american i have . 
  statian sounds weird : /, 
  demisexual is the new fetch, 
  but i thought they 'd want * more * inclusion !, 
  babs becomes the oracle , the kick ass smart guide for batman ... all while being in a * freaking wheelchair * . 
  how cool is that ? 
  oh , but gordon can suffer for all they care ... and destroy one of the best batman stories out there . 
  because feelz . 
  f * ck dammit, 
  a long time ago , maybe some 5 years , i had joined okcupid out of accident . 
  well , mostly the quizzes that i liked to answer made you join okcupid . 
  it was fine and really i barely had anybody noticing me , with the few exceptions being polite and ok . 
  one day i decide that 'd be interesting to give it a shot : i was a bit lonely and wanted to see how it felt to go on a date . 
  i was pm 'd by a girl who said she 'd wanted to meet me at mission valley . 
  - * sigh * - mission valley ... that 's 2 hrs for me via trolley . 
  eh , what ever . . it 's not like i had something to do . 
  so i go and meet her . 
  she 's a kind of chubby girl and she 's kind enough to walk around with me while i buy pokedolls and she even took me me to the movies ( `` wtf america ? 
  why are your tickets 9 usd ?! '' ), 
  to see the 3rd ice age movie . 
  right around were we are closing on the date , she confesses me something : she 's trans and tells me how she 's not exactly accepted by her family . 
  she hopes that this does n't throw me off . 
  i shrug and i say ok . 
  i actually tell her that i find it cool and hope things get better at her place . 
  her grandmother picks her up 15 mins later , i thank her for the date and they drive off somewhere . 
  she was a nice date but sadly not my type . 
  still , i sometimes wonder how she is or if her situation at her house was fine . 
  maybe i would have done a bit more knowing that she had actually been brave enough to come out with me , date me and stuff . 
  i do n't know . 
  at least that day i learned i do n't care for genders when it comes to dating . 
  but i often wonder ... in an era where lgbt can marry in the us , where you have more rights and protections , is she doing ok ? 
  has she found somebody who also shrugged at her condition and just took her as she was and not what people told her she had to be ? 
  had she been my type , would we be still together ? 
  would my escapades to san diego be more epic ? 
  would * my * family accept a gal who used to be a guy ? 
  where ever you are , i hope you are doing fine . 
  if we ever meet , i 'd like to take you to the movies to correspond . 
  because , you know ... 30 usd for a movie date is a bit too much ; ; ;, 
  14 . . and most of my points are towards authority and self-sufficiency . 
  ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) looks like somebody 's been browising the ` femdom ' tag again . 
  so ... all this time ... 
  i was straight ? 
  holy crap !, 
  who would have known !, 
  where the _ fuck _ do you get that stupid idea people ?!, 
  ok , you know what ? 
  granted : * some * latinos want special treatment in the us because they are latinos and they ~ ~ feel like they ~ ~ are ~ ~ reconquering ~ ~ in the land of their ancesters and that shit but most if not almost all have crossed over there for one single reason : to get a job to get a better life . 
  * none * crossed to get speshul snowflake status and if they look like native americans is because unlike most people in colonial us and canada , latin america did mingle and mate with * anybody * that they liked . 
  that 's how we got criollos , mestizos , mulatos , etc. 
  unless you are ~ ~ argentinian , ~ ~ uruguayan or brazilian , the chance to find * white * latin americans is relatively small . 
  but who * cares * about if they look how they look right ? 
  liek omgd n0body spiks espanish in imperialistic amerikkka ? 
  how dare they !, 
  che t-shirts ... what ever . 
  we are n't special , we just ... - kicks the comment box -, 
  some people feel that the us should n't have ` stolen ' the word american as a descriptive to call upon themselves . 
  but when your other options are either ` gringo ' or estadounidense you . . really do n't have an easy option . 
  ` statians ' sounds funny too . 
  for the sake of easiness in english , american should be easy enough . 
  spanish and french do have specific words to describe them so lets use those . 
  but , until they find another way to call americans ... americans , i guess we can just keep calling them like that . 
  - shrug -, 
  i 'm just stuck here in mexico : p, 
  northern mexico to be exact , were we do kind of have some population of white latin americans but not that much . 
  well , to be fair i guess it 's from my experience . 
  though i do have to admit that over here in northern mexico were i am there is a sizeable population of ` g\u00fceros ' ( blondes ) . 
  i did n't want to broathen things too much but i guess i fuck 'd up and did n't know how big it was .
