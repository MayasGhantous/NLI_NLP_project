  it 's just odd really . 
  american rolls so well in the tongue in english there 's really no problem whatsoever but i guess the whole * not * using america as a denomination for the us comes down to the whole `` omgad , teh ` muricans did shitty things to the rest of the american continent '' things that would spark some flares with certain people but that 's pretty much the only thing i can think on the top of my head and even then it 's pretty stupid : /, 
  yup !, 
  same with asians here in baja california . 
  it 's rather interesting the kind of mesh we have now : ), 
  if i remember correctly , mexicali became a chinese cluster due tk the fact that many railroad workers were left off or moved to there . 
  quite interesting . 
  easy answer : you eat it from a cup . 
  rumors over here in mexico * scream * that this is where we are heading to . 
  a us based health and education system . 
  and given our government 's record , this is going to be really bad : (, 
  this either means :, 
  the guy is a master troll , the girl 's an idiot . 
  this is a super fake post . 
  ok , that does it guys . 
  does n't matter i was born on earth , mentally i 'm from mars . 
  according [ to this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/3hewwm/misc_i_was_banned_from_roffmychest_for_submitting/ ) , you would n't be the first one . 
  there seems to be a ' [ blacklist ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/3f9xx2/meta_admin_response_to_the_mass_tagger_voting_on/ ) ' for people who post in subs like kia or tia . 
  i may not be / u/awildsketchappeared but . . [ i relish the challenge ] ( http://i.imgur.com/prhxn8z.png ) . 
  i 'm bored at work and really i 'm surprised * le edgy * reddit has n't done so . 
  imho , as long as you are n't insulting them , you can draw him . 
  or you can put a sort of ` spoiler ' so they are aware of the content and avoid it . 
  satire with the prophet ^ pbwh is still a bit out of reach since it seems the general muslim consensus has n't exactly arrived to the level most christians have it were very few would flinch at a pole dancing jesus . 
  if you begin to push boundaries little by little , you can make a huge change . 
  true , and in a sense christianity has gone sometimes fallen on that track . 
  i guess it 's a good thing i made him so vague in the picture . 
  this kind of tendency ( at least in public figures ) all started with vicente fox in mexico . 
  we all joked about that but it seems now everyone takes it seriously . 
  sort of . 
  nothing is really taken seriously here at times . 
  i noticed that too !!!, 
  op , where are you located ? 
  is it for all simis or just yours ? 
  that 's rather kick ass !, 
  holy cow !, 
  i 'm surprised you can understand spanish . 
  good modding sir - lifts bottle -, 
  had never posted there and yet i am banned . 
  well , that was interesting ... 
  it seems i can still visit their sub though, 
  wake me up when september begins ? 
  i think this is why sjws avoid stem . 
  i actually banged my head on my cubicle when reading this . 
  have these people reached full retard status ? 
  good thing i was at work . 
  hmm . . got ta need an it ticket for this ... 
  i began to read about the sad puppies since i remembered it being thrown at / r/kia and got confused . 
  what exactly is this all about ? 
  no , what happened is that chuck norris roundhouse-kicked your ancestors so bad , you are still feeling it today . 
  which makes your condition fairly normal . 
  be happy _ you _ were n't the one who got roundhouse-kicked first, 
  we 're basically unicorns \\ 0 7 0 /, 
  there 's tons of text of our existence yet ... they all know they are n't real . 
  ~ ~ unlessyouarenorthkorean ~ ~, 
  i 'm surprised not to see ` time paradox-phobia ' listed there ... 
  i noticed that too . 
  i was like ` wait a moment . . are n't you confusing _ aries _ with _ ares _ '', 
  meanwhile in mexicali . 
  seems that these people have never visited las vegas . 
  because that 's the only way people can actually go out in the streets : by being sprinkled like they are some sort of lettuce . 
  hoist me lads !, 
  defeating yellow diamond 's gon na be * hard *, 
  because nobody loves them enough to evolve to crobat . 
  which is sad . 
  and so they remain in their caves alone , annoying other passerby . 
  as a trainer who tends to use crobats for leads , i know my mons very well . 
  pretty much what i was going to say . 
  the idea is fantastic !, 
  as somebody who works using american dates , it can get quite confusing at times . 
  it 's like i have to switch my brain back to ` mexican ' date yet i can still get confused . 
  i 'm glad i 'm not using japanese dates thought their kanji makes it easy to know what is each . 
  b-but i already got a girlfriend ... 
  and she 's in canada . 
  you know ... 
  i read these posts more and more and i notice something : it 's always trans * women * that are the issue . 
  either transmen do n't need to use a bathroom or people do n't care . 
  why is it always trans people in the * women 's * bathroom but nobody gives a fuck for trans people in the men 's bathroom ? 
  so puzzling : /, 
  when i first saw her , i kind of had seen her like that . 
  this confirms that the style matches . 
  just the piece i needed for my playlist . 
  thanks !, 
  as somebody who used to have a horrible self esteem , can confirm . 
  it feels like they go down to your level and you can climb on top of them , even for the briefest . 
  of course , it 's just a ` step ' , do you need to keep doing it perpetually . 
  there is never a top ... there 's only another step in an endless ladder . 
  mark my words lads , this will be the fate of the amiibo, 
  ^ hopefully ... ^ maybe ... ^ damn ^ amiibos ... 
  i still owe people a picture . 
  if only i was n't that busy . 
  but i _ will _ post something out of the hype of the end ^ ofthehiatus !, 
  this is the most beautiful shitpost i 've ever seen in my life . 
  here , [ you have earned it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qodsend.jpg ) . 
  dear goddesses ... look what you did fox !, 
  but no !, 
  you had to keep addressing the mexicanos and mexicanas ... 
  can confirm , pe\u00f1a nieto can go suck a ... 
  hmph , i remember shipping 2 kinder eggs for an address in ca in / r/randomactsofamazon, 
  bet she 'll love north korea ...
