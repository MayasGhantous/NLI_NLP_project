  i 'm surprised to know that i 'm in toronto . 
  brb , going to get tim hortons . 
  it probably is because of how it was recorded . 
  now mind you , it 's one of the most clear recordings sound-wise i 've heard but it still sounds like it has some loss . 
  i 'm sure an hq version of the song live might prove how awesome this is . 
  sono google translate no text wa waruii : p, 
  but yeah , spanish does tend to sound kind of like japanese . 
  which is what i like about the language, 
  i * am * an adult ... ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  til batman has huge as fuck fangs, 
  you and me too !, 
  i * do * have a museboard account but i ca n't access it due to my stupid job 's firewall but once i get home i 'm going to check if i can give out some codes to people in europe + + !, 
  mexican hopping to san diego here with your pre-sale codes . 
  pm me for them . 
  first come , first served . 
  ~ ~ denmark , sweden , norway & finland, 
  belgium & the netherlands, 
  france, 
  germany , austria and switzerland, 
  ireland , england , scotland , portugal , spain , italy and czech republic . ~ ~, 
  ready , set ... 
  i live by cali and i 'll be going to the san diego concert . 
  i 'd like to go all day but i work . 
  then again , i can ask the day off . 
  anybody from tijuana that 's going ? 
  just to see if we can make a pack and go along ? 
  i got vip tickets but i was confused on the difference between `` general '' and `` reserved '', 
  i went for general as i there was n't any extras i saw on reserved nor any difference i could see . 
  hope i did a wise choice . 
  i know it is pricey but i promised myself i 'd get the best darn tickets i could for my first muse gig !, 
  - tijuanense here . 
  thanks for considering us . 
  - while i would * love * to see muse 2 times in a week , i do n't think my wallet can take it . 
  - i 'm 21 + so . . yeah ? 
  i 'm indoctrinating others and most that i have successfully turned ... do not have a crossing visa : (, 
  - i do have a sentri card and it is fucking fast to cross depending where you do so ( according to my godfather it 's easier via san ysidro . 
  my father tends to ` nope ' sy even if there is no line there according to the traffic reports . ), 
  to be honest , you need to check 700-7000 and compare between either place but when it comes to crossing by foot , it 's ridiculously fast . 
  sentri does n't work going san diego -  tijuana though . 
  - also , i ** did ** buy the vip thing and i did so out of a promise i made myself when i missed the last gig that i 'd buy the best fucking ticket i could get . 
  i got the general admission though , not sure if i should have gotten ` reserved ' even though there was n't much of a difference i could see . 
  - fuck the rain . 
  not even butterflies or hurricanes would stop me from going to see them now !, 
  i bought my vip tickets and i wanted to see if i could buy 2 other tickets for some friends . 
  so i used my code and ... nothing : /, 
  i 'm not sure if it 's my workplace 's internet settings ( though that does n't explain how i got my own ticket ) or just ... something . 
  has anybody had this issue ? 
  i already want dec 16 to arrive !, 
  my first time too !!!, 
  i saw that too !, 
  at black box in revu ? 
  i wanted to buy a ticket just to satisfy my need for a muse concert but when this came up , i was like `` why not see the actual thing ? '', 
  i do n't think our city has the caliber ( yet ) to have huge concerts as muse or other bands demand it . 
  i feel we are getting there but not quite . 
  but that 's what san diego is for . 
  where you at in tj ? 
  that 's where i want to be !, 
  mostly because the churros are made in downtown and then taken to the border crossing line , that 's why xd ;, 
  i love going to downtown san diego but i get disappointing at how * early * things close there . 
  it seems downtown tijuana never really closes : p, 
  i 'd like to know too as some friends want to go and i could n't purchase them tickets at the pre-sale because reasons : /, 
  reasons like my pre-sale code being eaten on the website . 
  tijuanense here . 
  can confirm . 
  we love to invade san diego and go to your gigs because all we get here is shitty banda music and one or two good spanish-speaking singers . 
  you know , like poisonous snakes and frogs ... 
  huh ... til bright colored frogs probably have photos of me . 
  i 'm a bit confused : i bought my vip tickets but there is no sign i 'll be getting a e-album or physical copy of drones : /, 
  will they be sending me an e-mail too or not ? 
  yesterday at 10 : /, 
  i am not sure if it 's because i only got a vip ticket, 
  same here in san diego . 
  bought mine and no e-mail regarding the album : /, 
   ~ ~ ol\u00e9 ! ~ ~, 
  what ? 
  are mental illnesses some sort of new pokemon ? 
  wait wait . . ucsd stands for university of california san diego ? 
  yep , i 'm gon na request that border wall to become taller ... 
  not gon na have that kind of crap in the universities over here in tj . 
  i usually am between bra-less or sports bra . 
  get home , take off the work uniform and the bra . 
  going out , sports bra . 
  casual-going-out clothes ? 
  a ` regular ' bra . 
  i 'm a b-cup and this kind of works for me . 
  i occasionally shave my legs and i almost never wear make up . 
  i should probably be the most empowered female in the universe ... but then again i just like to be * comfortable * . 
  you , i like you . 
  and would n't quetzalcoalt work better in this context ? 
  as a tijuanense , i 'd like to ask ... why ca n't border volleyball be like this irl ? 
  i do n't know . . but i do n't think talking about politics in the beach with a random stranger would be something plausible . 
  i 'll give it a 15 in the scale of 100 of that happening . 
  or as i like to call it , my `` happenings '' scale . 
  why be just smoke when you can be [ smoke ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/mkwikia/images/a/ab/smokerenderexp2.png/revision/latest?cb=20110520040849 ) ? 
  this is just another proof that while their delusions are off the charts , they are n't really creative with it : /, 
  ... well , that was fast . 
  i 'm just going to dump some art here later . 
  predictions !, 
  - it 'll be a cute episode where peridot will discover the wonders of earth and start her eventual conversion ( not really redemption , i 'm going more towards a neutral party ) . 
  she may or may not summon her weapon to protect steven ( most likely by accident ),
