  i would * think * that what one would want when vocalizing some actions or movements is for people to ** look at you **, 
  if you are too shy for being shown in public and let the public know you , either learn to moderate what you let out about you or ** step the fuck out **, 
  can confirm : i 'm a time traveler investigating the many times censorship has been used for ` peace ', 
  as a mexican , i can confirm that she makes sacrifices to the aztec gods . 
  that is why her series rips our hearts out . 
  so i do n't exist because i open the door to guys , and i 'm pretty sure i 've paid for dinner for 3 of my best ( male ) friends and a possible ( male ) date . 
  on regards to the seat : fuck you m ` am/sir , unless you do need the seat . 
  i got it first t t ;, 
  more like i did and he nevrr realized it = . = ; ; ;, 
  ouch . . that reminds me of my heart gold . 
  for some bizarre reason , i used to keep my game catridges * on my fucking wallet *, 
  lo , and behold , my wallet was stolen . 
  i had no money on it but i cried like a baby realizing my diamond and heart gold ( with pokemon from gen iii and had survived a car jacking ) were just gone ... 
  sit down kids , allow manga-san tell you one of her strange adventures and how it relates to these topics . 
  back when i was in my first year of secondary school ( 7th grade for the us ) , i wanted to play ~ ~ soccer ~ ~ football . 
  problem was , there was only a men 's team ( as it is customary in mexico ) . 
  so i simply shrugged , and got in the group given that i was used to play football with my male peers back in elementary so why the fuck would that change ? 
  we got into some actual tourneys and while we did n't even reach the quarterfinals we had fun . 
  the school principal ( granted , my secondary school was a * catholic * school ) almost flipped half the school when she realized i ( a girl ) was playing with the ( male ) football team . 
  she even called my mother and my mother coming from a line of people that is used to do `` manly '' stuff stared at her wondering what the fuzz was all about . 
  in the end , my first year of secondary was awesome and i was a well respected defense/lateral in the team . 
  then . 
  . . came * the change *, 
  2nd year kicks in and , lo and behold . 
  a ** female soccer team **, 
  i guess i could say my dream was fulfilled , except that the girls that got in the team squeaked when the ball passed next to them and it was * obvious * that our coach was n't pushing us as hard as with the male team . 
  was this due to sexism ? 
  i do n't really know ? 
  i myself personally thought that the girls on the team would n't even make it to tournaments and were as close as casuals as possible . 
  sadly , i ended up leaving the team since they would n't let me back into the male football team as '' * there is already a female team and you 're a girl * '' . 
  4 years later , a friend of my sister ( who also likes football ) got to my same school and got into the team as well but by then i guess they realized you * have * to treat them the same as men if you want results . 
  so in the end , my legacy remained and i think they did get past the quarterfinals once . 
  my point in this lengthy story is : women in sports are only limited by women themselves . 
  if they do not prove that they are equal or better than men , they will ** never ** garnish the same attention or spotlight . 
  granted , there are things women can only do ( like the balance bar ) and some that men can do ( like those fixed rings ) but it is only understanding what we can and we can not do that we can move to surpass certain limits . 
  nowadays , female football teams are getting more popular not only because of marketing and how pretty the girls are , but because you can actually see the skills and passion they put . . and it 's actually becoming better ( imho ) than their male counterpart , without much of the classical ` drama ' we are used to see in the sport ; more bitching while playing than bitching in the floor pretending to be hurt and delaying the clock . 
  and it was all thanks to their efforts , thanks to letting people know they are not holding back and neither should you try to . 
  ah , i guess i got too far on myself but , needless to say ... this ` person ' has no idea all the effort female athletes of any kind do . 
  if she were really for sports , she would support the athletes unconditionally , regardless if they are male or female . 
  i ca n't find it right now , but there is a rather revealing video on the internet showing just one big problem that could be presented if men tried to do balance bar exercises . 
  if i find it , i 'll leave it here so you can cringe on your own : p, 
  i know but . . 
  i guess you ca n't do that sort of thing in the olympics . 
  my first thought was this . 
  hold on , lem me see if she 's done blowing up the planet she 's working on . 
  thank mr skeltal, 
  considering how most of their otherkin are really repetitive , i do n't think they are imaginative at all : /, 
  native spanish speaker here . 
  if a name sounds like it has 'll ' 99.9 percent of the times it 's going to have a ` y ' instead . 
  like the name juliana can be spelled ( if pronounced as it is in english ) ` yuliana ' or in this `` girl 's ( or xe 's ? ), 
  case `` yelena '' . 
  we follow russian customs on this regard , i often joke . 
  that is true for mexican spanish but i 'm not sure if it 's in the rest of latin america . 
  also , it is a fact that 99.9 % of starbucks baristas are paid to have your name written wrong . 
  why is she complaining ? 
  does she want to be threaten specially by having the barista disobey their orders and write * her * name specially well ? 
  also , i do n't understand : if she 's from hispanic descent , her name ( yelena ) would n't sound like yu-leh-na but at most `` ye-le * ee * na '' or worse `` ye-li-nah '' quite odd that she * herself * mispronounces it : /, 
  it probably has to do with the fact i 'm mexican . 
  now kindly , stop appropriating the language we appropriated from spain , you shitlord ( \u25d5 \u203f \u25d5 \u273f ), 
  what the actual fuck ?!, 
  ** what ** . 
  ** the ** . 
  * actual * . 
  physics ... a male conspiracy ? 
  look around you bitch !, 
  we are all surrounded by physics . 
  physics is just one of the many sciences that allow us to understand how the world works , particularly on the mechanical level . 
  to even * think * it is gendered , though binaries do exist , is not only stupid but short sighted . 
  * this * is why dawkins said what he said about women , because you juxtapose your crazy ideals onto things that ca n't even start caring about it . 
  it 's not like one day the earth will go `` oh , right , brb ... stopping gravity because it 's fat shaming '' because you think it demeans women . 
  unless you surf to the moon or elsewhere , gravity will ** always ** be 9.81 m/s ^ 2 and there is not a damn thing you can do , no ` patriarchal ' conspiracy , no womyn being hurt except yourself when i precisely prove you how equal gravity is when i push you off a building .

  i 'm ... 
  i do n't wear make up ? 
  am i being oppressed somehow ? 
  because i had no idea really . 
  certified mexican with another rant . 
  just explain me * how * did you insulted my supposed feels with a mexican cuisine thing . 
  i have not even a * clue * as to how or why ? 
  did you get served one of those ` tacos ' with the dorito husk instead of an actual corn tortilla ? 
  or was n't it * diverse * enough for you ? 
  newsflash : mexican cuisine is * endless * thanks of the appropriation of * other cultures * and their ingredients . 
  ever heard of chamoy ? 
  yup , that was thanks to mexicans stranded in japan trying to make ume-boshi and sort of ending up doing something else . 
  burritos ( as they should be done ~ ~ norte bias here ! ~ ~ ) with wheat tortillas which we learned to do thanks to our oppressive spaniard masters . 
  let 's not forget tacos al pastor which is basically a kebab on a taco . 
  our culture is one that adapts and pulls out tasty shit from nowhere ( examples are mole , ceasar salad , chile * fucking * en nogada which in tl ; dr , we had guest , few ingredients , `` fucking mix what we have ... i 'm sure they wo n't mind '' , `` holy shit !, 
  it 's delicious ! '' ), 
  and we certainly are in the search for new stunts . 
  fucking tostilocos ... why are you so tasty ? 
  stupid tumblerinas , you can not grasp the true form of mexican food and thus will be forever in the shadows never enjoying the bounties we have for you . 
  * good * ... 
  burritos and quesadillas without flour tortillas is a sin  : |, 
  but i 'm from the north of mexico , i 'm sure the south will disagree . 
  ps : if you visit mexico city , * do * tell them you want your * quesa * dilla which cheese ... 
  there 's a ` fondita ' ( a ` house looking restaurant ) in my city that 's owned by japanese people .
