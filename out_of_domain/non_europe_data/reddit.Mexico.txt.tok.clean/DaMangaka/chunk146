  the owner married a girl from oaxaca and after a while they came here and opened the place . 
  and they serve good mexican food !, 
  if anything ... as a mexican i 'm happy people are actually interesting in learning about the day of the dead , a celebration that we do n't often see fully flourished in the northern part of the country ( i mean , it 's still celebrated but i do n't think we have reached the levels of places like [ patzcuaro ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a1tzcuaro#day_of_the_dead ) ), 
  good for you guys learning about * respecting * death and the mystical beauty it has . 
  oddly enough , there are campaigns specially over here in the north , denouncing or even wanting to ban halloween all together because it 's either satanic ( `` it has pagan roots !, 
  eets eevul ! ~ '' ) or because they do not want halloween to fully eat the day of the dead or make it a substitute . 
  i guess ` reverse cultural appropriation ' exists too ? 
  now if you excuse me , i must plan my altar dedicated to satoru iwata . 
  the pearls in homeworld are basically this : pretty jewels to show to everyone . 
  how to fucking play league of legends . 
  everyone makes it look simple but there are these items to buy and craft and these habilities/spells/casts / whatever and the next thing i know i 'm dead after just spawning . 
  my so is trying to teach me but i can feel she gets exhasperated at my infinite failures and i often withdraw so she can instead enjoy her matches with others who know what the fuck they are doing . 
  i understood pokemon evs quickly and i can make awesome teams with the correct items , attacks and stats . 
  but this . . holy crap ... what am i doing ? 
  i 've practically destroyed entire universes with my stories , species , planets ... 
  i 'm a monster ... 
  i 'm mostly a lurker . 
  not much time to mine or sell though i do have in mind opening an e-store with doge as an alt payment . 
  happy to see that my city has an atm that dispenses and deposits dogecoin : ), 
  `` hello ? 
  is this the hacker named 4 chan ? '', 
  speaking of con-science i usually pair it with explorers , with con-science going first . 
  it seems though that con-science does lead or is paired with the globalist as i also have it on one of my playlists . 
  it goes as follows :, 
  * [ ^ previous ], 
  * con-science, 
  * explorers, 
  ( until around min 18 ), 
  * aftermath, 
  * the globalist, 
  * drones < - sad ending, 
  * glorious < - follow up if you want a happy ending . 
  i have 6 playlists full of muse if anybody is interested , one in spotify . 
  sad that you can only shuffle though : /, 
  the way i manage it on one of my playlists ( and in the story that i use said playlist on ) is that there was a confrontation between two groups . 
  one of them said ` fuck this ' and forfeiting realizing that what they were fighting for was n't that well worth it . 
  world domination or what ever is n't that important when you feel loved and part of the world ( aftermath ) . 
  meanwhile , the other party ( or the lone leader that was left ) just ponders why that other one left and tries to continue ( the globalist ) only to realize too late how what a bad idea it was ( drones ), 
  my muse, 
  as a mexican , i want to grab that kid ... and hug the fuck out of him . 
  that is the * most * adorable costume ever and i ca n't believe none had thought of it before . 
  i have been killed ... by adorableness . 
  watch them explode as i say `` but not all people from the united states are american . 
  are you assuming that * only * people from the us are american ? 
  does that mean that * i * as a mexican breathe anti-blackness ? 
  how dare you assume that about my people ! '', 
  and they coil as their own logic is thrown back at them with a double serving of cultural appropriation . 
  but mostly , i 'd just put my headphones on and walk away . 
  it makes me * cringe * when they use that or @ instead of a fucking a or o. 
  like ... * why * ? 
  why butcher spanish that much ? 
  we already have the chilangos ~ ~ and the chileans ~ ~ doing that . 
  much like how there are many ways of saying ` i ' . 
  there 's the basic `` watashi '' for everyone , atashi for females , boku for males ( and tomboyish girls ) , ore for men ( which is rather rude ) , washi for older people or in a certain position ... 
  language in japan changes not only regarding gender but formalities and ` class ' . 
  rather interesting . 
  and this is why i 'm happy to live in * baja * california , where bullshit like this is laughed upon . 
  i like how she disregarded the murdered russians/ukranians/yugoslavs / eastern europeans killed by stalin and how suddenly the armenians are * not * white . 
  : | would n't that make you `` arab-passing '' or what ever ? 
  huh ... seems the whole ` right by blood ' thing has n't died quite yet . 
  excuse me ... but the correct word is shlicking . 
  now if you excuse me , i 'll be in my dungeon writing mc f/f hentai . 
  ok , let 's make it simple for kids then !, 
  ** on sexuality **, 
  do you want to fuck the other gender ? 
  then you are * heterosexual *, 
  do you want to fuck your own gender ? 
  then you are * homosexual *, 
  how about both genders ? 
  then you are * bisexual *, 
  you do n't give a shit about fucking ? 
  then you are * asexual *, 
  ** on genders **, 
  are you comfortable being a guy/girl ? 
  you 're * cisgendered *, 
  want to be the other gender so bad you may want to kill yourself ? 
  you 're * transgender *, 
  were you * born * with bits of either gender ? 
  they you are one of those rare * intersexual * people, 
  you do n't give a shit about your gender ? 
  maybe you 're * asexual * or * genderqueer * !, 
  there . 
  that should be more understandable than ... that . 
  do you know * why * girls do n't go to stem ? 
  because they will more likely either ( according to my experience ) :, 
  a ) join the same school/degree as their female peers . 
  b ) not interested in the things stem offers ( among those things advanced calculus , physics and mathematics ) . 
  do you know how * not * to get girls into stem ? 
  by policing their choices . 
  it is not ` grandiose ' or a breakthrough if a woman chooses stem . 
  maybe 30 years ago but now , in an era you can choose what you want to be , they are well free to use their will and choices to either head the path of stem or become one of the many women 's studies jobless lass that exist out there . 
  a path each and everyone of them chooses . 
  do not be afraid of being the leader of your own life . 
  signed ,, 
  a pigeon with a stem degree . 
  i 'm surprised tia has decided to head in that direction and now i fear that it might slowly morph into the very thing they laugh about . 
  there 's a lot of reposts and nonsense being posted there as of recent and that 's made me wonder what was going on with the mod team . 
  soon , tia will become horseshoeinaction and i 'll just shake my head while i sip tea . 
  i for i welcome this new sub and i 'll just go ahead and make it my new home while i clean the windows in kia, 
  it 's ok . you deserve rest : ),
