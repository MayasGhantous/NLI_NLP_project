  why ? 
  well , society moves you to do stuff you do n't want due to the need to merge in . 
  there 's nothing worse for people than to become an outcast in a society . 
  * [ ... ] decides who you marry : up until the 1960s , you could n't marry black people . 
  heck , forget the black people : there are stigmas still of ` interracial ' marriage on certain parts . 
  if you marry somebody not from your country , social level , race , you are doing bad . 
  on another topic but of the similar strain : gays ca n't marry . 
  i mean , they * could try to * but it is not legal nor get any benefits `` straights '' do just because some book 2000 years old says it 's icky . 
  i 'm not saying the ussr ~ ~ or russia for that matter atm ~ ~ is better but . 
  * [ ... ] decide how many children . 
  : you know , it 's odd you say this because the fact that in the us they pretty much condemn birth control is exactly not being able to decide . 
  how ? 
  well , you can go ahead and have 9000 + children , that 's your choice . 
  but what about if i * do n't * want to ? 
  do i get a choice if , for example , i was raped and did n't want the child ? 
  in many parts it 's illegal . 
  what if i decide to have ivf because of x reason i ca n't have them on my own ? 
  some governments have restrictions or ban the procedure completely . 
  being given a choice is to have two * different * options . 
  if i hold you hostage with a gun , would you like me to shoot your head or smack you with it ? 
  it 's different , right ? 
  ~ ~ btw , the 1 child policy you might be poking around with this from china was kind of necessary as 1/3 of the world is chinese . 
  you 'd think that if you have that many chinese you 'd want to have more ? ~ ~, 
  what you eat . 
  : money here is the issue . 
  i do n't think you can afford an elegant dinner at `` delacroix '' if you earn less than 400 bucks a week . 
  you 'll be better off eating mc ` donalds and pre-heated food . 
  what you wear . 
  : you clearly do n't see e ! , mtv or for that matter ads in your tv . 
  good for you * claps *, 
  what you read : i 'm sure that if i go and read the `` god delusion '' in redneck texas i wo n't be kicked . 
  or if i take `` the origin of the species '' or `` a brief history of time '' to school and read it in my ` read out loud ' classes i wo n't be kicked afterwards in recess . 
  what you listen to : i suppose you have heard about how president obama has enacted a law that would allow the government to spy into the internet , right ? 
  heck , let 's not go all ` conspiracy nuts ' here : why ca n't my radio play outright `` it 's britney b * tch '' on that song that i keep hearing over and over again ? 
  it 's blatantly obvious that word is there . 
  decides what you say : why are you saying communism is bad . 
  give me one good argument that ussr communism is n't like us ' capitalism . 
  note : the word `` commie '' is not allowed nor the post you have just used . 
  also , russia is no longer `` soviet '' . 
  good !, 
  why is that so ? 
  why are we even having this convo in the first place ? 
  oh , and btw , did you about how the us placed dictators in latin america during the 60s just to prevent communism to spread ? 
  nothing makes them free-er than a nutjob that likes to kill people that speak out against his ruler . 
  totally not a bad thing to do . 
  at least they wo n't turn out into evil ungodly commies like cuba . 
  . who even after the cold war ended has n't gotten it 's embargo taken off which if taken away would actually collapse the castro regime . 
  what you think ? 
  : i 'll reply this in a bit . 
  decides where you live and what job you have : this is the reason of the economical collapse we are facing . 
  there are dozens of well prepared people out there . 
  people who worked hard to get their bachelors degree or even phds but ca n't get a job because it 's cheaper to hire an internee . 
  or people who had to move * far away * from their birthplaces that holds really nothing bad in it but is too ` small ' to function due to industries in the big cities . 
  let 's cite my city for example : mexico 's south is horribly poor , no question about that . 
  however , many could somewhat subsist with selling crops and meats to the us . 
  enter nafta - which is a capitalist envision , mind you - and we end up being unable to compete with the us ' industry . 
  unable to sell more crops , foods or natural resources , many started to move up ( most to the us . 
  this is pretty much the reason behind illegal crossings ) . 
  border cities like mine became stations for cheap manufacturing factories where these people of lower education and experience could be hired and work for `` better '' salaries . 
  however , it removed the work force required to sustain agriculture and thus the country 's gdp went partially to hell ( the other side includes the banks dying and politicians stealing money . 
  it 's a long story ) . 
  who won ? 
  well , of course , the companies who needed this cheap labor from somewhere . 
  this style of capitalism , by the way , is called [ neo-liberalism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neoliberalism ) and is the main cause of the collapse as we know it today . 
  what i want to say with this is that capitalism is no different than communism in various aspects . 
  perhaps it is even worse . 
  perhaps it 's better . 
  but the point is that no , capitalism is not exactly a good doctrine but it is not necessarily evil . 
  the world is not black or white . 
  um , not to be rude or anything but i built my first pc at age 10 . 
  it 's not that amazing : / you do need some patience and knowledge of components though . 
  ... i 'm skeptic about this . 
  it 's too perfect . 
  survival by muse . 
  really , there are literately thousands of people in mexico who could go for the reward if they wanted to . 
  not to be rude with guatemaltecans ( since it 's not their fault ) but their situation is more fucked up than ours . 
  how was it that :, 
  a ) they shot the chapo guzman there, 
  b ) wtf was he doing there ? 
  was n't he like living in a mansion in miami ? 
  brb , / r/conspiracy, 
  anglo ? 
  i love how , despite there being many interpretations to something as `` simple '' as 1 +1 , the knowledge of each view complements or is complemented by somebody else 's . 
  it is the wonders of science which likes to construct things to create new things . 
  i remember i was working at a call center at the moment and somebody over the line was sort of trying * not * to cry over something . 
  he then apologized to me saying that he had just heard the news about steve irwin 's death . 
  right.in.the.feels . 
  we proceeded to talk about it and despite my 13min max i could aim at , we spent 2 hours in there , mourning , talking . 
  at the end , the problem he had with his computer was at his end and thanked me for my time . 
  i went to school and then home and i just locked myself to draw some crappy `` thank you steve '' memorial . 
  i could have posted mr. rogers too but until recently i learned he had passed away . 
  but steve irwin . 
  man , that day was surreal . 
  i can sum the greatness of my country [ in this song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuowf2og3ne ), 
  i would name my girl samus . 
  wikipedia or twitter . 
  if i had no internet at all , i 'd be writing parts of my book or fanfiction . 
  getting my own house, 
  you know , this baffled me for an endless time . 
  according to the story of creation , adam and eve were the first people on earth .
