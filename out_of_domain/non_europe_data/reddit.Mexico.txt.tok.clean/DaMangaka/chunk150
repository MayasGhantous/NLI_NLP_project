  do n't get me wrong , i already was working by then but i had no way to pay electronically and i did n't want to get caught buying wii e-shop cards . 
  that said , i did it all in secret because i knew that using a card without permission was wrong and i even felt immediately bad even if i got me one of those 2 usd wii ` game/apps ' . 
  i can not fathom how this ** '' ** kid ** '' ** could spend usd 8k in this economy , let alone pretend to be stupid about how e-commerce works given that most , if not all , transactions ask you at least 2 times * before * you buy anything . 
  this is both lack of responsibility from the kid and the parents for not catching that shit up the first 500 usd ( or heck !, 
  do n't you have txt/e-mail/app notifications nowadays ? 
  it 's not like back in my time where you had to wait the month for the bill to come to your address ... ) and smack the idiot a new one . 
  tijuanense poking here after reading the whole debacle about the la move : i. . . honestly thought you got your soccer kick ( lol ) with the xolos . 
  not that they are really that good ( i 've grown to dislike the mexican soccer league out how raunchy it has become . . ) but i see a * lot * people crossing to see them . 
  in comparison , a lot of tj people cross to see the chargers either at pubs or stadiums money/usd allowing . 
  so , comic-con 's hall h line ? 
  watched schindler 's list and while i get misty eyed i can watch it again no problem . 
  this movie is a whole other world, 
  as somebody that was in ga i can fully confirm this is true . 
  being in the middle , at the side of the `` harmonica giving '' area is cool for pictures but if you want a chance at goodies , follow the map . 
  does it have to be painting or do you accept digital illustrations ? 
  and they get them really young too : (, 
  if `` the perfect dictatorship '' 's ending says anything , some will owe their lives to them forever ... 
  well , they do give them to you : you can still download ( for example ) the full adobe cs6 master suite [ from their website ] ( https://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/policy-pricing/cs6-product-downloads.html ) without a problem . 
  of course , you need to have the ways to activate it properly to make it run past the 30 day trial . 
  being honest : do i have a chance doing a in store pre-order at 7pm or it 's better to try to get the pre-order via the internet ? 
  i hope it 's not the latter because for some reason the gamestop online store hates my cards . 
  * all * of my cards !, 
  that 's ... interesting . 
  my lucas amiibo arrived rather swiftly to my big surprise . 
  the biggest surprise being that i pre-ordered via amazon ** mexico ** whom i never thought they 'd be able to give a service akin to the us . 
  i guess i should stop shooting down local services without giving them a try . 
  sucks that it 's taking a bit longer with the us pre-orders : (, 
  when it * does * happen , let me know so i attempt to buy one . 
  i * need * him . 
  i was interested in getting fe fates . 
  the mechanics and the characters and even freaking corrin made me consider throwing 100 bucks worth of money on the three games . 
  given this bullshit and drama , i 'm just going to keep ignoring it as i have and finish playing bayoneta . 
  are you in america or europe ? , because g&w is up with the retro package @ gamestop 0 0, 
  my first link ( that linked to aj + 's facebook , my bad ) i understand it being taken down but i had no idea about viewpure . 
  i 'll have that in mind later . 
  to be honest , up until now i did n't knew about the site . 
  ^ please ^ do n't ^ kill ^ me ^ mama ^ diablo, 
  i was in the middle of answering it when my power got cut off : /, 
  sucks but oh well ... 
  it was n't really that hard ( as far as i could answer ) . 
  about time if you asked me : p, 
  i was confused about that when i first got them . 
  pretty much ignored them like the rest but ... that 's a rather odd way to try to convince people to try your coin : /, 
  as somebody who can fall easily to depression , i can confirm / r/worldnews can help you a lot to get really depressed . 
  mostly thanks to the comments on the threads ... 
  only collect smash amiibo . 
  so far i have 40 of them , looking forward for obtaining ryuu , roy and the last 3 dlcs when announced . 
  i 'll import japanese r.o.b just because i feel it 's necessary for it to say `` robot '' rather than `` famicon colors '', 
  i have gotten the splatoon set and the two clasic marios but other than that , just sticking to smash . 
  if you loved `` el infierno '' you 're going to love the rest of the ` saga ' the director has . 
  these are `` un mundo maravilloso '' , `` ley de herodes '' and most recently `` la dictadura perfecta '' . 
  mexican horror movies are actually not really that bad ( kilometro 31 is a good example imho ) . 
  there 's also `` la jaula de oro '' , `` como agua para chocolate '' , `` el crimen del padre amaro '' . 
  vacations are usually in the us for me ( las vegas , los angeles/anaheim ) but when we do decide to travel to mexico it 's to places with beaches : rocky point , canc\u00fan , mazatl\u00e1n . 
  i visited some 2 years ago puebla and mexico city and it was like going to a brand new world , specially historical puebla . 
  really lovely . 
  with mazatlan , given that it 's the place my parents come from , we mostly go with the family so that 's that . 
  suburb tijuana here . 
  i rather like it where i am : i 'm not too outside from the * municipio * but not in the middle at a rather expensive place . 
  tijuana does n't have much rural areas left ~ ~ ( that 's what tecate is for ) ~ ~ but it 's currently booming with a bunch of art , culinary tastes and a sense of adventure . 
  people are crossing more not to buy curios or for the typical sex/drugs/rock n ' roll , they are doing so because they want to explore what the city has to offer and it kind of makes me proud . 
  downtown tijuana has changed quite a bit and can be kind of comparable to downtown san diego . 
  heck !, 
  even the red district looks amazing !, 
  er ... no : / sorry . 
  though i would n't be surprised there are mexicans over there . 
  we 're kind of like the spanish inquisition nowadays , except that we * are * expected . 
  oh * wow * , this is going to be a big section . 
  as i said , tijuana is becoming more than just sex/drugs but it has already left it 's mark . 
  the first ( and correct me if i 'm wrong ) noticeable narco cartel was the tijuana cartel with the arellano-felix . 
  during their existence the city was ... ok ? 
  it was only when they got targeted personally that they retaliated or made their move . 
  as far as i can recall , during the 90s most of the victims were people who dealt with them , meddled with or those who worked for ` el zeta ' ( a newspaper , not related to the zetas * cartel * ) . 
  when the big heads started to be taken down ( and the * sinaloa * cartel moved in to be the no . 
  1 , ... smh sinaloa ... ) that 's when things began to escalate more . 
  on top of that , calder\u00f3n ordered a full fledged attack against the cartels ( 2006 ) . 
  the murders got more noticeable and by 2008 when the us economical crisis struck - and many * maquiladoras * started to shut down here , leaving thousands unemployed - violence and crime skyrocketed . 
  sure , not to the point were there was a curfew but you * really * had to watch your back or not be alone . 
  people hanging on bridges ( mostly by the only freeway we have , causing more traffic ... ) , beheadings ... the things we heard only to happen in michoacan ... we started to see them here and people were really * really * afraid . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's because people got back to being occupied at work ( circa 2010 when the us crisis got a biiiiiiiiit better ) or thanks to the military but the city went back to a less murdery state . 
  right now , you only find about gruesome deaths in newspaper like `` alerta ! '', 
  or in the `` policiacas '' section of a newspaper ( which is mostly at this point petty theft , guy stabbed another due to some cockfight or drug possession ) . 
  drugs and sex will be and always be a part of tijuana ... and that might be the reason why it knows how to fend itself well from the consequences of it ? 
  i 'm not sure really , but i 'd like to think of it as such . 
  if you do come to tijuana , know that you wo n't find narcos or narco related activities here ... unless you * look * for them . 
  it 's ( as they say it around here ) the bread of each day . 
  you hear every kind of immigrant story here : the guy that jumped over , got a nice job , made a family , even started a business , and then got detained by a cop and kicked out without even letting him defend himself ; the girl who had a child and the guy no longer wanted her to be with him so he told the border agents about her status and got brought to mexico ... even though she 's from guatemala ; the ones that abuse the 6 month visa and only come back to tijuana to renew it and `` go to disneyland '' ( or get hitched ) ; the guy who found out the ` american dream was a lie ' and decided to bring his dolars and start a successful business in tijuana and now is planning to open a franchise ; the guy who has hopped the border so many times they know * when * and * how * and now offers his services ... 
  you can get a ny best seller book out of any of the stories the immigrants have here . 
  the border is kind , the border is horrible , the border is a challenge . 
  lots of ` drop outs ' along the tijuana river channel , others working in places like ~ ~ hell ~ ~ telvista hoping to start over again at a city that allowed them to stay there regardless of their true origins or reasons , the ones that * brought * their american ( or canadian ) spouse here because it 's cheaper to live and still reap the benefits of san diego ... and this is one of the many reasons i love my city . 
  i do n't want to sound posh or anything but ... living at a border city , i * will * assume you know english * and * spanish or i 'm going to think that you did n't have a proper education ( speaking about tijuanenses ) . 
  to have a decent life here , you got to at least understand english . 
  99.9 percent of the maquiladoras will ask you if you know any bit of english and the possibilities of having a better job rely on that ( to the point now they are asking 3rd languages like chinese or japanese , specially for the asian maquilas ) . 
  since we have tourists , that 's also a plus . 
  many of us ( until cable became common ) grew with san diego 's channel 6 so we got exposure to english too . 
  i will probably cringe if you have a * very * noticeable spanish accent in your english but i 'll accept it . 
  what still perplexes me is people ( specially in my field ) that ca n't or wo n't speak english at all . 
  it 's just like '' * why ? 
  * * how * did you get your job then ? '', 
  my family over here in tj knows english ( mum ca n't speak it but sort of understands it .
