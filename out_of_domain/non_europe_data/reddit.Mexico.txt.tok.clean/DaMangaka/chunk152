  there are a lot of dentists in tj that catter to you guys in the north ( the even take us insurance ! ), 
  and while i can give you addresses to many of the downtown tj dentist clinics , in my experience one of the best dentists i 've gone to is one that is by plaza galer\u00edas . 
  their clinic looks really clean and professional and they have highly qualified personel that tell you each detail of what they 'll do to you . 
  the first check up is for free and they 'll also use it to make a quote on everything you need . 
  there is also the option of making many appointments so they work little by little on you ( and not spend the moneyload on one sit ) . 
  i do n't remember if they do take us insurances but i 'm pretty sure they do . 
  speaking of ... 
  i need to make an appoinment soon < <, 
  i only watch e3 for the lulz tbf . 
  most of the games are n't much of my interest but i do like to see * how * they promote them . 
  i wonder if ubisoft will learn this year ... or ea , but i do n't have my hopes that high . 
  i 've heard both the latam dub and the english one and i think i like the english one * only * because i got into su listening to the english version . 
  i 'm pretty sure that if i had first seen it in spanish i 'd be going more for the latam . 
  imho , i like yellow diamond 's voice but that last boom in the end is n't as strong as the english version . 
  still , an * excellent * choice for their cold uncaring tone . 
  peridot 's latam voice is my total fave , same with garnet . 
  fun fact : at the conventions in my city where i sell su stickers , it 's funny to see 7 year to 12 year old kids who clearly have little to no grasp of english and hear them go `` oh !, 
  mira !, 
  y * garnet * '' . 
  bonus points for '' * rose * cuarzo '', 
  everyone knows cap/iron man is best marvel otp, 
  anne * fucking * rice ?!, 
  when ? 
  how ? 
  * why ? 
  i 'm just sad they 'll never finish the game . 
  however i find the end of the run a good one : arin nopes and leaves jon due to 06 . 
  best headcanon ever . 
  be honest guys , do you hate me ? 
  i love you < / 3, 
  so . . [ trixie tang ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/los-padrinos-magicos-tres-mil/images/9/90/teen_trixie_wip_coloured_by_dltoon-d65ygq1.png/revision/latest?cb=20131223015103 ) ? 
  * willingly ? 
  afaik it 's basically the european version of the tpp . 
  `` you thought it was a memory but it was i , dio '', 
  `` those who forget history are bound to repeat it '', 
  `` information is power . 
  never forget '', 
  `` and i 've seen all i 'll ever need '', 
  hey !, 
  some people like surprises ... 
  - grabby hands -, 
  i have no idea what i 'll do with them ... but * i need it ... *, 
  - claps sarcastically -, 
  soaked, 
  welp , good thing i do n't suscribe to any music service , still buy albums and obtain them from good ol' listentoyoutube when i want something exotic . 
  my family may call me an apple hater but there are [ i ] reasons [ / i ] . 
  apple is nothing more than a shell of what it was and are now more dedicated to fuck up the consumer with bullshit . 
  starting from overpricing their shit to remaining exclusive in a wold that demands connectivity . 
  then again , i own two samsung phones so i do n't know - shrug -, 
  ** you fools !, 
  ** did n't you know that was my plan all along ? 
  consider this : most of the illegal shit crossing onto the us comes from mexico . 
  now where do you think your rare pepes get rare ? 
  yes !, 
  motherfucking mexico . 
  so by banning memes you are effectively banning pepes , making them * much rarer than normal *, 
  yes !, 
  finally , my investment in pepes will finally bear fruit !, 
  * on a serious note , i heard this and my sides exploded . 
  her proposal will be taken as serious as quadri was in 2012 . 
  i 'm confused on this regard . 
  why is san diego not a good sign for a video game designer/director ? 
  welcome fleshblood !, 
  gamergate is both a simple and complicated matter to explain : on the simple end we get people who are against corruption in the media and trying to return videogames to what they used to be : games people can chillax and have a good time on . 
  on the more complicated edge , there are a * lot * of events that have forged gg to what it is today . 
  it has exposed a never ending rabit hole of not only corrupt videogame media and management but just how broad this ` cancer ' is attacking the mediums around us . 
  the manipulative agenda on social media and multimedia , the double standards , the way the law is bent and twisted , the rise of professional victims and more . 
  this is something i 've kind of grew up noticing in my country . 
  a lot of things about corrupt media , propaganda where all really ` normal ' so i was shocked to see how easily people welcomed for the sake of `` freedom '' and `` progressiveness '' . 
  i 'm still a bit in the pro-neutral ground but i am not afraid to wear the gg jacket and hat . 
  i 'm actually making a meetup for comic-con again : p, 
  so feel free to ask me some questions about what i know of the movement and why it is very comparable to the stuff that 's going on in my beloved ( but fucked up ) country . 
  remember when tokenism was seen as a bad thing ? 
  man ... those were the days ... 
  ... great goddesses ... 
  and i just live under that state . 
  that border ... it may well be the one that keeps us away but soon ... things may be * the other way around *, 
  ~ ~ coming soon to theaters ~ ~, 
  kind of the same reason why i do n't post there : /, 
  i have a pixiv account just because everyone got one ( and ... for a certain kind of research ) but unless you know japanese or have a following , nobody really comments . 
  ~ ~ not to mention that i feel as a fail artist seeing all the pretty colored pictures on the front page ... ~ ~, 
  * 4 wave * ?!, 
  wait , has the 3rd wave somehow reproduced or is this fem.uh.nazism 2.0 ? 
  i had always considered the game ghostbusters 3 . 
  decent game with a good story . 
  brought good memories . 
  meetup @ sdcc 2k16 yo !, 
  2nd time is the best time, 
  this is top quality kek . 
  holy crap ... 
  i had to watch it in chapters as i 'm at work and i really wanted to skip over the nsfw ( bit of a heads up btw . 
  there are some nsfw pics other than the shocker and twitter ones ), 
  i do n't mind furries , they have their own thing and i can understand how that can also be a fetish but ... holy * goddesses * there is a degree of where things are meant to stop . 
  starting by not fucking up the hotel you are staying on . 
  and i thought some of the lgbt pride parades were going astray , those are * tame * in comparison with * this * fuckride of a convention . 
  i thought they had learned how to pull this kind of things up when north korea `` hacked '' them , `` forcing '' them to release the interview online rather than on cinemas and having people watch it out of curiosity/morbidness . 
  there is no way in hell people would have watched it as much as they did that ` opening ' weekend they put it on hulu/google/netflix if the whole north korea hack would n't have happened . 
  so , i 'm not redditing enough ? 
  you know people have nothing else to do when they rage about some guy not going to watch a movie . 
  i mean , come on !,
