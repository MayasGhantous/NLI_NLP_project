  i felt my heart sink into my stomach and begin dissolving . 
  `` i pressed my head onto the car window , wanting to see better . 
  it looked bad but i could n't see away . 
  i 've never concentrated so well in something before and i just asked the sky or something ` please , let the people on that car be alive and well ' . 
  the thing was all over the news too !, 
  they never really said how bad they were until some 6 months later i think '', 
  `` so , that was * you * then ? '', 
  i looked at him in awe . 
  i gave him a better background of the story , about the kind of guy jimmy was and just what a fucked up ` stir ' i gave to his luck . 
  ace was already at my school , so i did n't put much attention to the news that the ` kid in the truck accident ' had miraculously popped out from coma and was well and alive , if not with some healing to do still . 
  `` yep , i guess that was also my first ` major ' . 
  it really drained me , i 'll admit . '', 
  he laughed . 
  `` i then thought that if somebody could give such a good luck to a person , then somebody has to do the contrary . 
  so i shifted * my * luck so i could find that person . '', 
  `` the lottery ! '', 
  `` yeah !, 
  really , i never expected that . 
  i guess good luck works differently than bad . 
  dad got the extra cash and put me in here . 
  it was just a matter of time before i found you . 
  i guess i can thank my lucky stars . '', 
  and we laughed and laughed at that ridiculous joke . 
  of course , we both knew nobody would find us while we did given how the door could only be opened by the inside - a bit of my working - and they had just recently waxed that school corridor so nobody would pass by for at least 30 minutes . 
  since then , we 've been partners in a lot of things . 
  we mastered our ` shift ' craft to serve our needs and other people 's needs as you can see . 
  so , here 's the deal : i can hook you up with ace when ever you are ready to change your luck ... just remember , i 'll be watching and it 'd be a real * shame * if something bad were to happen . 
  the autodesk that make cad software ? 
  if the screen is touchable ... 
  i may well not buy a surface after all ... 
  edit : so apparently it does n't have a touchscreen ? 
  i 'm now puzzled at what autodesk may bring to the switch . 
  `` so , remember the times when we were saying just how awful these kind of scenarios would be . 
  how we were totally prepared for the zombie apocalypse , how it was a matter of time before skynet - i mean skynet - took control of all computers and started killing or controlling humanity and how the presidential run would end with a double suicide of some sort while it was revealed the alien reptilians were behind it all ? '', 
  `` yeah ? 
  what about it ? '', 
  `` i find the whole thing ... boring to say the least . 
  i guess part of the charm of these scenarios were that we really never expected them to come true , like how independence day was - '', 
  `` hold on , the first one or the second ? '', 
  `` the second '', 
  `` shit man , there was n't really an need for a sequel ... '', 
  a pair of men in their later 30s were outside sat on a porch that belonged to a house in a once quiet suburban area in chicago . 
  they had a insulated bag beside them with a half done six pack , no ice . 
  a bummer really but since most stores were vacated or simply closed due to the lack of electricity , that was all they could run with . 
  `` anyways , remember how i said that the movie made really no sense ? 
  mindless destruction and special effects for the kick of it ? 
  this is how this whole thing feels like man . 
  like , what 's the whole idea behind it ? '', 
  the man took a long chug , trying not too taste the drink on his hand . 
  miller light ... out of all the things that could pass for a last drink . 
  `` you know what sucks the most about it ? '', 
  `` what ? '', 
  said the other man , eyeing at the other cans . 
  he was n't taking that route . 
  `` we could have said so much about it , man . 
  we could have been laughing about other people 's comments about this shit . 
  the memes would be ridiculous and we 'd enjoy this much more better . 
  can you imagine all the idiots live streaming in facebook their last meals , their last rites . '', 
  `` does live leak allow streams ? '', 
  `` shit man , '' the man with the beer stood up , tossing the half-finished can to the lawn . 
  `` we could have gotten the best of worst ends in the world . 
  instead , we 'll just wait in silence . '', 
  `` alone . '', 
  the pair looked to the sky . 
  there was a ball of fire headed their way . 
  in probably days or so they would cease to exist . 
  not a single comment or macro to frame the thoughts of 1 billion lives that would simply stop existing . 
  all was right with the world . 
  i might be a bit crazy but ... 
  i think mr. edgeworth was staring at mr. 
  powers from time to time during the trial . 
  could it be that he ... likes the show ? 
  nah , that 's just ridiculous . 
  what kind of a respectable man likes sentai ? 
  they seem to do good restaurant places : pancake house , sushi la postal , torta plaza . 
  i thought blockbuster was going to last a bit longer over here , but then came the double combo of vidbox and netflix and that was pretty much it . 
  i 'm just annoyed i bought ( probably ) their last membership card on my nearest blockbuster about a year ago to rent a videogame which did n't even work  : |, 
  now they are closed . 
  good riddance . 
  you 're assuming he gets enough money to own something . 
  nah , he just walks . 
  i 'm no u/awildsketchappeared . . but if you give me references for ken bones , i can work something up : p, 
  just upvoting and posting for the lulz . 
  let the waiting , begin !, 
  i. . . made a sub for to fulfill challenge . 
  i 'm probably mad 0 70 ;, 
  my sub or that i 'm crazy ? 
  i 'm not really sure if i want to . 
  my project is pretty much an elaborate fanfiction that i 've wanted to do for the longest of time and i 'm kind of ... embarrassed ? 
  ( it 's a serious project mind you , but i still find it embarrassing given the inspiration ), 
  i realize that many are writing fanfiction . 
  fuck it , put it as my flair :, 
  / r/projecthetalia, 
  space dementia or the full exogenesis suite, 
  got an account there but ... meh, 
  it 's there, 
  shine 's been playing here for a while already : '' (, 
  [ bgm ] ( https://youtu.be/3ahe1-wauai ), 
  `` yes , xanadu ? '', 
  in a dimly lit part in his small california department , kenta sakamoto flipped the cover of his tablet towards the screen , covering it before turning his head to the being that was looking at him from behind .
