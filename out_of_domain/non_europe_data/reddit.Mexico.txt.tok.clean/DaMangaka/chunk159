  as the mothership lifted from the asteroid , jean pierre remain silently staring at the picture inside the locket from his seat . 
  a pair of pictures depicting a younger wilhelm and a lady with similar factions as the gyniod laid inside facing each other . 
  outside , the base began to collapse imploding out of existence . 
  but in his memory , and in the memory of his comrades , they would be remembered , eternally . 
  `` technically , the name is ` time and space patrol but ' ... '', 
  `` are you using that archaic name still ? 
  sahnct ` eh ` ara , who ever came up with that name must have had little to no cleverness . '', 
  `` or creativity for that matter . '', 
  it was a panel of three groups , each of them sporting their own brand of uniform and name tags that bared the position they worked in . 
  the ones that dressed simpler were simply ` historians ' , something roderick assumed was a job more connected to an office clerk mashed with a librarian . 
  the ones in more elaborate suits gave an indicator of being veterans in time travel , some sporting some honor medals on their sleeves and one with indicators of a militarized force rather than an association . 
  lastly there was a fancy ` elite ' that dressed almost indistinguishable between the groups with the exception of some details here and there that differed , possibly a sign of their originating timelines . 
  from his location on the oval table he sat in , roderick sighed . 
  he had cited the association with the idea of having a small discussion on a certain series events that had happened lately and was ready to demand some answers . 
  `` enough . '', 
  he glared at the groups , adjusting his glasses . 
  `` i will not tolerate any more drivel from either of you lots . 
  i wish to understand the circumstances of your existence and the impact it has done during the coursing year . 
  i expect clarity in your answers as you expect me to remain silent about this meeting . '', 
  `` well , '' a short haired lass with curly hair chimed in , adjusting her own pair of thinly framed glasses . 
  she had a kind of nordic accent in her english `` from the data i currently have , the year 2016 is infamously known as the ` year of the impossible ' due to the aptly-named impossibilities that occurred on it 's wake . '', 
  `` however , '' a rather muscular man leaned to the front , placing his chin on top of his hands . 
  `` there is no proof that such actions are a direct result of time travel . 
  we would be well aware of that , if such is the case . '', 
  `` that would be true , if you had started your monitoring about 30 years from your timeline . '', 
  a hispanic sounding lady from the west corner of the table leaned towards his direction . 
  roderick was n't sure if the paleness of her skin and lack of hair color was natural of hers or a consequence of her job . 
  `` surely you did a great job doing that . '', 
  `` now , now '' the woman with the curls waved a hand gently , holding a sort of clipboard with the other . 
  tablet , actually , as it was later shown to eject some sort of hologram with the press of a button . 
  `` we are an institute that had just started working on the scheme of time travel . 
  we basically discovered it by accident while tracking a notorious criminal mastermind . '', 
  `` you mean the chick that slept with your boss that turned out to be lawyer ? '', 
  from the eastern side , a member of the association looked at the other two groups with a degree of disdain . 
  `` i heard he was actually a dude . '', 
  `` i * can not * believe the level of insensitivity i 'm hearing . '', 
  `` what ? 
  it 's true , ya know ? '', 
  '' ** enough ** '' blared roderick again . 
  the groups mumbled between each other briefly before quieting down for good . 
  `` now , as far as some agree , you were not involved in these changes at all ? '', 
  `` nope . '', 
  `` actually , we kind of traveled back in time asking that same question . '', 
  `` oh really ? '', 
  asked the albino . 
  `` and what were your findings , sirs from the future association of time travelers ? '', 
  `` there 's a m ` am here '' muttered an asian looking woman wearing what could be a cross of a lean space-suit and louis vuitton . 
  `` it was surprising to say the least , '' said a russian sounding man from the association . 
  although there was a/c , he wore a fleece hat . 
  '' * our * registers show that heading to the year 2016 creates some sort of loophole where the results are the same : you either end up on january 1st at 00:01 or * december * 31st at 11:59:59 . '', 
  `` we have theorized '' chimed the first from the association 's group , a tall burly black man with died blue hair . 
  `` that when time travel was completely viable and cleared , several groups or ` turns ' went to revise key timelines so many times , it just filled up the ` spots ' to travel to them . 
  we found easily 500 ` turns ' trying to get access to 2016 at one cycle , which is rather peculiar given that years like 1945 or ` tempo novo ' which is what we call year ' 0 ' usually has around 250 to 356 on their highest momentum . '', 
  `` jeesh , so it 's went to 356 turns for 1945 ? 
  you 'd think killing hitler would become some sort of sporting event by now . '', 
  the albino rolled her eyes . 
  `` of course , time paradox laws prevents disassociation with the timeline we are visiting so is n't any possibility of that sort . '', 
  denoted a tall man behind her , placing a hand over her shoulder and squeezing it lightly . 
  `` tch , it was just a joke . '', 
  `` to answer your question in short , '' said the asian glancing at the middle group . 
  `` no , we could n't have done anything of the sort . 
  neither to cause it or even to prevent it . 
  what is worse , our perplexity has caused a look that basically keeps us away for at least some 10 years more . 
  maybe 20 if our little conversation does n't rise up people 's interests on the matter . '', 
  `` well , there 's always 2024 '' chuckled the muscular man , shaking his head . 
  `` wait , 2024 ? '', 
  roderick stared at them with worry . 
  `` what happens in 2024 . '', 
  `` let 's just say , without giving you much details , that you better start practicing your spanish or french . '', 
  came in for a muse reference . 
  was not disapoint . 
  in the middle of the city , a thunderous roar . 
  as long lasting as an alarm and as earth shattering as an explosion . 
  people all around started to flee from their lives , some leaving behind their piled up cars on the freeway after realizing they could have a better chance running on their very two feet . 
  despair and chaos . 
  a typical scene straight out of a classic monster movie : godzilla , the king of monsters had arrived to claim his throne . 
  `` you 'd think that with a name as mine i would be able to doodle around in the air and pull out something , right ? '', 
  da mangaka said as she walked to the edge of the rooftop , using third person for the story . 
  it sounds better anyways , proper for these kind of situations . 
  `` i may not be able to tap onto heaven 's door , but there 's always exogenesis . '', 
  `` i 'm surprised you have n't seen the series . '', 
  said my editor who calmly saw the scene beside me . 
  `` there 's a thin line between referencing and copying a mangaka you know ? 
  regardless of they are from this or other worlds . 
  i got my own style and i think i can make it work . '', 
  da mangaka 's hand moved towards a golden key that hung from a necklace and gently pulled it out from it 's position . 
  after a quick glance , she threw it up towards the air , allowing it to grow up to 6ft before catching it with her right hand . 
  `` well , time to get mr. kaiju back to where he belongs . 
  ready to do your job ? '', 
  she said , grinning at him with excitement . 
  `` as long as you do n't procrastinate too much on it . '', 
  * perhaps you may wonder though why a golden key as a weapon of choice instead of a pen . 
  that might take 10 more years to explain if she does n't skip schedule - editor *, 
  i 'm interested but i 'm working on a project of my own . 
  could work making the comic covers though . 
  the corner of the world , also known as the `` happiest place on earth '', 
  wait , what ?!, 
  i was n't putting that much attention to the trial since it was christmas and this is manfred * freaking * von karma this lawyer dude is facing off against . 
  by now , edgeworth would already be in jail or something . 
  2016 's ride is not over boys .
