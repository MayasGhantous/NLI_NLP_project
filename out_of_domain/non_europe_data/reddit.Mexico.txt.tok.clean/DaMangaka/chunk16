  then they sired ( i suppose via incest ? ), 
  cain and abel . 
  suddenly cain took ` many wives ', 
  where the - bleep - did these people come from ? 
  were n't they all alone ? 
  did he mass produce them later ? 
  are these new people condemned for something some two idiots did ? 
  plotholes , plotholes everywhere . 
  plot-twist : it 's a tumor . 
  that might explain also the voices in her head . 
  i am disapointed mexico is n't even mentioned, 
  but we can all agree it was n't hard enough, 
  i 'm rather sad at seeing the sarcastic comments here . 
  though i 'm not surprised . 
  in a perfect world , two men can marry and a woman can be a priest . 
  just lovely < 3 . 
  but i like chipotle ) :, 
  it 's the closest i can find in the us for actually-tasting mexican food . 
  it ca n't be that bad ... 
  i was * really * pissed when that whole thing happened , but also i was expecting it . 
  when i saw her i went `` well fuck , are they really that obvious ? '' . 
  now everyone will go see it , soon we 'll hear news throwing a war to iran and everyone cheering . 
  and tbh , i saw the film and it is rather bland : /, 
  i watched the movie . 
  nothing like that came up . 
  and apparently canada does n't exist unless it is utterly necessary to the plot . 
  the horrible plot some games have or the lack of * sense * in a plot which makes the game feel like it has no real plot at all ( when the whole game practically * screams * it has one ) . 
  granted , not all games have plot ( which is ok , some games are just to have fun like tetris ) but if you * are * going to put a plot on the game , for the love of the goddesses at least be sure to put some effort on it . 
  really , please do ... 
  i am immersed in a universe and i want to feel that i am doing something epic , not be let down by a crappy story that ca n't even find logic on itself . 
  and if there is a canon running , please keep up with it . 
  ~ edited to make more sense ~, 
  again , if you * are * going to add a plot to a game , do n't make it crash and burn . 
  best to leave it without one if you ca n't do it : /, 
  fair enough, 
  i want to see django just to watch another tarantino epic classic . 
  how good is it ? 
  b-but . 
  but 's samuel ` motherfucking ' jackson . 
  hating him is pretty much like loving him . 
  i 've seen tetris * fanfiction * . 
  i 'm not kidding . 
  ok then , pac-man or some of the 1980s videogames . 
  i dunno , i like puzzle games : p, 
  ~ ~ also , that game is a digital drug . 
  some do it . 
  some do n't and ca n't understand ... ~ ~, 
  maybe i should have paraphrased my hate : i hate it when they throw a plot in a game and the plot is horribly forced/bad . 
  then i have the same feeling at you which makes me want to kill kitties . 
  portal * does * have some sort of plot but it 's not really shouting `` hey !!!, 
  look gais !!!, 
  i has a plot !!!! '' . 
  it 's more like part of the reasoning of why you are there and the scenario . 
  all you have to know is that you are trapped in who knows where with a sadistic machine that likes to make tests . 
  and it 's fun : d, 
  so , none of you liked life of pi ? 
  that makes me sad : (, 
  i thought it was a masterpiece . 
  had me thinking for a long time . 
  because as we all know , canada does not exist unless the us requires it . 
  draw to my heart 's content and travel the world . 
  i 'm interested in this . 
  upvoting for visibility, 
  i agree . 
  signed , a girl that likes boobs, 
  op will ** definitively ** deliver, 
  you know , i have poked onto various christian threads and places and when it comes to homosexuality they * always * seem to focus on male homosexuality . 
  so , by perceptions of society 2 guys going out is icky but two girls is n't . 
  i mean , i know the reasons why at some point but , at least , they should stop beating the dead horse on this . 
  ~ ~ besides , 40 % of the vatican is gay i 'm sure of it ~ ~, 
  cougar = / = panther . 
  you 're thinking jaguar = / = panther . 
  panthers are just black jaguars, 
  i liked 4 : / . 
  savers killed it for me, 
  if you get the hylian shield , everything becomes easier tbh : p, 
  unfortunately for myself , the game was n't mine so i had to give it back before hero mode . 
  sad : (, 
  according to the developer : `` i was paranoid about game rentals and kids beating the game over the weekend . 
  i. . uh ... made it hard '', 
  i suppose this answers your anguish . 
  everyone in mexico , start buying centenarios !, 
  i honestly thought that if i was good enough , i would n't die and pretty much skip death like the virgin mary did . 
  so , that 's mainly why i aced my sunday school classes . 
  ~ ~ and to rub it onto the other kid 's faces ~ ~, 
  then again , i asked myself , if mary did n't die and went to heaven but jesus did die , why are there popes and not female popes ? 
  and it went down from there . 
  i created my own pseudo religion at 10 due to that question . 
  as long as it 's not other m , i 'm fine with this . 
  a movie based on the prime series would be epic, 
  fusion is the last of the series , so if you want to have fusion , you 'd have to put metroid-super metroid first . 
  well son , i would like to talk you about the kibon portal ... 
  billy jean , huh ? 
  being a mangaka ~ ~ hence the name ~ ~ or just being able to publish my stories in some manner . 
  does n't really have to be drawn . 
  ~ ~ i suck at drawing , i 'll probably die anyways ... ~ ~, 
  i suppose it 's more of a wing-slap but . 
   never forget, 
  ftfy, 
  let me get back from work , i 'll contact you in about 3 hrs .
