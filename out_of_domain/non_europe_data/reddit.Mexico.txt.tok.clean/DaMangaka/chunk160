  i actually have some few extra songs there that are not from muse for the sake of the story behind the playlist , but i hope this helps : ), 
  the endless war , fought by elemental stars and space valkyries , has arrived to earth and is set for a grand finale . 
  time can only tell if a war can end another . 
  so i have this weird idea and dream : i want to travel to europe on 2018 to visit 3 countries for a story i 'm writing and to get a feeling about them : russia , germany and france . 
  i know i can travel through them via train ( i think ) but it 's the plane to get there where it can get tricky as my idea is to go around there for a month . 
  in your opinion , which country would it be best to start off ? 
  also , i 'm by the us-mex border which means that i can get both us and mex flights if the price is better on either side . 
  is there a way to subscribe for both feeds ? 
  so , here 's the sad story about a graphic design engineer who really never got the hang of programming . 
  you could say it 's because i have some sort of reserve for it , like it 's some magical ancient lore that mortals like myself can not understand/use . 
  on top of that , i do n't exactly have that much free time around thanks to my 12 hr job . 
  this has caused me to not even know how to html5 or css properly ( i kind of go guessing around ) even though i want to create websites or modify my tumblr blog to look decent . 
  where or how can i start to learn the necessary tools for proper web design/programming ? 
  for art blog purposes . 
  granted , i do n't use it that much but it 's another outlet people can get to know me . 
  now that it has helped that much ; ; ;, 
  there 's a sports bar in ave revoluci\u00f3n , if i recall correctly . 
  lots of big tvs hanging , good drinks from what i 'm told ( i do n't drink ) . 
  as somebody mentioned , plaza fiesta would definitively be a good choice . 
  if you 're coming around this weekend , we can hook up and i can take you around the best places tj has to offer : d, 
  one thing you may want to think about is what kind of things you want to do in tijuana . 
  there are a lot of things you can go around doing like dining , shopping and general entertainment . 
  your best shot is visiting centro , zona rio which are fairly close to the border . 
  you can get picked up from san diego on uber and let them drop you off in tj . 
  on the way back , you 'd have to cross back to the us before picking up uber if you 're going that way as there is n't still the option for a tj-sd route . 
  if you have any questions , let me know . 
  got mine too !, 
  is it 10 am pst or . . ? 
  it does say local time but i just want to make sure . 
  trying * really hard * to get san francisco starlight tickets . 
  it 's never been this hard before , i find it really annoying : |, 
  i ca n't even add my card on the livenation website outside of the ticket purchase . 
  what 's going on ? 
  so , i could n't get the starlight experience for san fra because livenation was being shitty and was n't accepting my card for some reason . 
  so i 'll have to wait until friday . 
  if anybody wants my pre-sale code , just pm me . 
  i wish i could have been able to buy them : '' (, 
  i was basically refreshing at 10 to get them and when i was submitting my billing info , it would n't take my card and mark error . 
  no idea why it happened . 
  i 'll have to check with my bank tomorrow and try on friday if there are any vip tickets left . 
  nice to hear you got your tix , though . 
  muse is amazing live , specially up on the front . 
  btw , i live in the san diego area . 
  any recommendations for lodging once over there ? 
  it would be my first time and i 've heard the venue is outside the city so i want to plan this carefully if i do get the chance to go . 
  ~ ~ welp , you just made me log in and post in kia after * months * of self-banishment after that small shitstorm i generated by mindless shitposting . 
  actually , turns out that even if the ads * did * appear on said videos , it would be really * really * hard for these guys to obtain revenue out of them . 
  [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utv2vbdw4b4 ) does a really neat round-out of how ad sense works and how actually * bad * it would be for isil to try to use youtube as a way to profit for their `` cause '',

  `` hot dude can change into a sexy leather clad lady ? 
  where do i sign ? '', 
  now that i think of it , haruka tenouh * kind * of falls on the same category . 
  well , fuck me ... 
  i bought a ticket on february to visit my so this august via united because `` they are n't american * imma gon na delay your flight and leave you stranded inside the plane for 3hrs and frown ugly at you when you ask for a cup of water * airlines , so they should n't be that bad , amirite ? '', 
  unfortunately i ca n't refund because ` did n't insure your ticket for +75 usd , blah blah ' but this is now making me rather nervous . 
  ghah , i should have booked delta instead otz, 
  hmm , considering the video i do n't think united can be compared to ~ ~ xolaris ~ ~ volaris which is the * actual * tijuana airlines . 
  despite their horrible english , the service is actually fantastic given how cheap their tickets are . 
  with that said , being tijuanense and having bought a ticket to fly on united for the first time , how fucked am i ? 
  i suppose that as a prosecutor , miles should be * well versed * on how ugly and complicated legally speaking marriages ( and divorces ) can be . 
  also , i do n't think they 've ever mentioned miles having a mother . 
  maybe he got a bit of that experience if she by any chance left them or saw their parents divorce . 
  actually , this could be an interesting setting to explore . 
  i will have to say that while i do sort of support the phoenix/miles ship - and that may add * another * layer of legality as to why marriage ca n't be a thing for him if japan/japanifornia does n't have ssm legal and you know how rigid he can be in abiding the law as best as he can - you can write some sort of story ignoring any sort of romantic situations about miles ' perspective of marriage , both personal and legal . 
  ... shit , i should probably write this idea down somewhere < _ <, 
  while i would totally scream like a little girl if phoenix/miles is a thing , it would disturb me * greatly * if they shove it in the games because let 's be honest : it 's not canon and it wo n't ever happen . 
  phoenix ' is maya 's guy and we all know it . 
  pearls knows it . 
  maybe the only idiot who does n't is phoenix himself but that just makes him adorkable . 
  i really do n't like when people ca n't be flexible between headcanons and actual canons or just share ships . 
  it 's like the fate of the earth depends on whether sasunaru or naruhina is the thing . 
  btw , may i present you my no . 
  2 ship ~ ~ which i totes do think is canon ~ ~ : klavier/apollo . 
  ^ this ^ is ^ kind ^ of ^ why ^ i ^ avoid ^ tumblr, 
  ... but i may need to post some fanart in there to . . gain more fame i guess . 
  i want to launch an original manga but i really do n't have people knowing me at all xd ;,
