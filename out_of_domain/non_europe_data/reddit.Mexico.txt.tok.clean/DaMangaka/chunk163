  main tools of trade digitally are illustrator and clip studio ex . 
  i got some samples on tumblr of both if anybody wants to see . 
  i recently got me a light table and that is * soooooooooo * going to help me with the whole ` ca n't ctlr+z irl ' thing . 
  i 'm really happy but i also get you !, 
  i have sometimes actually done the whole undo hand gesture on some invisible keyboard i 've somehow produced when i make a mistake . 
  digital is n't that hard and you can actually use a lot of techniques learned there on programs like photoshop and clip studio . 
  that being said , although i do have a tablet i ca n't really get the hang of drawing 100 % of something on the computer : the whole `` my hand is down here but i should look at this screen up here '' still sort of flips me out and just makes me not want to do stuff there . 
  i always start with an inked picture which i scan , clean and then do what i need to do digitally . 
  `` to be honest , it 's a tiring job . 
  three hundred and sixty days - three hundred and sixty six every 4 years - twenty four hours and so , yara yara . 
  you know the drill . '', 
  pedro woke up suddenly in the middle of the night . 
  the air was cold and controlled , his surroundings clean and sterile . 
  there was this beep coming from some machine on the right which , after putting two and two together he concluded was a heart monitor . 
  he felt his legs numb and had a hard time moving them even the slightest . 
  as his mind fought to push the veil of unconsciousness away , he could feel something touching the soles of his feet . 
  it would lean back and fort periodically , pushing his feet back . 
  he heard some mumbling afterwards which quickly became a sort of self-dialogue headed towards a rant . 
  pedro blinked : sat at the front of his bed and facing their back at him , was some sort of cloaked figure , holding a large and elaborately decorated scythe . 
  they did n't seem to have noticed his recent awakening , nor the fact that the numbness of his legs were slowly becoming pain as they continue rocking themselves on the edge of the bed . 
  `` who . 
  pedro 's voice croaked . 
  he was n't conscious enough to speak up , but he was glad to see there was some reaction from the hooded figure who turned to face him after flinching at his voice . 
  the figure pulled his hood back revealing a young man with an impossible vantablack hair that fell down to his shoulders . 
  `` h-hey now !, 
  do n't you go scaring people like that !, 
  that is rather rude , i 'll let you know '', 
  because of the situation he was and the probability that pedro was * heavily * drugged . 
  he went ahead and rolled with the first that came to his mind . 
  `` so , '' the student shifted his body upwards in a sitting position as best as he could , giving up half-way through . 
  `` i 'm assuming you 're death ? '', 
  `` what gave you * that * idea ? '', 
  pedro lifted his right arm and pointed at the weapon . 
  the figure followed along , uttering a quiet ` oh ! ', 
  at the end . 
  the figure sighed . 
  `` yeah , i am . 
  i 'm death . 
  a shinigami . 
  angel of death . 
  whatever . 
  i 'm the one who 's going to cross you over to the mysterious void . 
  or at least , that * was * my original plan : you see . 
  you 're just too young , and you threw yourself like that for the sake of somebody . '', 
  death paced along the room , thinking on what to say next . 
  he would occasionally raise his finger as if he had gotten some idea , only to lower it down and shake his head vigorously . 
  `` no , no , no . 
  i mean , i 'm pretty sure those are grounds for a second chance . '', 
  he would mutter loud enough to be heard . 
  `` but my brother . 
  oh , my brother '', 
  death sat back on the bed , this time on the side rather than the bottom . 
  under the cloak that covered his body , there was the sheen of something that looked like an armor . 
  pedro looked at the being puzzled . 
  he pondered just how much oxycontin was rushing on his veins . 
  `` listen kid , i am * not * supposed to do these things but i have this taco fiesta fest i 've been wanting to go since like ... * forever * . 
  i would like to go . 
  i * need * to go , specially since the fest will fall on the 16th and i 'm sure there 's gon na be a whole lot of mexican things thrown about . 
  good tequila , a bag of those churros . 
  yum !, 
  you got ta hand it to them : they sure like to party . '', 
  ' i * really * must be high on my ass ' thought pedro , as he stared at the personification of death with confusion . 
  '' * buuuuuuuut * i got an appraisal the monday after that . 
  i 'm preeeeeeetty sure i 'm going to be hammered as hell . 
  in short : i need you to cover for me . 
  if you do a good job , i 'll bring you back . '', 
  death grinned . 
  it was n't a displeasing grin , but it was still unnerving . 
  `` i 'm sorry , i think i may be a bit too drugged for this but : you want me to work for you during this whole week so you can get to go to some food truck fest ? '', 
  death corrected him , poking pedro 's forehead . 
  `` there 's a difference !, 
  not all tacos are served on trucks ! '', 
  `` how am i even supposed to do that ? 
  if the festival is on the weekend , why . 
  `` because i 'm an official ` taco fest ' volunteer . '', 
  death grinned again . 
  `` i got my shirt , my lanyard and everything . 
  it all came inside this box with magnets on the flap . 
  really nifty ! '', 
  `` uh-huh ... '' pedro replied dryly . 
  `` so , just to understand : i was about to die . '', 
  `` yep . '', 
  `` but you do n't want me to . '', 
  `` yep yep . '', 
  death nodded energetically . 
  `` so , to avoid this fate i have to work for you . 
  `` it 'll just be this week . 
  come on !, 
  it 's quite the bargain !, 
  you even get to swing my scythe and pose for cool photos . '', 
  there was a bout of silence , interrupted only by the rhythm of his heartbeat on the monitor . 
  it was getting faster , just as his consciousness was freed from the veil of numbness . 
  with the bit of strength he had gathered , pedro pushed himself up again , sitting on the bed at last . 
  `` just one week . '', 
  he glanced at death with decisive eyes . 
  `` and i can get my life back . 
  there 's no contracts or anything ? '', 
  `` well , '' death looked to the ceiling , thinking about as he placed his finger over his lips . 
  `` i * do * have to teach you how to wield my scythe . 
  guess we can do a live tutorial tomorrow and see how that goes .
