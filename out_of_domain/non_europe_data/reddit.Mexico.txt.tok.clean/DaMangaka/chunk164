  once we are done with that , you 're good to go . 
  so , what do you say , hmm ? '', 
  pedro glanced down at his lap , hands over it . 
  there were a pair of cables which he guessed were pumping nutrients inside of him . 
  being hit by a truck as close as he was should have been fatal , no doubt . 
  he faced death after a while , tugging at his cloak slightly to bring back his attention . 
  `` i 'm guessing they 'll be selling craft beer over there , right ? '', 
  it 's been a while . 
  i apologize for the rubbishy made wall of text . 
  - * da mangaka *, 
  boring , burning hours before i head home to nap , do some exercise and see if i can draw something before going to sleep . 
  professionally , i 'm not . 
  i will have to say i 'm really good at being an engineer with a somewhat stable job and good planning . 
  thing is , this is * not * what i 'd like to do with life . 
  i want to be an illustrator . 
  unfortunately , i 'm such a perfectionist that i do n't expose my art around nor believe that i can do some earnings from it at this point . 
  so i 'm sort of wrapping around in this weird successful-but-not-really feeling which i can not find a proper conclusion or escape . 
  i 've failed myself , basically , by not following my dream as i told myself i would . 
  i want to be an illustrator . 
  username is highly relevant . 
  `` it has been quite a while since the last time i died . '', 
  tatyana glanced at the blond man with disdain . 
  she pursed her lips and jumped off the bed , moving with a stomping gait towards him and stopping at mere inches . 
  the 12 year old girl 's sight intensified , frustration feeding the initial glance and turning her blue eyes into fire . 
  `` i think the closest i 've been was back on the 30s . '', 
  he continued . 
  his voice was smooth and tranquil , and despite his youthful looks he sounded like he had lived far longer . 
  `` though i would n't have minded doing so in the 60s . '', 
  the pair were not precisely human , each would admit it so , but there were not foreign to the path one of them face . 
  blessing or curse , their lives were bound endlessly to a cause or group of people they had - or at least he wishes to think it was so - sworn to protect . 
  he had seen rise and fall of a lot of trends and periods and behind the glasses he wore , laid a pair of sky blue eyes that would show a hint of his many experiences . 
  however , these recent times were changing far faster than he was capable of keeping up and for the first time in decades - at least more than usual - he felt lost and * scared * . 
  but he could not come to reveal this to anyone , not this little girl or himself . 
  and yet he was there , hiding . 
  the girl 's penetrating stare confirmed her disdain at his feeble attempts of retaining some sense of sanity . 
  `` was the whole november thing an attempt then ? '', 
  she grumbled , crossing her arms , tightening the grip so it would get as close as they could to her chest . 
  `` there are more graceful ways to die . '', 
  shaking her head , she advanced further , making the man flinch and lean onto the wall . 
  he took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes . 
  he sighed . 
  `` i know that . 
  i know . 
  i just ca n't avoid these thoughts . 
  from the first moment i got my place in this world , i 've been doing exactly what people told me to do . 
  even if i did n't agree , i was convinced it was for the greater good . 
  . somehow . '', 
  he glanced at her looking for her approval , but she would just roll her eyes . 
  `` i was very naive and stupid , and i was broken in many ways . 
  there was a point in my life where i really did n't know what i could do , or * how * ... '', 
  `` that does n't seem like it has changed . '', 
  tatyana replied bluntly . 
  `` has it , alfred ? '', 
  alfred sighed , arranging his glasses . 
  `` you 're just like your mother . '', 
  tatyana glanced away . 
  that always got her . 
  he smiled . 
  `` but you 're right : i have n't been able to put my shit in place . 
  and you know what ? 
  i have no fucking clue how to . 
  there are a million of solutions in the air . 
  * millions * and * none * of them are right . 
  none of them make sense or want to make sense at all . 
  there 's this increasing buzzing in my head that is telling me , * screaming * at me to ` go do something ' but who do i reply to ? 
  for the first time in centuries * i * have to go make a choice and i do n't know which one to take . 
  i 'm just ... baffled . '', 
  `` i just ca n't . 
  alfred paused for some five minutes , recollecting his thoughts . 
  at the end , he sighed in defeat . 
  `` i 'm * scared * . 
  the world expects something from me but i do n't want to . 
  i ca n't anymore . 
  not like this . '', 
  the girl sighed as well , though briefly , and placed her hand on one of his knees , petting it . 
  `` it suppose coming down here is a better choice than death . '', 
  tatyana said , looking up to him much calmly . 
  `` hong kong is down 4 streets if you feel like it . '', 
  `` and have your mother find out ? '', 
  he chuckled . 
  `` and here i thought you did n't want me dead . '', 
  `` not before you spend half a billion here , i do n't ! '', 
  the girl growled as the man picked her up and placed her on his lap , ruffling her hair . 
  brief moments like this could definitively make a day . 
  only here at the corner of the world . 
  * yes * , this is sort of fanfic-cy . 
  the hints are already there but shhhhh . 
  btw , if you are curious about these sort of ` stories ' , take a peek at / r/projecthetalia, 
  i do n't update as much due to work , but i 'll do my best . 
  - da mangaka, 
  ahhh , i had just made a story with characters that would work perfectly for this . 
  let me get off from work and i 'll see if i can do something funny . 
  i suppose it is futile to think that the world will get better . 
  because it wo n't . 
  but i will die trying to prove otherwise . 
  that is what humanity is : the self-assertion that despite all odds , we can be better . 
  where are you at ? 
  also , you may want to consider checking / r/randomactsofpizza for that : ), 
  do you happen to have a dominos/papa johns or anything where you can order pizza online around ? 
  let me check if i can hail you a pizza over .
