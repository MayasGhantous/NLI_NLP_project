  i tend to use psychic/water in my regular teams so i will need a bit of help on this . 
  which pokemon you recomend ? 
  i am currently making an all poison type pokemon team and i 've been having a trouble getting some ` basic ' ones since unnova does n't sport them . 
  so currently i am in the look of the following pkmn :, 
  * tentacool, 
  * ghastly, 
  * nidoran ( m ), 
  as an offering , i am able to make eggs of samurott and ( upon obtaining the ditto ) of most starters . 
  if you have black/b2 i can pass on to you the white exclusives . 
  it does n't matter if the pokemon do n't have the proper natures , that 's why the ditto : p. preferably , i 'd life them female . 
  thanks : d, 
  i am looking for a venonat for another addition of my poison team . 
  thanks to you guys , i managed to survive round one and passed !, 
  now i want to give it a kick ass boost with a quiver dancing venomoth . 
  thing is , i have no luck on getting one from the grottos and you can only get one from the dream world if you are using white , not white 2 . 
  if you do n't have one from these places , it does n't matter . 
  heck , i even accept eggs from a venonat . 
  thanks : d, 
  simple . 
  does n't matter if it 's not japanese or is not special . 
  just want that blob to breed other pokes . 
  i have the idea of making a starter egg give away with it . 
  ** new ** : i am looking for a cascoon . 
  i want to chain breed morning sun into a venonat so . 
  yeah . 
  hello there , da mangaka here . 
  hopefully i will build up a reputation as one of reddit 's most loved breeders . 
  to begin this , i am announcing the rules and details of this ** xmas eggstravaganza **, 
  ** here is my friend code btw =  2795-8493-8495 **, 
  ** note a ** - change of rules . 
  this is necessary as my pal pad suddenly filled up and exploded . 
  please specify which pokemon you want when you post . 
  this way i add the users of the give aways of that hour . 
  thank you . 
  ** note b ** - pause and rinse . 
  in order to make sure that the eggs are with who they are supposed to be , i shall restart the egg timer . 
  i 'll begin at 8am with ** more bulbasaurs ** tomorrow . 
  more rules have been added so that everyone can enjoy and get your favorite pokemon better . 
  be sure to tell your friends . 
  thank you for your understanding . 
  ** note c ** - it is getting harder for me to coordinate the eggs due to family stuff and cooking for x-mas and all of that . 
  i do n't want to bother you thinking that i will give out eggs and then not show up . 
  are you ok if i move it to the 30th ? 
  we 'll start at 8pm pst . 
  i also want to have a `` poll '' thread to know what 's up with your eggs . 
  did you get a shiny ? 
  the correct nature ? 
  was your dw pokemon hatched without the ability . 
  this will help me in my feedback as i become ** the greatest breeder of reddit **, 
  ** note d ** - holy shit , i almost thought today was 29 and not 30 ; ; ; but i am here . 
  i shall be adding the fcs of the people who want the pokemon per hour . 
  this means that if you want a specific pokemon and you do n't find yourself in -  [ this list here ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0arkckvtowswedfvxywnpanpgbmzaadg0ew1qrxphcmc ) < - do please tell me . 
  stand by in 15 minutes to start with bulbasaur and then chikorita . 
  ** how does this work ? 
  starting ~ ~ * today *** tomorrow ** ~ ~ ** dec 30 , promise !, 
  ** at 8pm pst , i shall start breeding pokemon . 
  every hour , a specific type of egg will be given . 
  if you want to get the ` egg ' of the hour , just get inside the wi-fi room and you 'll be given eggs . 
  there is a ** limited ** amount of eggs , however , if proven to be successful , i shall make a second round ** jan 6 **, 
  the cycle will go from grass type starters to water . 
  this means that at 8pm i shall start with bulbasaur eggs . 
  then , chikorita , and so forth . 
  upon reaching the last pokemon per element , i will give away pokemon eggs breed with hidden habilities . 
  v the cycle is as follows v, 
  - dec 30th, 
  [ 8 pm ] bulbasaur, 
  [ 10 pm ] treeko, 
  [ 12 am ] snivy, 
  [ 1 am ] dw riolu ** and ** dw elgyem,

  the link will be up as soon as the give away ends , so it might be as early as ** dec 31st *, 
  ** rules **, 
  - you can get up to 3 eggs in this giveaway . 
  however , you ** can not ** get 3 of the same species . 
  if you want to get another species , you ** must ** wait until the hour of that species begins . 
  - when you post , ** you must specify which species you are going for ** . 
  this way it helps me breed the necessary eggs , keeps my pal pad from overflowing and everyone can get a chance for better things . 
  yes . 
  this affects all trades starting from chikorita and onwards . 
  - any pokemon is fine . 
  wo n't judge you if you throw me patrats or rattatas . 
  - the starters have been breed with a ** german ditto ** ( i have a us cartridge ) . 
  if the matsuda method works in your favor , you * may * end up with a ** shiny ** starter : d, 
  - i will fill my box with eggs . 
  that means there will be ** 30 ** eggs of each species . 
  if there 's no more , ** there is no more ** . 
  - if you 'd like to thank me with something , let it be power items as i 'm training teams : p ~ ~ orthatelusiveshinycharmtomakemoarshinies ~ ~, 
  - i will keep track on each fc to see how many pokemon eggs you get . 
  any attempt to get more than 3 , will have your name put in the naughty list . 
  - ** new ** on regards to dw pokemon , there will be 15 of each max .
