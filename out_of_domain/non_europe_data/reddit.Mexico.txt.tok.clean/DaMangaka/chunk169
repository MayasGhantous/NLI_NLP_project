  if i see more requests of one , i 'll dedicate to breed that one instead . 
  ** the official spread sheet of doom **, 
  check in [ here ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0arkckvtowswedfvxywnpanpgbmzaadg0ew1qrxphcmc ) for the list . 
  thanks for reading and ** happy holidays !, 
  first of all , thanks to you guys for helping me out on my choices for my poison team . 
  i could n't have gotten far without your advice . 
  now , i need some for making my bug team . 
  fortunately , i have some experience with them any i have many on my sleeve but i would like your opinion on what can make my team better . 
  ** this team is to be used in a rotation battle **, 
  i suppose it 's important to point that out . 
  my current team is :, 
  * scyzor, 
  * excalivier, 
  so , some help ? 
  i know i should be wary about volcanoras and i could use one myself to baton pass , but , what does / r/pokemon have to say about this ? 
  ps : recommended items would be good too . 
  ** edit ** : this is a bug team vs bug team battle btw . 
  just noting that before going on further . 
  hello , i 'm looking for a shuckle with the ability ** contrary ** , preferably with impish nature , but i 'll take any so long they are female so i can breed it . 
  i think i might be asking too much conditions here . 
  i have tons of eggs from starters , particularly the grass ones . 
  i made them for a give away but personal problems and internet made me impossible to go on with the give away . 
  they are yours to claim . 
  i need a good hearted person that can trade with me to make a scizor . 
  i have starters to give out and eggs from them if you want . 
  it 's a link to the 16th movie in japanese . 
  if you do n't know already it will feature genesect and mewtwo . 
  the thing is that not even serebii is sure if this is the same lovable psychic cat we saw in the 1st movie and in returns . 
  according to [ this info box on the official movie site ] ( http://i.imgur.com/idrgt12.png ) and my sort of understanding of japanese , this is the same one as gyakushuu ( 1st movie ) . 
  the main hint is that it says that he speaks japanese . 
  i 'm not sure of the whole info since my kanji and japanese reading is horrible but , what do you think ? 
  i , for myself , am utterly excited . 
  ~ ~ and if anybody can translate , i 'll love you forever ~ ~, 
  i found out about this subreddit by mere chance and am very interested about it . 
  i wan na start a trade !, 
  a little bit of myself : i like manga and anime ~ ~ oh , really ? 
  i could n't tell with that username you have ~ ~ classical music , playing pokemon and other videogames ( puzzle games are awesome ) , cooking and learning international cuisine , learning as many languages as i can . 
  i also have this thing for rather long complicated stories about many topics from fanfictions to the end of the world caused by a certain somebody 's depression in addition of that person being the god of the world . 
  an advantage i can offer is that due to my position in the country , i can actually ship from usps ( the us ) , so if you 'd rather like me to use this us address and method of shipment , just tell me . 
  hello , i am a translator who specializes in english-spanish or spanish-english . 
  i can translate any document or work you send to me , whether it is a brochure , a script , official documentation , letters , etc. 
  i 'm located in mexico , but i tend to do my work online . 
  we would be communicating via e-mail and documents would be exchanged either via mail or drop-box as needed . 
  if your brochure/document comes in a special format for printing , i am able to work with it without risking integrity . 
  this way you wo n't need to re-make the design again . 
  this works for . ai and adobe related document families , though i can still work regardless of it . 
  if you are interested , please contact me by this e-mail ( damangaka@gunasunito.com or pm me for more information and pricing . 
  thank you . 
  as a gay atheist , this makes me very happy because i will not be able today that all upvotes are on the left and he 'll give us reddit gold to all . 
  fuck yea !, 
  i suppose i need to introduce myself as to why this seems a pleasant surprise to find . 
  i do n't exactly like to give out personal info , so you can call me manga-chan for now ~ ~ orpigeon ~ ~, 
  ever since i can tell or know , i have always felt a bit in between realms able to create or navigate on them . 
  the first contact with what you call tulpa was at the age of 5 . 
  he was a rather strange and jolly bobcat whom i 've had lots of adventures with and explored the world . 
  eventually , as i was age 10 , he told me he had to leave for i had grown enough for my ` chosen ' to come . 
  he then showed his true figure which was more akin to a medieval knight with long silvery hair . 
  he called himself kristal , and had a brother named diamond . 
  my last contact with him was around the age 15 and he told me that he was ` watching my progress ' . 
  on my 11th birthday at night , i received what whom i called my muse . 
  he came to me with a very , * very * angry predisposition as our encounter seemed to have ` captured ' him into this world and he did n't want to . 
  for the first year , it was very tormenting and was quite frankly scared of him . 
  he has special abilities of his own which he liked to use to make my life a bit more difficult . 
  fortunately , i was able to calm him down by poking into his ever growing curiosity of this world and finally after 4 years embraced me fully . 
  he and i are not epic friends , though we have very different views on many things , teach each other and learn more about this world ( which he thinks is full of idiots ) . 
  i could try to bring him here , though he 's very rule-cemented and according to `` the main rules '' , only if i have enough trust of you i could present you to him . 
  that was in order to avoid awkward conversations of having an `` imaginary friend '' and being picked on and what not . 
  i suppose this is a safe space and it could become an exception . 
  if you want more information or just toss him a question , it 's cool . 
  he goes by the name of [ miyamoto ] . 
  he has a full name which he utterly hates though he has accepted it . 
  also , from what i 've read , i seem to have * more * of these tulpas but miya 's the main one and quietly bosses around when it comes to maintain order in `` the house '' . 
  well , that 's pretty much it, 
  it is i , da mangaka . 
  discovering new subreddits faster than a squirrel that 's high . 
  i have always said in my policy that no matter how much i can draw , my art will always be shitty . 
  no , seriously , it 'll be . 
  and that is both good and bad : it is bad because i 'll get depressed at how bad i am at what i want to do for a living , but good because it means i can improve . 
  this is where you come in : i want ~ ~ victims ~ ~ people who are willing to give me tasks to do . 
  while i am ~ ~ supposed to be ~ ~ a mangaka , i do not want to be locked in just one style . 
  i can attempt to do irl or any other artist 's style for practice . 
  i specialize in drawing original characters ( myself having enough to populate a house , maybe ) but i can do outright anything that you ask me . 
  if you have a request for coloring type or stuff like that , tell me too . 
  i can be abused as much as you want and dragged over to make your requests . 
  consider me your personal artist-slave . 
  ~ ~ just feed me properly ~ ~, 
  so , yeah . 
  hope i 'll stick around and you get to like me and watch me grow = w = ;, 
  i would also like some name suggestions , if you are kind enough to do so . 
  confession time , i am a graphic designer . 
  though it was * digital * graphic design , at school we where never really thought the depths of making a web page . 
  at most , it was basic css coding , basic html enough to make a internet explorer compatible webpage ( if you are stuck in 1998 of course ) . 
  i 'm trying to make a webpage myself to really embrace the fullness of what web designing is ( not only making it pretty but start from the code itself ) but i do understand i need some sort of guide to start me with . 
  where can the mindhive of reddit point me to ? 
  that up button on the left can save millions of lives . 
  click it . 
  a long time ago , while in a trip to visit more of my extended family , we got carjacked . 
  we lost almost everything in there , including my original and trusty ds . 
  fortunately , not all was lost since i managed to hide some of my things ( among them my brand new - at the time - dsi ) under the car where the thieves did n't check . 
  thing is , i have this leftover charger .
