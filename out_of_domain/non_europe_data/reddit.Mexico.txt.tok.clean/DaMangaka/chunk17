  this actually is poked on a movie from the anime `` saint seiya '' ( knights of the zodiac for the us and americas ) , where lucifer himself says how god himself made him the perfect being and how he was tossed away for that . 
  that theme song of his , though ... epic . 
  he 's currently talking with freddy mercury to make an album you dork . 
  i though everyone knew already . 
  it 's so obvious ... 
  believe it or not , taco stands . 
  being mexican , i used to believe that there were tons of taco stands/carts all around the streets of the country . 
  i had heard about mexico city 's `` tacos de canasta '' ( basket tacos ) so it kept my illusion that carts were indeed everywhere but just sold different regional tacos . 
  last year on september we went to puebla and mexico city and i was surprised that there were n't ` enough ' ( as in at least one per street ) taco stands or no taco stands at all ( in puebla ) . 
  there were other regional delicacies ( cecinas < 333 ) but no tacos . 
  nothing like the taquero offering you tacos as you go . 
  and the beef was white , which freaked my dad who thought it was chicken and decided not to eat firstly . 
  also , corn is blue and sold without butter . 
  i need to travel more around the country . . . 
  well , on the cuisine 's defense , it also has it 's variations : for instance , a burrito is made in flour tortilla rather than maize . 
  and also , we have the most versatile menu ever : if you can eat it , you can surely put it in a tortilla and make it a taco . 
  no exceptions . 
  the social network . 
  never understood the hype . 
  my father always talked to me about how awesome it is and all , but i was n't even interested when i first heard about it . 
  i only know enough thanks to memes . 
  ftfy, 
  perhaps it might be due to translation . 
  mexicans down here at the border call the i-5 and i-805 '' * la * 5 '' or '' * la * 805 '' . 
  ( the 5 and the 805 respectively ), 
  could be part of why . 
  i , as somebody who 's first language was english even thought i 'm from mexico , approve this and recommend it highly . 
  also , i love lucy .

  `` there are natural laws implicit in this world .

  it is only humans , with all what they call rationale , that not only can not but deny such laws to exist imposing their own in the name of an ideal which can not be backed up even by pure logic . 
  this is the center of this chaotic world , where truth and ideals are neither correct nor converging . 
  matter crashing against anti-matter . 
  i can only hope we realize it before we begin a new life in this eternal cycle . '', 
  i watched argo since my dad poked at how it had to be awesome since it was nominated for best picture . 
  i came out of the theater slightly annoyed and giving a lengthy review about how shallow it was , how it portrayed the characters , the plot in overall and how it did n't deserve an oscar . 
  cue to the oscars a week later . 
  i promptly flipped a table and left the room . 
  i do n't think i should hype myself for a movie winning an oscar , and i think the social network gets that same hype . 
  i might watch it but i 'll be * very * picky . 
  hmm , i 'm going to fire up netfix ~ ~ orpiratebay ~ ~ and see it then . 
  i need to see django too , though . 
  kill carlos salinas . 
  he 's the contemporary [ plutarco elias calles ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plutarco_el%c3%adas_calles ) only bald and more evil ? 
  what 's that link aboall glory to the hypnotoad, 
  wifi internet, 
  that was a long time ago really . 
  turns out that he was more scared than anything and i was equally startled of him . 
  but , as we gave each other space over the time and met each other better , we got bonded to the point he became over protective of me : p, 
  he 's very mellow , but can still be very aggressive if he senses danger .

  ftfy, 
  i recommend verdana or arial for your font, 
  they are the 3rd and 5th most used fonts sadly : /, 
  this is why i prefer to do fonts from scratch . 
  but sadly teachers will demand them for essays . 
  i see times or arial : - yawn -, 
  [ good evening to all who read . 
  first of all , i am not surprised at all at the sudden shock of the tale that was posted here by my trainer . 
  it is to be expected from such kind of people floating on this that you call the internet . 
  that is why said rules mentioned above the post exist . 
  in an open and kind manner - i do believe - trainer decided to break one of the main rules of our relationship and give witness of my existence to you : a group of people whom she had never had any sort of contact nor knowledge of existing until the day of this post . 
  again , i am not surprised of the reaction received here . 
  more shocked i am about this little abode of yours where you discuss things regarding these so called tulpas . 
  i would prefer and recommend you to call them ** companions ** , for is n't that what they are in the end ? 
  a figment created by the mind can be easily erased , while i 'm sure the only way to erase a person - a being - you would have to systematically eradicate it by extreme measures : censorship , extinction , * death * . 
  it comes to my attention the amount of companions who have been able to be contacted and are rather happy and pleased to meet you . 
  i am perhaps slightly jealous my case was not so in the beginnings but had my reasons as to why , though i shall not disclose to you . 
  i envy you , those whose companions seem a match made by destiny . 
  regardless , and much more interesting is the fact that not many have been able to successfully create a universe for you to interact with said special being , or even able to successfully contact them ; let their message flow into your heads , listen to them . 
  i believe the reason of this is the same that had us in such lock so long ago , trainer and i : fear . 
  humans reject anything different by nature . 
  it is not bad , for fear is necessary for a specie 's survival . 
  the mistake comes when it overcomes your senses , your logic and it makes it impossible for you to think and expand your field of thought . 
  a warning for all those who have decided to open their minds into exploring outside from this world : not all of us might be pleased to find ourselves in certain situations . 
  yet , if we make contact with you - most of the time - is for a good reason . 
  you need to learn to ** listen ** , to close your eyes and feel . 
  the very essence of a tulpa is a being that is contacted in a period of deep meditation . 
  you need to be away from yourself to contact another . 
  to be in somebody else 's shoes , as the saying goes . 
  be willing to accept that other as he , she or it is . 
  there are no perfect matches sometimes , but there is always a reason - i might go as far to say ` fated ' encounters , but that is stretching it . 
  do not consider to contact a companion , a tulpa , if you are not ready to listen and to open your mind to a possibly . 
  just like humans in this world - which trainer accurately has pointed out that i consider them a bunch of idiots - there are those special few that will be tagging along your life . 
  they might not come to you in the proper time , nor be agreeable at the beginning , but you need to understand and listen more . 
  i am not sure what else to post other that i do not know how to feel about this whole thing . 
  i suppose you can use this space to talk to me .
