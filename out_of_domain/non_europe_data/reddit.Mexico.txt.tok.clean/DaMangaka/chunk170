  you can use it for your ds or game boy advance sp ( ~ ~ i think micro too ? ~ ~ nope , seems this does n't work fro game boy micro ) . 
  given my location on the border , i am able to ship this either to mexico or to the us easily , though i 'm also willing to ship worldwide . 
  i also have other kinds of chargers for phones and the like . 
  i 'll edit this post to tell you what other trinkets i have that might help you . 
  thanks : d, 
  so , here i am again , doing this . 
  i 'm looking for the following pokemon for a team i 'm building . 
  you 're welcome to provide me some feedback . 
  i need to build a strong team of pokemon that use any of the following moves : ** dig , power gem , rock blast **, 
  this is the team i am testing in pokemon showdown and the one i 'm aiming at :, 
  * cincinno [ jolly | skill link ], 
  * swampert [ adamant | torrent ] < - looking for one with avalanche, 
  so , i have 2 out of 6 pokemon . 
  i do have a swampert but i want a pokemon i can use to breed one with avalanche . 
  any help would be awesome . 
  i have all the starter pokemon and can make you eggs out of them . 
  i am a breeder , so if you need any help , i can provide you with eggs . 
  that 's all = v =, 
  so , now that i have money ~ ~ hurray ~ ~ i have embarked on a quest to buy myself some wireless headphones . 
  here 's the deal , my only experience is [ with these ] ( http://www.plantronics.com/us/product/pulsar590a ) which i lost when i got carjacked . 
  if you can be kind enough to point me on the best direction so i do n't throw money out for good . 
  i 've been interested on [ these headphones ] ( http://www.amazon.com/jaybird-sportsband-stereo-bluetooth-headphone/dp/b003to52a2/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top ) and was about to buy but the reviews made me think about it a bit more . 
  so , help ? 
  hello there true believers . 
  it is i , da mangaka , quite pleased to find about these kind of places . 
  as my username suggests , i am an aspiring artist hoping to make a living out of it . 
  i have the whole `` hungry '' part covered , do n't worry . 
  i 'll be lurking around and see whose wishes to fulfill . 
  hello !, 
  me again !, 
  i 'm looking for these two pokemon for a team i 'm making, 
  since i 'm breeding them , i need both of them to be ** female ** to pass on their hidden ability, 
  i am offering tons of starter pokemon and some other hidden ability pokemon , particularly a vulpix with drought ( female , will breed if necessary ) . 
  thanks . 
  ~ ** edit : ** ~ i forgot to mention , i 'm also looking for a mudkip with avalanche . 
  preferably male but it does n't matter the gender really . 
  thanks again !, 
  til that cispa is literately hitler , amrite ? 
  ** btw , the contest is over . 
  [ congrats to mr_cutestory ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/random_acts_of_amazon/comments/1djvc3/gifted_to_the_winner_of_my_first_contest_a_little/ ) ~ ~ and random.org ? ~ ~ for being the one who answered correctly before time ran out . 
  until next time !, 
  today is may first , a national holiday in many parts of the world to celebrate the worker . 
  as i have posted before , i 've had troubles keeping a stable job due to the shaky economy but it seems that at last i 've found a place to stay . 
  they managed to renew my contract !, 
  so officially i 've broken my 3 month curse ( which made me just keep a job for 3 months at most ) . 
  so , i was thinking in giving back to the community !, 
  this is my first contest and i hope you enjoy it . 
  i 'm currently writing a fanfiction and along with it assembled a soundtrack . 
  not too shabby i suppose , but that 's how ~ ~ obsessed ~ ~ dedicated i am . 
  so `` what does this have to do with the contest , manga-chan ? '' . 
  simple , though you 'll have to use a bit of logic and imagination . 
  it 'll be easier if you are a fan of hetalia , but not a definite factor to win . 
  to simply put it , i need you to align the following songs with the characters/countries you think they go with :, 
  ** songs **, 
  * all by muse unless state otherwise *, 
  [ 1 ] panic station, 
  [ 2 ] sing for absolution, 
  [ 4 ] ruled by secrecy, 
  ** characters **, 
  [ b ] gilbert beilschmidt ( prussia | e.germany ), 
  [ c ] alfred f. jones ( u.s.a ), 
  ** answers **, 
  if you want to know why , just ask : d, 
  ** how to reply **, 
  [ song ] [ number ] : e5 , f6 , g7 , h8, 
  ** what will i take in consideration : **, 
  - who ever comes close ( r ) to the answer . 
  - the time stamp . 
  - why do you think your answers are correct ( not needed but . 
  eh , i wan na see how you can tie characters/nations with the songs and if people think as i do ) . 
  if you guess correctly , you win a ** 10usd ** ( can negotiate up to 15usd ) item from your wishlist . 
  you can link it to me or i will get to pick : p, 
  btw , in case of raffle , put ** happy may day ** in your post . 
  also to see if you 've read the whole thing . 
  contest ends at 9pm pst , so you have plenty of time : d, 
  so , after a long dialogue with myself , i have decided to buy myself a cleaning robot . 
  why not ? 
  after all , much of the household discussion is regards of cleaning the place . 
  now , this is the profile of my house :, 
  - no pets, 
  - barely gets any visitors, 
  - hardwood floor, 
  - it practically is left alone during the whole morning until 5pm . 
  i was thinking on the [ irobot scooba ] ( http://store.irobot.com/product/index.jsp?productid=12546044&cp=2174932&s=a-productage&parentpage=family ) but i want to see if anybody has had an experience and can tell me their recommendations . 
  that . 
  . aside from sweeping and mopping the floor . 
  \u266b when the skies turn gray and the wind 's cold too \u266a, 
  what do you do when you begin to have moments of sadness . 
  specially out of the blue . 
  how do you coupe with them , i wish to know . 
  some music would be awesome too ~ ~ i do need something for my ipod even if it 's dying ~ ~, 
  [ here 's what i got from these lovely people ] ( http://imgur.com/a/imw6r#0 ), 
  i was really exited to say the least and it was my duty to put them to work asap . 
  the sharpener is a blessing ( specially for my few verithin pencils ) and the copic maker was the perfect replacement for my old blender , not to mention that it is now the start of my new journey to catch them all . 
  maybe i should make a wishlist with all the marker colors . 
  for the lulz . 
  thanks you guys !, 
  you rock !, 
  ando sola .
