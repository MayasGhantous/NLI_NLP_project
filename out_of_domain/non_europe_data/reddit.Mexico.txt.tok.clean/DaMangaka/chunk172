  thanks !, 
  it 's so cute and adorable . 
  i promise pictures later . 
  i 've always been a cat person ( even if i technically never had cats myself ) and when i saw it i was fully in love . 
  the kitten must be less than 5 months old and when i was petting it , i noticed how sicklishly thin it was . 
  i managed to take him out of the porch of my house and moved it inside the room of a foreclosed house just two houses away . 
  i want some advice as to what to do . 
  i want to keep it , though i might have to have it 's home be that foreclosed home until some miracle happens and make me move it to my room . 
  so far , i 've fed it kitten food ( the first time i opened a packet of food it literately went onto the bowl before i finished pouring ) and made a bed with a box that had previously packed some tea ( so it smelled nice ) and one of my old shirts as bedding . 
  i am not too trustworthy about cat kennels in my city , given that i do n't think they treat the animals as well : (, 
  i have the money to pay for it 's maintenance but again , they wo n't let me keep it . 
  what to do raoa ? 
  any advice or stories similar to help me ? 
  i ca n't be the only one . 
  i 'm extending it as far as to mexicali even . 
  anybody wonder if we should make a small reunion too ? 
  do something and talk ? 
  watch movies . 
  so , a while ago i won a contest . 
  the gifter sent me a wig cap which i never got . 
  the reason : the address i had for that list was attached to my so 's address . 
  as i know , amazon takes about a week to fulfill most orders and i supposed that this was not the exception . 
  i would have to explain her what was up with that small package/envelope once it arrived but a week later there was no sign . 
  and i asked her , and nothing . 
  today she checked her mail and nothing which raises my question from a while ago . 
  backstory : so and i ordered some book for her school and i was rather excited that i could choose the option to get them on saturday ( she started on monday ) . 
  so we waited and waited . 
  . and it never came . 
  after a lot of hassle , we managed to have it held at the ups offices who told us that sometimes amazon will forget to add the `` apt . 
  no '' addresses . 
  i went to my address book to find it was n't there , so maybe it was my fault too . 
  promptly , i added it . 
  thing is , right now as i check the address book , her address comes [ like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ft9dr0i.jpg ) . 
  i 've tried to put the apt no . 
  on the 2nd line but it comes back in the first . 
  i thought `` well , i suppose that 's how they take it '' but as you can see with this small wig cap , it has n't arrived and it then becomes a trouble for the wishlist that i 've dedicated to her . 
  does anybody have a similar issue ? 
  how to solve this ?

  ** btw , the slots are full !, 
  come back soon-ish **, 
  so , my dear raoa , hai !, 
  how do you do ? 
  you know , it 's been a while since i 've gifted things . 
  sorry for that . 
  i did n't meant to . 
  i am trying to keep my bills in order and i like to generously give things . 
  so that might be a bit difficult to do , you might see . 
  however , i am ** da mangaka ** \u2122 and i therefore can draw . 
  so i want to send * 15 * postcard sized drawings of my many characters and stories i have . 
  * da mangaka * \u2122 will send to the first 15 people , a lovely hand made custom , one piece , possibly actionable ( try not to use e-bay though ) , piece of art !, 
  yes !, 
  you heard right !, 
  a unique art piece from da mangaka . 
  ~ ~ because she 's poor and stuff . 
  you know how much artists do these days ? 
  nothing . 
  you have to sell your soul and ... </rant ~ ~, 
  ** ze catch **, 
  - you have to be among the first 15 to post . 
  also , ** you must be comfortable with sending me your irl address ** . 
  i swear that i will not stalk you ( unless it involves a possible party out of nowhere ) . 
  leave the stalking to the nsa or the interpool . 
  . ~ ~ or landonia ~ ~ . 
  - you ** can not ** tell me what to draw . 
  that 's also part of the surprise : p, 
  - sepomex sucks but it 's up to you to decide whether you want mexican mail or american mail . 
  the bonus with sepomex is that you get a nice cute stamp . 
  ** ze send outs **, 
  i will send these postcards * next week * . 
  why next week ? 
  well , because i need to work on each lovely and individual card . 
  this gives me chance to also put something extra .

  soooooo , maybe you have noticed i have 3ds in my wishlist . 
  the purpose of it is because pokemon x will be released ~ ~ and smash brothers , why not ? ~ ~ and i have been fancying the game system until something good came out . 
  thing is , i 'm a bit torn . 
  i do n't know whether to buy a normal 3ds ( which has purple , my favorite color ) or a 3ds xl ( which has blue . 
  . which i like ) . 
  i know technically the only difference is the screen ( and console ) size but . 
  . tell me : if you had money which would you go for and why ?
