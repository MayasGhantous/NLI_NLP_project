  what do you recommend me to do ? 
  also , is animal crossing really * that * good ? 
  yeah , that 's all . 
  hello !, 
  i 'm looking for a legit usa version of pokemon emerald . 
  it does n't matter if it 's unboxed , i just want the cartridge . 
  i 'd want it asap - it 's for actually a gift - and i have been having bad luck searching it locally . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm desperately looking for this game to give as a gift for my so on her birthday . 
  i 've only so far found ruby and sapphire locally and i 'm kind of afraid of buying online and getting knock-off/pirated game . 
  her birthday is on july 9 , and i 'd like to have it some days before so i can ship it or if you 'd like , you can ship it to her directly . 
  i 'm willing to pay if it 's necessary . 
  thanks . 
  update - managed to get emerald on my own . 
  thanks for those who read and were interested : ), 
  my plan was simple : by producing fedoras in a 3rd world country , not only would i be able to mass produce cheap head gear but i would also be able to enlighten them faster than you can say stop.think.atheism . 
  ask me about my processes and how you can too apply to obtain your share in this enlightening feat . 
  the obvious `` objection ! '', 
  `` hold it ! '', 
  and `` take that ! '', 
  might take place but are not really needed . 
  bonus if a small rp takes place with a prosecutor of your choice , not necessarily from pw-aa, 
  it 's a great day for all the ops in the world !, 
  can be either f\u00fatbol ( soccer ) or american football . 
  this is meant to deal with * all * the topics scotus dealt with , not only doma and prop 8 . 
  i was trying to get to a doctor 's appointment and then suddenly i slipped and bruised my ankle . 
  it 's fine , it 's what they call a grade 1 luxation but i still feel sucky on regards to having to rest my foot in a cast for a * whole month * and have this cast on what it is a very hot weather . 
  have * you * put your foot - or something else - in a place it should n't have been ( this is actually a spanish idiom : `` poner la pata '' : p which is translating as making a mistake ) ? 
  how have you 've dealt with it ? 
  was it funny even ? 
  any ideas how to make this summer more comfortable now that i know i 'll have this thing ? 
  you know which england i 'm talking about , da ? 
  let 's hear him weep . 
  so i checked bulbapedia and i noticed that the 16 movie ost is up for pre-order . 
  i 'm a huge anime ost collector so i went to check . 
  this is the list of the songs that will be included , translated to english . 
  | do you come with ? 
  . home, 
  \u9650\u754c\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226 | challenge to the limit, 
  sos | ( self explanatory ), 
  \u5bfe\u5cd9 | confronting, 
  \u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb | main title ( might be the opening song ), 
  \u30aa\u30eb\u30bf\u30b9\u306e\u54b2\u304f\u6c60 | pond blooming orutasu ( orutasu seem to be flowers ), 
  | chance !, 
  chance !, 
  chance !, 
  ( might be the ending ), 
  so , from the soundtrack , i can deduct that mewtwo will come to make the extremespeed genesect and gang to not be a bunch of pricks while one they try to persue one of their members to be a prick or something . 
  there 's also a thing about returning home ( as shown on the trailers ) since the pokemon hills used to be home to the pokemon in ancient times . 
  then there are hints with the flowers . 
  i only hope there are some call backs when it comes to mewtwo and his / ( her ? ), 
  soundtrack from the first movie . 
  the organ was super awesome but since this is a much more mature and wise one , there might be a choice of a different instrumental characterization . 
  what do you think ? 
  hello raoaers !, 
  i have a quick question for you . 
  for my nintendo exchange , the one i am to gift was asking for a game . 
  no problem , i can get it for him . 
  thing is , he 's in netherlands so i was thinking about trying amazon to send him the game since the 3ds is region locked . 
  however , amazon does not offer a netherlands based site so i suppose i can get it from germany , france or the uk . 
  my question is :, 
  1 ) do i have to sign on them to order ? 
  2 ) can any of them ship to netherlands ? 
  if so , which of the 3 options is better ? 
  3 ) does any of you have an account on either of the sites ? 
  maybe you can purchase it for me ( in the case you have/there is a program like prime in the us . 
  of course , i 'll send the money . 
  many questions indeed . 
  what should i do ? 
  what days are you going ? 
  i 'm super excited . 
  i 'll go on friday afternoon and see if i can get a ticket for saturday . 
  then i 'll go on sunday since i * do * have a ticket for that day . 
  i wondered if any raoaer will go . 
  maybe we can do things together : d, 
  my sister and i are very hyped for a concert at the holywood bowl . 
  this particular concert is one for 30 seconds to mars and it was a present from me to my sis for her birthday this july . 
  the thing is , that we noticed most hotels in the area are * very * expensive and all we are going to do is flop in the bed after the event is over . 
  a little bit of background : we are from tijuana and basically what we are looking for is a nice , cheap and safe place to stay to sleep . 
  any recommendations/help you can give us ?
