  thank you for being patient | | | otz, 
  forgive me for not being able to provide any sorts of updates in almost 2 months . 
  however , we have vastly worked with making the city better . 
  it turns out that there were more people than i expected and these survivors had to help me evacuate the more than 780,000 corpses . 
  mexico city used to be one of the most populated cities in the world . 
  now i 'm not sure . 
  the following was a sequence of events that occurred since my arrival at the capital . 
  * arrival, 
  * check in at the chapultepec castle, 
  * meet/find survivors . 
  * organize rescue squads for any other unknown redditor and/or their pets ( mainly cats ) . 
  * clean up squads for all the deceased . 
  we decided that the best way to deal with them was to burn them in a large pile . 
  * counting resources and assigning jobs : field jobs were the most important , following with energy and internet supply . 
  * we ceremoniously burned the senate 's desks as a sign of our anger towards our previous government . 
  at san lazaro , i took an oath as the new ruler of the country . 
  * staff of government and other important groups move to live at * los pinos *, 
  * we are starting to work with our surviving engineers on replacing the old telmex lines with fiber optics . 
  we are * very * interested in purchasing materials for both wired and wireless communication technologies , though we are creating them with scraps found at electronic shops . 
  if you are interested in participating , please contact us at innovacion@gobernacion.com.mx, 
  * schools are suspended until we can find a better solution for the educational system we used to have . 
  also , until we have more flux of children . 
  that is all for now . 
  if you have any questions , please let me know . 
  i would like to also know if any of my protectorates are alive and well . 
  we would like to support you in any way possible . 
  fortunately , we do have an active pilot so we can send you supplies . 
  - hrh da mangaka i, 
  i 'm not ranting , just perplexed . 
  this happened 2 months ago and the mods were n't that clear with me . 
  i thought it was ` for teh lulz ' since one of my posts got to the top of the subreddit . 
  however , the ban has n't been lifted . 
  what can i do to get back there ? 
  i expect great answers from you . 
  also , a theme song to go with your ideas . 
  and , go !, 
  also known as kakashi , from littlekuriboh 's spoof of naruto the abridged series . 
  and , go . 
  ~ ~ bonus points if you sing ~ ~, 
  sorry for the horribly long wait . 
  i did n't mean for it to lag that much but at least , finally , the package has been sent . 
  you should receive it on wednesday at most . 
  and now , to start delivering the postcards at last . 
  i promise not to make these things as often = v = ; ; ;, 
  let me tell you something that i am kind of proud of : i like to plan ahead . 
  sometimes people might be surprised at how things end up being the way i wanted - and i even get surprised myself - but it is only because i 've carefully planned on any possibility . 
  good and bad . 
  kind of having plan a to z if you might say so . 
  however , despite of all the plans , i can end up in situations that i never even expected or thought about ( an az situation ? 
  maybe a xyz ? 
  something else really ) which makes me enter in panic because i can not counter them . 
  i get trapped in a turmoil of thoughts and despair because i was stupid enough * not * to think on that possibility and thus not have anything for said situation . 
  now that such explanation is out , allow me to explain the title . 
  ever since i was little , i had planned my life . 
  kind of . 
  i had decided where to study , what to have and skills to achieve . 
  i managed to graduate from the university i wanted and without debt , i consider myself smart and blah blah blah . 
  my parents support me - even though i can find them a bit annoying and conservative . 
  only sometimes - and i have friends who also support me . 
  thing is , right now i am at a stage where things seem to go not as planned . 
  i could n't get a job just after graduating and it took me 2 years to get the one i have . 
  my average pay is roughly 120 usd a week as an intern ( before you start with your pitchforks , i do n't live in the us or any of the so called ' 1st world nations ' ) which is less than what i might need to move out from my parents home ( which i had planned to do so by the age of 25 . . which would come around in november ) . 
  i have planned to create a business with the money i 'd be saving with my job but with groceries and other things i could buy , it 's not really worth saving or anything that i could save would not be enough . 
  i 'm also a . 
  well , just look at my username . 
  i 'm supposed to be drawing but i am not exactly the best artist . 
  i pretty much consider my art half assed shit . 
  my writing is n't better given the esl status . 
  all what i wanted at this point of my life : a good job , a nice place to live , being able to have time to draw/write and be myself ca n't be so because . . well , i do n't know . 
  i know i should be grateful to be living with my parents at a nice home and have a nice place to stay . 
  i know i should be grateful i earn enough money to spend and hang out with people , eat and buy the food i like . 
  i know i should be happy that i 'm doing something in my life . 
  thing is , i 'm at a point of despair : i do n't think i will accomplish any of my goals . 
  all that preparation from back then - the school , the classes , the extra books i read , the skills i learned , etc - are worthless and useless . 
  i feel worthless , pretty much . 
  i ca n't even earn what a regular engineer in this city earns . 
  i 'm stuck . 
  i wish i could do more and slowly i am starting to feel that ` adult decay ' i feared since i was little . 
  that decay were they realize their dreams or goals ca n't be true and you are better off accepting your fate and shut the fuck up . 
  `` this is reality . 
  reality is shit . 
  stop whining and take it like a man . 
  fuck off already . 
  nothing you did could prepare you for this shit . '', 
  somebody mentioned already that i should move out of my area of comfort but , since i 'm too scared to do anything due to my unpreparedness and phobia of failing i do n't know what to do .
