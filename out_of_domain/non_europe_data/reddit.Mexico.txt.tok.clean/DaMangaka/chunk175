  ** `` having two fathers was the unforgivable mistake for a girl in nuevo leon '' **, 
  * a school in monterrey , the hills institute , not only expelled a minor for being raised by a homosexual family , but her stay was conditioned so her biological father would present himself as single and offered a public apology . 
  photo : daniela mendoza luna, 
  * the principal conditioned them to not be presented as a couple to the school community . 
  alejandra had only three weeks of having started school when she was expelled from the hills institute school . 
  the unforgivable mistake to the board of directors of the school was to have two fathers instead of a mother and a father . 
  alex and pepe have lived in monterrey for 8 months , having moved from nuevo laredo , they settled in the cumbres neighborhood and started to look for a secular educative institute for their two year old child . 
  when they saw the mission / vision of this educational institution included respect for diversity , they believed to have found the right place . 
  before the school year began , she was registered and one week later at the open house the three of them presented themselves at the campus as a homosexual family and met teachers , parents and other personnel without any problems . 
  but the third day of school had not ended when alex was called by the principal of the school , patricia dur\u00e1n , to tell him that their family situation would not allow the girl to remain in school . 
  affirming that the owners were homophobic , she offered the parent the chance to continue being part of the institution so long he compromised in signing a letter - which milenio monterrey has a copy - in which they renounced to present themselves as a family . 
  among the conditions was to assist to the school events individually , abstain of doing any out of place commentary to any other parents about their situation , not going to the festivities of may 10 ( mother 's day in mexico ) , absolute discretion and compromising to the nonattendance of his husband to the institution . 
  it even asked them for a public apology . 
  `` pepe had to be completely absent of our daughter 's school life and basically she wanted me to go as a single parent which i 'm not '' , alex recalls . 
  alex did not sign the letter and the principal pointed out that based on this she could n't guarantee the permanence of the girl at the school , but she would give him a `` final verdict '' on the following days . 
  the couple sought out the help of state and federal authorities , they immediately contacted the national commission to prevent discrimination ( conapred in spanish ) , which began to work on the case and spoke with the directives at the school . 
  `` the conapred intervened imminently , even the sep ( public education secretariat ) received us to see if we could reconcile before the next appointment with the school , '' pepe tells , who , not being alejandra 's foster parent , had to stay out of the negotiations with the school . 
  they also found an echo with the nuevo leon educative authorities , who through the secretariat for childhood education would enter into a dialogue . 
  three weeks passed before alex was cited again to the institute with the warning that the ones who should attend would have to be the girl 's `` father and mother '' . 
  as they went to the accorded hour , the doors of the institution were closed ; an employee accompanied by a security guard informed them that there would n't be a meeting , the girl was expelled and they could n't come in . 
  despite their request to speak with the principal the access was denied , so they demanded return of the didactic material that they had brought for their daughter 's education as well as a refund for the tuition . 
  `` they saw us through the crystal ( window ) and locked the door , the receptionist went to the back of the office and they had us there standing for 10 minutes and they send us a security guard with an employee to tell us that the girl has been officially expelled . '', 
  he recalls . 
  they gave them a check with only 70 % of the expenses incurred and in days after the event the institution modified their mission/vision in the institution 's website , and with a simple stroke they erased everything referring to respect for diversity . 
  as they made their case public to other families , the couple received great support and noticed how they were unfamiliar with the case . 
  the situation is currently being settled at the ministry of education , the federal office of consumer protection and the commission for the prevention of discrimination, 
  alejandra is at home with a nanny while their parents work and continue looking for an educative space that really considers tolerance and respect for diversity as one of their principals and does n't use it as a publicity stunt . 
  [ [ official information regarding the mexican empire ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/virussurvivors/comments/1ee543/introducing_to_you_the_3rd_mexican_empire/ ) ], 
  i wish to present myself formally . 
  i am hrh da mangaka i , empress of the 3rd mexican empire . 
  ever since the reddit virus struck , i noticed how this could be the opportunity to rebuild my ailing nation and convert it into a busting world power . 
  we are still far from our goal - despite our incredible territorial expansion - and while some other mexican and former united states citizens have struggled to keep up , we are at last finding a common thread to follow . 
  we are proud to be the keepers of the technological mecha which is silicon valley , supplied by the warmth and passion of mexicali ( currently at 50\u00ba c ) which has helped us keep a certain level of advantage . 
  there is still much to do an suggestions are always welcome . 
  i would like if your questions were more regarding the nation , but i welcome the ones regarding to myself . 
  thanks . 
  - hrh da mangaka i,

  am i doing this alrite ? 
  i usually lurk here , post on comments and have posted some drawings . 
  the usual . 
  however , this post is different and i need your help . 
  i 'm not sure how this will work out or end up but i 'm kind of desperate . 
  on october , i had bought my so some pokemon games so she could play them while pokemon y came out . 
  due to financial reasons , she had to sell the 3ds she owned and thus ended up having only the cartridges ( and eventually the pokemon y cartridge that she had pre-ordered and bought ) . 
  today she has sent me a message that her mother had sold ** all ** her games out of the blue : the gifted pokemon black , black 2 , emerald and unopened y version . 
  she 's super frustrated and what 's even more worrying is that it was on the day i was meant to sent her a brand new 3ds xl ( the red pokemon one ) . 
  her games were practically stolen and sold ( same with the 360 she bought with her own money ) . 
  i 'm reaching to the pokemon comunity in tx to help me localize these games . 
  she lives in san antonio and i 'm not sure where her mom would have sold them ( maybe a pawn shop ) . 
  unfortunately i live in mexico ( bc if you need the state ) and i ca n't be there to help her . 
  i ** will ** provide monetary reward for anybody who can find these games and return them to their owner . 
  i have no info about what the emerald version has ( i do n't have a phat ds or a sp and she had a ds lite ) but both black and black 2 are just started with the name ` kotone ' on them . 
  another particularity is that it holds the 3 shiny sinnoh pokemon given away on the gamestops during sept-oct within the mistery gifts . 
  i also do n't have any other details of the y version other than it was brand new and unopened . 
  thanks for listening . 
  edit : i can provide you info of where she lives in order to make some sort of roundup and search there . 
  i do n't think they could have been sold too far away from there . 
  edit2 : crossposted this to / r/sanantonio, 
  edit3 : due to safety reasons , i wo n't give the exact location of her home but [ this is the neighborhood she lives in ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/qxznx ) . 
  this should help you narrow down the places where it could have been sold . 
  thank you so much for your support / r/pokemon . 
  i 'm really happy to see such a strong and supportive community . 
  so i got my wallet , i got into a mining pool and i downloaded cgminer 3.9.0 to help in the race for the moon ( tm ) . 
  however , i want to see if i 'm doing the correct thing and i am not just running around in circles . 
  first off , this is the current script i have ( with personal data taken off ) :,
