  ** translating services **, 
  i can translate to you any document in english to spanish . 
  you can choose whether you 'd like a ` standard ' spanish or mexican spanish . 
  i could work with other regions ( argentinian spanish for example ) , but it might take some time . 
  i can translate documents , give you phrases or make a full translation of a design/leaflet you have to spanish . 
  you can inquire for some samples if you wish . 
  pm for rates and offerings . 
  that is all for now . 
  hello fellow shibes , it is me again . 
  on my last ( and first ) post , i asked how to mine . 
  right now , my laptop was left mining while i 'm here stuck at work . 
  maybe i wo n't earn much but i 'm just happy to be on board and heading to the moon with my fellow companions . 
  right now , though , i 'm building a website . 
  a webcomic to be more specific . 
  i do n't want to have ads in it or any of that sort , so i 'll be relying on donations from many sources . 
  i want to make dogecoin the first option . 
  i suppose i should set up a qr code or something on the front page or donation page but , how do i make it work up ? 
  also , for the future at least , i wish to open a e-shop and have it accept doge as well . 
  how would dogecoin transactions work . 
  any help or comments will be greatly appreciated . 
  my so is in a very difficult situation right now and needs all the help she can get . 
  for starters , she has been desperately looking for a job ever since she was snipped out her last employment and her family is n't really that supportive . 
  her mother - whom she 's living with atm - has not only demanded payment for rent even after loosing her job ( which she has been paying with the savings she kept for getting to a decent college ) but has [ stolen items my so bought for herself ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1t9qio/attention_r_pokemon_this_is_sort_of_an_emergency/ ) , sold them and just kept on mismanaging her assets . 
  her mother has also put a deadline to get a job before she kicks her out of the house ( on march ) which would leave her effectively homeless . 
  due to said troubled relationship and knowing the sort of abuses she has to endure , she is also looking for places to move to . 
  of course , given the lack of funds and bad luck at getting employment that seems almost impossible . 
  i am unable to receive her at my home given that we live basically in two different countries ( i 'm in mexico , shes in the us ) and my family is kind of conservative ( in case you wonder , i 'm a chick as well . ), 
  so , here is my request : i 'm not asking for donations at all - then again she really does n't like the idea of being aided too much though she knows this situation has gone way out of hand . 
  i 'm just wondering if reddit can give me some support so she can find a way out of that damned scenario and live her life free of that sort of burden . 
  job offers or shelters . 
  anything of help will be appreciated . 
  she lives in san antonio , by the way . 
  please let me know if you need any more details . 
  thank you for listening . 
  ~ ~ wtf damangaka , stop posting questions ~ ~, 
  hello fellow shibe . 
  it is me again !, 
  i am here with my weekly doze of questions , learning more about this community and mining my coins in my laptop . 
  . at 7kh/s, 
  ~ ~ i am still trying at least ... ~ ~, 
  anyways , i had another question : i have an event coming up soon where i 'll set a booth selling art and stuff . 
  i do n't expect to sell stuff using doge but i do want to introduce people into this fabulous community and get them started with some of their own coins . 
  thing is , not everyone has 4g/3g/internet on their phones or might not be able to connect as quickly enough to redeem their tip , thus an offline tipping method would be best . 
  once they arrive to their home , they could check in here and download the wallet to deposit their coins . 
  ** still ** , the question still stands : how can i tip offline ? 
  how do you suggest i should introduce people to doge ? 
  an alternative coin would do * really good * to this city tbh and it only needs more people knowing what to do . 
  also , is there a way other fellow shibe can tip offline as well ? 
  cheers : d, 
  please let me know if you added me so i can add you back . 
  i 'm a breeder so a ditto will be perfect too !, 
  thanks and happy safari catching !, 
  let 's make a party so big , it leaks to the other side of the border . 
  i know there is a so.ca post down there but i also want to include my mexican shibes . 
  mind you , i was n't laid off due to mining . 
  it all started as a small experiment on how fast my mining could be if i used 3 computers that were just there without use . 
  despite i managed to achieve the outstanding speed of 70kh/s , i got at least 2k coins . 
  now , i wish to share them with you all . 
  because nothing raises my spirit more than to share my happiness . 
  now , who ever wants doge say * i * !, 
  hello there fellow shibes . 
  i hate to make these kind of posts but , it 's necessary for the moment . 
  you see , i 'm in the tight ropes right now : 2 fridays ago , i was laid off my job and i have had quite some hard time finding something new . 
  on top of that , i have some classes i need to pay , services to pay and such seem to crush my dream to finally start my journey as a comic artist . 
  i was meant to go to a convention at the end of march but given that i barely have any money to pay anything , i am not sure this will happen either : (,
