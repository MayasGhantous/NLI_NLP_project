  i wanted to start a small side business to sustain myself but that too has been shelved . 
  in tl ; dr , i need a lot of money ( at least 1000 usd ) to attempt to do anything listed . 
  here 's where i now offer my services as i hate begging :, 
  i do consider myself an ace on many things so you can hire me to do stuff . 
  you can check my [ tumblr ] ( http://gslucky.tumblr.com ) or [ deviantart ] ( http://gslucky.deviantart.com ) for some examples of my art , my ~ ~ kind of old ~ ~ [fanfiction.net ] ( http://www.fanfiction.net/~damangaka ) account for some writing or you can just ask me some more recent samples of things i can do . 
  i also offer semi-professional translations english-spanish and viceversa for any need . 
  just let me know . 
  thank you and good day : ), 
  ps : if you are a kind soul and want to sponsor my launch as a mangaka this march with a huge tip , pm me so i can send you my doge address . 
  all sponsors will be placed on a huge 2mt by 2mt mat which will be used as the background of my booth . 
  this is the dogecoin version of a gig i have in [ fiverr ] ( http://www.fiverr.com/damangaka/draw-you-a-cute-portrait-in-my-style ) . 
  basically for 10k \u0110 i 'll draw you a cute chibi of what ever you want .

  hello m fellow shibes . 
  it 's been a while since i last posted here . 
  i noticed moolah 's update to v2 and i have to say to you guys : nice interface there . 
  it 's smooth , it 's professional , it 's overall nice . 
  now , i want to construct a donation page like [ this ] ( https://moolah.io/donate/4775/dogecoin ) for my own website . 
  from my understanding , you need to register yourself on merchant services but even though i input all my data and click ` enable account ' it just does n't do anything . 
  the website does n't even move to another one . 
  just an empty click . 
  i wanted to know if that has happened to anybody else and what can try instead . 
  is it my browser or something else ? 
  thanks : ), 
  pretty much a copy/paste from my original post in / r/dogecoin :,

  at nobody 's request , i am making an ama to answer all your questions regarding us pigeons !, 
  also , you can join me to expand rights to our feathered kindred so we can do simple things like driving buses and drawing . 
  here 's my proof : https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/pigeon-and-computer.jpg?w=940, 
  i 'll be in and out this thread as i have to poke around places and coo . 
  ** laptop questionnaire **, 
  * country of purchase : united states, 
  * purpose ( netbook , ultraportable , mainstream , gaming , desktop replacement , etc. 
  ) : basically anything that allows me to use photoshop and illustrator at the same time . 
  being able to play some steam games and lol is a plus . 
  * screen size preference : 15 '' - 17 '', 
  * os preference ( windows/mac/linux ) : windows ~ ~ suddenly the universe collapsed on it 's own ~ ~, 
  * gaming requirements ( example games and desired fps/settings ) : i can go along with emulators and old school games ( ca n't miss my populous - the begining ) , but it would be really cool if i could play lol or some ` basic ' steam games like tf2 . 
  * other performance requirements ( video editing , cad , etc. 
  ) : ** photoshop and illustrator ** . 
  i work as a pixel artist and do both vector and pixel sprites for some customers on fiverr . 
  i also am planning to start my own comic . 
  i have a wacom tablet i 've been using on my desktop so on that regard i 'm all set . 
  i plan to use manga studio for some sketches but mainly a illustrator/photoshop combo for the rest . 
  * brand preferences and reasons ( already owned accessories , familiarity , business compatibility ) : most of my prior laptops have been 2nd handed so i kind of know which ones can last more than others . 
  toshiba has been so far the best brand of computer i 've had and i 'm inclined to one of those satellite . 
  if you can recomend me something that might be better , i 'm open ears . 
  * any particular style that you like ( examples are great ) : as long as i can run photoshop/illustrator , i 'll be fine . 
  it 'd be cool if it has a touchscreen though : p, 
  ** which of the following qualities would you prefer ? 
  ( choose one , two , or balanced ) **, 
  * long battery life - vs - low weight - vs - high performance : high performance , given that this laptop wo n't leave my room at all . 
  * build quality - vs - low price - vs - high performance : balanced . 
  i like them to be good working but also good lasting . 
  i am prone to accidents , what can i say : /, 
  * low noise/heat - vs - high performance : i 'm poor ... 
  so balanced . 
  ** which features would you pay a premium for ? 
  * high resolution screen : with the ` regular ' 1080p i 'm settled, 
  * a great keyboard : - shrugs -, 
  * a great touchpad/mouse buttons : i usually buy a side mouse, 
  * great audio : i 'd like it , but not a high priority, 
  ** list any features that are critical : **, 
  basically i 'm calling this laptop ` starter ' since i want to ` start ' my freelance job with a good laptop that is affordable to what i have . 
  i know i wo n't get all ( and i was shooting for the 1,999 surface pro 3 ) but we all start with something and i want to do it as nicely as possible . 
  i ** will ** state that i ** do ** need it to be able to run the adobe programs good enough to have two running together . 
  i * might * do some video editing but that 's what the ` mainframe computer ' is for . 
  as a site comment , i actually live in mexico but i can freely cross the us border to buy stuff . 
  consider that the usd - mxp rate is 1usd - 15 mxp with no positive signs of becoming better : ( , so i might lower my range a bit more if things go south in our economy . 
  such is the life of one by the border . 
  well , hello there . 
  time for me to stop lurking . 
  i was poking around and noticed some interest on having something for san diego comic-con . 
  days have gone by and since nobody has raised their hands , i thought of doing it myself . 
  as it is * impossible * to get both tickets or a booth or something , i was thinking more of a get-along/reunion for all ggers in the ca/bc area to talk about things , meet and what not . 
  we * could * make something a bit more organized like an outdoor panel but that might need a bit more of planning .
