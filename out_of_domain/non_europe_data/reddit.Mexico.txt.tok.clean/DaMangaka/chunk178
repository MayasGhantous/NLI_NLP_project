  it 's up to you . 
  more than anything , i 'm opening the chance to get all together with me as your host . 
  my plan is to make this on friday the 10th in the evening , right after most have gotten out of work and there 's little to see in exhibit hall ( 6pm ) . 
  maybe at that park in front of the con or somewhere more tidy . 
  so , let me know what you think and if you 're up to it . 
  it 's here !, 
  comic-con week is here !, 
  to celebrate , [ let 's have a meetup !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/3b4u3n/meetups_did_you_know_sdcc_is_in_less_than_2_weeks/ ), 
  the idea is to gather on july 10th at 6pm ( once you 've fetched enough goodies from the con and all ) at [ children 's park ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/gdvno ) just in front of the convention center . 
  after 30 mins , we 'd start our crawl officially . 
  i have n't specifically put a bar or eatery specifically since downtown magically transforms into something else that week and we ought to find rather interesting things but if somebody has a suggestion , you 're all welcome to do so . 
  i sadly do n't have an official banner as my main computer died due to a stupid virus , so i owe you that . 
  if this event is a success , and if there 's enough people , join me on september 13 for the sequel : #ggintj , now with more tacos and chelas . 
  see ya there guys !, 
  i will admit , it * was * very unorganized , last minute and all you want to say but it was ** awesome ** !!, 
  it was 5 guys and i ( hah !, 
  take * that * zoey ! ), 
  and we embrased our obvious missoginy by going to the place were women could be more objectified : hooters !, 
  i 'll upload some pics just as soon as i get my main computer up and running . 
  i know one of the attendees took a ton of pics ( that even got noticed by key ggers ) so go ahead and dump them here . 
  i might do a sequel in san diego on september 13 , i 'll confirm you next month . 
  overall , thanks to you all for coming : d, 
  i remember hearing a lot that ` the globalist ' was meant to be citizen erased 's sequel . 
  on regards to the theme of it , it could be so but hear me out : it could well be another song before that . 
  i 'm talking about the handler . 
  to enjoy my muse experience , i usually handle playlists to go along a story i 'm currently writing so i can visualize it and keep the idea . 
  that 's when i noticed the motifs of ce and the handler seem quite the same . 
  even the emotions weaved into it . 
  ce talks about a guy who got vanished while the other song is how he got transformed into practically a slave . 
  a drone . 
  ce ends with micro cuts but the handler practically squishes both themes of being nothing and wanting to get away from it , a sort of revenge for being manipulated . 
  so , what do you think about this ? 
  hello there !, 
  it 's been a while . 
  long story short , my main computer and laptop died and thus my miners/wallets and it took a bit to get an actual workable computer at last . 
  do n't worry about my lost coins though : if i recall , i had no more than 1k which i 'm sure i can re-mine or can recover via e-commerce which i plan to start next year . 
  the thing is , a lot has changed !, 
  the coin that started as a joke surely climbed to become one of the staple cripto-coins people refer and prefer !, 
  a lot of fountains and miners have gone up and down and basically what i want to know is where to re-start my journey to reach the moon with you guys . 
  i 'll download the wallet , and get one of my backups on it but for the while , what resources should i know to keep me up to date on recent events ? 
  thanks : ), 
  as far as i know , i 'm not sure the admins have provided the tools yet . 
  the timer is still on the right ticking and it 's going to be the 30th pretty much soon . 
  so , what can we expect tomorrow if nothing happens and no tools are provided ? 
  what if they * do * give you the tools but are n't that good ? 
  and what if indeed admins deliver ? 
  just curious . 
  ask redditors - what will * you * do tomorrow considering tomorrow 's deadline ? 
  i noticed you have a sub per cities but i could n't find one for this particular place , so this place will have to do . 
  as the title says , i 'm planning on going to stratford either on september or october to visit my so . 
  although the trip is 7-8 months away , i 'm already on the whole ticket buying/hotel hunting scheme and i want to know your opinions/tips/ontario hacks to best enjoy the city . 
  i 'm super interested in the festival but i 'd like to know good places to eat/sleep/roll . 
  i plan to go a whole week , probably from sept 16 to sep 25 or oct 8 to 16 . 
  right now , i 'm a bit invested in finding a good place to stay for the nights i 'm going . 
  my ideal would be a b&b close to downtown but i 'm willing to check other spots if cheaper . 
  thanks !, 
  [ epic banner goes here ], 
  greetings all !, 
  it is i , da mangaka , posting a 2nd post here of my own on the topic of yet another meet up at a date that could n't be more perfect than any other : the san diego comic-con 2k16 . 
  [ last year ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/3b4u3n/meetups_did_you_know_sdcc_is_in_less_than_2_weeks/ ) i jumped in and tried to pull out something in a short time and ... what do you know ? 
  we did kind of succeed !, 
  we even had a sexy babe tweeting us back with supportive messages and had a blast while at it . 
  our group was perhaps very small , but all good project start small . 
  now , armed with 4g that allows me to roam in both the us and canada ( that was a * very * big issue when i tried to check if any other people would come in . 
  stupid telcel ... ) and with a ** lot ** of time before the comic-con craze begins , i think i 'm willing to say that i want to create the best meet-up possible . 
  bi-nacional if even possible !, 
  so , here 's the gig ( which may change depending situations ), 
  * ** meet-up location **, 
  to reminisce the first gg@sdcc, the meet-up place will be at one of the small hills at children 's park, 
  [ [ the map ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/msa2nybep3o ) ], 
  [ [ the hill ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/xueyuu2puny ) ], 
  while i 'd like to recreate last year 's meet-up , i 've been informed that on friday night , it 's a tradition to run a really good animated dc movie . 
  i would n't want to spoil any attendee 's fun so what i 'm going to do is to leave a survey down here to see whether you 'd like thursday or friday . 
  likewise , the original reunion time was at 6 but it can be later/earlier depending the day . 
  that also will be included in the survey . 
  [ ** [ click here for the survey ] ( http://goo.gl/forms/dlfxtyp5ht ) ** ], 
  * ** grace period **, 
  be sure to record date and time correctly once we 've selected it ! . 
  considering , however , that 's comic-con and some possible attendees might be joining us , i 'm going to be giving a grace period of an hour after the chosen time . 
  you are welcome to join us once we move out to another place but you 'd have to pm me via reddit or twitter . 
  btw , my twitter is @damangaka . 
  thanks to the crossborder 4g , i 'll be finally able to answer you shortly . 
  * ** food and ` landing site ' **, 
  the survey does cover that but i 'd like to discuss it here too . 
  if you know sd or would like to give suggestions , just post them down here . 
  * ** other **, 
  i 'll be working on some paraphernalia for this meetup ( official poster , some goodies to give , etc ) . 
  if you want to help up , hit me with a private message and we can sort something out . 
  that 's all for today !, 
  see you in july : d, 
  * this also works as a test post *,
