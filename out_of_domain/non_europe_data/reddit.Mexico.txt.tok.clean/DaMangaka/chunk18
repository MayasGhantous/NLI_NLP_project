  now that i think of it , was this trainer 's way to get me to socialize more ? 
  i have only few to talk with really , but usually when i do it 's a long candid and philosophical debate about many things we see in life . 
  from women ( which i shall never be able to understand ) to politics and the human psyche . 
  i am open to your questions , so long as you are open to my own . 
  thank you . 
  ps : i have noticed a bunch of pokemon here . 
  i have n't fought in such a long time . 
  i await your challenge in my gym at new island . ], 
  i mean , i 'm not against using arial/tnr for documents but we could try something else , right ? 
  there are thousands of fonts out there . 
  though , some nice professional looking ones are around 50bucks per style and a student ca n't really afforded . 
  once in the internet , forever in the internet . 
  toasted crickets with salt are delicious . 
  i suppose it was just a matter of time to get picked up, 
  i am working and earning money . 
  also , i suppose i should repair that laptop computer if i desire to continue with my stories : p, 
  [ i 'm fine * shrugs * not much to say . ], 
  eso es / r/mysterybox en extremely hard mode xd ;, 
  and this is why i hate telcel and should be struck down . 
  it affects everyone in the country that tries to use the celphone service . 
  and it 's really slow and pathetic . 
  and expensive . 
  [ despues de luc\u00eda ] ( http://www.divxonline.info/pelicula/14699/despues-de-lucia-2012/ ) | 2012 | director ( es ) : michel franco, 
  i did read but here 's the deal : telcel is very expensive and even more when it is the one lending the service . 
  i know he has contracted fido but telcel is the owner of most of the lines in mexico and the # 1 option phone carriers switch to upon entering the country . 
  part of why the fees are so high ( aside from the child being careless ) is due the monopoly the company has over the service , charging as much as they want to the users and third parties hanging from their service . 
  that is why - for example - when you get skype credit it can be unlimited to phones and mobiles in the us but it can cost up to 40 usd for the same service in mexico . 
  telcel + telmex ( owned by the same person , forbe 's # 1 rich man in the world ) is a huge monopoly that is part of the reasons why the cost of phone service is high . 
  though , in all sense , the parents should have probably been informed of that or just turn off the roaming . 
  technically - at least until future notice - slenderman = / = operator . 
  operator is the ** official ** name for `` slendy '' in marble hornets . 
  i know it 's obviously based on slenderman but the word of god has say that he is n't meant to be called like that . 
  i did exactly that !, 
  my parents bought the encyclopedia britanica and a encyclopedia for the history of my country . 
  i would also go around to my schoolmate 's parties on elementary school , get bored of eating cake and find their own books and encyclopedias . 
  i never understood why their parents were so thrilled to see me read them , as i just found them to be more interesting than the party itself . 
  i gained a lot of hatred from my mates due to their parents often telling them they should be like myself ; ; ;, 
  in mexico we have the following :, 
  pues , nimodo ( well , what can we do ? . 
  lit `` well , there 's no way '' ), 
  so as you can see , it 's not an isolated phrase etched to a culture : p, 
  popcorn . 
  the air popped kind of popcorn , mind you . 
  i am a mangaka . 
  ~ ~ or trying to be one , i do n't know . 
  i pretty much fail at the job . 
  wait , i have a job ? 
  holy shit ! ~ ~, 
  but calling myself `` mangaka '' is too boring , `` the mangaka '' is too general . 
  thus ' * da * mangaka '', 
  usually i do n't give a fuck about how i look ( not that i dress badly , it 's just that i get to wear what i feel to that day ) , and act very much like a regular dude . 
  if i suddenly turn shy around you , with make up and dress extremely girly , i 'm probably * very * interested in you . 
  i had it around 7 years ago . 
  i used to have astigmatism and myopia and got the procedure paid thanks to my father 's insurance . 
  it took about 5 minutes and after that i was given some drops/medicine and blackglasses to wear for a week or two after that . 
  i must say that the worst part of that was to take the medicine , as the first days it can be * hard * to open your eyes , let alone have drops fall down on them ( can be hard already with normal eyes ) . 
  2 weeks later , i am was well and even wearing blue contacts for a cosplay at comic-con . 
  it 's worth it . 
  wow , there * really * is a sub for that ? 
  til, 
  i really do n't understand how you can go from traumatized to bawling your eyes off . 
  it 's what it always stood up for me in fantasia . 
  and that it 's way it 's one of my favorite movies of all time, 
  yeah . 
  despite me saying that i 'm genderfluid , i ca n't help but to try to look my best when i want to catch something . 
  i guess it 's a natural impulse . 
  though it varies : when it comes to men that have caught my attention , i become utterly shy and dress too girly ( as mentioned before ) . 
  when i am attracted to a girl i go on to a * much * more masculine look and predisposition . 
  but in the end , it 's all about looking good for the show . 
  you 're just staring at the lake : p, 
  which is fine but , really not that much productive . 
  microwaves : forever used to make popcorn since the dawn of it 's existance, 
  i really never understood that really . 
  what do you gain when calling yourself x-american ? 
  special status ? 
  free hugs ? 
  i know differences are good - it complements us and does n't make the world boring - but the excessive hyphenation found in america seems a tad ridiculous and is actually part of what keeps each group divided . 
  you 'd be a stronger nation if you forgot all that and just be called ~ ~ ` muricans ~ ~ americans . 
  that 's all you are . 
  so he lives in kaliningrad ? 
  sure , any refs for yourself ? 
  it actually gets hilarious when ancestries mix : `` oh , hai , i 'm an american from north carolina born from german parents but my grandmum is from england and my uncle from my dad 's side is french '', 
  when you go on discerning the origins , the description is akin to a mary-sue . 
  perhaps that 's why it makes me cringe , being a ~ ~ pseudo ~ ~ writer, 
  references . 
  he did n't officially swear , did he ? 
  does that still make him president or . 
  oh dear goddesses , the implications of this . 
  thank you for all your love ~ ~ and incredible amount of workload ~ ~, 
  i shall be tending your requests as i can . 
  i work from 7am to 5 ... then go to the gym . . 
  the thing is that i 'll toss around a lot of drawings on the weekend . 
  i 'll reply to each and your posts asap , so stay tuned = w = b, 
  - da mangaka, 
  when the lights got up ? 
  bitch please . 
  that meant we could have more fun . 
  lime juice on all things, 
  hopefully they wo n't charge 2 usd to take photos of them . 
  though i 'd like to have a sombrero when i do,
