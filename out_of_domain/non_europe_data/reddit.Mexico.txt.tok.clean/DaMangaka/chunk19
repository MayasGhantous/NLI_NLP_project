  mexico has never been stable politically and that can be seen on having 50 presidents in a bit more than 50 years . 
  also , according to the agreements upon independence , they were hoping to establish an empire with a spaniard royal which upon unable to contact or convince had iturbide stuck in there . 
  then he was tossed off and vanished . 
  the 1824 constitution came in and after guadalupe victoria , noone seemed to care . 
  if anything , the reason why mexico is stuck where it is is because if their politicians flipping the bird to the own laws they make . 
  depends : i only went to private schools and at least you went for 6 hours a day . 
  7 in secundaria ( middle school ) and 5 in prepa ( high school ) . 
  i did also go a year to a public high school ( la lazaro , para que te des una idea ) and while we did have scheduled 5 hrs for a day , there were barely any classes going . 
  just my two cents there . 
  most kinders in my area teach english starting from * kindergarden *, 
  but these are mostly private kinders . 
  i thought you said you were from tijuana . 
  well , to point it out : in private schools , the school can go to have 7 hours of classes per day ( without counting extra-curricular clubs and all . ), 
  public school have around 5 classes per day but teachers wo n't show up most of the time which makes students not even bother to wait for him to show up and fluke . 
  lazaro high ( preparatoria federal lazaro cardenas ) is supposed to be the most important and prestigious public high school here in tijuana , yet it shows the same errors as with other public schools . 
  the original theme song in japanese goes this way :, 
  tatoe hi no naka mizu no naka kusa no naka mori no naka, 
  for example , in fire , in water , in grass , in forests, 
  in earth , in clouds , in that girl 's skirt ( eek ! ), 
  when pikachu is running around and passed the girl , this plays . 
  it 's in the very beginning . 
  [ mezase pokemon master ] ( http://www.animelyrics.com/anime/pocketm/pmmezase.htm ), 
  ~ * throws quick ball * ~, 
  what th ... * blinded * ghah !!, 
  . . that 's probably why it did n't work ? 
  ~ using sunglasses , temporarily blind ~ that 's pretty much what i tend to have in my pokeball stash these days . 
  and let me guess , only in df , guadalajara and monterrey . 
  you know , if it was n't because i lived in tijuana and thus could cross the border to get my meloetta via gamestop , i 'd cry hard at not being able to obtain these giveaway pokemon . 
  as a mexican in mexico , we are celebrating that we defeated the states in beisbol !, 
  7/10 not autistic enough, 
  as a gay swedish banging a fellow gay atheist autistic pal , i can fully attest that op is a fag, 
  additionally :, 
  lunes : luna ( moon ) . 
  martes : marte ( mars ) . 
  domingo : ?? 
  ( it is related to the sun , but ca n't recall the base for the name in spanish ) . 
  my week in spanish sounds much better . 
  and let me not start with the japanese week where friday is golden . 
  miya 's stuck ( in his own words ) with me since 1999 . 
  quite a long time . 
  as a mexican , i disagree . 
  tacos can come in many forms and sizes , have different fillings , be portable , makes us come together to chow ... but overall they are good and delicious . 
  i do n't think jesus can do any of that nor is delicious . 
  focus miss might miss sometimes but it 's not as missing as other moves , say hypnosis or thunder . 
  to be honest , it misses less than the all favorite stone edge . 
  so , i do n't see why not . 
  it also works inversely with `` dive '' . 
  if wailord is battling on a field , does it dig or does it dive in the ground ? 
  no , i think earthquake would be what would happen when wailord does `` bounce '', 
  since birth apparently . 
  allow me to explain in small bullets :, 
  - survived my birth . 
  i was wrapped 4 times around my umbilical cord . 
  mom was into trying to birth me natural until the doctor stepped in . 
  - at 6 months the high chair * almost * fell on my head . 
  it missed me by inches , instead hitting my middle finger . 
  the chair was not so lucky after that ... 
  - i almost fell a 20ft hole at age 5, 
  - i managed to skip being hit by a car at age 10, 
  . and yet another car by choosing to drive my face at a telephone booth while riding a bike that had faulty breaks . 
  - i 've broken 3 of my limbs . 
  i tend to wonder what would happen to my right leg . 
  and i 'm saying alive more = 7 =, 
  but then they meet in johto and mewtwo does n't wipe the memory of ash and co. + team rocket trio . 
  the special is called `` mewtwo returns '', 
  4kids , is that you ? 
  shyamalan twist : turns out kim jong un * is * the new pope and he 's using the north korean war to advent the coming of christ . 
  well , hello there . 
  i am da mangaka . 
  yeah . 
  let 's not get too much onto me . 
  i shall introduce you the elusive miyamoto ( aka miya ) . 
  - ** age ** : 15, 
  - ** main form : ** [ human ] ( http://th08.deviantart.net/fs71/pre/f/2010/246/0/d/0d34d8c83b29b76884db6df05a08e115-d2xyern.png ) . 
  [ he ] ( http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs21/i/2007/281/d/c/_moonlight__by_gslucky.png ) [ has ] ( http://gslucky.deviantart.com/art/who-is-shigeru-miyamoto-154764795?q=gallery%3agslucky%2f8281&amp;qo=29 ) [ grown ] ( http://th02.deviantart.net/fs5/pre/i/2004/287/5/a/bs_dream_holding_snowflake_by_gslucky.jpg ) [ quite ] ( http://th02.deviantart.net/fs6/pre/i/2005/036/f/5/at_cetys_high__photo_1__by_gslucky.jpg ) [ a lot ] ( http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs5/i/2004/279/f/9/portada_de_mi_cuaderno_by_gslucky.jpg ) though . 
  - ** true form : ** classified at the petition of the muse . 
  - ** birthday ** february 6, 
  - ** likes ** long philosophical ~ ~ rants ~ ~ talks , tea , exploring the world around him , meditating , battling ( ~ ~ [ it 's been quite a long time though ] ~ ~ ) , cooking and poking into places to see if i 'm doing well and have n't died . 
  on regards to cooking : he adores japanese food with a passion and might become a picky eater when you do not serve food in a specific fashion . 
  it has gotten to the point i have learned to decorate and serve my dishes restaurant style because otherwise he wo n't approve . 
  my family seems to love these details though . 
  - ** dislikes ** : he will say that he dislikes humans but he has a long and somewhat sad story about that that i do n't think he 'll let me disclose as of now . 
  but aside from that he does n't like how close minded they can be and most of the times go on rambling on how stupid and blind they can be . 
  if you pike his interest , though , he might consider talking with you . 
  on other dislikes : he is utterly clean . 
  he dislikes disorder and will go as far as to clean the whole house to make sure everything is in a perfect harmony/order . 
  he dislikes being disturbed when napping or meditating and does not like sweet things . 
  he might eat them but prefers to skip them as much as possible . 
  the more bitter , the better . 
  he does n't dislike but wo n't put attention to worldly matters unless it concerns something that he appreciates or might affect his environment drastically . 
  he can be a sort of a sore looser but he 'll lighten up fast . 
  he has other dislikes about certain other things and * will * make you know about them . 
  perhaps too much . 
  - ** quirks ** : his first contact language is japanese . 
  second is english . 
  took him about 3 years to actually learn spanish ( which i speak ) but rarely uses it since it sounds ` odd ' to him . 
  he can read and type but can not write . 
  he 's also left handed , though he had to learn to use the right hand more often so that our cover is n't blown during possession , among other things and quirks of myself he had to `` master '' . 
  perhaps due to my father , he enjoys 80s music more than any stream of music right now though he is more inclined onto rock . 
  he can play the guitar though on a lefty .
