  also , during such days he cuts his hair very short . 
  despite his human form , he still acts very feline : p,

  [ i can go and rant forever about this , so i shall try to be brief . 
  it 's their attitude in general regarding their own species . 
  they call themselves advanced or they go even as far as to glorify themselves as ` god 's ' perfect creation when in reality they are even more flawed than the animals they shove away as ` stupid ' . 
  they are greatly blind and unaware which causes most of the problems they whine about . 
  in other words , human stupidity makes me cringe greatly and even more on how much damage it causes to everything around them , even themselves . ], 
  til . 
  ~ ~ nooooooooooooooo . 
  . you 'll make him rant for hours !!!!, 
  [ why thank you for the compliment . 
  on regards to your question , i see the humans as what they are which is a species . 
  the species on itself is flawed , like many others . 
  perfection is a state that can not exist and is even unhealthy . 
  to seek for perfection is akin to seeking francium : possible but feeble , your efforts will certainly vanish . 
  the problem here comes when this species in general has a concept of ownership that not only damages itself but other species they commute with . 
  i 'm seeing it more over the sociological stand point since the psychology of it is still rather baffling to me and i am still reading about it to get a better understanding . 
  from a younger age , a child is brought upon the world with a sense of entitlement with stories such of how a ` god ' created them to be the owners of a land and are thus free to do as they please , or how because of their intellect they are entitled to take over a place which is also shared by their kind and other creatures . 
  from this moment , there is a lot of development that is presented to this child which forms him to be part of a society which in general believes itself to be perfect but flawed in a sense of always needing something they do n't , hoping to obtain more by doing less and demanding tolerance when they can not . 
  human life is a paradox i have yet to understand but from what experiences i have and seen , it is not only stupid but it is irking and frustrating . 
  the sense of entitlement they have to do , possess and control can become even horrifying . 
  what they will do to seek pleasure is sickening to the point i often wonder if those called insane are much more sane than those whom people see as role models . 
  models created by hoarding as much as that energetic trade you call money . 
  what is the point of it anyways ? 
  from somebody that can see it from far and in a bigger picture , it is retarded . ], 
  as a mexican , stfu you yank !, 
  it fucking happened to me as well !, 
  i was just minding my own business and trying to get an apricorn when ... 
  though apparently it 's very common in the route towards national park . 
  were n't they going to send beiber over there anyways ? 
  [ it seems you and i have a lot of things in common . 
  i like you . ],

  ** breaking news ** the new pope is from argentina . 
  his name is jorge mario bergoglio and he 's 76 years old . 
  carry on . 
  so , the new pope is argentinian . 
  as a mexican , i have * no * idea how to feel about this ... 
  practically , they cheated : /, 
  worse : it seems this pope participated in the argentinian dictatorship and barring that , he does n't seem too liberal . 
  new pope , same poop,

  i suppose somebody would have already stated this on the 500 + comments but i 'll add more info :, 
  people that live in the border tend to come here to mexico for cheap medical treatments and medicine . 
  i know many friends from san diego whose purpose of crossing is to go to the doctor , get prescribed and get the medicine here . 
  in ave. revolucion , there are dozens of doctors and dentists ready to tend the american population and that even take their insurances . 
  it 's become part of the `` medical tourism '' where you can even get free botox injections and plastic surgery by top notch doctors . 
  all close to the border . 
  now i know our public healthcare is shit but it can be rather good on other ` higher ' medical conditions such as cancer . 
  and the private one is n't bad either . 
  so , yeah , well known situation for folks around the border . 
  b-but . 
  . skype is now from microsoft ... 
  as an atheist gay swedish , i can confirm this,

  i 'm very curious about this line :, 
   ` if the aggressors trigger off a war on our country ... 
  yeah , so . 
  apparently * they * wo n't start the war , they 'll just defend themselves if the trigger goes off on them . 
  i think it will be a long time before any country moves in to do something .

  a small story here regarding burger king . 
  i was 11 back then and we where having fun and all . 
  the next day , my teacher notices i 'm a bit pale and my eyes yellowish . 
  i also feel like i did n't sleep at all . 
  teacher calls my mom , mom takes me to the doctor . 
  turns out i had contracted hepatitis a. 
  i spent the next two weeks eating pinke lemonade ice cream . 
  it was very cool . 
  but yeah , ever since that day , we have never eaten there * ever * . 
  wow !, 
  that really seems like a neat place to go !, 
  thanks !, 
  the first time i did so was at the last day at my university . 
  i just openly stated i was bi ( though as of now , i have redefined myself as pan , but whatever : p ) . 
  their reaction : `` of all the odd things you have done , this is the least of them '' . 
  some even seemed to have made a * bet * on whether i was or not : /, 
  father nor sis know , but mother kind of corned me at a restaurant asking why i was so into lgtb causes and so supportive of them . 
  it turns out that day was also `` national coming out '' day so i braced myself and told her . 
  she is still sort of in denial but did n't really tell me anything bad about it . 
  she is a catholic catequist after all . 
  though when i told her i did n't believe in all that mumble jumble , she almost flipped a table . 
  edit : aaaaaaaaaaaand i just realized i read the question wrong . 
  . damn it . 
  ohhhhhhhhhhh , buuuuuuuuuuuuuuurn .
