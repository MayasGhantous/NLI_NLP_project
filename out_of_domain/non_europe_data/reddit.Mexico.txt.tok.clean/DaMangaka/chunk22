  well , he did cite me `` after school , at the bell tower '' . 
  hello there !, 
  thanks so much for doing this sort of thing for the lgtbaqix community there , in the heart of kansas where we all know the challenges that one might encounter . 
  i do n't live in the us but i want to know if there 's any way to support the cause from other places outside the state or the states . 
  kickstarter ? 
  other ways ? 
  ~ ~ i wan na donate some framed art to bring more color to the house : p ~ ~, 
  a : asexual . 
  i : intersex . 
  x : what ever other spectrum i 'm missing . 
  this is mainly a placeholder, 
  mexican here : soooooooo ... we * are * sort of similar . 
  mexican here : as somebody stated - though the poster was from * spain * - the constant bitching about corruption when in fact most of our people will be willing to give bribes to police men , park on spots that should n't ( and some in double line ~ ~ los estoy viendo , chilangos ~ ~ ) , use people for obtaining certain benefits ( we call them ` palancas ' , or lever in english ) , etc. 
  also , there is this big sense of defeat . 
  our minds seem to be wired to accept defeat easily . 
  there 's this famous phrase that says that we are the `` ya merito '' people . 
  ( `` we almost did it '' ) . 
  when we play in the world cup , for example , many are already expecting the team to be defeated by the round prior to the quarterfinals . 
  it is hard for us to embrace the concept of wining and when one indeed wins , others wonder if they used unorthodox methods . 
  also , that the country is n't so keen to read and it 's glued to the crap shown on tv . 
  just some quirks here . 
  i freaking hate blackboard . 
  the blackboard servers can go to hell and burn . 
  i did see in hetalia ~ ~ from all places to learn about this ~ ~ about how * frequent * strikes in france were . 
  so much , there are even some sort of tourist bulletins as to see what 's running and what 's under a strike . 
  is it really that bad ? 
  good morning , mr. moore , great to see you in reddit . 
  i do n't really have a question for you to ask but i do have a small suggestion for a possible a future film or book . 
  depending on what you pick : p, 
  that is about the whole mess that is the drug prohibition and thus , the war against drugs . 
  i have a believe this topic needs to be tackled in the us and is n't attended . 
  with the whole hype of having a regulation on guns , it is also time to decriminalize drugs and regulate them , bringing further down the level of violence caused by this whole thing . 
  would like some words about this topic too also . 
  thanks and sorry if this seems too random . 
  in mexico , teachers and workers go to strike for feeble reasons too . 
  though most of the time , it 's because the union is * ordering * to do so or else they 'll loose their privileges . 
  some strike because they do believe they need a change but most of the times , worker strikes ( most specifically the teacher strikes orchestrated by the snte ) are choreographed by the union to force the government to do as they please . 
  it 's sickening and it degrades the value of what strikes are really for . 
  so in some sense , i feel you . 
  my reaction :, 
  ~ ~ either you are trolling ... or you are really somebody interested in mexico . 
  awesome ~ ~, 
  1 ) america !, 
  ( read as ` murica ( ? ), 
  2 ) guess what ? 
  we are also part of america . 
  and we also have an eagle, 
  3 ) but * also * a snake !, 
  4 ) ( v \u2310 \u25a0 , \u25a0 ) ** deal with it ** ( \u25a0 _ \u25a0 \u00ac ), 
  actually , i was about to put that there too . 
  but 's kind of part of the whole defeatist way of thought we tend to have . 
  `` why can fulanito be able to put a business and i ca n't ? 
  it 's not fair that he succeed . 
  therefore , i 'm going to go fuck that idiot '', 
   : | the government is also in this mindset and it 's ridiculous . 
  to be honest , we lost to argentina because they were dicks . 
  . and we * fell * for it . 
  we know how they play and we can actually play better . 
  it 's just that when our egos are hurt , we get too fucking sentimental and begin to make tantrums . 
  that 's what killed us on 2010 . 
  it was n't argentina , it was us ~ ~ and to be honest , it reflects a lot of how we tend to act in daily basis . ~ ~, 
  speaking of daily basis , the reply from a normal mexican would be `` yeah , but then s.korea would have defeated us anyways ... oh !, 
  we won ? 
  oh shit , we are facing germany ?!, 
  \\* nothing to do here \\* '', 
  you should have seen when passed to quarterfinals in the olympics . 
  many bets among peers on how we would * loose * . 
  when we finally won , while the country did get excited , there were others that went `` oh , yeah ... of * course * we would win gold in f\u00fatbol . 
  but all the other olympic courses ? 
  just silver and bronze , tch . 
  we are defeatist by nature it seems ... \u0ca0\u30d8\u0ca0, 
  my sister wanted to get into uabc and she had a high score on the exam . 
  she did n't get in , but her friend that scored lower managed to get in due to the `` palancas '' ( her mother had a teacher working there ) . 
  it 's fucking frustrating , specially when you are trying to get a job . 
  this is a trick question . 
  something i 'm actually addressing in a book i 'm writing . 
  ~ ~ you lie mangaka !, 
  it 's a hetalia fanficion ! ~ ~, 
  i once went to the south and it seems many are in * love * with the ~ ~ american ~ ~ statian culture . 
  why would n't they ? 
  all they get to see on tv ( brought to you by televisa \u00a9 ) is successful americans who get to live on their daily lives . 
  watch any sit-com of what ever genre you want : comedy , action , drama ... 
  despite the plot or the whole aspect of the show ( heck , even the walking death , a post-apocalyptic show ) , i can not deny that it is * much * better than what many folks in the south live on . 
  people who ca n't even get regular running water or electricity , let alone dress so fashionably or be able to travel to places . 
  this same formula is used by soap operas in mexico to portray how a poor young lass ( usually from the furthest of hills of the poor areas in mexico ) , arrives to mexico city , falls in love , drama and then finally she gets the guy whom she marries and moves to * miami * , obtaining a better life . 
  however !, 
  as one that lives in the border - and the closer to the north you are , you get to realize this too - you get to notice that not much of the things you see in the us shows are * true * at all . 
  you can distinguish between fiction and reality . 
  sure , some want to be trendy and what not , but certainly are the most vocal when it comes to pointing out the us ' faults and bashing their culture . 
  in tl ; dr : depends on your live , what you watch and learn really . 
  though , there are a * lot * of socialist movements in the south that * despise * everything that 's from the states . 
  many in the north that make their babies be born in cities in the us so they have double nationality . 
  so , more than rejecting or embracing , we move it as we please . 
  and imho , no . 
  i do n't want the us ' culture to leak into mexico that much . 
  it would be very harmful tbh . 
  ** edit to expand more : ** we tend to be very embracing of many cultures . 
  our food is a prime example of what happens when we get immigrants . 
  they become part of us and thus in the end , these immigrants become mexicans too . 
  the problem with the us culture in general ( there are good quirks like the whole `` stand up fer yer rights '' thing ) is that it 's * very * individualistic .
