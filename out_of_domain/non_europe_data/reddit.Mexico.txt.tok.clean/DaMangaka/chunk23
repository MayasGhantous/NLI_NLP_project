  each man to it 's own . 
  mexico is a communal culture ( for the best or the worse ) and it would be a horrible clash . 
  i see it when i go to the states that there are all `` americans '' but they have their own clikes , their own ` areas ' where latinos , asians , african-american and others can be on their own instead of integrating and becoming one big happy ( or angry ? ), 
  country . 
  when there is somebody succeeding , it 's due that specific clike ( the '' * chinese * - american director blah blah blah '' ) . 
  in mexico , a german-mexican is mexican , period . 
  you are no more special than anybody else ( and therefore you are fucked by the system as everyone else . 
  and if not , fuck you with the pri ) . 
  if a japanese-mexican talks , sure ... at first many might be surprised that japanese descendant people exist , but after learning he was born here , he 'll just be one of the bunch . 
  no special treatment , no nada . 
  i do n't say that it is n't good to rejoice of the multiple cultures and all but again , the us culture is very individualistic and the mexican tends to suck everything in . 
  all it might cause is to start separating us more . 
  . than what we are already . 
  and not to mention it 's ** evil ** and you should burn in hell with elba ester gordillo . 
  t _ t ; fuck you guys , at least if you used a palanca , be man enough to say so . 
  . wow . 
  i think i know how to get rich in mexico city . 
  there are like 2 manifestations per week in there < _ <, 
  ~ ~ nivel de amor a argentina : +1 ~ ~, 
  so brave, 
  i know that in part it 's televisa 's fault ( now now . 
  . there 's a long story about this , wo n't get to that though ) that the national soccer team sucks , also the ego they suddenly boast but . 
  really , if you really want to make them feel good about themselves . 
  . do n't fucking throw rocks at them : / it does n't help them * at all * . 
  if you are so much of an expert in futbol , go and fucking play then t at #, 
  i do n't really mind that : my dad was helping me get a job with his contacts and all . 
  the thing that pisses me off is that there are guys who get idiots in positions other need and go strolling around casually presenting themselves as righteous people . 
  if you use a palanca , be a man and say so . 
  it is blatantly obvious when one did so and it only makes you look * retarded * . 
  the birth of a trend . 
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand we are in the same boat here . 
  it 's really sad . 
  ~ ~ now , please do me a favor to not rock it . 
  do n't give me a reason to kick you out . 
  i 'm sure the uruguayan up there wo n't appreciate it either . 
  i am currently in what some guys can call a `` forbidden relationship '' . 
  though it 's also a `` secret '' one . 
  my parent 's do n't know i have a girlfriend ( i 'm a chick , so you get where i 'm going ) and i 'm not sure they 'd be too accepting of that . 
  so yeah , nothing super extra wow . 
  i suppose it 's the regular nowadays : p, 
  good for you sir . 
  excellent choice = 7 = < 3, 
  mexico city . 
  there are actually * many * . 
  * to begin with , many spaniards ( peninsulares ) actually stayed during the war of independence and supported us ( perhaps not as openly ) . 
  if it was n't enough , many came rushing when the franco dictatorship was around . 
  we even sort of invited them . 
  many adopted mexican citizenship and - if you have heard - some of these people 's descendants where even given the choice of becoming spaniards . 
  * during the world wars ( and wars before and in between , like the italian reunification wars , the franco-prussian war , to name some ) many refugees came in here due to political or social reasons . 
  you can ask a chihuahuense about the `` menonitas '' which are german inmigrants akin to the amish in the united states . 
  they are well known for their cheese ~ ~ and their fat killing fiber ~ ~ . 
  ~ ~ * did i already mention beer here , because that 's totally thanks to germany * ~ ~, 
  in the south and the capital , you see french influence ( the bolillo is our version of the french baguette , not to mention the * very * noticeably french-like buildings in mexico city courtesy of porfirio d\u00edaz ) . 
  no bolillo , no torta . 
  speaking of italy , many of them went to the northwest were they continued their tradition of wines ( la cetto to point one ) . 
  the italian cuisine is a staple in tijuana where the caesar salad was created . 
  in mexicali , meanwhile , chinese helped to build the city - and possibly made what we call the ` typical ' chinese take out food . 
  * on the topic of baja california , we can not stop touching the political part : russians came from even before the bolshevik movement and possibly brought their communist ideas ( which might or might not been inspiration for the troubled left in mexico ) . 
  anarchy was predominant in tijuana too , thanks to the brothers flores mag\u00f3n , whose ideas started even * before * the mexican revolution . 
  trotsky came to mexico ~ ~ and got shot , thanks pe\u00f1a nieto ~ ~ and had an affair with frida kahlo ~ ~ whose husband did n't like that though . 
  . he was totally fine if she did other women ... pheh ~ ~, 
  * on artists , bret\u00f3n - the lead of the surrealist movement - came to m\u00e9xico and swore never to come again . 
  his reason : `` i can not come back to mexico , it is the most surreal country i 've ever been ! '' . 
  speaking of surrealist , there was also luis bu\u00f1uel who became mexican ( being from spain originally ) and did . 
  . . odd movies at first , then some other cool ones then other movies at the end . 
  our country has been influenced by austrians on regards to arts while under maximilian i. . . and the ** french ** ~ ~ of course ! ~ ~, 
  maybe you 've heard of sergei einstein and his sort-of-failed-but-cool \u00a1 viva m\u00e9xico ! . 
  and these are just examples . 
  * good * examples on how people from other countries come here and give us influences . 
  we do n't tend to see this because either our history books tend to completely ignore them ( yep , i think this is it ... ) or just because we just point out the important part which is `` it came from mexico '' . 
  the caesar salad ? 
  it came from mexico . 
  who did it ? 
  who cares , it 's mexican you idiot !, 
  it is n't italian ~ ~ even if an italian did do it ~ ~ !, 
  the best * mexican * beer in the world ? 
  it was n't an italian-mexican invention , or a german-mexican invention . 
  pffft , we disregard that . 
  it 's 100 % mexican ~ ~ ** a webo ** ~ ~, 
  it 's too complicated really . 
  i put this reply on another tread on kind of the same topic : people in the states pride about their descendants . 
  that 's fine , really . 
  it 's cool to see that you are american from a british mum and an indian dad whose dad is really from persia/iran . 
  therefore , it entitles you to be an persinditish american or a irani-hindo-british-american . 
  . whut ? 
  it 's like a mary sue that is like 60 % saiyan and 10 % neko and . 
  . . who knows : /, 
  you . 
  are . 
  american . 
  period . 
  and you ca n't even sing `` god save the queen '' without looking like a total wanker in the us . 
  ~ ~ while they call all blonds gringos , technically you are n't . 
  gringos are what we call to the people of the states . 
  our ignorance is stupid ... ~ ~, 
  it 's really bad that you had that going . 
  i really hate our law enforcement . 
  but i ca n't throw rocks at them : they are paid shit . 
  bribes are part of what keeps them alive really : /,
