  no , it does n't . 
  to be honest , it would best if they paid them directly instead of collecting the parking spot cash or . 
  they are horribly underpaid which is why many policemen decide instead to join the narco gangs . 
  they get paid much more to protect their interests than those of the people . 
  that 's why in mexico - maybe you noticed - we * do n't * trust policemen . 
  they are last in line when looking for help . 
  this is policemen in general sadly . 
  and since they are in a position of power , they can also be dickheads and abuse you without reason so that you pay them something and let you go . 
  it 's really that bad . 
  but , are n't scandinavians people from iceland/norway/sweden / denmark/finland ? 
  if you were born in the us , you are n't scandinavian , you are from the us . 
  see ? 
  this is why people pirate your products . 
  if you would stop being such dicks and would sell them at reasonable prices everywhere , nobody would be going to piratebay to obtain what you sell excesively high . 
  also , would n't `` ticket to us + adobe product '' make ir expensive still ? 
  is n't limewire dead ? 
  you look beautiful on both genders . 
  i am kind of envious ; w ;, 
  congratulations on the transition ~ !, 
  this is my mom sadly . 
  i told her that i am pansexual and it kind of trying to understand it . 
  i told mom that i do n't believe in god and tried to shove me in the bible . 
  dad too , to my surprise . 
  they ca n't believe i can go around without the belief of something like a god  : | . 
  the founder of the first utopia .

  but it * has * a large history . 
  it is really sad you say it does n't . 
  it is a long and fantastic adventure : from it 's origins to the many civil and social struggles . 
  to say that the united states does not have a history for being a relatively young country is very sad . 
  and while if it were really a melting pot , there would n't be a need for hyphens . 
  you 'd all be happy little americans joining hands with each other and spreading liberty and justice all over the world ~ ~ specially on where oil reserves are ~ ~,

  i will never forget it really . 
  it was a high school class and we had to read parts of this english book per turn . 
  ( ya know , to learn pronunciation , blah blah ) . 
  in comes this guy who usually seems cool , reserved and even a bit cold . 
  he began to read but then began to stutter and just could n't continue on reading . 
  we then found out he had dyslexia . 
  the guy tried and tried but just could n't go on and began to cry . 
  i found it very disheartening . 
  in mexico , we have `` los nacos '', 
  you ca n't forget the sinaloan people , or rather than just a state , those in the north that listen musica grupera and banda . 
  first language is spanish , but most of the time i think in english . 
  like vuvuzelas at a world cup ? 
  bring yer booze here and let 's throw a party like never before . 
  we 'll have a good time .

  so i go all day wondering for that damned rufflet . 
  it is 11:50 pm , i need to get up at 5am the next day and i go `` well , damn it !,

  if by some sort of destiny i get one before midnight and it 's shiny , then i 'll take it as a sign that this job i have will be that stable job i 've been looking for . '',

  it happens where i live too . 
  they take political parties as if they were some sort of soccer club you have to cheer to .

  alright . 
  thanks !, 
  i have a story in the making - which is actually a sequel to another one - called `` cyber wars '' . 
  the base of the society at the time the story takes place - around 200 years in the future - is a society which segregates `` normal '' people from cyberians . 
  the cyberians are half human , half cyber ( though the cyber part comes thanks to some alien synthetic lifeform ) . 
  the thing is , while it is written that there should be no discrimination , the humans attack the cyberians and shun them for not being `` natural '' , hating/fearing what ever abilities they possess .
