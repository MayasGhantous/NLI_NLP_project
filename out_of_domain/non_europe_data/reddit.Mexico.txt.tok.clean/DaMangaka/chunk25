  the cyberians are n't saints though , also getting at odds with the humans . 
  there are riots between them and each interpretation of their religion ( from either the humasn of cybers ) are used against each other . 
  this is supposed to be in a time where small time machines are already being tested and cancer has been cured . 
  there is a lot of hate/fear . 
  so yes , despite it being a fictional account on my story , i do see that the next discrimination would be precisely that . 
  there 's the `` gringo spanish '' that we mexicans go about poking about the american people . 
  hard to explain with words but i 'm pretty sure most of you might know about it . 
  worse of it for you guys : we have this thing called `` double r '', 
  try saying `` ferrocarril '' . 
  i dare you . 
  or we go around talking `` engrish '' by adding ` shion ' or ` eiro ' to everything . 
  `` est\u00e1 bien cool la perforashion '', 
  ferrocarril is the keyword to see if you have learned to talk correctly in spanish . 
  it 's impossible unless you gain a lot of practice . 
  you 'll get it one day = w = b, 
  what 's your language ? 
  if your main language is a romantic language , it is a bit obvious why it 's not that hard . 
  for example , french . 
  ~ ~ you should n't for we shall conquer the us and recover our lost territory soon , just as planned ! ~ ~, 
  that 's an interesting way to learn the ` r 's here . 
  we do have a soft ` r ' ( carolina ) and the rough ` r ' ( carmelita ) . 
  . . and of course , the * double * r ( ferrari ) . 
  i just feel for the japanese and their lack of ` r 's, 
  and so , i am fifth . 
  i am not against them trying to assimilate with us ~ ~ it is inevitable , after all . 
  we are such charming people ~ ~ , but i ca n't avoid cringing when a white american attempts to say `` hey guey ! '' . 
  they pronounce it wrong and in the worst of cases , in the wrong scenarios . 
  though , also , i will have to poke at the `` chicanos '' who barely know spanish and yet use these slangs .
