  ~ ~ \\* somewhat regular / r/circlejerk visitor/poster \\* ~ ~, 
  or was it just a one time thing ? 
  there are 3 types of writing in japanese : hiragana , katakana and kanji . 
  kanji is the ` main ' system , the others used for support or foreign words . 
  i can only read hiragana and katakana and some kanji . 
  `` i just need to learn all the kanji and * maybe * i 'll be able to read it without half of the time going `` huh ?!, 
  what 's this symbol for ? '', 
  i know , but there are still some ` key ' kanji i can hop on . 
  again , when i see kanji i avoid it all together because i know i 'll get a botched translation . 
  i 'm still learning though . 
  apples . 
  eat all the apples and tangerines !, 
  and if there are any , i would make a fresh casserole of popcorn . 
  with a bit of oil and salt , it 's deliciousness , and it has fiber !, 
  fantasia is my all time favorite . 
  despite there being no real plot , it is a masterpiece . 
  pure art . 
  heck , they were going to add a sequence made by [ salvador dali ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/destino ) if you are into how trippy it would have been . 
  the music it 's just perfect . 
  it was n't outmatched by fantasia 2000 , which i found that it lacked some of the magic of the original but still made it out . 
  i wish there were more of these kind of movies . 
  i have never understood why people * do n't * like atlantis . 
  i loved the story and the mystical world it was developed in . 
  very underrated , should get more recognition . 
  keeping up with the kardashians . 
  i mean , what 's up with following these kind of people ? 
  for starters : i am a girl . 
  going to buy clothes is a fucking torture . 
  i hate buying clothes and the fact that every manufacturer has it 's own way to interpret sizes does not help . 
  for example : when i get unisex of guy t-shirts , if it 's m ( the size i usually pic in these cases ) it 's m. there 's not a `` m petite '' or `` m with sugar on top '' . 
  getting a shirt , a pair of pants it 's a frustrating ordeal that i want to avoid at all costs and sadly i ca n't because my father will constantly poke at how i should get new clothes because i look like a portrait . 
  i understand that there are different body builds and stuff , but that 's what i 've seen wonderfully in men 's clothing : there 's a standard . 
  if it 's 30s , it 's 30s . 
  not size 12 with extra tight buttocks or what ever . 
  sadly , i ca n't crossdress because it 's icky and wrong and . 
  and . 
  it already happened . 
  and it was glorious, 
  / r/feminism vs / r/mensrights, 
  followed by a match of / r/4chan vs / r/circlejerk, 
  i hate jeans that are at the level of the waist . 
  i have this tendency of wearing them up to my belly button , which can cause a prominent camel toe . 
  do n't get me started on those papery like baby doll t-shirts . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  i do n't get how my * whole * family likes to watch the show . 
  yes , my dad included . 
  shot down those commies well . 
  they gave shelled them with democracy and comments . 
  it was a good day for freedom . 
  forgive me , i am mexican . 
  i can only begin to grasp the concept that is / r/murica . 
  keep on . 
  mras ? 
  there is a speculation on wheter / r/pyongyang are a group of * really * dedicated trolls or * real * people outside n.korea ( for obvious reasons ) that * do * indeed praise and glorify the country and their leader . 
  seems to be the latter , but most like to see it as the former . 
  blasphemy : i caught my entei * while i was surfing *, 
  that was new . 
  did n't knew that . 
  to be honest , i am subscribed to / r/atheism because i saw it as a / r/funny with atheism . 
  turns out , it was meant to be somewhat serious but it caught in a train wreck . 
  it 's a place where you ca n't really discuss , i 've learned so far . 
  i 'll lurk on / r/trueatheism once i have time . 
  technically , yes , because mexico is part of the american continent . 
  now on regarding to being * born * in america , i was born in a border town in mexico . 
  ~ ~ were we are preparing our assault to recover california ~ ~, 
  i am in ur base , making u speak spanish, 
  it does get boring after a while  : |, 
  the * odd * part is that when i visit / r/circlejerk , the line between each sub becomes very thin . 
  what with the sagan worshiping ( ironic ? ), 
  and what not . 
  in fact , i end up enjoying r/circ [ le ] jerk more than / r/atheism  : |, 
  ... and yet , that 's what makes it in the end entertaining . 
  i liked the fact that he did n't want to go `` oh hai gais !, 
  i 'm the hero !!!, 
  and kept hist interest on the energy source . 
  that 's called characterization and they did n't break it . 
  on the villain , though , i was disappointed about the * main * villain but i * loved * how his companion chick . 
  you do n't get to see that sort of ` villainy ' often , specially on disney movies . 
  again , i think i have mixed / r/circlejerk with / r/atheism again . 
  though , / r/atheism has this thing of posting things out of context ... 
  speaking of it , what would happen if / r/circlejerk battled / r/atheism ? 
  i would totally want a re-make of atlantis with a more in-dept story of her . 
  come on !, 
  the rest of the gang had at least * one * talk about their origins , why ca n't she ? 
  maybe she was in it for some other noble cause , only she 's less ` happy ' than the rest of the cast ? 
  she did seem german . 
  \\* shrug \\*, 
  my first language is spanish ( due obvious reasons ) . 
  the closeness to the border has me talking english . 
  i 've learned french at high school and am currently learning japanese and russian on my own . 
  i like learning more languages . 
  it kind of makes me feel more connected to the world . 
  my friend 's got a boyfriend and he hates that dick . 
  she tells me everyday . 
  she wants more * dinero * just to stay on hold, 
  well my friend , you hafta say . 
  i was n't saying communism is bad . 
  it 's ideas are actually a bit more healthier than some of the capitalism that we have . 
  then again , capitalism is n't bad either . 
  it 's how it 's practiced that makes it bad .
