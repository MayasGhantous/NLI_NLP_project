  i assure you that if , in a parallel universe , capitalism exploited 1st world countries like they do on 3rd and communism was exercised with more freedoms and protections , we would be shunning the former . 
  scroll down , boy . 
  there 's already a suggestion of that, 
  yup , but it was all cleared out once / r/murica went into it 's glorious and massive liberation, 
  ~ ~ b-but . 
  . but . 
  b-but . 
  castelia cones are so cheap . 
  will there be some sort of guide that can master science , logic and facebook replies ? 
  or are we going to wait 100 years ? 
  i do remember a proposal pushed onto the californian government that the state should be divided in two parts : the north ( which was mostly white and conservative ) and the south . 
  i think there was also a ` central ' part , ca n't recall . 
  i was baffled and laughed : `` so what ? 
  you 'll have north california and south california ? 
  i thought baja california was enough . 
  so yes , it 's not unheard of conservatives . 
  they are just hidden and quiet . 
  well , i 'm from tijuana . 
  the furthest i 've gone up to cali has been to anaheim for disneyland . 
  heck , father considers going to * downtown * san diego far from my city , but that 's just probably due to the car we have ~ ~ not that stable ~ ~ . 
  so , i 'm not really aware of the conservative ca . 
  i was also under the impression california was * very * liberal and it shocked me when prop 8 passed . 
  pissed me off like never before , but had to hide it from my parents . 
  \u00bf semana santa ? 
  those missiles ca n't even leave asia without japan or s.korea shooting them down . 
  what the heck are they even thinking ? 
  do they live in fantasy land ? 
  are they really that stupid ? 
  i know this is just a provocation for talks or for having those policies revoked but it 's becoming incredibly ridiculous to the point that i just ca n't believe they * still * think we will take them seriously . 
  at * least * throw a pebble over the s.korean border . 
  please . 
  something . 
  or just shut up for good . 
  nobody likes you or loves you , so bug off . 
  i have mine !, 
  lovely little squirtle . 
  i actually pre-ordered both blue rescue and red rescue to have * both * plushies but i only got the squirtle one .

  \u00bf neta se tragan eso de norcorea y su lucha `` anti-imperialista '' ? 
  as somebody who was rejected from nasa for being a bitch , i can confirm this . 
  [ this photo ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/uriminzokkiri/5965846367/in/photostream/ ) photoshop or not , is remarkably well done and it 's beautiful . 
  i shall put it as a wallpaper . 
  it is sad the reality is not the case but one can hope it might . 
  what i did notice is the usage of hdrs and other techniques . 
  i 'm intrigued by the high quality of these pictures and how they assembled them . 
  quite a collection . 
  i 'm quite interested , i can give it a try : d. i have a good level of japanese though i do need to converse with it more . 
  i would love if you could pm me . 
  i can not reveal much information as to prevent any time paradoxes , but here it goes . 
  in the future , the earth has gotten though some socio-political changes which has divided us into three sections , each under a political organization . 
  the federation , which comprises the united states and parts of latin america , england and western asia ( japan , the united republic of korea , the republic of chinese-taipei , singapura ) ; the international alliance of nations which involves nations as russia , china , vietnam , brazil , the republic of the great colombia and guyana , the former arab league that existed on the late xx century towards the xxiii ; and finally the time and space patrol which comprises the former eu lead by france . 
  as you might think , the three sectors of the earth have their languages but a main one too : the federation uses english ( there 's still a disruptive confrontation on whether to use the ` imperial ' or ` federation ' english ) , the ian embraces chinese and persian while the tsp uses french . 
  ( which is a pain , considering i 'm japanese ) . 
  we have established alien contact recently - an event that was hoarded by the * now * galactic federation - and even more recently we were admitted into certain circles among the galaxy ( though we are in probation ) . 
  there have been waves of advances , more so specially to time travel , which the tsp guards with utter care : with it , we have been able to store vital and precise information about past events . 
  history has been written so neither side is shown as a victor but are indeed shown the causes and consequences of some acts . 
  the federation - particularly their lead the united states - has been rather keen in calling this a ` methodical nitpicking ' since they feel they are shown mostly as vile villains , which is n't true really ( though the germans were * still * squirmish about ww2 , despite it being almost 700 years ago ) . 
  this , though , has caused a new kind of crime which involves people obtaining an ` illegal ' ( time machines made by the tsp but ` proxied ' so we can not detect their movements ) tm to try to change certain events or steal certain treasures . 
  the tsp is always working on that . 
  and now , without saying much , i will keep watching on this thread to detect any abnormality . 
  may you know that we are watching . 
  ~ ~ if you wish , ask away.though , i can not tell you much about certain stuff . ~ ~, 
  unfortunately , the code of the tsp withholds me from providing that information . 
  and the answer for your next question is ` no ' . 
  baja california . 
  physics and chemestry ? 
  where can i see this ? 
  [ east prussia would like to have a word with you . ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nemmersdorf_massacre ) . 
  to be honest , [ they went overkill with that region ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metgethen_massacre ) . 
  what 's more , the allies fucked up :, 
  '' * k\u00f6nigsberg , which had never been severely damaged by warfare in its 700 years of existence , was almost completely destroyed by two allied air raids on the night of 26/27 august 1944 and three nights later on the 29/30 august 1944 . 
  winston churchill * ** had erroneously believed it to be `` a modernized heavily defended fortress '' and ordered its destruction ** '', 
  this is why instead of [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:k%c3%b6nigsberg_castle.jpg ) you now have [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:dom_sovetov.jpg ) in it 's place . 
  i 'm not saying that the axis were better , but russia was * really * not something you wanted to encounter . 
  let 's not forget that since russia was on the allied side , it practically skipped free of any reprimand on many of their crimes from even * before * the war ( like the [ holomodor famine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor ) on the early 1930s . 
  not to mention that the americans ( switching topic , poor russians ) took some of the nazi generals ( yes ... those nazi evil doctors and stuff ) to their side for many nasty things . 
  among them , [ project paperclip ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/project_paperclip ) and the slightly more famous [ mk-ultra ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mk-ultra ) . 
  * `` nobody won that war . 
  there were just degrees on how we lost . 
  to think that i lost it all . 
  yup . 
  the russians got a load of nazis too ( i just did n't throw it in due to my post already poking them too hard . ), 
  but yes . 
  * nobody * turned out to be the good guys at the end . 
  wwii sucked and began the lengthy strain of wars that have really no purpose other than to fuck the other . 
  and while it hurts to admit , advances were made thanks to that . 
  . we sure have a way to grow up . 
  that 's the first time i 've heard about it . 
  shit , i have so much to research for a story i 'm doing . 
  this will be an interesting twist . 
  and why do they have to call them `` mk `` something ? 
  could n't they just pick another name that did n't remind me of mcdonalds ? 
  as somebody who is fed up with n.korea on it wanting to show off it 's military and as somebody who somehow wants them to already go to war so they stop existing and there is finally some peace there + reunification , i can only try to imagine what 's up in there . 
  or just , the sad fact that we * need * a war to settle things . 
  forget about the civilians that might die at the war , but the ones dying due the famine , the camps . 
  shocking to realize we still live in a world where we can let that happen all in the name of diplomacy and other interests . 
  dear goddesses !, 
  i would * love * to have a insight on their side of the story . 
  sure , this thing i 'm writing is goddamed * fanfiction * but given the fact that i 'm trying to post on how crude the war was on east prussia , i want to know as much as i can . 
  i 've read some 4 books already on the subject plus some other internet sites and yet the human value is all i 'm missing .
