  i would love to know how was life before , while and after that war . 
  ~ ~ i am crazy , as you can see , for dedicating myself too much in a work of fiction ~ ~, 
  i 've read that before . 
  it 's rather haunting . 
  i did post that i would like there to be a war breaking in so this whole mess ends but , it 's just so complicated . 
  there is n't really a solution to this and it 's so heartbreaking given what these people have to go day by day ... 
  all of the government of mexico and their political parties . 
  fuck all of them . 
  fuck them all . 
  buster gold is ** definitively ** not underrated . 
  he 's the best one around . 
  sleep . 
  why not ? 
  they told me that sleeping too much is being lazy . 
  well , * now * who 's going to tell me so ? 
  er . . yes ... 
  no , what i meant was mostly the mobilizations and the overall ambiance of the place . 
  perhaps i 'm asking too much . 
  i just got excited . 
  forgive me . 
  edit : i just realized to the incorrect post . 
  disregard this . 
  baja california . '', 
  en la intersecci\u00f3n de monterrey y baja california , '', 
  yup , sadly this is very true . 
  such a sad end for a great and respectable nation . 
  i was about 13 when i got my first nokia . 
  it was a [ small blue brick ] ( http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_6150-10.php ) . 
  i barely used it since it was only to call my parents to pick me up and stuff . 
  i have n't used another brand but nokia : those phones * do * last . 
  metroid other m. 
  what baffles me is that this was a game that was made * by one * of the creators . 
  yokoi must be wondering wtf . 
  also , the whole `` oh , btw , the prime series is n't canon . '', 
  from him . 
  i do n't consider mom canonical : /, 
  i mean , the game is n't so bad , had some interesting plot but to line it up with the whole metroid universe . 
  . it just does n't fit . 
  shame on you mr. sakamoto . 
  try again , and this time do some research on your * own * work . 
  `` i do n't know . 
  . that picture looks photoshoped '', 
  uprising by muse, 
  pokemon blue . 
  yes , i still play . 
  i need trading friends . 
  i received the label but there are n't programs like that around where i live . 
  before i could talk properly , i could read the licence plate numbers and point and tell the brands of the cars that passed by . 
  by age 5 i knew how to multiply and divide up to 12 . 
  most of the time i spent at school was learning things on my own , like other languages ( particularly japanese ) , history or chemistry . 
  i graduated without honors from my university ( with an 89 ) , mostly because i did n't really put any interest . 
  the way they thought did n't perk my interest and i was just shamelessly playing pokemon games * while * at class or drawing . 
  on the bad things of being `` gifted '' ( though i 'm not sure if i do qualify under that label , seeing the other comments here ) , is that - at least here - it 's hard to get a job . 
  i 've been rejected far too many times with the `` you 're overqualified '' tag that it really made me depressed . 
  so , a lesson here : being smart does n't mean success nor success means being smart . 
  ** killer instinct **, 
  and they said i was crazy for keeping my old celphones in a box . 
  let 's see who 'll be crazy when i protect the world with my finnish scrap !, 
  i suppose that between dead or castration , castration was better . 
  and yet they still wanted to kill them : /, 
  i would like to help you thought there might have some delay . 
  if you are interested , pm me for more info . 
  awesome !, 
  i think i now have a project to work on : d, 
  willing to do this !, 
  pm me to send you a postcard from tijuana : d, 
  i have a small netbook which i can clean up and send it up to you if you are interested . 
  i 'll have to see , though , if my mother will no longer use it . 
  it 's about 2 years old but i 'm sure that with a clean install it 'll run as new . 
  originally i said `` photoshopped '' but then i think i half-way corrected it . 
  that 's true . 
  i had forgotten about that . 
  i was thinking on excadrill actually . 
  though i do n't know who to substitute on that list . 
  maybe grumpig ... 
  i only have a question : where did you get it ? 
  it 's sold out ; n ;, 
  is there a chance they 'll still be producing them ? 
  i do n't want to go to e-bay or hope my chance at comic-con ... 
  i do n't even have tickets for it ; _ ;, 
  how much was it on the other page ? 
  it was in yen . 
  in usd how much is it ? 
  ( on ipod , ca n't do much here ; ; ), 
  dear goddesses . . . 
  i 'll have to wait then . 
  hopefully , there will be a re-issue . 
  but , on the other figurine , i wonder if it 's 60 + postage or it 's significantly lower . 
  i 'll check my options here ... 
  got ta get them all . 
  i 'm tempted to just start collecting figures . 
  i knew that was going to happen sooner or later . 
  as always , the best answer to all questions . 
  ~ ~ after 42 of course ~ ~, 
  < unjerk  about a year or 2 , not sure , [ circuit city ] ( http://www.tigerdirect.com/sectors/opt-outv2.asp?site=cc ) [ went bankrupt ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/circuit_city#bankruptcy_and_liquidation ) . 
  thus , they closed all the stores . 
  only 90s kids remember this . 
  we mexicans * love * canadians and i 'm sure that if the us was n't in the middle , we 'd go and give you hugs more frequently . 
  also , we tend to think that canada is covered in snow 3/4 of the time . 
  nothing about polar bears , though .
