  heck , even that fire starter looks like a fire/fight type . 
  intriguing design on the feraligator-like serpent . 
  i remember when people bitched and moaned when they announced deoxys on gen iii , on how this was * another * mewtwo , but from space . 
  the fact that this reminds me of deoxys kind of makes me think they are running out of options or ideas . 
  i mean , if you * really * wanted to make him cool , why not give him back his armor ? 
  he looked badass like that . 
  venasaur would like to have a word with you . 
  i like the concept of grass/ghost however . 
  rather awesome . 
  it 's ok . 
  hmm , an * offensive * physical grass/poison ( i 'm pretty sure the ones we have are either defensive or special offensive ) . 
  i could go behind that idea . 
  snow storm . 
  . in july ? 
  like . 
  july , when there is supposed to be sun and we are dying of how hot it is ? 
  dear goddesses . 
  and tacos too . 
  ~ ~ the knives are a compliment . ~ ~, 
  i 'll see you soon . 
  \\* smiles \\*, 
  a bicycle . 
  i have wanted to but the streets in my city are shit . 
  i wan na go to sleep already . 
  doing the same buddy . 
  high five . 
  just give me a moment and i 'll tell you . 
  as a mexican , i can confirm that we do n't give a fuck . 
  then again , how can you when we have the most retarded president on the world ? 
  oh , and he 's actually on his way to some sort of meeting in china-japan . 
  might escalate or not but for the most of the time , we really do n't care . 
  when it comes to sports ... do n't mess with us . 
  ~ ~ and do n't act like the vancouver riots are nothing ~ ~, 
  if you thought that theme was awesome , take a look at the [ japanese version ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rsw4xl5qfs ) . 
  why ca n't we have cartoons with intros as epic as these ? 
  you barely have anything close to a guitar on a cartoon intro anymore : /, 
  why was season 2 cancelled though ? 
  xddd, 
  in spanish , it goes like this :, 
  ( translated to english of course ), 
  mama had a chicken, 
  mama had a cow, 
  when papa adopted us ( both ) , mama blacked out . 
  that show was fucking weird . 
  when is the 3rd season due out ? 
  is it already out ? 
  coming soon to a future near you . 
  ffffffffffffff -, 
  too * violent * ? 
  really ? 
  so , i suppose kiddy sugaring everything into stupidity is the best option . 
  and it was n't nonesense violence , it had a ** plot ** which was sort of rare in cartoons anyways . 
  i hate these decisions but oh well . 
  it 's the same anyways : p, 
  you get the idea . 
  in live action/cgi that is airing currently '', 
  ** where ?!, 
  that 's because you are nice and patient people with us : d, 
  do onto others what they do onto you = v = b, 
  some 5 tops from more than a thousand that come here . 
  ~ ~ and to be honest , i 'm pretty sure none of them knew they were canadians ~ ~, 
  it 's not really that bad . 
  the economy is bad and our government is shit . 
  it 's obvious you 'll get to see something like that . 
  but in overall , we love you all . 
  hmm , seems interesting . 
  if the weather is too hot , do you get discomfort from it ? 
  i do n't like the whole idea of underwear clothing ( besides the obvious one ) due to feeling too tightly wrapped , not to mention the obvious sweat factor . 
  our police is stupid , unable to do anything . 
  in our news , there 's always some guy presented to the media part of some sort of cartel when in reality he was just some old bloke caught by the police to show off as how they are really stopping crime . 
  it 's a hoax that 's kept up by the media in mexico . 
  the media in mexico ( particularly under televisa ) is so strong it 's able to decide what to show , and who to put in charge ( our current president is thanks to that . ), 
  it 's ridiculous and just now people are coming to realize . 
  sadly , the whole cartel thing wo n't stop unless we push out the corrupted from the root and have the us legalize drugs . 
  there are many issues but those are the two that come in mind . 
  \\* super ultra hug \\*, 
  i know that feeling bro . 
  i agree . 
  awesome racing + epic guitar riffs/music ? 
  sign me in !, 
  i wanted to see a new f-zero in the wii but i was disappointed there was n't any . 
  maybe in the wii-u ? 
   then the iphone 6s 3 weeks after it . 
  ftfy, 
  i used to check 9gag and post funny pictures to my friends . 
  one day , my so notices where the link comes from and rants at me of how 9gag are a bunch of karma whores that steal oc for their site . 
  at first , i did n't give a fuck , for i was just for the funnies . 
  however , after a while , she kind of forced me to get into reddit . 
  i have never regretted it and never looked back at 9gag . 
  though , tbh , it 's outstanding how reddit steals content from itself . 
  that would be saint seiya and batman the animated series . 
  the first in latin spanish and the other in english . 
  mexican here . 
  we only have 1 fuck to give and that ai n't going to n.korea, 
  we are only hoping that since our president is in china/japan/asia , if they do indeed decide to attack , the missile strikes him . 
  we 'd later make that a national holiday . 
  it 's a tour name by the english band muse . 
  ~ ~ i wish i could go to one of their concerts . ~ ~, 
  no , in reality , it 's a supposed machine that can [ change the weather ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high_frequency_active_auroral_research_program ) . 
  i was going to go to their san diego gig but i had no money .
