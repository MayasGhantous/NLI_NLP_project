  ~ ~ i hate you now , random redditor . 
  i shall kill you in your sleep ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ did i say murder ? 
  i meant torture you until you * beg * me to kill you . 
  . or you get me tickets to the next gig ~ ~, 
  ^ _ ^ that 's nice . 
  must have been a radio promo or something . 
  i tried that , but no luck sadly . 
  i actually wanted to get the tickets from the pre-sale on october but , again , i had no money . 
  it 's what happens when you are unemployed . 
  i * did * ask my father a favor but . 
  forgot . 
  ~ ~ now he is no longer able to forget . 
  . try to guess why . 
  . that 's right !, 
  because he has a notepad !, 
  what ? 
  you thought i killed him too ? ~ ~, 
  you know you are wrong up when fidel ` the inmortal ' castro tells you to chill the fuck up . 
  i hope n. korea gets the memo . 
  one might have their sides with fidel but he 's a veteran at this . 
  he was in a conflict where 2 superpowers * actually * wanted to nuke the shit out of each other . 
  on the other hand , iran is acting stupidly . 
  what about his armor * and * his spoon ? 
  ~ ~ ** exactly ** ~ ~, 
  no , just ... here , saying . 
  since pokemon advetures pretty much matched the anime!mewtwo with it 's on , why not match a bit of the manga!mewtwo and give him his spoon ? 
  `` i have awakened my ultimate power . 
  now , where the * fuck * is my spoon ? '', 
  you must like office depot . 
  that 's why we hate you . 
  down with you !,

  this is unexpected . 
  thanks !, 
  now * that * is a good alter forme . 
  not that . 
  . what ever that 's being promoted . 
  but fuck yes !, 
  ~ ~ you forgot to add the book of revelations 4:17 -26 ~ ~, 
  shoot me a pm with the details : d, 
  i ** wanted ** them to see them . 
  i cried deeply when i could n't see them . 
  i just did n't have the money . 
  by that time it was my 2nd year unemployed . 
  i had a bit more of things to get worried off . 
  i did ask my father as a favor if he could buy me a ticket on a pre-sale on october . 
  would have been a nice b-day gift ( since it 's in november ) . 
  he forgot . 
  that person must have been retarded republifundie . 
  good for you , you made this country proud . 
  now at 19.99 plus tax . 
  i was 5 and biking without care in the world . 
  i was passing by a house that had ** 4 rottweilers ** barking at me , on the front yard , their leashes held under the wheel of a suv . 
  i stopped and began to back up but the owner told me it was fine , so i trusted him . 
  so i continue my journey when suddenly , i have no idea how , * all 4 * got their leash snapped from under the wheel ( more likely tugged enough to have them slipped ) and began chasing me . 
  i pedaled as much as i could but since this was rough ground , i ended up ditching the bike and running away . 
  they pounced me and were about to attack when the owner ran to me to rescue . 
  i swear , i could feel one of the dog 's teeth close to my buttocks as it grabbed my short . 
  it took me 7 years to pass by that place again ( even if there were n't any dogs ) and up to this day i hate ( or am afraid ) of dogs . 
  ~ ~ you mean there are * other * uses for incognito mode ? ~ ~, 
  in all seriousness , i use it to access twitter , reddit and other web pages i need to log in when i am using somebody else 's computer ( father 's , work computer , etc ) . 
  i just do n't like people knowing what i 'm browsing . 
  my first language is spanish . 
  i think in english . 
  i have no idea why . 
  i live in mexico . 
  i 'm usually a chill girl , but when i 'm at my breaking point ~ ~ i like to go and behead people ~ ~ i usually will cry and trash at you or - if possible - just go to sleep it out . 
  then go back to be happy again . 
  in my last job i did n't get fired but i had been hired for 3 months . 
  how it works around the place i live is that they give you a contract for 3 months and once you finish it , the company may or may not hire you . 
  the reason i was n't hired for a longer period was , in short , because i was weird . 
  though , the real reason was because i pointed out certain flaws on the quality systems they were managing . 
  pretty much dodging some duties to do less work when the system required them to follow the steps accordingly . 
  other crimes seem to be the fact that i sat with japanese people ( this is a manufacturing company ) instead with . 
  . well , `` my '' people . 
  ( according to a co-worker at least ) . 
  i learned more japanese in that 3 month span than on my own for a year . 
  but the reason according to my boss is that `` we wo n't have as much need for more workforce '' and that i was a bit weird . 
  uncooked maruchan soup/noodles can be glorious, 
  gaia online , of all places . 
  more interestingly : i had left it for a year and just came back out of curiosity/boredom . 
  i met her on one of those `` towns '' and i ranted on how bad the people there rp 'd and went on cybering . 
  without knowing , now that i think of it , it was love at first sight . 
  it is confirmed as fake already ? 
  phew = v = ; ; ;, 
  according to the official sources , this is * not * mewtwo per-se , but * looks * like him . 
  that he has a ` conexion ' . 
  guys . 
  is this the legendary mewthree ? 
  after so long of poke-fan raving . 
  did game freak actually deliver but the fanbase say `` nope '' ? 
  odd ... 
  i have traveled across the land , searching far and wide, 
  let 's think on this :, 
  * mewtwo 's the first successful living ( who knows how alive porygon and others are ) pokemon created by humans . 
  * they used tanks on the process . 
  ( as with genesect ), 
  * whether the anime canon can indeed match the games and/or manga , one thing is sure : team plasma * must * have learned to do this somewhere else to create genesect .
