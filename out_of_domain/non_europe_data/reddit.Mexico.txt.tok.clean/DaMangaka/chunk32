  ** postales **, 
  * meanwhile in le eua *, 
  la dhl y estafeta son bien caros la neta . 
  yup , in fact using wood or other construction material that is n't brick is seen as unreliable and cheap . 
  though , since concrete is a bit more expensive lately , that is one of the reasons why there are so many unfinished things . 
  also money issues or the fact that something came up and you had to flee . 
  but yes , i 've seen them around where i live too . 
  looking it from the computer myself . 
  no sign of `` eclair '' . 
  these things are usually written in katakana and none of what i see points to eclair . 
  this poster is a `` present guide '' . 
  i suppose to what they are to expect from this mewtwo they 'll give out on the movies . 
  ruin : a new type or changing drastically some key gameplay ( ` bonding ' or what ever instead of friendship evolution , no bike ) , a bad soundtrack and story plot . 
  better : make `` move '' the first option when using the `` bill 's pc '' box option . 
  have us have more option of wordings a la r/s/e for mail and chat . 
  return the berries and have a better pokemon contest a la r/s/e . 
  heck , many of the gen iii features , if returned , would make gen vi very epic . 
  according to the official movie site , they are indicating that this is the same mewtwo from `` mewtwo gyakkushu '' ( mewtwo 's strikes back ) . 
  one of the things they also are pointing out is that he 'll awaken his `` true power '' . 
  hmm ... 
  i 'm thankful most of these pokemon things have furigana at the top of them so i can read . 
  nevertheless , foreign words use katakana ( which i can read too ) and i have n't found any that spells close to ` eclair ' . 
  speaking of the war on drugs , from your perspective , what must mexico do on our side to help the war end ? 
  i 'm not meaning just the battle against marijuana and others of the kind , but the system brought with it . 
  i would like your insight on that . 
  seems i can give it a shot . 
  i 've sent you a pm with samples . 
  this seems really cool !, 
  my sister and i have been poking on how to make something like that but we really do n't have the whole set to do so ( for starters , a good camera ) . 
  i 'm definitively interested though . 
  and this is why i build my computer from scratch . 
  i hear you . 
  a friend of mine wanted to program for mac but alas . 
  you can not unless you * have * a mac . 
  he ended up buying one . 
  i 'm sure he 's happy with it but i think the need of programming was what pushed him into there . 
  as for myself , i 'm a graphic designer . 
  i shall never touch a mac so long as i can . 
  linux and windows can work marvels if you know how . 
  rip : (, 
  i once had a meeting with some friends to do some school work . 
  it was an animation made on flash ( and for anyone that does n't know , flash tends to be a bitch and go `` lol , frozen '' at random times . 
  so by that time we compulsorily pressed ctrl + s ) . 
  my 4 friends , with their shiny new macbook pro . 
  me , my 6 year old custom-made windows pc . 
  so we begin working on our parts of the project and the macs seem to have * more * trouble with flash than myself , not to mention that it seems even * slower * than in my own comp which at the time had 1gb of ram . 
  in the end , i finish up my part first . 
  we compiled the final animation on * my * computer . 
  that 6 year old thing . 
  less than a year later , one of their macs crashed and died for some reason . 
  of course , they have their warranty , but my pc lasted * 10 freaking years * before it became too obsolete to keep on working and had to replace it with another computer . 
  it still can kick ass but you * do * feel the age of it . 
  your mac would lick my pc 's drives boy . 
  a computer brand does n't make it better : it 's what and how you do it . 
  \\* dealwithit.jpg \\*, 
  dae staples is better ? 
  black ? 
  is windows 8 * really * that good ? 
  i have my doubts on the gui . 
  kind of confusing . 
  then again , my phone has sort of the same . 
  i do n't want to update unless it 's necessary . 
  i have windows 7 ,, 
  they talk intelligently and do n't go into judging on quickly . 
  they always look on both perspectives to give a final result . 
  this will end up in a long debate with this person , perhaps , but this also means i am interested in you and i 'm awed . 
  the . 
  . six-dollar burger was a meme ? 
  hmm , good point . 
  i do have to admit that most pcs sold on retail are really iffy and you need to wisen up on what to buy or not . 
  sometimes the price of a pc is n't good in comparison to what it offers you . 
  so i guess this is why a mac is a better option : why go around looking for specs and all that mumble jumble when you know a mac has all that by default . 
  no need to look between price/value , mac is a secure way to go . 
  i only wish ubuntu could have more compatible programs instead of me having to use wine . 
  only reason why i do n't switch out windows . 
  the only * real * thing i hate is their mouse . 
  mouse !, 
  get me a mouse with a 3rd wheel !, 
  how ca n't they ? 
  how do you right cli - . 
  you ca n't ?!, 
  what ? 
  \\* fliptable.jpg \\*, 
  perhaps because it 's `` so natural '' you 'd believe everything would be windows compatible . 
  \\* shrug \\*, 
  no , just the . 
  regular mouse . 
  a mouse . 
  apple mouses are fucking weird to me : p, 
  to be honest , my university was what killed my apple fad . 
  not that i ever had one but to be the one kid on a classroom full of apple laptops just because i could n't afford one sucked . 
  ( mind you , this laptop was forcefully borrowed from my dad ) . 
  but , eventually that led to teach me that there are quite some advantages for that . 
  for example , the adobe master suite was free if you catch my drift . 
  ~ ~ i also like to use comic sans , thought mostly that 's to piss off designers . 
  never use it for real works though ~ ~, 
  this is the thing about putin : he 's your typical russian bad guy . 
  you hate him , or rather , you * want * to hate him . 
  thing is , with stuff like this . 
  you ca n't .
