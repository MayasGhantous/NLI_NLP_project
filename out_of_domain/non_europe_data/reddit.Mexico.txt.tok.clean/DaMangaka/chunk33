  it 's like he came out of some comic-book world . 
  a russian lex lutor or something like that . 
  he can be a dick , but he 's an epic dick . 
  and he 's there to be hated , because none can take the hate like putin . 
  live on . 
  but it 's * so * rewarding . 
  sometimes , it 's not even in . 
  stop it reddit !!, 
  stop making me want to spend money on things !, 
  yes !, 
  team rocket fuck yeah !, 
  i hate doing that . 
  i usually end up writing stupid things . 
  coocoo kola and aurora inc. 
  alone : (, 
  or worse . 
  . forgotten . 
  a little bit of stress is good , but too much makes me want to kill people . 
  holy shit !, 
  this just made my day for some reason . 
  why is this guy so fucking likeable ? 
  ~ ~ stop doing that !, 
  i want to hate you ! ~ ~, 
  pfth . 
  you wish . 
  just putting out to not worship a brand . 
  yes , many did too . 
  but i remember they had quite a hard time to find copies . 
  things in asterisks denote an action . 
  kind of like roleplaying but irl ( of course , you ca n't but . . it 's the closest you can be with that person at the moment . ), 
  so , for example , at that time he put '' \\* buys a computer \\* '' he was ` presenting ' you an imaginary computer to show support . 
  it 's kind of cute . 
  works very well for ldrs too : p, 
  \\* bows down \\*, 
  i do n't exactly * have * a portfolio . 
  i 'm working on it . 
  also , it 's . 
  pretty much what you get here atm . 
  there was a mod post about how now just to throw `` hai !, 
  pm 'd '' but . 
  take it !!, 
  take all my karma !, 
  quickly !, 
  not only in furry but in anime or bbc code forums . 
  ldr means `` long distance relationship '' . 
  you can now see how \\* < action  \\* can be useful since sadly they ca n't be together but at least they can ` play ' as such : p, 
  telmex would like a word with you, 
  according to the constitution , casinos and betting houses are not legal . 
  yet there are . . . 
  a lot lately . 
  about the tv and if you are german , [ take a look at this ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/enrique-pena-nieto-gewinnt-praesidentschaftswahl-in-mexiko-a-842004.html ), 
  the sad reality is , as you say , it 's the only open ( there are other channels , of course but those are via cable and not many can afford it ) tv channels available . 
  now you can see why the population will believe anything and do nothing : /, 
   billy mays, 
  ftfy, 
  usually ircs follow this command . 
  why take it out form the steam chat ? 
  `` dive inside the karma pool all ! '', 
  - your mom, 
   this literally, 
  ftfy, 
  it always has to be ruined either by scamers or trolls . 
  sad : |, 
  ~ ~ then again , i barely chatted via steam ... ~ ~, 
  i knew it before i knew, 
  nothing really . 
  perhaps just stock some goodies just in case . 
  and also prepare my most important documents to be in a easy-to-grab-n-carry bin . 
  you never know . 
  today i woke up to a dream in which i saw a big flash at the horizon , people and buildings literately melting and me trying to run away . 
  i need to stop visiting / r/northkoreanews . 
  is it female ? 
  you did a great job in saving another poor soul from the evil of other `` office '' chains . 
  i say `` office '' because only staples can sell true office supplies . 
  from all of us , thank you . 
  ~ ~ i want a shiny one ~ ~, 
  awesome !, 
  thanks !, 
  hands down on mewtwo . 
  he 's the most awesome of them all . 
  also , it 'd be a companion to talk with . 
  needs more explosions, 
  not to mention they had to save italy . 
  . again, 
  half of the troops went down to save the italian army from greece ( i think ) . 
  by the time they finished there and arrived to russia . 
  `` oh shit , it 's snowing . 
  ffffffffff - '', 
  i do n't think that applies to me , your honor . 
  you see , i am a pigeon and thus you should fear me . 
  i 'll just block them . 
  i do n't usually give my facebook to anybody unless i know them and if they do end up with it , if i do n't recognize you from anywhere ( irl or nets ) , i 'll just ignore you . 
  and if you * do * make advances even if i know you , you 'll end up block 'd . 
  sorry guys . 
  despite my efforts and all to * not * draw on paper , i ca n't start any artwork unless i do it by hand . 
  i have a tablet and i still find it utterly hard to make drawings on the computer . 
  paper + pencil/pen ftw, 
  i do n't like prepackaged food . 
  i avoid it like a plague . 
  sometimes i buy it to taste and try to discover the flavors and later on i attempt to do my version with fresh ingredients .
