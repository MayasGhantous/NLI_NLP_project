  it always works best when one do it . 
  spending all of the money from my first job instead of saving it for something better . 
  i thought jobs could last longer . 
  i want to go 700 years in the future so i can make a story that 's supposed to be set on that time as close to ` reality ' as possible . 
  wtf ?!, 
  is that even real ? 
  how the . 
  : / i mean . 
  . i do n't have time . 
  you just do n't suddenly jump in and say `` hai !, 
  hmmmm ... nope t _ t < - my current experience with some guy i actually met irl and had to block several times on msn * and * facebook . 
  maybe i wo n't block you but . 
  for the love of the goddesses , do n't look too desperate . 
  try to at * least * let me know you better and be friends and stuff . 
  ~ ~ then again , i also have a girlfriend ~ ~, 
  yeah . 
  it 's a long and complicated story . 
  and this is a guy that i met irl , worse of all . 
  i suppose that in all things you should know that do n't do things online as you would irl . 
  really . 
  do n't . 
  just because you are veiled on the internets does n't mean you can go on and do stupid things . 
  i know it has nothing to do with the whole thing but , your taco comparison made me realize why i am not a fan of my mother 's food . 
  it 's always the same : |, 
  ~ ~ also , when i play the sims , i make my sims die in the most funny/awesome/hilarious way possible ... so maybe if god exists he * might * be an asshole ~ ~, 
  you know , they could have been * logical * and use methods to deduct the distance of the gap ( to see if it was possible to get jumped across ) , device what is the better way get to that other side and finally , teach others how to do so . 
  but no , they had to be retards and just jump even * after * 2 or 3 guys * fell * down . 
  heck , that ` know-it-all ' guy could have at least thought for a moment and go `` welp , i 'll need some math and science on this one '' . 
  i have pokedolls too , but your collection outmatches mine ; w ;, 
  i want more dolls < 3, 
  you * can * do that from the wii . 
  you need to go to settings and then go to memory option ( do n't remember the exact name in the gui ) . 
  there , you can administer your saves from both the wii and the memory card you have attached there . 
  hope it helps : d, 
  once in pokemon blue . 
  it was on mewtwo , way before i knew about missigno . 
  nevertheless , i was n't disapointed . 
  ~ ~ i am highly interested on these things . 
  if you want , pm me to see what i can grab ~ ~, 
  you can always make a post on places like / r/randomkindness or / r/assistance offering these things , make a garage sale ~ ~ or build a super awesome mecha ~ ~, 
  as for myself , ~ ~ i would build a sonic death beam ~ ~ i would see what i can do with them . 
  hmm , maybe you can still ask for help in / r/assistance to see somebody from your area to help you get rid of all the stuff . 
  or you can take them to goodwill and just toss them there . 
  holy shit . 
  i think this just solved the situation, 
  i always wondered about the science behind why ant 's can cross chalk lines . 
  also on how flies are kept outside just by hanging plastic bags with water . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovg6xhku_eo ), 
  due to the war of drugs , everyone thinks tijuana is some sort of shithole where there are tons of drugdealers , rampant violence , prostitutes ... 
  think of it as a real life gta with more guns , decapitations and all those sort of things . 
  also , that just walking by you can get mauled , kidnapped or killed . 
  while it is true that around 2007-2009 it was pretty heavy on violence it really did n't escalate * that * much to the level of ciudad juarez ( for example ) and right now it 's pretty chill and quiet . 
  only gang members kill each other here and the food is delicious . 
  seriously , there 's this new trend were artists are arriving and it 's changing the city for the better . 
  ~ ~ so plz , come visit us . ~ ~, 
  does the belief on arceus count ? 
  i would n't mind polygamous marriages . 
  the difficulty , though , would be on certain ` juridical ' problems such as taxes , insurances , laws and other things that can make things more complicated . 
  before they can make it a reality , they 'll have to think on the broad spectrum of what it means and the consequences ( good , bad , difficult ) that this would take . 
  [ frozen frutsis ] ( http://img.terra.com.mx/galeria_de_fotos/images/375/748723.jpg ), 
  blast to the past there . 
  on smells , there 's this brand of make-up called [ maja ] ( http://images01.olx.com.pe/ui/5/24/24/1269275816_82192024_3-vendo-perfume-maja-ropa-accesorios-1269275816.jpg ) that my grand mother still uses . 
  when ever i smell it , it takes me back to the times i used to explore under her bed and run along the city she lives in . 
  posting to follow this thread . 
  i 'm interested . 
  ~ ~ anyone from kaliningrad here ? ~ ~, 
  i have only used flash so far for my animations , but i might make a combination of traditional + premier pro + after effects . 
  ~ ~ it sounds complicated , right ? 
  but it 's more when flash likes to suicide every 5 minutes ~ ~, 
  wtf ? 
  crocs . 
  why . 
  . why do they wear them ? 
  and who the heck created those things ? 
  also , i hate the trend of aeropostale-like shirts that are as thin as paper and yet costs you like 20-40 usd . 
  seriously guys ? 
  why ? 
  i do n't care about any tv shows right now , so i suppose i 'm in the same boat as you . 
  there are much more interesting things on the internet anyways . 
  boil some water , pour them so they are a little above the noddles and let them rest for at least 5 to 10 minutes . 
  then , i add some lime . 
  i drink first the soup and then the noddles . 
  delish . 
  i ** hate ** leftovers . 
  my hate does n't stem from the leftovers themselves but the cause and the aftermath of them . 
  the cause is that my family cooks too much food . 
  food that they wo n't eat later because we like food to be ` fresh ' ( nothing bad on that ) . 
  thing is , these `` leftovers '' eventually become spoilers and end up bagged on the freezer where every wednesday we have to wake up before 6 am so we beat the trash collector , grab the bags and put them on the bins outside before they collect . 
  if we do n't do that , that 's a whole week of frozen spoiled food . 
  all while we make * more * leftovers . 
  when i cook i measure * exactly * what i 'll eat to avoid all of this . 
  it 's best for me to have them eat it all and remain wanting more than cooking too much and leaving spoilers . 
  as scary as it is , i would have loved to be in the 60s student movements . 
  how about tonight ? 
  preeeeeeetty much . 
  and it pisses me to no end . 
  pokemon , but make it like the pokemon adventures manga . 
  wrong sub buddy . 
  you 'll want to try / r/circlejerk, 
  they ** better ** be there by 2015 or else , i might just start a riot on mattel .
