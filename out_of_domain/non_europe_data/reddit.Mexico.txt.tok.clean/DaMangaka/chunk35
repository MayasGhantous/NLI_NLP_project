  filler classes . 
  these subjects that they teach you at school which are pointless for what you 're supposed to do at work . 
  philosophy in my graphic design curricula ? 
  i would n't be bothered if it was n't because teachers grade you * based on a book * than actually making you critical thinkers . 
  also , the fact that you might have quite a lean year and then , 2 weeks before the semester ends '' ** omgad maek final projects !!!, 
  it 's 30 % of yer grade lolololololol ** '', 
  endless nights were spent . 
  weight lifting . 
  i used to work at ~ ~ sony ~ ~ foxconn here in my city and i can tell you that the price might be in part of the components to make the television . 
  to settle all those little leds comfortably so that you have a neat picture but also does n't get all crumbled and jammed ( as to make the tv thinner and less bulky ) it takes different types of lighting source ( most use mercury ) and positioning , not to mention that the smaller the leds , the more expensive . 
  then you have the import/export fee and the whole packaging . 
  tl ; dr : your tv is more expensive the bigger it is due to the ` difficulty ' that it can be presented when assembling the components so you do n't get a lesser quality picture . 
  think of shrinking-expanding a jpeg . 
  we do n't want that , so more money is invested .

  comic-con             my birthday . 
  and really , after i was 18 years old , my birthday sort of became `` happy ` you 're an adult now !, 
  you have a lot of responsibilities ! ' '', 
  i celebrate on my own and some friends . 
  with food . 
  i have n't eaten yet and i puked . 
  another mexican here . 
  if it was * utterly * necessary to fight for my country , i would . 
  but * not * in the army . 
  i would avoid draft like hellfire . 
  also , good thing about mexico and it 's doctrina estrada is that we do n't meddle in other people 's affairs . 
  we are chill . 
  take chances . 
  make mistakes . 
  until you begin throwing blue shells or red shells in battle mode . 
  then suddenly it becomes murderous and you stop having friends ... 
  fear me !!!, 
  for i am the goddess of . 
  i think i forgot . 
  mexico : like crap . 
  on both local and international outlets i 've seen . 
  nice try fbi, 
  i 'm a mexican . 
  neither would be considered mexican food . 
  but if i had to choose , i 'd go with chipotle . 
  til this is the national anthem of s [ weed ] en, 
  seems you need a laptop . 
  i have an old cpu in pristine condition . 
  serviced me well for around 9 years and even now it can work with powerhouse programs such as photoshop and the adobe master suite . 
  if you need it for lesser programs , it can give you quite a help . 
  dunno if you are interested . 
  it 's a bit bulky though . 
  my ` main base ' is anime style drawings , though i wish to widen my styles to embrace american comic-style and ultimately real life . 
  i can do in between but never full or something i could call ` omg epic ' . 
  still , i keep pushing and practicing . 
  [ this is one of my latest works . 
  alright . 
  [ here comes a little thing i did with crayola crayons . 
  i want to learn to use markers ( hence why most of my wishlist is copic ) but i tend to use prismacolors . 
  i also work with the computer using a combination of photoshop + illustrator . 
  but , when i compare certain works , i have to admit nothing defeats things done by hand . 
  [ a little something for my facebook ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wryju.png ), 
  backgrounds that i use are usually landscapes , cities . 
  most of my stories are settled in modern urban places so that 's what i use . 
  for general drawings , i go simple : either [ one color ] ( http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2013/041/0/c/torrent_of_love_by_gslucky-d5ujn65.png ) , or [ transparent/no background ] ( http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/354/4/8/48742e2e1ac2f4ebe14260903172e4f1-d5oo23y.jpg ) . 
  though , i can [ get quite excited ] ( http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs21/i/2007/281/5/d/_mythical_magical_knights__by_gslucky.png ), 
  i 'd be at home drawing or continuing to write that ~ ~ fanfiction ~ ~ story of mine . 
  it will be long and if i keep procrastinating i think it 'll become to irrelevant to publish . 
  right now i 'm at work , starving . 
  stupid food delivery person must have gotten lost . 
  . . * again *, 
  i enjoy european and mexican cinema . 
  on the mexican , the more cynical , the better . 
  perhaps it 's just my like for `` herod 's law '' but yeah . 
  i do also enjoy anime movies though most of the time i must be aware of the series it comes from or else i 'll just go ` buh ? ', 
  currently waiting for the next pokemon film !, 
  mewtwo 's in it !, 
  \\* wiggles \\* mai face !!!, 
  crime and punishment . 
  currently reading the biography of peter the great for a fanfiction i 'm making . 
  i 'm already * loving * it, 
  yeah , that 24 box crayon box thingy . 
  my sister and a ` cousin ' ( more like the daughter of the daughter of an ex-neighbor of ours ) were painting over some preview manga thingies that you get at conventions with crayons ( akin to coloring books ) . 
  i saw them and decided to make a sketch . 
  . wait . 
  i love ~ ~ though it 's a curse too ~ ~ that i can get quite imaginative . 
  leave me alone in a room with some music and i can transform it in my mind into something epic . 
  though , that also means that when i get * too * depressed , i might end up battling my own demons quite literately . 
  ~ ~ that 's why i tend to close my room at night . 
  why , hi there = v = b, 
  it takes time but it 's worth it . 
  i learned by reading some tutorials on deviantart . 
  the key here is to not press too hard the pencils while shading , so as you leave ` space ' for the other colors to blend in . 
  also , always . 
  . always use white at the end for highlights , not before . 
  \\* cue music \\*, 
  my family is always pushing for me to get out but . 
  . really , i do n't want to . 
  not when i 'm working . 
  i 'll get out if they get out of the house since i 'll move a lot , play loud music and perhaps trash the house . 
  i am an artist !, 
  t at /, 
  < unjerk  yup , he was . 
  thanks to him i began to love chemestry and physics as a small kid . 
  still love them ~ ~ except vectorials .
