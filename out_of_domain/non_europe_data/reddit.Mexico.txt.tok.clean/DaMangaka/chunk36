  i 'll post a picture later but , technically think about [ something like this ] ( http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/i/31waobq3%2bnl._sy300_.jpg ) . 
  slightly bigger than your regular desktop powers of this era and with a lot of space inside . 
  has slots for 3 hds more ( up to 2tbs each i think , i remember putting 1tb extra which i have now moved to my new desktop ) , 2 gb ram ( up to 4 gb of ddr ram ) and i can clean it up so it can run windows xp sp 3 or ubuntu linux if you prefer . 
  if you need some other programs , i can also install them with instructions as how to keep them ~ ~ let 's say they are swedish ~ ~, 
  i do n't know if you have already a keyboard or screen , but i can send you the ones it had too . 
  perhaps the only problem might be the shipping ( it is kind of heavy as you might imagine ) , but i 'll check pricing if you are indeed interested . 
  i like [ these kinds of cookies ] ( http://bimg2.mlstatic.com/gomas-para-borrar-borrador-forma-de-galletas-suavicremas_mlm-f-69327366_7451.jpg ) .

  oh , right . 
  random acts of kindness . 
  . took me a while xd ;, 
  i 'm actually a frequent in / r/randomkindness , my latest dutties being sending a postcard , some get well cards and i 'm working on fixing an old computer of mine to send to another person . 
  leauge of legends player and a nurse ? 
  sounds quite fitting . 
  hi there !, 
  welcome to this little abode on the internet !, 
  i 'm sure you 'll be quite happy here . 
  i sure have , and it 's only my first day too xd, 
  sup there !, 
  i 'm pretty sure you 'll love this place as many in here . 
  welcome and make yourself comfortable . 
  my first videogame played would be duck hunt for the nes . 
  but my first owned game was this toy story 2 based gameboy game . 
  later on came pokemon and it changed my life forever . 
  i am a frequent lurker on / r/randomkindness so it 's not odd to find nice places on the internet . 
  though i do have to admit that the idea of having a wishlist people can buy you stuff from is still pretty awesome . 
  welcome to the happy team !, 
  you 'll find out how epic this place is quite soon . 
  hope to * gifting * you soon ^ ^,

  \u00a1 qu\u00e9jense !, 
  iirc , while you can only get married in mexico city , the other states * must * recognize all marriages whether they are same-sex or not . 
  this includes international ones . 
  i just hope there will be more into this and have them marry anywhere in the country . 
  baja california , you must be next . 
  let 's beat california !, 
  never . . and i say never say to a uruguayan that they are behind argentina . 
  that might be the * last * thing you do . 
  also , never say to an argentinian they are before somebody else . 
  i ask before i do . 
  i 've met lots of women ( myself included ) that hate pink with the passion of 1000 suns . 
  and who knows , there are guys who like pink too . 
  it 's all just subjective, 
  i 'm in reddit at work , so it helps . 
  but sometimes , i get long periods where i do n't do anything and i can get stressed because i have this mentality where `` i 'm at work . 
  i should be doing stuff ! '' . 
  if i ca n't , then i start feeling a bit depressed , useless and . 
  so , i try to keep myself distracted by drawing or poking around here : p, 
  this forever . 
  when i am stressed and what to over eat ( one of my possible reactions , the other one is to kick the shit out of everything ) i try to grab * healthy * snacks . 
  for munchies , i make myself a cup of popcorn over the stove . 
  add a bit of olive oil and salt ~ ~ and lime ~ ~ and sit down and calm down . 
  the popcorn should help you fill full and stop the cravings . 
  if no popcorn available i can always eat diced carrots and apples . 
  yup , both together : p, 
  you will be missed . 
  mewtwo , of course . 
  anxiously waiting for the new movie that will feature him . 
  iris is n't half bad . 
  i am in love with cilan/dento though xd, 
  i 'm watching the japanese episodes and right now it 's fucking awesome !!!!, 
  why did they have to leave this episode in a cliffhanger ? 
  spanish . 
  get learning some spanish . 
  if you do n't like that option , you can always try chinese, 
  [ nobody can escape some butterape ] ( http://alexonsager.net/pokemon/?one=12&amp;two=57 ), 
  holy shit . 
  how the heck did it get over there ? 
  you * may * want to crosspost this to / r/iran just to see how they deal with that over there . 
  da mangaka was clearly behind schedule on her works and 7 guys from x studio came to demand her to finish . 
  how i escape ? 
  i ca n't , i need to finish this before they try to kidnap me again ; ; ; at least i get to have music and food , right ? 
  i escape a la nabeshin , using a plot worthy of a comedy manga , cosplaying in between and cross dressing .

  an old music box ` portrait ' dad brought from japan on 1986 . 
  also , he has a keychain from when he visited the wtc in new york . 
  i 'd bring my friends together and explore the galaxies . 
  i think we 'd re-name the ship `` enterprise '', 
  to answer your question : yes . 
  ~ ~ with onions ~ ~, 
  how 's being a person like ? 
  why need fake friends when you can create your own world . 
  [ exogenesis part iii ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4eqjvnwfrm ), 
  ~ ~ dae religion is fake and republifundies are stoopid in believing in such lies . 
  only science and sagan are real . 
  circlejerking aside , it 's mostly because atheist ca n't believe ( interesting point here ) that people can be ` deceived ' into beliefs which have no logical explanation and most possibly are a scam . 
  to put it on simple terms , you 'd probably think it 's stupid and incredible to believe in people following scientology or any other nutcase which is proven to be a scam .
