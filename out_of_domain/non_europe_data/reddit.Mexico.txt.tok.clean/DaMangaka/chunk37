  their own logic drowns them into thinking that since it 's indeed logical to know that religion can not be proven due to lack of evidence , then everyone should think the same . 
  therefore , if you still believe , you are clearly stupid/insane . 
  but , to quote immanuel kant : `` at some future time we shall show that the moral laws do not merely presuppose the existence of a supreme being , but also , as themselves in a different connection absolutely necessary , justify us in postulating it , though , indeed , only from a practical point of view '', 
  \\* shrug \\* if science or religion works for you , it 's fine . 
  just keep it for yourself . 
  `` you 're telling me n actually * succeeded * in taking over * and * capture the legendary pokemon ? 
  and now he 's challenging to a battle ? 
  holy crap ! '', 
  did you make a pokecheck on that ? 
  if there was a / r/retiredpoems i 'd send this one over there . 
  the monster movie you 're talking about is called `` pulgasari '', 
  i crashed with a telephone booth while riding my bike . 
  it did n't have brakes or rather they did n't work well . 
  i was just thinking of that xd, 
  apparently . 
  if only they 'd stop loosing .

  my 5 year old gay autistic niece did something like that on her house once .

  did you * not * say ` under god ' in the pledge of allegiance and instead said ` nye ' ? 
  not only he 's doing science but he 's doing the ancient s [ weed ] ish ritual of self-enlightenment . 
  he needs it so his mind can open up and suck more science . 
  da mangaka reporting here , saying that her current fascination is axis powers hetalia . 
  though , to be honest , i prefer the animes from the 90-80s . 
  ~ ~ i also like to focus more on my stories so somehow i keep myself away from anime ~ ~, 
  i 've been pretty much celebrating my own birthdays since i was 18 . 
  what i recommend is to go to a nice restaurant and eat that dish you never thought you 'd get due to x or y. 
  give it a try . 
  a challenge for your birthday . 
  you can also go to walk around the city and go exploring . 
  i love him . 
  he 's adorable ~ ~ despite his story and all ~ ~, 
  i only wish fanfics were kinder with him but i 'm fixing that already + +, 
  based on historical facts and all . 
  it 's taking me too long but i 'm doing it !, 
  i was * born * with a fedora kid . 
  it 'll take me a while , but you can read what i have so far [ here .

  i 'm dedicating to another part of the story ( a sidestory to be more precise ) and i 'll return back to the ` main ' plot as soon as i reach the xx century or the porfiriato . 
  need to balance some things . 
  james ?

  hello there !, 
  nice to meet you !, 
  this would be the 2nd nurse i greet around here , how nice : d, 
  hope you find yourself comfortable here . 
  we are quite the bunch, 
  they look rather cute . 
  please continue, 
  i sat for a whole hour , sad after watching that film . 
  never again i will consider my life miserable . 
  i swear , i * felt * it . 
  it was painful . 
  i began to loose it when that hippy guy had his wife killed . 
  i was like `` shit , dude . 
  . you ca n't . 
  has anybody mentioned `` pan 's labyrinth '' ? 
  that ending had me thinking for a while . 
  oddly enough , the orphanage had an ending which made me cry too . 
  and it was supposed to be a * scary * movie !,

  they are actually the most used languages . 
  sure , chinese has a lot of people speaking it but only due the sheer amount of chinese in existence . 
  because they are rich and can do what ever they want ? 
  it happened in a company i used to work . 
  that company so happens to be foxconn which managed sony products . 
  actually , they laid me off due mismanagement . 
  what is renting movies ? 
  [ boulevard of broken songs - green day + oasis ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rajggiq3jhk#t=00m23s ), 
  i know . 
  by that time , i wanted to flip tables because i 'm pretty sure that if a situation like that happened , we 'd act just like the movie . 
  a very sad view of a possible future .

  worse : if you read the part of the story i 'm writing where i use this song , you 'd cry yourself to death . 
  i can get quite depressive ; ; ;, 
  with that kind of attitude , i do n't think you will go s ofar, 
  i have wanted to escape home at times when i was sad/depressed since i was 10 . 
  while i have n't done so and this might be different than you case ~ ~ perhaps way too different ~ ~ , one thing i 've always put in check is that you must have an inventory of everything you 'll be using and taking with you . 
  like an adventure , where you have a bag of items that are not only dear to you but useful . 
  these items are key on this ` adventure ' and can help you gain ` experience/abilities ' you need to survive . 
  if you have friends to support you and can have you at their home , perfect !, 
  if not , you need to rely * heavily * on your abilities and instincts . 
  your experience . 
  the outside world is different than what you have lived , you must always have that as reference . 
  in reddit there are many places you can go and ask for help/counseling . 
  particularly / r/assistance / r/foodpantry and others . 
  i did n't leave home because i realized that i did n't have the skills to survive outside and because eventually i found out it was emotion-driven and stupid . 
  but i know there are cases ( like yours perhaps ) that it is necessary . 
  i can only hope that everything goes well for you , if you indeed decide to start this adventure . 
  what model is your android ? 
  some come with usb adapters [ like these ] ( http://www.samsung.com/us/system/consumer/accessory/ep/l1/pl/epl1plrbegsta/epl-1plrbegsta_400x400.jpg ),
