  the economy of the world would collapse and stagnant countries would devolve into a state of fascism . 
  meanwhile , the arab league prepares to expand itself . 
  holy crap !, 
  man\u00e1 is alive still ? 
  well , good for them !, 
  they are one of the few remnants of the mexican rocking 80s . 
  wonder who else will join the bandwagon, 
  from what i can make out of the poster ( i love you furigana ) is that this is a new form for mewtwo . 
  it is called the `` awakened '' form or rather his ` awakened ' stance . 
  thoughts about this and better translations ? 
  [ info from serebii ] ( http://www.serebii.net/index2.shtml ), 
  ** edit after reviewing quickly !, 
  this is a rough translation of the text on the poster . 
  with ( the ) remnants of mewtwo . 
  a new pokemon . 
  now , ( it is the ) time to awaken ! '', 
  july 13 roadshow !, 
  ( they call `` roadshows '' the time a movie is circulating in japan ) .

  ^ so ^ brave, 
  ** note two considering this new announcement . 
  ~ ~ my japanese is broken , please excuse me . 
  i need to help myself on google at times . 
  it 's like french . 
  but with characters ~ ~, 
  this is what mewtwo 's profile on the movie site says officially :, 
  * this pokemon was creating by rearranging the genes of mew *, 
  * it maximizes ( it 's ) power to fight *, 
  * `` awaken . 
  eyes awaken . 
  open your eyes ( and awaken ? ), 
  * `` and , come to ( your ) senses , so they realize their lack of '' *, 
  * source : encyclopedia of japanese language , published by shogakukan * < - so this is an actual quote from somewhere ?!, 
  * what does the awakening of mewtwo mean !? 
  more thoughts on this ? 
  you reminded me of my girlfriend . 
  she 's * always * telling me that when i 'm about to flip the world . 
  have an upvote good sir . 
  ~ ~ and for pointing people to my thread ~ ~, 
  i do n't want to go like `` ohhh '' but given that they freaking used a philosophical quote for his profile i 'd say that they 'll up his sp . 
  attack . 
  i 'll call it `` zen mewtwo '' or `` mewtwo of virgo '', 
  ** [ om ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n68fjwkjntw ) **, 
  \\* raises hand \\*, 
  black and white is specially awesome on the dialogue and story . 
  never before i had cried so hard when i finished a game . 
  you have to remember that what makes mewtwo what he is the * story * behind him . 
  there is no pokemon with such kind of deep development as him . 
  if you being to be critical and picky on his current design , you might be bothered about the whole `` tail in crotch '' thing , the wide hips and the neck thingy but what appealed me and the fanbase ( i think ) was the story . 
  now . 
  if they * fuck up * the ** story ** . 
  i will seriously consider going to japan just to burn game freak 's building . 
  ^ _ ^ ; ; ; i say it in a good way . 
  it just made me smile and laugh . 
  * edit because i thought it was a reply to another thread *, 
  i know !!, 
  but , it did n't make me cry as much as when n had to leave . 
  and * that song * ugh \\* thefeels.jpg \\*, 
  i really am pleased pokemon is growing up on this sense . 
  we might actually have an incredible adventure in gen vi, 
  defensive mewtwo could be big possibility too , though i do n't see the bulk on this form ( a la d-deoxys ), 
  yes , my bad . 
  i 'm still a bit bad translating certain idioms and phrases . 
  my japanese is half-half . 
  this can also be backed by the fact that he learned his signature move . 
  ** 15 years ** after being introduced to the game . 
  dunno how long is that in poke-anime years . 
  ** [ new poster , new translation ] ( http://www.serebii.net/corocoro4133.jpg ) **, 
  ~ ~ in my half assed japanese , nonetheless ~ ~, 
  * this is mewtwo 's awakened form *, 
  * the awakened mewtwo and the red genesect . 
  will they finally clash ?!, 
  * mewtwo in the light of awakening . 
  he awaits *, 
  * get to see the awakened mewtwo and the red genesect as quickly as you can *, 
  ^ this is talking about some screening tickets to be able to see the movie first than anybody . 
  if i can translate well it 's 900 pairs of tickets . 
  then there 's preshows for june 30 at 12:30 at two locations . 
  the rest is something about disclaimers ( about availability of tickets , subject restricted to apply . 
  yara yara ) a small add about the eevee mini movie and to check the movie page . 
  so yup , this puts one final nail on the doubt coffin of whether this is or is n't a new form . 
  it 's so big and plump . 
  can i play with it ? 
   from apricorns . 
  ftfy, 
  from the corocoro scans and all , it seems this befriended genesect * can also talk * , following the trend of talking legendaries . 
  hmm , interesting, 
  may i have one , please ? 
  no , that 's your parent 's job . 
  specially if you are asian . 
  it 's actually a * movie * trailer for the 16th movie that 'll come out on the 18th . 
  yeah , more `` newtwo '' things . 
  ~ ~ gringo ~ ~ * statian * english . 
  though technically , since this english comes from the american continent , it is also correct to call it american english , much like `` latin american spanish '' or `` mexican spanish '' is correct . 
  [ relevant comic is relevant ] ( http://www.explosm.net/comics/848/ ), 
  they worked for me but the battery lasted like 10 minutes max . 
  then , you had to replace the * 6 triple a * batteries to have it work for other 10 minutes . 
  my dad and i gave up on rc cars after that : /,
