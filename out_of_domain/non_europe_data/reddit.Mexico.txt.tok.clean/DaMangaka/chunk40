  in comes the movie trailer with the female voice . 
  it 's not that a legendary should n't be female but this is pretty much violating the whole canon of the movies and series . 
  let 's point out this : some movies are cool but utterly pointless when it comes to anime canon . 
  most disregard them . 
  mewtwo is one of the few unique cases where his story actually is canon in the anime and influences it . 
  it was seen already when gary was defeated by it and we saw a special episode in johto . 
  it has a well set in stone story and characteristics . 
  the whole female voice notifies me of the two possibilities :, 
  1 ) this * is n't * our mewtwo from the main canon - which will make my tables flip unless there is a good concise reason as to why . 
  the mewtwo story is the strongest in the series , one of the few and consistent . 
  breaking this means that game freak does n't give a shit anymore . 
  2 ) this * is * the mewtwo from always but different va. 
  understandable if masachika ichimura is not available and since new generation fans might not even care but they will show the 1st movie in japan ( in hd nonetheless ) which might make even the newer fandom wtf is going on . 
  older fans ( like myself ? ), 
  will bitch and whine about this most possibly . 
  japanese vas are very dedicated and the fandom is more . 
  if they are changed , the whole fanbase flips . 
  just read what happened when they tried to change goku 's voice to a more adult one when they first aired dbz . 
  3 ) this movie is * not * canon . 
  this is an interesting perk here and one that i do n't like either . 
  the genesect army was presented in the anime so we * know * that they are included in the canon . 
  their existence is known ( at least , by n ) . 
  having shown them in the anime and making the movie just a showcase of legendaries ( like in the prior movie or , hell , even the excellently made trio from the diamond and pearl era which canon link got thrown to the trash given the revival of dialga and palkia in the anime by cyrus as according to the games ) is rather pointless and even stupid . 
  why is this important even ? 
  what sold me mewtwo was the * movie *, 
  before the movie , he was just another catchable pokemon . 
  after it , a true legend was born . 
  heck , even pokespe got the traits from the mewtwo of the movie !, 
  that 's how broad the extension of his canon is . 
  it reaches far and wide ~ ~ dun dun dun dun ... each pokemon to understand the power that 's inside ... ~ ~, 
  this movie can butcher very badly his image and i can only fear that the other pokemon can too . 
  as for the form in the game , we 'll see what stats they 'll give it . 
  until then , i wo n't comment about it . 
  i can breed/offer you the following :, 
  - pineco, 
  - bidoof ( with hidden ability ), 
  i am looking for, 
  - minccino w / hidden ability ( f ), 
  - trubbish w/hidden ability ( f ), 
  my flair has my current fc . 
  this =  2795-8493-8495, 
  i * ca n't * stand the japanese version of adult goku . 
  i grew up with [ mario casta\u00f1eda ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txzkpfvvbya#t=02m38s ) as the voice of adult goku and he does a splendid job . 
  perhaps due regionality but i listen to him and i imagine goku ~ ~ or jim carrey ~ ~, 
  i am really crossing my fingers that they do n't . 
  if they do , they 've lost a fan . 
  you still want the pokemon , though ? 
  i can trade them, 
  do you happen to have a pokemon that has avalanche so i [ can breed it with mudkip ? 
  ] ( http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/avalanche#by_breeding ), 
  damn it . 
  \u2665 v \u2665 there is such thing ? 
  yes !, 
  mexicano ? 
  i have a wired original hp mouse . 
  do n't know if it 'll work for you . 
  bravery level : so . 
  ~ ~ so brave of me . 
  oh , do n't feel old ( and it was just me making a failed emoticon there really ) . 
  i love postcards . 
  i love snail mail . 
  that thing is good \u2665, 
  do n't you see he 's busy on his train ? 
  ergh . . those will be hard to find . 
  it 's sad that they ca n't be bred . 
  oh well , good luck !, 
  i think if i recall , the kanto starters with hidden abilities were distributed in japan . 
  the bad thing is that they are * male * , so that means you ca n't breed and pass down the ability . 
  shame , really . 
  but ... they are calle popo ... 
  buy me crap and send it to me !, 
  ~ ~ i 'll pay for everything , do n't worry ~ ~, 
  \\* destella \\*, 
  the pokewalker was colored to resemble a net ball , which is better used for catching water ( fished ) and bug type pokemon . 
   the most recent episode, 
  = n = ; ; ; this is what happens when i watch the japanese version instead . 
  ca n't follow my peers . 
  \\* first world fansub problems \\*, 
  in mexico , if you arrive * early * to a party , you are either part of the family of the celebrated or too ` serious ' . 
  you are expected to arrive at least 30 minutes after the time stated , or 1 hr if it 's a quinceanera thing . 
  killer instinct, 
  i tend to do the following when i notice i 'm sad :, 
  - listen to music, 
  - ~ ~ write off my sadness in an epic story where gods descend into madness and end up killing themselves . 
  unable to die due to their condition . ~ ~, 
  - eat some fruit : apples seem to do marvels to cheering me up . 
  watermelons more . 
  - if nothing helps , sleep it off . 
  around here where i live , it 's common to have your watermelon diced , covered with lemon , salt and powdered chili . 
  it 's glorious btw, 
  pretty much this is how you can make a simple yakisoba : have some ramen/soba noodles on a pan with enough water to submerge them , cook quickly , drain if needed . 
  in another pan grab some sauce , veggie and sautee with the noodles . 
  fucking delicious and quick too !, 
  ffffffffff - . 
  i ruined my own post . 
  op * must * be a faggot . 
  no , it 's / r/pyangyong, 
  usually i go with 1 lime/lemon , a bit of powdered chili and salt to taste . 
  it 's all to taste . 
  i just fucking love lemon on all things .
