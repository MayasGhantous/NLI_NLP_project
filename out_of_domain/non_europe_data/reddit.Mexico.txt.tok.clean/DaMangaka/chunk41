  i only have 3 games : tf2 , portal 1 and 2 . 
  i do n't have time to be bribed by steam to buy stuff sadly : /, 
  we kicked the ass of france with an army made out of peasants . 
  the day was the fifth of may . 
  nevertheless , though . 
  . that was one trick pony . 
  and we also did color tv . 
  people tend to forget that the american revolution war , as many of the wars of independence in america , were proxy wars . 
  they won because their conquerors ( mainly england and spain ) were beaten the shit up by other european powers , particularly prussia and france . 
  so , yeah . 
  viva la france !, 
  mexico is fervently catholic , has had the pope like 5 times and yet they managed to get mexico city and other states host gay marriages and adoptions . 
  while this does n't seem much , by law , * any * legal marriage , local or foreign * must * be accepted by the 31 + df states . 
  this means that if a french gay couple marries in france , their marriage is valid in mexico . 
  likewise a gay couple married in mexico city must have their marriage taken as valid anywhere they move around the country . 
  there are some states that never considered gay marriage in their constitution and thus are able to get married thanks to loopholes or the actual [ senate declaring that laws which ban such unions are unconstitutional ] ( http://www.policymic.com/articles/20275/where-is-gay-marriage-legal-mexico-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-same-sex-couples ) . 
  there 's still a long way to go so we have a full coverage , but i 'm sure we 'll get it legal here too . 
  ~ ~ before the us if i might add :p ~ ~, 
  y los calimaxes . 
  are you by any chance a scientist ? 
  well i have ** 2 ** pressure cookers . 
  who 's going to rule the world now , eh ? 
  and they told me those things from `` seen on tv '' where going to be useless . 
  upvoting due this, 
  my french is horrible . 
  i 'm still learning ( or re-learning in any case ) . 
  thanks for the fix, 
  ~ ~ it does n't matter , i can always dig under the fence . 
  i do write manga . 
  i have n't gotten time to do anything lately though , and materials are expensive . 
  therefore , i have to work . 
  currently , i am making fanfictions for hetalia but in a more historical , somewhat darker approach . 
  ~ ~ and working on that freaking webpage which i might not even end up until comic-con . 
  yeah , but later on spain was fucked by england . . . and civil wars , which allowed the latin american countries to begin their own independence . 
  meanwhile , brazil ... 
  `` yo , mom , i 'm moving out . 
  i 'm old enough and i think i can sustain myself . '', 
  `` alright dear , just do n't leave a mess on the way out \\* signs independence treaty \\* '', 
  i think i just got them in for some reason  : /, 
  in any how , the big contender was england vs france with spain `` helping '' france ... 
  helping , if it was n't busy being fucked by itself and by england . 
  i think you can transfer it to a box in pokemon stadium 2 . 
  i 'm not sure , i 'd have to check .

  danke , mein friend . 
  `` oh jeesh , my phone was in * vibrator * mode so i did n't hear it ring . 
  or in women :, 
  `` i * did * hear it ring but it was all the way down the bag and when i got it , it stopped ringing . '', 
  then add any of the `` battery is dead '' scenarios to nail it further . 
  `` tossed salad '', 
  i wanted to learn how to distribute dressing better . 
  . closed chrome and cleaned up the cookies ... 
  a boy that was 9 years old told me that if he could borrow my gold version while he was at my home . 
  my 12 year old self , thinking all kids should know pokemon by that time said `` sure , why not ? '', 
  when he gave me back my game , the idiot had started a new game . . with cyndaquil ( i just hated fire starters back then ) . 
  i promptly bitchslapped and punched his face . 
  his mom later came to scorn me . 
  and the lesson here is : never lend your pokemon games to anyone . 
  i would remove my arms and become a scyther . 
  just because . 
  chicken teriyaki with vegetable tempura and rice . 
  or a simple one : enchiladas suizas . 
  origin of symmetry - muse, 
  thanks , i am no longer hungry . 
  you sick fuck . 
  stop buying shit . 
  cook your own food . 
  prepackaged does n't count . 
  i thought your job was for us to sell our souls and bound them to your company ... 
  that 's not a mess , my good sir . 
  that is just a room that has life on it . 
  now . . if you saw my sister 's room . 
  sleep . 
  i suppose that 's fair . 
  my job is to brainwash people to obey a certain master lord into into doing it 's every demand ( i 'm a graphic designer ) . 
  `` throw anything at me , you fuck !, 
  ** i can take anything !, 
  not to mention that [ n actually managed to do what he was proposed to do !, 
  sure archie/maxie did summon kyogre/groudon but they really did n't exactly succeed . 
  n was the first ` villian ' who not only said `` i 'll do this '' but actually * did * it . 
  and he * kept * the legendary too .

  ~ ~ + a + i want one ~ ~, 
  wow !, 
  what a lucky girl !, 
  i wonder if you 'll play pokemon x/y with it . 
  dibs on the fc, 
  how good is to have amazon prime ? 
  i do n't tend to order that much from amazon myself and if i do it 's usually e-books . 
  i think it 's a subscription , right ? 
  will this include breadsticks and endless salad in my order ? 
  yay !!!!, 
  i think i have a new project to do on august + v +,
