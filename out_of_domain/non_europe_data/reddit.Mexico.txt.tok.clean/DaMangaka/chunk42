  only 90s kids will understand * this *, 
  dae if you are wapanese the year goes first ? 
  that 'll make 12/12/12 into 12/12/12 !, 
  amazing amirite ? 
  i sometimes find myself feeling a pigeon . 
  does that count ? 
  and so , the exodus to uruguay began . 
  as a mexican , it is such a bad wound . 
  it 's like a guy bleeding in the street and nobody giving a shit because `` he 'll be dead soon anyways '', 
  it 's not really as bad as the media portrays it , but really we could use some help . 
  help in the sense of `` stop pretending drug prohibition will work and do something more logical '' . 
  not in intervention . 
  the mass media ( in the us and in mexico ) are more interested on `` omgad moar dead bodies ! '', 
  than '' ... seeking a resolution to the root problem of the anti-drug war . 
  sells more . 
  then again , lately the media in mexico has been rather quiet now that we have this idiot in power ... 
  i 'm tempted to do a `` condescending wonka '' macro but i do n't know what to put on it . 
  best leave it like that : p, 
  i forgot my ipod while i was rushing out from the gym . 
  i had to pick up something . 
  luckily they called me just before i left the building . 
  good thing too : that ipod is signed by wozniak ... and it 's my only mp3 player ( though i think i might need to get another one , apps are running slow despite having only 8gb full of stuff on a 32gb ipod . 
  it 's a gen 3 ), 
  the cartels are currently into a big war with each other . 
  the zetas and the michoacana ( which control acapulco ) mainly . 
  so , yeah ... bad stuff . 
  my girlfriend introduced me to reddit , so she ca n't poke at me on that ( though we tend to play a little game of `` i spotted it on reddit first '' sometimes : p ), 
  though , my parents - do - like to remind me that i seem to throw my life at a screen ... constantly . 
  . since i was 12 . . 
  i really do n't mind appearances - met many awesome people whose way to dress could be questioned - but i freaking dislike people who feel themselves too overly important . 
  worse is when that person dresses awesome but is icky on the inside . 
  nope , avoid at all costs . 
  well , i can put it like this :, 
  - elementary school - i bawled like never before , got an epic lego mindstorm playset and we ate like kings . 
  pretty epic . 
  - junior high - it almost seemed like they threw the diploma to me . 
  a la `` ok , you 're done . 
  this was a catholic school btw . 
  - high school - i lost all of my fucks here . 
  by the time i was graduating , i had none . 
  - university - `` am i even getting tacos this time ? '', 
  ~ ~ spoilers : i did n't get any ~ ~, 
  : / guess it 's age . 
  clearly you are mistaken . 
  the greatest pokemon is ** mewtwo **, 
  there 's no pokemon that can attest it 's might and better : none have a deeper and long canon/story as this one have . 
  none , not even arceus . 
  arceus was just ... there ... poof . 
  the whole mewtwo story ( drama ? ), 
  reaches out to many . 
  ~ ~ you can clearly see i love this pokemon ~ ~, 
  aside from that my 2nd favorite pokemon , with a stash of 17 , is pidgeot . 
  my father thought and helped me to do a resume . 
  it is also the * only * time i get to wear a super formal suit/attire so i can impress them . 
  though , after university , many would n't hire me because i was too `` overqualified '' . 
  afterwards i did obtain some other but they where temporal ( i lasted max 3 months ) . 
  i 'm about to cross the 3 month date with my current job this friday . 
  if i make it to may , it 'll be the first job in 2 years that is not * as * temporal as my others . 
  wish me luck  / / v / / < ; ; ;, 
  indeed : (, 
  the south and northeast are like that . 
  i wish we get back to stability . 
  that 's * all * we need to grow . 
  even if the politicians keep gulping all of our tax money . 
  we only need peace ... 
  right now their main enemy is the gulf cartel and the control over veracruz . 
  the michoacana is eating the leftovers of the sinaloa cartel but sometimes finds itself wanting to expand more . 
  not to mention los caballeros templarios . 
  damn . 
  . too many, 
  and your other suggestion is ? 
  we had one on 1847 . . 
  . it hurt our ass . 
  no thank you . 
  to be honest , it 's not so far-fetched . 
  i 've heard countless of stories , particularly in sinaloa , where narco lords * protected * people and gave them jobs , loaned them money with very few interests and even threw parties for those poor in need . 
  like a robin hood coated in weed . 
  in a country where politicians only get into power to steal money and get assets , narcos are sometimes seen as saviors and that 's why many work with them and are loyal to them . 
  sadly , the war on drugs flipped things over and many of the ` good ' ones died , giving out to the really psychotic that go far enough to decapitate people and what not . 
  it is kind of sad : /, 
  i wish the three powers here would suddenly combust in flames ... 
  more like `` oi , did you read about the guy that was found hung on a bridge with a message ? '', 
  `` another one ? 
  * sigh * 9 _ 9 '', 
  it 's no longer shocking . 
  it 's practically an every day thing . 
  it 's sad . 
  we would * really * like to but we have our neighbor in the north saying that what we are doing is good and pats our head . 
  that and our government sucks the dick of yours . 
  we are rather left out  : /, 
  does it taste like apple ? 
  lies !, 
  yes but at least you are asked before . 
  . at least we make a good threesome . 
  sad that we are only bottoms . 
  when i am really `` lazy '' i just go to sleep really . 
  sleep is wonderful to me , i get to listen to music before sleeping and think about things to write or draw . 
  once i get inspired , i get to draw something spiffy . 
  you can get artwork like [ this one ] ( http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2013/041/0/c/torrent_of_love_by_gslucky-d5ujn65.png ) after a long night sleep - v -, 
  so most likely is sleep , music and drawing .
