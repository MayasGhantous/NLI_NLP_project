  that 's my perfect afternoon . 
  the interesting part is that while i do play videogames i only do so on the road , but even though that , drawing + music is my priority . 
  splendifferous btw : p, 
  if all goes well and they do n't call me to hr , this friday i will be officially breaking my record of 3 months . 
  might not sound much but lately i have only been hired for a max of 3 months without any chances to stay . 
  if by friday i get to renew my contract or simply they do n't call me to hr , it 'll be my first job in 2 years that 's stable . 
  tons to celebrate for that . 
  good times = v = b, 
  i ~ ~ 'd love to ~ ~ want to spend candroth 's money, 
  i do n't live in the united states . 
  i only use an american address to ship/receive things . 
  ~ ~ it 's cheaper that way ~ ~ . 
  hurray for the advantages of living on the border = 7 =, 
  now , for the item , would be cool to have [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/prismacolor-graphite-drawing-set/dp/b001bypro8/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=in1sx6rhl4dgr ) for sketches or [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/prismacolor-verithin-colored-pencils-36/dp/b000mk9ywi/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pc_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=i14lvqr4ycvq7i ) for details . 
  this is the story of a girl who had a goal even from a young age : she wanted to be the greatest comic writer in the world . 
  her father recommended her to first finish school and that it would help her get a job to reach her goal which she did with her quirkiness . 
  in the end , just as her new life begins she realizes that reality is another and that life does n't give a fuck about who you are . 
  then begin the hilarious adventures of a girl who ca n't seem to keep a job or get a job due to many circumstances , meets new friends which are also struggling in a world where economical crisis seem too common and yet secretly hushed or ignored : a quiet programmer whose face does n't seem to change from a poker face expression , a just graduated materials engineer who has quite a libido , another artist who has only managed to get odd jobs ( from `` secretary '' to a supposed mob boss to a beekeeper ) , a canadian who while does n't seem to care about anything in the world really gives insights about random topics , a couple of cute girls , a random psychic , a guy who always looses at everything and other oddities . 
  might seem a strange scenario , does n't it ? 
  but that 's just part of the `` tales of a jobless mangaka '', 
  epic comedygold, 
  i thought it like that too , but it became so frustratingly * frequent * , i remember punching a wall ( almost literal here ) and cursing of just that . 
  i had to take out some skills on my resume so it did n't seem to ` frightening ' . 
  i mean , here in my city there are many manufacturing plants and i know most of their regulating systems due to my father being a quality manager for almost 30 years . 
  i read his books since i was 10 so i have quite an ` experience ' on that . 
  to have this random chick ( me ) to know qsrs and other things to people who do n't even know , well ... 
  my father has been pushing me to get them back on my resume ( he did the first version of it ) but due to the whole `` overqualified '' thing , best not to until i have 5 years of experience in a job . 
  it 's so hard because unless you have certain * years * , nobody cares for you . 
  this is probably why i do n't visit this sub so frequently . 
  i get an attack of `` y u no update faster '' and i find it better to cool off on places that update stupidly fast like / r/circlejerk ~ ~ yes ... 
  but it 's nice to see the posts here : d, 
  i resigned at my first job due health issues . 
  or rather , my body did so . 
  you see , i worked on customer service ~ ~ oh god ... ~ ~ for verizon dsl ~ ~ oh shit not them ~ ~ so it could be very stressful and annoying . 
  i never lashed out at the customers because i knew that most of the time they were computer illiterate or really the company was retarded . 
  nevertheless , the fact that we were forced to keep a handle time of under 14 minutes ( later 12 minutes before i left ) made me cringe . 
  you * ca n't * manage a customer well in under 14 minutes and expect them not to call you again . 
  usually when * i * call a customer service for my internet service , i * already * did the troubleshooting and it 's only to check on the company 's side . 
  the people i had calls on may not even have an idea of how their computer works . 
  so i got stressed , and suddenly my work hours shifted from 8am to 2pm to 6am to 2pm . 
  just like that . 
  and no saturday/sundays . 
  i also had school back then ( first year of university ) , so i had to run out from work , get on a bus and hope i arrive at 3 . 
  this was my first semester and by the second i was so tired that one day i just collapsed . 
  my body would n't literately move one morning and i called sick . 
  eventually , after a talk with my parents - to be honest , i had kept up this bad job just so my parents would n't call me lazy since they worked and went to school when they were my age and all - they agreed that i should just focus on school for the while . 
  so i left . 
  a month later , i felt like new . 
  also , all that stress made me gain 20 pounds @n @ ;, 
  even as i was jobless , i * never * considered going back there . 
  nuh-uh , never . 
  go to hell outsourcing call centers ... 
  is it true that you can trow a fedora like a boomerang ? 
  [ today i had cereal ] ( http://www.vitacost.com/images/products/1000/barbaras-bakery/barbaras-bakery-puffins-cereal-original-070617206096.jpg ) . 
  it was awesome . 
  i 'm also drinking a blend of tea to keep me awake xd ;, 
  my dad frowns and wonders how i can put lime to everything i eat . 
  from chicken to popcorn . 
  do n't you get that lime is awesome dad ? 
  next time , try watermelon with a bit if lime juice , salt and chili powder . 
  delicious < 3, 
  pretty much what team plasma does in po - . 
  then they * were * indeed a mock of them xdd, 
  try some lavender tea . 
  can be drunk or even just left close to your bed so it leave a slight scent . 
  knocks the hell out of me, 
  i love them too !, 
  sadly i can only get them at whole foods . 
  sadly , i say so , because the whole foods that 's closest to where i live is almost 1hr and a half away on trolley . 
  but 's well worth it . 
  you and i could be best friends . 
  the difference is that i love soft plushie blankets . 
  ever since i was a little * baby * i had this soft blankie which i even carried around everywhere ( like linus from peanuts ) . 
  i even made it my soft cape . 
  at the age of 10 , it was so worn out it had to go ( and i cried so bad ... ), 
  even now , at my ripe age of xx , when ever i go to buy blankets i make sure they are as soft at touch as possible . 
  like baby minks . 
  it makes me feel so happy = / / 7 / / = ~ < 3, 
  i knew it was full of propaganda . 
  . but the story and all . 
  really disappointing . 
  i flipped a table at the oscars . 
  when i have the money , i do . 
  i am planning on getting him a galaxy note 10.1 tablet for father 's day too . 
  well , for his birthday ( this may 3rd ) we are taking my dad to see billy eliot . 
  he likes that play . 
  i 'll also dress pretty ( i tend to be a tomboy who is happy dressing the first shirt/pair of jeans that i find xd ; ), 
  my sister ** loves ** tim burton . 
  every single movie he has made , she watches it . 
  she is particularly more in love with the nightmare before christmas which she knows by heart so much she can tell you every dialogue of the movie . 
  word.by.word . 
  i kid you not . 
  ~ ~ i got nothing in my last birthday . 
  except for food from my friend . 
  food is awesome ~ ~, 
  oh gosh , i remember receiving one . 
  i forgot where i put it . 
  got lost when we moved . 
  that dog gif . 
  is perfect .
