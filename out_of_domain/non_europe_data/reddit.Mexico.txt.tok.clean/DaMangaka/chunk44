  i shall steal it . 
  a graphic designer !, 
  \\* raises fist to bump \\*, 
  nice to have you here . 
  i have wanted to go into the rendered world of 3d but it takes quite a time . 
  tell me , what program do you use to render and/or create your 3d graphics ? 
  i signed for two : simple pleasures and plushies . 
  simple pleasures is easy but i 'm working on the plushie one . 
  i have n't done a plushie in a while , so wish me luck ^ ^ ;, 
  to be fair , we mexican make jokes about our own accidents/situations . 
  i 'm sure that if a bomb exploded in the mexican metro , we 'd have some few mourners and most would be poking jokes . 
  just remember the [ wolverine from the pemex tower ] ( http://filmdrunk.uproxx.com/2013/02/mexican-wolverine-saved-people-from-pemex-tower-explosion-ricardo-fuentes ) . 
  it was more hyped than the whole explosion itself , he was even given interviews and all . 
  as a bonus , when the news said that there was a possible bomb in the chamber of the senate , everyone was commenting on how it should have exploded ... 
  in the historical context , it sucks . 
  in the `` it 's just a movie '' context , the plot is clich\u00e9 and predictable even . 
  i * knew * they were n't going to make it out to them . 
  stupid `` best movie '' oscar . 
  should have gone to `` life of pi '' or `` lincon '', 
  a real life poketch ? 
  shut up and take my money !, 
  mind level : this, 
  `` 26 stab wounds declared ` suicide ' '', 
  \u0449 ( \u0ca0 \u0ca0 ) you 're telling me that a guy just decided to kill himself by stabbing himself not only once but 26 times . 
  a soldier who was trained to know how to kill and who 'd probably cut his yugular or something more logical ? 
  i think they think us stupid ... 
  local ? 
  damn , why are these sort of jobs so far away from me u _ u ;, 
  i would also like to see the kind of pool of blood he left . 
  might give more insight of whether he did or not stab himself . 
  would be * really * messy if he did . 
  now these are the kind of attitudes kids should have . 
  being able to see things like these and stand up for the needed . 
  lots of proud sparkles for your little girl = 7 = b, 
  pink circles on blue . 
  for some reason , the keyword reminded me of super mario ** galaxy **, 
  i need to play two ... 
  ehem , item would be [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/moleskine-plain-notebook-large/dp/8883701143/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=i1n9xzwap3o65 ) or [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/hetalia-powers-russian-passport-notebook/dp/b004ud3q72/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_s_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=idth00x7wz2e2 ),

  my favorite team , which i 'm trying to convert my father into , is the new england patriots . 
  i do n't have any picks to get for drafts but i only hope my boys reach the super bowl again and kick ass . 
  if you wonder what 's my dad 's team , it 's the san diego chargers . 
  to be honest , i hope the new coach is better . 
  i stopped liking them once norv turner wrecked the team . 
  welp , considering it 's about to come ~ ~ making this a plausible psa ? ~ ~ : 5 de mayo , unlike many people might think , is ** not ** mexico 's independence day . 
  that would the september 16 . 
  no , what happened on may 5th is that the french invaded us and we kicked their asses . 
  that might not sound particularly awesome - given the current jokes on the french army only knowing to retreat and loose - but back then you have to consider the following happening in word history :, 
  * the french army was indeed an army to behold . 
  it was one of the strongest armies in europe , just a little behind england . 
  to give you an idea , some 30 years before they had defeated the holy roman empire ( not at whole but part of the reason it fell was thanks to france ) . 
  * mexico was ( or is ? ), 
  in a constant political power which made it have ** 50 presidents ** in little than 50 years . 
  yes , that 's almost * 1 president per year * . 
  there were two political parties who struggled to see who was powerful ( conservatives and liberals ) enough that years later each party would declare their own president . 
  the money in this political turmoil was sent to hell and thus impoverishing the country . 
  ( it appears we have n't changed at all in 200 years ) . 
  * aside from being poor due internal strife , we owed england , spain and france money . 
  england said `` k , you can pay once you stop ... beating you wankers off '' and spain was possibly too emotional ( `` it 's ok my baby , i 'll pardon you ; v ; '' ) but france saw their opportunity ( the second , mind you ) to get their claws on the country . 
  also , the mexican-american war had pretty much punched us and stabbed us hard and we still bled . 
  so with all these problems , how the * fuck * would mexico defeat the all mighty french army ? 
  the general ignacio zaragoza notified the current ( and mostly recognized president ) leader benito juarez about the imminent attack . 
  since the army was split and battling itself , zaragoza armed himself with his loyal men and * peasants * . 
  peasants with no knowledge of war or battle . 
  naturally , the french scoffed at this when they arrived hoping for a quick and easy battle . 
  nope , we ** won ** and by * far * . 
  this hurt the ego of the french people so badly that their next try they brought ** three times ** the army size . 
  sadly , by then , zaragoza had passed away due to an illness . 
  juarez had to flee to the north ( the current ciudad juarez ) and the conservatives welcomed the french who helped them install the 2nd mexican empire . 
  tl ; dr - 5 de mayo celebrates the * lucky * defeat of the french army by a bunch of mexican n00bs lead by an excellent strategical leader . 
  his face is on the 500 peso bill ( or was really ) . 
  ps : it is to note that since this is n't an official holiday in mexico , almost * none * remembers it . 
  only puebla hosts official celebrations . 
  the rest do n't give a fuck since we do n't get a day off . 
  it 's sad : /, 
  indeed . 
  the world is not the united states , nor america if we go on too picky . 
  but , alas . 
  our exports . 
  i did n't get tickets for the san diego comic-con this year and volunteers dont ' seem to be open yet ... 
  this will be a sad year for me \u2565 \u2565, 
  i am writing a hetalia fanfic ( from all the possible topics , you * had * to choose that one , right ? 
  however , he can get a bit [ snappy ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/yandere ) on that regard too ( `` i raised you with all my love , even while england stabbing me constantly on my back . 
  the * least * i would like from you is * some respect * '' ) . 
  though , with the current irl situation of spain and how i have put it on the latest part of the series is horribly sad ... ( `` maybe it 'll be best if you carried on without me ... '' ) . 
  i suppose since it 's based out of short comics . 
  it has so much potential but it can also cause a lot of hurt if it really followed history . 
  ~ ~ that is why i 'm taking the burden ~ ~, 
  welp , time to cross over to the us to get my deoxys .
