  `` fuck yeah seaking !!! '', 
  and then i proceed to do everything i have wanted to do but ca n't because it is n't ` lady-like ', 
  `` fuck you guys , i 'm a dude now '', 
  i suppose it 's not `` in school '' but the whole school in general . 
  it 's what we call the `` curse of brother taborin '' ( my junior high was a catholic school ) . 
  nobody knows if the `` legend '' behind it is true or not but it was a fact that every year somebody from the school died , i kid you not . 
  let me give you a run down from my sweet junior high years . 
  * ** year 1 ** - a senior died in a car crash when returning home . 
  apparently he was n't drunk or anything , but was hit by somebody else . 
  * ** year 2 ** - might not count but : a dude that lived just 2 blocks away from the school got kidnapped by some guys from the sinaloa cartel . 
  he luckily was found alive in sinaloa . 
  he never came back though . 
  also , on that year , the small hall we had for presentations caught on fire for no reason . 
  * ** year 3 ** - in this year , the school had started a high school building . 
  not 2 months after it started , a freshman 's ( from high school ) family car fell down a cliff . 
  i do n't know how it was but a senior from junior high - her sister - did n't wear the seat belt , had the window open and when that happened , the speed made her literately pop out the window with the rest of the family falling to their doom . 
  it was shocking . 
  i thought it was just mere coincidence but my sister got into the same junior high as i did and she told me the following :, 
  * ** year one ** - my gym/soccer teacher died due cancer : ( he was also the father of my sister 's best friend . 
  * ** year two ** - 2 kids from senior year . 
  do n't know the details . 
  also , a kid from 2nd year of high school was caught having sex with a 2nd year of * junior high * . 
  they had a kid . 
  the high school dude had a teacher at that school and promptly they fled . 
  * ** year three ** - car crash takes down 4 high school guys . 
  drunk driving i think . 
  there are actually 2 branches of that school in my city so i do n't know if there are any other ocurances on there . 
  but in my side , this school , you know something bad might happen year after year  _ , 
  no t t, 
  the fence you have works both ways . 
  stay on your side plz, 
  we can if we build a large tunnel under the states :d, 
  well , here 's a rundown on why the movies are bad :, 
  ** first movie ** - fuck yeah !, 
  optimus !, 
  fuck yeah autobots and shit and destroying things and wohooooo !, 
  ** second movie ** - more robots yay ! . 
  . and american flags . 
  . and balls . 
  ** third movie ** - they are n't even trying , are they ? 
  go and see battleship and compare it to this movie . 
  you 'll be blown away ( perhaps literately ), 
  ^ directed ^ by ^ michael ^ bay, 
  xmen 1 and 2 where cool . 
  * sigh * jean ` phoenix ' grey is psychotic but * not like that *, 
  perhaps if i stopped comparing the movies to the 90 's xmen cartoons ... 
  on the other hand , xmen , first class was brilliant and cemented my love for magneto . 
  the love for twilight makes a * better * love story than twilight itself : /, 
  the first 2 mummy movies where freaking awesome . 
  the third one was an insult to the franchise . 
  my sister and i act like there is no mummy 3 and we are actually waiting for it . 
  lime . 
  lots of lime . 
  put lime on all, 
  that 's pretty much what i use . 
  dvd shrink to rip them , nero to burn . 
  yup, 
  you know !, 
  you 're right !, 
  though , i 'm surprised * cyrus * has a crobat given his background ... 
  laser lines, 
  but it 's sold out \u10da ( ; ; a ; ; \u10da ), 
  death star by muse . 
  i have an apple in my lunch bag . 
  it speaks to me . 
  i think / u/kphx is a cool dude . 
  will they take my money and ship it to my house ? 
  i have checked it out but it demands an address in japan if i remember right . 
  lol , my first language * is * spanish : p, 
   `` not possible '', 
  what you did , i saw . 
  which is why i want him to use it as comparison . 
  the * only * real difference between battleship and the wrecks created on transformers 2 and 3 is that there are no giant robots on battleship . 
  the rest is the same . 
  then you must use moar . 
  use more lime and live forever !,
