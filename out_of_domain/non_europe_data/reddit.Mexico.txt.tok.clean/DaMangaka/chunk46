  i want to be angry with you because you gave it a female voice in the movie but . 
  but . 
  maybe . 
  \\* rolls stupidly *, 
  ~ ~ on your reddit birthday you get it . 
  it 's a nice reminder of how long you 've been here . 
  check your profile to see when it is ~ ~, 
  ah , she has her mother 's looks ... 
  en la primera llegamos a 16vos de final . 
  ahhhh !, 
  it 's odd you say that , considering the great pharma-tourism in my city . 
  many americans cross the border to get cheaper medicine . 
  so i guess it 's m00t on some areas . 
  but i really did n't know it was illegal to do so 0 .0, 
  there 's actually a [ shiny ditto ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lb5pq0y6h8 ) ` glitch ' that uses this principle . 
  now silly people , you rotate the d-pad when you throw the ball , then press down + a when it 's shaking . 
  * everyone * knows that 's the correct way . 
  / r/fifthworldproblems, 
  : / i can draw you something but i get out of work at 6pm pst today . 
  could try paint though ... 
  oh , awesome !, 
   ameristralia, 
  it became an actual reddit exchange . 
  well , i 'll be darned . 
  i wonder what will the nostalgia be ... got ta finish this one of simple pleasures though . 
  stupid usps = v = ; ; ;, 
  my worst choice to eat would be an all-you-can eat buffet close to my work . 
  charges around 9.50 usd for the chow down . 
  but i only eat a small soup and chow-mein . 
  there are indeed small 3 usd lunchs to go but none have what i want . 
  i my stomach has slowly shrunk through out this year . 
  yay !, 
  your job sounds like a blast !, 
  i am currently working making cad drawings for personalized hot tub covers . 
  you know , like when your cover gets worn off and need a new one but ca n't find the model and all ? 
  i do the drawings to get it done . 
  it 's not that interesting but 's cool and a job in the end . 
   reddit , can i be a r [ ea ] cist and stupid republikkkan [ f ] undie ? 
  ftfy . 
  and the answer is no . 
   hl2 episode 2.5 with bonus features and hats confirmed, 
  ftfy, 
  little did op know that having her grandma wear a fedora would cause her to stroke . 
  i hope you 're joking . 
  i am currently doing a story and one of the keypoints is world war 2 , particularly on the german-russian relationships . 
  i would like to know on regards to the battle :, 
  - how well prepared was the army ? 
  indeed the russian army was a great force to recon and was perhaps the most feared during ww2 . 
  however , it is also noticeable how they would go to battle almost unprepared ( both in equipment and/or training ) . 
  how true is that and what was the extent of the civilian readiness ? 
  - aside from civilian casualties , are there other kind of damages caused by the german invasion ? 
  i want to know how much they looted , given how they got as far as to steal the amber room . 
  also , how did this affect in the long term ? 
  are there any visible signs of it now ? 
  thanks . 
  my goddesses . 
  this sounds a lot like what my sister does . 
  though , she usually does so when she 's nervous . 
  when she 's overly stressed or anxious , she goes to vomit for no good reason . 
  i do n't know if this is related ... 
  your art is so alluring . 
  there 's something i ca n't really name but like about it all . 
  it 's different , i like it . 
  hmm , i 'm looking for an artist so it can draw something for me . 
  perhaps we can make a deal . 
  i have a long description [ here ] ( http://pastebin.com/u7gsncwc ) . 
  it is to not that i am * not * looking for an anime-style . 
  i 'm looking any style . 
  the thing is that those are the only references i could pull out . 
  it 's for a fanfic cover book . 
  yes . 
  seems i 'm wasting too much on my time on something that 's not 100 % original but , i think it is worth it . 
  let me know if you have any questions and stuff . 
  well , hello there !, 
  good to see you here . 
  i 've been watching your past amas but never managed to get a question done since it was going to be drowned in the millions of replies in here . 
  so , now that i caught this at 3seconds , i 'll try to be quick . 
  background : i 'm from mexico and i 've been following you ever since the 2012 campaign . 
  the question : obviously the first one will be `` how to heal the mexico-united states relationships ? '', 
  and i 'm not only talking about the whole immigration thing ( which has roots in both sides , i will admit ) , but in regards of the image and politics placed upon each other . 
  it seems that you guys in the north get all the benefits from treaties like nafta , while it seems [ we steal your jobs ] \u2122 due to outsourcing . 
  how can we ( we in the sense of your government and ours ... ~ ~ though you might have to drag them ~ ~ ) balance two countries that are so different yet united in such a unique way ? 
  thanks for listening to quirky me ^ ^ ;, 
  all right = v = b, 
  i have a question :, 
  ~ ~ why are you so cute/sexy ? ~ ~, 
  what are the main complications from being albino ? 
  i already know about the whole skin problem with the sun but i also heard that it can be hard to see or that the eyes can be rather weak . 
  also , is there anything cool that ever happened to you due to your albinism ? 
  without saying much , i would like it if the politicians in the us would stop seeing the arab league/middle east and notice their lovely latin neighbors . 
  ~ ~ mostly us , to be honest . ~ ~, 
  as of current , more than 70,000 people are dead due to the ongoing war against drugs . 
  more than 100 journalists have been murdered or kidnapped while trying to say the truth . 
  [ bloggers who have been doing nothing but to warn their people to keep them out of harm have been kidnapped and decapitated as a way to deter people from using the social medias as an aid ] ( http://www.laht.com/article.asp?articleid=442210&amp;categoryid=14091 ) . 
  it is understandable that the [ war on terror ] \u2122 \u00a9 is very important and there are reasons to be so , but you can not simply ignore how just next to you there is a country bleeding slowly to death . 
  a bit of tending and nurture - not infiltration - can do a great change . 
  those are just my thoughts . 
  \\* shrug \\* i ca n't say i expect something to happen but , it is good to let it know what 's going on . 
  * `` truth is , after all , is the most valuable asset in the world . 
  wow , that 's indeed an interesting fact .
