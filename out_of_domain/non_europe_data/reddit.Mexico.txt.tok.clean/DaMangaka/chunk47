  it is sad history books forget these `` little '' details . 
  little because aparently you where small in comparison with the main 5 allies . 
  truth to be told is that there are many facts for the victory or defeat of a country , not just it 's raw power . 
  i will take a look on this , thanks so much : d, 
  la coahuila is calling you man . 
  dear goddesses , where to start . 
  i have watched anime as young as 5 years old but i had * no * idea where the cartoons came from . 
  i assumed that they where either from the united states ( under a different style ) or mexican ( specially dragon ball z which has become such a part of our culture that people would actually vote for goku on the past elections . ), 
  so , my godfather was actually who corrected me and told me that it came from the magical land of japan and that the kind of drawings i was doing where ` manga ' . 
  thus began my magical quest to become a manga-ka ~ ~ and under my standards i am so fair flailing ~ ~ . 
  not only did i want to admire the whole anime culture , but my dad used to work for sony , so i had certain books on japanese manufacturing clauses , rules and culture ; japanese culture in general and history ; japanese geography . 
  this just made my interest pike more and forget learning russian ( this is a long story actually ) and decide to learn japanese on my own . 
  i was 11 when i took the decision and so far i have not only learned the language ( somewhat , my kanji is horrible and while my pronunciation is ok i have problems making coherent sentences at times ) , but i know how to bow properly , making and differences the different types of dishes - soba , udon , teriyaki , tamagoyaki , etc - all in a certain hope of not just fangasming on japanese stuff , but immerse myself fully . 
  i do not think i can stop being a gaijin ever , nor that i will reach the level of respect as many of the real japanese manga-ka but japan will always have a place in my heart as the land that brought to me so many things in life . 
  ** now , as what i want ** i. . 
  . actually want all that candy ( + a + it 's so pretty and delicious ) but items are pike my interest ( i saw a limit of \uffe5 1,000 - \uffe5 2,000 , da ? ),

  i 'm not sure what to say about it . 
  can any englisman tell me what i 'm supposed to do with it ? 
  \u266b i 've got a lovely bunch of coconuts , tereleedee . 
  before i clicked your link , i knew what you where talking about . 
  good job xd, 
  double check your address always , and make sure it has the apt . 
  number . 
  this is our story , the story of how my so and i waited for books but never came due to the blasted apt . 
  number . 
  so here we are , she needs some books for a class on monday and i notice both the books she needs are available to ship on ** saturday **, 
  that 's awesome - we say - and promptly order them . 
  saturday came . 
  . nothing, 
  we contacted amazon about it via live chat after we noticed there was no changes on ups and how it had arrived at the city but was n't delivered . 
  deciding not to hassle too much , we decided to make it a pick-up at the ups store . 
  when we called them to check the status on their side , we asked if we could make it deliverable and why it could n't be delivered . 
  so , according to them , amazon did not provide the apt . 
  number . 
  we were pissed . 
  though , i did n't demand them for a refund on the price of the shipping due to me going to the addresses i have stored and noticing it 's was n't there . 
  i was sure i did add it but also remembered that amazon loves to standardize mail addresses . 
  so it could be that too . 
  or really i just indeed forget it . 
  so , from our experiences learn to :, 
  * ** double check your address ** . 
  you can still change it before it ships , so if you can , do it . 
  once it 's shipped , amazor nor ups/fedex will help and they do n't care . 
  * if the address is wrong or misses something , your best bet so it 's not delivered a date later or returned is to have the ups office to hold it for you . 
  it 's your best bet . 
  * consult both ups/amazon on shipping problems . 
  edit : and now i realize that i replied with the wrong answer ... 
  i thought it was `` something you 've learned from using amazon '' . 
  so , that 's that ... 
  on what i want to learn thanks to amazon , is to better my coloring skills . 
  . ~ ~ meep ~ ~, 
  over-the-stove popcorn . 
  not only it has fiber but with some olive oil and salt it 's delicious . 
  you can customize it to what you want and plain is rather nice too . 
  it 's delicious and actually helps you feel full so you do n't eat more . 
  sometimes , people ca n't sleep due to hunger . 
  popcorn kills hunger , fills your tummy and your tummy does n't feel all heavy , making it easier for you to sleep . 
  on quicker and better methods , lavander tea . 
  it knocks you down rather pleasantly . 
  i was about to post . 
  but considering there are real needs out there , i 'm just going to wish the other posters good luck . 
  i am lucky to know that i have a stable job ( for now ) and place to live . 
  better give that chance to those that really want it . 
  yes you are doing this right . 
  that is how you reply . 
  good luck, 
  i ca n't exactly say right now because it can spoil things . 
  wait some 20 minutes more . 
  you won !, 
  lol , random.org ? 
  interesting way . 
  what is it that you wish , master ? 
  ; ; ; how do you know if i 'm buying it for you ? 
  on my `` ships to '' options i do n't see to you . 
  it already ended , sorry ^ ^ ;, 
  sadly , yes . 
  do n't worry , you can try again later on another contest . 
  probably by my next contract renewal ( around in july ? ), 
  number e ? 
  ~ ~ no , wait , that 's to big , is n't it ? ~ ~, 
  i 'll go with the mad hatter 's 10/6,

  ** holy fuck i knew i should n't have left that closet open ... **, 
  \\* panics stupidly \\*, 
  what i 'm going to do is to go to that store up where i live and ** buy all the japanese food ** i can and stuff my face because it 's both a `` screw you , i can do what i want '' and finally drown myself in ** popcorn ** . 
  then . 
  i should probably just go and close the closet before it releases the black hole inside .
