  . i should probably do that first . 
  or run away here . 
  nobody goes here ] ( http://www.amazon.com/hetalia-powers-russian-passport-notebook/dp/b004ud3q72/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pc_s_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=idth00x7wz2e2 ), 
  what did i just watch ? 
  xd ; ; ; dear goddesses , that 's an interesting thing . 
  tell him that i said `` teach me , master '', 
  my family lives way on the south . 
  it takes a 2 hour flight but needs a lot of planning . 
  my grandmother from my mom 's side seems ok but from my dad 's side , stuff is starting to look on decline . 
  he 's hoping to go and see her on december , on the holidays . 
  my parent 's family is a bit complicated and well worthy of a telenovela but it 's in the end united . 
  they always go and take me to buy sea food and stuff like that . 
  it 's cool . 
  i can only hope that the problems get solved . 
  i also have family on the states but . 
  my dad 's niece seems not to like the one 's in mexico . 
  it 's complicated . 
  again , part of the novela . 
  on regards of the item , [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/hetalia-powers-russian-passport-notebook/dp/b004ud3q72/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pc_s_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=idth00x7wz2e2 ) should be cheap enough . 
  though you can always choose [ this other ] ( http://www.amazon.com/copic-sketch-marker-colorless-blender/dp/b000qixnp0/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pc_s_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=i8ukh8uf37dbu ) one instead . 
  the world might seem gray , but with a little gradation , you can bring lots ' of color, 
  [ suddenly this . 
  over-the-stove popcorn is my best choice . 
  when you are starting , you can tend to over eat . 
  popcorn helps you diminish that by making you feel full quicker . 
  also , it 's rich in fiber = v = b, 
  on the topic of actual food : udon . 
  that stuff is amazing . 
  my someone special is so . 
  i tend to be inclined to depression ( and the interesting part here is she is too ) , but somehow she 's able to rescue me from my moments of darkness . 
  we 've been able to learn from each other and i dare to say that every moment that goes on , i just realize that she 's my one . 
  she 's very patient with little impulsive me . 
  while we may clash this only shows us our openness to our different opinions which i appreciate . 
  i had the feeling that in relationships `` you need to be nice with your so and thus comply '' which i do n't like , but knowing that i do n't have to go on that facade makes it even better . 
  we trust each other everything and that 's more than i can ask for . 
  speaking of ask , special heads up to my friend of all life who while tends to have a poker face all the time , allows to express myself fully without being picky or hurting . 
  he is my pillar , and i 'm sure i would n't have gone far without him . 
  it does n't seem like he does much , but trust me , if i have to thank for being able to keep me sane enough to go on this journey that is life , that would be him . 
  you know , we could do a drawing exchange . 
  i love those kind of things  v <, 
  i know the feeling bro . 
  though , i do n't remember if we ever made into the world news . 
  guess we are much tamer than you ? 
  fancy ingredients for cooking meals ( according to my parents , though i do like to buy stuff to make authentic japanese or european food . 
  organic is better though that of course rises the prices ) . 
  that or pokemon figurines and plushies < _ <, 
  i swear that they are addictive . 
  if you check the ovas , be sure to check the abridged series by team four star . 
  they update every halloween ( 3 eps so far ) , but 's epic and hilarious . 
  and interestingly , very close to the plot . 
  i 'm an old school anime person . 
  have n't watched many of the new anime ~ ~ though i 'm obsessed with hetalia , even though i want to make it darker and edgier in my fanfics ~ ~ but i can give you some good recommendations on anime i 've watched . 
  - death note, 
  - saint seiya ( original series , though they tell me `` other canvas '' is good too ), 
  = v = b, 
  the pokemon black and white 2 collection cd is awesome !, 
  it includes the soundtrack from emerald which makes it even more epic . 
  another one i like is the kof 2002 soundtrack . 
  i do n't know if it 's called like that , but 's rather cool . 
  mexican here . 
  simple but delicious guacamole recipe ( the kind you find on tacos around here ) :, 
  - tomatoes, 
  - onion, 
  - cilantro leaves, 
  - jalape\u00f1o ( if you are into spicy things ), 
  - salt and lime juice to taste, 
  dice the onions and tomatoes into small squares - though does n't have to be that small , it 's up to you how much . 
  wash the cilantro and chop it well . 
  you can also just take off the leaves and use them as that . 
  slice the jalape\u00f1os in half to take the seeds ( or do n't take them , you saddist spicy bastard t wt ; ) and then dice finely . 
  ** remember to wash your hands thoroughly if you dice the jalape\u00f1o ** . 
  ~ ~ only * you * can prevent crotch fires . ~ ~, 
  mash the avocados and mix them with the diced ingredients . 
  add lime and salt . 
  the lime actually works to not only give flavor , but to keep the avocado fresh for a longer time ( aka wo n't get brown so quickly ) . 
  serve with chips or in a tortilla . 
  it 's rather fresh if you ask me , though i tend to get overboard with the lime . 
  i ca n't help it , i love lime + n + < 3, 
  i want to be a great artist , but not only for myself and just greatness . 
  art can show many things , many stories that lie behind the process and creative thought of the actual message or picture you want to trace . 
  lately , art has become to commercial . 
  it no longer helps to aid the artist to express him/herself nor the recipient to have a small moment of introspect . 
  this whole link is being destroyed , and it 's sad . 
  i would give a whole long * 8 hour * speech of art and the link to the human soul , the connection created and how to recover what seems to be lost due the imposition of a monetary value . 
  * speaking of monetary value * . 
  [ i 'd like this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/prismacolor-verithin-colored-pencils-36/dp/b000mk9ywi/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_s_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=i14lvqr4ycvq7i ), 
  so , you say that if i post here with `` show me the gift ! '', 
  i 'll be able to win something ? 
  sounds cool : d, 
  thanks for doing this . 
  you know , i find this to be not fair . 
  we are both border cities . 
  stuff circulate on these two parts ( legally and illegally ) . 
  why not care for both ? 
  alas , our government is retarded . 
  we 'd be better off being ruled by a baby . 
  i just hope things are much better over there . 
  sending lots of hugs from a border city to another . 
  i usually go for 1 lime per avocado . 
  then i go nuts and go 1 lime per avocado * half *,
