  in essence , he had become the all mighty . 
  in all sort of logic , though , he had become nothing . 
  stranded in a vacant world which could be full of possibilities were not the fact that he had no grasp of them . 
  no knowledge of them . 
  he was alone . 
  her words echoed on the distance , bittersweet remnants of the memory of what she once was . 
  `` the world in which you live , once you take down the scraps , is made out of loneliness . 
  you are a singularity among others , souls so close yet so unreachable . 
  they are born free but soon are encapsulated , unable to escape the reality of their biggest secret : you are nothing . 
  just an event , a happening . 
  a happening that grows important by the memoirs attached to that one person . 
  were it not for those memories , that person would mean nothing to you . 
  it would only be part of the scenery in which you existence roams alone . '', 
  . lone . 
  he had recreated his surroundings neatly after an eternity or two . 
  he had challenged the very laws of physics , created his own . 
  he could indeed understand them , he knew how to play with them . 
  but could he understand the human soul ? 
  what is a soul ? 
  [ [ \u25ba ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfpmnill5pq&amp;list=rd02oap0w0-amdu ) ], 
  the swings that could never be used . 
  the houses that would never host people . 
  the cities that would have no movement . 
  everything was still . 
  it was a perfect and eerie peace . 
  could he ever understand death ? 
  so far he tried , he could n't . 
  he solely remained with his thoughts that began to clear his mind of other things . 
  `` so is this what it means to be a god ? '', 
  he held the dummy that reminded him of what he lost . 
  people . 
  her . 
  what is a sun without anybody to shine upon ? . 
  one must remember that in the vast universe , a star is only but a mere dot in the darkness of eternity . 
  i saw your pablo neruda books and gabriel garcia and i actually squealed . 
  i 'm happy to see somebody wants to read them . 
  hmm , since you are into them , i would suggest you take a look at this [ first book ] ( http://www.amazon.com/tierra-firme-matilde-asensi/dp/8408007165/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1367516273&amp;sr=1-5 ) from a saga i 'm reading . 
  it 's awesome and makes you understand certain aspects of spain back in the days . 
  as for what i 'd like , i would be happy if you 'd get me [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/prismacolor-graphite-drawing-set/dp/b001bypro8/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=in1sx6rhl4dgr ),

  more than meet , i 'd like to have a long chat with nikola telsa . 
  he did so many things . 
  i want to know and discern his mind . 
  that guy was indeed a genius !, 
  sad the way he had to go . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/copic-multiliner-four-pack-set/dp/b0025tx1au/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_s_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=i17f3qla6w5l60 ) is the item that fits my fancy 0 v 0, 
  everyone knows that garfiel loves lasagna !,

  it 's . 
  . dead . 
  i like to create stories in any media possible . 
  when i listen to a song , see a scenery , have something happen to me , read a book . . anything , my mind begins to create a scenario where i can make a cast of characters and have a small little world for them . 
  it can be from my own mind or inspired on what i 'm seeing . 
  then it just runs rampant and somehow becomes sentient . 
  it 's something to behold . 
  . . on the normal side , i love cooking . 
  the more exotic , the better . 
  though i also like simplicity like popcorn with salt and lime . 
  also , i like to just go outside and get lost in my city . 
  it feels like i 'm having an adventure and fuels again the whole story making in my head . 
  it 's a vicious cycle xd ;, 
  i sadly ca n't say i can dream vividly . 
  according to my parents , when they manage to get into my room while i am sleeping they say that i am like in bliss and laughing even !, 
  i ca n't know why because i ca n't remember damn it !, 
  but , it goes to a point where i 'm able to ` project ' the scenarios in my mind like if it was a movie . 
  i have dozens of ` scenes ' that play when a specific song comes in mind and it 's really awesome but makes me loose my sense of reality and time . 
  kind of freaky but in the end very awesome . 
  that 's why i say music is my drug : gives me a hell of a trip ( also the reason why in my `` drawing supplies '' there are some bluetooth headphones thrown in there xd ), 
  they are really popular here in mexico . 
  could get some for you but i 'm pretty sure it 'll be lat . 
  spanish without subs or japanese with spanish subs . 
  there are some fansubs around , that can work too . 
  the good part is that both are uncensored . 
  the fans where pissed off with what they did with dbz kai ( new voice actor , more censorship , etc ) that they did n't watch the series . 
  anime is srs business here xd ;, 
  i 'm proud i have managed to keep a job for more than 3 months . 
  and i hope to reach the year 0 70 < 3, 
  the best place to be : raoa, 
  i could make a sort of company out of it ~ ~ oh wait . 
  indeed xd, 
  though , here dbz is so popular that on the `` write other options '' box in the voting ballot for president , people put goku on . 
  kind of funny, 
  i call her my luv burrito . 
  . am just going to go over there and hide in the corner, 
  no jillsandwich ? 
  yes, 
  it was the best and worst of days .
