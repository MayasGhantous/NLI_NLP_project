  actually , in my wishlist you can find a [ durable sturdy journal ] ( http://www.amazon.com/moleskine-plain-notebook-large/dp/8883701143/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=i1n9xzwap3o65 ) to do exactly that . 
  works for drawing * and * work stuff . 
  and it has a small pocket on the end . 
  great for some receipts and sleeves . 
  rain ?

  ~ ~ i do n't know if i have already posted this here , so sorry ; ; ; ~ ~, 
  let 's do it + v +, 
  i plan to release a book or some sort of story called `` hurricane of passion '' ( the cheesy name is intentional ) . 
  it focus my mom and dad ( whose stories also fit actually ) , but of course my family would be involved . 
  wonder what they might think ~ ~ hope they just do n't ask for money ; ; ~ ~, 
  same : /, 
  i 'm trying to save 10,000 usd to open a business down here , but the power of the internet makes me go `` ugnghtfh !,

  ~ ~ his first name is agent ~ ~, 
  i did n't exactly have a class like that in my university classes ( this being a degree in graphic design ) but one of our teachers always told us to give sense to things , even if it 's a marketable thing ( as it is a design ) . 
  he was the best teacher i had really . 
  to be honest , many things need to be done with care and interest . 
  everything now is mass production and mindless buying . 
  it 's destructive at least . 
  no xd ;, 
  just added that . 
  we have been with many doctors when she gets that but none really can come up as to what causes her illnesses . 
  every time she begins vomiting my mom practically drags her to get her some medical exams but it all comes well . 
  we 've tried changing her diet , even going to an homeopathic , natural medicine and stuff . 
  may not be related but she barely has her cycles on going . 
  i am not sure if it 's a psychological problem in the end but . 
  yeah . 
  well , fine , you caught me : / . 
  it did fainted though ... 
  now we can both suffer together = v =, 
  no manches , in peso del 1er imperio .
