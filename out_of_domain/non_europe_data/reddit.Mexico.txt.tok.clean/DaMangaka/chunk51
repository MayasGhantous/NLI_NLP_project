  not that much otz ;, 
  not entering , just here to put my taco stand on this thread while you sing all drunkwardly . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  neta ? 
  some still wear mustaches though : p, 
  they should bring a truck loaded with amps , a light set and play some fucking slayer on them . 
  then host a small concert-memorial . 
  \\ m / \\ m /, 
  indeed . 
  no need to change that xd, 
  omg . 
  i just realized until now that i was in one of these lists . 
  thank you so much !, 
  finally , i 'll be able to get my first copic marker * and * blend with the ones i have ; v ; < 33, 
  [ i present you a chandelure painting made in paint . 
  * fromthepagesof is a pokemon master *, 
  would get kidnapped and controlled by kittens again . 
  maybe you have n't heard of him ~ ~ which you should since he 's awesome ~ ~ but my favorite underdog hero ~ ~ which only makes him greater . 
  i mean , look at that title . 
  underdog !, 
  that means he 's humble enough to allow others take a moment to shine . 
  that 's heroic material there ya know ? ~ ~ is buster gold . 
  oh , somebody else has mentioned him ? 
  ~ ~ just shows how lovable he is , does n't it ? ~ ~ but what really makes me like this guy is that he 's perhaps the most humane superhero i know . 
  you know how they are all `` truth and justice '' and all that mumbo-jumbo prepackaged thing ? 
  buster shows that even a jerk can become a hero of their own right . 
  not to mention his adventures are unique in their own . 
  as for my wishlist item , [ i 'd love this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/axis-powers-hetalia-figures-japan/dp/b0070x7sby/ref=wl_it_dp_v_s_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=2serrbc122gjw&amp;coliid=ihtei8b3xris3 ), 
  i 've shipped things from the us to europe and they arrive in around a week . 
  that 's fast compared to the fact that if i send a * postcard * from mexico to usa , it takes ** 3 freaking weeks **, 
  it 's just a small piece of paper , what 's the whole fuzz about it ?!, 
  this is why i never use addresses from mexico to receive/send packages/stuff . 
  one of the advantages of living at the border . 
  i 've said it many times but 's ok : p ~ ~ i love to ~ ~, 
  over the stove popcorn with lime juice , a bit of olive oil and salt . 
  if you want something fresher , some romaine lettuce with home made cesar salad dressing = v = b, 
  where 's the amber room ? 
  dear goddesses !, 
  do want !!, 
  thanks for this !, 
  i 'll save it on my one note cook book, 
  ; ; v ; ; i want those biscuits . 
  they are so pretty . 
  and delicious . 
  i have been 4 months in a job , the most i have gone so far after 2 years of nothing . 
  i 'm flabbergasted : d, 
  now that 's what i call a gifttrain, 
  all aboard !, 
  * applauds and throws confetti * congratulations !, 
  not really . 
  in my experience , all you need is to look good , look confident and most importantly ** do n't give more info than needed ** . 
  seriously , do n't . 
  if you start rambling about stuff , the interviewer might grow a bit tired of you or worse : if you expose your abilities too soon , they might be worried they might have their own jobs on the line . 
  so , if they ask you `` what color is the sky ? '', 
  just answer `` blue '' . 
  no details , no nothing unless they tell you . 
  it 's a bit tricky but sometimes showing yourself as the very best is not such a good idea . 
  also , if it 's your first job , do n't be disheartened if you get a lower pay than expected . 
  work yourself up and you 'll be in a better position in no time . 
  hope these ti-bits help you . 
  from your friendly crazy pigeon , da mangaka \\ = 7 = /, 
  ~ ~ ps : i know . 
  i was 2 years jobless . 
  not to bad but . 
  . one * really * learns later the meaning of having money ~ ~, 
  . . does this mean you are * not * a ghost ? 
  i do n't really mind spoilers . 
  actually , that makes me more interested and excited . 
  `` oh , x did a and then went with y to z '', 
  my mind immediately goes `` holy crap !, 
  how ? '', 
  sometimes , i get disappointed at how it was * not * how i expected . 
  my own mind creates a story around the spoiler and i get angry when it does n't go that way . 
  when you see a ti-bit , it 's like tasting a cake . 
  the taste is delicious and you want more . 
  but once i see the whole cake , i might get disgusted or eat it more . 
  \\* shrug \\*, 
  my dad does n't like pets in the house and my mom is allergic, 
  also , i 'm too far away . 
  d'aww , puppies : '' (, 
  we could call the ghostbusters, 
  i think i now have a reason to get me a ups mailbox . 
  that 's awesome !, 
  random title thrown : the devil wears prada or mamma mia, 
  . those are . 
  pretty much the movies repeating each other over and over on my house . 
  that and sleepless in seattle . 
  0.5 for quick `` what ever ' sketches . 
  0.7 for the real deal . 
  though , also you must note that you will do that kind of soft coloring which vanishes your pencil lines as you color with prismas , it 's best to have 0.5 . 
  in my bag , though , you 'll always find a 0.7 , a fine point pen , a quad-tip pen and an eraser . 
  did you by any chance buy those in canc\u00fan ? 
  what is mla format ? 
  hope you are swell : d, 
  you 'll find yourself wrapped in this magical land that is raoa . 
  be sure to stop by the contests that they hold here . 
  you 'll have lots of fun !, 
  do you by any chance collect dresses ? 
  /  / : | so it 's just . 
  . fancy writing .
