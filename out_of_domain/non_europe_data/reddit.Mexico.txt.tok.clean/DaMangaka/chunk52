  yeah , i only used it once for a class in university and that was `` investigation methodology '' where we had to write essays 20 pages long . 
  i think that teacher means 2 pages . 
  using mla for 2 paragraphs is rather pointless . 
  care to give me your paypal e-mail in a pm ? 
  [ this much ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l91isfcuzdw ), 
  ok , maybe not . 
  . but perhaps some $ 452.76 usd ? 
  amazon eats up my money ( or it 's starting to ), 
  i know it is , but the other option is to hire a housekeeper . 
  i mean , it 's mostly just to take off their constant need to be cleaning the house . 
  not sure , but i hope it 's soon . 
  nice . 
  have an upvote sir . 
  , i 'm gathering pictures . 
  check them soon : d, 
  winter is coming . 
  does almost crashing with stan lee counts ? 
  i also met the `` ancient aliens '' guy . 
  i have a picture if you want me to show it off to ya . 
  my so lives in texas and i 'm stuck at the west coast . 
  i do tend to sleep off my sadness , though . 
  i probably should right now . 
  i do too , but right now i want to get around 10,000 usd to open my own business . 
  it 's going to be hard ( given that 1 usd = 11.70 pesos ) , but if i am constant , i 'm sure i can make it . 
  that 's what is keeping me up going . 
  that 's so adorable : '' ), 
  i do n't like to drink and i do n't think they would let me . 
  i stopped caring about my birthdays after i turned 20 . 
  every year is a reminder of how old i am and how little i have acomplished . 
  i tend to celebrate them alone , therefore . 
  alone is best, 
  but my room is clean . 
  and my house . 
  to be honest , i do n't understand how cleaner it can be . 
  they clean it every day . 
  it 's annoying . 
  adagio of strings, 
  can i ride it ? 
  i have 5 playlists for the stories i 'm writing . 
  i tend to play each every single day at work . 
  it actually helps me get over my day though half way the list i begin to get too inspired and forget about me being at work ; ;, 
  a dangerous thing to do . 
  i can link if you want : p, 
  at work . 
  `` working '' ? 
  a wacom tablet . 
  it was a bamboo , but the intention is what matters . 
  i still have my little one close , though i wish i had more time to spend on it drawing than working or . 
  cleaning : (, 
  run . 
  run away and never return . 
  \\* twitch \\* must . 
  . . resist . 
  urge . 
  to add them . . to . 
  . wishlist . 
  \\* waves pon-pons and makes some odd cheerleader thing \\*, 
  wow !, 
  awesome !, 
  congratulations : d \\* more pon-pon waving \\*, 
  the world cup is . 
  . a comedy-tragedy thing for me . 
  right now , mexico fucking sucks . 
  what the fuck happens with our team anyways ? 
  the sub-17 and sub-20 are awesome . 
  heck , they won gold medal on the olympics last year . 
  why the fuck do they always get these disappointing results on the world cup ? 
  we never seem to be able to break the curse of the final 16 . 
  i might just go and cheer for germany again t _ t ; ; ;, 
  they should stop whoring on chicharito . 
  he 's good but he wo n't suddenly make miracles and stuff . . . 
  therefore , i like myself = v = < 3, 
  ; v ; i wish i could but i 'm working, 
  though , i got my day cheered already = v =, 
  thanks so much to you all . 
  ~ ~ also , it 's been freaking * cloudy * . 
  we are at may . 
  y u cloudy ? ~ ~, 
  try to bulk up some cash and resources before you make a contest . 
  i had times where i have to hold on my impulses to give everyone gifts but with how i am getting paid i sadly ca n't give myself the luxury of spending . 
  before giving stuff to people , first comes you . 
  if you are good , then you will be much better when giving stuff . 
  i wish i could add a house in my wishlist . 
  a nice cozy place to live = v =, 
  ~ ~ or tickets to comic-con ~ ~, 
  my humble request , meanwhile , would be [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/sanford-1786520-prismacolor-premier-sharpener/dp/b004zdl0k2/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pc_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=i9723w5yj7psq ), 
  the ravens are a fine team , but no better than new england : p, 
  \\* braces self \\*, 
  sleep . 
  i freaking love sleep . 
  other than that , i listen to music and eat popcorn . 
  all that `` don goyo '' can do really is to spit some smoke . 
  that 's all it does when it wakes up . 
  so far , nobody 's been hurt . 
  do n't worry . 
  my paycheck . 
  . . take it . 
  do more . 
  well , it 's not disappointing per-se but .
