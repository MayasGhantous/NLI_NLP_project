  on my 20th birthday , my father got me [ one of these ] ( http://www.joseibi.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/skechers_shapeups_fitnessjunkie.jpg ) . 
  i did n't mind since i was indeed trying to get in shape though i am not exactly fan of receiving clothes and shoes , less on my birthday out of all days . 
  i thanked him and kind of used them around the house . 
  one day , i decided to put them on to go to work since i wanted to use them instead of my old pair of tennis which my dad poked me on how old they were or how i did n't use the new ones from my birthday . 
  so , to kill two birds with a stone , on i go with them . 
  it 's fine since i worked for customer service and that meant i had to stay sit for almost all day . 
  however , lunch time arrived and i needed to eat something quick . 
  problem is that the closest convenience store ( i worked the night shift ) was 30 minutes from where i was . 
  guess how long i had to eat ? 
  1 hour . 
  that meant go there , get back and i 'd find some 5 minutes to eat . 
  so , i gather enough courage and power to start * running * towards the convenience store and just half way the route i * fell down and twisted an ankle *, 
  you 'd think that anybody would come down to help , but this was pretty much the middle of nowhere , at 8pm in the night . 
  will this desist my quest : fuck no . 
  instead , i gather enough courage to stand up and go * limping * to the convenience store . 
  i buy my food and then i * start going back on a foot to my workplace * . 
  i managed to get back with some 10 minutes left in my lunch break . 
  after a while , i got worried that it was n't just a normal sprain and i told a co-worked if it looked bad . 
  upon seeing his shocked face , i realized it was time to call mum and pick me up . 
  mom was shocked too and rushed me to the hospital where it turned out to be a joint dislocation . 
  the doctor was rather impressed i did n't fracture ( `` with your weight , i assumed you would have it fractured '' ) . 
  fortunately , we had insurance , but i ca n't stop chuckling at remembering the face and smirk i gave to him after he saw me . 
  `` love the shoes btw '' . 
  this all happened 1 week before christmas . 
  due to some shabby issues at work that i perceived , i never returned back ( i actually wanted to quit but did n't find the courage since that meant be called a ` lazy blob ' back at home ) . 
  since then , i 've never used the shoes nor they have given me physical gifts . 
  just a nice restaurant get-away or a gift card . 
  lately , though , i 've been celebrating my birthdays alone . 
  but 's ok i guess \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  the item i want is [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/hetalia-powers-russian-passport-notebook/dp/b004ud3q72/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pc_s_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=idth00x7wz2e2 ), 
  i kind of realized on my own by my 11th christmas when i had not received my nintendo 64 and everyone did . 
  i even stated concisely in my last card how i had worked hard with my grades ( i even attached my latest score card with a + + / 10.0 ) and therefore deserved a nintendo 64 . 
  well , nope , but that guy whose score averaged c - got one . 
  so did the other neighbor . 
  and the other . 
  then i thought it was either bullshit or mom/dad forced him not to give me my precious 64 . 
  now i have one , but barely play it because there 's only 1 tv and if i * dare * plug that thing i 'm ` wasting my time ' and should go outside to do something productive . 
  my only mess is my blanket in the morning which i forget to tidy . 
  that 's it . 
  yet , i got a rant about it . 
  folding the freaking blanket does n't make my bed suddenly clean \u10da\u0ca0\u76ca\u0ca0 ) \u10da, 
  if i have bed-bugs or roaches or what ever they say that i 'd get for not doing so , then the whole folding the blanket is pointless . 
  he 's going to buy a new house to move in . 
  and do the stuff as suggested on the other comments . 
  why not ? 
  you can do lots of stuff at your own house ; ), 
  [ [ item ] ( http://www.amazon.com/prismacolor-verithin-colored-pencils-36/dp/b000mk9ywi/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pc_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=i14lvqr4ycvq7i ) ], 
  squishmonster = 7 = ~ < 3, 
  at least . 
  it 's cheaper than a house . 
  i 'd * gladly * take those $ 20usd for the job . 
  shoot me up a pm . 
  i 'm interested in working for you . 
  i 'll become a volunteer t wt ;, 
  the artist in me has dragged me in here . 
  i shall do as commanded !, 
  this is [ quite interesting ] ( http://www.amazon.com/sanford-1786520-prismacolor-premier-sharpener/dp/b004zdl0k2/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pc_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=i9723w5yj7psq ), 
  why is it interesting ? 
  well , apparently this thing can do miracles . 
  i want to see that myself . 
  damn !, 
  you beat me to him xd, 
  speaking of parents : my own parent 's excessive need of cleanliness . 
  today i shall take a photo of when i arrive home to explain a bit further , but they always say that the whole house is dirty and needs to be cleaned . 
  i know that a nice house is a clean house but the way they have it - imno - rather excessive , specifically on my dad 's side . 
  \\* sigh \\*, 
  might seem like cheating but . 
  write everything down in a flash card . 
  no , seriously , do it . 
  preferably some hours before the exam . 
  then , put them away . 
  what 's the idea behind this ? 
  you see , your brain will have it 's thoughts scattered and the whole idea of making a ` cheating ' flash card helps it to set things together for the task needed . 
  even if you did bring the flashcard , most of the time you 'll find out you do n't need it . 
  take it as a flash-study method . 
  hope this helps you : d, 
  wow !, 
  you look stunning already !, 
  just with the wig !, 
  you 're going to be a great poison ivy : d, 
  i actually won something ? 
  o a o !!, 
  thanks so much ; v ; < 333, 
  one of us ... one of us ... 
  i can confirm that indeed op is a fag, 
  do n't get surprised when they do not reply you fast after receiving it : they 'll probably be busy trying to find waldo/wally xd, 
  miles : 25,000, 
  congratulations on graduating !, 
  that 's quite a huge step !, 
  hoping for the best !, 
  i 'm too shameful to buy stuff for myself . 
  i 'm a bit afraid of being poked at how i waste my money on stuff like plushies or that kind . 
  most of the time , i spend it on going to eat to good restaurants or get some ingredients for my `` super ultra fancy '' food as my parents call it . 
  i like to gift more . 
  the cesar salad was made in my city , which is tijuana . 
  also the margarita . 
  there 's also a famous tradition of having [ donkeys painted as zebras called `` zonkeys '' ] ( http://imagenes.sandiegored.com/uploads/news/photos/news_photo_25030_1336850913_630.jpg ) . 
  it costs 2 usd to take a photo with them . 
  while americans * love * to take photos with these elusive creatures , 95 % of the locals have said to * never * have done so . 
  i really feel better at giving than taking .
