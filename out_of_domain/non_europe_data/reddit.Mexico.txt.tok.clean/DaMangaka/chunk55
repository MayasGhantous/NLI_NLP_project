  it 's ridiculous and it diminishes the quality of education , cramming you with useless things only for the sake of sapping more money out of you . 
  and those classes that are essential they are thought half-assed . 
  confession time : i do n't know how to design a webpage , i 'm leaning on my own . 
  mostly because coding for me has been hard but also because our teacher though us web design by * using templates from dreamweaver * . 
  really ? 
  is that how we 'll be working irl ? 
  using templates idiots can download from as cheap as 5 usd ? 
  are you diminishing our quality for that ? 
  frigg you !, 
  / end rant . 
  to answer two questions :, 
  how ? 
  we went to bk for our ` reward ' burger ( if we did good on the week , dad would take us to eat burgers . 
  mom hates fast food with a passion , so we ` sinned ' on fridays . ), 
  and ordered the standard kids meal . 
  next monday , i come to school and my teacher gasps at how pale and * yellow * i am . 
  upon taking some blood tests ( from which i died ; ;  and taking in consideration * obvious * symptoms , the doctor concluded i indeed had it . 
  it was around valentine 's day . 
  the next two weeks were the best ever , as i laid on the bed with a bucket full of pink lemonade ice-cream . 
  best.illness.ever . 
  why did n't you sue ? / tell a comment to the place ? / did something about bk ? 
  2 ) in the land that is mexico , it is * not * easy nor affordable to sue a big company for ` little ' things like these . 
  besides , it was n't that bad ( for me ) and i have quite an immune system . 
  from that day , though , we stopped going to bk and eating burgers for almost a year . 
  then we discovered in-n-out . 
  when i do n't cross the border , i eat at carl 's jr. . delicious < 3, 
  is it in the united states ? 
  anybody really . 
  \\* rubs arm \\* i . 
  kind of want to meet more people to hang out with irl . 
  mine that i 'm an odd ball that likes to collect colors like crazy . 
  if you got good scores at school and you finished college well , you 'd land a nice job . 
  . \\* siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh \\*, 
  i 'm on reddit while i work ? 
  does that count ? 
  maybe i can help with a random song ( since i 'd need a scanner to scan pictures ), 
  spanish is my native tongue . 
  i am not in ma ... 
  welp , another one i ca n't apply on . 
  good luck in your quest : ), 
  by the time i was halfway my degree , the fucks i could give were gone . 
  i still ended with a 89 as final score . 
  most of it was so that i kept my scholarship and my parents happy . 
  i really got disappointed at that school , and it 's sadly promoted as the best there is in the region . 
  the worst part is that when fetching a job , people will regard this school as an excellent place and disregard other things or public schools . 
  it sucks . 
  sunflower , sunflower . 
  tall stalk that shines bright . 
  smiles given in summer, 
  until fall gives us new life . 
  are you large single flower, 
  or a basket of sunshine ? 
  a proof that small ideas, 
  big dreams can become, 
  you are a fighter, 
  drought is a challenge, 
  rain does n't sway you, 
  in the end just staying, 
  always smiling , always happy . 
  sunflower , tell me, 
  what is your secret ? 
  how can i grow as tall as you ? 
  how can i become as lovable ? 
  for now i shall smile . 
  knowing that perhaps from that, 
  another one of your sisters it might become . 
  apparently this is common on bk and mcdonald 's : /, 
  i do n't know how they operate . 
  this comes from somebody used to eat at street taco stands on thursdays . 
  they are the best tacos in existence . 
  the . 
  . least mexican place in mexico , i might say . 
  we still have tacos , but people prefer burgers and buy their stuff in san diego . 
  i 'm guilty of that too : stuff is much cheaper there , even if half of it we manufacture it . 
  quite an irony back when i worked on foxconn to see the tv models you worked on at walmart at 1200 usd when in tijuana you 'd see that tv much later and at 3 times the price . 
  \\* sigh \\*, 
  ergh . 
  that `` rated e '' looks different than the other ones ; ;, 
  you might have landed with a fake ; ;, 
  that explains why . 
  that 's among mom 's `` no-no '' food . 
  food that is n't considered as such in my house . 
  a place to call my own . 
  i 'm on the same boat sadly . 
  i get out at 5pm pst, 
  that 's a long time . 
  `` i 'll see you later '', 
  i 'm almost out ( t - 1 hr ) and it 's already slow for me @ n@;, 
  you know . 
  we should make our * own * contest , with blackjack and hookers . 
  actually , let 's forget about the contest . 
  i only have one answer : muse . 
  dear goddesses . 
  . what they have done to my mind is just . 
  incredible . 
  their music , their tunes , their ambiance . 
  it has helped me a lot in creating stories . 
  [ this is their best cd . 
  i have all their songs so far but i want the actual cd to blast it on my house while i 'm cleaning : p ] ( http://www.amazon.com/origin-symmetry-muse/dp/b000ampzf8/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pc_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=i1y5bexqu67x7k ), 
  music is life !,
