  right , ok . . 
  here 's some of my `` art '' :, 
  - [ [ the group of 12 ] ( http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/353/e/a/_the_group_of_11___by_gslucky-d5ojvfj.png ) ], 
  - [ [ torrent of love ] ( http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2013/041/0/c/torrent_of_love_by_gslucky-d5ujn65.png ) ], 
  - [ [ lietuva 's lullaby - wip ] ( https://soundcloud.com/da-mangaka/lietuvas-lullaby ) ], 
  i go every weekend . 
  i like to go to walk around gaslamp and also to deposit my money to my debit card . 
  sometimes i go to hillcrest or kerny mesa though i have to plan well : it can take me up to 2 hours using public transport !, 
  i 'm grinding on their new album . 
  it 's rather new for their kind of sound but i like it . 
  but yes , oos is their best and from it my favorite song is `` new born '' . 
  it 's the first song from a long list of playlists i did for a fanfic-story i am working on . 
  origin is a very old cd and sadly is n't played on the us at all . 
  they got known with black holes and revelations . 
  regardless of twilight sucking , they used the bandwagon to get known over here and well . 
  yeah . 
  oh , and knights of cydonia which is cool . 
  i wanted to go to a concert they had in san diego but i did n't have the money to get tickets ; n ;, 
  i called and called on the radio but never got a chance . 
  that would actually be awesome !, 
  it 's a hetalia fanfic ~ ~ oh god ; ; ~ ~, 
  but it 's not your regular lovey-doey cute thing . 
  it 's not dark either . 
  it 's just historical ( the first part ) and just realistic . 
  it 's what i could expect if they would be roaming in this time right now . 
  of course , there 's some fantasy on it - after all , these are ` nation people ' - but it does n't go too exaggerated . 
  all grounded up well . 
  i 've been working on it for almost 3 years . 
  it 's called [ project hetalia ] ( http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7656816/1/project-hetalia-sins-of-our-brothers ), 
  yeah !, 
  go hang out and eat somewhere , talk . . it 'll be cook : d, 
  suddenly i have a bonner . 
  i 'm a girl . 
  xddddd, 
  dear goddesses , that 's just epic . 
  to be honest , i like it on you . 
  just to show that dresses can make men look nice = v = b, 
  i have a character in a story which is given a french maid uniform as a joke ... but he actually considers it a gift and wears it around for almost 3 months before they kind of have to tell him not to . 
  it 's hilarious . 
  men can look pretty in dresses too : p, 
  if women can use pants , i approve men in skirts = 7 = b, 
  that is amazing . 
  i hope one day ( after i gather 1000 usd in my account ) that i can do that . 
  next time , we need to have a hangover-like adventure . 
  it 'll be fun !, 
  ~ ~ for the 1000th time perhaps :p ~ ~, 
  lemon-salt popcorn !, 
  directions :, 
  - make over the stove popcorn . 
  - grab a bowl and spray/put some oil on it ( olive ftw ), 
  - add some salt and lemon at taste, 
  - toss ( like a salad ) . 
  - serve . 
  yum !, 
  and has fiber 0 7 0 < 3, 
  this is a copy/paste from my removed thread . 
  apologies to the mods for making an unappropriated post , but it was n't with a bad intention : p, 
  on my time in reddit , i 've been lurking the subforums according to my interests . 
  from / r/pokemon to / r/circlejerk , i 've loved and gotten creeped out ( like for example / r/wtf ) by each of them . 
  however , i 've never found a ` home ' to lay on . 
  one which i open up first and makes me smile . 
  on the last couple of days , i 've been feeling under the weather but , perhaps without you knowing , raoa has helped me feel better and keep up with my task . 
  so , i 'd like to thank you all for making me feel special . 
  even as i throw random posts that are eaten among the thousands of posts that this community has . 
  curious , i 've only been less than a month but i already feel that sensation of belonging that i 've been looking for . 
  so , thanks you guys for allowing me to be one in your great community and put me a smile on my face , no matter how adverse the world and the situations might be : ), 
  one day i 'll do that too . 
  then i 'll post it . 
  wtf ?!, 
  he was in mexico ? 
  this is disheartening to say the least . 
  to be honest , i do n't know how good it would be to just suddenly track her if you had the ways to do so , but something must be done . 
  you could try to talk to a help line to see what actions to take in case you see her again . 
  \\* hug \\* you did help her by not judging her on her purchase , that 's for sure . 
  i saw a monkey laying an egg . 
  . and it was fun, 
  [ how about something a bit oriental ? 
  ] ( http://bebeloveokazu.com/2010/09/27/hourenso-tamagoyaki-japanese-spinach-egg-roulade/ ), 
  it 's simple yet elegant . 
  and delicious = 7 = < 3, 
  speaking of comics . 
  [ i want this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/drawing-head-figure-perigee-jack/dp/0399507914/ref=wl_it_dp_v_ns_nc/189-3025374-4344745?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=i33lhems4rm2yl ), 
  because my art sucks ~ ~ no , really it does ... somewhat . 
  i want to make it better and the book seems like an awesome aide . 
  [ or this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/pyrex-prepware-2-cup-measuring-measurements/dp/b0002itqhs/ref=wl_it_dp_v_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=2kwbdf71bxiv3&amp;coliid=i28t8veyozym9z ) so i do n't get what i call `` irrational pancakes '' . 
  i kind of guess what a cup is equal to without a an actual assuring cup xd ;, 
  i use what i call an ` official ' cup which i swat my family away from since that 's what i use as my measuring cup . 
  works rather fine , except for the 1/3rds which are hard to guess since how do you divide a cup in 3 ? 
  worse are 8ths which ergh . 
  a measuring cup will come * really * in handy , specially with delicate recipes as pirozkhi or crepes . 
  wow !, 
  that looks like a fantastic idea !, 
  they still sell them where i live . 
  there are actually various models you can pick from ; from ` basic ' to ` advanced ' . 
  pretty cool, 
  every christmas/new year , i remember , we used to have wars where we would throw rockets and firecrackers at each other . 
  there was this kid that was an expert in grabbing cherry bombs and throwing them back so we knew that who ever had him on the team would have an advantage . 
  we also used rockets to throw the cherry bombs at a larger distance , forging a pseudo-launcher with the cardboard roll from the gift wrappers . 
  i had a fun childhood . 
  porn without a plot .
