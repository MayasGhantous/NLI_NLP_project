  i 'm sorry , but sometimes i 'd really like to see a small concise story about how x guy managed to get the girl before he has sex/rapes her . 
  in other words , i 'd like more hentai like bible black for once ( . 
  . for the story ) . 
  it 's kind of nice to get it on quick but , sometimes it 's overly boring when they start with some plot and throw it away because `` lol sex '', 
  this story gave me chills . 
  it 's brilliant and beautiful . 
  according to some girl in ups , amazon will sometimes forget to add the apartment number when they relay the information to ups/fedex . 
  this caused my so and i so much hassle that time we needed urgent books to be delivered ... 
  to be honest , i did n't ask them for a refund that time because when i went to check my address book , it had no number on the apt . 
  so i thought it was my fault . 
  though , i do remember that amazon likes to ` standardize ' mail so . 
  who knows if it changed it back then too . 
  you need to be careful when it comes to apt . 
  you could always drive down to mexico and get checked rather cheaply . 
  border cities thrive in that kind of thing and they are really good too !, 
  i do n't know why sometimes people can be skirmish about it . 
  here in cali , people from as far as los angeles drives down to tijuana for 5 usd check ups : ), 
  400 gifts ?!, 
  wow !, 
  this * is * the train i 'm looking for . 
  [ um , this seems like a nice gift ] ( http://www.amazon.com/egg-yolky-96035-separator/dp/b000glrf2o/ref=wl_it_dp_v_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=2kwbdf71bxiv3&amp;coliid=iq6d8utip69e3 ), 
  [ or this one going on the economy side :p ] ( http://www.amazon.com/wig-cap-pack-color-neutral/dp/b001balmcs/ref=wl_it_dp_v_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=2serrbc122gjw&amp;coliid=i11ssdotw4zn90 ), 
  there are these chains called `` farmacias similares '' which not only offers * very * inexpensive medicine but also even has a very cheap doctor for check ups . 
  also , a regular doctor in mexico will ask for for 50usd at * most * . 
  usually they range from 200 pesos to 640 and they 'll even throw in the medicine if they have the samples needed . 
  take these things in consideration . . oh !, 
  and your economy on the car too !, 
  who knows if it 'll end up being the same price with how the gas is costing these days . 
  and never drive back at night ^ ^ ;, 
  ah , even now that i 'm free from school i know how much finals suck !, 
  seeing that calculus/math was the closest you have so . 
  it must be trigonometry or vector physics . 
  ~ ~ five dollar footlong ~ ~, 
  hmm , you 'll find many trinkets of around 5 usd [ here ] ( http://www.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/2serrbc122gjw/ref=cm_wl_rlist_go_v_c-5 ), 
  since you live in arizona , if you can , head to mexicali . 
  it 's more populated and chances are you 'll get a better service . 
  good luck !, 
  a little bit more of info : if you * do * cross to mexicali be ready to :, 
  - expect a long line back home . 
  in tijuana this is how [ san ysidro looks like usually ] ( http://www.aerialarchives.com/stock/img/ahlb4465.jpg ) . 
  ~ ~ world 's most active border there , baby ~ ~, 
  - the border patrol will ask you for proof of your citizenship . 
  this used to be a birth certificate or driver 's license but after 9/11 happened , they started to adopt using * passports * for id . 
  i think the birth certificate is still usable but your best chance is with a passport . 
  - `` what are you bringing from mexico ? '', 
  the answer is nonchalant ` nothing ' . 
  if you * do * get to 2nd inspection and lurk until finding your meds , just show them the prescription from the doctor . 
  most of the time they wo n't even bother . 
  in any case , put the meds and the prescription in your bag . 
  - enjoy some authentic chinese-mexican cuisine in mexicali . 
  it 's a must if you visit there : p, 
  ** what to pack if you are going to mexicali ? 
  - bottles of water, 
  - a map of mexicali 's closest doctors ( look for `` farmacias similares '' or just go on asking '' \u00bf donde hay un doctor por aqui cerca que hable ingles ? '', 
  - 20 usd in 5 usd bills . 
  you never know if you 'll need ` favors ' . 
  - a mesh to cover your car window when you are crossing the border . 
  believe me , if you want to save your leg from a nasty burn . 
  go get it . 
  if you do n't have one , a kind lady will probably sell you one for like 2 usd . 
  - music for the road . 
  what i wish to have right now in my house is [ this little baby ] ( http://www.amazon.com/irobot-scooba-floor-washing-robot/dp/b007edjzl6/ref=wl_it_dp_v_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=2kwbdf71bxiv3&amp;coliid=id2bhqwdg7axo ), 
  ~ ~ perfect so you work on doing more things and stuff ~ ~ . 
  since that 's not going to happen any time soon , i suppose you could stock my house ( and yours ? 
  :p ) [ with this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/joy-cooking-anniversary-rombauer-hardcover/dp/b005jy2jco/ref=wl_it_dp_v_s_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=2kwbdf71bxiv3&amp;coliid=i3j35r7kmdm3v4 ), 
  many people say that the usual chinese food you eat at panda express all came from san francisco . 
  while it is true , many other staple dishes of ` fast chinese ' food actually came from mexicali . 
  mexicali is the city with most chinese people in mexico ( so far i know , or at least it is in baja california ) . 
  once you arrive there , you 'll be baffled at how many chinese restaurants there are in * every corner * . 
  i kid you not . 
  i only went once and they are like convenience stores < _ <, 
  i 'm pretty sure there is n't as much line in mexicali but yeah . 
  in tijuana it gets to a ridiculous 600 + cars in line waiting on big holidays like black friday , christmas or new years that some actually cross the border * a week before * so they do n't have to suffer this . 
  adobe flash \\* shakes fist \\*, 
  endless hours of animations and works killed because that stupid program likes to play suicidal . 
  i learned to ctrl + s my files every 5 minutes thanks to that thing ... 
  ~ ~ and yet , i love how it works in general ; v ; ~ ~, 
  this one is ( in my opinion ) for a house with little changes or that is n't visited most of the time . 
  the thing is that my parents . 
  i do n't know where to put it . . . 
  they clean * a lot *, 
  too much to my taste . 
  this is possibly to put them at ease . 
  in your case for your dogs , there 's a more powerful version called the [ romba ] ( http://store.irobot.com/product/index.jsp?productid=12991591&amp;cp=2501652&amp;s=a-productage&amp;parentpage=family ), 
  + . + this is my current ` crown jewel ' on my `` house wishlist '', 
  i 'm currently grinding into getting 10,000 usd to open a business and . 
  . i 'm not exactly into getting one soon . 
  after all , i have around 400-600 usd right now on the bank . 
  got ta keep that dream up = 7 = ; ; ;, 
  i hated the keldeo movie . 
  it was pretty much plotless : /, 
  i know some of the pokemon movies do n't even affect the canon , but the keldeo movie was just a ` showcase ' movie with no real motivation behind . 
  they could have done it without ash and co. even . 
  it 's the only one i 've used fastforward on . 
  that 's pretty much my face as a mexican living on the border who has to cross over to get hooked on the american wi-fi to get the deoxys . 
  arceus-damm it !, 
  none really . 
  we learned the skill when we where 6 with ` lower gauge ' firecrackers and stuff and we passed the knowledge to the younglings . 
  if you wanted to join the group , you 'd have to learn this out of not being called retarded . 
  by age 10 we even learned how to do mini molotov cocktails and got to throw them at a manufacturing place out for the lulz .
