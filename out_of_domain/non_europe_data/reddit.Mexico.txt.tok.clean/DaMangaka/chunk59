  one day , i did n't see it on the patio running along doing chicken things . 
  so i asked my sister where it was and she said she thought it was outside since she heard it chirp . 
  i then go check the washing machine just to be sure and sadly i found my poor little chick dead : it apparently had woken up and tried to escape and somehow fell and broke it 's neck with the helix . 
  i froze it for science . 
  . until it had to be discarded . 
  i was 15 back then . 
  never had another pet since then . 
  . that `` nooo '' of yours just made me cringe . 
  i think i acquired pstd thanks to flash and maya . 
  i hated when the cancelled pushing daisies for no reason . 
  if you 'd like, 
  currently i am just in a pair of jeans ~ = 7 = ~, 
  really ?!, 
  o a o ;, 
  i 'll try this right now !, 
  ok , so i tried and it works . 
  i thought it was like the other events where you 're restricted to some areas ( like the gamestop giveaways which we never get here ) . 
  i 'm so happy ; v ; < 3, 
  shadowbanning of 2013 ?!, 
  i 'm old !, 
  i use them ... 
  very berry smoothie :, 
  1/2 cup of blueberries, 
  1/2 cup of raspberries, 
  1/2 cup of strawberries, 
  milk, 
  honey to taste, 
  ice, 
  blend it all and enjoy quite a thick and luscious smoothie that 's not only delicious but helps your tummy . 
  if you want to make it extra awesome , toss in 1/4 of cup of chia seeds . 
  you can also use this recipe to make a very berry milk jello :, 
  1/2 cup of blueberries, 
  1/2 cup of raspberries, 
  1/2 cup of strawberries, 
  1 packet of gelatin, 
  diced fruit at your liking, 
  do the same as the smoothie , reserving the gelatin and the dice fruit for later . 
  divide mixture in two , putting one part on the fridge and the other one on the stove . 
  warm the mixture on the stove and add the packet of gelatin . 
  afterwards , add the cold smoothie mixture . 
  once it 's mixed , put it on a mold and toss in the fruit . 
  put in the refrigerator until it has become jello . 
  enjoy . 
  flowers = v = . 
  receiving flowers make my day and would have me rolling for months xd,

  that 's fabulous !, 
  but if you do n't know your quantities well at cooking , it can become a disaster !, 
  that 's why it is utterly essential to have something [ like this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/pyrex-prepware-2-cup-measuring-measurements/dp/b0002itqhs/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pc_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=2kwbdf71bxiv3&amp;coliid=i28t8veyozym9z ), 
  how easy was that ? 
  challenge accepted, 
  i would like it actually . 
  while i am aiming for art supplies ( it being my default list ) i am in a dire need for an proper measuring cup . 
  i can make estimations with tea cups but sometimes it 's better to have the actual thing . 
  is there really * everything * for the got fandom ? 
  as a cook , i must know what kind of recipes this book has + . +,
