  because all that edisson did was to reinvent stuff that ready where made by other people , copyright it to himself and be a dick . 
  he 's as revolutionary as steve jobs if you go for a contemporany example . 
  telsa , meanwhile , actually did something and in fact revolutionated the way the world works . 
  you do n't say . 
  amen to that , my fellow procrastinator . 
  and it so happens that most of the times , things done 4 minutes before turn out to be the best thing ever . 
  still need that squirtle ? 
  i have an egg . 
  i can get you one . 
  is the trade open still ? 
  hold on , i am getting eggs for you while capturing solosis . 
  let 's see what happens first : p,

  alright , i 'll get in the room soon, 
  wow , she does have her mom 's look like that . 
  sad she 's still gone ) '' :, 
  has n't our electiral campaing or the whole #yosoy 132 thing thought you a thing ? 
  the media ( mainly televisa ) controls what news come around . 
  i 'm not sure if mvs covered it already but the main media is corrupt and has the governent sucking it 's ... yeah , corrupt, 
  i 'm pan , and if anythig , all it made me is sebastiansexual ... 
  til bill nye , you and i share a birthday, 
  as a person born on november 27 , i wholely agree to the sentiment, 
  names of my rivals :, 
  gen iii : - does not apply - . 
  i like to be creative : /, 
  i was tought back on the days of r/b/y that if you held down the d-pad + a , you could catch them better . 
  on gold , i threw a friend ball to ho-oh and made a circle with the d-pad while ending it with a down + a. 
  i caught it succesfully and from that moment i continue to use that method : p, 
  more than manly , i see him as a `` sir '' . 
  `` can you excuse me while i x-scissor your existance away ? 
  why , thank you good lad '', 
  a quick question : what is a spinner ? 
  is it good as a wall ? 
  i do n't think it 's fast, 
  i do n't think it 's legal to use a psn!arceus . 
  how does a venomoth passer work though ? 
  i do believe this is 1 v 1 . 
  i came just to post this :, 
  viva mexico cabrones !, 
  it 's funny since i had always seen nafta as some sort of gay orgy between the three nations . 
  me suddenly discovering hetalia has * not * helped me wipe this image . 
  as for who tops ... well ... now you might know . 
  i have quite a bit of prism scales . 
  i 'm willing to help you evolve it . 
  is this still up ? 
  you want something for them ? 
  are there any plans for online sharing ? 
  the such of showcasing your city or making challenges a la snes version of simcity ? 
  speaking of sharing cities , have you seen a city made with your software that has made you go `` wow '' ? 
  i ' l check your list and see if i can get one of those . 
  we can start with that : d, 
  role play , milk drink , surf, 
  i am a veteran . 
  i started with pokemon blue . 
  it was a gift given to me by my father on eves of my birthday and due to my good grades . 
  he had heard it was pretty popular and it was my second game ( my first being a toy story game that came in the game boy color bundle ) . 
  i was hooked from the very beginning . 
  the story appealed me but i fell in love with the music that came out from it . 
  it helped me concentrate with my studies . 
  it sort of became my world . 
  soon , of course , that meant it had to be taken away from me . 
  i therefore learned many techniques which helped me not only play more but do more things . 
  i learned to play the game in the dark by having to learn * every * sound effect , every map , every pokemon cry . 
  i continue to do so to this day . 
  thanks to pokemon i learned english grammar better , i became agnostic when nuns would say how evil it was and how their names meant satanic things . 
  i would ride my bike while playing the tune on my cellphone . 
  my teachers became gym leaders and my test became my battles . 
  ** tl ; dr ** pokemon defined my life and i am loving it .
