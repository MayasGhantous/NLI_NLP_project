  i 'm saving for a ups box = v = ;, 
  sleep and play pokemon . 
  drawing is sort of my side-job ( or i want it to be : p ), 
  woop woop !, 
  does n't this photo make you a stalker too ? 
  [ a photo of my friends and i with my sis . 
  we used to do these things quite often ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ktoydjx.jpg ), 
  my first gift was a copic marker . 
  the blender . 
  it makes me think on whether it is best to make a list with * all * the copic markers in existence ( around 300 i think ) instead of listing the box bundles : p, 
  [ this is mine currently ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lqrht53.jpg ), 
  i made it myself : p, 
  yeah , that 's the problem . 
  so far , aside the blender , i have n't seen singles . 
  i 've seen smaller bundles but my goal is to catch 'em all . 
  all of the copic markers !, 
  \\ o 7 o / < 3 ~ ~ and then learn how to use them properly ; ; ; ~ ~, 
  i do have the ` cheaper ' prismacolor marker bundle listed but . . eh . 
  it 's not copic xd ;, 
  i ~ ~ supossedly ~ ~ am a mangaka , apparently having a bundle of copic markers is a must, 
  i do have 2 markers ( of another kind but still on a professional level ) i got from last years 's comic-con . 
  i 'll have to sketch something to see how good they are . 
  also , i have another kind of marker called '' [ neopiko ] ( http://www.amazon.com/neopiko-2-pastel-set-6-colors/dp/b0073jchjs/ref=sr_1_55?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1368420530&amp;sr=8-55&amp;keywords=neopiko ) '' . 
  i have a grayscale set which has [ worked me fine ] ( http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y92/gslucky/gerita0001.jpg ) except that my blender suddenly dried out and died . 
  also , one of the tips of them , when i uncap it , it pulls the whole barrel with it . 
  that 's my experience so far with markers . 
  i need to learn how to grasp this medium better . 
  i 'm learning russian , so i 'm trying to see if how i transliterated was correct . 
  i think that means `` you 're awesome '' ? 
  quick !, 
  throw him to the r/circlejerk-ers !, 
  it is a long story but i 'll make it short as possible : when i was 5 i saw this anime called saint seiya ( better known in the us as `` knights of the zodiac '' ) . 
  my favorite character , hyoga , came from siberia which i later researched in my encyclopedia to be a place in russia . 
  i decided as a goal to learn russian , travel to siberia and become the heir of the cygnus armor . 
  eventually i dumped my self-russian lessons for japanese as the anime craze went up ( and i discovered saint seiya itself was from japan . 
  i had the concept that the cartoon was actually from mexico : p ) . 
  2 years ago , though , i found hetalia and turns out my favorite character is russia . 
  so , what can i say ? 
  i 'm mystified by that place and i thought myself one time ( due to my name ) that i could indeed be a descendant from anastasya ( she 's dead , though d '' : ) . 
  i am also learning due to some story i 'm making in order to have the idioms more realistic . 
  i 'm a bit of a ` language ' collector , having learned english , french , japanese and now russian and german, 
  i want to use them to travel around europe without hindrance . 
  also , for this story i 'm doing ~ ~ hetalia fanfiction , whut ? 
  is that even considered a story on it 's own regard ? ~ ~ i want it to feel real . 
  finally , i consider that languages are a bridge to understand the world a bit better : ), 
  might as well check that sub . 
  thanks !, 
  all i know is that most of my city seems empty : /, 
  indeed : d, 
  fuck i 'm old ! '', 
  `` only 2013 kids will get it '', 
  come over to tijuana !, 
  i think i might be the only person alive here !, 
  we can go and rule the lands , now that we no longer have a working border . 
  i propose to create a new country under the name of `` the reddit republic of california '', 
  though it might conflict with my idea of becoming empress of mexico . 
  i think we would be terri-proud, 
  \\* tips fedora \\*, 
  the empress of mexico accepts . 
  i you shall become the first knight of the guadalupe order in a long time , champ . 
  i 'll check the bus fares to bring you up here . 
  then we can head to mexico city and claim our place in history, 
  i * am * from mexico , and i have awaited the faithful day where the politicians and idiots of this country die . 
  now that it has happened , all of it 's resources , culture and marvels are mine to grab and make shine . 
  you 'll love the chapultepec castle . 
  i suppose . 
  i assume you are from the soon-to-be-retrieved united states . 
  \\* arms crossed \\*, 
  / r/conspiracy would like to have a word with you, 
  maybe you ought to say there , though : i heard something about ameristralia being a thing . 
  we 'll need somebody to talk to them into giving us at least california , new mexico and texas . 
  they can keep arizona for all i care . 
  will ameristralia heed to the demands of the 3rd mexican empire which asks them to return the lost territories ( ca , nm , tx ) back to their rightful place ? 
  we could make a true united federation of redditors . 
  it would be a dream come true !, 
  well , i 'll be damned . 
  sorry , i have a girlfriend ; ), 
  ~ ~ but yes , you can apply for citizenship ~ ~, 
  join team plasma !, 
  certainly i do , though i thought florida continued to be a state of the united states . 
  i 'm actually surprised texas has n't become a republic itself ~ ~ and thus is out for the grabs ~ ~, 
  . pansexual actually . 
  and sorry , i have a lovely lady with me . 
  ~ ~ are you from / r/circlejerk out of curiosity ? 
  then a deal it is . 
  thank you < 3, 
  false , the real lord and savior is none other than arceus . 
  i 'm sure florida wo n't mind rubbing with veracruz . 
  ~ ~ carl de nye `` 420 '' tyson dawkins would like to have a word with you ~ ~, 
  er , sure , why not ? 
  it 's fun , what 's the worst it can happen ? 
  true . 
  let 's just calm down until things get sorted . 
  why not both ? 
  well fuck . 
  here i fail try to demonstrate the combo breaker joke : /, 
  so far i know , no . 
  i 'm . . . 
  kind of sad about that actually . 
  i do n't think you got the memo , but texas is part of the mexican empire now , along with california and new mexico .
