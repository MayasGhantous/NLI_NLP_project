  `` what mission ? '', 
  you 'd ask , and that is precisely why i have waited patiently . 
  they say all humans have a choice , and i have given you the opportunity to listen as to why . 
  you are now pondering why is it that i am here , kalashnikov on one arm and the other holding the crib where your ` little angel ' is sleeping . 
  truth is , ms. jones is that this angel will turn out to be a devil . 
  a devil everyone will learn to fear and loathe , hate and despise . 
  imagine you living in the same situation as i and all the rest trapped in the time where i have come from . 
  yes , this is real . 
  yes , i am still here and i do not wish to stop this explanation in order for you to cry like a broken doll . 
  listen , then you can cry all you want . 
  in my time , in the future that awaits you and your child if he is to continue existing , we are all dead inside . 
  from dawn to dusk we awaken to a world where the skies are grey and plastered in an occasional red . 
  you know that things are crap but you ca n't say anything about it . 
  you ca n't think about it ? 
  imagine that from the moment you are born in that time , you are condemned to a life of servitude in all aspects : bodies with chips which allow them to track you like a dog , mind squashed and liquefied frozen inside the mold of their empty ideals and sense of order , soul destroyed in order to avoid a sense of self . 
  any dystopia written in books can not come close to describe what it happens back in a time where fear is the first you learn and you can never earn trust nor love . 
  you , on the other hand , have the privilege to cry and plea for your son as i announce you that it must be eradicated . 
  `` how can this be so bad ? '', 
  you are probably wondering . 
  you are wondering now how you can trade your life and save him as you stretch your arms towards myself . 
  thinking how to teach him better about life and the world so he does not to become what he is destined to . 
  ms. jones , i sincerely believe in destiny as much as i have a notion of what you called god , but you would also fall into such despair if you 'd found yourself in my situation . 
  my and the situation of many thousands who are only awakened to life to become manufacturing slaves for the few on the top , a top cynically constructed so the few aware are shot down and the rest continue on their misery , never knowing why or how they got there . 
  . that i. . 
  `` would n't do this thing to a loved one ? '', 
  ms. jones , i know you fair enough . 
  causality is n't exactly casual in my days . 
  there is also a reason i am here . 
  if indeed those suffering are unaware , have you thought in that endless web of your mind as to how i know this much ? 
  how i know what this child did and will become ? 
  you see . 
  . it is hard to explain the concept of a `` better good '' when you are n't in the shoes of another , not having the face the same scenario . 
  truth is , mariana , that i might never feel it and i think it is for the best . 
  this might be the first and last time you ever see me . 
  forgive me . 
  you could only hold me so few times before i never saw you again . 
  now if you excuse me , i have to wish my father goodnight ... 
  please .

  the empress of mexico is concerned that you have nukes so close to us . 
  i would advice you to disarm them and use them as fuel to continue our survival on the internet . 
  we actually * do * need that . 
  urgently . 
  that way , people do n't claim what already has been claimed . 
  this to reduce strife . 
  wow . 
  a tv ?!, 
  this probably wins the raoa cup easily xd, 
  ^ ^ ; ; i see . 
  maybe i saw the tv too much . . or the black box . 
  = v = ; ; oh well , i might get my eyes checked . 
  still cool though : d, 
  yeah , now that i look at it it 's a black box . 
  i got confused due to the sheen on the lower corner at the left . 
  guess i was just too excited . 
  but this sub does it so often ; v ;, 
  you 're killing me smalls . 
  and here comes a little known fact about baseball ? 
  [ wip ], 
  well , fuck . 
  i remember at my grad 's night how i was stranded forever alone and i tagged along a group from ib who had a disabled person . 
  i thought `` well , what a bummer . 
  not only we 'll be stuck in lines but we 'll have to be extra careful and slow so he does n't die or something ( he had broken a leg , btw . 
  nothing too `` big '' ) . '', 
  i was incredibly surprised when they practically allowed us to get into games rather fast . 
  thanks to this , we managed to get into space mountain several times ( 14 , breaking my old record of 10 from elementary school ) . 
  it was rather cool , but a one shot and real situation . 
  i know that kids on their grad 's night do the `` omgad i ish broken '' to get out of lines faster , but i guess it 's part of being a mischievous teenager who wants to ` break the rules ' and all that . 
  but to have a group of hags like these who actually * abuse * this system just so their little flowers wo n't make a line . 
  i 'm sorry , but no . 
  not only you show how ridiculous and stupid you are , but this might actually * hinder * those who actually are in need . 
  the ones who do it for the lulz on regular days or grad 's night know enough that it 's just a prank and not an every day thing . 
  but these women are just bullies to this courtesy . 
  i hope disney does something but that does n't affect those that really are handicapped . 
  i think i 'm utterly disqualified , being a girl, 
  good luck you guys = v = b, 
  there 's an amazon groceries section .

  same-sex relationships have been allowed - or rather decriminalized - starting the second mexican empire ( 1862 ) . 
  it is our policy to progress , and given the fact that all marriages are constitutionally valid , it seems poignant to not allow them so . 
  therefore , yes , we do allow and valid same-sex marriage from anywhere in the world . 
  epic empire ? 
  are you the ones on the north east of the former united states ? 
  nothing , working and being at reddit at the same time \\ m /,
