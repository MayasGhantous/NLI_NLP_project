  carry on . 
   ~ ~ what are you looking forward to next month ? ~ ~ what are you looking forward to the month after the next month ? 
  the san diego comic-con , of course ! . 
  i do n't know if there 's any sort of religion , but that place is my mecca . 
  thing is . 
  i need a ticket : they sold out in the first 5 minutes ; v ; < / 3, 
  just as i suspected, 
  just make sure you do n't touch anybody , m ` kay ? 
  can i still put my pic ? 
  i know i left a post to work on ( since i was back at work ; ; ; ), 
  dunno if this contest already ended < _ < ; ; ;, 
  please refer to the map that you can find [ in here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/mexico_1821.png/659px-mexico_1821.png ), 
  the fence could be used to create new soldering materials to keep the internet on . 
  how much of texas would i loose ? 
  i mind not these parts to be taken . 
  if we recovered our territory , so can they . 
  \\* sigh \\* this is so 1847 . . 
  can you agree to become a protectorate under us ? 
  yes , quite good for the eye . 
  thank you . 
  - hrh damangaka i, 
  i suppose that would be best . 
  i know texas has a long tradition of trying to be a nation of it 's own and the least i want is to loose a leg on another war involving texas . 
  i agree to these terms : you can keep all of texas so long as you are our protectorate . 
  right now , actually , i 'm discussion with the second republic of texas . 
  i have yielded the whole territory of what used to be texas under the united states and they have agreed to become my protectorate . 
  therefore , you 'll need to talk to them first before doing so with me . 
  will you recognize sealand as a nation or am i free to make it one of my territories ? 
  currently discussing territorial claims within my own ( over texas , of all the places . 
  damned cursed land . 
  . i shall not lose the integrity over a bunch of rouges ) . 
  [ here 's the current map of mexico . 
  i shall update asap . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/mexico_1821.png/659px-mexico_1821.png ), 
  the empire of mexico would love to start establishing relationships with the canadians asap . 
  let us create a better nafta , without the actual bureaucratic raping . 
  i just wonder if they 'll ~ ~ pussy out ~ ~ redefine their limits and end up sticking up with any of the former us states . 
  again . 
  once more , i do not want a conflict that starts with texas . 
  if history thought me well , is that you do not want to mess with them badly . 
  oh , btw , it is not on the map but i also claimed the former territory of north korea . 
  it is now the `` mexican territory of ch\u014dsen '' , unless any survivor there decides to show up and try to make it one of our states . 
  i 'm also trying to get sealand , for the lulz . 
  very well , i shall put it as one of my territories until further notice . 
  thank you . 
  - hrh damangaka i, 
  [ with these guys ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/virussurvivors/comments/1efh84/the_second_republic_of_texas/ ) . 
  good luck . 
  you 're right !, 
  they are perhaps one of the few people that still have sovereignty . 
  i shall take them of the list . 
  thanks for reminding me . 
  sure . 
  though , if you give me those parts back , as part with the agreement with 2rot i would `` give them back '' to them ensuring peace . 
  i think this seals the deal . 
  and yes , i will become your ally . 
  north america must stay together in adversity . 
  we have ways to produce power , thus , keeping the internet alive . 
  pretty much , yes . 
  though , we 've been pretty neutral ever since the conception of the nation in 1824 . 
  that , however , was probably enforced due to the fact that there had been constant civil wars and power struggles which were the main cause of 89 % of our problems . 
  our incursion in ww2 is akin to a friend being dragged to a bar that one does not want to go but the other guy says `` it 'll be awesome , you 'll like it ! '' . 
  nevertheless we did more assistance and rescue missions than actually participating in war ( most of it baby sitting philippines ~ ~ which is * also * part of the mexican empire . 
  the map can not show it properly ) . 
  this time , though , we shall enforce full neutrality by not going into conflicts but also protecting ourselves from it . 
  we will , however , offer supplies and materials to other nations if needed . 
  for a price . 
  they are as hostile as a dog behind a fence . 
  they 'll bark at you but wo n't do anything . 
  unless you get inside the gate . 
  keep your distance and you should be fine . 
  ** if ** they do decide to become overly aggressive , they shall hear from us in a passive-aggressive manner . 
  when you know your history , you know what to and not to do . 
  the least i want is to have it down like we used to be before . 
  this is a brand new era were we can do things right . 
  i look forward for the mexico our founding fathers sought and died for . 
  [ original nafta on wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_free_trade_agreement ), 
   the goal of nafta was to eliminate barriers to trade and investment between the us , canada and mexico . 
  [ ... ] nafta also seeks to eliminate non-tariff trade barriers and to protect the intellectual property right of the products . 
  [ however ] nafta has been beneficial to business owners and elites in all three countries , but has had negative impacts on farmers in mexico who saw food prices fall based on cheap imports from us agribusiness , and negative impacts on us workers in manufacturing and assembly industries who lost jobs . 
  critics also argue that nafta has contributed to the rising levels of inequality in both the us and mexico . 
  nafta was meant to make trades better between the north american countries , however it was heavily abused in order to have cheaper materials ( mostly from canada ) and cheaper labor ( mostly from mexico ) for us products which then are exported to these two countries and sold at high prices . 
  the idea is to balance this free trade agreement so that there are benefits per each involved individual . 
  neither should gain or lose more . 
  also , this will kill any other plans to destroy freedoms of speech under copyright ( a la acta/cispa/sopa ) since there is no longer such thing and communication over the internet is vital key of our survival . 
  technically , what we must do is to trade stuff like we do in the internet , and find a way to keep it fair . 
  that is good . 
  i do not have any military training but am aware of guerrilla warfare . 
  still , i do not think war is the answer unless utterly necessary . 
  we 'll remain at peace . 
  is it . 
  * that * safe ? 
  um , not to be rude , but i claimed north korea first . 
  it is now a protectorate . 
  the protectorate of ch\u014dsen . 
  has it been 33 days already ? 
  since 99.9 % of the people are dead , this is mostly a territory meant for agriculture , vacation and refugees . 
  another option is to make it our australia in case of mischievousness popping out . 
  ~ ~ what do you mean nothing changed ? ~ ~, 
  \\* cough \\* i need to finish that .
