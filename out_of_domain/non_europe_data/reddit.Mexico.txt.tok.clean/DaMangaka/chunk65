  i 've been busy trying to find myself a telcel celphone with 4g that does n't suddenly die on me . 
  i have some samsung galaxy note and an iphone 4 that i got from one of their stores . 
  that and finding more people to move into mexico city . 
  i 'm stuck in mexicali . 
  i do n't know how long it 'll take me to cross the desert of sonoyta ( where there is definitively no internet at all ) . 
  i 'll update at night with all the nations . 
  - hrh da mangaka i, 
  the most [ random ] ( http://gslucky.deviantart.com/art/c-r-a-p-caipirinha-s-p-ver-90377864 ) thing i 've done so far . 
  op * surely * will deliver . 
  you 'd need to talk with the leader of the [ second republic of texas ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/virussurvivors/comments/1efh84/the_second_republic_of_texas/ ), 
  why am i awesome you ask ? 
  oh well , i 'll try to be humble . 
  the long title i have given to myself is `` creator of worlds , keeper of the 4th wall and bringer of madness '' . 
  i am also a pigeon , for some reason that just adds more to my awesomeness . 
  as you can see . 
  . i 'm rather random < _ <, 
  oh , and spectacular too . 
  sort of . 
  my drawings are n't that much cool but i can indeed tell and create epic stories out of mostly everything . 
  so , yeah . 
  the real n.koreans are dead  : |, 
  and we do n't do propaganda : we had enough already as it was back on our old form of government . 
  we are against such mindless trifling . 
  you 're welcome, 
  the dprnwe are a bunch of trolls . 
  they really know nothing about such thing . 
  it 's best to ignore them  : |, 
  i do n't understand what you mean by that . 
  but best korea was claimed first by myself . 
  if anything , you should be the one choosing if you wish to lead it or not given it 's status as protectorate . 
  ~ ~ he could go for the speed ~ ~, 
  i 'll stop right there < _ < ; ;, 
  i think he is a bit delusional due the whole r-virus thing . 
  must have lost his mind . 
  \\* sigh \\*, 
  i have like 10 stories rolling in my head . 
  i hope to have time soon enough to write them down and make comics out of them \\* points to username \\*,

  which in my case is 14, 
  it 's me again . 
  the original post has been updated . 
  please head there to rant more about the subject . 
  also , if anybody is in mexicali , you are welcome to join me in my pilgrimage towards mexico city ~ ~ aka chilangolandia ~ ~ . 
  - hrh damangaka i, 
  if that 's so we shall allow the expansion of our other protectorate , die republik von ostpreu\u00dfen , to cover all of russia . 
  have a wonderful day : d, 
  i think that after having a protectorate claim russia . 
  it 's too much . 
  sarcasm is not needed . 
  and to be honest , i only allowed russia to be taken because nobody had bothered with it . 
  i 'd be more glad to take it off my shoulders with the condition it does n't become a hellhole like it was before . 
  in fact , i 'll be selling ~ ~ prussia ~ ~ russia , on the condition stated above . 
  . to somebody who has n't eaten another territory < <, 
  you already have your own territory \u00ac _ \u00ac, 
  to be honest , i 'd like it to be independent of any other country . 
  to be it 's own . 
  the odd part is that technically , ostpreussen is the protectorate and russia itself is the * territory * of ostpressen . 
  but again , i 'd want it to be it 's own nation . 
  then i 'd ally with that nation . 
  \\* small smile \\*, 
  it is also to avoid any possible wars : right now the former united states and canada have separated into many territories . 
  mexico has kept it 's 32 states and added 4 more for a grand total of 36 . 
  additionally , central america is ours ( as in the 1st empire of 1822 ) and we have a state of eternal neutrality . 
  the united states is no more . 
  we are stronger just by territory . 
  additionally , if russia were to fall in the wrong hands ( as a whole and as it is right now ) it can cause a world unbalance as it 's too big and has much potential of destruction . 
  it is therefore in my interest for world peace to either break it up ( though i do not like the idea ) or handle it to somebody who can raise it to the level of the russian empire back in the days of peter the great having as comparison as well the kingdom of prussia under fritz . 
  with all these standards , you might understand why it 's important russia is taken care of . 
  the ones surviving out there need more pettings and a good government , one that they have been struggling to get since the october revolution of 1917 and i know that feeling since my own country has been struggling with that since it 's foundation . 
  so , more than anything , it 's reciprocate feelings . 
  until somebody starts making claims , russia will just be an asset . 
  no more , no less . 
  i like this idea . 
  i love that !, 
  if it was n't because our national anthem is glorious already , we would take your same approach . 
  - hrh damangaka i, 
  yup . 
  i knew everyone would start making territorial claims , which is why i started that list in the first place . 
  [ you can check the updates so far here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/virussurvivors/comments/1e9eu7/organization_post_the_new_nations_of_the_world/ ), 
  i 'll try to tidy it up and have it better . 
  i suddenly have such nationalistic feeling . 
  \\* sniff \\* . 
  i really wish the r-virus struck and mowed away our current leaders : '' (, 
  yeah , that 's kind of sad . 
  the legendary ameristralia never managed to become . 
  which just prove how stupid the idea was in the first place : p, 
  it just proves how easy it is to dissolve a nation that 's * united *, 
  it shows us our true nature . 
  the virus . 
  i could make a book of this < v <, 
  i ... did that already . 
  does n't anybody read the posts before posting ? 
  i have some few shorts sized 12-14 and i 'm pretty sure my sis has a lot of clothing size 10 . 
  i 'll see what i can do . 
  as a pigeon , i am truly happy to see this happening . 
  what would you do with it ? 
  does n't louisiana have a vast land for crops and resorts ? 
  though , philippines is quite far . 
  i 'm not sure how you 'll do with that . 
  i want to handle over territories to nations i know that have the capability to work with the land .
