  \\* laughs \\* that sounds ok . 
  though i 'd like to have a filipino to claim it . 
  i only host it due to the limits of new spain but i do not have the intentions of keeping . 
  waiting for that . 
  the mexican empire is highly interested in investing in your scientific research . 
  you 'll have the [ unam 's research and analysis laboratories ] ( http://www.ingenieria.unam.mx/imagenes/foto_infra.jpg ) and if needed , the politecnico 's as well . 
  which will give others depression . 
  i am trying to reform nafta with the canadian states . 
  i wonder if the former us states will follow . 
  i 'm sorry to inform you that texas is a protectorate lead by fitzburger . 
  it is called '' [ the second republic of texas ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/virussurvivors/comments/1efh84/the_second_republic_of_texas/ ) '' . 
   the democratic commonwealth of west korea [ ... ], 
  but wait , i already hold claim of the former territory of n.korea under the name of . 
   [ ... ] will encompass the previous borders of sweden , norway , and the faroe islands, 
  you are welcome to enter , so long as you move down to the territory of central america or the mexican territory of ch\u014dsen . 
  until further reconstruction of the empire happens and some adjustments , i can not allow you to enter the mainland . 
  i find it agreeable and accept your alliance . 
  let us build a better world together . 
  - hrh damangaka i, 
  my , interesting approach . 
  i applaud you and extend my friendly hand for an alliance if you wish . 
  i am not interested in defense , more i am in reconstructing my country . 
  anything towards that goal is highly appreciated . 
  having assets does not force you to exploit them . 
  mexico itself has many resources which need to be administered first . 
  once i 've done that , we can follow up with the rest . 
  patience : building successful nation takes time . 
  i am the empress of the 3rd mexican empire . 
  you can see a detailed description of our territories [ in this post here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/virussurvivors/comments/1ehf1j/the_territories_of_the_3rd_mexican_empire_seeking/ ), 
  the area of baja california , california , nevada and arizona should be safe . 
  we made a visit to the termoelectric plan in mexicali and it should be running for at least 1 month unsupervised . 
  we are still checking in here for other plants as i go down to mexico city but other states on my journey were n't as lucky : while slr runs thanks to mexicali , sonora 's out of power . 
  likewise with durango and chihuahua . 
  the power outage is mainly a central states issue , which makes me wonder of the condition of the capital . 
  i shall, 
  my birthday is on the magical november 27, 
  i have seen long train carts filled with gifts thrown at the people in raoa . 
  up to 30 of these full of goodies . 
  i 've always wanted to do one but , alas , i do not have enough money for building a train . 
  always hoping to do my commitment towards the others = v =\\, 
  cut cut cut, 
  one of my wishlists did have an address . 
  but not the proper one ^ ^ ; ;, 
  so , also take a look on that , specially if you hold multiple addresses !, 
  ready for some friendly fire , mam !, 
  well , i 've been called a dude when i 'm a girl : p, 
  how about stella ? 
  or shermie, 
  i could put a picture in here , or a song , but i suppose i will tell you a story because this hits close to me . 
  i 've kind of discovered i am prone to be depressive , as in the actual condition not the sudden melancholy one can have . 
  and that , ironically , made me depressed . 
  it 's a sudden loop where you feel miserable , want to make others feel miserable with you and that makes you more miserable until you just ... stop feeling for a while . 
  all is gray even if there are like 48 colors on a box of colored pencils . 
  and my friends help out but when you are in a condition like that you even shun them because you close yourself in a little ice castle hoping all go to fuck up . 
  suddenly you ca n't sleep either because of your own thoughts turning into crawly spiders and demons . 
  it might not be your case , but you might find some similarities to what i tell you . 
  how do you battle these things ~ ~ that does n't require to decapitate people ~ ~ ? 
  i found that the answer is that you do n't . 
  do n't fight it . 
  embrace it . 
  you 're having troubles , you 'll be sad but the least you want to do is to fight against it , because your frustration will just grow and with that your depression . 
  as i found in a funny thread in / r/askreddit , stress leaves to anxiety and anxiety to depression - sadness . 
  just embrace it but do n't let it drown ya . 
  realize somehow that there are still ways out . 
  things are n't forever , not even troubles . 
  if you have people around you that you can talk , talk to them and just share your emotions . 
  you are not alone and it is ok to be sad once in a while . 
  ah , and tea can help too if you are having trouble sleeping : chamomile and lavender . 
  finally . 
  um . . to cheer you up more with things , here 's one of my [ favorite youtube series ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnijjexut4 ), 
  the philippines is a protectorate of mine . 
  would n't this be better for / r/defaultgems ? 
  can i go with you to comic-con ? 
  ; ; v ; ; i need a ticket though ... 
  aww , i got in late ; n ;, 
  ahh , i see . 
  to be honest , sometimes i see ` gems ' both in / r/bestof and / r/defaultgems so . 
  it 's kind of redundant < < ;, 
  no problem = v = b, 
  is there a way i can still get one ? 
  i am a frequent in / r/random _ acts_of_amazon, 
  welcome = v = /, 
  the one time i took a sip from a beer bottle , i almost flipped the car over . 
  never again . 
  though , i will recommend pacifico or tecate . 
  i 'm a mangaka ? 
  hurray me \\ 0 7 0 /, 
  mods will surely deliver . 
  why not both ? 
  ~ ~ he obviously meant kelvin , you stupid fundie ~ ~, 
  would upswag again, 
  this is pretty much why i want one too , specifically being part of raoa : p, 
  [ perhaps this will make you lol ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxgnip4rmoi ), 
  i came here to say that i am a pigeon and thus you should fear me \\ = 7 = /, 
  \\* throws gift , regardless \\*, 
  \\* coos rather awesomely \\* \\ 0 7 0 /, 
  [ maybe one of these might help ? 
  i have facebook , but i barely used . 
  so , i do n't think i 'd miss it much if i had to delete it . 
  i 've been thinking of it actually,
