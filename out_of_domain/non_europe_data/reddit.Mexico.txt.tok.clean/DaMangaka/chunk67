  how far up on ok did it happen ? 
  i have a friend living over there . 
  though , knowing her , she might go * chasing * the tornado instead, 
  i do n't consider myself a celebrity ~ ~ yet ~ ~ but . 
  i suppose i 'm hiding here ? 
  ~ ~ lies !, 
  i 'm just a pigeon in disguise !,

  . really wish i 'd knew what that means . 
  what i do is that from what i earn , i make it into usd ( my earnings are in mxn ) and put them in a bank in usa . 
  not only i 'll think twice from withdrawing , but it keeps my regular account mobile without worries of spending too much and not saving . 
  in your case , i suppose , you can invest in [ for example ] , amazon gift cards to make sure you can only spend on what you want without chances of using it elsewhere for other things . 
  ^ ^ ; ; hope it helps . 
  \\* sigh \\* well , it 's a relief . 
  she 's all the way close to the border of kansas . 
  still , i heard it was really bad d :, 
  with all the stuff that 's been happening lately , the least people need is another disaster . 
  hmm , i 'm interested on the dostoyevsky books . 
  how much for them ? 
  met this random girl on okcupid . 
  girl says that wants to meet me and go to the movies or something . 
  movies = popcorn . 
  i accept . 
  meet girl . 
  girl tells me she 's a mtf . 
  do n't give a shit about that . 
  walk with girl around mall . 
  go to movie : ice age 3 . 
  girl buys me popcorn . 
  epic . 
  awesome adventure . 
  say our goodbyes . 
  she had nice day though she tells me that she might have some trouble with me getting to me again due to family issues . 
  i encourage girl to go forward . 
  girl leaves . 
  i was n't exactly into this girl once i met her ( not bad but not somebody i 'd date or hold as girlfriend ) , but i was happy to spend my day outside with somebody i did n't knew . 
  8/10 , would try again if sometime i 'm single : p, 
  there 's a problem of getting friends via okcupid . 
  for obvious reasons , it seems that everyone in there wants to date the fuck out of you , not befriend you . 
  i like my dates like tokimeki memorial dates , which help me see if that is the one . 
  ~ ~ i think i 'm the shiori in the game ... ~ ~, 
  they still have 2 years more to develop it . 
  my sister and i tend to sing this song when ever we are hungry and driving a car . 
  the effect becomes a bit funnier when our dad is the squidward on the situation given that when he is hungry all he is thinking is eating and we can get a bit annoying .

  . . well , it 's not * in * the shower . 
  it 's close to the sink . 
  i 'll tell my sister who tends to abuse it like crap anyways . 
  i 'm not even sure myself . 
  i wake up at 5:30 am and leave the house before 7 am . 
  i am not sure about all of what she does . 
  i do know she gets to sleep at 12am because she has to remove * all * that she has on and she does n't exactly have a heavy make-up,

  ** holy sh * t. . 
  i won ?!,

  \\* fangasms \\* omg . 
  muse 's origin of symmetry . 
  i will now explode + v + < 3, 
  thank you, 
  my main goal is to obtain 10,000 usd to start a business . 
  that is my dream . 
  with my business i will be able to build a house and finally move . 
  it might start small both the house and the business but i hope to make it a worthwhile . 
  as for amazon goes , i 'd like to get * all * of the copic markers . 
  all 5 sets . 
  that 's about 1k usd for the 5 sets ^ _ ^ ; ;, 
  well , i dunno about you but in my case i go with :, 
  pepperoni , mushrooms and pineapple : d, 
  i do so too . 
  it 's a project i had in mind since i was little . 
  a project now i share with my so . 
  i want to pull this out and i want to do it well without drowning myself in debt . 
  10k usd is around 117,000 mexican pesos . 
  enough to get me in a nice place and buy me some decor/materials . 
  if one can start a business with 10k * pesos * , i 'm pretty sure 10 times the amount can do marvels here . 
  ~ ~ i think i 'm hungry ' ^ ' ~ ~, 
  i got cake for mother 's day . 
  i 'm not even married : p, 
  free cake !, 
  oh , good . . . 
  i thought it was just my hunger ; v ; < 3, 
  skittles is a cute name though, 
  yup !, 
  and the best part : it was cheesecake, 
  d'awww . 
  i wish i had a cat , but mom 's allergic and dad just simply does n't like pets in the house . 
  i 'll wait until e3 tbh . 
  i have a wii which practically i do n't play due to there being only 1 tv in my house . 
  if i 'm spending money on a console , it better be one that has high quality games .
