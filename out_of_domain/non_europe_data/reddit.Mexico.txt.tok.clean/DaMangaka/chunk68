  so far , nintendo has satisfied me in that . 
  but , i 've been wanting to play online and do more ( which sadly the wii lacks ) so i 'm wondering what the xbox 720 can do . 
  i saw the ps4 and i was n't impressed : / , i can do the same with a ps3 and it 'll cost cheaper ( will the ps3 become the `` ps2 '' of the ps4 ? ) . 
  so , yeah . 
  i wish he could have such change of heart ; v ; < / 3, 
  you can do it = v = /, 
  i am planning to buy [ this ] ( http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/galaxytab/7.0/index.html?type=find ) to my dad . 
  he likes to hint it quite a lot : p, 
  this will be for father 's day . 
  i 'll pack it in a box of cereal like how i gave him the samsung galaxy 10.1 2 years ago . 
  though it seems they 'll launch 3 very soon  . 
  over the stove popcorn . 
  there are two version i like to eat : one with a light sprinkle of olive oil and some salt and the other is olive oil , salt and lemon . 
  it 's delicious < 3, 
  best of luck for you 0 v 0b, 
  and a pound of popcorn kernel is much cheaper than a box of 8 bags of microwaveable popcorn . 
  you can also make it as you want ( caramel , caramel milk , chocolate for sweet or chili powder , chili-lemon-chamoy for savory/spicy ) and they are good fiber for your tummy . 
  it changed my life forever , me basically being addicted to it : p, 
  you 're welcome : d, 
  it 's rather simple , you can do them in any pot . 
  the idea is this : scatter the kernels to make one layer and let them cook slowly . 
  if you try to pour more , not only may get too much popcorn but the weight of the unopened kernels might make it impossible for them to cook well , making the popped ones burn . 
  so first get a pot the side of how many popcorn you want ( small pot = about a bowl , etc ) . 
  - lay a gentle layer of cooking oil ( i use olive oil . 
  i have tried sesame and it gets a different size kernel but with a nutty/asian taste ) . 
  - lay * 1 * layer of kernels . 
  it should be enough to cover the bottom of the pot . 
  - turn on the stove , and keep it at low heat . 
  it might take a while to cook specially in colder areas/temperatures/seasons . 
  keep the pot uncovered so the air flows easily . 
  ( yes !, 
  air is part of the process ) . 
  - stay by the side of the pot . 
  watch it carefully . 
  you do n't need to stir really if you are cooking it at a low heat . 
  - when the first kernels begin to pop , cover it . 
  the chain reaction is starting and now what you need is that the hot air created ( the one from before , remember ? 
  it has been cycling there ) gets captured in the bowl . 
  you may want to leave a small gap where air can flow in order to provide more ` fuel ' the hot air . 
  - turn off the heat when the popping becomes very infrequent , to a point of quietness . 
  - be careful at taking off the cover , it 'll be - hot - . . and with some popcorn stuck . 
  when choosing for a cover , try to make it as light as possible : enough to cover it without being blown by the popcorn/heat but not as heavy as to not let the popcorn ` grow ' up . 
  serve them as you like : p, 
  no problem . 
  and now . 
  i want some popcorn ; v ; < 3, 
  rip - carrots . 
  you will be missed . 
  ^ i ^ want ^ a ^ 3ds ^ so ^ bad ^ < _ <,

  i 'm not participating , but that seems rather cool . 
  i 'll just throw the name ` denki ' if it 's female , ` raiden ' if it 's male . 
  i like that deal . 
  i 'll take it . 
  though , right now i 'm in the process of changing my address . 
  i want to finish this deal once i have my new mailing address so as to not having to go all the way up there ^ ^ ;, 
  can you put them on hold while i 'm done ? 
  say what you want , but after a couple of turns , monopoly turns out to be a battle field . 
  i 'll say , good sir , that you did an excellent job . 
  bravo . 
  i shall take my hats off for you . 
  \\* monocle \\*, 
  a reddit exchange gift i got . 
  i still need to finish my thank you letter , that 's why i 'm not posting yet . 
  i am very grateful ; / / ;, 
  pie ? 
  there 's one open right now that 's called `` arbitrary day '' . 
  i will participate on both and be a rematch for the normal ad . 
  wish my wallet some luck ^ ^ ;, 
  curado, 
  here in mexico we call them ` pay de queso ' ( lit . 
  cheese pie ) . 
  so . . yeah , i suppose : p, 
  the first person i gave a gift has n't posted a ` thanks ' post . 
  ( at least that i know of ) . 
  i 'm wondering if he got his item . 
  yup : / u/mr _ cutestory, 
  i 've checked the user 's history in raoa and i do n't see him having * any * [ thanks ] post for any of his gifts received . 
  it 's odd : /, 
  i usually would n't care but pok\u00e9mon x is coming out on 3ds . 
  `` fuck you , random citizen . 
  you 'll have to get a 3ds now . 
  `` ffffffffffffffffffffffffff - '', 
  about a month ago : /, 
  it was my first contest here i made . 
  hmm . . 
  poor is . 
  bad ... 
  i think i will , given that evidence .

  my favorite characters would be mewtwo from pokemon . 
  there 's just so much into it and perhaps the best developed character in the anime series and overall canon . 
  he 's just incredible . 
  if you allow me , i 'd like to borrow that word for my dictionary : p,
