  i 'm pretty sure that due to your statement you * are n't * living in mexico , right ? 
  this summer is my sister 's and my so 's birthdays . 
  while my wallet might weep , i want to buy them presents . 
  particularly , i want to sew my so a cute plushie . 
  she is very huggy and sometimes needs one when she 's sad but i ca n't be there ( me being in the west and she in tx ) . 
  so , that 's my project for the summer . 
  as for my sister , food . 
  . lots of food and clothes : p, 
  a 3ds or a collectible figurine i 've been eyeing since i saw it ( both on my wishlists btw ) . 
  though my biggest issue is the 3ds : i do n't really need another gaming console but the newest pok\u00e9mon will come out on that handheld . 
  it 's forcing me to but . 
  . i do n't want to dish out 200 usd considering i want to save for something big ( like my business ) . 
  reaching to 10,000 usd is hard . 
  . specially with those kind of distractions @n @ ;, 
  ~ ~ like my women : soft , creamy and aromatic ~ ~, 
  i do n't drink coffee : p, 
  i had the * charger * for it but gave it away on / r/randomkindness, 
  i can still get you one official * and * cheap where i live . 
  there are tons of them in the pawn shops and videogame stores in my city . 
  it 's a gen 1 ds , right ? 
  actually , mexico . 
  but 's the same thing anyways : p, 
  so , you 're from the land of a thousand sockets ( europe ) ? 
  i see . 
  well , good luck finding one !, 
  i think i saw amazon having a selection for them . 
  you might as well check it out . 
  you spelled amerikkka wrong , you stupid fundie . 
  plot twist : lenin 's stroke was in part provoked by stalin . 
  count me in = v 0b, 
  i and p, 
  this is my dream actually . 
  i 'm trying to earn 10k usd to open my own business . 
  it 'll take a lot of time considering my earnings are in pesos , but i know i can do it . 
  anyways , the business i want to open is a tea shop with a small bakery . 
  it 's a place where you can enjoy a nice relaxing cup of tea with freshly made goodies - from traditional bread to some snacks . 
  the idea is that we 'd also be a community-based business too , inviting people to participate in many rallies and collects for those in need . 
  also , ingredients will be organic and fair trade - just a perk of mine : p, 
  once this has grown and perhaps expanded , i wish to open a restaurant ( more like my mum wants to but , , lol , i like the idea ) . 
  but mainly , the tea shop . 
  i have a business model and name for it already xd ;, 
  all i need is the money ~ ~ and the furniture ~ ~, 
  wow , jeesh . 
  wtf ? 
  first the riots in sweden , now this . 
  it 's . 
  making me want to curl on a corner . 
  specially when knowing that one of the recent tragedies in my country - the death of 49 babies in a daycare 4 years ago due to a fire - was actually caused by a corrupt politician that tried tried to burn the evidence of a 10 million fraud . 
  the fire burned the building the info was but spread down to the daycare . 
  none has been tried or put in jail and one of the involved is the sister of our recent ex-president . 
  it 's just . 
  sad \\* curls on a corner \\*, 
  i just no longer know how to react to these news . 
  worse of all , it triggers my depressive mood and then i ca n't get out . 
  i try to avoid / r/worldnews as much as i can but i want to know that at least there is some progress in the world or a place that 's at least not a disaster . 
  so far , i have n't found said place . 
  i can only try to chin up and spread as much happiness as i can . 
  perhaps that 's why i joined raoa in the first place ' . ', 
  \\ 0 70 / happiness for all, 
  ~ ~ though my wallet hurts after a while considering i * also * participate in reddit giftexchanges ~ ~, 
  but it does n't matter , happiness !, 
  would n't he be 57 ? 
  nevermind , i saw it : p, 
  i thought i had the comments on a chronological setting . 
  a quick ctrl + f allowed me to see that i was wrong . 
  carry on = v =, 
  to this war , all i have to say is . 
  ** come at me bro !, 
  ** \\* spreads arms \\*, 
  if a cat likes the item more than the box , it is a great success . 
  also , lovely kitten = v = < 3, 
  what i like ? 
  hmm , well , this is the list of things that make me happy :, 
  - pokemon stuff, 
  - anime . 
  the older , the better . 
  though i do enjoy sporadic ` new ' anime like hetalia ( my current fixation ) , kuroshitsuji and death note . 
  - drawing . 
  i love to write stories too that can get complicated . 
  most of my head is full of ideas i can never find a place to settle down , so most of the time i doodle . 
  you can notice also my username : p ~ ~ this is probably what i invest most of my life in ~ ~, 
  - cooking . 
  i like to experiment with new cuisine and food-stuffs . 
  i 've gotten as far as to make starfruit * tempura * . 
  because , why not ? 
  - i do like videogames but mostly retro games from nintendo : game boy color or advance games , n64 . 
  . you name it . 
  - music . 
  without it , i 'd probably die . 
  i 'm into muse ( since they are interestingly my muse ) and green day . 
  outside from it i enjoy classical music and anime/movie background music . 
  that 's about it , i think . 
  you can see more of my likes on my wishlist , but it 's a bit redundant . 
  yes ... 40lbs . 
  i want my tea place to have some sort of nice sophisticated look but feel like you have come home after a long day of . 
  what ever . 
  all you want to is to relax and eat something good , drink along with it too . 
  there 's another twist to my idea in which i can offer small private rooms for private meetings and parties but generally , what i aim for is a nice place to just go and relax . 
  and good tea does n't have to be expensive either !,
