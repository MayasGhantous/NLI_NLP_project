  you know , it 's funny : for a console that does ` less ' than it 's competition , nintendo really knows how to play it 's game . 
  at least , i do n't play too often on a main console ( i tend to stick with my ds mainly due to pokemon and due to only having 1 tv on the house ) , but when i do , i can go and pick games that i know i 'm going to enjoy . 
  either borrowed or buy them . 
  the xbox ( 1 ) ( i 'll call it like that ) has * many * disadvantages , but it gets worse when you bring the concept to a country like mexico . 
  why ? 
  well , let 's start :, 
  - mexico is still tied to cable and lacks or has a feeble internettv service . 
  things like hulu does not exist and netflix is horrendously bad made . 
  to use this feature , we 'd need to dish out more money to switch our ip to an american one . 
  - while we do have internet , it is not as fast or stable as i presume it is on the us . 
  many of the gamers actually * depend * on the resale of games or borrowing of these to play the newest trends . 
  there are even businesses here that work like an arcade , only with consoles . 
  you ` rent ' a console and play your game . 
  there 's also the obvious fact that not many have the luxury of buying them as often and lastly , the internet service here is * fucking * expensive . 
  to add the xbox live privileges is adding even more to the costs of having a fully usable xbox , not to mention that there are still people who ca n't have internet all the time . 
  - forcing you to use kinect sounds bad , right ? 
  how about using kinect on a 14 ' x 14 ' or less living room ( or what ever space lesser than that size you have ) . 
  yeah , good luck with that . 
  - the xbox ( 1 ) therefore becomes an expensive luxury where you have to pay even * more * to maintain , feed , pet and use . 
  it 's ridiculous and one console i shall never consider . 
  if you wonder if consoles are localized like other electronic devices like tablets and phones , the answer so far is no . 
  it 's the same in * all * latinamerica . 
  nice way to seclude us . 
  yeah . 
  my two cents here  : |, 
  the xbox ( 1 ) will not be a mexico friendly machine . 
  that 's pretty much what i had in mind at this announcement . 
  y a parte , apoyan a candidatos indiscriminadamente por que les van a dar bonos . 
  no , just a lack of the resources to make these things work . 
  as i said , i only used my country as an example , but i 'll be damned if these things work as well in other lat . 
  american countries like chile , argentina and/or venezuela as it does in the us . 
  we do n't have that much of an organized infrastructure , let alone much of the services well implemented . 
  damn it !, 
  it 's 404 !!!, 
  how about slyder ? 
  random name that came to my mind . 
  . that sounds like fun . 
  good luck to all of you guys there . 
  ~ ~ i was already gifted , so go have fun with the others + v + ~ ~, 
  well , i 've never had a bad interview itself but more like comments they make me . 
  usually on how i am too ` overqualified ' for the job and thus ca n't get in . 
  really ? 
  overqualified ? 
  i thought that would be good . 
  however , the worst one was once that i got lost in a manufacturing plant on my way out and i my mind kind of like switched to adventure mode , with me humming a theme song and all . 
  one of the guys that is a friend of who interviewed me , noticed me and thought i was under the influence of drugs ( wtf ? ), 
  and told this other guy . 
  and so , i did n't get that job . 
  because i was too jolly humming to myself . 
  i am a pigeon , thus you should ~ ~ fear me ~ ~ gift me . 
  nailed the first time = v = b, 
  ~ ~ though i had practiced before with my mom 's car . 
  let 's say that it became curved . . ~ ~, 
  um , i 'll take $ 56.34 usd , jim . 
  bars open up here as early as 12pm . 
  so i suppose as soon as you can : p, 
  holy cow !, 
  i like how you spelled my name : p, 
  thanks so much !, 
  ah , good to know . 
  i 'll continue waiting then . 
  it 's for a far away place ( romania ) and the other exchange had her item retained by customs . 
  so i hope it arrives . 
  ~ ~ technically we are due to the continent being called america , though for more technicallities america = / = americas ~ ~, 
  but i get what you mean .
