  to be honest , here in mexico we have many words to call an american : gringo , gabacho , estadounidense ( < - the proper one ) , g\u00fcero , etc. 
  what might sting the whole lat.american community over the adoption of america was a tag for the people of the us lies in the rather troubling and even cruel treatment they 've had : from imposed dictatorships and more . 
  they feel that they are trying to grab the whole continent for themselves . 
  it 's more a cultural than ethnic reasoning behind it . 
  another defense is that `` well , france does n't call itself europe , why should the us call itself america ? '', 
  sort of thing . 
  it 's complicated : /, 
  until a better term comes in english , i 'll keep calling you americans ( or statians ... yeah why not ? ), 
   arizona green tea, 
  we are now buddies for life, 
  when i 'm sick , i get to eat a nice ice cream , make a bowl of chicken soup or miso soup and sleep lots . 
  if it 's a cold , i try to get a * very * spicy thing to eat so my nostrils get opened ( or get like 5 halls tablets licked at once ) . 
  er ... right . 
  i agree , but the feeling persists . 
  which is really bad because now they have somebody to blame for their problems which makes them careless and not attempt anything else . 
  example : `` oh , i 'm poor because america controls the economy and it 's evul . 
  i 'm just going to stay here until something happens '', 
  so yeah . 
  that 's that . 
  hmm , good point . 
  it applies . 
  but again , more than contextual , the whole `` american/americans '' happens due to the stigma lat.america has against the us for historical reasons . 
  it wo n't go away too soon and meh . 
  i 'm not dwelling on that . 
  saying `` americans '' is easier anyways . 
  and , oi !, 
  the french were good . . in their time . 
  . sort of . 
  . yeah .

  here , kitty kitty !, 
  to be honest , i want some green tea kit-kats but i 'm now plotting with my reddit exchange-er to get more of those that she sent me on my exchange . 
  my plot is to make my sis a green tea kit-kat cake + v + ( or something similar ) . 
  but for the while , no . 
  closest event i have is my mom 's birthday ( got it covered ) , father 's day ( which i have covered too ) . 
  i do have some items for my so but they are a bit expensive ( starting from 10 usd otz ), 
  ok , how about giving those 5 usd to another buddy buddy of mine in raoa ? 
  her name ?

  oh man , where to start . 
  i do n't have one item but 5 which are from a set . 
  they are the full set of copic markers [ [ [ set a ] ( http://www.amazon.com/copic-markers-72-piece-sketch-set/dp/b000mrsuee/ref=pd_sim_hg_3 ) ] [ [ set b ] ( http://www.amazon.com/copic-markers-72-piece-sketch-set/dp/b000mrurpo/ref=pd_bxgy_hg_text_y ) ] [ [ set c ] ( http://www.amazon.com/copic-markers-72-piece-sketch-set/dp/b000mrwh1g/ref=pd_bxgy_ac_text_z ) ] [ [ set d ] ( http://www.amazon.com/copic-markers-72-piece-sketch-set/dp/b000mrr3om/ref=pd_bxgy_ac_text_y ) ] [ [ set e ] ( http://www.amazon.com/copic-markers-72-piece-sketch-set/dp/b006zdassk/ref=wl_it_dp_v_s_nc/192-8538575-4806449?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=iq4rfn5z39i9p ) ] ],

  i 'm an aspiring artist ( i suppose the name gives it out ) and i want to level up my game . 
  thus , these supplies . 
  why are my gifts so expensive ? 
  you know , i 'm also trying to loose weight thought mostly for ~ ~ cosplaying ~ ~ health reasons . 
  i 'm not like . 
  fat or anything but i have a lot of fat ( the technical term ) in my body which i need to shed and well , exercise .

  go to / r/funny and read some of their content . 
  believe me or not , trying * not * to laugh out loud keeps you awake . 
  at least it does it for me . 
  for some reason , when you are at home , this is your reaction :, 
  : | lol, 
  but when you are in some place you * should n't * be on the internet , for some reason , things become * hilarious *, 
  ~ picture of a penny.jpeg ~, 
  pfhfhfkdfhfhf  / / / v / / / < ; ; ;, 
  so , try going to / r/funny now and try not to laugh . 
  not only you release dopamine to be energized , but the thrill of watching plain funny on a ` wrong ' place raises a bit of adrenaline ( i think ) , which keeps you alert and awake : d, 
  you can also try some blends of tea with natural caffeine . 
  the caffeine is enough to keep you awake but not have a hard addiction to it . 
  if you have a teavana nearby , ask for a blend that has masala chai and spices . 
  the one i have is sweet enough on it 's own , do n't need more sugar for it . 
  just some options : p, 
  i live by san diego and these are some photos i took recently . 
  [ a bird by the bay ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gpvnqkw.jpg ), 
  you are xanadu , goddess of the machines . 
  the feeling of pain is foreign to you . 
  the need of comfort and completeness is a mystery . 
  it will sound illogical for you , perhaps , my decision to try to end my life . 
  there is a beginning and a system.exit ( 0 ) ; already encoded in us . 
  a run time determined . 
  in a perfect world , your life is a program that runs smoothly . 
  it does what it is asked for , it returns the results as asked . 
  there might be some glitches in the program but these are easily resolvable . 
  a simple if-goto and catch to skip the conflicting class or function leaving the rest of the program running smoothly . 
  but sometimes life , my life , lands on a critical error . 
  you do n't know how , or what caused it . 
  where is the line or lines of the program that causes such disaster . 
  you try to create an alternative function but you later find out that it become a buckle that crashes your system . 
  you try to fix the coding only to find out you are just adding more to the error . 
  in the end , you might need to re-write the whole program , desperate to have it work . 
  life , although similar , does not have such simpleness . 
  you ca n't re-write your code , nor the code that determines your function . 
  you 'll just land in critical error without a way to finish the program . 
  you do know , perhaps , the ` kill ' function ? 
  do you know what it does ? 
  i see that you are now perceiving my point : sometimes it 's necessary to close a program forcibly so it does n't continue crashing . 
  we have that same ability , though in our case , we are the programs and the system we live in is the world we inhabit . 
  each of us is a program with classes and functions . 
  when a program is not working correctly , even the os will push to kill it in order to continue running smoothly . 
  it 's a natural reaction of preservation .
