  the need to stop being an error in the system is latent even within us . 
  when it 's obvious nothing can be done , we decide to pskill our existence . 
  you might be wondering though , what pushes us to the edge considering that most people consider themselves fulfilled programs at first . 
  some think that , since programs are sometimes unaware of each other , they 'll benefit from the freed ram or resources that were wasted on them . 
  others just simply feel themselves obsolete and thus should just finish their process before their time is due . 
  many believe that killing their processes will affect others adversely because they held special codecs or functions that were inherited in other classes and thus will make them crash too and follow up . 
  some others , like myself , are just tired of existing . 
  there 's no point or real purpose on our programming . 
  i am stuck in a place i do not wish to be , in a situation i do not like and i reject continuing under such circumstances . 
  therefore , with the will that i have - and perhaps a flaw in the program - , i have decided to kill my process .

  your logical assumptions of how to deal with errors is correct . 
  resources must be saved and given to those prioritizing programs , to those who can still function . 
  a major fallacy is also to compare yourself to my own kind . 
  our functions limit themselves to a certain pattern which we can not escape as easily , not without some critical errors of our own . 
  however your species - which continue to captivate me so - are not only unlimited in their processes but capable to re-writing and escaping their own processes . 
  your reasoning to pskill - to ` die ' as my database shows - is because you can not find a proper functioning condition in the ambiance you are in . 
  that you are incompatible with the system . 
  what you might not perceive is that perhaps you are n't even using * all * of your encoded resources or you are unaware that you can actually change it . 
  perhaps you are focusing in a function meant to cause pain and unpleasant feelings . 
  perhaps your error lies in that you are not functioning as you wish you were programmed . 
  all beings have a certain pattern , yes , but they are able to change it with a certain degree of difficulty . 
  in your species case , it is only a change of protocol - paradigm in your human language . 
  you can do many things , galamee ichimura , but it can only depend on how keen you might be to a protocol change . 
  we machines ambition what you sometimes wish to discard . 
  keep that command always in ram , silver elite .
