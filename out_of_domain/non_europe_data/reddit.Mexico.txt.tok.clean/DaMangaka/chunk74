  the correct ( and pc tbh ) way to call an american in spanish is `` estadounidense '' ( long word , huh ? ), 
  however , particularly us mexicans , have dozens of words for you guys in the north . 
  the words can be neutral ( gringo , g\u00fcero , gabacho ) but depending on the context/tone they can imply some sense of nagginess or anger ( specially if a word before said term is ` pinche ' : p ), 
  so yeah . 
  some embrace the gringo name , some just call names back to us . 
  1 ) instagram is still working . 
  success !, 
  2 ) this is one of the halls of the chapultepec castle . 
  which means that i have finally arrived to mexico city . 
  this is one of the halls of the castle . 
  i shall try to upload more pictures once i find a computer around here . 
  i woke up today and i 'm sad again . 
  more like ` meh ' - ish than anything . 
  motivation is lacking . 
  rolling thoughts on to why must i wake up , dress up and head to work when i sometimes do n't do anything or just seem to waste my time are circulating . 
  i am also thinking of that poor kitten i am taking care of in that foreclosed house . 
  i posted things on my facebook and an animal shelter facebook page to see if anybody can rescue . 
  i realize that just providing it with food and water is n't enough . 
  it is a kitten and it needs a lot of love and caring . 
  i ca n't do that because i am here stuck at work doing nothing and i ca n't bring it to my house to pet and snuggle against it . 
  it 's frustrating . 
  from tijuana . 
  i 'm not particularly fond of the shelters they have here as i 'm sure most if not all end up killing them or releasing them back outside . 
  i 'm trying to convince my mom to keep it and i 'm sure she 'd let me but my father hates animals on the house . 
  n . that does n't work either ... 
  he just simply does n't like animals on the house . 
  and he hates cats due to their meowing : /,

  ~ ~ and art supplies ~ ~, 
  i wish there was a page like okcupid but to find friends < _ <, 
  i want to hang out with somebody in san diego without any interests in sticking with me ( since i 'm not single but apparently being in those sites automatically makes you so ) . 
  i mean , i enjoy roaming around the streets on my own . 
  i get to do lots of things !, 
  but sometimes i want to hang out with somebody . 
  but all of my friends are either unavailable ( the closest one tending his girlfriend on weekends and another one not in the city ) or far away ( like my so , who is in tx ; n ; ) . 
  i first got into ok due the ` tests ' they did and after receiving too many ` begging ' pms and all , i decided to quit . 
  it 's just . . eh . 
  we talked and it was epic .

  - have you had a tarot card reading ? 
  no but i have * read * tarot myself . 
  in fact , a friend of mine just mailed me some tarot cards as a gift ^ v ^ < 3, 
  - do you read astrology reports or horoscopes ? 
  just for lulz but do n't take them seriously . 
  - how accurate do you believe these are ? 
  curiously , so far i 've read the cards and all , they tend to be very accurate , though there is a theory i have that the results come depending on your mindset . 
  sometimes i throw the cards to read as if i were one of the characters of any story i am writing ( particularly one that deals with the occult ) . 
  most if not * all * of the times it comes out reflecting the current problem/mindset of said character and thus the ` way ' to solve the situation . 
  it is funny when that happens but i suppose that the mind has a lot to do when throwing the cards more than fate . 
  one decides their final fate . 
  the cards that were given to me are the [ st petersburg tarot ] ( http://www.amazon.com/dp/0880794267 ), 
  holy crap !, 
  i watched this review just * days * ago . 
  ~ ~ are you stalking me ? ~ ~, 
  really , it just shows how paranoid or keen they were on drug prevention . 
  nowadays , people are asking more in the internet and kind of know what to deal with them . 
  it 's a whole new era . 
  speaking of the cartoon , what a waste : p, 
  ~ ~ si claro . 
  como no ... ~ ~, 
  came literally . 
  that football field was perhaps the longest in the world . 
  but it was so good to watch . 
  thanks for the nostalgia trip ; ; v ; ; < 3, 
  they probably did n't due to transvestite sailor senshi . 
  even though the own creator did n't make them like that ( though having girls dressed up as * male singers * do n't really make it less confusing ) . 
  still , i remember seiya being one of my first crushes . 
  . on * both * genders . 
  i just logged in to give my sincere apologies and to bring honor to your child by giving him the reddit gold he has requested . 
  enjoy . 
  i go visit downtown san diego at least every weekend : d, 
  maybe we could meet up?xd, 
  yay !, 
  it 's been years since i 've gone to the balboa zoo : d, 
  when are you available ? 
  yay !, 
  alright then : d, 
  i 'll have it in mind !, 
  thanks !,

  ~ * ichimura and joshua have one of those talks again at a local underground bar ... * ~, 
  listen , big guy , it might be hard to understand just why people are intimidated , specially when sometimes it seems that they have all in their favor . 
  it happens , you see it every day . 
  i 'm sure you saw it on your days too \\* puffs out some smoke \\* not that you 're dead or anything . 
  \\* smirk \\*, 
  i am not sure what you hold dear and i am not the kind of person to have you tell me your woes - not that you talk too much anyways - but here 's the deal : imagine something dear to you is put in risk . 
  does n't have to be a person even , it can be your career , your job , your stability . 
  something that shakes you . 
  perhaps the reason why you are n't intimidated is because you 're well solid on the ground or * tch * knowing you , you do n't give a fuck . 
  but here 's the deal : they take you that stability out . 
  it can be with words , a weapon on the face or blackmail . 
  hell , even a stare ( yup , just like that big guy \\* laughs \\* ) .
