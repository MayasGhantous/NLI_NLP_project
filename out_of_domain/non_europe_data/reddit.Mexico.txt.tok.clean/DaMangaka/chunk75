  the thing is that it shakes you , it takes you off guard . 
  you do n't know how to react to it . 
  you try to counter it but fail miserably . 
  then , a sense of insecurity traps you , your abilities and what held you stable are n't enough anymore . 
  you are facing something that you ca n't control , you actually find yourself * unable * to face it . 
  it 's just your mind , blocking itself , trying to protect itself from such thing . 
  such feeling . 
  imagine you grab me by the scruff and try to throw me to a cliff . 
  i 'd be fucking intimidated because i know how dead serious you can be and that no matter what i do , you * can * indeed throw me to that cliff without remorse . 
  nothing that i try to do can change that . 
  it 'll also be so sudden . 
  how to react ? 
  \\* smokes a bit more \\* and that 's why , even if the cyberians seem stronger than regular humans , they can also be intimidated by them . 
  all they want is peace , ya know ? 
  to have them seen as some weird crawling entity , running here and there and abiding to their laws just to fit in and then finding out they are still weird ... prone to persecution , you think they would n't be ? 
  and where 's my drink ? 
  all of the prayers !, 
  come on !, 
  send them to me : p,

  \\* hides underground , just in case \\*, 
  i remember when i got paid monthly . 
  i did not like it . 
  also , i broke my ankle at that job , though it was unrelated to the job itself . 
  ; ; 7 ; ; i get out at 5pm pst . 
  that seems way too cool !, 
  if you 're talking about colosio , narcos did n't do it . 
  well , they were the perpetrators but salinas was the brain . 
  actually , i do n't think he was pooping at all . 
  i did find some stains on the t-shirt i used for it 's little bed , but nothing like poop that i know . 
  [ original post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/random_acts_of_amazon/comments/1f4hto/discussion_i_found_a_stray_kitty_but_my_parents/ ), 
  so , i kept the kitten at the foreclosed home while i found it a nice home . 
  i fed it two packets of food every day and made it 's little bed . 
  i made sure to give it water too . 
  i made sure it had food every day before i went to gym and it was a though job to , since i woke up at 5 am and did n't come back home until 5pm . 
  though , on wednesday i felt it a bit weaker . 
  i thought it was because i fed it at 8pm instead of the regular 6:30 i did due to some issues i came by . 
  at least it was happy - though i did n't see it drink any water that i know of . 
  on that same day , though , i had good news on facebook : somebody wanted the cat . 
  we arranged to see each other tomorrow at noon so it would be taken to a vet , cleaned properly and taken to a nice lovely home . 
  i was getting to the idea that it was n't going to be mine , even though i tried so many times to keep it for myself . 
  oh well , was n't going to be the case . 
  i was thinking of that too . 
  it * was * a young kitten . 
  and the mom did n't abandon it , rather than a person who was passing by on a van ( so i was told by some witnesses ) .

  i was a regular lurker in / r/randomkindness and randomly fell in here . 
  i saw the community , saw how awesome it was and i decided to stay . 
  they 've been very supportive and i feel we are kind of like a big family : d, 
  if you need any help or have questions , do n't worry , we 'll be ready to help ya out : d, 
  i 'll consider you , however i would like it best with the sticker . 
  i 'm going to ask the person i 'm buying this for first . 
  omg !, 
  i grew up with the original vhs of the show . 
  my aunt gave them to me and i would re-watch them over and over again . 
  definitively trying my hand on this . 
  i am in the plus with my first time being a rematch for the regular one . 
  i think i made my entry too detailed xd ;, 
  professional crazy person reporting here . 
  you 're not crazy , you just have a lot of love to give = v = b, 
  i used to go at 5:30 am back when i worked at foxconn . 
  it was nice , i guess . 
  or feared . 
  as in a `` what were they thinking ? '', 
  sort of thing . 
  using the best buy that i know best :, 
  i start on the tablet/computer section . 
  grab 3 of each that is my fancy . 
  then swoop to the video game area and grab all of the cool games and consoles i have . 
  finally , if i have time and somebody 's willing to help , a 60 '' hdtv . 
  my idea is to keep one of the tablets/computer/console / games and sell the rest . 
  profit margin = much, 
  you 're absolutely right . 
  and i can actually take like 5 of those !, 
  those cameras also seem very fancy .
