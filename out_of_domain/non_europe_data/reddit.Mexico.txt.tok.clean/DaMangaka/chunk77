  hmm , maybe your favorite book is the princess bride ?

  i am wondering were is that other guy making a map with all of our territories . 
  did he die ? 
  i 've been busy making plans to clean up and tidy mexicy city .

  on regards to your message in your edit : i can not stress it enough , ** do not go to windows 8 **, 
  it is not a bad os , but it 's just freaking confusing . 
  ever used a windows phone ? 
  well too bad . 
  because the initial display it 's like that ? 
  start button ? 
  nah , we now have a start screen . 
  oh , it 's not your default view even though it * still exists * . 
  modifying your windows experience ? 
  not a fat chance . 
  i mean , it 's not a bad os on regards to reliability but you should stick with 7 for the meantime . 
  it is * very * good if you have a touch screen , but if you do n't , stick with the previous version . 
  to be honest , i 'm not even sure * why * they decided to make windows 8 when they had such a good os . 
  maybe they could have gone windows ce for tablets but a full fleshed tablet-style os is kind of pointless when your comp * does n't * work like one . 
  ~ ~ let 's not start with another microsoft fluke , the xbox one ~ ~, 
  basically : change your hdd , follow the recommendation from the other posters and get windows 7 . 
  if you need any more help , i can assist you with that .

  i do n't think 420 is just a coincidence of your mistake t w t, 
  giftcard would be awesome .

  i am a pigeon , fear me !, 
  well , this might be a bit strange but one of the best memories i have of playing outside was back on christmas time . 
  we would go to a shop to buy all sort of firecrackers , rockets and cherry bombs and divide the loot by teams . 
  then , setting the proper arena ( which was usually the local park ) , we 'd start epic firework battles with each other . 
  this was us at 8 years old , playing war with actual fire power . 
  we used to get the finished rolls of wrapping paper to use as bazookas to throw the rockets or roman candle lights to each other and of course , the job of the other team was to dodge . 
  at the end , we usually got the real guns which were the cherry bombs . 
  this was the part were we separated `` real men from pussies '' , as the rule was that we could n't exit the assigned battle field area until the time was up or the rockets ended . 
  damn , i can still remember the horror/excitement of it . 
  if your team had a guy bold enough to grab the launched cherry bombs at you and throw them back , you knew you 'd last longer . 
  finally , after an hour of assault , the winner team was who used less fireworks and had more of their team remaining . 
  it was crazy , perhaps stupid , but you ca n't deny that it was awesome . 
  we stopped doing that when we were 12 - some key players moving away due different reasons - but it 's something i shall always cherish = v =,
