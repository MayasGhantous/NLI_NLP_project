  i 'm just starting to read it . 
  . so i 'm nope-ing from here ^ ^ ; ;, 
  i think this is / r/retiredgif worthy, 
  thus the job of a `` man '' . 
  if you grabbed one but left it back or were too scared , you were a `` pussy '' xd ;, 
  we had odd standards and we were probably retarded . 
  that picture looks awesome !, 
  it makes me sad we never got any of our adventures recorded . 
  i only have one ( in which not only i took my dad 's camera without him knowing [ brave level : so ] and i started saying my first ` bad words ' [ though i was 11 ] ) . 
  my childhood was wild and awesome . 
  also . 
  kittens do not fall on their feet if you throw them to the ground < _ <, 
  [ well , this is more of a cookbook for the ds ] ( http://www.amazon.com/americas-test-kitchen-cooking-nintendo-ds/dp/b0033bjs8s/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pc_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=1sk3hv2ekyfzx&amp;coliid=i2pzqp04opj2wa ), 
  cheapest game [ would be this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/nintendogs-cats-bulldog-friends-nintendo-3ds/dp/b002i092yk/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=1sk3hv2ekyfzx&amp;coliid=i2v3qxg1kj8dxw ) ~ ~ even though i do n't own a 3ds ~ ~ . . 
  til about that sub existing, 
  girlsplaywow is a jerk ? 
  that 's not true . 
  say it is n't so ; v ;, 
  i remember your original post . 
  i do n't know if you remember me too : p, 
  anyways , as for the item i want . 
  hmmmm , for 100 usd i 'd rather like a giftcard since i can stack more money and get a bigger haul for myself , but if there is a need for an item , there 's these [ lovely prismacolor bundle ] ( http://www.amazon.com/prismacolor-premier-soft-colored-pencils/dp/b005o2zu68/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_s_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=i2mtmhout3fo3l ) ( though it gets up by 29usd , so ignore it if you keep it to 100 sharp ) or [ this crown jewel ] ( http://www.amazon.com/pok%c3%a9mon-pokemon-d-arts-mewtwo/dp/b009yp2l90/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_s_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=2serrbc122gjw&amp;coliid=i148rpmdnihlwq ), 
  i downloaded it for the ipod ( yeah , now it 's ported everywhere ) and i got hooked instantly . 
  sadly you only get 2 free cases but i 'm willing to stash the extra 20 usd for the full game ( which contain the trilogy ) . 
  buy it !, 
  you wo n't regret it !, 
  it 's one of those `` must buy for your console '' games, 
  i too am saving for a 3ds ( because the new gen of pokemon decided to be launched on it . 
  \\* sigh \\* oh well , first world pokemon problems ... ) . 
  it 's amazing you got one , more that you 're giving your old one . 
  i wish the rest of the people good luck . 
  not entering btw , but you might already know my fav game is pokemon xd, 
  . with mouse . 
  and saved as jpeg . 
  hi there = v =, 
  what i 'm striving more right now ( aside from the impossible 5 set of copic markers ) is this possible set of [ all the prismacolors available ] ( http://www.amazon.com/prismacolor-premier-soft-colored-pencils/dp/b005o2zu68/ref=wl_it_dp_v_s_nc/181-1299626-5003051?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=i2mtmhout3fo3l ) . 
  why ? 
  because . . are n't all the colors of the world ( in a pencil ) the best ? 
  and besides , i love [ making art with them ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h2yobtw.jpg ) . 
  it 's my preferred traditional media : d, 
  damn !, 
  i have n't seen that cereal in * years * . 
  can i love you too ? 
  the sailor starlights ? 
  i actually liked them better than the inner senshi or even serena . 
  seiya was a heartthrob ( on either gender : p ), 
  yay !!!!, 
  \u00bf que pex ? 
  \u00a1 orale !, 
  \u00a1 que curada !,

  . . and yet . 
  they are so blind that they do not realize this ? 
  how can they go around the world without realizing that a nation 's power lies on their own decisions . 
  not their leaders , but the people . 
  a city is made out of people . 
  a state is made out of cities built and relishing with people . 
  a nations hosting a bunch of states , provinces , oblasts - call them as you wish - they are all full of people . 
  all of them with the same power you speak of . 
  the power you and i know of . 
  so tell me then , oh wise one , tell me what the f \\* \\ ck is wrong ? 
  tell me why they do nothing . 
  tell me why wo n't they take action and move , or hope that somebody else does it for them ? 
  where is the power of revolution in people who simply like to listen and comply , riled with hollow ideas of nationalism and simplistic racist pride ? 
  where are those who realize the truth and fight to get it out ? 
  why wo n't they follow suite and rise up to demand such power . 
  was n't that even on that stupid declaration of his ? 
  the one that grants him permission to pursuit happiness ? 
  where the f \\* \\ ck is that ? 
  all i see now is a bunch of ignorant sedentary pigs who masturbate to the idea of owning a gun and becoming a celebrity . 
  i see children 's dreams destroyed because they can not comply to the masses , hundreds of thousands of other people struggling only because they try to be themselves . 
  many whom are unable to believe in a magical fairy in the sky and are trampled on beliefs which are perhaps closer to the truth . 
  the truth is shammed , hidden , ostracized , shot down , corrupted , altered to suit the needs of the masters and lords that rule the classes which sustain them . 
  and they choose only to close their eyes and keep on going until they die . 
  this is perhaps my problem here . 
  america reminds me of the world , for the world is in america and america spreads to the world . 
  a world who pleasantly closes their eyes before being shot in the head . 
  one that would rather have half-lies and true stunts . 
  nothing more . 
  i ca n't even know if what i eat is what i taste . 
  tell me , then , what am i suppose to strive for peter ? 
  who can teach them about their individual responsibilities ? 
  what is my place in this world ? 
  is there such thing as utopia ? 
  or do we live in a dystopia ? '',
