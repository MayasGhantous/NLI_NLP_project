  why do i spend my time focusing on this story ? ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ i wish . 
  my muse is in vacation ~ ~, 
  i have the whole story fleshed out . 
  i only need to sit down and type the heck out of it @ n@#, 
  also , i 'm not as confident with my english as i 'd like to . 
  my so 's b-day is on july 9 and i 've been thinking on giving her something original . 
  she 's so far away and has confessed me hugging a small bald eagle plushie i sent her some while ago when she feels a bit sad . 
  so , since i ca n't sadly be there , i want to send her a little plushified me . 
  or well . 
  pigeonfied plushified me ( it 's a curious thing here : p ), 
  i 'm actually willing to pay you if you need the cash . 
  i 'd love it in either way if you could fulfill my request . 
  i have the whole drawing ready for making a plush . 
  is it ? 
  ~ ~ [ here 's an example of what i 've written so far in this story ] ( http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7656816/1/project-hetalia-sins-of-our-brothers ) ~ ~, 
  i 'll try to keep that in mind , though i am always in the look for editors to help me out . 
  thanks for the tip and the reply too !, 
  amazon prime for me desu yo !, 
  thanks for reminding me of my childhood trauma . .

  all my good karma for you = v = /, 
  i hope e3 does n't disappoint . 
  so far i 'm seeing , nintendo has it right on the bag ( and lots of pokemon things !!!, 
  ) , with the ps4 going strong . 
  i wonder what stunt microsoft has to recover himself after committing hara-kiri .

  right , because the pippin worked so well . 
  . er , oh , right !,

  ~ ~ i swore i was never going to interfere to avoid these kinds of cases , but this is ridiculous ... 
  wait , what ?!, 
  the future ? 
  where have i heard this before ? 
  trying to kill your past to avoid a horrible future , do n't you see where the problem lies here ? 
  are you * sure * you went through the roundabouts in the tsp ? 
  - or for that matter , did i learn proper french and passed on ? . 
  listen before you do a big mistake , put down that quantum scythe and listen to me . 
  no matter what you do , the future can not change . 
  not as you expect at least . 
  things have a way to fulfill themselves even if you do n't want them to . 
  how ? 
  well , that 's a bit complicated to explain , but the important part is that you are facing just one of the most confusing paradoxes when it comes to time traveling . 
  let 's say you * do * kill me . 
  let 's say that you stab me right here in the chest with the scythe - though the weapon 's meant to slash open , mind you - have you started to imagine just what consequences that might lead to ? 
  you are my grandson , a product of a child i have yet to produce . 
  how can you exist if i have n't even made my own son ? 
  what you are seeing here is the grandfather paradox : how is it possible for you to kill me when you could n't even exist ? 
  is there a chance that you are indeed trying to erase yourself from existence and even if you are , how ? 
  even now , time is n't a force fully understandable . 
  i can not tell whether my death will affect your existence or if what you desire can or will become true . 
  the future is something that has yet to be set in stone - even if you * are * just standing there . 
  it is a fragile structure which can be easily toppled by small logical instances like these . 
  so , go ahead , \\* extends arms \\* try to take me down . 
  you are not the first one trying to avoid a time paradox . 
  my own existence , and therefore yours , is a big paradox itself . 
  under the rules of the time and space patrol , i should therefore put you under arrest and trialed . 
  unless , of course , that was what you tried to avoid in the first place . 
  the rivers of time flow but we never realize where until we are washed away by it 's currents . 
  while you can stop this stream , it can leak into creating another current , another path . 
  such is time 's ways of working . 
  another timeline created where you are able to murder me . 
  yet , how will that change anything ? 
  you 'll only change what will happen in this stream , but yours has far dug it 's own path . 
  so , go ahead , challenge me . 
  . see if you can change your future . 
  \\* stance \\*, 
  ~ perhaps , considering your lack of training , i can teach you to wield that scythe properly . 
  make me smile , rasta !, 
  [ i 'd love something like this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/hetalia-powers-russian-passport-notebook/dp/b004ud3q72/ref=wl_it_dp_v_s_nc/192-7351753-4044126?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=idth00x7wz2e2 ),
