  on the fact that how is white 2 's story ... let 's say i was amazed all the way . 
  it 's far from anything i ever thought it would be . 
  i that am a fan of the pokemon soundtrack am highly pleased of what they managed to pull , specially on a certain boss ' theme . 
  highly , highly recommendable . 
  gimmie a sec while i get the egg . 
  i 'll reply when i 'm ready to trade . 
  btw , do you happen to have a ditto ? 
  sure , no problem : d, 
  hold on , i 'm still waiting for the jiggypuff egg . 
  lem me switch them and give you one from ghastly . 
  i 'll tell you when i 'm ready, 
  i 'm looking to complete my collection of starters . 
  i am missing the following :, 
  - bulbasaur, 
  - torterra, 
  ** fire **, 
  - torchic, 
  - chimchar, 
  any of those would be fine . 
  i have good news : i actually did have a clefary and managed to breed it . 
  i will give you two eggs in the end : d, 
  i 'll be on the wi-fi room now, 
  btw , one of the eggs already has pkrus . 
  if you want to spread it , be sure to keep it on the party and if you want to save it , store it on the pc to spread even more . 
  have a nice play : d < 3, 
  ok , i 'm going to check if the egg 's done . 
  i 'll be in the room asap . 
  i 'm inside wi-fi room, 
  i 'll come in and out . 
  no problem . 
  enjoy it and the pokerus : p, 
  do you want anything for them ? 
  i have an oshawott and i can breed a charmander . 
  i have some hidden grotto pokemon and dw ones, 
  - baculin ( blue , m ), 
  - drifloon ( f ), 
  - deerling ( f ), 
  i only have 1 of them , but i can breed you any of the females . 
  i also have an extra tepig, 
  i have the eggs . 
  somehow , considering twilight , i can definetively see mornonism as a result of a very bad fanfic . 
  merry chrisramahanukwansavusnbolognalia everyone !, 
  sorry for the fuzz ; ; my internet suddenly went down . 
  thanks for the grass types ^ ^, 
  yay !, 
  awesome !, 
  thanks !, 
  anything you want in return ? 
  nah , it 's ok . do n't worry, 
  btw , can you post your fc here ? 
  i 'm on the ipod, 
  i love you forever < 3 . 
  and the importance lies on the so called masuda method in which there is a higher chance to breed shinies if a pokemon is foreign ( not from your game cartridge area more than anything . ), 
  that is why many ask for a japanese ditto : p. 
  happy chrisramahanukwantubolognalia : d, 
  ; ; ; actually , i meant silcoon . 
  turns out i confused the pokemon an it 's beautyfly that learns morning sun ; ; sorry for that, 
  do n't worry . 
  i got a ditto last night and i 'm breeding my dustox . 
  thanks for helping though, 
  i 'm getting in, 
  i got my ditto . 
  i 'm looking for some grass starters , particularly bulbasaur . 
  these are the ones i 'm missing :, 
  - bulbasaur . 
  ** fire ** . 
  - torchic, 
  - chimchar, 
  i fell asleep , sorry . 
  are you able to give me the snivy ? 
  um , do you happen to have another bulbasaur ? 
  i would love to help you for that poliwhirl : p, 
  yup . 
  all right, 
  sure : d, 
  lem me finish this trade and i 'll get to you, 
  getting finished on this trade . 
  hold on, 
  no , it 's ok . 
  i want it for breeding anyways . 
  thanks : d, 
  i would love that, 
  i 'm poking you but it wo n't connect . 
  i 'll be asking for trades , see if it works . 
  i am talking to you but nothing . 
  lem me go in and out . 
  sure . 
  i have posted it on the topic so everyone can see . 
  i 'm pretty sure i wo n't max out from the requests ( after all , it is 30 eggs per species i 'll be giving ) . 
  however , if i do , i can breed some fresh for ya . 
  btw , i love your username xd, 
  the fact that there are 12 `` will reddit for food '' makes me think that reddit is also in an economical slump . 
  current time is : 4:49 pm , pst . 
  if we round it , that would be 5 pm . 
  so yes , in 3 hours = w = ** runs in circles on route 3 * *, 
  any power boosting item is fine . 
  ~ ~ heck ... i ` dsoloveoneofthoseshinycharmsandall ... ~ ~, 
  so far i have 2 for defense and one for sp.att , but anything is fine . 
  perhaps some evolutionary stones , i take 'em, 
  i can hold some for you if there are remains .
