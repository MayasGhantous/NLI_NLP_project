  what for ? 
  `` around us , '' he heard the swedish 's voice again . 
  `` are people seeking the truth . 
  but they do not do it with the best intentions . 
  these people are the responsible for most of the atrocities happening in the world and they mock and laugh at their ignorance . 
  the ignorance of the people they decide to lie and deceit . 
  keep quiet . '', 
  `` i know that . 
  you 've stated it many times . 
  what are you trying to do ? '', 
  sweden turned , touching the panel with his gloved hand . 
  despite not showing it outwardly , finland sensed a hint of pride . 
  of completeness . 
  he felt a shiver on his spine which was not cold-related . 
  `` do you remember how the alternet is made so we could connect privately , outside from their dominions ? 
  keep our secrets . 
  keep our lives and thoughts away from prying eyes ? '', 
  `` what does thi - ? '', 
  `` i want to give that privilege to other people too . 
  they deserve it . 
  then again , '' he began to take off his gloves . 
  `` not all do in reality . 
  to have a cloud full of information demands attention and responsibility and not many are ready for that . 
  our governments have shown us - or shown me - that they can not hold onto this responsibility . 
  they are careless , like children playing at an antique store thinking that their mommies can pay the damage , never really learning the consequences of their acts . '', 
  `` they need to learn . 
  they need to be punished . 
  for centuries , thoughts and feelings have changed . 
  many of us have become more liberal , progressive and keen for evolution . 
  that is natural and is intrinsic with out nation . '', 
  the machine began to give another whirr . 
  timo began to put attention to both beings , trying to keep himself as calm as possible . 
  `` however , there is always one thing that never changes : whom ever has information - the truth - will be the most powerful , the most skillful . 
  those holding the truth hold the world to their bidding . 
  in an era where people allow their thoughts to flow freely in a cloud of information , these people will haunt and gather as much as they can while keeping their own in a low profile . 
  e-mails , phone calls . 
  you would think that the cold war espionage era had thought them something but the truth is that it only made them even more eager to trace and peep onto other people 's lives . 
  innocent people whose lives would be systematically destroyed because they exposed too much . 
  because they were different . 
  these are the kinds of fiends that we are dealing with , timo . '', 
  finland was astonished . 
  not only did bertwald manage to say such a long speech but to know his thoughts on the manner . 
  he was also showing an outward sign of anger . 
  it was not custom of him and it was making the finnish very nervous . 
  `` s-so . 
  . t-that machine . 
  he pointed at it . 
  `` this , '' he began to work on it again , typing onto the keyboard-screen . 
  `` is punishment . 
  a hacker 's wet dream , if i may call it like that . 
  in 10 minutes , the satellite i seek will enter into a perfect coordinate in this area . 
  once i latch to it , i shall run the program i have created and hosted in landonia . 
  it 's purpose is to run upon all possible internet servers and copy * all * the data it carries with it and upload it to the servers set in switzerland and iceland , all while it destroys the original . 
  it will cause the visited hosts to start a corroding self-destructing sequence which will first block all the neighboring satellites and tumble isps , the deep internet and government servers . 
  this copy will be set in * our * network . 
  our alternet . 
  in the end , nobody will be able to see that information and we 'll bargain for it . '', 
  `` w-what ? '', 
  timo asked weakly . 
  replace ? 
  w-what about the other people ? 
  the one you said that they wher - '', 
  `` they also need to learn their limitations . 
  they need to be educated ... '', 
  `` that 's insane !, 
  you ca n't just simply . 
  * ' i shall run the program i have created and hosted in landonia ' *, 
  finland blinked , staring at the swedish in disbelief . 
  `` wait . 
  you do n't mean that the program you 're going to use . 
  . is in landonia ? 
  you 're using landonia ?! '', 
  - to be continued . 
  `` it 's too quiet in here ! '', 
  `` do n't say it !, 
  do n't jinx it ! '', 
  `` jynx is an ice type pokemon tha - ... '', 
  `` holy crap . 
  what 's that = 7 = ; ; ; ? '', 
  - to be continued .

   well leaf shield was actually in marvel vs. capcom ~ ~ 2 ~ ~ . 
  ftfy, 
  it 's available in mexico as well . 
  `` t-minus 200 seconds '', 
  `` gee , it unnerves me when you say it like that . 
  it 's like the whole building 's going to explode . 
  you * know * how frequent that is . '', 
  the group of armored girls awaited while the green hacker finished her task of breaking through the intricate computer defense system she was hooked on . 
  her translucent visor would have a lime colored line go from one side to another , a visual signal of her progress . 
  yoshiko was glad that their cyber systems did not run on regular os though she took the time to ponder on whether she could alter some of her own system 's details . 
  like receiving kazuko 's voice formatted as glados , among other things . 
  `` do n't even fucking joke , yoshiko ! '', 
  she glared at the blue leader with the probable intent of setting her on fire . 
  the red bomber was leaning onto one of the servers of the large mainframe her sister was currently hacking and really did n't have any intent to go running for her life . 
  . * again * . 
  and much less if it was caused by the one who just waved her hand at her with a wry smile . 
  `` you better not pulling any shenanigans on us or else i will beat the shit out of you once we get home . '', 
  `` is that a challenge , ridley ? '', 
  yoshiko grinned at her .
