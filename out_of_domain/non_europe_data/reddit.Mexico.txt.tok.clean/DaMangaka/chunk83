  `` do n't you ` ridley ' me just yet !, 
  i shall remind you for the thirteenth time this year that this is n't a freaking game . 
  `` and yet , you sometimes go through her whole motif , ya know ? '', 
  keiko 's replied , turning away from what ever natsuko was working on with her hands . 
  the latter turned to see her asking whether this was common place among the team in whispers . 
  `` you 'll get used to that . '', 
  the purple fighter chuckled . 
  `` is n't it highly risky to have a dysfunctional leader ? '', 
  the brown mechanic frowned confused . 
  `` again , you 'll get used to that . '', 
  i heard that ! '', 
  yoshiko interjected , pointing at the fighter . 
  `` well , at least she was saying the fucking truth ! '', 
  `` t-minus 100 seconds . '', 
  kazuko 's voice spoke softly , in a mechanical fashion . 
  coming from a girl who tended to be rather emotional , it would probably put others confused . 
  then again , these were the ironies of life . 
  `` it * does * sound like the building will just explode once we are done-chuu '' yoko 's childish giggle chimed in . 
  `` we 'd better device an escape route . '', 
  `` great idea yoko !, 
  as always , it is good to have you as an ally ! '', 
  the leader pronounced with a certain hint of pride . 
  `` i suggest the window ! '', 
  the orange acrobat pointed at the planned exit . 
  `` but we * always * go using the window . 
  escaping via window is boring . '', 
  `` aww ... '', 
  minako crossed her arms . 
  `` this is the part of me where i want to punch you . '', 
  `` should i ? '', 
  sadako turned towards the bomber , cracking her knuckles . 
  `` i do not think it is appropriate to - '' her twin began to persuade her but minako interrupted her with a wave of her hand , scoffing . 
  `` be my guest . 
  just pick up the trash once you 're done . '', 
  `` is it often that you have to run away from collapsing buildings ? '', 
  momoko asked , highly curious about the topic . 
  `` why , yes ! '', 
  yoshiko replied in a matter-of-fact manner . 
  `` heck , i 'm pretty sure if we were to save a planet , it 'd blow up . '', 
  `` she got that right . '', 
  the bomber rolled her eyes . 
  `` i think i know what 's bringing japan into an economical crisis . 
  the pink dasher said with a deadpan . 
  . do n't give her that much credit . 
  * please * . '', 
  `` maybe with a bit of an effort , she 'll end up blow up japan ! '', 
  yoko giggled , amused . 
  `` oh * god * , please no . 
  minako interjected . 
  `` psh , why would i destroy my own country ? '', 
  `` why * would n't * you ? '', 
  `` says the american who plays halo every night '', 
  `` hey !, 
  just wait a moment !, 
  that has nothing to do with this ! '', 
  `` is this the moment i punch her ? '', 
  sadako asked , perhaps the girl besides kazuko that held a serious voice tone and expression . 
  `` please sadako , '' her twin insisted . 
  `` do n't . 
  it 's not prudent . '', 
  `` t-minus 10 seconds . '', 
  `` already ?! '', 
  yoshiko blinked , amazed . 
  `` she is an efficient worker , i must admit . '', 
  natsuko crossed her eyes , inspecting her . 
  `` unlike * others * . '', 
  `` oh , shut it minako . '', 
  `` i 'll give you 10 seconds to decide whether i punch her or not . '', 
  `` perhaps , '' hanako walked towards the black chaos , placing a hand on her arm . 
  `` you should save your energy for better things . 
  considering the evidence the building * could * come down . '', 
  `` and i should care because ... ? '', 
  `` is it new year already ? '', 
  minako growled . 
  `` it is new year . 
  how could n't it be ? 
  after all , it 's july . '', 
  `` well , depending the lunar calendar , the jewish and th - '' keiko began to explain before being interrupted by the bomber . 
  `` i do n't care ! '', 
  `` and i thought you were all cultured ... '', 
  `` maybe the window is n't such a bad idea ... '' yoshiko considered the option , looking at the large glass wall just at the back of them . 
  '' * can * you fly , though ? '', 
  natsuko questioned her and her sanity all over . 
  `` no , but ever heard of the screw attack ? '', 
  `` hacking complete . '', 
  the green hacker announced blinking her eyes slowly , bringing herself to full consciousness . 
  her regular soft voice came back . 
  `` we are ready to commence operations on - '', 
  there was a loud zooming sound and then a large ` crash ' when an unidentified object broke trough the large windows and entered their site . 
  the team backed at both the sound and the arrival of this new foe , who not only held a large cannon for arm , but a red light in a possible display for ` loaded ' . 
  `` aaaaaaaaaaand the window option just . 
  . well ... fell from the window . '', 
  yoshiko scratched her head . 
  `` anybody care to give me other ways to escape this guy ? '', 
  `` he was . 
  . fragile . '', 
  i began , cautiously thinking my words . 
  rethinking on the last moments we shared . 
  it felt awkward to comment it , even to svi , but she would understand . 
  she knew me and i never hid anything from her .
