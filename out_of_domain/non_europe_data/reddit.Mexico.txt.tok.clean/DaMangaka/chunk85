  yves , my friend . 
  the one who , without knowing it , had thought me to love . 
  may the alps be a guardian of that heart of gold of yours . 
  ** question 1 : ** what amazon item are you saving up your money/giftcards to buy ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/nintendo-3ds-portable-gaming-console-purple/dp/b007wrgnqe/ref=wl_it_dp_v_s_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=1sk3hv2ekyfzx&amp;coliid=i1py9yqpqaybum ), 
  ** question 2 : ** why ? 
  because of [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/pok%c3%a9mon-x-nintendo-3ds/dp/b0053b5rgi/ref=pd_bxgy_vg_img_y ), 
  ** reddit raffle phrase ** : `` saving private ryan '', 
  hmm , [ maybe this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/drawing-head-figure-perigee-jack/dp/0399507914/ref=wl_it_dp_v_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=i33lhems4rm2yl ) would do ? 
  there are : d, 
  there 's the dsi xl . 
  they are still at stores and much cheaper too . 
  check them up . 
  you can also turn off the 3d on the 3ds with a flick of a switch . 
  it 's neat . 
   i got a shark, 
  i ** need ** that game . 
  now . 
  [ this is the closest i can come to that price tag ] ( http://www.amazon.com/stained-sharpie-markers-colored-1779005/dp/b004o6m8z6/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pc_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=i2tazsogxwhe30 ), 
  actually . 
  you have convinced me of the 3ds xl . 
   i hate this smug parrot-bastard, 
  has chatot as flair . 
  hmmmm ... 
  we need a quick ball for that . 
  aept, 
  i am buying you emerald . 
  how much for it ? 
  also , can you pm me a picture of the cartridge ? 
  hey , do you still have emerald ? 
  can you take some pictures of it so i can see it ? 
  specifically , i want to see the nintendo logo that 's inside the cartridge when you tilt it upside down . 
  hmm , love right ? 
  wow . 
  i-i did n't expect you to ask me something like that . 
  i-i mean , it 's nothing bad really . 
  it 's just the implications of it . 
  eeto . 
  . where to begin explaining ? 
  to begin understanding love , you need to understand social relationships . 
  humans have a lot of these and in various degrees . 
  some are symbiotic , some are parasitical , some are out of need . 
  the point is that we humans are a social species . 
  we ca n't exactly go around in the world solving our problems . 
  whether you like it or not , disagree or agree , you need of other people . 
  you know how you are connected to the other cyber systems ? 
  that 's what we would call a relationship . 
  in the case of them , they are your sisters . 
  you are bound by a sense of kinship and therefore share something very close . 
  however , there are times that another person enters in a relationship * much * closer than that . 
  er ... m-maybe that 's not the correct way to put it . 
  here , i 'll make it simpler for you . 
  t-think about it this way : most of the time a system will keep a certain level of authorization for casual users to select and use certain files . 
  if they are unknown to it , the system will block them until further authentication is established . 
  that 's the beginning of any relationship . 
  we call that ` meeting ' . 
  eventually , the system will get to know the user and a further link - a bond - will be created . 
  the bond may allow further authorization to files and components not usually seen by regular users . 
  then , after a while , the system might be assigned - or assign itself in your case ? 
  as you know , the administrator is who surveys the system so it functions well , works with it and has access to it 's core database . 
  i think you have an administrator with kazuko , right ? 
  see ? 
  these are people * very * close to you , whom you can share your secrets - or system files - freely without any barriers . 
  we would call this a relationship . 
  in this case , chiisai being your creator - father - and kazuko being your sibling . 
  do you get it so far ? 
  when a relationship is close , there is bound to be love because the level of restrictions are low . 
  they can share data among each other . 
  \\* scratches head \\* there is a * further * level . 
  one final level of trust where all hinders are gone . 
  you put your full authorization on the person - your trust . 
  no firewalls , no proxies , nothing . 
  you just open your whole system to that person . 
  it sounds risky , does n't it ? 
  since you 're so exposed . 
  that person could do bad things to you . 
  you therefore must be cautious on whom you give this full access . 
  in human language , we call this person a ` lover ' . 
  it is usually not related to you in any way - blood relationships or kinship . 
  - and starts from the highest points of restrictions most of the times . 
  he - or she ? 
  - will begin to gain your trust - your authorization - to move further to a point where you relinquish any barriers . 
  that person trusts you and therefore so do you . 
  that ` lover ' is meant to help you grow into becoming better , and so will you aid him too . 
  i-i 'm really bad at explaining these things . 
  i-i 'm a programmer after all , i 've never really actually dated and all that . 
  you know ? 
  hmm ? 
  what do you mean you want to give me full access ? 
  huh ?!, 
  w-wait , d-don ` t !, 
  n-not . 
  i-i told you that you should only give it that person you give your utter trust . 
  w-why would you . 
  w-well . 
  . t-this is awkward . 
  the detective pressed the side button of the phone , the screen going dark as before . 
  `` well , that 's quite the information . '', 
  his head turned towards the scene of the crime . 
  female , 25 years of age .
