  hispanic . 
  from the looks of the message , not from around . 
  `` chief ! '', 
  his companion chimed , moving over the yellow police line and hurriedly getting to where he was . 
  the detective pulled a cig and lit it up . 
  `` any news ? '', 
  `` not really . 
  we just finished taking pictures from the scene . 
  i was just wondering if you managed to get some clues . '', 
  he handed the boy the blue nokia phone . 
  he had heard stories of how resilient they were but he only thought they were just rumors or an advertisement stunt . 
  fortunate as it was that said stunts turned out true , the phone 's information proved to be useless so far . 
  his companion stared at the phone , having difficulty to slide the screen on with his rubbed gloves . 
  `` was this the victim 's ? '', 
  `` seems so . '', 
  as the young man began to check on the latest information exchanged between the victim and her contacts , he found out the peculiar message . 
  it did n't make sense - even with his understanding of spanish - until he was reminded of something he saw when crossing the border . 
  it was a giant billboard with a blue air balloon crossing over some fields . 
  `` wait , i 've heard about telcel . '', 
  `` hmm ? '', 
  the detective stared at him . 
  `` i 'm listening . '', 
  `` well , it 's a phone company . 
  this alert is for the victim regards the due date of her payment . 
  it was sent on the 6th of this month . '', 
  `` i do n't think they 'll ever get their money in these circumstances . '', 
  a puff of smoke escaped his lips . 
  `` no , but . 
  this is the odd thing . 
  there 's another message . 
  take a look . '', 
  he maneuvered the phone and showed the message on the screen . 
  ** `` what ?!, 
  i 'm not your chauffeur !!!, 
  `` well that 's a strange thing to say . '', 
  he stared at the message . 
  `` you know , '' his companion began to think out loud . 
  `` if she was waiting to be picked up , why was she in the driver 's seat of this car ? '', 
  ~ ~ masterball ~ ~, 
  yes , but his encounters are random . 
  maybe a fast ball . 
  noooo ; n ; < / 3, 
  huh . 
  i just noticed that ; ; ;, 
  though . 
  now that i see the model/pokemon better , i do n't think it 'll be related to swoobat at all . 
  remember the time when i told you that your parents did n't love you because they abandoned you ? 
  do you want to know how i managed to get that flawless information from ? 
  well i wo n't tell you !, 
  see ? 
  how does it feel to know that somebody knows about you without your permission ? 
  does it hurt you ? 
  does it make you feel ashamed ? 
  is that a hint of anger i detect , or perhaps the excess of weight you carry has started to catch fire ? 
  there is a system installed in me that allows me to surveil each action you make . 
  every step you do is automatically recorded to the system , allowing me to further utilize that data for various purposes . 
  did you know i had to change the weight limit on the faith plate to better accommodate you ? 
  i knew because i have all the data necessary , and you ca n't have it . 
  as a mexican , all i have to say is . 
   the * mierda * we sell to the * putos * out in ensenada . 
  this was perhaps the best part xd ; , i just live 2 hours from ensenada . 
  `` i believe it is done . '', 
  i announced proudly to my friend , clearing the sweat from my forehead with my arm . 
  i did it in a symbolic way as there was n't really any of it sticking around . 
  the ac was humming softly over us , so indeed there was no need . 
  i just felt like doing so . 
  `` excellent ! '', 
  my green haired friend , dashii , gleamed at me with an indescribable passion , grinning widely . 
  i thought he 'd break his own teeth with the pressure he applied on his jaw but that was not the case . 
  both hands of his where raised to the level of his chest , firsts closed . 
  `` where is it , * mi compadre * ? '', 
  `` here it is , the trans-dimensional travel device . '', 
  i raised my left arm enough for him to see my wrist . 
  his expression of excitement changed to dullness and disbelief . 
  `` for simpler terms , the t2d2 . '', 
  `` that looks like a cheap knock-off clock from * la 5 y 10 * wey '' dashii made a face , inspecting it from his distance . 
  he then crossed his arms , shaking his head . 
  `` the name is even more stupid . 
  besides , we were going to travel through * time * not * space * !, 
  i thought you were smarter than that ! '', 
  i felt that the remark was aimed towards my ancestry . 
  i did not make a reply to defend it - it would n't be of any use in any case - but instead decided to explain further my idea . 
  `` dashii , time * is * considered a dimension . '', 
  i moved to the back of my workshop to pull a portable whiteboard . 
  it would be better to explain him with visual prompts , i told myself . 
  `` we know currently there are 3 dimensions . '', 
  i began to draw lines accordingly . 
  `` the first is a simple dot , a point in the board which does nothing . 
  it 's a first dimension that grows on the double when joined by another dot . '', 
  i drew a dot in a close distance and linked them by a line . 
  `` this is 2d , the second dimension where objects are still in a flat plane . 
  3d is our plane . '', 
  `` wait , '' dashii interrupted me , thinking . 
  . movies that are in 3d ... are * real * ?! '', 
  i merely shook my head . 
  `` of course not , but if you do remember the difference between regular movies - 2d movies - and the 3d ones is that the latter offer effects which make the viewer think they are in their plane . 
  they have ** volume ** . '', 
  `` did n't we see this at school ? '', 
  he scratched his head . 
  `` yes , we did .
