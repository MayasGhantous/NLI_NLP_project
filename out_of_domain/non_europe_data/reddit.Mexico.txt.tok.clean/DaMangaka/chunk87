  now , the 4th dimension is time . '', 
  i ran a line under the cube i had created to explain this theory . 
  `` it does not seem to have neither a beginning or end but exists in cooperation with all the 3 dimensions . 
  so , the appropriate name for a time travel device - or ttd ? 
  - can * also * be a trans-dimensional device . '', 
  `` but what about the cross-overs we see in marvel vs capcom at the arcades ? 
  are n't those two dimensions crossing over ? '', 
  dashii made a pondering face . 
  `` technically , those are * universes * colliding with each other . '', 
  i had put down my white board by then . 
  `` that is why galactus woke up in mvc3 and probably abyss on the second installment . '', 
  `` ahh , makes sense . 
  i knew dashii was n't going to understand much , unless we used the object . 
  `` i have tested the device with a potato and it has worked , but i have yet to see it 's effects on a human . '', 
  i tried not to sound too worried , though i did not see my friend bothered at all . 
  `` do you think glados can be brought here if we use those knock off casio watches ? '', 
  `` do you think we * can * have a glados ? '', 
  i tilted my head . 
  `` only one way to find out ! '', 
  dashii announced , grabbing one of the wrist watches from the table just behind me . 
  i did n't have the time to tell him that probably it was more of a cross universe possibility before he pressed the yellow button on the front and vanished right before my eyes . 
  i blinked several times and took the time to clean my safety glasses to make sure i was not dreaming . 
  just three minutes after he became nothing - which i counted just to keep track in progress and to not worry too much - he was brought back with a wry grin and a tall man with a strange military like uniform , seemingly unhappy with all this . 
  `` hello ... ? '', 
  i asked quietly , nervous by this point . 
  the futuristic soldier handled my friend to me roughly , staring at me with a scolding look . 
  `` please limit your time traveling experiments to appropriate time settings . '', 
  to my surprise , he replied in japanese . 
  he then gave me a sheet of paper with printed coordinates and time stamps . 
  `` this is a time sheet that falls under your organization 's jurisdictions . 
  if you fail to follow it , * our * organization will have to ... respond . '', 
  `` y-ye-yes s-sir ... '' my first reaction was to salute , holding my friend as close as i could . 
  and just like that , he vanished . 
  i sighed relieved . 
  `` d-don ' t do that again , please . '', 
  i pleaded him nervously . 
  `` eh , it 's ok . '' he detached from my side , waving his hand while rolling his eyes . 
  `` i do n't think i 'm ready for a future where everyone speaks french . '', 
  `` french ? '', 
  i stared at him puzzled . 
  suddenly , the question of ` what should i choose as 4th language ? ', 
  was answered . 
  i believe you meant ffvi . 
  final fantasy was until pokemon white the only game that made me cry . 
  that is a gap of 15 years there . 
  it 's just ... too perfect . 
  what i 'd consider one of the last rpgs where you became part of the cast , you cared for the cast and had a wonderful soundtrack and story . 
  there 's nothing in comparison , it 's just beautiful . 
  a masterpiece . 
  am i the only one that likes the shiny articuno ? 
  which is why i face/palm every time somebody goes `` omg look at ze grafics so high def lolololol '', 
  back in my days , games were about story or the game itself , not the graphics . 
  it 's part of the trifecta ( triple perfect ? 
  :p ) which is ii iv and vi, 
  man , i need to get me a snes ... 
  and in the game boy advance if i recall well . 
  still , 2 out of three in the snes : p, 
  well , for once . 
  [ n 's goodbye ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzpiorsaicg&amp;t=2m45s ), 
  the ending , for starters : p, 
  i 'm interested in emerald . . and wondering what 's that thing with the first movie thing : p, 
  what are you looking for aside from the 3ds ? 
  i have star fox for the n64 and i might get you a zelda for gba or gbc, 
  i have twilight princess and majora 's mask for the n64, 
  why wo n't we do anything ? 
  really , it makes me * angry * that mexico wo n't do shit . 
  they are comfortable living in crap but . 
  take away their tvs and they 'll make a protest ( like in tijuana ) . 
  . grr !, 
  i do n't , but i * can * get them for you . 
  let me check on the flea markets close to my house . 
  i know i saw oracle of ages around there . 
  cartridge games are still being sold/traded here where i live : d, 
  i already have emerald bought from another person in reddit , however i am willing to look for the games you want . 
  particularly the gbc zeldas . 
  i want to have my hands on that first movie thing, 
  a ver , do you know english ? 
  oh , good . 
  it 's easier this way , is n't it ? 
  how do i know english ? 
  well , you ca n't survive in this city if you do n't know english . 
  this is the most transited border in the world so it 's no surprise . 
  you * do * know but do n't know exactly where the border is at ? 
  that 's kind of a shame . 
  the us consulate ? 
  sure , i can guide you there but it 'll take lots of explanation and bus fares for that . 
  you 'll need at least fifty pesos or 10 american dollars to use the local transport . 
  you 'll notice how crossing the street there are some blue with white buses . 
  those are the `` azul y blanco '' . 
  there are 2 types but you should ask for the one that says `` otay . '', 
  you should ask before boarding , you can never really trust what 's written on the windshield . 
  you have a car ? 
  i 'm sorry , i thought you were going by foot for a moment . 
  ok , so we are in zona rio , right ? 
  here 's where we are , the municipal palace . 
  from here you go all the way up this street on the right side of us and follow it . 
  you should be able to turn right and go straight up again . 
  that road leads you to the airport . 
  i think you should know it given that you rented a car , right ? 
  well , each to it 's own , da ?
