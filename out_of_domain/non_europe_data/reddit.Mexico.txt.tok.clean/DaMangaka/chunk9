  if you already got your bulbasaur , you ca n't get another one though . 
  technically , posadas are * part * of the christmas tradition in mexico , which has evolved to you holding a party and stuff your face with tamales , all sorts of bread and candy . 
  we even have a name for the holiday period which is `` guadalupe-reyes '' , starting from dec 12 ( our lady of guadalupe day ) to jan 6 ( epiphany ) . 
  just sayin ', 
  yup : d, 
  they are indeed . 
  that and add some fireworks and rockets . 
  ah , the joys of mexican christmas . 
  you mean pi\u00f1atas , followed by stuffing your face with tamales/pozole/lo que sea ... and then ham/turkey ? 
  sounds like my typical xmas : p, 
  oh , and fireworks . 
  i think i have the same cookie cutter set as you , my friend xd, 
  after 6 years of them asking me to go to church on xmas day , suddenly they also stopped going . 
  small victory ... exceptthat i too spend the day troubleshoting new e-devices like cameras , computers and ipods . 
  do they notice our atheism and makes them have an urge to toss us computers ? 
  also , is win8 the new vista ? 
  i remember when i got my first badge . 
  it wasn ' g that hard , i had squirtle by my side . 
  many badges later , i am apalled to see how kids these days get them so easily . 
  pheh . 
  ^ awesome , i want some ; w ;, 
  cyndaquil would be awesome . 
  ^ pretty much this . 
  they are talking of baja california . 
  ca is pretty much inland while bc is n't, 
  i heard you liek them, 
  you need my fc and i will add yours and that 's it . 
  i 'll be around 8pm pst again , so . 
  i 'll continue with cyndaquil-torchic . 
  i was up last night until snivy but nobody came in . 
  if anybody wants the snivy still , please tell me . 
  i would def , love one . 
  i forgot to mention . . this is bug type vs bug type battle . 
  and yes , evolite on scyther . 
  on regards to volcanora . 
  i just do n't want to be * that other girl * that has a volcanora . 
  i want to work a team without . 
  i like to throw out surprises ( my ariados kicked ass in my poison team 'cause none expected it and it 's psychic ), 
  what about forretress ? 
  i was also wondering if to switch out scizor for durant ( for speed ) . 
  mainly what i want is to :, 
  * kill any volcanoras in the field ( 75 % of possibility ), 
  * status or field kill support ( stealth rock , psn , spikes , etc ), 
  * kill fast and furious with pokemon others are ** not ** expecting . 
  i like to use the surprise factor in my team and that works for me all the time . 
  i got in 2nd last tourney because everyone already knew about my sucker punching ariados and got to kill it first instead . 
  i 'm surprised you are one of the few that has so far suggested shuckle . 
  i want to know why , out of curiosity, 
  i was wondering if somebody was going to point that out . 
  take out edison , put telsa . 
  picture = perfect, 
  i feel that using a throwaway is a waste of time , and i am not really afraid of telling this story if it 'll help other people . 
  actually , i was thinking about these things when suddenly i got into / r/morbidreality and i found this thread . 
  so , here it goes . 
  my first instance of when i thought the world would be better off without me was at age 10 . 
  people liked me but i was also constantly bullied at my school due to i dunno . 
  i was usually called crazy and criticized me for playing with guys instead of girls ( i am a girl , btw ) . 
  one day , on a recess , i decided to lay down on the floor and play dead , see if anybody would bother to care if i was gone or not , or poke and see whether i was hurt or not . 
  depending the response , i would go and try to end my life that day . 
  though , meanwhile that experiment was going on , a friend of mine ( my rival at that moment , though that was because i had appointed him as such ) came over and pressed my thumb . 
  i had an infection in there , which made me flinch and wince at him . 
  i sat up and he asked me what i was doing . 
  i explained him my plan and he just stared at me a bit confused . 
  i shoved him away and told him that he always ruined my plans and carried on with my day . 
  around age 13 , i was on middle school and my new classmates ( they changed our groups from one year to another ) where dicks . 
  more bullying and name calling , bothering and what not . 
  i decided that i could n't ' take it any more and dedicated my last day to make a last will on a notebook and attach some mail to my pokemon in gold version with some final thoughts and comforting messages ( for as long as each mail could let me ) . 
  most of them included messages of how i was in a ` better place ' and that they no longer needed to be bothered with my odd self . 
  i went downstairs and grabbed a knife to cut myself but i had no idea how to do so . 
  after a while , i decided it was too slow and painful and people could find me so i used the knife to make a broccoli salad and use mustard to cover my rather lame cuts .
