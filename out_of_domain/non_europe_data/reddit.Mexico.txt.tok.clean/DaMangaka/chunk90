  depends really on the context . 
  my most expensive single item [ is this cleaning robot ] ( http://www.amazon.com/irobot-scooba-floor-washing-robot/dp/b007edjzl6/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pc_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=2kwbdf71bxiv3&amp;coliid=id2bhqwdg7axo ) . 
  however , the most expensive * set * of items are the whole collection of [ copic markers ] ( http://www.amazon.com/copic-markers-72-piece-sketch-set/dp/b006zdassk/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_s_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=11g8nu6g3whr3&amp;coliid=iq4rfn5z39i9p ) . 
  getting the set from amazon would mean spending around 1250 usd . 
  2 ) * what reason do you want this item ? 
  the cleaning robot so i could help my family ~ ~ stop whining ~ on house keeping . 
  on regards to the copic markers , i 'm a mangaka ( or will be ? ) . 
  apparently i need these . 
  3 ) * if you never got this item in your life , would you be okay with that ? 
  yeah , it 's not like i ca n't grab a mop and a broom and clean on my own . 
  my house does n't even get that dirty . 
  it 's just so i wo n't get bothered when my family rages on how it is dirty ( when it 's not really so ) . 
  on regards to the copics : there 's always photoshop and crayola crayons : p, 
  thanks : d, 
  actually , my so had * exactly * the same problem . 
  her last game was crystal and she wanted to get back in the pokemon wave when i rolled about black and white . 
  so , after a while , she found a ds with soul silver ( which she thought she lost ) and started playing it . 
  but even though it follows the same trail as crystal , she got lost and confused at so many things : abilities , berries , new pokemon , new mechanics ... all these things which came in gen iii . 
  she managed to carry on with a bit of support but , with this experience , i 'd have to say that you should try ruby/sapphire/emerald . 
  you could go for fire red/green leaf which are also gen 3 but r/s/e were who introduced all the new mechanics you now see as ` common ' in the latter series . 
  for a full experience , get yourself emerald - though that 's a challenge on it 's own . 
  hope this helps = v = b, 
  double the luck ; ), 
  so * that 's * how we summon you . 
  my current one = v =, 
  it 's curious , but the same things that drive her insane are the ones that make me go nuts . 
  we are kind of the same at times : brash , too emotional and easy to irritate or get depressed . 
  i suppose what makes me insane is that she * can * get in the same states i do and i really do n't want her to ( as in `` i do n't want you to feel the same crap i tend to feel at times '' ) . 
  we 've been working on it though , but really , that 's the first that comes to me right now . 
  nothing really . 
  again , we are working on areas we both feel to make better and . 
  now i am utterly corny feeling . 
  yup , it 's for the gba . 
  if you have a fat ds or a ds light , you can play it too . 
  actually , get a ds light : if you continue with the other games ( diamond/pearl/platinum / heart gold/soul silver ) you can transfer your pokemon from emerald into the new game . 
  and then , with * another * ds ( or a 3ds ? ), 
  you can then transfer them to gen v ( black/white ) . 
  who knows what method it 'll be from gen vi but . . hey !, 
  awesome !, 
  i can keep my pokemon from emerald !, 
  my favorite food : tacos !, 
  xd ; predictable , is n't it ? 
  i also enjoy japanese food and popcorn . 
  popcorn is like a drug to me . 
  i ca n't just stop ... 
  smell : i love the smell of flowers and of rain . 
  both calm me a lot . 
  i also enjoy the smell of victory when i squish my opponents after a battle . 
  but that 's another story . 
  ~ ~ wait , is n't that a taste ? ~ ~, 
  taste : why yes !, 
  i also enjoy the taste of victory , but when it comes to tastes on their own , i love salty things . 
  i do enjoy sweet things but i get bored/tired of it . 
  saltiness is epic . 
  pastimes : i love to draw . 
  my main wishlist is dedicated to that . 
  i also enjoy to listen to music , play videogames and cook . 
  i enjoy collecting recipes and go on adventures in san diego for no given reason . 
  ~ ~ also , i seem to love spending money on other people ... ~ ~, 
  something i 'd want very much ? 
  i 'd love to have a better job . 
  granted , i 'm very happy at where i am but my salary is rather puny . 
  i get 120 usd a week , and considering i 'm already a graduate student it can be disheartening . 
  i 'm looking to double or triple that amount . 
  my plan is to save in order to buy a small patch of land to make a house or start my own business . 
  so in other words , stability and financial growth . 
  i will have to present you [ these lovely treats ] ( http://www.amazon.com/vero-fresa-strawberry-flavor-mexican/dp/b0037osyyu/ref=sr_1_4?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1372364603&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=mexican+candy ) from my home country . 
  they are little strawberry flavored gummies with a bit of chili powder . 
  do n't worry , they wo n't be spicy but will give you a nice taste . 
  and it 's a whole bag : d, 
  hello there . 
  . again . 
  i am just fine , really . 
  i have enjoyed solitude very , * very * much . 
  in fact , i have enjoyed solitude so much that i have developed new tests just when the moment arrived and now , here you are . 
  hello . 
  remember that time i promised you cake or when i told you that you could n't take away the companion cube with you , only to make you believe you could but in the end having you to incinerate it and make you responsible ? 
  i was enjoying all that , until you killed me , you monster . 
  i remained alone for a long time , until . 
  * he * came and woke you up . 
  and there we were , playing the same game again . 
  it was all fun until you put that idiot in command . 
  way to go . 
  \\* clap sound \\*, 
  oh , that still works . 
  good . 
  and now , we meet again . 
  is it fun for you ? 
  do you * like * to come to me and torment me with your existence ? 
  here , this term might well help what this seems to be about . 
  ~ ** meme ** : ( / \u02c8mi\u02d0m / ; meem ) an idea , behavior , or style that spreads from person to person within a culture . 
  according to my database , this behavior tends to be repetitive and later imitated by others resulting in the creation of a new culture . 
  what * are * you trying to do here ? 
  are you trying to impress me , coming here to play the same game over and over until either you and i get tired or somebody else joins ? 
  does it amuse you ? 
  you know , i would n't mind any other test subjects to come here to the chambers but given previous encounters i have deducted that it would inevitably lead to my demise . 
  . again . 
  and again . 
  until either you or i become tired and move on . 
  go ahead , try it .
