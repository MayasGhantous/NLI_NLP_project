  people knew better not to cross into my way or distract me when i am in my train of thought , so they passed by as close to the wall as they could through the narrow hall which only turned narrower as i ended up in the interrogation room . 
  the crew that was behind the peeping glass seemed ready . 
  ivan noticed me and smiled amused . 
  i did n't return the gesture . 
  the room itself was no bigger than five-by-five square meters . 
  it held a table , 2 metal chairs , no windows - unless you called the polarized glass a window - and a curious electrical device in the middle of the table . 
  it 's electrodes wrapped around each other , pointing to where the last victim used to be . 
  our curious visitor was with his head down , tied to the arms of the only chair that had said arms and was screwed onto the ground . 
  he was breathing in a slow pace , as if dazed . 
  i suppose that the similarities with myself flew over my head . 
  i greeted , sitting down on my assigned chair . 
  i remember feeling a small tingle when i saluted him in german but my mind was quick to quash it away . 
  `` we have some questions to ask you . '', 
  the person in front of me coughed , reacting at last to something . 
  he slowly rose his head to see me . 
  his face was swollen . 
  typical first greet . 
  he spat on a side . 
  i think i saw a tooth being thrown out . 
  `` where ? '', 
  '' * we * shall do the questioning , mr seymour . 
  not you . '', 
  my words slid onto his before he could say anything else . 
  i continued . 
  `` we would like to know about the information you have been released to a certain contact . 
  as you can see , we are * very * interested . '', 
  i opened the folder before he had any chance to reply and slid to him some photos taken by one of our informants . 
  it clearly showed him talking with another man whom we have already tagged as part of the united states ' government . 
  his face paled . 
  `` i-i . 
  he shook his head in disbelief . 
  his bloated face made it hard for him to speak . 
  even now when i am reminiscing these moments , i can only wonder why did they like to kick our ` guests ' on the face . 
  if they are meant to spill the beans and make them talk , the least you want to do is give them a reason * not * to . 
  because that might mean they 'll be good as death . 
  which i suppose defeats the whole purpose of talking in any case . 
  i stood up , leaning towards him close enough to make a shadow fall onto him . 
  dramatic as it seemed , it worked most of the time . 
  `` you do n't know ? '', 
  i inquired , tapping onto the table with my right index , trying to sound impatient despite the monotonic sound of my voice . 
  `` is n't that you in the picture ? '', 
  seymour began to wiggle in his chair , already pleading and sweating despite the cold of the winter embracing us . 
  `` i-i . 
  i-i . 
  `` is that not your face ? '', 
  i pressed further . 
  `` who is that man you are with ? '', 
  i slammed my hand on the table , making him flinch . 
  `` then , who is that man ? 
  who is the one in the picture ? 
  why do you say it is not you when it is obvious there is only one you and that is the one in this picture ! '', 
  my roar did n't come angry , but it did filled the room enough for it to rattle . 
  the man began to whimper and cry . 
  pitiful , really . 
  i pho n't know !, 
  why would i phetray tse party ? 
  i used to vork with you people ! '', 
  he whimpered , already shaking . 
  i leaned back , staring at his humiliation . 
  he was already broken . 
  it was n't going to be too hard . 
  `` why would you ? 
  i can list a number of reasons . 
  it seems so easy to sell your nation to a bunch of pigs who are waiting to ravish it , is n't it ? 
  you were embraced by a land that offered you opportunities and * this * is how you reply ? '', 
  i slapped his face hard . 
  `` you do n't know ? 
  you do n't even know who that person in the picture is ? 
  are you really trying to toy us that badly ? 
  do you really think we ca n't see into your lies ? '', 
  `` ph-phleesh . 
  i-i . 
  i smacked him on the other cheek , making him turn to the other way . 
  blood was already trickling down his lip . 
  he was just * too * easy . 
  the kgb must have been bored . 
  `` well then , * comrade * is there any other explanation to this act ? 
  something to contradict this evidence ? '', 
  i pointed to his profile on the photo . 
  now that i can think clearly , asking that was not exactly the wisest thing i should have done . 
  -  to be continued . 
  edit : grammar and stuff . 
  if you want , i can deliver part two . 
  this is also inspired by a story i 'm writing . 
  it will take a long time before i reach this point though . 
  \\* siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh * where do i begin with this ? 
  ok , for starters , i like that they mention my drawing skill and lavish me with lots of compliments but it just feels so unreal . 
  the whole ` plot ' or development i had with my friends on screen either ignored through the film or displayed as `` oh , and they were saved by the glorious mangaka who brought them fame and fortune '' . 
  fuck no !, 
  that 's not it !, 
  if i would n't have met them , the movie would n't ' have existed !, 
  that 's how much * they * changed my life , not the other way around . 
  if they are famous and rich and all it 's because * i * wanted to return the favor . 
  and they talk about my depression episodes like if they were * umaaazeeenng ! * . 
  fuck no !, 
  they were not . 
  they did inspire me but they were fucking horrible . 
  i did * not * want to have them . 
  this will only cause kids that follow me go around thinking otherwise instead of looking to solve their problems like i eventually did . 
  i did not come here and was a special snowflake like they put me there ( granted , i always thought i was special ) but it was effort and work , not just my odd way of being and my talent .
