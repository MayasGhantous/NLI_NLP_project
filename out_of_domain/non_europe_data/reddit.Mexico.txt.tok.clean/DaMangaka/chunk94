  and let me talk about the * fucking * cast - seriously ? 
  a * latina * girl who has no freaking knowledge of spanish as me ? 
  there are dozens of people in my country that speak better * english * than her and the accent is * horribly * forced ( i also certainly do * not * have an accent . ), 
  megan did * not * have a southern accent for crying out loud , and my wife did n't have it that annoying texan one . 
  raulin is gay but not * that * gay , and julia is ** cheery ** not a bop-pop loving hollow airhead !, 
  what the hell with the casting anyways ? 
  was it the `` pull all the stereotypes on screen '' challenge ? 
  oh and that ending . 
  corny as fucking hell . 
  really ? 
  they all hold hands and say `` we did it ! '', 
  and people cheer and stuff ? 
  i forgot that hollywood likes to do these sort of crappy stuff . 
  next time , i 'm having alfonso cuar\u00f3n as a director . 
  i 'm going to chop some heads with the keyscepter they forgot to mention at all ... 
  ah , you came . 
  \\* closes pocket watch and stashes it away \\*, 
  come , sit down . 
  we have a lot to talk about . 
  ~ ~ ~ ~ the life . 
  of an inmortal soul . 
  i remember the talks i had with my teacher , the great immanuel kant . 
  \\* pours some turkish coffee \\* . 
  do you know him ? 
  well , i 'm sure you did . 
  you took him away just before time i might add . 
  he had many lessons to give still and i miss him dearly . 
  \\* offers coffee \\* . 
  there are some cream and sugar cubes if you 'd like , by the way . 
  one day , in one of our long walks before he decided to become a hermit for almost ten years , he asked why i kept looking the same despite him noticing me even as a small lad . 
  i explained that i was not easy to kill . 
  simply put , i was immortal . 
  your scythe has no use in me , no matter how much you have tried . 
  \\* laughs gently \\* yes , i 've noticed you have tried . 
  believe me , i 've welcomed you too . 
  until now i have realized it was you who came to visit . 
  why is it that your choice to bring death upon me is with fire ? 
  why not something faster ? 
  as ominous at it seems given my profession though out the years , i do not find that too amusing . 
  nyet , i do n't , stop smiling . 
  you remind me of my current brother . 
  \\* hmph \\*, 
  anyways , kant and i had a long walk and talk . 
  i remember the streets of k\u00f6nigsberg while it was in all it 's glory . 
  makes me ponder of how much things have changed for the best or the worst . 
  on those streets , we decided to stop by the river and he asked to me : do you ever get tired of living eternally ? 
  will there be an end to your existence ? 
  my teacher . 
  my great teacher . 
  his questions still make me ponder . 
  can i cease to exist ? 
  will i ever die ? 
  when world war ii was in it 's end and the russians came crawling into my city , destroying each little bit as they pleased , i really thought i 'd be done for . 
  but i was resolute , i will admit . 
  i was ready to extend my hand to you and have you grab it . 
  but things . 
  they do not work that way . 
  however , i did die . 
  oh yes , i did . 
  you 're not the only one who can kill figures , ms. death . 
  to answer your inquery from my viewpoint , can a person that is destined to remain in this world for an unaccounted amount of time really disappear ? . 
  fade like the rest ? 
  go away ? 
  the answer is within this same city , my friend . 
  just 70 years ago , this city was named differently , had a different identity and even waved a different banner . 
  lo and high came the russians and destroyed it all . 
  they were not content with just doing that and they also stripped away it 's identity . 
  it 's citizens . 
  it 's history . 
  it was there , but not there . 
  it became hollow . 
  dead . 
  you might have met people along your work days that have stated how their life has turned meaningless . 
  there 's no point in continuing . 
  their lives become hollow . 
  they are alive but in their minds , they have nothing to keep them on going . 
  like a ball that just rolls down the ledge because of gravity . 
  can it stop ? 
  if caught , yes . 
  but on itself it will just continue to fall until it hits a certain ground . 
  life without purpose is not life . 
  it is existential death . 
  you are a ghost in life , transiting in this plane until you can go to the next . 
  \\* sigh \\* . 
  are you here to take me ? 
  i will have to tell to you , ms. death , that i am not quite in that boat . 
  you see , to the questions my teacher gave to me - one of many - i have answers already : i * do * get bored of living . 
  my life can turn easily meaningless since i can do as i want if i wish and throw away my time as i wish . 
  but also , within his teachings , i found out that it is * one * that gives meaning to time , not the other way around . 
  ~ * it is not time that matters , but how you use it ' * ~, 
  \\* pulls out pocket watch \\* . 
  i have endless time . 
  i can do what i want . 
  it does n't matter what i do , does it ? 
  it does . 
  one gives meaning to time . 
  one gives oneself a purpose . 
  if my purpose is to remain longer than anybody can in this world , then i shall use this time to fulfill my mission . 
  that which is to help my brother and find a way to restore my city into it 's former glory . 
  i know it will take a lot of effort , but i have time and patience .
