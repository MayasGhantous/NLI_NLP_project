  there will be a way . 
  i have much to do , every day . 
  every moment i enjoy it and savor it . 
  sweet and unique , even though events can be repetitive , there is a hinge of uniqueness that i enjoy to capture . 
  i suppose that training i had to catch details really works out , do n't you think ? 
  you 're leaving already ? 
  hmm , i see . 
  what was your motive to visit me , if i may dare ask ? 
  knowing that i can not die nor i can leave yet despite of the tiredness i may acquire in due time , why are you here ? 
  \\* small smile \\* to . 
  inspire you ? 
  i do not comprehend . 
  certainly back in the nazi era . 
  my life ? 
  you are inspired by my life ? . 
  i suppose , it is quite interesting . 
  amusing perhaps , my immortality and all . 
  there is , however , another way to achieve immortality i will confess to you . 
  perhaps this might quite more interesting than anything you 've seen me do . 
  through out my life , i have done many things . 
  that is true . 
  but nothing is recorded . 
  i have kept a policy of keeping my self private and leave as peaceful as possible . 
  help my people , but always remain in the shadows as to not have to explain the reason why autumn never comes to me . 
  every day , when i greet a person , they barely know me . 
  i 'm sure that if i were to drop off the face of the earth , i would remain there without anybody to bid me goodbye , becoming a myth that in the end turns to a speckle of dust . 
  my teacher has long leaved this world but his legacy continues on and on . 
  even if the closest i can have to talk to him again is to visit that statue at the chapel , i know that there are still many others eager to understand his writings , lessons and teachings . 
  even without life , he is immortal . 
  so long as one is remembered , one becomes immortal . 
  and that , is the true meaning of eternity . 
  it 's morphing time !, 
  / * guitar riff / *, 
  where the heck is he ? 
  . older . 
  `` well , fag , any ideas ? '', 
  fyodor scoffed at the name picking , glaring at the pale blond though the eye that was n't covered by a patch of hair . 
  the pair had decided to take a trip by the siberian tundra , trying to investigate some late happenings as told and rumored by the people in the area . 
  naturally - according to the own alexandr - fyodor could n't go on his own because he would probably be eaten by a bear or mauled by dressing like a girl . 
  * literately * dressing like a girl . 
  `` if it 's not the bear , your town fold would go out and kill you in any case . '', 
  `` that 's not funny , you asshole ! '', 
  young and * feminine * as fyodor was , alexandr had to admit the young man was strong and resilient . 
  despite his petite frame and lack of any visible muscles , he was able to wield a large lumber axe with great ease . 
  however , that would be useless in the area both had fallen after one of his mistakes : a dark and deep cave with little to no illumination . 
  any light that could come in was from the exact hole they fell from , and it was already past nine in the night . 
  pulling a small flashlight out of the many pockets inside his coat , alexandr pointed it at the red haired fyodor , who was sitting down with his legs crossed and pouting . 
  the frills on the dress he was wearing were badly torn off by the rocks . 
  `` will you ever stop calling me like that ? '', 
  he barked . 
  `` i was trained to tell the truth . '', 
  alexandr replied bluntly . 
  `` you are a dick , did you know that ? '', 
  `` that still makes you a fag . '', 
  the annoyed young man stood up , arms on his hips . 
  `` i 'll have you know * sasha * , '' his spite was leaking all over his name . 
  `` that i am not . 
  just because i like and wear dresses does not make me not only a target for your blatant bigotry and misunderstanding , but i have specifically told you that i am * not * gay . '', 
  alexander gave him a look of disbelief , raising an eyebrow . 
  `` what ?! '', 
  `` what ?!, 
  do n't give me that look , you arse !, 
  what 's with that , eh ? 
  i do n't see any girl wearing a pair of pants being called a dyke ! '', 
  `` have you * looked * yourself at the mirror lately ? '', 
  `` why , i did before going out with you . 
  i always do . 
  this * used * to be one of my best outfits but i never knew we 'd be going into the middle of nowhere , had to run for our lives because we have the fsb behind our ba - '', 
  `` it 's still the kgb . '', 
  alexander remarked with the same bluntness as before . 
  `` what * ever * they are , if that makes you happy . 
  we are running from these idiots and now we are stuck here . 
  * i * am stuck with you here . 
  of all the worst possible outcomes , it had to be getting stuck with an idiot , ex-soviet spy macho who has a kink for guns ! '', 
  the cave 's walls lit up briefly , a loud ` bang ' echoing around . 
  a yelp of pain came from the red hair as his shoulder felt on fire , suddenly feeling how his own blood trickled down . 
  he whined , glaring at the blond who had not yet hidden the culprit weapon . 
  his face was finally displaying some emotion other than ` bored blank ' , though annoyance was n't new on him either . 
  `` you asshole !, 
  idiot !, 
  `` quiet , they might hear us . '', 
  alexandr stared at him , taking out the magazine from his hand gun . 
  `` and you would think they could n't have heard that fucking gunshot , you fucking moron ?!, 
  what was th - '', 
  there was a small hint of amusement on the soldier holding the flashlight , even thought he was not particularly happy to know he had used his final round to quiet the ` idiot ' . 
  `` i told you , you 're a fag . 
  a real russian would have taken that without whining . '', 
  `` says the former german with a fetish for guns . '', 
  fyodor barked . 
  `` please , do n't confuse me with ludwig . 
  unlike him , i 'm straight ... '', 
  i once got some sketchers `` shape ups '' ( you know , those shoes that were marketed as helping you loose weight if you walked with them ? ), 
  on my b-day . 
  i was expecting a ds or something ~ ~ riiiiiiiiight ~ ~ but i said ` thank you ' and carried on . 
  i did n't use them since i already had a nice pair of tennis so i said ` meh ' . 
  thing is , one day , i tried to make dad happy and wore them to work . 
  it was all nice until it was lunch time and i was very hungry and tried to get something to eat . 
  thing is , the closest convenience store/food place was at 15 minutes walking from my job . 
  so , i jolted as fast as i could and half way , i tripped and snapped my ankle . 
  i did manage to get there and back to work on one foot .
