  in a record of 3 minutes before my lunch break was off ( given just one hour ) . 
  i eventually got too uncomfortable and decided to call home so they could pick me up and get checked by a doctor . 
  ever since then , dad gives me gift cards and takes me to eat instead tw t ;, 
  thanks for the gift , dad . 
  `` what is this ? '', 
  - * le aplaude *, 
  . think i met somebody from raoa and offered me to hang out in san diego but i have n't gotten the time to ; v ;, 
  i 'd like to meet more people to make friends . 
  i 'm intending to go to this pride parade on the 13 this july if anybody 's interested . 
  that 's really cool !, 
  voice acting seems rather awesome : d, 
  some people have poked me saying that i sound like a cartoon but i 'm not really sure if i can do something like that as a job xd ;, 
  huh ? 
  a walking boot ? 
  i did hear from my doctor - the other one from this injury - that i should get a boot but , i wonder if they have any like these in here . 
  would i still need crutches ? 
  i 'll look for those tomorrow = v =, 
  at least it was bad ass, 
  \\* pop \\*, 
  where do i start ? 
  \\* paces \\*, 
  you do n't understand !, 
  how can you understand !, 
  you are * nothing * . 
  you do n't care whether you are or not something . 
  you 're just a void , a space which i only care to rant to because i want to prove myself for once that my existence is real ! . 
  i exist in this plane , whether you are interested or not and i fight for my right to be recognized . 
  but let 's be honest for once : i will be recognized . 
  i shall be granted that tag of existentialism and then what ? 
  will something else happen ? 
  does it matter if it happens ? 
  i am perhaps once of many dozens of others who wish to exist , among many billion of other species who live within this plane within a cumulus of stars . 
  of universes . 
  will my existence really prove something ? 
  is there really more value onto me to be ` real ' than you whom are just sitting there , being nothing than a vacant void ? 
  who is better ? 
  me for my interests or you for the fact that somehow , deep inside that empty consciousness , you realize that it makes little difference whether i exist or not . 
  i am one time here and then gone the other . 
  will anything change ? . 
  . is there really a reason to exist , then ? 
  an update on regards to my sprain from monday : i feel better . 
  i got a walking boot and i 'm back at work . 
  i 'm rather happy it was n't that bad but i can never be too careful about it . 
  i also got a letter yesterday from somebody whom i bought pokemon emerald for my girlfriend . 
  the sad and horrible part is that the letter seemed to be opened by an external source . 
  i got my money back and both sender and i were angry about this . 
  still , i now have no emerald to send to my girlfriend . 
  i 'm really sad and pissed because the game itself is hard to get on irl and i 'm afraid of buying it online due to the many bootlegs there are . 
  i at least got pokemon black to send but i 'm not sure how to send it to her . 
  maybe a small envelope will do the trick . 
  lastly , i 'm going to pick up a custom green tea ice cream with green tea kit kats for my sis ' b-day tomorrow . 
  i wan na see her face already when she finds out what i got for her b-day + v +, 
  that 's mainly why i have n't sent anything in raoa - and the reddit exchanges , lol - but . . . yeah xd, 
  hoping things can work out for the best . 
  i did n't even click this post and i got lost in the jungle that is tvtropes yesterday . 
  how the f * ck can that sort of things happen ? 
  \\* lee el titulo del post otra vez \\*, 
  by any curiosity , is this at the tune of `` harder , better , faster , stronger '' ? 
  i live in the american continent and i 'll be working on the 4th . 
  now , if you mean that i 'm the us . 
  well , no but . 
  my company 's from there . 
  seems they do n't care : p, 
  amonos con los chinolas : p, 
  paaaaaaaaalomitas de maiiiiiiiiiz , llevenlas !, 
  * you have done a marvelous job , comrade . 
  * happiness *, 
  * what is true happiness ? 
  * it 's a perpetual motion that drives each one of us for a goal *, 
  * what that goal is , however , is up to you *, 
  * happiness is our fuel , that feeling right before you hit the final lap when you are in first place . 
  * but you know it ca n't last for too long : there will always be the need to recharge and refuel , there is still a long way to go before you cross the finish line . 
  there will always be other races after this one , win or not . 
  * happiness is . 
  the bright light etched onto her eyelids and poked into her eyes , slowly bringing her back to reality . 
  saiyuu woke up . 
  she was in a hospital bed again . 
  she had to blink several times to realize what her position was , where she was and how she got there . 
  the last flashes of memory that could be recovered were of her racing on a bright colored race track , a dome full of stars as witness . 
  her idol was at front but she had finally succeeded in not only defeating her but bring her back to her former self . 
  something about a sacred bond , a machine . 
  things got fuzzy . 
  she had to leave , that 's all she knew , and it hurt too . 
  the soft voice of a man brought her back to reality . 
  it was hayashi , her team mate from the star team . 
  he was somewhat bruised , due to the battle royal-esque scenario placed upon them as the final challenge , but otherwise fine . 
  he did seem preoccupied , thing which made her advert her sight from him while hiding a blush . 
  `` i 'm glad you are awake . '', 
  he smiled . 
  `` how are you ? '', 
  . i saw it . 
  `` hmm ? '', 
  saiyuu stared at the ceiling , trying to picture once more the scenario . 
  the stars and planets dancing around them . 
  it was an unbelievable spectacle . 
  `` the dream road , hayashi '' her voice was soft and quiet . 
  `` i saw it . 
  i * raced * in it . 
  dina and i - '', 
  `` i hate to break this to you but , '' she turned to him , confused .
