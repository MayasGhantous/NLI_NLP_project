  his smile had vanished by this point , sorrow sinking in again . 
  `` you and dina fell off the ramp at whitestone . 
  there is no dream road . 
  i was rather amazed that both of you managed to reach mach 1 considering most of our baikas are calibrated up to 750 km/h , 800 at most . '', 
  he gazed at her , the girl noticing his trembling . 
  `` i was worried . 
  the whole stadium did n't know whether to cheer or quiet down when they realized what reaching such speed meant . 
  the shields could n't take it that much and when you both crashed , i . 
  `` w-what ? '', 
  she interrupted . 
  `` crashed ? 
  dina and i ? '', 
  realization sunk in . 
  `` where is kometa ? '', 
  * sometimes , we ca n't decide our roads *, 
  * but the important part of it is that we must go on *, 
  * life has still many things ahead *, 
  * like in races , there are accidents . 
  you just do n't know when it might be that one time you have to retire for once reason or another *, 
  * so all you can do is keep racing until it somehow kicks you out . 
  * the search for happiness races on *, 
  it was harder for hayashi , saiyuu realized in the quietness of her hospital room that night . 
  dina was his older sister . 
  nobody knew what happened after the crash . 
  it was a miracle she was still alive . 
  the baika model dina was using was obviously weaker and older - being kometa 's old body - and the impact must have . 
  saiyuu shook her head , holding it still after a shot while . 
  she was aghast , unable to cry or think clearer . 
  was the dream road really just a dream ? 
  a hallucination caused while she was thrown away from by the impact ? 
  had her happiness ended ? 
  her team mates were fine , that 's that . 
  mum and dad were worried sick but they were fine . 
  nobody knew what happened to the chairman after that . 
  it seemed all melted away from her hands . 
  but those moments she lived , the experiences , the lessons and friends she had made . 
  no matter what happened after that , nobody could take them away . 
  she had earned them , trophies of the race of her life . 
  regardless of all , and without knowing it perhaps , she had still achieved happiness . 
  time was needed to heal both emotional and physical wounds , but she would have to race on again somehow . 
  * races are never easy , are they ? 
  * you just have to keep on moving . 
  * remember , there are always people behind you *, 
  she smiled . 
  despite of all of that , she could carry on . 
  of course , from what she felt on her left leg , she would need time to heal that , patch that other , get more money and build another baika husk from scratch . 
  she 'd have to get another ai , as painful as it was having to realize that kometa was gone as well , meet it and befriend it . 
  more achievements to accomplish . 
  she was decisive in getting back on the road . 
  suddenly , her left glove blinked . 
  she was a bit confused since the obvious had occurred and never could she get the time to transport the ai into safety . 
  using a stick she was provided , she pulled the burned glove to herself and turned it over . 
  the round orb attached to it was also burnt , but glowed in a soft blue hue . 
  she approached it to her face , whispering softly . 
  `` kometa ? '', 
  `` what ? '', 
  the female ai 's voice sounded annoyed , static leaking in . 
  `` are you dead ? '', 
  '' * yes * . 
  of course i am . 
  this is just my ghost . '', 
  t-they never told me that ais could have ghosts . 
  `` of course it 's freaking me ! '', 
  the ai barked . 
  `` who do you think it is ? 
  seems that your head ca n't still assimilate simpler things ? 
  must i go and make a derivative to you ? '', 
  saiyuu began to tear , hugging the mangled glove . 
  the ai still did n't seem to pleased . 
  `` y-you 're ok '', 
  `` why would n't i ? '', 
  `` but you . 
  . the dream road . 
  the ai quieted , processing in it 's thought . 
  `` she 's fine , do n't worry . '', 
  she 's happy now , that 's what i know . 
  i was kind of sad to have to say goodbye myself . '', 
  `` then that time . 
  perhaps , in the unconsciousness of her mind . 
  there are reasons why it might be called a dream road . 
  `` i 'm confused . 
  what happened ? '', 
  saiyuu scratched her head . 
  `` i 'm not sure myself . 
  all i know is that my husk 's gone after this . 
  i 'll need a replacement soon , ya know ? '', 
  * the road is long still . 
  . there is still much to travel on *, 
  [ i tried to shorten it as much as i could , but i think i failed ; ; sorry if it does n't seem to have much sense ^ ^ ; ], 
  i freaking love sushi . 
  though there 's a special distinction to make . 
  sushi rolls are usually called ` maki ' or ` makizushi ' , sushi as it 's best sold in japan ( the rice with raw fish on top ) is called ` nigiri ' and there 's the taco-rolled like sushi called ` temakis ', 
  all of them are delicious but the difference lies on the ` rolling ' technique xd ;, 
  i can make them too , but sadly i do n't do them as often as my sis and dad do n't like * anything * that ' related to the sea ( even if the maki has only things like cucumber and avocado ), 
  mind if i put that on my wishlist ? 
  that looks awesome, 
  pretty much : p, 
  totally innocent here but . 
  there is * other * grass than the green one ? 
  well , of course there 's weed and all but . . : /,
