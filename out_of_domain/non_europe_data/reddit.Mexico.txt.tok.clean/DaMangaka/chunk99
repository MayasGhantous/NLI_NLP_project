  something spacy in my wishlist ? 
  [ black holes and revelations ] ( http://www.amazon.com/black-holes-revelations-muse/dp/b000fvqyyk/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_ns_nc?ie=utf8&amp;colid=33xe74j0rmjkr&amp;coliid=ifv2cf5en4yr7 ) is ok ? 
  i wish my parents would n't go and buy as often in there ( i prefer whole foods and local farmers markets ) but it 's almost a * tradition * that we head to walmart every weekend . 
  besides , target 's cheaper on videogames : /, 
   vega, 
  ftfy, 
  i really love my family , and they are really nice but . 
  by the goddesses , they can be so fucking annoying . 
  for starters , they have this strange mania that they are * always late * . 
  i do n't know if time flows slower to me or something but they are always late . 
  they are running around like they are missing some important appointment , even if we are just heading to mc donald 's for breakfast . 
  and for some reason , the house is forever dirty . . even if they sweep and mop it * every.single.day *, 
  let 's not get started on the relationship between my family and the rest of them . 
  i will stop now before i vomit a rant here . 
  i find it odd that they give fucks to asexuality . 
  let 's put it in perspective :, 
  - straight = ok | the way of god | meh, 
  - gay = ew | eets a sin and you will burn !!!, 
  - bisexual = `` so . . you can * still * be straight , right ? '', 
  | `` threesome night ! '', 
  | `` you slut ! '', 
  | \\* technical bigoted reply goes here *, 
  you do n't like sex . 
  you do n't like relationships ( iirc ) . 
  why is it such a bother that you * do n't * get laid ? . 
  it might be a bit odd but i just really never understood the aggression against asexuals . 
  are people * really * interested in if you fuck or not and with who ? 
  apparently , people are more bored than i expected ... 
  \\* internet hug \\* : (, 
  i 've felt that before , bro/sis/thing . 
  for some reason , i want to rescue you now . 
  can i ? 
  i like to do it , it feels nice to help . 
  i just tend to worry at times that i 'm taking away the job of other people = v = ;, 
  in your experience , which is better ? 
  co.uk or germany 's ? 
  ~ ~ if it 's germany , can you help me ? 
  it 's all . 
  in german @n @ ; i have yet to master that language ~ ~, 
  a 3 liter bottle of coca cola is cheaper in comparison to a bottle of water in many areas , specially in the south . 
  also , being able to buy ` coca cola ' is a status symbol . 
  it 's odd , really : /, 
  if only i knew to program more ; n ;, 
  i 'm a graphic designer . 
  i 'll just retreat to my corner now . 
  ~ ~ i 'm also from tijuana , so i do n't think i 'd count anyways ~ ~, 
  neta ?!, 
  orales ... 
  i would n't mind sending you something : ), 
  ~ ~ thank the goddesses . 
  i do n't think i can survive in the german amazon ~ ~, 
  i 'll check it out . 
  i 'll need to see the difference between pounds and euros . 
  hopefully it 's not too much . 
  and also the shipping < < ;, 
  just curious , what country are you from ? 
  it seems actually much cheaper in the uk . 
  31 pounds in comparison to 37 euros . 
  hmm , i 'll have to wait until next week though : with my current savings , it kind of hurts = 7 = ; ; ; ~ ~ 50usd ~ ~, 
  since i saw xerveas , i was set on getting x. 
  it 's also blue , so it takes me back to my first choice of pokemon versions . 
  ~ ~ i ` malsotryingtogetmysoy , soit ` sallgood ~ ~, 
  this does * not * mean i have to wake up earlier , dad ! '', 
  usually in english : p, 
  no butter or fatty stuff . 
  no playing videogames . 
  no food from outside the house . 
  ~ ~ fox only , final destination ~ ~, 
  mom rules upon it all . 
  who says you ca n't have both ? 
  you just need to work * harder * and it will take longer . 
  i 'm trying to achieve something 0 .0, 
  on a better topic , and taking inspiration on that same soundtrack , i must say that the one they did for the abridged series sounds * awesome * . 
  we still have 2 years to go . 
  ya know ? 
  ~ ~ also , i want my hoverboard ~ ~, 
  from the supermarket , but it has to be chosen by mom . 
  the guidelines are :, 
  - fresh fruit, 
  - fresh produce, 
  - chicken, 
  - eggs, 
  - always have beans available . 
  - no processed foods nor snacks, 
  - no butter ~ ~ butter is evil ~ ~, 
  - pasta is forbidden, 
  - bread and the like are forbidden ( unless they are organic whole wheat bread ) . 
  if you see . 
  i have limited amount of what i can do . 
  most of our menu rolls around chicken , beans and eggs . 
  it makes me go mad because if i do japanese food , it 's too ` fancy ' and not . 
  . well , i 'm not going to rant ; ;, 
  super extra ninja edit : what i mean with `` no food from outside the house '' is that we ca n't order take out or get pizza to our house . 
  or get you know . 
  . stuff from a restaurant . 
  eating at a restaurant is a treat for me because i can eat something different than beans and chicken and my mother makes quite a face when i go `` screw it , i have money and i can eat were i want '' . 
  technically , eating outside means i 'll be fat forever . 
  ( i 'm a bit overweight but . 
  . really - _ - ; ; ; if anything , it 's due the stress ), 
  as a person from tijuana , we just call them `` sandieguinos '' or `` sandiegan '' , all together .
