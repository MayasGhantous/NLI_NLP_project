panorama that we , the mexicans , have to live on a daily basis on our third world country despite being in north america . 
  troll somewhere else , besides we have miss universe . 
  for a laptop :, 
  i7 quad core, 
  some gtx m or 1gb + of video, 
  8gigs of ram, 
  the thing is that how ` portable ' you are looking at . 
  do you are going to take it to several places or just as a desktop replacement ( 17 + in ) ? 
  and does `` money is not a problem '' apply ? 
  how much does battery life matter to you ? 
  you should look at gaming-grade laptops ( for the specs ), 
  here are some of my suggestions :, 
  alienware m17x, 
  asus g - series, 
  origin eon 15 or 17, 
  or if battery is very important, 
  macbook pro 17 ' with windows in bootcamp, 
  any alienware ( or any other semi-high end laptop ) could power up to 30 inch monitor . 
  upvote this to infinity . 
  i logged in just to comment . 
  i want it * that * much, 
  that is a photo from where i live !, 
  torreon , coahuila , mexico . 
  it 's kind of usual meeting football ( ehem soccer ) players at the airport and take pictures with them . 
  that is felipe baloy and he plays as defense on santos laguna team . 
  well , i live here and if you are willing to sacrifice security , police , jobs , and government ( ours is worse than usa 's ) for some beaches and good women , go ahead . 
  we are a little more open but still have some taboos . 
  +1 guess who want to live in canada ? 
  but i have to finish college : l, 
  hurt by the ugly truth ? 
  all right then :, 
  where our government * obviously * does n't steal and buys $ 3600usd ( $ 47 , 610mxn ) 2gb thumb drives . 
  yep , ** seems legit **,

  edit : typo, 
  very valid your point , but the most important issue now is n't pollution , is security . 
  my main point of view is that it lacks the `` environment '' for developing and growing successful international companies . 
  sure , local stores can have a good economy but expanding and growing is the key for growing as a country . 
  and as you say it . 
  people with the ability to be really successful go to other countries due to having better developing environments for start ups . 
  organized crime extortionate businesses and sometimes they cause them to close , that certainly does n't help . 
  did you read my mind ? 
  i want nearly the exact parts except for the ssd ( samsung 830 ) and blu ray drive . 
  i 'll wait for the evga gtx 680 signature 2 . 
  bu sure to give me pics !!!, 
  when its done . 
  very interesting articles . 
  however there is a difference . 
  vacationing places are rather safe for a week visit or so but staying here the rest of your life is another matter . 
  so it can not be compared visiting a beach than going for a walk in a non-touristic city . 
  it 's your cakeday ? 
  have an upvote . 
  blustacks beta is pretty good but you cant load google play store . 
  it can sideload apks however . 
  it doesnt have the typical android homescreen layout either . 
  i only used it to get the extra dropbox space apk install . 
  since it is a virtual machine it can get a little resource intensive . 
  true . 
  do n't feel bad . 
  here take this . 
  best i can do are three plagues . 
  there were some apks floating around xdadevelopers forums that gave you 3 or 23 extra gb on dropbox since they were extracted from htc devices . 
  all threads are now closed so with luck finding them . 
  i still have the 3gb tho . 
  what 's this ? 
  dam , you have an near-exact image of my next build . 
  just that i prefer kingston hyperx genesis ram ( grey ones look pretty slick ) i will stick with the sabertooth . 
  it has a 5 year warranty and my build colors will be black and white so the asus deluxe wont match . 
  a good gtx 680 im looking at is the msi twin frozr iii or if they get out the lightning out by summer i will buy that instead . 
  galaxy nexus gsm unlocked . 
  will work in us and in europe and i think that it is also 3g capable in europe . 
  best option . 
  i call it reddit mode . 
  and just when you thought it would be an interesting article ... 
  very nice rig , i 'm saving for something similar but with the asus sabertooth and i7 3770k , 
  * $ 60 bucks ?? 
  * that 's like a full benjamin off !, 
  where did you get it ? 
  i will add a second gtx 680 maybe in a year from now ,, 
  the mobo has a 5-year warranty and also i like the sabertooth design . 
  * pop culture * that 's where she belongs , still not as awesome as the internet culture . 
  nicki minaj is like a bad imitation of lady gaga , gone wrong ** horribly ** wrong . 
  as one of reddit 's favorite words here i ftfy :, 
  *** nope ***, 
  i remember using tunewiki since the old days it was available in cydia as a jailbreak app . 
  i liked the smiley logo better . 
  i do n't hate pop culture , it 's good but i think it is behind the interwebz on an `` awesomeness '' scale . 
  for the comparison between the two singers i mean lady gaga is `` bigger '' in an artistic and creative side than nicki minaj . 
  beat this americans ... 
  * touch\u00e9 *, 
  * sharing is caring ... *, 
  [ maybe ... ] ( http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5181/5568765525_65d8043da0.jpg ), 
  and then you play call of duty some more . 
  upvote for jarhead reference , which i watched last night for 5 ^ th time . 
  the asus sabertooth z77 mobo is awesome . 
  wow , til that . 
  thanks !, 
  mexico , about $ 550 usd . 
  good that today i flashed m5 because if i had flashed b35 right now i would be frustrated . 
  ca n't wait to see the final `` 1.0 '' version .
