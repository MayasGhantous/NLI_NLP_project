  fail . 
  once it happened to me . 
  rebooted around 3 times a day randomly . 
  each time the battery took a 10 % hit i dont know why . 
  stopped flashing nightly roms and it ended . 
  i just imagined you as a pyro ( tf2 ) ninja . 
  all crazy with black clothes sneaking to burn his dick . 
  good ol' power of 4chan, 
  salsita : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irreligion_in_mexico,

  no love for zapopan . 
  i got my first pair until my senior year at highschool . 
  i was amazed at the possibility of reading faaaar away . 
  i think it 's more like ... tree fiddy . 
  chocolate milk is the best kind of milk . 
  because your mom keeps studying here . 
  petting a tiger , puma , cougar . 
  around 13 but i was the hairiest one of my friends . 
  [ best video ever . ],

  make a post on reddit telling he is shit and earn karma . 
  or go to the speech and raise a reddit sign . 
  from another thread . 
  lol, 
  buy the phone carrier locked , aka , off contract . 
  i think of myself as someone who is very intelligent thanks to reddit and not an idiot who spends hours ( ! ), 
  daily on facebook . 
  disasters dont give us a message . 
  stop being stupid . 
  / thread .

  make a dam livestream from a nuclear vault and fuck everything happening in the world ( steve j 's death , hurricanes , alien invasions , etc ), 
  and sadly ... 
  us ' neighbour ... mexico . 
  form follows function . 
  that was a problem i was having like 2 weeks ago . 
  dropbox or gdrive ? 
  dropbox * is better * but gdrive is integrated into google and its services ... decisions ... 
  i ended with dropbox because of several reasons :, 
  * it works flawlessly in ios/android/pc / mac / ** linux **, 
  * it was built to provide a quality service , unlike google who only seemed to rush to the cloud storage race . 
  * even though pricing is higher , dropbox has the option to upgrade via referrals or awesome contests . 
  * more settings controls in pc/mac client than simply ` upload ' . 
  one thing gdrive is better is at editing documents because of google docs but if i want to take random notes on mobile and later see them in my computer then i use evernote . 
   e intentando encontrarle culpables a su derrota, 
  i never jumped aboard the ship . 
  there are far too many chat clients . 
  cross platform or not they keep using pins or usernames . 
  can not compete with the simplicity of whatsapp that automatically uses your number . 
  you do n't need to set up anything . 
  it just works . 
  that is why people love it . 
  the roms ? 
  the nandroid backups fuck up my storage . 
  needs more boobs . 
  mine are ~ 2gb rom + app/data . 
  i can not use the cloud because of my shitty internet connection . 
  usb is faster . 
  bitch had it coming . 
  i 'm an addict to tf2 . 
  at one time i played 5 hours a day . 
  usually ~ 2-3 hours . 
  on finals week last year i uninstalled it . 
  it worked kindof . 
  i studied but afterwards i felt kind of ... * empty *, 
  it has hspa + which t-mo supports . 
  a sound of thunder . 
  watched it and thought it was an awesome movie with the ideas of wrecking the space-time order of evolution . 
  and dinosaurs !, 
  watched it again this summer and the special effects suck ass so badly . 
  i 'm a beautiful person . 
  ( every swiftkey user is apparently . . ), 
  1 - nothing at all, 
  3 - yes, 
  nope . 
  i 'll take sunlight reading over blackest blacks any day . 
  i live in mexico . 
  it 's more like a 2nd world country . 
  i bought the nexus * on may * for around * 450 us dollars subsidized * . 
  off contract was about 1k . 
  *** a thousand fuckin dollars *** .
