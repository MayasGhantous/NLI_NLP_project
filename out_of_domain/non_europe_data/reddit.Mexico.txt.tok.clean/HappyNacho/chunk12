  that is a rom functionality . 
  mostly , if you talk in english to your friends in mexico , you are tagged as someone wanting to feel american instead of someone who learns another language to have success . 
  best recommendation so far . 
  el rey is the best mexican song by far . 
  why ? 
  because almost everyone knows it and it is not banda/northern . 
  pura debito ftw !, 
  we need a tb sale . 
  you know why ? 
  because it has one of the few left governments in the country . 
  the rest of mexico is controlled by right wing pri and pan parties . 
  in mexico is still $ 2 . 
  i hate chinese even more ... 
  that actually ... nails it . 
  thanks slowpoke . 
  '' / r/android is not tech support '',

  the . 
  '' / r/android is not a place to ask what phone you should get '', 
  i have become pretty good at it ... being rejected . 
  however i also have learned to give 0 fucks . 
  like on wednesday . 
  ( we are at some student committee at university ), 
  - `` hey today we got really early out do n't we ? 
  you can arrive to class on time today '' ( everyone always arrives late because of the meetups ), 
  - `` yeah , but i have already finished my classes for today . '', 
  - `` so you are not going to drawing class or something ? '', 
  industrial designer or something ), 
  - `` nope going home now '', 
  - `` okey then , hey are you doing something on friday ? '', 
  - `` ummm no why ? '', 
  - `` wan na go out and grab a coffee ? '', 
  - `` sorry , i have a boyfriend . '', 
  - `` i see ... see you next week '', 
  turn around and leave . 
  having a negative answer is better than having no answer . 
  why are fast cars so wanted when there are already cheaper and working cars ?? 
  stupid question . 
  * my view from somewhere in mexico *, 
  i thought you were a 16 y/o swedish girl , not some 19 y/o dude . 
  awesome, 
  osea con red 3g ? 
  y * rt *, 
  o algo mas simple como tunnelbear . 
  not valid, 
  op is correct, 
  se referir\u00e1 al hardware . 
  porque android es made in usa . 
   obsoleto , ta, 
  the marriage syndrome . 
  more like genetically since it is in our nature to try to find the best partner to mate with .

  umm . . galaxy nexus , one x/x + , siii ( 4.8 ) , optimus g are flagships at that resolution and screen size . 
  even in your own flair the one xl at 4.7 is 720p ... 
  they still sell them . 
  galaxy note 3 = 6 phablet !, 
  i currently sit around at ~ 29gb of music . 
  i have all kinds of music and i listen to them . 
  in my 16gb gnex i can trim a lot because i am not away from home a lot of time . 
  but for home use i want to hear all my library without using my laptop . 
  include that some tv series ( i think watching movies in a tablet is a waste of space ) . 
  some 10gb more ... 
  and apps !, 
  lots of them . 
  specially hd games . 
  so unless they start making 128gb tablets , microsd is a must for me . 
  i was really busted at no 64gb nexus 10 . 
  it is a hd media consumption device , why cap it at 32gb ? 
  asphalt 7 is useable on the nexus 7 but i do n't know if it is playeable on a 10 in . 
  hd games that i have bought include gta iii , batman , asphalt 6 & 7 , modern combat . 
  those are 1gb + . 
  others like the humble bundle for android are around ~ 200mb for the tablet versions . 
   the nexus maxes out at 32gb, 
  i know . 
  i did n't thought about the keyboard 's extended capacity ability . 
  the infinity sounds very good now . 
  128gb is more than enough for me . 
  i used it a couple times to manage my music library . 
  it went from everything in / music / to music/artist/cd / tracks too bad i sold my ipodt to buy my nexus , i cant do that anymore . 
  * scandinavia tendria el nivel de vida mas alto del mundo . 
  * islamic asian celiphate seguiria en conflictos . 
  china , chile , canada y japon quedarian casi igual . 
  seria bastante interesante . 
  paypal or google wallet i think . 
  budget : galaxy nexus, 
  money 's no object : galaxy siii or iphone 5, 
  not sure if true or joke news ... 
  anyways , i do n't see skyrim run on arm processors . 
  if microsoft locked down the x86 version aka windows 8 . 
  it would be a walled garden like the ipad . 
  thank you sir . . so much . 
  yes, 
  which they wo n't do . 
  as some other comment here there would be mass retaliation against microsoft . 
  what about love thieves ? 
   f.lux is a program for os x , windows , linux and ios that adjusts the colors of your screen to reflect warmer light at night so that your eyes are n't strained when using your phone in the dark . 
  ftfy, 
  lol , underage . 
  the age of majority in mexico is 18 most start drinking about 16/17 yo .
