  worse would be accepting it and then spitting it out . 
  as a northern , i can confirm arrachera is fucking delicious . 
  it only has cloudy background and not all the other thignsd of the past post here on movie posters . 
  say hi to htc ... 
   like jumping from the n64 straight to a gaming pc, 
  i imagined going from super mario 64 to skyrim with i7 and gtx . 
  mexico - if it is the same as my galaxy nexus , $ 1000 usd . 
  also ... telcel . 
  i did that ... when i was 11 and used floppies . 
  400px seemed a lot of pixels ... 
  siempre tan interesante foo_fighter . 
  / honesty, 
  / r/spacedicks, 
  i love you . 
  specially considering the shelby 1000 costs upwards of $ 200,000, 
  i see what you did there ... 
  mexico - well usually everyone at some point ( ~ 12-14 yo but can go further ) has written our own variation of l337 5p34k , usually without numbers . 
  sso00meethhiiingg llikkeee ttthiisss . 
  kills my eyes . 
  second , everyone 's source from memes is facebook so they know shit about them and how to use them properly . 
  or if they like them a bit more , 9gag . 
  yep , even when i show them this wonderful land of reddit it is too complicated for them to read it . 
  so they keep going to the idiot site . 
  we have some national memes :, 
  * [ pena nieto , our just elected president for the next 6 years . ], 
  ( http://assets.diylol.com/hfs/db0/ecd/b3a/resized/epn-meme-generator-hi-my-name-is-enrique-pena-nieto-guelcome-to-jackass-3842ca.jpg?1342007103.jpg ), 
  because he does n't know shit about speaking in english and he gives english speeches anyways , so it always sounds awful . 
  * [ juay de rito , a national news reporter that also does n't know english when interviewing anthony hopkins . ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxjn6q1griw ), 
  * [ the ay si ay si , the bastardization of we got a badass over here . 
  which is something like condescending and sarcastic . 
  * [ no se quiera pasar de verga , a cholo-naco-low class punk . 
  ] ( http://quejalada.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/que-5.9-no-sube-a-6-meme-cholo.jpg ), 
  literal translation `` do n't try to be a dick with me '' . 
  `` i got a 3 in the exam and it doesnt go up to 7 ? 
  professor do n't try to be a dick with me '' or `` today snowed but there is class tomorrow ? 
  do n't try to be a dick with me , teacher '', 
  other than that mostly are english memes with spanish text randomly used correctly . 
  if i remember more i 'll update . 
  as a mexican , i can confirm this . 
  also read my comment ^ ^, 
  i always named him ` no se quiera pasar de verga ' cholo . 
  the correct one is / r/memexico, 
  a bad haircut can even kill a hb9 . 
  interjet all the way dude ...

  / r/buyitforlife, 
  well i have 2 things that have lasted a couple years :, 
  1 - swiss multitool . 
  very dam useful !, 
  got it as a gift . 
  2 - converse . 
  seriously . 
  the best 30 bucks i 've ever spent . 
  on may they turn 5 . , 
  so if they it were discontinued for some years like the camaro they would me more looked up to ? 
  i make this post because i love the mustangs , their sound , their looks , the culture . 
  they are rather cheap the 00s-04s ~ 10k or less but because of the bashing sometimes i think it would be better if i just bought a boring civic . 
  not for life but mine have now endured half a decade . 
  it 's not like i have a lot either . 
  only 4 pairs and ironically the converse seem the least wasted . 
  you ... are completely right . 
  at pre 3.0-4 .0 era android was the ` horrible ' experience land without apps or refinement and now android is the bleeding edge and ios outdated . 
  ( not in apps but os ), 
  alt1040 , bitelia , etc. 
  hazme el chingado favor, 
  that 's the circlejerk around multitools there .
