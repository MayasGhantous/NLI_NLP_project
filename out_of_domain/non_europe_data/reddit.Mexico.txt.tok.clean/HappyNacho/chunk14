  over 5 years of experience have made me pretty badass . 
  it always shows up the n00b accusing you of aimbotting/hacking / being a bot . 
  feels good . 
  * if counter strike * red bull, 
  studying that but i started with nes as a toddler then n64 and moved into win95 using a dial up connection . 
  well then pay for your own copy of halo !,

  que pendejada de post . 
  as a mexican , i can confirm that is not a poncho . 
  same , since i live with my uncle/aunt and not my parents they have no obligation to have me in their house ... just hanging on until i finish university ... 
  the video that most marked me was 3 guys 1 hammer ... that and a serbian film, 
  it 's the same here in n.america , search `` narco beheading rivals '' . 
  that 's a video of beheading a pair of sicarios , one with a chainsaw and the other with a machete . 
  yep ... yay mexico . 
  he deserves a darwin award . 
   as for the future of al qaeda , the statement said that it would no longer be a terror network but would become `` more of a social network , '' offering reviews of new music , movies and video games . 
  i thought for a second i was in the onion ... 
  later i thought `` this is really awesome in an odd way '' . 
  then came to post this comment and saw the subreddit . 
  almost reddit ... almost, 
  home : google music for the streaming . 
  on the go : doubletwist , it 's beautiful and complements the alarm app . 
  no , it 's a taco , a real one but fried . 
  second : tunnelbear , free for up to 1.5 gb a month . 
  this . 
  `` pride should be reserved for something you achieve or obtain on your own , not something that happens by accident of birth .

  you mean in 2014 ? 
  quad core 1080p began in 2012 ... 
  neither the standard swiftkey , it is related to flags in text inputs telling keyboards `` suggestions on/off '' . 
  a little win for us , mexican law has just passed that every carrier has to unlock your cellphone if you just ask for it . 
  fuck telcel and long live android !, 
  i can confirm beautiful women indeed . 
  i want to spend more time in g + but it seems so easy to type facebook.com instead of plus.google.com hence the redirection . 
  also i want to stop using facebook altogether . 
  neta ? 
  no mames . . 
  interesting ... 
  ohhh yeah ? 
  i have even a greater rage because i 'm us ' neighbor . 
  hello everyone from mexico . 
  this post should be taken down . 
  no , because the same question implies that they are better so it 's not a question , it 's a statement . 
  also , it is subjective . 
  rage is filling me now . 
  there is a red liquid pouring over my shoulder ... but it 's salsa , since i 'm a nacho . 
  might sound like a douche but depends on how much tech literate the person is . 
  a knowing person will not give you more than $ 200 and maybe an average person between $ 300 and $ 400 . 
  works for me , using nova prime . 
  dat chromebook . 
  ( custom rom , no stock ) porque el que tu me dijiste es el firmware y version de android . 
  ese paranoid android con pie se ve excelente . 
  that inspired horror to young me . 
  ** ftfy **, 
  hardware : htc, 
  software : nexus, 
  if you want latest updates when they get out go for it . 
  if you do n't absolutely want them stay with the x. 
  it is n't a huge leap like if you went from gn to nexus 4 . 
  the chat font size is incredibly tiny . 
  other than that it seems more refined but no holo . 
  i prefer xda 's holo plus whatsapp . 
  screen it could n't say since i have n't seen a n4 in real life , but judging from the photos the one x is still along s3 the camera king , we 'll have to see how xperia z stacks up . 
  to put it up to you it 's more like this in camera quality . 
  * galaxy nexus = 5/10 - bad, 
  * nexus 4 = 7/10 not that bad but ` ok ', 
  * htc one x = 8.5 or 9/10 great photos . 
  here you go : http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1624514, 
  i like more your implementation of menus but the holo in the chats and main screen seem better imo . 
  missed that it was the l version . 
  so since it 's not the stock one x the n4 definitively wins .
