  edit : after 20min servers are functioning and i can finally download . 
  someone else beat you to it . 
  it works now , 
  exynos is unlikely since it 's samsung `` personal '' brand of socs . 
   / r/android is not for suggestions !, 
  ask here . 
  : oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, 
  and what the fuck does this has anything to do with mexico ? 
  `` oh look , a news story about some latins that according to my opinion look mexican !, 
  better post this in their national subreddit even though it has nothing to do with them ! '', 
  lol , google-translate better next time you idiot . 
  examen, 
  fin . 
  it was awesome . 
  i have never learned how to ride a bike , since i 'm at college now it seems embarassing . 
  good thing i have a car . . 
  are the foo fighters planning to come to mexico ? 
  i would do anything to see you guys live . 
  nachos with salsa or cheese ? 
  reading in english every piece of my life since i got my own computer in 2010 . 
  i even spot typos faster in english than in my native language . 
  will * the rest of the fucking world * ever going to get google voice ? 
  fall, 
  so you made a self post so that downvotes wo n't affect you ... 
  downvote anyway . 
  same, 
  cool, 
  please post to / r/androidquestions, 
  nope , you need to erase the post and make a new one in / r/androidquestions, 
  thanks for the repost . 
  is this a serious question or / r/androidcirclejerk is leaking out ? 
  thanks for the repost . 
  * never again *, 
  ahi seria mas un problema de la barrera de idioma no ? 
  maybe ... 
  trauma de por vida . 
  i think i still have it ... somewhere ... 
  same , gsm gnex, 
  used duolingo for a couple days too , then formal classes in collegue because ... 
  it 's free !, 
  anyways , there is a difference . 
  as someone already said , try learning the articles with nouns . 
  if you want to improve spanish that is strictly medical related , then you got no option but the courses . 
  if you want to learn normal spanish , live here for the summer , make friends , interact with people etc. 
  like the us , if you want a job you need a work permit . 
  which i do n't know the procedures for americans or if they give summer only jobs . 
  you could volunteer teaching english somewhere for free . 
  if you want more answers please post to / r/mexico instead , since they got over 10,000 subscribers and here only 200 . 
  edit : porque los downvotes ? 
  de todas formas my next is el moto x phone . 
  oraaaaaaaleeeee, 
  personal best wtf of february - 2013 . 
  blogspam !, 
  good post man , the comments ( if you understand spanish ) are hilarious . 
  my favorite one was the one someone ask the dude in the chair to hold it and then slaps it from his hand . 
  / r/cringe gold, 
  ftfy !, 
  i give you the gift of lazarus : it will change your life :, 
  [ click me ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lazarus-form-recovery/loljledaigphbcpfhfmgopdkppkifgno?hl=en ), 
  has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like ? 
  pc master race !, 
  loooooooooool, 
  like fucking seriously ? 
  thank you captain hindsight . 
  like if all / r/gaming already did n't knew . 
  nope , not even a single person noticed it . 
  thanks for informing us . 
  no really ??? 
  i thought the future of playstation would be the re-release of ps2 super-anorexic 9000 . 
  hey, 
  / r/androidcirclejerk is that way -- , 
  oww no ... that is not android circlejerk , just technology circlejerk . 
  i want an app that has the ability to stop this kind of shitty threads every week . 
  i love when mexico does this kind of awesome things . 
  i prefer that people do n't post an article about 2 lines mentioned in the event 10 times from different blogs just minimally worded different . 
  and you already know they did n't unveiled a new console , they just showcased games and the controller . 
  i see what you did there . . 
  it must have felt so good . 
  may be more powerful than the * average * pc but any gaming pc blows away ** any ** console . 
  if you can shit enough money yes it can . 
  actually $ 1000 is the `` sweet spot '' to building a gaming pc according to / r/buildapc . 
  up to $ 2000 it 's a high end . 
  upwards is mainly just wasting money . 
  anyways the ps4 will not be released until possibly 2014 , which by then we will have even more powerful pc hardware . 
  duuuudddeeee , i got almost 700 hours on gameplay since last year , that 's almost 2 daily , every day . 
  ( some days i also got like 5 hours sessions . ), 
  got any advice to motivate the fuck up and go to the gym ? 
  dude , third pic ... you are a beast !, 
  great job !, 
  i 'm just starting manhood and never made any excercise besides running . 
  gon na start ss now . 
  cool !, 
  you do n't know nothing about specs do you ? 
  ok , you do n't know * anything * about specs . 
  still that is not an opinion , it is a fact that more ram does n't make your phone faster . 
  welcome to mexico !, 
  ics and jb search bar . 
  check your launcher . 
  so it just appeared from nowhere ? 
  holo yolo it 's holo or nothing !,
