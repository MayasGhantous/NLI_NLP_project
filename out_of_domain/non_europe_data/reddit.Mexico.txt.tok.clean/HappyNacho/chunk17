  have you not used the v2 ? 
  it can now be used by a data connection besides the wifi option . 
  wifi is unlimited but the data is limited to 1gb of usage per month . 
  i remember i could do it in an ipod touch ( jailbroken ) via a vnc server however all the vnc i have tried for android are laggy and fuck up my keyboards until i restart my gn . 
  you are right , apologies . 
   some of the highest phone rates among developed countries . 
  this made me happy . 
  now it is at 20955 .

  so far i have quit tf2 , which i have logged 600 + hours ... * in the last year * so made it harder to play : deleted the whole 15gb game and uninstalled steam . 
  only after 3 days but it feels one of the best decisions i 've ever made . 
  definitively feels good . 
  there is soooo much room for activities . 
  what do you do now ? 
  i 'm going to start lifting and improve what i 'm learning at school , german and programming .

  skype o si puedes conseguir el tan famoso us-exclusive , google voice . 
  if you compare the latest pre-m build to the m , there are maybe a few bugs ironed out , but still both are incredibly stable so i do n't get the point of `` how do you feel about it ? '', 
  wow such an original *** mockup ***, 
  it is absolutely not the g + app with the facebook logo . 
  jomisebo is n't demoting a child ... it is a fetus .

  yeaaahhh i do n't think so ... 
  life * per se * yes , even the minimal cell is life but a * human life * as stated by law is when a child takes its first breath and it 's granted the same rights as every other person . 
  you are right , should n't have to replied in the first place .

  short term :,

  long term :, 
  learn how to make electricity using solar power .

  1 - not going to a reunion tour of soda stereo . 
  ( latin rock band ) the vocalist cerati went into coma in early 2010 and may never wake up . 
  2 - choosing the wrong girl in high school , i had a friend of over 10 years that pretty much was my best friend and when i met one of her friends i fell hard for her . 
  i even invited the other to my hs graduation and she did n't went . 
  i regret not chosing my friend a lot .

  it mazes me all the thigns we can do actually , wonder what could we do in 10 years , 25 ? 
  well . . the one i took was possibly the unsafest one . 
  passing through zacatecas , torreon and cd . 
  actually it depends which part of texas do you want to go to . 
  meet new people, 
  make friends, 
  it seriously works . 
  what i did was :, 
  join a student committee . 
  learn a new language in classes . 
  made some really good friends from those 2 .
