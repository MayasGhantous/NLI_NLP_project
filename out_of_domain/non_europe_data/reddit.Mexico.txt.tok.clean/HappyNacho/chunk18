  the s4 is a few weeks away .

   / r/android is not a place to ask which phone to get, 
  `` if you could argue with religious people there would be no religious people . '',

  `` i choose to believe that the white light people sometimes see ... they 're all just chemical reactions that take place when the brain shuts down ... 
  there 's no conclusive science . 
  my choice has no practical relevance to my life , i choose the outcome i find more comforting ... 
  i find it more comforting to believe that this is n't simply a test . '', 
  i 'm surprised he did n't knew it was canada ... beard , axe , flannel shirt , all checks out . 
  from this moment i will google every location first .

  i can stand a lot of bullshit but this was/is too much . 
  fuck mobile, 
  dafuq did i just watched ? 
  the ... fuck ... 
  try the nvidia shield . 
  stream from pc games to it . 
  $ 250 3ds launch vs shield 's rumored $ 400, 
  gets you a fuckload of more features , it may be overpriced if you do n't care about :, 
  * hdmi out, 
  * a complete os ( stock android ), 
  * 720p hd screen ( are you gon na tell me 3ds ' 800 \u00d7 240 is better ? ), 
  * quad core a15 vs 3ds ' dual a11 at 280mhz ** lol **, 
  * microusb ( standard charging and all the uses musb also have ), 
  * geforce custom gpu vs single pica200, 
  * 32gb onboard memory vs 2gb, 
  * 2gb of ram vs a petty 128mb . 
  * 5-10 hours of estimated gameplay vs 3ds ' estimated 3-5 hours, 
  if you do n't care about *** all *** that , then yes , it is overpriced . 
  what 's this ? 
  * facebook for ants ? 
  en la plazita de lerdo,

  google it . 
  / r/seventhworldproblems, 
  well ... they almost all look the same . 
  otg cable + wireless adapter + stuff . 
  i could n't care less about nail polish . 
  however if you put some extra long fake nails i 'm going to notice it ... and not in the good way . 
  happy nacho, 
  the way i did it was :, 
  * install fb app, 
  * see it is a shitty app, 
  * uninstall, 
  not a single shitty app allowed in my phone . 
  why do you classify the word `` scumbag '' automatically as a meme ? 
  first reddit cringe video that sent shivers down my spine ... 6 times . 
  should put '' [ x-post ] from / r/mensrights '' in the title, 
  lpt : do n't trim your cat nails . 
  edit : typo, 
  superduper util :, 
   google bikes everywhere on campus . 
  apparently somehow those bikes ( which are supposed to be for the mountain view campus only ) ended up all the way across the word like in australia .

  like what ? 
  sooo ... like microsoft in the 90s ?

  it is n't worth it if you are just gon na download a cheap car .
