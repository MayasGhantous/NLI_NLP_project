  i do n't mean `` final '' in the way that they stop developing but like they say `` this is ready for worldwide adoption '' . 
  they can continue on 1.1 , 1.2.3 etc. . 
  those chocolate pancakes were a bomb in my stomach . 
  never again . 
  epic comment is epic . 
  so you had poker face or are you fucking kidding me face ? 
  upvote everything !, 
  here !, 
  have a keyboard upvote . 
  pics would be appreciated . 
  you deserve a lot more upvotes , sadly i just have one to give to you mister . 
  this is actually pretty great , i would stay in the beta channel . 
  though i do n't know how this would affect the rom releases and such . 
  +1 for apex . 
  i remember there was some universe-god theory that went something like this :, 
  dead person meets god and ask questions and one was like `` who are you ? '', 
  and he said, 
  - i 'm you . 
  - yes , actually i am everyone . 
  - i 'm a god ? 
  - not yet , you will be one day . 
  - how ? 
  explain . 
  - you see , you are everyone and god but first you need to reincarnate everytime you die and see all the possible perspectives . 
  so when you finally have lived all the possible lives you 'll become a god . 
  anyone knows this ? 
  i 'm kind of curious of how it was . 
  i read it some time ago . 
  beat me to it !, 
  * nice * . 
  it was only humans . 
  you can read it completely in the edit . 
  i agree with this . 
  i dont believe in god or life after death but i still found it to be a mindfucking story . 
  thanks , someday it will be useful . 
  * someday ... *, 
  until then , cheers !, 
  mmmmyes , i laughed quite sir, 
  yes , it 's overhyped . 
  i see it as sharp as my ex retina-ipod ( sold it to buy the gn ) . 
  when you compare it to other phones ( or retina vs non-retina ) the definition is really noticeable . 
  i 'm never living back again with a semi-standard resolution phone ( 'cause 720p is now becoming the standard ) . 
  i give it a 1 .

  * i knew it !, 
  which music/app widget is that in the homescreen ? 
  1 ) gsm operators : telcel and movistar cdma : iusacell, 
  2 ) there is no month to month , you can use prepaid or 1 , 1.5 , or 2 year contracts, 
  3 ) the most basic plans begin about 15 usd per month , the good ones go between 40 and 70 usd per month if you wan na get voice , messages and data plan . 
  i suggest getting telcel , it is the pricest of all ( by little ) but has the best coverage and almost no network problems . 
  amigo would be * prepaid * not postpaid . 
  if you look at the second image with and inverted perspective ( face is gradient background ) it seems like a black napolitan penis . 
  do n't worry , kyle 's just got a little sand in his vagina . 
  * why not zoidberg ?? 
  * upvote for reddit reference . 
  you need something like onlive . 
  another day , another website reddit crashes due to the massive traffic . 
  if they were something like deus ex upgrades hell yeah !, 
  but without internet or any kind of connectivy * a la * google glass . 
  privacy man , you got ta respect it . 
  that plus listening oasis ' stop crying your heart out made me sad . 
  my ... childhood flashback with that image . 
  doesnt matter ; juice and cookies . 
  maybe it would help if he changed his name to cave johnson .

  i do n't know why i instantly thought about hayley williams ( maybe cuz i recently have a small crush on her ? ), 
  anyways you should make a video about how to do * dat dyes * . 
  breakfast : he is doing it right . 
  1 - it 's ocz . 
  2 - why are they still in the market ? 
  because people that want cheap ssds buy them , * that 's why * . 
  3 - the reliable ones are : intel , crucial , samsung, 
  the gtx 560 ti 448 cores is a very good one . 
  saw that in [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/guezcxbcm78 ) ( 3:39 , 4:49 ) commercial for the gopro hero2 . 
  it is very inspiring .
