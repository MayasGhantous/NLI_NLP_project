  it 's awesome much better than [ this ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.lindanrandy.cidrcalculator&amp;hl=en ) as m0vi said , can you make it with ipv6 as a future release ? 
  and also add binary . 
  they released an updated moto g with lte ( useless in this case ) and microsd slot . 
  i think it 's like $ 220, 
  i would suggest :, 
  cpu : 2, 
  ssd : 2, 
  i started shaving almost daily when i discovered / r/wicked _ edge before i would let my milimetric beard for weeks . 
  after 3 months i can grow in 1 week what i had in 1 month .

  slight processor upgrade planned for around holiday shopping time . 
  imo buy it right now . 
  what the fuck ? 
  i 'm now in it that pays for engineering school . 
  i ca n't wait to finish school and quit this damn job . 
  yeah the comments are definitively better . 
  @ dawkings, 
  how does it feel to have such a deep impact with atheist worlwide ? 
  spam, 
  it 's only 3 selfies of you . 
  how is that related to g + ? 
  * heck * how is that even something remotely interesting ? 
  lower level languages are more closely related to machine code , ie , can operate faster due to being * native * . 
  higher level codes are interpreted , which need an interpreter and they are slower as they are run as they go line by line . 
  `` no se\u00f1orita yo me referia a - '' *, 
  * '' juaaaan !, 
  * facepalm *, 
  to each his own , i rather program than mess with circuits . 
  feedly, 
  thanks for reminding me :(, 
  i really like the desktop website . 
  however i do n't like the mobile app , the design mostly . 
  this is fixed using press and feedly service to get the feeds, 
  yeah , i deleted everything except one game ... on my phone ... ingress, 
  it really takes you out and know your city and have made a lot of ( real-life ) friends thanks to it . 
  check it out / r/ingress, 
  yeah , like i mentioned in another comment here , i do n't like mobile app either , too flipboard-like , i solved it by using another app ( press - android ) that uses feedly only as a backend . 
  i think for ios you need to check out reeder , excellent app and supports feedly . 
  similar but not the same . 
  i think that the z3 will totally be on par with the m8 as the best android phone . 
  estaria chido para / r/writingprompts, 
  anyways 10/10 te diria que la unica que te gana es emilia clarke .

  fue su segunda cancion popular despues de umbrella . 
   i reallly want my old url please google ????? 
  this is n't google , this is reddit . 
  second , why you just do n't deleted gmail from the old google account and made a new one with all the other google stuff intact ? 
  i think in some places that 's illegal . 
  i do n't think an audio-only recording would be a problem . 
  holy fuck !, 
  i 'm currently on your past state , 19 and skinny as hell , i just started lifting but now the problem is eating correctly  . , 
  try using linux and do n't install graphic drivers . 
  that 's a way to ensure you will not install again . 
  also you can make more extreme decisions , like completely deleting your steam profile . 
  no problem there then . 
  if any crazy screams rape after , you have the video that she was more than willing . 
  i hope i can replace foursquare with google maps . 
  at this point , who cares anyway ? 
  would you say this will kickass running emulators ? 
  counter-terrorists win, 
  not anymore .
