  natural o operada ? 
  otras empresas tecnologicas son wizeline , ooyala , oracle , dell .

  depends on where you go . 
  if you go to the capital , mexico city , looks like [ this ] ( http://www.mexico-missionaries.com/p7ssm_img_1/fullsize/07-elcieloazul_fs.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.paginaciudadana.com/wp-content/uploads/santa-fe.jpg ) . 
  but if you go where cartels are , ie : michoacan or sonora . 
  well ... things go ugly there . 
  if you stick so the big metropolitan cities , nothing is going to happen to you . 
  well . 
  i 'm from guadalajara , and here we love tacos and tequila so ... yeah . 
  gdl is becoming a bigger expat city than mexico city or mty .

  i think bald is better than it makes you look younger imo, 
  the 64gb is the only reason i 'm getting the nexus 6 . 
  i was pretty set to get a note 4 cuz never a nexus had more than 32gb but this was the selling point . 
  it 's still running `` phone '' android . 
  unless you change the build.prop, 
  yes , i need 64gb internal non-expandable or 16/32 with microsd support . 
  damn !, 
  i thought that me drinking 1l daily when i was in high school was a lot . . 
  estas intentado copiar a / u / _ vargas _ ? 
  you need to check if the apartments have any sort of cable/hsi agreement , if they do , you go on the business line . 
  if not , directly to residential services . 
  yes , i do n't drink near that much anymore . 
  the most i drink are 2 glasses or a rare day . 
  now i ca n't stand its sugar level and drink lots of water . 
  well , then call directly to their sales line and ask them to look up your address to see if it belongs to a bulk account ( apts service ), 
  it 's / u/smellbeforerain, 
  great !, 
  i think it 's a great idea , even though i have currently adblock , a paid subscription is a great option to have . 
  mainly because i 'll be supporting the content producers too .

  when i try to take it for my channel it says unavailable , but the website says `` 404 not found '',

  this is like one of the `` one thing i need to do before i die '' . 
  however , i think it 's a little different from elliot rogers , since his problem was with women and this dude was in depression , but nonetheless i could have helped him not to kill 6 people . 
  if you ever plan to come to mexico i or / u/rojoescarlata can give some tips . 
  then i imagine you like the z06 c7 . 
  i actually switched from freya to ugnome . 
  i think i 'll stay with it until freya final comes out .

  for those activies you need to go to the nearby towns .
