  i know a lot of exchange students from germany , france , switzerland , etc. 
  they all love it . 
  care to explain more ? 
  seems very vague . 
   as much as i love my mexican brothers and sisters they tend to be extremely nationalistic . 
  not everyone . 
  just like in usa there 're rednecks who shout '' ` murica '' to everything . 
  it depends on the location and the type of people .

  if the tests show that the m9 's camera is garbage , i 'm probably gon na get the s6 . 
  and rom it later . 
  if google at io releases a s6 gpe , the world is gon na burn . 
  it 's flash that does this . 
  seems to be a lesser problem when using html5 .

  these are the principal cultural states .
