  i have family in tj , and it 's like any normal city , just do n't go into bad neighborhoods and you will be alright . 
  pacific beaches are awesome , well , i have only been to those . 
  one year after and still it was not a penal . 
  kinda like [ this ] ( http://www.brighthand.com/assets/29692.jpg ) since apple jsut bought beats music and it will be a reskin mostly . 
  well , i do n't have a ` stache but my beard is awesome and i am too drunk to know where i left my sombrero ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   flagfox, 
  that one i did n't know about it !, 
  but yeah , for me it always seemed that startpage ( ixquick ) was better for privacy than ddg . 
  holy fuck !, 
  awesome !, 
  god , i love being a programmer . 
  you ca n't make something compile because of * feelz * , you have to work on it until you make it right . 
  i would guess so , but you would need to use a launcher like nova . 
  on nova , you can choose which icon use per app-basis . 
  and from the video i saw , it 's not just only the icons . 
  it 's also the quick settings bar and the settings app . 
  i would prefer to have a * powerful * operating system vs having a powerful app . 
  i had never heard of slickdeals . 
  checking it out right now because you sound like an awesome ceo . 
  well over 200k now . 
  hide pls, 
  que interesante !, 
  chiste local . 
  quien me hace el favor de eli5 para estar out of the loop ? 
  i do . 
  well . 
  i study computer engineering is not a big issue . 
  but for let 's say an ee . 
  which i think many programs are not available . 
  ( but you can always bootcamp or vm ) . 
  anyways , it 's the best laptop i 've ever had . 
  well , just today office 2016 was release for mac and is a universe and more better than the 2008 version . 
  i think what / u/discobrisco means is that * internal * storage on the mac could get expensive , so it 's better off just use an * external * drive for his documents . 
  they still make the optical drive macbook . 
  however is the 13 in model and the specs have not been updated since 2012 . 
  so , not worth it . 
  better just to buy one of the recent models and use a vm or bootcamp . 
   when you need something that only runs on windows and then you 're fucked . 
  since virtual machines and bootcamp do n't exist right ? 
  yes , i have been using the beta preview since it was released . 
  today the final version was released to everyone . 
  in an old one i understand that . 
  one option to make it run faster would be with an ssd , but a laptop that old is simply not worth it . 
  that is the main issue i have right now . 
  i * love * onenote , but it only exists within the ms cloud . 
  not even a decent browser extension to clip . 
  ( they have a javascript clipper ) . 
  so even thought evernote is not as good , i feel safer and it has a much more ecosystem overrall . 
  ( ifttt , todoist , alternative clients ) . 
  all hail general ruko . 
  thanks !, 
  very much appreciated . 
  right now what i have been doing is using a ftp server on the phone and connect to it on mac . 
  ( basically # 1 ) still better than mtp . 
  and i can not do # 3 since i 'm on osx elcap dp3 and osxfuse is not compatible yet :(, 
  i like the flavor of it . 
  but it 's too damn expensive for what it is . 
  and since i can use one bottle in 3-4 days , the price adds up quickly . 
  i know that / u/penguinofboom is the master at this . 
  some pipol just want to watch the world burn . 
  / r/conspiracy, 
  solid explorer fanteam here !, 
  it 's simply awesome . 
  as of right now , windows only :(, 
  just signed up to be notified of mac release . 
  well , not really . 
  it just modifies the hosts file on your computer , which you can edit relatively easy . 
  it blocks the connection to the internet for certain sites , but no apps themselves . 
  what if i get lost playing skyrim ? 
  thanks for contributing for what op asked !, 
  great !, 
  can you do the photo on the circle on # 1 as the outside and the circle from # 2 and # 3 on the inside ? 
  you have to keep up with the users ' stupidity . 
  if you want some examples , head over to / r/talesfromtechsupport, 
  yep , just did exactly that last week . 
  $ 35 for copying my documents folder to the 1tb hdd my aunt she bought herself . 
  easiest money ever . 
  i still felt like * really ? 
  she then asked me a couple days later to set up her outlook and iphone with her new work email server . 
  which i did for free . 
  i think we are even now . 
   i was putting antivirus on my neighbors phone, 
  13 y/o confirmed . 
  which they reply `` i already did that ! '', 
  and they turn off the monitor . 
  over there -  / r/mexicocirclejerk,

  ] ( http://images.coplusk.net/project_images/112653/image/full_100_0652_1324768448.jpg ) o una tableta * con sistema operativo android * ? 
  o te refieres a la google play store ? 
  please have a 3000mah + battery with 64gb + and you 're mine .
