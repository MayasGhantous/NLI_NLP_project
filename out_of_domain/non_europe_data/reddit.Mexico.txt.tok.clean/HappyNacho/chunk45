  if it 's profit then any profit is good . 
  revenue on the other hand ... 
  regresate a facebook maricanuebo . 
  fml !, 
  they were just 2 incidents of violent days . 
  not complete waves of violence increase . 
  guadalajara is what you 're looking for . 
  source : i 'm live here . 
  yo pense que vivias en washington . 
  which is almost the same . 
  una macbook retina 13 en ~ $ 14k . 
  revenue is all the money going to lg . 
  profit is what is left after you remove expenses ie marketing , manufacturing , salaries , research and development , etc. 
  so if you are getting profit it 's good because it more money than what you have spent . 
  damn !, 
  and just earlier this week i was gon na give them another go . 
  bad luck i guess . 
  but it 's until year end that the non compete clause will end . 
  so we are looking 1q of 2016 at best . 
  that 's 6 + months . 
  i 'm annoyed that it only has 32gb and nothing else . 
  yes !, 
  i 'm you want something pretty get a s6 . 
  i want that beast !, 
  no shit . 
  slowpoke trash . 
  too soon . 
  it did n't do so well because it was more limited production than the normal note and the edge was on one side only . 
  i wish the x style had the x play battery . 
  people still use flash ? 
  when we get good enough internet service that we can stream 1080p without even thinking about buffering . 
  i like russia . 
  no bs , straight to the point , no politically correct stuff . 
  just that sometimes it goes too far into banning stuff . 
  there 's no 100 % neutral news coverage in the world . 
  yay , downvotes de personas que no saben how to logic .

   / r/pcmasterrace, 
  mighty brother, 
  este antes visitaba / r/androidcirclejerk pero es casi una copia de / r/android oh wait . . 
  yeah the cpu is no that much of a difference but for god 's sake get the 512gb ssd . 
  remember it is not upgradeable . 
  mine is the super base one with 128gb and the struggle is real . 
  even with 256gb ( for me ) would be `` enough '' for now , but this machine is for the future also so ... 
  also 16gb ram is personal . 
  if you 're gon na keep it 2 + years i would go for 16 since ram is also not upgradeable . . 
  no soy tan fan . 
  lol, 
  / r/blackfathers es de mis subs joke favoritos . 
  a little late to start but happynacho will accept this challenge . 
  it will certainly help that last night i slept 3 fucking hours .

  wait for my update tomorrow and everyday to see result . 
  probably will also make an excel spreadsheet for this .

  #day # 1, 
  went to bed around 11pm but fell asleep until around 11:45 . 
  i should stop using my phone . 
  woke up around 8am with an alarm but snoozed it until 8:30 . 
  waked up . 
  drank a shake and went off the the gym . 
  i felt refreshed . 
  i would wait . 
  you are basically going 2 generations forward with skylake .

  vamos a ver que pendejada dice el gober aristoteles . 
  i just tried that 2 days ago !, 
  i was thinking that by using my left hand i would n't brush too hard . 
  also i would like to learn how to write with the left so ... 
  use flashblock : https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/flashblock/, 
  it does n't just blocks flash , also html5 video . 
  you can whitelist sites like youtube and others . 
  this will activate that you need to `` click to activate '' any kind of player not on the whitelist . 
  are we supposed to guess what do you use or what ? 
  who is he ? 
  i use new tab tools : https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/new-tab-tools/, 
  works wonderfully . 
  huh ... 
  i never had that issue . 
  ( maybe because i do n't go to cnn ? ... ), 
  remember , shaken , not stirred . 
  i will say just what i said before . 
  they will *** anything *** just to get free press . 
  joaquin verges !, 
  that guy is fucking awesome . 
  i remember watching a talk he gave about falcon pro 3 in just about 2 weeks or something like that . 
  imo the official twitter app should be fully material but still have the flexibility for power user features like fenix/falcon/tweetdeck does . 
  what i mean by that is having lists/hashtags as columns, 
  at this point i do n't care anymore . 
  i just stopped believing that google would fix it . 
  el tequilero ( not pictured ), 
  go back to 4chan .
