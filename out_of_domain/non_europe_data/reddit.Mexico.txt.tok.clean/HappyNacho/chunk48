  ahi conoci a un manager de google mexico para que veas . 
  para amazon era customer care y en hp soy sysadmin . 
  wow !, 
  that indian accent ... 
  you could buy one from mx and it would be ~ $ 350 . 
  unlocked for any carrier also . 
  you were mirin ', 
  per 250ml please . 
  i ca n't fucking believe they pulled the `` womyn make .80 c to a man 's dollah '' card . 
  credibility has been thrown out of the window . 
  not directly on nyt . 
  i read the article . 
  then i went to feelthebern.org and that 's one of the points on there . 
  shut up party popper . 
  i love those kind of changelogs . 
  `` it 's way better than just `` bug fixes and performance improvements '' that most apps have for the past 5 updates . 
  * google now, 
  fuck you google , * i still like you guise *, 
  * isc ( todavia ), 
  todo lo extracurricular lo escoges tu . 
  * pues trabajo como entry-level sysadmin y operations control para hp y pues la consegui por medio de una conexion . 
  amazon . 
  no questions asked policies . 
  apparently in cancun people do n't have access to google ... 
  i have 5.1 on it . 
  it 's mostly smooth but with the occasional hiccup . 
  battery life has really been degraded , barely better than my galaxy nexus i had a while ago . 
  i bought this phone used for ~ $ 90 because my moto g died :(, 
  since i have 10,000 mah powerbank ( i like to play ingress ) , battery is not an issue for me mostly . 
  our people . 
  there 's even a common saying that goes `` the worst part of mexico is that it 's filled with mexicans '' . 
  i 'm not really a * malinchista * ( someone who likes more foreign everything ) , but i do n't want to put an elaborate answer right now . 
  1 - apple online store, 
  we also have amazon.com.mx , or if you want directly to buy in in person , in bb like i said , or any of the stores here : https://locate.apple.com/mx/es/sales/?pt=4&amp;lat=21.1742876&amp;lon=-86.846559, 
  the point is that even i do n't know what the fuck happened to it . 
  it was charging on my desk while i was using my computer right next to it , it was already 100 % full and after a few minutes , i got a notification , and then the phone randomly shut off and refused to turn on . 
  i tried searching online and found a common problem of several gs that would n't turn on , but that was when the battery was emptied completely , i had it also happen to me twice , had to put it to charge and hold power for 15min ! , but this time it was at 100 % and tried everything but it refused to simply turn on again . 
  wonderwall !, 
  yeah , just keep in mind not all of the songs will be available . 
  might be missing a couple . 
  i first started with spotify registering under uk , then to us and finally mexico . 
  yeah , also i had for 1 year 3 months so i was out of warranty already . 
  i took it to a local shop and they tried replacing the usb port and battery ribbon and still did n't budge . 
  that year the thing was a tank !, 
  i never put a case or a protector on my phones . 
  they mirin !, 
  root uninstaller . 
  uninstall everything google by force . 
  well , it would certainly break a couple of things if you remove it along with play services . 
  but it 's still google . 
  nope . 
  even google says it here : https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95656?hl=en, 
  `` if you do n't want bookmark autocomplete , delete your bookmarks '' . 
  * really useful google !, 
  use ublock . 
  same features , less ram used . 
  you can download ublock origin directly from dev 's github . 
  for a vpn , try installing one directly on the pc . 
  if you are not allowed to do that , like you said , you could use a portable chrome . 
  if it 's blocked on your school , then yes . 
  what you can do is use the portable chrome on your home to download the extensions , move it to a usb , then use it in school . 
  it works , but since i 'm studying cs , i need my computer . 
  but yeah , making progress at home is hard . 
  main one : have the internet browser closed . 
  if you must research/upload homework or anything . 
  use an app that blocks distracting websites . 
  ie , coldturkey ( windows ) focus ( mac ) leechblock ( firefox ), 
  who still uses adblock plus ? 
  all the cool guys use ublock now ... 
  respect !, 
  beer box . 
  red pub . 
  here 's it . 
  nova launcher , xperia clock and dashclock widgets . 
  most used apps are on the side screen , everything else on the drawer . 
  i can help you . 
  gdl , stuyding engineering , working for tech . 
  send me a pm !, 
  interesante pero puramente anecdotal . 
  time for a book exchange !, 
  que internacional . 
  from galaxy nexus to moto g to moto x. 
  actually they 're pretty similiar . 
  shitty camera , mediocre battery ( except for the g , which is now dead ) . 
  have to fiddle around to get the updates . 
  i 'm looking forward to the note 4 for self christmas present . 
  ya ves aliens ? 
  also , ya tomaste coca cola ? 
  oye , si ya estas tan determinado para un paro cardiaco , no tendras viagra por ahi ? 
  pidele unas a / u/penguinofboom, 
  surely op will deliver ... 
  *** you had one job ***, 
  / u/alex-mayorga, 
  press, 
  * amazon.com.mx, 
  * especifica mas . 
  i really want something simple . 
  my perfect smartwatch would be something that alerts me notifications , has an alarm , a vibration motor , an led and good battery life . 
  that 's all i want . 
  i 'm they make one that looks like a moto 360 i 'm all in .
