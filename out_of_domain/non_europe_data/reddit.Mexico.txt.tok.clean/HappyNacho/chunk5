  ( he had a small fight with his girlfriend , no big deal ) and then friend 2 replies with `` because you dont have god in your life '' . 
  i was so fuckin annoyed that i replied `` i dont believe in god and my life is excellent '' . 
  he didnt replied to me but followed with a series of hate tweets like `` things i hate : atheists , atheists , atheists . '', 
  `` if you are atheist i hate you '' . 
  he didnt spoke to me since but his bigotry made me despise him .
