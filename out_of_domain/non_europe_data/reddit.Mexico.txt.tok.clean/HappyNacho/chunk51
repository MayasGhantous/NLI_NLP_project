  i just finished the video . 
  it 's very long but actually covers a lot of points .

   the devs have one less thing to maintain and power users can install the addon which it arguably should have been originally . 
  if they could only do that with hello and pocket ...

  meanwhile , mozilla strips features from firefox and drives people to chrome . 
  exactly . 
  you become a tool to the modern smartphone and not the other way around . 
  what i did is , while i do have a moto x , i turn off almost all notifications . 
  the only one i have are calendar , phone , and any to-do reminders . 
  that way , i do n't become stressed about social media demanding my attention at every minute . 
  ( i do n't even have fb installed ), 
  since they are migrating to servo ( layout engine ) a lot of things will have to be deprecated . 
  1 - addons have to be partially rewritten ( they say they will make an api for compatibility ) or completely rewritten ( if they interact with more complex browser features ), 
  2 - dropping complete themes , tab groups , panorama and possibly ftp . 
  3 - adding unnecessary bloat ( pocket integration and hello ), 
  4 - limiting user choice regarding addons . 
  they implemented that addons require signing to be able to work in ff . 
  meaning no custom or outdated addons allowed . 
  ( except in unstable nightly editions ) . 
  [ mfw  ] ( https://media1.giphy.com/media/fwpecpdvcu7vo/200_s.gif ), 
  a lot of people do n't have free music streaming . 
  try solid explorer . 
  very solid and it 's awesome . 
  also i have been using it since the original beta !, 
  it has come a long way . 
  they must save themselves . 
  it 's over 9000 !, 
  still , if they are the `` freedom '' browser , they should give us the option to remove it , which they do n't . 
  mi onda es como los remixes de canciones de rock .
