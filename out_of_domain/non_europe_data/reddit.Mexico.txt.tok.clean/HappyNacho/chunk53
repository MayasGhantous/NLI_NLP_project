  formatting , do you know it ? 
  go to itesm . 
  they have english classes available ( not all of them ), 
  retina definitely worth it . 
  2011 vs 2015 is a huge leap in performance . 
  i bought a late 2014 rmbp 13 . 
  i also code in it . 
  wonderful screen . 
  i would suggest to go for more disk space vs more cpu . 
  know that feel .

  too soon . 
  the author is an imbecile . 
  memory leak still not fixed for osx ? 
  borre cookies , use un vpn , cambie de useragent y seguia igual . 
  1 - deactivate caps lock, 
  it 's that what vulkan is trying to do ? 
  minimize the driver 's overhead to get better performance , also it is cross-platform . 
  same here . 
  with gor i paid for apps that i had been pirating for years . 
  ( i also bought apps before but not that frequently ) .

  i tip my nacho to you frutsi . 
  puro paisa o que !, 
  url autocomplete . 
  wish they had an option to disable it , a la firefox . 
  not being able to move extensions . 
  lastly , higher cpu usage viewing youtube compared to chrome . 
  ( i dunno why, 
  posted one ** hour ** ago :, 
  we have tacos, 
  this guy ... 
  i just discovered this thread ... 
  i love it !, 
  not too dark , not too white ... just perfect . 
  damn . 
  i did n't know that chrome store had a fee . 
  could i make a small request ? 
  on the background tabs , the text instead of being light grey could it be white . 
  it would increase the contrast and readability just a bit . 
  probably a very niche section . 
  if they ca n't replace you easily then you have the leverage . 
  i find that hilarious . 
  even in a female-dominated occupation , a man can out-excel most of the women if desired . 
  this is mainly economic issues , but do n't get me started on the work environment if stem actually got filled up with women . 
  like they say , you ca n't `` feelz '' your way out of code , either it does or it does n't . 
  a likely `` solution '' that would be adopted would be to lower standards , which absolutely can not go into what stem is about . 
  also , if anyone decided to evaluate the department as a group , i 'm sure the guys that actually did the work would riot . 
  they say we need to be more `` inclusive '' in stem . 
  shit , i would say stem is the most inclusive sector , we do n't care about your race or gender , if you can do it right , you 're welcomed . 
  2014 rmbp , crashing also on tough break . 
  from their ** faq **, 
   q : what if i 'm more paranoid than your regular user ? 
   we 've got you covered . 
  telegram 's special secret chats use end-to-end encryption , leave no trace on our servers , support self-destructing messages and do n't allow forwarding . 
  on top of this , secret chats are not part of the telegram cloud and can only be accessed on their devices of origin . 
  i would say it 's a solid 5/7, 
  mr gogue , tenga en u2 like,

  can confirm . 
  mobile is ok but the web redesign made me stop using it all-together, 
  why not both ? 
  asus pg279q , 144hz ips panel , 1440p . 
  if you have the money tho . 
  more focused in collections than circles . 
  if you click anywhere in the top search bar , instead of giving you instant searches like before ( or fb ) , takes you to the `` search `` page where even if you press esc or click out of the search bar , you do n't go back to home . 
  events are also harder to reach . 
  guise pls,
