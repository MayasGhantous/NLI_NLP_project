   as much as we like android , we have to agree that android gets slow from time to time . 
  translation : i want everyone to think like me, 
   this is the major complaint i get from common people ... but they also tend to download lot of apps and then they forget that they ever installed them . 
  they also install stupid shit like `` cleanmaster '' `` droid optimizer '' `` virusfree analyzer '' . 
   feature requested : disable multitasking by default, 
  do you think we are google ? 
   do n't let apps to run services in the background . 
  so basically , kill streaming services , tools like pushbullet tasker , automatic backup among others ? 
   it should be enabled by default , bcz the common user is not gon na search and find this option, 
  so you want an os that is dumbed down and impossible to fuck up ? 
  ios is your answer .
