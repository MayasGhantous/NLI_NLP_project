  someone lost their caps key .

  i want to get a call from android too !, 
  i used an iphone 4s for a month when i broke my moto x. 
  sure it had the latest ios version , 9.3 but it was so fucking crippled , going around the ui and even the stock music player lagged as fuck . 
  multitasking was basically non existent . 
  the worse part is that you could not downgrade it to a lower smoother os because apple does n't allow it . 
  so while they may support them , it runs slow af . 
  eventually new vulnerabilities would be found that would be fixed in ios 10 . 
  so i would still be . 
  so being vulnerable with an unusable device vs a good one it seems pretty obvious . 
  basicamente `` have you tried turning your computer off and on again ? '',
