  truenale sus huesitos . 
  segundamano.com.mx if you want to buy used phones . 
  department stores for new phones . 
  i would recommend a moto e or a moto g if you do n't want to spend a lot . 
  our craigslist is segundamano.com.mx, 
  you can also search for `` professional '' used phones shops , they usually have less issues than buying from a single person .

  we have whatsapp for the newb players < 8 . 
  then we add them to the general chat  8 in telegram . 
  we also use telegram for geo regions within the city ( north , east , west , south ) . 
  we also have one that is for the players that really do play a lot in , needed when a field in another city needs to be taken down . 
  also the party/alcohol chat . 
  those are the main ones and we have temporary event ones . 
  even though i still speak with my teammates from obsidian anomaly .

  also , learn to format reddit posts correctly . 
  hold down the `` hack button '' for ~ 3 seconds . 
  an animation will play with some figures , then it will give you ~ 15 seconds to replay the figures yourself . 
  if successful , you will earn ~ 20 % - ~ 120 % extra items . 
  more info here : https://fevgames.net/ingress/ingress-guide/actions/glyph-hack/, 
  it definitely has some useful features but everything else i ignore it . 
  i do n't feel my s6 is crap with touchwiz . 
  the only downside would be that you have to know how to do it . 
  an average user wo n't do it . 
  ie * technical knowledge *, 
  damn , i 'm expecting to hit 16 by the next anniversary . 
  another messaging app !,

  toma tu like, 
  that is something called `` decision avoidance '' which is within [ decision fatigue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/decision_fatigue ), 
  just try to always pick one that is `` good enough '' not necessarily the best . 
  this way you 'll save time and actually pick something . 
  relevancia a m\u00e9xico ?

  new york,

  / r/pickanandroidforme,

  so edgy, 
  of course not , this is / r/mexico not / u/unitedstates, 
  name calling like, 
   indeed , it is a horror that even that many people are so filled with ignorance , anti-intellectualism , and hate that they would vote for this person , but it is still such a small minority . 
  is * exactly * why trump won . 
  like / u/trolol12345 said in another comment :, 
   your weird electoral college system ( which supposedly is designed to prevent a popular demagogue get to power , but when it 's not the * right * demagogue then it 's decried by the loser as flawed , skewed & biased ) gave him the win based on its ' rules . 
  even then , if the media was n't so biased and the left stopped the name calling since 2012 election . 
  trump would n't have gained momentum , which led to being elected by the people you 're name calling just because their opinion differs from yours . 
  it 's amusing to see the cognitive dissonance in effect . 
  let me grab my ~ ~ vodka ~ ~ tequila . 
  que original ... 
  so edgy, 
  well ... what phone do you have ? 
  pls no ... 
  it would be better for them just to admit they are dead already . 
  a ese precio si son worth it . 
  ya a la verga no ? 
  a ver cuanto es de the_donald ? 
  telegram and whatsapp . 
  ahhh, 
  1 - not all of them , not even most . 
  2 - in some parts yes , like nevado de colima, 
  3 - very tall . 
  6 - dick in , dick out . 
  repeat ... 
  8 - depends on the city, 
  9 - it 's not a huge issue like it was several years ago ( 2009-2012 ) however , it 's not like you are walking down the street and you get beheaded . 
  most of the violence was between different cartels . 
  think gang wars . 
  11 - tortilla tacos yes , the shit from taco bell is not . 
  i would suggest some * enchiladas *, 
  sick burn bro, 
  no se permite el self-promotion ?!, 
  reposted shitpost, 
  same here . 
  took 5mg ( long-release ) last night at 11pm .
