  for me , * if i ever go back to android as daily driver * , would be pixel or samsung . 
  right now the pixel is not convincing me and it 's not officially sold on my country . 
  i still blame it on gonza, 
  whatsapp and telegram . 
  mostly telegram , due to that i jumped to ios and lost 0 chats and also that i can use it natively on my laptop . 
  i thought the same thing .

  - sony ericson w300, 
  - galaxy nexus, 
  - blackberry curve, 
  - iphone 4s, 
  - htc m8, 
  - iphone 6s + / moto g2, 
  i am slowly heading there . 
  that looks sick, 
  sold it . 
  battery was a beast but like all moto phones , camera was meh . 
  i also did n't like that the fingerprint reader was just that , it did n't function like a home button and them bezels . 
  upvote for op . 
  not really . 
  mostly personal use . 
  keep in mind that list is in the span of around 5 years . 
  so i change roughly every 6 months and most are second hand phones . 
  now i 'm in the lookout for either a pixel 2 or iphone 8 . 
  yup , that 's our record from friday 's farming .

  death to the phablet ( which i guess is any android phone ) !,

  thank you very much for this extension !, 
  the likes along with the `` you may have missed '' is what let me to uninstall the twitter app on my phone . 
  wish they would stop shoving it down our throats . 
  sepa, 
  5.5 with minimal bezels would be the sweet spot for me . 
  running a 6s + with super bezels is barely manageable . 
  same with the z play i had before .
