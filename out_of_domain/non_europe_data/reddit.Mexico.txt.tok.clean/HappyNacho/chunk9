  still people manage to get it * wrong *, 
  if a friend of mine said this i would slap the stupidity out of him . 
  * high five *, 
  you are again that lava reposter, 
  the only ` real ' upgrade is the processor , else are just improvements . 
  give me a htc one x + nexus ( with s4 pro ) and i 'll call that an upgrade . 
  the play store gsm nexus is 16gb . 
  i think of it like an improvement is a * minor * upgrade . 
  going from a 1.2 ghz to a 1.5 ghz dual-core . 
  an upgrade like a * mayor * one , from 1.2 ghz dual core to a 1.7 ghz quad-core . 
  right in the feels . 
  yes, 
  will it kill you to google `` android media player '' ? 
  also the galaxy nexus is $ 350 16gb vs ipod $ 300 32gb . 
  if you dont want to spend extra $ 50 , it is impossible you get the smooth stock android experience near that price . 
  * geez * sometimes i wonder if these people are just trolls or what ... 
  good thing we have roms and internet . 
  i dare you to not laugh . 
  yes . 
  some while ago i read here that a guy bought a gn from ebay with a blocked imei ( or something similar ) that prevented it from making calls but the rest of the phone was perfectly funtional . 
  he used it as a media player and with the blocked thing it was ~ $ 100 cheaper . 
  ( this was when the gn was like $ 500 ), 
  `` i 'll pay you double for doing nothing and failing at your job . '', 
  `` so ... you are gon na pay me to be on reddit all day ? 
  deal . '', 
  the thing is i ca n't find the acronym it was from the blocked gn . 
  you need it to search blocked phones . 
  for that i think it 's worth breaking into the job for the chat logs . 
  falta de ortograf\u00eda , link pendejo y titulo simple . 
  and then blaming the drug problem to us . 
  mobile es en ingles dumbass . 
  do n't you say ... 
  winning . 
  i solve that by not using facebook at all . 
  would you fuck for money ? 
  like what ? 
  it is * inside * the belly ... 
   we did n't want to have a bunch of apple lawsuits in the way, 
  ftfy, 
  i 'm thinking he was digging his belly button for a while , it ` opened ' and pulled it out . 
  naco , ordinario , sin cultura .

  i always end upvoting . 
  / r/imgoingtohellforthis, 
  one way to have an incredible experience is root , install rom with jelly bean . 
  butter smooth, 
  you download the rom from internet , install it on a bios-y-like app ( clockword mod recovery ) at startup and boot up . 
  rom 'd . 
  fair to mention it erases your apps and system settings . 
  not user data . 
  ( music , pictures , videos , etc ), 
  came here to say almost that ... 
  yes , but they are synced with the google contacts on your google account so nothing is lost . 
  for more info on roms and modding check the sidebar , 
  great review btw, 
  you can brag all the way in / r/fitness, 
  you wo n't . 
  while the one x has lower pixel density ( 312 ppi vs 316 on iphone ) you have more pixels in the total resolution . 
  720p on the one x. 
  you wo n't .

  most people with an it university title should hold an advanced conversation . 
  te ganaron la noticia . 
  downvote :, 
  2-no diste credito, 
  was going to correct you before i saw the edit . 
  anyways htc build quality is above lg 's and camera-wise it 's the best in an android phone . 
  i take that over instant updates . 
  ( and since i use roms they tend to lag a bit on the new android software upgrades ), 
  all the internet knows how the lg nexus 4 is gon na be . 
  where am i being negative ? 
  i said the internet knows how it 's gon na be because of the several leaks . 
  specs , looks , camera tests , etc. 
  the only thing missing is the announcement . 
  one russian ( i think ? ), 
  has even reviewed the prototype . 
  yo tenia una de escritorio con 1gb de tam y un nucleo y corria bien windows 7 . 
  same as every othee phone . 
  high launch price ( ~ 600 ) which will come down eventually, 
  [ licencia ... ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc241unnks1rws6vno1_500.gif ), 
  the galaxy nexus was easily over $ 500 at launch price . 
  simply google `` galaxy nexus price history '' . 
  it was down to $ 400 when it launched on the play store but it was almost 6 months after being released . 
  supply and demand will always make a high-end phone launch price be over $ 450 . 
  ... cern ? 
  just about the right --   is the search bar ... a hint ... use it . 
  daaaam , if you are an mit student then the languages are no problem for you . . if you are an engineer . 
  because you have to be a very intelligent person to enter the engineering program at mit . 
  fuck this kind of threads . 
  seriously . 
  fuck them . 
  * 300ish or less *, 
  look for a used transformer or a xoom with a bluetooth keyboard .
