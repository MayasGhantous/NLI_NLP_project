  he loud and clear states he 's looking after her . 
  the way he opened up to her about his brother and was willing to fight for her even though his original intention for doing so ( ransom ) was completely out of the equation , tells you he genuinely cared about her . 
  arya cared too , as evidenced when she started playing the game of questions at the house of b&w . 
  that 's the motive . 
  they had a strong bond . 
  sandor simply was n't a warm and fuzzy person , so it was n't obvious . 
  and arya was too stubborn to admit she felt for him . 
  they were a great pair , i miss them together . 
  my thoughts ? 
  it could be cersei , or alliser thorne , or baby sam . 
  i mean , if we 're just going to throw random names out there without any sort of argument as to why it could be them , then it could literally be anyone . 
  with all due respect , this is n't how `` theorizing '' works , like , at all . 
  come on . 
  time to call it a quit , bigfoot . 
  anik had to hold the mic so high up , statue of liberty style . 
  attempted to learn swedish a couple of years ago and it actually was n't too difficult . 
  i dropped it but it was n't anything super crazy . 
  now , chinese on the other hand ... 
  ohhh icelandic i 've heard is pretty damn difficult , yes . 
  swedish has a relatively similar grammar structure to english , i felt . 
  norwegian and danish are similar to swedish , as far as i 'm concerned . 
  finnish looks like nothing i 've ever seen so i 'm thinking that language is difficult as well . 
  no idea what they speak in the faroe islands . 
  i think those are all the nordic countries ? 
  that i ca n't argue against , it 's true . 
  however , do n't get carried away by what happened right there and then . 
  i think there 's a little bit more to it that you 're not taking into consideration . 
  do n't forget arya is a child . 
  children have a tendency to be stubborn . 
  this is specially true for arya : she 's wilful . 
  she felt very strongly about how much she hated sandor because he killed her friend ( mycah , remember that 's why the hound made it to arya 's list ) , without acknowledging sandor had become her friend at that stage . 
  she refused to acknowledge this even when she was confronted with the truth . 
  `` i hated him , that 's not a lie ! '', 
  yes , she turned her back on him , because she was mad at him , because she did n't know how much he meant to her , or because she * refused * to admit she cared about him . 
  maybe subconsciously she walked away because she could n't bring herself to kill him . 
  it would have been the humane thing to do , but either she did n't want to do it ( out of spite ) or could n't do it ( out of ... fear ? 
  love ? 
  no idea ) . 
  just as predicted , they 'd tease the fuck out of us . 
  something to do with tyrion being dany and drogo 's offspring , i ca n't remember very well . 
  it was quite idiotic , really . 
  or hodor being a horse trapped in a man 's body * [ cringe ] * . 
  i do n't know how hard it is for non native spanish speakers to learn spanish , as it is my mother language . 
  i only speak two languages myself and a tiny bit of japanese ( like , extremely basic conversational stuff , really ) . 
  i know what you mean with that last part . 
  i have an acquaintance who once started speaking cantonese out of nowhere with a native canto . 
  that was so fucking radical . 
  i have n't read the books either but this is what i 've gathered from other people 's comments :, 
  ** r ** haegar targaryen + ** l ** yanna stark = ** j ** on snow . 
  allegedly , rhaegar `` kidnapped '' lyanna . 
  ned 's father and uncle ( i think ) went to the mad king ( rhaegar 's father ) to ask for lyanna back . 
  mad king burns them and shit hits the fan ( robert 's rebellion takes place ) . 
  rhaegar dies and then the whole tower of joy thing happens , where ned tries once again to get his sister back , only to find her nearly dead . 
  i do n't know if that answer suffices . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , anyone . 
  edit : rhaegar was daenerys ' oldest brother , lyanna was ned 's older sister . 
  i do n't know if that makes it a bit more clear . 
  spanish and english , those are my only two languages, 
  i do n't even know in the show . 
  based on the flashback , child lyanna looked older than child ned to me . 
  so , is she older or younger in the show ? 
  ohh sorry , that completely went over my head haha, 
  i find it kind of funny , i find it kind of sad that the dreams where i am dying are the best i 've ever had ... 
  as\u00ed de simple . 
  es horrible que pasen estas cosas : /, 
  i 've tried several others and this one is the one i 've liked the most . 
  ** this ** . 
  because i 'm almost positive i 've done that . 
  i could imagine it but it makes zero sense without context . 
  elaborate ? 
  whoa , he looks like a dick . 
  literally , like a veiny dick . 
  does n't he tell jon that a raven came to castle black to deliver the news that his entire family had perished ? 
  i really do n't think he was at the toj , at all . 
  people around here suggested over and over again that holly was dumb , her manager made stupid decisions , she lost millions fighting miesha , blah blah . 
  it 's an amazing card , regardless . 
  it would have been great to see him but his well-being is first and hopefully there 'll be more chances in the future to see him . 
  i can barely wait for this event . 
   rousey return timeline still unknown, 
  nothing about that tells me they 're right though . 
  aww i 'll miss his soothing voice :(, 
  that outfit makes my vagina really dry . 
  not that conor normally makes me moist but whatever the fuck he 's wearing makes him look like an absolute dork . 
   dodge piss tests and openly cheat, 
  no matter how many times others point out the opposite , apparently cyborg dodges testing and cheats even though she 's been tested at least 5 times under the same rules/parameters as every other fighter under the ufc banner ... mmkay ? 
  and she 's as dominant as ever . 
  she 'd be 16-1 if it was n't for that ped incident that continues to haunt her til this day ... 
  same here , because that actually looks like a child . 
  this new `` child '' looks more alien to me than child . 
   the hound would be decimated by ser r strong in minutes , if not seconds, 
  why are you so sure about that ? 
  he gave him a run for his money when he saved loras , and oberyn nearly killed him , so obviously it 's not like it 's impossible to take him out . 
  it 's not like sandor is a punching bag by any means , he 's a great warrior himself . 
  better than gregor ? 
  that i have no clue , but i do n't know if `` getting decimated in minutes '' is a fair depiction of sandor 's skills . 
  for the sake of my sanity , i 'd like to think the hound will be fine if he does return , for he is my favorite character . 
  bias aside , i do n't know how well he would square off against zombie mountain , so that 's why i 'm asking ** you ** why do ** you ** think he 'd be decimated . 
  edit : spelling . 
  i know , but iirc , season 4 child said something along the lines of `` the first men called us children of the forest but we 've been here longer than them '' ( i think ? 
  it 's been a long time since i last watched that scene ) .
