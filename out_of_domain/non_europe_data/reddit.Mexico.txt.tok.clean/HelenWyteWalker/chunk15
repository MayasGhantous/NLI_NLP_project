  i. . . just need ... to ... [ get some rest ] ( http://f1.thejournal.ie/media/2013/11/lie_down__try_not_to_cry__cry_a_lot_combo_by_badflippy-d5t596e-630x322.jpg ), 
   does n't stick the landing, 
  hahaha brienne 's face . 
  come on , bby . 
  y u so reluctant ? 
  but moooom \u2565 \u2565, 
  do not sass me , elsa, 
  your royal sassiness . 
   she could just be implying that `` karma '' happens to people who get in her way, 
  i think that 's exactly how sansa interpreted that statement . 
  or maybe she could n't make anything out of those words since she was about to get killed by a psycho and she was terrified . 
  after everything was said and done , i 'm sure sansa just wanted to put that incident behind her and move on . 
  of course it was a confession but that 's something you and i and everyone who watched know because we have the outsider 's perspective , but how was sansa supposed to know it was a confession ? 
  for all she knew psycho bitch could have been just talking out of her ass . 
  or then again , she could have been too busy being terrified and did n't even pay too much attention to what was being said to her . 
   i am a bot , and this action was performed automatically, 
  agreed , it looks `` cleaner '' and you can appreciate more details in his appearance . 
   currently, 
   since the death of tywin, 
  3 guys have played the mountain ? 
  i thought only 2 did : o, 
  i would laugh too . 
  i do n't know why that pec flexing thing ( does it have a name ? ), 
  cracks me the fuck up . 
  it 's stupidly amusing . 
  might mouse is awesome . 
  same . 
  before he took his shirt off i thought `` i do n't even care what 's under the shirt , he 's so fine looking '' . 
  yum . 
  either tears of sadness or joy , does n't matter . 
  tears would be shed regardless . 
   this guy is on steroids, 
  would still bang . 
  enjoy your meal , winged pupper . 
  a pupper with wings instead of paws . 
  haha !, 
  after the shirt , what sealed the deal for me was his back . 
  i 'm a sucker for wide backs \u2764, 
  ok , maybe not `` cringe '' level but it was still pretty awkward . 
  has he ever puked this much flattery all over any other fighter ? 
  i 'm honestly amazed by how many people bought into this `` she could beat half the male roster '' narrative . 
  yeah , she looked impressive ( relative to her competition , that is ) but people got seriously carried away by that . 
  comeback or not , i hope we never ever have to hear anything along the lines of `` i could beat cain velasquez under the right circumstances '' . 
  never again , please . 
   why am i being downvoted ? 
  usually whining about downvotes is a fast way to get even more downvotes . 
   completely unwarranted, 
  hmm well , with all due respect , you could have made your point without being a smartass . 
  see , it does n't bother * me * in the slightest but i can see how it could have come across as condescending . 
  then again , keep whining about downvotes and you 'll get downvoted even more . 
  if i were you , i 'd give it a rest . 
  if what hurts are your muscles , then yes , totally normal . 
  i personally felt sore for about 2 weeks until the excruciating pain started decreasing . 
  if what hurts are your elbows , knees ( joints , basically ) , then it might not be normal and you might want to slow down a bit , or a lot , depending on how bad it hurts . 
  then again , if it 's muscle soreness , just hang in there and keep going . 
  it 'll get better eventually . 
  really , the way to make it go away is to keep up the hard work . 
  good luck , love . 
  incredibly cute < 3, 
  goddamn , that looked fucking nasty . 
   millennials like her, 
  the lady was concerned about her *** 14 year old daughter *** and thus decided to make/take ( not entirely sure which ) a phone call but yeah , fuck that entitled ~ ~ millenial ~ ~ mother who just wanted to check on her child , amirite guise ? 
  edit : actually a text , not even a call . 
   the entire time, 
  it was a small span of time during the encore . 
  but since you feel so passionate about defending this guy who loses his shit over the most petty crap ( his own twitter is proof ) , then there 's no point in trying to reason with you , at all . 
  either that or you were actually there and know for a fact the lady was tweeting nonstop , which by the way is her right and her prerogative considering she paid for her ticket . 
  or did you ? 
  did that asshat who decided to put her on blast ? 
  her money , her choice . 
  which she wo n't be spending on him or anything related to him ever again , apparently . 
  point being ... ? 
  i absolutely love this app . 
  i 've used other apps and this one has been my favorite , by far . 
  i did n't think it needed anything to be better but somehow you managed to make it * even * better . 
  it 's loading everything faster and the small changes in design are so nice . 
  keep up the great job < 3, 
  can definitely unsee . 
  aside from the eyes , i do n't really see that much of a resemblance . 
  a lot , actually . 
  something tells me jared was just being facetious . 
  agreed but just to clarify , was n't joffrey the one who ordered the killing of the babies ? 
  i recall concluding that from one of cersei 's conversations with tyrion . 
  only my boyfriend , but that 's more than enough . 
  i enjoy our conversations about it now that he finally caught up . 
  how ? 
  i have n't re watched so i do n't now . 
  legit question : where do you people get the names and little summaries for each episode ? 
  it seems i 've been living under a rock ... 
  and cersei 's and daenerys ' and tyrion 's and pretty much everyone 's , it seemed . 
  now that was a mindfuck when i read it . 
  i 'm scared for penne right now ... 
  saved by the bell ... 
  man , penne is tough . 
  haha did n't notice before but oddly enough she actually does a bit ... 
  holy shit . 
  how long does it take to grow a beard like that ? 
  i honestly thought it was so endearing , like `` there there , child , it 's over now '' . 
   this ~ ~ might be ~ ~ definitely is an unpopular opinion, 
  ftfy,
