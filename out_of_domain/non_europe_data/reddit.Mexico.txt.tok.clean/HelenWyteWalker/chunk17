  the owners are youtubers themselves and used to do comedy skits so i 'm sure they 're totally cool with weird shit happening there . 
  this is actually kind of cool ... did you read it somewhere or did you come up with it ? 
  i really hate that one , and i do n't even know why , but i absolutely loathe it . 
  i really like meera by herself and i think i would hate it for her to become `` jon 's twin sister '' instead of her own person , does that make sense ? 
  yeah , i think that 's actually why . 
  that one was so wtf and hilarious at the same time though . 
  ohh it 's not as bad as i thought it would be . 
  i mean , it 's not good but it is n't hideous . 
  oh dear , that is awful . 
  stay strong < 3, 
  what 's wrong with lp ? 
  legit question . 
  what is hype may have just died, 
  mine had liver cancer . 
  tough decision but after all he gave us , we felt he deserved to rest . 
  it 's been a year already and i still miss my gorgeous boy so much . 
  stay strong , love < 3, 
  yes !, 
  mine used to give you his paw when you said `` hi '' to him . 
  `` high five ! '', 
  resulted in both paws up . 
  he was insanely smart . 
  damn , they 're sexy . 
  let 's call it a draw and give them both double bonuses ( fotn , potn ) . 
  not even split ? 
  hmmm ... 
   if i wanted generic action and tropes i 'd refilm the lord of the rings in my backyard . 
  [ yeah , of course you would , sunshine . 
  was n't it his jaw ? 
  it looked like his jaw to me . 
  he 's not amused . 
   he will appear again briefly on episode 6, 
  remind me when was that ? 
  i do n't recall an appearance on that episode . 
  or is it referring to one of those super fast flashbacks from when bran was in trance before he got rescued by benjen ? 
  putting it that way , i can definitely agree with you . 
  `` hardhome '' left us pretty much heartbroken and hopeless , `` bob '' turned out to be exactly what basically everyone was expecting it to be . 
  both amazing in their own way . 
  right ? 
  i realized i may have posted this on the wrong sub ... 
  i linked to invicta 's facebook post instead of the actual podcast , major fuck up . 
  apologies for that !, 
  anyway , it 'll only take you an extra click to get to it . 
  announcement is at the 31:50 min mark . 
  also , location is kansas city , missouri ( sp ? 
  ) , july 29th . 
  whether it 'll be a 3 or a 5 round bout is still going to be determined but more than likely it 'll be a 3 round one . 
  rest of the card still to be announced but shannon says `` it 'll be stacked '' . 
  ** edit : ** actual [ link ] ( http://www.invictafc.com/2016/06/20/alexa-grasso-vs-jodie-esquibel-headlines-invicta-fc-18-in-kansas-city/ ) to invicta 's official website with the rest of the card ( so far ) . 
  yes , it is . 
  they do discuss cyborg a little bit but nothing relevant . 
  actually , they did n't even discuss about her , they barely mentioned her and discussed which division should/could be added next to the ufc . 
  ( hint : shannon says flyweight ! ), 
  nothing to the extent of whatever the hell [ this ] ( http://www.gotceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/photos/ronda-rousey/the-tonight-show-starring-jimmy-fallon-in-nyc/ronda-rousey:-the-tonight-show-starring-jimmy-fallon--08-662x1002.jpg ) mess was . 
  yeah , miesha 's makeup on that clip is not super flattering but she does n't look hideous either . 
   some good coaching, 
  i think it was already well established that `` ronda '' and `` good coaching '' do not belong in the same sentence . 
  she said she wo n't leave edmond ~ ~ and iirc , someone renowned called her out for being uncoachable ( as in she 's too stubborn to listen to anything that 's being said to her that does n't conform to how she 's used to doing things , etc ) . ~ ~, 
  anyone correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  ** edit : ** omitting that last part for now because i lack sources to back that up . 
  every time anyone mentions this lifetime network thing , i read it as if she had signed a * literal * lifetime deal and i just ca n't wrap my mind around the idea that anyone with a few functional brain cells would hand her scripts for the remainder of her life while people like meryl streep , emma thompson , glenn close and a handful of other veteran actresses had struggled at some point of their already well-established careers to get certain roles . 
  mind fuckery . 
  wrecking peggy is n't that tall of an order imho , really . 
  still excited to see megan again . 
  just to clarify , i did n't call ronda hideous . 
  now , to answer your question , for me it 's the hair and the dress , which is pretty much the whole look . 
  i 've said it several times before , ronda has this special skill to wear the most [ unflattering ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/10/07/00/2d26513c00000578-3262689-image-m-18_1444174338058.jpg ) stuff the majority of the times . 
  few others , she looks [ nice ] ( https://s1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/1hcgk0xgtvv3jo62zzwi2g--/yxbwawq9ew5ld3nfbgvnbztjad0zmdawo2nypte7y3c9mjiynttked0wo2r5pta7zmk9dwxjcm9wo2g9nziwo2lspxbsyw5lo3e9nzu7dz01mzq-/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/sports/2014-08-12/80fd0080-222b-11e4-8ca4-5dc741565742_453512168.jpg ) . 
  she is n't hideous , she really is n't . 
  but she has this tendency to wear some really ugly shit that does n't do her any favors . 
  why yes , i partially am . 
  that still does n't make that look less abhorrent in my eyes , to be honest . 
  exactly , i agree with everything you said . 
  i wish my memory did n't suck so much , but i almost could swear i saw someone brought that up ( the thing about her being too stubborn ) in another thread . 
  let 's just ignore that part , actually . 
  it 's sufficient to note that she wo n't leave edmond and edmond wo n't bring in other coaches to help her . 
  that alone raises a red flag , from where i see it . 
  wait , there are weight classes in the wwe ? 
  to each their own . 
  it is a nice looking booty , indeed . 
  7 out of 10 . 
  [ amber brown . 
  it would still win , i 'm sure . 
  i was squinting really hard hoping that would be enough to miss watching the possible injury . 
  if it went from point a to point b in no time , you would see tons of people complaining about how easy and silly and stupid the faceless men training is and whatnot , bad writing this , bad writing that . 
  you ca n't please everyone and in this fandom , someone always has to have a problem with something , anything . 
  if the show shows us something , what a waste of time and plot , if it does n't , why did n't it , that 's a plot hole right there , blah . 
  i 'm with you . 
  although slow-paced , arya 's storyline had to be presented . 
  now we know where she came from , what she went through , what it took her to get where she 's standing now . 
  it was ok , not the most entertaining but it was fine . 
  from here on it seems her story will be damn good . 
  10 months ca n't pass fast enough !, 
  to be honest with you , i could n't care less about what people are annoyed by . 
  like i said , without fail , there 's always someone annoyed by something , whether it is anything actually out of place or something completely idiotic . 
  i 've personally enjoyed the whole show for the most part and that 's all . 
  if others have n't , that 's up to them and it 's perfectly valid and respectable , their take on the matter wo n't sway my take on it . 
  i do n't know what to tell you , it is what it is . 
  although , unless i completely missed it , rhaegar ( targaryen , dany 's older brother ) has n't been actually confirmed as the dad as of now . 
  that 's been the speculation for years now though .
