  yep , tough to chew and kinda dry . 
  but maybe mine was just cooked with a shitty method , i do n't know . 
  yeah , well , i 'm not happy about this one . 
  i thought veronica would adjust her weight and forget about bantamweight . 
  she 's michelle waterson 's height and , not meant as disrespect to her , but [ she certainly looks like she could lose the weight . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cpepdpq.jpg ) she even said it herself , she 's too small for the division . 
  if she loses to lina , she 'll definitely have to move down . 
  i wish everyone fought at their natural weight class like she 's doing but the reality is different and she has to adjust if she 's serious about making it to the top . 
  i feel like she has the potential . 
   what the fuck does that have to do with anything ? 
  yeah , the guy is a fucking toolbag . 
  in a different thread , different sub , people were jokingly attributing it to stupid shit such as `` no , it was the videogames/it was the food/no , for sure it was the cartoons/the weather was terrible '' blah blah . 
  mexican politicians/authorities are notorious for speaking out of their asshole . 
  do n't mind him , he 's just doing what his kind normally do , sadly : /, 
  almost the same thing happened to me , but with boetsch and this was on twitter . 
  not only tim but also one of his sponsors back then , a supplements line of some sort , i do n't even remember the name but they had the same hashtag on their bio . 
  it is certainly a good strategy , i suppose .

  seriously , it made me think of those taxidermy rugs the way it spread its paws , that was so weird . 
  crazy range of motion . 
  it 's the same gif the person was referring to , i 'm sure . 
  at least that 's the one i saw over at r/watchpeopledie too . 
  why do i keep seeing so many derpy huskies ? 
  is this a breed thing that you put them in a cage and they turn into goofballs ? 
  that 's both hilarious and adorable . 
  no , but seriously . 
  what are norwegian noodles and could you send me some ? 
  aww man , now you just made me want to get one so bad . 
  i think i know what you mean with `` they never shut up '' . 
  they do this talking/howling type of thing , right ? 
  i 'm thinking about mishka the talking husky or whatever the pup was referred to as . 
   they shed like crazy , though , and need lots of attention and exercise, 
  sounds like a golden retriever . 
  i had a golden retriever . 
  best . 
  companion . 
  ever . 
  i know !, 
  maybe that pug was a flying squirrel in a previous life . 
  starting to rock the red panda look . 
  adorable < 3, 
  what a cute sub < 3, 
  you 're the most kind and caring soul in the universe . 
  [ thank you for coming into my life . 
  marry meeee , ilir !, 
  i 'm not sure how to formulate my question in a clear manner ... what i want to know is if this defence mechanism hurts the little fella in any way ... 
  i 'm thinking about how bees sting and then they die . 
  like none of us would do that . 
  i would . 
  shamelessly . 
  mma media will explode if it 's her . 
  actually , it will explode based on speculations alone , i think . 
  do n't fight it , just embrace it . 
  so , who 's the kind individual ( also very wealthy , apparently ) gilding everyone ? 
  ahhh i was out of the loop . 
  how bad is it ? 
  bless anyone affected by this . 
  and how could anyone condemn a protest over an incident like that ? 
  fuck that . 
  body goals . 
  also hair goals < 3, 
  maybe he 's thinking that if he wins over r/mma , we 'll stop insisting she needs to walk away from him . 
  valiant effort , edmond , but no . 
  you 're still creepy as fuck and she still needs to dump your ass . 
  this is a very serious sub . 
  people are sensible and respectful here , and mods take care of those who are n't . 
  reveal real name . 
  if it 's forbidden , then you do n't do it . 
  period . 
  and if you do it , prepare to face the consequences . 
  want to smoke weed ? 
  go to a place where it 's allowed so you do n't have to worry about going to jail . 
  want to fight roided ? 
  go to an organization with little to no testing so you do n't have to worry about being suspended . 
  it 's not rocket science . 
  whether the ufc should allow peds or not , that 's debatable . 
  the point here is , for now , they 're not , so you either stay away from them altogether or get on some next level shit that will go undetected if you * really * want to be on something . 
  he did neither of those things so that 's it . 
  his own doing and his own demise . 
  i still think moving up is a mistake just based on how full of killers that division is at the top but fair enough , nothing wrong with wanting to make adjustments and seeing how that goes . 
  good luck to him . 
  oh i 'm perfectly aware of all that , actually this very last time he fought and missed weight , i was one of the very vocal ones calling for his retirement if he was n't going to take his dieting serious . 
  i think i actually said something along the lines of `` commit or gtfo '' . 
  obviously he wo n't commit to dieting enough to make 170 again but i ca n't hate on him for still wanting to fight . 
  it 's just a damn shame he really wo n't go anywhere from here , not at 185 anyway , and he ca n't / does n't want to make 170 again so he 's stuck between a rock and a hard place , pretty much . 
  i still say good luck to him . 
  miesha and julianna are friends , so that does n't surprise me in the slightest . 
  its * president, 
  no comprendo . 
  goodbye , dora !,

  chinese overlords , confirm pls . 
  it 's not like people want to see bisping lose , they just want to see him defend the belt against rightful contenders ( either romero or jacare ) and not look for money fights or whatever it is he 's been talking about . 
  i do n't think people in general will call him the greatest ever but they 'll be quite surprised and happy for him , not salty , i 'm sure . 
  both romero and jacare are insane athletes and if he takes those fights , there wo n't be any talks of `` stop ducking the contenders '' anymore . 
  that 's it , that 's all people want to see . 
  if he loses to either one of them , it will only validate the idea ( in people 's heads at least ) that he was indeed ducking them . 
  if he beats either one of them , people will drop that idea and give him all the credit he deserves , even more so if he were to beat both . 
  anyway , point being , people are n't rooting against bisping , they 're rooting against the idea that a champ should pick who to fight next overlooking the people who have rightfully earned the next title shot .
