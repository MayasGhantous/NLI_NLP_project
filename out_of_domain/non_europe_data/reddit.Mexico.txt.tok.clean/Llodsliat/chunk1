nope , it 's gone even without the trinket . 
  or when the drafter just dcs . 
  happened to me once . 
  was horrible . 
  i think it means the more treasures you open , the easier it is to get rare items . 
  for example , if you had 1 % chance in the first one , you 'll have 2 % in the next one , 3 % in the third and so on . 
  that 's my guess . 
  i 'm not sure , though . 
  it updated itself . 
  thanks . 
  i read he rented a car . 
  i do n't remember where i read it , though . 
  [ ] ( #shinx 5 ) i could try it , but as some have stated , it does n't look like a good game . 
  that tent looks like a lambda ( \u03bb ) . 
  half life 4 confirmed !, 
  in dota the pennants are no longer in use . 
  you can still buy them and your pennant will be added to the counter near the teams ' names , but other than that , there 's no use . 
  there have been no new pennants since 2013 , i think , and there will probably be no more . 
  great teams that arose recently like secret , wings , newbee or og do n't have pennants , but old teams that are no longer active like cloud 9 have them . 
  because of the same reason orange side can have yellow and pink cars . 
  also , you can change the colors to make the car blend with the enemy . 
  i have painted my aftershock with both colors . 
  already gave my soul to azura . 
  * when someone outside mexico knows i 'm mexican :, 
  `` is n't there too much violence there ? '', 
  i 've never been robbed and i think i have n't been killed yet . 
  thanks . 
  * when someone outside of sinaloa knows i 'm sinaloense :, 
  `` is n't there too much violence there ? '', 
  but it 's mainly between narcos . 
  civilians are mostly unaffected . 
  * when a sinaloense knows i 'm from guasave : * stupid jokes about guasavenses . 
  * turns out we 're seen as stupid in sinaloa . 
  the more i see pics of iceland , the more i want to go . 
  bitch !, 
  imagine yourself as a cute and loving girl with a weird obsession with someone . 
  i might even forget this one . 
  thought about it . 
  ended up with this :, 
  got ta say most tracer skins are awesome . 
  i hope we get a random option for skins someday . 
  at level 500 + , op probably already got everything it wanted already . 
  is this a superfluid ? 
  i 've got a better one : the mitochondria is a cell within a cell . 
  had to search for [ a note ] ( https://vinepair.com/wine-blog/how-wine-bricks-saved-the-u-s-wine-industry-during-prohibition/ ) i read a while ago . 
  tldr : when the us prohibited alcohol , some wine-makers stuck with their crops and sold grape juice bricks stating that the consumer should not make wine out of it and clear instructions of how to make wine with it so they do n't end up making wine accidentally . 
  ooooooh !, 
  so that 's how it 's done . 
  had i known earlier ... 
  now i 'm annoyed by the cursor . 
  yes , h\u00eb . 
  tree : `` if you excuse me , i 'll just grow here . 
  could you please move out ? '', 
  rock : `` nope . '', 
  tree : `` have it your way , then . '', 
  did you count them ? 
  i do n't need help for that . 
  i did n't know l\u00facio moved to the front using his ult , and i fell into the well without being booped . 
  i guess i broke something down there . 
  yes i had my ult available . 
  '' ** fire in the hole !, 
  self portrait . 
  it makes sense . 
  in spanish , when something is `` redituable '' it means that it gave back what it costed or more . 
  i guess that 's an interesting mutation . 
  if i remember correctly , the icelandic football team coach is a part-time dentist , and iceland managed to get to the quarter finals at the eurocup , and that was just last year . 
  humans must be a nightmare for you . 
  bounty hunting . 
  they see me rollin ' ... 
  they hatin ' ... 
  i know . 
  still pretty impressive , if you ask me . 
  gifs that * might * end too soon . 
  this is so beautiful yet so infuriating , i could pet a kitty , then punch it . 
  the downside i see with this is that she 'll outgrow her hand . 
  as a mercy main , this is the opposite of satisfying . 
  `` a grandpa flew right over me and blasted a pharah with its laser boost ! '', 
  yeah , that was what i was thinking actually . 
  2021 : millions of people arrested due to the police crashing into them . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7ctdrxw.gif ) is the first thing that came to my head . 
  uh ... what 's a cob ? 
  the problem is not solely on the cartels , but also on the government trying to solve it via eradication of drugs instead of rehabilitation for addicts . 
  also , since most of the drugs go towards the us , the us should focus on rehab methods . 
  if nobody consumes drugs , they will be forced to move towards something else . 
  also , by legalizing drugs , you make sure they are taxed , few people are forced to commit crimes ( they are no longer criminals , and i doubt they 'd want to kill or rob someone given they already have a crime-less life ) , and those taxes can be used to rehab .

  is it okay to ask for tips on decorating my town ? 
  not objects , just suggestions or ideas if the visitor has any . 
  thanks . 
  i often do this when i 'm cornered . 
  zarya went to the corner to rescue me , but she was booped . 
  we both died . 
  i love how l\u00facio is like `` i 'm back , bitch !, 
  `` fuck this wall in particular . '', 
  idk , i usually go towards bastion and kill him as zarya . 
  i bet wendy 's twitter account manager is sitting next to the ceo 's desk right now . 
  its *,
