   -- do you want to eat ? 
   -- no , thanks . 
  i already ate . 
   -- here 's some soup , enchiladas and guacamole . 
  enjoy !, 
   -- uh ... what ? 
  he was abducted , instead . 
  i read that trump claimed he only sleeps 4 hours a day , ^ [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/318428-trump-says-he-sleeps-4-5-hours-a-night?amp ) ^ [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/some-people-only-need-a-few-hours-of-sleep-2016-12 ) ^ [ [ 3 ] ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/donald-trumps-four-hours-night-extreme-sleeping-habits-leaders/ ) and this may work for some people , but [ sleep depravation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sleep_deprivation ) is a big issue , and apparently it may have some [ negative effects on the brain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sleep_deprivation#on_the_brain ) . 
  i would n't rule out trump has some sort of brain damage due to that . 
  how can it be used as a defense ? 
  i think you can if you do it on a regular basis . 
  do n't get my word for it , though . 
  i have n't read enough on the topic and i am not a neuroscientist . 
  not for around 40 % of the voters . 
  maybe a mix of both . 
  i would n't rule out he has brain damage , but i would n't claim he has either . 
  however , i am 132 % sure he 's a moron . 
  and he did n't even write that book . 
  the ghostwriter , tony schwarts even regrets ever writing that book .

  it gives what the da fanbase wanted . 
  although i find most of the poorly-designed ocs annoying , i think it 's a nice change and i am actually interested in that game . 
  i found that weird too . 
  i did n't write the article and rules forbid me from changing the title . 
  i was thinking about that too . 
  very uncomfortable . 
  well , since [ you can never touch anything ] ( https://futurism.com/why-you-can-never-actually-touch-anything/ ) , i would choose a. 
  if that does n't work , then i 'll just wear gloves for the rest of my life . 
  throw apples at monkeys . 
  that would sure give you a couple of laughs . 
  shortest . 
  i would be closer to hell than all of you , mortals !, 
  ah , i see master yoda has discovered reddit . 
  a daddy long legs . 
  i could make my own webs and most importantly , i 'd eat all those moth people !, 
  osama when he was in 2 ^ nd grade . 
  he loves that word for some reason . 
  maybe he identifies with it . 
  keep trying , little bud !, 
  nothing better than a wild food battle . 
  but my head is !, 
  i find this funny ; however , i am sure we can find better ( or less bad ) quotes for trump . 
  hey , do n't blame me . 
  i 'm mexican and i ca n't vote in us elections . 
  the last person i would have hoped for president of * any * country would be trump . 
  `` i could be sleeping right now , but this hooman wo n't let me . 
  at lower levels is even worse because since you do n't have a couple of items , you do n't get as many duplicates as someone who is level 300 for example , and you get less money to buy your stuff . 
  it 's not a big amount , but a significant one . 
  in my opinion , the only relevant voice-line is the `` how disappointing '' from zen . 
  wait , is there a `` stuck '' warning ? 
  never noticed it . 
  i do n't blame you . 
  you were at 25 hp . 
  i was kicked out of range test facility as widowmaker for staying in the spawn room despite the fact that i was shooting the robots . 
  no healing . 
  l\u00facio reported . 
  as a mercy main , i 'd rather fight mei 1v1 than winston . 
  whenever winston comes after me , i panic and i 'm all like :, 
   ** get this fucking monkey out of me !!!!, 
  zero suit d.va vs. mercy is the best . 
  there was an attempt at making quality bikes by the vendor . 
  there was an attempt at writing . 
  that looks like a win to me . 
  i think that was r/unexpected . 
  at finding a good title . 
  why do you speak in english and luego empiezas a hablar en espa\u00f1ol ? 
  reaper in a nutshell . 
  i thought it would be something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3y93e4b.gif ) or [ this ] ( http://gaggif.com/albums/userpics/2013y/05/21/8/1/72x5-gaggif.gif ) . 
  since i was expecting something like that , yours took me by surprise . 
  that was certainly unexpected . 
  you * expected * people would break that rule , did n't you ? 
   all modes , maps , and cosmetics will be available to free weekend players except competitive play ( even if you get to account level 25 ) . 
  this includes all anniversary event cosmetics and game modes . 
  so ... will anniversary items be granted ? 
  i want to gift ow to a friend , but i do n't even know if his computer supports it . 
  it 'd be a shame if he played and did n't get any anniversary items . 
  but is n't it a $ 20 usd discount ? 
  that would lower it from $ 40 to $ 20 . 
  i hopped into qp as soon as i got out of the training . 
  this is really cool . 
  good luck everyone !, 
  well , apparently i 'm not elegible since i live in mexico . 
  [ the worst trade deal ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/022/523/c1mgbsvweaanu9k.jpg ), 
  i saw this once and i was so confused . 
  until now , i thought it was something else , but i failed to see it . 
  yeah . 
  i think it favors defense too . 
  i 've won a couple using graviton surge behind the payload . 
  if only there were someone there to stop mercy from rezzing her team .

  jet privado terrestre compartido con otras personas . 
  i liked the cyberian skin ... 
  except for the head . 
  the people who said that * all of them * must be like 500 + . 
  how many credits did you have before the event ? 
  i 've only gotten two , but at least i got symmetra 's skin . 
  i hate soldier 's skin , though . 
  i just want the cyberian and i 'll be pleased . 
  was expecting a deadeye denial . 
  i 'm disappointed .
