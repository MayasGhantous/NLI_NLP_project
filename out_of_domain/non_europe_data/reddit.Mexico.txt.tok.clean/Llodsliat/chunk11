  i 'm not an expert , but having sex with a one year old might kill the baby . 
  just sayin ' . 
  the baby ca n't testify against you , anyway . 
  it wo n't remember anything about it in two weeks . 
  i think you 're not the asshole , anyway . 
  it 's a minor thing in my opinion . 
  it 's just a pet name your sister and her partner like . 
  she could change it , but you could also use something different . 
  you love your partner and your sister loves hers . 
  each show their love using pet names . 
  there 's no asshole here . 
  i 'm sure both of you can come to good terms . 
  do n't sweat it . 
   the main one was that he is fiscally irresponsible, 
  i knew where this was going from there . 
  this guy is too spoiled so even after you pay all the things for him , he even complains about it . 
  ** you are not the asshole ** . 
  you should get your things back and maybe even demand the money back from the expenses . 
  i think that 's good motivation to find a job . 
  i 'd give him between a week and a month to find a job , then i 'd kick him out . 
  if he does n't find one , well that 's his problem . 
  besides , he was the one who was pressuring you to move across the country , he is the one who should have worried about the expenses . 
  well , if it is n't that , the smoke will kill the snake . 
  windows 98 . 
  `` no thanks , dude . 
  i 'm outta here . '', 
  i only see success here . 
  the guy hit the bottle like a champion , then proceeded to run to first base . 
  that 's what you get for stealing human food , you little shit . 
  at translating . 
  * watermelon * is * sand\u00eda * in spanish , not * [ mel\u00f3n ] ( http://www.sercano.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/melon.jpg ) * . 
  whose idea was to combine gorillas with lunar bases , anyway ? 
  that looks like a bad recipe . 
  something like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr5wccr6dau ) ? 
  but why ? 
  you could have waited . 
  maybe you 'll get it later and you 'll regret it . 
  i assumed it was orisa . 
  same . 
  however , as a mercy main , i am still terrified about the other japanese guy . 
  i like how both sheathe their bows and greet each other at the same time . 
  it 's instinctive . 
  whenever i see i 'm in danger i automatically turn around for a teammate and press shift . 
  that three has identity issues . 
  i was wondering if i was looking at a cat that looks like a chip or a chip that looks like a cat . 
  looks like something out of [ \u014ckami ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hi3mq1jmmco/u7uxbdftkki/aaaaaaaaa4e/uddvu-bzxuy/s1600/okami+5.jpg ) . 
  i think it might help prevent people from joining isis . 
  if i read correctly , drawn nips are allowed as long as they are for satirical , humorous or educational purposes . 
  did n't read anything about art . 
  a girl may pose topless in a way that it is art , and i think they 'd still remove it because it is not drawn . 
  well , also mercy is a top-priority target , so whether she flies to her teammates or not , you got ta kill her anyway . 
  in any case , if my teammates are far , but i can glide to them , i 'd cancel my glide in order to avoid the bomb in case it 's not stuck and also not to kill my teammates in case it 's stuck . 
  joking . 
  i 'd panic and just fly away . 
  y el padre es abusivo . 
  i do like mystery heroes . 
  it makes me try heroes i do n't usually play . 
  i usually just pick heroes who can regenerate their health . 
  go for a long match , poke now and then , and eventually the other will die . 
  and all of them are shitty items . 
  this is something dota 2 has , and you can either create wonderful things like having wonderful arcane and legendary items that mix perfectly , or ugly ones with items that do n't even match . 
  i 'd like it to be implemented in other games like overwatch too . 
  never played ranked , but does sr affect the category you 're placed in ? 
  same . 
  it gets from bad to worse . 
  everywhere you go , the floor and stairs are like [ this ] ( https://i.redd.it/1x28gyh51o0z.jpg ) . 
  pop tarts were sold in mexico until around 2005 , i think . 
  i loved them , and they seem to be back , but they were gone for a long time . 
  i absolutely love * mambo # 5 * . 
  i constantly sing * yellow submarine * too . 
  * do n't stop me now * is fantastic . 
  think big . 
  if it 's just a word , you could pick `` the '' . 
  good thing that the only thing that was shot is a photo . 
  until you realize alligator blood is not compatible with human blood and your antibodies start doing a mess . 
  that or the alligator blood overthrows yours . 
  there are so many attempts here i do n't know where to begin . 
  at animating the wall , the tables , or the guy who runs with his legs gone . 
  maybe the dinosaur at eating the plate too or eating vegetables when it 's a carnivorous animal . 
  that parking spot is registered . 
  the sensor was supposed to stop the car , so he did n't worry about it . 
  i think this should go in r/unexpected . 
  this could have gone worse . 
  this person is just plain ** stupid ** . 
  that person may get a darwin award someday . 
  that 's got ta hurt , but i guess a concrete post is better than a 1 ton metal bullet . 
  in high school my classmates called me piqu\u00e9 , because i looked like him . 
  coincidentally , i like playing as defense and i was the fourth on the list . 
  probably one of the things i 'd miss the most if i moved from mexico to the us would be my family , then authentic mexican food . 
  hey , you have a cake on your flair or something . 
  you 're a lie . 
  pok\u00e9mon mystery dungeon series . 
  even if you do n't like main pok\u00e9mon games , you should play mystery dungeon games . 
  quesadillas would be my best bet . 
  all you need is cheese that melts easily ( chihuahua and oaxaca are good ) and tortillas ( flour are the best , but corn tortillas work too ) . 
  you can make them even better with * pico de gallo * ( chopped tomato , onion and chili pepper ) or beans . 
  it says you just celebrated a reddit birthday , so it 's showing a cake next to your username . 
  which one ? 
  my president or the us president ? 
  * ** my president : ** are you dumb or what ?
