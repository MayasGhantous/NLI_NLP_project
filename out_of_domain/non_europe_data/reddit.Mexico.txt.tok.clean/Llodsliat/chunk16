  i got like 85 % of the money needed and i still held my promises . 
  oh , and i got my black wings just because i murdered tons of people in the main town ( do n't remember how it is called ) . 
  so far the only alcoholic drink i 've liked is artesanal cappuccino cream . 
  how do you know that 's not their kink ? 
  up next : '' ` sup , bitch ? '', 
  not all people who need glasses can see badly without them . 
  i can see perfectly well without them , but my right eye might disagree if i close the left one . 
  for instance , i can not read this when i close my left eye . 
  how many copies did you get ? 
  got ta check your doggo printer . 
  satan . 
  why is the guy who killed a dozen people considered the villian , but somehow the guy who denies rights and kills millions of people the good one ? 
  actually they 're somewhat common here in guadalajara , jalisco . 
  never bought a single bread from them , but i know they exist . 
  uncanny valley ending . 
  too soon for something important to happen again . 
  too late after something important happened . 
  just do it !, 
  con un short y chanclas es suficiente . 
  potgs that end too soon . 
  as a mercy main , one of the best things is you should always be moving . 
  glide towards allies now and then . 
  even if you are crossing the enemy lines for a second or two , that is usually not enough for them to react properly . 
  if they want to kill you , they will have to follow you constantly . 
  that being said , crouch now and then just in case some widow is trying to snipe you . 
  she will take longer to shoot you , and has a higher chance of missing . 
  tips for zarya ? 
  this made my day . 
  i am afraid of googling it , so could please someone tell me what is a puppy mill ? 
  `` aguas '' was originally used instead of `` cuidado '' , because before there were toilets , people used to throw their residues out of the window , and since they were liquids on the most part , `` aguas '' was used .

  yeah , but at that speed it could have injured the dog . 
  not only that . 
  many people in the us are sentenced to harsh sentences for victim-less crimes . 
  many people in the us are incarcerated unfairly . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao8l-0nsyzg ) and [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjuxlqnhcai ) may result interesting if you 're curious about it . 
  [ non-mobile link ] ( http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/hundreds-of-bikers-to-escort-bullied-10-year-old-boy-to-school-1.3467513 ) . 
  i do n't know if they 're members of [ bikers against child abuse ] ( http://bacaworld.org/ ) , but i am glad there are a lot of people like this around the world . 
  thanks a lot , random internet person !, 
  now yes . 
  it indeed sounds horrible . 
  you go , i 'll stay here . 
  cool as fuck !, 
  i would submit that to r/diy too . 
  so basically you just hold shift and fly to allies upon sight ? 
  i 've fallen down so many times just because i frantically press shift just in case an ally comes to the corner , only to end up cancelling my guardian angel . 
  yeah . 
  this is actually really great , because since it 's so dark , they ca n't see each other . 
   i 'll support her new career, 
  many people will do on a daily basis . 
  everyday is leg day . 
  i assumed that too , but it did n't make sense ; so i went back to my first assumption that the leg was inside , and then i just imagined the shoe would be empty . 
  i hate the camera man , but i love the illusion . 
  it reminds me of [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/3a/d7/d4/3ad7d441e47365ad321fddcb86f670b0.gif ) , which is ** very ** creepy . 
  i want to get one of these and see how my roommates react . 
  better yet , how my cats react . 
  i supposed the victim was just freed . 
  dota 2 too . 
  and they compensate you with another report available for the week . 
  sandals are a type of shoe . 
  i 've always found it weird when someone who is speaking in english says `` sombrero '' . 
  it just translates to `` hat '' . 
  if you say `` sombrero hat '' it 's even worse . 
  the thumbnail looks like a pink elephant . 
  now i need the bubbles girl running from the bird . 
  hahaha . 
  thanks . 
  wait , is brain damage a common occurrence for cases like these ? 
  i was about to drown when i was a kid , and i may actually be this lucky too . 
  the best is i did n't expect the other two kids to fall over too . 
  i liked the presenter 's reaction . 
  scott pilgrim vs. 
  the world . 
  i think you should post this on r/humansbeingbros too . 
  though i do n't know if this would fall in * humans engaging in normal human behavior * , which would violate rule # 9 . 
  tbh , i did n't know who donald trump was until an interview in telemundo about the border speech . 
  my mother told me she used to hold dt a high respect , and apparently since then , she started to see what a piece of shit he is . 
  it does n't help we 're mexicans either . 
  tbh , i do n't know what you meant by that . 
  i do n't like alcoholic beverages , but i 'd drink vodka , tequila , beer , whatever , to see dt impeached . 
  i 'm fairly sure the only things she knew about dt was that he was rich and given she often reads books for increasing productivity , better money management and stuff , i would not be surprised if she read about dt somewhere stating that he was a great investor and stuff . 
  many us reality tv programs are not aired here , so it 's no surprise i did n't know about him and she did n't get a bigger picture of how he actually is . 
  it took me a while , but i think what u/usapatriot12 meant was the following :, 
   how quickly you [ mexicans ] change [ your opinions ] when we [ us americans ] stop being doormats . 
  tbh i wo n't even bother to try to deal with this guy . 
  at this point in the game , dealing with trump supporters is worthless . 
  it 's a good thing . 
  we 'll call it a [ * deny * ] ( https://dota2.gamepedia.com/denying ) . 
  damn isis , it ruined isis !, 
   your liberal friends are liars spending other people 's money . 
  do you tag your friends ? 
  do you go around saying `` hello , conservative friend , how 's it going ? '' ? 
  anyway , as far as i am aware , liberals are not the ones who want to build a meaningless wall with mexican money . 
  i still keep wondering why qatar . 
  you can say nintendo is the best , and you will piss off sony , microsoft and pc fanboys . 
  i was the weird kid who would trap flies into a pencil sharpener . 
  every time i think about it , i am like `` wtf !? 
   a wall built with other people 's money is free . 
  i have no words to express how wrong that sentence is . 
   the cost of providing social services to every human that runs , walks , or crawls across the border is most decidedly not free .
