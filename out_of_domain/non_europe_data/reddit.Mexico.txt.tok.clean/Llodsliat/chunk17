  yeah ... 
  except mexicans usually work longer for less money and do n't have the benefit of social services . 
  i 'm gon na go with pok\u00e9mon mystery dungeon . 
  it 's hard to hold tears in any of them . 
  i am surprised by the difference in price between mexican and us textbooks . 
  it feels as if the us textbooks were coated in gold or something . 
  the war industry . 
  unfortunately , it seems far from over . 
  as much as i hate mosquitoes , eradicating them would be harmful for many insectivores . 
  then you have surpassed the 10b people quota for the planet . 
  all mosquitoes ( and people ) with malaria suddenly burst as the newly formed elephant bird emerges . 
  so metal . 
  i love how at the end the dog turns up to the cat who is just sitting in the bed like :, 
   you 're doing just fine !, 
  most probably . 
  and yeah , i already knew about that . 
  i 'd feel like shit too if i knew i wrote a book that made a person like donald trump famous . 
   who cares if they work for less, 
  you and anybody with morals should . 
  it affects mexicans who are being exploited , and it affects legal workers whose jobs are taken by mexicans , because they can work more for less money . 
   society must bear all of the social costs such as an emergency room or a prison . 
  can illegals get insurance ? 
  and as for prison , yes , but immigrants actually commit less crimes than locals .

  so sad you could n't save mercy . 
   you seem to have a lot of contradictory opinions, 
  mind pointing out why ? 
   of course they are being exploited , it is the open border that allows it . 
  revolutionary idea !, 
  why not hold immigrants to the same benefits and restrictions than us americans instead of forcing them out ? 
  force employers to pay the minimum wage on immigrants so they are not exploited as much , and us americans have the same employment opportunities . 
  there are already walls where they matter , and forcing immigrants out is a waste of money in transportation . 
  apparently yes . 
  i follow r/vzla just to see what 's up . 
  i do n't have friends or anything there , but i am worried about what might happen there . 
  i do n't typically encourage violence , but given venezuelans are starving to death , the government is censoring everything and much more shit is going on , it is better to rise up and take over than let the country turn into nk or cuba . 
  how to commit genocide without looking like it was genocide . 
  i think she had the potential to stomp trump , but given the low voter turnout makes me think many people thought hc had it in the bag and either did n't show up or jokingly voted for trump . 
  this happened with brexit , and the november elections showed the same . 
  he 's entitled to do it . 
  that 's why he goes to mar-a-lago so often . 
  he 'll be remembered as the biggest money burner president in history . 
  i was visiting a friend in tepic , nayarit . 
  we went to a park with a couple of his friends , and decided to sit in the fast food area to eat . 
  after about half an hour , the people who were in front of me started to murmur and do weird faces , to which i did n't pay attention . 
  then my friend 's cousin , who was sitting just in front of me , asked me to stand up and go with him . 
  we walked a bit , and said : `` the guy over there is masturbating '' . 
  i was perplexed , and upon looking , the guy had his hand inside his jeans masturbating while looking at our group . 
  after around 3 or 4 minutes everyone else just stood up and we left the area . 
  15 minutes later we found the same guy masturbating somewhere else . 
  it 's not crappy design at all . 
  the guy who refilled the machine put the water bottles instead sprite , for example . 
  it looks like fire to me . 
  same . 
  this could go into r/misleadingthumbnails . 
  i would have gone with `` hole in the ground '' , but okay . 
  this goes into r/illusions , not here . 
  neither in mexico . 
  coming from dota 2 , i know for a fact people do n't like playing support , so i assumed it 'd be the same here . 
  it feels like an horror game where everything wants to kill you . 
  i would pay to see donald trump 's expression reading his obituaries . 
  probably lost in translation . 
  it 's working as intended . 
  i think i missed the joke . 
  that looks like tangerine fanta . 
  not as good as orange , but it 's okay . 
  a bigger fox . 
  like a car .

   is this a cigarette habit with some benefits ? 
  a species of urban bird seems to harness the toxic chemicals in cigarette butts in its fight against nest parasites -- although there is a downside to the practice . 
   constantino mac\u00edas garcia at the national autonomous university of mexico , and his colleagues , have spent several years studying the curious cigarette habit in urban house finches ( carpodacus mexicanus ) . 
  initial evidence hinted that [ nicotine and other chemicals in the butts might help deter insect pests from moving into the nests ] ( https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22587-cigarette-butts-help-urban-birds-ward-off-mites/ ) -- nicotine [ does have anti-parasite properties ] ( https://ethnobiomed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-7-21 ) -- but it was n't conclusive . 
   to firm up the conclusion , mac\u00edas garcia and his team experimented with 32 house finch nests . 
  one day after the eggs in the nest had hatched , the researchers removed the natural nest lining and replaced it with artificial felt , to remove any parasites that might have moved in during brooding . 
  they then added live ticks to 10 of the nests , dead ticks to another 10 and left 12 free of ticks . 
   they found that the adult finches were significantly more likely to add cigarette butt fibres to the nest if it contained ticks . 
  what 's more , the weight of cigarette butt material added to nests containing live ticks was , on average , 40 per cent greater than the weight of cigarette butt material added to nests containing dead ticks . 
   ** innovative thinking **, 
   the results suggest that the finches are using the cigarette butts to `` medicate '' their nests against the ticks , says mac\u00edas garcia . 
  `` ectoparasites such as ticks and mites cause damage to finches -- for example , eating their feathers and sucking their blood , '' he says . 
   `` it 's fascinating , and an exciting example of animals being innovative and making use of the materials available to them , '' says [ steve portugal ] ( https://goo.gl/bstwht ) at royal holloway , university of london . 
   however , mac\u00edas garcia 's earlier studies suggest the [ habit is harmful too ] ( https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22730341-600-birds-love-of-cigarette-butts-in-nests-has-two-sides-for-chicks/ ) . 
  `` the butts cause [ genetic ] damage to finches by interfering with cell division , which we assessed by looking at their red blood cells , '' he says . 
   `` i think the anti-parasite effects the cigarette butts provide must outweigh any negative problems they cause , '' says portugal . 
  `` alternatively , the genotoxic effects take longer to manifest , and the adult birds are n't aware of any problem . '',

   in space , grabbing onto things is hard . 
  a new robot that uses grippers inspired by gecko feet could solve that problem , helping clear up the mess of debris that orbits earth . 
   the toaster-sized device can grip , hold onto and move around even large , smooth surfaces in microgravity , on both flat and curved objects . 
  to do this , it uses a `` dry adhesive '' material created by [ hao jiang ] ( http://bdml.stanford.edu/profiles/haojiang ) at stanford university in california and his colleagues . 
   `` this ability to grab onto an object nearly anywhere , instead of needing a specific grapple point that may not even be there , is really advantageous , '' says [ matthew spenko ] ( http://robots.iit.edu/ ) at the illinois institute of technology in chicago . 
  `` it means you do n't need a precision approach . '', 
   in an environment where an accidental nudge can send something flying and space debris can be travelling faster than the speed of sound , agility is key . 
   geckos can hold onto almost any smooth surface with just a few toes , which are covered in tiny rubbery hairs . 
  the ends of those hairs split off into such small strands that they interact with the molecules of any surface the gecko is climbing . 
  this produces a velcro-type effect that acts as an adhesive only when the [ gecko 's toes ] ( https://www.newscientist.com/article/2110541-invading-giant-geckos-get-stuck-on-a-single-building/ ) are pulling along a surface and bending -- an action that increases the area of the touching hairs .
