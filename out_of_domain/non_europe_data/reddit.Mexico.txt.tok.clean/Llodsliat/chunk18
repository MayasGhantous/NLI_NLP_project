   the researchers mimicked this trait for their gripper , which features a thin sheet covered in protruding wedges one-tenth of a millimetre wide . 
  these micro-wedges stick to a smooth surface when they bend as they are pulled across it . 
  single sheets of this type of material have been used before to create [ tiny robots that can climb ] ( https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27413-tiny-robots-climb-walls-carrying-more-than-100-times-their-weight/ ) smooth walls while dragging heavy loads . 
   jiang and his colleagues used two wedge-covered sheets with a robotic pulley that pulled the sheets together once they touched an object . 
  this made the system stronger than the single-sheet version by locking the object between two sets of wedges . 
  attached to a robotic arm , the device could gently grab and secure even large pieces of debris . 
   ** remains of decay **, 
   space junk in earth 's orbit is a growing problem . 
  bits and [ pieces of dead satellites ] ( https://www.newscientist.com/article/2128024-satellite-swarms-could-increase-space-junk-risk-by-50-per-cent/ ) , spacecraft and other discarded or broken-down equipment whizz around our planet , all potentially hazardous to working satellites and the international space station . 
   of the hundreds of thousands of pieces of debris , more than 20,000 are larger than 10 centimetres across -- big enough to smash a piece off a satellite and create even more orbiting junk . 
   ideas proposed for collecting the junk include sweeping it up with a [ giant magnetic net ] ( https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129534-800-japans-huge-magnetic-net-will-trawl-for-space-junk/ ) or vaporising it with laser beams , but none have yet worked out -- and for now , nobody is picking up the trash . 
   that 's where a new robot comes in . 
  the harsh environment of space makes the methods we use to grab things on earth ineffective . 
  a suction-based system ca n't be used , because there 's no air for it to suck up . 
  robotic arms with grasping `` fingers '' only work if there 's something to grab onto , but many pieces of debris have smooth , flat sides . 
   normal adhesives stop being sticky in the cold vacuum , and even sticking down a piece of tape requires enough force to make the object you 're adhering it to float away . 
  more sophisticated schemes are often too big and heavy to launch into orbit . 
   the researchers tested their gecko-inspired grabber in the temporary weightlessness of a parabolic aeroplane flight , and using pressurised air at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) . 
  they even sent a pared-down version for astronauts to try out on the [ international space station ] ( https://www.newscientist.com/article-topic/international-space-station/ ) . 
   on the aeroplane , the device was able to grasp and move around cube , cylinder , and sphere-shaped objects and then gently release them without affecting their motion . 
  at the jpl , it autonomously attached to drifting objects more than 100 times its size and mass . 
  on the space station , it held on to a wall for weeks at a time . 
   `` it 's hard to get all those little gecko pads in contact with the surface and evenly distribute the load , especially if it 's going to work with both flat and curved objects , '' says spenko . 
  `` what 's really impressive in this work is that they scale it up and show that it works in a larger size . '', 
   the gripper may be put to use collecting pieces of drifting space debris for disposal , but it could also be used on a [ robot that can climb ] ( https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13508-climbing-robot-throws-its-weight-around/ ) on the outside of spacecraft , or to help with autonomous docking between spacecraft .

  what did they cover ? 
  as far as i know , her only major scandal was about her mails . 
  that 's awful . 
  it 's like getting mad at a runner for falling over once , and remarking it over and over and over , while not saying anything to the new one , despite it falls constantly , and does n't even try to run fast . 
  in the end , they sent the newbie to the olympics . 
  after wwii , the germans have decided to turn the japanese kamikaze style against them . 
  if anyone is wondering , it 's about the d.va just floating away at the end of the match . 
  it may be possible . 
  we 'd need a study for that , but i find it worthless .

  this looks like a proper isabelle reaction . 
  `` yay , mayor !, 
  you did it ! '', 
  wtf with this comment thread !, 
  i was visiting a friend in tepic , nayarit . 
  we went to a park with a couple of his friends , and decided to sit in the fast food area to eat . 
  after about half an hour , the people who were in front of me started to murmur and do weird faces , to which i did n't pay attention . 
  then my friend 's cousin , who was sitting just in front of me , asked me to stand up and go with him . 
  we walked a bit , and said : `` the guy over there is masturbating '' . 
  i was perplexed , and upon looking , the guy had his hand inside his jeans masturbating while looking at our group . 
  after around 3 or 4 minutes everyone else just stood up and we left the area . 
  15 minutes later we found the same guy masturbating somewhere else . 
  i have no idea why , but once a friend sent me a video of 3 girls kicking and stepping on a puppy until it died . 
  i was sad for days , and i am so sad about remembering it now . 
  i told him to never again send me something like that . 
  i am glad he took my word . 
  oh , and if i 'm not mistaken , those girls were apprehended and sent to prison . 
  i am glad . 
  reminds me of interstellar . 
  how do you turn this on, 
  nice one . 
  killing yourself before even facing the reality of the outer world . 
  well , that 's true . 
  serious question here , besides the r [ e ] ich , who will benefit from this ? 
  i have even seen some centipedes in ask the donald who are against it . 
  genocide disguised as healthcare bill . 
  the best haiku i 've read . 
  `` i feel like a car hit me '', 
  that was actually good for the driver 's health . 
  not much for its wallet , unfortunately . 
  i 'd go with r/nononomaybe . 
  it 's still a heater . 
  that 's why the back is so hot . 
  just what i was expecting . 
  so my parents did n't have a real wedding . 
  who would 've known . 
   cats purr , cats rub against you , cats follow you from room to room , cats gently touch parts of them to you as they pass you , cats blink in your direction slowly , cats show you their belly - this is how cats let you know they like you . 
  this varies from cat to cat , right ? 
  i have two cats and they are somewhat different . 
  * cats purr -- both : check !, 
  * cats rub against you -- sandwich : check !, 
  baguette : sometimes . 
  * cats follow you from room to room -- sandwich : check !, 
  baguette : sometimes . 
  * cats gently touch parts of them to you as they pass you -- sandwich : sometimes . 
  baguette : uncommon . 
  * cats blink in your direction slowly -- have n't paid attention . 
  * cats show you their belly -- sandwich : check !, 
  and he loves belly rubs . 
  baguette : sometimes . 
  she likes belly rubs . 
  in the end i think both love me , but baguette simply is n't as affectionate as sandwich . 
  reminds me to [ this ] ( https://luloposterous.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/image-scaled10006.jpg ) . 
  * el libro rojo * means * the red book * , and * el libro verde * means * the green book * . 
  i honestly do n't know what they are about , but given it is from a chilean show called * 31 minutos * , and the one in the cover usually speaks about environmental effects of humans , i 'd guess it has something to do with it . 
  well , it ended alright , but we ca n't see what 's next , because it 's off camera . 
  member of los zetas ... yeah , no wonder . 
  unlike other drug cartels , los zetas are infamous for mercilessly and brutally kill people as they please . 
  capital punishment is illegal in mexico . 
  not at all .
