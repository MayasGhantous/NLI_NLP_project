  if i 'm not mistaken , el cartel de sinaloa is not like this . 
  sure , they get in fights and kill people from other drug cartels , but it 's not like they go on a killing spree torturing and murdering people as they please unlike los zetas . 
  this is why el chapo is loved by some , because despite being a drug cartel , it brought jobs ( some of them illegal ) and safety to the community by not letting other violent cartels in . 
  they 're mainly between gangs . 
  the only cartel that i know of that goes on a rampage is los zetas . 
  they do kill people mercilessly . 
  drug cartels like el c\u00e1rtel de sinaloa are violent with other cartels , but they make an effort to keep the civilians safe . 
  bruh , do you even rindfleischetikettierungsueberwachungsaufgabenuebertragungsgesetz ? 
  shit 's crazy with that cartel . 
  i have a friend in tamaulipas , and i would be lying if i said i 'm not worried about him . 
  i do n't know which one is worse , but i 'd rather die fighting for my rights than in the hands of a dictator . 
  apparently just because they feel like it . 
  sure , they often target opposing gangs , but they do n't hesitate on killing innocents . 
  this has led many people to live in fear , something which benefits them as it is basically stating `` los zetas zone . 
  do not enter . '' . 
  el c\u00e1rtel de sinaloa has taken a different approach . 
  they defend their citizens and get rid of other cartels , which oftentimes gives them favors . 
  despite culiac\u00e1n being violent , it is relatively safe if you 're not part of the drug trade . 
  actually , sinaloa is below the national average regarding violence . 
  it 's not like it 'll happen 50 % of the times , but it 's definitely higher than in the rest of the country . 
  [ here ] ( https://cohaforum.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/cartels-range.gif ) is a map showing the zones where drug cartels are . 
  i would n't worry about it , but i would n't wander around late in the night , and i would listen for advice from locals . 
  it 's actually a good thing . 
  even if there are no cars , there may be people nearby who might want to cross the road , and that turn signal is a good indication to let them know whether they can cross the road or not . 
  `` it 's only a theory . '', 
  ffs !, 
  it 's a ** scientific theory ** , something which has been studied , peer reviewed , tried to debunk , and still works . 
  what you think about * theory * actually is a * hypothesis * . 
  please inform yourself before opening your mouth . 
  this and that because 3 % of scientists ( whose main area is not even climatology ) do n't think climate change is caused by human activity , it must be false . 
  mustard . 
  even a little bit of it will ruin it . 
  i do n't like it in the slightest , and i did n't really enjoy hot dogs until i started eating them without it . 
  [ piloncillo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panela ) . 
  i love it , but i love it more when it 's in [ pan de mujer ] ( https://www.debate.com.mx/export/sites/debate/img/ahora/2015/10/02/dswdswdewe.jpg_1155019939.jpg ) , wheat bread with piloncillo inside ( cajeta and pumpkin are other options too , but piloncillo is far more popular ) . 
  well , as long as you do n't do stupid shit like that , you 'll be okay . 
  anyway , what we need is a total halt on the war on drugs , legalize them , and open rehab centers with the taxes from those drugs . 
  far safer with better living conditions for everybody . 
  i think crypt of the necrodancer is a really fun game alone . 
  but with another person , you 'll have a blast !, 
  yes ... 
  there 's a big button on the file screen . 
  these grow naturally in mazatl\u00e1n , sinaloa . 
  i have n't seen them anywhere else . 
  also , some species do n't retract . 
  same . 
  i am disappointed and not disappointed . 
  well , that 's true . 
  i did n't consider journalists . 
  my bad . 
  but still my point stands that the government should try to solve it differently . 
  wonderful !, 
  i 've barely heard about the salamanca , so i 'm not really sure . 
  what i commented is influenced heavily by what i 've heard here in mexico , and some research . 
  that 's ... something from breaking bad . 
  say no to vertical filming . 
  the more i know about them , the more i despise them . 
  very real . 
  gravity is a theory because it has been proven to work . 
  the theory says : gravity is directly affected by mass . 
  massive objects attract more strongly than less massive ones . 
  the law says : f = g ( m1 * m2 ) / r ^ 2, 
  ( i do n't know how to use subscript ), 
  gravity is measurable , and until we find a better explanation for it , we 'll keep using it . 
  the theory is the explanation . 
  it describes how or why something happens . 
  it is supported by several hypothesis . 
  example : half-life ( symbol t 1/2 ) is the time required for a quantity to reduce to half its initial value . 
  the law is how it works . 
  usually based from well-supported hypothesis that accurately predict outcomes . 
  example : t 1/2 = 100 / ( 2 ^ n ) , in which * n * is the amount of half-lives elapsed , and the result is the percentage estimated of the substance that has not decayed . 
  it 'd be great to just say '' ** fuck it !, 
  ** '' , legalize everything and use the taxes for rehab centers . 
  well , i have n't watched breaking bad , so ... 
  i know , but it 's a combination of well sustained hypothesis what makes a theory . 
  i 'd say it depends on the region . 
  in western areas you see news about gangs fighting each other . 
  in eastern areas you see news about gangs killing civilians . 
   coppinger pointed out that the law of gravity was discovered by newton in the 17th century . 
  this law mathematically describes how two different bodies in the universe interact with each other . 
  however , newton 's law does n't explain what gravity is , or how it works . 
  it was n't until three centuries later , when albert einstein developed the theory of relativity , that scientists began to understand what gravity is , and how it works . 
  ^ [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://www.livescience.com/21457-what-is-a-law-in-science-definition-of-scientific-law.html ), 
  the law explains how to reach from point a to point b. 
  the theory explains why it gets us from point a to point b. 
  no matter how many times i pronounce `` a hypothesis '' , it still sounds weird . 
  it may be because i pronounce it `` ai-po-the-sis '' . 
  thanks for pointing it out , though . 
  i thought this was the surface of jupiter . 
  is there a subreddit like * awesome dads * or something ? 
  well , the first time i saw that we murdered everyone , i was excited , and when i heard '' * team kill * '' all i thought was '' ** hell yeah !, 
  you might want to submit this to r/mademesmile . 
  the worst that can happen is you snap your neck . 
  legalize drugs . 
  peaceful drug dealers now have access to many rights ( specially law rights ) , making them less likely to commit any other crime . 
  impose taxes on drugs and use the taxes on rehab centers . 
  drugs wo n't just disappear ( as evidenced by tobacco and alcohol ) , but it will regulate the consumption and drug addicts will be able to recieve treatment . 
  improve the lives of those who need it . 
  people with shitty lives tend to use drugs more often than happy people . 
  better education for everyone .
