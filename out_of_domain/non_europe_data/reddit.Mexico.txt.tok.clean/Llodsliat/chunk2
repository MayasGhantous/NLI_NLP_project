  it is `` apagando las luces '' , which translates to `` turning off the lights '' . 
  edit : nevermind , i just checked the in-game comments . 
  if that was a highlight , i wonder which was the potg . 
  typical . 
  november 2016 . 
  i do n't know about you , but i 'm not a talking bathroom . 
  -- who 's a good boy ? 
  -- not me !, 
  lol, 
  also , i have read china supports dprk because they do n't want us military bases directly next to them . 
  the us already has plenty of military bases in south korea and japan , and i doubt they want more in north korea . 
  [ us military bases around the world ] ( http://images.politico.com/global/2015/06/23/backpage-11601.jpg ), 
  besides , other than getting back the northern territory , south korea does n't benefit from taking north korea back .

  many people do n't know what this is . 
  at least it was n't [ tsai ing-wen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tsai_ing-wen ) . 
  i like dota in this sense . 
  the best healer in the game ( dazzle ) is evil , though at first sight he does n't look like it . 
  even other supports like necrophos or lion are evil too and they are really helpful in teamfights . 
  if you do n't leave in time or are too near to the meka , you die . 
  i 'd love it to be implemented . 
  i totally feel your pain . 
  i 've risen like 20 levels since the event , and gotten my arcade lootboxes , but i 've gotten a total of 2 event skins during all the event , which are :, 
  * widowmaker, 
  * widowmaker, 
  the best part is i do n't even play widow . 
  guys , how does this formatting thing work ? 
  in russia , civil ships take military ships down . 
  whales are mammals . 
  mammals have either penises or vaginas ( depending on the individual ) . 
  maybe , but it would n't be uncommon for people who just pop symmetra 's ult as soon as they summon it , instead of carrying it up to a place they consider viable . 
  i was playing as mercy in nepal . 
  we were 1-1 . 
  i was being targeted by winston to the point in which i had difficulties getting out of the spawn to reach the point . 
  when we finally lost the match , soldier started complaining why i died , to which i replied `` well , dk is killing me . 
  '' , to which he replied `` well , do n't die '' . 
  like sure , i am perfectly able to kill or evade winston by myself . 
  keeping in mind your sorroundings also helps . 
  once soldier tried to flank me , and the best i could do is use my blaster to shoot back . 
  probably they do n't expect a mercy to fight back , which i did . 
  he took me down to like 25 hp , but i had a health pack behind me , which i used , then killed the soldier . 
  he did n't use his healing probably because he thought he was going to kill me . 
  dicks pointing where the team should go . 
  * dicks with a purpose *, 
  maybe not the * best * , but it is absolutely a step in the * right * direction . 
  so , the president still dies . 
  the secret service did n't do a good job , then . 
  i would love to see sandwich with fat cheeks , but i guess it 's too late now . 
  i think it is natural since bullying is now a known issue , people pay more attention to it , and it can be ** recorded ** now , which did n't happen previously . 
  other factors may be involved , but in my opinion these are the most important ones . 
  you can feel l\u00facio 's fear . 
  yeah , well i only got 2 event skins , and both were for widow , which i do n't even use . 
  i had to buy the mercy skin and i was 100 gold off from buying another skin . 
  * ctrl + shift + w : close all tabs for the window, 
  * ctrl + shift + tab : previous tab, 
  * ctrl + n : new window, 
  * ctrl + shift + n : new incognito window, 
  i came here just for this . 
  i would n't be surprised if that happened with my country ( m\u00e9xico ) . 
  i did n't even know this was a thing . 
  before overwatch , i was obsessed with dota , and when i spoke through the mic , most of them would n't notice , but those who did said i sounded like an * american * , but that i sounded a bit off and spoke slow . 
  even though i am american for being born in this continent , i am all 100 % mexican , as in 100 % not u.s. american . 
  now , i have not seen a single complaint about accents neither in dota nor in overwatch about myself nor about other non-english native speakers . 
  yeah . 
  i love how it ends in a cliffhanger from that last arrow . 
  hi , may i come at 8:00 pm or later ? 
  okay . 
  thanks a lot . 
  i 'll add you as soon as i get home . 
  that sounds fine . 
  i get home at around 9:30 cdt or 7:30 pdt . 
  no problem . 
  by the way , i just added you . 
  great host and super friendly . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  i left you a review . 
  75 feet is almost 23 meters for the rest of the world . 
  yeah , that 's why i think the first place is in a huge advantage ( besides being in first , of course ) . 
  the first place only has to worry about the players behind it , covering from shells ; however , 2 ^ nd and onwards have to worry about players in both sides . 
  that 's why once the first player has a considerable lead , it 's really , ** really ** hard to get to it . 
  si usas android , te sugiero swiftkey . 
  cool . '' . 
  `` widow , can you change ? 
  you 're not doing shit . '', 
  try that with rein . 
  the ball just goes to the side . 
  forgot to mention that too . 
  200cc is a `` counter '' to this , as you usually do n't want to grab the coins . 
  also at that distance her glide would most likely do nothing . 
  i like how they all turn around in panic . 
  -- winston , use your shield !, 
  -- it 's on cooldown !, 
  -- zarya , your bubbles , quick !, 
  -- they 're on cooldown too !, 
  -- ** omg !, 
  -- ** omg !, 
  -- ** omg !, 
  then their corpses just go slightly up before falling in the same spot . 
  yeah . 
  if you 're used to braking .
