  educated people are more prepared for life . 
  with better education you create a competitive environment while improving the lives of those who previously had no access to it . 
  this is wishful thinking , but if the government heads were decided to improve the lives of everyone instead of filling their pockets , it would be something different .

  the interesting thing is that although we thought dinosaurs were lizards in the beginning , now we know they were some kind of birds .

  it does , but the problems are the following :, 
  you ca n't fight all gangs at the same time . 
  when nixon started the war on drugs , mexico joined too , but the us army is several times bigger , more experienced , more loyal and better trained than the mexican army . 
  sending militants to fight the drug trade creates misery . 
  it usually ends up in deaths from traffickers , soldiers and civilians while achieving nothing as the traffickers can be easily replaced . 
  it has been tried before . 
  calder\u00f3n resurrected the war on drugs and it achieved nothing .

   the total mass is estimated to range between 1/25 and 1/10 earth masses . 
  conversely , models of the solar system 's formation predict a collective mass for the kuiper belt of 30 earth masses . 
  ^ [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kuiper_belt#mass_and_size_distribution ), 
  if we took the estimate of the solar system 's formation model , 30 earth masses distributed evenly between the 100k bodies you said , you would have 100k bodies of 3/10 ,000 earth masses or 1.7916 * 10 ^ 21 kg , ( slightly more massive than ceres ) ; however , if we took the estimates listed before , each body would be between 2.3888 * 10 ^ 18 kg and 5.972 * 10 ^ 18 kg , which would be about 200 to 500 the mass of phobos , or 1/5 ,000 to 1/2 ,500 the mass of pluto .

  this is also why allergy tests are done by slightly piercing the skin with infected needles .

  fun fact :, 
  although in spanish the translation for * lemon * is * lim\u00f3n * , and the translation for * lime * is * lima * , in mexico we refer to the lime as * lim\u00f3n * and the lemon as * lima * . 
  so essentially [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/lemon.jpg ) is a lemon for you , but a lima for us , and [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/lime_blossom.jpg ) is a lime for you , but a lim\u00f3n for us . 
  * porque * is the equivalent to * because * , * por qu\u00e9 * is the equivalent to * why * . 
  so , basically you just said `` because why not both ? 
  humans are smart short term . 
  humans are stupid long term . 
  this is my stance on this :, 
   your hand is not a sentient being . 
  it 's true . 
  i wo n't debate that . 
   your dog is not capable of consent . 
  not at all . 
  dogs are capable of expressing whether they like something or not . 
  for instance , some may like belly rubs and lay on their stomach hoping for you to pet them while others may not like it and growl or bite you . 
  now , regarding sex would be the same . 
  a dog who does not growl or bite might not find the situation particularly comfortable , but it is not giving any signs of being not okay with the act . 
  also , male dogs often try to hump things , and that would count to me as consenting . 
  however , i have to say that since sex is involved , there might be diseases that might be transferred from one to another , and the person involved in the act should be informed about the possible risks and take steps to avoid them . 
   a child is not capable of consent . 
  a child is capable of consent , but since most children do n't know the risks and consequences , i am opposed to it until it is old enough to know what it 's getting into . 
  around 12 years would be a proper age to learn about anatomy , sex education and stuff , but the earliest i would state it 'd be okay to have sex would be around 14 or 15 years and with proper protection . 
   slavery and property is not consenting . 
  well , that 's true , but slavery is a crime on itself . 
  what would you consider `` property '' in this case ? 
  my favorite one is the one from @s8n stating :, 
   come back son . 
   seriously if the kids of today do n't have these things , how will they focus on more than just `` survival '' to get a higher education or trade to take care of themselves . 
  they 're not supposed to . 
  that 's what the republicans want . 
  yeah , but it does n't really need to be ** that ** hard . 
  they had the proper equipment and they were still struggling . 
  then they should have .
