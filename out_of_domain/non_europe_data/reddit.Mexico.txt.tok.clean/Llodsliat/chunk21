  i do n't see why firefighters or local authorities would not be equipped with the proper tools to remove local manholes . 
  i still think they should be accessible even without that much equipment . 
  that 's the most reasonable explanation . 
  well , to be fair that 's what humans do to protect other species ... with limited success . 
  it sickens me so much that those people who are opposed to abortion are so willing to let a kid die . 
  `` just get a new one '' is the worst . 
  these people are completely unaware . 
  i am really sad and really mad right now . 
  the most coherent speech i 've heard from trump in a while . 
  redundant , but it was understandable at least . 
  accidental allahu akbar . 
  idk . 
  to me god seems to be the spiteful one . 
  you know , killing millions of people because they did something he did n't want because he gave them free will , but no brains . 
  satan looks like the chill one here . 
  he killed only a few people in the bible , and he incites people to do cool ( and stupid ) stuff . 
  besides , i think god would be surrounded by people who blindly worship him and do nothing good . 
  also , he 's busy fulfilling requests for people who want to win the lottery , want to win a contest , but lets african children starve because that would break his free will rule . 
  satan on the other side , i do n't exactly know how he 'd spend his time , but whatever it is , it most probably is more entertaining than watching god .

  tldr : ** follow satan **, 
  he gave humans the sense of ** adventure ** . 
  well , of course that 's a thing . 
  hopefully , someday . 
  the * raids * are the best . 
  i already said it [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/6khy2j/what_common_misconception_do_you_hate_to_hear/djmkrxr/ ) , but i 'll repeat it again , because it 's so frustrating it drives me nuts . 
  `` it 's only a theory . '', 
  ffs !, 
  it 's a scientific theory , something which has been studied , peer reviewed , tried to debunk , and still works . 
  what you think about theory actually is a hypothesis . 
  please inform yourself before opening your mouth . 
  hl3 wait time . 
  making them feel bad so they can feel good . 
  you have to pay extra $ 20 usd in order to see them . 
  similar here in mexico with top hat . 
  we had a new movie that apparently was n't aired anywhere else . 
  global thermonuclear war with kittens . 
  you can open it in photoshop and read it in the timeline tab . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , that 's some threat a little kid threw and got a lot of backslash and lots of memes arose due to that . 
  i did n't think the us would give a fuck about latin american memes . 
  that face , though : \u2191 _ \u2191, 
  for the rest of the world , that 's 33.68 meters . 
  saving them for future worthy generations . 
  not when they will disregard this as `` fake news '' and move on . 
   keep your friends close , and your enemies closer . 
  the alt-right took it literal , and the countries that are next to the us are the enemies now ; and russia which is 3.8 km apart at their closest point is the friend now . 
  reminds me of a clause in the tos of a game that said that there was a $ 2,500 reward ( if i 'm not mistaken ) for the first person to claim it . 
  nobody claimed it until several years later . 
  full transcript :, 
   the laws of the jungle are often brutal , but so it seems are those of copyright . 
  for years a wildlife photographer has been dragged through the courts in america over whether or not he owns the copyright to a photograph of a monkey , who supposedly took the image itself . 
   now , the case is being [ taken to the 9th circuit court of appeals ] ( https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wj8pm9/the-selfie-monkey-goes-to-the-ninth-circuit ) by people for the ethical treatment of animals ( peta ) , who claim to be representing the monkey , and the poor photographer [ is basically bankrupt ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/monkey-selfie-macaque-copyright-court-david-slater ) . 
  while judges have previously ruled that the monkey can not own the copyright , peta has appealed against these decisions . 
   the battle for ownership of the photo began years ago , when the now infamous portrait of a black sulawesi crested macaque was posted on wikipedia without a license . 
  the photographer , david slater , objected stating that they were stealing his picture , only for wikipedia to counter that it was , in fact , the monkey 's own work . 
   after that , peta decided to take up the case and represent the monkey after slater used the image in a book of his wildlife photographs , suing both slater himself and the publishers for breaching copyright laws . 
  peta sought [ a court order to administer any proceeds ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/monkey-selfie-case-animal-photo-copyright ) earned by the image on behalf of the monkey , and use it for the conservation of the species , despite having no previous interactions or demonstrable interest in them . 
   and so started the long , drawn out , distressing , and mostly downright ludicrous legal battle over who owns the `` monkey selfie '' image . 
  peta argues that the monkey that took the photo of itself by pressing the button knew what it was doing and so has artistic ownership of the photo . 
  slater , on the other hand , says that he spent three days in the forest gaining the monkeys ' trust , and setting the cameras up that eventually resulted in the selfie taking place , and that it would not have occurred without his input . 
   the point is , peta does n't appear to actually care whether or not the monkey is the original author of the photograph . 
  the animal rights organization has jumped on the case and is using it to further its own agenda , mainly in attempting to set a precedent that [ an animal can own property ] ( https://www.peta.org/blog/peta-appeal-monkey-selfie-case-grounds-monkey-owns-copyright/ ) , and can be treated as a human in the eyes of the law . 
   [ they argue ] ( https://www.peta.org/blog/this-selfie-may-set-a-legal-precedent/ ) : `` if this lawsuit succeeds , it will be the first time that a non-human animal is declared the owner of property , rather than being declared a piece of property himself or herself . '', 
  but the two are not mutually exclusive . 
  the macaque was not under threat of being or becoming property , and giving it the right to own property does not change its situation . 
  it has , however , resulted in bankrupting and ruining a man who was trying to make a living as a wildlife photographer by highlighting the plight of the endangered macaque . 
  i do n't get it . 
  do people in the us affiliate with a party and are required to vote for it or is it something entirely different ? 
  here in m\u00e9xico we have several parties , and we can vote for whoever we want . 
  we do n't have to register ourselves as `` pri '' , `` pan '' , etc. 
  the other day sandwich tried to catch mario when i was watching a smm gameplay . 
  he has n't tried ever since , and baguette seems uninterested . 
  they do n't vote at all ? 
   reforestar marte, 
  implying it had nopales before . 
  i beg to differ . 
  although they do n't seem to be common , dark flour quesadillas can be found in northern sinaloa . 
  also quesadillas with chilorio and/or chorizo are the best . 
  reminds me once i was eating a muffin and i saw sandwich getting nearby . 
  i expected him to smell it and turn around ; instead , he fiercely bit my muffin without even smelling it . 
  all people at fox news think the russia story is a big deal , but a few rational people at fox news acknowledge that . 
  the problem is fox news is entertainment , not news media . 
  the title reminds me of pinoccio 's explanation on where shrek is :, 
   prince charming : you !, 
  you ca n't lie !, 
  so tell me puppet ... where ... is ... shrek ? 
  hmm , well , uh , i do n't know where he 's not, 
   prince charming : you 're telling me you do n't know where shrek is ? 
   pinocchio : it would n't be inaccurate to assume that i could n't exactly not say that it is or is n't almost partially incorrect . 
   prince charming : so you do know where he is !, 
   pinocchio : on the contrary . 
  i 'm possibly more or less not definitely rejecting the idea that in no way with any amount of uncertainty that i undeniably, 
   prince charming : stop it !, 
   pinocchio : ... do or do not know where he should n't probably be , if that indeed was n't where he is n't . 
  even if he was n't at where i knew he was, 
   [ pigs and gingerbread man begin singing ], 
   pinocchio : that 'd mean i 'd really have to know where he was n't . 
  that 's the only thing saving us now .
