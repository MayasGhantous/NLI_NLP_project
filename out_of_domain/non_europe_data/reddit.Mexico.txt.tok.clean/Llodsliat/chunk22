  republicans in a nutshell . 
  i for one would love it . 
  goal posts made of candy , nets made out of braided [ skwinkles ] ( http://cdn1.bigcommerce.com/server2500/k2eyh8/products/200/images/1259/mexican-candy-skwinkles-chamoy__56402.1491104803.380.500.jpg ) , [ chocolate balls stuffed with rompope ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5268/5598251279_63e8ae57f6_b.jpg ) , edible grass like in charlie and the chocolate factory , and a cup full of ice cream . 
  i 'd watch that . 
  sound barrier . 
  my first reaction was `` why is this person filming his screen instead of just recording it with a program ? 
  '' , then i understood . 
  it 's never too late to be a human being bro . 
  the only one i find familiar is gallowboob . 
  the us would be a laughingstock if it were not for the fact that the us has weapons of mass destruction and is the country that produces 15 % of the greenhouse gasses . 
   `` all this i will give you , '' he said , `` if you will bow down and worship me . '', 
  til satan is no different from god . 
  you 're gon na be searching * el libro rojo * in the green section and * el libro verde * in the red section . 
  [ here ] ( https://luloposterous.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/image-scaled10006.jpg ) 's how the books look like . 
  take that extra bit a little to the south , and you have madagascar . 
  battle mercy vs. battle mercy is absolutely the best . 
  i remember once i was battling another mercy , and nobody of either team interfered just to know who is the greatest battle mercy . 
  that 's close to the [ 25 % fervent trump supporters that wo n't go away ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/07/17/trump-and-his-base-live-in-a-bubble-where-hes-popular-and-all-is-well ) . 
  it is no more interesting than it is sad and worrisome . 
  mexican here . 
  i think the us is a mixed bag . 
  we feel envy towards your economy and how the world sees the us , but at the same time we feel badly towards us ' culture of racism and narcissism , even though we have problems on our own . 
  some people feel that way while others do n't , but either way , dt is not helping in any way . 
  in mexican spanish we do n't have more than two pronunciations for a single letter ( with the notable exception of the x ) and the only letter combinations that exist are the ch and ll . 
  ** m ** is always pronounced as in * mario * . 
  ** o ** is always pronounced as in * olivia * . 
  ** l ** is always pronounced as in * laura * . 
  ** e ** is always pronounced as in * edgar * . 
  so , in the end it is pronounced * moleh * . 
   15 bucks or more . 
  or live in mexico and get all the ingredients with that much money . 
  comedy = tragedy + time ... 
  that 's the us american way of saying it , i think . 
  you 'll never hear a mexican say `` molay '' . 
  trust me , i 'm mexican and i speak taco . 
  my best bet is they 're chicanos . 
  * we 'll be there together *, 
  clever . 
  i want mole now .

  traditionally , you just heat the tortillas up and use them to scoop the food . 
  yes , but with pauses . 
  you can suck , let 's say , 3 meters , then you rest and put your finger on it letting few air in , then after you 've recovered , continue sucking . 
  rinse and repeat . 
  yeah . 
  forgot that . 
  i do n't get it . 
  you 're actually contributing to the conversation . 
  the pronunciation you 've heard is ultimately wrong , but it stays on topic and it is good hearted . 
  do it !, 
  r/getdownmrpresident and r/animalsbeingjerks would rejoice . 
  they did think about it :, 
  repeal obamacare . 
  replace it with something good . 
  done . 
  that 's their magnificent plan . 
  the bill says something like `` the best heatlh bill ever . 
   and having to have never earned either from anyone, 
  well , he has n't earned it , but he sure does seem to have a quarter of the us population by the pussy . 
  they 're very loyal to him , even if his hand has herpes , and their pussy end up very badly . 
  here in mexico products cost more and more but they do n't shrink . 
  that is now a 60 year old trump supporter . 
  whater . 
  new ethical problem : the trolley has become self aware , and 5 people are tied to a track and one on another track . 
  you do n't know to which track the trolley is going , but you can repair it removing its sentience so you can get control of it . 
  will you do it at the cost of an innocent trolley ? 
  i think this 3 warning thing can be traced back to sbm or kirby air ride . 
  * most people emerge from suspension terribly undernourished . 
  i want to congratulate you on beating the odds and somehow managing to pack on a few pounds .

  hey !, 
  psst !, 
  do you want some drugs ? 
  i thought they did it so if they were toxic , the toxins would break down under the heat of the sun . 
  watch jack jack attack short . 
  it explains why the house is like that and why syndrome is in the house . 
  this tells me you do it frequencity . 
  where did we go wrong ? 
  i thought it was a mushroom . 
  me neither . 
  i hope you like radioactive shrimp . 
  yes . 
  which one is stronger in this case ? 
  kakistocracy or [ kleptocracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kleptocracy ) ? 
  when i watched it i did n't know much about it , but lots of people were speaking about how good it was and it won an oscar and stuff . 
  when i watched it at my parents ' house , i thought it was just below ok . 
  do architects and engineers take in consideration demolition efforts during their building plans ? 
  what a weird glitch . 
  x-post from r/mildlyinteresting . 
  all hail the supreme leader of the united states . 
  the new monarch is here . 
  what i would do is legalize drugs and decriminalize non-violent drug traders . 
  regulate drug trade and use the taxes to open rehab centers and improve the quality of life in poor areas . 
  this might be hard to implement , but it 's much better than sending troops to an unwinable war . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao8l-0nsyzg ) and [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjuxlqnhcai ) are some videos that will further explain my points . 
  so , yes . 
  although i think calder\u00f3n was an okay president , the war on drugs is a huge failure and further reinforcing efforts on fighting drug cartels does n't help and creates huge misery . 
  we need customer rehabilitation instead of producer retention . 
  thanks youtubot .
