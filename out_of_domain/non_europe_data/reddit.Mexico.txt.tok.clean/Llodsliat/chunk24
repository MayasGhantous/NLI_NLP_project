  just today i cried of laughter and it felt really good . 
  i , on the other hand was never proud of my president . 
  standing against trump gave pe\u00f1a a few points and a bit of my respect . 
  pe\u00f1a still has like a 300 point deficit , so there 's lots more to recover . 
  i beg to differ . 
  pe\u00f1a has been a running meme since his presidency began . 
  he 's done several stupid things , and there 's even [ a page ] ( http://diassinepndejadas.com/ ) that tracks the last day in which pe\u00f1a did a stupid thing . 
  it 's been 50 days since the last epndejada , but when he started his presidency it resented constantly . 
  not that it would help . 
  trump 's approval ratings in m\u00e9xico are higher than pe\u00f1a 's , and trump 's approval ratings are very , very low . 
  ^ [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/19/mexico-president-pe-nieto-more-unpopular-than-trump/96667458/ ) ^ [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-mexico-president-20170301-story,amp.html ), 
  so , if pe\u00f1a were to run for reelection , he would probably lose by a big margin with or without trump 's help . 
  trump : hey enrique , wan na be the next porfirio d\u00edaz ? 
  i got it right away , but could n't figure out what i was supposed to see . 
  but it 's pretty straightforward :, 
  your : possessive, 
  you 're : contraction of * you are * . 
  that applies to its and it 's , their and they 're , etc. 
  so basically if you can use the extended word , then that 's the correct one . 
  you can say `` we are here '' , so saying `` we 're here '' ; conversely , you can say `` we were hanging out '' , but you ca n't say `` we we are hanging out '' . 
  me : where 's the hu ... ** holy shit !, 
  that 's why i just browse the dashboard . 
  you could go to r/mexico or any other hispanic reddit . 
  some of these names were used for the anniversary profile pics . 
  got ta try this with sandwich . 
  syria del ponte committed terrible what !, 
  it 's not like fox news presents numbers in the most intuitive way . 
  [ this one ] ( https://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/images/countyfair/fnc-an-20120220-gasprices.jpg ) for example , makes it seem like gas prices have been rising less , but in reality they compared last year vs last week , and last week vs today . 
  in [ this one ] ( https://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/images/item/fnc-an-20111212-markedchart.jpg ) 8.6 % is higher than 8.8 % . 
  [ this one ] ( https://am11.akamaized.net/med/cnt/uploads/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-31-at-4.30.19-pm.png ) is just ... 
  and [ this one ] ( http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/50b62c2669beddc340000005-470-272/fox-news-graph-fail.png ) . 
  i do n't think they even know what a quarter is . 
  to be honest , i do n't know if their numbers are accurate , and i do n't even know if their fanbase is able to notice that . 
  [ bonus ] ( http://combatblog.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/phony-chart.jpg ), 
  the first one about obamacare is like [ * you tried * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j75vic8.png ) . 
  the second one is like [ * bruh , did you even try ? 
  * ] ( https://68.media.tumblr.com/fb3b23fd76f922caad886b69342dd555/tumblr_inline_oea09n2ath1qebhag_540.jpg ) . 
  it makes more sense , but it still is misleading . 
  the higher the unemployment rate , the worse for the population . 
  a 25 % unemployment rate means a quarter of the population is unemployed . 
  by not lowering the dot at the end , it makes it look like the unemployment was n't reduced , but the numbers say otherwise . 
  they all are . 
  some more than others , but they all lie . 
  i love how hexagons match , and seeing that in a chart [ is just ... ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/019/698/d96.jpg ), 
   and survive falls from crazy heights, 
  that 's because of their terminal velocity . 
  anything lighter than a squirrel will survive a drop from any height . 
  heavy objects usually have a higher terminal velocity because they can displace air easier than lighter objects . 
  this is also why light objects like paper can float while metal sheets ca n't . 
  living in a third world country ( mexico ) , i 've always wondered why the us has so many problems with college debt when here middle class families can afford to send their kids to a good school . 
  i come from a middle/middle-high family in mexico , and my parents have been able to pay the school of my sisters and i , albeit troublesome at times , but still . 
  i was playing ball tag ( we call it * ponchados * here ) , and my cousin , which was next to me had the ball . 
  i ran , but since i was between two parked cars i could n't see the incoming motorcycle and that 's how i got a scar in my knee and next to my ear . 
  the rider had the big prize since he broke a bone thanks to me . 
  also , once i was on my cousin 's bike ( yes , the same cousin ) around a block , going down [ rough terrain ] ( http://images.summitpost.org/original/493589.jpg ) , when suddenly i stepped on a sunk manhole and i flew spectacularly before having my face slammed on the ground . 
  that 's how i got my mountain scar on my forehead . 
  i do n't know what to say about this , but the fsm article in wikipedia has [ this graph ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/piratesvstemp%28en%29.svg ) about it . 
  snoop dogg . 
  i loathe the smell of marijuana . 
  mexico should have never joined the us in the war on drugs . 
  we gain nothing fighting cartels . 
  we should just regulate drugs and use the taxes for rehab clinics . 
  that 's only wishful thinking .

  hey , you better not make the world a wasteland before i get to see the total solar eclipse in mazatl\u00e1n on april , 2024 . 
  but at what cost ? 
  a small step forward is still a step forward . 
  even though i hate the smell of marijuana , i am all in favor of legalizing it . 
  so willy wonka is japanese ? 
  my hypothesis is that he ran from one school to another , so everyone in every school in the state knew this guy . 
  in my house we had one of these with jesus ' head . 
  horrifying . 
  as a straight man , i have to admit that is a [ fine ass ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/019/698/d96.jpg ) . 
  unexpected . 
  i tried to use r/adultjokesinchildrenmovies , but the name was too long , and even changing children for kids was too long . 
  i did n't want anything ambiguous nor an abbreviation . 
  say * no * to boat discrimination !, 
  is it common in the us for stores like walmart to sell weapons ? 
  is n't this basically a calzone ? 
  any height . 
  at some point the force of gravity and the capacity of the object to displace the air around it cancel out and it can not go faster without external forces or rotating . 
  cats have a [ righting reflex ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cat_righting_reflex ) which greatly helps them land safely , but terminal velocity is often fatal for them . 
  you can throw a rat from an helicopter and it will land safely . 
  where can i get solar glasses in mexico ? 
  i live in guadalajara and i 've only seen solar glasses on the internet , but none of them go below $ 2,000 mxn and some have a delivery date after the eclipse is over . 
  the life saver looks so good on it . 
  what 's the procedure , then ? 
  my dad is addicted to coke ( the drinkable one ) . 
  he 's obese now and no matter how many times i tell him , i know he wo n't leave it easily . 
  does rp stand for `` roleplay '' or `` rape '' in this case ? 
  and contrary to most other websites , it is a non-profit organization that only shows non-intrusive ads asking for donations when in need . 
  the 2 +2 = 4 totally cracked me up . 
  x 'd, 
  does this count as politics even if he was n't into it at the time ? 
   what are you doing ? 
  omg , that 's genius !, 
  no , no !, 
  do n't take it away . 
  yes , that 's good .
