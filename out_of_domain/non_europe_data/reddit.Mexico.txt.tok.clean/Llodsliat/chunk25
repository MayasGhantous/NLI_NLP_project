  it 'd be more satisfying if they showed the result of the asymmetric ones afterwards . 
  would n't air resistance be higher on lighter pendulums since they ca n't displace as much air as heavier ones ? 
  i do n't like the sculpture , but the execution is amazing . 
  i think it might belong to r/atbge , but prolly others will disagree . 
  i , on the contrary , like playing videogames with my younger cousins , and saying stupid jokes with my colleagues . 
   2/3rds of the time it works every time . 
  knowledge is power . 
  is n't nsfl for gore or life-threatening situations ? 
  except when these people vote for the person who favors oil industry and removes regulations . 
  i 'm way more excited for that one , because the totality will be near my birthplace , and it will totally be where i spent some of my childhood . 
  yes . 
  what is this r/blackmagicfuckery !, 
  but seriously , what black magic fuckery is this ? 
  `` gently '', 
  i 'd suggest you taking an . m down there , mate . 
  the link opens the mobile site on desktop . 
  which gulf ? 
  you were 100 % right . 
  a girl with hair colored magenta . 
  i would n't call it `` art '' . 
  you tried . 
  why so ? 
  i would tag people with cartels as `` protesters '' . 
  pedestrians rarely carry cartels . 
  so it becomes sentient and later we can praise our overlord u/pic _ description_bot . 
  right , but not quite . 
  technically yes . 
  context is important . 
  and his back too . 
  no chipmunks . 
  sorry , mate . 
  i 'm not really sure . 
  i 've had cats with a few hairs popping out from their limbs . 
  i heard you wanted a wwe themed wedding . 
  well , of course [ richard can funk ] ( https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2014/07/28/09/can%20richard%20funk3.jpg ) . 
  `` okay ... 
  i think i 'll just die '', 
  * stands still *, 
  `` redditors have gifted 15 months of reddit gold to tomfour for this submission . '', 
  how ironic . 
  lol . 
  it 's sfw . 
  i think it means a good measuring system . 
  many people have two legs , but some people have one or none , and nobody has more than two . 
  this means that even though most people have two legs , the average is slightly below that . 
  the irony is that the user who posted that got 14 months of gold ( last time i checked ) . 
  i googled * sega acronym * and found this :, 
   ** service games and **, 
   ( japanese : \u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30bb\u30ac\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b9 hepburn : kabushiki gaisha sega g\u0113musu ) , originally short for ** service games and ** officially styled as sega , is a japanese multinational video game developer and publisher headquartered in tokyo , japan , with offices around the world . 
  that 's weird . 
  it 's interesting how nintendo consoles have been used for different purposes . 
  wii , for instance , helped people with parkinson 's disease .

  nk does not want war . 
  it would certainly mean total annihilation for them , but they can not give up on their nukes , because that would mean the us can invade nk without any retaliation . 
  what nk wants is the us to stay at peace and continue in its own world , but trump has little patience and does n't know how to shut his mouth , so that has quickly escalated into defensive nk measures . 
  north korea will not attack first , but if the us attacks , it will not hesitate to strike back . 
  if they 're gon na fall , they will make sure the us regrets it . 
   the world could always use more heroes !, 
  please tell me there 's a subreddit for silly bootleg stuff like this . 
  they are not the norm , but they 're not uncommon either here in m\u00e9xico . 
  well , no ** shit ** sherlock . 
  see this ? 
  this is the same shit you do . 
  been playing plague inc a lot lately , i guess . 
  with his hand full of mushrooms ? 
  sonic heroes in ocean palace being [ chased by a big rock ] ( http://www.jameswoodcock.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/stg_oceanpalace013.jpg ) . 
  and the full phrase for the expression is :, 
   curiosity killed the cat , but satisfaction brought it back . 
  just what i thought . 
  this belongs in a museum , not the trash or a public stand . 
  for some reason it reminded me of [ this ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/077/564/d5b.jpg ) . 
  the bot actually has around a 60 % success rate . 
  some of them are correct if taken out of context , like the car ramming into people in charlottesville in which the bot said people were surrounding a car . 
  not wrong , but out of context . 
  the remind me bot is helpful too . 
  i agree with u/glazed _ beagle . 
  downvoting the submission , but upvoting the comment . 
  is it big and * spacey * ? 
  my best bet is the chemical processes in the brain stop and you cease to exist . 
  humans have always been wondering about immortality , and religion relieves that aspect for many people . 
  do you remember what happened before you were alive ? 
  pre-life and post-life is pretty much the same . 
  you are not alive , and you 're not in a forever-dreaming stasis . 
  the atoms in your body , including your brain , go away and there 's nothing in place to replace them . 
  energy is a thing , but it ca n't store information . 
  the energy in your body just dissipates and transfers to other things or simply flies away to space . 
  it does n't matter if the energy comes from your heart , brain , leg , eye , or anything else . 
  and with this i must ask : what is life ? 
   why are millennials killing ... their bosses ? 
  that trump is a good person and will kick latinos out , but he 's my homie so i 'm good ? 
  well , to be fair , i do n't even live in the us , so i 'm good in that sense . 
  i still fear trump and his nazi rhetoric , though . 
  potatoes would keep ai away ; unless a superior ai sticks the inferior ai into a potato , so now you can call it potatos . 
  teach a fish to man , and it will be depressed for life . 
  there 's around a 25 % of people who are so loyal to trump that they would shoot their neighbor if trump asked them to . 
  there was a post about this in r/dataisbeautiful . 
  brb . 
  it 's red vs. magenta , but i agree . 
  even with context .
