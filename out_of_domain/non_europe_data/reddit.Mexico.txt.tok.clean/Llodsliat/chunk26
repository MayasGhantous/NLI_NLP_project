  it 's not an unpopular opinion . 
  probably anybody who has taken the time to play any pmd will agree that they 're better than the main series ; however , since they 're spin-offs , fewer people play them . 
  well , yes , but the brush would work even better on the switch than on the wii since you do n't have to actually point at the tv . 
   -- stop your bullshit , stupid nazi !, 
   -- i 'm not a nazi , you idiot !, 
   -- so , waving the nazi flag while screaming racist insults do n't make you a nazi ? 
   -- they 're not racist , they 're the truth . 
  and waving the nazi flag does n't make me nazi . 
   -- sure ... 
  that 's how i picture nazis defending themselves . 
  soviet ukraine . 
  it 's something . 
  i like the concept , but neither the photo nor the photoshop are good . 
  beautiful . 
  besides , it is a good conversation starter . 
  i 'd say one ejaculating penis tattoo is already too many ejaculating penis tattoos . 
  a cat survived the sinking of 3 ships . 
  the cat was called * [ unsinkable sam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unsinkable_sam ) * .

  when i joined the company , we could only go casual on fridays . 
  since december , everyday is friday . 
  my mom seems worried about this . 
  she 'll often ask me if i have a girlfriend or if i 'm interested in someone , and i 'm just like `` sure , i may get a girlfriend someday . '' . 
  she 's way more worried about that than i am . 
  what 's it about ? 
  what ? 
  definitely not my kink . 
  that 's why i 'm trying it at the park , not at home .

  ** has a horrible story of racism : ** i do n't think anybody is denying that . 
  what is undeniable is that the democratic party has moved beyond that , and is pushing for progressive values . 
  ** supports socialism : ** that 's not necessarily a bad thing . 
  venezuela is a socialist country where things went wrong . 
  iceland is a socialist country where everything is okay . 
  socialism , if implemented correctly , can be a great platform , and that 's what some european countries are doing . 
  ** nearly all of their extreme groups are fascist in every way but name : ** that 's a new one to me . 
  care to explain or post links ? 
  ** they can push nazis as a `` right-wing '' group : ** yeah , but nazis are aligning themselves with donald trump , and share some of his ideas , like separating populations because clearly one group is superior to the rest . 
   national socialism , more commonly known as nazism , is the ideology and set of practices associated with the 20th-century german nazi party , nazi germany , and other far-right groups . 
  sometimes characterised as a form of fascism that incorporates scientific racism and antisemitism , nazism 's development was influenced by german nationalism ( especially pan-germanism ) , the v\u00f6lkisch movement and the anti-communist freikorps paramilitary groups that emerged during the weimar republic after germany 's defeat in first world war . 
   far-right politics often involve a focus on tradition , real or imagined , as opposed to policies and customs that are regarded as reflective of modernism . 
  many far-right ideologies have a disregard or a disdain for egalitarianism , even if they do not always express overt support for social hierarchy , elements of social conservatism and opposition to most forms of liberalism and socialism . 
   the term is also used to describe ideologies including nazism , neo-nazism , fascism , neo-fascism and other ideologies or organizations that feature extreme nationalist , chauvinist , xenophobic , racist , or reactionary views , which can lead to oppression and violence against groups of people based on their supposed inferiority , or their perceived threat to the nation , state or ultraconservative traditional social institutions . 
  [ far-right politics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/far-right_politics ), 
  what else do they need to elaborate , though ? 
  there 's plenty of evidence . 
  the dots are already linked . 
  all they have to do is say `` yup , dittos are mew experiments . '' . 
  my best bet why they do n't do it is because they do n't want to fall in controversies like the first movie with the professor 's granddaughter 's clone anymore .

  if it does n't work , i usually try to analyze what i am disappointed about , break it down and try to make myself think that i am overreacting .
