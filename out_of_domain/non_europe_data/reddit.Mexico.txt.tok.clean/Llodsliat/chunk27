  and flat earthers . 
  what 's with that kek flag ? 
  i often see it on td . 
  i do n't see why not . 
  who would 've thought . 
  i 'd love to see this with the world and % population . 
  i might even do it myself once i get my computer . 
  there should be a bot for this . 
  nope . 
  ca n't see the cat . 
  i 'll get to see only a partial . 
  i 'll get to see a total eclipse in mazatl\u00e1n , sinaloa by april 2024 too . 
  yeah , but think about this way :, 
  fetuses with ds are aborted . 
  the gene starts `` diluting '' , so it becomes rarer and rarer . 
  there will be a time in which there will be no fetuses with ds , given the disease has been eradicated . 
  yeah , but there 's a huge difference between terminating the life of a human in development compared to an already developed person who can , indeed , enjoy life . 
  then why are babies born due to incestuous relationships more likely to be born with ds ? 
  the huge difference is , as you said , the person can say whether it wants to be alive or not . 
  regarding fetuses , they simply do n't care because they do n't know any better . 
  and i would consider a fetus a person until its nervous system is developed . 
  as for ai , that is a different moral issue to which i am not prepared to face . 
  also , people with low iq can have good lives . 
  just because you do n't have good problem solving skills , it does n't mean you ca n't develop other skills like cooking , singing , being a comedian , etc. 
  going back with the people with ds , it 's not much about them . 
  they can have a happy life , but taking care of a person with ds requires more effort than a person without . 
  an effort some families are not prepared to face . 
  sounds good to me . 
  i experienced something similar . 
  with friends . 
  in a plaza . 
  witnessing a stranger jerk off under his pants . 
  probably yes . 
  it was n't being blocked by other cars . 
  and that blue sign clearly states `` human abduction '' . 
  that 's how the abduction begins . 
  the animal being jerk here is the human for throwing the treat knowing what could happen . 
  you ca n't be virgin if you 've banged your cousin already . 
  god 's wrath !, 
  -- zeus, 
  it has a napkin bandana . 
  it 's so precious . 
  it looks like soggy boobs to me . 
  from what i understand , fish 's gills are somewhat like a mop . 
  when they 're underwater , the gills float around and function properly . 
  outside they can still `` breathe '' , but it 's extremely exhausting as they can only absorb around 20 % of the oxygen they usually would . 
  this means they suffocate more slowly and painfully than a land animal underwater .

  so , yes . 
  humans being jerks here . 
  reminds me of the south korean kids who died trapped in a sinking ship . 
  joining 75 % of the human population who think the same . 
  when i watched it at work i had a hard time trying to contain myself too . 
  i 've watched it a dozen of times already , but it never fails to make me laugh . 
  the machine . 
  tortilla machines have n't changed much since i can remember ( which is about 20 years ) . 
  they 're still as big as they used to be 20 years ago ; something like [ this ] ( http://www.mexicantortillamachine.com/images/mexican-tortilla-machine-with-hopper-ml-60.png ) . 
  this is a big change , since this way tortillas do n't need as much space as they used to , and the only thing remaining is the heating process . 
  source : i was born in , and never left the taco republic . 
  the clich\u00e9 mexican music that is heard at tortiller\u00eda is a square radius screech . 
  seriously , if you are in m\u00e9xico and hear a screech , it 's almost certain a tortiller\u00eda is nearby . 
  idk . 
  conventional tortilla machines look awfully hard to clean or setup . 
  it 's not uncommon in some mexican cities or towns for people to go around in bikes or motorbikes selling tortillas and newspapers . 
  a tricycle of [ this style ] ( http://www.tugentelatina.com/media/images/imagemanager/9/000014marzo/desnudasc/dove/images_5.jpg ) might be enough . 
  they 're pretty common throughout m\u00e9xico . 
  i was born in guasave , sinaloa . 
  i have lived in sinaloa , guerrero , m\u00e9xico city , estado de m\u00e9xico and jalisco . 
  that must be intentional . 
  surprising how td acts pretty much like a cult . 
  conversely , sandwich ( my cat ) always turns his head when i touch him . 
  even if i did the same 3 minutes ago . 
  i 'd add colon separators for numbers in the ranges of thousands , but other than that , everything is okay . 
  a game with good graphics is , in its time , good . 
  a game with good gameplay or story is forever good . 
  yeah , but that means the oil bureaucrats will stop getting richer . 
  can someone think of the poor rich bureaucrats who will have to sell their yachts in order to keep their 5 ^ th house ? 
  it 's alarming , because the trump administration is showing signs of wanting a genocide . 
  ** classification : ** people are divided into `` us and them '' . 
  ** symbolization : ** when combined with hatred , symbols may be forced upon unwilling members of pariah groups ... 
  ** dehumanization : ** one group denies the humanity of the other group . 
  members of it are equated with animals , vermin , insects , or diseases . 
  ** organization : ** genocide is always organized ... special army units or militias are often trained and armed ... 
  ** polarization : ** hate groups broadcast polarizing propaganda ... 
  ** preparation : ** victims are identified and separated out because of their ethnic or religious identity ... 
  ** extermination : ** it is ` extermination ' to the killers because they do not believe their victims to be fully human . 
  ** denial : ** the perpetrators ... deny that they committed any crimes ... 
  [ genocide watch ] ( http://www.genocidewatch.org/images/8stagesbriefingpaper.pdf ), 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eight_stages_of_genocide ), 
  it 's easy . 
  go to a trump tweet , press f12 , then select the text after pressing the button at the upper-left part of the dev tools , then edit it . 
  the echo locator seems pretty strategic to me . 
  i use it to help my teammates , track enemies and refill my tank . 
  that 's 2.31 meters for the rest of the world . 
  that 's 2.16 and 1.83 meters , respectively , for the rest of the world . 
  can all these people be locked up after the presidency is over ? 
  they were fighting for bdsm .
