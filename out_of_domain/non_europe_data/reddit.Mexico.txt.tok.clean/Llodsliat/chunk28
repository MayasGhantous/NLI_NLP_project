   oh my god it 's god . 
  yeah . 
  everyone will be asking jesus for salvation when the bridge collapses due to poor calculations . 
  i do n't know . 
  there seem to be quite a lot of racist folks in texas , and i would n't like people like that . 
  besides , most of them are people who love their damned weapons , and m\u00e9xico has a strict no-gun policy , which they would hate . 
  they would push for pro-gun laws , and that wo n't be good . 
  m\u00e9xico went to war with france ( then superpower ) for some [ damned cakes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pastry_war ) ; and m\u00e9xico would go to war again if necessary . 
  if the us paying for the wall is bad , m\u00e9xico would fall in ruins . 
  we ca n't afford to build a wall , but we can afford to defend our territory . 
  it 's natural . 
  the us has helped m\u00e9xico in previous occasions , and viceversa . 
  overall m\u00e9xico and the us are in a good relationship . 
  right now the relationship is in a `` do n't talk to me unless you do this . '', 
  phase , but m\u00e9xico still wants a good relationship and wo n't do that , because it would be bad for both , but will still help for when the phase is over . 
  i usually do n't because my company 's network is shit . 
  so unless i 'm at home , i wo n't read anything . 
  that 's why i love tldr bot . 
  the objective was successful . 
  the means were not as expected . 
  yes . 
  also i see examples in cases like venezuela or north korea . 
  the government is similar , but the population is completely different . 
  venezuelans are fighting for their rights , and most of the world will agree that those who are taking parts in protests and the soon to be revolution are the ones who have all the right to fight for it . 
  north koreans on the other hand , do n't fight for their right because they are either ignorant or are afraid of what could happen to them . 
  in this case , violence is the answer .

  [ psbattle : this wave crashing over a rock ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/6wqz9m/psbattle_this_wave_crashing_over_a_rock/ ), 
  it 's the same with sprays . 
  they use different substances so the ozone layer is not affected ( or not as much ) anymore . 
  this goes unnoticed , but you do n't hear anymore about the ozone layer , because it is healing and no more action is required regarding it . 
  is the red one paris ? 
  i see . 
  when i tried the first time it was blurry , idk why . 
  sometimes it becomes so common , individuals with this trait become president . 
  they 're pretty common throughout mexico . 
  the ones i can remember are :, 
  * pineapple, 
  * coconut, 
  * orange, 
  they are pretty common throughout mexico in restaurants . 
  animal crossing . 
  in some zones in m\u00e9xico , some ubers got their windows broken ( and i think one was killed ) by taxi driver protesters . 
  if they are gon na protest , they should protest to the service providers who , to be honest , provide an awful service at high costs . 
  in canc\u00fan , ubers are banned because uber could not reach an agreement with the government . 
  leaders should have empathy . 
  this guy seems to have negative empathy . 
  he thinks everyone should feel sorry for him and how he 's being treated . 
  and to think that of the last 7 elections , democrats have won the popular vote in 6 of them , but have won the presidency 4 times . 
  here 's my opinion on these :, 
  * ** halle truck : ** bad taste , awful execution . 
  * ** colorful beetle : ** i loved it . 
  * ** witch wagon : ** not so bad taste , but bad execution . 
  * ** domino van : ** by far , the worst . 
  * ** mortem car : ** good execution , but bad taste . 
  at least it 's not as crammed up as the others . 
  * ** ph3onix car : ** first of all , it 's `` phoenix '' , not `` pheonix '' . 
  second , wtf !? 
  it 's awful in taste and execution . 
  * ** d\u00eda de los muertos : ** if i did n't know , i 'd say it 's awful , but actually the festivity is supposed to be colorful and happy ; and that is reflected here . 
  i like it . 
  * ** trophy wife car : ** omg what were you thinking !, 
  i did n't know that car existed . 
  i wish it had stayed that way . 
  will have a hard time explaining that to its sexual partner ( s ) . 
  russia : we helped trump . 
  my best bet is the egg hatched inside the snake . 
  taken from [ sandra and woo ] ( http://www.sandraandwoo.com/ ) comic . 
  i 've got ta try this and make a shinx . 
  lots of shinx , actually . 
  also everyone who has not lived under communism has or will die . 
  maps without indonesia . 
  maps that depict tasmania as being new zealand . 
  you 're correct . 
  source : i 've watched gravity falls , and i 'm 2638 % sure the guy on the left comes to life . 
  paraguay is landlocked too . 
  sticking to the tradition . 
  tbh , i thought these were shadows of people being tortured . 
  it 's because of temperature . 
  also , since bolivia is within the amazonas , i would expect the temperatures to wreak havoc on the forest . 
  i 'm subscribed now . 
  and will do . 
  cool . 
  i 'm famous now . 
  it ca n't be stressed enough , though . 
  good point . 
  one asks for a glass of h2o . 
  the other one says , `` i 'll have a soda . '', 
  the other chemist walks away angry as his murder attempt failed .

  hahahaha . 
  i do n't understand a thing , but i like it . 
  like a garage . 
  or muddy water . 
  whatever is fine as long as i do n't see this car . 
  how much pressure would wheels exert ? 
  my first flash drive was of 128mb . 
  this makes it like 3,125 times greater in a space 20 times smaller .
