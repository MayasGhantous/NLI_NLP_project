  [ signs of a cult ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/06/the-seven-signs-youre-in-a-cult/361400/ ) :, 
  opposing critical thinking -- check !, 
  you ca n't argue with people whose sole response is `` fake news ! '' . 
  isolating members and penalizing them for leaving -- not sure about this , but i would guess non-trump supporters in trump areas get lots of hate . 
  this is just an assumption , though . 
  emphasizing special doctrines outside scripture -- the wall or banning muslim minorities . 
  seeking inappropriate loyalty to their leaders -- like nazis marching and seeking approval from the president . 
  dishonoring the family unit -- tbh , i am not sure what is meant with this . 
  crossing biblical boundaries of behavior ( versus sexual purity and personal ownership ) -- grabbing 'em by the pussy is a way . 
  separation from the church -- n/a, 
  10 years, 
  winners and losers alike get to compete in the paralympics next year . 
  never seen jumbo eggs in mexico . 
  is this an only in the us thing ? 
  i feel like this man will start singing mambo # 5 at anytime . 
  new earth bending defense system . 
  20 feet equals 6.096 meters . 
  that 's what i said !, 
  i thought it was jelly . 
  6.096 rounds to 6.09 . 
  6.09 rounds to 6.1 . 
  my best bet is they just created some scrolls and died in tragic accidents . 
  yet trump wants the us to go to mars before the end of his second term . 
  `` shhhh ... do n't say it . 
  yes , we do it , but do n't say it out loud . '', 
  taco bell is as mexican as domino 's pizza is italian . 
  these kind of posts are intentionally misleading . 
  i 've never met someone who told me to be proud of my country . 
  i 'm just happy to have been born here . 
  we have excellent and diverse food , diverse cultures , and really nice people . 
  i know other places have different food and different cultures , but i 'm just happy with what i 've got . 
  i would definitely love to go to iceland , for example , but i think that if i had born there , i would not get to visit many different places like in m\u00e9xico . 
  it 's a different environment , a different mentality . 
  i know people do n't like living here , and that 's sad . 
  but i also know many people are happy with their birthplace , and that makes me happy . 
  50 % of $ 0 is $ 0 . 
  good luck mugging me !, 
  reminds me of this mexican dude , [ gilberto bosques sald\u00edvar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gilberto_bosques_sald%c3%advar ) who issued visas for around 40k spaniards and jews fleeing from europe at the rise of wwii . 
  i really thought they were books . 
  cute , but this is not a misleading thumbnail . 
  i thought it was flan . 
  nice one , tocayo . 
  `` this painting makes me look fat . '', 
  30 % front driver 's fault for braking over a rat . 
  70 % back driver 's fault for tailgating . 
  reminds once i had a muffin , and i expected sandwich to smell it and go away uninterested . 
  instead , he munched my muffin without even smelling it . 
  i just drew a smiling face . 
  switch when !? 
  i knew what this was about even without context . 
  though , this would need 2 layers of context for it to be relevant , since this post only points to the comment without saying anything about what they 're talking about . 
  same . 
  they formed a party to fight irma together . 
  soon there will be more need to clarify it , as colonization is within our lifetimes . 
  i did n't see any video there . 
  death and misery . 
  kill : harvey, 
  double kill : irma, 
  triple kill : jose, 
  ultra kill : katia, 
  m\u00e9xico : nieto pe\u00f1a , president [ of the ] year . 
  it makes sense , but far from accurate . 
  tbh , i do n't see what we can lose letting central americans into the country . 
  before jan 2017 , no . 
  mexican government is super corrupt , but not potus 45 corrupt . 
  i think the difference is that ( as far as i know ) many mexicans are against these things , while in the us it 's debatable . 
  i do n't get it . 
  a list of the 20 most-watched talks on * all the platforms * we track : **ted.com , youtube , itunes , embed and download , hulu and more ** . 
  `` i can show you the world . '', 
  i 'm just gon na hit san antonio . 
  haha !, 
  just kidding . 
  lem me go around houston . 
  oh , thanks . 
  would have never guessed . 
  i think we do n't even have that brand in mexico . 
  a period . 
  devil buildings . 
  does the fbi have any jurisdiction in countries other than the us ? 
  we had a similar table . 
  instead of having a full new table span to the other side , it just had an extention on both sides so the table could be like 1/4th wider . 
  that would be really inconvenient . 
  specially for the actor . 
  this pic begs for a war zone . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tax_rates#countries ) tells me otherwise , but i 'm no accountant , and to be honest i do n't know what all this gibberish means exactly . 
  i loathe trump , but by looking at wikipedia i can not say trump is lying in this case . 
  i do n't like it , tbh . 
  [ http://imgur.com/gallery/2sggxw1] ( unless you 're daisy ), 
  i hate that road with all my soul . 
  i love sky garden from super circuit . 
  sadly , we have n't seen it in any recent mk . 
  as far as i can tell , in mk8 the red shell follows you on the ground to hit you there . 
  you ca n't defend with items like this , because they are directly underneath . 
  this is an actual quote , though . 
  fits perfectly well . 
  as soon as the kid smiles , his face is stolen . 
  i think `` the kids next door need me '' fits better . 
  that is just pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo .
