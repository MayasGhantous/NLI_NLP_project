  even in 150cc i hardly had the need to stop . 
  in 200cc i stomped against the walls every 3.53 seconds . 
  sometimes it does . 
  also it depends on the player . 
  i 'm getting good at 200cc , but at first i had a hard time , until i learned that i can brake while i drift . 
  not long ago , i did n't use bikes on manual ( for mario kart wii ) , because of the inside drifting . 
  i was so used to outside drifting , that i found bikes hard . 
  now in mk8 i use bikes with inside drifting , once i figured out how it works . 
  now i have a hard time using outside drifting cars or bikes . 
  figures ... 
  and yes , when 200cc was announced , i was really excited about it . 
  however , i played mario kart 8 for the first time until early this year . 
  well , as long as canada is not in the american continent , i guess it 's okay . 
  who would 've guessed . 
  that 's even more hardcore than traumatic inseminations . 
  i will use it as space helmet and microwave it in space .

  ~ ~ fun ~ ~ cool fact : sea fossils can be found on top of mountains because they arose from the sea . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/12/us/whale-fossils-high-in-andes-show-how-mountains-rose-from-sea.html ) is one article about it .

  i still do n't have an rmm . 
  that mother teresa was a good person . 
  she may have thought she was right , but letting sick people suffer because `` they need to suffer as christ did in the cross '' is outrageous . 
  also , she accepted treatment for her heart diseases , which contradicts what she had been done to other people . 
  she was not friend of the poor , she was friend of poverty . 
  most spiders are harmless and wo n't bite people unless they have no other choice . 
  people fail to realize that spiders are more afraid than us . 
  regardless , phobias are called like that for a reason . 
  i think it belongs to r/skyporn . 
  no problem . 
  i 'll let you know . 
  i 'm at work right now . 
  i will be available from 9:30 pm cdt onwards . 
  if you 're available then , you can join . 
  if not , tomorrow in the morning the price will have risen . 
  she did . 
  and she actually received funding , but she refused to get medicine or treatment for the ill , so they could `` die as god intended '' . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , nobody knows where the money went . 
  here are some links . 
  i have n't read them fully , but i 'm in the process .

  i 'm pretty sure you can find positive things about mother teresa , but all i found was from christian websites . 
  edited my previous comment adding some . 
  regardless , here they are again .

  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/criticism_of_mother_teresa ) is a wikipedia article about it . 
  maybe some of this criticism is fake or over the board , but i do think that stating that mother teresa was all-saint is too much . 
  remember : if you do n't sin , jesus died for nothing .

  ** boom !, 
  with itself . 
  since nixon , mexico is at war with drug cartels . 
  why ? 
  nobody knows . 
  it only benefits the governors accepting bribes from the cartels , i think . 
  okay , it 's a step in the right direction , but it is not complete . 
  this is what in my opinion has to be done :, 
  * legalize drugs and decriminalize dealers and most importantly , consumers . 
  by doing this , you get people with rights who will fight for what they want legally , instead of doing it by force . 
  * tax drugs and use the taxes for rehab centers . 
  drug addicts will receive treatment and drug use will be reduced . 
  you get nothing by reducing the supply if the demand is not reduced first . 
  * keep an eye on the population . 
  people who have poor lives tend to cope with it using drugs . 
  helping those in need instead of incarcerating them helps them recover . 
  only the high levels win in this drug war game . 
  it 's time to stop this .

  it 's not death . 
  it 's the way they died . 
  no problem . 
  have a nice day . 
  yeah , i actually wondered about it . 
  instead of displaying skulls , it should display a hero portrait . 
  yeah . 
  sometimes i wonder how many people and which ones i rezzed because they die so spread out and i just rez in the middle of the flight . 
  i 'm at home . 
  i 've added you . 
  if you wan na come , you can do it . 
  is there a proper word for that ? 
  thanks a lot .
