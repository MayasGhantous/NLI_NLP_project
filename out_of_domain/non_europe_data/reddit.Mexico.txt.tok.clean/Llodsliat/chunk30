  [ jesus is a socialist hippie ] ( http://www.sandraandwoo.com/comics/2009-11-30-[0116]-jesus-of-nazareth.png ), 
  why did i read this in soos ' voice ? 
  or riverhorse for the matter . 
  i love how the pitbull being licked by the cow is like `` oh , stop it . 
  yeah . 
  the problem i see with the switch is that you can not use the touchscreen while in tv mode . 
  i lived in mazatl\u00e1n for 3 years , and although i did n't experience any hurricane , i would have just gone to estado de m\u00e9xico with my parents . 
  i imagine some people would do something similar in the us . 
  1 month, 
  1 month, 
  1 month, 
  yes , but with a much better title . 
  [ she ] ( http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/lazy_susan ) is lazy susan . 
  literally . 
  something like `` avenge me , my friends ! '', 
  when the cause of death was suicide . 
  although the official name of m\u00e9xico is mexican united states ( estados unidos mexicanos ) , it is most commonly referred to as mexican republic ( rep\u00fablica mexicana ) . 
  idk why . 
  someone did . 
  my mother and middle sister felt it and they were terrified . 
  my young sister and father did n't because they were asleep . 
  i did n't feel it because i am in guadalajara , jalisco and i was asleep . 
  the only earthquake i have felt in my life is the [ 2009 guerrero earthquake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_guerrero_earthquake ) , which happened in the morning , and i was in the school in estado de m\u00e9xico when it happened . 
  the adrenaline rush goes from 0 to 100 % in a matter of a few seconds . 
  it 's impressive .

  mexico is in america , though . 
  fire ants for sure . 
  or ants on fire . 
  that corner was specifically made so you can thump your thumb . 
  how gore-y is this ? 
  `` act natural , jimmy . 
  act natural . '', 
  do n't throw-in goals count if nobody touched the ball ? 
  that 's a common name . 
  at least in mexico . 
  tldr , blue color is captured first , followed by green , and then red , right ? 
  i knew where this would go . 
  so this would count as an og ? 
  i wonder how the fuck do some hurricanes go so far inland . 
  yeah , i think i did not express myself correctly . 
  my bad . 
  got ta agree . 
  however , bob-omb is much better defensive now . 
  in previous games , if you used it to block a shell , the explosion would engulf you . 
  now it does n't . 
  still , i have avoided so many bob-ombs in mk8 that i would have not in mkw . 
  so satisfying . 
  where was this originally from ? 
  the blue part looks like a [ tennis court ] ( http://www.mateflex.com/assets/courts/_resampled/croppedimage1200533-web7.jpg ) . 
  `` did i pack this ? 
  idk , better pack it again . '', 
  the delivery version of saving twice . 
  i do n't see any [ shelmet ] ( https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/f/f6/616shelmet.png/250px-616shelmet.png ) there . 
  hairnado . 
  if only there were a sub for that . 
  that 's because many of hillary supporters support her policies , instead of her . 
  trump supporters could n't care less if trump spits on them . 
  they 'll still love him . 
  well played . 
  x 'd, 
  this has to be a joke or something . 
  i ca n't even take him seriously being next to that guy , and specially with that tone . 
  thank you , stranger . 
  you do n't understand . 
  the shopkeeper ( ? ), 
  was sick . 
  it 's for [ mario kart ] ( http://www.abload.de/res/imgs/403.gif ) . 
  sine when are fb comments in bubbles ? 
  i hate to agree with you in this . 
  we have 3 options here :, 
  trying to negotiate with the us fully knowing that there 's absolutely nothing to discuss with the current administration as we 're still gon na be seen as the evil ones , so we just have to suffer the consequences . 
  go full fuck you , and ending relationships with the us . 
  mexico has already tried to comply with us ' goals , but there 's only so much we can tolerate . 
  wait for an us administration that acknowledges that we do have problems too , and considers both sides . 
  pepsi ? 
  or is it a bike shaped dog rack ? 
  now we need a bike shaped dog rack . 
  dddddddddddddddddd :, 
  i think the only company that still focuses on local multiplayer is nintendo . 
  it 's not . 
  puzzles are supposed to be solved . 
  this just has different `` stages '' . 
  [ these ] ( http://img.dxcdn.com/productimages/sku_199442_1.jpg ) are puzzles . 
  you have to bring a loose object to the other end or remove it altogether , but it is very difficult to do so . 
  the more you know ... 
  i love how the person on top is like `` there you go buddy '' . 
  * bamboozling intensifies *, 
  i imagine women would have a hard time plant seeds that way . 
  someone edit this so he takes flight just like an airplane . 
  this is sad , because i was not allowed to vote in the 2016 national us elections . 
  tbh , when i watched the gif of kirby in rainbow road , i expected a kar ro be revealed , not rosalina in smash . 
  in my mind i heard the `` a new record ! '', 
  voice from super smash bros. . melee . 
  is this religion or a cult ?
