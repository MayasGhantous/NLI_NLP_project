  do you guys in the us just call baja california as * baja * ? 
  so is there a county called * baja * in california ? 
  i 'm so confused right now . 
  yeah , it 's baja california norte and baja california sur . 
  baja california norte is often referred to as baja california , and bcs is still baja california sur . 
  it makes sense since it 's south of california . 
  so , from north to south we have the following :, 
  california, 
  baja california norte, 
  baja california sur, 
  wtf , that 's my cousin 's name .

  i swear , the us puts more us on things in the us than any country that 's not the us ever does . 
  i do n't know of any place called baja , so unless that place is really popular for us citizens , and unknown to mexicans , i 'd say it 's referring to bc . 
  is r/mapswithouticeland a thing ? 
  if you press + after the race is over , you can save the highlight . 
  it wo n't disappear unless you unmark it . 
  even if you do n't save it at the moment , you can still play 11 games and watch the replay in mktv and mark it as favorite .

  you can save up to 6 races .

  i like bone-dry ruins ' theme , but i suck so much there . 
  i never use the ttc shortcut at the end , because i know i wo n't make it . 
  i do n't think i 'm bad in that course , just that i hate the theme and the pendulums that break my jumps . 
  i hate the pendulums a little less now .
