  what is a seeder ? 
  sorry , it 's over . 
  besides , it 's past 12 . 
  this one always cracks me up . 
  war of the worlds . 
  well , mexico city was built on top of a lake . 
  how 's that ? 
  i do n't like r66 in any way , if you ask me . 
  i love volskaya , but do n't like hanamura much . 
  king 's row is great , and it often brings up great teamfights . 
  once i was on attack in mystery heroes . 
  i defended the payload in overtime as mei for exactly 1:30 minutes , and we spent like 5 minutes fighting it . 
  so far it has been the most intense game i 've been in , and both teams were speaking about it . 
  in the end we lost , but was very fun . 
  i do n't like it , but i do n't despise it either . 
  100 % mexican sterotype if you ask me . 
  not that it 's bad or anything , just not to my liking . 
  i remember when i was new in the game ( and matched with new people too ) , we were confused because the control pointed exactly to the well , so what did we do ? 
  everyone down the well !, 
  it was funny watching everyone fall down just like lemmings , one after another . 
  x 'd, 
  and even after that , he still needs healing . 
  i would be surprised if mercy turned reyes into reaper . 
  i do n't know if she 's supposed to know reyes ' real identity , but the interactions between them makes me think she did n't do anything to him . 
  -- what happened to you !? 
  -- you tell me , doc . 
  i may not be the best to say this , as i started playing ow since winter , after or during sombra 's release , but i absolutely love her . 
  i do n't use her much , but i like her personality and i think her design is actually good ( except for some skins ) . 
  i think you ca n't report him . 
  maybe . 
  mercy 's interaction makes me think she did n't do anything to him , but knew him beforehand , so she think that 's an extreme change . 
  however , many of these before-after interactions with reaper are not cannon . 
  reaper 's reaction makes me think something went bad and either he thinks it was mercy 's fault or she should know what happened to him .
