  regardless , if he was disfigured , i do n't think mercy would recognize it was reyes if she was saving him . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , when you click the button , it displays a message that you ca n't report that person . 
  i laughed as this was was my first thought ; however , i am not happy about this . 
  i remember i saw that on facebook , and tried reporting him getting an error message . 
  but yes , they might have changed it so he can be reported . 
  probably someone else did the hard work for you . 
  5/5 visited my town . 
  very friendly . 
  so far i have n't bought any lootbox . 
  i did n't expect to be so unlucky during the uprising event , considering i got almost all skins during the chinese new year . 
  i only got two skins ( both were for widow , which i do n't even use ) , and i had to buy mercy 's skin . 
  i was close from buying a second one . 
  that 's zordon . 
  is n't that supposed to look like a person , anyway ? 
  i do n't play zarya much , but i got that achievement . 
  it 's kinda easy when both teams are fighting each other constantly . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , that was the game in which i got a 75 % average charge . 
  i do n't play zarya much , but i got that achievement .

  [ me checking the list of religions ] ( https://i0.wp.com/www.recreoviral.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/17.3.gif ), 
  in all seriousness , i do n't like religions in the slightest , but i do n't mind people who are religious as long as they do n't impose their views on others or do stupid things like preventing their children from getting vaccines or medicine , or stuff like that . 
  also , i find some religions interesting as works of fiction . 
  i loved \u014ckami , never alone and life of pi , even though i believe nothing that happens there . 
  be a dick with those deserving . 
  i hate it when people do n't explain things . 
  when i asked something about religion , the top answer was `` because it is god 's will '' . 
  i never took that as a proper answer , and it pissed me off so much . 
  it made no sense to me , so i never believed in any god . 
  i am not sure there are no gods , and i am pretty confident i will not have an answer for that in my lifetime ; however , i am very confident that none of the current mainstream religions are true . 
  there may be one or two hypothesis out there that might be close , but nobody has any way to verify or refute them . 
  in any case , i do n't have any need to worship something when i 'm not even sure if everything we know exists was made by some being or not . 
  besides , if we 're a simulation or something similar , i would n't be surprised if they are unaware of our existence . 
  after all , scientists do n't get mad when the bacteria in their petri dish do n't worship them . 
  it does n't . 
  scary movies , games and that kind of stuff scare the shit out of me , even if i do n't believe in any of that stuff . 
  my hypothesis is that i get scared because when i watch a movie or play a game , i am so into it , that whatever happens , i feel it as if it were happening in real life , even when i know it is not . 
  when i was a kid , we watched war of the worlds at school . 
  it did n't scare me much watching it , but after the movie was over , i felt so weird ... on the bus back home , i imagined those big monsters walking at the horizon . 
  i had a lot of troubles sleeping . 
  also , i loved contra , and i could play it as a normal game . 
  i just pressed the back buttons , then start and had 30 lives . 
  i could defeat all bosses , and i was fine ; however , my parents say i had nightmares for playing contra . 
  i do n't recall any of that . 
  screamers scare the living shit out of me , and there are a few things i hate more than screamers . 
  maybe pop-ups with sound come close . 
  gnostic would be for people who are sure their position is true . 
  whether it is people who are 100 % sure god , allah , buddha or other gods exist , or people who are 100 % sure none of these exist . 
  it depends . 
  sometimes i go to work . 
  sometimes i go to a friend 's house . 
  sometimes i spend the day with my aunt . 
  also , sometimes i spend the day playing overwatch . 
  i do n't have a set schedule . 
  let me turn this around a bit . 
  if there were no bible or you were free to do whatever you wanted for , let 's say , a month , would you kill , steal or do anything like that ? 
  i know . 
  i loved it , even with all the religious context . 
  i had to watch madoka a couple of times to understand what was going on . 
  everything ? 
  in mexico we give little thought to what happens outside america ( continent ) , so most of us actually know little about germany . 
  anyway , i have heard germany is peaceful . 
  is it true , and what do you think are the factors behind it ? 
  probably anything illegal . 
  i choose freedom . 
  thanks , but no thanks . 
  hey , that 's more than what someone in mexico gets in an 8 hour shift under minimum wage . 
  the government thinks that 's enough , so i do n't think why it would n't be possible . 
  * get paid in advance . 
  * get yourself a super-armor . 
  * end up the battle with small scratches . 
  * get better armor , and end up beating the bear . 
  have a nice day !, 
  it 'll never go back to the surface . 
  reminds me of [ lunar pool ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lunar_pool ) . 
  i loved that game when i was young . 
  i do n't know what you 're seeing , but definitely i 'm not seeing it . 
  body paint that makes her look like a parrot . 
  i do n't know . 
  looks pretty unintentional to me . 
  dementdoor . 
  [ here ] ( https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mdzps8rojxe/tnx7ufqbaii/aaaaaaaab9m/xdfxpwybvpa/s1600/gnostic_agnostic_atheist.png ) is a chart explaining it . 
  i 'd just change `` god '' and `` gods '' to `` god '' and `` gods '' , as they 're not proper names . 
  in this case , * god * is referring to the abrahamic god . 
  * allah * is referring to the islamic god . 
  * god * is just referring to a god without specifying which . 
  now i see it . 
  r/skyporn or r/earthporn ? 
  vote now !, 
  i do n't know if tap water is safe here in m\u00e9xico , but i do n't drink it , because i prefer the taste of a specific brand . 
  actually , d.va was `` deactivated '' everywhere , not only competitive . 
  would they ban if it 's used in skirmish or while waiting for more players to join the game ? 
  i have n't done that in skirmish , but i was just wondering . 
  `` where the fuck are you even ? '', 
  killed me . 
  now , that one should be bigger . 
  also , as a mercy main the `` you realize i also have cooldowns , right ? '', 
  would change to `` wait a sec '' or `` i 'm hiding . 
  everyone go die so i can rez you '' . 
  archer hurt itself in its confusion . 
  like a baby looking at you .
