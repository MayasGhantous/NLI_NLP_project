  the other one is called baguette . 
  well , if that 's your kink ... 
  no shit . 
  from 0 to 10 , peanut butter . 
  but he is a great businessman . 
  his sins do n't matter because he will make america great again !, 
  i do n't know how , but he will do it !, 
  this pic does n't need photoshop . 
  it is perfect already . 
  at least it is n't slsl aeae . 
  damn . 
  now i think instead of naming sandwich my cat , i should have named him vantablack . 
  thinking it 's high noon when actually it 's bedtime . 
  roadhog can now wallride . 
  * we felt roadhog was n't sick enough , so we gave him the ability to roll around the walls to intimidate *, 
  why i main mercy : i guess someone has to support . 
  same here . 
  96 % of the times i end up playing mercy , reinhardt , l\u00facio or orisa . 
  for the remaining 4 % i play mei or pharah . 
  wait , do n't you just buy the game and get to play forever ^ forever ^ forever ^ forever ^ forever ^ forever ? 
  i like her too ; however , sometimes i get bored nobody needs healing so i just start shooting . 
  sometimes i hit someone in the head and i 'm all like : hell yeah !, 
  i 'm unstoppable !, 
  i imagine rezzing environmental kills something like this :, 
  * mercy revives 2 people who fell off the cliff and are revived at the edge of it *, 
  * they back off and fall *, 
  i expected orisa 's shield to protect someone and i was ready to say `` nah , it 's just uncommon . 
  '' , but i was not expecting that . 
  now that is very rare . 
  some american countries have already tried separating church from state . 
  mexico already tried that when benito ju\u00e1rez was president in 1859 by abolishing monastic orders . 
  in 1926 , the president plutarco el\u00edas calles enacted a similar law ; however , the law was unsuccessful and the [ cristero war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cristero_war ) began . 
  [ ^ [ 1 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/separation_of_church_and_state#mexico ), 
  also , apparently brazil was successful in the separation of state and church . 
  [ ^ [ 2 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/separation_of_church_and_state#brazil ), 
  i searched for maps or lists searching how other american countries were doing , but i could n't find more info . 
  every damn vacation season i see trash all over the beach in mazatl\u00e1n , sinaloa . 
  apparently most people do n't know what the trash can is for . 
  if you and your parents are comfortable with it , and you are helping them in some way , i do n't see why living with your parents is not okay . 
  to be honest , i ** loved ** finding dory . 
  finding nemo was an okay movie to me , but i think finding dory was better . 
  just personal opinion . 
  i have a friend who did n't like it . 
  okay . 
  most of the times when someone says that x fanbase is the worst , i am just like `` yeah , whatever '' since i know most of them just follow trends ; however , i do agree that most of the sonic fanbase is just horrible . 
  i love sonic the hedgehog series , but whenever i see some ocs i just cringe . 
  now the sonic team will give them what they want with sonic forces . 
  on the other hand , i think sonic social media accounts are hilarious . 
  i think that blue amy looks cute . 
  * shrugs *, 
  i just did n't like bismuth . 
  she was so ... meh to me . 
  it 's ironic , because say that as an insult , but dota is way more difficult to play . 
  source : i 've played both games . 
  mother teresa received lots of money for her `` charities '' ; however , she was friend of poverty , not friend of the poor , which meant she left the poor to die miserably just as jesus . 
  she may have thought she did the right thing , but she actually did n't . 
  [ ^ [ 1 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/criticism_of_mother_teresa ), 
  the person in the middle dressed as a dragon makes it even better . 
  once i had like a quad rez , then i hear ** fire in the hole ! ** . 
  all i thought was ** god fucking damn it , junkrat ** . 
  we all died again . 
  i thought this was intended . 
  are you serious ? 
  the healing and speed songs are changed ? 
  that 's cool . 
  that would be really cool . 
  not only for mccree , but for everyone . 
  imagine everyone jumping around and pharah like `` why the fuck are all of you up here ? 
  came to comment that . 
  i guess you won . 
  in any case , some people think that `` their ignorance is as valid as my knowledge '' on the topics being discussed . 
  that 's also contradictory . 
  whoever says that is basically saying : i have the right to give my opinion , but you do n't because i spoke first . '', 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3mujff/alright_keep_your_eye_on_the_ball/ ) cracks me up all the time . 
  me when i heard that phrase for the first time :, 
  zen : a warrior 's greatest weapon ... 
  me : what ? 
  is this a cliffhanger or what !? 
  me : what is it , then ? 
  zen : ... is patience . 
  me : oh my god . 
  tell me about it . 
  during uprising all i got were the same skin twice for widow ( which i do n't use ) and orisa 's skin which is awful . 
  i had to buy mercy 's skin and was 100 gold shy of another skin . 
  so it was n't just me . 
  i got 3 whites and a blue . 
  same here . 
  i guess we just need practice . 
  up next : trump tries to pull this move on putin , but putin ends up with a suplex on trump . 
  just like my cats . 
  baguette gets near me so i hug her and kiss her . 
  she 's just like `` no , stop it ! '' . 
  a minute later she 's back again . 
  oh , if only they knew what food is . 
  * ** nhl : ** i did n't know what nhl was . 
  i figured it would be hockey due to the h there . 
  hockey is not popular here . 
  * ** nfl : ** it is not popular , but some people do like the nfl . 
  most people only watch the super bowl . 
  that 's about it .
