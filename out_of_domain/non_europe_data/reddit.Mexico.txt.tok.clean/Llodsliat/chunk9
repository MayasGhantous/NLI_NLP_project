  * ** mlb : ** i am sinaloense , and mlb is almost as popular as lmb ( liga mexicana de b\u00e9isbol ) . 
  base ball is pretty damn popular in the northern states , and is not unpopular in the capital . 
  not sure about the southern states . 
  * ** nba : ** a couple of people like basket ball . 
  i 'd say it 's not popular , but it 's not uncommon either . 
  i have lived in sinaloa , guerrero , ciudad de m\u00e9xico , estado de m\u00e9xico and jalisco . 
  actually , m\u00e9xico does have castles . 
  a few , but there are . 
  i have posted an answer on the topic [ here ] ( https://www.quora.com/what-are-some-beautiful-castles-from-your-country/answer/edgar-elenes?srid=udvh1 ) . 
  mexican here . 
  i do n't know much about us states , but i do know that what they try to portray as winsconsin is actually michigan . 
  it totally looks like a misshapen flour tortilla . 
  i thought they were tightly packed worm chips ( or however they 're called , idk ) . 
  i thought it was a river connecting to the sea . 
  over these last two years , i have seen more and more mexican states allow same-sex marriage . 
  i do n't know why the whole country is dark blue already . 
  by the way , the link you posted is for mobile . 
  you might want to check that . 
  most pages automatically redirect to mobile when using one , but almost none redirect to desktop when viewed in a computer . 
  i 've lived in m\u00e9xico , and mostly rural areas are catholic . 
  urban areas not much . 
  besides , here in m\u00e9xico people are not homophobic due to religion . 
  people are homophobic due to culture . 
  do n't get me wrong , we tend to laugh at * everything * . 
  we make jokes between each other , and it is not uncommon to use the words * puto * or * marica * ( slang for gay ) as synonyms of coward . 
  however , what i have noticed is that when people encounter real gays , they are not as badly judged as you 'd think . 
  most people are easygoing and do n't care if you are gay or not as long as you are not actually trying to seduce them or something . 
  both are true . 
  have you ? 
  is n't that the other way around ? 
  dude i even witnessed a quadruple car crash at 20 km/h just because one of the cars did n't brake in time . 
  probably nobody was harmed ( a couple head bumps for sure , though ) , but nothing serious . 
  only to women and children . 
  you get two if you 're both . 
  my uncle sent a photo of his newborn kid in the familiar group , and i was like :, 
   no thanks . 
  shower him first at least . 
  [ this ] ( https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xft1/t51.2885-15/e35/12407404_202633223415705_1404617533_n.jpg ) is the least jpgish pic i could find . 
  then upload it to facebook and let the cycle begin anew . 
  humorless dark . 
  `` free loot , i guess ... '', 
  not the bees !, 
  similar . 
  the only event item was zen 's voiceline :, 
   how disappointing, 
  well , i did n't know that . 
  it should help , but most probably it does n't . 
  most people here do n't care about those kind of things . 
  i think the current title is perfect . 
  yeah . 
  i am so glad it 's back . 
  i only got to play it once or twice when it was in the random game-mode pool . 
  zarya is still op , if you ask me . 
  those good noob days . 
  the thing i most remember that happened to me when i was a noob is when the capture point in ilios pointed directly to the well . 
  about four of us ran into the well , one after another , falling to our deaths because we did n't know it was actually a death pit . 
  all i 've gotten is the `` how disappointing '' voice-line . 
  to be honest , i am disappointed and not disappointed about that . 
  schr\u00f6dinger 's lootbox if you will . 
  the `` how disappointing '' voice-line would have made this gif the best ( or worst ) of the whole event . 
  i think it gives that warning when you 're tethered to mercy too . 
  in all honesty , the tether should break or not allow mercy to tether sombra when she is invisible . 
  * porque * is the equivalent to * because * in english . 
  * por qu\u00e9 * is the equivalent to * why * . 
  those amen chains are the worst . 
  those people deserve [ this ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/v0diyavje9fye/giphy.gif ) . 
  such a wonderful game . 
  i wonder why it 's the worst selling game awarded with a goty . 
   \u014ckami was one of the last playstation 2 games selected for release prior to the release of the playstation 3 . 
  although it suffered from poor sales , the game received critical acclaim , earning the title of ign 's 2006 game of the year . 
  mainstream adoption of the game has improved with age , and \u014ckami is now considered to be one of the best video games ever made , as well as a prime example of artistic expression in video games . 
  in all honesty , i prefer to carry around my ipod nano than my 5 '' phone . 
  being able to focus in important stuff . 
  everyday can be taco day if you 're mexican . 
  salad . 
  it can be anything basically . 
  use some lettuce , add a couple of fruits and you have fruit salad . 
  add beef , chicken or whatever you want and still can be considered a salad . 
  not that i remember . 
  got ta test it . 
  implying america is a country and not a continent . 
  geckos seem to be pretty common in hot regions . 
  i see plenty of them in mazatl\u00e1n , sinaloa , but only a handful in estado de m\u00e9xico or guadalajara , jalisco where the climate is colder . 
  i guess google or bing translator is not helping . 
  it can be used that way in spanish , but it usually comes with some context first . 
   if you get near sombra you can see her because ... ? 
  it can be used as a question , i guess , but it usually is a question stated as a sentence that another person needs to complete . 
  trump will most likely discard it later . 
  if it 's not brief or in television , he 's most likely not interested . 
  yeah , but at the expense of the journalists ' safety . 
  `` i prefer enemies that have n't been captured . '', 
  -- trump when asked about isis, 
  what do you mean ? 
  well , i guess i 'm missing one too for not understanding the joke . 
  how, 
  which building ? 
  yeah , but you do n't always attribute incoherence with brain damage . 
  you could just attribute it with trump being dumb . 
  donald trump confirmed as cleverbot . 
  mexican grandmas are like :,
