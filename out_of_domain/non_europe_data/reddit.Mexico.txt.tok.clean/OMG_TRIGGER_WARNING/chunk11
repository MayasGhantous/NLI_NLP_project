  depends where you are , perfectly legal , if unethical , in plenty of places, 
  if the son of the milf you are fucking is half your age but one third of hers , then how old is she ? 
  i do n't remember ever posting there and i 'm banned, 
  weird that someone from the most oversensitive place on the internet is mocking others for being annoyed, 
   i ca n't say that legalized prostitution pre-empts human trafficking . 
  but that 's not the question i 'm making , i ` mm asking if legal prostitution causes human trafficking, 
  `` you 're moma told me your a faget '' is widely accepted as a grammatically correct insult . 
  did you mean like pick up chicks at bars ? 
  or did you actually expect the military to have lots of women ? 
  pfff i click mouse wheel to close tabs , you pleb, 
   he was ordered to pay child support and alimony but the cancer took all of his money, 
  i. . . i would have never expected that i would have smiled at this sentence, 
  basically the guy goes from website to website posting his rants until he 's banned from the place, 
  seems more like whining about fat jokes and mean humor to me, 
  testudo i believe, 
  were n't sarmatian mercenary cavalrymen used by roman armies ? 
   i do n't feel like accepting hollow apologies just so that they can feel like they 're great people or doing me a favor . 
  i was bullied too , not to the extent that you were , but this is exactly the way i feel, 
  why not get a permanent laser shave there ? 
  not having your tribe be officially recognized is nowhere near the discrimination and powerlessness that indigenous mexicans face , it 's like you 're complaining about first world indigenous problems here, 
  cort\u00e9s and his ** native allies **, 
   the problem is their government ,, 
  no , the problem is the mexican people at large that foster a culture of corruption, 
  ahh , so you are * that guy *, 
  jesus , i 'm a 6 ' tall man that weighs a little under that and i 'm considered big , i ca n't imagine a woman weighing that, 
  and the kid is 9 , not 3 years old, 
  good guy municipal water supplier does have a ring to it though, 
  i 've noticed that there are certain kinds of people who intentionally make themselves look stupid for attention , i do n't understand them, 
  ftfy, 
  yes , my older brother would have never done that, 
  * lol *, 
  add to that the cartoon like scenario and broken english in the responses ( he does n't even sound australian ) , moreover the proof looks like something one could write on his own . 
   not all australians have decent spelling and grammar, 
  the thing is , grammar mistakes committed by native speakers are usually the result of confusing homophones ( your = you 're , their = there , etc ) , op 's grammar mistakes seem to imply an ignorance of the structure of the language , it could be that he is indeed australian , but the hints that he 's lying just keep adding up ( the proof is n't really a good proof , the scenario sounds unrealistic , he mentions blacks despite black people being rather rare in australia , reddit has a history of having people make up threads about rape , etc ), 
   a ridiculously oversimplified or stereotypical representation, 
  yeah , i started reading his comment history and it turns out this is like the third time he 's posted this ama , in one of his amas he claims to not be an native speaker , however there are further inconsistencies when you read his previous threads ( in one he claims it was 4 people who were in the gang rape , in others it was 3 ) and his proof for the ama mentions new south wales *** of *** australia ( instead of new south wales australia ) and also spells `` authori *** z *** ed '' instead of authorised ( which would be the correct spelling in australia ), 
   only that the language thing is n't a legitimate reason why it would n't be, 
  i never claimed that it would be , just said that small things add up, 
   as for everything else , unless someone knows what that document should actually look like , it 's hard to make a definitive call . 
  australians spell differently from americans , and seeing an american spelling in an aussie document is a huge red flag ( again compounded by the other suspicious things ) , also , someone else made this post : http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/tvqdr/iama_male_who_had_been_raped_by_other_male_in/c4q5i7e, 
  check the post i linked, 
  i 'm more worried about a scam, 
   i knew a guy who, 
  no you do n't , what 's the point of making shit up on the internet ? 
  cockroaches, 
  oh come on , there are probably kebabs in any major city with turks in this world, 
  pyongyang looks so depressing , i imagine the weather is perpetually misty/cloudy, 
  do n't you think it 's a little unethical to spread half truths ? 
  so motherfucking brave, 
  yeah , i had thought of that , probably i 'll do that, 
   tailoring makes clothes fit better , not reshape them totally . 
  so , in the case of the pants with wrong cut it does n't make sense , but in the case of oversized pants it would ? 
  it 's an initialism, 
  you 're retarded , for a non-native english speaker english and scottish accents are difficult to distinguish , can you differentiate between colombian and venezuelan spanish ? 
  i honestly thought the first one was a fat shirtless guy , you know , maybe some heavy-metal singer or whatever, 
  when you are n't a native all non-american accents sound english , i know that 's pretty much my first assumption too, 
  i 've been the one instigating coward bullies to fight me before , so i do n't think that instigating means that he 's a bully, 
  bah this is getting tiresome , you 're retarded , i 'm retarded , he 's retarded , wan na be friends ? 
  get a strap on ? 
  i do n't get why some men complain about pussy eating , i mean , if it 's clean what 's bad about it ? 
  i know you 're being sarcastic , but i honestly do n't see anything wrong with what you said, 
  i hate it when people ask why they tagged someone , but i have to ask : what the hell did you do that i had to tag you as `` will eat a hat '' ? 
  did you make a bet that you 'll eat a hat if x happens ? 
  if so have you eaten the hat ? 
  until one of them met `` msbeta1421 '' ... 
  you do n't have to take `` sexiest '' so literally, 
   which i just thought it was n't . 
  fair enough , and i agree, 
  facebook is serious business, 
   also , what does `` date rape '' mean ? 
  she was n't dating this guy ... 
  date rape is a term used for raping a severely intoxicated person ( not just drunk , but someone so drunk that they ca n't consent ), 
  yes there is , consent is a gray area, 
  i was going to post a reply to that mongoloid , but you made a much better comment . 
  humidity also plays a role , as cloudy places have less sunlight, 
  i saw this movie when i was 8 ( i think ) and even then this bothered me, 
   stop thinking with your dick, 
  tbh they are on [ / r/gonewild ] ( / r/gonewild ) , however i agree with the rest of what you said, 
  is it fucking up your life ? 
  are you embarrassing yourself on a constant basis ? 
  is your job being affected by it ? 
  are your relationships being affected by it ? 
  my mom worked as a secretary for my dad , he asked her out , not really interesting , i think both of them are good looking but my mom is taller, 
  perhaps you 're narcissistic ? 
  or you simply do n't give a shit about her ? 
  hard to tell then , there 's no clear definition of an alcoholic , still , be careful, 
  with a name like that you do n't need a nickname , however you could call him no-lubitz, 
  [ proof ] ye cunt, 
  superheroines . 
  ever . 
  and so is broseph brosephus who got his because it means `` strength and wisdom '', 
  i object to this jokes on the basis that they are trite and overused , but not the offensiveness, 
  some soccer hooligans in my town stole from a mini-market and justified it by saying that they were sticking it to the man , truly pathetic people, 
  we have [ / r/conspiratard ] ( / r/conspiratard ), 
  we have beto y enrique in mexico ... 
  perhaps he means in the sense that their parents are n't the ones doing the choosing ? 
  as in , no more arranged marriages ( at least for most of the developed world ) ? 
  i 'm pissed off about being told the conflicting message that men are both lagging behind and oppressing women, 
  it 's a form of poisoning the well by mentioning a controversial idea without explicitly stating it, 
  i 'm aware of that , i 'm just annoyed by the conflicting narrative that says that men are both privileged and under performing at the same time,
