  but the reason men do n't care about , say , women 's soccer or women 's rugby is because they are objectively ( women are shorter , weaker , and slower ) worse at those sports , nothing to do with sexism . 
  [ here 's another feminist site doing that ] ( http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:7ssog1sjlpcj:jezebel.com/thighlights/+http://jezebel.com/thighlights/&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;client=opera ) , bunch of hypocrites,

  oh god yes yes !, 
  it 's a fantastic film , i love you doctor cazares ; _ ;, 
   i do n't see the problem with that if they are playing women vs women . 
  ever watched youth sport or minor league sports ? 
  even if they are playing against people of their same category they are boring matches as the players are slower , shorter , weaker and less skilled , [ skilled players are more entertaining ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bze1tqf7sio ), 
   i think you are making assumptions about women 's sports without actually spent a good chunk of time viewing it . 
  i actually have , i 've watched female soccer and rugby matches , players are clumsier , slower , and weaker , you get silly mistakes all the time and not many spectacular goals or tackles ; do n't get me wrong , there are sports were females can have an exciting performance despite strength differences , but there are many where the femaqle version is simply not as good . 
   but if anyone appreciates them at all , it 's first and foremost because they 're hot, 
  yesterday mexico , my country , won her second silver medal in synchronized diving for women , i have n't read or heard a single comment regarding their looks , sportswomen like [ ana guevara ] ( https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=ana+guevara&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;channel=suggest&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=n&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=mgazupylnoo08ashiiggaw&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=645&amp;sei=nwazuplghosu8qsdjidqcw ) or [ soraya jim\u00e9nez ] ( https://www.google.com/search?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;channel=suggest&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=645&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=soraya+jimenez&amp;oq=soraya+jimenez&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i24l3j0i5i24.24683.30272.0.30610.16.15.1.0.0.0.327.1823.0j6j2j1.9.0...0.0...1c.wus4xzvtdls ) and many others are respected for their achievements , and no , mexico is n't some progressive feminist country . 
   also consider gymnastics where women arguably perform at the same level as men . 
  they do some different events but generally women 's gymnastics are more popular . 
  and even then you see people judging them first for their looks and second for their talent . 
  by whom ? 
  besides , [ it 's not like women do n't do that to men ] ( http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:7ssog1sjlpcj:jezebel.com/thighlights/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;client=opera ) , guys like david beckham or cristiano ronaldo are popular with women not for their talent , but for their looks .

   i used to be a huge asshole because everyone is stupid . 
  two years ago i decided to make a change . 
  being nice felt amazing . 
  then everyone started walking all over me and getting upset when i even remotely felt upset . 
  i completely empathize with this sentiment , i had a period in my life when i thought i could stop being bullied by being nicer , it only got much worse, 
  try the gallon of whole milk a day diet , gomad, 
  this was the part of your comment i was challenging :, 
   the fact of the matter is that it is more socially acceptable for a man to be skinny than for a woman to be fat and there is an obvious difference in the amount of hurt feelings generated by the comments . 
  it is not more socially acceptable if we 're talking about very skinny guys . 
  anyways , i do think op was socially insensitive but not an asshole ( provided that the woman in question was n't intentionally being mean , in such case then op did right ), 
   but also that no matter what if you are successful you are accepted . 
  definitely , men are judged more by their accomplishments ( and power and money ) , while women are judged more by their looks , but i think this is more of a men/women divide rather than an extremely skinny/fat divide, 
  huh ? 
  whenever i 'm in barcelona i speak in spanish all the time ( yes even with native catalans ) , never had the slightest problem, 
  it 's not like we 're calling for them to be beheaded or something,

   i 'm going to get downvoted because this subreddit is very set in their ways , but i 'm not going to let that fact browbeat me into not expressing my thoughts .

  make it an hoinest compliment that you do n't throw around, 
  not at all , while i do tease girls ( regardless of attraction ) i do n't do it because i 'm flirting , but because it 's my personality , and i 'll definitely not have overt physical contact with a woman i do n't find attractive ( i will of course , hug or kiss on the cheek but that 's it ), 
  do you get approached at clubs and bars ? 
  ( i 'm asking because if you are n't then it may mean that you either put an unapproachable vibe or are simply unattractive physically and it has nothing to with your personality ), 
  i consider srs to be full of hypocrites , let me explain you why : joking about serious matters like murder and violence are ok ( there are users there with names like `` killwhitey '' or glorification of people like valerie solanas and andrea dworkin ) but joking about rape is n't ( unless there 's someone out there with username like `` rape all men '' in that case i 'll admit being wrong ) . 
  male objectification is n't denounced in that place , take this thread : http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/xlbhk/so_we_rescued_this_pug_who_turned_out_to_be_very/, 
  there are comments by women calling for the guy to ate his shirt off and saying they want to grab his dick , why did n't it get posted to srs like every thread where a woman receives weird responses from redditors ? 
  [ why are n't mainstream feminist websites like jezebel denounced for doing the exact same thing males are criticized for ?

  i 'm circumcised and i honestly do n't know what to say since i have no memories of when i had a foreskin ( i was circumcised like two days after birth ) , according to what i 've read it seems that there is an important loss of sensitivity and anecdotally i do n't find sex/masturbation all that physically pleasurable ( but that could be due to any other reason ), 
  excuse me if i 'm misreading you , but if i understood your post correctly : a bunch of guys held you down , without you having given an indication of wanting or consenting to sex , and then they had sex with you ? 
  sounds like pretty clear case of rape and unless they are mentally deficient then they probably were aware of what they were doing . 
  i really like your jeans and shoes , but dislike both shirts ( i dislike both short sleeve button shirts and graphic tees ), 
  i find it interesting how the guy 's facebook is full of quotes about islam all the while the guy is scamming people, 
  he also seems to only be friends with hot women , the horny bastard, 
  no alternet links pls, 
  redditors seem a little overdramatic to me , it 's the same with the jollyrancher , cumbox and spacedicks , i mean , they 're gross and all , but people here tend to exaggerate, 
  but why did it happen ? 
  and how ? 
  where monarchs really that willing to renounce their power ? 
  in my experience it does n't feel good , feels awkward , but other guys seem to like it , you lose nothing by trying it .

  if you catch a heavy from behind you can kill him easily with an axtinguisher, 
  just like a guy is n't entitled to sex if he pays for dinner , a woman is n't entitled to a relationship just because she has sex with someone,
