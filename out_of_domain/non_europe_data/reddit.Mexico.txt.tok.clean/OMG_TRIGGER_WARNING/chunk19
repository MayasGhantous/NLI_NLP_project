   but theres endless amounts of people who think, 
  you think there are n't people who think sterilization is ok ? 
  people on this very website seriously advocate that ; you think that there are n't people here who have suffered crimes relating to genocide ( i 'm sure we have many redditors from the balkans here ) ? 
   it 's clear you have a bone to pick with srs, 
  i have a bone to pick with hypocrites , and i have called out in the past hypocrites with radically different ideologies to yours . 
   neither of us have anything to gain from this little exchange here . 
  i find it cathartic tbh . 
   actually i would n't because srs absolutely loathes joking about rape ,, 
  maybe i was n't clear , you would be posted on srs to be ** denounced ** for doing that , of course srs would n't approve , that was my point , if you write : `` redditors should be sterilized '' it 's ok , while `` redditors should be raped '' is n't . 
   nobody on reddit has suffered from ** rape ** for their use of reddit, 
  ftfy , is it now ok to call for redditors to be raped ? 
  please answer this . 
  that 's precisely my point !!, 
  according to srs i can say :, 
  redditors should be sterelized . 
  according to srs i ** ca n't ** say :, 
  redditors should be raped, 
  forget about anything we 've said so far , is it worse to say `` redditors should be ** raped ** '' than '' redditors should be ** sterelized ** ? 
  yes or no . 
  i was exaggerating a little , but yeah having a long button shirt untucked looks bad , though i would need to look at op 's back in order to know if it 's actually too long ( the angle is kind of tricky ), 
   yes, 
  why is rape worse than forced sterilization/genocide ? 
   they have always existed , but they were ridiculed on a mass scale . 
  and you are basing this statement on ... ? 
   but maybe we disagree on how long, 
  i think we had a misunderstanding as i agree with you on length of the shirt , in my original comment i was disagreeing with the notion that tucking your shirt made you look lame, 
   just that it looks lame at a bar, 
  ehh maybe this is a cultural difference , being tucked in at bars in spain and mexico is pretty common, 
  yeah , i was planning on beating the shit out of the next woman i saw , but then i remembered some guy running in heels and changed my mind . 
  was she a prostitute ? 
  or just a random girl ? 
  i hope that guy 's last moments were full of panic and horrible horrible pain, 
  please do n't link to gawker , it 's a website with absolutely scummy practices, 
  it 's mostly male white knights i believe, 
  the entirety of [ / r/adviceanimals ] ( / r/adviceanimals ) , [ / r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu ] ( / r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu ) , [ / r/atheism ] ( / r/atheism ) and how every fucking post on [ / r/movies ] ( / r/movies ) is a fucking image or some alternative movie poster . 
  i hate reddit politics , i hate reddit humor ( le bacon , le relevant username , etc ) , i 'm not a feminist but i hate the double standards by which women are judged here ( e.g. 
  [ compare the responses here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/vkm3m/ ) to [ the ones here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/vovs6/as_requested_iama_male_pi_whos_job_is_to_catch/ ) ) , i hate how redditors will jump to hit one any semi attractive woman that shows her face here , etc, 
  goddamnit i live two hours away from there and instead of buying those i got a pair for double the price from dockers, 
   as a marine, 
  why was this even relevant ? 
   a ) it has pervaded our lives much more , especially those who will ( presumably ) have real jobs and income in 5-10 years . 
   b ) facebook has a large and growing engineering department working on fixing these issues and making new features . 
  ca n't this also be applied to myspace and yahoo ( and pretty much any other former giant of the internet ) ? 
  i 'm mexican and my mom started ranting about the mexican american war when we were in the alamo,

  i know and it 's a nice way of seeing it , i just wanted to rant a bit,

  huh ? 
  he got an ax to the head , what 's so unusual about it ? 
  what the hell was the guy even thinking when he came back ?

  well new zealand is close to austria, 
  i can absolutely relate , but tbh , at this age and now that i have some self respect i do n't actually want to be close to my brother , he 's a cunt, 
  i 'm a native spanish speaker and neither makes sense to me , can you show the whole sentences ? 
  yeah , 100 daily points a day should also almost complete the course, 
  i believe that the first sentence refers to exchange rates ( maybe the price of the shoes in question is originally in dollars ) , it still sounds weird , in the second one it 's using spanish ( from spain ) slang to say : `` so what ( about it ) ? 
  do you like them ? '', 
  ca n't all that rain in the uk be collected into drinking water ? 
   these girls do n't live to aesthetically please you ( or anyone else ) . 
  of course , but then do n't bitch in about how nobody finds that attractive, 
  i never try separating fights , it 's usually pointless , if you think someone is going to get hurt just call the police, 
   please put it to good use, 
  he should become a novelty account, 
  why not just break up with your girlfriend ? 
   she teases me about it occasionally . 
  what kind of lame teasing is that ? 
  `` haha you fucked the brains out of my friend !, 
  how shameful '', 
  do n't laugh at her , she 's both retarded and crippled, 
  sure , just saying that her sense of humor is , well , odd, 
  glad to know i 'm not the only one who uses srs for that purpose, 
  you look like a boy not because of your physique but because of your haircut/clothes, 
  from your link :, 
   2.4 -- 7.5 million ( scholarly estimates ), 
   4.5 million , 10 million ( some claims ), 
  from here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holocaust, 
   using this definition , the total number of holocaust victims is between 11 million and 17 million people . 
   the protecting the settlement was mainly the reason given to the public . 
  hat 's precisely the point he was making, 
  [ yep , look at these slow bloated meat-heads ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02301/usain-bolt_r_2301628b.jpg ), 
  sadly being put down is a better alternative to being constantly raped, 
  they are n't even kitties , just people posting their fucking average cats , 4/10 would not pet,
