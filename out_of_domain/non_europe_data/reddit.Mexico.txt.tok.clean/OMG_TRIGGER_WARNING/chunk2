  i was about to call you an idiot but then i read your username, 
  sounds rather idiotic, 
  it 's only socialism when other people do it . 
  just do n't fap for a while and you 'll get one , they 're awesome, 
  i can smell mine too , maybe tunnelsnakesrule and me should date ? 
  i dunno i 've managed to keep my `` suicide attempt '' a secret for 12 years so either you 're wrong or my parents do n't give a shit . 
  the chosen one, 
   i could do the `` relevant username ? '', 
  think but that would be indecent . 
  i would n't care , i 've got pretty thick skin , and my username itself is a mockery of oversensitiveness in certain feminist blogs ( a trigger warning is supposed to be a warning that what people will read may `` trigger '' bad feelings ), 
   why keep it a secret , and what saved you ? 
  i have n't found a reason to bring it up , i think it would upset them and i feel like i 'm over it so i see no need for doing it . 
   and what saved you ? 
  well i was eight years old and intentionally ( as in i knew what death was and i wanted some of it ) attempted to overdose on the first bottle i could find inside my bathroom 's cabinet , being 8 it 's not like i knew much about how to kill myself so yeah i ended up drinking eye or ear medicine ( wololol ) i do n't remember . 
  as to what saved me from trying later in my life , as a fifteen year old i , again , had serious suicidal thoughts along with some actual plans ( i was going to jump off an overpass into incoming traffic ) , i did n't go through them after some philosophizing and realizing that , if you do n't care about dying , then you have nothing to lose ( something funny happened exactly the day i realized that , but it 's so absurd you 'll think i 'm making shit up , but ask and i 'll tell ), 
   of course , do n't answer if you 're uncomfortable with it . 
  no worries , ask away if there 's anything else you would like to know . 
  could be , though i do n't doubt that they love me , they never really interfered much in my life e.g. 
  i honestly ca n't remember ever being punished for something , getting a stern talking for getting bad grades , or anything like that . 
  loved it, 
  i 'm far from an attention whore , i 'm more of an introvert person so i do n't really like/want attention . 
  i was coming out of the hospital after my routine recovery therapy for an injury i had and a car going backwards drove over me while i was sitting waiting for my mom . 
  there is a difference between smiling to a kid or giving him a popsicle and taking him away from kindergarten under false pretenses . 
  it 's sort of like repeating what your opponent just said but in a retarded voice so that they sound like idiots, 
  i dunno , i mean i just start mine , go take a piss and come back and it 's already booted what kind of potato are you running ? 
   by boot i mean `` ready to use '' , not just at the log in prompt ,, 
  i meant the same thing , it takes me seconds to get to the login prompt and then a minute or two to fully boot , though maybe it 's because my laptop is like 6 months old . 
   stuff like mcafee antivirus , norton backup , sage . 
  why the hell would they do that ? 
   when you were 8 did you attempt it because you were curious , or whatever 8-year-olds think , or because you could n't stand life any more ? 
  8 is a terrible age for the latter to happen . 
  the latter , and yeah i 'm fine now , i mean i 've had anxiety issues my whole life , but ever since i 've been living on my own i 've started to improve , at the moment i 'm pretty normal . 
  is the tournament supposed to be high level ? 
  i have around 350 hours of tf2 so i really do n't know if i could be up to par, 
  edit : i also have never played competitive, 
   ( the getting better after living on my own , of course ), 
  becoming self-reliant is a great self-esteem booster , good luck !, 
   thanks for taking the time for these questions , i 'd like to think somebody might read this and take something away from it . 
  i hope so too, 
  not only amazing gameplay , but pretty good editing, 
  are n't flaregun ( as opposed to detonator ) hits on fire full crits ? 
  the trailer did n't make it clear what the film was about , also i do n't think that just because someone is a redditor it means that we should make something go viral , we have had way too many hacks ( i 'm not implying you are ) try to milk reddit 's compassion in order to gain popularity for their mediocre work ( all those `` help reddit i 'm a struggling writer and none of those evil editors want to print my shitty warriors novel ! '' ), 
  his mistake was n't grammatical ; it was semantical . 
  - pedantic educators dogmatically opinionated sarcastically . 
  sure , while it may make some paranoid people suspicious it 's something completely innocuous , nothing inherently wrong with it unlike taking a stranger 's kid out of kindergarten, 
  some sort of slang i 'm not familiar with i presume ? 
  upvote this so that more people know !, 
   girls love when you say sure , then order them a water . 
  you 're being sarcastic here i presume ? 
  i would love to pull that off , but no chick has ever had the ovaries to pull that crap on me, 
  add to that when they edit to bitch about downvotes, 
  and most importantly never confuse whales with fishes, 
  he 's getting downvoted because he 's the male version of the women who say they want a nice sweet guy, 
  i have 370 hours on tf2 , 55 as my main class ( pyro ) , would that be good enough ? 
  i would love it, 
  especially if it 's a crit, 
  i 'm not really annoyed by the humor per se , i honestly do n't care about dark humor , however , what bothers me is the holier than thou , moralizing tone , feminists , like those on that website , have when whining about objectification and sexism ; you ca n't make comments like those and then whine that women are objectified , you just ca n't . 
  if people think i 'm a criminal because i 'm mexican i 'm expected to be offended , if people think i 'm a criminal because i 'm a man i 'm supposed to be cool with it . 
  cool , how can i play with you ? 
  i checked out your public server earlier but it was almost empty, 
  alrighty then !, 
  i like mario kart, 
  would you be making this comment if someone had mentioned some odd porn genre like handicapped-pterodactyl-in-flames porn ? 
  certainly a turn off, 
  slow single golf clap that evolves into a crowd clap, 
  same thing happens to men really, 
   how is the population there not dropping significantly ? 
  it is , at least in eastern europe there is an extremely high mortality rate for men, 
  am i the only one who is bothered by the nonchalance with which she speaks about her masturbation device ? 
  call me old fashioned , but it just seems trashy . 
  perhaps not islamic terrorism , but it 's certainly not the liberal-democracy-loving-secular uprising we are being sold . 
  1 : the distinction between central and eastern europe is vague , not concrete , sometimes it refers to former soviet satellite states , sometimes it refers to anything east of germany . 
  2 : i did n't mention russia , so no , i did n't mix them up , nice reading comprehension you mongoloid . 
  here you go dummy , according to the un :, 
  also , the comment i replied to was talking about europeans being bad drivers and how come they were n't dying , i said they were , at least in eastern europe , and i was right . 
  learning some basic reading comprehension could save you the trouble of looking like a retard next time you reply to a comment . 
   if you were n't ignorant , you would know this is n't result of reality but of historical russian influence and power projection in the un . 
  it does n't matter , geographical classifications are n't always concrete , this is one such case , and i showed a standard under which it is true that poland is considered eastern europe , i was right , deal with it . 
   you basically shat with your pants on . 
  stop calling me sweet names fag , i am not your dad nor sugar daddy . 
  nah , how about i keep insulting you and you keep getting pissed sweetheart pumpkin pie ? 
   i do n't expect people without proper education and history proficiency ( you ) to grasp the intricacies and complexities of the region . 
  that 's why you should have ended debate long time ago . 
  we are n't debating anything , i 'm poking an enraged monkey ( you ) for my own amusement . 
  use some puns , bitches love puns . 
  but . . but . . those filthy ~ ~ kikes ~ ~ err , i mean , zionists and the amerikkkans they just want their oil or something !, 
  yeah i really like it , how much does one cost ? 
  i do n't have one, 
  the proiblem with assigning the blame to weather is that historically this has n't been the case , 16th century spain was wealthier than northern europe , same goes for 15th century italy , medieval greece and the middle east . 
  thanks !, 
  the renaissance started before the 16th century ( the little ice age ) , moreover this does n't explain greek and roman ancient power ( nor middle eastern ) . 
  do n't you get it you cis-gendered-ableist-fatist-neurotypical-middle-class-white-male ?!, 
  this is yet more evidence that the patriarchy affects men too !, 
  i 'm going to write my comment in a way that shows my premises and conclusions so as to make the discussion clearer . 
  1 a society is any association between two or more individuals . 
  2 in a communist society individuals share all resources . 
  3 we have had communist societies . 
  4 humans generally share resources willfully if they feel empathy or have personal gains from doing so . 
  5 communism does n't permit individual gains . 
  ** conclusion 1/premise 6 ** : ** willful ** resource sharing within communist societies requires empathy .
