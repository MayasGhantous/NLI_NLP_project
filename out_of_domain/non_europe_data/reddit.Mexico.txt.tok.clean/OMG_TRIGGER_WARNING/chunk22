  because sexism does n't happen to men . 
  but what about x ( men being objectified ) ? 
  it does n't count as sexism because we live in a sexist society . 
  how do we know that we live in a sexist society ?

   right , but if you use a cc , then it 's directly traceable to you . 
  this is n't for everyone , but it fits a specific need . 
  what 's a legitimate situation that would require this ? 
  ( not being confrontational , i 'm honestly curious ), 
  no , they just underestimate how much they eat, 
  somatotypes ( meso , endo , and ecto morphs ) are bullshit based on pseudoscientific psychological theories, 
   but i eat really crappy, 
  eating crappy does n't mean that you are eating enough calories to gain weight , you could eat only macdonalds and not gain weight as you eat below your daily required calories, 
  credit cards can have thousands of dollars in credit , so there could have been plenty of money left to steal, 
  i do n't want to seem like i 'm supporting teh guy from the comment but i ca n't let this comment go unchallenged :, 
   as for crime , let 's look at a little known country known as honduras . 
  for every 1000 people there 91 are killed every year . 
  murder and crime statistics are n't the same thing, 
   it 's only this bad because of colonialism . 
  simplistic unicausal explanations regarding something as complex as history , politics , sociology and economics are almost certainly wrong . 
  there is a difference between build , but somatotypes are based on a 19th century pseudoscientific psychological theory, 
  are the players better/more coordinated in mann up mode ? 
  what about in boot camp but in harder missions ? 
   ( a lot of those from the austrian school of economics ), 
  i just knew someone using all bold font , and talking about predicting the global collapse had to mention the austrians, 
  and that 's fine , as the euro is an idiotic idea, 
  and ** the ** imminent * coming * ** super ** ^ duper ** hyper inflation ** and the * fem * ma con ** centrat ** ion camps and the new ^ glorious era * of the g * old st ** and ** ard too , but nobody seems to care when they make silly predictions that never come true . 
  the euro is effectively a fixed exchange rate between countries that do n't have full labor mobility nor full financial integration nor similar needs i.e. 
  an idiotic idea, 
  so because my mom sells tamales successfully it means that she 's better prepared than bernanke ? 
  911 fineshoes, 
  i 'm currently studying economics and i 'm having a hard time with math , when it comes to getting a job how much am i fucked on a scale from 1 to 10 ? 
  i have a certificate in proficient english ( my native language is spanish ) though, 
  this comment thread is just adorable, 
  honestly i do n't give a crap about viaolentacrez nor creepshots , but i 'm glad to see gawker media banned from here , they are just awful awful journalists, 
  i 'm not racist , i even have a nagger friend , but ... 
  i only get mired by bros , feels confusing, 
  iirc if you made mortgage payments the house is yours too, 
  it 's bizarre what will get srs offended, 
  i think it was funny the first few times , it 's just overused now, 
  huh ? 
  go read cracked , or maddox or the oatmeal , every third sentence is `` i pirate-kicked some baby in the cock because he took my bacon '' sort of uncreative humor, 
   tell him what i did ( in detail while blowing him ), 
  you 're definitely skilled, 
  man it 's a doggy dog world out there, 
   `` well she exempts from your example right there because she killed herself and it 's morally wrong to talk about these kinds of travesties '' . 
  i absolutely agree with you, 
  oh man he 's * totally * gon na have ssome pizzas sent to his address !, 
   there were muslims in medieval spain . 
  is n't this a pretty well known fact ? 
  what ? 
  you do n't know what a conflict of interest is ? 
  if a judge were friends with the guy he 's judging you would just go `` rumours are always unreasonable . 
  rumours are rumours . '', 
  instead of recognizing the obvious conflict of interest ? 
  you 're arguing against a point i never made , i was specifically attacking your assertion that `` it 's just rumors and that they are always unreasonable '' , being suspicious about a conflict of interest arising from a rumor * is n't * unreasonable , i have no idea if ign is biased , and i have no stance regarding that, 
   but as you can see you would need more taro plants and bacon than i would need mangos , resulting in a trade imbalance . 
  you did n't explain why that is bad , you just explained how it would arise and then asserted that a wiser solution would be to innovate . 
  also , how are trade deficits sustained ? 
  for you to give me taros and bacon in the first place i would need to give you something back , if you did n't want mangoes you would simply not trade with me right ? 
  i 'm so glad i snatched this user name before anyone else, 
  great response , thank you, 
  that was the joke, 
  it does n't necessarily have to be an fps , it could be an rts or survival horror or pretty much anything, 
  argentinians are the blacks of latin america, 
  mexicans are above peruvians , who are , in turn , above bolivians , nobody wants to be bolivian, 
  you 're still a whore for cheating on your bf with a one night stand though, 
  you 're judging me for judging her , so on top of being a hypocrite you 're also an idiot according to yourself, 
  it was n't a joke , you 're an idiot and a hypocrite, 
  they are indeed a comedy site , my personal beef with them is that they take themselves too seriously and claim to do serious research on their articles when it 's quite obviously bullshit, 
  that just seemed unfunny and forced to me, 
  '' based on data from the employers ' responses , the authors concluded that the increase in the minimum wage increased employment in the new jersey restaurants . 
  oh man , i remember the first time i killed someone with a deadringer , it seriously fucks with your head, 
  famous last words, 
  we got some pretty good cooperation going in the reddit europe server last night, 
  so if i 'm smaller than you i can smack you in the face and get away with it ? 
  can i punch fat women too ? 
  bribing only works when you 're rich, 
   admittingly , if she hit me in the face i 'd probably take her down but i still would n't use my full strength . 
  this sounds like i could get away with punching you in the face if i were smaller than you, 
  god damnit i did it too , fuck , fuck, 
  he just needs to take them out from the automatic teller machine machine !, 
  in my experience it 's only used among emigrants and people who are very influenced by us culture , the average mexican says `` estadounidense '' or gringo, 
  i can remember my history classes mentioning maximilian being a liberal every time the subject was brought up , i thought it was common knowledge really, 
  he was a rebellious teen, 
  oh yes , with usernames such as `` icumwhenikillmen '' and `` killwhitey '' they will surely turn reddit into a more civil community !, 
  get a bidet you plebeian, 
   found traces of his sleeping pill ( ambien ) in his system . 
  well this is driving under the influence , and if you 're driving while intoxicated you are a danger to others, 
  yes i found the same thing , chinos seem to fit me better than jeans for some reason, 
  of course , though we need op to clarify this , but from the information he gave us it does n't seem unreasonable for his friend to ahve been given a dui sentence, 
  was that a tough decision judge ? 
  nope , i prefer big fake boobs, 
   6 ' 9 , heavily tattooed , and weighed 400 pounds . 
  wtf , was your dad a bear or something ? 
  if you add another '' * in * '' you get a palindrome of degeneracy, 
  oh god oh god you ahd to remind me again !, 
  well romney as a governor seems to have done right , and i think that his business experience does make him more qualified than obama in economic issues , so what 's so crazy about electing him ?
