  do n't link to gawker pls, 
  not even for other foreigners , i 'm mexican and i understood just fine, 
  that 's just retarded , there 's no such thing as a `` shy gene '', 
  you should see his fight against pacqiao, 
  add ibiza to the list of places to avoid, 
   later i realized that in the us , interpersonal communication is dominated by empty gestures that have no meaning , both in speech as well as in those fake smiles everywhere . 
  oh god yes , this so much , that was also my experience as a tourist in the us and with the tourists i 've met while traveling, 
   natural artesan water, 
  what the fuck is that even supposed to mean ? 
  a lot of that becomes intuitive after a while, 
  i imagine theyir discussions go like this :, 
  `` check your non-decaf-cis-species privilege '', 
  `` no you are the privileged one ! '', 
  `` you are oppressing me '', 
  `` no you 're literally raping me '', 
  god damnit why do some women insist on acting like children ?

  why am i not surprised here ? 
  no , it 's this website :, 
  notice that this one is chon , not chan, 
  ahh i see just trying to clarify that, 
  there is a difference between being stunning for your age and being stunning compared to people 40 years younger, 
  is this supposed to be bad ? 
  nope , 4chon . net , is a notorious rip off from . org ( check the encyclopedia dramatica pages ) , basically . org tries framing them of everything whenever shit hits the fan ( just like 4chan likes blaming stuff on ebaumsworld/9gag/reddit ) , this thread was probably made by someone from . org, 
  just flirting with me ? 
  maybe 2 weeks ago , bluntly approaching me ? 
  like a year ago ( grabbing my butt and smiling seems pretty blunt to me ), 
  were your biological parents married ? 
  or did they soecifically arrange for your dad to impregnate your mom ? 
  is n't that a bit like saying that we can describe nature by using words ? 
  what is math but a simplification of reality ? 
  i still ca n't quite grasp how it is that some lines of code can make a machine render something like a videogame, 
  yeh i do n't pity the whiteknights who date those womyn, 
  it 's illegal to ask someone to charge me less for a price before we sign a contract ? 
  so it 's ok to do so with an agency ? 
  how much do you think i could get discounted ? 
  ahh i see, 
  that 's actually pretty good for me , how much were you paying ( it 's not the same to pay 50 bucks less when you are renting at 1000 dollars a month than to do so at 300 dollars a month ) , did you negotiate with an agency or a landlord ? 
  thanks, 
  yes having the same issues , it 's like they do n't like it when people buy stuff from them or something, 
  not as good but many people are having trouble with buying it from gmg, 
  edit : i myself tried buying it from gmg , they charged my card ( my bank confirmed it ) but the website claimed that the operation was unsuccessful, 
  why would that even be relevant ? 
  i do n't know what the hell that guy stands for but why would you even care ? 
   you mean you lost money for nothing ? 
  yes , i already sent a complaint , they said they would respond in 2-4 working days . 
  edit : they responded before 1 day on a sunday , they solved the issue, 
   having the portuguese language as a barrier to entry is ideal - it ensures that foreigners ca n't just slide in and take up senior jobs, 
  well portuguese is very similar to spanish , so i do n't think that it is a very effective barrier for people from spain or the rest of latin america, 
  i main vanguard , but it 's extremely fuin to go as an maa , flank , and smash the heads of some archers, 
  ahh yes , brazilians are well known for their elevator pranking traditions, 
  even worse , pedophile necrophile, 
  yeah , same way that you do n't need a mathematician to teach basic arithmetic to kids, 
  but you can have a good understanding of those topics without a math degree , i 'm sure that i can teach a child multiplications and fractions in an intuitive way, 
  because they also benefit from it indirectly , every time you do n't get mugged , every time you use the electrical grid , every time your employees use a public road , every time you hire someone who benefitted from public education you are indirectly benefitting from government . 
  imagine how depressing it must be to be the baboon that gets dressed, 
  well we had samurai fighting cannons and armored boats ... 
  go to the sierra de guadarrama , lots of snow there !, 
  great name for a band though !, 
   ( a ) who thinks he is worthy of idolization, 
  that 's because you most probably live in a western country , hitler and the nazis do n't hold the same stigma outside of western europe/anglo saxon countries/israel, 
   and i have an ethical problem visiting areas where extreme , oppressive poverty exists right outside the gates of the resort, 
  so instead of going there and helping the economy with what you spend you will boycott them and still think you 're a good person for doing so ? 
  that 's why he used an exclamation mark instead of a question mark, 
  that 's the way i feel about doctor who and pokemon, 
  go fuck yourself you disgusting piece of shit , i shit on your dead relatives, 
  economics can explain it : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marginal_utility, 
   it looks gross . 
  it smells horrible . 
  it 's terrible for you . 
  and you would be right , alcohol tastes like crap and the only reason people enjoy it is because of its effects, 
   i really would love to go one day, 
  so you are n't actually mexican ? 
  there are areas in mexico that have the same murder rates as western european countries , other areas have the murder rates of conflict ridden shitholes, 
   what exactly is your point ? 
  my point is that your comment about not knowing someone who believes that he is worthy of idolization is irrelevant since , probably in the vast majority of countries , he does n't hold the same stigma as in the countries i mentioned , thus while he may not be forgotten his image already is n't all that negative ( outside of the countries i mentioned ), 
  you make a reasonable point , and i 'm inclined to agree, 
   he believes he actually got it after an artery burst in his leg from a busted chemoembolization , and he had to have a blood transfusion . 
  i do n't understand , he got it after a blood transfusion ? 
   i think either the teaching and research sides of universities need to be separated to a greater extent, 
  oh god yes , it 's amazing how much of a difference can different professors make even when teaching pretty much the same subject, 
  it 's a meme just like saying `` ad hominem '' every time you get insulted on the internet, 
  can this disagreement be resolved through the use of empirical evidence ? 
  you 're just saying that because you 're evolutionarily programmed to say that , you see when humans were living in caves and the sexual amrket was ruled by alpha males yada yada ... 
  why should we assume that caribbean countries have the same legal drinking age as the united states ? 
  well she could have just taken her sister 's car you know ? 
   he specifically said he does n't know the timeframe . 
  well i predict that the united states economy will grow between -5 % and +5 % somewhere in the future , gib nobel prize pls, 
  so you chose a study abroad program without even giving a passing glance at a wikipedia article on the place you were going to stay for months ? 
  overtly emotional, 
  fat,
