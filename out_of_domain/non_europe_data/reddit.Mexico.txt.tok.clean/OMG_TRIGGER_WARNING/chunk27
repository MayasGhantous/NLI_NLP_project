  i agree , the midwest should go to their native people , kick out the beaners and whitey , give it to native americans, 
  the only people who watch that show are snobs that want to feel superior to rednecks, 
  what these mongs do n't realize is that the point in this comment is to highlight how absurd banning guns would be , just like it would be absurd to ban black people, 
  kick out the blacks and the asians too , america for native americans right ? 
  they 're tactical-crocs, 
  oh man i did n't know what a monchichi was but i googled and i 'm literally crying from laughter : http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-x8sjrub__f0/tynbbu1a-vi/aaaaaaaac94/ikzmpkmg9_q/s400/monchichi.jpg, 
  she claims to be finishing her history degree at the moment , but she does n't like it and she wants to pursue a life in the arts, 
  i dislike that attitude too , but i really did n't find it there , they 're telling her that she ca n't pay 100k in debt with mininmum wage , not that her history degree makes her an idiot, 
   on 5 digits it 's going to be hard to beat inflation without taking big risks on your investments . 
  do n't government bonds historically outpace inflation ? 
  man this sort of post really makes me appreciate my mom, 
  harr harr i made a black people joke , gib karma pls, 
  yes amazing book , totally recommend it, 
   gender is a social construct , i.e. 
  a role , but it 's still supposed to be something innate to you . 
  this still does n't make sense to me , if something is socially constructed how can it be innate ? 
  man why ca n't my generation stop liking such shit music ? 
  i wish everyone were more mature and liked the beatles or nirvana like me . 
  btw the upvote button is the amount of dicks justin bieber sucks xd, 
   i realized i did n't just get smarter or suddenly become classy, 
  that 's because you ahve n't started wearing a fedora nor saying `` my good sir '', 
  yeah i think it 's silly , the opposite ( i.e. 
  women responding to threads that are asking for men 's opinions ) also happens a bit in / r/askmen, 
  i remember when i was 15 and going to soccer practice and this gang of gay guys would scream stuff at the kids coming for practice , pretty fucked up, 
  of course , we should also have furry-trans-otherkin , queerosexual muxes , and decaf-moluscs, 
  whenever i read some flashy headline with words like `` collapse '' , `` imminent '' , or `` hyperinflation '' i imagine that the person behind it is some conspiracy nutcase with very little of worth to say, 
  it 's funny how she does n't mention him at all in her blog while evry third word in his blog is about her, 
  a concoction of chocolate and chili : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mole_ ( sauce ), 
  post your controversial opinions ( that most of reddit agrees with ), 
  on the contrary , they should stay inside and not come out, 
  / r/shitredditsays is full of people with borderline and bipolar personality disorders ^ and ^ white ^ knights, 
  i love fake tits , i actually prefer them over regular breasts, 
  but electricity may be cheaper ... 
  is good sustainable planning compatible with living in houses ( as oppossed to apartments ) ? 
  it 's got 873 upvotes , good god , 873 people thought this was funny, 
  only faggots screenshot their own posts, 
  oh god oh god , a statistics joke that i can understand !, 
  so what ? 
  rage comics are retarded and you 're a bad person, 
  good lord i just got done with it but i have my final exam in january , my professor has a natural talent for sucking the life out of a class that would otherwise be interesting, 
  you sound insecure ( e.g. 
  `` i do n't deserve it '' ) , relax and enjoy your gift, 
  depends on where she posts , if she posts on / r/fuuuu and / r/adviceanimals i would definitely be turned off, 
  i think that the sense of humor in those places is very very far from my sense of humor, 
  i think he got banned for doxxing, 
  reddit is very much against the posting of personal information , the poster denouncing the scam originally posted the real name of the guy, 
  ahh i see that now , fixed, 
  white knight syndrome , every woman is a potential damsel in distress, 
  god i hate that post , it looks so fake , it reads shittily and the behaviour is scummy, 
  depends entirely on the setting you prefer , shogun2 is a great game and i would recommend it , but i did n't like its setting, 
  well obviously the newer ones look better and introduced some new mechanics ( like losing troops to harsh weather or auto replenishment of troos ) but generally speaking they play the same, 
  i feel the same way , and it 's perfectly fine imo , 20 dollars for 15-20 hours or more of entertainment is pretty good, 
  yeah , mfa may be blunt , but they will give you constructive advice , people only get butthurt because their graphic tees and fedoras get criticized, 
   if it was more reddit-hivemind-friendly , i bet it 'd be drowning in upvotes . 
  i actually think that the comment is very hivemind friendly , it 's just that it got targetted by the contrarian hivemind, 
  i do n't like honey boo boo, 
  i 'm looking at the op of the thread 's ( ijob911 ) submission history and i keep getting page after page after page of news about jews and israel , i think that there 's a point at which this stops being plain bigotry and starts being an indicator of mental illness , you just ca n't be that obsessed about any subject and still be called mentally sane, 
  i 've never understood that , i mean , i understand having a preference for natural breasts , but people complain about implants as if they were the same as testicles, 
  the name gentleman boners just sounds so pretentious , like , i imagine that everyone there says `` my good sir '' and wears inappropriately formal clothing items, 
  if that guy replaced his obsession with jews for something more constructive he could be an eminence in his field, 
  france is the fifth biggest military spender and has the 3rd biggest nuclear arsenal, 
  not just american influence , but any foreign influence, 
  iirc there were a few srsers with names such as `` killwhitey '' or `` kill all white men '', 
  i remember having an argument with a srser where she claimed that joking about genocide is ok , but not about rape, 
  yeh , i think some people believe that offenssiveness can make up for unfunnyness, 
   `` but even then i feel like people will say i 'm overcompensating . '', 
  no matter what you do in life , whether you are muscular , skinny , fat , short or tall there will be people that will find a fault in whatever you do , stop considering those opinions worthy , the sort fo person that believes that working out means you 're an insecure loser is the sort of person whose opinions should n't matter to you, 
  i really enjoy watching the fights , i took a class during my summer break and i loved sparring , but hated practicing techniques, 
  i do n't find myself attracted to even slightly overweight women , and i would definitely not be interested in a woman heavier than me ( i weigh 87 kilos which is almost 200lbs ), 
   the fact that i am a big black dude also does n't help the situation if i ever get accused . 
  black men are the demographic that is more likely to receive a harsher sentence , white women , on the other hand , are the group the least likely to be sentenced or , if they get sentenced , they receive lower punishments , i absolutely do n't blame you man, 
  it 's easier because you 're a native english speaker , as a spanish speaker i find pronouncing german to be very hard while french is easy, 
  ehhh i agree with your comment except that :, 
   to use an example i heard christopher ricks make at a talk , you 're never going to pronounce don quixote the way cervantes pronounced it in renaissance spain . 
  so if every pronunciation is incorrect , then who are we to set a value to the correctness of anything ? 
  there is somebody in spanish that actually sets value on the corrrectness of words : the rae ( real academia espa\u00f1ola ), 
  i 've been complimented by frenchies several times , no bullshitting on my part !, 
   the ka'aba ( the huge black box that muslims face while praying ) was once a site for pagan pilgrimage.it would also be a storage site for these idols ( ... ), 
  what 's inside the box now ? 
  i do n't care about some fat degenerate from texas , but gawker blogs constantly use pretty shady tactics and poor flame bait articles in order to gain clicks , they 're on the same tier as the daily mail and alternet, 
  i know that , my knowledge of that was implicit when i acknowledged that it was easier for him because he 's a native english speaker, 
   at a guy with his head shoved up his ass . 
  so the guy that made the original was real ? 
  oh god it read like such a parody, 
  i suspect that it 's a worldwide trend , i know that economics is the second highest paid degree in mexico ( actuary being the first ), 
  pls go back to / r/politics and do n't come back, 
  and i 'm sure many people will be left thinking that aig will actually sue the us government, 
  why are you looking for us certifications in spanish ? 
  google for the closest intituto cervantes , i 'm sure they 'll be able to help, 
  how do i stop people from curling in the squat rack ? 
  please respond, 
  instituto cervantes along with rae ( real academia espa\u00f1ola ) are the authorities when it comes to spanish , good luck !, 
  giving and receiving violence , as in i want to wrestle a girl and violently fuck her like i 'm trying to split her in half with my penis while pulling her hair/choking , but i also want to be pegged , scratched and biten and general femdom . 
  shoe fetish ? 
  as in the shoe alone or a woman wearing them ? 
  except if you plan on making mean comments on facebook or call a horse gay ( both of these are real cases , too lazy to google ), 
  i think you 're the guy with the highest upvote count i have on reddit, 
  agreed , i had lots of fun for the first 5 hours , after that the game just got repetitive, 
   while men do n't live entirely privileged trouble free existences , they are incredibly unlikely to be subject to widespread discrimination and bigotry . 
  same goes for women in the first world tbh ( i 'm not being sarcastic ),
