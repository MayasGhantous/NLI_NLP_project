  no no no , you see any evidence of misery and authoritarianism in communist countries is n't valid because by definition communism is against those things !, 
  the only thing i hate about canadians is that stupid , overused joke about them apologizing, 
  yes , some guy that just went to a class with you is going to rape you in the middle of the day in the hallway of a university , genius plan, 
  i 've been groped , cat called and complimented by women many times , i still ca n't quite drill it into my head that they can be attracted to me, 
  oh man i remember when i first noticed my forcyde 's spots , i thought i had an std while being a virgin !, 
  i detest self pitying whiny people so i really would just ignore her, 
  well the german women i 've met were nice , what 's so bad about them ? 
  i love strategy but i could ever get into victoria , it 's just too damn complex, 
  i think that the problem with the newer totalwar games was that they had very little variety between factions , there are very few differences between playing empire with the russians and the spanish , rome2 will definitely have more variety, 
  i remember playing against soemone online that did something similar with scotland , i just bombarded him with my cannons and horse archers , he broke his formation pretty soon after that, 
  op your formation is pretty damn vulnerable against anyone using archers/artillery, 
   mr. aaron miller ,, 
  surely you meant mr moshe goldbergerstein, 
   mali is at $ 17 billion ( mark zuckerburg rich ), 
  just to nitpick , gdp is a measure of income , that is , the country produces 17 billion a year , while mark zuckerberg owns that amount in assets, 
  reddit constantly crashes smaller websites when they get linked here , it 's one of the biggest internet communities they are probably losing a ton of revenue from being banned here and from being boycotted on 4chan ( kotaku is n't banned , but users boycott kotaku ), 
   wow , people still take the whole gawker ban seriously ? 
  gawker , regardless of what they did to the fat degenerate , is awful , so i 'm glad that they 're banned, 
  meh , it 's not that powerful as a formation if you 're going to play by rules that specifically ban what makes it vulnerable , it 's like banning pikemen and then showing your `` impenetrable '' army made up of cavalry, 
   could it be that reddit 's users , en mass , do n't want to submit gawker links/can find the content to post on other sources ? 
  it 's because , quite simply , gawker is shit , that 's why nobody apart from srsers and actual gawker employees is complaining about the ban, 
  nobody on 4chan cares about violentacrez , they just think it 's a shit website, 
  if you are in europe i can send you my steam and we can play a game with those rules and we can see how effective that strategy is against somebody that know how to defeat it, 
  they are some small bumps that grow on your dick and other arts of the body , google them to see what they look like, 
  oh it 's glorious , being in a hot tub while it rains is even better, 
  and we 're gon na get the shaft long and hard when rome2 comes out, 
  he 's implying that all white people look the same , that 's racis ', 
  she claims to be 26 and to a, 
  have been with the guy for 3 years , if we assume that she started being sexually active at 16 and that she 's been faithful to her man , then it means that in 7 years she had more than 100 partners , that 's around 14 a year , seriously we can be as open minded as we want but having sex with a different person ( same goes for men ) each month for seven years has to be unhealthy in some way, 
  i bathe on pig period blood myself, 
  exactly what i thought , i do the same thing even though i 'm taking pills for that, 
  the [ / r/politics ] ( / r/politics ) crowd likes posting anything even remotely related to economics here , not content with just shitting up their own subreddit they decide to smear their poop everywhere, 
  i played my first game on easy difficulty against bots , i still got flamed, 
  they can buy legitimate rounds from reputable suppliers instead of buying them from ahmed down the street corner ? 
  i think some people are so desperate that they would still go to the male stripclub, 
  it 's a bit like when women claim to like a guy `` that makes them laugh '' , just something we say in order to not sound shallow, 
  well if he 's indeed irish he 's probably beating away the women with a stick, 
  downvoted because this is is n't [ / r/askreddit ] ( / r/askreddit ), 
  i 've noticed a trend where there 'll be women responding to the main question in this subreddit , i know people will call me a stiff and a douchebag or whatever , but this sort of thing defeats the whole purpose of the subreddit , it 's why [ / r/twoxchromosomes ] ( / r/twoxchromosomes ) is a sausage fest, 
  like in the middle of sex ? 
  i would let her go for it if she 's really into that , i 'm pretty clean but i would be more worried about her not enjoying that than me, 
  i do n't know of any country where shyness is something specifically desired in men , i mean maybe some cultures are more accepting of it , but i do n't think this is an american specific thing, 
  i do n't think people hold the same standards for their partners that they do for themselves , and i do n't think it 's necessarily hypocritical , e.g. 
  i 'm not attracted to women that do n't shave their arm pits or their legs and while i do n't do that , or as dakru said , women expect confident men regardless of how confident they are themselves, 
  what ? 
  there are plenty of people that believe that euthanasia is humane, 
  ehh we all become a little dumber when drunk , but we do n't go from being normal well adjusted people to batshit insane after a few drinks, 
  meh , in my experience the people that say that they work out and eat well but do n't see results are greatly exaggerating the truth , it 's true that our genetics do limit us , but i 'm willing to bet that this woman went to the gym where she half assed her workout and now she considers herself a former gymrat, 
  this is partially related to your question : [ where masturbation and homosexuality do not exist ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/12/where-masturbation-and-homosexuality-do-not-exist/265849/ ) , it 's basically an article regarding an african tribe where no homosexuals are present ( anthropologists studying them have n't found evidence of homosexual practices ), 
  yeah , absolutely this , it 's one of the sexiest things a woman can do for me, 
  that woman is just perfectly plain , like , not ugly , but at the same time i would n't ask her to have a coffee with me ... 
  it 's interesting how much standards vary , she definitely looks `` meh '' to me, 
  talk to him , play with your hair while smiling , touch him , etc he 'll get the hint if he is n't autistic, 
  you look like david cameron in the last photos, 
  ehhh , it depends , if i go as a scout or spy i can easily get behind enemy lines and get an unsuspecting sniper with a taunt kill, 
  jesus , the huffington post is a clusterfuck , i do n't get why people read that thing, 
  i think the map is very inaccurate , i know at least one spanish woman that fought in afghanistan, 
  i have to agree with / u/boss _ of_the_internet that whiny stuff is what made me unsub from r/mensrights, 
   cyril, 
  is he the originator of the cyrilic alphabet ? 
  this definitely makes sense , orthodox serbians , russians , ukrainians , etc use cyrillic while catholic croats , poles , etc use latin , extra question why did romanians keep their latin language instead of adopting a slavic language ? 
  i 've seen this claim thrown around quite a bit , are these tests done after transgendered people receive hormone therapy or before they do ? 
  really ? 
  you mean a private company cares about profit and is n't making stuff out of the kindness of its heart ? 
  what other sagacious insights can you tell us about ? 
  this thread is highly related to this question :, 
  nobody cares if you made a value judgment or not , you 're being downvoted because this subreddit is very much against barely informed speculation . 
  that 's very interesting , thanks, 
  thank you very much for this amazing response . 
  went out on thursday and got eye raped by a girl , so i suppose that counts ? , i was directly complimented a couple of weeks ago by a girl that told me i 'm very handsome, 
  unlabeled graphs make baby jesus cry, 
  which people exactly ? 
  i do n't like libertarians but i ca n't fault them of being inconsistent in this regard, 
  as far as i know it was half and half , people tend to forget about the many many non-jewish victims of the holocaust, 
  yeah i figured that out , it 's just bad for to not label your graphs, 
   something stem people have known about for generations : differential equations will do that . 
  i 'm on my second year of an economics degree and just learned differential equations , advanced math is n't reserved for engineers, 
   i do n't know what country european muslims immigrate from , but my experiences with the religion have been universally good . 
  afaik in the uk it 's mostly pakistani and south asian muslims ( bangladesh , india , etc ) , while in france it 's northern african muslims . 
  give her your shoes , that 'll scare her away, 
  in my experience ugly girls are too insecure to approach you ( or at least they are n't attracted to me ) , in the rare occasions i get approached it 's been by moderately cute girls, 
  exactly !, 
  even when women hit on you they still expect you to do the work ( in the sense that they expect you to go for a kiss / escalate things further ) , pretending to be oblivious is perfect, 
  fucking women is the antithesis of being in the friend zone, 
  the most i 've felt was having a crush on a girl when i was 13/14 , i have n't felt anythig like that since , nor have i had a girlfriend ( i 'm 21 ), 
  oh god , does she still have a credit card ? 
  depends on where you live , liberal outside of the united states means pro-small government ( but not quite the same as libertarianism ) , in the united states a liberal is somebody in the center left/progressive, 
  i think you 're simplifying the financial crisis issue regarding the responses to the crisis by conservatives and socialists , the very much pro-market baltic countries suffered a great deal during the crisis ( they seem to be doing better now ) while `` socialists '' in the united kingdom , china and australia did well , i 'm not pro socialist , but i think that the causes of the crisis are a bit more nuanced, 
  aig is n't suing the us governmet , it 's a former ceo that 's doing it and asked aig to join the suit , aig declined, 
   you found one exception . 
  and i can find many more exceptions ( physics , math , engineering , biology , medicine , etc ) , your `` regardless of class '' statement was just dumb, 
   it may sound simplified , but the same thing is true in both macro - and microeconomics ; you ca n't get out of debt by borrowing and spending even more . 
  this is just plain wrong , microeconomcis and macro are n't the same , what may make sense for a firm or a household does n't make sense for a government , if your tax revenues decrease during a crisis getting into debt in order to activate the economy is a good thing ( see the stimulus packages of australia , usa , and china ), 
   so what you 're saying is , if you 're getting less short-term income than you used to , you should increase your long-term expenses in order to artificially return your short-term income to the place where it was ? 
  a crisis is n't just about returning to your short term income , a crisis can have long term consequences along with destruction of wealth . 
   you ca n't see how that method only pushes the problem into the future ? 
  implicit in this question is the assumption that the alternative is any less destructive for the future, 
   say you manage to get your tax revenues back to where they were after a while . 
  or you prevent them from dropping to a level so low that you ca n't meet your obligations and you end up with both a deficit and a depression, 
   ok , the downside is that now you have higher interest rates than before ,,
