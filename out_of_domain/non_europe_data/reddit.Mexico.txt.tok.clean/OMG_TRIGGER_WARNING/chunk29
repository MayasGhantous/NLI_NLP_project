  your interest rates can also grow if your economy is shit , say after enacting austerity measures * cough * spain * cough *, 
   here you might argue that your `` activating the economy '' has had positive effects on growth , so that the tax revenues actually are higher than before , evening everything out . 
  it does n't even have to even out in order to be preferable to austerity , it just has to be less bad than teh alternative, 
   so what you 've done here , in the best case scenario , is you 've managed to maintain the status quo , but with the consequence of having higher debt than before ,, 
  no , the best case scenario is that you manage to avoid 26 % unemployment , negative gdp growth and still having a deficit and an increasing debt burden * cough * spain * cough *, 
   that is dependent on a yearly growth rate equal to or higher than the yearly interest rate ( or you 'd be forced to take even more new loans to maintain the economy ), 
  no , your growth rate does n't have to be higher than your debt rate , your government revenue has to be higher than your expenditure in the long run , e.g. 
  i do n't need to increase my salary in 5 % each year to pay a debt that charges that , i just need to make enough to pay off the debt, 
   the next time a crisis hits , you 'll be in the exact situation as you were before , only now with even more debt . 
  not really provided that the moment you recover from the crisis you start dealing with your debt . 
   if you want to see the end result of this kind of economic policy , look no further than current-day greece . 
  you 're building a tower standing on a foundation that ultimately wo n't be able to support it . 
  this is a dishonest argument and i 'll have to call you out on this , i 'm advocating stimulus spending during crises , not spending like morons during the good times, 
   the thing is , what makes sense for a firm or a household is exactly the same thing that makes sense for a government ;, 
  of course !, 
  personally i print my own currency , set my own interest rates , regulate my banks , depend on the income of the people that pay taxes to me , etc , my household is just like a government !, 
  i do n't want to sound condescending but this comparison just shows to em that you have no clue about this topic and that i should n't bother to continue this conversation, 
   that people are taught that this is n't true is the reason why people do n't understand economics . 
  honest question , have you ever taken a legitimate course in economics ? 
  or what makes you an authority in judging that people do n't understand economics ? 
  is there a reason why the sort of economics that are taught through blog posts on mises.org or ron paul videos are better than those taught by actual economists in universities ? 
  we can theorize about what 's bad and what 's good all we want , the fact is that places that enacted austerity are suffering the pain of it while those that did n't are growing , the usa , australia and china are growing and they all used deficit spending , spain , a country that had a low government debt is in a depression after taken austerity measures, 
  there is n't a standard form for transliteration between arabic and latin scripts , so his spelling is as correct as yours, 
  i apologize if i came off as insulting , was n't my intention . 
  noice very noice, 
  al reves esta cagadisimo, 
  good good , back to circlebroking, 
  yeah copyright violations are literally nickelback when fox does it but when reddit does it they are actually helping the artist, 
  i ahve no idea what a size 18 means , but you can lose weight and massively improve the way you look , head over to [ / r/fitness ] ( / r/fitness ) and read the sidebar, 
  i like a sweet silly girl and all that jazz , but it could become cringeworthy if it 's overdone, 
  i love fake tits , but it 's something definitely bordering on fetish so i may not be representative of men in general, 
  sure !, 
  [ this ] ( http://picture.fm/pictures/jenny-poussin/jenny-poussin_uxlno92lez.jpg ) is ideal for me , [ but i also enjoy absurdly large tits like this ] ( http://www.xvideos.com/video1823738/sexy_venera_with_huge_tits_bouncing_while_she_rides_you ), 
  also [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk6oojbvwpq ), 
  or pretty much anything in [ / r/boltedontits ] ( / r/boltedontits ) or [ / r/bimbofetish ] ( / r/bimbofetish ), 
  i remember seeing a thread with a really good looking guy on / r/pics , he was getting pretty suggestive messages , and by suggestive i mean things like `` i want to blow you '' type of messages, 
  i think in those situations it 's also easy to get carried out by the adrenaline and stress , old man was probably used to knocking people down, 
  that women are as creepy and perverted as men , i 've personally been shamelessly groped by women many times ( getting hands inside my pants or having my shirt lifted ), 
  pinches rateros !, 
  well , the sort of women that do that are n't the sort of women you want doing that , if you know what i mean, 
  a girl i know had a guy walk up to her and grab her tits , he just non-chalantly said hi and left, 
  he was a stranger at a club, 
  i measured it once when i was like 15 and it was 16 cm long , so around 6 inches , by thickness i just know that i ca n't put my erect penis through a toilet paper roll, 
  i would give myself a 6 or a 7 , so yeah , you can imagine those women, 
  ted talks seriously ruined their image with that whole tedx thingy , and i 'm not justs aying it because of this woman but because they 've allowed conspiracy theorists and numerous bullshit peddlers to associate themselves with the ted brand, 
  theaustralian dollar is actually worth slightly more than the us dollar ... 
  what if that actually makes her enjoy it more and in turn scream even louder ? 
  1 and i 'm 21 , completely ok with it, 
  agreed , there are many things i do n't like about pua but there are definitely some useful tips to be found in it, 
  flirting to me is about being playful and learning how to read social cues , this can only be learned through trial and error so you 'll just have to suck it up and talk to women, 
  i have the same measures and 6 ' tall is definitely not average , the only place where that 's average is in the netherlands, 
  i would n't consider it a deal breaker but it would be a serious turn off, 
  i 'm 21 :, 
  childhood was shit , i was extremely shy and anxious and treated like crap by my older brother , the `` friends '' i had were abusive towards me , tried killing myself after one day my brother spent what felt like hours smashing my face into the floor of my room, 
  12-18 : less shit than childhood but lonelier as i learned to isolate myself from people since being alone is better than having shitty company , went through a serious depression at age 15 ( never seeked help , but i assume i was depressed since i got to point where i would just wait the whole day for sleeping time to be happy ) and had extremely low self esteem until i was 17 so i allowed myself to be abused . 
  18-now , i would say it 's ok , i 've worked on myself and succeeded in some things , my social skills have improved but i still need to work on them, 
  better ask me about my thighs , squats 4 life, 
  i 'm going to post this as someone that is the prime demographic of people that seek pua ( early 20 's , formerly socially inept and unsuccessful with women ) and as someone that used a few of their products :, 
  what 's good about them :, 
  - there 's legitimate and useful advice to be found there ( things like how to start a conversation with strangers , how to flirt , etc ), 
  - there are genuinely nice people that are looking to better themselves , not just bang as many women as possible . 
  - there are many free resources that come from people that have little to gain off you , e.g. 
  [ / r/seddit ] ( / r/seddit ) or sosuave.net, 
  - as someone that was very socially inept i can say that it definitely helped me, 
  what 's bad about them :, 
  - just as there 's good advice , there 's also lots of bullshit going around, 
  - related to the point above , a lot of the bullshit advice comes from the fact that many puas are only a step above scammers or door to door salesmen , there are a ton of e-books published by nobodies with ridiculous promises like `` you 'll have any woman you want ! '', 
  or overpriced seminars where people learn nothing, 
  - there are many weird people that see fucking women as some sort of high score to achieve , and as much as i hate using this word , they objectify women , `` i just kclosed this hb7 but found lmr because i did n't kino her properly '', 
  no idea but i look like a fucking t-rex, 
   he seemed to be advocating for fuck knows what reasons . 
  some people just seem to believe that natural = good = morally correct, 
  he gets absolutely destroyed in that argument , pretty funny, 
  yup , look at the white knight defending the fair maiden 's honor in the youtube comments, 
  maybe australia also has a big average , but 6 ' tall is definitely tall in most of the world, 
  or the fact that they died younger , making state pensions and elderly care cheaper, 
  heheh would he be saying that if it were a video by a fat girl ? 
  the older you get the more of an economic burden you are since you stop working and start receiving pensions , retired people 's taxes do n't make up for what they consume, 
  yes only once when i was a very very insecure 13 year old , have n't had romantic feelings since, 
  i love fit girls , not big bodybuilding women , but definitely the type of girl you can see in [ / r/hardbodies ] ( / r/hardbodies ), 
  i disagree , [ / r/askscience ] ( / r/askscience ) has an enormous amount of subscribers and still is great thanks to heavy moderation, 
  iirc baltic countries still have their own currencies, 
   subscribing to smaller subreddits only puts off the problem , because they 'll eventually get that big too , theoretically . 
  you know what solves the problem ? 
  very strict moderation , if people want to act like children we will treat them like children, 
  what he is saying is that restricting the amount of money in circulation in a depression is a bad thing i.e. 
  exactly the opposite of what the fed is doing now, 
  just because it would n't be perfect it does n't mean that it would be a nice improvement, 
  there are certain things that can definitely be easy to moderate if you establish proper rules , check [ / r/askhistorians ] ( / r/askhistorians ) , history is n't something as clear cut as science yet they have a great community because there are very clear rules ( no politics , no memes , no reaction gifs , etc ), 
  the sort of person that goes to a science subreddit and posts his retarded jokes is the sort of person that is too childish to understand why his posts get deleted, 
  who cares ? 
  the sort of person that will call you a nazi is the sort of person you do n't want in your community anyways, 
  no need for that , he 's getting extra nutrients that way, 
  i 'm also interested , but my issue is girth not length , regular condoms are long enough for me but they cut my blood flow , any advice ? 
  well did the women in question know about each other ? 
  the guy in question is n't even saying that it 's good from a moral standpoint to discriminate , he 's saying that from an economically rational standpoint it makes sense to discriminate , some people seriously get blinded by their anger, 
  ehhh aztecs ( and other mesoamericans ) had very complex and advanced societies that in some aspects were even more sophisticated than europeans , i think it 's unfair to characterize them as savages just like it would be unfair to characterize europeans as savages if we just used the inquisition as a representation of them . 
  majoring in econ at the moment , i love it, 
  all you need is some acai berry and muscle confusion exercises brah, 
  good food and cheap labor,
