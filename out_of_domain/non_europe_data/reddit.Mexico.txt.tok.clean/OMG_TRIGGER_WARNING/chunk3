  7 a biological limit to human empathy exists and it is called dunbar 's number . 
  8 societies with a number of individuals above dunbar 's number require either coercion or individual incentives in order extract cooperation from individuals . 
  ** conclusion 2 / premise 9 ** : a communist society bigger than dunbar 's number requires coercion to make individuals share . 
  premise 10 : historically speaking , coercive forms of resource rationing on a large scale have resulted in violations of basic human rights and worse results in health , income and education in comparison to non-coercive forms of resource rationing ( mixed economies , laissez faire economies , etc ) . 
  ** final conclusion ** : communism on a large scale would be worse than systems that permit a free or moderately free exchange of goods and services . 
  do n't forget about buying a dashboard cam while you 're at it . 
   he 'd be a pretty perfect match for r/skeptic if you ask me . 
  he has a science background and present scientific papers on all kinds of subjects . 
  well that 's lovely but it does n't mean that he is safe from violating youtube 's guidelines , please provide evidence that youtube is unfairly taking down those videos, 
  i 've clicked every single link provided in this thread and have seen no evidence whatsoever for nucking 's claims , the videos posted are just videos made by people complaining of censorship and nothing else , no mirrors of the banned videos in question , nothing . 
  and if nucking 's goal is to gather support for what he believes is an injustice then yes , it is his problem if he ca n't properly support his claims . 
   the other reasons i can understand since they are inherent propeties of people . 
  why does this matter ? 
  why is it okay for me to call someone a piece of shit muslim but not a piece of shit arab ? 
  why is the fact that one is an inherent quality of a person relevant to the improperness of demeaning it ? 
  there was an ama from a guy who claimed to be falsely accused of rape , the original submission had a reasonable story , and after the post gathered some positive responses the op edited the original post to say that he had raped a woman thus making it look like we supported a rapist . 
  the ama was predictably linked to from srs , however i still do n't know if it was confirmed if someone from there made the thread or if it was just a run of the mill asshole making it . 
  i apologize , i watched the embedded video and those linked from here , i was n't aware of the videos in the description , downloading them now . 
  and the point is not that we think that the comment was a serious threat , the point is that you 're all hypocrites . 
  the reddit servers definitely improved my play, 
  1 do n't ask loaded questions ( not all religious people believe gays should be executed , so your comparison is useless and biased ) . 
  2 no , i still do n't understand why it 's ok to say `` fuck christians '' but not `` fuck black people '' . 
  it is kind of a bitch move , if a friend of either sex woke me up in the middle of the night i would tell them to take a cab . 
  i see , i usually take refusal to kiss as rejection , regardless of whether they 're friendly afterwards or not ( e.g. 
  i met a girl in barcelona , she refused kissing but then wanted to see me again there and in madrid ), 
  the context is about hate speech ( in this case religious intolerance ) and demeaning people , not criticism i never wrote that criticizing was the same as demeaning . 
   are you familiar with the concept of a hypothetical ? 
  with abstract thought ? 
  why yes , yes i am , in fact i 'm so acquainted with the concept that i know that your hypothetical was both dishonest and irrelevant in the context of my comment ( censorship of religious intolerance vs censorship of racial intolerance ) . 
   you asked why it is okay to condemn people on the basis of their beliefs and not their inherent properties . 
  no , i asked why is it ok to demean people on things they ca n't change vs demeaning them on things they ca n't , the core question being : why is religious intolerance any less odious than racial intolerance ? 
   i gave you a hypothetical to help you understand . 
  a loaded dishonest hypothetical acting as an appeal to emotion ( really ? 
  hating muslims is the same as hating racists ? ), 
  is far from helpful . 
   do you really think it is wrong to say : `` fuck you for hating black people '' ? 
  not at all , still irrelevant though . 
   or do you still think that nobody should ever be criticized for their beliefs ? 
  never made such claim, 
   `` we must not criticize the beliefs of the kkk . 
  their beliefs must be accepted . '', 
  never made such claim . 
  again , i 'll repeat the core question i 'm asking , now in bold , all caps and italics :, 
  *** why is bigotry based on something that you ca n't change any less odious than bigotry based in inherent qualities ? 
  i 'm *** not *** asking :, 
  why is criticism of beliefs different from racial discrimination ? 
  why is dislike of racism different from racism ? 
  to finish , i 'll give you a hypothetical since you seem to love them so much :, 
  nationalities are something we can change ( you can renounce your country 's nationality anytime you want in most cases ) , would it be ok to demean someone because of his nationality ? 
  you know , it 's something that can be changed !, 
   religion is a choice . 
  race is n't . 
  and so are career choices , nationalities ( in most cases ) , hobbies , cultural expressions , etc :, 
  do you believe that demeaning a janitor is ok ? 
  do you believe demeaning turkish nationals is ok ? 
  do you believe demeaning video game players is ok ? 
  do you believe demeaning sikh traditions is ok ? 
  edit : added an extra example, 
  why does the distinction matter ? 
  if we treat someone like shit enough they 'll eventually give in and change ? 
  i apologize , i had n't seen the videos linked in the description of the original , after watching the first one it does seem like it did n't deserve to be taken off , then again i 'm against most censorship ( censorship of hate speech included ) so i 'm not happy regardless of whether they were hateful or not . 
   i , personally , do n't hold those opinions but of course other people are allowed to . 
  me too , however i also feel that way about racists , what i do n't understand is why some people are making a distinction between both forms of prejudice . 
   it 's a sticky pale paste that oozes by and get squished, 
  meh same goes for regular bread , tortillas , etc , nothing gross about it, 
  and how do we know you 're an `` over 30 yr sales rep here for first hostess '' and not lying ? 
  thanks for the link , it 's a good resource that i 've already used , what boggles my mind is that i 've done the whole escalation and i see all the signs ( showing neck , giggling , touching me , offering me a sip of their drink , etc ) , yet i got that response a few times . 
  this is glorious !, 
   since the release of the first novel harry potter and the philosopher 's stone on 30 june 1997, 
  why would you link to something proving you wrong ? 
  beautiful , just beautiful, 
  i was making a bad joke, 
  yes , i mean , if you know who oscar wilde is ( and i remember reading about him in third grade ) then you know he was tried for homosexuality , op is probably thirteen years old or something, 
  no , no i do n't you dirty fucks, 
  they are re-selling the coffee from the other restaurant i believe, 
  it 's not a southern european thing , it 's a `` well-intentioned morons/cronies thing '' , while this laws have ridiculous implications they are simply the natural result of well-meaning-but-ill-conceived laws like what [ he said ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/economics/comments/q8qys/meanwhile_in_athens_after_finally_starting_a_new/c3vqzh4 ), 
  or agricultural subsidies , or trade tariffs or pretty much any form of protectionism, 
   too many cafes already , for instance . 
  and if you are posting in [ / r/economics ] ( / r/economics ) then i hope you understand why this is idiotic, 
  got a link ? 
  and then they bitch about how oppressive marriage is , i 'm starting to see a pattern here ... 
  i watched the whole video waiting for the wtf part of it , it was just a neat animation video , nothing more , some people are too impressionable, 
  the title is misleading , the current presidents of colombia and mexico are n't considering legalization , the former presidents are , the only current head of state considering it is guatemala 's president . 
  name your spy-cicle that way , it would be infuriating, 
  one would think that after seeing a bunch of statues they would wise up , but noooo, 
  yes , which still does n't mean that mexico is considering drug leaglization, 
  it 's like i 'm 13 years old again !, 
  yeah i just did , go call the internet police, 
  i 'm well aware of that , does n't make the title any less misleading, 
  it 's in the options menu, 
   `` if the consumption of drugs can not be limited , then decision-makers must seek more solutions -- including market alternatives -- in order to reduce the astronomical earnings of criminal organizations . '', 
  no , here 's the original quote :, 
  the key word here is `` busquen '' not `` busquemos '' , `` busquen '' is the conjugation of the second person plural of `` buscar '' , that is , in his quote he is telling the us to legalize or seek other countries to buy from , he mentions nothing regarding legalization in mexico . 
  i do n't know about santos , however , the article says nothing about him . 
  1 he says only if other countries do so first, 
  2 even if he had called for legalization in colombia that would n't make the title any less misleading as the article in the op does n't mention him at all . 
  then i stand corrected on him not supporting drug legalization for colombia , however the title is still misleading as no information regarding santos is given by the article . 
  1 that can be regulated through zoning laws as long as a society deems it desirable . 
  2 regulating the amount of cafes or taxi licenses or whatever does benefit some people , but , in general , it makes society as a whole worse off . 
  yes , but restricting licenses as a whole is silly,
