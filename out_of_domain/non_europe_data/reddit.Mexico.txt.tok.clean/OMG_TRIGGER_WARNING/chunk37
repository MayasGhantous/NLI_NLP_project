  i dunno i went to six flags in mexico city on a weekday and had a great time, 
  meh , if they 're into that what 's the harm ? 
  well fetishrot could be a dude you know ... 
  well that 's interesting, 
  you see , rape is about domination and oppression , and without institutional discrimination there can be no oppression nor domination , thus men ca n't be raped because they are n't institutionally oppressed . 
  she was n't old as afr as i know , she was his mistress . 
  srsers are capable of some amazing mental gymnastics, 
  i 'm a native speaker , i only understood `` esto le pasa a todos los ( something ) , de parte de los zetas '' , it would translate as : `` this is what happens to all the ( something ) , from the zetas ( notice that the from here refers to the zetas being the ones sending the message , not that this is what happens to people from the zetas ) '', 
  the people that post on this very website in subreddits like / r/adviceanimals and / r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu, 
  do you have sources for all of those stats you provided ? 
  from which country do those statistics come from ? 
  you really ca n't say that economic growth or a slowdown will come from a single variable like people leaving the active workforce . 
  depends where you live , i 'm 6 ' tall and mexican and i 'm pretty fucking tall for my country , i live in spain and i 'm just considered tall here but nothing crazy , and if i lived in germany i would just be average, 
  i 'm 21 and i definitely would n't like dating a single mom , i 'm at an age where i can get shitfaced on a tuesday night or travel on a whim , i do n't want to be bound by a lack of a nanny . 
  in what typed of combat are they useful ? 
  jungle ? 
  urban ? 
   hungry, 
  i had never heard of this place called `` hungry '' , i wonder if it is because i did n't get a 5 on and ap test ? 
  how dare she say that we are trying to silence her ? 
  let 's do everything we can to silence her !, 
   and there is where a large portion of our debt in spain comes from . 
  spain had very low levels of government debts running up to the crisis , spanish public debt increased only after the crisis due to loss of tax revenue and increase in social security . 
  but then how will they get clicks coming from reddit ? 
  yeah what kind of sexist world do we live in where people get fired for assaulting their co-workers ? 
   i am about 6 ' tall and 150 pounds and no matter how much i work out or eat, 
  bullshit drink a gallon of whole milk a day for a month and see if you ca n't gain weight . 
  i 'm a straight man so maybe i 'm not the best to judge , but those seemed like good looking guys to me . 
  i hate how the internet in general loves playing up to that crap , you see people calling him a badass everywhere on the internet . 
  no , people outside of the us write the day before the month , so a mexican would write 15/08/85 instead of 8/15/85, 
   in a tourist center , i except everywhere in the world to speak just one other language then their own, 
  i understand if this how you feel about people working in the tourism industry , but i do n't see how the average jacques has to speak english to please you . 
  good point . 
   if they got for example an non-french speaking queue in the major train station in paris during high season . 
  you mean a schedule ? 
  that seems reasonable , yes . 
  huh ? 
  she went once to a bullfight in madrid , i 've lived in spain for two years on top of being of spanish ascendance ( my uncles are spanish nationals ) , this is a case of a gringo going `` let me tell you about your culture '' . 
  for curiosity 's sake : what do you consider to be the `` rational thinker model '' ? 
   let 's just take one example : travel . 
  if you have money , you stay in nice hotels where no one engages you - discrete luxury . 
  if you do n't have money , you run into strangers at the hostel and have adventures . 
  being rich does n't mean that you ca n't stay in hostels you know . 
   ok ok , how about another one : transit : if you live close to work but have a car , you drive , because you can afford it . 
  if you do n't have that car , maybe you bike , which is healthier for you and ultimately makes you happier ,, 
  or maybe you can exercise in your free time because you have so much money that you can afford to work less hours . 
   or maybe you take public transit , which exposes you to more things going on around you . 
  sure , you may get frustrated at times having to allocate a little more time , but overall ... 
  i 've been taking the bus daily for the past several years , i 've yet to see anything interesting . 
  i think you 're trying too hard to glorify poverty . 
  how do you know what the natural rate of interest is ? 
  greece is n't the only country suffering from austerity , spain , the 4th largest economy of the eurozone , is also suffering from austerity despite the fact that spain had a fiscal surplus and low levels of government debt running up to the crisis and despite having only a bit higher ( 7 % ) debt to gdp ratio than germany [ source ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=47&amp;pr.y=12&amp;sy=2012&amp;ey=2012&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=512%2c446%2c914%2c666%2c612%2c668%2c614%2c672%2c311%2c946%2c213%2c137%2c911%2c962%2c193%2c674%2c122%2c676%2c912%2c548%2c313%2c556%2c419%2c678%2c513%2c181%2c316%2c682%2c913%2c684%2c124%2c273%2c339%2c921%2c638%2c948%2c514%2c943%2c218%2c686%2c963%2c688%2c616%2c518%2c223%2c728%2c516%2c558%2c918%2c138%2c748%2c196%2c618%2c278%2c522%2c692%2c622%2c694%2c156%2c142%2c624%2c449%2c626%2c564%2c628%2c283%2c228%2c853%2c924%2c288%2c233%2c293%2c632%2c566%2c636%2c964%2c634%2c182%2c238%2c453%2c662%2c968%2c960%2c922%2c423%2c714%2c935%2c862%2c128%2c135%2c611%2c716%2c321%2c456%2c243%2c722%2c248%2c942%2c469%2c718%2c253%2c724%2c642%2c576%2c643%2c936%2c939%2c961%2c644%2c813%2c819%2c199%2c172%2c733%2c132%2c184%2c646%2c524%2c648%2c361%2c915%2c362%2c134%2c364%2c652%2c732%2c174%2c366%2c328%2c734%2c258%2c144%2c656%2c146%2c654%2c463%2c336%2c528%2c263%2c923%2c268%2c738%2c532%2c578%2c944%2c537%2c176%2c742%2c534%2c866%2c536%2c369%2c429%2c744%2c433%2c186%2c178%2c925%2c436%2c869%2c136%2c746%2c343%2c926%2c158%2c466%2c439%2c112%2c916%2c111%2c664%2c298%2c826%2c927%2c542%2c846%2c967%2c299%2c443%2c582%2c917%2c474%2c544%2c754%2c941%2c698&amp;s=ggxwdg_ngdp&amp;grp=0&amp;a= ), 
  it 's only convenient because you 're used to it . 
   downward nominal wage rigidity means that a positive inflation rate allows a more flexible wage market . 
  this is because inflation makes it easier for real wages to decrease when it 's needed right ? 
   nominal price rigidities may exist in oligopolistic markets . 
  positive inflation leads to a more efficient market . 
  i do n't understand this , can you elaborate ? 
  thank you for this great response , so , to summmarize , we want 2 % inflation because it allows monetary policy to be more effective than if we had 0 % inflation and because it allows companies to decrease real wages without decreasing nominal wages when they need to ? 
  who would buy a bond or give out a loan that charged negative rates in a deflationary environment instead of simply keeping cash under the mattress ? 
  at least when nominal rates are postive ( but real rates are negative ) lending money makes you lose less money than simply hoarding cash . 
  edit : punctuation . 
   if you want more , let me know , but you 've been given the usual answers we give undergraduates already . 
  i can expand at will on which reasons i think are `` better '' or `` worse '' from an argumentative point of view . 
  i definitely would love to read more since your area of study is precisely the area i 'm more interested about . 
  since when is it bad to feel unconfortable with someone flirting with you when you do n't want them to ? 
  the how can you claim that they returned to their natural rate ? 
  oh man i have * never * heard this joke before , did you make it up yourself ? 
  oh yeah now i see it wtf ? 
  very interesting , thank you . 
   or an `` enrager '' helmet that makes the enemy you place it on go aggro against his allies ? 
  maybe a type of ammo for the crossbow that makes them go crazy ? 
  ah i see , yeah i understand what you mean . 
  you 're supposed to up vote high quality/relevant comments , not comments you necessarily like, 
  but not tanning is racist as it implies that you prefer having pale skin over darker skin . 
  same here , i would feel violated to be honest . 
  tht 's reddit for you , this website will beat a dead horse until it becomes dust . 
   karma would work better if reddit tracked how many times you upvote somebody else . 
  res counts how many times you upvote or downvote someone . 
  i 'm thinking of winnie the pooh made of leather, 
  one of his sons in his ama said that he only did that for money and notoriety . 
  i disagree , when a thread from / r/economics reaches the frontpage it does become / r/politics , but when it comes to threads that start with articles without sensationalistic titles the discussion can become pretty good . 
  i do n't get it either , do they think that if they cat call a girl she 's gon na blow them right there or something ? 
  lots of salsa , some mashed beans and guacamole, 
  purple link oh yeah, 
   so i still have a chance of getting laid , nice, 
  you 're a woman , unless you look like a chernobyl abortion you can get laid, 
  `` well you look like a girl that could use two '' - johnny bravo, 
  being submissive sexually and socially is perfectly fine , but keep in mind that if you want a guy to be the strong one in the relationship then he 'll be the one calling the shots . 
  because it 's a dumb circlejerk, 
   vocal minority of idiots . 
  i always hear that it 's a minority , but how do we really know if the idiots are the minority or the majority ? 
  if i go to a women 's studies class am i more likely to find `` good '' feminists rather than `` bad '' feminists ? 
  i would be into that as long as proper safewords and limits were set beforehand , but i seriously dislike dominant women outside of sex so i do n't know if it would work out . 
   now he says he is studying on this site `` learning '' website with half naked teachers . 
  this is sit-com material . 
  yeah i think it 's wrong to use children to advance whatever political view you 're trying to push , they have n't had the chance to form their own views so it 's pretty manipulative . 
  no , the only message is '' buy our shirts '', 
  it 's the white man 's burden , same reason that they get pissed off when minorities do n't get offended when they want them to be offended . 
  edit : spelling,
