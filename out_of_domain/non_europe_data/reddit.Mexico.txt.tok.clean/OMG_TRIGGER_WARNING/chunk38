  yeah ferguson made a dumb comment , but it 's dishonest to say that he said `` keynes was wrong because he was gay '' , please take these types of articles with sensationalist headlines somewhere else . 
   that is essentially his argument -- keynes did n't care about the long run because he was gay and had no children . 
  no it 's not , you 're reading what you want to read because you 're outraged , his argument was : keynes did n't care about the long run because he did n't have children , and he did n't have children because he was gay , this is n't the same as saying : `` keynes was wrong because he was gay '' . 
  edit : also your thread violates the rules from the sidebar :, 
   please post links to the original source , no blogspam , and please do not editorialize headlines . 
  oh well , i stand corrected . 
  and that 's lovely , but i 'm not arguing in favor of that . 
   it 's pretty misogynistic ,, 
  i do n't think it is , most people are invisible to me ( men , women , old and young ) unless there 's an actual reason to notice them . 
  21 , northern spain, 
  if we talk about all women then the percentage will be low because i live in one of the oldest regions in europe , if we talk about women my age then maybe 1/3 are attractive to me . 
  i 'm mexican , can sjws stop being offended for me ? 
  i think 5 de mayo celebrations in the us are dumb , but there really is nothing offensive about people drinking tequila and eating tacos . 
  edit : spelling . 
   holocaust deniers are like creationists , antivaxxers , moon landing hoaxxers , etc. 
  many times they 're the same people, 
  could be samoa, 
  that 's not barely `` doxxing '' , a resume has your name , address , phone number , previous employers , education , etc. 
  your source regarding inequality does n't show what you claim , and i personally find it suspicious considering that there are countries with higher gini coefficient and relatively high gdp per capita ( equatorial guinea ), 
  nobody took away his right to talk , nobody said that he is going to jail , nobody is sending the feds after him , op simply refused to hire him which is perfectly free to do . 
   the peripheral countries still helped create this crisis with crappy fiscal discipline ,, 
  spain , the biggest country of the bunch had a budget surplus and low level of debt , debt even lower than that of germany . 
  dice `` calor '', 
  `` i dream of a day when prejudiced people will be free to exercise their own prejudices without being judged for it '' - so beautiful !, 
  yes , but your claim was `` the peripheral countries still helped create this crisis with crappy fiscal discipline '' , which in the case of spain is factually untrue . 
  i agree on that . 
  well i suppose that in order to be a good host you have to be good at handling awkward situations with charm . 
  so many butts to hurt , so little time, 
  i do it if i just wanked or have morning wood , otherwise i see no other reason to do it . 
  yeah but what exactly is the joke here ? 
  that 's what they want you to think, 
  do you have data supporting all of your assertions ? 
  which country ? 
  supply and demand of romantic partners ? 
  when it comes to getting relationships i find that women have it just as hard as men when it comes to getting a partner . 
  people who believe it 's tougher for their own sex are probably unattractive and just looking at the most attractive members of the other sex . 
  when it comes to getting sex women definitely have it easier , nothing to discuss here , men have much lower standards than women when it comes to sex and we are encouraged and pressured into seeking sex , women , on the other hand , are discouraged . 
  so true it had to be said thrice !, 
  1 she 's probably attractive, 
  2 phone number could just mean he wants to bone her, 
  edit :, 
  i doubt you hear about fat women getting phone numbers from men like that . 
  what 's the profile of a suicide bomber/terrorist ? 
  this is very interesting , thank you , is there a common , shared , trait among most terrorist around the world ? 
   what do you mean by an economical perspective ? 
  i mean a purely utilitarian cost-benefit analysis over something as subjective as ideals , for example : '' i consider many things to be a community responsibility that should be a shared burden . '', 
  this may be a noble ideal , but i 'm not really looking for a discussion on the morality of it . 
   what is `` economically sound '' ? 
  does society benefit more from funding public university education than from not doing it ( and thus spending the money somewhere else ) ? 
  at least in spain , they 're independent institutions , but with public funding . 
   ok , so i think you 're basically just saying in terms of profit , is that right ? 
  no , i do n't mean this in the way accountants define profit , i mean it in what economists denominate utility and surplus . 
  will paying for higher education yield more social benfits ( in the form of increased productivity , lower criminality , etc ) than if people received loans to pay for higher education ( and thus the money that would be used to pay for universities went towards other programs ) ? 
  first of all , devaluation refers to explicit policies by central banks , depreciation is the correct term when talking about market driven prices of currencies . 
  second of all , your confusion probably stems from the fact that you 're saying how many pesos you can get for a dollar instead of saying how many dollars you can get for a peso , in this case the argentinian peso went from buying .2 dollars to buying .1 dollars , that is , a 50 % depreciation . 
   work for the fed , fdic , or other quasi-government organizations . 
  this works best if you find out that you like macro , money , banking , or finance . 
  i 'm a second year economics student interested in these areas , what things should i be doing now in order to get a job in these types of institutions ? 
  i 'm not american , in case that 's important . 
  thanks for your response , but i 'm not american , nor do i study in the united states , so i do n't know if i could intern at the fed , but maybe i can see if the ecb has a similar program . 
  thank you , this is the sort of thing i was looking for . 
  thank you , this makes a lot of sense . 
  oh i was able to access the article perfectly , thanks . 
  check your privilege cis scum, 
  so female education ( at least in poorer countries ) has a higher marginal utility than men 's education ? 
  the north african provinces will probably be very wealthy . 
  the wars of the diadochi would be interesting :, 
  why are you responding as if you were / u/hellafied ? 
  what level of calculus are we talking about here ? 
  i have no problems with differential calculus , and my integral calculus is not very good , but nothing that ca n't be fixed with some quick refreshing of it . 
  oh great i already took math classes that covered that , i mean , it was n't easy and i barely passed , but now i feel more confident in my ability to do well .

  it was interesting how the armenian guy used his cavalry to distract you from helping your ally , anyway , nice video . 
  how do you play internet games in rome ? 
  yep , ironically enough their ideas of oppression are awfully ethnocentric . 
  i 'm sure sjws can find a way to pin those genocides on white people one way or another . 
  i see them everywhere on reddit , it 's like they 're a cult . 
  oh god , i made the exact same mistake , hope you repoorted it . 
  hmmm maybe i should pretend being a girl to get soem dosh, 
  i 've heard tirar many times to refer to fucking , never heard anyone say `` tirarte a una t\u00eda '' ? . 
  beginners can lift more than 200, 
  ahh , i see what you mean now . 
  why did he hit you ? 
  200 pounds is a very reasonable squat for a 200 pound adult male that 's been lifting for a couple of months, 
  i find it weird how so many of the responses in askwomen are from men , pretty much defeats the point of the subreddit, 
  why not insert it all the way int your butt and then poop it into her vagina back and forth forever ? 
  eh . . are you a ftm transsexual ? 
  because if you are n't getting hormones you will obviously look like a pre pubescent boy , if you are n't then just lift weights and shave your head, 
  i suppose it depends on how you look , short hair looks good on me , but my head is made for it, 
  it should give you a warning saying that before you make a thread, 
  maybe something dedicated to exploring new cool hobbies for men or whatver , i mean , not a place dedicated to a single hobby , but a place to discuss and find new hobbies to try, 
  i moved from mexico to spain , i applied to a university here and i 'm on a student permit , if i so desired ( and if i could find one with 27 % unemployment ) i could apply for a job at the end of my degree and get a permanent residence permit . 
  edit : also keep in mind that before moving legally to a country you need to justify your presence to the local authorties , you ca n't just show up in france and say that you now live there , you need a residence permit . 
   1 ) i do not believe that supply creates demand at all .
