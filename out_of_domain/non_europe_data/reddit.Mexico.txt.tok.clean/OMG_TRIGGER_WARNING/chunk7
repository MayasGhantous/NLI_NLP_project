  the conversation was about protecting your savings from inflation and how it related to freedom , and even in this case what you could do is keep your savings in gold or whatever and then buy enough dollars to pay your taxes when the time comes, 
   gdp is n't an accurate indication of whether nafta effectively helped to raise the living standard in mexico or not . 
  it is an important measure , here is hdi growth if you do n't like gdp , hdi is the closest we can get to computing changes in welfare :, 
  it has been going up all these years , no evidence for a loss in welfare ( of course this does n't mean that increases in hdi have been due to nafta , but it dispels the notion that nafta affected welfare negatively ), 
   scroll down to gdp real growth , and you will see a very modest growth rate from mexico , trending down . 
  notice that we 're speaking here about ** rate ** of growth , not actual growth , a downward trend is indicative of smaller *** growth *** but growth nevertheless , moreover , there 's no actual downward trend , quite the opposite . 
   gdp suggests that nafta has been poor for mexico . 
  if growth has been positive , except for the crises of 1995 and 2001 and 2009 , then how can we conclude that it 's been poor for mexico ? 
  haha . 
  this is biting satire because it explains in a dry manner what other people find funny, 
   before 1994 , the median growth rate was 4.84 % annual growth , almost double of the growth rate before nafta . 
  i can see it now , point taken , however ( and putting aside the discussion on nafta ) is n't a decrease in the rate of growth of a country as it goes from undeveloped to developed consistent with the law of diminishing marginal returns ? 
   i do n't often tell people that their wrong ,, 
  do n't worry , i 'm a big boy and i can admit mistakes , it 's a natural aspect of discussions . 
  after reading your post i 'm questioning what i said earlier , and while i may not be ready to believe that nafta has been harmful to mexico , i think that further arguing about this would be stubborn on my part as i do n't think i have much of a leg to stand on .

  for some people sexism depends on the way you frame descriptions , let me exemplify it :, 
   pride and ego are an exclusively male phenomenon , while patience and concentration are inherently female . 
  is kosher, 
   independence and self confidence are a male thing , while submissiveness and passivity are a female thing, 
  is sexist , despite the fact that i 'm saying pretty much the same thing, 
  but just by a low margin, 
  that 's my point, 
  which is precisely what i 'm saying !, 
  while it 's obvious that the words have different meanings what i was trying to say was that bigotry that uses nice words is more tolerated than bigotry that uses bad words , in this case , if i wanted to say that women are more likely to follow rules than men i can frame it as a positive thing or as a negative thing , if i frame it as a positive ( women do n't let their ego get in the way when it comes to orders ! ), 
  no one will call me out on being sexist , if i frame it as a negative ( women are docile and that 's why they follow orders ! ), 
  i will be called sexist even though both statements are the same thing from a logical point of view, 
  we 're talking about the sort of people who believe jews put aids on bubblegum and create killer sharks , so yeah i think that stupid overreaction is expected from them, 
  ignore that person , it 's probably someone from srs trying to put inflammatory comments . 
  just remember that there will always be assholes in this world and the best we can do is ignore them , do n't let that piece of shit win,

  to a certain extent we do have a meritocracy/technocracy in the western world : finance ministers , vice presidents ( prime minister or vice presidents depending on your country ) , interior ministers , central bankers ( who have complete independence of action from the government ) , etc are n't elected by the public .

  you are n't getting laid white knight, 
   despite the fact that this is impossible , for obvious reasons . 
  this is perfectly statistically possible , what we call the `` average '' , that is , the mean , does n't necessarily divide a sample into two parts , if we have extreme values ( in this case , there being ridiculously good looking men out there ) then the mean can be way higher than the majority of values :, 
  [ for example , mean income is skewed upwards by a small number of people with very large incomes , so that the majority have an income lower than the mean .
