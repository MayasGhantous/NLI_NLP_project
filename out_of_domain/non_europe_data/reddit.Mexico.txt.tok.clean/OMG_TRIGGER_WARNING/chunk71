  yes, 
   how does someone get paid in mpls ? 
  your local currency for the most part, 
   i think i 'll just downvote myself now . 
  that would be the sensible thing to do , yes . 
  does n't that depend on the size of the country ( i.e. 
  big countries affecting global prices ) ?

  do n't say i did n't warn you !, 
  bernie is constantly spammed whereas gold standard posts barely appear . 
  it 's just like homeopathy !, 
  do n't get me started on my 10th generation non-irish heritage , i greet by saying `` cheerio old bean '' and drink irish car bombs all the time !, 
  the fuck ? 
  i 'm mexican and i 've never seen anything like that in my life , where the hell did you see that ? 
  atl\u00e9tico has become one of the big clubs in europe , i think that the team now has both the prestige and money to keep its stars unlike what used to happen in previous years, 
  regarding that shirt : since when are spaniards and italians `` anglo europeans '' ? 
  the fuck are you talking about ? 
  since when is spanish olive oil bad ? 
  map porn is basically just / r/maps, 
  mexico did actually , we sent a single squad to the phillipines and lost no one so we have an infinite k/d ratio, 
  i think paul krugman explained very well in this 4 year old article : http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/technology-and-wages-the-analytics-wonkish/, 
  it 's not illegal at all to have it , but you may get your face kicked in depending on who sees it . 
  it 's not one of the most developed ones , it 's the richest latin american country , standards of living are around the same as southern europe, 
  there 's this trend of doing tourism abroad but calling it charity that i find absurd , for example i 'm in mexico and a couple of my cousins went to india to help at an orphanage , as if we did n't have enough poor as fuck people down here . 
  why do you believe that there is a relation between both ? 
  do you do tranny porn ? 
  it used to top that list , but the city really got its shit together and went from having 3000 murders a year to 300 ( still pretty high but a ten-fold decrease ),

  the problem is with how people define diversity in the us vs how they define it in other places . 
  my impression is that in the us people are divided along skin color/race , while in countries with less racial diversity people are divided by language ( e.g. 
  in spain a basque and a catalonian would n't consider themselves part of the same group or even the same country , but a basque-american and a catalonian-american may just see themselves as white ) or religion ( e.g. 
  a lebanese sunni and a shia , both see themselves as belonging to different groups , but in the us they would both be middle-easterners ) . 
  and so this is why someone from the states can look at a country like italy and declare it homogeneous , because if italy is seen through the us perspective of diversity it is homogeneous . 
  yep , real mad 's fanbase is the shittest in spain , i may be a little bit biased though , 
  por ejemplo algo asi : http://thewetshaveduel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/5%e2%80%99o-clock-shadow.jpg, 
  what exactly do you need to know about mortgages and taxes ? 
  d you knwo how to divide and multiply ? 
  do you know how to use exponents ? 
  do you know algebra ? 
  do you know how compound interest works ? 
  then you know about mortgages and taxes . 
  it 's useless to teach specifically about those subjects because they can change every year , that 's why you learn how to do math in general so that you can research on your own knowledge that you ca n't be taught at school . 
   why do they exist ? 
  i do n't know for sure but last time we let foreigners buy property near the border this happened : http://www.ducksters.com/history/westward_expansion/mexican_cession.jpg, 
   how long have they existed ? 
  they 're in our constitution which dates from 1917 , i do n't know if there were restrictions in previous constitutions, 
   what changes occurred recently/being proposed now ? 
  none that i know of , it 's not the sort of cause anyone here cares about . 
  it would help but it would n't stop it , regardless i 'm completely in favour of legalising marijuana and other drugs .

  but the butthurt is going to be so glorious when bernie gets smashed , either in the primaries or the general election . 
  y cual seria la alternativa ? 
  yeah they should have done that legally , bunch of no good illegals trying to cut in line !, 
  funny how that comment comes from someone with `` texas '' in his name , given the history of texas ... 
   1 ) might makes right . 
  no international law matters unless you can back it up with force . 
  maybe that 's what 's happening now amigo : ^ ), 
  to be honest i think it 's the other way around , university sports teams are profitable and the money they make goes towards funding the university . 
  it 's a actually a source of controversy because college athletes are n't paid even though they make money for the university . 
  colombia murder rate 30.8 per 100k inhabitants, 
  mexico murder rate 18.9 per 100k inhabitants, 
  you 're better off working in the us getting minimum wage than working in mexico, 
  oh yeah , anecdotically i have a friend that studied in the us with a tennis scholarship , he was allowed to copy during exams and had a perfect gpa after his first year . 
  west new mexico university or something like that, 
  capitalismo puro y duro , deal with it, 
  this this this , it 's why sanders annoys me so much , he expects rich people from the us to have sympathy for poor people in the us , but not for people from other countries . 
  and what is the alternative to those shitty jobs ? 
  i doubt it , spaniards speak with a lisp when pronouncing `` c '' and `` z '' , this girl used the lisp * on the `` s '' , which only a tiny minority of spaniards use, 
  * edit : i originally wrote lips instead of lips, 
  she dpoes have a lisp but it sounds exagerated , like she 's doing it on purpose rather than naturally , also , she uses the lisp when pronouncing the letter `` s '' which most spaniards except for a tiny minority of people in andalusia do n't do . 
  i know , but most spaniards use the lips on the `` c '' and `` z '' while pronouncing the `` s '' like any other spanish speaker : https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/seseo#/media/file:ceceo-seseo-distinci%c3%b3n_en_el_espa%c3%b1ol_de_europa.png, 
   though she may not hail from spain ... 
  which is my point , she does n't sound spanish , she sounds like someone poorly imitating a spanish accent by overdoing the lisp and by doing it wrong ( it 's supposed to sound more like `` th '' rather than `` sh '' , a spaniard pronounces barthelona instead of barshelona , and would n't say something like picasho or coloresh ), 
   that maps says that only a minority have a lisp ( either ceceo or seseo ) . 
  the rest of speakers do n't . 
  also , spanish does n't distinguish between `` c '' and `` z '' . 
  it sounds exactly the same . 
  i thought it was alright but i could n't stand the shameless product placement . 
  depends where you live , in mexico that 's a fuckload, 
  it was some black people insult that was coopted by white women wanting to sound more `` street '' , it 's a meaningless insult aimed at men you dislike, 
  i 'm a native spanish speaker and it sounds like he said : `` marco si quieres d\u00edselo ahora , ahora mismo d\u00edselo , en espa\u00f1ol si quieres '' ( marco if you want say it to them ( to the audience ) right now say it to them , in spanish if you want ) which sounded perfectly fine to me . 
   mexico was better but still bad . 
  this is to be expected when the only thing you need to pass a driving license test is having two working brain cells , for example during my theory test i was asked if an ambulance was an emergency vehicle and i was n't even given a practical driving test . 
  col. refers to `` colonia '' which means neighborhood , addresses in mexico include it . 
  pb probably means `` piso bajo '' ( ground floor ) . 
  `` anexo '' means adjunct . 
  stands for `` delegaci\u00f3n '' which means borough . 
  i ca n't help you with the rest since i 'm not from mexico city , but the area you 're going to is probably the nicest in town and it 's full of restaurants and bars , very well communicated and relatively close to the main sights in the city . 
  as far as i know the cost is the same for everyone , which is really low ( like 1000 pesos for the school year ), 
  it 's funny that he thinks that cuba is this pristine time capsule when you have all-inclusive spanish mega resorts all over varadero catering to latin americans and spaniards , surely cuba will change with the opening of relations , but just because cuba was closed to the us it does n't mean that it was closed to the rest of the world . 
   europeans are used to having more than two choices . 
  france has a second round voting system : in the first round all candidates are voted , in the second round only the top two are if no one won more than 50 % , it would be impossible for trump to win in france , we have the historical example of jean marie le pen going to the second round of an election and losing disatrously against jacques chirac . 
  mexico : the average person here knows nothing about the us election other than trump is a cunt . 
  i do n't think people here know much about her to be honest . 
  when it comes to people that do follow foreign affairs she 's overwhelmingly the preferred candidate . 
   also mexicans hate cubans . 
  the fuck ? 
  you 're making shit up , i 'm mexican , i 've met hundreds of fellow latin americans in mexico and in europe , not once have i seen or heard of any sort of animosity between our countries .
