  according to cosmo : tickle his prostate with a fork, 
  then what was fatist about my comment ? 
  ( not that i 'm denying being a fatist ), 
  i have no fucking idea who karl pilkington is , but i 'm downvoting you for bitching about downvotes, 
  `` so brave '' usually refers to someone posting an opinion that the hive mind approves all the while claiming it to be controversial , it was a joke, 
  she loves him for his personality, 
   general winter could also be thanked for the success of peter the great in his wars with sweden , depleting the very good swedish army and helping peter the great achieve victory at the battle of poltava , allowing the expansion of the russian empire . 
  were swedish forces not used to harsh weather ? 
  i mean , are n't swedish and russian weathers kinda similar ? 
  before getting to the aliens phase we would need to go through the truckers and fishermen phase, 
   monday = moon day, 
  interestingly enough lunes ( monday in spanish ) is also similar to luna ( moon ) , same for french lundi and lune, 
  what should the piigs do ? 
  why do extremely well educated people support radically different approaches to the crisis ( e.g. 
  european spending cuts vs a fiscal stimulus ) ? 
  also :, 
  should the mexican oil company , pemex , open up to private investment ? 
  i may not be a nobel prize-winning economist , but :, 
  yeah , i suppose i was kind of lazy in my comment, 
  i hate how the guy keeps dodging the questions about hitler and the holocaust , i mean , it 's not like it 's possible for us to think even less of him if he answers honestly . 
  this seems fake :, 
  '' i am twenty-four years old . 
  i saw the first death of my career in 2008 '', 
  really ? 
  a 20 year old doctor ? 
  *** important ***, 
  foreigners ca n't own land near the sea nor the borders according to article 27 , section i of the mexican constitution :, 
  so keep this in mind when choosing a place to live ( i think m\u00e9rida in yucat\u00e1n would be considered too close to the coast ), 
  stay the hell away from the north, 
  i doubt there is anything rural about canc\u00fan, 
  it 's not like you 're going to get shot in any corner , but , you know that 's where most of the violence is, 
  are you being sarcastic ? 
  quite so , several of them are international banks ( santander , hsbc , bbva , etc ), 
  well go complain to the supreme court , the constitution says they ca n't, 
  still , is radiology a 2 year degree ? 
  i have the exact same doubt , what does the government do with the cash ? 
   here 's an upvote to counter his douchebaggery . 
  yeah !, 
  what kind of inconsiderate asshole cares about his fiancee sucking homeless dick right ? 
  never used them , but i would assume that the people in for pay websites are more committed towards finding a partner, 
  i know this may sound unbelievable but some people have different values than you ( shocking i know ! ), 
  and even more offensive than people having different values is that they also have a right to manage their personal relationships as they see fit , ( the gall of some people !, 
  ) , so yes , op has every right to be upset by this , and every right to discuss this with his fianc\u00e9e , if you would n't care about this then congrats on being enlightened and progressive , but other people do n't think like you . 
  we have a prophet here, 
  i would intentionally put wrong answers and change them in the end, 
  i speak english well enough to get pissed off at other people 's grammar mistakes . 
  i 'm good at writing essays and public speaking . 
  congrats you got the joke !, 
  have a cookie !, 
  here 's a video showing how it actually looked like in the film :, 
  i like going to the super market to fart on fruit, 
  absolutely , at least on reddit , plenty of rape stories get skeptical replies, 
  jimmy rustling is from a thread back in 2010 , just like with dolan ( some old finnish meme ) reddit comes to the party extremely late, 
  regardless of that , what about the atoms and molecules that make up those cells ? 
  i can use the wifi from outside my library , no need for any id, 
   mexicans do n't like losing at anything, 
  i do n't think anyone does, 
   combine it with amy winehouse, 
  you mean the amy winehouse who died from overdose ? 
   that guy is probably an alpaca anyway . 
  ftfy, 
  no sir , the bastardization of advice animals and rage comics was all of reddit 's making, 
  basically all men are rapists and all women lie about rape, 
  i 'm just making a comment here so that ever one sees how relevant my username is, 
  , etc, 
   me cae que el peje es como el ron paul ( tm ) de mexico, 
  absolutamente , metete a cualquier video politico de youtube y lee los comentarios : un monton de fanaticos pejistas, 
  no , lo que pasa es que sus seguidores son fanaticos religiosos y teoristas de conspiracion , precisamente como ron paul, 
   reddit is so gullible, 
  tbh that 's such a minor lie it 's not even worth checking it , it 's like me saying that my friend has a red car instead of a blue one, 
   he own facebook . 
  no shit sherlock , but what the hell is so special about facebook when there are hundreds of other social networks ? 
  judging by your arrogance you seem like extremely well versed in business , could you explain if zuckerberg 's success was a result of his creativity , leadership or any other exceptional attributes that make him stand above creators of other social networks or if it was a result of being in the right time and place ? 
  i 'm not holding my breath ... 
  if eating at mc donald 's is cheaper then why not just eat less of it ? 
  if 2 burgers , fries and a coke are above your daily calorie needs then cut the fries and soda, 
  i can definitely see an improvement through the years, 
  the punchline on the title ... 
   straw man . 
  we have n't needed concentrated wealth anymore since the existence of the stock exchange . 
  the whole point of selling shares is to pool diffuse capital to fund a single undertaking . 
  at the same time , people can spread their eggs over different baskets . 
  i disagree , a small start up ca n't bear the costs of going to the stock exchange ( it 's extremely expensive to be listed , at least in the uk ) . 
  [ which means idiot in french ] ( http://dictionary.reverso.net/french-synonyms/conard ), 
  [ i dunno , if you google him it seems like has pissed off plenty of people ] ( http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=richard+cayne&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;channel=suggest#sclient=psy-ab&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=b99&amp;rls=en&amp;channel=suggest&amp;q=richard+cayne+meyer+asset+management&amp;oq=richard+cayne+meyer&amp;aq=1v&amp;aqi=g-v4&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=serp.3.1.0i15l4.0.0.2.176.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0...0.0.tflfho94zn8&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.cf.osb&amp;fp=5ead7ca4aae4d4c9&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=646 ), 
  ask the librarian to kick them out ? 
  most of that has to do with the fact that they 're heavily regulated to prevent fraudsters from destroying confidence in the exchange, 
  you mean to pick up a girl ? 
  or just to chat ? 
  either way just say hi , ask about how they know the host and then go from there, 
  i honestly ca n't tell you whether you should stay or leave , however , whatever decision you make keep your own happiness in mind , not her happiness, 
  this sounds like you want some masturbatory fodder, 
  perhaps this subreddit should eventually go the way of askscience ? 
  i would much rather have a hyper moderated sub with quality submissions over having this devolve into a mixture of r/politics , r/fffffuuuu , and r/adviceanimals, 
   i doubt that , those costs could be recuperated in other ways . 
  perhaps once you 're an established company , but not when you are a small start-up, 
   the financial world likes the high barrier of entry to reduce competition , just like the medieval guilds . 
  far from it , regulations come from the government ( the financial services authority in the case of the uk ) , not the exchange , and investment banks actually benefit from having more companies listed, 
   i mean : the cost of verification and regulation can be recuperated by the stock exchange company in other ways than a high entrance fee . 
  you do n't pay a fee , you pay a private `` sponsor '' to exhaustively look at your records and vouch that you 're a legitimate , stable company .
