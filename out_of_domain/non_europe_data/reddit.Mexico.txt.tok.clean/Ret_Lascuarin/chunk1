considering what the industry has been doing in recent years ... i would not be surprised for such thing to exist , with preorder bonuses such as a new skin and in-game currency at a low price of $ 50 for 1000 bull dollars, 
  3 minutes in and tb is already ripping it apart ... no only that , but there is no reason to stick the name of a long-dead franchise on this mediocre game . 
  i can not imagine the devs ' meeting without either some sort of roulette and throwing darts or , as croshaw once elegantly described it on one of his reviews , murder-suicide . 
  no , worst . 
  this is f.e.a.r. 
  online of the alone in the dark franchise . 
  thank god that this have yet to reach silent hill or clock tower . 
  was there anything left to grab ? 
  sir , they have been doing that since the end of the 90s . 
  if there was anything of importance in atari after the crash , it died since the atari jaguar . 
  an interview with tb would not be completed without a mention of the glorious fov sliders !, 
  ... eitherway , i still dont get the idea of vr , never appeal to me . 
  but meh , neither super mario galaxy and apparently that was goty ; so either it is just a matter of taste or i am just a **** . 
  no offense , but that would suck on black and white , aoe and dungeon keeper, 
  funny thing , i just saw the big picture about jack thompson . 
  nice study about a man that has been eaten by its own image and myth . 
  still , he defends femfreq from being compared to jack thompson , on the argument that she is just a critic and not a politician looking for attention , and ** now she is doing the same thing that brought good ole jack to the gamers spotlight ** . 
  hence #haveawank, 
  wonder if he will mention the #haveawank situation ... 
  nerdcubed made a rik mayall reference during the pcgamer presentation . 
  it went wild . 
  now that is hilarious !, 
  anyway , i do hope they actually repair everything , but i sort of expect , sadly , some sort of dlc when they relaunch it . 
  it is for ancient greece ... 
  i do n't know about modern man , though ... 
  no offense intended , but part of the article sounds , from my perspective , just childish for attempting to categorize this virtual installation as a videogame . 
  now , before you crucifie me , i kind of like it . 
  and i say `` kind of '' because i have only played 40 mins , on a friend 's pc , 'cause my pc is sh ** and my budget is already on the negatives . 
  so i shall not say wether i like or not something 'till i finish it . 
  going back to the article , there is just one thing that i found interesting : why they can not take pride of not being a videogame ? 
  just as joyce did take pride for throwing the english language away , or proust for destroying the axioms of literature back in the late xix century and early xx century , why ca n't they just accept the pride of throwing it out ? 
  its just weird for me to not take pride of this experiment , just as the modernist did with their work , to this extent its just not a videogame , the mechanics and absense of a failure state exceeds the boundaries of a videogame , just as joyce did on finnegan 's wake or nicanor parra and his antipoetry . 
  why must it be considered a videogame and not something apart from them ? 
  why must you put it on the same category as bioshock or age of empires ? 
  it is not , it is something entirely different , and its good because of that . 
  any attempt of calling it a `` videogame '' is an insult to `` her story '' , its just not one , its something else , new , and exciting on its whole . 
  sorry for any errors , english its not my mother tounge . 
  excuse my intrusion , but this kind of things ( the destruction of taboos ) have benn kind of the norm since the beginning of posmodernism , who took from the avant-garde style . 
  i mean , look at this bloody quote :, 
   his ( director damiano michieletto ) production of verdi 's un ballo in maschera ( a masked ball ) at la scala in 2013 saw some audience members - who accused him of desecrating the opera - protesting with a shower of leaflets thrown at the end of the first act . 
  he takes glee on ths press !, 
  and its calculated , he did it in england , a very conservative place , on the royal opera . 
  i swear that he propably is disappointet for not having the queen in the stands . 
  since i have not read the book or scene this director 's version , i reserve my opinon on the work , but i am intrigue to see how posmodernism have invaded the opera . 
  not for me , still unable to see it . 
  in all fairness , best is from north irleand . 
  the sole fact that they almost classified to a worl cup is enough for them . 
  but they created a school of football that has been the base of most of the modern football . 
  wait , what ? 
  who 's the capitan then ? 
  as in neymar `` f-you guys , i 'm going on vacation '' , notorious a ** that is normally insulting everyone on the field ? 
  god damn , dunga !, 
  you have enough brain to know that he is the worst choice !, 
  if its just on clubs it probably will be di stefano , hugo sanchez and martin palermo . 
  i would put puskas , garrincha and maradona , but they actually achieved something with their respective national squads . 
  drogba , mostly because he is more versatile than eto'o . 
  if we just took account raw power , then eto'o would be my answer . 
  ... oh , that 's right . 
  he was on real madrid . 
  more than screwed by the financial crisis , they would be more screwed from the foregin policy from greece , since apparently that would cause the greexit , and posibly the expulsion/voluntary exit of greece from the uefa . 
  but it still too early , so lets just sit and wait for the situation to unfold . 
  holy ... i did not took the apparently new currency as a factor . 
  if that is the case , then yes , both teams are going to lose their star players . 
  drogba shoots better free kicks , as well as being more active with the defense , as well of assisting his teammates . 
  eto'o is better just as a forward , but not as a player . 
  i am just going to see it to know who is going to destroy our hopes to winning the copa libertadores . 
  thanks for the info , / u/xepa105, 
  now , ** that ** sounds like a perfect storm to kill the greek super league . 
  wait , was n't escobar killed due to this game ? 
  oh , yeah ... how do the tas rule on the controversy ? 
  last thing i heard is that he would n't go to chivas and that the olympiakos was going to buy him . 
  don roberto hernandez jr. 
  he is good , fast , and now free !, 
  funny thing , one of the main anti-corruption journalist here at mexico , carlos albert , considered olympiakos as a benevolent team against corruption at football . 
  he still praises the team as `` someone that stood for the player '' . 
  if they still have euros , considering that they are running out of the paper money . 
  now that must ** hurt ** , considering that neymar ** is the capitan **, 
  * oh god ... * i am ** really ** trying to be positive on this one as a fan , but as a football ethusiasts i doubt we pass from this stage . 
  still , thanks for all the near heart attacks tuca , i will have now something to talk smack to rayados fans . 
  oh for christ 's sake ... ** you ** fought with cruz azul due to your * love * for river , never winning anything and failing to score at the finals , and now ** this ** . 
  and really , your are near the 30s , your carrier is already near its end . 
  let 's hope that you do not retire due to injury . 
  ok , i call bull on the court . 
  pele was just a substitute on 58 and injured both on 62 and 66 . 
  the real motor of the team on both 58 and 62 , and the main reason why they did not won 66 due to abscense , was the drunkard of garrincha . 
  did you see the same quater final game that i saw ? 
  was it not almost a robbery ? 
  my only consolation prize is that juninho will play ... * right ? 
  and , no offense , i hope you have the same night as any night on the season . 
  part of both sides , most of us are ** way ** to optimist and almost fanatic . 
  we fill the stadium even when the team was relegated to secon division , for god 's sake . 
  tuca 's desicion have been ... * weird * , and lets leave it at that . 
  at some point we stopped attacking , looking to pass to the semifinals of the domestic league by obtaning a draw , and we lost the game . 
  same thing happened both on the libertadores and on the cup and league games . 
  so as a fan i hope we go to the finals , but as someone that tries to be `` impartial '' , i am also scared . 
  bear with me for a few seconds , for i will anwser with an attempt to make a top 10 players of all time , in no specifically order . 
  * pele and maradona are obvious , their football captivated entire generations and created styles and schools of football . 
  * cruyff was the motor of the total football of holand back in the 70s , he was the face and part of the brain . 
  * wait , since we are now talking about schools of football , what about the hungarian school , masters of offensive football from the 20s to the 50s . 
  the best one coming is pusk\u00e1s , so he must be in .
