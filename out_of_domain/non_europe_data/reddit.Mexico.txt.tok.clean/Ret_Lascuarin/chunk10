  and i borrow or rent games to play , since my budget for games is kind of short . 
  so ... just a normal day at a family reunion after the parents are dead ? 
  ok , thanks, 
  is it wrong if i just vomited ... i mean ... 
  * sigh *, 
  funny , i 'll bet that is actually a premise of a game in japan, 
  metro , both ; mother 1 and 3 , terranigama ( again ) , gem fire ( ms-dos version ) and ff tactics a2, 
  wait , `` full runescape '' ? 
  the f ' happened there ? 
  holy shit !, 
  ok , hang on a minute . 
  are you really serious that a this is going to be a national affair in canada ? 
  like , at the same level of the risisng movement against arabs ? 
  oh thanks, 
  yeah , youtube has been weird, 
  does someone knows why duncan 's video is delisted and only accesible throug kim 's video ? 
  go back to aoe ii and aom with its expansion , also civilization , the x-com and the sequel that will be released later . 
  wait , stormfront ? 
  that 's still a thing ? 
  is it my dirty , disgusting imagination or did holly implied she withold sex due to ross ' mario makers levels ? 
  ok , but ** did ** she withold sex ? 
  probably means not candycrush style game ? 
  who is that ? 
  nah , i tought something more like [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/24/ca/82/24ca82060355529bb5d8bbc8af3a138a.jpg ), 
  edited the post, 
  wait , what about polaris civil war ? 
   she 's massively improved for boom, 
  one of the very few things they actually improved in boom, 
  maybe , but considering the bugginess of it , those improvement are completly passed over . 
  if anything , its better than sonic 06 and sonic r, 
  did you saw the draft ? 
  his choices are almost a perfect representation of the animation for his picks, 
  braced for the worst , indeed . 
  rather my question is from whom will the comments go , from the korean society , known to be xenophobic and homophobic , or from the enthusiast outside of korea , who would probably consider ir a load of bs to hire an american for a k-pop band ? 
  quick edit : apparently the agency is known for being shady , or so they say on r/kpop . 
  if those allegations are true , and considering the absolut shit the kpop idols suffer on the industry , all of this will end really bad to her . 
   in another bit of intense irony : 4chan also just introduced a new board , / his / - history and humanities . 
  / pol / users immediately came to shit it up , but the mods have been surprisingly proactive . 
  / pol / posts are deleted and bans are coming out . 
  the mods even came in and said `` this is not / pol / , racism will not be allowed , this is a board for history discussion '' . 
  i even saw a thread about african history that was racism-free . 
  excellent , after the clusterfuck they did with / lit /, 
   their current approach of `` eh . 
  let the users manage it all '' . 
   in reality it 's more like `` let trolls do whatever they want . '', 
  i think it is something more like `` eh , fuck it , we 're developers , not salesmen . '', 
  wait , undertale ? 
  are you serious ? 
  ... i still do n't get why undertale is on that list ? 
  joe , i kinda like your content , but seriously , practice . 
  but , but , pacifism has been on videogames since the fucking 90s !, 
  when they are in korea , just as mexicans stop beign a minority when in mexico . 
  are you referring to latin america or usa ? 
  wait , what about calvin and hobbes ? 
   the lack of boob physics alienated the degenerates that desperately needed pseudo-hentai anime tiddies to beat off to, 
  wow , you ** almost ** sound like a racist grandmother that considers masturbation as a sin . 
  latin americans refer people from usa , wether white or black , as gringos , and sometimes add negro or g\u00fcero in the mix, 
  someone from kia ? 
  wow , * now * that 's an insult . 
  also , kind of true about my prescence here . 
  i really do n't visit reddit or blogs to often . 
  i just entered today to see if someone was talking of the new president of guatemala and his blackface character, 
  no , you actually sound almost as one of my friend 's grandmother who spend ** an hour and a half ** rambling about the dangers of tv , videogames and books . 
  somewhere she threw the `` masturbating is a sin '' in the mix . 
  classy lady , she used to shout `` indios '' in the streets to passerbies . 
  well , [ it is a racist insult here at mexico by people from cities ] ( http://www.wordreference.com/es/en/translation.asp?spen=indio ) because it refers to people that come from indigenous groups . 
  for a moment i ** actually ** thought this was someone concerned of the fact that elements of the lgb were not that fond of the t. 
  then i read the petition and it looked like something coming from bizarro world . 
  then i scrolled further . 
  milo . 
  well , that explains a lot . 
   i keep seeing this hack fraud in my reccomended list , along with great things as, 
   - how to extract semen from a horse directly, 
   - how to extract semen from a horse using a phantom menace tounge candy, 
   - how to clean your internet history so your partner doesnt see all of your horrible searches, 
  ... uh ... ah ... uh ... how ? ... i mean ... how ? ... why horses ? 
  well , unemployment in a crisis is never fun, 
   but regardless of the context of the original statement , what would make anybody think that the quote would be appropriate today ? 
  because it works when referencing the lack of freedom or opportunities to people , who may not have the same background as you . 
  i just ** had ** to save this comment . 
  good one . 
  wait , why james bond ? 
  i get the gg part and women 's body , but why bond ? 
   idris elba, 
  wait , you mean luther/mumbles could be bond ? 
  why is that bad ? 
  it would be way better than any other cadidate at the moment . 
  you 're forgetting the `` pretend to be russian '' and `` make shitty tumblr pages '', 
  i miss sweepers and actual year-long leagues here at mexico ( i was n't alive back when they implemented the new system , but the one here is a load of shite ) . 
  also , this two of you , mr / u/contretoutchacal, 
  colorful goalkeeper kits http://i1196.photobucket.com/albums/aa415/gennady28/campos1.jpg wonder why they stopped wearing those . 
  it seems like a good way to draw the players attention to the keepers body , during the split second he has to decide where to shoot . 
  diversity in players hair styles . 
  valderama , brazilian ronaldo , baggio , ... and many others had unique hairstyles that all the kids would copy during summer ( not valderama maybe ) . 
  this also seems to have disappeared . 
  now players either have a plain boring haircut or some variation of a faux-hawk when they want to be original . 
  also , since you mentionet campos : goalkeepers that are also offensive players . 
  campos was originally a really good striker , and there was a problem with fifa due to attempting to add him to the squad both as a gk and a st. 
  barcelona , an uncle could n't keep his mouth shut about how unfortunate he was ( is ) because he was born in the third world and not in barcelona to live `` real football '' . 
  also , he normally says mexico will never play the fifth game because `` our gens are not as good as thos from europe or south america '' .
