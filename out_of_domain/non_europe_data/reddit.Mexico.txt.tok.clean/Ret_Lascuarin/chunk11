  i like there is ( was ) someone name ( d ) morrison . 
  also , that crest . 
  my mother smacked him with a newspaper when netherlands threw us off the round of 16 last year . 
  wait ... a death note live-action , hollywood ... adaptation ? 
  ** who thought this one was a fucking good idea !, 
  ** why must hollywood need this !? 
  there is no need to even consider an adaptation . 
  a borges reference ? 
  excellent, 
  ... what the ... uhm ... corrupt le ** ffs , the reason they rise up against the republica was that they , the conservative elite from before , was losing privileges and power due to the democratization of the goverment . 
  ** get you fucking shit fucking straigth , you fucks **, 
  godfuckingdammit, 
  kind of ? 
  the reunification ( they do not use that word , btw ) was something almost traumatic to the ddr , but the language did not suffer the same reconfiguration of the language than after wwii , so most of the words stayed . 
   one would think that the one big flaw of a fictional crush ( namely , the fact that they 're fucking fictional ) outweighs any possible benefits . 
  yeah , they know , and they still continue looking for waifus, 
  he was against the urss of stalin . 
  calm down , we have n't even reached the second decade of the xxi century, 
  then the anwser is no , it is just incompatible, 
  and , god forbids , the amount of salt when they lose is staggering !, 
  i saved your anwser just because of this image that i imagined after reading it :, 
  a ddr rally brokes down with rave and the military begins to breakdance in the floor . 
  fuck you . 
  must we be as brown as you like , or has your majesty rubbed again shit on his eyes ? 
  not all mexicans are brown , wear ponchos and live on farms , you fucking prick . 
  i am sober , but i hate the `` mexicans are only brown '' shit . 
   things no native american, 
  wrong , the `` genetic analysis '' is important since they decide wether you are a native american or not from those analysis . 
  it was , and only yahtzee is still single . 
  with the dick in his brain . 
  and he was just blacklisted from / r/games , fantastic, 
  thanks, 
  just checked 4chan , literally no one is giving a fuck . 
  one . 
  on other news , and kind of relevant , there are shitposting this public discussion about the refugees :, 
  look man , there are people that care . 
  maybe on the `` the game overthinker '' clique nobody gives a shite . 
  good , different tastes . 
  on the anime forums and cricles i frequent sporadically , its actually a topic . 
  and yes , a lot of them know it 's boring , but that 's the nearest thing there is to porn in consoles . 
   david cages games , hell even mainstream titles like far cry 3 have way more sexual content than doa . 
  and both anti-christ and nymphomaniac of lars von tier have a lot of sexual content , but neither is catalgoued as a porn movie . 
  indeed, 
  hancock , maybe ? 
  so ... he wants to go los zetas style , then ? 
  only one i could think of that did not look like coming out of a gq audition . 
  i always found fascinating the idea of minorities beign one big , united group of people that work together , specially when it comes the african americans . 
  at no point have i seen such naive ideal of unity , which is a reason i found political activism in the usa so laughable . 
  btw , thanks for this unintentional comedic piece from smothers-pugh , needed it . 
  yeah , the use of the word `` indio '' is quite disgraceful, 
  there are a lot of rumors about the 1978 wc , mostly surrounding the military goverment in argentina . 
  the most popular are about the alleged bribe that peru received to lose badly against argentina and an alleged case of intimidation to neatherland 's nt . 
  moslty due to toxic masculinity and a worship of guns that is normaly geared to white males . 
  that is ** dis-gus-ting ** ^ ... and ^ oddly ^ erotic . 
  oh la la , * do tell * . 
  but hey , at least you did n't bring printed versions of fanfics to high school and discussed their value to other people . 
  the wind has brought me the fire of my loins !, 
  sorry for asking this , but why is the t-word offensive ? 
  i get why the f-word is nasty , but the t-word sounds just like an abreviation . 
  oh , thanks, 
  ** `` la reina del sur '' ** of perez-reverte . 
  originally i read it back in high school , but at the same time i discovered joyce , sabato , bola\u00f1os , lispector and restrepo , so anything that was not related to them . 
  but in recent times i began to give credit to the novel `` chiquita '' , which i panned during those same years . 
  so i thought `` mhm , maybe it was not so bad '', 
  by god , it was worse . 
  you know that moment when you discover a mary sue on a novel that , for all reasons , should be good ? 
  yeah , because that is the main character , a mary sue that sometimes bad things happens but , hey , everything gets better later . 
  for example [ spoilers about `` la reina del sur '' ] ( #s `` at some point she is arrested during an attempted smuggle of smokes and her husband dies . 
  during her stay in jail , she mets a cosmopolita girl who is the leader of the pen by force , and ends up helping her to become the biggest druglord of wester europe , which she controls because she comes from sinaloa '' ) yes , the entire reason she is good at smuggling drugs is because [ spoilers about `` la reina del sur '' ] ( #s `` she is from sinaloa . 
  you know , the ability to murder , destroy , cheat , lie , hide and smuggle comes in the blood of everyone from sinaloa . 
  they have an advantge due to genetics and some sort of predestination '' ), 
  but by far the worst part is the ending . 
  you see , by this point you will accept that this is just a bad guy ritchie-flick when then , a twist [ spoilers about `` la reina del sur '' ] ( #s `` her first husband was an agent of the dea , and was executed by orders of his godfather after his identity was revealed thanks to bribes . 
  therefore , she must avenge him by testifing to the ** mexican ** police by orders of the dea '' ) so she goes , shit happens and then , after all , [ spoilers about `` la reina del sur '' ] ( #s `` she quits because of her pregnancy . 
  you know , a woman must be a mother first before beign a woman '' ) i kid you not , that is the ending . 
  every single mistake was done , the characters are caricatures without attempting to beign one ; the parts where one of the narrators looks for information about give more importance to him , the journalist , than her and everything ends with an ending taken rght off a telenovela ( soap opera ) actually , see the telenovela . 
  it gives the novel the right amount of respect that one should give it . 
  look mate , do what i do with finnegan 's wake : just continue and began to write every single element that you do not understand . 
  then , read an introduction of narratology . 
  then , re-read it and consider what does the discourse is showing of the world . 
  repeat process untill you are satisfied or it is time to move to something else . 
  or stay on the loop . 
  here at mexico city there is a fire sale/con/exhibit of books called `` el gran remate de libros '' once , between my mother and me , we bought a total of a 108 books on a single day , most of them from tusquets , colofon , fce and alfaguara . 
   spic is just a shortened version of `` hispanic '', 
  does someone actually use that ? 
  it 's like beign two children telling a story the best way posible . 
  how ? 
  for god 's sake mourinho , how ? 
  oh yeah , they apparently are . 
  though i only learned of them when the unam gave them space at one of their book fairs . 
  delirio of laura restrepo and die legende vom heiligen trinker, 
  yeah , i do miss the 5s and 4s . 
  i pity him , we are a clusterfuck, 
  also , chamagol , kikin fonseca , rolando zarate , marino , and a whole bunch of other players that went through the `` six-month vacation '', 
  wait , there is a story in f-zero ? 
   nomura responds with a laugh saying yes , the cross-dressing scene is in the game , but they have n't done the design for it yet . 
  sure , and kojima is ** only ** on vacations . 
  there is at least melted cheese on the burnt remains of what was once upon a time bread, 
  for chelsea , a team i love , shev , torres , falcao and veron . 
  for tigres , the one closest to my heart , almost everything they did last decade .
