  from chamagol , to kikin , along marino , zarate , la gata fernandez , restrepo and many others . 
  worst part of all , there was a very active nazi follow on the uk before and after the review . 
   i love my grilled cheese 's to be extra crisp . 
  on the plus side , they were great on fifa 12 . 
  i. . . do n't get it . 
  manager mode ? 
   our argentimbers, 
  ... do you really call your player like that ? 
  anyways , about la gata , he just up and left us in middle of the season during the decade that must be forgotten . 
   the best manager mode was 2007 . 
  you could have sponsors , contracts , train players individually , sim had a written part and you could join at any point , eac . 
  indeed . 
  i still have the pc and gamecube version , just to play manager . 
  if anything , the only thing that i hate is the scouting system . 
   holy shit , that tb 's fuck konami anthem is rivalling jesse 's welcome intro to felicia day back in the game station podcast days in terms of hilarious intros !, 
  objection !, 
  jesse 's scret love affair is way more entretaining than this !, 
  no shit , sherlock . 
  he sucked , and big . 
  his claim to fame was the almost mitic run of pumas where they grab the league ( short format ) twice in a row , and accomplishment they share only with matosas ' leon . 
  he was not known to be good there , but to be very active and for his sacrifice for the team . 
  after that , he played average at cruz azul and then ( kind of ? ), 
  above average with benfica . 
  and in a surprise move , tigres bought him . 
  now , by the time we bought him , we were shit . 
  we were having one of the worst season on our history . 
  nothing was working as intended , nothing . 
  so the sold someone , i think zarate , and to fill the hole , they brought ** him ** . 
  and shit just hit the fan . 
  see , he was n't as bad as kleber ( in tigres , the fuck scored a ton of goals with america ) , but every time he fucked up ( almost every week ) he apologized to the audience and the fans for his errors . 
  he promised to improve in the week . 
  hence , the kikin cycle ( fuck up , apologize , promise , fuck up again ) . 
   everton, 
  i did n't even remember him . 
  the only time i actually saw him in the pitch was at fifa 12 . 
   luis garcia, 
  he was a bust , but at least he was not a kikin bust . 
  i always thought that , at the time , it looked good to bring back the old custom to buy great players at their twilight years . 
   edno, 
  fuck whoever thought this was a good idea , or an idea . 
  actually that made sense , but tuca just could n't use him well . 
  loan of an apparenlty european level player ? 
  sure , why not ? 
   bornstein, 
  our defense midfield sucked, 
  i know , i 'm late . 
  still , posting here . 
  first editions :, 
  * ofay - earl shorris, 
  * mountain of winter - shirley schoonover, 
  * the kindly ones - anthony powell, 
  not first editions , but rare ones, 
  * die kronpr\u00e4tendenten - henrik ibsen ( translation , dated 1889 ), 
  * a bunch of soviet child books, 
  je , looks good, 
  ok , thanks, 
  and on my tomb , for when the final judgment arrives , i will be able to remember the sweet voice of jesse on his pristine , new white collar shirt when talking about his secret love affair with ms. day . 
  first rogerio ceni , then luca toni , and now milito ? 
  damn , all my childhood idols are retiring . 
  tuca did not fuck up a final !, 
  thanks , though i did not know about that . 
  but the other teams where cruz azul and chivas , the first manages to lose every final since 1997 and chivas has a clusterfuck on the administrative level , so its more their faults than some sort of libertadres curse . 
  el pony ruiz was pretty good , though, 
  what happened to uche ? 
  simple , we bought a player with a seriuos injury , which receded in the only game he played with us . 
  goddamit , must you rub salt and lemon on the wound ? 
  i pity them, 
  here at mexico we alredy have two writers on currency ( 100 has nezahualc\u00f3yotl and 200 has sor juana ines de la cruz ), 
  the ones remaining are the ones of 20 , 50 , 500 and 1000 , so i would put them like this :, 
  * 20 - azuela , and change the images to omething more akin to the mexican revolution, 
  * 50 - juan rulfo , and keeping the agricultural images on it, 
  * 500 - octavio paz , and add more surreal themes on the bill . 
  * 1000 - guillermo fadanelli , just to fuck with him, 
  ( edit : mistake from my part ), 
  undertale is gon na win something, 
  mate , the bar we have for problematic players is ** really ** low . 
  we let walter `` el divino '' gaitan to fuck us up , only to see the manager quit or be fired , for year . 
  ... pavel won it with you, 
  nop , we sold him due to his gambling problem . 
  if rumors are to be true , then he apparently spent cash like there will always be more to be spent . 
  nah , lvg system does not use poachers like chicha , his style is more dynamic in the positions that players are asigned to play . 
  if he stayed , he would proably suffer the same destiny of valdes . 
  if only had they draw russia ...

  [ he 's the fucking president and ceo ] ( https://www.fig.co/about ), 
  context : it 's a fanfic , of rafa benitez ( coach of real madrid ), 
   `` but my greatest innovation . . '' he whispered to me , as i sunk back into the soft sheets of his bed , `` my greatest innovation will be the 2-1-2-2-2-1 -- '', 
  `` enough rafa ! '', 
  i interjected , still slightly giddy from the bottle of tempranillo we had split over dinner , my mind already racing with the tactical possibilities of the 4-4-2 formation combined with a 4-3-3 transition in the attacking phase , `` another time , perhaps , but for now is n't there something else you 'd rather be doing ? '', 
  but for rafa there is no difference between love and football , the language of each sharing the same synaptic pathways , triggering the same emotions , the same passion . 
  `` you have your goalkeeper of course , but in front of him sit 2 sweepers , '' this goalie a light peck on my forehead , the sweepers coming into focus as his lips grazed my eyelids , before a full kiss on the lips announced the next position , `` they are shielded by another player , not quite a defender , but one of those ageing champions , whose legs may be fading but who can still pick out a pass at 60 yards . 
  then you have your two wide men , running the channels , helping out in defence of course , but giving wide passing options in the transitions , and crosses if needed . '', 
  these phantom wingbacks swept down from my shoulders to my hips , as he slid down my dress , his fingers circling a mole and tracing a 45 degree angle to my belly button to illustrate an oscillating compact at the centre of midfield , one always hanging back and the other surging forwards , but able to reverse roles at a moment 's notice . 
  finally he reached my bare knees , resting his hands a moment before pushing them apart , `` you see , '' he continued `` the attackers start narrow in the centre of the field , but as the team advances , they look for runs on the angle , their movement drawing the defence left and right , leaving room for my masterstroke . . '' his hand reached down , under the sheet with which i had attempted to preserve some modesty , my eyes were closed and i bit my bottom lip tightly in anticipation of what was to come . 
  `` ah , there he is ! '', 
  exclaimed rafa , finding the pose-able ronaldo action figure that had somehow found its way into his duvet , `` ronny comes up through the middle and bish bosh scores another one . 
  anyway , you get some kip love and i 'm going to go try this out a bit more on my football manager save . '',
