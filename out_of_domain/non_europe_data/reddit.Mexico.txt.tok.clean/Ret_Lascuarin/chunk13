  who ? 
  and it still controversial on certain circles . 
  a friend that went to a catholic school told me they called that movie `` the lie 's of the devil '' . 
  remember when olympique was great ? 
  those were great times . 
  almost everything that kubrick adapt from a book , the planet of the apes and fight club are superior to their original form . 
  also , a.i. 
  is better than the three short stories in which was based on . 
  and on some aspects , tin drum . 
  and in the case of `` no country for old men '' , while the main villian was one of the best adaptations of characters i have ever seen , the cuts about the sheriff obscures most of the book thesis and ideas . 
  edit : i remembered `` no country for old men '', 
  the accounts that i identified that were his/her were eliminated . 
  with waldo . 
  but hey , lugo finally won, 
  maybe both, 
  yeah , jim sterling and superbunnyhop were laughing to that on the podquisition . 
  and the guides , also it was thanks to them that i understood that one must marry on harvest moon, 
  the house of leaves and finnegan 's wake, 
  nop , he made damn to sure to ensure the listeners knew his hate towards gamefaqs, 
  no , just absorb it with glee, 
  i. . . i need a moment ... let me sit ... ** goddammit mourinho , the fuck is this !, 
  how !, 
  you are a point near the relegate zone !, 
  a fucking point !, 
  now , back to celebrate . 
  meanwhile at the legion fo do-lvg offices :, 
  `` look giggs , we bribe him with a signed shirt from you and we will pass to the next round , no problem . 
  that was uncalled, 
  i read some of his work before lodo and educando los topos, 
  ** memorias de un antisemita , by gregor von rezzori **, 
  great choice, 
  ** best : **, 
  * andre-pierre gignac : 11 goals on the league and 5 on liguilla ( 2 on both finals ) , nothing more needs to be said, 
  * damm and aquino : they were brought from pachuca and rayo vallecano , they took the bands and became important for the squad , taking the place of players like guerron and alvarez, 
  * pizarro : most of the balls pass throug his feet, 
  ** worst : **, 
  * uche : he only played one game , and he not even completed it . 
  * palos , spent this and last season getting in fights with don roberto hernandez jr. , a football comentetor , the only games he played we lost . 
  ** dishonorable mentions : **, 
  * hugo ayala : gets send off on important games ( semifinals of libertadores and the final ), 
  * esqueda : lost his place on the squad , after beign important during the run at the libertadores . 
  still not recovered, 
  shit , this one will be tough for him . 
  adriano 's career died for something like this . 
  edit : ortography, 
  no offense to manu , but you * really * need a new coach . 
  wow , i have n't such aggresive unprofessionalism in a while . 
  and people say mexican league sucks . 
  true , lets hope alcohol is not his anwser . 
  that ... is not a real `` poor choice of words '' , poor choice would be a joke, 
  nop , my mistake, 
  well ... no , he still played , he just drunk it up and spent time with drug dealers, 
  yes !, 
  bielsa with gomis and ayew !, 
    during the trial , judge martin griffiths permitted the rare step of allowing 20 minutes of mr abdulaziz 's evidence to be heard in private . 
   what the fuck is this !? 
  bribes , what else ? 
  enough to burn them . 
  mostly english or french , since both are powerhouses of literary critcism , then german and spanish, 
  first , vacations . 
  to manage the tower of babel you must sacrifice both sanity and will . 
  then , probably a german or french team , since he has n't won a title of both leagues . 
  the main joke when he went to cruz azul was that aa was happy for his progress of sobrerity . 
  and threw reyna out of the bus, 
  he 's loaned , not sold, 
  considering the fact that it is easily accesible through internet and on the street , and also considering the inane bullshit is added on the translations ** over ** what already is there , and also taking into account the clusterfuck created through the silencing a generation by the generation of 68 , which lead to todays extremist groups , a critic version with annotaions of what a shitload of fuck this book is sounds good . 
   or cremia from majora 's mask , trying to save romani after the aliens traumatized her and wiped her mind . 
  yeah , that game was incredible . 
  back in the days of my childhood i could n't understad why i felt some sort of terror , but now i get the whole philosophy and existencial horror that the game offers .

  bola\u00f1o is a pretty good example , also joyce 's entire prose work, 
  source ? 
  ** almost an half fucking decade since the hiring of jose luis trejo ( 2006 ) to the definitive firing of daniel guzman ( 2010 ) **, 
  we were shit , up to the level of derby county , sunderland shit . 
  and not only that , we spent so much money on players that did not work well with us : from stablished players ( chamagol ) to just god-why ? 
  the only reason we where not relegated was due too the fact that the sistem for relegation is rigged to throw back the teams that were originally promoted . 
  not from my team , but rayados ex-keeper was first found with steriods on the system and later caught working as a kidnapper for el cartel del golfo . 
  he also won the league with rayados a year before the doping scandal . 
  maybe chamagol , too ^ remembertheradioshow ? . 
  ha ^ pleaseletuskeepfrenchionthepithc ^ ^ prettyplease, 
  here is my message to river :, 
  ** go fuck yourself !, 
  why is giovinco on the mls ? 
  and what happened to serie a , it does not looks like the serie a when veron played ? 
  ** if ** they are avaible, 
  probably cruz azul , dad became a fan during marin 's time . 
  what a bullet i dodged . 
  nahuel guzman on both cases . 
  does argentina count ? 
  beer !, 
  well the same shit happened with teofilo, 
  not news here though , the only reason they let marco fabian go was that they forgot to modify the contract clause price since the beginning, 
  edit : i missread the comment . 
  look man , we came from almost been relegated with the most rigged system at our favor to the final of libertadores and two leagues . 
  go figure it out . 
  yeah , common mistake . 
  everyone but mancilla . 
  also , we need some defensive midfielders and a sub for gignac . 
   you got ta understand that leverkusen is playing an almost-suicidal attacking style,
