  his time in manu was , uh , * uneventful *, 
  no , but he got the minutes he needed to improve and consolidate . 
  kind of like chicharito , he just needed minutes . 
  he went from the back up of the back up to be on the starting xi .

  also , there is a lady di joke in the video . 
  wow , that 's , uh , wow ... 
  with his sidekick , 8chan !, 
  no , but i am mostly a lurker . 
  before reddit , i used to post on the forum of some defunct webcomic and on dgemu , but later i just drop from them because i bearly post anything . 
  in fact , i posted more poetry than videogame related stuff on dgemu . 
  and i used to discuss with friends things like `` the mythology behind terranigama '' or `` time paradoxes on chrono trigger '' . 
  i did n't even have a personal internet conection until highschool , and when i had it it was mostly for mangas and animes , not discussion . 
  for those reasons , things like facebook , twitter and reddit are strange to me , i have no reason other than to talk when i have no one to talk . 
  hence why i normally just post on / r/soccer and lurk a lot on / r/soccernerd , because the facultad de filosofia y letras of unam are a bunch of arses . 
  same with videogames , so for that i mostly post here . 
  outside of that , / r/pcmasterrace for giveaways and whatever i found while drunk . 
  have n't you tought of retirment ? 
  and for the inge , can we bring bielsa ? 
  yes , here comes a dumb joke, 
  myths talk about me winning anything that needs luck . 
  but when i talk about myth , i mention it in the same way we talk about legends , like my current social life and most of our mom 's sexual activites . 
  we talk about it , but who have really seen it ? 
  edit : not even 5 minutes after this post , i won a give a giveaway . 
  wow , ca n't even make myself look pitable . 
  and i enter to a ton of giveaways,
