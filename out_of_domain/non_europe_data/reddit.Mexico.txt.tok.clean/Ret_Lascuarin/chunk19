  those russians , have n't someone told them that the cold war is over ?

  my first game was aoe i , but so far i ca n't remember anything that i disliked ; hell , i even liked the music and sound effects . 
  the first game i had any real complaints that i remember was shadowman . 
  i love that game , i 'm still afraid of staples and i use phrases from both jack the ripper and nvk , but by god , the control scheme where bollocks . 
  let me just summarized it like this :, 
  * it has shooter elements while not having mouse controls . 
   hardin continued quietly , `` you see the analogy , i hope . 
  in the anxiety to cement forever dominationover their own people , the kings of the four kingdoms accepted the religion of science that made them divine ; and the same religion of science was their bridle and the saddle , for it placed the life blood of nuclear power in the hands of the priesthood - who took their orders from us , be it noted , and not from you . 
  you killed the wolf , but could not get rid of the m - '',

  edit : ** i must read the instructions well x 100 **, 
  so ... it just comment , then ? 
  this would be easy . 
  * ( enters and loses ) *, 
  not fuckiing it up !, 
  fallout 3 , if you may op, 
  i am kind of on the middle with the whole campbell preview . 
  on one hand , the article as a preview is worthless . 
  on the other hand , i found his thesis compelling an intersting , specially since i am also on a situation like that . 
  see , i found both mario galaxy and rocket league ** boring ** , no matter how much my friend have `` showed it '' me and let me borrow the game . 
  i remember that , during a local multiplayer match with friends , i defended the door with a 360 and then sommersaulted an assist . 
  everyone has crying of joy , one actually congratulated me for my role on the goal , and all i could thought at the moment was `` i want to go home and play football manager '' . 
  but i could sense this feeling of strangement a la camus , to be alone in a multitude , to found something as a foolish ordeal what to others is the end-all . 
  i found that a great topic . 
  but i ** hate ** it was published as a preview for rb4 . 
  that fact alone held back the potential of the piece , it could have been a masterful work on the strangement that one can feel to games that are considered canon or excellent by the `` community '' . 
  but because it was a preview , it had to go back and talk about rb4 . 
  in other words , the preview should have been noting more than a regurgitated press release , but later followed by a cronic of campbell and the preview event of rb4 .

  does romario 's and ronaldinho 's drunkness counts ? 
  please be undertale , ^ ^ ^ please, 
  shody ports of old games ? 
  you , you ... 
  challenge accepted, 
  5 days valve . 
  days . 
   why , with the mountains of problems steam has , would you criticize them for something they have no responsibility to take care of ? 
  shody ports of old games , not bad games ; not the same thing, 
  see , for a store to be liable either legally or ethically on the product they sell it has to be either malignant or sold under false advertisment . 
  in the case i am referring , games are beign sold under false minimum requirements , either as the requirements are of the system that will * emulate * the game and not of the game itself , or simply as said port does not operate properly even when the requirments are satisfied . 
  two example are bubsy and shadowman . 
  in the case of bubsy , you are told that it is a port of two snes , but you are given roms and snesx9 , an emulator . 
  therefore , you were sold a product under false advertisment of beign a * port * , and insted you receive and * emulation * of said game . 
  shadowman , on the other hand , is actually a port , but even when the requirements are satisfied one must perform certain operations to operate said software . 
  in the case of shadowman , one must trick the computer to play it on fullscreen and for the game to not go out of the bounds of the screen . 
  edit : i decided to explain because fuck it, 
  life is strange - episode 1, 
   anyway just comment anything below and i will select a winner at 00:00 gmt, 
  here is a comment : i just discovered my laptop can not play hotline miami 2 or bioshock infinite :(, 
  anyway , thanks op, 
  that thing still has a season pass ? 
  it 's just ... why ? 
  the dlc already come out , what does it offer ? 
  did n't we stablish that the clone army was not white since sw ii ? 
  jabba fett is played by temuera morrison , a maori new zelander with scottish descendance . 
  in fact , how the fuck does a storm trooper is ~ ~ african american ~ ~ black british since morrison is maori ? 
  oh , that explains a lot . 
  is that on the new movie ? 
  probably luis suarez . 
  chicharito , also . 
  costa , de gea , manu 's fax machine, 
  kompany , maybe ? 
  sterling . 
  russia no . 
  it is a year and a half for the world cup , very few countries could actually accomodate the wc in that time . 
  qatar , i hope yes , mostly due to the temperatures . 
   rages around `` cops '' ? 
  where are we , fucking south central la ? 
  * straight outta liverpool * by scousers with attitude ( swa ), 
  edit : mancurian is manchester, 
  thanks, 
  ~ ~ maybe sir alex fergusson , since he ended up relegating manu at some point . ~ ~, 
  my mistake , it was doucherty , who was fired due to constant fucking of the wife of the physiotherapist . 
  uhm , truly a dumb mistake of mine . 
  i ca n't seem to remember anyone here at mexico . 
  maybe el ojitos meza , but outside of him no . 
  you need more than coke for this . 
  you are a birmingham city fan , you should know . 
  sure , let me see . 
  so defense wise we are cool , nahuel guzman is a great short stopper , both ayala and juninho are great central defenders . 
  he may have some problems with jimenez and torres nilo , since the go a ton of times to the front , but they have great stamina and do return to their area after the offensive play . 
  now , the midfield is going to be his main problem . 
  see , we lost both our main cdm and his back up ( cacha arevalo and lugo ) , and the back up of the back up is erratic on his performance . 
  so he will either buy someone from neatherland or go with a 4-4-2 . 
  for the bands , probably aquino on the right and damian on the right . 
  damm is going to be pissed off to go to the bench . 
  for our two center midfielders , guido pizarro and a combination of due\u00f1as and zelayaran . 
  for the attack : gignac and sobis , maybe mancilla until he ends up running from the loan sharks for his gambling debts , or fired for using his entire season 's pay check in two months . 
  so it would be like this :, 
  aquino - guido pizzaro - due\u00f1as / zelayaran - alvarez, 
  if he wins the league in any of the next three seasons , he is going to stay for half a decade . 
  unless he fucks up one season due to playing favourites in the libertadores and making us look foolish on both tournments . 
  then he will be sacked . 
  nop , you were right, 
  1974 , but was with doucherty, 
  maybe , but then it would also be caixinha . 
  i think more of someone with one bad season and later was great,
