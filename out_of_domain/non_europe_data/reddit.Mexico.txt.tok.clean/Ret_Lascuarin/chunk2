  * and since we are now talking of old school football , what about the inventor of gambeta , and actual motor of brazil 's national team in 58 and 62 , garrincha ? 
  he must be in for his invention . 
  * and since we mention 58 , what about the player with the record of most goals scored on one world cup , justine fountain ? 
  13 goals . 
  * also from that world cup , lev yashin . 
  most of the basics of goalkeeping were originated from his style of goalkeeping . 
  * returning to brazil , what about zico and socrates , both pilars of brazil 's of the 80s . 
  both of theam were great playmakers and revolutionized garrincha 's gambeta style . 
  * for the 10th place , i decide on ronaldinho , for returning the magic of the gambeta after the dry ages of the 90s . 
  and gerd m\u00fcller , if you saw the interwiev from fifa and espn about his goals on the world cup final of 74 , you will discover the only reason he scored : instinct . 
  yes , most players rely on this , but the entire center of m\u00fcller 's style was instinct , making him just a poacher . 
  yes , shearer and matador were also poachers , but they also had skill enough to use with their instinct , m\u00fcller rely just on that . 
  was he effective ? 
  yes , but he was just that . 
  the main reason i prefer drogba than eto'o is that eto'o is just a great forward , but the versatile elements on drogba give him an edge in his favor . 
  the same here , m\u00fcller was just effective , but not excellent . 
  edits : i ** really ** suck using reddit 's format, 
  yeah ... i 'm kind of a fan of old school football . 
  it was 2 am and i made it on the fly , a lot of players were not on it mostly because my brain could not remember the names corectly . 
  specially beckenbauer . 
  what i tried to show is that m\u00fcller 's accomplishments are not that great infront of other , but apparently i sucked at explaining that . 
  he ** still ** was a substitute , i did not said that his contributions were not important . 
  and i call bull due to this :, 
   pele was injured for large portions of the 58, 
  ** yes!yes!yes!yes!yes!yes!yes!yes!yes!yes !, 
  mexico, 
  rb : paul aguilar, 
  cm : gallo vazquez and carlos pe\u00f1a, 
  st : chicharo/vuoso, 
  formation : 4-1-2-2-1, 
  kind of prefer vuoso than vela , mostly due to the tenacity of vuoso, 
  called out of being dismissive of what ? 
  pele was a substitute at the beginning of the 58 world cup , wether you like it or not . 
  considering our football , we should n't even talk about any transfer at all, 
  micronesia ... are you alright ? 
  i mean , this is already more than 200 goals for less than 5 games , are you sure you want to continue ? 
  then who is willy wonka ? 
  probably on inter , but i only remember him as the one that finished the plays at barcelona . 
  sorry for that . 
  tigres winter 2001 ( invierno 2001 ) i loved gaitan 's style . 
  true , just one more fact : tiki-taka is also an evolution of the old english football school combined with niederland 's total football . 
  at a bar , getting drunk and laughing for the return of old school football , then remembering they still have another game . 
  [ i 'm blue . 
  da ba dee dabba da-ee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68ugkg9repc ), 
  di stefano , maybe ? 
  i do n't care the downvotes , your reaction makes it worth, 
  thank you, 
  either chile + argentina or uruguay + argentina , their pride will not accept any other country, 
  really ? 
  city , you lovable bastards . 
  so its already time , huh ? 
  of all things , both raul and casillas exited from the club at the worst point in their careers . 
  thanks for all , casillas . 
  'cause ** money !, 
  so they finally sold araujo ? 
  do anyone here thinks that he may be a great player , or just another one of the bunch ? 
  wait a minute , how many forwards does manu still have ? 
  ... i need vodka to digest this, 
  here at mexico , tigres bought two strikers from europe : uche and gingac . 
  both will probably explote here :d, 
  yeah , his time at queretaro was just awful ... i still stand that he probably arrived drunk to some games, 
  have n't they sold rvp ? 
  and considering chicharito wont stay , that means two strikers ... who are they considering to buy ? 
  let 's see ... rvp is going out , chicharito wont stay ... that means it is only wilson and rooney ... they are buying someone , arent they ? 
  otherwise someone should fire van gaal, 
  no , i think that they should fire van gaal for not looking for a striker after releasing most of the strikers . 
  and after seeing what happened to real madrid , leaving the job to a striker for ** all ** the games will only injury him . 
  playing a log period of time , and winning something with the team . 
  people still remember those who won the league back at the lates 1970s . 
  oh that penalty of huntlaar ... it still hurts, 
  it kind of is , but when you already plan to let most of your strikers go , you have to plan on who to replace them . 
  but still , time will tell wether his decision was good or not . 
  from my league , probably gignac or benedetto . 
  roque santa cruz could probably be , but he is still injured . 
  considering that van gaal does not want on his team since he took it , i doubt they ask that much . 
  at most they will ask for some twinkies and dinner . 
  it is mostly to prevent extreme poachers , those who remain near the goalkeeper or between the goalkeeper and the defensive line , to exist in the games , since it would create some sort of weird game where all the strikers are near the enemy 's goalkeeper and all the defenders would be near their respective goalkeepers . 
  it ... kind of looks like a cubone, 
  considering that australia apparently sees women football so much they voted for a women to be in the fifa 16 cover , who is running for the cover in the usa version of fifa 16 ? 
  are n't the covers choose by a popularity contest , like here in mexico ? 
  yeah , that ... i do not have the book at hand at the moment , but apparently this fascination for europe and america comes all the way from the end of wwii . 
  you see , japan has this idea that you mst copy and evolve from the culture that defeats you , in this case : the allies ( urss on the north of manchuria , uk and france in their colonies , usa on the pacific ocean ) . 
  all of this cultures are connected by europe , from where they began to import . 
  the main reason that this change was so huge and almost destructive of the old japanese costumes was the death of the empire and fall of the emperor . 
  the entire social structure collapsed due to not only the fall of the emperor , but also the horror at hiroshima and nagasaki , as well as the almost extermination of japan 's army ( another pilar of japan 's culture ) ; leaving a vacuum that was filled with europe 's culture and images . 
  thats why most of the mangas , anime , videogames , light novels , and literature after the wwii are based on elements from europe , not japan . 
  as of the miixed race , it is mostly a trope to justify bouncy foregin protagonist that can speak japanese . 
  unless , of course , it is not in japan and therefore are elements to speak against japan 's adoration of the elderly by analogy . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozhxbsan9m ), 
  ` nough said, 
  here at mexico it is america and tigres , which are known for throwing money like it grows from the trees . 
  also whoever gets promoted , those teams ten to buy between 8 to 14 players and sell 6 before the season begins . 
  i ca n't read anything and the google translator is shite , could someone explain me how can an africa cup winner ** fails ** a ** medical ** ? 
  thanks, 
  i pity the fool that looks for a discussion on any hive of extermist, 
  nop , those kind of players , the garrinchas , the puskas , the messis and ronalds ( both ) are exceptions of the rule . 
  may god bless the drunk !, 
  right now ? 
  all time ? 
  garrincha , cruyff and platini,
