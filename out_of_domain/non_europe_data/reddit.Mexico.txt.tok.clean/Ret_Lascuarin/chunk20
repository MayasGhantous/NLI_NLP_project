  the last remnant, 
   if a developer lies to steam and their customers with false information on their store shelve , that is not steam 's fault . 
  you are being irrational and self-entitled . 
  grow up . 
  actually it is , since valve is giving space on their store shelve of a product with false advertisment , which makes them liable due to getting benefits of said fraudlent product . 
  i mean , how entitlement must i be to ask for a * functional * port , and insted receives a port that , to play , requires me to trick my computer or to learn programming to fix the issue ? 
  but really , what else could be asked to a man that starts with a `` do n't be retarded '' and ends with a `` grow up '' ? 
  holy shit !, 
  damn , we are rolling on cash !, 
  except when he plays against tigres and rayados . 
  what , you think that they just let you sell your product and not take a portion of it ? 
  you fool . 
  also , sorry for the images , but you sound like those guys . 
  defeated , letting everyone pass over you . 
   devs exploiting the industry by making shitty games for profit is wrong , immoral , and illegal to a degree . 
  i never said it was n't . 
  i 'm saying , you 're blaming the wrong person like a fucking idiot . 
  true , mostly it is the devs fault ho considered said product to be sellable . 
  you know who also considers that said product to be sellable ? 
  ** valve who decided not to check what the fuck are they selling **, 
  yes , they are not the main responsible for said fraudlent product , but they are participant ** to a degree by proxy ** . 
  eichmann only signed papers and checked logistics from an office , but he was stil responsible , to a degree , of the act of genocide . 
  on a same , but on a ** way ** lesser degree ( for i am talking about videogames ) , steam is responsible for the selling of * shody ports * . 
  on the subject of bad videogames , i do n't know if that enters on the same grounds than shody ports . 
  most of the good stuff will continue to exist , while the bad ones will disappear on the flood of games that are published on steam . 
  also , i erased almost all the insults i shitflinged to you of my comments , for i checked my previous comment and thought `` i ammostly beign a wanker '' sorry for that . 
  uche was a dumb idea , just as eder . 
  who thought that buying an injuried player was a good idea ? 
  as for belluschi and santa cruz , i have no idea what happened to the first one , and the second one is the same problem that we have with uche . 
   the lack of englishmen perturbs him, 
  why ? 
   bring in young european talent, 
  nah , i doubt they choose us over europe . 
  but one can dream ... 
   stop trying to blame people and just think about this pragmatically for a moment . 
  the system you are requesting , that all this data for hundreds of thousands of games be screened by employees at valve - you could be waiting months for a simple update to your games ; see microsoft . 
  it 's not realistic . 
  yes , that would be the main problem with that one . 
  damn if you do , damn if you do n't . 
  hence the impass : quick distribution of products that may not be completly , or just , fuctional or the aforementioned inmense wait of time . 
  and now the conversation returned to the image of a dog with a bone infont of his face . 
   i guess it 's a bit much to ask you to overcome your ego and un-downvote my correct information . 
  no , i actually have it upvoted since the beginning for giving source to back up your claims . 
  the last remnant, 
  because i love jrpgs , or rpgs in general , specially with good story . 
  but there is no life is strange here , ff : xiv is an mmo ( and after wow and runescape i rather not get back to those ) with a monthly suscription fee and i can barely play murdered : soul suspect on this laptop . 
   italy, 
   ultras are still causing some problems ( not as much as before thankfully ) . 
  you really should check roma 's problem with ultras, 
  fair enough, 
  no , not the toilets !, 
  why must man suffer for the anger of others , specially when it involves shitting ? 
  because tevez, 
  also rayados has funes moris , so tevez, 
  edit : we are rolling in money , so tevez is a posibility . 
  ( looks steam ), 
  it does n't even shows that it is on sale , probably an error . 
  he is my favourite of argentinian players i have seen play . 
  near palermo . 
  from my point of view , it was probably his bad attitude . 
  no , he went from boca to ~ ~ internacional de porto alegre ~ ~ corinthians and then to europe . 
  in other words , why he choose a different rute . 
  my anwser , his attitude . 
  thanks , yeah . 
  he went with mascherano , if memory serves me . 
  well , our season , and argentina 's season too , ended last month . 
  or michel , or schuster , or ronaldinho , or butrage\u00f1o, 
  its an element of my leeds united at fifa, 
  ~ ~ maybe goycochea ? 
  no idea ~ ~, 
  not a single nomination played on a club outside of europe, 
  and 13 % japanese boys/girl/sushi, 
  let me dream !, 
  i understood he prefer from his home nation ( neatherlands ) , not from the nation he is in . 
  fine ? 
  he has been jumping from team to team , right now we have it as a loan from dorados . 
  if rumors are to be believed , he was sold after asking too many advanced payments to play on casinos which are very common here at monterrey . 
  chelsea willl raise up from the ashes to get , at least , and european position . 
  indeed , most of my knowledge of his style comes from videos and newspaper articles of the 1966 wc , but most of his career is in obscurity . 
  and even after that , his style was still controversial . 
  you can read newspaper articles criticing the use of gloves by the goalkeeper or to exit the goal post . 
  even all the way to the 78 mexican season , people where getting angry that pilar exited the goal post . 
  caf\u00fa is god , that is all the knowledge you need . 
  he is the player that marcelo will never be . 
  leicester will not win the epl and lvg 's style is as offensive as it can be . 
  i am truly worried for vardy , such an explosion he was . 
  i fear for his form to fall during the second part of the season . 
  i expect the msn to improve even more . 
  could you please provide context ? 
  tigres will win all of the tournaments he is participating , including the league , being the only team to ever win the league ( short format ) 3 times . 
  we willalso buy tevez , because he is awesome . 
  he arrived injured , injured on his only game with tigres and is still injured . 
  worst than kikin , eder and zarate . 
  guido pizarro, 
  ~ ~ we did , to villareal ~ ~, 
  i have no clue wether we sold him or not . 
  sources showing he is still with tigres : [ 1 ] ( http://www.transfermarkt.es/ikechukwu-uche/profil/spieler/44027 ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.ikeuche.com/es/interior/132/biografia ), 
  partizan belgrad will be relegated because fuck it , i do n't know what else to put . 
  in conclusion , i suck at flaming . 
  like we are the best of the world .
