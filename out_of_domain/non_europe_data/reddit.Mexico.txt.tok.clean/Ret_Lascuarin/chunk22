  just look to mourinho 's anger towards the for of costa and hazard when they returned from vacations , or zoff 's with gazza about the same thing . 
  ca n't blame you, 
  age of empires i, 
  wow , that 's ... quite generous from you !, 
  happy birthday !, 
  they are asking $ 15 million for j\u00fcrgen damm , and that 's the lowest they get . 
  for pulido we were asking $ 10 million . 
  and bofo 's salary was so high that some mid-level clubs from spain backed out . 
  do n't starve , please, 
  that defense is awful !, 
  and that ball was stupidly lost !, 
  the fuck is wrong with that guy ? 
  i do n't get it , what do you meen by underwhelming ? 
  does he get money from the stream ? 
  if so , ask hism to pay his own . 
  mom works from home , so we have two modems , one for her and the other one for dad and me . 
  confront him during the stram will be awful , someone is going to record that and it would blow in the internet . 
  for a better solution , confront him after and , before the next stream , disconect the internet and do not let him get the cable . 
  it will get messy , but if what you are saying it 's true , it would eitherway get messy later . 
  probably [ kleber boas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpxiemhrosa ) at tigres , he exploded at america . 
  then just confront him , live if you want . 
  my reasoning came that there was a stream of revenue . 
  he already hate op, 
  did we play the same game ? 
  i 'm sure we did n't , i mean ... 
  we can agree it 's not good , right ? 
  lad , just read this, 
   i 'm going to comment harshly on polygon about this . 
  sjws , hear me roar . 
  does it look like he is ** not ** taking the piss ? 
   unless you 've packed your dick full of explosives , why does it matter to them what genitalia you have ? 
  did n't that almost happened ? 
  the `` c4 : d '' ? 
  here at mexico there are some games i remember :, 
   pumas vs tigrs , final 2 ^ ^ nd leg . 
  result : 4-1 ( 4-4 ) , tigres won at penalties, 
   america vs tigres , quater final 2 ^ ^ nd leg . 
  result 1-4 ( 4-5 ) , tigres went to the semifinals, 
   colo-colo vs pachuca , final of copa sudamericana 2 ^ ^ nd leg . 
  result : 1-2 , pachuca won, 
  you should also check marcelo `` loco '' bielsa , just not when he was argentina 's manager . 
  some games you should check just to get a reference on what not to do , again from mexico :, 
   amercia vs tigres , final 2 ^ ^ nd leg . 
  result : 3-0 ( 3-1 ) . 
  america won . 
  i do n't know if i should be disappointed on the pentalty kicker ( 3 penalties , ffs ) or the players who were send off , specially the ones that provoked the penalties ( 3 sent off , ffs ), 
  ~ ~ it is `` no life '' right ? ~ ~ it 's resentment , thanks op, 
  it 's the one of the blue collar worker that gets in love with a grl in a virtual reality , right ? 
  that one was a mindfuck , specially the ending . 
  * first of all , i 'll have to retire the old guard . 
  i love you , special you terry , but you are not getting any younger and recent games have demonstrated that your physical abilities are truly low . 
  about ivanovic , maybe , but i 'll still give him one more chance to stay or to go to another club . 
  * i 'll go with a 4-1-2-2-1 ( 4 defenders , 1 defensive midfielder , 2 central midfielders , 2 attacking midfielders and 1 striker ) and will prioritize crossing over passing throug the center . 
  that beign said , costa must go . 
  i 'll keep both pedro and cesc . 
  * the main priority will get some good defenders and a good striker for the system , but before start buying , i 'll check what we can use of the ** long ** list of loaned players that chelsea has . 
  after that , start buying . 
  * when buying , look for players with great ability to win headers , preferably between the ages of 25 - 29 . 
  also , look for strenght . 
  as for defenders , look for both strenght and intelligence , preferable the second part . 
  also , get some mexicans just for the hell of it . 
  * i will probably will have issues with william , after all , hazard will be on the starting xi . 
  try to calm so you can use it for the rotations . 
  * tell wegner to fuck off , once a month at least . 
  * probably going with ivanovic may be a bad idea , since he goes to much to the attack for my tastes . 
  meh , i 'll give him a chance . 
   shit , you can even recommend to burn the club to the ground then salt the earth . 
  nah , even while i was a kid , i prefered chelsea ove the madrid of raul or the barcelona of ronaldinho . 
  specially when commentators keep saying that chelsea had no `` right '' to be a called `` a great football team '' . 
  you know what ? , let me add this one :, 
  * tell the press to fuck off, 
   firstly i would sell all the mercenaries of the team . 
  costa , hazard , fabregas and matic would all be leaving the club . 
  why ? 
  for going to chelsea ? 
  play ftl , it plays like a side note to those books, 
   my money 's on cyborgs . 
  `` t-800 is on the box , he prepares to shoot to the goal but no !, 
  cyber iker manages to take the ball from his legs and now he used his sports leg model 106 with ball-bazooka integrated to send it to t-1000 , but he wasted the opportunity by sending it to the audience . 
  what a shame . '', 
  the only time that nk actually went to the knockout stages , ~ ~ getting a 4 ^ ^ th place after losing to the portugal of eusebio ~ ~ ( edit : that was urss ) . 
  also played on that wc bobby charlton , pele , gordon banks and lev yashin . 
  and we were robbed , or something like that , so say my aunt cruz who saw the games . 
  nothings new under the sun . 
  nop, 
  probably around my top 20 , though i do n't know in what posicion yet . 
  also , messi and ronaldo over pele , maradona , garrincha , zagallo , cryuff , puskas and yashin , are you kidding me ? 
  corruption apparently , also a budget way ahead of their competition . 
  i talso may have the same problem that colombia had in the 80s , considering some of their members of the board have been arrested for drug traffic . 
  let 's see , it has to be either winning the league with lucas lobos , danilinho and mancilla , winning the league with sobis , gignac and pizarro , that return leg agains internacional de porto alegre or that time we came back from a 1-3 on the global against america in the azteca stadium because fuck america, 
  i normally use record ( m\u00e9xico ) and the guardian, 
  no offense , but right now no one is the right manager to madrid . 
  just look what happened to mourinho , carlo and benitez , with a president like that no one is the ideal for the job . 
  unless you were capello and this were the 90s . 
   zidane being a manager of a big club , time to start feeling old . 
  dude , toni and rogerio ceni just retired , so did milito . 
  and this year will be the last of marquez , i 've been feeling old from last month . 
  i still ca n't wrap my head around over the buying of maxi morales . 
  what a beautiful time to see liga mx . 
  just , please , better referees , or at least some that do not consider breaking someone 's leg just a foul .
