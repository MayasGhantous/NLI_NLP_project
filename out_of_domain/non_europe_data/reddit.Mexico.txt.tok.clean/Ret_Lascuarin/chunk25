  `` it 's immoral to pay for this game '', 
  why are they even on the forum ? 
  `` look , there is hope . 
  yes , i know we are currently not that great , but things will get better . 
  also do n't see the team for the next 4 years , those are going to be bad . 
  no , trejo is not going to be a good idea and take down that chamagol poster down . 
  also gaitan is going to be a dick this next seasons . 
  so keep your head down and come back when tuca comes back , that simple . 
  yes , i know we bought some european level players , just keep it down . 
  also put money for a 7-1 against brazil in the wc 2014 semifinals , look , just do it . 
  listen to me , it will happen !, 
  and get some money for the 2014-2015 libertadores , you will be thankful for that . 
  just do n't go to buenos aires when the finals arrive , it 's not going to be pretty . '', 
  you have to explain a year , i have to explain half decade of shit results and broken hopes . 
  mate , that is common here at mexico and in some latinamerican countries, 
  his time at queretaro was ... disappointing . 
  he was mostly parting and , if rumors are to be believed , he was constantly drunk . 
  he also partied a lot , which did n't help with his already deficient form . 
  we went from beign the laughing stock of the league to the finals of libertadores and 2 league titles and only one beign the runner-up . 
  we went from walter gaitan to lucas lobos , danilinho , mancillas , salcido , sobis , pizarro , arevalo , alvarez and andre-pierre gignac . 
  just for statements ? 
  wait , rapelay ? 
  has anyone actually tried to stream ** that ** ? 
  * october 20 , 1996 . 
  developed by quintet and published by enix for the snes . 
  played on an emulator . 
  * gameplay : real-time battle , back in the day i considered to be the best mechanic ever encountered on an rpg . 
  right now , not that blown , but still interesting . 
  * main fort was the story . 
  this game is part of the * soul blazer * serie ( * soul blazer * , * illusion of gaia * and * terranigama * ) it is a rewritting of various foundations myths , mostly focousing on those about the creation of earth . 
  they also touch some existencial philosophy , since [ spoiler ] ( #s `` you also exist on your own created world '' ) . 
  also has one of the best endings i 've ever experienced on all media . 
  ** shadowrun **, 
  * may 1993 , developed by beam software and published by data east for the snes . 
  ( played on an emulator ), 
  * mechanical is quite a clusterfuck . 
  it is developed as an old-school pc game of the likes of adventures on monkey island on the snes . 
  so on the first few tries it is going to be a pain in the ass . 
  * main fort : the story . 
  based on the novel * never deal with a dragon * of charrette , which is set on the second edition of * shadowrun * tabletop version , it explores a setting that combines both cyberpunk and magical realism . 
  it 's as if gabriel garcia marquez and philip k. dick tried to write a detective novel . 
  i would also write final fantasy tactics advance , but someone did a more in-depth post of the original for ps 1 . 
  that game won me more for its mechanics than its story . 
  as for games , i 'm currently saving money whle paying mom 's medical bills to finally get a good pc to play all 3 bioshocks on it and also getting episodes 2 to 5 of life is strange and undertale . 
  new releases ? 
  no , i 'm not even looking to future releases charts just so i do n't feel bad for not playing them . 
  5 days where players may get pepper-spraied, 
  holy shit !, 
  so ... now what ? 
  his card is still property of both tigres and chivas, 
  knock him out , or at least manpower him to a taxi, 
   kino 's journey, 
  i want to read the novels ... :(, 
  * kino 's journey * is a series of novels on which the anime is based upon . 
  some of them are translated by fans and very few are official translations , but most of it is still untranslated . 
   what would happen if its found out all of these big name moves to china are being done through laundered money ? 
  is olympiakos still classifing to champions , winning the league and having board members charged with drug trafficking ? 
  there is your anwser . 
   its that , and how can these clubs afford those transfers ? 
  is every club owned by a super rich group/businessman ? 
  just the big ones , see the mls , the liga mx and the russian league . 
  only the big ones or those with super rich owners can afford such players , and those are the ones that show on the international news . 
  great , we went from corrupt to a junkie that scored a handball on a wc and poisoned players of the other side on another wc who must recently only appear on the news when he shit-talks to blatter and platini and gets on legal troubles ,, 
  you know what , can we return to blatter ? 
  pretty please ? 
  * sees next week match *, 
  fuck , we either going to lose or choke for a draw . 
  expect goals and a good show, 
  losing at the round of 16 constantly . 
  [ just do n't come home too soon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t68axsuaei ), 
  boca jrs and chelsea . 
  the first one because of martin * el fen\u00f3meno del gol * palermo , i actually saw them when i was living in buenos aires for a short while . 
  the second one came while seeing chelsea vs ( i think manu ) on tv , one of the very few times they passed premier league on mexican tv . 
  the presenter were shitting on chelsea while singing praise to the other team , saying mostly that chelsea ** did not deserve to exist ** since they had no ** tradition ** . 
  but chelsea won , so they began to say that `` football lost this day '' . 
  i was pretty pissed off to the pundints , since i liked chelsea 's football and considered their whole talk a load of bullshit . 
  since then , my love of chelsea began , mostly following their games by radio streams . 
  no , that is the way of football . 
  even the big ones can fall . 
  just see necaxa and atlante , both were some of the greatest teams to ever play on mexico through out the ages , but after years of mismanagment and , in the case of necaxa , sabotagued by their owners , they are now in liga de ascenso ( 2nd division ), 
  as for the teams you mention , newcastle . 
  best as in played good on both teams ? 
  here at monterrey it would probably be luis * matador * hernandez , sebastian * loco * abreu , * la gata * fernandez and aldo de nigris . 
  as for shit with both : rolando zarate, 
  abreu prefered basketball over football, 
   it also begs the question as to who exactly buys our knockoffs in bolivia . 
  your kits are normally good looking, 
   bolivian football , it 's something else . 
  also , your radio transmitions of football games are shit . 
  i remember hearing the away game against san jos\u00e9 an the amount of ads on the transmission was unberable . 
  it was the worst thing i 've heard on radio in my life . 
  i remember one that went with `` corner , and this corner is presented by xxxx , bla , bla , bla , we are still on the ad , bla , bla , bla , counterattack by tigres , counterattack brought you by yyyy '', 
  i just closed the stream and went to radio hyrule , to clean my ears of the ads . 
  yes!yes!yes!yes!yes!yes!yes!yes !, 
  we must not choke this one out !, 
  also , the fuck ? 
  why him ? 
  he loves offensive tactics and he builds up the team from the midfield , sounds like good enough for chile . 
  granted he is no sampaoli or bielsa , but he can do the job . 
  i remember when record had a column where you could see every mexican playing in europe and at some point it just said `` nobody played this week '' after weeks with the same situation,
