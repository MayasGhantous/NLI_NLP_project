  sampaoli or simeone , preferably sampaoli , just to have someone of bielsa 's philosophy on the epl . 
  when i saw the clips , i remembered what dad used to say about the confesor , an argentinian defender that played for america , cruz azul and toluca . 
  `` man or ball , but never together '', 
  i loved genghis khan and joan of arc , both dad and me got a ton of fun on those . 
   # 6 was also a pain as i did n't realize i could advance to imp until after i 'd finished . 
  word, 
  it 's pretty much depens on my mood . 
  sometimes i just roll with i am given , sometimes i modify to resemble me or characters of books . 
  and some with support of the penis controller, 
   the idea of franchising the fine bros brand is so ill-conceived and half-baked very unlikely anyone is going to pluck down the money for it anyway . 
  they were apparently a few people already joining with them, 
  how did it went ? 
  for those i just roll with what they offer, 
  also , terranigama and shadowrun ( both on snes ), 
  it 's a clusterfuck . 
  granted , we will only know the whole story later , but for now we have only snippets of what happened . 
  the shit show begans with an interview , without the approval of wba , given by saido , where he pretty much declares his desire to get out of wba to somewhere bigger . 
  it happened almost at the time of the sterling interview , so it only added wood to the fire . 
  this angered both the team and the fans , since he catalogued the team as `` small '' ( which in all fairness , it is a small club ) . 
  and after that the clusterfuck exploted . 
  considering that sterling was doing the same , most people assumed that they would do the sensible thing and cash the transfer . 
  but not pearce 's wba . 
  if rumors and saido 's tweets are to be believed , pearce had apparently agreed to a move , but after the interview he pretty much decided to fuck with berahino . 
  not only that , but saido went the extra mile by just taking the worst advice possible and pretty much getting into direct fights with pulis and pearce . 
  and now he is still on the bench , being the top scorer for the club and not getting into twitter fights . 
  the worst part of all this shitshow are the fans of wba , who act as if saido should kiss the shirt and never leave the club , almost like the hichas of river who accused mascherano of not remembering the hand that fed him . 
  fuck those guys , as if players having feelings and dreams outside of theirs is a crime . 
  so we will get the no-optional podcast ? 
  when asked about the scene where david cameron throatfucked a dead pig , the author said that she only let that part stay because `` that made her smile '' . 
  same thing here , but in the news . 
  and people will remember it just for the sher amusement of a guy buying hookers with his son 's money . 
  weakness : tendency of choking out , right now guzman is on a bad form, 
  strenght : possession of the ball , great offensive players both on the midifield and as strikers . 
  i do n't blame you , it 's a humor based on the bizarre, 
  good , he would fuck leicester 's run for the title, 
   sen. mary pilcher-cook , an r from shawnee , said the bill would only punish items that `` a reasonable person would find ... lacks serious literary , scientific , educational , artistic or political value . '', 
  so anything that does not align with his views . 
   this bill was spawned from a sex education teacher who had a poster in their classroom that mentioned oral sex as a way people express their sexual feelings . 
  pilcher-cook thinks children could have been irreparably harmed by viewing the poster . 
  we live on an age where getting porn is easier than ever , so get your head outta yer ass . 
   rep. john carmichael , a d from wichita , asked the committee how this law would be applied . 
  he brought up romeo and juliet containing puns of sexual activity , and michelangelo 's david , wondering if a teacher would be punished for curriculum involving either . 
  sen. mary pilcher-cook , an r from shawnee , said the bill would only punish items that `` a reasonable person would find ... lacks serious literary , scientific , educational , artistic or political value . '' carmichael pushed her on the issue and pilcher-cook ultimately stated that whether or not items like the above would fall under this umbrella would be determined by prosecutors and juries . 
   i look forward to seeing someone get hauled off to jail for trying to teach creationism . 
  i would love to see the sen. pitcher-cook trying desperately to defend creationism, 
  please leandro , do n't fuck this one up . 
  either bielsa or sampaoli, 
  i am going to comment on my favourites statements , because fuck it :, 
  lightning from final fantasy xiii, 
   genevieve : i do n't want to offend this girl ` cause she looks like a bad-ass . 
  but there 's just a lot going on . 
  the olive green , the tan , the burgundy , the black , cream , navy , yellow . 
  i 'm exhausted . 
  coco chanel 's sage advice -- `` before you leave the house , look in the mirror and take one thing off '' -- really would have come in handy here . 
  she 's making a case for belts serving as bras , though . 
  i 've easily clocked 40 hours on ff xiii and 12 on lighting returns and at no point have i ever thought that she used the belts as a bra . 
  and now i ca n't take this out of my mind . 
  adam from deus ex, 
   alexandra : adam has a look that says both , `` i 'm from the future '' and `` i came this close to catching jack the ripper in 1888 . '' you know , like a vampire . 
  i bet he plays the piano and speaks latin . 
  i am currently learning latin to qualify for a master degree on german literature . 
  therefore , i am going to translate all of his dialoge to latin and roleplay as that character . 
  or used it on shadowrun , which ever is better . 
  aiden from watch dogs, 
   lisa : he looks like any dude , anywhere , in winter . 
  except i know he 's not australian because he 's not wearing thongs . 
  the image of aiden pearce with thongs sounds funny . 
  `` stop , it 's aiden pearce , thong police , you are under arrest for-stop laughing ! '', 
  tingle from the legend of zelda, 
   lisa : tingle looks like a good time . 
  he 's clearly got confidence which could go some way towards making up for the fact that he 's wearing a lime green unitard with red undies on top . 
  ** wait . 
  i just googled and tingle is a 35-year old man obsessed with forest fairies . 
  ** hard pass , tingle . 
  yes , my young self went on the same train of thought when i read the manual . 
   justine : what even is this ? 
  it looks like something from my childhood nightmares ... with a terrible sinus infection . 
  the playground theory was that he was satan on disguise . 
  samus from metroid, 
   lisa : her suit looks like those aerodynamic unitards swimmers wear at the olympics . 
  great accessories , ** although can someone please explain why game designers think heels are appropriate footwear for kicking butt ? 
  ** ( unless her super power is sitting in an uber all day . ), 
  yes , i 'm not the only one !, 
  quiet from metal gear solid v, 
   genevieve : yes , she 's covering her private parts with miniscule scraps of material . 
  yes , her tights are upsettingly holey . 
  yes , this outfit is completely inappropriate for everything , ever . 
  but she 's got cool combat boots on , and a bangin ' body -- why should n't she show it off ? 
  you know what 's really letting her down here ? 
  her greasy hair . 
  girl , take a shower . 
  savage !, 
  before everyone opens the champange and began celebrating , this does not mean that the matter has been resolved . 
  she only won 2 counter-sues from dr. luke , one on the grounds of not being under the jusrisdiction of the judge ( the one against kesha 's mother ) and the other on the grounds of kesha 's manager acting as the manager of kesha . 
  kesha 's mother still faces another counter-sue on tennessee , where she lives and where the same argument of the defendant may not work , and ** she still ca n't produce music ** . 
  so , just do n't get your hopes high , for now . 
  they are playiing the libertadores , and they need to win at el cilindro against the independiente de avellaneda with milito, 
  so that is why the signal was kind of broken on azteca 7, 
  quick question , did someone else choose ** not ** rocket league in any of the categories that game participated ? 
  i am going to sound like an ass , but who is veerender ?
