  no offense , but i found the doom one slightly funny . 
  it reminded me of a friend who did something like that when a ton of people went to the macroplaza after tigres reached the final . 
  still , offensive, 
  still funny , i 'll try it out, 
  though times , sir/lady , though times call for extreme measures, 
  i have to go with yandere dev on this one , i was expecting more edginess from the edgelords themselves , but that would require skills and hardwork ... 
  we 'll keep the tacos and chipotle , and also the mezcal and tequila, 
  i was going to comment , but some of you have put well-thought comments good enough to make any contribution from my part to be redundant , but i 'll make a quick update on the-place-that-shall-not-be-named :, 
  just , do n't go, 
   ** allow goalkeepers off their own goal line , but require them to stay within their six-yard box . 
   this is a logical progression . 
  we currently disallow goalkeepers from leaving their goal line because it 's an `` unfair '' advantage . 
  the status quo already puts goalkeepers in extraordinarily disadvantageous situations . 
   by removing this constraint , we will decrease the overall conversion rate of penalty kicks . 
  it 's difficult to speculate exactly what the new conversion rate will be , but i 'd imagine it will rest somewhere between 55 % -70 % . 
  still a remarkably valuable situation , but not quite as lopsided as before . 
  you do realize it is called `` penalty kick '' because it is a fucking ** pe-nal-ty ** against the team that commited a foul on the box . 
   this adjustment will have a cascading effect that will ripple across the game . 
  with less of a potential reward , diving attempts should decrease . 
  of course not , it would only make fouls on the box less risky , allowing the defenders to play more dirty . 
  pablo montero wont be the excpetion , he would be the standard . 
  we would make leeds united of the 70s look dull . 
   this also removes the ever-contentious situations where a goalkeeper `` may have or may not have '' stepped off their line a bit too early . 
  referees would welcome this change with open arms . 
  it would not help the referees , it would creat more dificulties with wether the keeper was in or out the box when they blocked the shot . 
  `` logicla progression '' my ass , logical progession would be technology and better ways to punish divers , not incentives dumbfuckery . 
  since it may be behind a paywall for some , here it is the full text :, 
   ** soccer flare-ups are only part of the problem for the sport **, 
   soccer 's a-league has a massive problem -- some of its fans are so badly behaved they should be banned from sporting stadiums across the country . 
  too many excuses are proffered to justify all the flares and vandalism that took place during the melbourne victory versus western sydney wanderers game at etihad last saturday night . 
  soccer may be the `` world game '' but it 's a world we can do without here . 
   aged 10 , i decided to give soccer a try . 
  much to the chagrin of my aussie rules-obsessed father , for two years i attempted to master the round-ball code at box hill juniors . 
  if truth be told , i was never much good at the game . 
  unlike footy , or either of the rugby codes , soccer favours finesse over toughness , a deft touch over intestinal fortitude . 
  but i gave it a go . 
  and for many years afterwards i enjoyed watching it on tv . 
   my affection for soccer began to wane when i lived in england in the early 1990s . 
  signs outside my local team 's ground directed away supporters into one gate , while home fans entered via another . 
  when i asked why such segregation was necessary , i was told allowing fans to mix was a recipe for disaster . 
  fights would inevitably break out and the police lacked the numbers to deal with large-scale violence . 
   as a consequence , most uk soccer stadiums back then separated opposing supporters with wire fences . 
  thus far the a-league has avoided such physical barriers , but fans from opposing teams are still kept apart . 
   and , in keeping with their british counterparts from 25 years ago , victoria police says soccer matches require far more law enforcement resources than other codes . 
   as far as i know , only soccer has this problem . 
  at afl games , fans from both teams sit together more or less peacefully . 
  the same occurs at rugby union , where polite applause often replaces vigorous barracking . 
   and even the world 's toughest football code , rugby league , has no issues with opposing supporters mingling with each another . 
  why is soccer so different ? 
   flares are another blight on the round-ball code . 
  for more than 30 years now , fireworks have been banned from victorian backyards because they 're a menace to both adults and children . 
  marine flares burn hotter than most crackers and can be lethal if ignited near someone 's face . 
  yet a-league idiots persist in smuggling them into stadiums and letting them off . 
   saturday 's clash at etihad was halted temporarily by the referee because more than a dozen lit flares filled the arena with smoke . 
  how does that kind of idiocy -- which has since cost wanderers $ 50,000 with the threat of a three-point deduction -- add to a sporting spectacle ? 
  when i attend a football match , i want to see players strut their stuff . 
  in contrast , flare-loving western sydney fans do n't appear to care about the match . 
  rather , they prefer lighting illegal fireworks , removing their shirts and chanting puerile slogans like `` we 're not here to take part . 
  we 're here to take over ! '' . 
   soccer supporters are possessed by many grievances and conspiracy theories . 
  for example , many of them get very upset at use of the term `` soccer '' to describe their game . 
  `` it 's football ! '' they cry . 
  `` the only true football ! '' i 've got some unfortunate news for round-ball aficionados . 
  the correct name for their game is actually `` association football '' , a named coined in 19th-century england to distinguish the code from rugby football ( which has now evolved into both rugby union and rugby league ) . 
  the `` soc '' bit of `` association '' is how the term `` soccer '' evolved . 
  and let 's not forget australia 's national `` football '' team is nicknamed the `` socceroos '' . 
   and as to which football is the `` true '' code , the laws for aussie rules were first written down in 1859 , four years before the round-ball game established its own rules . 
   another big issue soccer fans have is an alleged vendetta by the so-called afl-madherald sun against their sport . 
  what nonsense . 
  through informing and entertaining , the herald sun 's main aim is to sell as many papers and online subscriptions as possible to readers . 
  if lots of people become soccer supporters , then the herald sun will devote more column inches to it , even though in my opinion it already covers the code brilliantly . 
   apart from the poor behaviour of its fans , soccer has a couple of other major deficiencies . 
  first is its scoring , or lack of it . 
  no matter what the sport , viewers like to see plenty of goals , tries and runs . 
  that is why in cricket the big-scoring twenty20 format is proving so popular at the expense of the tired 50-over version . 
   in contrast soccer is plagued by 0-0 draws , which prove frustrating for many of its fans . 
  how else to explain their habit of lighting flares , vandalising stadium seats and chanting at each other rather than watching the game ? 
  if soccer provided better entertainment , spectators might devote more of their attention to what 's happening on the pitch . 
  ways to increase scoring include expanding the size of the goals , getting rid of the silly offside rule and perhaps even eliminating the position of goalkeeper . 
   faking injuries in return for dubious free kicks is another blight on the round-ball game . 
  football players of all codes are supposed to be tough . 
  yet week in , week out in soccer i see grown men lying on the ground screaming like babies until a magic free kick instantly restores them to full health . 
  referees , players and fans seem to accept this idiocy . 
   for people who appreciate aussie rules and rugby , such feigned weakness detracts massively from soccer 's appeal . 
   with a few changes the a-league can prosper alongside other codes . 
   first , fan stupidity must be stamped out . 
  that means any time a flare is let off in a designated supporters ' area , their team should forfeit points for both the current game and at least one more match . 
  that will soon cure pyromaniac fools of their obsession with illegal fireworks in confined spaces . 
   second , the game itself must toughen up . 
  fewer free kicks and more goals will reduce spectators ' obvious frustration . 
  every other sporting code understands that constant entertainment and action is what crowds demand . 
   finally , obsessive supporter groups like the western sydney wanderers ' `` red and black bloc '' ( ie , those probably responsible for last saturday 's flares ) should be forced to sit alongside fans of opposing teams . 
  after all , if their team wins , bloc members will have the immediate pleasure of seeing downcast looks on the faces of their adjacent opponents . 
  and when the wanderers lose -- which is inevitable -- supporters might also learn an emotion called humility . 
  something that 's presently lacking in certain a-league crowds . 
   ** tom elliott is drive-time host on 3aw weekdays 3pm-6pm **, 
  as for my opinion , i found his thesis on why does football fans are sometimes so extremist interesting , but some of his arguments and most of his `` solution '' are completly stupid and damaging to the sport . 
  his main solution is to make football for aggressive and more `` offensive '' . 
  you know who was like that and nobody like them ? 
  detroit pistons , nobody liked them on the nba .
