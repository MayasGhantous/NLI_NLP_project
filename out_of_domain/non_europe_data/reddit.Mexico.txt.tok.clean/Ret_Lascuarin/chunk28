  in fact , most of his `` solutions '' are to embrace cricket and rugby , considering that the abundant of scoring and the `` thoughing-up '' of the league . 
  it is weird to attempt to combine those two , considering that the rule set as complex as a paper of string theory and as arcaic as using australia as a penal colony . 
  in fact , to consider the offside rule `` silly '' while using cricket as an example makes him look like a complete idiot . 
  on the matter of rugby , not everyone likes a sport where eye-gouging is an actual problem and where you may get your ballsack raptures . 
  you know , sadism is not something that football fans look forward to . 
  and look , there are people that likes this , just as there is people that loves to get tied up or flogged like a catholic masturbator , but not everyone loves it . 
  and while , yes , it is frustrating to get a nil nil draw , that does not make the sport boring . 
  boring is when san antonio was 40 points above cleveland , what 's the point to see the game that relies so much on teamwork and tactics when scoring is cheap ? 
  not only that , most of the goal are going to be midfield , so it would make the game even moring boring . 
  as for the last point , it is completely stupid . 
  they wont learn humility , they would get into fights and at the end humillation would be won by the losers of the fight , regardless of the game . 
  in conclusion , half is interesting , the other half was written by an imbecile . 
  wait , there is a powerpuff girls reboot ? 
  there.is.a.powerpuff.reboot . 
  #thereisapowerpuffgirlsreboot !, 
  what do you consider `` bad guys '' and `` good guys '' ? 
  whenever i see somthing like this , i remember a quote attributed to tuca ferreti when talking about victor manuel `` el rey midas '' vucetich :, 
  * `` due to our profession , one must keep the bags always ready , ... '', 
  but never a princess, 
  i am not saying they were n't , because they were ( have around 14 vhs with recorded games of detroit ) , but they were n't ** universally ** liked as was la or boston, 
  that would be an excellent rebuttal ... to a white power sympathizer, 
  anything is valid as a method for story telling , that is one of the bases of modern narratology theory . 
  wether is good or bad , it depends on the writer and on the reception of the work . 
  it 's that bad ? 
  you clearly have not seen what modern narrators get away with , since greentext is seen as somewhat orthodox to them, 
  it never gets old, 
  nice analysis on the '86 wc, 
  some shadowrun games , not that good but i have put 20 hours on the first and around 40 ours to the second , just to play as an elf decker with high charisma . 
  also , aoe ii and final fantasy tactics advance, 
  goddamit , the price of his books is going to fucking skyrocket !, 
  i am currently playing a shadowrun game , and there is a part on the lore on how corporations become so big that they are now ( on the game ) more important than the people , and their workers are called wageslaves . 
  and i think , `` shit will never get this bad '' . 
  sony 's entire legal argument reads as a corporation of shadowrun , and that puts shit on a whole different level , because it is now a precedent of the rights of the individual against the rights of a corporation . 
  and not only that , we got the shitty version of shadowrun . 
  hence , shitty . 
  * 1 . - undertale, 
  * 2 . - pillars from eternity, 
  * 3 . - duck game, 
  number 17, 
  probably she meant it as a class privilege , since most of the safe spaces are commonly associated with places where upper-middle class or above live or work . 
  her entire rant is a clash between the old left and the new left of byung-chul han . 
  sorry , but i disagree with the tweets . 
  so far my memory goes , quality of the work is not a factor on wether a work of parody and/or review falls under fair use . 
  in fact , even beign funny is not a factor on the same matter . 
  in other words , you may ( please god no ) take the entire footage of femfreq talk ( please god no ) , redubbed it with sexist , transphobic , racist , antisemitist , unfunny jokes ( please god no ) and be protected by the law . 
  i doubt it , fun is subjective . 
  is it morally and/or ethically wrong ? 
  ** yes !, 
  ** does it fall under fair use ? 
  yes . 
  the biggest gray area on youtube are with let 's plays and walktroughs , and it is something that requires fixing . 
  as for the system of youtube , it is so broke that just recently ihe was hit with two claims , and began to lost money since it was being monetize by a company with no rights of the material that ihe was accused to infringe upon . 
  why do people like rocket league ? 
  both on ps4 and pc , alone , online and couch multiplayer with different sets of friends . 
  and i have yet to find any semblance of fun . 
  so long they can demonstrate that the redub is parody , they are protected . 
  i had to google the machinima thing . 
  no idea where they fall , it is transformative , but whether does fair use protect them or not is another matter . 
  one of the commentators at fox 2 called man u a `` machine '' , my only thought was `` yeah , with windows vista installed '', 
  none of my friends enjoy shadowrun , both tabletop or videogames, 
  here comes the kicker , i love ** love ** football , both irl and on games . 
  i have poured hundreds of hours on fifa , fm and pes , mostly fifa , and i still ca n't get any fun with rocket league, 
  what about windows nt ? 
  needs more f-words there . 
  you could , that 's apparently how desert-whatever their name was made their youtube money . 
  that was interesting . 
  imo , they should concentrate more on the recognition of japan 's crimes during wwii than on manga , anime and videogames . 
  but considering japan 's current leading political party , it 'll be easier to make kim davis to sign a marriage license to a gay couple than that . 
  not me , i can barely run specs op on my lap, 
   does n't japan have a law that censors penises ? 
  hence , tentacle porn . 
  they have a law that censors dicks and vags , but allows penetration of any kind , bar the usual suspects . 
  ... it seems familiar , but the name is lost to me . 
  i 'll go with aoe 2 , and let 's please decide which campain . 
  i vote either for mongols or france, 
  what the hell happened to the argentinan league ? 
  zone 1 and 2 ? 
   it 's a temporary thing ( one-off iirc ) in an attempt to have a near-decent league format without suddenly relegating ten teams to make it back at 20, 
  ... what the fuck happened ? 
  what about a quick poll on time available to dedicate on gaming and consoles owned by the users ? 
  just to know where we stand and what type of games are more accesible to play and discuss . 
  yeah , rub it in , why do n't you ? 
  shit man , i do n't think that knife has enough salt and lemon on it . 
  understandable , i would do the same since i experienced an around 30 years drought of titles , so one must milk every single thing the best one can . 
  edit : i 'm not that old , born '93, 
  on international level ? 
  #no , that 's hugol, 
  on national squad level ? 
  #no , that 's rafa marquez, 
  on national league level ? 
  #no , but close, 
  on ( recent ) america ^ ^ chinguensumadre, 
  nop , ni idea de \u00e9l . 
  ... first repair you sentence , it makes no fucking sense . 
  hey , the team that is connected with trafficking heroin , match-fixing , and has barely any competition has won their 43rd title . 
  on other news , water is wet and arsenal will not win the title . 
  loz : mm , just to reenact the commercial !, 
  or just go with games with arcadic mechanics or fighting games . 
  and i do n't know if they sell those on usa , but here at mexico people rent or sell arcades that not only play arcade games , but also consoles games and are programmed to either give time per quarters or lives , wether as loses on sports games or normal lives . 
  i still have tons of this disks lying around in boxes , specially those that came with motherboards .
