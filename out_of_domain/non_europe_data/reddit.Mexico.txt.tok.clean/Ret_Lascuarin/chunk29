  just checked a video , it 's this one . 
  same aesthetics , same mechanics , same overlay . 
  thank you . 
  tb , you suck as a fascist, 
  goddamit , you idiotic economy of mine , why have you forsaken me on this times of needs and desires !, 
  and b, 
  i was about to ask about this game on this subreddit , thank you . 
  you never left the colors, 
  veracruz - ** draw ** - atlas, 
  for tigres it is the next three :, 
  * gignac : he scores almost all of our goals . 
  he is becoming the new gaitan . 
  i just hope he does n't end as gaitan . 
  * nahuel : he is having right now a drop on quality , but he was one fo the main reasons of most of our runs , including the 2015 libertadores and our recent championship . 
  * pizarro : here is where some people will disagree with me . 
  i consider that he has become the main source of balls to both our wingers ( damm and aquino ) and our strikers ( gignac and sobis ) . 
   i know a lot of people say that the expectations/hype ruined the game a bit , but i think the game did what it could given the hardware . 
  was still one of the first games i played that had an interesting ( if straight-forward ) morality systems , along with a character growth and aging system . 
  it was neat to watch them grow from childhood into old age . 
  ** this . 
  back in the day , the only places that sold ( very overpriced , i might add ) pc games was office max and sam 's club , and this was one of the few games i. . . uh ... ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ borrowedwithoutpermission :p ... 
  anyway , i loved the game . 
  the fact that i had absolutely no expectations , and my love to multiple endings and morality systems pretty much sold me to the game . 
  there were some problems , especially with the combat and the history is a bit cliched , but it still holds up . 
  if only molyneaux was n't such an idiot when talking to the press ... 
  i will just comment this ( not entering , have the first and can not play the second due to shitty specs ) dragonfall is better than shadowrun returns both on mechanics and on story . 
  i ca n't play fucking bioshock and it barely runs spec ops : the line, 
  also , the thing below the lap ? 
  the fan of the lap has died , so i got an external one . 
  #yes !, 
  thanks, 
  still , you have a better procesor than me, 
   inb4 someone has such a bad setup , they ca n't even play the game ** and therefore wins the giveaway ** . 
  ftfy,

  so , only comment ? 
  ok , thanks for the giveaway, 
   and they lash out at the groups their right-wing media 's programmed them to lash out at , and thus made trump into a sort of rallying figure . 
  nah , i really do n't think that they just hat because of the right-wing media . 
  it is mostly just them beign resentful of the apparent wealth their country lives on , while they are replaced with cheap labor on other countries , destroying their way of living . 
  as a paraphrased quote of evo morales says : `` to mantain the ideals , you have first ensure the bread '', 
  because the ones that are replacing them are the mexicans that work for less than the minimal . 
  oh man , whatever happened to your striker ? 
  oh , that 's right . 
  he is our main striker and top scorer of the league . 
  and it was probably fake, 
  yes you are , yes you are . 
  there are hundred of things that i have never expected in my life . 
  tb/limp bizkit is one of them . 
  she rarely talks about sports . 
  well shit, 
  true , but it is still not something that is normally covered by her news organization .

  we dwellers prefer dying on megaton than to get pissed by a dog on real life . 
   rocket league ** and kerbal space program ** over undertale, 
  you disgust me, 
  you ... you ... you complete idiot !, 
  no woder they lost !, 
  the entire strategy was to attack gawker media 's morals as a news organization and you make that kind of joke ?

  ouya , anyone ?

  my reasons are not due to gameplay or graphics :,
