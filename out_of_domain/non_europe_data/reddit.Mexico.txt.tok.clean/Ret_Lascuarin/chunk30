   in some ways , it is comforting to know that skynet is not here to kill all humans , it aims to just shitpost online . 
  oh , clark and dick would be so mad with us . 
  i put twenty on alcohol and ten on public indecency, 
  super hot, 
  yes , monterrey nl born and raised, 
  in what team does he play ? 
  can we buy him ? 
  in all seriousness , kind of good , since most of the reserve are from our academy , with due\u00f1as and rivas beign common sights at the starting xi . 
  but we do n't produce players like chivas , pachuca and even rayados . 
  and in mongolia 's first league ? 
  bullshit , chicago style pizza is actual pizza , the rest is shit smeared on bread and cheese, 
  he was , he also finished medical school while playing . 
  how drunk were they when they made this venn diagram ? 
    2 inch thick cheese pie, 
  i choose what it is right !, 
  i sincerly loved huniepop , it was a good parody of ** a lot ** of visual novels , both on their mechanics , their dialogue and their cliches . 
  it was something unexpected that understood how ridiculous the entire thing was ( i mean , the endgame is to flip the switch to be an * alpha male * after banging an alien and a goddess who went to some sort of gods acadmy ) . 
  but this looks just ridiculous , and not even the funny side . 
  it makes fun of the facebook games , but it looks more like a quick cash in of their previous game than something worthwhile . 
  was n't it the corpse with the caption * daddy i 'm home * and likewise ? 
  funny , an scottsman using an unicorn , their national animal , on a serious matter . 
  does gabriel rivera count ? 
  the unicorn is the national animal of scotland , the dev is '' a wee bit scottish '' and it was used on a serious matter . 
  there is nothing else , i just founded it kind of funny . 
   oh yeah i get to shine here . 
  a lot of otome games just tend to be generic visual novels , kind of frustrating to play through . 
  go on . 
  are n't they horny enough ? 
  moviebob has 3 episodes of the big picture dedicated to why was kevin smith such a big deal and why is he so relevant to the generation x. 
  the tl ; dr version is that he represented said generation due to the references he added to the film ( i.e. 
  the discussion about star wars on clerks ) , but after the failure that was jersey girl , mostly caused due to the negative press of gigli , he retreated to his old fandom and became what he is now . 
  by your comment , i infer that he was drunk , so i got atleast the drunk part, 
   i also have absolutely no excuse for liking huniepop . 
  the thing of huniepop is that you require an strong baggage on japanese otaku culture , specially on visual novels and eroges . 
  for someone that does not have said baggae , the lampooning of mechanics , themes , tropes and characters and it just seems creepy . 
  the only thing that disappoint me was the lack of a lampooning of school days . 
  this is the 70th comment :d, 
  also , poor girls , her tits are going to be all over the internet for like a month . 
  you were not prepared , for you have only played decent to good vn . 
  hp only lampoons the worst of the worst : shitty and morally bankrupt erogues . 
  that marseilles fan has discovered the true meaning of hopelessness . 
  at least the on the europa league brackets , unless they fuck up the next transfer window . 
  with goku eating too many le big macs, 
  and that changes wwe how ? 
  no offense intended , but i pretty much stopped seing wwe since the retirement of stone cold and only watch when mankind is on . 
  he is on raw once in a while, 
  porn money ? 
  he only has that reputation on places where they had yet to suffer the war on drugs ( oaxaca and mexico city ) , everyone else knows that he is as bad as the any other capo . 
  for what i understand , mostly academic texts and academic editions of works , for example : a critical edition of anaximandro with more material than what we have currently . 
   link has ~ ~ always ~ ~ mostly been a different person in the same legacy that does not specify the gender of the hero . 
  so far my memory , link is referred as a boy in the game in link to the past , ocarine of time , majora 's mask , windwaker and in the gb games . 
  in fact , link beign male is a big part on the lore of loz . 
  i hope this is just a rumor . 
  see , the hero as a male is a common trope on medieval literature , since the gender carries a lot on the mythical level . 
  link as a male refers as a element in a cycle of destruction and rebirth , just as a medieval epic . 
  link beign a female would bring an entire transvaloration of values , like the figure of the messiah of benjamin , starting a new brave world by the destruction of an entire timeline . 
  it would be one of the greates narrative ever to be presented in a videogame . 
  and this would just kill that entire opportunity for a reinvention of hyrule . 
  it is mostly considered male due to the tropes on medieval epic , as well as what was established on skyward sword . 
  the idea of link beign a girl brings a lot of narrative possiblities to the table , and i am interested in a destruktion of the narrative . 
  hence my aversion of link 's gender as a choice given to the player . 
   i would say the bigger part of the lore is zelda being a woman, 
  that 's a given . 
  if they gender swamp her just as the rumor says about link 's gender , nintendo would have riots on the streets . 
  van gaal sounds like he just wants to keep the viagra money to himself . 
  wow , what a fucking train wreck . 
  i 'm impressed they actually managed to finish it . 
  also , `` everyone had amnesia '' ? 
  and here i thought that jontron was comedy and not journalism . 
  ** fifa 12 **, 
  i know , there are better games that i have yet to play , but i just love to mess in manager mode . 
  right now i put the best players of liga mx on tigres and i am right now on 3rd place of the bundesliga by mostly counter-attacking with rojas , suazo and delgado . 
  my main complaint is that the budget is pretty much frozen , no matter what you do . 
  something that did not happen on fifa 07 . 
  as a side note , dad loved the intro of fallout , but found the game boring . 
   jet set radio future, 
  is n't this on steam ? 
  you have to understand that the pc market at japan is pretty small , and most of the business decisions made by sega executives revolve around japan 's videogame market . 
  so for them , porting to pc is not a priority . 
  as for sonic , that sells mostly due to name recognition , so they would approve almost everything that comes out of sonic . 
  so no sweet soul brother on steam , then ? 
  do you hear that ? 
  that is the sound of a 1000 conspiracy nuts smashing their keyboards in an attempt of finding `` the truth '' . 
  `` this is happening , now we are going to report about teams that actually matter . '', 
  look for the world ends with you, 
   there is basically no second hand market for pc games . 
  there ** was ** one , i used to go to pulgas and get pc games for under 100 mxn pesos . 
  the digital market , p2p and torrents killed it . 
  are n't dota and cs more toxic ? 
  yes , but lol is atleast kind of regulated . 
  dota 's insults are ... bizarre . 
  like that guy that was for like 15 min writing in the comments on how he was going to `` rape us with his horse '' . 
  and cs is weird . 
  or maybe he is actually into that, 
   but maybe that 's because i play on low rank in europe . 
  once rank is involved , shit gets nasty, 
  the fuck is that ? 
  how is it even an insult ? 
  and what was his/her problem with mollusk , anyway ?
