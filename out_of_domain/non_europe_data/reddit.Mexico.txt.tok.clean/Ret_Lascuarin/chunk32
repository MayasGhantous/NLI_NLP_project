  no , they just boxed anything brown as mexican , even when mexicans come in a lot of colors . 
  same thing with muslims, 
  and as a mexican , i found stupid beign boxed with a bunch of nations , you fuck, 
  they wont , but they will take a piece of the market away from steam , which apparently is great according to modern econometrics theory, 
  i recommend you to see yahtzee 's zp of the game . 
  as for the treatment of asian 's on the game , it is kind of better . 
  but there is so much you can do with a license of a game born in the aftermath of the neo-japanophilia of the 80s and the explosion of the new wave of mature anime in the 90s from the developers of duke nukem 3d . 
  if you go to the old game , expect juvenile humor and exotiziation of the east on a well tuned doom clone . 
  it looks like the same thing that happened to ihe : massive false flagging of a video or several . 
  a few things :, 
  * while the salary looks small for industry standards on the first world , it is the standard pay of office workers on a mid-size company ( 200 * 17.5 = 3500 pesos ), 
  * also , life at mexico city is heavyly subsidized . 
  like , 80 % on electricity and water . 
  so the salary is about high as it gets on mexico . 
  this policy that only applies on mexico city has caused quite a response on almost every state of mexico , with phrases like `` haz patria , mata un chilango '' beign vox populi . 
  * also , the tax thing is common on the new generation of trust fund babies and sons of rich at condesa , so no surprise there . 
  on another note , i live near them . 
   and last i checked , industry standard salary for a game dev was over $ 60,000 , not $ 2,400 . 
  i doubt that even televisa pays 1,050,000 monthly to game developers on one of the most subsidized cities on the world , where they get extremly mad that the metro went from 3 pesos to 5 pesos while verywhere is around 10 to 15 pesos . 
  he still does n't want to recognize japan 's war crimes at china , the fucker . 
  he is like a japanese donald trump , just with more delusions of granduer ( he thinks that japan must return to the philosophy of the samurais ) . 
  just quick note to the article :, 
  japanese is a language with very few insults , so this :, 
   `` disgusting '' and `` these creatures should never have been born '' are typical of the comments suffered . 
  should be measured as some of the worst that one can muster on said language . 
  i should have taken french in highschool . 
   in context : stupid thing you do knowingly because why not . 
  driving all the way to england just to see leicester , pl champions , play a game and drink yourself into oblivion = display of manhood . 
  so ... basically any normal weekend, 
  and lose to chelsea, 
   ** 2012 champions league semi finals ** * chelsea vs barcelona * the match when park the bus became famous , this match was a classic . 
  drogba scoring in the first leg getting a 1-0 lead at the bridge and the second match after going 2-0 down , 10 men down , when ramires scored that chip over valdes , it was ecstatic . 
  more to remember was how chelsea sat behind the whole 90 minutes , messi missing a penalty and still unable to score against chelsea , rdm getting an immortal status , it seemed written in stars they will win this time , and obviously how can one forget the torres goal in the end . 
  oh man , what a game . 
  yes, 
  dunno man , those millons sales look very alive to me, 
   i mean what 's next , trump forms a secret police that will hunt down any trump nay sayers ? 
  so they will disappear because they think he 's a joke ? 
  said police force shall be directed by a gay stripper, 
  the industry standard in pesos is 1,050,000 pesos monthly , that is the prices of a mid-size apartment at a middle class neighborhood . 
  not even televisa would pay that much, 
  you do n't getyellows for shit talking to other players , you get for responding with physical attacks . 
   but the puppies seriously think that is hugo-worthy ? 
  both bunch of puppies normally nominate people from their cliques and agendas , regardless of quality of the work . 
  to have him on the ballot by a campaign from vox day is not a surprise . 
  on a side not that is not related to this thread , could you please explain the flair ? 
  please ? 
  thanks,

  [ hello darkness , my old friend ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zlfcngvel4 ), 
  de graafschap scored a header from a corner, 
  and they are singing pointed sisters , nice, 
  jose luis trejo ( campeon con pachuca ) , tolo gallego ( campeon con toluca ) , jose pekerman y daniel guzman ( campeon con santos ), 
  it even looks like a fifa glitch, 
  chamagol and luis garcia, 
  maybe kikin ? 
  was zarate great ? 
  he was shit with us, 
  this game had it all : hope , controversy , drama , meltdown and whatever was that from moreno . 
  as a tigre fan who have seen the same thing as you , all i can say is : `` i feel your pain '', 
  the water tempel is easier than playing against sevilla, 
  i expect nothing from a game whose entire premise is `` birdie smash piggie '', 
  even mortal kombat has more plot, 
  they probably going to start with mario , but a majoras mask or twilight princess would be great . 
   `` we should be here in cannes next year with the finished film . . '', 
  headline in september :, 
  #flashflood , electromagnetic storms and a llama appear at terry gilliams don quixote set, 
  probably dr. strangelove , since thte cold war is over and the enemies are know more fractured and faceless . 
  boogie has a page where he explains the relevance of the exiostance of an eternal enemy . 
  and just look at * toys * , it was a product of the cold war ( it was written on 1979 ) , but it was released on 1992 , when almost everything that the movie speak off had either collapsed or was on the brink off . 
  i prefer movies over theater , since , from my perspective , a filmmaker has more control over the universe and over the audience than the writer or director at an theater piece . 
  i literally imagined that he would end the interview with an ** i 'll be back ** , schwarzenegger style, 
  [ jajajajaja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owdozblkdj4 ), 
  essien to mexico ? 
  oliver kahn would be proud of you, 
  has marco fabian been really bad for you ? 
  he has the same problem as david luiz : they are too keen to play offensively , sometimes without actually considering the gap they left at the defense . 
  it is not bad for a team as barcelona , but even then it tends to cause problems for mascherano . 
  in any other team he would collapse the entire formation . 
  why ? 
  wow , just wow, 
  his entire feed reads like some of the worst of / pol / ; not / b / , / pol /, 
  wow, 
  though , i am now feeling guilty again for [ this one , ( cw : rally disgusting joke , antisemitism ) ] ( https://twitter.com/agenttimothy/status/733359737425829889 ) because i actually did it to a jewish friend . 
  after he gave me some gardening tools for my birthday , with a note that said : `` you can thank me for the job later '', 
  it is either maradonas goals at 1986 wc , the last goal of the miracle of bern or people ( englsihmen , of course ) calling pele overrated at any missed chance durng the 1966 wc, 
  recent cruz azul , they have a tendency of bottling up at the worst time , and losing almost every final theyre been . 
  most recently , they lost their classification to the liguilla at the last game . 
  here at mexico theyre were a lot , specially after peru 2005 sub-17 wc . 
  some examples are luis angel landin , from pachuca . 
  he wqas one of the first promising youngsters from pachucas academy . 
  from cruz azul were galvan and villaluz , they are now playing of second division . 
  in fact , most of the squad from the sub-17 that won the wc played at their peak at mexicos second division . 
  how did it went ? 
   but oh well nobody cares about the 3rd goalie . 
  indeed, 
  capitalism , 1st world domination and consolidation of said dominance as the status quo . 
  dat booty of hummels, 
  btw , my heart goes to anyone that has to suffer directtv 's as a standard on tv commentary . 
  i believed recent televisa was shite,
