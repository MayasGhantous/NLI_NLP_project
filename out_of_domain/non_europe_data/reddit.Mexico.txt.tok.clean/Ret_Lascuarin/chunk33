  `` darling , think of our marriage . '', 
  jesus fuck , i need a better stream, 
  stickied , will be the first one no matter what configuration you have on the comments, 
  coman and kagawa are going on , this is going to get interesting, 
  [ are this one okay ? 
  [ for every dortmund fan ] ( http://www.suicide.org/hotlines/international/germany-suicide-hotlines.html ), 
  they killed the camera !, 
  [ for all dortmund 's fans ] ( http://www.suicide.org/hotlines/international/germany-suicide-hotlines.html ), 
  camo , man !, 
  still surprised ove the lack of subs by pep , i expected coman before the first extra half and xabi ready for the penalties . 
  if it were n't for the headline , i would totally think they were shooting a poor man 's version of the virgin mary, 
  he will be reporting it from ny , but it was easier to sell the lie of `` he ran with the money '' . 
  it would fall under religious fearmongering, 
  welcome back, 
  `` germany had a great blitz through france defense , completly conquering them . 
  they reach this stage after splitting the points and the teams of poland and ukraine with russia and then passing right through belgium . '', 
  it is almost impossible to do that , both on fifa and football manager, 
  [ here are the ones of tigres ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/club_de_f%c3%batbol_tigres_de_la_universidad_aut%c3%b3noma_de_nuevo_le%c3%b3n#jugadores_cedidos ), 
  the only one that i remember is lugo , who broke his arm before the season began . 
  and arevalo has been quite regular , but not as good as he was last season . 
  no , pos atiza batman, 
  fuck tradition , you can shove your idiotic crap up your arse until you taste again on your mouth and then fuck off . 
  putting tradition over anything else will get you only to mediocrity , just ask necaxa , atlante and a lot of teams that where great on the 60s , like bubsy , and right now are not even on the top flight . 
  a lot of people has taken it for granted since the bbc , an actual credible news organisation , reported the future signing of mourinho . 
  is it the equivalent of the sun ? 
  nobody said people have n't learned from john spano affair, 
  please no , we already have the sun , independent , the daily mail ... please , stop, 
  so a step above of tmz and one below of the sun , thanks, 
  indeed , but hey , that bandwagon is not going to stop , so better get all the views, 
   i agree that wenger has not enjoyed the same success as mourinho but he has always managed to keep arsenal in a comfortable position irrespective of their circumstances, 
  indeed , but what counts is how many you won , not how much you got with the available resources, 
  it is not , it 's the equivalent of shouting `` sjws zionist '' for saying that part of the fanbase of trump is anti-semitist, 
  mourinho is ... arrogant to say the least . 
  and he also has the results to justify said arrogance . 
  that rubs a lot of people the wrong way , creating extreme reactions from both sides . 
  and silverware . 
  disharmony and silverware are perfect with traditonalist tears . 
   am i not allowed to say that zlatan is n't god on / r/soccer ? 
  you pretty much called him `` too old for the epl '' , he is a player that can adapt both to different systems and age . 
  that is more that many `` epl raised '' players can do . 
  he just ca n't adapt to beign a substitute, 
  from my memory it was trejo , he was given one of the best teams and did shit , sending us on a downward spiral that culminated on the shit show that was guzman . 
  it went trejo ( shit with us ) , carrillo ( regular ) , tolo ( shit with us ) , lapuente ( below regular ) , pekerman ( shit with us ) and guzman ( satan on disguise ) . 
  apperently it is alberto guerra , since he relegated us , but i was too young to remember . 
   darren `` daddy they were mean to me '' ferguson, 
  was he that bad ? 
  finally , no more bullshit speculation about whether he is out or in . 
  now , more speculation on whether mata would last a season under mourinho . 
   remember how gamers flipped their shit about that mod the dad made for his daughter that changed the pronouns for link to female ones ? 
  wait , what ? 
  no idea , it may also refer to anciet roma , italian fascism or warhammer 40k . 
  he later went to mexico and made santo 's one of the shittiest teams of the league, 
  outside of the / r/shitamericanssay argument , it is something that ca n't really be used on football . 
  see , the main diference between real football and shit rugby is the pace . 
  in the case of american football . 
  you have reaccomodate the team , choose a play , execute the play and then repeat said process . 
  this allows things like [ trick plays ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve7g-dftbpq ) , but it also allows that most of the analysis stays during the game , allowing to have time left for exuberant half time shows . 
  in football , since said turn-based elements does not exist , they must use the half time for anakysis ,, 
  another reason is that football is a very demanding sport that requires one to be active for most of the time . 
  half time then must also be long enough to recuperate and to change tactics , and explain said changes to the players , but not long enough to get their muscles cold . 
  american football , due to its turn-base nature , does not require this , therefore allowing a 13 minutes show , plus the time they use to put and take the stage , on the field does not really damage the physic of the players . 
  atlante and necaxa , they are the only teams remaing from the football of the 40s and 50s . 
  the first one was the original `` el equipo de mexico '' and the second where the chelsea of the time , since they bough almost all the team marte after they won the league . 
  [ don rober crying when the tigres won the league after 30 and something years ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgbfeszvue ), 
  [ also , martinolli losing his shit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gnn44neagu ), 
  it was . 
  necaxa was big on the 40s , 50s , 60s , 70s and 90s, 
   they give each team more time to strategize in their play selection for the entire drive . 
  like i said on my comment , this is allowed on american football games due to its turn base nature , it would not be helpful during football games . 
   i just ca n't stand how the chevrolet logo looks on man u 's jersey and would never consider buying one unless they changed sponsors . 
  yeah , i have the same problem with the yokohama ad with the chelsea 's kit, 
   also , no regional blackouts like in the us . 
  this happens also on mexico , but just on nuevo leon, 
  one of my favourite managers on my favorite russian team , great, 
  i just want him to be below mourinho , so that those that shout `` tradition '' shut the fuck up, 
  `` totes amazeballs , smooth like alan '', 
  not exactly, 
  the one relegated is not the worst team , but the one with worse points coefficent ( total points/total played games , both of the last 6 tournaments ) and after every clausara ( february - may ) , one team is relegated . 
  the one is promoted is the one that wins the promotion playoff between the winner of the apertura ( july - december ) and clausura of liga de ascenso ( 2nd division ) it was indios fc vs necaxa . 
  hungary , the return of the powers of the old . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzhfzsr0n_c ), 
  what was your criteria ? 
   `` it 's true , it was my decision in january to block all the salary payments because i was very angry , '', 
  look , as much as i would love to do that to a lot of players that does not sweat nor bleed the shirt , it is still unethical , assholic and completly dickfuckery to not pay because you are angry . 
  unless said action was justified under contract , you are the worst one of the bunch . 
  also , not paying is not going to get them to play harder , it only helps to get them work worse since there is no remuneration for working harder , and paying what is lawfully theirs is not an acceptable remuneration . 
  yeah , but he did n't care, 
  wait , why them ? 
  what is yaya and seedorf doing with a bunch of mostly creative players ? 
  fabregas is still on his prime , why is he on the list ? 
  are we already calling lampard retired ? 
  lampard is , for all intents and purposes , retired until further notice . 
  anyway :, 
  * lampard, 
  * seedorf, 
  go on ... 
  not exactly , we stop paying him for not compling to his contract , which he denied having and later confirmed that he was aware of said contract and accepted its conditions . 
  in this case , he just stop paying even when the players went to train and played on the field . 
  he is really good at getting the players to be on their best form and to reuse old players that are near retirement ( eto'o ) . 
  manu 's squad is one of the best , so most people expect the best from mourinho .
