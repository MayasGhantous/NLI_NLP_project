  no clue , wait until the end of the draft, 
  the benzema piece was pretty good, 
  nop, 
  every newspaper has been alking about damm leaving to a bundesliga team , but they have been a lot of teams mentiones . 
  now it is dortmund , last week was leverkusen, 
  well , i fucked up the title, 
  i was totally expecting john to flash us , live on twitch . 
  [ money ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=texatquvqac ), 
  looks weird , was posted but deleted almost inmediatly before and i do n't know if that is a 6 or an 8, 
   so in mexico the players also sign with the whole federation , not the team ? 
  no , it 's ... weird . 
  they have a contract only wih the team , but due to the `` gentleman 's pact '' they ca n't really go against the owners . 
  i just hope they scrap it all off, 
  nothign official , just as benedetto and damm, 
  if they get some transfers , since they will apparently lose silvio romero and cant get anyone due to rumors of a possible move . 
   i 'm glad players like pulido decided to speak up . 
  pulido didnt `` speak up '' , he lied about his contract and went to a team that was in cahoots with olympiakos to take the fall that was pretty fucking obvious and later signed to a drug cartel , or olympiakos whose entire board has been conected to drug trafficking ( specially heroin ) and match fixing . 
  its a shit show , a bunch of owners , sports directors and managers get together on secrecy to buy , sell or loan players without the consent of the players . 
  they are not on contract with the league , as is in america , but the gentlemans pact works as a deterrent to go against the draft . 
   and cardozo seems to be a highly likeable coach, 
  he just needs to go to pataguay and ask them to play with him . 
  if reports are right , queso fernandez eanted to go to toluca just for him . 
  last season he was god , an unstoppable force to be feared . 
  this season ambriz started to rotate the players and it fuck up his rythm . 
  srill pretty good as a sub, 
  also , the average transfers are 91 per draft . 
  dammit john , what about the `` no drama for my health '' ? 
  this is drama, 
  just pay a prostitute , i use that when i want to tdo the choo-choo train, 
  no idea , only rumors but nothing official, 
  to bang both the cougar and her daughter and to organize a choo-choo train without paying a prostitute , female or male . 
  @draftmexicano this one is working for me, 
  the owner is banned from any football activity and he still appears on games and administrates the team . 
  they are not reviewing the contract , they are reviewing ** what to do ** with the contract , since they declare it null and void due to false testimonies , specially from alan pulido . 
  and yes , i believe him at the start , but after 10 miins of researching i found out he was full of bullshit with good intentions . 
  he is no hero , he is a conman that simple targeted something we do n't like . 
  more proof of how fucked up is olympiacos :, 
  really ? 
  i thought he was n't good with you . 
  probably , but i pretty much only see chelsea at the pl, 
  need help ? 
  he never adapted to european football , not on england nor on spain, 
  only two confirmed are barrera to pumas , caraglio to xolos and chara to rayados , ~ ~ america ~ ~ deportivo de cali ( sorry ) is waiting for the draft to end to buy mosquera and tigres just put lugo on the transfer list, 
  also , you put must of my sources , i also use this, 
  and, 
  chivas arrived,

  we do , no idea why it did n't work with this one . 
  see on my thread about [ barrera ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/4n611r/pablo_barrera_returns_to_pumas_pablo_barrera/d41337p ), 
  when did barrera went to puebla ? 
   so much twitter user activity on my unactive cruz azul :(, 
  [ indeed ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ckcsgywugaefu73.jpg:large ), 
  taking some mojitos and trying to get villar and aviles ; and also failing to buy kannemann , even when he is on the transfer list, 
  gandolfi only sounds to cruz azul, 
  [ this sounds nasty , marches\u00edn for pab\u00f3n ] ( https://twitter.com/fersch_4/status/740641471766745088 ), 
  he may be blocking any attept to get anyone above 30 .

  his meltdown is delicious, 
  jonathan is out, 
  not as good as expected,

  cristian penilla to morelia on a loan, 
  [ ismael sosa to tigres ] ( https://twitter.com/javialonsordz/status/740697267858853892 ), 
  * record, 
  they have been loaning him for years , and as any cruz azul homegrown player , he only won a title after exiting the institution, 
  i 'm not too keen , we have 4 strikers ( only one is young and he wants to leave ) and another 3 that play sometimes as strikers , so i have no idea how he is going to work outside of occupating mancilla 's role as the bench of the bench . 
  also , if sobis leaves to gallos , sosa would n't be an optimal solution for a cf with midfielder responsibilities, 
  the national theater company of mexico wish to present the next piece : twitter 's class and crass, 
  yup, 
   on topic , mexico , what kind of fetish do y' all have with our good keepers ? 
  is the nose and the name , i am 80 % about it, 
  veracruz is down , no queston . 
  it is the girourd effect , great goals per game ratio but still rated like a piece of shit with two sticks instead of legs, 
  probably, 
  because he would n't be in the starting xi , apparently, 
  no thanks , last we need is another mata tecnicos on the squad, 
  hooters ? 
   7m euro, 
  probably a mistake , the normal currency we use is us dollars, 
   why does tigres keep buying wingers and attacking midfielders ? 
  tuca abuses the wings a lot , so he always looks to have 2 great ones at the bench .
