  anyway , good article infron of other that talk about the same , but it is kind of shite . 
  between jet set radio and final fantasy vi and x, 
  `` hipster club '' ? 
  thats new to me , is it like saying i am a german fan after germany wins , or something like that ? 
  seeing the parma shield is just sad ... 
  a friend of mine arrived drunk to the game , and played it since he was the only goalkeeper . 
  he was , also , expelled from highschool . 
  ** all hail yashin , inventor of the modern goalkeeper **, 
  probably he is on the top five of the last decade , at most fighting the first with buffon . 
  but of all times ? 
  nah , people like yashin and dino zoff were way above him . 
  only in archival footage . 
  ... oh , so like , that guy that knows shite and somehow is now fan of a winning team that is not of his area ? 
  ok , thanks mate, 
  most countries already have agreements between them to speed it up , but there have been time when transfers most wait sometime due to fuck ups of the clubs when submit the paperwork and the player must wait until the mess clears out to play with the team . 
  nah , that sounds like everyday sport game . 
  they do , but fuck ups happen . 
  i discovered this when some people at cruz azul ( i think ) fucked up a transfer and the player waited a month to play , and at the end the policies of the goverment changed to speed it up more . 
  now this is just nasty , not only did he throw miss pao under the bus , he does not even take responsability of his actions . 
  tevez , i love how you play . 
  i have followed your career since your time at boca , and i was excited everytime i saw you at the field . 
  and now you return to your home , where your history began . 
  good . 
  i hope tigres , or any mexican , peruvian or bolivian team , plays against you at libertadores and crush you like the cunt you are , because ** i am still fucking mad of what you did back at south africa during the 2010 world cup , you asshole . 
  love it !, 
  perfect !, 
  i need to translate them in spanish . 
  mom was both at the argentina vs england and vs belgium , so she always put maradona above everyone else . 
  dad puts dino zoff up there , mostly because the first world cup games he saw where those of italy at spain 82 . 
  ** except on archival footage . 
  ** that was offside , for fucks sake !, 
  finally , no one should look for a couch who refuses to learn the native language to talk to the players . 
  is it true that they played [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68ugkg9repc ) when they entered to the field ? 
  also , i saw that game where aguero scored , incredible game . 
  the cachirules scandal back in the 80s . 
  the femexfut attempted to win the u20 tournament and they added four players that were over 20 years old . 
  then , for some reason , they released a yearbook with the acual age of those players . 
  clusterfucks followed , and we where banned of football for 2 years , losing the opportunity to play in italy 90 . 
  check for craglist, 
  god , please tuca , do not fuck this one up . 
  sorry mate , it either that or ebay, 
  [ yo listen up , here is a story about a little guy that lives in a blue world ... ] ( https://youtu.be/68ugkg9repc ), 
  i love my team , but the coach . . he just gets crazy, 
  and now , how will liverpool misuse the cash ? 
  yeah , but apparently manchester city used it officially when they entered to the field , so topical, 
  they been anouncing it since monday ... 
  origianally it was atlante , and not chivas , the `` team of mexico '' , because they were the first to prioritize mexicans and not spaniards back in the 30s , where teams like atletico espa\u00f1ol where the strong ones . 
  ** what . 
  twat . 
  also , club futbol monterrey is rayados due to the design of their uniforms , tigres both due to his name and shield , and leon as panzas verdes ( green stomachs ) due to the color of their uniforms, 
  he stole the goal !, 
  that was the mascot of the sport team fo the uanl , who obtain the team after they where disolved . 
  back then they were known as club de futbol nuevo le\u00f3n and they share the nickname with leon . 
  they were also named jabato , do n't know why . 
  there were also curtidores , whos nickname , and name , was based on the fact that it was originally a team of tanners , known as curtidores in mexico . 
  dad says that before and during the derby between irapuato and curtidores , those who sold meat and where curtidores fan began to smash their knives together , specially when curtidores score a goal . 
  edit : see / u/honvales1989 comment, 
  guido pizarro , egidio arevalo, 
  sobis and gignac, 
  and milner was bought by liverpool ... wait a minute ... this is a conspiracy, 
  well , he is not as * high * as maradona, 
  never been , but some said it before on some other place, 
  thanks mate , dad wasnt around so i kind of fucked it up . 
  i 'll edit the comment, 
  awesome, 
  'cause we are not part of the conmebol , south america 's football association , therefore we are not elegibile to obtain the place to the clubs world cup at libertadores or to the confederations at the copa america . 
  yeah , and the round of 16 game at the 2010 wc was completley legit , and his hand of god goal, 
  wait , this is ** recent ** ? 
  there is the rumor that after the finals of the 1974 wc , most of the players from west germany where sent to a rehabilitation center . 
  atlas of guadalajara , they brought matosas . 
  it was a load of bs , what were you expecting ? 
  the only thing that is a controversy was wether guardado should take the penalty or give it to panama, 
  wait , was n't croatia invated and abused by germany at wwii ? 
  also , tigres, 
  ... sterling, 
  yup , normal from fans that buy 90 % of the stadium before the season starts . 
  yes , wether he should give it to panama as a gesture of fair play or to shoot the penalty to tie the game . 
  frankly , i have no answer for that . 
  on one side , they needed to score , since it was on injury time . 
  on the other , it was just not a penalty . 
  but so was that penalty at the round of 16 at the 2014 wc , and lets not forget that goal of tevez against mexico back at the 2010 wc . 
  ( the rival will not have mercy ) , mirroring the justifications on both moments , where guardado played . 
  so yeah , i still have no awnser for that . 
  ... damian alvarez still plays for tigres , or did he play for monarcas ? 
  el chapo comes from sinaloa , where the most played sport is ** baseball ** , not ** football ** . 
  mate , thats my take with the entry exam of unam . 
  literally , i said puta madre !, 
  and fill it like a cunt . 
  tigres is at the final !, 
  in argentina you can not buy tickets at some games if you are a fan of the visiting team , hence why there where only boca fans at the boca-river game . 
  they probably just decided to follow the same rule . 
  yup , just another day in monterrey ... 
  oh , ** that ** ... do n't know man , the centenario is at usa , but considering everything happening with the fifa scandal , who knows . 
  right now its like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jk-ncrmvcw ) , but last two seasons where like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldk9qqizhwk ) . 
  lobos to toluca , a lot of players going to tigres ( i am seeing you , villa ) , schev move to chelsea and andy carrol to liverpool, 
  who ? 
  thank god it was ** just a friendly ** . 
  kind of , the ranking system is a mess . 
  the nt role at copa america was awful , and the low value of copa oro will not help it , even if they won all the games . 
  right now , the only won to cuba , costa rica and panama , all below mexico at the fifa rankings , and jamaica is also below them .
