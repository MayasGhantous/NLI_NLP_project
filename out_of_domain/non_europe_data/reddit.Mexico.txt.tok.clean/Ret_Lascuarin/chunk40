  they scored at the same time :d, 
  the favorites dark horses are right now out of the euro, 
  ehhhhh ... liminados, 
  your striker sucks . 
  fact, 
  yup , 2 points, 
  maybe , 3 points could not be enough, 
  points and goal difference , also disciplinary record, 
   hungary on the top half . 
   germany on the bottom half . 
  miracle of saint-denis incoming . 
  i would make the `` how do you do , my fellow kids ? '', 
  joke , but this is just sad . 
  no idea if this was wrote by intelligent designs ( the devs ) or by treehouse ( preferably not ) . 
  for what i gather , this is the new one ( color splash ) . 
  [ also , sterling is not happy ] ( https://twitter.com/jimsterling/status/745730469774385153 ), 
  maybe when playing dark souls, 
  well shit , and this is why we need traductology as a requirement for videogame translators . 
  or `` playing '' with the ps4 controller, 
  we are not shit !, 
  we are not shit !, 
  shit, 
  what the fuck ? 
  alcohol , you have betrayed me !, 
   and an equivalent to the champions league which would need canada and mexico and other countries to have much better teams . 
  it 's called the concachampions, 
  said like a true reading fan . 
  surprising , i expected nothing but a shadow of an old football powerhouse . 
  and insted i saw a team that found heir own identity . 
   how is this even method acting anymore ? 
  see : daniel day-lewis , who takes it a whole ` nother level, 
  that would probably help when reading finnegan 's wake :d, 
  ## ` murica !, 
  france is dlc, 
   but adding poc characters ? 
  that would just be too innaccurate !, 
  that 's more on the way that japan 's weird view on foreginers whose tropes and cliches permated westerners rpgs . 
  maybe , but it is more fair for everyone to shoot the penalty from the same place . 
  yes , but the olympics were more important back then than today . 
   one more ref could be keeping an eye on flopping and penalties that the the main ref misses . 
  it could also mess with the game , look for bad refs , they tend to accidentally block passes and shots for bad positioning . 
  adding another would make it worst . 
  they are ultras , they have some power with the fa and a lot on with the teams , since most of them have membership with the organization . 
  they are conected with [ drug dealing ] ( http://es.insightcrime.org/analisis/violencia-poder-futbol-drogas-barras-bravas-argentina ) , [ intimidation ] ( http://www.proceso.com.mx/274754/la-violenta-mafia-de-las-barras-bravas ) and [ plenty ] ( http://www.infobae.com/playfutbol/primera/2016/06/07/asesinaron-al-jefe-de-la-barrabrava-de-newells-en-la-puerta-del-estadio/ ) [ of ] ( http://www.infobae.com/2016/01/11/1782211-asesinaron-al-jefe-la-barra-brava-arsenal/ ) [ murders ] ( http://deportes.terra.com.mx/futbol/internacional/argentina/primera-division/la-increible-historia-del-crimen-que-involucra-a-migliore,c9e1a4faf60dd310vgnvcm4000009bcceb0arcrd.html ), 
   rock , paper , scissors ? 
  oh man , that would be a travesty to the game , also hilarious . 
   yep . 
  pitbull would be banned from doing a theme song for the tournament ever again . 
  but beware , that would give shakira carte blanche to be the official artist . 
  but what if lil ' wayne is hired ? 
  #brexit incoming !, 
  the mexico of europe :d, 
  not exactly , when so much is on the table , one must level the field as much as possible , that is the whole point on the modern penalty shootout . 
  or a goal at the 95th minute, 
  why is sturridge in ? 
  #what the fuck ? 
  #this is england , you dolts , not tottenham !, 
  thanks , it kind of makes sense considering iceland 's defensive tactics . 
  go for more chocolate !, 
  it 's for the greater good !, 
   why should it be a level playing field ? 
  to make it fairer , is it that hard to get ? 
  hockey pens are not like that due to beign showy , but because the field ( ice , you dolt ) . 
  that did n't work for the xfl , did it ? 
  the icelandic affair, 
  tuca did that , but only for a few games . 
  that 's a problem in the internet , if you write an intelligent post with professional terminology on a `` casual '' subreddit , you are pretentious . 
  in 6 hours about / u/jeanrenomarryme comment, 
  chiquidracula as the pacemaker , that is still surprising, 
  whatever happened to lucas piazon ? 
  nor do i , mourinho is not well liked by the old guard , so having a rat on the staff is not a good idea, 
  outside off real madrid and his second stint with chelsea , no locker room want him out . 
  he is one of the best their will ever be . 
  the rat comment goes to giggs because he will sell him to ferguson and his clique , not to mourinho . 
  he just killed it by not updating it an later just deleting it . 
  it was, 
  i doubt it , the hungarian school died due to the cold war , specifically on the loss of talent ( ex : puskas to madrid and to spain ) and a serie of economic sanctions given by the ussr after the hungarian revolution of ' 56 . 
  what would be your definition of `` edgelord games '' ? 
  both postal 2 and hatred stand as your examples , both attempt , and fail as games , some sort of recognition through shock . 
  but at what point does a game that pushes boundaries becomes an `` edgelord '' game ? 
  / u/tangleworm , for example , mentions the manhunt serie , which is a weird series . 
  the first one is a commentary on reality tv , where a filmmaker looks a way to create a product that will bring ratings just by shocking the audience , but ends beign destroyed by his own product . 
  it could , on a closer look , be criticizing what we know now as `` edgelord culture '' . 
  the sequel was a clusterfuck , completly detached from the first game . 
  another one is / u/antonpancake 's example , harvester . 
  notorious for its gore and themes , harvester could be considered an edgelord game , would it not be a reflection and critique of taboos and accepted behaviours on an otherwise perfect anglo-saxon society . 
  also , what role does sexuality have on the definition ? 
  does an edgelord game qualifies solely on its audience or on its overall intent ? 
  would games like huniepop , cs : go , dota 2 , team fortress 2 and other games whose fandom is swarmed by toxic elements of the internet be considered `` edgelord '' ? 
  as for examples , only one i can think is rapelay . 
  edit : also , are you only analyzing full releases on storefronts or also flash games ? 
  7-0 incoming, 
  specially at '78, 
  we have a fuckton of those , two of them are :, 
  * ** atlante ** : formerly known as `` el equipo de mexico '' ( the team of mexico ) , it was one of the few teams that used mexicans intead of europeans , specially spaniards . 
  last time they won was on apertura '07 against pumas with * el potro de hierro * maldonado and bermudez , just after they moved from mexico city , where most of their fans recide , to cancun . 
  they also won the concachampions '08 edition . 
  they were relegated on 2014 . 
  * ** tecos de la uag ** : they where the sensation of the 90s and early 2000s . 
  armed with some of the best scouts of mexico and some of the best managers ( vucetich and guzman , for example ) , they brought truly offensive football along with bringing some of the greatest players of the decade : pony ruiz , daniel ludue\u00f1a , zdenko muf and many more .
