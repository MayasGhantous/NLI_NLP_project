  they never won anything , losing two finals ( '94 santos , '05 america ) , but they were a truly great team . 
  the collage uag sold the team at 2013 to grupo pachuca-carso . 
  the main team was moved to zacatecas to take the mantle of mineros de zacatecas , while an affiliate club stayed and took the mantle of tecos , now as tecos futbol club . 
  as if videos are n't available, 
  we shout `` puto '' and other slurs , is that good enough ? 
   however for many rural players , there may not be a pokestop for miles and miles . 
  or even urban player on not so developed areas , my cousin and i only found 1 pokestop on an entire neighborhood here at mexico city . 
  and it is a big one . 
  i. . . uh ... i started actually singing with a cousin that had an apple account registered on the usa the `` yo quiero ser un maestro pokemon '' while catching a cubone on a children 's playground .

   edit . 
  and we ca n't get copa lib this season cos we 're in the ccl . 
  this season , both in the local and international scene , is going to be one hell of a ride . 
   regardless , they 're big names globally so those teams always tend to come back . 
  there are a lot of teams that are resonated globally and they have yet to `` bounce back '', 
  probably just when we crash and burn spectacularly with an 8-0, 
  if shit was n't bad , this is going to put the manga/anime/videogames on a bad light until they become political propaganda , probably a la highschool of the dead . 
   the guy who wrote it seemed to have a deep pathological grudge against whimsical fantasy worlds , so he made an entire tacticool power fantasy about destroying it . 
  is that bad ? 
  nor is it healthy to classify the destruktion of genre as `` unhealty '' , since it demonstrates ignorance over basic narratology and/or aesthetics from someone that is a dm, 
  bournemouth , bournemouth , bourn-i 'll - have-anything-to-say-when-they-become-relevant , - probably-by-making-arsenal-choke-itself . 
  cwc case is the prime example that the old `` get off the computer '' does not apply anymore . 
   we did it reddit, 
  yeah , i doubt that a high profile actor been harassed to tears was not the main reason milo was banned . 
  / s just in case, 
  it is not uncommon for a big team to turn a big profit even after a disappointing campain , vergara in chivas has been doing that for decades . 
  my interest on history and medieval literature started with age of empires i & ii , specially the second . 
  that is also the only reason i started reading `` the secret story of the mongols '' . 
  that is also the reason i learned how to make trebuchets , but that is for a different thread . 
  this reminds me so much of some of my friends whose families send them to legionarios of cristo schools . 
  the whole bizarreness of their existance was impressive . 
  coke , until nolito sniffs and drinks it while looking pep in the eyes . 
   there have been many amazing presidents in american history , including ... abraham lincoln ... 
  #this has over a 100 under a minute . 
  does someone even read what he posts ? 
  it 's now over a hundred . 
  there are moments that i have to remind myself that this is something actually happening, 
  nop , he is still barfing all over a keyboard . 
  and he added melania on the list, 
  great , it is dieing before it comes out in my country . 
  yup , and it normally has more attendance than a cruz azul game, 
  it 's one of the biggest in the world . 
  though , the coment comes more from the fact that cruz azul has low attendance than from the size of the bull ring . 
  no , it 's suicide . 
  the moment a hurricane comes , it will fall apart . 
  fucking great , the game is beign killed by the developers before it reaches my country , fucking amazing, 
  hey man , i just want to be the very best , like no one ever was . 
  [ i vividly remember this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ballxcttdi ), 
  yup , there are a lot of people still playing it , though i mostly play against ai and single player . 
  no , quitaron el tracker y trackers independientes, 
  considering that bull fight has more attendance than cruz azul , yeah, 
  so it 's ** your ** fault that they bottle up . 
  case closed . 
  #to manchester united, 
  on the plus side , atleast it did n't fall apart right after the medical , [ just like it happened to cruz azul with guilherme gusmao . 
  ] ( http://www.excelsior.com.mx/adrenalina/2015/07/04/1032899 ), 
   so every match is like a wwe event, 
  oh my god !, 
  it 's stone cold steve austin !, 
  and he is on a warpath !, 
  is it wrong that i loved spore ? 
  you sound surprised they would n't do that, 
  that is inflation and futa , both are basic alternative hentai , which is the main point of / d / . 
  i always feel put off with the terms `` woke '' and `` illuminated '' , since it depends a lot of the idea of `` progress '' that was so critizd by walter benjamin . 
  yeah , the pressure that is put on mangakas to continue their work is unreal . 
  putting a manga on hiatus or finishing it by any other reason but death or unpopularity is normally frowned on the same level that a coaches frowned time off due to exhaustion or concussion . 
   i wish i lived in v for vendetta, 
  does someone actually says this ? 
  incoming swap between cruz azul and leon . 
  you do realize that olympiakos does n't get anything from this , right ? 
  and now they had a player who was on a grey area and without the card , so they let him go . 
  welcome to tigre negotiation tactics , another reason i know that none of our players will go to europe, 
  so far it has n't been a great year for him , he lost in the tas , the manager did n't like him and the team just decided to not even bench him out of fear of beign punished by uefa or fifa ( not the league , since olympiakos rules it on all levels ) . 
  he was n't getting playing time since he lost to tigres in the tas , and even before was n't getting that much time due to the manager not liking him . 
  no , he could n't . 
  olympiakos was never the owner of the card of the player , that was tigres and they sold half of it to chivas sometime ago . 
  ## sold, 
   bastian schweinsteiger received a rapturous send-off ... and soon he 'll head back to manchester , where jose mourinho may or may not acknowledge his existence . 
  jeez the guardian , that was n't necessary . 
  a `` it 's not you baby , it 's me '' would be enough, 
  also , does pulido count ? 
  that was not during the deadline, 
  and 10 % just on pogba 's transfer,
