   player ultimately makes the choice on where he wants to go, 
  unless he plays in mexico, 
  free agents can be signed at any point of the season, 
  there is none, 
  doubt they would pull the plug when using common tactics , in this case done by the player instead of the club, 
  * account is 1 year old , not that controversial, 
  * university student , all of my classes are from monday to wensday , rest of the week is free time, 
  * central standard time zone ( cst ), 
  * none, 
  * none , and i kind of suck . 
  for those that remember the thread of transfers , i lasted an entire hour to work out how to make a table functional . 
  is there anyone else that play as gk for the national team that is ** not ** ochoa and corona ? 
   gets pissed easily, 
   great leader, 
  so , cota is corona 2.0 , electric bogaloo ? 
  til that la parka was on wcw , unless it is another la parka and not the one that wrestled in mexico and did that weird promo with el hijo del perro aguayo with the mustard, 
  i really , ** really ** want the miz to break the honky tonk man 's record . 
  he is great as a heel . 
  yup, 
   `` there are many similarities between them ( ambrose and stone cold ) '', 
  these idiots on the mic are awful, 
  next thing we know , samoa joe and aj styles battle in wrestlemania, 
  directly from conalep, 
  checking about la parka , or l.a. parka as he is now known , the promo was around the tenure of la paka ii , since the original la parka did n't return to mexico until 2004 and could not use his orginal attire due to working with cmll and not aaa . 
  miz , the heeliest heel of all the heels . 
  also , not that excited for a miz/ziggler rematch , give it time so it gives the idea of ziggler of training to be the no. 1 contender for the ic title . 
  ... did n't gilberg did something like that ? 
  sting kind of did that against pillman and arn anderson , but he had flair as a partner who did not appear on the beginning start of the match and ended up appearing in the middle of the match , just to betray sting . 
  maybe both ? 
  ## connor the coochie, 
   press 3 if naomi is dressed up like a watermelon and vince thinks that 's funny, 
  oh chat , could n't expect less from you, 
  was that a botch from nikki ? 
  i just had a flashback of the tigres from guzman when puebla 's now annulled goal, 
   ... but `` pulled a hogan '' and changed his mind about that rematch . 
  is n't that called `` i lost my smile '' ? 
  probably not , they have been infamous for a while an it had yet to bring fruits to them . 
  * my blood still boils when i see sanchez and barovero, 
  * 65 is still too much for hernandez ( queretaro , ex-tigres ) , and palos is not that bad . 
  * yarbrough is a bit better than 69, 
  * it still surprises me that villar and conejo perez are still playing , though the latter one is more than 71 . 
  * the leaker must be a tigres fan , for most of the labelled players are at tigres . 
  * [ arroyo has better than 74 in shoot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmdneezfcxm ), 
  * roco 's card should have `` billy , you idiot ; he is not an lb '', 
  * salcido 's card has a picture from when he played with tigres, 
  * fabbro looks like an eddie guerrero cheap knock-off, 
  * fifa 17 : where el hobbit can actually play for puebla, 
  * martin bravo looks like a rat, 
  til, 
  nah , arroyo 's pace is not that good . 
  but that sht is insulting . 
  probably xolos or pachuca, 
  so ... going full american on futbol ? 
  no thank you . 
  the stadium is already a thing here , though what constitutes `` passable '' is questionable . 
  the salary thing is also kind of a thing , but they are too forgiving and lax to do anything other than just lending money to the teams . 
  the youth system is also a thing , but what they do with them is another thing . 
  the only thing the league need to do is to take the cociente table away , that is what actually saves the worst teams to remain only by playing decently a few years ago . 
  that is how tigres survived during trejo/tolo/guzman tenure . 
  also ,, 
   `` making it more fun '', 
  can you specify why you consider football not fun enough for you . 
  he would be good , but with a rocky start . 
  on he may solve the discipline problem on america , since he brings psychologist for his players . 
   i do believe that not having relegation would make the game more enjoyable since there wouldnt be such pressure for points . 
  completly taking away any incentive for competitiveness , it almost sounds like you are beign ironic or something . 
   plus there are other things i wish the league would do to seperate us from the rest of the world . 
  why is that necessary ? 
  beign different just for beign different is just, 
  #dumb with a capital d, 
   when liga mx was first being concieved i remember hearing about the possibility of getting rid of ties , imo that would be awsome . 
  yeah , and it was rightly put down for how, 
  #dumb with all in capitals, 
  it was . 
  as some commentators put it back in the day , along the points given according to the number of goals scored on a game , it does n't reflect the quality of the game . 
  let us remind that football is a sport first , and a entretainment the second . 
  if you are not entretain by the sport , go to the shit version of rugby , you will find you entretainment right there . 
  and it thought / u/chadpc was bad, 
   are the nba , nfl , mls not competitive ? 
  team owners still need to have a product that is marketable and appealing to fans . 
  two words : cleveland browns . 
  also look at the modern raiders or the rams of saint louis . 
  they are marketable and appealing to fans , not competitive . 
   i have heard more than once team presidents and owners say that they operate at a loss which means that there is motivation that is not just monetary to running a club . 
  do you have any evidence of this allegations beign true ? 
  i am actually curious . 
   teams would still want to win because thats the whole point . 
  true , but there is no real danger of consequences other than firing , which can be found on any job . 
   the mls grew in leaps and bounds because they took from the rest of the world what they liked and changed what they didnt . 
  the mls grew leaps and bounds because they used the infrestructure of the ncaa , giving them an edge of talented youngsters to start , as well as a well developed scout system . 
  also , they copied and adapted elements of training and strategy from european football , allowing them to have a great start . 
  and to further prove my point , it is a accepted fact that the only reason that usa sports do not have any sort of relegation system is because of money . 
  when the now known national league started , they decided to go with the `` closed shop '' system to mantain the exclusive local rights . 
  monopolizing the fanbase of said territory . 
  [ as richard hershberger wrote ] ( http://ordinary-gentlemen.com/2015/11/15/why-american-sports-dont-have-promotion-and-relegation/ ) , the control of said rights became a cornerstone of any league in the usa . 
  not only that , but right now the main reasons they do n't want to evolve is the [ tv deals ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/relegation-will-never-work-in-american-sports-2011-11?op=1/#ere-are-not-enough-big-league-stadiums-in-the-us-9 ) and [ the lose of investment done due to the expansion fee ] ( http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2622731-planting-the-seeds-for-a-soccer-relegation-revolution-in-the-us# ) . 
  never because of the sport , only because the money . 
   i know that getting rid of relegation would solve a lot of those problems . 
  no , you ** believe ** that it would sove all of the problems , despite evidence that it is designed to improve the stability on the owners ' investment , not the quality of the sport . 
  there are also ton of mediocre players on all the amercian leagues , for every ben roethlisberger or peyton manning there is a jamarcus russel or an andrew luck , for every michael jordan there are hundres of players that never even appear on the benches of the teams that draft them .
