  mediocrity exists , whether you actually recognized it or not is a whole different matter . 
  same thing with the bad scouting of foreginers . 
  for every valenzuela or toni kukoc there is a tsuyoshi nishioka and a nikoloz tskitishvili , so stop thinking that mediocrity disappears when there is no relegation , said fallacy is born from your own ignorance of the leagues you embellish . 
  is liga mx perfect ? 
  fuck no , it 's a clusterfuck . 
  my own solution involves going back to the long league format , which not only improves the league , but could also help the cup , take the cociente table , as a tigres fan i know that we only remain on the first division thanks to that , and bring back the rules of sub-17 and sub-23 , without the loophole that the epl has . 
  that last one is important , since it brought us a lot of players that to this day are the spine of the nt . 
  oh , it will . 
  at least it still is n't like bolivia , where the goal and the celebration was postponed due to commercials, 
  at least it would be better than romano and ambriz, 
  first , this :, 
   we already have people doing shit such as mass-flagging anita sarkeesien 's videos as `` terrorism '' and actually succeeding for brief periods of time . 
  are news to me . 
  i knew about the flagging , not about it succeding . 
  on a more serious note , if they have seen that their system is beign abused , why did they thought opening more the gates was a great idea ? 
  outside of unpaid labor , of course . 
  [ and a million dollar dream against the rock ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwngkbjm52o ), 
  adam `` master and commander of my loins '' blampied , how broke was jim cornette to accept your offer ? 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but was 4chan ever profitable ? 
   if murdering tens of thousands would massively improve life and reduce crime then you could make a ( highly unethical ) utilitarian argument . 
  as someone that lived on monterrey during some of the bloodiest years of the mini-f\u00fchrer 's `` war '' , i would n't call it `` utilitarian '' , it 's just an argument based on desesperation and ignorance . 
  it sounds like they took a lot of pages from los templarios, 
  as much as i love tigres , their record with young talent is abysmal at best . 
  and this is not just with tuca , we had the same problem with pekerman , tolo gallego , carillo and others . 
  the last one that used academy players was daniel guzman , some of them are still playing with us like `` piloto '' jimenez . 
  as for the comparision with chelsea , there are right on point both .

  the last one is the earliest that i could find of players on loan, 
  supercomputers also predicted a cruz azul championship last season , a relegated leicester last year , and world cup winning brazil . 
  i normally just put some jim cornette ( wrasslin personality ), 
  does someone knows whatever came from catania 's apparent sale to vergara ? 
  [ this is the most recent news article that google throws at me . 
  ] ( http://www.espn.com.mx/futbol/mexico/nota/_/id/2721301/diferencias-economicas-complican-compra-de-catania-para-vergara ) it is pretty obvious that it was n't going well , but there was nothing about what happened to the team , whether it was sold or not . 
  also , what is the opnion of their fans , and where they thrilled to become [ a developmental team , rather than a competitive team ] ( http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/mexico/noticias/2016/04/30/tambalea-proyecto-de-vergara-con-catania ) . 
  that is actually plausible , they should have gone with '' ... , discovers is only on film reel and laser disc , along with a signed picture of ted turner . '', 
  `` why do n't you see if you can borrow piper 's skirt ? '', 
  `` you see , the mind that controls the children is the mind that holds the future . 
  and i , am , salvation ! '', 
  `` you want your hat , home ? 
  then come and get it , man ! '', 
  either we crash spectacularly or we win easily , i do n't see any in-betweens . 
  seriously , scott steiner 's quote are the easiest to remember, 
   last month two workers took their own lives on site . 
  ## ** this shit needs to stop . 
  you have to really destroy someone 's hopes of the future to make suicide the only option . 
  but on the downside of the news , what is the ** legal ** ( not ethically ) grounds on where this stands ? 
  the piece quotes this from a legal professor of a dutch university :, 
   `` developments in international law have meant that companies and organisations such as fifa can be held jointly liable for violations of human rights that arise from their investments in foreign countries , '', 
  but it does n't says what developments is he talking about . 
  let us remind that this is a ** dutch ** union with a ** bangladesh ** worker suing an ** international ** organization that normally walks on gray legal grounds on a ** swiss ** court over incidents happening on ** qatar ** , under laws of ** qatar ** . 
  so where does this really stand legally speaking ? 
  sounds like they cruzazulearon really hard, 
   he changed song writing into an art form . 
  oh please , you make it sounds as if songs are a whole different genre than poetry . 
  songs are to poetry what audiobooks are to books , just a different form of delivering an art form . 
  also , tone your bullshit down . 
  agustin lara and his contemporaries were doing this years before , just because they were n't american does n't make it less important . 
   i recognize there was a wealth of other music written before 1962 . 
  but , from what i 've read/heard/seen , dylan 's songwriting in the early 60s lead his contemporaries to go away from the stagnant pool of tradition and inspired them to start writing themselves . 
  because music started on 1960s , amrite ? 
  because there is a difference between defending an author against snobs who think he is not good enough to just sepaking bullshit like usa consitutes the entire world . 
   carlos slim false flag, 
  since when slim is on the mix ? 
  holy shit !, 
  [ you were right ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/doliaestevez/2016/10/14/donald-trump-to-blame-mexican-tycoon-carlos-slim-for-nyt-sexual-harassment-stories-wsj-says/#36f5c1b7cc1e ), 
  i mean , i know he has tried previously to influence an election here at mexico ( his horse failed ) , but this is ridiculous . 
  a global conspiracy ? 
  are they fucking stupid ? 
  lets see what trump 's supporters responds :, 
   in 2015 , popular conservative columnist ann coulter , a trump supporter , claimed in a book that slim `` bailed out '' the new york times from `` imminent collapse '' so that he could `` buy pro-illegal immigration coverage '' in america 's most influential newspaper . 
  ... guys , your entire country is a bunch of immigrants , the fuck is wrong with you ? 
  also , quick side note , this, 
   ... we are n't even active in mexican politics . '', 
  is bullshit . 
  slim left ** national ** politics because his horse lost spectacularly for the second time , backstab him and made a whole new party to keep milking the election laws on mexico , not before burning the bridges wth everyone on his preview party , which he entered after burning the bridges on his original party . 
  also he attempted to rule mexico after losing the first time by beign `` presidente legitimo '' , failed to consolidate any sort of political power from that venture , and later lost for a second time . 
  he still influences on matters of telecommunications ( slim main market ) and on ** state ** politics . 
  on the best case scenario , he will be another lopez obrador . 
  he kicks and screams , his people kicks and screams , there will be some blood spilt , but any attempt for a `` revolution '' will end when the new season of whatever starts again . 
  probably american football . 
   ~ ~ his wife ~ ~ dixie the dix swallower, 
  ftfy, 
  ... you mean that is not normal ? 
   mexico is part of your continent , deal with it . 
  they 're more involved with you than with chile or argentina . 
  the term latin america constitutes any country that was a colony from the spanish crown , which went from la tierra de fuego all the way to mexico and some caribbean islands . 
  you are either an ignorant , or a racist who cosiders mexico and central america as `` inferior '' . 
  either way , fuck you . 
  also :, 
   well , latin america is a pretty conservative place, 
    that 's kind of ... bullshit .
