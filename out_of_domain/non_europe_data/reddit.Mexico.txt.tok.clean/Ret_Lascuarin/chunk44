  there is a combination of factors , the most common are :, 
  * he plays too defensively, 
  * he is too stubborn to make a change, 
  * he does n't play young , homegrown , talent, 
  that ... was ** not ** inside the limits , was n't it ? 
  it feels like a breake up farewell to mourinho 's chelsea, 
  i am going to get so much shit for this , but whatever . 
  when i was a child , there was always that second team that everyone was a fan of , some were ronaldinho 's barca fans , some raul 's madrid , other were ferguson 's manu ... i was a chelsea fan . 
  instead having a marquez poster , i actually made my own terry poster with cut outs . 
  my first jersey was of drogba ( it was also cheaper than gaitan 's ) . 
  for it was always tigres first , chelsea second , and mourinho was an important element of that . 
  and now ... it feels as if there was the final farewell to mourinho , as if the chelsea that he created gave him a farewell through football . 
  the final nail in the coffin that eliminates the shadow of mourinho that was always present whenever a new manager came to chelsea . 
  yes , he was dreadful that last season , but he still won the league in his second tenure . 
  and this game ... felt as when sakutaro threw the ashes away , a farewell to a moment of my youth . 
  what i am trying to say is ... 
  farewell mourinho , you will be remembered . 
  now get off the stage . 
  picture it like this :, 
  previous to the ppv where john cena could tie his record , you have segments and/or vignettes with people constantly asking flair about his opinion on john cena possibly winning the world championship for the 16th time , as well as some jabs on flair beign left behind . 
  he responds just as his opinion is right now , even joking on helping john cena in case aj plays dirty . 
  as the date of the ppv comes closer , flair is getting agitated and a bit frustrated on beign told that he is beign `` left behind '' . 
  during this last part , the ppv match is anounced to be a non dq match with charles robinson as a referee , specially highlighting that in case of any other wrestler coming to aid any competitor , it would become a non dq tag team match . 
  the macth starts , all goes well , they fight outside for a bit , then go back inside , john cena is winning by a very small margin , but nothing makes him look like the winner . 
  so then cena gets a third two counter , aj gets frustrated and makes the sign of the club and both luke and carl goes to the ring and help aj fight john cena . 
  the match transforms into a tag team match without anyone on cena 's corner . 
  cena continues the match , barely surviving and then ric flair 's music hits and he appears from the crowd on civilians clothes and armed with a chair . 
  cena tries to tag him , but both the club and aj prevents this . 
  flair starts to hype the crowd , trying to reach for cena . 
  cena lasts some 5 to 10 mins trying to tag , but failing . 
  and then he breaks from a hold from either luke or carl , tags , flair enters , points to the club , cena turns his back to flair and then he hits him repeatedly with the chair on the back and on the fronts . 
  signals to aj to come , lifts cena 's leg to aj who proceeds to do and aj clash to cena , rolls him up and charles robinson fast counts him . 
  as an extra you could throw cena having his shoulders up on the third count . 
  bell rings , cena tries to get up , the club begans to kick him , then finish him with a magic killer . 
  flair takes the mic , welcomes back charles lil natch robinson , cuts a promo on john cena never beign a better wrestler than flair ( and aj ) . 
  later aj cuts a promo on beign the new face that runs the place . 
  the club , aj , flair and charles do the sign of the club and there is your angle until the next ppv , or wrestlemania . 
  aj is the main wrestler , luke and carl as tag team champions ( sorry new day ) , charles favouring the club members on their matches while wearing a toga , and flair beign their manager . 
  and for those that find it familiar , yes , i pretty much took a lot from halloween havoc 95 sting & flair versus the four horseman team ( arn anderson & brian pillman ) match . 
  wait until boy gets the job, 
  oh , billy alvarez will recycle . 
  how many mistakes must he make until everyone gets that he will most likely take the wrong desicion ? 
   i remember they wanted to 100 % ban all non-union voice acting including not allowing game companies use employees to do their own voice work . 
  that sounds like the teacher 's unions here at mexico , and that is going so well, 
   ban where ? 
  from the industry , mostly western, 
   enforced by whom ? 
  possibly by the union and the own va , most probably with public humilliation and or physical threats . 
  also , blacklisting, 
   voice actors in gaming are nowhere near the equivalent of their counterparts in film , that is n't even an analogy . 
  maybe in the western side of the industry ( where the strike is taking place ) , but gaming vas having star power is common on japan . 
   a game with weak voice acting can be a bit laughable, 
  [ house of the dead 2 is the perfect example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he0wmetotzk ), 
  they would simply use the ocean or the airports . 
  and even then , they could just simply bribe the officers at the boarder . 
   but bad voice acting is more likely to help sales than to hurt it . 
  not exactly . 
  to put it simply , the `` too bad is good '' can only succesfull on certain genres and audiences , but not with the mainstream audience . 
  we laugh at hotd , re and sonic atrocious va , but the mainstream audience only sees a low-quality product . 
  and considering that modern games are veered mostly to these audiences , as well as an increase on the expected quality from games ( specially aaa gaming ) by the hardcore fans , it is unprofitable to rely on bad vas . 
   bad voice acting in an otherwise good game is , at worst , a minor nuisance . 
  probably in the 90s , but right now is not the case . 
  consider how most people choose to buy a game ( trailers ) . 
  now , what is important in the trailer is not so much the gameplay , but the visuals and the va ( see jq on [ the mic trick ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhytzot8po ) ) . 
  no matter how good the gameplay is , the hype machine would not be as big if it had sonic adventures vas . 
  and that is what really puts va on the spotlight on the modern game industry , its importance on making and selling a game . 
  nah , i am speaking of drugs . 
  that is one of the main forms of transports innovated on the 90s . 
  they either do them with the luggage of the airplane personnel ( aeromexico had an scadal due to that ) , use anonymous luggage and pray they do n't get the unbribed worker ( common in bolivia ) or simple use commercial non-pasanger flights to send the drug . 
  as for the ocean , frighters can be used to transport drugs , if not normal boats and hope to not get caught . 
  also remotely managed submarines . 
  stop seeing cis , that is damaging your brain . 
   ~ ~ more ~ ~ all of the people in the games industry need to unionise and strike . 
   but i will say , that if i had a say 17 year old son that had the option of getting a scholarship to stanford or playing in an mls academy . 
  he 'd be going to stanford . 
  you seem to be under the impression that ncaa cares aabout the students education , [ you may need to see this piece about the ncaa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px8bxh3sjn0 ) . 
  tl ; dr : they do n't , schools falsify and/or inflate scores and the only reason it seems that they do n't pay the athletes is just so they can increment their profits . 
  there is a whole discussion here on mexico about this , both when foreginer players play for us and viceversa . 
  when it 's a foreginer player ( vuoso , sinha , chilindrina , franco , lobos , gimenez ) , a lot of the discussion is centered on how this `` foreginers '' where not only undeserving of the shirt , but also blocking `` true '' mexican talent . 
  on the other side , when a player eligible for the nt plays for another country ( yarbough , ponce ) , the discourse centers on how such young talents have `` to go to other teams to get an opportunity '' . 
  there is also this weird animosity on mexican-americans not beign really mexicans , making them also not `` fully capable to be on the nt '' . 
  it gets worst when chivas is on the mix . 
  there was an scandal back in the late 2000s about padilla 's birthplace , since he was from california , but chivas billed him from jalisco to prevent any backlash from the fans . 
  there is also ocegueda , who was blocked from any participation with the team and almost send back to tigres because he was born in us ; people bitching about brizuela on beign bought and zendeja 's case was the worst , he must now refuse any call from the us to even be part of chivas . 
  as for current plaeyrs , lasts one were brizuela ( double nationality ) and vuoso ( foregin ) . 
  i would say `` no '' , but we are talking about the wwe , a promotion that conditioned most of its modern fanbase to only remember what happened two months ago . 
  that is why the feud is now coming a little off , since most of the build up is based on information that the promotion made useless due to their own methods . 
   i do n't think that the ncaa being corrupt has anything to do with this discussion . 
  it is not so much that the ncaa is corrupt , but that the `` education '' that they `` receive '' , on which part of the argument that i responded is based on , is bullshit . 
   that 's like saying fifa is corrupt so messi should become an accountant . 
  fifa and the ncaa are two different organisations whose responsabilities only match on orginizing football matches , so your analogy is pretty incompetent . 
   ... the 17 year old kid playing college soccer is getting his piece of paper that will be worth on average 5-20 million dollars throughout his lifetime . 
  the ncaa might not care about education , but you can bet your ass that fortune 500 companies do . 
  you did n't see the video . 
  my tl ; dr summary was centered just on the argument of `` going to stanford '' , it did n't talk about what happens to athletes after collage . 
  if they ** even ** finish collage . 
  first of all , what skills do they have ? 
  on * the business of amateurs * , the student-athletes explain that most of their courses are bullshit made to get them the 3.0 gpa that the ncaa asks from them , not to give them any skills for their , and i quote from you :, 
   ... ( collage degree ) that will be worth on average 5-20 million dollars throughout his lifetime, 
  they have so little skills that in * broken * , athletes that actually made it to the nfl had no knowledge to prepare him to his life outside the sport .
