  some of them had no knowledge on taxes or business managment . 
  that is if they get drafted , because then it gets worst . 
  kyle hardrick lost his scholarship from ou and had to abandon school altogether since he could n't afford it ( see * money madness * ) . 
  david stanley was expelled on his fourth year ( see * pony excess * ) . 
  and that is not uncommon . 
  so you have a system that teaches almost no skills to their student-athletes other than playing a sport , and those that get injured or thrown out for any reason have even less , with only less than 2 percent of them going pro in the us . 
  do you think they will make it outside if they are not drafted ? 
  some of them , like dupree , use their image to sell , but even then not all the players have such levels of charisma . 
  it is true that universities have the responsability of paying the fourth year , unless the student was dropped or lose its scholarship due to `` reasonable concerns '' , but most of them still must play for the scolarship . 
  so you have this big bunch of ex-student-athletes with no skill , a paper that is worthless , barely any connections , no union , no workers compensation for injuries and no image to work from . 
  who the fuck is going to hire them ? 
  the fortune 500 companies you mention mostly use ex-student-athletes as representatives , who is going to hire player 45 from mediocre football program ? 
   also , do n't just throw up john oliver clips like it 's actual research . 
  he 's a comedian with a staff of writers who browse newspaper archives , not a college professor . 
  i put a john oliver clip because it explained in a quick and concise manner a situation that tends to be romanticized by ignorants and people that swallow their propaganda . 
  is it the best ? 
  no , but it works as an introduction to a problem . 
  also , do you have any idea what you actually said in your last sentence ? 
  do you know how does journalism work ? 
  do you think that a college professor does not have `` staff of writers who browse newspaper archives '' ? 
  pathetic, 
   this is correct , but again , who cares really ? 
  [ jimmy johnson made a superbowl winning team with that , you ignorant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybuehzepofy ), 
  so yeah , it does matter . 
  that shoot of the pills during the last part of `` hurt '' was great , you went with the original video of the song and transfered to wrestling 's vices . 
  that is a reason why a i mostly buy multiplayer games or active-updates on steam and have a torrented back up of my favorite games . 
  you only pay the right to play the game , not the game itself . 
  that is a normal red flag , you have no ownership of anything . 
  you must always have a plan b. 
  no wonder falir turn him on so many times, 
  you know , this serie has given me an example of what could happen on a cruz azul vs atlas final, 
  free labor, 
  tala , chuy had an average season with some weird mistakes and ocha is having an awful season , bar a game against barcelona , where he is one of the most scored goalkeepers on the main european leagues . 
  good point , the verb has been edited, 
  yes , but they cut costs on infrestructure since everything will be done from the `` hero '' 's own infrestructure . 
  they would probably not even buy newer computers for them . 
   because remember , we 're all citizens of planet earth . 
  so , ask not for whom the bell tolls . 
  ask not whose neck is being stepped on by the boot , it 's yours . 
  nice combination of both goethe and hemingway . 
  are n't they against safe spaces and echo chambers ? 
  ah , of course . 
  it is never acceptable unless it is for them . 
  there are times where i wonder how come you candidate is worse than ours . 
  ( from mexico ), 
  seeing / r/the _ meltdown and recent / r/the _ donald posts , they been showing some yuge amounts of maga !, 
  in the form of paranoia and posts of trumpster voting on `` cucked '' states . 
  ugh , i just felt dirty . 
  i sincerly doubt that arizona is democrat . 
  considering their immigration policies . 
  can he actually fist something with those tiny hands, 
  are you really trying to use reason on a the_donald commenter ? 
  [ i want to think that it went like this before today ] ( https://thenib.com/dicks-on-strike-for-asshole?t=recent ), 
  they will implode , posts mocking trump will overwhelm them until they make it private and ban people left and right . 
  by the time they go back to piblic , a lot of active users will simple leave and the rest will stay until a new racist comes around . 
  on a good scenario , their temper tantrum and the splash of their users on other sub will get them at least quarentined and some of then shadowbanned . 
  best case scenario the admins will use the same hammer they used on fph and c ******* since the campaign has ended ( the main ( apparent ) reason they have n't banned it . ), 
  ... have they banned you yet ? 
  i am remembering a line of watchman, 
   sure , in wwii ( to split/flee ) . 
  in wwiii , where 's to split to ? 
  when wwii , the mccarthy era and other mistakes of humanity happened , one could flee to country far away . 
  in some cases , those countries could become hostile ( see w benjamin ) , but there was a space of time enough to flee again . 
  but now , with the drones , the satellites , the nukes , the madman on control ... 
  where can we split to ? 
  i keep thinking that paula heyman is going to appear to finish the promo, 
  you forgot when flair double cross him at halloween havo ' 95 , during a short sting as a tag team :, 
  * [ promo where they ally , along with a special warning from dusty rhodes ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6lwcn_sting-agrees-to-be-ric-flair-s-part_sport ), 
  * [ a match previous to halloween havoc ' 95 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzeoyd22p_0 ), 
  * [ arn anderson & brian pillman vs sting & flair ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1wa2gd_10-29-1995-halloween-havoc-pt3_lifestyle ), 
  at this point , i would not be impressed if big poppa pump became a candidate . 
  we have n't compete in a while , apparently concacaf did n't want mexico to play to conmebol tournaments . 
  i do n't , i would prefer another loss from river over winning a shit tournament against whatever mls team gets to the final, 
  let him dream , dammit . 
  it is till real for him !, 
  guerron , what happened to you ? 
  thanks op, 
  * no , a lot of my friends have recommended it to me , but my pc ( at the time ) could not even play bioshock . 
  as for the series , it looks kind of my type of genre ( dark fantasy ) , but i ** suck ** at most videogames , so it may take a while to finish it . 
  * as for music , i tend listen old ones or kind of niche songs . 
  but from this year it would be theopany 's new album . 
  i am also currently seeing what was released this year and thinking to myslef `` wow , i am really not with the times '' . 
  he managed mostly third and second division teams in spain . 
  his only two first division teams were rayo vallecano , his most successful team where he ** almost ** obtained an european position , and granada . 
  on both occasions he left on disgrace , relegating the first and being fired from the second after 6 games . 
  some people in this sub are saying that his style is great , but so were they saying from boy 's and it send them right to the 14th place of the cociente table . 
  this looks like another failure from the club . 
  on the plus side , cruz azul will at least fail with style . 
  or so it seems . 
  it is either to prevent the downvotes ( see the whole chadpc affaire , people downvoted him so much that his main account and later alts were unusable ) , or to prevent people to check his history . 
  hugo is not that young , it would be like calling palos `` the future of tigres '', 
  welcome to the mexican model . 
  nah , one of the main problems of our football is the playoff system , which makes teams that worked hard for the first place fall against the 8th team . 
  we even had teams that won the league that were mediocre on the regular season , and most teams that are leader of the reg season do not win the league . 
  granted , it also does n't help the cociente table nor the short format , but the playoff system is one of the unholy trinity . 
  as for your example , playoff works as a system on the usa due to the size of the country ( see also : brazil ) . 
  it is not made for competitivity nor for entretainment , it is made for simple convenience . 
  edit : also , this :, 
   also players are afforded the opportunity to rest more often and , in the long run , more fit when playing . 
  that is because there is unlimited subs , not because the playoff system .
