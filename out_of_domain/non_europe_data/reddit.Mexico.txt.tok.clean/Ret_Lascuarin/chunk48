  unam and u de g actually have actual power of the team . 
  some universities teams still exists on the amateur leagues , and some were sold by their universities ( tecos , precious owner uag ), 
  did n't cirilo saucedo used also this kind of stuff ? 
   yep i 've heard it 's a tradition that goes back to aztec warriors, 
  kayfabe on 4 accounts, 
  * 1 . - the first masked luchador started wrestling in guanjuato , a state nowhere near the sphere of influence of the aztec empire . 
  * 2 . - the first masked luchador was cicl\u00f3n mckey , an irish-american, 
  * 3 . - masks were used in mexico before the foundation of the aztec empire . 
  * 4 . - the explosion of popularity of the masked wrestler was during the 40s and 50s , two decades were a lot of things were connected to the aztecs in an attempt to create a national identity after the revolution . 
  armchair analysis :, 
  rayados will win , while tigres have created more chances , rayados ' chances are more clear ( specially charas ' chance ) . 
  not only that , they 're the more rested team which allows them to play a faster counterattack style . 
  unless rayados collapses or luck smiles to tigres , the game will go to rayados . 
  returning to tigres would be a bad choice , too many options for any of his positions . 
  nahuel , right ? 
  whether we win or lose this game , there is no world where your team won that final, 
   damian in , juninho out, 
  tuca is truly going all in . 
  nahuel almost makes an own goal . 
   china ? 
  seriously , how cool would a story about the totally-unknown-in-the-west and absolutely enormous and tragic front in china be ? 
  i doubt they would even attempt to get anywhere near to the rapefest that was the chinese front . 
  you do realize they now also smuggle natural resources and sell to more markets than the us , right ? 
  they simply do n't depend on weed to produce most of their profits , they also control the production and extraction of natural resources in some states , as well as the distribution of said products . 
  they have diversified so much that even a worldwide weed legalization would only a superficial dent the machine , but not weakened, 
  dick . 
  almost got on a confrontation with mum because she caught him cutting the line at an elections . 
  what i most shocked about it is how he double downs in the comments . 
   edit : please do n't pm me asking to enter if you got banned from the sub : /, 
  wow , that 's really sad . 
  that sounds like a kink where you renact cactus jack 's matches naked and fucking, 
  toluca, 
  edu vargas 6/10 very incosistent , but tends to contribute when in form, 
  advincula 6/10 good sub , not enough games, 
  lucum\u00ed nr/10 barely any playtime to rate, 
  rumor is that he will go alongside herrera , aviles and guido for micky , darwin and romero, 
  a lot of teams tend to just ask for contract status or certain clauses , most of the rumors are just echos of such inquiries . 
  as for the xolos-america situation , a lot of reporters claim they will pay both with cash and players . 
  apparently they will pay herrera 's contract with cash , but the players will be with both players and cash, 
  with necaxa no one knows what exactly is happening , so must of the rumors smell like bullshit . 
  i doubt that puch is beign offered 20m a year in china ( as is the rumor ) and mceachen is beign sold to 2nd division after buying him, 
  doubt it , he is now in europe ( turkey ) after rescinding his contract with emelec . 
  fox sports is apparently the one with rights here in mexico , do n't know how it is in the us, 
  well , though luck . 
  francotirador and some others mention that he is the one talking with goltz about his possible move to boca jrs , something that was never permitted to la volpe, 
  sorry , most sources indicate that the rumor is from 2016 , when he was with emelec . 
  also , no rumors indicate wether he stays on europe or exits from colon, 
  they are , but apparently pumas wont be accepting them back, 
  no idea , the only ones whose future have been talked by sergio egea are those four . 
  apparently there were racist chants from one of the stands , or so they say . 
  aparently he will exit on his own terms , though i 'm not sure if he will follow his own words or they will make him follow them, 
  apparently some scouts from leon were seen on some chileans league game, 
  well , aparently it 's reliable enough for [ record ] ( http://www.record.com.mx/futbol-futbol-nacional-liga-mx-cruz-azul/cruz-azul-ya-tendria-sondeado-su-primer-refuerzo-para-el ), 
  so a couple of things :, 
   ... the draft pretty much goes hand in hand with the lack of free agency ... 
  this statement is false , free agency does exist in mexico . 
  however , the draft does block a lot of players when attempting to obtain said status , something highly unethical . 
   so pulido is an example , he claimed that he last signed a contract for tigres that ended in 2014 , so he believed that he was a free agent and wanted to try his luck in europe . 
  tigres said they had a signed contract with him until 2016 . 
  well , he left anyway blah , blah , we know what happened while he was over there . 
  anyways , when he came back to mexico to sign with chivas , they paid olympiacos 6m or whatever but they still paid tigres like 10m even though his contract would 've been over by 2016 since he is a canterano of tigres . 
  he did n't just went to europe to `` prove his luck '' , he already knew about olympiakos ' offer , who used levadiakos as cannon fodder and backed pulido through the whole ordeal . 
  also , the first sell was for the card of the player , since it was never owned by levadiakos , olympiakos and pulido . 
  as for the 6.5 m that was `` paid '' to olympiakos , rumor has it that it was actually money owned to tigres due to fines from the ordeal and the legal fees . 
  and as a final note , the academy fee is not something only used in mexico, 
    the fact that it is a one-day occurrence sometimes forces through deals that really do n't make sense for anybody involved and bad contractual situations can occur . 
  this also affects those whose contracts have runned up . 
  there are players and agents of players that have to pretty much beg to the teams ' representatives for a spot in any team ,, 
  there is also the fact that if fucks ups some teams outside the league . 
  i remember when doing a transfer thread during the draft reading in a colombian sportswriter 's twitter that some representatives from colombian clubs ( i think it was atletico and some others ) had to go and beg for some players that were both playing or negotiating with them to not be sold . 
  so it damages both national and foregin players . 
  there rest is good . 
  who 's your papa now , montes ? 
  while i am ** not ** a rayados fan , i am currently the op of the [ apertura 2017 transfer thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6aozli/apertura_2017_transfer_thread/ ) , so i can only say who is rumored to exit . 
  since turco 's contract renewal , there 's been the rumor that there will be sweeping of some assets in favor of newer and younger talent , though that does n't mean said talent will be national rather than foregin . 
  the strongest rumors are that of walter gargano , dorlan pabon and , for some reason , sevilla is apparently looking to buy edwin cardona . 
  cachorro will also exit , mostly due to many `` big '' offers from some liga mx teams , specially chivas . 
  rumors has him returning to mexico , not staying in italy , also the strongest rumor is montes for salcedo, 
  that 's rayados if you mean about liga mx 's finals, 
  lucas lobos precedes gignac as a player with european experience , before that it was luis garcia , and before that it was marco ruben , and before all of them there was claudio `` piojo '' lopez . 
  possibly , after all agents tend to `` leak '' a lot of bullshit all the time . 
  just look at tigres rumored next signings , like they will convince a 24 years old to leave ac milan , come on . 
  even though he was heavily rumored right after sosa 's firing , i still wanted someone better to direct necaxa . 
  considering the amount of teams rumored to get him , this is a solid move by both morelia and ruidiaz, 
   why is almeyda rumored out ? 
  [ almeyda recognized said interest ] ( http://www.espn.com.mx/futbol/nota/_/id/3130079/almeyda-acepta-interes-del-alaves-pero-se-dice-feliz-en-chivas ) and pellegrino is apparently not continuing as alaves dt . 
  as for ochoa , rumor is he wants to go back , but america is not looking for a goalkeeper , so most of fingers point to cruz azul in case chuy leaves . 
  i 'm guessing europe for both cause otherwise this wo n't make sense . 
  apparently if the montes - salcedo swap does not finalize , they will use zaldivar and cisnero to get him . 
   was n't benedetto not wanted in america anymore or whats the deal here ? 
  no idea , but apparently they are keeping all their options open in case the darwin , romero , arroyo - aviles , valenzuela , rodriguez swap just does n't come through, 
  it 's america , they live and die with bomb signings , not academy players . 
   rick steiner is apparently planning on going to law school, 
  i know that rick `` the dog faced gremlin '' steiner and robert rechsteiner are two different people , but i can not stop imagining rick entering to defend his thesis with [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvigwyy_pto ), 
   * dear ted : ... you and your * ** pro-wrasslin ' company ** * ... *,

  the guys at espn say that lakers will take ball mostly for his star power , not his basketball abilities .
