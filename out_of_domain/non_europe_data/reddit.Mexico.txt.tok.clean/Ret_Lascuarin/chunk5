  so really , there is little to win for mexico at the fifa rankings and so much to win for jamaica . 
  that is one name i have n't heard in a while, 
  well , there goes any attempt to winning the gold cup, 
  hence why we have been on free fall since the 2014 wc, 
  dunno , `` 50 mil for a substitute '' ? 
  til, 
  what if they did n't award the penalty both on the gold cup 2015 semifinals and at the 2014 wc round of 16 ? 
  what if they called the offside in the round of 16 at the 2010 wc ? 
  what if la roca was n't such an idiot to call a bunch of teenagers to play the 1978 wc ? 
  relegated : puebla, 
  promoted : necaxa ( hopefully ), 
  yes , and those times were panama injuried players and continued the game like it was nothing ? 
  let 's be honest , the only fair play i have ever seen was one of netherlands back in 2010 , and it was only a corner . 
  tbf , that 's kind of the norm on football . 
  i have heard racist chants against chicharito on a game against valencia . 
  kind of the norm on italy . 
  swastikas on croatia . 
  racist insults from fans of america and pumas . 
  yeah , miguel herrera made a mistake with the game plan that day . 
  still ... it hurts man, 
  nah , its just weird that they are singleing out russia , specially from countries with worse records . 
  still , i am mostly angry of the reaction of the russian fa than of villas-boas, 
  yup , its usa , then mexico and then costa rica . 
  they literally lost 27 positions, 
  the time rayados were winning a lot with vucetich, 
  he probably thought something more like this . 
   what would tevez or huntlaar do in the same situation ? 
  hence why he said `` puta '' and shoot the penalty . 
  wait , i almost forgot about that ... 
  ** shame on you , you hypocrites !, 
  considering the state of football , they would be lucky to get an awnser that most probably is just a `` no '' . 
  also , during chile 's 1962 wc , one of the fa literally suspended his own player due to his conduct on the field . 
  ** i dare you , i double dare you to tell that to any of them , or any football fan from the ex-yugoslavia !, 
  stop defending during the last 60 min , we already lost a final because of that . 
  probably de gea , if they can manage to buy him on the apparently weird trade off of ramos + cash . 
  that last goal made me wonder why was he rated so high . 
  + / u/user _ simulator / u/ret _ lascuarin, 
  its magic man , but mine will probably just mentioning of yashin and porn, 
  ... okay , that was weird, 
  but i found dad on it , which makes it weirder , considering i only mentioned him once on reddit, 
  + / u/user _ simulator [ 2 ] / u/viro _ lopes, 
  the `` playing together '' part, 
  go back to see the image , he jumped before the contact . 
  and its different than what happened on the wc , since the called an inexistant foul , and i still do n't know what they called in the semis . 
  yes , a player of tigres on the starting xi, 
  well , get someone [ creative ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c_hrer_mcq ) . 
  and he is one of the greatest players to ever live , next to pele and actual motor of the brazilian team during 1962 wc, 
  one of the best writers of uruguay , galeano , described him as the clown chief of the circus . 
  did you see the gold cup semifinal m\u00e9xico vs panama ? 
  that is what it looks with a mexican manager . 
  lahm from ~ ~ left ~ ~ right back to defensive midfielder . 
  jorge campos from striker to goalkeeper . 
  harsh , mate . 
  harsh . 
  still , true . 
  a world cup and a few titles with bayern m\u00fcnich are the main reason . 
  still , he was n't ** as ** good as before . 
  ** that explains that penalty against panama **, 
  since 2014 , only managed a few games to classify to the wc . 
  the thing is herrera is good to take preexisting schemes , models and players , adapt it to his 5-3-2 , and then make the team more efficient in a short period of time , but he sucks as a long term coach . 
  nop , [ defensive midfielder ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_fifa_world_cup_group_g ) . 
  get yer facts straight, 
  two from tigres and one ex-rayados !, 
  yes mate , the racial tensions on the balkans existed since the days of the austro-hungar empire and remains to this very day . 
  also , the language barrier is high in that team . 
  hence the price lou boy, 
  the gold cup is every two years , both winners play a playoff game for the only position in the confederation cup for the concacaf, 
  nah , guardado was from atlas . 
  i meant with due\u00f1as and torres nilo , both from tigres , and tecatito , who began at rayados . 
  oribe also played for rayados , did n't knew that until today . 
  i remember him for his hand at the 2010 wc , you know , that one where he prevented a goal to them by playing like a goalkeeper . 
  here at mexco it will be a race between nacho ambriz from america and sergio bueno from cruz azul . 
   because of this , a fully information-based economy would only exacerbate the problems of the technology gap , reinforcing capitalism . 
  ** this . 
  at least with bueno the fans have the knowledge that he was the last option , while ambriz was the first one . 
  mate , femexfut did n't fire aguirre after he kicked a rival player during a wc classification game on the field , they will just call it quits and hide everything under the rug . 
  messi at barca , gaitan at tigres from 2000 to 2006 ( also played nu\u00f1ez during that time ) , the rayados of pasarella and midas , the bofo during mid 2000s , the boca of tevez , palermo and riquelme, 
  i also know for a fact that palencia has a football manager license . 
  maybe campos , the other was chhitiva but he was already a manager . 
  also , xabi alonso and iniesta, 
  nobody can be franz beckenbauer , he is as unique as garrincha and yashin both by their time and their skill, 
  [ exihbit a of a fa that does not give a fuck of their employees behaviour ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6uw0b8dukq ), 
  sorry , read it wrong . 
  i meant of herrera , not tuca . 
  still , a bad choice , he has a tendency of fucking it up the last moments of game and getting on fights with the players . 
  i 'll erase my previous coment . 
  dammit shev , why did you went to chelsea ? 
  he is out , no question about it . 
  nah , king midas is angry for being fired after two games, 
  he must be out , no questions, 
  [ proof ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fx9nofoizo ), 
  aquino is injured, 
  worse , he fucks up the last 20 min of game . 
  in a wc , that means death, 
  and on other videos herrera goes to help her , as well as some friend of hiim, 
  but it helps to prove martinoli 's description of the event, 
  i hope not , but hey , well see on those two wensdays, 
  he went for the balls , man . 
  great , you were great at the wc , but the rest of your tenure as a manager was not as good and you have yet to mature from your days as a player of atlante . 
  hope this gives you some perspective on what never to do .
