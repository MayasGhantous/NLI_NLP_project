  the pacto last as long as the owners decide it last . 
  as for pulido , they originally paid tigres 12 million dollars for the rights while he was still playing for olympiakos for the rights, 
  not yet, 
  pulido 's contract did n't expire and [ the tas decidided in favor of tigres not pulido ] ( http://www.excelsior.com.mx/adrenalina/2015/09/07/1044420 ) , so get your facts straight, 
  one of the pilars of el pacto is that if a player leaves to another league and returns to liga mx , the previous team has to consent . 
  in other words , when rafa went to leon , atlas had to consent to finalize the contract . 
  hence why it 's the fucking worst . 
   im saying if vela were to go to tigres , which he wont , there is a chance they wouldnt pay chivas anything , the guy has been there too long . 
  nop , chivas has the `` rights '' , it 's ridiculous , but that 's how it works , since vela never debuted on any first division team , but was part of one of those teams academies . 
  if , let 's say , he came from a branch of river plate , then yes , he can go to any team since no one has the `` rights '' over him . 
  the dos santos brothers could actually choose any team , since both started officially on la masia , barca 's academy . 
  hell , maybe all this bullshit is what keeps him from coming to liga mx , do you really want to sit down with vergara and argue that he does n't have any right over you , and that you never were really part of any of the squads to be really considered from chivas ? 
  i would n't, 
  for those who are wondering why the alleged confirmed deals are not official right now , a lot of the final negotiations start until 2 or 3 pm , they normally spend the morning doing nothing . 
  so was alvarado for tigres , wait until official confirmation from official channels of the club , when everything was signed by all the parties . 
  and the [ president of the club is pissed ] ( https://redgol.cl/2017/5/en-huachipato-se-resignan-al-fichaje-de-vi/ ), 
  the only connection bewteen liga mx 's and nfl 's drafts is that the player has no saying on wether they like the transfer or not , and sometimes they can stay unemployed until signed during the next draft . 
  [ puch is out ] ( https://twitter.com/clubnecaxa/status/872508946979803137 ), 
  [ just announce it already ] ( https://twitter.com/tuzos/status/872510855400837121 ), 
  two draft ago was worst , they started until 6 pm, 
  probably , but just thsi few minutes they have done a lot more transfers than the last one , so maybe there must be some sort of happy night at the night club todya , like a 2x1 in strippers or something . 
  he is not a petardo , he is a dick that will absolutely do nothing in case he is unhappy with the dt or the managment , that 's what happened at cruz azul . 
  martinolli, 
  rayados will apparently get salcedo ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ formontes, 
  i forecast you guys buying a midfielder 'cause he could play as an rb or lb , according to fifa fut, 
  yup , apparently it 's more of a bail and less of a full payment , i hope the reports i 'm hearing are wrong, 
  i hope not , and salcedo has been looking to stay on europe , wether it 's on fiorentina or not, 
   checks without funds and checks postfechados, 
  the herb adams of liga mx, 
  apparently morelia, 
  eibar is looking to buy cardona or guido rodrgiuez , they just lost one so they will probably charge full speed fr the other . 
  guido is apparently throwing wrenches to go to spain, 
  14 actually, 
  aquino wont go to chivas , they were asking 10m ** before ** the second leg of the final , then they upped to ** 30 million ** after that , same thing to due\u00f1as and damm . 
  they are managed by one of the richest companies of latin america , paying 15 million plus european wages is not that hard for them . 
  not good , pachuca is the heyman of liga mx , takes talented young men and makes them look better than they are . 
  damm is good and his speed is amazing , but he did n't know how to defend or how the dribble the defense without speed , and tuca has been using him as a great bench player . 
   unmotivated really, 
  shit , this wont end well with tuca 's managment skills, 
  i 'm not sure what 's happening , it maybe something to do with pacto de caballeros , but according to [ transfermarket ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/mauro-formica/transfers/spieler/55870/transfer_id/1300598 ) formica was a newell 's old boys player , not a cruz azul , however both [ cruz azul ] ( https://twitter.com/cruz_azul_fc/status/872575950415941632 ) and [ liga mx ] ( https://twitter.com/ligabancomermx/status/872576625434603520 ) announce it as it was from cruz azul to pumas, 
  he was permitted to play on the amateurs since both sides , management and player , despise each other to the point they permit him that just so he would n't be near the organization . 
  dammit , you won for a few seconds . 
  as for the price , rumor is that he arrives for free . 
  today is the only day for liga mx transfers inside the league , tomorrow is for ascenso mx ( 2nd division ) where a lot of unwanted players are sent . 
  ( and i use sent because they have no power over the negotiations ), 
  any transfer from the outside can be done during the transfer window . 
  they just choose to announce it today for the publicity . 
  looks like tigres will take his bench from the academy , the loaned kids from ascenso and the foregin markets . 
  apparently yes . 
  juan 's contract ends next month , and there is nothing stopping them from announcing it next month . 
  however , right after twitting it , rayados twitted a summary of his career while having a pinned tweet over the reactivation of the abono . 
  they will probably use him as an special attraction , just as queretaro used ronaldinho . 
  he will probably play for some games , if not all of them . 
  the draft is over , but we have entered in an unexpected ** overtime ** , overwatch style . 
  yup , apparently rayados did everything they could , and some more , to protect tigres ' fans, 
  if rumors are to be believe , then no one like higera and vergara , and the rest have been either blocked , bullied or just convinced by inge to not sell to chivas . 
  nico has a clause that forbids beign sold to any liga mx club , so i doubt about that . 
  maybe beyond midnight, 
  yup , it was also reported by record about chivas failing to get chucky and aquino , pachuca told them he is already sold to an european team and tigres upped the already negotiated price of 10 million to 30 million . 
  well , is n't that sweet for everyone else . 
  thanks rayados , for giving goals to the more needed ones . 
  you are right , we have nahuel for that . 
  with the only difference is that he is just inconsistent , not incompetent :d, 
  also , i hope they do n't block hugo by using him as an special attraction . 
  i stopped reading/watching naruto a while back , has the new serie been any good , or just the same thing with new characters ? 
   1-2 extremly late foreign signings that were scouted on fifa, 
  ftfy, 
  thanks for the info . 
  how the fuck where they fooled ? 
  medina 's hair is literally flowing in the background !, 
  apparently they could , but right now they have n't done any , so who knows, 
  if it 's sutcliffe , it 's good as gold . 
  no wonder they can only get the players that were loaned to chiapas , but not people like estigarriba, 
  he survived . 
  that 's not the must insulting part , the fact that they mention that rayados when above and beyond of what it 's expected it 's what really adds insult over injury . 
  milton 's status changed from [ loaned ] ( https://twitter.com/fichajesfutmex/status/872639871067856896 ) to [ sold ] ( https://twitter.com/ligabancomermx/status/872644423301177344 ), 
  [ ~ ~ tigres has finalized his participation on this draft ~ ~ ] ( https://twitter.com/record_mexico/status/872648799193370625 ), 
  [ and we 're still in the game ] ( https://twitter.com/lobosbuapmx/status/872650474297720832 ), 
  ~ ~ this better be just a loan , motherfuckers ~ ~, 
  it is one , but i 'm still pissed , severly, 
  but what if it was n't ? 
  puebla can only sell . 
  tigres is out , and i 'm severly pissed, 
  palmera is out with option to be bought . 
  * bought *, 
  and the rest is killing our bench, 
  tigres , please ... just stop, 
  i am sad and pissed , they barely gave a tweet to * palma * and was sent with option to be bought . 
  and the rest were important to the squad , both as bench and starting players . 
  i hope they bring a bunch of class a players , otherwise this was just stupid . 
  [ puebla is now open to negotiations ] ( https://twitter.com/carlos_ponz/status/872674416454488064 ) [ semi-confirmed by puebla , posted this tweet just now , 11:55 p.m. ] ( https://twitter.com/clubpueblamx/status/872678561135697920 ), 
  [ the draft will end around 1 a.m. ] ( https://twitter.com/record_mexico/status/872675890051862528 ), 
   is about to black friday up in this bitch !, 
  i am totally ~ ~ coping ~ ~ copying this when this shit come up again next season . 
  he is good at short distances and fast with an impressive acceleration , he is also good at reading tactics and helping coordinate stuff on the fly . 
  hell , tuca used to ask his opinion at some games when the tactics where failing . 
  he is just a ** dick ** , and if he gets pissed at the dt or the management , he is willing to just do absolutely nothing for you . 
  he was such a dick that cruz azul let him play at amateur level just so he could get out of the team . 
  pumas is looking for forwards since nico is , allegedly , going to europe, 
  i hope so too,
