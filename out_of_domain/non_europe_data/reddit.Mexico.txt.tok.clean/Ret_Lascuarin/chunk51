  shitty , chargoy should have sold the teams . 
  nil , they will probably do a chelsea , buy and send him loaned to the original team . 
  [ jaguares is out and will not participate in ascenso mx ] ( https://twitter.com/medranoazteca/status/872690872835612672 ), 
  of course , how silly of me . 
  the mullet connection . 
  [ shit hit the fan with canelo , cruz azul can fail at it again ] ( https://twitter.com/record_mexico/status/872691838989348865 ), 
  nop , liga mx reports that it 's owned by atlas , not puebla , no idea how that worked out , but so they say, 
  they apparently returned for the last moments, 
  ffs !, 
  just !, 
  stop !, 
  well , fuck him for thinking we will sell him for less than what we bought him . 
  i do n't care about banega !, 
  i care about the qui\u00d1ones and the advinculas and the rest of the bench !, 
  [ the plot thickens ] ( https://twitter.com/carlos_ponz/status/872695284912074752 ),

  [ holy shit ] ( https://twitter.com/record_mexico/status/872698259042689024 ), 
  in the middle of chiapas collapse ? 
  well , shit , hope that was the last of tigres ' loans . 
  [ around the 6th of june , one of the main accountants of chargoy severed links with the institution , two days later said institution ceases to exist ] ( https://twitter.com/chiapas_fc/status/872126899904020484 ), 
  just stahp, 
  club de cuervos is tame in front of this . 
  tigres and the police of san nicolas de los garza give free coffee and cobertores to those that sleep outside the stadium , maybe if the took a bus ... 
  [ journalis : and the players ( of chiapas ) ? 
  guztavo guzman ( atlas ' president ) : you sell them tomorrow ... they tried today to atleast keep the teams afloat and they could n't , tomorrow we 'll see . 
  he is shady , apparently he worked as loophole fider , as well as beign chargoy 's right man . 
  [ there are no players registered of playing in chiapas right now ] ( http://archive.is/q1sdc ), 
  mateus gon\u00e7alves , jonathan fabbro , diego de la torre , marcelo estigarribia , luis leal , f\u00e9lix micolta , christian ` hobbit ' berm\u00fadez , luis \u00c1ngel quick mendoza, 
  [ and with this i am going to sleep ] ( https://twitter.com/record_mexico/status/872705389997039616 ), 
   wheres afm ? 
  probably calling the chiapas players, 
  nico is negotiating with villareal , and no team of liga mx would buy him due to beign unavailable to them . 
  he is now with america, 
  yeah, 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  for fuck our bench and fuck the loyalty of some of our players and fuck you for believing there will be a big player coming from the draft, 
  they are looking ot get cards from telmex , those cellphones are long gone, 
  goddamn , i should 've spell check the post . 
  thanks, 
  it 's not exactly a draft , the teams of the league congrage for a week in * la semana del futbol * where they make the schedule , some people presentations , etc. 
  on two days ( 7 ^ th and 8 ^ th of june ) there are two transfer windows ( or drafts ) opened only for a day , one for liga mx ( 1 ^ st division ) and another for ascenso mx ( 2 ^ nd division ) . 
  that is the only day that teams can do transfer between each other , international transfers are not bound to this limitations . 
  also , one thing that the draft in mexico and the draft in usa sports have in common is that the players do not have any power over said transfer . 
  they can reject it , like alvarado to tigres or canelo to xolos , but they ca n't initiate or participate in the negotiations . 
  that 's the only thing they have un common . 
  just one thing , there are two teams in monterrey ( tigres and rayados ) , both of them use monterrey when talking about themselves ( most commonly done by rayados ) . 
  [ why do you think ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/jkhx5w7jowi?t=40s ), 
  they are owned/management by one of the biggest companies of latin america , and this would not be the first european player that gets payed european wages ( though that was luis garcia ) . 
  * pollo * has been sent to the inferiors in veracruz , and then tigres send him back there . 
  that sounds actually worst, 
  thank god you have never watched tv azteca or any bolivian game . 
  none , i believe more in sutcliffe that said that celta de vigo will be his new team, 
  there are a bunch of loans ** from ** jaguares to other teams , apparently the rumor that they simply put the team on the freezer are true , which saddens me . 
  return from loan , you mean, 
  no , but they ( herrera and pe\u00f1a ) apparently just [ obtained their visa to play in scotland ] ( http://www.marca.com/claro-mx/futbol/mexicanos-mundo/2017/06/10/593b2fce268e3e5a0d8b45c2.html ), 
  he despises us ... apparently he seriously thought that he had the ability to win the starting xi position from either guerron , sobis or gignac, 
   esqueda took tigres to the libertadores final . 
  nop , that was guerron , esqueda pretty much entered when there was nothing to be lost , he scored on a game where the result has worthless ( 3 goals in the last group game , juan aurich - tigres ) and only two goals on the knockout stages . 
   could have won the whole thing if they did n't sign gignac . 
  probably true , gignac was n't confortable to play with the team or to play the southamerican style . 
  if guerron started on both finals , we would have won the libertadores . 
  yeah , * thanks for reminding me of that * ^ ^ ^ ^ fuckesqueda, 
  not exactly , it depends on whether chiapas declares bankruptcy or not . 
  if they actually declare it , then the team will be desaffiliated as a professional team . 
  if not , the team will continue as a team in ascenso , preferably without chargoy in the organization . 
  [ here is also what happens to the players who are now unemployed ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6h0hzs/on_the_current_status_of_chiapas_the_dead/ ), 
  they 're stating three reasons for the protest :, 
  * reason 1 : the non-stop increase on the price of the season pass ( abono ), 
  * reason 2 : lack of world-class transfers ( they are really jealous over gignac , sobis , vargas and the apparent transfer of bryan ruiz and ever banegas ), 
  * reason 3 : lack of titles since apertura 2010 ( jealousy strikes back ), 
  jealousy , tigres won 3 seasons and was twice runner up since apertura 2010 ( the last season rayados won ) , while rayados only have 2 runner ups since then . 
  did we bitch like this when we lost 7-0 to toluca ? 
  the thing with tigres is that they not only have an open checkbook , they also have great negotiators that sell the team as a better option over other offers . 
  and banegas is in the perfect position to be brought . 
  not only banegas just had one of his worst seasons in europe , inter is also having an overhaul of players and staff , and there is the precedent over going to `` lower '' leagues when an european campaign is not coming through, 
  do you know how much did it cost before the stadium was built ? 
  it 's more than what palencia wanted to give him, 
  facilitate transfer between the two teams , and work together on developing players apparently, 
  not even the same type of insult , the n-word was conceived since the start as an insult to africans or people of african descent ; `` puto '' starts as a synonymus of coward , which is the insult lobied to the goalkeeper . 
  i wonder what would happen if they found a white mexican or an argentinian ? 
  i would try to sweeten the deal with regeneration and beauty for 4500 year into the past , no offense but this face ai n't getting me laid and i am not going to smash a thousend guitars while not drawing a dime . 
  they 're going to stop the game for the * putos * chant , they seem to really into whiteknighte mode, 
  tweet is down , [ here is the confirmation from pachuca ] ( https://twitter.com/tuzos/status/875806378182529024 ), 
  tweet is down again , [ new tweet here ] ( https://twitter.com/tuzos/status/875810304076255233 ), 
  you are right , but nowhere in pachuca 's network says he left ,, 
  [ he still appears as a player of pachuca ] ( http://tuzos.com.mx/t1516/plantel-profesional/ ), 
  i bought him for less in fm, 
   the people yelling this shit will one day realize they were a part of the problem . 
  and you not realizing what the word means will be looked like a complete idiot when the history books are written . 
  maybe not them , but there may be fifa representatives , and they may force the referee to follow their bull, 
  [ zubeld\u00eda , ex-manager of santos laguna , is the new manager of c.d. 
  alav\u00e9s , effectively squashing almeyda 's rumored transfer to said spanish club ] ( https://twitter.com/alaves/status/876024433328173056 ), 
  they will only play 16 teams ( 15 games per team ) , since coyotes de tlaxcala also ca n't play for the new rules regarding stadium size . 
  as for the players , the players commission will give them ( or gave them ) until the 4 ^ th of september to get a team . 
   every contract renewal we 've ever had has been announced . 
  yes , but not the rejected ones , and not with this amount of venom . 
  grow up . 
   america just wants to import young colombians to there team, 
  pretty much , tigres is about to do the same thing with junior,
