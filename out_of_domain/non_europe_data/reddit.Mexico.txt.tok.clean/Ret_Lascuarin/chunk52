  exiting free , since either no one wanted him or he refused all offers from the league, 
  also , cruz azul was the one that pushed the hardest for him , and even then they lost their target . 
  this transfer window is constantly hitting everyone from their blind side , thankfully cruz azul maintains the order by fucking up their transfers . 
  wait , hold on , tigres is going to have a working agreement with junior of baranquilla and now they will also buy an entire peruvian team ? 
  holy shit, 
  everyone tends to forget that vargas plays for any team other than the nt . 
  tigres is creating a partnership with a colombian team , buying a peruvian team , both of them from their respectives first division , and they have yet to sign anyone to the team . 
   we have also signed a mexixan called carlos pena, 
  it 's already official ? 
  normally i just read and pass to a new article , but yayo stress the lack of four pilars that obstruct the flow of young blood to the team, 
  * director of the academy, 
  the recently fired one of the heads of developmental , as well as a sub-15 coach . 
  * casa club, 
  i am not sure what does he mean with that . 
  the lack of dorms for academy players , maybe ? 
  cruz azul does have [ recruitment process as well as football schools in mexico city and pachuca ] ( http://cruzazulfc.com.mx/reclutamiento/ ), 
  he refers to scouts independent of [ carlos hutado , who allegedly gets most of the players of cruz azul ] ( http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/editoriales/toque-filtrado/2016/01/hurtado-sigue-como-jefe-en-cruz-azul ) apparently he is the one that told billy that enzo roco played as a full-back . 
  * tours abroad, 
  no idea why , they can barely fill their own stadium . 
  he 's still a better dribbler than damm d :, 
  i 'll miss you t.t, 
  i know that a lot of people see players as just looking to the pay , but his surroundings also matter . 
  when gignac was brought , he was n't convinced just with the paycheck , the * inge * and his people sold him the city of monterrey , they showed the best private schools , they showed him the restaurants , the house and neighborhood where he lives . 
  l.a. , with all it 's pros , it 's still a devolping market when talking about football , and also a place where the house prices are exploding . 
  therefore the salary may not have the same buying power in l.a. than in monterrey . 
  not only that , trump 's america is showing it 's ugliest side and i doubt that gignac , a descendant of gypsies , would want to deal with that . 
  they had a bar that measure a team momentum on fifa 07 , would n't be impressed said mechanics still exist on later editions of fifa . 
  maybe , but it 's more chic to say `` i play in los angeles , city of stars '' than `` i play for tigres '', 
  fortunetly , that seems to be their only strategy, 
   not every state has the same agenda as donald trump . 
  same thing in mexico , not every state is a battle zone , but a lot of people generalize it like that . 
  however trump is still influecial and [ childs are quoting him when bullying other kids ] ( https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/kids-are-quoting-trump-to-bully-their-classmates?utm_term=.umwpkba1#.lokb0kbr ) , do you seriously think that anyone from outside would bring their kid to that shit ? 
   scientific fact : iq is a heritable trait , such that children of high iq parents , are more likely to be high iq , even if adopted . 
  ... that 's not ... do they read what they write ? 
  this remind me so much of the dzib-gardner affair in the upn , how come no one checked anything ? 
   the salary may not have the same buying power in l.a. than in monterrey . 
  in other words , even if he gets a better salary in l.a. galaxy , the prices on the city , specially those related to homes , will mkae said salary look smaller in comparision of what he could buy while playing in tigres . 
  like you say :, 
   la is a top city to live in if you have money . 
  but l.a. is a developing market on what respects to football , his pay will reflect that ( he is ** not ** beckham ) , and he is not going to live on a middle-class suburb . 
  of course he is not , but do you think that 4.5 million will get him high-class life style in l.a. ? 
   osorio 's tactics are how legends ** from new zealand ** are born,

  [ transfermarkt states that he was part of fc porto b since 2014 ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/igor-lichnovsky/transfers/spieler/209513/transfer_id/1797242 ), 
  bro , its bro not b bro, 
  next time someone says that concacaf has the worst refs i 'll show this clusterfuck of a game , specially the added time , 'cause not even geiger would do this shit . 
  hell , not even the worst mexican refs are this incompetent . 
  [ check it yourself , no red cards ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6iocha/mexico_vs_new_zealand_fight_confed_cup/ ), 
  he was suspended due to influencing the game with a non-existant call , which is incompetence at best or compromised at worst . 
  this ref ... he was just plain lazy and justa wanted the game to end . 
  his speed is a great asset , but he will remain as a good sub until he learns how to finish a play . 
   gio need to gtfo, 
  he needs to retire from the nt . 
   we should always be fielding our best . 
  friendlies are for experimentation , not fifa tournaments . 
  word . 
  that 's more than gio, 
  we were losing to a team of mostly semi-pros, 
  right now i am blaming osorio for everything, 
  just do n't put it as a cm osorio , that 's not where he plays . 
  [ that is n't a rumor ] ( http://www.ligabancomer.mx/cancha/detallenoticia/21016 ), 
  the actual quote says :, 
   the case ( of jaguares of chiapas ) was turn over to the executive committe of the fmf , where all the divisions and sections of mexican football are represented , and there it was decided to disaffiliate jaguares . 
  tigres lost him while buying deportivo cristal and creating a bridge with junior de barranquilla .

  the thing is that the toros neza that we remember was something that could only exist during that time , just as ecw could only exist on the mid to late 90s . 
  and just like ecw , people tend to overestimate their popularity . 
  look at the highlight reel , there are ** a lot ** of empty seats . 
  and the books were barely on the black , only survivng from excellent players obtained on the cheap ( with some exceptions ) . 
  it only took three bad years to disappear . 
  toros neza was nothing more than a fad , just like parma , tecos and chiapas . 
  we may remember all of them fondly thanks to great football , but none of them survived a string of bad years . 
  who are you rooting for ? 
  wish factorio was on sale :(, 
  i do n't know your tastes , but aoe 2 is on sale ( get only if you want to play online , if not the just torrent it ) , so is football manager , undertale , duck game , guns of icarus online and xcom . 
   have n't played it online, 
  it 's one of the hardest games when playing online , way more hardcore on rng and stats than xcom on it 's hardest mode . 
   startdew valley, 
  it 's harvest moon but with mods and better . 
  and i fucking love it . 
  with el hijo del santo , negro casas and onita , that 's like having a 3 star match with peak ric flair, 
  i 'm not sure , the thing with shadow of mordor is that i am not sure if my lap can actually run it ( same with wolfenstein , planet coster and many others ) , and factorio looks like something i would invest months on it , but it will never be on sale . 
  also , i do n't know if battlezone 98 is worth playing , but i loved two . 
  still have the disc somewhere .
