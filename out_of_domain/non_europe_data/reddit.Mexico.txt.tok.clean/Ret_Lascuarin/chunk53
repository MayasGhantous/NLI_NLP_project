  personally i would not even put vela , i would have aquino there so he can help defend . 
  aquino 's main advantage and disadvantage is that he only plays on the sides , never in the center and never as a midfielder , hence why he flourish in tuca 's scheme . 
  tigres : we have bought no one from the league , and all international rumors point to players we do n't need . 
  the only place we need to reinforce is the defense ( juninho is showing his age and ayala is 30 ) . 
  but what do they do ? 
  they send a bunch of the bench to other teams ( advincula and the qui\u00f1ones went to lobos , pollo and rivas to veracruz , and so on ) and buy ** no one ** during draft days ( the only days that transactions are allowed from inside the league , both in liga mx and ascenso mx ) . 
  none of the defensive players of the defunct jaguares is worth shit and all rumors point to midfielders and strikers . 
  we do n't need those , we need centerbacks , you idiots !, 
  also we are apparently buying deportivo cristal from peru in it 's entirety and creating a working relationship with junior de barranquilla . 
  for more info in liga mx rumors and transfers you can check this [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6aozli/apertura_2017_transfer_thread/ ) . 
  shit, 
  not sure if chicharito will be good in marseille , but aquino would adapt easily to bielsa 's scheme . ^ ^ ^ ^ butistillwanthimhere, 
  it sounds they will offload quintero to china , since the 100 % tax is blocking some transfers from european leagues . 
  i am more worried than frustrated , the inge ( the president of the team ) said that we will see more players from the academy ( beign the chelsea from liga mx is quite expensive ) , but our academies are so shit that some ex-tigres players send their kids to rayados ' academy so they can get some playing time . 
  also , damian * chilindrina * alvarez is retiring either this or next season , so there is also the need for a winger or two ( aquino is leaving since bielsa is looking for him , apparently ) . 
  just like chicha was n't in the u17 of gio and vela, 
  hope so , every rumor looks like mere smoke , but there is always the possibility of hit hitting the fan . 
  edu vargas is looking for a new team , he is [ great ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qzwgmcgrjm ) and [ scored against previous runner-ups . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/knq0jvi-0vu?t=6m12s ), 
  watford could probably fork 5 million for a 2 time copa america winner . 
  looks good, 
  yes , he can . 
  however , venezuela is not known as a football country , so obtainnig a team to invest on him would be difficult . 
  he will apparently be ready for germany , but i will edit in case that does n't happens . 
  you are right , due\u00f1as is in the one for the copa oro , not the confederaciones . 
  every generation has it 's beasts , for this one is gignac , for the others is cardozo , and there were even people before them better than both players that you ignore while getting wet with cardozo 's goals . 
  get pissed about the puto chant, 
  some group of people that go to the mexico games in the usa, 
  goltz is going to independiente , or so they say, 
  i hope you do n't mean guido pizarro, 
  i do sound salty , but i find the idea of `` you do n't know anything until you see x '' stupid , specially when it starts with millenials/gen x / gen y. 
  stop tryinng to show that you remember a great player and just enjoy football , for fuck sake, 
  and so are a lot of players, 
  ... i hope his price tag gives guillermo a heart attack, 
  well , sinergia is looking to buy some teams outside the league , so ... 
   but its really annoying the hype he gets from the youth . 
  and probably people before him where annoyed of the hype he was getting , probably talking about barbadillo , flores and hugo , and those before them said the same thing but with cuellar , munci\u00f1o , borja and bustos and so on and so forth . 
  nothing shows more ignorance than taling as you know better while beign ignorant of the past . 
   just lost 2 finals in one season when tigres was the clear favorite to put it in perspective . 
  while it hurts to lose two finals , it also means that we 're above 16 teams in the league and a bunch of others in the continent , so it 's not a failure . 
  [ those answers though ... ] ( https://twitter.com/neto_azul/status/879390660847177728 ), 
  none taken , but tijuana has a great scouting system as well as good negotiators , probably sold him on either the idea of cash or as a starting point for his career outside argentina . 
  quick question , does he understand the joke ? 
   immediately after cracking the joke he `` clarified '' the sentiment in a serious way . 
  that 's what 's got me so worried . 
  shit , this is bad . 
  ok , i am currently on the dark , so i am going to recap just to see if i get this right, 
  * your brother ( 6 y/o ) binges watches youtube . 
  recently he has been using swear words , possibly very elaborated as if they were constructed by a obnoxious youtuber . 
  * just recently he made an `` attack helicopter '' joke [ like this ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-sexually-identify-as-an-attack-helicopter ) and explained with `` there really are two genders though '' . 
  so , considering all this :, 
  * do you know what type of youtubers does he watch ? 
  and, 
  * is his interest on science concentrates on natural science , social science or `` there is mercury on the vaccines '' science ? 
   im sure if you found his youtube history im sure you 'd fine vids from sargon and the like . 
  do six year old watch that ? 
  i imagine something more like pewdiepie and the like . 
  shit . 
  normally i would recommend bringing him to do chrity work , but he is six , so i do n't know if they would accept his help . 
  however , if you decide to confront said views , just do n't get into shouts , that tends to develop any attempt to clarify any point into a verbal fight with no progress on the initial objective . 
   bild 's report includes details of a $ 2m ( # 1.6 m ) sum allegedly paid to the 10-year-old daughter of a fifa official . 
  well , that is just slimy as fuck . 
  at the time i thought that it was a good transfer for our bench , we had just loaned out * pollo * brise\u00f1o after all . 
  and while meza is better than him , considering that not only * pollo * is still on a loan and so are now * palmera * rivas , adv\u00edncula , zamora and chavez , i would still welcome him , so long as he does n't whine about being on the bench . 
  clausura and apertura are seasons with their own champions , clausura is normally played january - may and apertura is played july - december . 
  each season the top 8 teams play a direct knock out tournament ( liguilla ) to decide who is the champion of said season . 
  there is champion of champions game , but it 's like the community shield , no one cares . 
  as for relegation , there is something called the quotient table that averages the number of games played per the number of points obtained from the last six seasons . 
  this was implemented to prevent the already established teams to avoid relegation since the recently promoted team had only two seasons to average a better quotient than the other teams . 
  ( the liguilla was originally designed for this ), 
  as for why , apparently to make the league flashier . 
  yup , my mistake, 
  thanks, 
  does someone know how the guatemalan league works , i recently worked on [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6jqp4t/an_update_on_the_three_that_refused_to_follow_the/ ) and found out about izazola coming out of retirement to play for comunicaciones fc and , at that time , fighting to become the top goalscorer of the season with only four goals . 
  how does that work out ? 
  some may be , but i 've seen a lot of people with the roma shirt and none of the people i 've asked know about roma , they simply like the color of it . 
  he 's been posting in west ham sub , so i 'll suppose it 's west ham, 
  what 's your opinion on enner valencia, 
  i would be more worried about the relationship between the saudi billionaire and the uanl , since the pact between sinerg\u00eda ( who manages the team financially and administrative ) and uanl mention that the team must represent the university . 
  like `` ca n't score '' awful or `` ca n't even run '' awful ? 
  that sounds like a pettiness normally found inside mcmahon , what did john ruddy did to deserve said pettiness ? 
  nop , that 's the same season that [ this source talks about him fighting to be the top goalscorer . 
  ] ( https://www.futboltotal.com.mx/2017/03/mexicano-david-izazola-lucha-titulo-goleo-en-guatemala/ ), 
  no idea how that was considered top goalscorer material , but i suppose that the writer did n't know abot the league either . 
  like fifth on his peak years , there were always people better than him , both on la liga , on la roja and on the champions league . 
  and if you measure since 2000s , he probably is on the bottom of the top 20 . 
   if people visit rome that 's probably a fashionable item to purchase, 
  normally i see them in labourers , not people from condesa . 
  though i do see them beign sold on the street for 100 pesos near some metro stations , so maybe they just thought it was a nice shirt . 
  it depends from club to club , tigres and rayados obtain players either by transfer or from their academies , but [ lobos buap still has try outs ] ( https://twitter.com/lobosbuapmx/status/872981577940307968 ), 
  the ing . 
  rodr\u00edguez sold him a lifestyle instead of just throwing money on his way . 
  from what i remember , gignac only had offers with a good salary from bottom pl clubs , championship level clubs , russia and qatar . 
  our president instead brought him to monterrey and showed him the city , the good neighborhoods , the macro and some other places , as well as showing him the passion that exists in monterrey ( mostly to extinguish any doubt of playing in empty stadiums ) . 
  he sold him as a future idol of the city , not as another job with a good pay . 
  and he has fallen in love with the city , defending it when asked about the [ instability of the zone ] ( http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/deportes/futbol/2017/04/25/con-mexico-vivi-un-amor-primera-vista-gignac ) ( monterrey is a zone of conflict due to the cartels using it as a point of transportation ) as well as adapting to it . 
  he even goes to the [ sultanes games . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/sultanesoficial/status/852681480451084288 ), 
   it 's just pathetic to see a professional be that grossly out of shape and everyone just gives him a free pass because he still scores . 
  because that 's what matters , contrary to very on shape strikers that score jack shit .
