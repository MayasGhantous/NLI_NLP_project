  doubt it , osorio wants him as a pet project . 
  wow , that 's waaaay too similar, 
  shit, 
  fuck , we lose a bunch our bench , the best of the rumored transfers will sign for another team and everything points to enner valencia to tigres . 
  this is ** not ** going to be a good season . 
  and hopefully it stays like that !, 
  [ that phrase remind me of this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg390pp7bpi ), 
  because the full name is club tijuana xoloitzcuintles de caliente , and since xoloitzcuintles is also the pet , people decided to call them with the same abbreviation of the animal ( xolos ), 
  maybe , i am not sure how they exactly work , but it apparently worked for pumas since there is a clause like that in his contract , but covering all the teams from liga mx, 
  either stay or bvb , unless i 'm in the mood for madness then go to lille losc for bielsa . 
  this was harder than i thought, 
  maybe delrot ? 
  we paid like 8 million euros for him , 6 for edu , like 4 for gaitan , 3 and some change for * chilindrina * and nothing for gignac . 
  edson puch plays for pachuca , not necaxa, 
  nah , just shit . 
  tigres gave away * queso * fernandez , who responded with goals and heart every time he was on the field , for this . 
  he is , everytime that he is on the nt he shows his quality and heart , not so much on the club . 
  pati\u00f1o comes from guaran\u00ed , he was loaned at jaguares, 
  good, 
  no problem , jaguares clusterfuck of transfer and registration of players did n't come until they died . 
  almost all of their players are loans , some report that between jaguares and puebla ( chargoy 's other team ) , there were at most 17 players owned by the club . 
   inspired by the `` no-trade '' clause that most american sports use, 
  that no-trade clause seems redundant when a player can simply refuse a contract , unless the player is under a system that let owners abuse their power ( mexico 's pacto de caballeros and , from what you show , almost all of the `` american '' sports ), 
  as for the no-sack , i am not really sure it would help . 
  most of this recycling managers come from small teams whose main objectives are to survive , not create a system . 
  southampton , granada , jaguares , puebla , and many others main objective involves keeping the category , and a string of bad results is something that they can not afford . 
  just look at jaguares de chiapas , the moment they lost the category the team collapsed financially , they depended of the money obtained from sponsors , tv and the prizes from the fmf to survive as an organization . 
  and now , due to the loss of all of those revenue streams , they are now defunct and everyone on said organization jobless ( except the sleaziest of the bunch , it 's complicted ) . 
  a `` no-sack '' is the equivalent of a suicide pact to these teams . 
  from the wikipedia article, 
   in the nhl , these rights have been blamed for the lack of trades that have been pulled off in recent years , with critics citing examples where `` done deals '' were blown up by `` selfish players . '', 
  and here i thought that we 've been petty . 
  was there a case of no-sack clause in turkish football ? 
  weird , this was announced as done [ during the draft ] ( https://twitter.com/ligabancomermx/status/873009641306947584 ) , but not three weeks after that . 
  he 's now loaned to america de cali, 
  tuca 's system does n't allow 2 target men on the pitch , so i doubt that he will use them together . 
  i really miss sobis . 
  holy shit !, 
  that 's worse than us !, 
  [ totall legit photo of him ] ( http://www.fotolog.com/galo16/34162141/ ), 
  yeah , on liga mx sub , but i 'm still pissy and ranting, 
  yes , for i will break your heart, 
  we lost , gio made this a 10 vs 12 situation, 
  it 's [ x ] ( ) , no x [ ], 
   damm as speedy gonzalez, 
  he is part german , aquino is gonzalez , and gio is the new lento rodriguez, 
  he wants to * revitalize * him as a pet project to show his skills as a manager . 
  starts with a and m comes before the t, 
  televisa keeps giving blowjobs to osorio and gio, 
  bielsa is pressuring lille to buy him, 
  alanis looks like hummels, 
  the long con, 
  please score, 
  we 're fucked, 
  probably as a super sub , * micky * works great as that , his speed and shooting power is incredible . 
  the one thing any young prospect needs to know is to not accept any offer when tuca is on the bench , he will kill you career . 
  cerda , [ espiricueta ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/jorge-espericueta/profil/spieler/67158 ) , [ richard ruiz ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/richard-sanchez/profil/spieler/178861 ) , * pollo * brise\u00f1o was sent to a team that actively bench him on sub20 games , [ jose tostado ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/jose-tostado/profil/spieler/78110 ) , aaron fernandez , enrique palos , uvaldo luna , acu\u00f1a , pacheco , armando pulido , lampros kontogiannis , the list goes on and on . 
  and it also does n't matter if your a foreginer , look at * queso * fernandez , everton , alexander lar\u00edn , \u00c9der borelli , william palacio , carlos ibarg\u00fcen , and a lot of other colombian players . 
  he does n't want anyone with no experience , and does n't want to give experience to those that needs it . 
   german bodybuilder achim albrecht, 
  moslty known as brakus , was weird . 
  he looked apart from everyone , but any resemblance of suspension of disbelief dies when watching him wrestle . 
  he was trained by bruce and bret alongside the rock and mark henry, 
  [ this is the first promo announcing his * debut * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrmtxyizxog ), 
  transcript, 
   my name is brakkus and i come from germany . 
  i weigh 300 pounds . 
  and when i come to america , to the world wrestling federation , i will get vader in the ring and destroy him !, 
  he went to uswa , then to ecw, 
  [ cyberslam 98 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mexjix3jtsk ) cyrus said he was the most stiff guy he ever went to the ring . 
  he returned to wwe in march of 98 , got nicknamed the `` german superman '' , and on july of the same year [ lost to savio vega in the brawl for all . 
  ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xsq4go_brawl-for-it-all-fight-3_sport ) then they tried to rebuild him by beating [ jesus , savio vega 's teammate in los boricuas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm1ob9zw7iq ) that was his last match , which i had on a tape because it 's also the same episode where val venis banged yamanuchi 's wife . 
  retired on ' 99 . 
  from mexico it 's atlante ( now on 2 ^ ^ nd division ) , toros neza ( defunct ) , tecos uag ( recently brought back from the death , 3 ^ ^ rd division ) , atl\u00e9tico celaya ( 2 ^ ^ nd division ) and maybe necaxa , but they are doing fine for the moment . 
  lost sinha and da silva on the same season, 
  welcome to my world, 
   we have chorizo money . 
  chorizo money that bought a player from the bundesliga, 
  the thing is , to call a team an underdog because of the odds with the bookies is a disserving to both the term `` underdog '' and the teams , all of them arrived on their own merits . 
  even the uruguay of the maracanazo was considered at the moment as one of the best teams in the world . 
  as for who counts as an underdog ... i 'm not sure if the german team of '74 could be considered as `` underdog '' , they where one of the most complete teams of the tournament . 
  the same thing could be said about the '98 final , where the favourite was fenomeno 's brazil . 
  maybe argentina of '78 could be one , if only for how they passed to the knock out phase . 
  outside of those , the only two underdog stories on the wc are uruguay in 1950 ( maracanazo ) and germany in 1954 ( das wunder von bern ) . 
  and specially 1950 , brazil only needed a draw to win the tournament , and they were so confident that juvenal played hangover , since we got drunk at the cabarets of rio the day before the finals . 
  he and osvaldo mart\u00ednez were used as currency to buy marches\u00edn during last draft . 
  no idea, 
  how come throwback tuesday is still pinned ? 
  thanks for the hard work, 
   ( scared of getting beaten up ), 
  my uncle was a referee on the amateur level , definetly got threatened every game for stupid stuff . 
  the worst part is that , at the end of the game , he went to get on the proposed fights . 
  it was a miracle he lived to his 50s, 
  [ this is deportivo maldonado ] ( http://www.elespanol.com/deportes/futbol/20160829/151485698_0.html ), 
  marcelo estigarriba , currently of jaguares , is from maldonado, 
  not exactly , at the moment the game ended he did n't even shake the hands of the capitans . 
  he just went straight to the nearsest offender and got into fights . 
  by the time i first saw him ( he was long retired since ) he had lost half of his teeth on fights . 
  most of the players on both chiapas and puebla come from loans , reports tend to vary between 9 to 17 players that are owned by chargoy on both teams . 
  therefore , most of the mexican players , excepting those mentioned here , already have a team either as a loan , or returned to their parent teams .
