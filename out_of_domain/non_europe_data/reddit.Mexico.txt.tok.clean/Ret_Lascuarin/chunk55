  mexico won the 2015 concacaf cup against usa 3-2 on extra time . 
  mexico qualified by winning the gold cup 2015 , while the usa won the gold cup 2013 . 
  australia won the 2015 afc asian cup against south korea 2 - 1 on extra time . 
  new zeland won the 2016 ofc nations cup against papau new guinea 4-2 on penalites after the game ended 0-0 . 
  cameroon won the 2017 africa cup of nations against egypt 1-2 on regular time . 
  doubt it , they currently manage the team as a long term project . 
  unless red bull collapses or anything like that , the team will continue to fight in the bundesliga . 
  you 're right , i completly forgot about the panama - mexico game, 
  tigres, 
  i personally blame tuca for killing two player 's careers by himself and some more by beign a dick . 
  he never debuted richard ruiz and has yet to bring tostado to the first team . 
  he refuses to give time to anynone under 25 , specially if said player is mexican . 
  true , and while tostado and ruiz could have chosen something better , espiricueta , palos , aaron , pacheco , acu\u00f1a , luna and some more , all of them looked for other teams and were n't sold because tuca block any attempt to be bought . 
   they are ok with spending their careers on the bench . 
  not really , hence why tigres loans like chelsea . 
  considering that he was sent to the sub20 squad in veracruz , this move seems an improvement, 
  no idea , but the moment that reinosos left veracruz , the moment he was releagated to not even appear in the bench . 
  few players may make it , but most of them are not even on the benches of liga mx teams . 
   ey , they could go with what pulido did , but they did n't , pulido took his chance , he at least tried to make it in europe, 
  * sigh * again with the pulido example , he is not what you think he is . 
  pulido was already sought by olympiakos before the whole drama , and at the time they could n't reach an agreement on the price . 
  they found a way to get him for free , [ and tigres won at the end . 
  ] ( http://laaficion.milenio.com/tigres/cronologia_caso_pulido-tas_falla_favor_tigres_caso_pulido-alan_pulido_resolucion_0_587341454.html ), 
  and before you go on `` pulido fought the system '' , please , do you seriously think that any other federation in europe would let a team cause such a commotion ? 
  it 's greece , the one that owns olympiakos owns the league , they been found on match fixing multiple times ( [ 2011 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koriopolis ) and [ 2015 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_greek_football_scandal ) ) [ and their current president is [ banned from football , ] ( http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/9888897/olymiakos-owner-vangelis-marinakis-banned-from-football-over-corruption-allegations ) said banning will last until the trial ends . 
  and even then he 's still involved in football , buying [ nottingham forest ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/18/nottingham-forest-evangelos-marinakis-takeover ) while the trial is still in process . 
  and it 's not like fifa does n't know , they named a man closed to him as [ director of member associations services . 
  ] ( https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/2176762/fifa-president-gianni-infantino-faces-serious-questions-over-handling-of-greeces-football-chaos/ ), 
  it was never a david versus goliath story , it was always a cartel against a team looking to get a promising player for free ,, 
  i do n't want to lose guido :(, 
  is there anyone else available for the gold cup other than him ? 
  exiting free, 
  this literally came out from nowhere, 
  he is good , a bit inconsistent but nothing mayor . 
  played well in libertadores , only lost two games with him on the field, 
  his quality when heading corners , whether to or away of the goal , during his time on the sub-17 and sub-20 created the expectations of him being the mexican ramos . 
  he scored twice against el salvador in the semifinals of concacaf sub20 2013 , when he was still in atlas . 
   osorio probably still has some deals with mls considering how much he hypes it . 
  i still do n't get why inge brings youngsters when tuca does everything to not give them playing time, 
  hope not, 
  bench : * matador * , nahuel guzman , * hachita * ludue\u00f1a , david luiz ( that hair ) , rafael marquez , diarra , * bofo * , riquelme , palermo , aquino, 
  for some reason i thought there would be franco and chupete on your team, 
  unless it 's [ this one ] ( https://twitter.com/cdfeirense1918?lang=es ) , then no, 
   shame ~ ~ he ~ ~ all youth prospects practically lost all hope of improving when he signed for tigres . 
  at least he is n't injured like mora, 
  he is from spain . 
  [ 911 has arrived ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xm6vxuzkfw ), 
  [ tigres 7 ^ ^ th , america 35 ^ ^ th , chivas 60 ^ ^ th , cruz azul 177 ^ ^ th ] ( http://soccerverse.com/ranking_table ), 
  all of you who shit on us for not being a `` big team '' can suck our succesfull dick . 
  also [ jaguares de chiapas ] ( http://soccerverse.com/teams_and_trainers?team_id=club-jaguares-de-chiapas-mexico ) does not longer exist . 
  since i 'm currently also writting about the response of the embassy of argentina in mexico about the comment of `` mexico ( football ) is shit '' , it took me a momento to get the comment . 
  and no offense , nothing is worst than the festival of friendship . 
  we have n't signed anyone and send half of the bench to other teams :(, 
  [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/jessmartinez272/status/881802760030703616 ), 
   that means it 's working . 
  i hope it is, 
  holy shit !, 
  * pancho villa 's army is a fan 's club , not even an aggregator of rumors, 
  * and you 're wording it like it 's a done deal , but a lot of things can happen from today up to the ending of the transfer window . 
  nop, 
  oh yeah , was n't guardado who sold lozano on psv instead of celta de vigo ? 
  does someone has any official confirmation on the transfer of pedro aquino ? 
  he played last season in sporting cristal of peru [ ( which is being bought by tigres uanl ) ] ( https://mexico.as.com/mexico/2017/06/18/futbol/1497749120_860135.html ) and it was rumored about him being bought by rayados and loaned inmediatly to lobos buap . 
  however , no official confirmation has been shown over this deal , even if pedro aquino is currently training with lobos ( they 're currently in preseason ) . 
  [ ochoa 's contract ended 4 days ago , 9 out of 10 that means he is moving to another team ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/guillermo-ochoa/transfers/spieler/29559/transfer_id/1817929 ), 
  it 's not that they do n't want talent , it 's just that they do n't care , same with the river plate acadmies here at mexico . 
  * the first witcher, 
  * halycon 6, 
  * system shock, 
  * factorio ( not in sale , never will be on one ), 
  really did n't have any resources to buy like a did before , and most of the budget went to factorio . 
  decided to not buy shadow of mordor when a quick check up of my resources demonstrated that there was no way i could play it . 
  as for the games , have n't got any time for most of them ( like always ), 
   evil genius, 
  this game is great , still own the cd . 
  they 're also working on a sequel . 
  cemex, 
  we 're either losing aquino or edu , because i doubt he signed to be bench, 
  half hope it happens ( i like bielsa and aquino ) and half hope it does n't happen ( we need aquino ), 
  no idea, 
  3 things :, 
  * most south american players move to other teams ( specially to north america and europe ) not to be more competitive , but to obtain a better quality of life . 
  mexicans can live a good quality with their salaries , which are way bigger and with more spending power than their south american counterparts ' salaries . 
  * most players also look for teams without the same problems that they have in their teams ( extortion , harassing them on their own locker rooms ) , unless said team is nothing more than a jumping pad . 
  no one has this problem in mexico . 
  * the number of `` 3000 players overseas '' may also refer to players going to other south american teams , central american teams , north american teams , japanese teams , chinese teams , south asian teams , arab teams , african teams , eastern european teams and some arrive to western europe . 
  most of these leagues are behind liga mx in terms of competitiveness . 
  this is not to say that mexican players only go to europe , some of them go to central american teams or mls in case the * pacto de caballeros * is blocking them . 
  therefore your argument misrepresents both the issue at hand and the issues that south american players confront in their domestic league . 
  tl ; dr : op has no idea of what he is talking about . 
   are you saying 3,000 mexican players make a decent living in mexico ? 
  that 's a though question , mostly due to the lack of transparency in the fmf . 
  however , with the exception of chargoy 's teams , there 's been no accusations of the salaries being `` low '' in comparision to their south american counter parts . 
  while it 's true that the average river plate player wins more than the average player of atlas , said player also tend to win more than the average player of aldosivi or sarmiento . 
  that does n't mean the salary is enough to have a good standard of life , it just means it 's more . 
   the mexican , brazil , and argentina economies are pretty similar in world standards, 
  true , and in some instances where they surpass us . 
  however , that 's not the only factor , there are also argentinian and brazilian players that play in bolivia , peru , venezuela , montenegro and romania and none of those places are above economically any of the three mentioned . 
   the big difference here is that mexico does n't have an industry dedicated to it, 
  true , but that is due to how the money works in the leagues .
