  mexican teams rely on the revenue stream from the tv broadcast , both domestic and international . 
  brazilian and argentinian teams tend to have a lot of problems with said revenue stream . 
  hence why they compensate on player sales to stay active . 
  an example on the mexican league is jaguares , who depended on players sales ( danilinho , caba\u00f1as , romero ) to stay afloat . 
   argentina and brazil have worked their diplomatic ties with european countries ( mostly italy , spain and portugal ) to allow for faster and easier transfers . 
  not exactly , this has more to do with their circumstances . 
  argentina is mostly a nation of foreginers , most of them europeans , hence why many have double nationality or atleast an european passport . 
  with said passport they tend to work all over europe without needing a visa ( so does uruguay ) . 
  mexico does have something like that with spain called [ ley de memoria hist\u00f3rica ] ( http://leymemoria.mjusticia.gob.es/cs/satellite/leymemoria/es/concesion-nacionalidad/descendientes-espanoles ) , but that only applies to those that arrived escaping from franco . 
  brazilian players do need visas ** to work ** abroad . 
   im sure many would try if there was an exporting network to make it easier to go play in other leagues . 
  or they could struggle and remain with their families , which is what tends to happen . 
   sounds like you are sitting on the throne of truth there . 
  while reviewing this comment , and the one you responded , i do have to admit that it does sound a bit like an ass . 
  he is from uruguay, 
   just for players exported to european and arab leagues, 
  thanks for the specification on the number, 
   if you want i can give you the link to the source itself , again this was reported 7 years ago . 
  please, 
  and you 're just throwing shit to look cool , you are as near to finding the truth as el salvador to winning the wc . 
  you whine about anything that does n't sound `` truthful '' to you without actually researching anything . 
  if i 'm arrogant , you 're an ignorant asshole who needs to shut up on matters that has no knowledge , specially when you do nothing to look for said knowledge . 
  thank you very much, 
  i hope they tell them no, 
  [ original post by / u/itsjavigold ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6lnr6n/mexico_canada_and_the_us_make_a_united_committee/ ), 
  something like this would be great to clear a lot of the shit that happens on liga mx, 
  this is the official confirmation of the bid . 
   * ^ that being said , tv azteca is looking to buy puebla currently , which would mean they 'd own ( not 2 ) , 3 teams in the first div . 
  they 're apparently looking to buy puebla to save atlas in case they 're relegated . 
   shit south americans like juninho, 
  juninho is n't shit . 
  not getting called to the nt is not equivalent with him being shit , it simply shows that there are better players than him ( like cafu , lucio , juan , luis\u00e3o , cris , thiago silva , david luiz ), 
   also , which puebla team ? 
  and if they buy camoteros , would lobos change their name ? 
  club puebla , the last team owned by chargoy . 
  lobos is property of the buap ( benem\u00e9rita universidad aut\u00f3noma de puebla ) , and they 'll probably wo n't change the name since the wolf is the mascot of the university . 
  atl\u00e9tico de madrid can not register players right now , he would have remained on hold until the next transfer window . 
   according to the document presented yesterday at 17:00 to the conmebol , the seizure is for g. ( guaran\u00edes , national currency of paraguay ) 53.335.574.100 , which was established by the court for the collection of unpaid pay for diverse concepts that demands the plaintiff , ismael antonio pintos ram\u00edrez , an uruguayan sports journalist , plus the sum of g. 5.335.574.100 provisionally fixed by the court as `` expenses of the justice '' . 
  guardado was already in europe . 
  as for who i hope goes to europe : orbelin pineda and javier aquino, 
  juninho is 34 , if there was anytime he could 've entered in the team it would 've been between 2005 , when he was sold ot botafogo , to 2012 , when he reached 30 years . 
  all those defenders i mentioned before where in the national team instead of juninho , all of them were better than him . 
  that does n't mean he is shit , he just was between two great generations of brazilian defenders and right now it 's time for the young ones to have an opportunity to play for the nt . 
  conmebol is not a goverment organization , and so are n't most of the confederations . 
  i used to sell ram memory and hd to both pc and laptops , buy either lenovo or toshiba , does tend to have less issues both from factory and from time . 
  some , but only in case of a swarm of injuries came through the usual candidates for a call up , nothing like that happened and right now there are many from previous sub-23 , sub-21 and sub-17 brazilian national teams getting their call ups . 
  and so is juninho , if you do n't like him , then it 's fine , but stop misrepresenting his talent as a footballer . 
  they were atleast competing for a place in the europa league , compared to fighting for relegation like granada and ajaccio . 
  `` and so is juninho '' mentions your `` but they are still quality '' , there were always better prospects than him at coritiba, 
  because he is good , just never good enough to take cafu , thiago silva , david luiz , and many others from the national team . 
  not being there is not a mark of a bad player , it can also mean , like in juninho 's case . 
  that there were better players in his position during his peak years . 
  and sometimes players with national caps does not translate in good quality on the field with the club , see edu vargas , luis garc\u00eda fern\u00e1ndez and marco ruben with tigres , enrique vera and richard n\u00fa\u00f1ez with america , luciano figueroa with cruz azul and many others . 
   but getting shitty players like juninho to succeed in the league will scare away good players because then they wo n't see the league as competitive or high quality, 
  get through your thick skull , he was never shit , he was simply not a big prospect in the sub 17 and sub 20 of his club ( he got a better career in hindsight that some of those players ) and peaked during a time where central defenders of world class quality where abundant in brazil . 
  he was never needed at that level . 
  also this :, 
   in liga mx we should be getting more players like that because once they see the league is n't easy more players will want to come challenge themselves . 
  but getting shitty players like juninho to succeed in the league will scare away good players because then they wo n't see the league as competitive or high quality, 
  is a fallacy , jose sand played in the nt and you do n't see people searching a place in uae , do you ? 
  you can still get it on pc, 
  [ sevilla 's tweet about it ] ( https://twitter.com/sevillafc/status/883711290270777344 ), 
  i want to cry :(, 
  [ me right now ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/012/073/7686178464_fdc8ea66c7.jpg ), 
  in what language ? 
  ok , may i read it ? 
  goltz tend to get into fights with everyone as well as taking a few cards for stupid fouls, 
  el aztecazo , when tigres lost 1-3 at home to the america of cuau , piojo and kleber and later won 4-1 at the azteca . 
  no , he has n't even consolidated in benfica . 
  it 's not talent , it 's simply not a place where he could start . 
  everton tends to play with a 4-3-3 , using only one center forward . 
  and right now they are near finishing a deal with rooney and a obtained an in-form sandro . 
  jimenez would either be bench as a winger or below bench . 
  hence why i doubt that the rumor is true , otherwise it could spell a clusterfuck to him and sandro , because rooney is clearly going to play in the starting xi , if only due to nostalgia factor . 
  [ yup ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/sandro-ramirez/transfers/spieler/199369/transfer_id/1820421 ), 
  part of it goes to the agent and the player , kikin apparently got $ 15 mdd from the $ 45 mdd tigres paid for him, 
  benfica paid 22m euros for him , they probably offered to epl clubs around 30, 
  the man is quality , just never with a club ( with exception of u de chile ), 
  look , check the stats, 
  [ edu vargas ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/eduardo_vargas#estad.c3.adsticas ), 
  there is only one year where edu outscored silvio ( 13 season goals against 10 season goals ) , but every other year he outscores edu . 
  edu never shines outside of the national league , regardless the level he compites in . 
  hell , silvio scored more than edu this season alone ( 1 goal over nil ) , and the entire 2016-2017 cycle went 13 for silvio against 2 for vargas . 
  of course , players get at least % 15 , sometimes more , sometimes they only get the initial fee , but nothing from the bonuses , [ and sometimes stole by the clubs ] ( http://www.informador.com.mx/deportes/2015/634323/6/pacto-de-caballeros-un-cancer.htm ), 
  true , but that means we bought a player who was almost inactive a club level , and even whe we was active he almost always underperformed, 
  if they play today ? 
  * flamengo , they are 3rd in the brasilerao and finished in the round of 16 in the sudamericana , and real sociedad lost 10 players in this transfer window . 
  * boca , ac milan is still under renovations while boca is currently solid as a team . 
  * borussia , they are better man to man and atl\u00e9tico nacional just lost their manager . 
  * pe\u00f1arol , sunderland is currently going through renovations . 
  there is no way to know if something is reliable , take it from me that already worked on two transfer threads in liga mx subreddit . 
  what we heard or read in the news are mostly calls from clubs to other clubs about either the contract status or the amount of the rescission clause . 
  and even if both clubs reach an agreement , sometimes the player decides that he does n't like it . 
  even in mexico with the * pacto de caballeros * ca n't do anything when a player actively blocks a move during the draft ( after that , tough luck ) . 
  and even then negotiations may collapse if there is a clause that both the player and the club ca n't agree on , or the player falls a medical , or many other reasons . 
  and after all that , journalist mostly have ecoes of conversations , tidbits given by people close to the parties . 
  that does n't mean that all of them are reliable , the sun in england , oporto in portugal , esto in mexico , they tend to write a ton of bullshit that does n't really need any expertise to identify it , but even examples that work on all levels are hard to come by . 
  it really goes down to who you can trust at club level , and / r/soccer is too big to create such catalog of reliability of sources . 
  [ according to proceso , tigres paid 4d million dollars ] ( http://www.proceso.com.mx/204823/el-del-kikin-fonseca-el-fichaje-mas-caro-en-la-historia-de-los-tigres ),
