   [ edu vargas will have 4 + combined goals and assists at the end of week 5 .

  considering our past performance , we 'll probably seed 7-8 , using juninho as a pivote and a line of * chaka * - ayala - meza - torres nilo, 
   would tigres be the most expensive tix to purchase from liga mx ? 
  if there are any left , the stadium is normally 90 % sold by the time the season starts, 
  mexicans teams do this a lot , venados de merida with pumas , cimarrones ( now zacatepec ) with chivas , previously bravos and fc juarez with tigres . 
  he was playing in mexico 's second division , it 's impressive he even got a job in la liga, 
   that 's not much of a reflection of his actual talent . 
  maybe not , but how do you sell him to a second division club ? 
  to those that did n't see him in his `` prime '' , he is just another failed prospect that injures a lot , plays in the second division where he is n't even a starter and his last goal was at the 27 ^ ^ th of november of ** 2015 ** . 
  it 's a miracle that his agent got him a job at all . 
   his international caps are proof that he has the potential to be a monster anywhere . 
  ** were ** is the correct conjugation of the verb , he was last caped at a friendly against usa in ** 2011 ** and his only goal with the nt was also in a friendly in ** 2009 ** . 
  he is an injury prone , 30 years old ** striker ** whose last goal was ** 1 year and 8 months ago ** , his last international cap was ** 5 years and 11 months ago ** and his only goal with the national team was ** 8 years and a few days ago ** . 
  yeah , he is no longer any form of monster and has no potential left . 
  you are clearly a troll , there is no potential left on a 30 year old . 
  30 is old in football , specially for strikers and midfielders , since their physical abilities start to decline . 
  how much did they run ? 
  almost nothing , but their skills surpass those of most players and adapt their playing styles to those limitations . 
  but those are totti and pirlo , most players retire way before them . 
  aldo had way more skills than arellano and he retired at 33 , other retired at 30s are david suazo ( 33 ) , joseba llorente ( 33 ) , hitzlsperger ( 31 ) , owen hargreaves ( 31 ) , kieron dyer ( 35 ) . 
  and omar is injury free / s, 
   let 's say you have a guy getting injured all the time but the only 3 games he played he was good . 
  there 's potential for something better out of him, 
  there is also the option of hiring a not so injured player , one that may also have some potential , unlike arellano . 
   then you 'd have to kick yourself for hiring a bum over that guy, 
  a bum with more years in his pocket that a player with just a lucky break . 
  no matter how much you troll me into a rabbit hole , no logic backs omar being right now good for second division . 
  he barely is enough for second division in mexico . 
   did you start watching in 2015 or something ? 
  and have you stoped watching since 2010 ? 
  arellano is right now nowhere near the level he showed at chivas . 
  his speed remains , but that accuracy that appeared every once in a while is gone . 
  stop living in the past and watch him now , the * pina * that gave brazilians a class in * jogo bonito * does not longer exist . 
   that accuracy can look better with inferior competition which la liga 2nd division offers . 
  same inferior competition can be found in mexico 's second division , where he only played was given plenty of chance in leones negros , where he played before , and he still did n't shine . 
   he was ok/decent for 7 games, 
  he was just `` ok '' or `` decent '' , not the second coming of messi that you still think he is . 
   his career is resurgent kinda if you think about it, 
  you 're either a troll or an ignorant , not even the best prospects resurgent at 30 , and arellano was never as a big of a prospect as baljic at real madrid , kleberson at atl\u00e9tico paranaense or philippe christanval at france , who ended retiring at 29 . 
  and you 're clearly too over-optimistic over a player that is on the last years of his career . 
  like always, 
   and which i assume are nonexistent in mexico, 
  there is a small japanese-mexican comunity of around 20k , mostly on mexico city , the north weastern coast and chiapas . 
  there 's also been japanese concentration camps here at mexico during wwii as well as massacres of asians in the 1920s, 
  this transfer came completly out of nowhere , his name never appeared on any rumor aggregator or newspaper . 
   tigres ' sub-20 team, 
  may god have mercy on his soul . 
  lend it unless they 're the worthless , and never expect it back, 
  he arrives as a loan from toluca , played last season with cerro porte\u00f1o of paraguay . 
  he arrives as a loan from toluca , played last season with cerro porte\u00f1o of paraguay . 
  he probably would , but that 's not the point . 
  however , the biggest question is what is more important , the result or the game ? 
  due\u00f1as , so does talavera and many other mouths shouts that the result does n't matter , what matters is who wins . 
  other pronounce that there is no point of seeking a result if the ways are boring . 
   we did n't do either yesterday . 
  they did n't even try anything yesterday . 
  yup, 
  [ ethnic cleansing by the revolutionary forces of madero , also by de la huerta , victoriano huerta and alvaro obreg\u00f3n . 
  ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/campa%c3%b1a_antichina ), 
  edu is leaving and sosa is playing as a winger , not as a center forward . 
  apparently piojo wants silvio to stay , so i doubt that would happen . 
  it 's tigres and cruz azul , doubt any of them actaully finish it, 
  that does happen in mexico, 
  san lorenzo , tigres is looking to recoup most of his salary and san lorenzo is looking to pay less than half of it . 
  hobbit plays now for cafetaleros de tapachula . 
  his stints at deportivo de cali and chiapas have soured a lot of teams on him as an viable option . 
  while i do agree with you , this would be the equivalent of barcelona fucking puyol on his contract . 
  crivelli has a number of records with the institution since he was promoted to the first team and has accepted a number of pay cuts and surrender his part from the loans fees to three teams . 
  still , he should have brought a lawyer to any contract negotiations he had with anyone . 
   key departures : n/a, 
  they 've lost luis ernesto p\u00e9rez ( necaxa recalled him ) and alfonso emilio sanchez , both of them where on the starting xi on the two finals against dorados . 
  they 've also lost omar marrufo , guillermo iriarte , diego campos and ricardo alves , all of them where part of their depth . 
  yup, 
  ~ ~ no ~ ~ wait , if you mean `` where can i watch games ? 
  '' , [ check the schedule ] ( http://www.ascensomx.net/cancha/calendarios#calendarios ), 
  otherwise , nop . 
  even the fmf use streamable for some of their coverage . 
  at least he is no longer in check-bouncing chiapas . 
  let 's see :, 
  * cruz azul has enzo rocco , franco silva , felipe mora and mart\u00edn rodr\u00edguez . 
  * le\u00f3n has \u00c1lvaro ramos and juan cornejo . 
  * morelia has sebasti\u00e1n vegas , diego vald\u00e9s and rodrigo millar . 
  * necaxa has igor lichnovsky , v\u00edctor d\u00e1vila , manuel iturra and luis gallegos , they previously also had marcos gonz\u00e1lez and nicol\u00e1s maturana . 
  * pachuca has the former necaxa player edson puch and \u00c1ngelo sagal . 
  sergio vergara is still on their books , but he was sent to murcielagos . 
  * tigres has edu vargas . 
  * pumas has bryan rabello ( loaned by santos ) and nico castillo . 
  * veracruz has felipe flores . 
  all in all , there are 20 chilean players in liga mx . 
  hector mancilla is already retired . 
  apparently , this happen since the child was 9 for two years . 
  [ he was bought by pachuca but loaned to talleres de c\u00f3rdoba for a semester ] ( http://www.clubtalleres.com.ar/sebastian-palacios-continua-en-talleres-hasta-diciembre/ ), 
  thanks man, 
   key departures : francisco rodr\u00edguez ( lobos buap ), 
  maza did n't play last season , only playing two games in january against alebrijes and gallos blancos in the cup . 
  and the season befores that was n't any good , he only registered five games , three league games and two cup games . 
  ( he also played 3 games with the sub-20 ) . 
  i would n't call him a key element of cruz azul . 
   see if we have a bunch of 26 year olds playing kids , we 'll never lose !,
