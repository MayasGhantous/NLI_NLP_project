  [ recently garagano accused * turco * mohamed , the manager of rayados , of trying to take a cut of his salary ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6ladsm/on_garganos_accusations/ ) , he later retracted and seemed to find a way to part ways with rayados . 
  pe\u00f1arol apparently is looking to sign him , but could n't when he was playing with rayados because of the price tag they added . 
  cristaldo is not being accepted back by cruz azul , so he is still there on a limbo .

  # ** agustin lara for life **, 
  [ the var will be used only in liguilla ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6onolq/free_talk_friday/ ) , i want them to use it in all the games . 
  also , as much as people are shitting on it , it 's a step on the right direction . 
  let me check :, 
  * monarcas starting xi, 
  *  foreginers : sosa ( uru ) , achiller ( ecu ) , vega ( chile ) , valdes ( chile ) , lezcano ( arg ) , polo ( peru ) , cuero ( col ), 
  *  mexicans : perez , loebschor ( mex-arg ) , rocha , sansores, 
  4 mexicans , 7 foreginers, 
  * rayados starting xi, 
  *  foreginers : s\u00e1nchez ( arg-sp ) , medina ( col ) , ortiz ( par ) , sanchez ( uru-arg ) , pab\u00f3n ( col ) , funes mori ( arg ), 
  *  mexicans : gonz\u00e1lez ( both ) , fuetes , basanta ( mex-arg ) , hurtado ( mex-col ), 
  5 mexicans , 6 foreginers . 
  that makes 9 mexicans and 13 foreginers on the field .

  [ here is a list of some of his work ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf3e_vb_cok&amp;index=20&amp;list=plnb8askvc3bqjysiopeordmkgv8kayqjg ), 
  [ there wont be any time of transmission until week 5 ] ( http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/2017/07/21/lobos-buap-no-transmitira-por-tv-su-debut-en-liga-mx ), 
  while true , the fmf and the mexican law considers them mexicans . 
  nop , there wont be even radio transmission of the game . 
   nor do they have mexican blood in them . 
  you 're right , i should ask for their pedigree to measure blood purity when i met someone with a weird last name or voice . 
  the zacatepec of this season , which substituted the now defunct zacatepec siglo xxi , is an affiliate of chivas originally named coras de tepic . 
  they do n't have the right to be promoted , on the same way that real madrid castilla and barcelona b can not be promoted to la liga first division . 
  they 're looking to sign with espn , who offered them more money than televisa . 
  segunda divisi\u00f3n ( third division ) , where both fo them spend most of their time , is now called liga premier . 
  goodbye to any doubt, 
  tigres is playing with a 3-2-3-2, 
  it 's so weird seeing this scheme from tuca, 
  it was but of the debut of enner valencia and the start of a new era of tuca , he normally goes for 4 or 5 defenders , and right now we played with 3, 
  not even on the bench, 
  nop , it was a 3 full backs , 2 defensive midfielders , 3 volantes and 2 strikers . 
  it 's like bielsa came down and told everyone how to play . 
  he 's the anti-vargas . 
  they wont , tdn is looking to get the least they can for lobos tv rights and lobos is looking to get the most they can . 
  that furch goal , he fought for it with everything he had . 
  also , i am not sure if we 'll miss the qui\u00f1ones . 
  i liked them last season , but that 5-0 made me rethink my position of tigres transfer window . 
  except throwing * palmera * to veracruz , he deserved better . 
  probably , the fight is currently for the biggest part of the market , which is the national audience . 
  televisa 's response to netflix , a streaming service engineered to televisa 's core audience . 
  they mostly have telenovelas , some series from spain , and * el chavo del ocho * [ ( a selling point of the service ) ] ( http://eltxoromatutino.com/televisa-crea-blim-para-competir-con-netflix-el-chavo-del-8-vs-house-of-cards/ ), 
  also , i kind of forgot , if lobos signs for tdn their games would be broadcasted in the usa by univisi\u00f3n , not espn . 
  if the rumors are true about uribe , medel and carioca , and considering wht they showed against puebla , i 'm pretty sure we 'll win the league .

  the current status of liga mx transfer window :, 
  * ** am\u00e9rica ** is closing their ranks , but piojo mentioned that there will be one more transfer coming from south america . 
  * ** atlas ** has closed their books . 
  * [ here is a post about the status of what remains of ** chiapas ** ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6nrqix/quick_followup_on_jaguares_players/ ), 
  * ** cruz azul ** has apparently closed their ranks , most of the rumors are old or just unnecessary . 
  edgar mendez had a great debut , while angel mena got injured during the first week . 
  * ** chivas ** had to close ranks , their policy does n't allow foreginer players and no one wanted to sell them players during the draft . 
  * not even the sound of crickets appear from ** le\u00f3n ** , and even then they will probably close the book in case that this season becomes torrente 's last season with * la fiera * . 
  * ** rayados ** is somewhat complete , they manage to offload a bunch of problematic players ( cardona , gargano ) and reforced some of their more vulnerable spots ( vangioni in defense , benitez and hurtado in attack ) . 
  they still can find where to place * dida * dom\u00ednguez and jonathan cristaldo , who is not being accepted back by cruz azul . 
  pab\u00f3n is the only one that clubs are looking to sign him , and they apparently have a transfer lined up in case he leaves . 
  * ** monarcas ** have closed their books , but rumors still appear about them looking for one more transfer in argentina and chile . 
  * ** necaxa ** is still on the market , they 're looking for some players of colo-colo and nandez from pe\u00f1arol . 
  * ** pachuca ** has only two targets ( gago and jackson ) and none of them is being looked for actively . 
  some of their transfer did n't shine nor manage to replace chucky role , and [ honda wo n't appear until 4 weeks due to injuries . 
  * ** puebla ** is currently under restructuring and they 're also asking for even more advancement payments from their tv deals . 
  campestrini , canelo and arizala are looking to exit the team . 
  * ** pumas ** is looking for one more striker in south america after britos left to saudi arabia much to the displeasure palencia , who merciless cut a bunch of icons to make place to academy players and is looking to add more places to them . 
  * ** quer\u00e9taro ** is looking for one more transfer in argentina , and they are also loosing renter\u00eda to atl\u00e9tico nacional . 
  * ** santos ** has close their ranks . 
  * believe it or not , tuca is looking for more reinforcements for ** tigres ** . 
  rumors point to 4 players : rafael carioca ( atl . 
  mineiro , ** brazil ** ) , * maxi * rodr\u00edguez ( free ) , mateus uribe ( atl\u00e9tico nacional , ** colombia ** ) and gary medel ( inter , ** italy ** ) . 
  only two of those are showing progress to join us . 
  aquino and damm are the only names that are sounding in europe . 
  * ** xolos ** have apparently closed their books , they already lost two of their main targets ( walter bou and teofilo gutierres ) . 
  * ** toluca ** is looking for a striker in south america , but their budget is short due to the * centenario * . 
  * ** veracruz ** has apparently closed their books after stealing two of torrente 's main targets for the transfer window ( * sema * vel\u00e1zquez and cristian menendez ) . 
  * ** lobos ** is under a very limited budget due to some [ issues with their tv deal ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6p2yjf/on_lobos_buap_lack_of_broadcast/ ) . 
  one of their players just retire before the season ( * cherokee * perez ) and two of their transfers were dropped to that same reason ( leandro somoza y leandro graci\u00e1n ) . 
  paraguay 's transfer window has closed , so am\u00e9rica lost one of their main target leagues . 
  gignac , or at least the one that plays here in tigres , can play both as a target man or as chance creator . 
   i will eat an entire raw onion and post a video of me doing it . 
  is that even a punishment ? 
  no , get your own french striker . 
  it was more of a 3-5-2, 
  it does n't , and apparently the game was [ broadcasted in the us by espn , just not live . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6p2yjf/on_lobos_buap_lack_of_broadcast/dkm6e30/ ), 
  if they sign with tdn , then all international broadcast would fall under univisi\u00f3n and telvisa , with lobos having absolutely no ability or right to negotiate . 
  rvd appears to give everyone a van daminator . 
  * palmera * , goddamit , you 're better than this !,
