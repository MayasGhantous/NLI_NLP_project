   why not have it in costa rica or jamaica , i 'm sure they would love to have home field advantage . 
  it 's just not possible . 
  consider that all but three stadiums ( frisco with 16k , houston with 22k and harrison with 25k ) had capacities over 60k , and in most cases they where 70 % full . 
  if we went the average capacity of the stadiums and only accounted for 70 % of it being bought , we 'll have at least 43k as an average of attendance per game . 
  but let 's downgrade that to 25k , because it 's too big for anyone other than the usual 3 ( canada , usa and mexico ), 
  * honduras only have three stadiums that are either at that level ( nilmo edwards with 25k ) and or above ( ol\u00edmpico has 45k and tiburcio has 36k ), 
  * panama only has one stadium ( rommel with 32k ) , the rest is below 6k , a few of them not even reaching 1k, 
  * el salvador only has two ( jorge * magico * gonzalez with 35k and cuscatlan with 53k , the rest is below frisco . 
  * panama only has estadio nacional ( 35k ) , everywhere else is below the 25k mark , with only one being close . 
  * jamaica has the independence park ( 35k ), 
  * the rest of the nations do n't have stadiums with such capacities . 
  again , like someone else said in the post , what matters is how much money they can obtain from it ? 
  the bigger the stadium , the bigger the matchday revenue is , the bigger the advertisement contracts are , the bigger the tv deals are , etc. 
  and if that was n't enough , there is also the lack of infrastructure that can affect everything . 
  how many airports in central america and the caribbean can afford the influx of fans arriving for the cup ? 
  what about visas ? 
  the usa keeps the tournament not only due to their stadiums , but because it 's `` easier '' to arrange everything for the cup . 
  and before you suggest * two/three/x nations , one cup * , please read the [ ** logistical nightmare that was the 2002 wc ** ] ( http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/nydn-features/nations-headache-cup-logistical-nightmare-article-1.490236 ) if two first world nations could barely pull it through , could guatemala and el salvador do it ? 
  the answer is no . 
  a sport it may be , but it 's too connected with the national image to be classified as ** just ** a sport, 
  they have one , they send * pollo * brise\u00f1o to their sub divisions to make space for their then-new acquisition . 
  chargoy probably wont , but the fmf is looking to take it away from them . 
  chucky and tecatito do n't even play in the same position . 
  we may be stacked on the wings ( damm , aquino , chucky , tecatito ) , but we are lacking of world class pure midfielders ( orbel\u00edn , gutierrez and pe\u00f1a and enter in his place , but none of the three could do it , right now , satisfactory, 
  cruz azul is no longer a `` big '' team ; tigres , rayados and pachuca should start an aggressive long term marketing campaign to throw them out of the national image and , if possible , dethrone am\u00e9rica as the biggest team of mexico . 
   is n't it technically illegal by mexican law ? 
  the * pacto de caballeros * and the draft are illegal and they still get away with those . 
  it 's not a cap , it 's some type of a scholarship ( beca ) given to the players, 
   this is the first season of female football, 
  [ this is the second attempt of a female football league ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/liga_mexicana_de_f%c3%batbol_femenil ), 
  yeah , and the more i go the more i dislike the fmf . 
  shit , this is hard to explain . 
  it 's going to be long . 
  the * pacto de caballeros * is a pact between the owners of the teams where in case that something comes along that can damage them , they can unite in one front . 
  that `` something '' tends to be workers ' rights as well as unions and fifa . 
  multiproperty still exist ( banned by fifa ) , most unions die thanks to anti-unions tactics ( let 's hope that rafa attempts survives and fight for the player ) and players do n't have the right to act as free agents . 
  the * draft * is a tool they utilize to control the transfer of players form the national league . 
  all players can be bought and sold during a two day period ( one for liga mx and another for ascenso mx ) , otherwise they remain unemployed until they can look for a job in the next draft . 
  to put it simply , if x player 's contract ran out , no team can hire him without him asking permission ( and paying a fee ) to his originally team . 
  sometimes that means that the teams can actively kill someone 's career because an owner , and sometimes an agent , got pissed with him . 
  $ 2,500 comes from * la ultima palabra * , the link is in the post . 
  it 's already been proven as false . 
  [ by david medrano ] ( http://archive.is/gp4sg ), 
  and benavente does say that some [ due obtain part of their resources with scholarships ( or grunts ) ] ( http://www.universodeportivo.mx/columna/2017/07/26/el-futbol-femenil-tiempo-de-sumar ), 
   ... ca n't they find jobs in the mls or something like that ? 
  a lot of them do , mostly to central american leagues . 
  [ some of them even jump to europe . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6o6wzt/ontinyent_cf_also_signs_edgar_tepa_sol%c3%ads_and/ ), 
   or are the players from the clubs not eligible for the nt either ? 
  they are , they simply must be 100 % mexican . 
  that 's barely minimum salary , and they are expecting professional quality athletes for an amateur remuneration . 
  a lot of them play in the usa women 's league , since they do n't count as foreigners, 
  that link is on the post and some of those statements are also disputed on the post . 
  the documents that are mentioned in the statement can be found [ here ] , and the only relevant article to the conversation that can be found in the rulebook is the social statue article 105.1 . 
   they should have one about what teams should n't do , but this is just the media selecting information and demonizing the fmf . 
  no one will ever write a contract or document saying you will get fired if you get pregnant , thats just a void contract . 
  the draft is both illegal and unexistant on any contract of liga mx , and it 's still controlling the career of the players . 
  also , the media is n't selecting information to `` demoralizing the fmf '' , it 's presenting leaked documents that show a draft of the private guidelines of liga mx femenil . 
  most of those are not longer required by the league , but journalist have found out that some of them ( specially those about appearance , pregnancy and homosexuality ) are applicable by the internal guidelines of the teams . 
   tl ; dr : this is not about the rules the fmf is imposing , it 's about the rules the fmf, 
  yup , the fmf decided to have a hands-off approach to these type of guidelines . 
  and that 's still something to accuse the fmf of . 
  was he bad ? 
  maybe ? 
  ca n't check right now , i 'm in class, 
  future tigres player . 
  sorry , forgot to add the link . 
  [ here are all the rulebooks of the fmf ] ( http://www.ligabancomer.mx/cancha/reglamentos ), 
  also :, 
   ... please find something where the fmf says pregnant women are to be fired , and that 3,500 is the top salary, 
  do you seriously think they are that stupid ? 
  come on , do n't you think they should learn from their biggest mistakes ? 
  the whole cachirul scandal started when a journalist found conflicting information between two documents presented by the federation . 
  do n't you think they would clean the text twice before showing it to the public ? 
  there is n't anything obvious , the nearest are articles 63 and 105.1 , but even then they are as scrubbed as possible . 
   it 's a cheap shot from the media to make the claims and not back them up except with maybe some disgruntled players or former players . 
  you know these reporters can make anyone say almost anything by pricking and poking them long enough with loaded questions , or even editing the interviews and taking `` creative liberties '' . 
  fake newz !!, 
  fake newz !!, 
  pepe is on the case !!!, 
  no , but seriously , get off the fmf pole , that thing is rotten as fuck . 
  did you even read the post or came here to shit on the original post that was deleted ? 
  did i just ran with what * la ultima palabra * reported ? 
  no , i looked deeper into the matter and found more people sheding light or refuting the leaked material . 
  some of the sources i linked are before them , so it was n't just some inventing shit in the fly . 
  also :, 
   it 's a cheap shot from the media to make the claims and not back them up except with maybe ** some disgruntled players or former players . 
  snowden was a disgruntled employee that leaked the nsa files , jeffrey wigand was a disgruntled former employee that leaked about tabacco companis adding amonia to the cigarrettes , everett stern was a disgruntled employee that leaked hsbc laundering money . 
  none of them resulted to be lying , so being disgruntled and faking reports are not connected . 
  and since you only belive official documents , here is something for you . 
  [ read what the fmf said about the allegations ] ( http://www.ligafemenil.mx/cancha/detallenoticia/21308/postura-de-la-liga-mx-femenil ) read it carefully . 
  now that you 've read it , here is a list of what * la ultima palabra * said :, 
   * if a player gets pregnant their contract is voided . 
   * no social or medical security ( insurance ) for the players . 
   * players ca n't appear too masculine . 
   * any case of homosexuality is strictly prohibited . 
   * salary cap for players is 2500 pesos ( around $ 140 dollars a month ), 
  now , paragraph 2 refutes the 1 ^ ^ st , 3 ^ ^ rd and 4 ^ ^ th claim paragraph 3 and 4 refutes the 2 ^ ^ nd . 
  but nowhere do they refute the 5 ^ ^ th claim , the one involving the salary cap . 
  you may want to invoke paragraphs 5 or 6 , but they are so vague that refutes nothing about the last one .
