  but hey man , at least it is not a cachirul scandal again, 
  fire sale !, 
  young fresh meat on sale !, 
  just today !, 
  its going out !, 
  someone is getting burn ... 
  respect for the homeboy !, 
  its a fire sale , you can buy even their sexy milf mothers !, 
  i love tuca 's 4-2-3-1, 
  rather they should anwser who is gon na take this molotov cocktail right now , 'cause herrera fate is onvious, 
  chelsea , they have a lot of young players . 
  also , porto , psv and ayax . 
  hey mate , its a fire sale !, 
  we are desperate , not stupid !, 
  the two escobars , hilsbourg and barbosa : the man who made all of brazil cry . 
  also , one that you should avoid is ilusi\u00f3n nacional . 
  its is as informative as a column from hola !, 
  'cause that is what the memo from perez said !, 
  almost everyone from the mexican nt at the 1978 wc , they were apparently the new blood of mexican football . 
  also , most of the sub17 mexican nt , some of them remained in the 2\u00ba division, 
  they kind of did back when they reached the finals , they obtained permission to take players of other clubs . 
   mexico, 
  let 's have on wensday some chicken soup !, 
  and on argentina we will shag your wifes !, 
  said by the one whose club 's nickname is ** millonarios ** ... 
  there are more of clips than a full documentary . 
  still , great ones . 
  win videoton !, 
  make hungarian football something more than a punchline !, 
  kroos is like `` where is my kid ? 
  '' , ronaldo is like `` oops '' , and isco pretty much gave away all hope of getting his kid back, 
  great !, 
  now , who is cleaning the mess ? 
  the one of the lile of hazard ? 
  what the hell happened to him ? 
  for god 's sake , not tuca !, 
  wait , ouya is still a thing ? 
  tigres will be really shite :(, 
  well , i have no clue . 
  competition is something nasty on teams , i still remember when i actually had a fight with the vice capitan 'cause he told me to quit 'cause i was `` too brown '' for the team . 
  i still played on the team just to fuck with him , but love for them was gone . 
  as an advice , thng of what you love . 
  if football , the game and the art , is above the arses that play it , continue ; if you are just in to lose some time , get out , you will just end up mad at everything . 
  also , begin to talk to those freshman and outsiders and help them identify their strengths. , work on that and the team will flourish on a later date , but not now . 
  nah , that will just make an already troubled squad into a clusterfuck , and then the competition will get from hard to nasty . 
  rafa marquez did wont shite with his debut team atlas , but back then he was considered one fo the best players of the league . 
  and people like la volpe have won the wc and they are not considered as one of the best goalkeepers to ever play . 
  results are not the only way no measure a player . 
  america , because fuck them . 
  meanwhile , river is about to be crushed in the final, 
  well , the big spenders already have used their budgets or they had prefer to close the wallet for a while, 
  no , that is cuauthemoc blanco , 'cause just as maradona [ he is now interested in politics ] ( http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/2281354/cuau-se-registra-como-precandidato-del-partido-socialdemocrata ), 
  chealsea or shalke 04, 
  he sucker punch faintelson on national tv and now he gambles like jordan , he probably will indebt the city for a century . 
  el divino gaitan against america on the liguilla , he took the team and reverted the global score so that tigres would pass to the next round, 
  the final of the sudamerican cup pachuca vs colo colo , which was won on colo colo 's stadium, 
  ... i felt like i was six and i arrived to some weird page after looking for roms, 
  holy shit !, 
  so guille franco and vela did score !, 
  no offense , but your the atlas de guadalajara of germany , more than fifty years of not winning a title even when they truly fight for one . 
  from the national league : tigres , queretaro and atlas . 
  the first due to big transfers , and the managers from the last two . 
  from foreign leagues : schalke 04 , chelsea and real madrid . 
  schalke due to huntelaar , chelsea for mourinho and rafa benitez 's version of real madrid, 
  no , because, 
  a ) there is no identity on teams where players are not fans of the team or even interested before in playing there ;, 
  b ) that 's where the knock out stage enters , there is where the little teams actually can fight , here at mexico the last two that entered to the liguilla went to the finals ;, 
  and c ) even on the model you present money buys the titles , see miami heat . 
  also look for `` bad boys '' and `` the great train robbery '' from espn 30 for 30 , they all show that money was required to buy the titles . 
  its just less obvious . 
  great work man, 
  because its the only professional league of that expensive and yet horrible version of rugby , why did you think that nfl europe fold ? 
  that kids eyes just light up like fire when he saw ronaldo 's face, 
  still , the last one looks great, 
  no offense mate , but there is little to no internal and reliant information about the league and its paraphernalia , even about their fourth place in 1966 wc . 
  and not only that , but the few times they appear on the international spotlight tends to show some aspects that reinforce clichees about nk , specially with the kim 's family ego . 
  oops , a bit to late, 
  gon na awnser again / u/atlanta-avenger ( sorry ) . 
  now , as for mlb and nhl , their is a tradition that goes beyond north america . 
  there are countries where baseball or hockey is above football , and both leagues are ** way ** better than any other local league due to years of organization . 
  so there is that . 
  ( also , i used to play baseball ), 
  as for nba , they were the only ones until recently , and those leagues have yet to go international . 
  some of them even depend on football teams , like barcelona and real madrid . 
  so again , there are the best league due to years of organization ( i also used to play basketball ), 
  as for nfl , they are the only professional league . 
  there are countries where college american football are a thing , but just that . 
  most of the leagues tend to fold due to the cost of the infrastructure , so there is a monopoly of the viewership of the sport . 
  as for the $ 1m 10 min ad , i do n't see the appeal to goat over it . 
  it looks pity to use the monopoly to that extent . 
  barely reported outside their continent , just as basketball leagues from europe, 
  walter gaitan , that 's all . 
  just see the games , one will hook you up . 
  surely . 
  that 's what happened to me , i saw walter gaitan 's best years at tigres . 
  sometimes , specially during those awful seasons with jose luis trejo as a manager at tigres . 
  as for international games , dad love to watch again italy-brazil at spain '82 just to see dino zoff, 
  i thought it was `` wensday '' ... 
  god no !, 
  not 78 again !,
