  why would the fmf not talk about the last claim if it was as `` fake '' as the other 4 ? 
  i 've read your post , i 've seen some of your videos . 
  i know you have a brain . 
  fucking use it . 
  even our bench is better than some teams starting xi . 
  two crosses that started from the same side , maza stopped both of them . 
  volpi , you fuck !, 
  sturm and \u00c1lvarez went for the ball in a long ball situation . 
  \u00c1lvarez won , but newtonian physics and sturm 's head connected with \u00c1lvarez face . 
  it went bloody and their mentioning a possible broken bone due to the inflammation presented in the injury . 
  god , that got me so pissed . 
  he is bleeding on the ground and there goes volpi accusing him of time wasting . 
  are someone having problems with axtel tv , azteca 13 is not passing the game even while being the one with the rights . 
  still here , and happy that my worries are flying away, 
  me too , but they were suppose to play it in azteca 13 , but somehow their not passing it . 
  i know that this is n't football related , but i found this in the half time . 
  [ enjoy it , specially if you 're a wrestling fan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z5odcj6l3o ), 
  back to the line of four, 
  oh fuck off , you 're team plays like pigs in a pen, 
   and your team is ruining football by spending all that money . 
  and vuoso came for 3 pesos and a picture of your mother . 
  [ here is the squad of lobos buap ] ( http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/2017/07/31/jorge-villalpando-ya-entrena-con-lobos-buap-ante-la-baja-de-lucero ) , they only have two goalkeepers , and one of them is lucero \u00c1lvarez . 
  he is the guy that quit chiapas to play futsal , but then went back to play with the sub 20 . 
  he was , he was also part of a radio show in puebla, 
  apparently so, 
  goddamit tigres , you had this in the bag . 
  probably the same of hakan \u00c7alhano\u011flu, 
  i doubt it was money , more rumors point tuca , who apparently had a change of heart at the last hour . 
  went down the toilet along maxi rodriguez apparent transfer . 
  [ an archive version of the post ] ( http://archive.is/tv04i ), 
  do you find it strange that fmf is trying to replicate the pl model here in mexico ? 
   big black dildo : virgil , scorpio, 
  you 're forgetting tatanka , hall said that virgil back out from competing in a dick measuring competition against tatanka . 
  the 3rd and last one are the best pictures imo . 
  yeah , it reminded me of tolo near the end of his tenure with tigres , the desesperation creeping , slowly killing his self confidence . 
  goddamit , did they really needed to copy univisi\u00f3n with that fucking `` fuego '' gimmick ? 
  like if * loco * abreu would n't do the same . 
  true , but my point is that the shooting style should n't be vilified . 
  the striker should be buried for trying something ** way above ** his skills on an important game . 
  he was already retired since lobos fired him , this is barely a formality . 
  fuck , now it 's either not seeing the goals due to commercials ( tv azteca ) or this dumb fucks ( televisa ), 
  now that 's something interesting . 
  out from the start , you would n't like tigres , rayados , pachuca and america , they currently have a lot of flair . 
  i am not sure how you would see chivas , since their popularity comes from their philosophy , not their football . 
  i 'm not really sure if i could recommend cruz azul or atlas , that is too cruel to anyone outside of mexico . 
  puebla is near bankruptcy , so that would n't last long . 
  maybe toluca ? 
  they are red and they used to play a very defensive style . 
  also la bombonera architecture is close to that of classic english stadiums . 
  otherwise , lobos buap ( they 're currently on fire ) , necaxa ( they came back to stay after years of being america 's developmental ) , leon ( a renewed team passing through some harsh times that is located on what was once one of the biggest hotbeds of football ) , quer\u00e9taro ( they 're also currently playing a very counter-attacking style and volpi is a great goalkeeper ) and tijuana ( they look cool once in a while ) . 
  very interesting and great research for your post . 
  btw , poor damian . 
  tuca brought him as a temporary piece until they get someone else ( either carioca or medel ) . 
  will you also do a series of post for copa mx ? 
  or rather * chivas , the fake team of mexico * since that the motto `` the team of mexico '' originated in atlante , not chivas . 
  i call bullshit on [ palacios ' statement ] ( https://twitter.com/williampalaci33/status/894743009610178560/photo/1 ) , he was already fired twice for indiscipline , one of those involved drinking in the job regularly . . 
  in fact , i 'll be impressed if he even remembered what happened that day . 
  [ schwartz is asking for an interview in twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/fersch_4/status/894855207833788416 ), 
  nice, 
  what is `` stamppot '' ? 
  i once made tacos out of 2 days old pizza , so it must be taco-able . 
  nop , tuca send a combination of our bench and the sub20 . 
  still , this is ridiculous . 
  axl rotten 's spit is 90 % alcohol , so it can work as a disinfectant, 
   s\u00e1nchez tiene experiencia en la liga estadunidense , donde ha pasado por dallas y fort lauderdale strikes de la united soccer league . 
  from espn, 
  yeah , no wonder he did n't even get a minute . 
   why ca n't you guys compete with some mls teams and get mexicans internationals like dos santos and vela in your league ? 
  3 reasons, 
    every team has a right over a player 's future , so long that is the last team where said player worked in , in the league , both in the first and second division . 
  esqueda , for example , depends on jaguares de chiapas , who died last season , when looking for a job in the league . 
  vela can only go to chivas , unless other team negotiates the right with chivas on the draft . 
  the dos santos brothers are , right now , sought not only for their draw and qulity of one of them , but also to control the rights over them . 
  * 2 . - mexican media, 
    football is above almost everything in the minds of most mexicans , except god and baseball in sinaloa . 
  therefore , there is an media industry behind the sport that ranges from analysis to paparazzi . 
  football in the usa is around the fourth or fifth sport , mostly thanks to latin americans . 
  tmz and espn would barely report on giobrandy dos chelas and the viva la peda posse hijinks , something that would not happen in mexico . 
    the only two teams that looked for the three of them are chivas ( guadalajara ) and america ( ciudad de m\u00e9xico ) , both cities do n't have the same aura than los angeles have . 
  so in conclusion :, 
  * less politics, 
  * less media pressure, 
  * more parties . 
  atlante made their fame in mexico city , not in quintana roo . 
   1 . - tigres vs rayados ( same city , then they added uanl vs tecnologico de monterrey [ they used to play in the stadium of that university until recently ] ) , chivas vs atlas ( same city ) and cruz azul vs america ( known as el clasico joven , they used to play in the same stadium [ estadio azteca ] back when cruz azul was one of the best teams of mexico ), 
   2 . - i think it 's stupid and tends to work against the promoted team , just like the fmf intended it to be . 
   3 . - still think it 's stupid and this :, 
    the eredivisie does this as well but ... demotion . 
   was the original purpose for liguilla . 
   4 . - it depends a lot on the financial health of states and how football expanded on said states . 
  * 1 . - in the world we are probably between # 9 - # 12 . 
  in latin america we are the number # 3 , behind argentina and brazil . 
  * 3 . - a clusterfuck , osorio is not only damaging the team , he is also damaging the players . 
  reports have come through that tigres refused to send more players because the ones that they send return confused and out of rythm when trying to play in their natural positions . 
  * 4 . - pachuca , atlas , chivas and pumas . 
  * 5 . - when tigres won the title against santos laguna . 
  also el aztecazo and that final against america . 
  * 6 . - beer and musical instruments . 
  the porras are very passionate about their teams . 
  * 7 . - el volcan ( tigres ' stadium ) is old and still has the cement seats .
