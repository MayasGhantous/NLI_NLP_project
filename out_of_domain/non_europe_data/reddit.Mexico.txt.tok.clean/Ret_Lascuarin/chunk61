  it 's also 90 % reserved before the season even begins . 
  that still looks like a torta . 
  you 're forgetting * el pollo * with cd feirense, 
  what 's your opinion , as a feirense fan , about antonio brise\u00f1o . 
  his alt is also suspended, 
  what part of portugal 's fine cuisine can be put in a taco ? 
   what are porras ? 
  supporter 's groups, 
  every , but most teams have only one . 
  tigres has [ libres y lokos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libres_y_lokos ) , rayados has la adicci\u00f3n , america has la monumental . 
  they 're like barras bravas or firms, 
   maintaining the status quo ? 
  yup . 
  televisa , and to a lesser extend tv azteca , control a lot in mexican football , [ it was company policy that america must always look good and strong . 
  ] ( http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/deportes/futbol/2016/10/11/televisa-hace-que-el-america-sea-popular ) they are the shawn michaels of football . 
  the only reason we never became like greece is because there are some companies that can at least keep their players . 
  i mean , the only reason aguinaga never went to america was because the president zedillo blocked the transfer , otherwise they would have completly dismateled necaxa before they ended up doing . 
   `` porra '' is short for `` esporra '' which is a word for `` cum '' . 
  i will never read porra without thinking this . 
   libres y lokos , the cum that kneeled televisa [ source ] ( http://www.record.com.mx/columnistas-ignacio-suarez/libres-y-lokos-la-barra-que-arrodillo-la-tv ), 
   cum present in the 2017 confederation 's cup [ source ] ( https://www.publimetro.com.mx/mx/publisport/2017/06/18/foto-la-monumental-presente-la-confederaciones-2017-rusia.html ), 
   is it possible to compare the relationship between televisa and america with redbull and leipzig ? 
  nop , it 's worse . 
  because televisa controls almost all of the channels of open tv ( tv abierta ) in mexico . 
  they control most of the distribuition , which is a key component of a succesful football team . 
  and it was worse before . 
   the only team i know from the north is tijuana , not sure if there are others that are popular or not . 
  tigres and rayados are from monterrey , a city in the north of mexico, 
  also, 
   i just assumed teams in mexico would be fan-owned, 
  i do n't think there is even a fan owned team in liga mx rigth now . 
   has lucha libre ever been involved with national football ? 
  for some reason i want to see chris jericho coming out with his theme to a game . 
   ( sporting went into a dork age after the 80 's began ), 
  could you expand on what happened ? 
  also :, 
   ( namely , the desire to challenge the social and economic hegemony that the city of lisbon had over the whole country - there is still hegemony , but to a lesser extent ) . 
  hence why most of the important teams are in mexico city . 
  will it taste good if i put some frijoles and machaca in it ? 
  machaca is dried meat, 
  still no honda , and pachuca already scored, 
  dumb foul , great penalty shot by gignac, 
  injury, 
  do n't , it 's way too funy to get mad, 
  not much , but the worst games are tigres-santos , [ tigres-rayados ] ( http://www.info7.mx/locales/exhiben-nuevos-videos-de-agresiones-tras-el-clasico-regio/1847248 ) ( ca n't find the video where they throw a tigres fan from a bridge ) , rayados-santos , pumas-america and atlas-chivas, 
  maybe aviles , pizarro and due\u00f1as . 
  damm could also be in the list but i 'm currently mad at him , so just those three . 
  not excatly , it depends from team to team . 
  tigres is ** owned ** by the universidad aut\u00f3noma de nuevo le\u00f3n . 
  they own the stadium , the name , the brand , the colors , the history , everything . 
  however , tigres is ** administred ** by sinergia deportiva , a subsidary of cemex , a cement company in monterrey . 
  they are the ones that makes all the desicions involving the team . 
  in other words , tigres , the team , is rented to sinergia deportiva by the university . 
  if the team choose to move , they lose everything , including the players . 
  pumas unam ( universidad nacional aut\u00f3noma de m\u00e9xico ) is also owned by the university , however the dean nor any university administrator or other personnel have any right or power over the team . 
  the team and its organization is managed by [ el patronato ] ( http://www.patronato.unam.mx/ ) , which is a bunch of rich unam alumni that administrate the team . 
  the idea was to separate the team to liberate resources to the university , as well as using pumas as a source of resources . 
  the patronato is a clusterfuck , so the best way i can summarized is with the schr\u00f6dinger cat , the patronato is and is n't part of the university , depending on when you look at it ,, 
  it appears that lobos buap ( benem\u00e9rita universidad aut\u00f3noma de puebla ) has the same separation . 
  which is kind of good , since there is no need of having [ another dean forcing his way into the team . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmicxofyfcy ), 
  you know what 's the funniest part of it ? 
  that the older generations always leave trashing and crying like childrens , shouting about the lack of respect from the new and throwing their history to anyone 's faces . 
  this has happened before and will happen again . 
  so if anything , we should be proud that they are afraid . 
  barks but never bites , classic castillo, 
  this is barely a round up , but still informative . 
  i did n't know about omar govea until know . 
  you have posted the same comment three times . 
  and castillo is before the 90s , so la pendejez is clearly not tied to the age of the speaker . 
  they ca n't televisa has them block to transmit through any sort of channel . 
   ** any ** sort of channel . 
  considering there is a stipulation on all televisas ' contracts that reads :, 
  ] ( http://www.record.com.mx/columnistas-ignacio-suarez/las-clausulas-increibles-y-las-amenazas-de-emilio ), 
  i do n't think your ideal will make the cut . 
  apparently they will , they fired wasserman and hired some other dude connected to televisa . 
  unless they offer under 75 million pesos or espn throws them money a la ted dibiase , lobos will be transmitted through televisa . 
  there is a sipute over money, 
  [ here is a post about the situation ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6p0s4e/on_lobos_buap_lack_of_broadcast/ ), 
  they 're still recovering from mike ashley and their relegation , so the rangers that dominated the spl is not the same as the current ranger . 
  thanks, 
  thanks, 
  where did you find about c\u00e9sar mart\u00ednez and ~ ~ aldo maga\u00f1a ~ ~ arriving as a loan ? 
  we went from banegas , to losing pizarro , and later being rebuffed by nandez , abila and medel , to bringing one of the best defensive chileans midfielders . 
  would have still prefer medel or keeping pizarro , but this is still good . 
  edit : goddamn, 
  more like the 50s, 
  swamp butterfly ; flies like one , stinks like one, 
  is this guy any good ? , his name has been poping up in some transfer rumor columns . 
  as a quick follow-up of that post , the dean of buap went to televisa 's headquarters to negotiate this game broadcast and ended up with nothing , rumor has it that they offered only a tv deal for less than what was originally negotiated or nothing . 
  this will end up in a fist fight , with the surprise return of chuy 's cousin . 
  nope , still nothing , not even rumors . 
  two players jumped for the ball , skulls collide , one of them started leaking blood from his mouths . 
  [ apparently they are trying to hide vamos america from the fans with wolf howls ] ( https://twitter.com/cesarulices/status/899048900027351040 ), 
  there is a non-aggresion pact between televisa and tv azteca on tv deals with football teams . 
  hey , for every * you 'll never walk alone * , you have 10 despacitos . 
  yup, 
  considering that , according to rumors they were the main force behind the recent changes to promotion and relegation , they deserve being relegated . 
  the ones involving the stadium size and other `` elements '' required to have the right to be promoted . 
  only 6 teams have , right now , the right to be promoted .
