  we would have won the final of libertadores if guerron started both games . 
   i wish he did n't leave so soon . 
  same with sobis :(, 
  geez , i wonder why ? 
  were they using a laser against the ref ? 
  some commentator in televisa 's transmission was stranged that tigres 's fan would applaud him . 
  you only have two less than us and never arrived to a libertadores final , so count them while you can ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ puma . 
  he is out of rythm right now , give him some time to recover the bulldozer that he was with us . 
  [ shit man , i did n't know all of them were cut outs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yocy4nkd9yg ), 
  it 's almost like america is drawing less and less as time goes on , maybe piojo can help with that . 
  nop , they just do n't draw as much as almost everyone , but that does n't mean that they do n't have fans . 
  this is a consequences of their attempts to build an identity , they decided to create the idea of the `` superior fan '' , add some fanatism already in the fans before this attempt and and an ego thanks to the name-recongnition of their players and their new stadium . 
  worst part of all , they wo n't to anything until they actually kill someone . 
  every team has them , but there is a difference between simply having too many shitty fans to creating an environment that allowed their growth . 
  the neatherlands never won the wc but no one doubts their power as a team . 
  because you do n't see dumbfucks like you shitting on teams because they are n't `` as big as us '' when you ca n't even pass the to the semifinals . 
  you argument is `` the did n't won it '', 
  my argument is `` the results show that we where the second in a batch of the best 38 teams in south america and mexico , something that most teams in mexico and south america have never reached . '', 
   thundercats, 
  * thunder !, 
  thunder !, 
  * ** thundercats !, 
   in short , piper 's ego is pretty much out of control and he 's just going on tv and blabbering about whatever pops into his head and no one seems to be able to stop him . 
  this sounds a lot like 2000 scott steiner . 
  was n't he later involved on the wcw racism lawsuit ? 
  * is this real life *, 
  either gaitan , gignac or lobos . 
  while i like jim 's `` never preorder '' idea , there must be exceptions to every rule . 
   maybe . 
  around 3 minutes after they announce the preorder bonuses, 
   imagine if a bunch of white supremacists went to africa , attacked and displaced the local people and put up a monument to their own white supremacist leaders . 
  is n't that most of africa during the xix century ? 
  or [ south africa ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/10/vandalism-of-apartheid-era-statues-sparks-fevered-debate-in-south-africa ) in particular ? 
  i had to double check it with my eyes , but neither them nor espn are lying . 
  jonathan fabbro , who was an arrest warrant for rape of a minor , signed with lobos buap , who represent a public university , with no announcement nor notice about it . 
  every culture has their own offensive slangs and symbols , the inverted peace sign ( a v sign where they show the back of the hand ) is translated as a fuck off , the same message given with the middle finger . 
  5 minutes after marcelo d\u00edaz enters ruidiaz scores, 
   he was on bench last week as well . 
  i saw that too , i thought it was a joke . 
  now it 's clear that it was n't . 
  do n't jinx it !, 
  is he good as a dm and how is his discipline ? 
  fuck , i 'll repost it in a moment, 
  repost because `` sue '' is a better translation than `` demand '' . 
  repost because `` sue '' is a better translation than `` demand '' . 
   i 've never seen he in troubles . 
  ok , that sounds good, 
   he is more a cm, 
  who knows , some say it was just a document about his intention of signing , which apparently it 's legally binding . 
  what it is known is that pumas has his international transfer , which is their main tool in the negotiations . 
  the money of tigres ? 
  it comes from sinergia deportiva , whose parent company is cemex , they administrate the team . 
   he does n't have discipline at all , very lazy player , thank god he left, 
  jesus , this will end a la esqueda , everyone bitter over everything . 
  nico has apparently a clause that forbids being transfered to any liga mx club . 
   . . ( storylines ... 
  * what the hell is this ? 
  * it 's a new champion !, 
  * thy 're shaking hands !, 
  * matheus uribe is haking hands with satan himself . 
  for the god , someone tell me this is not happening !, 
  * it 's happening !, 
  matheus uribe has sold his soul for tigres new liga mx championship !, 
  * why uribe ? 
  why this way ? 
  you mean like that , right ? 
  holy shit !, 
  none , unless it 's tdn, 
  god-fucking-dammit !, 
  what the fuck !, 
  just managed to see how tuca stationed them , he went back to the 4-2-3-1 that won the title against santos . 
  but zelarayan is not lobos , nor valencia is mancilla . 
  and it looks like a really bad idea . 
  weirdest fucking call of the week, 
  acosta is asking for a red :(, 
  are they shouting anything when the goalkeeper shoots , i do n't now if the stream is censoring it . 
  did they shout `` puto '' ? 
  yup , they 're shouting `` puto ! '', 
  univisi\u00f3n , maybe ? 
  i know that america will never stop being grande , after all they are the sport pet project of televisa . 
  but we just won the moral ground , if only for today . 
  that was a nice assist of darwin . 
  welcome to classic tuca , tries to smother a game with just one goal . 
  he wont , he is one of piojos favourite players . 
  piojo is not a good coach , he is a great motiviator and can revamp any team , but every long term project collapses . 
  rayados fired him when he could n't motivate them any more . 
  i hope he did , but he had no long term project in any of the teams he managed since rayados . 
  hope he has learned . 
  i know , fucking weird . 
  the only rumor points to andres roa , but he is a offensive winger . 
  poor torres , he is going to lose those few minutes he was getting . 
  is any of those a dm ? 
   ( 2nd division spain ), 
  sanse plays in segunda divisi\u00f3n ** b ** , which is third division . 
  finally !, 
  a dm !, 
  both counts are false rumors , lay\u00fan choose to stay in portugal after a big offer came from rayados and reyes is looking for a team in spain . 
  nop , the transfer window close in the 5 ^ ^ th of september , though i 'm not sure if america will let reyes and layun to go to tigres .
