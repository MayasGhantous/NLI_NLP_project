  hands of our * chino * , he may not be tuca 's favourite player he is damn good when he arrives to the pitch, 
   looks like not being able to televise their games is having a big impact, 
  ecw and other indie promotios , as well as the early mma promotions , died when they were pulled from tv and ppv companies , lobos knew they would have a rough season when they choose to ask more from televisa . 
  pretty much , but i doubt the university would allow to use any platform not authorized by the patronato ( i have no idea how o translate that , but it 's a bunch of alumni with power over the football team ) . 
  has any modern team in first division has ever asked the public for money to stay in said division ? 
  [ lobos buap is currently doing that ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6vw2gv/lobos_buap_is_asking_for_donations_to_stay_in/ ) , but i 'm not sure if there is a precedent of this . 
  televisa blocked them , they wanted to lobos to kneel to them . 
  lobos buap refused and now are , according to rumors , negotiating with espn . 
  i was expecting queretaro to be the first one , considering that they are amongst the biggest draw in women football . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.ligafemenil.mx/cancha/detallenoticia/21736/asistencia-de-la-jornada-4 ), 
  [ fox sports ad ] ( https://twitter.com/futparaellasmx/status/900892324758253568 ), 
  i am not sure because they 're also tied to the university , specially in regards to external funds . 
  maybe the board of administrators ? 
  though the dean is never part of `` el patronato '' . 
  no , the tv deal they had with tdn was only for ascenso mx , but a clause of said deal also block them in liga mx in any form of transmission . 
  they have just finish their no-compete clause , but negotiations with espn are slow . 
  weird , the page of the league does n't have anyone broadcasting said games . 
  then again , they also do n't have this addition on the site . 
  those fucking cunts are truly the scum that will kill the nt . 
   thank you for taking the time to write this ,, 
  thank you . 
  now hands off our * chino *, 
  they 're probably trying to force a transfer . 
  the same zelarayan that scored [ this goal against america ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u7eysjf-sc ), 
   it 's not good for tigres that they 're building up this asshole reputation . 
  see ventura alvarado , he pretty much did absolutely everything to ** cancel ** his transfer to tigres . 
  they 're not underfunded , they were blocked to obtain their own tv deal and tv azteca also refused any offer by lobos buap . 
  they lost one of the key revenue streams due to televisa-tv azteca duopolio . 
  also this :, 
   this is a reason they want to get rid of plrelegation . 
  way too many underfunded teams . 
  is horeshit , they want to protect their own investment , they do n't give a fuck if lobos buap , dorados , atlante , etc. 
  are underfunded , they care that the usual suspects ( televisa and tv azteca ) do n't lose their investments ( atlas , am\u00e9rica , etc. 
  arevalo exited from veracruz and arrived to racing like a month ago, 
  wow guerron , that was a horrible header . 
  and right now they are shitting on lobos , with a `` they do n't know how they should act '' and ascenso mx `` lack of mls flair '' . 
  i am just seeing it for guerron . 
  they were shitting on lobos lack of tv deal ( and consequent lack of resources ) with a `` did n't they understand how things work here '' and then said that those teams ( ascenso mx ) do n't allow us to compete with the mls flair . 
  [ here is one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uou7dkm6lhu ), 
  oh come on , the veracruz that right now plays there is not the same veracruz that played in the 90s . 
  god , tv azteca is truly pushing for an mls style, 
  that was a penalty . 
  and the veracruz where bakero played is not the same veracruz that is playing right now , it would be as counting those that played with * jabatos * as having played with tigres . 
  this game is boring , the commentators are both imbeciles and swallowing corporate bullshit ( tv azteca is truly afraid that there investment go to the shits ) and the comments in the stream have been filled with spammers and assholes . 
  and guerros been playing like shit , worse than zarate with tigres . 
  the ones of tv azteca , i have them right now on mute 'cause it 's a lot of bullshit that comes from the tv . 
  that * polaco * has been a great addition to veracruz, 
  true , but this came just when rumors of the fmf looking to change to a closed shop system and tv azteca blacklisting lobos buap came out . 
  they were the main force to the recent changes to promotion and relegation, 
  i 've just noticed * palmera * rivas on the bench . 
  6 minutes ? 
  they are truly helping pumas . 
  and the commentators keep fellating the new script by televisa-tv azteca . 
  warrior , chinga tu madre . 
  shut up , i want to hear the jaw 's theme . 
  poor torres , he just lost all of his potential minutes at liga mx . 
  silvio may not be the best player , but esqueda could n't get the a place in the bench , even when they needed mexicans in the team , nor in central american teams . 
   i 'm pretty sure if i was in charge of most teams , using what i know in economics ( working on business administration degree ) by then i 'd be able to turn a small team with big potential into champions, 
  so did jorge nacer gober thought when he [ bought san luis ] ( http://eleconomista.com.mx/deportes/2012/04/26/nacer-global-ficha-san-luis-us40-millones ) , but all he got was a team dead on arrival with no future other than being a money draining team . 
   he still was going around buying no national team foreigners and not getting coaches to debut more mexicans, 
  you ... do you actually understand what makes a football team ** sustainable ** ? 
  like ... how they get cash , and tv deals , and radio deals , and stuff ? 
  'cause it looks like you spend too much time in fm to see the clusterfuck that it 's administrating a football orginization . 
   esqueda led them to the libertadores semi final . 
  esqueda barely played and he mostly scored when tuca pretty much threw the game by putting the subs and reserves players on the starting xi ( juan aurich ) . 
  you may need atlas for their academy and some of tijuana 's scouts , also your vision only works when a team has an already big stream of revenue . 
  only tigres , am\u00e9rica and rayados can fund your vision . 
  also , the guy from santo tome nt , like luis leal , may not be as good as edgar mendez of spain . 
  being in an nt only means that he is , or was , one of the 22 best players of a country , but not the best in front of players with no caps . 
   youth nt or a senior nt you prob sly jut are n't good enough, 
  exactly , maybe they were n't good enough to participate on that squad , but being a participant of any nt squad is not a warranty of overall quality , only of regional qualty . 
  players like zarate , silva , and many others liga mx busts could make players of nt look like amateurs , because being the one of the best 22 players of a country , like l\u00ea c\u00f4ng vinh of vietnam who has 51 goals and 83 appearances and more at youth level , does not equate him as better than benedetto , who just had his first cap . 
  yup, 
  there is no way to justify the new stadium `` standards '' with those fucking numbers . 
  was on the stadium , got absolutely livid when this happened . 
  while it may be a good idea to get a replacement for both juninho ( 34 ) and ayala ( 30 and injury prone ) , i 'm not sure that an [ injured prone player ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.com/timothee-kolodziejczak/verletzungen/spieler/84085 ) would be a good idea . 
  wait ... 
  holy shit !, 
  i got first place !, 
  does anyone knows about timoth\u00e9e kolodziejczak of borrusia m\u00f6nchengladbach , josuha guilavogui of wolsburg , alexander szymanowski of leganes , takashi inui of eibar , ravel morrison of lazio and danilo barbosa of braga ? 
  all of those names are right now aking rounds in the liga mx 's rumor mill . 
  they will apparently announce it at 8 pm , or so they said in espn . 
  [ this one is still my favourite ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/sep/01/transfer-deadline-day-berahino-de-gea-and-more-live ), 
   paris saint-germain confirm the signing of kylian mbappe from monaco . 
  ligue 1 is already decided . 
  ca n't wait for psg - barcelona in the cl . 
  there was hope with an ~ ~ in-form nice and ~ ~ monaco . 
  to suffer , life as an arsenal fan is nothing more than a series of unfortunate events that will break your heart .
