  it was karma man , you stole from a lot of teams and now the same tactics are affecting your team . 
  and a goalkeeper, 
  teo gutierrez comes to mind . 
   nice lost important players this summer . 
  well , that answers why they were so bad in the last game i saw of them . 
  who else could potentially fight psg ? 
  he is not bad , he is just not great . 
  firt time i 've ever heard said nickname . 
  [ there is this ] ( https://twitter.com/1996javi/status/903302812808957952 ), 
  those internet points are necessary for some twats . 
  he is pissed because people downvoted him for shitting on liga nos ( portugal 's first division ) in general and porto in particular . 
  he is just another troll that stalks black guys on twitter , too fragile to take downvotes on his `` logical arguments '' . 
  he is also very dilligent with his racism , he keeps finding tweets of [ 72 likes from unverified accounts ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cringeanarchy/comments/6w5ukk/black_people_are_tired_of_having_to_save_america/ ), 
   the worst user in this sub . 
  he is clearly on the low 5 , but he has yet to defend trump on this sub to be worst . 
  apparently apoel will sign raul gudi\u00f1o of porto today, 
  he is a good goalkeeper with a lot of potential , but his last games with madeira where marred with some awful performance and accusations of match fixing . 
  [ apoel just signed raul gudi\u00f1o from porto b on a 1 year loan deal ] ( https://twitter.com/apoelfcofficial/status/903343716169117696 ), 
  happy ? 
  [ it 's official ] ( https://twitter.com/apoelfcofficial/status/903343716169117696 ), 
  maybe , apoel just lost their main option , so gudi\u00f1o may be the one for the bench or used for rotation when boy needs some rest . 
  shh ... do n't ruin a good story, 
  already confirmed, 
  you know what 's worse ? 
  i 've only went to three tigres games on my life . 
  they lost allof them . 
  this is a shit show , the funniest part was their attempt to excuse themselves by manipulating the system . 
  as a record columnist wrote yesterday :, 
   their excuses only dirtied it more . 
  iriarte is a goalkeeper that recently arrived to fc ju\u00e1rez as a loan , it 's unknown from whom , 1 month after the draft . 
  what bothers everyone it 's not only the breaking of the rules , but the player was on the starting xi of many games , which should have been cancelled and the opposing team awarded a 3-0 victory . 
  not only that , but the league tried to falsify evidence of it , claiming the transfer was done during draft day , even if his name does n't appear on the finalized transfer sheet . 
  whoever buys them . 
  salmantino uds has the rights of all the history and trophies of ud salamanca after they bought the rights for cents on the euro . 
  we are on the last four days of liga mx transfer window [ here is a summary of the transfer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6aozli/apertura_2017_transfer_thread/ ), 
   the league tried to falsify evidence of it, 
  [ here is the article with the actual games he played ] ( http://www.record.com.mx/columnistas-ignacio-suarez/cachirules-una-historia-sin-fin-en-la-liga-mx ), 
  i remember liking his style when he played in the sudamericana , the same one that colo colo , where he played , lost to pachuca . 
  they will probably swept it under the rug , by itself it 's just a transfer mishap , it 's not the fall of jaguares or the blackmailing , absolute burying that the league is doing to lobos buap . 
  unless they try to make to change history by altering the books even more , then we may have a colossal clusterfuck in our hands . 
  `` she tripped , fell and landed on my dick '' - nasser , maybe, 
   one time where the league , idk , actually has sympathy for a player and allows him to find a team after the fact is being scrutinized ? 
  it 's weird , because there are so many clusterfucks in the story . 
  the main reason seems to be a way to stick it up to lobos buap , who tried the same transfer with saucedo ( from fc juarez , who fired him , to lobos ) , but now they are allowing the same type of transfer with the roles reversed and without lobos participating in the transfer . 
  better salaries than other south american leagues . 
  some , but not all . 
  and european clubs are already looking players in liga mx . 
  so it 's a little less exposure for probably the double in salary . 
  he will play along israel castro . 
  according to eduardo henaine bojalil , the secretary of the board , they hope that something will be signed around next week . 
  better to play there than nowhere . 
  according to eduardo henaine bojalil , the secretary of the board , they hope that something will be signed around next week . 
  here is a post on [ lobos buap current situation ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6p0s4e/on_lobos_buap_lack_of_broadcast/ ), 
  welcome to mexico , we just had another cachirul scandal in second division . 
  nothing for sure right now . 
  ## mexico is on the wc !, 
  i remember when he started using `` eso es ** tolo ** amigos '' during * tolo * gallego 's tenure . 
  no offense , this is a bad idea . 
  we had 5 centerbacks to rotate :, 
  * juninho ( 35 in two weeks ) : his age is showing , so he has a few tournaments left . 
  * ayala ( 31 ) : he just reached his peak , but he is injury prone . 
  * * palmera * rivas ( 32 ) : he was always third option behind juninho and anyone else is on the squad . 
  currently in veracruz, 
  * brise\u00f1o ( 23 ) : great prospect , had an horrible spell in veracruz . 
  he is now in europe . 
  * meza ( 26 ) : he still makes a lot of mistakes . 
  this means that we have two near retirement , one that will forever be third wheel , a lost prospect and one that is starting to take rythm . 
  and they hire an injury prone player . 
  ** injury prone **, 
  he will either become an nava or a * chelito * . 
  they have n't finished the medical , there are players that fail the test . 
  most of those that fail are injury prone . 
  holy shit !, 
  gon na repost it with an acutal healine, 
   there 's not a lot of traction on the barroso rumor . 
  true , but it 's the only rumor with some traction . 
  either puma is using channels with no leaks or they just decided to give up . 
  but you 're apparently still bounf to lose kalinski , though no one knows where he will be offloaded . 
  so it was a free transfer , there were saying in the radio that it was a loan . 
   so to become pumas supporter it 's not necessary to study in these universities , right ? 
  yup, 
   how fun is this , rly . 
  how fun is what ? 
  in the case of unam , they also represent one of the best academies in mexico , so people tend to support the team as an ideal of said philosophy . 
  some of them ( like uanl ) are the only university with a team , so there is n't really any tribialism like the ncaa schools . 
  the only case where someone is a fan of a team because they study there was the leones negros vs tecos ( udg vs uag ) , since they represented two different universities with different backgrounds and structure ( public vs private ), 
   we do n't have clubs that represent universities . 
  ... that is so weird . 
  is mexico the only one with said background ? , we ca n't be the only ones with teams that represent universities . 
  finally ! , they 've been announcing it for a week already . 
  you do realize that they are owned by tv notas , right ? 
  because televisa has a clause in all of their contracts that allows them to control any sort of broadcast , hence why multimedios has to negotiate with televisa instead of tigres and rayados to broadcast any game in their radio stations . 
  because the contract was for ascenso mx games , not liga mx games . 
  however , the clause covers all sorts of competitions , even if the contract does n't cover it . 
  his last team was leones negros , not sure if this will end up in another clusterfuck like iriarte . 
  not much , he was reported missing in mexico city and was last seen [ churubusco ] ( https://megalopolismx.com/noticia/26464/hallan-cuerpo-sin-vida-de-ivan-lorenzone-joven-futbolista-desaparecido-en-cdmx ) , according to his uncle he died [ the same day that he was reported as missing ] ( https://twitter.com/germnlvarez/status/905097524880568320 ), 
  lobos choose to fight for a better contract , hence the blackout and burials done by tv azteca and televisa during football transmissions . 
  their no compete clause , as well as a clause that forced lobos to reveal any and all tv deals offered to them , just expired last week . 
  hence why they are now restarting negotiations with everyone . 
   they needed a good 3rd keeper ?
