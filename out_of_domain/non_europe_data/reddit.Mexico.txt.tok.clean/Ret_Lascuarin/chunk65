  yup , same with tigres ( * lalo * fernandez ) and lobos buap ( jorge villalpando ) . 
  two, 
  if usa loses this game they will fall to 4 ^ ^ th , sending them to the playoff with two games left to play . 
  however , panama is playing against t&t , who has lost all but one game , ** today ** , so this may end up knocking usa out of any wc aspiration . 
  hey man , you are going against one of the contenders in the next game and then the worst on the hexagonal , you have it pretty easy right now . 
  hey man , you go against panama , who would be fourth if they win against t&t , in the next round and the last game is against t&t , who only won one game ( they lose the rest ) . 
  you can still make it . 
   so this ** may ** end up, 
  for fuck 's sake pizarro , we all know you are better than this . 
  grupo pachuca and grupo carso are separating , with carso being the one that is leaving the football business . 
  on a postive note , argentina is still qualified to the 2018 world cup . 
  lobos buap got into this situation by [ fighting for a better tv deal ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6p0s4e/on_lobos_buap_lack_of_broadcast/ ) , which not only dried up their revenue to point that they are [ now asking for donations to stay in first division ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6vw1jm/lobos_buap_is_asking_for_donations_to_stay_in/ ) , they 've also caused the ire from tv networks ( televisa and tv azteca ) , who decided to [ bury them and the relegation system , wrestling style ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6wh7km/according_to_pepe_hanan_a_sports_journalist_in/ ), 
  thanks to / u/amexicaningermany , who reported it as official in a previous post .

  thanks man, 
   they bought all the rights to show the league in the united states ,, 
  they did n't really bought the rights , televisa used them as a way to pay the 5 % that they own of the tv network . 
   you know what, 
  this is reddit , you can use shit . 
   vamos tigres b. 
  tigres ** c ** , the `` big '' team of pumas is our first academy . 
  i am not sure that it would happen , while they 've been on a decline on recent years , tv ( and radio ) are still very powerful and profitable venues of distribution . 
   the unofficial `` chica club '' in the psg locker-room, 
  is that like the kilq of football ? 
  -- lozano - chicharito - jimenez --, 
  this is apparently the last transfer of the window . 
  will he still be part of the squad if he is ineligible to play with independiente ? 
  [ he scored fcb melgar 's two goals against river plate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlcv9v1qnfg ), 
   the buyout clause has been set at ** $ 75m ** . 
  he and gignac have the same agent, 
  that 's the current role of juninho , our capitan , who is currently declining and approaching retirment . 
  fucking finally , they 've been announcing it for like a week . 
  i feel old , even more considering that i was already a fan before he arrived . 
  he is the first of the then-new era with a returning juninho and the exit of gaitan , one of the best players that ever played with tigres . 
  however , i can now safely know that we can win this apertura . 
  maybe . 
  they will call him `` el polaco '' , so to make a polaco vs polaco when tigres plays against veracruz ( cristian menendez is also knowned as `` el polaco '' ), 
  cb , he apparently has a good long ball , he is probably the one that will take juninho 's place . 
   he was closely targeted by arsenal, 
  everyone as been targeted by wegner .

  [ it 's already official . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/tigresoficial/status/906333009799872513 ), 
  tigres third division team, 
  ahoy is way above everyone else on the platform , all of his videos dwarfs anyone else on youtube . 
  this looks like something made in age of empires ii map editor . 
  i 'll call it underwhelming and embarassing . 
  puebla vs cruz azul and santos vs toluca where just boring games . 
  there are games where a 0-0 draw becomes exciting , but everyone arrived on their worst form possible and gave an actual snore fest . 
  atlas vs tigres was a clear example that the tv networks control the fucking league , and they are still shitting on lobos not having a contract with televisa , while also shitting on the promotion and relegation system . 
  it 's funny that a company is now actively looking to get the closed-shop system in mexico , a system build to monopolize everything and who has no effect whatsoever over the competivity of the league ( contrary of what some idiots and gringos believe ) , when both of his teams are near relegation . 
  by the way , tigres is now pressuring atlas ( tv azteca ) [ to pay the fee of one of the friendlies if they want to play the match ] ( http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/2017/09/11/tigres-no-tiene-fechas-atlas-deberia-pagarle-por-cancelar-amistoso ) , while also declaring that they will also force to obtain the three points [ if it affects them negatively on the table ] ( https://twitter.com/tigresoficial/status/906638493052542978 ) . 
  or in other words : `` we have you by the balls '', 
  also , the league is trying to bullshit their way out of [ why they didn \u00b4 t enforce the financial sanctions to atlas ] ( http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/2017/09/11/liga-mx-intenta-justificar-por-que-no-sancionara-al-atlas ) , while civil protection shut down the stadium [ until they pay a fine ] ( http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/2017/09/11/liga-mx-intenta-justificar-por-que-no-sancionara-al-atlas ) . 
  what a clusterfuck . 
  lobos had an horrible game , but their transmission was fine and without any lag . 
  grupo pachuca had some awful games , but leon managed to obtain 3 points , while pachuca wasn \u00b4 t as lucky . 
  america discovered their old self and veracruz ( tigres d ) is slowly collapsing . 
  and just to end this comment , i saw pumas vs xolos . 
  what the fuck happened there ? 
  guerron showed his worst form since his own birth , formica has yet to get any action , calderon looks barely like the one at chivas , that defense was built with scotch tape and good wishes and nico castillo was barely present . 
  at some point the three strikes where on the way too close to effectively participate in a play created by the midfield . 
  let 's hope that the nest week delivers at least some watchable football . 
  neither do i, 
  what was in his shirt ? 
  they just cut the broadcast, 
  electricity just came back online , everyone i know is ok , but we may end up losing our home :(, 
  we just had an earthquake , mom almost had a panic attack because we could n't communicate with dad , i ran out of the appartment in my underwear ( the oldest and ugliest one too ) , and we may end up losing said appartment because the building next to us is collapsing to our direction . 
  we still do n't know what will happen , the building next to us started collapsing during the quake . 
  fortunetly it didn0t collapse , it simply lost tow of the main colums and started tilting to where i live . 
  this was a shit day . 
  it 's less of him being a smug asshole and more of him not handling criticism with patience . 
  aviles and mosquera obtained the double nationality when it could be used to not occupate a foregin slot in the squads , while villalpando apparently has it since birth . 
   not every foreigner wants to take your jobs you know ... 
  true , but that 's not how the agents ( promotores ) see it . 
  from their perspective , the naturalization was a very important tool to increase the logevity and value of a player . 
  hence why they 've even tried to [ falsify the citizenship ] ( http://archivo.eluniversal.com.mx/deportes/57820.html ) when it got complicated . 
  he was decent with us , but he always resented tigres for not fielding him instead sobis who scored more with less time than him , or guerr\u00f3n during his libertadores run , or when gignac and sobis created a beautiful parternship that brought 11 goals for gignac and 10 assits for sobis ( more than anyone else in that season . ), 
  joke about putting a center back as a forward , but there is a reason that * palmera * rivas was favoured by tuca , he could actually scored ( though scarcely ever ) . 
  i always thought that emmanuel cerda should have played as a winger instead of a striker , he was always aware on how a ball was going to travel when they send a long pass to him and had both great pace and acceleration to get it , but only if he got the space , something that strikers do n't usually get . 
  was it them or tv azteca the ones that `` talked '' with frida sofia 's parents ? 
  also [ this is not the first time in mexico city ] ( http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/sociedad/frida-revive-recuerdo-de-monchito-el-nino-del-85-que-no-existio ), 
  well ... will they also try to get vucetich ? 
  though they will get matosas or zubeld\u00eda , both recently fired from their jobs and with liga mx experience . 
  i just noticed that bournemouth is playing in the pl when they would n't be permitted to play in liga mx first division .
