  notable characters : a lot of tribesman, 
  notable gameplay mechanics : you gave favors and had to praise a god ( ca n't remember if the god is the player ), 
  other details :, 
  so this is one that i am going to get yelled at . 
  i never played the game , only the demo which i played very frequently as a kid . 
  i do n't remember well , but i think it came with the gigabyte motherboards , because i remember playing that game around the same time i played serious sam , need for speed i and ii and demos for some game with police mechs and oni . 
  what i do remember is that it was based on tribal elements . 
  like i said before , it may be related to la isla de pascua , since they had stone statues , but the details escape me . 
  also , the map was not plain , as is the norm . 
  it was like a globe , sort of spore-ish but more spherical . 
  also , i 'm not even sure if it was even released . 
  since the season has ended , and some players have already changed colors , here is a list of transfers and some rumors . 
  i will be updating the table when more information comes in . 
  any info is welcomed in the comments . 
  also , sorry for the format , i am shit on simple coding . 
  edit of 9 of june at 0:48 : need to sleep , will review all movements later . 
  vetura alvarado wants mls , i am starting to think that sosa is a bad idea and what the hell happended to damm ?

  what do you expect ? 
  what do you desire ? 
  and what is the most outlandish rumor you 've heard for this draft ? 
  for the uninitiated , the draft is the equivalent of a fire sale where all the teams of the first division ( liga mx ) and the second division ( ascenso mx ) stay for 2 or 3 days on some fancy hotel and sell , buy and loan everything they can within the leagues . 
  that does n't mean that they do n't operate outside the draft ( see : chivas recent aquisition of el gallito vazquez ) , but they normally keep transfer from within the league on these event . 
  now , this draft will be eventful due to new rules given by the federation . 
  the new 10 foregins and 8 `` mexicans '' ( everyone that was mexican before 19 and has played on a sub-division of the fmf . 
  a bit xenophobic and ridiculous , since it affects mexican americans and foregins that end up loving the country as damian and sinha , but understandle due to the abuse of the naturalization rules ) has already damaged some teams like america , atlas and pumas , where they put some of their starting xis players on the transfer list . 
  and drafts are already very active , [ see the transfers for the last time a team ascended ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/anexo:transferencias_del_torneo_apertura_2015_ ( m % c3 % a9xico ) . 
  if you want to know how the thing is unfolded and rumors , [ here is a thread at / r/ligamx on the subject ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/4merq4/2016_summer_transfer_thread/ ), 
  edit : three things i forgot :, 
  * it is commonly refer as the leg market , since the player has no saying on the negotations , just as an nfl/nba/nhl / mlb draft . 
  * the gentleman pact enters on play a lot on this negotations . 
  * officially it starts the 8th , but the negotations already started . 
  most of the great coaches have just received contracts ( mircea lucescu , mourinho , conte ) , are apparently negotating contracts ( emery , sampaoli ) , have been recently fired for incompetence ( pelado d\u00edaz , fabio capello ) , were fired due to even bigger failures ( felipao , parreira ) , retired ( louis van gaal , zagallo ) , had a meltdown ( villa-boas ) or whatever bielsa is doing , so who would actually be a good replacement for the role of brazil 's manager ? 
  [ removed ], 
  i mean , the_defunctcampaign keeps posting about bill mitchell . 
  i already post one of his bull [ 1 ] ( https://www.np.reddit.com/r/the_meltdown/comments/5bwb96/sure_billy_whatever_you_say/ ) , someone already suggested his entire twitter feed [ 2 ] ( https://www.np.reddit.com/r/the_meltdown/comments/5bwea2/this_guys_whole_entire_twitter_feed_just_all_of_it/ ) and he now has barfed this salt gem [ 3 ] ( http://archive.is/08tew ) . 
  his salt will probably be a quater ( at least ) of this sub frontpage if left unchecked . 
  so , we 're currently passing through something most of us thought we would never see : a strike against the fmf , in this case from the refs . 
  the current drama started due to the incidents from [ pablo aguilar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d-h1l9fplo ) , [ ricardo pel\u00e1ez ] ( http://www.record.com.mx/futbol-futbol-nacional-liga-mx-america/pelaez-multado-con-150-mil-pesos-por-interceptar-arbitros ) , [ jes\u00fas david m\u00e9ndez , enrique luis triverio and alfredo talavera ] ( https://streamable.com/2zq7b ) , but the bad blood runs deeper than these games . 
  so let 's start from the time before their current employment status . 
  before this decade , refereeing in 1st division was one of the worst jobs . 
  not only were you forced to live on mexico city if you wanted to even have a career , the pay was shit , there was no health insurance , you were payed only if you worked that week , no bonus payments for anything ** and no retirement fund ** . 
  remember this last one , because it is going to be very important later on . 
  by 2009 a series of raises got their salaries per game to be around [ 14k pesos ] ( http://eleconomista.com.mx/deportes/2009/12/22/arbitros-mexicanos-bien-pagados ) , and more if you refereed a liguilla game . 
  by 2012 , they finally won the right to have a [ fixed salary of 20k pesos monthly ] ( https://deportes.terra.com.mx/futbol/liga-mx/arbitros-en-la-liga-mx-ganaran-desde-20-mil-pesos,97c3560bf71a8310vgnvcm20000099cceb0arcrd.html ) , along with the pay obtained per refereed game . 
  they also had finally won the right to live wherever they wanted , but they obtained a rise of 18k pesos per refereed game if they lived on mexico city . 
  the ability to have a salary also rubbed some veterans the wrong way , specially [ bonifacio n\u00fa\u00f1ez ] ( https://www.forbes.com.mx/el-dificil-aunque-bien-pagado-oficio-del-arbitraje/#gs.6k6aczs ), 
  unfortunately , 2012 was the same year that the league , liga mx , separated itself from the fmf . 
  this also required that every referee move from the fmf to ooidep s.c. 
  now , [ ooidep s.c. is an entity , with no social media presence nor a website , born from the arbitration board ] ( http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/mexico/noticias/2015/08/11/arbitros-no-son-empleados-de-la-fmf ) , whose purpose is to hire and book referees . 
  since all referees are not fmf employees , but work as associates , the fmf could decline or refuse any liability or responsibility ; including , but not limited to : health and life insurance , pay per diem expenses , booking injured referees and seniority claims . 
  this last one specially affects any attempts to create ** any ** retirement fund , since the lack of seniority not only lowers your salary ( [ 38k pesos per game to a 5-year senior referee ] ( http://www.sinembargo.mx/12-01-2017/3135482 ) vs 14k or 18k pesos per game ) , it also fucks with the algorithm that calculates the monthly pension , but only if you have saved before the 97 reform . 
  so where are the referees standing now ? 
  not only the lost all seniority , which lowers their salary and the money added to their retirement funds ( if they can even access it ) , their benefits are being cut , they work sometimes injured , [ their reports are being `` sanitized '' in favor of the player ] ( https://www.esto.com.mx/252057-desprotegidos-los-silbantes-tienen-silbato-pero-no-voto/ ) , players , [ managers ] ( http://laaficion.milenio.com/monterrey/rayados_de_monterrey-antonio_-turco-_mohamed-roberto_garcia_orozco_0_497950405.html ) and executives are harassing them during and after the game , and all their petitions are being turn away because they are not employees . 
  and today they just had enough when the arbitration board is refusing to follow the rules after certain altercations got physical by lowering the punishments . 
  they had no other route but to strike . 
  so , how long will this last ? 
  who knows . 
  will the players strike in solidarity and also to improve the clusterfuck that is their situation ? 
  hopefully . 
  will the fans shit on the refs ?
