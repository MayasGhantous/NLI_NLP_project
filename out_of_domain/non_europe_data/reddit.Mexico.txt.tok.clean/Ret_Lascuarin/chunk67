  ps : ~ ~ i have no idea how to make the icons work ~ ~ finally !, 
  ~ ~ draft is 7th and 8th of june ~ ~, 
  the draft is over , no more national transfers , but the foregin transfer windows are still open . 
  [ here is a list of them ] ( https://www.fifatms.com/itms/worldwide-transfer-windows-calendar/ ), 
  according david medrano 's column * el informe * the owners did n't reveal one of the most important changes accorded to the media , since they want to tell to the owners of ascenso teams before the newspaper . 
   the hierarchs decided that , starting the next season , the teams of liga de ascenso must be certified * ( to liga mx standards ) * before starting the season and those who do not reach said requirements wont be able to ascend in case they win the promotion playoff ... 
   in case the squad that wins said playoff is not certified , that team that has been relegated from liga mx will have the opportunity to pay said ammount of cash * ( refering to the money rewarded to those who fulfill the certifications , which apparently will be 10 million us dollars ) * and mantain the category . 
  what do you think of this ? 
  [ the league will reduce from 18 to 17 teams ] ( https://twitter.com/record_mexico/status/870001893036048384 ), 
  [ also , coras tepic exists now as atl\u00e9tico zacatepec ] ( https://twitter.com/record_mexico/status/870001971314294785 ), 
  not long ago i made a post about [ a new measure where some teams can not be promoted , even if they won the playoff ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6cvm2m/recent_changes_to_the_promotion_and_relegations/ ) , according to luis castillo , journalist of tvc and record , [ this are the teams not certified to promote ] ( https://twitter.com/mluiscastillo/status/870009274092605441 ) and [ this ones are n't . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/mluiscastillo/status/870007612103770112 ), 
  as for what constitutes certified , rumor is that the line is draw at 20k , but not official confirmation right now . 
  also , the economic prize will no longer be given to all the clubs , just the one that wins and is not certified to be promoted . 
  teams have been given 45 days to expand their stadiums ( jajajaja , oh fmf , you truly are the mcmahon of this league ) . 
  atl\u00e9tico san luis is active , ~ ~ waiting confirmation from official sources . ~ ~ [ source ] ( http://www.ascensomx.net/cancha/detallenoticia/20915/asamblea-ordinaria-de-ascenso-bancomer-mx ), 
  atlante and chiapas have to pay their debts before the 6th of june . 
  ~ ~ coyotes de tlacxala are out until further notice . ~ ~ [ not entirely wrong , official source states that coyotes have the next two seasons to expand their stadium to ascenso mx 's standards , but they can not participate for the moment .

  as for why is this a text post , i have no idea , but reddit seems to think this is the same post than the one of the veracruz - tigres match . 
  reactions :, 
  inge - [ pissed ] ( https://twitter.com/record_mexico/status/872659109132349441 ), 
  kuri - [ also pissed ] ( https://twitter.com/record_mexico/status/872674000299864064 ), 
  so a little backstory :, 
  jaguares de chiapas is , or rather was , a football team of the liga mx ( first division ) that was founded on 2002 and was known for their good scouting of foreginer , mostly southamerican , players , most of them would become highly sought during the draft period : caba\u00f1as , luis gabriel rey , danilinho , jackson martinez , silvio romero , itamar batista and many other . 
  they were also known , from the very start , of being a clusterfuck as an organization . 
  they were always part of the state of chiapas , sort of , they fork cash and made desicions , but there was always someone else acting as a president , as well as forking most of the cash . 
  they changed hands in 2010 , sold to grupo salinas . 
  then it was sold and changed to gallos de queretaro on a serie of clusterfucks that deserves their own post , but it will be way too long . 
  the tl ; dr is a bunch of old fucks make a bunch of shady horseshit so queretaro stays in liga mx , instead of ascenso mx ( they were relegated ) , and the franchise started anew with carlos hugo l\u00f3pez chargoy as `` owner '' ( the state of chiapas still had power over it ) . 
  now , they were always the team that onwed money to someone , somtimes the players , sometimes the kit makers , sometimes the staff , but mostly one or two months of salary were owed . 
  with chargoy ? 
  it was ** every ** ** season ** . 
  there was no season where they did n't owed the players , from their salaries to their bonuses . 
  and every season was the same thing , the fmf pressured chiapas to get the money , chiapas sold a highly sought player that was scouted , fmf forked the rest so that the players could at least be payed their salaries ( not so much the bonuses ) . 
  ** every fucking season **, 
  so this season starts with chiapas beign relegated , they apparently tried to buy lobos buap but they knew their clusterfuck and rejected any offer from chargoy . 
  not only that , the fmf gets fed up and tells chiapas that they must pay their players before the draft if they want to participate on it . 
  they also up the fee to puebla ( chargoy 's other team ) , from 5 million to ** 10 million ** , for the right to particiapate in the league . 
  so draft day arrives and oh , look , chiapas still owes money and so does puebla , so they ca n't participate in it . 
  but then , like every season , [ chargoy arrives with mark henry 's suit and a paper that demonstrates that said debts where paid . 
  ] ( http://www.record.com.mx/futbol-futbol-nacional-liga-mx-jaguares/chargoy-asegura-que-ya-se-saldaron-adeudos-en-jaguares ) therefore they could participate both on the liga mx draft and the ascenso mx draft . 
  the draft continues with their usual stuff , people being sold , loaned , ignored . 
  same shit , different day . 
  except ... puebla 's sheet is clean , zero , no loans , no buys , nothing . 
  the highly publicised transfer of moi mu\u00f1oz to puebla was nowhere to be seen .
