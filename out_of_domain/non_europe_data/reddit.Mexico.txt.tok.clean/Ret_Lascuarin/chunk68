  then two things come to my attention . 
  first is the fact that [ c.p. 
  \u00c1lvaro flores cid de le\u00f3n has parted ways with chiapas a day before the draft ] ( https://twitter.com/chiapas_fc/status/872126899904020484 ) nothing mayor , unless you know the fact that he is chargoy 's right hand man , and the one that helps stabilizing , or massaging , the books . 
  second of all are the reports that both [ chiapas and puebla can not buy or take loaned players because they have n't actually paid their debts ] ( https://twitter.com/espnsutcliffe/status/872636966290030593 ) they could set players aside , but they could n't register them . 
  not only that , becuase the draft only happens during one day , they could finish with no national transfer . 
  and then , at 11:55 p.m. , they send [ this tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/clubpueblamx/status/872678561135697920 ) and then an bunch of players are loaned , bought , sold , or their loans are just not renewed . 
  but during this onslaught , new information appears . 
  according to [ rene tovar , general editor of espnmx and founder of record , chargoy negotiated to get puebla the ability to transfer , which was blocked due to chiapas debts . 
  if said debts were not paid , chiapas will be desaffiliated from the league ] ( https://twitter.com/rene_tovar/status/872683519956443140 ), 
  nothing else comes until a few minutes later , when david medrano , a journalist from record , annuonces that [ chiapas has actually been desaffiliated from the league ] ( https://twitter.com/medranoazteca/status/872690872835612672 ) , later also confirmed by the [ president of atlas ] ( https://twitter.com/capsnarrador/status/872699662607593473 ) . 
  the players , now unemployed but with no freedom , start texting to chargoy about their current situation , [ he just blocks them ] ( https://twitter.com/carlos_ponz/status/872695284912074752 ) . 
  [ chiapa 's website disappeared ] ( http://www.record.com.mx/futbol-futbol-nacional-liga-mx-jaguares/jaguares-queda-desafiliado-por-adeudos ) , [ the fmf deletes any player of jaguares from their page ] ( http://archive.is/q1sdc ), 
  today is the draft of ascenso mx ( 2nd division ) , most of the players will be sold today on an unprecedented fire sale , [ chargoy is declaring himself bankrupt from a 72 million of pesos debt ] ( http://www.record.com.mx/futbol-futbol-nacional-liga-mx-jaguares/jaguares-se-declarara-en-bancarrota-para-no-pagar-adeudos ) , ascenso mx will only have 16 teams insted of 18 ( tlaxcala has a year to remodel their stadium ) . 
  the players will only have cents on the peso of their salary , if they even get any . 
  what a fucking day . 
  right now i was starting to update the [ apertura 2017 transfer thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6aozli/apertura_2017_transfer_thread/ ) from the ascenso mx draft . 
  and during the recollection of information , i found something off . 
  see , one of the many players that were being search for during chiapas ' downfall was mateus gon\u00e7alves , specially by toluca . 
  so i pop up toluca 's twitter and there it is , the tweet that confirms the transfer . 
  not big deal , except ... it was n't from chiapas to toluca . 
  i search some more and discover that , according to transfermarket , [ mateus is a player loaned to chiapas by pachuca ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/mateus/profil/spieler/352890 ) . 
  not uncommon , chiapas , veracruz and puebla survive through loans of young prospects or unwanted veterans , but it was n't also not registered as a pachuca - toluca transfer , it 's registered as a zacatepec - toluca transfer by [ toluca ] ( https://twitter.com/tolucafc/status/872965287376822272 ) and [ fmf ] ( https://twitter.com/ligabancomermx/status/872965050386010113 ) . 
  same last name and in the fmf tweet it has a picture of him as a chiapas player . 
  not only that , but zacatepec was never a team under the umbrella of grupo pachuca . 
  in fact , the original team folded and the new team , who apparently negotiated this transaction , is part of chivas , or simply owned by higuera . 
  so right now , a player apparently owned by pachuca , was sold to toluca , by a team with less than a month of existance , and there is no official confirmation by both the league nor any of the teams not mentioned on the official transaction ( zacatepec - toluca ) . 
  if anyone has any confirmation of this series of transactions , please let me know . 
  for the moment it will appear as mateus gon\u00e7alves ( zacatepec \u00bf ? 
  while looking into more transfers ( a few more have been officialized ) i found more about the fates of some players of the defunct ( or freezed , depends on who you 're asking ) chiapas . 
  for those who do n't remember who played in chiapas , [ here is the wikipedia page before the draft ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=chiapas_f%c3%batbol_club&diff=99650432&oldid=99586758 ), 
  [ source one ] ( http://www.espn.com.mx/futbol/mexico/nota/_/id/3316480/casi-20-jugadores-desempleados-tras-el-descenso-de-chiapas ) states that 17 players are unemployed : one of them is still injured ( guillermo rodriguez ) , one had no minutes due to injury ( franco flores ) , 2 were n't even employed at the time of chiapas ' relegation ( * paleta * esqueda , william paredes ) , but their futures fall under chargoy 's hands due to * el pacto de caballeros * , and only one is reported as a loaned player ( lucas silva ) , leaving 10 who are still unemployed . 
  if we were to contrast the first source 's table with this list , then the only players that are both unemployed and part of the team are jonathan fabbro and jorge villalpando ( bryan angulo is loaned by ludogorets , ** bulgaria ** and diego ferreira matheus by botafogo , ** brazil ** , while diego de la torre is now loaned to cafetaleros de tapachula ), 
  [ source three ] ( http://www.sopitas.com/761445-jaguares-chiapas-jugadores-desempleados-draft-2017/ ) goes deeper , stating that while most of the foregin players are loaned , only 5 ( lucas silva , vanderlei derley , marcelo estigarribia and juan pati\u00f1o , the author forgets that [ w\u00edlder guisao is loaned by toluca ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/wilder-guisao/profil/spieler/232914 ) ) will actually return to their respective teams , the rest of them are still loaned , and therefore have two options ( as stated by the source ) : they either look for a job in the foregin markets with help of their clubs , or they wait until the loan expires while cashing checks from jaguares . 
  [ unless said institution declares bankruptcy . ] ( http://www.record.com.mx/futbol-futbol-nacional-liga-mx-jaguares/jaguares-se-declarara-en-bancarrota-para-no-pagar-adeudos ) . 
  since * paleta * is not part of the institution ( somehow [ william was separated ] ( http://www.excelsior.com.mx/adrenalina/2017/04/05/1156050 ) , [ but not officially cut ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/william-paredes/profil/spieler/53593 ) ) , he simply is unemployed with no paycheck to cash . 
  now , the two player left are jorge villalpando and jonathan fabbro . 
  and both cases are also clusterfucks . 
  jorge villalpando does n't even play professional football anymore , [ he starting playing futsal since december of 2016 ] ( http://www.espn.com.mx/futbol/mexico/nota/_/id/2878865/jorge-villalpando-de-primera-division-al-futsal ) . 
  not only that , [ his last professional game was at clausura 2016 , a year ago , and his only role in the institution was with chiapas ' academy . 
  ] ( http://ligamx.net/cancha/jugador/32172/jorge-villalpando-romo ) even then , his future falls under chargoy as if he was a professional player . 
  no idea how that happened . 
  jonathan fabbro is a whole different case to everyone else . 
  according to source three , his contract has expired this year , but i have yet to confirm this . 
  however , if said thing is true , then he could have negotiated as a free agent , but the draft has passed , so no team can regiter any player from the national market . 
  he could theoretically go to the player 's commission and argue about the disaffiliation of his team as a reason to obtain the ability to negotiate with other teams , but that seems unlikely . 
  not because of said commission giving him the permission , but because he is currently undergoing an accusation of [ having a bastard in paraguay ] ( http://www.epa.com.py/2017/05/27/joven-demanda-a-fabbro-asegurando-que-es-el-padre-de-su-hijo/ ) and of [ raping a 9 year old girl in argentina ] ( http://laaficion.milenio.com/futbol/jonathan_fabbro-violacion_menor-jaguares_chiapas-argentina-milenio-la_aficion_0_953304972.html ) , and no team wants to get into an incoming shitstorm . 
  unless it 's cruz azul , they sign anything that does n't work for them . 
  edit : further developments , [ source 4 ] ( http://www.record.com.mx/futbol-futbol-nacional-liga-mx-jaguares/jugadores-de-chiapas-tendran-prorroga-para-negociar-con ) states that the player 's commission has extended the deadline from june 8 ^ th to september 4 ^ th to the players that are still unemployed .
