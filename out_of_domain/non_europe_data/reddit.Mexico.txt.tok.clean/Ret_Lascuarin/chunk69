  ] ( http://laaficion.milenio.com/futbolinternacional/david_izazola-adapta-hungria-pumas-budapest_honved-unam-puskas_0_469753267.html ) ) that same draft was the same where the then new 10/8 rule ( where any team can bring up to 10 foregin players ) was implemented ( said rule is now defunct and replaced with the 9/9 rule ) . 
  as a way to protest said rule , izazola decided to [ retire from football ] ( https://twitter.com/david_izazola/status/743512368051740672 ) and concentrate on his [ then recently opened digital marketing firm , merkatus ] ( https://www.publimetro.com.mx/mx/futbol-nacional/2016/06/17/entrevista-futbol-mexicano-hecho-que-te-calles-izazola.html ) , [ which he founded . 
  ] ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-izazola-5444a9ab/ ) six months later , he signed with [ comunicaciones of guatemala ] ( https://twitter.com/david_izazola/status/812310218231185408 ) , a team owned by a [ guy accused , along his wife , of particiapting on a corruption scandal in guatemala as well as having off shore companies with mossack fonseca ] ( http://www.proceso.com.mx/443136/magnate-mexicano-medios-vinculado-red-corrupcion-en-guatemala ) . 
  [ he had a good season ] ( https://www.futboltotal.com.mx/2017/03/mexicano-david-izazola-lucha-titulo-goleo-en-guatemala/ ) and recently [ quit the team , looking for new opportunities elsewhere ] ( http://www.goal.com/es-mx/news/14562/guatemala/2017/06/02/36054972/izazola-queda-fuera-de-comunicaciones ), 
  so recently there was [ this question in the daily discussion post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6jzvmm/daily_discussion_20170628/dji7zjz/?context=3 ) and i simply answered with delrot , since it was apparently 8.5 million euros or 10 million dollars , depending on who you ask . 
  i decided to go with transfermarket numbers , because it 's the easier to obtain the data . 
  and right now i 'm bored so i thought `` let 's check tigres transfers since 2000 '' and , by the way , fuck sinergia for our record transfer . 
  i ca n't believe it 's way more than triple than what we paid for gaitan , holy shit !, 
  so , i decide to check it , and let 's be honest , a lot of numbers do n't appear because fmf is as transparent as a solid wall of lead , so we are talking about estimates and third party data . 
  first of all , there is absolute nothing relevant on prices until 2003 , the year we paid like 4 million euros for gaitan ( came on 2002 as a loan , then tigres activated the buy-out clause ) . 
  and then there is nothin , for a while , complete lack of info . 
  on a quick note , fuck husain and [ his remarks about the national team ] ( http://www.futbolsapiens.com/actualidad-futbol-mexicano/ex-jugador-argentino-de-tigres-critico-a-la-seleccion-mexicana/ ) . 
  and then we reach the trejo era and fuck everything that happen for a while , it was shit . 
  at some point * conejo * perez was the best player on the team ( arrived as a loan ) . 
  * chamagol * , star of his own shit radio show , arrived [ free ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/sebastian-gonzalez/transfers/spieler/28168/transfer_id/132548 ) and stayed for a year , then another two on loans . 
  and after all that time , free was ** too fucking expensive . 
  ** no info on zarate though , dog shit for us and scored a phantom goal with rayados . 
  marino , the one who was only good on fifa 07 , arrived as a loan , [ with a front payment of 2 million euros , ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/guillermo-marino/transfers/spieler/26465/transfer_id/134844 ) and was unexistant and insulting to pay the double of his market value for just a loan . 
  ** a loan **, 
  nothing about saritama , however restrepo 's transfer to cruz azul was linked to [ a drug lord . 
  ] ( http://archivo.eluniversal.com.mx/primera/30448.html ) cruz azul apparently paid 1.8 million dollars , 400k never reach the colombian team . 
  then the fucker of * la gata * appears , market value was 5 million , signed 3 years , lasted a season , left to estudiantes , won the libertadores , then return , then left during superliga and [ created a clusterfuck . 
  ] ( http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/mexico/noticias/2012/01/28/gaston-la-gata-fernandez-le-gana-caso-a-tigres-y-queda-sin-castigo ) btw , nice precedent you left there , a player leaving the team with a year remaining in his contract , that would never repeat , right guys ? 
  oh , wait , it did , then they also lasted two years to give the reason to tigres . 
  we also paid 3.5 million dollars for the fucker , fuck . 
  i want to punch him in the gut . 
  he also did the same to timbers in the mls , big fucking surprise . 
  on a good note , around that time we bought lobos for [ 2 million euros ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/lucas-lobos/transfers/spieler/30787/transfer_id/163321 ) , too cheap for what we obtained from him as a player . 
  on a weird note , cerda played in [ peru ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/emmanuel-cerda/transfers/spieler/53746/transfer_id/343498 ) . 
  still went nowhere , like always . 
  then it was a stream of great buys : [ damian for less than 4 million euros ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/damian-alvarez/transfers/spieler/52588/transfer_id/423587 ) , [ 3 and a half for danilinho ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/danilinho/transfers/spieler/45709/transfer_id/509754 ) , [ 3 million for mancilla ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/hector-mancilla/transfers/spieler/44920/transfer_id/505152 ) , [ more than 1.2 for juninho ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/juninho/transfers/spieler/52697/transfer_id/430662 ) , [ guido for another 3 ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/guido-pizarro/transfers/spieler/105899/transfer_id/904689 ) , [ 3.3 for sobis ( i still miss him ) ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/rafael-sobis/transfers/spieler/27376/transfer_id/1164611 ) , [ 2.2 for nahuel ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/nahuel-guzman/transfers/spieler/87859/transfer_id/1104800 ) , [ 5 for lucas ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/lucas-zelarayan/transfers/spieler/230030/transfer_id/1391108 ) , [ another 5 for aquino ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/javier-aquino/transfers/spieler/111082/transfer_id/1266267 ) . 
  and yeah , we also brought mediocrity , like luis garcia [ ( fortunetly as a loan ) ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/luis-garcia/transfers/spieler/8006/transfer_id/744168 ) , burbano who sacrificed himself for the team in the final against america , and [ 4 million euros for some player that was n't even a benchwarmer ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/everton/transfers/spieler/76120/transfer_id/375625 ) . 
  also * tito * villa , not worth it , even without knowing the price . 
  and if you wonder why i am ranting , it 's because i 'm mad . 
  not for * la gata * , even if he will forever be la misma revolcada de siempre , but for another thing . 
  the original post was going to be `` hey , i saw this on daily discussion and found out that our three most expensive transfers where [ sosa for 7 million euros ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/ismael-sosa/transfers/spieler/45327/transfer_id/1500663 ) , [ delort for 8 million euros ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/andy-delort/transfers/spieler/122797/transfer_id/1590187 ) , and [ damm for 8.85 million euros ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/jurgen-damm/transfers/spieler/221735/transfer_id/1258423 ) , who are your teams record transfers ?

  this is the third time i write about jaguares , now defunct , there been a lot of developments . 
  most of them where revealed by record , but those pieces are now behind a paywall so first , a quick recap on all of that before talking about the current status of certain players . 
  the day before the draft , the right hand of chargoy , the owner of jaguares and puebla , parted ways with the organization [ ( here is a summary of what happened during the draft ) ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6g24tw/yesterday_was_the_liga_mx_draft_and_also_the_last/ ) however , weeks after the draft , r\u00e9cord brings to the light the fact that chargoy did n't just owned money to the players , but also to employees of the organization , from the food stand all the way to administrators , as well as people from the filials and academies . 
  some of them were owned money since the start of clausura 2017 ( said season started in ** january ** ) . 
  francotirador , a columnist from r\u00e9cord , reported that when confronted about this , chargoy mentioned that the accountant ( the same one that parted ways before the draft happened ) had the money , but since he was on vacation , there was nothing he could do . 
  anyway , fmf decided , on a moment of compassion , to foot the bill . 
  according to francotirador , the fmf decided to pay only the salaries ( the bonuses wont be paid ) . 
  on the 21 ^ ^ st of june , [ the fmf declared jaguares as officially desafilliated ] ( http://www.ligabancomer.mx/cancha/detallenoticia/21016 ), 
  however , there is also the case of what to do with the players , [ here is the post about it from the 13 ^ ^ th of june ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6gxfr4/on_the_current_status_of_chiapas_the_dead/ ), 
  right now , according to [ nvinoticias ] ( http://www.nvinoticias.com/nota/62668/desempleados-de-jaguares-con-pocas-opciones ) , the players still looking for a job are :, 
  * leonardo buri\u00e1n : only wanderers and pe\u00f1arol are rumored to be looking for his signature , none of those rumors appear to be factual . 
  * luis mi\u00f1o signed with nacional in ** paraguay **,
