  my mom remember her tears from that game against tunisia . 
  also , for the mexican perspective about that game , check interviews with leonardo cuellar , one of the players of that game . 
  there is also this story about the 6-0 against west germany . 
  pilar , one of the best goalkeepers in tigres and part of the squad that dominated the national league in the lat 70s , suffered an injury when they were 3-0 , so he is substituted . 
  after the game , he asked the substitute for the final score . 
  the substitute answered `` we got a draw . '', 
  `` really ? '', 
  asked pilar , and the substitute said `` yes , you ate three and i ate another three . 
  see ? 
  a draw ! '', 
  ... god , we were the latin america version of scotland . 
  dunno man , we just made a goal and a ball and kicked it . 
  oh , fuck you . 
  i enter reddit from a cyber cafe and now you want me to pay for a subscription ? 
  not everyone has the luxury of a stable income . 
   we were, 
  past tense mate :d, 
  leonardo cuellar actually said on an interview that they here convinced that they should be winning by more than four goals , so they relaxed the lines to go to the offense and ended up eating 3, 
   ( `` storm freed the homeland . 
  a storm from the stands will free croatian football - veterans of the patriotic war and friends '' ), 
  man , i do n't know . 
  maybe because they are asking to ** clean ** the league from ** undisreable elements ** with a ** storm ** . 
  i mean , sure , you may be in favor , but the uefa prefer to keep everything in a peaceful , lets-not-go-back-to-the-balkans-war-era way, 
  that ... is bizarre ... i mean ... he will not play for the doping case in the second leg game , but he played the first which is before the first leg ... you know , when this happened here at mexico , we threw cruz azul out of the liguilla , and we are the corrupt ones, 
   why would the same organisation allow partizan belgrade to start their match with a minute of silence for the serb victims of a war they started and were the aggressors in ? 
  okay , that was not on the context of your post . 
  still , understand that the uefa is seeing it from a standpoint of an outsider , and as an outsider we see elements that people that live inside ignore . 
  like , for example , the banner sounding similar as any fascits banner against africans on european leagues . 
  as for the minute of silence , its a sign of remembrance of series of events that provoked an inmense amount of death . 
  as for the ayax thing , they are just trying to play things down . 
  i do n't like it , either . 
  garrincha and maradona , specially for the parties . 
  is there a version that it is not dubbed on arab ? 
  thanks mate, 
  tv and newspaper , did n't have internet until highschool . 
  what were you expecting ? 
  the barras bravas of argentina are as bad as the hooligans of england back in the 90s, 
  that shit is already there mate , they also attack the players on the field . 
  oh , harsh, 
  look mate , there is the current joke that both rayados and tigres are the 6 month therapy for any player , since they are shite there ( tito villa , for example ) , and they suddenly become stars when sold . 
  for tigres , going back to those dark ages of jose luis trejo et al. 
  there are a lot of similarities between the signings, 
  * chamagol ( striker ) , zarate ( ex-player of real madrid ) and marino ( later , from boca jrs . ), 
  vs gignac ( striker ) , uche ( ** still injured ** ) , damm ( promising midfilder ) and aquino ( ex-player of rayo vallecano ) . 
  and the fact that rayados had one of the best managers in mexican football, 
  * vucetich vs turco mohammed, 
  i still remember those times , losing almost every game , barely going to liguilla , manager after manager , rayados winning title after title with their recently brought humberto suazo , who i knew him from his time with the colo colo of matias fernandez ... 
  the horror , that 's what i fear, 
  [ every single goal of this game ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewfnwcq3fxs ) the second leg game starts at 3:31 , but i recomend seing everything just to see how hopeless our case was . 
  fox sports here at mexico , maybe on tarjeta roja, 
  copa libertadores , both the quality of the squads and the importance of the match are above that of ccl, 
  unless your a fan of any team at the ccl match , then see your team and look later for highlights, 
  they did n't stole the cup , you just suck the whole game, 
  he is an americanista , `` twat '' and `` cunt '' are in its nature, 
  america no ha llegado ni a la final , asi estare aun que perdamos ... 
  local cup group game , apparently, 
  i doubt they will do that ... 
  check radio , 1690 am from monterrey its good, 
  ** for an own goal !, 
  sorry , my mistake, 
  shh , man . 
  they do not consider mexico as part of south america . 
  apparently , we are too near to usa to be part of their club . 
  people are more scared of weird shenanigans , which are common in games where mexican teams are against big teams from south america, 
  wait , andre-pierre gignac has an active account in reddit ? 
  [ ( checking account ) ] ( http://cdn.alltheragefaces.com/img/faces/large/cereal-guy-cereal-guy-squint-l.png ),

  ] ( http://wallpaper.ultradownloads.com.br/276162_papel-de-parede-meme-cereal-guy-cuspindo_1920x1440.jpg ) / u/gignac its gignac ! ~ ~, 
  nevermind , carry on, 
  shit , thanks, 
  injuries , been like that since he came from villareal, 
  go fuck yourself with a big rake on fire , and on the way , please , tell peleaz to go fuck himself too, 
  he should be , but who knows ... 
  tuca , he will, 
  river brought back saviola ... 
  shite , but we do n't lose every final since 97, 
  garrincha 's play style derivates from his physical disability , which made one of his legs bigger than the other, 
  also , barbosa was back in the 40s one of the best goalkeepers in brazil and the first black goalkeeper in the brazilian national team, 
  holy shit !, 
  did n't know that !, 
  its a song by manu chao , and also a common day at almost every city at the boarder, 
  inception, 
  it would be between gaitan , barbadillo and pilar, 
  did n't knew about the his dreamcast past, 
  wait , santa claus ? 
  were they drunk during the registering of the team ? 
  el divino gaitan at tigres , man . 
  also , i am from monterrey . 
  ... with pavel pardo , ricardo osorio and cacau , right ? 
  hey , its those-that-were-big-in-the-90s , how is it going ? 
  mate , number 18 hurts, 
  also , no jimmy glass ? 
  sorry mate , only knew of that one, 
  everyone hates chiquidracula , he threw red and yellows like they were on a fire sale . 
  at least he restricted himself , on a monterrey team he ended up making rayados lost like 5 players due to red cards and accumulation of yellows, 
  i remember one making his son pee on a cup in the middle of the game , just so he would n't leave his spot, 
  do tell , mr. / u/holdenwait, 
  ... it looks like a bad facebook game, 
  really ? 
  they were going so well !,
