  this is the third time i write about jaguares , now defunct , there been a lot of developments . 
  most of them where revealed by record , but those pieces are now behind a paywall so first , a quick recap on all of that before talking about the current status of certain players . 
  the day before the draft , the right hand of chargoy , the owner of jaguares and puebla , parted ways with the organization [ ( here is a summary of what happened during the draft ) ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6g24tw/yesterday_was_the_liga_mx_draft_and_also_the_last/ ) however , weeks after the draft , r\u00e9cord brings to the light the fact that chargoy did n't just owned money to the players , but also to employees of the organization , from the food stand all the way to administrators , as well as people from the filials and academies . 
  some of them were owned money since the start of clausura 2017 ( said season started in ** january ** ) . 
  francotirador , a columnist from r\u00e9cord , reported that when confronted about this , chargoy mentioned that the accountant ( the same one that parted ways before the draft happened ) had the money , but since he was on vacation , there was nothing he could do . 
  anyway , fmf decided , on a moment of compassion , to foot the bill . 
  according to francotirador , the fmf decided to pay only the salaries ( the bonuses wont be paid ) . 
  on the 21 ^ ^ st of june , [ the fmf declared jaguares as officially desafilliated ] ( http://www.ligabancomer.mx/cancha/detallenoticia/21016 ), 
  however , there is also the case of what to do with the players , [ here is the post about it from the 13 ^ ^ th of june ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6gxfr4/on_the_current_status_of_chiapas_the_dead/ ), 
  right now , according to [ nvinoticias ] ( http://www.nvinoticias.com/nota/62668/desempleados-de-jaguares-con-pocas-opciones ) , the players still looking for a job are :, 
  * leonardo buri\u00e1n : only wanderers and pe\u00f1arol are rumored to be looking for his signature , none of those rumors appear to be factual . 
  * luis mi\u00f1o signed with nacional in ** paraguay **, 
  * juan pati\u00f1o just signed with racing , though he was only in jaguares as a loan , racing bought him from guaran\u00ed,

  since i am currently still working in the [ apertura 2017 transfer thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6aozli/apertura_2017_transfer_thread/ ) , i have some rumors aggregators on my tabs , one of those reported on gargano accusing turco of acting as an agent while being manager . 
  [ here is the interview of gargano ] ( http://twitter.sport890.com.uy/0703gargano.mp3 ), 
  to summarize :, 
   gargano currently wants to both leave and stay, 
   he wants to leave due to * turco * mohamed, 
    gargano mentions that `` some managers officiate as agents , and later they run with the entire cake '' , almost inmediatly he mentions that mohamed got pissed with him for not acting accordingly . 
    gargano specifies that mohamed tried to divert some money from his salary to himself . 
    he also points to the * pacto de caballeros * as a tool that is being used against him , sending his to either an affiliate team or the sub20 team ( he mentions it as a as `` lower than third division '' ) alongside cardona , himself and a third player ( probably alexander dom\u00ednguez ) . 
  he will also ca n't go to any other team , even if the current plan from rayados is to not even register him . 
   he wants to stay not only because of the city , but also to give his children some stability ( his wife is currently pregnant with their third child ), 
    he also always looks for contracts of 2 or 3 years to atleast give them the semblance of stablity, 
  mohamed and davino 's ( current acting president of rayados ) current response summarize in four points :, 
   ** fake news **, 
   ** shut up **, 
   ** apologize **, 
  cardona refused to comment on the matter between gargano and mohamed , but sides with gargano when talking about the money .

  we need to have a hard look over the current state of affairs of fmf , as well as making the most noise both to them and to the recently formed asociaci\u00f3n de futbolistas mexicanos a.c. , the second attempt to create a union .
