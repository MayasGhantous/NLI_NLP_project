  however , this transfer was recently revealed to be completly different . 
  according to an [ instagram post of crivelli ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bwgjvzeflu8/?taken-by=fede_crivelli ) , the transfer was chiapas buying his card from temperley in an attempt from temperley to aquire fonds to pay their own debts ( some argentinian teams are also facing debt problems on the same scale of chiapas ) . 
  temperley sought him , but later refused to offer him a contract . 
  they also started to accusing him of destroying chiapas and messing the finance 's of temperley . 
  crivelli had no clue of what was happening , until he read the contract and found out that they lied him in the negotiations . 
  temperley and chiapas added a clause that , in case that chiapas could n't pay his clause or crivelli rescinded said contract before chiapas paid it , crivelli would pay the rest of it . 
  fifa had to step in and pretty much invalidate said clause , while the fmf is working in liberating his card so he could look for a job as a free agent . 
  ( an actual free agent ) he wants to return to temperley to play his game 300 with them , but he will probably go to godoy cruz , who is seeking his services .
