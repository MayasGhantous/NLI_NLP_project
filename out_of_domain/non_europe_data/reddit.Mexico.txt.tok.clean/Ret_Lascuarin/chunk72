  edelmiro * titino * elizalde is 28 years old defender and his curriculum vitae reads like a cementery . 
  he apparently debuted with zorros de reynosa of segunda divisi\u00f3n against millonarios de la joya in week 12 of second division 's apertura 2007 , where he only played 1 minute . 
  both of those teams are defunct , their last tournament was bicentenario 2010 . 
  he later played against club de futbol indios , but only as a sub for the second half time , that team died after apertura 2011 . 
  his first starting xi game was against estudiantes de altamira , but was subbed at the 81 ^ ^ st minute . 
  that team was transfered from tamaulipas to chiapas and became cafetaleros de tapachula , another one on the `` death '' pile . 
  his first 90 minutes came against huracanes de matamoros . 
  and if you have n't guessed it , that team is also death . 
  [ only lasted two seasons . 
  the more i dig , the more i wonder if any of the teams of liga premier is even financial susteinable . 
  of the 18 teams of second division 's apertura 2008 ( where he played 16 games out of 17 ) , only 2 are still active ( uac and loros de colima ) .
