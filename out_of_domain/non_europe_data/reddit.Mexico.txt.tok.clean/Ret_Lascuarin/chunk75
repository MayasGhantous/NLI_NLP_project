  ] ( http://eleconomista.com.mx/deportes/2012/04/26/nacer-global-ficha-san-luis-us40-millones ) he sold it [ the next season to chargoy ] ( http://eleconomista.com.mx/deportes/2012/11/13/nacer-global-vende-100-club-san-luis ) , the same one that took the team to chiapas the very next season . 
  why ? 
  nacer may had absolutely no knowledge of the world of football , but he did knew a lot of business . 
  [ according to ignacio su\u00e1rez , he only paid 5 million dollars in cash , ] ( http://archive.is/f0dtn ) which looks promising from outside , but found out that the 35 million would be obtained from the payment usually obtained through tv deals . 
  televisa was the only one that had the right to broadcast any san luis games , and nacer would n't obtain even a cent from the `` deal '' . 
  he clearly understood that there was no future , since the team was shit ** ( content ) ** , the finances fell completely on him and what they obtained from matchday ** ( finances ) ** , and he could n't negotiate with anyone since they were stuck with an auto-renewable , non-negotiable tv deal with televisa ** ( distribution ) ** . 
  so why did chargoy bought such a toxic deal ? 
  every team has some sort of relation with their state , sometimes it 's closer than expected or shown to the public . 
  puebla is one of those teams , and the previous owner ricardo henaine had , at the time , a tense relation with the then governor rafael moreno valle . 
  the details of said does n't matter , what does matter is the fact that henaine was looking to move the team to greener pastures . 
  chargoy , at that time a minority owner of the club , saw his childhood team edging closer to leaving the state and planned a way to keep it , with or without henaine 's approval . 
  he decided to start negotiations with an old business partner , jorge nacer gobera . 
  nacer , seeing light at the end of the tunnel , took the opportunity and got rid of the liability that was san luis . 
  the plan was simple , henaine would eventually take the team to another state and chargoy would bring san luis to puebla , effectively keeping football in puebla . 
  imagine his surprise when henaine decides to simply sell the team , instead of moving . 
  at the end he reached an agreement with the then owner and obtained full ownership of the club . 
  what should have been a joyous occasion resulted into he and his family incurring into bad debt . 
  according to [ jos\u00e9 hanan ] ( http://intoleranciadiario.com/detalleopinion/6344/en-linea-deportiva/una-historia-para-recordar ) , chargoy 's current problems can be traced to this series of transactions . 
  he only planned to obtain one team , not two . 
  when san luis was send to chiapas it was n't because chargoy loved chiapas or hated san luis , but because he had a good relationship with then governor of chiapas , manuel velasco . 
  this was something he began to look immediately , since both puebla and san luis owned their respective tv network around 7 years of free tv ** each ** ** ( distribution ) ** . 
  but when the well dried up , he depended on players sales . 
  a string of bad transfer windows ** ( product ) ** and a bunch of other problems , most of them related to the lack of financial resources ** ( finances ) ** , resulted in [ the death of chiapas ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6g24tw/yesterday_was_the_liga_mx_draft_and_also_the_last/ ), 
  # ** but what about lobos ? 
  it 's a common rumor that chargoy tried to buy lobos buap after they won their promotion to liga mx , both to keep chiapas in first division and to monopolize the resources from the state of puebla ( lobos buap is tied to the benem\u00e9rita universidad aut\u00f3noma de puebla , a public university ) . 
  while it 's clearly that said negotiations failed , since lobos just played their first game and puebla is borrowing even more from tv azteca , there must have been talks about the ** distribution ** of the ** product ** . 
  and that probably made them check their own contract with tdn ( who broadcasted their games in ascenso mx ) , whose parent company is televisa . 
  according to su\u00e1rez , they offered them 75 million pesos per season for the rights of broadcasting . 
  not a bad deal , unless you actually start to investigate the actual value of the ** product ** . 
  see , leones negros ( leones negros de la universidad de guadalajara ) sold their own rights in liga mx not to televisa , but to espn for [ 7 million dollars ] ( http://laaficion.milenio.com/udeg/leones-negros-vendio-derechos-tv_0_341365915.html ) , which is still more than what half of the teams in liga mx get from their deals . 
  however , su\u00e1rez reveals that the end of leones negros stay in first division , that amount totaled 18 million dollars for a year of broadcast . 
  lobos buap , who is on the same position than them , is being offered 8.2 million dollars ( tc : 17.90 , 4.1 million per season ) for the same amount of time . 
  the more they began to read their own contract , the less enticing it became . 
  which brings us to the current bidders for lobos buap tv rights . 
  tdn and espn . 
  espn apparently offered 20 million dolllars for a 4 year contract . 
  if said 20 million is per year , then than means that they 're being offered 10 million per season . 
  [ which is more than a lot of the teams in the league ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/anexo:derechos_de_transmisi%c3%b3n_por_tv_de_la_primera_divisi%c3%b3n_de_m%c3%a9xico#tabla_de_derechos_y_trasmisiones_en_m.c3.a9xico ), 
  tdn , on the scummy side , chose to not only maintain the 75 million pesos offer , but to block any attempt to show their opening game with espn , since , and i quote from the newspaper , tdn has [ `` the first and last option to broadcast their home games '' . 
  ] ( http://www.diariocambio.com.mx/2017/marcador-final/item/13006-espn-y-tdn-se-pelean-por-transmitir-a-lobos-buap ), 
  lobos buap have apparently choose espn , and they are only waiting to said clause to end at week 3 ( according to the contract ) , but lobos buap is giving week 5 as their last dark game , maybe as a precaution in case shit really hits the fan . 
  nonetheless , with the light shining at the end of the proverbial tunnel , the consequences of their actions are already visible . 
  transfers that can not be officialized due to lack of resources , players that are already with the team are being cut due to the same reason [ ( * cherokee * p\u00e9rez , leandro somoza y leandro graci\u00e1n ) ] ( http://archive.is/0jntc#selection-2069.638-2069.654 ), 
  this hit * cherokee * p\u00e9rez the hardest , who just [ retired after he was cut as a consequence of televisa/tdn refusing to let go ] ( https://www.elsoldepuebla.com.mx/deportes-local/cherokee-perez-dice-adios-a-las-canchas-tras-no-alcanzar-un-sitio-en-la-manada ), 
  # ** so now what ? 
  we wait and see how it unravels before our eyes . 
  # ** just like that ? 
  yup , whether lobos survive depends on their decisions , which will affect the current landscape of tv deals in liga mx . 
  for those that have n't heard the news , [ lobos buap 's games wont be broadcasted or transmitted by any means . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/lobosbuapmx/status/888571546498985984 ) the games that will go dark are :, 
  * lobos buap vs santos - week 1 [ check the match thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6oy9f8/post_match_thread_lobos_buap_vs_santos_laguna/ ), 
  * lobos buap vs pachuca -- week 3, 
  * lobos buap vs am\u00e9rica -- week 5, 
  and possibly more if the situation get worse . 
  #how did we reach to this ? 
  football broadcasting is something of weird business . 
  sometimes the entire league gets a tv deal , [ like the premier league . 
  ] ( http://www.espnfc.com/english-premier-league/23/blog/post/2917119/how-premier-league-record-tv-deal-will-affect-english-football ) sometimes the state is involved , [ argentina was in such situation until recently . 
  ] ( https://futbol.as.com/futbol/2017/02/25/internacional/1488018915_257606.html ) and right now we 're having here at mexico somewhat of a revolution . 
  see , previously you only had two options to broadcast your games : televisa or tv azteca ( previously imevisi\u00f3n ) , it was either that or nothing . 
  both companies had a duopoly on tv , and everyone had to abide by their rulings . 
  hell , there still rumors of [ televisa fixing the final of verano 2002 away leg , in the middle of said game . 
  ] ( http://www.excelsior.com.mx/adrenalina/2016/11/30/1131285 ) not only that , they were using necaxa as a developmental team , pretty much dismantling the team every time they shined . 
  alex aguinaga 's transfer to america was only blocked [ by then-president ernesto zedillo actively working for necaxa to retain him . 
  # ** so why are lobos buap 's game not broadcasted in tv , or any form of broadcast ? 
  well , since the 2000s there 's been a series of events , mismanagements , errors of judgment and economical downturns that one could write an entire book , so i 'll keep it simple . 
  the key elements are :, 
  * the state of mexican economy . 
  * the rise of the internet and the `` milenial '' . 
  also blim . 
  * the rise of cable companies and other tv broadcaster . 
  these elements resulted in a reduction of profit and an increase of competitors , specially the third one . 
  see , like i said before , the previous model was either them ( televisa and tv azteca ) , or your dead on arrival . 
  as paul heyman said :, 
   the highest grossing year ( of ecw ) was 2000 ( the year it folded ) . 
  entertainment is very funny commodity . 
  and as we discussed before , the chokepoints in entertainment are ** content ** , do you have enough content ? 
  ... a chokepoint is `` where does the deal can get of the rails ? '' ... if you do n't have enough talent , you do n't have content to fill the hour , two hours , three hours of program or whatever the case may be . 
  ... there are two things ( that are chokepoints ) , one is ** financing ** . 
  ... if you have no financing , there is no promotion . 
  the other chokepoint is ** distribution ** . 
  now i can have 10 million dollars to produce a television show , but if nobody would put it on the air for me , i would lose that 10 million because it wont air . 
  and if it does n't air , how can i promote my events ? 
  ... why would anybody give me money for a license . 
  the videogame companies wont give me money . 
  i have no way to promote the product . 
  ... what it boiled down to ( about the downfall of ecw ) was , at the end of the day , distribution . 
  we had no distribution . 
  so it did n't matter if we had a product or not , or even if we had the financing or not . 
  that duopoly of distribution gave them power over the league and their teams , and they were n't afraid of using it to create contracts that only favors them . 
  and to show how draconic this contracts are and how do they affect the teams , let me tell you about the queretaro 's * `` relegation '' * . 
  for those that do n't follow the league , or simply forgot about it , the now defunct version of jaguares de chiapas was actually * los reales * ( o * tuberos * ) of [ san luis . 
  ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/san_luis_f%c3%batbol_club ) this was part of a series of transactions and movements that can only be described as a spit to football and a step to follow the closed-shop system so popular in the usa . 
  the events also can fill an entire book , so i 'll summarized in a few points :, 
  * gallos de quer\u00e9taro were relegated to ascenso mx ( mexico second division ), 
  * after a series of reunions and negotiations , [ it 's announced that quer\u00e9taro has effectively bought jaguares , therefore remaining in liga mx ( mexico first division ) . 
  * this send a lot of red alarms to la piedad , who had just won their promotion to liga mx . 
  they were told that there was nothing blocking them from playing in the top division . 
  * chargoy , owner of san luis , [ blames the state and businessmen of not investing in the team . 
  ] ( http://www.futbolsapiens.com/actualidad-futbol-mexicano/reales-san-luis-lopez-chargoy/ ) [ they call bull , revealing offers of 40 million pesos to maintain the team in the city for 4 more years .
