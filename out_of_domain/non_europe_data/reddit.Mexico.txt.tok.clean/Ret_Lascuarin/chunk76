  ] ( http://www.futbolsapiens.com/actualidad-futbol-mexicano/san-luis-lopez-chargoy/ ) they also reveal that the state of san luis potos\u00ed was willing to help the team financially , so long there was help from the industrial sector to offset some financial responsibility , but that was turned down by the fmf . 
  * 8 days after the previously mentioned statements , [ san luis moves to chiapas and becomes the now defunct jaguares de chiapas . 
  ] ( http://www.futbolsapiens.com/actualidad-futbol-mexicano/reales-san-luis-chiapas/ ) san luis effectively died that day , the franchise was send to second division and rebranded . 
  they are now known as atl\u00e9tico san luis , the affiliate team of atl\u00e9tico de madrid . 
  * la piedad had it worse , they did n't even play in first division . 
  after being told that there was nothing stopping them from playing in liga mx , a roadblock appeared all of the sudden . 
  [ they were send to veracruz ] ( http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/mexico/noticias/2013/05/28/reales-van-a-chiapas-y-la-piedad-a-veracruz ) , under the excuse that [ their stadium did n't had the necessary capacity to participate in liga mx . 
  ] ( http://www.futbolsapiens.com/actualidad-futbol-mexicano/la-piedad-ayuda-liga-mx/ ) ( for reference , the juan nepomuceno l\u00f3pez stadium has a capacity of 13,356 spectators , bigger than those of c.d. 
  in spain , bournemouth in england , bigger than half of the stadiums of primeira liga ) the state of michoac\u00e1n tried to divert resources so the team could stay , but were unsuccessful and [ the team died for a third time in its existence . 
  ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/reboceros_de_la_piedad#temporadas_1951-presente ), 
  * and just to add insult over injury , this was the third time that tiburones rojos de veracruz was resuscitated in the same manner . 
  ( previously done in 1989 to neza and 2002 to irapuato ) . 
  # ** so when are we talking about lobos ? 
  well , the rabbit hole goes deeper and scummier than what i talked before , and the current climate of lobos is connected to it . 
  see , a year before that clusterfuck , san luis was sold by televisa under the excuse of `` following the new rules on multi-property '' ( they were simply restructuring to maximize their profits ) to [ nacer global , a company created by jorge nacer gobera , director of university icel and of el economista , a financial newspaper , for 40 million dollars . 
  ] ( http://eleconomista.com.mx/deportes/2012/04/26/nacer-global-ficha-san-luis-us40-millones ) he sold it [ the next season to chargoy ] ( http://eleconomista.com.mx/deportes/2012/11/13/nacer-global-vende-100-club-san-luis ) , the same one that took the team to chiapas the very next season . 
  why ? 
  nacer may had absolutely no knowledge of the world of football , but he did knew a lot of business . 
  [ according to ignacio su\u00e1rez , he only paid 5 million dollars in cash , ] ( http://archive.is/f0dtn ) which looks promising from outside , but found out that the 35 million would be obtained from the payment usually obtained through tv deals . 
  televisa was the only one that had the right to broadcast any san luis games , and nacer would n't obtain even a cent from the `` deal '' . 
  he clearly understood that there was no future , since the team was shit ** ( content ) ** , the finances fell completely on him and what they obtained from matchday ** ( finances ) ** , and he could n't negotiate with anyone since they were stuck with an auto-renewable , non-negotiable tv deal with televisa ** ( distribution ) ** . 
  so why did chargoy bought such a toxic deal ? 
  every team has some sort of relation with their state , sometimes it 's closer than expected or shown to the public . 
  puebla is one of those teams , and the previous owner ricardo henaine had , at the time , a tense relation with the then governor rafael moreno valle . 
  the details of said does n't matter , what does matter is the fact that henaine was looking to move the team to greener pastures . 
  chargoy , at that time a minority owner of the club , saw his childhood team edging closer to leaving the state and planned a way to keep it , with or without henaine 's approval . 
  he decided to start negotiations with an old business partner , jorge nacer gobera . 
  nacer , seeing light at the end of the tunnel , took the opportunity and got rid of the liability that was san luis . 
  the plan was simple , henaine would eventually take the team to another state and chargoy would bring san luis to puebla , effectively keeping football in puebla . 
  imagine his surprise when henaine decides to simply sell the team , instead of moving . 
  at the end he reached an agreement with the then owner and obtained full ownership of the club . 
  what should have been a joyous occasion resulted into he and his family incurring into bad debt . 
  according to [ jos\u00e9 hanan ] ( http://intoleranciadiario.com/detalleopinion/6344/en-linea-deportiva/una-historia-para-recordar ) , chargoy 's current problems can be traced to this series of transactions . 
  he only planned to obtain one team , not two . 
  when san luis was send to chiapas it was n't because chargoy loved chiapas or hated san luis , but because he had a good relationship with then governor of chiapas , manuel velasco . 
  this was something he began to look immediately , since both puebla and san luis owned their respective tv network around 7 years of free tv ** each ** ** ( distribution ) ** . 
  but when the well dried up , he depended on players sales . 
  a string of bad transfer windows ** ( product ) ** and a bunch of other problems , most of them related to the lack of financial resources ** ( finances ) ** , resulted in [ the death of chiapas ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6g24tw/yesterday_was_the_liga_mx_draft_and_also_the_last/ ), 
  # ** but what about lobos ? 
  it 's a common rumor that chargoy tried to buy lobos buap after they won their promotion to liga mx , both to keep chiapas in first division and to monopolize the resources from the state of puebla ( lobos buap is tied to the benem\u00e9rita universidad aut\u00f3noma de puebla , a public university ) . 
  while it 's clearly that said negotiations failed , since lobos just played their first game and puebla is borrowing even more from tv azteca , there must have been talks about the ** distribution ** of the ** product ** . 
  and that probably made them check their own contract with tdn ( who broadcasted their games in ascenso mx ) , whose parent company is televisa . 
  according to su\u00e1rez , they offered them 75 million pesos per season for the rights of broadcasting . 
  not a bad deal , unless you actually start to investigate the actual value of the ** product ** . 
  see , leones negros ( leones negros de la universidad de guadalajara ) sold their own rights in liga mx not to televisa , but to espn for [ 7 million dollars ] ( http://laaficion.milenio.com/udeg/leones-negros-vendio-derechos-tv_0_341365915.html ) , which is still more than what half of the teams in liga mx get from their deals . 
  however , su\u00e1rez reveals that the end of leones negros stay in first division , that amount totaled 18 million dollars for a year of broadcast . 
  lobos buap , who is on the same position than them , is being offered 8.2 million dollars ( tc : 17.90 , 4.1 million per season ) for the same amount of time . 
  the more they began to read their own contract , the less enticing it became . 
  which brings us to the current bidders for lobos buap tv rights . 
  tdn and espn . 
  espn apparently offered 20 million dolllars for a 4 year contract . 
  if said 20 million is per year , then than means that they 're being offered 10 million per season . 
  [ which is more than a lot of the teams in the league ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/anexo:derechos_de_transmisi%c3%b3n_por_tv_de_la_primera_divisi%c3%b3n_de_m%c3%a9xico#tabla_de_derechos_y_trasmisiones_en_m.c3.a9xico ), 
  tdn , on the scummy side , chose to not only maintain the 75 million pesos offer , but to block any attempt to show their opening game with espn , since , and i quote from the newspaper , tdn has [ `` the first and last option to broadcast their home games '' . 
  ] ( http://www.diariocambio.com.mx/2017/marcador-final/item/13006-espn-y-tdn-se-pelean-por-transmitir-a-lobos-buap ), 
  lobos buap have apparently choose espn , and they are only waiting to said clause to end at week 3 ( according to the contract ) , but lobos buap is giving week 5 as their last dark game , maybe as a precaution in case shit really hits the fan . 
  nonetheless , with the light shining at the end of the proverbial tunnel , the consequences of their actions are already visible . 
  transfers that can not be officialized due to lack of resources , players that are already with the team are being cut due to the same reason [ ( * cherokee * p\u00e9rez , leandro somoza y leandro graci\u00e1n ) ] ( http://archive.is/0jntc#selection-2069.638-2069.654 ), 
  this hit * cherokee * p\u00e9rez the hardest , who just [ retired after he was cut as a consequence of televisa/tdn refusing to let go ] ( https://www.elsoldepuebla.com.mx/deportes-local/cherokee-perez-dice-adios-a-las-canchas-tras-no-alcanzar-un-sitio-en-la-manada ), 
  # ** so now what ? 
  we wait and see how it unravels before our eyes . 
  # ** just like that ? 
  yup , whether lobos survive depends on their decisions , which will affect the current landscape of tv deals in liga mx . 
  a continuation of / u/haltdovahkiin post : [ `` guidelines for the new mexican female league . 
  absolutely pitiful from the fmf . 
  '' ] ( https://www.np.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6pq8r4/guidelines_for_the_new_mexican_female_league/ ), 
  while i could write this as a post , the lenght of the post and some of the discussions that there will be are somewhat separated , so it 's better to separate it . 
  so , to refresh those that do ' t want to check or have n't read it , here is a rundown of what fox sports ' [ la ultima palabra ( the last word ) ] ( https://www.foxsports.com.mx/news/315149-los-lamentables-lineamientos-para-la-liga-mx-femenil ) reported :, 
   * if a player gets pregnant their contract is voided . 
   * no social or medical security ( insurance ) for the players . 
   * players ca n't appear too masculine . 
   * any case of homosexuality is strictly prohibited . 
   * salary cap for players is 2500 pesos ( around $ 140 dollars a month ), 
  so i went deeper into the articles and have good news and bad news to report . 
  first of all , according to fmf through female liga mx official website , [ they deny almost everything ] ( http://www.ligafemenil.mx/cancha/detallenoticia/21308/postura-de-la-liga-mx-femenil ) , here are the relevant parts of their statement :, 
  * medical security, 
   so long a female player is registered ( just like it proceeds with the males in the diferent competitions of liga mx / ascenso mx ) they must have medical insutance , which will be provided by the club where she plays . 
  * too masculine , no homosexulity and no pregnancy rules allowed by the rulebook . 
   there is no article in the social statute of the fmf or in the female liga mx 's competition rulebook or from any of the professional divisions , where decrees limit the right of participation in the league due to sexual preference , religion or any other discrimatory circumstance . 
  #so ... all good , then ? 
  no , they did n't mention shit about the salary cap . 
  but i 've found out about and it 's kind of good . 
  see , [ the $ 2,500 mxn mentioned amount was the salary cap , which was categorized as a grunt . 
  ] ( http://archive.is/gp4sg ) and to add insult to injury , the original cap was of $ 3,000 mxn . 
  #holy shit !, 
  do n't sweat , the key word is * was * . 
  apparently , some teams started to pay players the incredible ^ ^ / s sum of $ 30,000 mxn . 
  that is without apparently including quer\u00e9taros ' [ new signing ] ( https://twitter.com/china_perez3/status/881290916480339972 ) and tigres bought [ carolina jaramillo ] ( https://twitter.com/carojaramillo94/status/880906005797888001 ) and [ fabiola ibarra ] ( https://twitter.com/fabibarra0/status/880834599445594114 ) , which appears to be two of xolos ' jewels of the crown . 
  however , what one must take away from this information is the lack of research done by the fmf . 
  according to their own social statue , article 105.1 :, 
   105.1 ( the players affiliated to the fmf ) obtain the statue of professional when the player receives a remunaration , either from his participation in the sport of football or any activity related to said sport , superior to the expenses incurred in his football activities and that is registered in the professional sector . 
  now , $ 2,500 mxn is not above said expenses even if they lived in an apartment whose costs are paid by someone else ( ex . 
  : property taxes and services ) and free transportation . 
  $ 3,500 mxn sounds like an insult to someone that needs an urgent and respectable rise . 
  but even then , they were `` professionals '' according to the fmf , even if they did n't fill the requirements put by the ** same federation . 
  #so ... it 's just low salaries ? 
  [ [ laughs ] ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvo5bufww0 ), 
  you wish , some teams can fire you if you get pregnant . 
  #but the fmf said -, 
  the fmf says a ton of shit , they lie a lot .
