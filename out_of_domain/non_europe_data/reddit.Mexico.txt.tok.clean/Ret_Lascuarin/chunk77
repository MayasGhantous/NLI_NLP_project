  benavente , a journalist that covers women football here in mexico , found out that some teams [ told their players that they will be inmediatly fired without fiancial compensation if they `` are not physically and mentally fit '' . 
  ] ( http://www.universodeportivo.mx/columna/2017/07/26/el-futbol-femenil-tiempo-de-sumar ) to put it in her own words :, 
   ... [ pregnancy ] is neither forbidden nor it 's accepted , ... 
  #but that 's both illegal and against their own rulebook !, 
  we are talking a federation whose current model of transfer window is [ illegal according to mexico 's federal labour laws ] ( http://aristeguinoticias.com/0804/mexico/pacto-de-caballeros-en-el-futbol-mexicano-viola-ley-laboral/ ) and it 's still there for everyone to see . 
  so who follows the rules ? 
  that is hard to say , but according to brenda alvarado , another journalist that covers women football , [ rules change from team to team , specially matters covered in the leaked guidelines . 
  and if you wonder what is the stance of the teams , here is a list of what i know and what i think :, 
  * ** am\u00e9rica ** already send a [ press release ] ( https://twitter.com/clubamerica/status/890362778770395136 ) that denies the guideline as their guideline , as well as assuring people that they are following the law . 
  * ** quer\u00e9taro ** seems really invested in their women team : they were [ presented to the public in the corregidora ] ( https://twitter.com/club_queretaro/status/890015765528805376 ) , they also give [ constant updates about their female team ] ( https://twitter.com/club_queretaro/status/890348650240593920 ) and the games [ will be free . 
  ] ( http://www.marca.com/claro-mx/futbol/futbol-femenil/2017/07/05/595c4534468aebba258b45bf.html ) so it looks promising . 
  * ** tigres ** seems to be interested in winning the league , like i wrote before about the new signings . 
  [ they also give constant updates about their women football team ] ( https://twitter.com/tigresfemenil ), 
  * ** toluca ** has already presented [ their team without too much fanfare . 
  ] ( https://www.tolucafc.com/noticia/2017-07-26/diablas-a-escena - ), 
  * [ ** xolos ' ** women division has a long history ] ( http://www.wpsl.info/news/index.php?id=2278 ) , so there should be no problems outside those of players with double nationality . 
  * ** cruz azul ** women team has very little exposure , so i do n't know almost anything about them as a team and their own project . 
  but considering the current status , they 're probably just doing it either as a favour or as an order . 
  * both ** pachuca ** and ** leon ** take their programs seriously , but pachuca not only won the inagural tournament , they are also one of the three that spend the most on their female division . 
  the other two are am\u00e9rica and tigres . 
  will continue to give updates as i find more information . 
  also , [ some players of mexico 's wnt ca n't play in the league because , to the fmf , they are foreginers . 
  update : according to nelly simon of espn , [ there wont be any broadcast of the game , all of the teams choose to increase the maximum salary and that there is a pay structure for those in the national team . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwvzppok7vi&feature=youtu.be ), 
  update 2 : according to ricardo cari\u00f1o , also of espn , [ some players ended up taking the $ 2,500 mxn before the increase of the salary and are stuck with said salary for the moment ] ( https://twitter.com/ricardocarino/status/890400042401624064 ), 
  update 3 : [ list of players of mexico 's wnt that are ineligible to play in the national league . 
  a continuation of / u/haltdovahkiin post : [ `` guidelines for the new mexican female league . 
  absolutely pitiful from the fmf . 
  '' ] ( https://www.np.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6pq8r4/guidelines_for_the_new_mexican_female_league/ ), 
  while i could write this as a post , the lenght of the post and some of the discussions that there will be are somewhat separated , so it 's better to separate it . 
  so , to refresh those that do ' t want to check or have n't read it , here is a rundown of what fox sports ' [ la ultima palabra ( the last word ) ] ( https://www.foxsports.com.mx/news/315149-los-lamentables-lineamientos-para-la-liga-mx-femenil ) reported :, 
   * if a player gets pregnant their contract is voided . 
   * no social or medical security ( insurance ) for the players . 
   * players ca n't appear too masculine . 
   * any case of homosexuality is strictly prohibited . 
   * salary cap for players is 2500 pesos ( around $ 140 dollars a month ), 
  so i went deeper into the articles and have good news and bad news to report . 
  first of all , according to fmf through female liga mx official website , [ they deny almost everything ] ( http://www.ligafemenil.mx/cancha/detallenoticia/21308/postura-de-la-liga-mx-femenil ) , here are the relevant parts of their statement :, 
  * medical security, 
   so long a female player is registered ( just like it proceeds with the males in the diferent competitions of liga mx / ascenso mx ) they must have medical insutance , which will be provided by the club where she plays . 
  * too masculine , no homosexulity and no pregnancy rules allowed by the rulebook . 
   there is no article in the social statute of the fmf or in the female liga mx 's competition rulebook or from any of the professional divisions , where decrees limit the right of participation in the league due to sexual preference , religion or any other discrimatory circumstance . 
  #so ... all good , then ? 
  no , they did n't mention shit about the salary cap . 
  but i 've found out about and it 's kind of good . 
  see , [ the $ 2,500 mxn mentioned amount was the salary cap , which was categorized as a grunt . 
  ] ( http://archive.is/gp4sg ) and to add insult to injury , the original cap was of $ 3,000 mxn . 
  #holy shit !, 
  do n't sweat , the key word is * was * . 
  apparently , some teams started to pay players the incredible ^ ^ / s sum of $ 30,000 mxn . 
  that is without apparently including quer\u00e9taros ' [ new signing ] ( https://twitter.com/china_perez3/status/881290916480339972 ) and tigres bought [ carolina jaramillo ] ( https://twitter.com/carojaramillo94/status/880906005797888001 ) and [ fabiola ibarra ] ( https://twitter.com/fabibarra0/status/880834599445594114 ) , which appears to be two of xolos ' jewels of the crown . 
  however , what one must take away from this information is the lack of research done by the fmf . 
  according to their own social statue , article 105.1 :, 
   105.1 ( the players affiliated to the fmf ) obtain the statue of professional when the player receives a remunaration , either from his participation in the sport of football or any activity related to said sport , superior to the expenses incurred in his football activities and that is registered in the professional sector . 
  now , $ 2,500 mxn is not above said expenses even if they lived in an apartment whose costs are paid by someone else ( ex . 
  : property taxes and services ) and free transportation . 
  $ 3,500 mxn sounds like an insult to someone that needs an urgent and respectable rise . 
  but even then , they were `` professionals '' according to the fmf , even if they did n't fill the requirements put by the ** same federation . 
  #so ... it 's just low salaries ? 
  [ [ laughs ] ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyvo5bufww0 ), 
  you wish , some teams can fire you if you get pregnant . 
  #but the fmf said -, 
  the fmf says a ton of shit , they lie a lot . 
  benavente , a journalist that covers women football here in mexico , found out that some teams [ told their players that they will be inmediatly fired without fiancial compensation if they `` are not physically and mentally fit '' .

  update 3 : [ list of players of mexico 's wnt that are ineligible to play in the national league . 
  mart\u00edn * el ni\u00f1o * galv\u00e1n was one of cruz azul 's main youth prospect . 
  starting at the age of 13 , he was called to the first team at the age of [ 15 for the torneo interliga 2008 . ], 
  debuted by sergio markarian , who had arrived to cruz azul after [ winning the league in paraguay with libertad ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/sergio_markari%c3%a1n ) , he considered him [ as a player with qualities of a crack ] ( http://www.futbolsapiens.com/actualidad-futbol-mexicano/se-acuerdan-de-martin-galvan/ ) . 
  however , he arrived in the same season that markarian left cruz azul , which put him in an unfavourable position with his replacement . 
  even though he debuted in the league under galindo against [ indios de ciudad ju\u00e1rez ] ( http://ligamx.net/estadistica/jj/eyj0axr1bg9uywjsysi6iibksiatie1bultntibmvultiedbtfbbtibst01picisiibwc1rpcg9fc3rkijoismdkciisimlkvgvtcg9yywrhijointkilcjpzfrvcm5lbyi6ijeilcjpzerpdmlzaw9uijoiosisimlkqwzszerydmqioii2odk4ocisikzhc2uioiixin0= ) , he was never of his trust . 
  he was sent back to the sub-17 , and later moved to the sub-20 , before having his first full 90min . 
  he was later brought back at clausura 2011 under enrique * ojitos * meza , but that was the season that cruz azul had javier * chuletita * orozco and emanuel * tito * villa , so he did n't play any game and was sent back to the reserves . 
  he got other chances at copa mx of apertura 2012 * memo * v\u00e1zquez , and he send him back to the reserves ** again ** . 
  at the end , the now 24 years old striker was send in a series of loans to a bunch of teams in ascenso mx and segunda divisi\u00f3n , now renamed liga premier .
