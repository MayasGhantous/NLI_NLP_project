  pioneros de canc\u00fan | clausura 2017 | same season he arrived | segunda divisi\u00f3n | played 93 minutes in the entire season . 
  he now has recently signed with [ cf salmantino uds ] ( https://twitter.com/cfsalmantinoefm/status/889521979191177218 ) of spain 's tercera divisi\u00f3n - grupo viii . 
  they were recently promoted to tercera divisi\u00f3n - grupo viii ( 4 ^ ^ th division ) after winning the [ 1\u00aa divisi\u00f3n regional de aficionados - grupo b ( 5 ^ ^ th division ) . 
  ] ( http://fcylf.es/competiciones ) it 's history is messy , but i 'll summarize the important elements about it . 
  cd salmantino uds was orginally an affiliated team of the now-defunct [ ud salamanca ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/uni%c3%b3n_deportiva_salamanca ) . 
  the team started as an independent project in the 40s but ended up joining with ud salamanca in the 50s . 
  that lasted until 2013 , when the team collapsed financially , after being 90 years floating from categor\u00eda regional up to la liga first division in a series of stints in the 90s and early 2000s . 
  by the time the team died , they were a midtable club in segunda b ( third division ) . 
  after years of mismanagment , the team was dissolution and their assets sold . 
  and by sold , i mean they were put on auction at the 20 ^ ^ th of june of 2013 , no one bought anything from the 3 lots ( one for 15mil euros , another for 1.2 mil euros and the third one for 970k euros ) , then they were put in a personal auction , no one bought shit , and it limped on , the stadium was sold for less than they were asking for , so where the players , and the symbol , name and history was just bought ** two months ago ** by cd salmantino uds for 150k euros . 
  that same products were being sold in the 15 million euros lot . 
  they currently play at the [ estadio helm\u00e1ntico ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/estadio_helm%c3%a1ntico ) , where the ud salamanca used to play . 
  they were previously sharing the grounds of the [ pistas del helm\u00e1ntico ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/estadio_helm%c3%a1ntico#pistas_del_helm.c3.a1ntico ) with unionistas de salamanca , a team started by the fans and associates of the extinct team . 
  also , there 's something weird happening at cd salmantino uds , mostly about who actually owns the estadio helm\u00e1ntico and the team . 
  it 's a clusterfuck and a big rabbit hole , it 's been four hours and shit keeps piling up . 
  and since this post is already way too long and about a bunch of things that does n't include galv\u00e1n , i 'm going to give you the summary of it . 
  on the 13 ^ ^ th of november of 2015 , a bunch of mexican business man , lead by miguel alejandro miranda p\u00e9rez , [ bought the stadium for 1,056,000 euros . 
  ] ( http://www.record.com.mx/futbol-futbol-internacional/empresarios-mexicanos-compran-estadio-en-espana ) other four persons arrived to see the transaction taking place , one of them was carlos mart\u00edn , president of cf salmantino uds . 
  that same team started playing there that same season . 
  he was later [ separated from the company who legally bought everything ] ( http://www.boe.es/borme/dias/2017/05/08/pdfs/borme-a-2017-85-28.pdf ) , and was replaced by some guy [ with close ties with agapito iglesias , chargoy 's equivalent in spain . 
  those this have anything to do with galv\u00e1n ? 
  possibly , he is one of the three mexicans that are now part of cd salmantino uds . 
  also , a 15 million euros lot was sold for 1,206,000 million euros in two different transactions . 
  talk about a bargain . 
  about the other two mexican players . 
  diego francos mares is 24 years old midfielder that started in the frailes homape , last seen in the 2015-2016 season of tercera divisi\u00f3n ( fourth division ) . 
  then moved to cruz azul sub-17 in 2008 , debuted with cruz azul against san luis during week 2 of clausura 2013 . 
  he was inmediatly send back to cruz azul hidalgo , had a smaller number of loan stints that alternated between san luis ( now atl\u00e9tico san luis ) and cd tepatitl\u00e1n morelos . 
  he was signed [ the 17 ^ ^ th of july ] ( https://twitter.com/diegofranco92/status/887051469358280705?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw&ref_url=http%3a%2f%2fbeta.goal.com%2fes-mx%2fnoticias%2fdiego-franco-mares-canterano-de-cruz-azul-emigra-a-espana%2f4h4wny77ffir13ykswnen646o ) . 
  marcos iv\u00e1n p\u00e9rez is a 29 years old defender that started in club indios de ciudad ju\u00e1rez in apertura 2005 , back when indios was an affiliate team of pachuca and also back when second division was called primera divisi\u00f3n a. 
  was promoted to the first team a year later , debuted with them against am\u00e9rica at week 8 of clausura 2007 as a starter . 
  then he was send back and forth between their affiliates and the main team , later send to le\u00f3n at clausura 2012 . 
  then send to a stint in san luis , called back for a while , later send to mineros . 
  he was later loaned ** again ** to an ascenso mx team called ** lobos buap ** , where he obtained a place in the starting xi . 
  his loan was n't renewed , therefore sending him back to pachuca . 
  he was confirmed by the institution at [ the 18 ^ ^ th of july . 
  according to the press in spain , [ there will be a fourth mexican player presented later . 
  ] ( http://www.lagacetadesalamanca.es/futbol-local/2017/07/25/central-marco-perez-tercer-mexicano-salmantino-uds/211866.html ), 
  [ a quick refresh in case you forgot why he is worth talking about . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6jqoyy/an_update_on_the_three_that_refused_to_follow_the/ ), 
  so this appeared a few days ago , but it 's still weird how easy was to get him . 
  he played until with comunicaciones of guatemala until recently , when he just quit at the end of the season . 
  i kind of thought that he was leaving to some unexplored leagues for mexicans players when he said that [ recieved offers from foregin teams ] ( http://www.goal.com/es-mx/news/14562/guatemala/2017/06/02/36054972/izazola-queda-fuera-de-comunicaciones?nobetaredirect=1 ) , considering that he forced his loan to budapest honv\u00e9d when playing with san luis , not [ atlante ] ( https://www.facebook.com/atlantefc.oficial/posts/10155564258387486 ) who is [ the chiapas of ascenso mx ] ( http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/2017/04/18/atlante-entre-deudas-y-un-cuarto-ano-en-el-ascenso ) . 
  anyway , good luck to him . 
  [ based on fmf state of mind article ] ( https://www.fmfstateofmind.com/2017/8/14/16139822/mexicans-abroad-round-up ), 
  while there was information on players that i did n't knew , the post only convers european leagues on first division ( as well as some sub20s ) , which ignores a bunch of mexicans playing in south america , central american and some lower divisions in european leagues . 
  so i decided to start like a recount of mexicans playing outside of mexico . 
  if you have any info that it 's still not on this post , please comment with the name , team , country and a link to certify the information . 
  there will be only three rules :, 
  1 ) usa and canada do n't count . 
  2 ) only lower divisions of european leagues , the rest must be first division teams . 
  * as an example of why i am asking only about first division , until a few minutes ago i was adding this three players :, 
   name | age | team |, 
  * however , out of sheer luck i find this [ article ] ( http://www.diez.hn/liganacionaldehonduras/1093390-498/futbolistas-mexicanos-que-llegaron-a-honduras-fueron-enga%c3%b1ados ) about the fact that the three were cut after not even a month in the team . 
  and just to be sure , there is nothing about this on c.d. 
  vida 's social media and their website has been defunct for a while . 
  * c.d. 
  vida is a first division team , can you imagine looking for the same information about a a 2 ^ nd or 3 ^ rd division club ? 
  3 ) they must not be on the fmfsom article,
