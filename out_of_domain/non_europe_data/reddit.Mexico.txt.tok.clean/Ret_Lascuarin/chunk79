  so it seems that pumas unam is not the only one having problems with argentinan clubs ( the silva affair ) . 
  lucas zelarayan is a player brought to tigres a year and a half ago from belgrano , he is a great player that tends to be on the bench due to due\u00f1as and pizarro ( now with sevilla ) being the main pair in tigres ' midfield . 
  he is right now a starter , playing 63 ' min and subbed for gignac . 
  so not a fringe player . 
  however , san lorenzo has just registered lucas just as the window closed . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.afa.com.ar/7977/inscripciones ), 
  [ this can only be done when the player permits it ] ( http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2056515-solis-a-independiente-y-zelarayan-a-san-lorenzo-los-inscriptos-sobre-el-cierre-del-libro-de-pases-de-la-superliga ) , and they have only ** one week ** to finish the deal . 
  now , this may end up costing lucas his spot , since * tuca * does n't field players that are negotiating deals with other teams nor the ing . 
  rodriguez negotiates transfers without asking * tuca * . 
  so either they field him knowing that he will be going to san lorenzo or he wants to return to argentina and choose to pressure tigres into accepting san lorenzo offer . 
  as for why i think that tigres is not an active participant on the deal is due to previous negotiations with san lorenzo over * edu * vargas . 
  [ they could n't pay what tigres asked them for him ] ( https://twitter.com/clmerlo/status/885647951372009473 ) , and lucas is right now more important that what vargas was 2 months ago . 
  so what will tigres do ? 
  probably not accept it , we have a tendency of fucking people over when things go sour . 
  tigres backed out from matheus uribe when he arrived to mexico , told lugo to not return to them when he was cut by fc juarez . 
  tigres is a dick when talking about transfers . 
  so this will end on either an express transfer or as a long battle to get out of tigres . 
  ps : independiente also registered gast\u00f3n silva , even though pumas unam has his transfer and is currently [ suing him ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6vkd09/pumas_unam_will_sue_gast%c3%b3n_silva/ ) .

  since we are a week away from the deadline given to jaguares unemployed players to look for a team , here is a continuation of my [ previous post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6nrqix/quick_followup_on_jaguares_players/ ) . 
  just as reminder , they have until the 4 ^ ^ th of septemeber , a day before their foregin counterparts deadline . 
  here are the ones that obtained employment :, 
  * ** jorge villalpando ** was enjoying his retirement from football and working as a [ sports radio analyst ] ( https://twitter.com/jovillalpando/status/874369048439554048 ) . 
  however , with the injury of \u00c1lvarez , ** lobos buap ** started to scout any mexican goalkeeper they could ( rumors pointed mostly at richard s\u00e1nchez and cirilo saucedo ) , so they managed to bring him back ( after paying chargoy an undetermined fee ) . 
  * ** jonathan fabbro ** , [ alleged child rapist with an arrest warrant ] ( http://laaficion.milenio.com/futbolinternacional/jonathan_fabbro-violacion-nina-detencion-argentina-milenio-la_aficion_0_992901105.html ) , now plays with ** lobos buap ** , who did n't announce it by any official channel . 
  it 's almost as if they were n't that sure to bring him to a club that represents an university . 
  * ** william paredes ** got into a [ drunk fight with qui\u00f1ones ] ( http://m.milenio.com/lobos_buap/william_palacios-julian_quinones-lobos_buap-pelea-liga_mx-milenio-la_aficion_0_1007299616.html ) and was [ fired from ** lobos buap ** ] ( https://twitter.com/pressportmx/status/894297267095654401 ) . 
  he is now loaned at [ ** fbc melgar ** ] ( https://twitter.com/melgaroficial/status/895345910019915776 ) in ** peru ** . 
  * ** luis leal ** is another clusterfuck . 
  a quick read may give the impression that he is still property of the chargoys , but he was apparently already with [ ** lobos buap ** ] ( http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/2017/07/12/luis-leal-ya-entrena-con-lobos-buap ) . 
  my theory is that ** lobos buap ** brought him after he [ rescinded his contract with ** cerro porte\u00f1o ** of ** paraguay ** ] ( http://www.hoy.com.py/deportes/cerro-rescinde-contrato-de-luis-leal ) , but could n't pay him his salary after shit got sourer with their tv deal , so they loaned him to ** newell 's ** . 
  no official confirmation of this by any of the parties . 
  * ** lucas silva ** arrived to [ ** figueirense fc ** in ** brazil ** ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/lucas-silva/transfers/spieler/66895/transfer_id/1812532 ) in what appears to be a free transfer . 
  * ** leonardo buri\u00e1n ** arrived to [ ** c.d. 
  godoy cruz ** in argentina ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/leonardo-burian/transfers/spieler/72649/transfer_id/1790551 ) as a free agent . 
  * ** franco arizala ** is now with [ ** atl\u00e9tico bucaramanga ** in ** colombia ** ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/franco-arizala/transfers/spieler/77199/transfer_id/1859349 ), 
  * ** federico crivelli ** is now with [ ** c.a. 
  tigre ** in ** argentina ** ] ( https://www.transfermarkt.es/federico-crivelli/transfers/spieler/357334/transfer_id/1891600 ) . 
  * ** alejandro dur\u00e1n ** , who had debuted with the main team a year before the institution disappeared , plays with [ ** tuxtla f.c. 
  the ones that still have no team are :, 
  * ** enrique esqueda ** is apparently selling [ ads ] ( https://twitter.com/paletaesqueda9/status/895288366425554944 ) , so we can call him retired . 
  * ** franco flores ** was apparently returning to [ ** c.a. 
  uni\u00f3n de santa fe ** in ** argentina ** ] ( http://www.ellitoral.com/index.php/diarios/2017/07/31/deportes/depo-03.html ) , but the deal fell and the registration deadline in argentina has passed . 
  * ** aquivaldo mosquera ** is all but retired . 
  * ** guillermo daniel rodr\u00edguez ** is still injured . 
  ps : [ the page of chiapas became some sort of football news in indonesian ] ( http://chiapasfc.com/ ) managed by arena berita bola , [ an online gambling company ] ( http://www.arenasbobet.com/ ), 
  the transfer window closes tomorrow , 5 ^ ^ th of september , at 17:00 hrs, 
  today is the last day that any player of jaguares de chiapas can get a job in liga mx , [ here is a follow up on their current status . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6wh1ll/another_quick_followup_on_jaguares_players/ ), 
  the teams that have apparently closed their squads are :, 
  so here is a rundown on the current transfer rumors, 
  * atlas : they 're currently looking for a replacement of clifford aboagye , who is currently [ injured ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6toply/clifford_aboagye_out_for_4_months_due_to_knee/ ) . 
  they brought ravel morrison on a loan from lazio , but they 're also looking to obtain daniel barbosa from braga . 
  * necaxa : the mat\u00edas fern\u00e1ndez deal is ~ ~ near completion ~ ~ [ official ] ( https://twitter.com/clubnecaxa/status/904816081784762368 ) , and outside of that there is just a rumor about octavio rivero from colo colo. 
  * puebla : after cutting alvaro navarro and federico gonzalez from the squad , they were left with salom as the only striker in the team . 
  they just bought lucas cavalini from pe\u00f1arol and are also looking to bring luis angel land\u00edn back from herediano . 
  * pumas : they 're trying to restart the negotiations with julio barroso of colo colo after gast\u00f3n silva signed with independiente . 
  * tigres : the most active of the bunch , they are close to sign timothe\u00e9 kolodziejczak from borussia m\u00f6nchengladbach , as well as midfielder [ larry v\u00e1squez of patriotas in colombia ] ( http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/2017/09/04/compras-de-panico-tigres-tambien-ficha-a-colombiano ) . 
  another done deal is the goalkeeper [ eduardo fern\u00e1ndez of real salt lake ] ( http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/2017/09/03/tigres-ficho-de-ultima-hora-a-guardameta-de-la-mls ) , who will enter as the second option during palos injury and as third option until miguel ortega returns from an injury . 
  * xolos : they just lost jorge ortiz , who was sent back early to independiente and then arrived to belgrano in a free deal . 
  they also almost lost enzo kalinski , thought that would n't be a loss at all . 
  edit : completly forgot about bola\u00f1os deal not being officialized by the time i wrote this post , he just arrived in a two seasons loan deal . 
  * lobos buap : they 're under constant media pressure and on a short budget due to their fight for a better tv deal against televisa . 
  [ read more about that here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ligamx/comments/6p0s4e/on_lobos_buap_lack_of_broadcast/ ) they have lost * cherokee * perez , who quit football altogether , somoza and gracian due to lack of money , and are also about to lose herrera , who may return to melgar . 
  the transfer window closes tomorrow , 5 ^ ^ th of september , at 17:00 hrs, 
  today is the last day that any player of jaguares de chiapas can get a job in liga mx , [ here is a follow up on their current status .
