  he was, 
  probably for the us ? 
  as a mexican , obtaining videogames was ( and sometimes still is ) a fucking nightmare , where they were only two places to leaglly buy pc games and another two for consoles games . 
  i had to modify my ps2 to play ico , for it never came here . 
  so the golden ages was for me the dark ages . 
  as for the cancer thing , its just that people were actually considering games to be something more than a child 's toy . 
  samething with anime and manga , where in the late 90s and early 2000s a new wave brought something more than battle manga to the mix . 
  nah man , it was in the farest point on the stadium . 
  something like that would provoke a clusterf *** . 
  no , i just got curious because i was roaming to see old episodes , and then bam , private video . 
  i am worried if they did that to the episodes where jontron , felicia day , sterling and super bunnyhop are the guest . 
  ... now , ** that 's ** something new . 
  for me it 's new, 
  thanks, 
  juninho and ayala, 
   striker, 
  yeah , i remember when they put him as a striker . 
  it was a funny sight . 
  still , not ** my ** favourite due to his short temper , once he tried to kick ex-tigre player cirilo saucedo . 
  but at least he did not injuried them like gaitan . 
  because he is an ossie ( east german ) ? 
  \u00bf turkish `` o '' ? 
  mate , just check wikipedia, 
  ** champion of the world **, 
  a creative midfielder , tuca 's teams require players like gaitan or lucas lobos to pass the ball , right now guido pizarro and arevalo rios are beign both defensive and attacking midfielders , but it is not good enough, 
  no , there are some esceptions when a player scores against a former team , but it is not the norm . 
  someone must gain reigns over manu transfer window . 
  i mean , come on , you go for a player and then you decide to cut talks ? 
  jesus , he looks like a kid on a spending spree at a fifa game . 
  no , their ultimate goal is to win and to have the best posible players on the team with the best posible coach . 
  there are few teams that use mostly their academies , athletic de biblao and chivas de guadalajara , but they are the exception . 
  ... i decide to not enter this sub for like a week and now there is some sort of massive dox due to whatever am hack is ? 
  man , i always arrive late for anything . 
   and no , the story here is not that japan is a country full of sex perverts ; if anything , the general public there sees the likes of omega labyrinth as even more shameful and deviant than americans do . 
  ... no , the reason they hate gamers and otaku is because they consider all those hobbies as a waste of time that could be used to produce cash . 
  yes , money , not morals . 
  the writer probably got his info from the few times that this types of game have been discused on the senate , and they finally prohibited rape games , but they only talk of the surface of the reasons that most of japan hate otakus . 
  japan is a country that , even though they had been demilitarized , has a very very strong patrichal society where the women are below men and men most also continue a set of rules to be a man . 
  liking animation , comics , and videogames are considered to be detrimental to the `` manness '' of a man , due to being a `` waste of time '' that could be used to produce `` results '' . 
  so it is not the morals you are presenting , it another set of factors . 
  still , yeah , games must begin to experiment with sexuality outside bad pornos . 
   perhaps their elders do and japanese society is quite dominated by the elderly . 
  ** this . 
  yes , hatred to the otaku culture has leveled down since the 50s , but it still there and rooted in the depths of the culture . 
  the cultural shift from the obsession of working ( it has a specific name , but i ca n't remember ) was caused by posmodernism , when they began to give voices to those who were abandoned during the postwar years . 
  hence the shift from the studio ghibli 's version of grave of fireflies to the 2005 version by sota yato . 
  still , my main problem is that the author of the article just dismiss all of this . 
  terranigama , illusion of time/gaia , final fantasy iv - ix and the tactics serie , tales of symphonia , chrono trigger and the world ends with you, 
  god , no !, 
  the mightiest cunt of all winners, 
  good , torres nilo, 
  good, 
  do tell, 
  what about reyna ? 
   real madrid spent over 1 billion and have not won the league in forever . 
  yes , of course . 
  last time they won the title was in 2011-2012 , and they were subchampions both in 2012-2013 and 2014-2015 . 
  last time they won the cup was in 2013-2014 , and they were subchampions in 2012-2013 . 
  last time they won the champions was on 2013-2014 . 
  yeah , forever, 
  still not forever , and its 1 league and 5 times as subchampions . 
  teams like schalke 04 and liverpool have it worst . 
  and you have n't won the fa cup for a decade and that still does not make manu a shitty team . 
  so its not important because you have n't won it ? 
  real mature , mate, 
  i just saved your argument for how childish it sounds . 
  considering manu squads and managers , they should also have won the cup at least 6 times in a decade , but you have n't won once since 2003 . 
  but hey , who 's counting ? 
  i know that , but that does not mean one should just forget of his existance and do not fight to win it , which is what / u/vetro777 is implying in his comment, 
  if i am pathetich you are below by five tiers . 
  but f - it , if we continue spitting each other , we only will achive to get both of us in a sour mood . 
  who said rm should have won everything ? 
  you, 
  so is your opinion , since we have the same amount of authority of `` fans shouting at a screen '', 
  still , yeah , ca n't they just keep one manager for like half a decade ? 
  sometimes i think that they choose manager by throwing tarts to a table with fotos of recent champions . 
  says the brit with almost every comment on this thread on the negatives . 
   now that you have run out of shit to spew you try to insult me . 
  nah , i just got bored . 
  we could continue for hours , but really , must we do it ? 
  that 's constantine, 
  by the way , the soundcloud version ** does not ** work, 
  i ** ca n't still ** hear the souncloud version of the spoiled by choice , go figure, 
  yes , they did, 
  why not ? 
  end of the 20s and early 30s , remember the anschluss as well of the murder of the star of the team, 
  right now ? 
  the titel would be between ayala , guerron , guzman , alvarez , due\u00f1as and arevalo . 
  i do n't add gignac because he has been on the team for less than a season . 
  as for all time favorite ? 
  bato , boy , barbadillo and gaitan . 
  recordings , radio transcripts , official records , editorials, 
  i am going with a john oliver quote :, 
  `` why does neo-nazis always like metal ? '', 
  i still use my beige box ... 
  ** yes!yes!yes!yes!yes!yes!yes!yes!yes !, 
  check the huniepop video with his wife , genna . 
  it 's one of the best where tb use that joke, 
  yes , i remember . 
  poor sod , not only he got in trouble for the whole clusterfuck that are players ' contracts in any football league , but he went to a team that is beign accused of some really shady stuff .
