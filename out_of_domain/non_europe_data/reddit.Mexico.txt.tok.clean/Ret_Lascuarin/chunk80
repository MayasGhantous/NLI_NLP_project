  they brought ravel morrison on a loan from lazio , but they 're also looking to obtain daniel barbosa from braga . 
  * necaxa : the mat\u00edas fern\u00e1ndez deal is ~ ~ near completion ~ ~ [ official ] ( https://twitter.com/clubnecaxa/status/904816081784762368 ) , and outside of that there is just a rumor about octavio rivero from colo colo. 
  * puebla : after cutting alvaro navarro and federico gonzalez from the squad , they were left with salom as the only striker in the team . 
  they just bought lucas cavalini from pe\u00f1arol and are also looking to bring luis angel land\u00edn back from herediano . 
  * pumas : they 're trying to restart the negotiations with julio barroso of colo colo after gast\u00f3n silva signed with independiente . 
  * tigres : the most active of the bunch , they are close to sign timothe\u00e9 kolodziejczak from borussia m\u00f6nchengladbach , as well as midfielder [ larry v\u00e1squez of patriotas in colombia ] ( http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/2017/09/04/compras-de-panico-tigres-tambien-ficha-a-colombiano ) . 
  another done deal is the goalkeeper [ eduardo fern\u00e1ndez of real salt lake ] ( http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/2017/09/03/tigres-ficho-de-ultima-hora-a-guardameta-de-la-mls ) , who will enter as the second option during palos injury and as third option until miguel ortega returns from an injury . 
  * xolos : they just lost jorge ortiz , who was sent back early to independiente and then arrived to belgrano in a free deal . 
  they also almost lost enzo kalinski , thought that would n't be a loss at all . 
  edit : completly forgot about bola\u00f1os deal not being officialized by the time i wrote this post , he just arrived in a two seasons loan deal . 
  * lobos buap : they 're under constant media pressure and on a short budget due to their fight for a better tv deal against televisa .
