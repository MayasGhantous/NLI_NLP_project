  i hope him the best, 
  ... oh , ffs brain , not a day without being stupid . 
  so . . just to be sure , is kerzhakov still with the nt ? 
  wait , they are making a movie from a book that was not part of the main storyline ... a book that has no plot ... and this is the main concern ? 
  so far my memory goes , there is no non-white death eater . 
  dammit, 
  he , he ... i loved that film, 
  i. . . is it ... wrong to feel safe for living on a third world country , were internet is not at every corner and things like twitter are not the standard ? 
  good, 
  no offense , but it kind of put me off the fact that the ** again ** modified a script . 
  i just hate wrong translations , specially after rereading nietzsche and mann in their original language . 
  i just hate it . 
  on the other hand , its prision school , so topical . 
  though , i would be angry if they cut anything , like they did with the ones of the 90s . 
  let alone the economic mass , it is also one of the few places where i have seen people throwing bananas to brown people , specially from peru or bolivia . 
  considering what drug cartels do here at mexico to control the bloody market , it does deserve that , and more , spotlights, 
  depends on what theory you stand , to some in the academia `` localization '' is bad translation , since it prioritize the reader rather than the author . 
  i do n't know , people still talk about nge and sel , and prision school is very good , so i doubt people will stop talking about it . 
  maybe on this subreddit , since its mostly games , but not on places where they talk manga/anime . 
  1-0 , river losing, 
  ** yes !, 
  rewatching serial experiment lain and ghost in the shell, 
  yes i do , and i like prision school . 
  not as nge , mind you , since i have yet to write two entire notebooks of notes about it . 
  getting high never helps . 
  wait , gator action ? 
  also , amazing world and steam rolled, 
  wait ... so the hiccups are the reason that the span between mga1 and mga2 is of more than a year ? ... 
  ross , make a invisible plataform level for them , pretty please ? 
  who uses `` good god '' on the internet ? 
  oh come on , you are insulting any shameful display ever done in a chivalry game, 
   has there been a hushed history of white men who 've been strung up into trees by mobs ? 
  are white men frequently the target of the police ? 
  are white men disproportionately represented in the prison system ? 
  are white men targeted through the judicial system and jim crow laws in order to disenfranchise huge percentages of them from being able to vote ? 
  well ... yes , not in the usa , but kind of normal in europe , specially to white males from and in eastern european countries . 
  but go on , keep up the idea that american is the center of the world , surely you must feel proud . 
  oh ... poor arin , his mind will me - ( remembers about mga2 ), 
  ross , just torture him more , pretty please ? 
  * arin declares ross to be dead to him, 
  * ross goes to ny, 
  * ross mentions jontron, 
  ** ode to ross confirmed **, 
  thre questions , mr. rubberninja , the best rubberninja of the world by default, 
  1 . - have you finished undertale ? 
  what is your opinion on it ? 
  2 . - hows animation doing this days ? 
  3 . - have you continue playing the amazing world ? 
  for a moment i tought people were just exagerating . 
  i mean , no double-ds tits or a huge ass or anything weird and stupid like that . 
  then i read what the background said . 
  no , its just that japanese people , as a whole , prefer to distance themselves from politics . 
  hence why people began to talk about the no-army rule until the 60s , and also why the same right-wing nuts are still saying the same shit since the 70s without anyone caring to shut them up . 
  is n't it just the tits ? 
   for example tax incentives for films with female directors would certainly turn the heads of financiers . 
  yeah , that did n't work for germany . 
  have you ever wondered how did uwe boll made so many bad films ? 
  germany have those to companies that invested in culture . 
  those companies used them to evade taxes and throwing all those good intentions to the trash . 
  same thing will happen . 
  the will obtain jobs , for sure , but they will only be given those jobs that nobody wants , or they will look to create quick movies and overflow the market with bad product just for the sake of those sweet tax incentives . 
  school ? 
  dafuq dude , what class is for ? 
  look . 
  most of the people do not understand game development , they just see the end product . 
  think it like a movie , the common moviegoer really do n't see what happened behind the scenes , they just see the movie . 
  same with videogames . 
  they will only judge the final product because what happened behind the scenes is not important for them . 
  considering hernandez 's nature , i would be dissapointed if he did not responded donovan 's constant assholery with even worse assholery . 
  hell , i always wondered why cuauthemoc never punch him on the face . 
  lacan disagrees , reality exist without language . 
  and the austrian vanguards and post-modernist will tell you in a more culture and austrian way to sod off . 
  nah , i meant that time when he pissed on the field . 
  or when he just acts as an ass . 
  there are does that argue that reality exist by the language , or rather the idea of `` cognoser '' reality . 
  in other words , reality is what we can perceive . 
  which did you put ? 
  was it the one of docking in the katamari episode ? 
  d club stuff , there is one at a katamari episode and the ninjabread man episode . 
  also , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj5xhcntcki ) and [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/wugsrmeex6s?t=7m43s ), 
  still , on public ground . 
  could just go to the bathroom . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozhxbsan9m ) i just remember glazing over . 
  worse of all , i could n't even get mad at anything , due to being an excellent goal . 
  to call prision school as just a harem anime is as calling the godfather a family movie , it is there , but it is not the only element on it . 
  wait , 98 % ? 
  holy shit , they ca n't even manage to get the 100 % ? 
  jesus kim , get your shit together . 
  so peralta stars ; coronas , due\u00f1as and vela are on the bench ... 
  well , it was a good run ... 
  is river losing ? 
  tuca moves in misterious ways . 
  nah , its just fun to see this weird mash-ups that , presented to a mexican , looks like the were created as a joke . 
  also , been a while since i 've seen that name . 
  when was the last time they played ? 
  oh yeah , good ale tuca . 
  and people asks why did we sold tito villa . 
  no idea , i came late to the party . 
  by the time i discovered that a ) reddit existed , b ) totalbiscuit and other youtube personalities and c ) twitter is actually important , everyhting was already polarized to the extreme . 
  the idea of games having an agenda , analyzing games both with literary criticism and philosophy and misoginy already existed in conversations with fellow gamers .
