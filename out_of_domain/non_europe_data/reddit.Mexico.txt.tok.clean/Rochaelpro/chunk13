  not sure what latino guys from america actually think , but whenever i visit usa , especially houston , i always try to talk to black girls , who knows !, 
  maybe someday i will find my future wife in there . 
  you miss her and it 's normal , but as long as you keep answering her calls , you will not stop having those dreams . 
  b. . . but my beard :\\ ^ (, 
  yeah , and scoring the winning goal aww yeah !, 
  and this is why he does n't comment on reddit , 
  dude , get a puppy and walk it around in a park or something , puppies are girl magnets :d, 
  ohh . . well hello !, 
  i am mexican , ca n't confirm . 
  there is a difference between mexican-americans and mexicans . 
  because of stupid comments, 
  her father seems to be a great person . 
  damn . 
  this post made me want to go out and meet the love of my life , i think i will take a rest from reddit today :d, 
  well i met a lot of awesome people but not my future wife :d probably tomorrow !, 
  haha, 
  i ai n't even mad . 
  took 4 minutes to get to the front page of reddit , gg wp, 
  actually i thought that was funny haha . 
  seraph is so cute < 3 - < 3, 
  and there is a lot of ragers and trolls , be prepared to mute everyone every time you are in a game  but lol is awesome !, 
  i just ca n't stop playing, 
  done . 
  where is my skin ? 
  in low elo , you can place a ward and it will last there in the bush for the entire game xd, 
  we all know they do it for that reason . 
  the problem is that they went too far . 
  and yeah , that may be the reason , but their comments are just stupid , so are they for writing them . 
  that guy is totally bm, 
  * awkwardly holding the cup, 
  go to events or conventions , sometime people sell lol merchandising . 
  i bought a cute ninja rammus hat in an anime convention :d, 
  [ he looks like the awkward situation seal haha ] ( http://memeinnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/awkward_situation_seal.jpg ), 
  and hand him a beer , `` good job son ! '', 
  i 'd rather get a dog , they make you feel better when you feel sad , 
  - mooooooooooom , i know what i want to be when i grow up !!, 
  - son , you ca n't be a shoutcaster , you talk like a retard . 
  because they do n't use planes !, 
  cartels are not what they used to be a few years ago , armed groups now are probably a bunch of teenagers/kids with ak47 . 
  i think most of the veterans got killed or retired . 
  and even though mexico is n't still the safest place to live , it 's better now than it was 3-4 ~ years ago . 
  question for greentea :, 
  why blitz instead of the meta game supports that everyone else is using ? 
  do you think blitzcrank should be worth a ban in solo-queue ?

  because i am a fat fuck, 
  the korean ball licking is real, 
  well , the guy is putting facts on the table , he is not saying mexico is safe just because he is mexican . 
  look guys !, 
  i found someone who has never come to m\u00e9xico !!, 
  there you go genius , there is your 1-5 lmq , 
  awesome !, 
  you confirmed it , 
  now go back with him and wait until he miraculously heals !, 
  how much fetishes do you have man ? 
  yeah , people is stupid . 
  more,

  pls hire me m8, 
  haha wtf, 
  huehuehuehue i was getting tired of the fucking eu fanboys talking crap on c9 after their lose against all , now all of them will stfu, 
  i will tell you something that will sound a little harsh but this is the advice i always give to my friends . 
  if you really really want to win ranked games , stop playing lee sin , he is too fun , but he needs a lot of skill to be played correctly , skill that a bronze , silver or even a gold player does n't always have . 
  i am at gold 1 atm and went from gold 5 to 1 in one week just because i stopped playing champions with skillshots . 
  `` he might die today , but the only thing he thought about was me being his wife '', 
  well , come to mexico , i would not mind a foreigner girl chasing me :d !, 
  yeah got off the plane in poland and there 's a mob of chicks screaming my name , there 's no way i 'm getting out of the country w/o an std '', 
  bitch please . 
  this . 
  it does n't matter if she is into you or not because she is in a relationship . 
  it 's not `` wasting '' your time if you enjoy doing it , 
  hell yes . . women love penguins just as much as they love kitties and puppies . 
  why are you losing the freelo ? 
  i do n't get it, 
  `` worth ! '', 
  i can coach you !, 
  my game knowladge is really good but i ca n't play better than a platinum because i play with 15 fps, 
  i do n't know man , whoever who speak spanish knows that spanish accent ( from spain ) is really bad . 
  it gets really annoying after some time . 
  15 fps normally , 3 in teamfights . 
  yeah but the guy wants to circlejerk . 
  well , there is not enough oil because pemex sell oil to usa really cheap . 
  it 's like you are getting free oil from mexico that you do n't even need to bomb the fuck off us . 
  that 's so 2010 , even though drug war has not finished yet , it 's not like it used to be a few years ago . 
  \\ #worth, 
  wrong !, 
  i am mexican and when i visited usa ( as a tourist of course ) , every american i met tried to speak to me in spanish . 
  i was like `` dude , i came here to practice my english !, 
  stop talking to me in spanish please . . '', 
  it was funny , americans are great people when you get to know some of them . 
  just mexican-american or illegal immigrants say `` ese '' . . 
  in my 23 years of living here in mexico i 've never heard that word used in that context , but when i went to houston i heard it 2 or 3 times from mexicans haha, 
  and then they blame every reddit comment saying to `` break up '' . 
  common sense is not as common as it should be . 
  yeah when i finish my degree i want to travel to canada , and see if i can stay to work and live over there , but i am not sure yet :(,
