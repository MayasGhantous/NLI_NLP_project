  whenever i hear/read that word i imagine this [ guys ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_byi7mfv2g70/tplqsbmdapi/aaaaaaaaafk/q_cl28dpt9i/s1600/1462891987_l.jpg ) saying it . 
  seriously , we do n't speak like that . . 
  i went to texas !, 
  ( houston ) . 
  no problem bro !, 
  god bless kabum !, 
  actually , he said the girlfriend is 2 years older . . 
  and i do n't think the reason of her jealouslly is related to the other girl , she is just being insecure . 
  the problem here is the reaction of the girlfriend , it 's chidlish and stupid that she just wants to let the guy read her mind . 
  the reaction is the reason most of us think the girl is just insecure because bf kissed another girl . 
  it 's something called the `` comfort zone '' . 
  i love you too man :'), 
  well , he has a beard . 
  beard gives conffidence , that 's why asians seem so shy in camera :( ), 
  edit . 
  i forgot to add [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ninsy5c.png ), 
  do you still talk to martin ?

  2 things, 
  1 . - people make mistakes she is just 21 , that 's the age that some ( not all of us ) people do mistakes . 
  2 . - she is with you now , try to be as happy as you can , you ca n't never know if your so is gon na cheat , just try to make her as happy as you can and expect for the best . 
  i love how people criticizing mexico is not even mexican . 
  source : i am mexican . 
  skillcap = / = decision making, 
  it 's because he is toxic , that 's why he is so worried and had to make this post , 
  hey , i was talking about op commenting on your comment , not about you . . 
  i am just toxic towards other toxic persons , so you are not wrong at all xd, 
  i was gon na say a gay joke butt fuck it .

  [ serious ] how can you play 10 ranked games as quinn without getting banned for trolling ? 
  have you seen a shaco late game ? 
  it 's nothing close to an assassin !, 
  yeah , get cced and you die in 2 seconds if not less . . 
  yeah , you really expect a bronze , silver or even gold player to expect how to split push ? 
  `` omg report shaco , let us fight 4 v 5 zomg , fucking noob . '', 
  `` and then i met janna :\\ ^ ) '', 
   she has past issues on the subject,

  i am not a native english speaker but that grammar mistake pisses me off whenever i read it . 
  `` special person '', 
  she is dumb , say it like it is . 
  where did you live in mexico ?

  ( today ), 
  `` especially after mexican food . '', 
  excepto los canadienses , esos son un amor < 3, 
  [ pendejes se intensifica ], 
  yeah , i had to watch the video again . 
  as a non native english speaker i was glad someone posted the text too . 
  what can you do in that position ? 
  when most girls say size does n't matter , it actually matters , but how can you react to that ? 
  knowing that you have a micro-p . . and knowing that it will be a deal breaker for most girls . 
  i feel sad for that guy :(, 
  and then nuke the shit out of you !, 
  me too , that 's why i play champs that deppend on decision making more than skill based champs ( lee sin , zed , etc. . ), 
  i got to platinum 4 playing warwick jungle , janna/support , rumble top ( those carry ults ) , trist/miss fortune adc . 
  hey , it happened the same with a girl i dated once . . but it was her boobies that tasted like latex , what the hell is going on ? 
  yeah , i dated a girl once and when i kissed her boobs , they tasted like latex , no joke . 
  it was probably some kind of soap or skin cream or something because most of the time we had sex , it was after both of us took a shower at my house . 
  no mames g\u00fcey !, 
  its name is `` 3 veces te enga\u00f1e '', 
  the singer in the video is `` paquita la del barrio '', 
  but you can find the song with other artists :, 
  i do n't know who else , but you can google the name of the song :p, 
  like a phoenix , we will reborn from the ashes !, 
  just kidding , i love my country but sometimes hate my people . 
  ( i am mexican ), 
  most of the people i know does n't use drugs , and we are talking of middle class people . 
  legalizing drugs may not solve the problem , but it surely helps . 
  90-95 % of those deaths were from people related to cartels anyway . 
  do n't mess with the bull , you will get the horns . 
  the food trucks are the best haha , i will make your wish come true some day !, 
  my ex 's name was diana . 
  everytime i play against that champ , i try my best to kick the shit out of her . 
  go on . . 
  nah man , the eagle on our flag is one of the few things we can feel proud of right now . 
  i love the culture , the food , history and what our ancestors did for us . 
  i am sure that mexico , as a country , could be a first world country , we could even have a better infraestructure than usa and a better quality of life but you can see what i mean reading some of the comments on this thread . 
  i hate people who blames the government for every fail in the country , i hate people who ca n't blame themselves for the conditions we live in . 
  the kind of people who says `` there is not enough job opportunities '' , it makes me rage and i just want to answer them `` man , there is job opportunities for people who is prepared , get a fucking book and learn some useful skills so you can find a good job and stop blaming the government for every stupid thing that happens in your life '' . 
  i could write a wall of text explaining why the government and the cartels would not be a huge menace for people 's prosperity , yeah it affects , but the people is fucked up because that 's how they want to fucking be . 
  yeah , they benefit themselves . 
  being optimistic american/canadian companies pay :,
