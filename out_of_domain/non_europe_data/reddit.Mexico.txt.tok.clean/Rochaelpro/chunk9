  what the hell did you smoke dude ? 
  tecate is not that bad dude . . 
  source . 
  mexican and drink tecate, 
  there is 3 types of tecate , i prefer this [ tecate light ] ( http://www.unafotoaldia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/299-366.jpg ), 
  this is the most common [ tecate ] ( http://www.exito.com/images/products/926/0000579508871926/0000579509135861_xl_a.jpg ) but i do n't like it to be honest and that 's the one they want to export . 
  [ this ] ( http://thepoint.mx/www/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tecate-titanium.jpg ) is the new tecate , i love this one but i get drunk too fast when i drink it :( it has more alcohol than the other 2 . 
  i do n't know which one you are refering to , but tecate light and titanium taste really good , the red one not that much . 
  have you ever tried tecate light ? 
  i do n't like any other light beer but tecate is really good , and you should definitely try the titanium , 
  yeah haha that 's what i 'm talking about in my other comment, 
  i do n't know man , never tried bud light platinum before : o, 
  how much weeks left btw ? 
  eg is a `` new '' team , they will improve and might be top 3 for the next season .

  you did n't feel the pain us mexicans felt when he dove .
