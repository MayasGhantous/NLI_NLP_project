  did you dismantle the hre or did it collapse ? 
  it is out of principle dammit !, 
  `` what 's the way you millennials do anything ? 
  pull your phones and google what i asked . '', 
  you are thinking of wwi and the zimmerman telegram . 
  ** spanish asia/korea *, 
  these are the ones i tried using in a personal mod for the same thing ( now forever lost ) :, 
  [ monarchy ] ( https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/attachments/unon-of-latin-america-png.142206/ ), 
  [ communist ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/conworld/images/0/05/latin_america_flag.svg/revision/latest?cb=20090131090714 ), 
  [ republic ] ( http://orig13.deviantart.net/ea8c/f/2010/247/3/4/latin_american_union_flag_by_blamedthande-d2y150f.png ), 
  the game of thrones is pretty good and regularly updated , probably the mod that fits the best to ck2 's mechanics . 
  overall i would say it is the best ck2 total conversion mod . 
  the warhammer geheimnisnacht mod is n't as complete in that sense but i still find it quite entertaining , particularly if you like warhammer . 
  there is also the elder scrolls mod ( elder kings ) , but you will probably have to roll back to another version and i would n't call it a `` complete '' project yet . 
  it is great if you like those games though . 
  i have no idea what happened with the lord of the rings mod but at some point it existed . 
  `` when the world stopped making sense '' is immediatly after the fall of the western roman empire and adds all sorts of tiny/forgotten religions all over the map for extra conflict . 
  as mentioned after the end is a great post apocalyptical mod focused on north america .

  [ after the end ] ( https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/831384 ) forum, 
  some require you to log into the forums and some may not be up to date yet ( but as far as i know they are still in development ) . 
  i strongly recommend the agot mod , it should probably be the one others compare to . 
  you are welcome . 
  ... but they are catholic ... 
  * y-axis, 
  what happened to the protestants ? 
  none of you seem close enough to europe to have an impact . 
  as above , england is already what you aspire for endgame , not to mention you can screw everyone else in the world quite easily and mantain complete hegemony . 
  besides that there is not really any problem with it , you just have everything much easier . 
  [ best friends forever / s ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1890_british_ultimatum ), 
  meh , for a time portugal was totally into an united iberia ( at one point being set to lead it [ even ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/miguel_da_paz,_prince_of_portugal ) ), 
  well surely the royals would n't ( and did n't ) care . 
  galileo was `` persecuted '' because he decided to be an ass , asserting his position without a definitive way of proving it ( his model was even wrong ) to the scientific community of his day ( the church ) and , to top it all off , when asked to write a book about both heliocentrism and geocentrism , decided instead to indirectly insult the pope ( his friend , patron and ruler of the land ) . 
  at that point it is surprising how easy he got off the hook . 
  typical youtube drama , really . 
  in short , a guy going by the name the skeptic feminist ( a self described feminist ) allegedly shot and killed his girlfriend . 
  in a following [ stream ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hpsbap3enoy ) of various `` skeptic community '' members , some of them made fun of the irony of a self described feminist murdering a woman . 
  several people , mostly from the `` other camp '' ( the feminist community ) , were outraged about these comments . 
  thunderfoot [ joined ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2tqxnhtxyig ) on this , having a similar opinion being outraged at jokes being made 24 hours after the fact . 
  however , thunderfoot suddenly `` switching sides '' and , in a response video , misrepresenting sargon 's comments ( editing the video to make it seem he was joining in the `` fun '' ) caused [ backlash ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8uw7pztbq ) . 
  so ... youtube drama as usual . 
  huh , did n't know that . 
  but i do seem to remember sargon made a video showing the comparison between thunderf00t 's video and the stream . 
  pray for a storm to do all the work and utterly fail at a counterattack ? 
  umm ... does n't he declare himself a god in the first episode ? 
  oh , my bad ... completely sane and rational . 
  well , he also intends to make the world a better place by killing all the undesirables . 
  perhaps , but it certainly helps . 
  what about killing lind l. taylor because he declared he would arrest him for his crimes ? 
  or the many others involved in the investigation ? 
  or those tangentially related to the investigation ? 
  how is that not evil ? 
  even his original idea of only killing convicted criminals already is evil , who is he to judge and execute potentially innocent people ( one of the main argument against the death penalty ) . 
  we know for sure he makes mistakes and sometimes kills the wrong guy , but that does n't even faze him . 
  how is he not evil from the very beginning he starts using the death note for the explicit purpose of cleansing and ruling the world through fear of being executed ? 
  sure , he obviously does n't see himself as evil , that would be silly , but in what way is n't he ? 
  [ this guy ? 
  ] ( http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/claude_frollo ), 
  were he to fulfill his mission , everyone would live in a perpetual state of divine punishment for the smallest transgressions of the law under a seemingly omnipresent and omnipotent overseer . 
  even if we were to ignore his methods ( which we obviously should n't ) , we ca n't possibly ignore the consequences of his actions , especially if they are achieved exactly as he envisioned them . 
  and i do question his motives , his constant rambling clearly state his desire for control and power over his lesser of peers . 
  he believes he knows better , that he is better and that is why he so easily imposes his will on others . 
  under any consideration he is inmoral and unethical , when he is presented chances to redeem himself he redoubles his conviction , no one and nothing stands on his way , he even throws hissy fits whenever he is outsmarted . 
  i do n't see how could he not be evil . 
  well he did a good amount of genocide ... 
  yet he could n't save himself from bullets ... or his own mouth really . 
  may have something to do with half of all their stories taking place around high schools , even when it makes absolutely no sense to do so . 
  hera , i believe . 
  perhaps hate is n't the right word , they did however consider them quite inferior to men . 
  also much of the gay aspect usually gets blown out of proportion . 
  looks like you are trying to get people on a list, 
  to be fair , eloping is pretty tame compared to the rest of the family business . 
  in episode 2 he kills a `` detective '' thinking it is l. 
  is n't there any low he wo n't step to !? 
  and you know ... lebanese muslims massacring lebanese jews , christians and wrong-denomination muslims ... 
  was . 
  the government before the civil war was pretty west aligned ( in contrast to movements moving towards the ussr or the pan-arabic movements ) . 
  basically , the entire economy is in disarray ( with a lot to do on being completely dependant on the price of oil ) , the populace is in upheaval and the government seems to continuously become more repressive by the day . 
  all of this keeps feeding into a vicious cycle with no good end in sight, 
  ~ ~ the pope was allied to the turks , italy attacked , turke joined on the defense , italy annexed the pope by fully occupying him , turkey remains as the defensive war leader so the liberate casus belli is automatically added . ~ ~, 
  italy annexed the pope as an added wargoal ( who was a minor participant in a war against italy ) . 
  his allies automatically get a liberation casus belli . 
  since they were quickly full-occupied and their allies ca n't reach them easily , italy had no real problems taking them out first . 
  whoops , tunnel vision . 
  thanks, 
  empire i imperialist subhuman , obviously, 
   also while romance languages tend to only have two genders , they 're way more random than german nouns . 
  it is like you are doing it on purpose to screw with us ... 
  not to mention all of the french and english words that keep the original pronunciation and break your own rules, 
  i would n't say middle ages , renaissance age probably , early modern age for sure . 
   poor canada , so far from god , so close to the united states . 
  - some guy , probably, 
  one does not simply find mordor on a map . 
  i would honestly be more concerned by the amount of votes they got after knowing these things, 
  i know , but starting out it is very confusing ( especially after learning how to pronounce things and then learning to identify other languages ' words in there ),
