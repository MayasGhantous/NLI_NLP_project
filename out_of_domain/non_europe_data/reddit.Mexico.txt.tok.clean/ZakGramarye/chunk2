  i still find that words ending in - e being feminine is less prevalent that , for example , words ending in - a being feminine in spanish . 
  also having many cases with the genders being reversed is n't very easy for someone already used to gendered nouns . 
  the example of sun and moon was because in spanish it is the other way around and i find german seems to have way more exceptions to its rules , especially regarding pronunciation . 
  you ca n't break the rules if there are none !, 
  huh , that is weird . 
  i would consider mexico city the lgbt mecca in mexico . 
  [ they signed their confession !,

  according to kotor it was n't always a complete desert and many different life forms thrived there until an unspecified catastrophe happened . 
  while it is a desert there still are minerals to be had . 
  hpm , probably . 
  it is mexico city alright, 
  precipitaci\u00f3n , then, 
  i mean , it is not [ rocket science ... ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dkaurmbnz40 ), 
  climate change is a factor , but this problem comes mostly from the massive increase in the population without the appropriate growth in the agricultural and services sectors ( hindered greatly by severe droughts ) . 
  but he was probably referring to the stereotype and the jokes about latvia 's economy ( and population subsistence ) being based in the potato ( the one they have ), 
  it seems a bit unfair to place so much blame on the west , the policies of said countries do play a big part in escalating the problems they face . 
  the assyrians are christians and and descendants from the babylonians . 
  thay are amongst some of the most persecuted peoples , being targeted a by numerous sorrounding muslim groups . 
  [ this 2 minute video pretty much sums it up ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubqvpyp7qse ), 
  you probably left an empty space ( probably at the very end ) or unclosed one in the localization files you edited, 
  [ the british way ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/4x4uas/the_british_way/ ), 
   southern california, 
  well you are probably used to northern mexican accents which are considered kinda harsh , overly direct/honest and not too `` fluid '' ( is fluid an appropriate way of describing a language in english ? ), 
  how could they know about it if not even them can understand one another ? 
  also plattdeutsch ( the frisian one ) is even harder for me, 
  \u00a1 la retiene !, 
  only if you are their cultural union tag . 
  communists , but their numbers are dwarfed by radical islamists . 
  they are a mod that requires another to function . 
  they are optional files that add or modify content but that have not been incorporated into the main download , usually because some prefer not to have them but still want the other changes . 
  just put their folder and mod file into the mod subfolder of victoria 2 ( not the one in documents , put them in the installation one ) . 
  then in the launcher select the main mod ( hpm ) and its submods . 
   akbar , a mughal ruler of the *** 16th century modern day india *** , was said to have owned 9,000 cheetahs, 
  he is n't england, 
   no downside, 
  he is dead, 
  i still prefer victoria 2 's light blue greece, 
  18 dev for a late game russia is n't really that much of a difference, 
  he is the father, 
  but we had not enough disgusting grey in the game !, 
  adding to this , the first merchant you encounter ( reynald ? ), 
  sells rusty versions of all weapons, 
   the counterpart to agnatic succession would be cognatic succession, 
  would n't it actually be enatic succession , in which only females inherit, 
   it 's so awkward to read ... or speak ...

  pfft , just grind pikachu until he reaches level 15 , learn double team , spam it in the battle and quick attack until you win . 
  it is treason , then . 
  in a similar way , hungary forming the pact of rome forces italy to lead said faction ( you ca n't refuse ), 
  [ jus soli ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli ) is pretty rare outside america, 
  oddly enough , that is how the protestant reformation started , a more literal interpretation of the scriptures . 
  how !? 
  what did you do !? 
  also , why did you delay your war ? 
  is n't it easier to attack the pacific states and the usa as soon as as the civil war breaks out ? 
  iirc you can force an event peace with both the usa and psa if you advance enough into their territory , getting a choice between southern california , all of california or all of the psa in this case ; also the entente ca n't really challenge you if you push through the mountains . 
  as always , minors must push their wars as early as possible to avoid majors ( lol , the entente really does n't qualify ) creating the long term slog of beating their factions . 
  you only miss out on a few because of the map changes ( the most annoying/obscure one being the one in the roof of the shadowfort during the salvation quest ), 
  [ i claim this land in the name of king philip of spain !,

  you have lost as many men as the other side and your allies combined ... while still having 62 m in reserves ... 
  also , what is up with the soviets ? 
  even when i intervene they are reannexed as soon as the truce is up , it is quite sad to look away for an instant and return to a half occupied mess . 
  usa is way op . 
  [ colored buttons ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=699235856 ) , [ more theatre icons ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=703017353&amp;searchtext=more+theatre ) , [ more division icons ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=699735138 ) , [ hoi3 soundtrack ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=927054084 ) and [ player led peace conferences ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=846066944&amp;searchtext= ) are good for any game . 
  additionally , [ more manpower from noncores ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=700890435&amp;searchtext= ) and whichever focus trees you may want to add, 
  bigger mods ( do n't mix any mods that change the map ) :, 
  * [ vanilla + ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=720937262&amp;searchtext=vanilla+%2b ) if you like the game as is ( you have to roll back to an earlier version ), 
  * [ the great war ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=699709023 ) for wwi , my preferred choice, 
  * [ road to 56 ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=820260968 ) for more options and a longer game, 
  * [ millenium dawn ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=719416488 ) for modern world, 
  [ increased resources ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=748970320 ) and [ ultimate states \\ ( breaks up many states \\ ) ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=891719743&amp;searchtext=ultimate+states ) both change the map but you may want to consider them, 
  [ kaiserreich ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=809903394 ) only if you spent a considerable amount of time explaining the different paths and their outcomes to everyone, 
  also , if you want an easier time ( specially for the offline version ) switch to sorcerer , equip holy affinity , bring plenty of demon periapts , use them four at a time and spam holy focused bolts . 
  select an army, 
  select the naval invasion icon, 
  choose a port you or your allies control, 
  select your objective ( preferably an enemy port or adjacent tile ), 
  wait for the divisions to prepare ( you can shorten the time by assigning less divisions to many different ports ), 
  get naval supremacy over all sea zones in the way of the invasion, 
  launch the invasion, 
  assign marines and logistics companies to the invasion for better results, 
  definitely faster than mk ( though i am not absolutely sure about assassin 's ) . 
  you also save a lot of time and inventory space from not needing to set up all the time and not needing arrows . 
   never bothered with maelstrom, 
  `` then you are lost ! '', 
  but seriously , it is the most satisfying spell in the game . 
  and now you do n't . 
  ca n't argue with results . 
  and you prefer to work text and images together in word ? 
  meh , it holds italia and half of hispania , it is closer to the roman empire than the germanic mess we usually see,
