  but athens starts as catholic italians on orthodox greek land ... 
  it would be kukulkan 's pyramid or temple since kukulkan ( the mayan version of quetzalcoatl , the feathered serpent ) is the god it is dedicated to . 
  or as the archeologists call it , `` chichen itza structure 5b18 '' ( what a creative bunch ) . 
   give them back to the us,

  many people were for it or mostly indifferent , but the opposing party made a big fuss about such `` unpatriotic '' behavior . 
  how is lord of the rings not the one for new zealand !, 
  the monstrosity in south america should probably be some variation of peru since it all was part of the viceroyalty of peru . 
  also , why no great colombia ? 
  should probably add that cape colony is high priority as it alone gives you the merchant from the trade company . 
  that is weird , the cape ( the only province with a trade modifier ) trumps everything there . 
  i once had a game where portugal owned everything except for that and i still got the merchant . 
  where is that map from ? 
  it is like a weird mix of state borders from all over history ( get rekt nuevo le\u00f3n ), 
  `` indio '' is still somewhat used to refer to amerindians/native americans in spanish , though it is definitely never used in formal speak/settings and is usually seemed as ( at least ) vulgar . 
  [ they did use such a flag for a long time , ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/pavillon_royal_de_france.svg ) 1365-1792 and 1815-1830 to be precise, 
  ironically , the same thing happened right back to the english , ruining their counter offensive . 
  almost all flags were mostly naval , the concept of state was quite different , usually being seen as family posesions and being represented by convoluted family coats of arms . 
  it depends entirely on context , but it is considerably less touchy than in english . 
  you may refer to your friends like this without issue , you might also use them on family or some aquaintances , but you would n't just start a conversation with a stranger by addressing them by the color or their skin . 
  moreno simply means dark-skinned ( everything between tan and darkish brown but usually excluding black ) . 
  people appealing to emotion to get something out of someone . 
  it is not a bad decision , i remember removing the restrictions on switching between christian branches for a personal mod and lithuania consistently converted to orthodox at game start . 
  on the other hand franz was a government key figure and its major opposer to war . 
  the first crusade was an absolute success , defeating multiple superior forces and achieving all its objectives ( except returning most of the land to byzantium , but that was their fault for abandoning the crusaders ) . 
  it was the other ones that were failures . 
  [ the great leap forward ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_leap_forward ) caused the great chinese famine .

   does the definition of `` gay `` a require a pair of creatures to have gay sex ? 
  there must be a sexual preference for the same gender , so basically yes . 
  sure , guerrilla movements are the solution to every problem , there is no way it could make things worse / s, 
  so the capital should have been abandoned after the sack in the conquest to preserve it ? 
  at the time of mexico city 's construction the ruins were still smoldering .

   guerrillas and revolutionaries overthrew madero, 
  no they did n't , madero was overthrown and murdered in a coup d'etat by the man he put in charge of the army backed by the us ambassador in mexico . 
   the spirit of [ ... ] zapata , mag\u00f3n and villa live today in the ezln, 
  villa was kind of an authoritarian prick in favor of workers rights, 
  the mag\u00f3n brothers were anarchist nutjobs who tried to take over lower california, 
  the fact that the ezln uses zapata 's name is an weird considering he has nothing to do with marxism . 
   the political system has had its time to prove itself and failed, 
  the most significant factors for any of the prosperity mexico has ever seen are peace and stability . 
  have you forgotten the disastrous effects of the absolute chaos of the xviii ( edit : 18th ) century after the independence ? 
  in spanish ( and several romance languages ) we use roman numerals for centuries, 
  no need , i was wrong using the spanish convention when writing in english, 
   villa has no real ideology except that he was pro-worker and a bit savage . 
   the mag\u00f3n brothers did n't really have a cohesive ideology, 
  and you say their spirit lives on in the ezln ? 
  the only thing these groups had in common was their opposition to the porfirian regime and their ascended status given to them by the post-revolutionary government, 
   mexico needs a revolution to get rid of the corruption and government . 
  maybe a wall to rid themselves of american trade but eh . 
  no we do n't . 
  nothing good will come from a violent ( and even worse , incompetent ) movement nor from cuting economic ties with our largest trade partner , who also happens to be the freaking usa , they have wrecked countries over bananas and we are in no position to openly defy them . 
  in mexico ( and i imagine it is the same in all hispanic countries ) we get [ these nice paperback ones ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/07/0f/84/070f84c606676527b96cee601d1b21f1.jpg ), 
  we get the normal 5 books , each about 300 mxn ( about 16.88 usd each ) for paperback and around 800 mxn ( 45 usd ) for hard covers . 
  the hard covers vary wildly in design ( [ 1 ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kl_3dk7x7za/vltlj6pndwi/aaaaaaaakbc/7pgymylm7m4/s1600/portadas%2b%25c3%2589xitos%2b001%2b-%2b005%2b-%2bcanci%25c3%25b3n%2bde%2bhielo%2by%2bfuego.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://libreriatecnicosleo.com/8080-8392-thickbox/cancion-de-hielo-y-fuego-edicion-limitada-de-1000-pasta-dura-ed-de-lujo-firmada.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c0qxzscsqxi/u6gfsaizwii/aaaaaaaaavy/rpiuqlmg9xw/s1600/t4.jpg ) ), 
  same case really , most of the innovations associated with that period came from india, 
  all of those came from outside of islam though , mostly from ancient greeks , indians and pre-islam persians, 
  this is pretty rare and probably unique to mexico , but there have been cases of kids named `` aniv de la rev '' , usually born in the 30th of november . 
  for those unfamiliar with mexican history , it is/was tradition to name kids after the saint celebrated the day of their birth ( pretty common in many christian countries ) . 
  parents just look at what it says on the calendar . 
  the 20th of november is the day of the anniversary of the mexican revolution , shortened in small calendars as `` aniv . 
  de la rev. '', 
  thankfully we now have laws that limit parents from giving any name they like if it could potentially cause harm ( bullying ) to the child . 
  the worst part is battles in which you lose no planes and damage ( not sink ) ships being considered `` defeats '', 
  \u00bf petencioso ? 
  why religious first ? 
  muslims ? 
  if so , why not expand via vassals first ? 
  why integrate naples before feeding them most of italy ?

  [ ryukyu too strong pls nerf ] ( https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/the-three-mountains-a-ryukyu-aar.709144/ ), 
  yes the cost will go up , but it is still lower than coring and you get to keep your admin . 
  you do n't necessarily need to force convert your maghreb vassal , just feed them all + coring cost land and delay until you get spain 's + religious insane conversion speed ( even better if you go after the extra missionaries ) . 
  early on you do n't get the most out of religious ideas , unless you are planning around extensive use of the deus vult cb , which should n't be a big issue if you go through the maghreb vassal ( tlemcen almost always gets eaten by morocco and tunis , so they are usually my go to vassal ), 
  loosing out on the early pi is over shadowed by some other idea groups , in my opinion ( like coring cost or tech discounts which are better the earlier you get them ), 
  being an absurdly cartonishly evil government , deliberately pissing off your population , is the best way to push socio-political reforms . 
  it is specially important for any nation dependant on immigration . 
  what part of the theocratic absolute monarchy that is the heavenly kingdom made you think this would n't happen ? 
  12 is n't that much ... 
  do n't look directly at the sun !, 
  if you are already somewhat familiar with the game , pick a medium sized country and make it into a super power . 
  learn the ropes with brazil , a small fish in a small pond sorrounded by even smaller fish . 
  take spain and restore its colonial empire . 
  take mexico and learn the true meaning behind the saying : `` poor mexico , so far from god , so close to the united states '', 
  why not a populous uncivilized nation to lead to global significance ? 
  or if you are into power fantasies , unifying greater germany is very satisfying if you can deal with being so ridiculuosly op . 
  the only thing i do n't recommend is auto-pilot ( the usa ) , i find it way too boring ( coming from a guy who enjoyed playing as a balkan nation ), 
  regarding the army , prioritize tactics and artillery techs and make sure to fill your back row with artillery . 
  also try to rush tech points , pop growth and railroads in that order . 
  big armies usually come from big core pops or a ridiculously large colonial empire, 
  you missed a tiny spot between thrace and iran, 
  not while we still hold the ducal titles !, 
  by exploiting chains of alliances you can more or less pull most countries into a war and since most of them are less than 4 provinces , it is easy to occupy them and convert or force release their lands .
