add sailing first, 
  i would like a central marketplace where each house sell their stuff and you need like 60 % favour in piscarillus to steal from the stalls . 
  piscarillus : fish stall, 
  hosiiuds : seed and cake stalls, 
  shayzien : weapon stall ( small chance to steal a rune scimitar ? ), 
  make it like the dorgesh-kaan marketplace where you see npcs talking about different stuff, 
  add more npc men , women , wizards , dark wizards , necromancers to kill , talk , pickpocket etc. 
  more monsters to kill , like giant rats , goblins , wolves ,, 
  mammoth , ents maybe ? 
  more fishing and normal mining spots , add a river or a lake with ducks ... 
  dont delete that small hogoblin peninsula . 
  plz keep the hogoblin peninsula i like that one, 
  a he ? 
  i remember that i unlocked this song as a f2p fishing on karamja docks, 
  panic buy canoes, 
  this is a great idea and deserves more recognition, 
  no ur wrong, 
  mages of zamorak are a race ? 
  dude i just had this new and original idea !!, 
  how about we restrict trading and stop people killing each other to bypass the trade restriction ?? 
  that prevents rwt and stop bots !!, 
  add it on steam, 
  smithing level to make that ? 
  a new spell to make wines of zamorak failed twice on polls i dont think its jagex fault, 
  what kind of yu gi oh is this ? 
  now it is `` this doesnt feel oldschool to me , so no '', 
  pro tip : bots will use plank making spell, 
  like an ent boss ? 
  i miss penguins so much, 
  spanish where ? 
  [ runefest 2015 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j73cgzp9nqs ), 
  around minute 23, 
  been there since release dude ... 
  seems like a good idea for raids, 
  i meant like a mini-boss in a raid where you need skills to defeat it, 
  that way raids can offer skilling items ( magic logs , herbs , ores , bars etc ) without devaluing actual skilling , teams would have to include skillers and protect them in raids ( or include ppl with good overall levels ), 
  ban ali morrisane first ... hes the real scammer, 
  poor mod mat k not the right moment for him, 
  tell emily to get in there, 
  minor bug, 
  [ context ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vz6jomidku ), 
  well negro means black in spanish, 
  she can stop streaming and hop worlds, 
  pking with untradeables, 
  but they still can dedicate some time to focus on emily needs, 
  well ronan just said that no one reported him , and that he got banned beacause they looked at his chat history just for appearing in that stream, 
  link https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/4jymhu/streamer_favoritism_mmk_giving_me_a_bologna_3_day/d3atagc, 
  maybe if this gets like 300 upvotes, 
  confirmed , still there, 
  except ronan said that no one reported them, 
  oh yeah ... because new players cant get teleblocked , nice logic, 
   way to lose your temper and generalize all americans . 
  you do n't see the hypocrisy in your statement ? 
  . . hmmmmm ... 
  you need urgent help, 
  lol people want to turn slayer into profit skill , hey i want to make bank hunting ferrets ... not every monster can be profitable, 
  distractions & diversions ? 
  share penguin locations please, 
  lol an then i see people wanting it reverted, 
  stop fishing them at witchaven, 
  dude people complained about this on release day, 
  destroying what ? 
  monty phyton jokes ? 
  how these do not fit into oldschool ? 
  lol you are getting downvoted for having a different opinion, 
  idc about how some cosmetic items look, 
  i do care about combat , gameplay , new ways to train skills , to explore , quest etc. . . 
  oh thank you !!!, 
  now i can pronounce beer and bear !!!, 
  no / s, 
  well i said apache helicopter, 
  i also loved the golden sun cover , good memories, 
  to my knowledge hispanic just means that you are from a spanish speaking country , you can be black , amerindian , brown , white hispanic, 
  prejudice against a nationality is called xenophobia, 
  well 3 real life friends and me started playing because of f2p and ge, 
  nah mod mat k said that osrs was getting more real players than rs3 a year ago, 
  well latino is a contraction from `` latinoamericano '' ( latin american ) so it means a person from a country that used to be spain and portugal colonies hence the `` latin '', 
  elf mourners, 
  spoilers : : : :, 
  but lathas lied because hes evil his brother tyras was the good guy, 
  99 defense to protect his virginity, 
  and if sailing pases a poll in the future ppl gon na say that sailing copied this, 
  pvmers and skillers dont want to go to the wildy but feel forced to , i dont understand how ppl think that adding skilling or pvm stuff in wilderness help pvp . 
  is not like ppl go there and die while trying to do a clue or rcing and then somehow they love pvp and the pvp comunity, 
  but i think that `` forcing '' people that dont want to pvp into pvp , alienates both comunities , thats why you see abyss rcers `` crying '' when they get killed for a glory , people splashing on dark crabs , people hating on pures , calling the pvp comunity `` toxic '' etc. 
  wait lem me buy 10m antidotes before polling this, 
  not here, 
  a playlist is a better idea imo, 
  it looks good imo , it just need more head movement, 
  i belive that new account creation requires captcha, 
  [ osrs has more new players than rs3 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/2q3yjg/osrs_has_more_new_players_then_rs3_does/ ), 
  nah ppl just want more recolored wizard robes, 
  how about a t-80 sword looks like leaf bladed same stats as whip or tentacle ?? 
  really ? 
  hell remove world hoping thats sooooo easyscape it 's your fault chosing that world with ppl already in that spot, 
  yes , that poll failed , but they were repolled recently, 
  dude we have camo ...
