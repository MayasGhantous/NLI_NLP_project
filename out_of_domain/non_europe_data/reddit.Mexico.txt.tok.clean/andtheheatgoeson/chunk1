i 'm new to baseball ( started to follow it this year ) , but damn if vin did n't have an impressive career until the end . 
  and that tribute video :'(, 
  fuck the cardinals, 
  just shut down the bloody mics , ffs, 
  oklahoma city . 
  is n't sexual assault also illegal ? 
  username checks out, 
  i think you confused trump with hillaria and vice-versa . 
  unless this is a joke, 
  you had one job cubs, 
  lol a friend 's father who lives in chicago told me that trump tower is not that nice . 
  sure , it has a nice architecture ( because he was forced to ) but the interiors ' material are tacky and ( especially ) cheap . 
  rename it willis tower and the sears can get its original name again . 
  ca n't wait to see the national hunt of rose o'donnell !, 
  christ , are the cubs going to the route of the golden state warriors ? 
  ** thanks to taylor swift for not releasing an album this year **, 
  we did it reddit, 
  more like, 
  ` yes ', 
  it was like , 29 other teams . 
  blew a 3-1 lead in the nba finals series . 
  it was more in the sense of choking and giving away their lead in the series . 
  thor 's amazing performance in the wc game died for this :(, 
  thank you so much cub-bros . 
  the bs is finally gone . 
  now win it all and make that fucking goat bbq . 
  do n't forget california !, 
  because he was a dem when he wanted that , duh, 
  truly the poor 's man version of eybs, 
  da real mvp, 
  to be fair , even with the dirt cheap tickers , it 's hard to go to their stadium given that it is n't in a good spot of the city ( kinda far and dealing with the traffic ), 
  yeah , the old parque delta/seguro social place is a better location than foro sol . 
  too bad that nowadays that bloody mall exists there . 
  ugh , my wish is to see that eyesore demolished and get a new ballpark to host an ( unlikely ) expansion team for the mlb ; either in that place , or , if the old airport 's land can be properly developed , get the new ballpark there . 
  4d chess . 
  bugger off trump, 
  you confused the genders, 
  keep dreaming about destroying her, 
  he endorsed her tho, 
  thanks m8 !, 
  ouch . 
  what the hell is going on ? 
  eybs is still ded, 
  flares and a watson hugging a guy dressed in a blue suit while he 's playing keyboards . 
  the usual suspects ? 
  on mobile , no link, 
  mad max : fury road . 
  fucked is an understatement, 
  ah , the jill stein protest vote i see, 
  every single person knew inviting trump was a bad idea from the get-go , yet he and his finance secretary did n't care and still invited clownstick . 
  they 're that stupid . 
  reforms in labour laws , telecommunications , the oil company ( pemex ) , finances ... 
  even if they have good intentions ( i doubt it ) , they come a little bit late ; the moment for reforms was in the 90s and the the 00s , but his own party ( and himself ) blocked the proposals back then for political gain, 
  what will be the name of this series ? 
  the `` they used to be great cities '' series . 
  ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ joke ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ kill ^ ^ ^ me, 
  edit : christ guys , it 's a bloody joke . 
  i do n't know cleveland beyond king lebron and i actually do n't think chicago is n't great . 
  just locker room talk . 
  lolno, 
  or the bitter hill, 
  time to make 3-1 lead in a series joke ? 
  damn cubs . 
  bryzzo !, 
  ** guess who blew a 3-1 lead in a series **, 
  so cleveland too !, 
  * seattle, 
  so the blackhawks will blow a 3-1 lead ? 
  go cubbies !, 
  i 'd go fulll blown gay with him ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  the nba finals meme market is crashing and burning !, 
  indians just went full golden state warriors . 
  never go full golden state warriors . 
  this is the correct answer . 
  prolly theo epstein, 
  i follow the mets !, 
  jesus motherfucking christ this bloody game, 
  the long con . 
  chapman , really ? 
  mismanaged the placing of pitchers through the game . 
  he 's the new bartman . 
  me thinks this has surpassed god bartolo hr 's thread in upvotes, 
  fuck comey , hillaria , obama , clownstick , etc, 
  out of nothing , mlb and all the teams enter into liquidation . 
  oops, 
  this thread is close to overtake the top post of all time in this subreddit . 
  boring people say baseball is boring, 
  that motherfucking match ruined my outing because the place i was in replaced this game with that bs, 
  the world !, 
  someone said on twitter two years ago that the world will end when the cubs and indians are in g7 of the ws in extra innings !, 
  maddon has passed terryball imho, 
  next stop : fema camps !, 
  the question is , for whom ? 
  ## golden state warriors send their regards, 
  i 'm a metsie but i 'm at the verge of tears, 
  amazing guys !, 
  all of you made history , i 'm so happy for the team and the city !, 
  can confirm , am mexican . 
  the current government is probably the most impopular in mexican history yet for once both the left and right ( including their leaders ) have called for supporting the prez and against trump . 
  and believe me , both aisles of the political spectrum rreaaallyyy hate pe\u00f1a nieto .
