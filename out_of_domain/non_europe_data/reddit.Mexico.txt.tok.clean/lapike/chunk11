  the wind blew toward grace and carried their unwashed scents . 
  she reached into the belt on the back of her dress and pulled out the pistol she stole . 
  `` now now , pretty girl , you do n't want to do nothing you 'll regret , do you ? '' said matthew , `` every man in this group would require at least three bullets to take down , and the more you hurt us , the more we 're gon na hurt you . '', 
  `` do n't come any closer ! '' grace 's hand trembled as she leveled the gun at matthew . 
  he moved his hand forward and looked her directly in the eye . 
  `` i mean it ! '' she said , pulling the hammer back . 
  he smiled . 
  one of his gang members , a skinny fellow with a waxed moustache , rose to his knees and pulled out his own pistol . 
  `` i 'll hit her right in the hip , boss , it wo n't kill her , but it 'll stop her from moving . '', 
  `` i 've seen a man hit there before , '' said another , a grey haired man who still wore his denims from his days as a prospector , `` it took him two days to bleed out , he laid in our tents moaning the entire time , swearing curses on his killer and his killer 's kin . '', 
  matthew turned and looked at the skinny man , nodding his approval . 
  he took another movement closer to grace . 
  grace closed her eyes and fired , grazing matthew in the shoulder and causing the head of the prospector to disappear in an explosion of brain and bone . 
  matthew stood up and grabbed the small wound . 
  at the same time , the skinny man fired a shot that would have crippled grace if it had n't caught matthew in the kidney . 
  the gang leader , bleeding from his back and his front , fell backward , stressing the bridge enough that the ropes broke in the middle . 
  there were four thuds in quick succession as the dickson gang hit the bottom of the canyon . 
  the wind continued to push past grace and the air now smelled like gunpowder and blood . 
  the three survivors cried out from the bottom of the fire red crevice , howling like a chorus of the damned . 
  grace stood up and dropped the gun . 
  it was still a long journey to mataninos . 
  who the fuck is downvoting this ? 
  fuck , i almost want to crosspost this to / r/hiphopheads so they brigade this to the top of the topic . 
  no luck either . 
  found this yahoo answers thread , so quality is iffy , where the estimate was $ 30 to $ 600 . 
  next year , i 'd love to see a `` best whiskey under $ 30 '' category, 
  alex was carrying her sleeping daughter up her home 's stairs when she felt her phone vibrate . 
  it was probably andrea , her wife 's graveyard shift at the hospital led to frequent texts between patients . 
  holly felt heavy in alex 's arms -- alex knew that a day was coming when she would n't be able to pick up her daughter anymore . 
  the first day of kindergarten had been hard for both of them , although alex had managed to hold back tears until holly was already inside . 
  alex laid her daughter down in bed , flanked by elsa and anna dolls , holly 's face illuminated by the red light of the plastic frozen alarm clock blinking 1:00 am . 
  downstairs , the movie 's menu screen still looped on the television , waiting to be turned off . 
  alex 's phone shook in her pocket again , the sender displayed on her iphone as a string of zeros with no text , no preview and only an attached photo . 
  she hesitated , nearly returning the phone to her pocket , before tapping the screen to see herself standing in her kitchen , wearing the same blue pajamas she currently had on . 
  she was screaming and looking at the unseen photographer through the glass panes of kitchen 's back door . 
  `` andrea ? '' there was no response . 
  grabbing the rail on the stairs and leaning forward , she peered onto the ground level . 
  the house was empty and most of the lights were off apart from the blue glow cast by the television . 
  she crept down the steps and into the kitchen and flicked on the lights . 
  there was only her and the bay windows that became mirrors in the light . 
  alex killed the lights and looked out the windows into the black woods behind the house . 
  she opened the back door from the kitchen and looked about . 
  it smelled like oak and burning leaves . 
  andrea had referenced seeing a strangely dressed man traversing the neighborhood when she was at home during the day , casing houses . 
  alex shook the thought from her mind . 
  alex 's phone shook again in her hand . 
  now she was shown running up the steps , a freely-bleeding narrow gash exposing muscle and bone in her right forearm . 
  her jaw tightened . 
  this is n't funny ! '' she only heard silence in response . 
  another text , now only a hand bearing her engagement ring , lying limply on the dark hardwood at the top of the stairs , blood pooling on the ground and splattered on the walls . 
  each line of splashed blood came at a different angle , as if whatever had tore at her had made numerous cuts . 
  alex 's stomach turned . 
  her eyes began to water as her phone vibrated one more time . 
  now the image was of holly , asleep in her bed , a thin shadow cast over her , the bedside clock reading 1:15 am . 
  alex screamed , she was beginning to turn to go upstairs when the handle on the back door began to move . 
  [ a winter 's drive ] ( http://lapike.tumblr.com/post/138243148078/horror-story-a-winters-drive ), 
  thank you for this opportunity !!, 
  ( subscribed to your sub , too ), 
  i would have to recommend old kentucky bourbon bar in covington , ky. 
  they know their bourbon and they have lots of rare stuff in stock . 
  shame . 
  that made my insides curdle . 
  wonderful . 
  i believe the main character is trapped by something , and every time they ruin the simulation/test , it restarts . 
  they 've been failing for a while now , and the simulation fixes whatever was ruined by the main character each time . 
  i 'm a fan of it , too . 
  you ca n't tease us with `` paranormal occurrences '' and just leave it there . 
  at least one spooky story !, 
  please . 
  *** ... and then !!??? 
  creepy and funny . 
  great !, 
  yes !, 
  yassss , jacks , yassss . 
  i prefer merkins with a mission . 
  alliteration earns my dollar and hair . 
  great !, 
  ** positives **, 
  you have a wonderful eye for imagery . 
  you also have a very terse writing style , something i 'd expect in an adventure short story published in playboy or esquire . 
  if you ever want inspiration outside of fantasy , i 'd recommend reading hemingway or ellroy , i think you 'd find a lot in common with them . 
  there 's a lot of wit in there , and it works perfectly with your tone . 
  i loved the line about mistakes `` areya did not make many , but when she did , she certainly knew how to make them count . '', 
  you also succeeded at giving the characters something to want right away , that 's fantastic . 
  you did a great job of showing that they can fail , too . 
  already they 're more complex and living than anything terry goodkind has written . 
  ** builds ** :, 
  sometimes , you need to work on the flow of your writing more . 
  for example , in the sentence : `` they are more subtle than the craftiest assassin , more cunning than the slyest of foxes '' , i think it would be better if you preserved the parallelism by making it, 
  `` craftiest of assassins/slyest of foxes '' or `` craftiest assassin/slyest fox '', 
  i 'm of the school of thought that `` said '' or nothing is the best word to write for dialogue . 
  this is just my opinion ( so feel free to disagree ! ), 
  but there 's a lot of `` sneered '' and `` growled '' in here , and that does n't always work for me . 
  i 'd say i want to know more . 
  * would i proofread the full thing * : right now , i 'm editing for a lot of friends , so i 've got a backlog for a few months . 
  but let me know when you get published and i 'll definitely buy the finished thing . 
  while i love your thought and agree with your latter sentiment , this may not have been the best time to express this idea . 
  to co-op a blm analogy ... 
  * imagine that you 're sitting down to dinner with your family , and while everyone else gets a serving of the meal , you do n't get any . 
  so you say , `` i should get my fair share . '',
