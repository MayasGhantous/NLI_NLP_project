  and as a direct response to this , your dad corrects you , saying , `` everyone should get their fair share . '', 
  now , that 's a wonderful sentiment -- indeed , everyone should , and that was kinda your point in the first place : that you should be a part of everyone , and you should get your fair share also . 
  however , dad 's smart-ass comment just dismissed you and did n't solve the problem that you still have n't gotten any !, 
  that really hit the nail on the head for me with that movie . 
  i ** want ** it to succeed and i ** hope ** it does amazing and surprises all of us . 
  but it looks like crap . 
  but much like my filipina friend who says she sees everything rob schneider does because he 's the only pinoy in western movies , i 'm going to see my buying a ticket for this movie as an investment in future greatness not as an indicator of present quality ... 
   i might not actually go see it but i 'm definitely buying a ticket . 
  yah , but then republicans would have to be in favor of a strong national government and democrats would have to be in favor of state 's rights if you really want to represent [ the third party system well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_party_system ), 
  oh my , yes, 
  i love asking authors about plot points that they did n't explore . 
  looking back at snakewood , what 's one twist or hook that you wanted to use but never could ? 
  legitimately , though , superman was designed by two jewish men and his earliest comics carry over a lot of very interesting influence from jewish folklore ( like the myth of the golem ) . 
  also , his name , kal-el , is obviously inspired by ancient hebrew angel names , like gabriel , michael , samael , etc. 
  do n't care if this is the wrong sub , this is great stuff, 
  hey !, 
  i know these guys . 
  i was a hoosier , went to service at st. paul , and actually met with them a few times to discuss potentially joining the priesthood , although likely as a jesuit . 
  anyways , these guys are awesome . 
  always willing to give food and shelter to students/locals in need , they helped everyone regardless of faith or lifestyle , they had regular interfaith meetings with the buddhists/muslims/hindus / etc in the area , and they were huuuuge iu fans , you 'd see them cheering on during games ( even football games !, 
  that 's how you know they loved indiana . ), 
  it 's sad to see someone mistake them for a hate group , but knowing these guys , they probably just laughed it off . 
  you monster !, 
  no wonder you write such good villains . 
  great news !, 
  jq adams is a fascinating man . 
  one could argue that he was the among the men most qualified to be president , and his career before the presidency was nothing short of stellar . 
  in short order , he :, 
  * established the us border with canada, 
  * negotiated the end of the war of 1812, 
  * negotiated the transfer of florida from spain to the us, 
  * drafted the monroe doctrine , which has defined western hemisphere foreign policy for two centuries, 
  * had the tenacity to be one of the most vocal abolitionists in an era of growing southern power, 
  his presidency , however , was hobbled much like obama 's - the president is merely the executive , useless against an uncooperative legislative arm . 
  after his presidency , he :, 
  * ended the nullification crisis, 
  * protected the will of james smithson and established the smithsonian institutions, 
  a lot of people think lydia is an old woman 's name , which i guess is true in a way . 
  you said you had stolen the name from your great-grandmother , a short but feisty woman from jalisco who still spoke spanish to everyone and made tortillas by hand . 
  she had died the day before you were born , and your parents named you after her , pushing grace over to be your middle name . 
  i think about your name as i stand at the counter and show them the certificate i bought long ago . 
  i 've always been a worrier , for better and worse . 
  i 'm sitting here and they 're strapping me in , the machine is the shiny type of white that gives off reflections like a funhouse mirror . 
  there 's the faint smell of ammonia . 
  do you remember how we first met ? 
  they 're asking me to recall it . 
  i wish it was something cute like reaching for the same book or being forced to share a table in crowded coffee shop . 
  it was when our apartment building caught fire and we had to huddle across the street as giant flames poured out of the windows and exploded through the roof . 
  i shared a blanket with you and asked you if you had anywhere to stay . 
  we ended up crashing at my cousin 's place on seventh street and he tried to make a move on you , but you laughed it off . 
  they 're asking me to remember your scent now . 
  i remember you changed perfumes depending on what time of day it was , sharper scents for the morning and for work , darker perfumes for our dates . 
  i 've been here for three hours , thinking of you . 
  i 'm dreading the final question . 
  i remember our road trip to atlanta , crossing through the devil 's tail in north carolina on the way , that crazy winding road that seemed always just a hairpin turn away from killing both of us . 
  you drove the full thing , you promised me i could drive it next time . 
  you wore a pair of $ 1 sunglasses and you had the windows down and the way the air made your hair curl about your face - i swear , i had never seen a more beautiful woman in my entire life . 
  i would have given anything to see you again . 
  i guess , in a way , i am giving everything . 
  that 's the final price we pay for this machine , you know , i 'm thinking these memories for the last time . 
  they need them to recreate you , or at least this clone of you that will only live for 24 hours . 
  when you die , so will all my thoughts of you . 
  there will be a stranger in the photos on my wall , a smiling beautiful brown eyed woman who dreamed of leaving her back office wall street job and writing books on disappearing cultures . 
  i 'll look at your cornell hoodie and wonder why i have it , wonder who it belonged to . 
  they ask me how you died . 
  it 's the last question . 
  do i give them the scientific answer ? 
  that one night a blood vessel burst in your brain and that as i woke up next to you , your eyes were open and pale and you were cold as i grabbed you in my hands ? 
  or do i tell them the truth , that you did n't die alone , but that you took the whole world with you . 
  that every day in new york has been overcast , that may feels like december , and that i 'm working 14 hours a day just so i do n't have to go home . 
  with that last answer , the first part is over . 
  i wait and listen to the hum of the computer . 
  they take a vr headset and put it over me , i 'm in our bedroom , they 've recreated it perfectly , down to your collection of books and the large window that provided a view of the brick wall next door . 
  someone 's showering , i can hear humming through the thin walls , i can hear your humming - i can hear your humming . 
  they tell me that this version of you does n't know about your death , that i 'm not to mention it . 
  i have 24 hours to love you forever . 
  completely agree . 
  heist movies are always fun and i 'm excited for this one . 
  my favorite was the beautiful dark twisted fantasy, 
  i 'm not sure if there was a spacing error in this post ... or if there was an adaptation of being john malkovich done by lobsters . 
  i 'm hoping for the latter . 
  a mustang , a bronco , a ram , and a taurus all in the garage ... 
  i was scrolling through trollx looking for posts about korra . 
  your costume is awesome !, 
  former congressional staffer here : depends on the presidency , but usually state , treasury , ag , and defense make up the four most powerful cabinet members . 
  whoever is the alpha depends on the president and the current political situation . 
  blanco : shots and cheap mixed drinks, 
  reposado : shots and good mixed drinks, 
  i was recently advised to try my anejos in a chilled glass with the liquor at room temperature . 
  it 's a fantastic way to have tequila and i highly recommend it . 
  i love how you used northland for nwi . 
  is that in reference to the failed city consolidation project from a few years ago ? 
  hey folks !, 
  i 'm the guy who originally did this , i started getting some red envelopes up top to let me know that this video was trending again . 
  you can watch the original thing here if you want to hear lauren as she crylaughs and hear my squeaky , nervous voice : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ysdpqpavxk, 
  it 's been some time since the engagement and we 're finally married !, 
  lauren is my sugar mama now , i 'm a grad student in finance up in new york , and our marriage is great . 
  we 've never had an argument where we raise our voices at each other , we cook together all the time , and because grad school is insanely stressful ( it 's current 4:30 am on a monday and i 'm prepping for the two days of classes i have this week ) , we make sure to keep date night sacred and always have one night a week just for each other . 
  for those of you who are wondering , lauren is incredibly geeky , too . 
  she 's a front end developer for a small but great consulting firm .
