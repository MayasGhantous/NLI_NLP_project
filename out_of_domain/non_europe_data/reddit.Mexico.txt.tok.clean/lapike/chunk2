  `` pretty often , i guess . '', 
  `` loretta , what would you do if i told you that you think about nothing more than anyone i 've ever met before ? '', 
  `` i guess i 'd be inclined to believe you , sir . '', 
  he laughed . 
  `` i 'm going on vacation , going to spend a few weeks as a capybara . 
  i need someone to take over , someone who truly understands how the universe works . 
  ca n't let jesus do it , he 'd cure diseases and - trust me - they serve some purpose . 
  momo would give everyone raisins , and sidd would end suffering . 
  i need someone like you , after all omnipotence means anything you think of instantly comes true . '', 
  `` what are you asking me ? '', 
  `` if i needed you to think of nothing until i returned , would you do that favor for me ? '', 
  loretta 's quivering hand fell from her mouth and swung up to her forehead , a soggy post-shower salute . 
  `` good ! '', 
  he said and in an instant he was no longer , and where he disappeared the steam swirled . 
  loretta grabbed her hot pink towel and waddled to the living room . 
  her husband was cooking in the kitchen , the loud vent fan was running on high . 
  `` were you singing in there ? 
  i could hear you halfway across the house . '', 
  `` i met god himself , he gave me infinite power and knowledge for an indiscriminate amount of time . '', 
  do you want one scoop of bolognese sauce or two ? '', 
  she sat down on one of the wicker chairs in the living room . 
  the clock said 7:25 , bones would be on soon . 
  '' * go east * '' said the barbed wire voice that dragged across his head , '' * go east * . '', 
  he looked down at his wife and grabbed her , his big hairy hands wrinkled the pink of her waitress uniform , his hazel eyes were tearing up , she took a step back . 
  `` frank , stop , you 're hurting me , '' she pushed at his wrist . 
  `` i am going to need you , '' his words came out like the last heaves of flu vomit , `` to give me the car tonight . '', 
  `` go east , '' the voice said . 
  only frank could hear it , carol never winced when he did , she was n't ready to double over in pain like he was . 
  `` you 're scaring me . '', 
  `` give me the car . '', 
  `` i have work in 15 minutes . '', 
  `` give me the fucking car , carol , '' and his hands moved off her shoulders and into the pouch on the front of her uniform . 
  `` go east , '' the voice said again , sending hot splinters throughout his body , his whole body now , it was getting worse . 
  he found what he was looking for , he ran through the loose screen door of their house and into the carport . 
  the green buick was brought to sputtering life and he put it into reverse . 
  `` go east , '' the voice said and he twisted the wheel , bringing the front of the car into the carport and causing the sheet metal to collapse . 
  carol came out of the house and screamed . 
  frank moved the car in reverse , the sheet metal slipped off . 
  he got out and yelled at his wife , `` you drive . '', 
  two hours later they were on highway 139 , klamath falls and the yellow grass of eastern oregon had long disappeared in the mirror . 
  the voice was getting louder , pounding like a war drum - driving faster seemed to make it hurt less . 
  frank wanted to tell his wife what was going on , but the words died in his throat when he spoke to her . 
  carol turned on the radio . 
  '' * three cases today in reno of a spouse-on-spouse murders * '', 
  '' * the twelve year old boy reported that his father 's ears started bleeding , and then his nose , and then his eyes . 
  the father had chained himself in the bedroom after striking his wife in an unexpected bout of anger * '', 
  '' * this is the fifth violent outburst seen today in susanville , the bloodiest day in this small , sleepy desert town 's history * . '', 
  `` ca n't you go any faster ? '', 
  his teeth were clenched so tight he felt he would break them . 
  `` it 's not safe . '', 
  he sighed . 
  his left foot crossed over the small bump in the middle of the car and onto her foot , pressing down on the ignition . 
  `` what are you doing , fra - '', 
  `` you control the wheel , i 'll control the speed . 
  carol 's hands locked up , but frank refused to decelerate . 
  in seconds , their car was plowing into the back of a semi , turning on the black top of the highway , frank watched carol snap forward and into the wheel column , the car was spinning , metal flying , rolling and glass breaking . 
  frank crawled out from the under the wreckage as cars slowed down to gape . 
  he stood up and reached through the hole where a window was , carol was moaning lowly , and he grabbed the gun she kept inside the glovebox . 
  '' ** go east ** '' it said , like a hammer strike to every bone in his spine . 
  frank stood in front of a slowed yellow kia , shooting twice in the air and then aiming his gun at the driver . 
  the driver raised his hands and frank ran to the side and jumped in the passenger seat . 
  `` drive , '' frank said , `` i 'll tell you where to turn . '', 
  8 hours later , they were in salt lake city , the voice had subsided . 
  the car stank of the scared driver 's piss , frank had not stopped the vehicle once , the fuel monitor was hovering below empty . 
  the directions came to frank like memories , he knew where to turn before they even saw the streets . 
  they were in sight of a flat , windowless white building , surrounded by cars and traveler , when the kia sputtered and died . 
  frank did not acknowledge the driver as he ran out and toward the building . 
  there were half a thousand people surrounding it , all ages , all races , all genders . 
  they each approached the building , placing their hands on it . 
  the building had a single door made of black varnished wood on its exterior , the door swung open . 
  it was dark inside . 
  although nobody could hear the sound of footsteps , something began to emerge . 
  i pointed at the tea cup and it levitated off the table and into my hands . 
  `` oh , that 's a new one , '' i thought . 
  you see , i have been alive longer than there have been people . 
  i have won jousting tournaments , preserved my honor through seppuku , given birth to emperors and fathered princes , howled at the moon as a wolf , been elected president twice ( only shot once ) , clanked flint against stone to make fire as i chased a mammoth ... but despite the strangeness of my nomad soul , i 've never been able to do this . 
  i moved my hand and the tea cup returned to the table . 
  i tried again to move it and the entire table lifted . 
  the table collapsed onto the ground as soon as my concentration even faltered a little bit . 
  my parents , such sweet people , ran into the room . 
  `` audrey , what 's that noise ? '', 
  my father said . 
  he was wearing a fine cornflower blue shirt from a small shop on saville row , he had been promoted at his architecture firm after submitting blueprints that his boss proclaimed , `` seemed to come from someone with two decades more experience than you . '', 
  my father never noticed the edits i made during the night . 
  i shrugged my shoulders . 
  this would have to stay a secret until i could figure out what to do next . 
  two weeks later , though , the secret was broken . 
  there was a knock at the front door and a fellow in long robes and a strange hat was waiting for my family . 
  `` your daughter , '' the man said , `` is a witch . '', 
  my mother , a petite woman who often swore at me in haitian creole , grabbed at my father . 
  `` she 's a what ? '', 
  `` little girl , aubrey wassit ? , would you please show your parents what you can do ? '', 
  `` audrey , '' i said and i pointed at the teacup . 
  nothing happened . 
  i focused on it until my brain hurt , but it refused to even quiver . 
  rage filled my veins , i have ridden with the mongol hordes , i have hunted whales in the freezing waves of alaska , and now this teacup will not fly for me ? 
  `` ah , it 's okay . 
  if you could , try saying this . 
  ** wingardium leviosa ** , '' his hands moved swiftly through the air like a seamstress at her craft . 
  the cup moved instantly .
