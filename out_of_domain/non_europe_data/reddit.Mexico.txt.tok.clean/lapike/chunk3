  my parents gasped . 
  meanwhile , my head was spinning with the words he said , it was a mash up of modern english and latin . 
  how many lives ago had i been a roman , was there anything i remembered ? 
  i focused on the teacup and spoke , '' ** bhr\u1e47g\u014d ** '', 
  it shattered into a hundred violent pieces . 
  now it was the robed man 's turn to gasp . 
  `` oh shit , '' he said . 
  i realized i had made two mistakes . 
  first , i had gone too far back . 
  that was kurgan , older than latin ... but the words still worked - interesting , i 'll have to remember that . 
  second , that was the word for breaking , not flying . 
  based on his reaction , i think i had scared him . 
  the man quickly produced a piece of parchment paper and set it down on the table . 
  he bowed to both of my parents , shook my hand , and exited , disappearing in a whooshing clear puff soon after he exited the door . 
  the note he left was mostly for my parents , by reading it they lost the ability to ever speak to others about what i could do . 
  at the bottom of it was an invitation for me to head to london , to wait at some impossible train platform . 
  this was certainly going to be an interesting life . 
  of the millions that i 've lived , it would be no stretch to assume that i was going to miss this one the most . 
   i pointed at the tea cup and it levitated off the table and into my hands . 
   `` oh , that 's a new one , '' i said to myself . 
   you see , i have been alive longer than there have been people . 
  i have won jousting tournaments , preserved my honor through seppuku , given birth to emperors and fathered princes , howled at the moon as a wolf , been elected president twice ( only shot once ) , clanked flint against stone to make fire as i chased a mammoth ... but despite the strangeness of my nomad soul , i 've never been able to do this . 
  i moved my hand and the tea cup returned to the table . 
  i tried again to move it and the entire table lifted . 
  the table collapsed onto the ground as soon as my concentration even faltered a little bit . 
  my parents , such sweet people , ran into the room . 
   `` audrey , what 's that noise ? '', 
  my father said . 
  he was wearing a fine cornflower blue shirt from a small shop on saville row , he had recently been promoted at his architecture firm after submitting blueprints that his boss proclaimed , `` seemed to come from someone with two decades more experience than you . '', 
  my father never noticed the edits i made during the night . 
   i shrugged my shoulders . 
  this would have to stay a secret until i could figure out what to do next . 
   two weeks later , though , the secret was broken . 
  there was a knock at the front door and a fellow in long robes and a strange hat was waiting for my family . 
   `` your daughter , '' the man said , `` is a witch . '', 
   my mother , a frail brown woman who often swore at me in haitian creole , grabbed at my father . 
   `` she 's a what ? '', 
   `` little girl , aubrey wassit ? , would you please show your parents what you can do ? '', 
   `` audrey , '' i said and i pointed at the teacup . 
  nothing happened . 
  i focused on it until my brain hurt , but it refused to even quiver . 
  rage filled my veins , i have ridden with the mongol hordes , i have hunted whales in the freezing waves of alaska , and now this teacup will not fly for me ? 
   `` ah , it 's okay . 
  if you could , try saying this . 
  ** wingardium leviosa ** , '' his hands moved swiftly through the air like a seamstress at her craft . 
  the cup moved instantly . 
  my parents gasped . 
  meanwhile , my head was spinning with the words he said , it was a mash up of modern english and latin . 
  how many lives ago had i been a roman , was there anything i remembered ? 
   i focused on the teacup and spoke , '' ** bhr\u1e47g\u014d ** '',

  i was on / r/writingprompts and responded to [ this prompt ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/writingprompts/comments/3mbtyz/wpout_of_all_the_millions_of_lives_ive_lived_ill/ ), 
  i think my boss would be very confused ... 
  i completely forgot about that , haha . 
  uhh ... it 's an au ? 
  hey friends !, 
  i 'm pretty active on my tumblr , which can be found here : www.lapike.tumblr.com . 
  i always follow back and i 'm love reading other people 's stories !, 
  best ,, 
  thank you for the opportunity !, 
  her voice carried through the air like the scent of sweet flowers , i grew drunk in her whispers , she asked me to come closer and i left the front door open as i followed . 
  lights came on in the house behind me . 
  i would not see this home again . 
  she was a siren 's song made flesh , she ran faster than me , climbing up trees to taunt me , rustling the branches in the moonless night . 
  there were moments that i could feel her behind me , her hot breath upon my neck , she grabbed me and pinched me and my lungs burned , trees and thorns and her hands pulled at my clothes . 
  she led me to a cave in the evergreen mountains . 
  i was naked now and i laid in the cold , smooth stone center , a clearing in the floor surrounded by pearly white bones . 
  oh sweet thing , i am yours for the taking . 
  she opened her mouth and even in the darkness i could see the shine of her teeth . 
  clawed hands moved gently upon my body . 
  she kissed my neck . 
  `` what 's your name ? '', 
  i say and she laughs . 
  `` why did i follow you ? '', 
  i say and she laughs . 
  `` what is going to happen now ? '', 
  i say and she presses her sharp finger against my lips , dragging it down and drawing blood . 
  `` shall we get dessert ? '', 
  he said , grabbing the leathbound black menu from the side of the table . 
  she laughed and bit her lip . 
  `` i 've always been a sucker for anything with berries , and there 's a tart here that yelp says is the best in charlotte , '' he motioned to the item . 
  she looked down at her watch , `` fine , fine . 
  but i have to go soon , my parents expect me to skype with them at nine . '', 
  he laughed , `` of course , of course . 
  you sure i ca n't come back - '', 
  `` that 's bold . '', 
  `` i 've had a nightcap before at your house . '',
