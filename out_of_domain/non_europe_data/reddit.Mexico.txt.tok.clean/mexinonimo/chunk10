  i used to love scott adams back in the day . 
  when i was in college i loved the dilbert tv show , and i got one of his books from the library , one that had some weird future `` predictions '' and an absolutely bonkers idea about how to explain `` a world without gravity that you ca n't disapprove '' . 
  at first i thought it was just satire , nobody could really be so out there , and then i read some interviews where he was defending his book as completely serious `` thought experiment '' . 
  nuts . 
  i think it was that one . 
  the last chapter was dedicated to how we could `` explain '' a world without gravity if we just imagined an universe where everything was increasing it 's mass every millisecond . 
  now that 's an scary thought .

  as an us citizen , you do n't need a visa or any other special permit to visit mexico for up to 180 days , you can just exit the country and enter again at the end of every 180 days period . 
  for extended living you do need an immigration visa .

  that , or [ lotus feet ] ( http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/assets/13214620/222262.jpg ), 
  no , it 's not how that works at all . 
  those are proper doctors , the system is extremely regulated , and nobody is going to give you a prescription for something you do n't need , those are young doctors mostly and they are n't going to fuck up their careers to get you something you do n't really need . 
  quick history review : because mexico has universal health care , private prices for drugs and medical care has been extremely low for decades . 
  back in 96 , new laws came making it easier for generic medicines to be bought by the general public , because the people buying generic meds are low income families , a new drug stores company farmacias similares started offering medical consultations in anexes to their pharmacies , subsidized by several foundations , mainly the un pa\u00eds mejor foundation ( a better country foundation ) . 
  the cost of the medical consultation comes from private donor and foundations , the doctors are usually recent out of medical school and using the system to gain experience in private consultation , or as a side job attending the pharmacies 2 days for ever 5 they work at the government clinic . 
  because the program was so successful , whith not only low income , but middle class and upper class families regulary visiting the pharmacie 's doctors , other companies started doing it , establishing their own foundations to help offset the doctor 's fees , and attract patients to their stores , some stores are even cheaper than $ 50 pesos , offering doctor 's services for as low as $ 30 . 
  that brought us to today , for the price of my morning coffee i can get a doctor to check my cold . 
  your doctor ca n't force you to get certain meds , and you can take your prescripci\u00f3n to other pharmacies , or ask for a generic substitute , or ask for other brands , and pharmacies carry more than 1 kind of med , so , even if the pharmacy doctor prescribs you `` brand1 antibiotic '' you can take that and fill your prescription whereever you want . 
  also , in mexico it 's against the law to over prescribe antibiotics , like , actual fines and you can lose your licence to do that shit . 
  and about the doctor knowing the pharmacy , at least it is n't like in the us , where drug companies can gift doctos to prescribe their brand , that 's illegal in mexico . 
  your doctor most definitely knows your drug company though , they receive gifts to prescribe you medicines in the us, 
  that 's extremely illegal , barbiturates and opioids are controlled substances , if they are selling them without a prescription the seller could face jail time and fines . 
  i would bet they are most likely honoring us prescriptions , which is legal , instead of just straight up selling the drugs without prescriptions . 
  do you get the fee if you use your bank atm ? 
  here in mexico we only get the fee if we use another bank atm , using you own bank is free , the banks tried to change that a few years ago but got told to fuck off by congress .

  edit : words, 
  a trigger word for r/mexico, 
  i would rather have the @ than the latinx insanity herman @, 
  using @ has been an acceptable progressive form for decades now , i remember using to write ni\u00f1@s, compa\u00f1er@s, and other nouns back in the mid 90s in elementary and middle school . 
  now the most aceptable form to be inclusive is to write and say both feminine and masculine forms of the nouns . 
  you will hear politicians and other public speakers say `` mexicanos y mexicanas '' , `` ni\u00f1os y ni\u00f1as '' , `` diputados y diputadas '' . 
  that form of public speech has entered written form and it 's how most kids are being taught to write if they want to signal inclusiveness or simply make it clear they are including both genders .

  `` hot glue '' tributes, 
  not only the economy , the low birth rate in japan is directly related to long working hours and next to none free time , as well as the phenomenon of herbivore men ( not only otaku , but plenty of otherwise normal `` riajuu '' with low drive thanks to overworking ) and women who refuse to quit the labor force and become stay in mothers , because both the absurd long hours that would mean never seeing their kids , and societal pressure forcing those young wives to quit the labor force .
