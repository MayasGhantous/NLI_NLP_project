  if you have the address just send her a written letter with your contact info , just make sure to get a tracking number and signing on delivery if you go with usps , mexican mail service is famously unreliable and she could be getting the letter 6 months from now .

  but with 6 trillion subscribers they should be able to take over the whole canvas , or i 'm missing something ? 
  if you ask a mexican he will tell you anything can be a taco . 
  fish , pork , chicken , any basic cut of meat , arrachera , t-bone , diezmillo , pulpa , aguja , and pre-seasoned cuts like adobada and pastor , does n't matter . 
  picada is good for a frying pan with some onions , chiles and cilantro . 
  arrachera is my personal favorite for a cane asada tacos , and you could go for pre-seasoned adobada or pastor if you want something more along the lines of what you could get in a taqueria , but basically any cut can be a taco go crazy !, 
  adobada is pork or beef , but usually pork , marinated in a sauce made with red chile , vinegar , oregano , and other spices . 
  al pastor is very similar , made with pork , beef or sometimes lamb , marinated with red chile , spices , [ achiote ] ( https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-achiote-or-annatto-2138265 ) , pineapple , and grilled in a [ trompo , which is the mexican version of a d\u00f6ner kebab ] ( https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/none/path/s727d6832251a779e/image/id8a1be2f5210a500/version/1464933481/image.png ), 
  if you buy pre-seasoned pastor meat you do n't really need a trompo , just so you know , any grill would suffice , but some purists will say you need a trompo with a pineapple on top . 
  yes !, 
  any self-respecting carniceria should sell adobada or al pastor meat . 
  for adobada or pastor , you can cook it on a pan or a, 
  griddle in your stove , or in a coal grill for the outside carne asada experience . 
  you can also imitate a trompo in your stove for al pastor , just stack the meat in a plate and hold it by a skewer , something like in this video, 
  edit : do n't forget to add a pineapple piece at the top .

  the government still needs to buy your land . 
  the mexican state owns the rights to oil and mineral exploitation , not to the land , and historically the government buys oil and mineral land at a premium , so if you ever find oil in your land it 's a ticket to sell at an inflated price . 
  the specific article law in the mexican constitution declarante right of private property and the right of the state to buy through eminent domain ( expropiaci\u00f3n ) sell or use any land . 
  if you own land in mexico it needs to be bought from you or otherwise compensate for it . 
  the new mexico city airport failed during the sexenio of vicente fox because the price given per square meter was too low , for example , and the government ca n't simply decide to steal land with impunity without good enough compensation or taking a political hit . 
  really depends on what kind of land and who owns it . 
  usually the government sets an inflated price from the beginning as in many cases they can set any price and buy outright , so paying a premium from the beginning helps for pr and avoid involving the courts . 
  on many other cases , the land falls under communal rural [ ejidos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ejido ) and the people living there have more leverage to increase the prices even more . 
  during the presidency of vicente fox the government tried to eminent domain ejidal lands for a new airport , but the already inflated price the government wanted to pay proved too low for the members of the community , there where several protests and the drive to buy the land was defeated in court . 
  the new airport is being build in another location instead .

  cons :, 
   goods will cost more in all three countries, 
   10 to 15 % of jobs in texas depend on trade with mexico , thanks to the north america supply chain , same with several other border states with mexico and canada . 
   companies will leave mexico , creating unemployment , forcing more people to try cross the border illegally into the us . 
   companies leaving for the us will invest into automate lines in order to save in costs , creating an insignificant amount of new jobs, 
   automation will decrease the price of consumer goods eventually, 
  kinda a pro but actually kinda shitty :, 
   mass immigration from mexico will bring down wages , making the us more competitive , and making factory jobs more desiderable to a struggling lower class an a shrinking middle class .

  navy boys historically do n't fight the cartels , their involved is a new thing , so there has been less opportunity for corruption to spread . 
  the current tactic is to use navy and marines as little as posible , as shock and raid units , and in intelligence command , and shield them as much as possible , while the army and federal police carry the brunt of the assigned tasks .

   1 ) what do you think is the most difficult challenge for u.s. businesses that want to do business in your country ? 
  once an english teacher i had commented in class about how he noticed when he first arrived in mexico how fast you could build in here . 
  it seemed like everything could just be build in no time at all , or left unfinished forever . 
  he said he later learned , thanks to a friend working at some american retailer building new stores , that it was because as long as you greased the right hands , you could get permits for everything and inspections done right in the minute , instead of waiting forever for the inspection queue like in the states , or just not getting the permit because of some little thing that does n't really affect anything but was a part of the checklist . 
  as long as nothing was overly crappy or just plain wrong , you would get your building permit on time . 
  the american companies that understood this way to make business in mexico were getting ahead of the competition , while those trying to do things the right way where getting left behind . 
  for a classroom full of college age mexicans , that was n't anything new , but for him it was a big revelation . 
   2 ) what advice or suggestions do you have for american companies that want to do business in your country ? 
  building a business in mexico is all about networking , get your contacts , your lobbyists and local advisers . 
  in m\u00e9xico there are 3 kinds to do business , there is a wrong way , a right way , and a `` right '' way . 
  also take into account the culture of the mexican worker .
