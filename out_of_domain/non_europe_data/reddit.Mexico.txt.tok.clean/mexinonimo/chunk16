  stuff like getting always on time to your work is expected when working with foreign companies in the big maquiladora areas , maybe not so much in different areas , where there are some leeway , or working overtime , but the local worker also expect the company to dish out the usual benefits in the industry like food coupons , and respect traditions , like having cake on [ d\u00eda de reyes ] ( https://parade.com/248853/yvettemarquez/what-is-dia-de-los-reyes-three-kings-day-and-how-do-you-celebrate-it/ ) or tamales in [ d\u00eda de la calendaria .

  come on buddy , held up your part of the deal , or at the very least say you are really tired and just finger bang her for a while . 
  sinaloa syndrome , a deep wanting of joining a drug cartel . 
  actually , it may already be a thing . 
  amazon te cobra todo . 
  because she is doing it know as the leader of the free world . 
  i love how the top comments here are about the plane , suit and equipment , while over at r/military it 's all about her genitals and how cute she is , with a few `` did n't know mexico had a military lol '' type of comments . 
  but that 's not a red pill term . 
  shit , in spanish you say le da vuelta la ardilla , which is the same concept of a small furry animal running in a wheel to simbolice thinking . 
  no , we used it mostly at work when talking about a coworker having a hard time trying to understand something we are explaining . 
  weird , video turns green and i ca n't see anything . 
  probably for the best . 
  i tried refreshing , did n't work , so i restarted my pc . 
  after watching the whole video , i should had stayed with the green screen .

  i would take everything with a grain of salt seeing as it has been confirmed there are fake mails mixed with the real ones . 
  they are ? 
  did somebody got the chancla ? 
  es por eso que inventan `` cultural appropriation '' . 
  i remember getting on a plane in early to mid 90s that had an smoking section , with special air filters above the seats . 
  i only remember that one flight having them . 
  does n't he hold like 87 % approval rating among republicans ? 
  at this pace , he will need to clone abraham lincoln , paint him in black face , burn him alive in a bonfire made of reagan 's bones and old flags , and eat the remains with a side of fetus salad , for republicans to turn against him . 
  only if your name is joe cool, 
  another pointless story , around here strip clubs are an strictly night affair , 8pm opening at the earliest . 
  the owner of one such fine establishment bough a small property some 15 mins outside of town , a small ranch of sorts . 
  so he decided to open up the place during daylight , with strippers and seafood , and the food was really good , better thab what you would expect . 
  it had two small gazebos and a big enough pool , you could get good food and a lap dance at 3pm outside next to the pool . 
  it lasted around two summers until the authorities started asking for a bigger cut , and the girls complained more about working the day , and it was no longer profitable . 
  brutus seems more of a cat 's name , what with all the backstabbing and such . 
  would n't he be the young hand of the ~ ~ king ~ ~ queen ? 
  a consulate is a diplomatic office that deals with regional and travel matters inside another 's country borders , and is subordinate to the embassy operating in that country ( ie , mexico has an embassy in berlin and smaller consulates in several other german cities ) . 
  a consular section inside the embassy is the office that deals with visas and travel permits , you can find those sections inside consulates and in the main embassy . 
  as an irish citizen you can enter the country without a visa as a tourist for up to 180 days . 
  mexico offers temporal residency visas ( 6 months to 4 years residency ) and you can pair it with a work permit . 
  or you could go for a permanent resident visa . 
  to start your visa process you need to visit the website of the appropriate embassy , fill a pdf with your application , set an appointment , pay the process fee , and get to your appointment with the papers indicated in the site . 
  i believe there are no mexican consulates operating in ireland , so you need to get your residency permit and work visa in the mexican embassy in dublin . 
  i believe it 's also posible for you to get the process done in the mexican embassy in berlin , or the mexican consulates in frankfurt , d\u00fcsseldorf , bremen , hannover and hamburg . 
  i would start by calling the embassy of mexico in ireland consular services section for more information , tel. 
  +353 ( 0 ) 1 667 2610 ( mon-fri 9am to 1pm ) or the embassy of mexico in germany , tel : ( +49 ) 30\u00a0269\u00a0323 0 , same working hours . 
  they can tell you if you can start your visa process in germany of if you need to go to dublin .

  that 's it how tariffs work , if the us imposes tariffs it 's their job to collect , mexico does n't tax exports , and even if it did , it would be for internal use , not to give away to foreign governments .

  it 's funny how many people are happy to pass the `` tittle '' of leader of the free world to merkel nowadays . 
  seems like it would have been unthinkable for any other guy before him . 
  only if it 's matrilineal , ca n't have pretenders from another dynasty running around the place . 
  the whole area around their habitat is a no-fishing zone , the problem is n't that or the type of nets allowed by regulations , it 's that a rare fish breeds there , and the chinese think eating it 's bladder will give them super powers or some shit , so people will just go there and fish in those areas while trying to avoid the authorities . 
  or that housing secretary from the series actually named designated survivor .

  classified information . 
  this , it 's my belive that freedom of speech is one of the most basic principles for any functional democracy , and should be protected from government intervention and encouraged by private actors . 
  the best rebuttal to bigoted and/or hateful speech is to let them talk , mock them for what they are , and then address each point . 
  simply shutting down speech you do n't like , for example , in a college open forum , is also a concession , that the best way you have to deal with their points is to refuse to let anyone listen to them . 
  she only needs to live long enough to skip charles and change succession laws to agnatic-cognatic gavelkind .

  it would be pretty weird , considering i do n't live in a commonwealth state and was never under british rule , unless she is related enough to the habsburg to stake her claim to the mexican crown , which actually i guess it 's not so far fetched , considering her family is originally german royals . 
  you know shit is bad when a satire site breaks news before it happens . 
  [ defense secretary mattis running out of things in office to throw after latest trump leaks ] ( http://www.duffelblog.com/2017/05/trump-leak-russia-intel/ ), 
   `` this fucking guy gave class info on isis to the fucking russians ? '' mattis reportedly said , according to witnesses . 
  `` hey i 've got a great idea , let 's tell them where our subs are too , because we all just want to be friends and sharing is caring or some happy horseshit . '',

  fans wo n't start , causing overheating , screen tearing , crashes , and finally blue screen crash with tdr_video_failure , after a while , ca n't even boot without going straight to blue screen , or not even beginning the boot process , making a clicking noise . 
  so far i have been able to make the fans work by downloading sapphire trixx , and creating a custom profile , setting up the fans at 30 % at the lowest temperature , until 50\u00bac , then jumps at 60 % at 60\u00bac , and then a straight line to 100 % at 80\u00bac . 
  still trying to figure out if this is a good fan profile . 
  edit : ok i got more screen tearing at a confortable 30 % fan speed , 30\u00bac gpu temperature , so i guess i still have n't fixed anything . 
  at least the system has n't crash so far .

  the mayan city states reached its peak before the aztecs were even a thing , by the time of the spanish conquest , when the aztec empire was at it zenith , the mayan cities where in decline , with many been long abandoned or failed into ruin , and the surviving ones were less populous , or just in general decline .
