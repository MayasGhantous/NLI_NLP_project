  and then eat the rest of the pizza at midnight . 
  when you are that fat , just moving around a little can do wonders for you , wont get you thin just like that , but you wont be an amorphous mass gaining belt sizes at home . 
  all i 'm saying , a little is what 's needed to start , like that super fat guy who tried to troll that fitness forum , and instead got a ton of advice , started just going in circles around his house , and ended up losing a ton of weight with little increments in routine and eating a little less every time . 
  here in m\u00e9xico we have a tradition during elections season , [ every presidential candidate , even those from parties too small to actually have a change to win ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bviajlv9tee ) , are asked a series of questions that you would expect in elementary school , about history , geography , and things like `` who is the president of the us '' and `` how much is a bus fare '' and `` what 's the capital of belize '' . 
  pretty simple stuff . 
  [ the only candidate that has never accepted to be asked those questions is our very own eternal candidate from the left .

  ok lest see , in a rural area around here . 
  1m usd is 17.19 million pesos , according to google . 
  taking a 4 person household and in the rural are where i grew up in :, 
  food : 6000/month, 
  rent : 2000/month, 
  power : 2000/month ( it 's hot as fuck here , you need to be running those air conditioners constantly ), 
  water : 150/month, 
  gas : 1620/month ( that 's 3 tanks , 2 for driving around here , and 1 for visiting the state capital ), 
  natural gas for heating and cooking : 450 every 3 months lest say , so 150/month ), 
  phone , internet and cable with the local cable company ( second higher internet speed , 20mbs ) : 669/month, 
  cold as fuck beer ( < = you need this here ) : 800/month, 
  so , that 's 13,389 pesos every month , if we add things like school supplies for a family and odd expenses , we can round it up to 15000 pesos every month , or 180,000 / year . 
  at that rate our money would last us for 95.5 years . 
  at least around here , nobody sells houses in the small towns , the houses are too cheap to sell for profit or to get out of debt , and families are usually big enough that there is always somebody willing to live in the old house and take care of it ( plus sentimental value , nobody lives at my grandparents house anymore , but my uncles will never sell it while any of them is alive ) so most people either rent , or get a piece of land from a family member and build their new home there .

  what are condoms ? 
  nations usually want to be seen as reliable to keep their treaties . 
  it was the rise of destiny manifest that elected a congress and a president that wanted to annex all that sweet , empty land . 
  in the end that worked wonders for the us , and while we in mexico are still a little sore about losing texas and california , at least we do n't have to deal with arizona .

  lest say you are creating a new sector . 
  during negotiations with the colonists you agree to include system koolaid , 2 energy and 5 minerals into the new sector . 
  everybody is happy , but the next day to backtrack and announce to your colonists that no , they ca n't have system koolaid in their sector , instead they can have system tang , with 1 mineral and 2 energy . 
  now people hate you .

  it really depends on what your enemies use . 
  missiles early on against space fauna , and you ca n't never go wrong with big lasers . 
  if your enemies use missiles , get point defenses , either using 1 slot on your corvettes , or mixing dedicated point defence corvettes , building more of one class or the other depending of what my enemies are using . 
  if they stack shields , mix your point defense with projectiles and torpedos . 
  what i like to do at the very least is set for every 5 corvettes with 1s and 1m laser , 1 corvette with 1s railgun and 2s pd and 2 corvettes with 3s torpedos . 
  i tend to also use dedicated destroyers , with 1 all big lazers , and 1 having all other weapons , and at least 1 big guns crusier and 1 support carrier crusier . 
  for battleships i go with one 6l lances battleship and one carrier class . 
  here in the northwest kids will either bring a light a lunch or money . 
  lunch is usually a fruit , a small packet of cookies or chips , and a juice box for some kids , or a sandwich and a juice for others . 
  kids who bring their own money usually get a sandwich , a torta , or candy from outside the school ( schools are forbidden to sell junk food inside ) . 
  in middle and high school instant ramen was also popular until a few years ago , but i do n't know if they still sell it with the new rules .

  i live in a city with high gentrification , a lot of `` juniors '' ( sons and relatives of drug lords ) and other related family members or business partners of drug lords . 
  there a is a lot of drug money and people buying houses , bringing them down and building them anew , the bigger and gaudier the better . 
  but the government has kept the effect of gentrification under control . 
  housing taxes in m\u00e9xico ( predial ) are not decided by current market price but by prices tables maintained by the government based on the size and price of the land and construction of the house , calculated on the price of the whole lot of houses around if every house around is similar ; or as an enclave , if only some of the houses around are similar ; or as a part of a single street or avenue , when the house is in an important street with high comercial value . 
  furthermore , at least in my state , there is a 50 % tax credit if you are currently living in your house .
