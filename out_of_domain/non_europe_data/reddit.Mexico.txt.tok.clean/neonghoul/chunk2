  i am playing offline though, 
  some futurama episodes did it right . 
  and to many , dogs are people too . 
  he said illinois not south side chicago, 
  they will end up poisoning some of there biggest cities . 
  canada is also huge with their cities spread out . 
  they do n't need defense . 
  as long as they change their capital to a place like yellowknife , it would be like invading russia in winter not including canada 's already top notch military . 
  it might also take more than 20 years to fully poison the great lakes considering how huge they are . 
  how would you like fried neanderthal . 
  until you reach the bering strait . 
  unless you travel by dog sled . 
  blacks live in south america too . 
  sucks that nowadays a bad game is bad and a good game is always overrated . 
  i loved the last of us , i got the day after release only knowing it was made by naughty dogs and i only knew one character was called ellie and another joel from the internet . 
  i played it all with a friend and if enough people enjoyed it 's a good game . 
  why would anyone take medical advice from reddit . 
  but a knife through a pigs throat is delicious right . 
  trust me kids love it . 
  ferd knock off, 
  you do n't seem to realize that female genital mutilation can be more than cutting of the clitoris, 
  neither is salt lake . 
  nearest city . 
  like how western michigan is closer to milwaukee than to detroit . 
  but this is of all 48 states so there are exactly 48 areas . 
  boise , idaho is basically in the middle of nowhere so it is farther from other cities and giving it more land . 
  we forget that the natives and spaniards lived in western america before new england https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_oldest_buildings_in_the_united_states, 
  you tried to buy from their online shop . 
  why not just go to walmart or buy online from amazon . 
  you do realize ac3 was like the worst in the series . 
  now ac2 was the shit and also amazon has summer sales too and you can buy console games from there . 
  damn , imagine the graphics if they made left 4 dead 3 ( right after they make half life 3 ), 
  not all chickens only the unhygienic ones, 
  look like nikes . 
  most of the midwest from ohio to nebraska, 
  the past few winters have been warmer than usual and snowfall seems like its been decreasing gradually . 
  the best part is around the planetarium . 
  psn + is not needed and also it gives access to free games . 
  but the most important factor is that all pc 's vary in price and power . 
  $ 40 pc games ? 
  a lot of them are $ 60 when they come out ( they cant include sales which happen for both pc and console games ) . 
  also who would have the same video card for 8 years ? 
  you need to upgrade your specs slowly as they get outdated . 
  there was a a arial picture of san francisco not long ago and it looked flat . 
  i chose a new mother board and got that amd fx-8320 . 
  drastic change . 
  is that mobo good though ?

  ok , thanks for helping . 
  maybe before the chicago fire . 
  that 's the american remake . 
  it is also against the rules to sell the bundle to another person . 
  he broke the rules and tried to scam a person . 
  its for personal use only . 
  i 'm from illinois and they are in almost every mall . 
  south of wall street was once called new amsterdam , a european colony , hence the mess, 
  illinois is n't completely landlocked it is connected to the great lakes as long as michigan and canada remain friendly . 
  people who break an arm like to specify which arm they broke . 
  yeah because you know it 's not like they have practice or anything . 
  that 's like saying usain bolt does n't need much stamina because i have only seen him run for 10 seconds, 
  have you ever written a essay . 
  c - for having a title like that . 
  i bought spore knowing nothing about it and i enjoyed a lot . 
  am i the only one who enjoyed l4d2 on console because i liked to play coop with my friends . 
  when i played there was no loading screen after i died or restarted . 
  maybe he had 1,000 mb of ram, 
  i remember when notch from mine craft got his paypal frozen for some time because he had too much money . 
  i remember one time i went to walmart i went to the fish section to pick my fish food someone had spray painted '' clean you 're fucking fishes '' in big red letters in the wall . 
  i was hard to see the fishes with all that grime in there tanks . 
  usa =| = california and northeast . 
  population =| = power either . 
  if that we 're the case then washington , d.c. would have the least importance . 
  some of the most industrialized and richest places to america were oil coal and farm towns once . 
  the northeast and california would not survive on its own . 
  surprisingly it has a obesity rate of 5 % . 
  but this are the next generation so . . 
  to cut off $ 30 i wo n't think you need that aftermarket cpu cooler . 
  the i5 already comes with a quality cooler , unless of course , you plan on overclocking, 
  penguins live in antarctica . 
  i wants some here in the usa now . 
  watch dogs . 
  i went to see the museum of science of industry which is right next to lsd , when i went to see the lake i thought i had to cross the lsd . 
  nope you just go in a pike path/tunnel underneath it . 
  there was noise from it too . 
  op changed the original title . 
  it 's from 1st to 12th grade originally . 
  lord destructo is a troll account just letting you know,
