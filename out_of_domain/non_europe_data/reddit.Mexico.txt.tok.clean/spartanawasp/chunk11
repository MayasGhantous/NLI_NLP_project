  and yet still no black widow movie, 
  no unyielding ? 
  dishonor upon you, 
   they did decide to secede . 
  then they * invaded another russian republic adn got their asses kicked *, 
  ftfy, 
   he 'll be gutted if they continue down this path . 
  i fail to see the problem with this, 
  hell , i think there was even a small concentration camp in the united kingdom , on the channel islands, 
  that is easily my favorite bridge of all time, 
  yeah , the best level 3 req , even moreso than the wasp , problem is that they 're pretty rare and you need 2 people to be really effective with it, 
  i do n't think he can actually defeat iron man , scarlet witch or vision , can he ? 
  if your internet goes out for more than an entire week , i 'd argue you 're not in the 99 % of gamers . 
  that mexico split haha, 
   tkdr 8.5 imbd , 8/10 rt ( 87 % all critics ) , 90 % user reviews ( 1.2 million votes ) , 3/4 by roger ebert , 78 on metacritic . 
   230m budget , 1.085 b box office, 
  so it 's good * and * successful . 
   any community that gets its laughs by pretending to be idiots will eventually be flooded by actual idiots who mistakenly believe that they 're in good company . 
  sounds like pcmr, 
  [ sure .

  alright, 
   * new blood * , * broken circle * , * smoke and shadow * , * saint 's testimony * , * shadow of intent * , and * fractures * were all amazing . 
  * hunters in the dark * was also good but much less so . 
  there was also * last light * in 2015 , which was a masterpiece . 
  ftfy, 
   hungay, 
  * usan , in proper language, 
  obama was a senator before being president , was n't he ? 
  what has trump even done politically ? 
  and it was n't even that good, 
  and then most northern chinese-mexican communities were genocided ( ? ), 
  during the mexican revolution, 
  * where the wild roses grow, 
   low gdp compare to other european countries, 
  third largest gdp in europe ( edit : sixth largest gdp in the world ) is low now ? 
  i mean you 're # 15 but that 's still a lot specially considering france 's population compared to other european countries, 
  if i remember well , the human population before the hwc was about 60 billion , while after it 's end it was about 28 billion , so about 32 billion humans died . 
  sad , is n't it ? 
  one of the best military leaders ever in the history of mankind and barely anybody knows him at all . 
  is that the new ed sheeran song, 
  does anyone happen to have a clip of this ? 
   multiple degrees of magnitude larger, 
  larger * than * ww2 ? 
  really . 
  ste men, 
   you may be fine with crap stories , but most people are n't . 
  are they now ? 
  games like battlefield sell like hotcakes and those have pretty shit stories, 
  honestly i was just happy we got a big budget wwi movie , those are super-rare, 
  and pe\u00f1a 's chin, 
  would n't be surprised if planets like harvest did, 
  oh my sweet summer child, 
  they 've always been zippered from the back, 
  oh god , are you me ? 
  i was an emo until my senior year of high school with a pair of super cool knee high converse boots , i am a guy though, 
   statute of westminster in 1932, 
  haha are you kidding me ? 
  uprising was fucking awful and that was literally the first halo comic , nevermind the fact that it took 3 years or something like that for just * 4 * issues to come out, 
  eh , i used to write a lot there and the quality was mixed , since everybody could post, 
  the closest you 'll get is / r/halorp , i think they got their own little universe going and so, 
  there 's also this : http://halofanon.wikia.com/wiki/main_page , which is probably the largest halo fanfic site out there, 
  ' a fistful of arrows ' is as close to being canon as you 'll get really, 
   jax is simply impossible to beat in a straight fight, 
  in-game too !, 
  not let them in when they are at the border , and if they do n't have mexican papers , then the us ca n't force mexico to accept them . 
  mexico has no obligation to accept them into their territory , nor can the us force them to do so if they are not mexican nationals . 
  it 's a difficult situation for sure , but if they are n't mexican , mexico has no responsability over them, 
   am i the only, 
   reactionary passing contest, 
  pick one, 
  oddly ? 
  `` widely panned '' as in `` i did n't like it '', 
  yes really, 
   it was good though, 
  ftfy, 
   sony,

  manchester by the sea !, 
  how long till someone links this to / r/bestof ? 
  or the lambent brumak ... 
  considering mgsv has a 93 on metacritic , sure you can, 
  that 's how international organizations work , if you do n't like that , exit the wto i guess, 
   international trade is devoid of emotion . 
  considering the content of his tweets , you should tell trump that, 
   it 's way more complicated than that, 
  republicans do n't seem to think so , they just think mexico = bad, 
  it does , and yes you can , there are a couple countries which are not in it , like south sudan , north korea , one of the stans ( ca n't remember which ) which the us would join then, 
  it 's actually 40 or 64 , not 48, 
  were it so easy, 
   weird that you talk that bf3 dlcs were more like `` expansions '' in the sense that they `` expanded the game and its features '' while at the same time throwing bf1 dlcs under the bus . 
  pretty much . 
  this whole post is bascially `` bf3 dlcs were different because they were different and bf1 are not because lolz . 
  no buy ! '', 
  that 's not how burden of proof works at all ... 
  or maybe ... people just do n't like it ?
