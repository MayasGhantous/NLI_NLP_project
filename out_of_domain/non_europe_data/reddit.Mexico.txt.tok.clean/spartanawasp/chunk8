  iceland is in europe , is n't it ? 
   glaring plotholes, 
  such as ? 
  so schindler 's list then ? 
  you say it like there 's something wrong it, 
  good , it 's a dumb stereotypical joke, 
  do n't think there is one for ps but for xbox we got / r/greatxboxdeals, 
  recently , war horse, 
  did i say it did ? 
  try calling in the vehicles from the req station from the pods , it does n't spawn it from the garage, 
  do you happen to have a link to that ? 
  what reference ? 
  in halo : new blood, 
  not quite, 
  [ ] ( #s `` rookie gets taken hostage and mickey gets to him first , he ca n't decide fast enough wether to kill the woman pointing the gun to the rookie 's head or not , so the woman kills the rookie anyway . 
  because of this , dutch retires , buck , romeo and mickey become ivs but mickey covertly joins the insurrection and gets captured and put in prison by the end of the book . '' ), 
  or maybe ... just do n't buy it ? 
  and a hell of a mindfuck, 
  same here in mexico, 
  portugal, 
  it sounds like a 343 terminal, 
  titanfall 2 is n't out yet though :p, 
  the problem was that one of the main criticisms was that the game was buggy as hell , even more so than fo3 , but obsidian was n't in charge of q&a or bug testing , bethesda `` did '' that for them, 
  it might even go like one of those what if episodes tv series sometimes do , and mc is the one that gets fatally wounded and linda has to fight her way through ce herself, 
  a rengar flair calling bullshit on something ? 
  oh the irony, 
  that goes without saying :p, 
  `` what the hell am i supposed to do with this * inside * a ~ ~ covenant ~ ~ ship ? '', 
  \u00a1 hermano !, 
  ( \u00b4 \u250f \u03c9 \u2513 \uff40 ) / stereotypical mexican dude chiming in , saludos !, 
  it 's like a cheaper , ` edgier ' version of foo fighters ' wasting light, 
  man , i thought you were talking about jason newstead for a second there , which is weird since i 've got more megadeth songs than metallica ones :|, 
  yes they do , and world at war is part of the black ops series too, 
  return on investment, 
  thanks comrade, 
  lol it was 35 dollars, 
  a fps drop ? 
  i do n't think they really * need * to do anything, 
  and the russians too, 
  the fridge would still survive though, 
  maybe you just have a terrible elo, 
  and hardly any third party support ... 
  seems like leonardo dicaprio has moved onto bigger things, 
  the wii u sales say otherwise, 
  too bad it actually is . 
  / r/the _ dumbass is leaking again, 
  / r/futanari welcomes you with open arms, 
  would n't say americans are particularly hairy , more like spaniards or latin americans, 
  why ? 
  are you children ? 
  shh , the pro-trump racists are in full force in this thread and you 're going against their narrative, 
  ever heard of this thing called ` opinions ' ? 
  he 's easily my favorite villian from the mcu so far, 
  can i borrow your crystal ball ? 
  well it 's not really a game , it 's supposed to be a tool to forge, 
  you could pick up and xbox one s instead, 
  too late . 
  it 's still pretty impressive today, 
  it 's pretty shitty band honestly . 
  there 's a pop punk band called real friends , i was making a joke, 
   thorin thinks that splyce has an easier group lul, 
  ftfy, 
  actually 2k removed it from the store a while ago, 
  i believe they said it was too buggy or so, 
  since halo 2 actually, 
  they made it much easier in the redux version , do n't worry, 
  no , but i sure as hell can think it 's wrong and stupid, 
  should get this post removed soon enough, 
  i thought suicide squad released already ? 
  actually i believe that 200 million is the human population left * on earth * after the battle of earth in halo 2 and 3 . 
  this looks and sounds just like on of those old sly 2 cutscenes before the final mission of the area, 
  hey !, 
  we mexicans tried to help as best as we could :(, 
  and then they complain about gibraltar ... 
  there 's gon na be a black album ? 
  when did they announce that ? 
  watch 's lord, 
  to * all * of china ? 
  that sounds excessive . 
  this is my favorite too . 
  thank you for sharing . 
  what do you mean it is n't on the ost ? 
  it is , it 's called * epilogue *, 
  i believe they tweeted that they are still working on it, 
  * western europe, 
  sounds like me when i play blitzcrank, 
  my in hawaii what ? 
  does n't carol do it at the start of season 5 when taking out terminus too ? 
  * frozen forest, 
  skrillex shared it ? 
  what ? 
  where ? 
  pes was more popular than pes ? 
  no way, 
  reach sp  3 sp, 
  you mean no devotion ? 
  for anyone actually wondering , they 're called no devotion, 
  really ? 
  i see it recommended quite a bit when somebody is looking for sad movies, 
  or that ` our navy is smaller than even the wwi one ' comment,
