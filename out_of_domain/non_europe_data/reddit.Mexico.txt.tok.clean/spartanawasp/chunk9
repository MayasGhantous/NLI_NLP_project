  the delta is becoming smaller, 
   objective : survive, 
  ftfy, 
  i know this does n't solve the horrible layout of the map but you can actually call in a vehicle req from the station in the drop pods you start in , and it will spawn from the side of the map instead of the garage, 
  no , just that one has a special spawn i believe, 
  shh , you 're interrupting a part of the ` china is literally satan ' circlejerk, 
  except for uno/dos/tre where he was actually a main member, 
  fans ? 
  i 'm all about that homecoming, 
  my chemical romance - the ghost of you into the jetset life is gon na kill you, 
  rise against - prayer of the refugee into drones, 
  alexisonfire - drunks , lovers , sinners and saints into this could be anywhere in the world, 
  afi - the spoken word into this time imperfect, 
  you could say oslo is closer to paris than the northern tip of norway , still sounds pretty impressive,

  black ops iii ? 
  why bother having a military when if someone attacks ireland the uk is gon na come rushing anyway ? 
  a great majority of is though , look how a lot of the comments on the rdr2 announcement are no pc version, 
  ah yes , the halo : reach special, 
  a perfect circle - passive, 
  idk man , i honestly really like moving on, 
   russia and china were n't allies in ww2 . 
  the ussr made japan sign a non-aggression pact in 1941, 
  ftfy, 
  metro redux , both great games, 
  sheer size, 
  just like the king 's speech, 
  rock and electronic do n't have relevance in the broader modern music scene ? 
  alright, 
  i do feel advaced warfare 2 is gon na happen though , not sure what a lake or an ocean might have to do with it however, 
  rip iaw and the awesome stories like the misadventures of lulu and veigar, 
  ah , did n't know they made a dlc for germany, 
  they are easily one of my favorite bands of all time , but their sound varies a lot , they started as punk , moved onto pop punk , then rock with a lot of electronic influence, 
  or calling it a north american tour and never going to mexico, 
  there are no brutes in halo 5, 
  well ouija made 103m at the box office and ouija 2 43m so not really a quarter ... 
  crash love is the only time he 's looked really `` normal '',

  well then that 's sounds much more like their problem than ours , does n't it ? 
  sonic vs mario is a long rivalry, 
  bf vs cod was n't really that much of a thing until bf3 vs mw3 in 2011 and that was just 5 years ago, 
  ah , so we 're just gon na ignore the whole ` invasion and rape of neutral belgium ' ? 
  because , despite the photo being called ` situation room ' , it is n't actually the situation roo ( the one you mention ) but rather a small room next to it . 
  it 's been clarified before . 
  what did trudeau do ? 
  considering 86 % sales of skyrim were on 360/ps3 , yes . 
  yeah because britain was so good to her colonies, 
  you mean internal debt ? 
  because he was just one dude in one movie and now we 're back to stock villians again, 
  most people really liked it too , which is why it was always voted over everything else , and that burnt out a lot of people off the map, 
  like metro 's ranger mode, 
  that field hospital you find in the regina level scared the shit out of me, 
  goddamn really ? 
  where ? 
  looks like metro in vr space,

  if you sold your console that you played your games on , well , i do n't think ms owes you anything really . 
  nobody is pointing a gun at you and forcing you to buy an xbox , it 's your personal choice,

  is that why he got banned from league of legends for being toxic ?

  heh , if anything that 's the part i hate the most about im3 , tony seemingly has ptsd for like 15 minutes and then bam !, 
  it 's magically cured with no side effects, 
  dae the dark knight rises is terrible ???

   mundo flair, 
   complaining about vayne, 
  checks out, 
  as a latin american , nobody here wants american troops in their country , even if we have friendly relations , period . 
  probably , like poland or the baltic states , my point is not everyone ( that is n't opposed to the us ) wants american troops . 
  as opposed to critical hit maker of collin farrell ? 
  works for master chief as well, 
  halo 5 ? 
  the three least developed states have the highest birthrate , not surprising . 
  just slightly, 
  the objective of the soviets during the winter war was never to annex the entirety of finland but rather just parts of the border ; they actually ended up getting more territory out of it than they originally wanted, 
  bioshock 2 's was pretty good though, 
  ** guerra ** civil ?
