  * be really good at a popular video game . 
  * stream yourself being good at it consistently . 
  * have a memorable personality . 
  * ask for donations constantly . 
  or be the typical `` girl streamer '' and whore yourself, 
  [ relevant ] ( https://streamable.com/a6ck ), 
  i prefer the definition given by urban dictionary :, 
   a term used by fuckboys over social media in order to facilitate their need for attention by adding the epithet ` cheeky ' to the restaurant chain nandos , usually followed by ` with the lads ' - aka a group of tools equal to or greater than the original tool posting the update . 
  expect some sort of deeply depressing metrosexual attire and a variety of group selfies and close up shots of the food that 's been ordered . 
  essentially using this term means the final nail in the coffin of your masculinity has been hammered . 
  ` off out with the lads for a cheeky nandos ', 
  i just love this [ edit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cg-cxp65ce ) , completely changes the tone of the scene . 
  mind if you share some ? 
  ronaldinho has gone insane, 
  i thought that was belgium, 
  very true , any movie or tv shows that portrays the struggles of showbiz or how they 're all romantics have recognition from the academy . 
  i think norbit won one, 
  the first time i saw this movie was on tv and just this scene and since then i started looking and when i watched it , i knew what was going to happen but for some reason i wanted it to happen other way . 
  i did n't saw the ending scene with mark walberg the first time so it was a good surprise when i saw it . 
  the last one ( in the us ) closed in late 2013 and the movie came out in early 2013, 
  i thought that big eyes was a nice story but i just wanted it to be over before the first half of the movie , the trial felt rushed and they could 've cut some of the things in between . 
  i was n't sure if it wanted to be a comedy or a drama but it was n't very funny . 
  makes me think tim burton is a terrible and predictable director even when this movie did not used his style . 
  i do n't think anyone is skipping this one on reddit, 
  imo rakitic does n't get the recognition he deserves . 
  or maybe he is just outshined by the msn . 
  he brings the long shots that barca sometimes need also . 
  lil b is ahead of the future then, 
  his name is noobscopers , obvious joke, 
  thank you this helped , and now updated and it worked . 
  something i noticed , if you tell people that focus is a romcom before watching it , they get less disappointed . 
  the mara sisters ' great-grandfather tim mara is the founder of new york giants . 
  their uncle is the ceo of the giants right now . 
  well yeah the problem was a bit the script since requa and ficarra pulled off a nice twist in crazy , stupid love , they thought it would be right again but you know what happened . 
  i believe the cinematography looks beautiful and the chemistry between will smith and robbie is pretty good . 
  not a wrestling historian but tna maybe, 
  * high end components may be necessary to play recent games on a decent frame rate . 
  not everyone has a nice computer to play the witcher iii for $ 399, 
  you do n't only need a graphics card to run the game, 
  link me to one , i do agree that pc is better than consoles but i do n't agree that they 're cheaper ( at least in my country ) . 
  wow , no need to act like an asshole , what i 'm saying is that a 750ti it 's 120 bucks and that 's already 1/4 of the budget . 
  $ 120 for an intel i3 , $ 20 for 4 gb of ram , plus the motherboard , and hdd . 
  yes, 
  thanks, 
  mexico, 
  they are n't `` cheap '' but good hardware for your pc hard to get even when i live in a top 3 city of the country so it 's overpriced . 
  the good thing is that amazon recently opened a mexican version of their site and now i can order a video card half price ( american price ) . 
  yeah , my 360 console it 's 4 years old and my graphics card that recently broke only worked 2\u00a01/2 years , i do n't think xbox will make another console in the next 5 years and still will run the same games that pc ( lower quality i know ) since they sometimes get tailormade to it . 
  like she did n't knew that was going to happen . 
  i do n't know how to explain this but it 's just one those bad things that happen when you work in that environment . 
  how high are you ? 
  yesterday 's match but i did not saw it posted . 
  the goal to tie the game was really good . 
  was n't this posted before ? 
  edit : nevermind it was [ deleted ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/longtail/comments/3gkaek/206794294_spotify_set_to_end_free_music_streaming/ ) because it was misleading , apparently they just want to put some limits not drop the service . 
  that scene is banned from the la release , such a shame most people i know ( that have seen the movie ) have not seen that scene because it was `` too violent '' , when shit like saw gets unrated versions on dvd . 
  oh son of a bitch, 
  pics or did n't happen, 
  care to say which one ? 
  imo fifa points or cars for nfs are not worth it but sims expansions are very good ( for the most part ), 
  sad , i personally did n't like bf4 but to me bf3 premium was worth it, 
  hannibal ( the real one ) was inspired by a doctor from my city , monterrey , mexico . 
  he was released in 1981 and continued to serve as physician until 2009 when he died . 
  wikipedia says odesza is chillwave and [ majestic casual ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/majesticcasual/ ) and [ mr suicide sheep ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/mrsuicidesheep ) post similar stuff to branchez , hippie and odesza . 
  for instruments you can look at live versions of some songs like this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjkjs5jhpv0, 
  not a question but i love your work, 
  just get rid of the new girl and you 'll have a better show, 
  that 's more of a guadalajara thing, 
  also , not a super fan of shaggy but i always laugh when quincea\u00f1eras dance to this song without knowing what the lyrics actually say . 
  yeah i 'm saving some money for it but with school and all it 's going really slow, 
  it 's cheaper to buy the bluray trilogy , i got it for $ 10 on sale at a blockbuster or [ here ] ( http://www.mixup.com.mx/mixup/detproducto.aspx?sku=7509036529170 ) it 's also $ 10 but online only, 
  can you prove that ? 
  that 's as much proof you can give ? 
  the definition of getting ea 'd, 
  he even made him take a picture for / r/slavs _ squatting, 
  some people on reddit claim she is actually smart and talented but chose to act like she does because of money , so i would say not making a big scene about it was a `` smart '' move . 
  reminds me the time my unlce drank [ poett ] ( http://www.viatodo.com/imagenes/productos/big/producto-224.jpg ) because `` it kinda looks like gatorade '', 
  i know , he was n't even that drunk, 
  there were like 4 movies of character development before the avengers but i agree everyone says it 's the best because they only remember the third act . 
  tip dollers, 
  never thought i would see juay de rito here, 
  so that 's where everyone sends me, 
  reminds me of one of my favorite youtube comments, 
   lebron back at the cavs , kg back at the timberwolves , derrick rose back at the hospital . 
  which character can jason schwartzman play in this ? 
  kind of a tip , expect every `` masterpiece '' `` 10/10 '' `` greatest of all time '' album you heard about here [ reddit ] to be at least enjoyable or 8/10 if they are n't a niche genre because in every subreddit people overhype things like skyrim , mad max fury road or kendrick lamar latest anything . 
  without the right context it looks like ronaldo is seeing the craziest shit , when in reality he is the one that bring that thing to the show . 
  lol , that 's it [ check this one too ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w_0urgoxvu ), 
  what you 're saying is that the nba is the world 's league that happens to take place in the usa ? 
  well since football has a top league in the majority of the world it 's more fair to say that bar\u00e7a are indeed the best team in the world right know but american football , basketball and baseball do n't have top leagues with huge revenues to honestly say they 're the best team in the world . 
  i 'd money is the only thing making players from the world going to america to compete . 
  60 point games are not as easy as hat tricks . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_national_basketball_association_single-game_scoring_leaders only 22 different players have scored that . 
  naldo 's defensive play was disgusting , just fucking walking there thinking if it 's a good idea to mark the guy that can get a hat trick . 
  you ca n't compare a hat trick to a 60 point game , a 60 point game is an achievement done by hof type of players , a hat trick it 's hard but i bet you it happens more than 3 times a season in every league , there 's already 2 in the premier this season . 
  oh but remember that time at punchy 's wedding , when they finish dancing and nora calls then robin feels like shit, 
  you are correct, 
  there is a continent named america . 
  edit : based on this i can call someone from belize north american ? 
  i think it 's kind of stupid that the world does n't settle for a single system to avoid this situations .
