  iverson shot worse though , if only he shot more 3s . 
  i would like someone to explain economic concepts with fut or use economic concepts to be a better trader, 
  with iverson it 's even worse since westbrook had twice the ast % but only 4 % tov more than ai . 
  but in iverson 's defense , the way the nba was played back then was different and without advanced stats , when i was kid i used to watch iverson on tv and it looked so cool but now that i 'm older i understand that 's not the way it should be . 
  i love watching westbrook but he wants to do it all and that 's not the way to win a team game . 
  thank you for replying , i was also listening the bs podcast and some guy sent a mail about chris paul packing his bags and playing pointgod at the bucks , even if it 's really crazy , what do you think about it ? 
  so in a perfect world c.j. 
  miles could bring something to the bucks if you can get him ? 
  or george hill in 2 years since he played for the spurs, 
  right , we 'll see what they do , i wish you guys luck i 'm not a bucks fan but giannis is so cool i had to check how long this team could be together and when they will contend . 
  obviously not getting her butt touched since there are boundaries . 
  3 times she told him to stop and that she is not a whore then called him a clown on the way out . 
  ( at least that 's what i got i 'm not a portuguese speaker but i know spanish ), 
  even the other 2 knew that it was going in an awkward direction, 
  million dollar bills is a good song why do you dislike it ? 
  playoffs r/nba hates him , and then their opinion of him depends of his podcast during the regular season, 
  agree , here if you do n't like something they politely ask or joke about it but i 've never seen anyone getting true hate for liking artists that are n't popular here . 
  but a lot of stuff happens :, 
  * her best friend moves out, 
  * her boyfriend breaks up with her . 
  * her career is in a dead end . 
  * she loses her place . 
  life forced her to come out of her comfort zone to move on with her life ( just like everything and everybody is ) , she avoided the challenges until she overcame that fear of change and in the end she fixes those problems . 
  it 's going to be like when messi got player of the tournament in the latest wc but he lost , i honestly thought he was going to throw it away right there, 
  you 're overrating the comprehension of the other countries though . 
  even though most people beyond the first 2 years of university have some understanding of english they just skip over the meaning of the lyrics most of the time . 
  and not everyone is beyond their second year of university . 
  you should hear someone that has no idea what the lyrics are saying they are just making up words that fit to sound like they are singing along , it 's hilarious . 
  his 3 point shot was literally a solid 5/7, 
  mmm si , pero en ese estudio se referia a una familia con un promedio de 4 integrantes . 
  but i read that because of previous history , kd would n't like to go to dc . 
  he kinda had a tough time in his early life . 
  i 'm honestly 100 % watching this now, 
  southampton were disappointing as a whole : tadic and redmond were supposed to be good picks , van dijk never got points when i had him , fonte left , austin got injured ... 
  i started watching this because i love will arnett then i kinda hate watched it because i was n't into it , suddenly i finished the season and now i want more . 
  guess i 'm a fan . 
  why 60 fps lol, 
  sounds awesome, 
  imo if they keep at it , they will make the finals in 2019, 
  i knoe it 's unethical but i still believe what kobe and harden say in that article . 
  judging from stories about them , from their interviews harden does care more about his teammates than himself , he even thought that he would spend his entire career as a 6th man because he wanted to help the thunder win a championship . 
  overall while the ads are the climax of the articles and it 's unethical , i still like them . 
  not everything is bullshit , he still gets hit in the arms when people reach and he is driving to the rim . 
  a comparision irl would be messi and cristiano . 
  those guys are god level players and make their teammates look like role players even though they are insanely talented . 
  and a day off in some places, 
  neymar and suarez are insane players ( in their own teams they would be the guy ) but the team seems lost without messi . 
  is it waves ? 
  when it got popular and they started only mocking minorities and women then they truly went to shit . 
  nothing wrong with a little shock humor but when you 're so clearly targeting a group then it stops being funny . 
  most likely because she is the only one good in the auditions, 
  lol at the edit , classic, 
  yeah , i mean i do n't hate j. cole , it baffles me how he charts better than joey but yeah you said it , waves is better than cole 's entire career without a doubt and that 's what counts . 
  so fergie fixed his flaws and improved him , and mou defined him ? 
  and if that also fails ian clark can drop 36 points on 70 % shooting, 
  harden is a capable on ball defender but he almost never shows it because there 's no need . 
  that being said , i think mda made that tactic so the spurs offense only attacked the mismatch and it would be more predictable and easier to counter . 
  i would counter your point about mirror 's edge with :, 
  - this game runs at 30 + fps on my shitty laptop at low graphics and it looks better than fine . 
  - combat adds to the thrill and there 's a non combat pack you can buy which is worth it for the price . 
  - replayable even if you dislike the story, 
  can you play on pc with a controller ? 
  any link so i can set it up ? 
  maybe i 'm just stupid because i could n't work out how but i 'll try it, 
  after all the comments on every thread about him , i do n't think he feels welcome, 
  `` i still have rockets winning the title . 
  i can not go back on my word '', 
  - the metta in me, 
  they do this very often tho , it 's not that exhausting considering he barely puts an effort on the rest of the defense . 
  you need a neat haircut if you want a stubble and viceversa , ca n't have both and do n't look like a hobo unless you have a british accent . 
  i do n't get why not many strip clubs have this , seems like a million dollar idea you can sell to japanese businessman or something like that, 
  i 'm honored, 
  zizek says hi, 
  only crappy strip clubs charge that, 
  zaza what a dirty player . 
  edit : this ruined the series kawhi is n't coming back this game . 
  he took an extra step to where kawhi 's feet were landing . 
  zaza is a known dirty player and it would n't surprise me he did it intentionally . 
  i know he is n't looking down but he totally knows . 
  zaza defensive player of the year for taking out kawhi, 
  thunder last year ? 
  this is n't the team that won the 2014 championship either . 
  there 's only 4 guys from that team . 
  thunder was a great team last year but durant and westbrook choked and klay went insane from 3, 
  do n't you know ? 
  we are worse than mad max in every part of desertic country of mexico, 
  iniesta and xavi used to do this too, 
  his jokes makes people miss his point which is : meghan trainor has n't done anything revolutionary compared to other people on the list . 
  justin timberlake , beyonce , lorde and adele have done everything she did but better . 
  he also said that alessia cara and hailee steinfeld deserve more recognition than her . 
  and i agree with that . 
  can you dab to hemingway ? 
  do n't think so, 
  why ? 
  his message is directly against people from the donald . 
  he is n't saying be a white supermacist , he is saying it 's ok to be proud of being white ( like being proud of any other skin color ) but , why do you feel like policing minorities ' groups ?
