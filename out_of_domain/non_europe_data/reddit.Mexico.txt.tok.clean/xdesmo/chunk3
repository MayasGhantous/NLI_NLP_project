  was not dissapointed , oops wrong subreddit, 
  * le litterally not dissapoint, 
  green eggs with ham, 
  the bible is so large that you can interpret anything and say it is so true but so are the equations on my math test and then i know i 'm terribly wrong . 
  plot twist : it 's a dude, 
  yes , but in this case according to gingerimposter comment history ( who is your same sex celebrity crush ? 
  i 'm assuming it 's a girl , your argument is invalid in this case and i feel so dumb doing this . 
  and that scene was amazing, 
  pretty much everything i see people doing circlejerks . 
  i like the circlejerk subreddit because is honest and they ( for the most part ) just do it for the lulz . 
  but when you see a circlejerk in action outside of the subreddit , for instance on / r/gaming saying pc master race , steam is the best , gaben is my new god , half life is the best game ever , and call of duty sucks ; a feel so bad of what this community really is , and you ca n't stop it . 
  this is everywhere and you ca n't escape from it because most of them just want ( let 's be honest ) worthless karma . 
  reddit is my favorite site on the internet , there 's a place for everyone , everyday you met a new friend even for just a exchange of clever sentences and good jokes , you learn , you laugh , you get angry , you see some good stuff ( if you know what i mean ) ; but when you see people exploiting this for karma i start to feel hate , and i do n't want to look like a fucking hippie but let 's forget about the karma for one day . 
  i 've ran into markofj twice and he rage quit twice in mw3 . 
  another time i got spawntrapped by jnasty while he was livestreaming ( i did n't join like the other idiots on my team ) . 
  he was later found dead drowned in pussy, 
  se\u00f1ora without \u00f1 , this is fake, 
  i imagine jimmy carr telling every joke i read here, 
  sounds like carol from archer, 
  if you want to piss people on cod , copy their clan tags and killed them with the shield , the rage is unmatchable, 
  i mean making them angry but whatever you 're into, 
  bitches love nukes, 
  i think grandpa made up the story so the arnold a kid would think its real and you were a kid when you watched it , but watch it again and he 's just lying to make him feel better, 
  tell her to start thinking on a bullshit excuse for her youth , some people will believe for instance that she eats asparagus with maple syrup everyday and try it . 
  she does n't look 92 at all, 
  tom cruise borrows these shots on his movies also, 
  this season does n't appear on mexican netflix , is it becuase of the mexican car thing they said ? 
  i was n't even mad or because the richard hammond crash or what ? 
  what 's with the hate with m. rossi ? 
  i only have forza 4 and horizon, 
  cockfights ? 
  that stupid rulebook has the formula , the one, 
  they probably do n't have girlfriends , i 'm not even mad, 
  i 'm constantly late because i use reddit :(, 
  field of dreams, 
  your friendzone, 
  i know that feel bro, 
  monterrey 's weather is the most constant in the world , is always fucked up . 
  yo mama is so fat , that if somebody mentally undress her it would take a whole year,
