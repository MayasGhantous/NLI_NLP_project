  i do n't think it will have the same content than nextgen consoles or pc , like the mycareer story from college which is the one i play the most . 
  i would like to know if this is just going to be a re-skinned version of the game or will they change the mechanics . 
  do you think it 's going to be worth it ? 
  first , i would post this questions on the main subreddit but most of the people just play fut and i only play career mode which are played at a different tempo/playstyle . 
  recently bought fifa 15 because of the price drop and coming from 14 i see that every single pass i make it 's either too far or not close enough i would like to know what changed from 1 game to another . 
  also fouls so many uncalled fouls and good tackles get called against me and cpu can get away with murder . 
  another thing i hate is that when i play versus good teams like bayern or dortmund , i dominate the match except for a period where robben or muller go into impossible mode and dribble my entire backline to chip my keeper , why does this happen ? 
  how to prevent it ? 
  only add those that can speak fluent english . 
  every time i see a discussion about anime adaptation someone starts calling racism and blaming hollywood for white washing stories and i 'm not denying , it happens but in my mind some of the anime characters do not show japanese features . 
  with so many coming up ( death note , akira , ghost in the shell ) and only edge of tomorrow having relative success , i would like to hear your opinion . 
  about edge of tomorrow , i read the novel before watching the movie and i thought that the changes did not have a negative effect on the theme and the way it made me feel the story and emily blunt 's fmb was so much better than the one in the book . 
  plus it was more entertaining and ended with a better note than the novel .

  i do n't know how to do spoilers in the title but do n't read this if you have n't seen the movie . 
  kishotenketsu it 's a way of structuring a play , poem , song or movie made by japanese . 
  basically it 's a 4 part structure divided in :, 
  \u2022 ki/introduction : we get information explained in a safe and familiar way . 
  \u2022 sho/development : we develop that information . 
  \u2022 ten/twist : we learn new information or get a different perspective . 
  \u2022 ketsu/conclusion : the resolution of the conflict is made with the sum of all parts instead of the dropping act 2 and 3 entirely like in western movies . 
  a long time ago i saw this video explaining the design of the levels in the most recent mario games and i made the connection to this movie now that i saw it . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbmikevebta . 
  ** structure and development of the plot in the movies based on kishotenketsu . 
  in star wars : the force awakens we are introduced to new characters and conflicts but because it would be too dangerous to just make a movie of entirely new characters we are also given familiar characters . 
  this movie will be ki or introduction . 
  star wars viii in my opinion will be 90 % sho or development , where we follow our new main characters finn , rey , poe and kylo ren . 
  they have been established and we have no doubt that they can carry the movie without han solo . 
  we learn about them , their past becomes clearer , and major changes do not occur here until the last 10 % of the movie which is ten or twist . 
  in this part of the movie we either learn key information or somebody changes their side of the force . 
  star wars ix will be the follow up of ten and finish in ketsu or conclusion . 
  here the main protagonist will face a series of challenges that will prove everything s/he learns throughout the movies and finally face the main villain in an epic battle and a victorious conclusion . 
  ** speculation and thoughts **, 
  george lucas said he wanted to make the prequels to rhyme with the original trilogy , so i it would be too crazy to say that this trilogy will have similar moments . 
  for starters there 's a lot of things that are really similar to anh in sw7 . 
  another death star , another easy flaw that makes the planet explode , etc. 
  i also think that in the second movie kylo ren will pull a `` zuko '' or reverse anakin and move to the light side of the force to help rey , finn and poe defeat snoke . 
  i read about people saying that rey is likely to be luke 's daughter that got abandoned in jakku because he wanted to protect her from the force . 
  and i think this can be true because she got called by the lightsaber and is force sensitive while finn does n't have those kind of powers . 
  plus her incredible ability to fly ships comes from the use of the force also . 
  every generation of jedis is more powerful than the other so that can half-ass explain why rey got her powers super quick . 
  i was going trough a loss streak in game so i decided to step away a bit from the game but then i thought i could do this . 
  i can show the formulas of how i did it in excel but basically i 'm doing something similar to how they rate soccer matches . 
  no surprise that panthera is first in the rankings and randozos is the last but i will be doing this every week and see the teams progress . 
  which team is playing worse than they actually are ( team allegiance ) and which team is overperforming . 
  predictions : if soar at least splits against enemy they can become first seed because the have a high chance of winning against alg who play back to back games on sunday . 
  right know eu is underperfoming everywhere so do n't hesitate to choose split in any match except panthera 's . 
  let me know what you think about this and maybe i can keep doing it . 
  i saw that show on netflix and when i learned that it was cancelled i needed another show about an indiana girl that moves to new york with a funny roomate . 
  i love the humor and i think it 's more absurd in season 2 which is something i missed . 
  any other shows similar to this one ? 
  also do you think they will invite eric andre to the show as a hobo , gay friend or a hipster next season ? 
  i do n't jungle often but when i do i feel bad for not being in the teamfight because i was doing a buff at the other side of the map . 
  i also believe that the constant fighting does n't leave time to kill all the camps ( this does n't look like an issue in spl because everyone is on the same page in terms of pace ), 
  hello , i have come here to help you decide which team is most likely to win their matchup or split . 
  last week it was really rough for everyone 's fp because it kinda is a fresh start for some teams . 
  for the predictions i gave everyone 1500 elo and used a formula similar to the one used in world football rankings to determinate the strength of the teams . 
  [ this how it looks after week 6 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wkdultj.png ), 
  hopefully we can get a lot of fp together this weekend . 
  i will bold the name of the team i pick . 
  team 1 | split | team 2, 
  ** egr ** | | alg, 
  ** soar ** | | rando, 
  ** pntr ** | | tpg, 
  nv | | ** dnl **, 
  ** soar ** | | alg, 
  ** hfm ** | | tpg, 
  picks are based on win expectancy . 
  [ read how it works ] ( http://www.eloratings.net/system.html ), 
  last week 8 out 12 matches went as expected but this week it 's not going to be easy . 
  team of similar are going against each other to fight for dreamhack ( eager vs luminosity , eager vs. 
  soar and soar vs. 
  denial ) while others are fighting for relegation ( nv vs. alg and randozos vs. alg ) and that 's just na . 
  [ you can see the elo rankings here after week 7 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/c924mpe.png ), 
  and now the picks.i will bold the name of the team i pick . 
  team 1 | split | team 2, 
  ** soar ** | | dnl, 
  nv | ** split ** | alg, 
  ** nme ** | | rand0, 
  egr | ** split ** | soar, 
  ** alg ** | | rand0, 
  note : change your pick to alg in rando vs. alg , if they sweep nv . 
  picks are based on win expectancy , [ read how it works ] ( http://www.eloratings.net/system.html ), 
  here 's an excel file with the teams standings in which by entering results tells you who qualifies in each scenario . 
  includes magic number , i.e. 
  luminosity 's number is 3 , meaning that if lg wins all their games , egr have to win 3 games to qualify for dreamhack . 
  if magic number is negative it means they can not qualify with any result . 
  is he a bench player or a starter ? 
  should i pick rafa silva instead ? 
  as many people who are visiting the subreddit right now , i bought this game during the summer sale and i recently finished it . 
  every time i finished an episode i would go looking for the discussion threads and read about this sub thoughts . 
  going from saying that chloe was an ungrateful bitch and let her die by the train over and over , to falling in love with her even going as far as destroying an entire town . 
  i read so much praise about the game with every release and liked reading about the other side of the coin in terms of hard choices , but everything changed in the last episode , there were so many comments of disappointment for the ending because it came down to 2 choices ; being selfish and destroying the bay to keep your best friend or sacrificing your best friend for the greater good . 
  imo leaving the ending to be only with the sacrifice chloe , go back in time and erase everything i 've done , should be the only ending since it 's still heartbreaking for most of us . 
  the game already gives a great explanation to why , even if i did that , it does n't take away the memories of that week , in other [ words ] ( https://youtu.be/bvtnykigxii?t=13s ) . 
  imagine making a tasty dip for a party and nobody but you and your drunk friend ate it and enjoyed it , the following day he does n't remember but you do , and you remember the memory . 
  i do n't know if this was a good example but it 's the way i see it . 
  maybe in season 2 ( fingers crossed ) dontnod can set up a story where the conflict is solved in a way that our choices have an effect in the finale . 
  the way i see it , the plot ca n't be solved another way without max asking pretty please the tornado to stop and that would 've been a shitty ending . 
  though i think there are predetermined events to make matches more `` exciting '' like an unreal 90 min equalizer or ball going into the post when in front of the goal instead of scoring the winner , i 'm not trying to start a conspiracy theory about rigged results by virtual referees , but,
