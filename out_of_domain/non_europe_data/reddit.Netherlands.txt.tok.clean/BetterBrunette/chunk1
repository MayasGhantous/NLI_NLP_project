  ** interview section **, 
  * by : n00b *, 
  first we have ** some_bot 's ** interview, 
  ** n00b ** : some_bot will you do an interview for the tagpro times ? 
  ** some_bot ** : i 'd love to !, 
  ** n00b ** : oh now that mrcow is gone you suddenly want to talk ? 
  jerk !, 
  up next we have an interview with resident old man ** hootie **, 
  would you like to do an interview for the tagpro times ? 
  ** n00b ** : do n't make me blackmail you for an interview, 
  ** hootie ** : lol i 'd be happy to sorry didnt see the msg, 
  ** n00b ** : it 's okay , i did n't have any blackmail material anyway, 
  ** hootie ** : but i am curious what kind of blackmail material you have , i did stay drunk this entire weekend shit i should have said no first, 
  ** n00b ** : tell us all about it pls . 
  ** hootie ** : 20th class reunion, 
  ** n00b ** : do n't leave out the filthy details, 
  ** hootie ** : drunk fest , teabagged my wife in the applebee 's parking lot . 
  well i thought it was my wife, 
  maybe it was mrcow . 
  ** hootie ** : ended up being the parking lot sweeper chick from the mcdonalds next door . 
  ** n00b ** : i miss him . 
  ** hootie ** : mrcow is missed , hopefully he is enjoying greener pastures . 
  ** n00b ** : so tell our dear readers , what is it like being the resident old man ? 
  ** hootie ** : it 's depressing and invigorating , all at the same time . 
  i feel like people look up to me for life lessons , but realistically i think they just want to know someone who will die soon so they can get in the will . 
  ** n00b ** : do you sometimes yell get of my lawn you damn kids ? 
  can you put me in your will ? 
  thanks .
