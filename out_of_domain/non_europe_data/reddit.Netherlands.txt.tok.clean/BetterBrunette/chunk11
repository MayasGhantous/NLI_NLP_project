  video in question : https://streamable.com/m7zi, 
   a 10 second video without any context, 
  who needs context when you clearly cost your team a cap ? 
   we should be encouraged to fight against trolls, 
  that 's why i banned you . 
  i 'm the oprah of pups . 
  everyone gets a pup .

  he kept killing me as i was spawning, 
  my nick is literally n00b .

  [ you guys are just jelly of my skillzzzz ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bnvchkj.gif ), 
  it should n't take 3 months and this whole process has been a bit of a fuck up . 
  we changed things up a bit though so hopefully we can end this soon . 
  cat . 
  grats < 3, 
  the penalties from zaza and pell\u00e8 were absolutely atrocious . 
   do n't upvote, 
  you wanted to be on the front page really bad huh ? 
  the real question is . . 
  because i might have to quit if i ca n't sass anymore . . 
  [ excuuuuuse me ? 
   seriously though i 'm pretty sure the mtc gets way more hate and spite from the community and we do n't ask for this kind of protection , we just know it 's part of the job and we deal with it . 
  the mods did n't ask for this either . 
  it 's a decision made by the devs . 
  [ yup it 's ugly as fuck ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kyzjsjn.jpg ), 
  what the actual fuck was that ? 
  the crowd is absolutely insane . 
  edit : fuck he crashed on one of the motorcycles,

  my first cap ever !!, 
  that is awesome . 
  yaaaaaassss, 
  i just messaged lucky about it . 
  hope it 's fixed soon . 
  yeah no way we ban 2000 people a month, 
   maybe not 2000 people , i think a lot of those were repeat offenders or people who ban evaded and were re-banned pretty much daily . 
  where are you getting that info from ? 
  daevil1 has never been a mod so i 'm not sure where he got those numbers from lol . 
  i 'm not sure if i can see those numbers . 
  you 'll have to ask a dev . 
  no i am jerry . 
  odrevan more like odreban amirite !, 
  a is for ayyyyyy lmao, 
  u is for ur mum hue, 
  happy birthday !, 
  hope you have a lovely day . 
  how 's this karma strat working out for you ? 
  [ you sound quite salty . 
   i mean i turned down the mod position when i could have taken it again so i 'm not sure i can even qualify as salty . 
  who offered ? 
   i saw how the moderator community was changing and had no interest in it especially when the requirements turned into having to afk and chat about nothing on irc for a required amount of hours ( do n't give me bullshit about how it helped with mod communication - we had a much more useful subreddit for that ) rather than actually playing in pubs , talking to the community within those pubs , and moderating the game through modtools . 
  you know - interacting with the community ; something those involved with tagpro struggle with to the point of having to call for privatebatmanmajor to come be a community liaison . 
  we do n't use irc anymore for communication . 
   but semi-dank meme anyway, 
   but then the tryhards took over , we modded a bunch of kids with questionable reputations , and you know the rest of the story, 
  mind calling them ( or me ) out ? 
  i 'm interested to see who you are talking about .
