   nope - not going to call anyone out ; just because i think they 're shitty mods does n't mean they 're shitty people or deserved to be shamed . 
  fair enough . 
  just wanted to see if i could do something about the people you are talking about . 
  you 're all welcome to crash on my couch in the netherlands . 
  honoured to have been rekt by you . 
  the article is in dutch but there are a couple pictures of the inside .

  that 's my secret . 
  i 'm * always * here . 
   do you think there would be problems ( what do you mean by that ? ), 
  if some context was given without going into too much detail ? 
  if so , why ? 
  we want to avoid bringing attention to the people being bullied and the people who are doing the bullying . 
  we do n't want any witch-hunting on either side .

  amazing as always !, 
  happy holidays to you too pige . 
  will there be a special grinch/coal flair for / u/bsa86 ? 
  [ thank you . 
  i 'd like to thank / u/gavr0che , / u/flooba , / u/dansinh and / u/mynameisdor for always believing in me . 
  did you always believe in me though ? 
  rekt by his own website . 
  as a mod : i think it 's bullshit as well but not much i can do . 
  luckyspammer already changed it so we ca n't use unicode stuff . 
  they ruined my fave macro . 
  all aboard the flaccid train !, 
  pls . 
  get out of here with your logic . 
  for real though it 's only a very small percentage of people who lag from it . 
  that 's bullshit . 
  a lot of people use them without spamming and as a mod you should know that . 
  buy me dinner first . 
  up next you 'll work on bringing back unicode right ? 
  happy birthday !, 
  reported . 
  no gore on the sub pls .

  you 're in our hearts tho . 
  hop on, 
   i will find you , and murder you in your sleep , just prepare yourself . 
  have n't installed the os update but it 's choppy for me as well . 
  any idea what this can be / u/luckyspammer ? 
  ~ ~ i think it might be the lack of unicode . 
  you should bring it back to make sure it has nothing to do with that . ~ ~, 
  what kind of info would be helpful for you ? 
  [ we 'd never do anything like that . 
   celtag vigo taking over this meetup turtle style, 
  so a bunch of dudes awkwardly dry humping in a corner ? 
  i signed up for majors playtime . 
  but you keep benching me . 
  is it cock or is it ball ? 
   i 'm thinking : you meet more people ; those that usually would n't sign up for time constraint reasons would be more likely to sign up for a shorter season ; more emphasis is put on chemistry and quick learning instead of grinding out the whole season ; less bad blood and toxicity if maybe some people do n't deal well with each other or being on a losing team or not getting play time or whatever . 
  this is exactly why i signed up for something competitive for the first time . 
  was n't sure what to expect but i 'm having a lot of fun and our team has great chemistry . 
  i 'd probably sign up for another mini-season . 
   i think this is a fair thing to ask , i just think it 's weird to see you and n00b being the two to come out and say it - if it was coming from hyponome or another eltp stalwart then i 'd understand it and attach more weight to it . 
  i was simply stating that i 'm enjoying my first competitive league . 
  like nice i 've been around and followed eltp . 
  i 'm not saying this season is better than regular eltp . 
  impressive how you managed to turn positive comments into a salty comment thread though . 
  i was trying to say that i am enjoying my first league . 
  and indirectly compliment / u/sam-tagpro for creating the league . 
  i 'm not sure why you 're being so salty in a thread about this mini-league . 
  one you did n't sign up for . 
  i 'm not saying he 's wrong . 
  but i do think he could have worded it in a nicer way . 
  if anything as a commissioner he should be interested in what people who are semi-new to competitive have to say . 
  yeah this entire thing has gotten out of hand .
