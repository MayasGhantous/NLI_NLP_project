  tell us more about yourself, 
  ** hootie ** : i have heard you are romantic , and a dashingly good dancer . 
  ** n00b ** : my dancemoves are the best !, 
  i 'm like a female justin timberlake, 
  ** hootie ** : about me , well , tagpro has been my first experience in an online gaming community in many years . 
  granted , when i was younger , we hung out on irc in the mid 90 's and tried to scan for quake lan games . 
  ** n00b ** : damn you really are old !, 
  just kidding . 
  i bet you are a beautiful silver fox . 
  ** hootie ** : then life happens , careers start , they end , family , and next thing you know you are playing with blue balls late at night after your wife and son go to bed . 
  ** n00b ** : i 've heard blue balls indeed appear after marriage and kids . 
  ** hootie ** : i only have a bit of grey in my beard , i have aged well . 
  the secret is to pickle your liver and work your way to the outside . 
  ** n00b ** : in that case i will become a glorious looking old woman . 
  ** hootie ** : we all have aspirations to shoot for . 
  ** n00b ** : what is something we should know about you ? 
  ** hootie ** : that is an incredibly hard thing to answer , because i am likely the most boring person i know online . 
  i used to do open-mic comedy shows when i was younger , and i am a world-renowned karaoke singer in the town where i live . 
  ** n00b ** : oooooh what is your favorite song to sing ? 
  ** hootie ** : here 's something many people do n't know about me . 
  i fish a lot . 
  like , more than i should . 
  i fish several bass tournament circuits here in north florida . 
  my favorite song to sing is probably tiny dancer . 
  song by elton john . 
  he was big before you were born . 
  ** n00b ** : pls i 'm 24 . 
  ** hootie ** : elton likes them young i think . 
  you 're good . 
  ** n00b ** : elton loves the d . we all know that . 
  ** hootie ** : i figured him to be an offensive type . 
  ** n00b ** : his fashion sense is offensive though, 
  ** hootie ** : yes , i have to agree . 
  his lack of fashion is rivaled only by my own . 
  ** n00b ** : it 's okay . 
  old men are allowed to walk around in hawaii shirts, 
  ** hootie ** : i am probably the most boring interview ever , next to mcbride 's . 
  ** n00b ** : pls, 
  ** hootie ** : you know , here 's something i have thought about : i really do kind of look forward to getting old ( er ) . 
  ** n00b ** : what are you plans for when you 're old ( er ) ? 
  ** hootie ** : i mean , what age do i have to be to begin wearing those awesome velcro-shoes that old men wear and pay $ 20 for ? 
  immediate plans : wear velcro shoes, 
  ** n00b ** : i 'd say begin wearing them now . 
  who cares what other people think ? 
  wear those velcro shoes !, 
  ** hootie ** : and i want to be able to sit at park benches and catcall young hot chicks without being `` creepy '' and just become the `` harmless cute old man '' . 
  ** n00b ** : you 'd be the creepy old man everyone avoids at the park . 
  ** hootie ** : i want to retire maybe mid-50 's , enjoy our place at the gulf , and fish and drink the rest of my days , maybe have a grandkid or two if my son does n't become a serial killer . 
  ** n00b ** : who is your favorite person of the tagpro community and why is it me ? 
  ** hootie ** : of all my favorites , n00b is one of them, 
  ** n00b ** : is your son showing any serial killer signs yet ? 
  ** hootie ** : he is a sweet kid , but he takes pleasure in poking my black lab in the eye , and he pulls the tail of my step-cat a lot . 
  it 's a constant battle to keep them alive . 
  ** n00b ** : i used to pull the tail of my parents cat too . 
  but now i 'm a cat lady so i 'm sure he will be alright . 
  ** hootie ** : cat ladies are hot until they get about 50 and start sleeping with about 30 of them in a bed . 
  ** n00b ** : i 'd rather have 30 dudes in my bed when i 'm 50 . 
  but that is a different story . 
  ** hootie ** : i expected exactly that answer from you n00b . 
  that 's what i like about you , you never disappoint . 
  ** n00b ** : that 's why people love me !, 
  ( that and the fact i 'm a woman . 
  we are rare on the internet ), 
  ** hootie ** : i think you are one of only 7 women on the internet . 
  that is commendable . 
  it 's a wonder you can even walk . 
  ** n00b ** : my inbox explodes on a daily basis with all these dickpics, 
  ** hootie ** : mine too , but that is because of an unfortunate typo when creating my email address years ago . 
  who would have thought sweetpootiepee4u@gmail.com would have attracted so many fans ? 
  ** n00b ** : oh man chris hansen would love to take over that address i bet . 
  ** hootie ** : sweet ( underscore ) pootiepoo4u@gmail.com, sorry , typo again . 
  wanted to get it out there correctly for mltp contact info . 
  funny story about chris hansen . 
  he and i met once in austin, 
  ** n00b ** : did you have to take a seat ? 
  ** hootie ** : i invited him to the bar in the lobby of this fancy hotel to have a drink . 
  and he asked me if there would be cameras there . 
  makes me wonder what he is hiding . 
  ** n00b ** : hmmm . 
  naked pictures of cows ? 
  ** hootie ** : i did not take a seat that night . 
  the key is to stay on offense . 
  ** n00b ** : plus you need to run away if he has any filthy info on you . 
  ** hootie ** : i have seen cows naked , it 's mooving . 
  sorry , that pun was udderly ridiculous . 
  ** n00b ** : alright , thanks for your time hootie . 
  tell all your friends to read the tagpro times !, 
  ** hootie ** : i have already told my one friend . 
  thank you for the interview n00b _ . 
  you are the greatest cat lady i know . 
  now , get off my lawn !, 
  starting next week we are introducing the new segment * dear n00b * , you can ask her all your tagpro and non-tagpro related questions . 
  so , need advice on making the best cocktail ever or how to get the ladies ? 
  pm / u/betterbrunette your questions !, 
  i was thinking about starting one of those dear ... , advice columns . 
  what are your guys ' thoughts on that ? 
  i think it 's a great idea to include the community and get people to be more invested in the newspaper . 
  i already included a little plug . 
  if you guys do n't like the idea remove the plug part . 
   also since i 'm a eu scrub and english is not my first language , can someone check my spelling ?
