  i try to watch as many games as i can , i love it !, 
  i support ajax , a team from amsterdam . 
  welcome back !!!!, 
  warner brothers !, 
  recently i 've noticed that my grabs have been getting more and more flaccid , even though my offensive partner is trying everything they can to help out !, 
  they wiggle and waggle and push and prod at the blue balls , but nothing helps . 
  what can i do to improve the situation ? 
  ah the good old flaccid grab , or as i like to call it ` the whiskey grab ' . 
  make sure you have a good connection with your offensive partner , the more they wiggle and waggle the more flaccid you will get . 
  i advise you to use some ` power-ups ' so you will be * up * and running in no time !, 
  do you have some questions you are dying to get answered but you do n't know who to ask ? 
  worry no more , n00b is here to help !, 
  pm your questions to / u/betterbrunette and get your life back on track !, 
  let me know if you need any help with other sections . 
  that 's adorable . 
  adorable !, 
  apart from my new section of course . 
  / u/fallinfallinfallin corhal would like an interview pls . 
  take pics of the open bar pls !, 
  `` i 'm drunk '', 
  good luck !, 
  i 'm sure you will do great . 
  i 'm very happy to read this . 
  the road to recovery wo n't be easy but i hope knowing that people care about you will make it a little easier . 
  if you ever need someone to talk to or if you want to vent , feel free to pm me .

  manspider, 
  since you are half man [ half spider ] ( http://us-p.vclart.net/vcl/artists/picklejuice/manspider/manspider02-firstmate04.jpg ) we need to find a place where people are not afraid of you . 
  i did some research and it turns out they have some holy spiders in china . 
  so pack your bags and prepare to get laid by using the line * ` ey bb i 'm holy u wan sum fuk ? ' *, 
  so i got kind of a personal question , i hope it could be kept anonymous ? 
  i write a section for an online newspaper regarding a free webgame . 
  i do n't want to give away my identity but the section is about moderators in the game and specifically how they are people too . 
  sorry if that 's too vague but my privacy is crucial . 
  the problem i have is that i do n't know how to edit at all . 
  frequently i interview people and they 'll say the totally wrong thing and then its stuck there forever . 
  help !, 
  anonymous, 
  * dear ti eh i mean anonymous * ,, 
  editing is a very hard job . 
  i mean look at mrcow he was very polite before he started editing ttt and now look at him . 
  i can teach you how to edit so you will stop embarrassing yourself on one condition : ** give me mod powers !, 
  ** i shall rule this game with an iron fist ( aka ban everyone i do n't like ) . 
  do n't forget to pm your questions to / u/betterbrunette so she can fix your problems !, 
  ** n00b ** : some_bot do you have time for an interview for ttt ? 
  mrcow ca n't interview you this week . 
  ** some_bot ** : in that case : sure !, 
  ** n00b ** : rude . 
  oh and do n't forget hootie 's awesome comic :d, 
  ey bb how u doin ' ? 
  i agree . 
  he 's a ... * wait for it * ... hoot !, 
  ** the top ten excuses for getting banned **, 
  ** what ? 
  i ca n't call a crappy teammate a cunt-twat wanker ? 
  ** i am lagging hard on hotel wifi and my team reported me . 
  ** each and every one of these reports are false, 
  ** i 've been banned because i 'm a very very very good player . 
  ** < calmdown  ! mods false reported again, 
  ** i was n't showboating , i was lagging . 
  ** i was drunk and did n't mean it . 
  pls can i get unbanned ? 
  i 'll suck your dick !, 
  ** i admit , i did rage a little , but it 's my first time and my team did suck donkey balls, 
  ** someone replaced my ` gg ' macro with ` get rekt , scrub fucks, 
  ** my brother was playing on my account, 
  ** n00b ** : manspider would you like to do an interview for ttt ? 
  ( say yes or i will find you and kidnap your cat ), 
  ** manspider ** : sure , but i ca n't let it interrupt my pubs or camwatts will get mad ( he 's on my team right now ), 
  ** manspider ** : 2-2 with 30 seconds left, 
  ** n00b ** : fuck you camwatts you ca n't stop me !, 
  oh kill those scrubs first then, 
  ** manspider ** : tied , everyone loses . 
  ** n00b ** : you guys are losers !, 
  ** n00b ** : so , manspider , how did you come up with this name ? 
  ** n00b ** : do you look like danny devito irl ? 
  ** manspider ** : i wish . 
  he 'd be my ideal mate . 
  ** manspider ** : do you look like danny devito irl ? 
  ** n00b ** : if only i was that beautiful * sigh *, 
  ** manspider ** : the search continues . 
  ** n00b ** : so pick one : danny devito or scarlett johansson, 
  * manspider googles scarlett johansson *, 
  ** manspider ** : also , how do you even know the right spelling of that name ? 
  ** n00b ** : because i 'm smart as fuck !, 
  ** manspider ** : hmm ... scarlett johansson with danny devito 's face . 
  ** n00b ** : oh yeah that 's a killer combo right there, 
  ** n00b ** : do you have photoshop skills ? 
  the readers deserve that gorgeous sight . 
  ** manspider ** : i could do it in paint , but i 'd probably get too flustered for my interview . 
  ** n00b ** : understandable . 
  so tell me something interesting about yourself . 
  ** manspider ** : i put on socks and everything . 
  ** n00b ** : where do you put these socks on ? 
  ** manspider ** : the better question is where did i take them off of ( mrcow 's udders ), 
  ** manspider ** : interesting ... hmm ...
