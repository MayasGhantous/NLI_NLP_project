  i 'm 28 , so that 's like 5 standard deviations above the average tagpro age . 
  ** n00b ** : mrcow is gone to get an udderlift . 
  this is a safe place now . 
  ** manspider ** : also , i use phrases like `` standard deviation . '', 
  ** n00b ** : u smart huh ?!, 
  ** manspider ** : i pritin 2b, 
  ** n00b ** : k k cool, 
  ** n00b ** : tell me more about your lovelife .

  i went on a date on sunday . 
  ** n00b ** : and ... 
  ** manspider ** : annndddd ... she wo n't be the spider that rips my head off and eats it . 
  ** n00b ** : i 'm not sure if that 's a good thing or a bad thing . 
  ** manspider ** : true love is never a bad thing . 
  ** n00b ** : so what do you look for in a woman ? 
  there might be a special lady reading ? 
  ( just kidding , everyone reading this is a scrub ), 
  ** manspider ** : i 've been thinking lately that i should re-think my dating strategy . 
  everything i 've tried has n't worked . 
  ** manspider ** : things i have n't tried : ofm first date . 
  ** n00b ** : that might work . 
  chase a chick with a flag sounds like a solid plan . 
  ** manspider ** : or a google hangout with fresh and the lady . 
  ** n00b ** : retweet mreh, 
  ** manspider ** : hey , sexy lady . 
  ** n00b ** : i bet fresh get 's all the pre-teens .

  ** manspider ** : so sweg , so frush . 
  how could a girl resist ? 
  ** manspider ** : somehow mancatlady does n't get as many ladies as you 'd think . 
  ** n00b ** : what ?!, 
  i think you 're hanging out with the wrong girls . 
  ** manspider ** : from what okcupid tells me , 1 in 2 chicago women are allergic to cats . 
  and 2 in 2 chicago women do n't like super sexay ball-touching nerds . 
  ** n00b ** : okcupid is a scrub . 
  tagpro is where all the romance is happening . 
  ** manspider ** : true . 
  i think the first time i was on mumble , i talked to j0ules and thelegend . 
  ** n00b ** : start hitting on them next time . 
  ** manspider ** : great advice . 
  you should become tagpro dating advisor . 
  ** n00b ** : people can send me their question for the dear n00b section . 
  i will hook them up with some sweet dating advice . 
  ** manspider ** : how many gentleballs have you met through tagpro ? 
  ** n00b ** : i ca n't tell you . 
  people will get totally jealous . 
  ** n00b ** : so who is your favorite person on tagpro and why is it me ? 
  ** manspider ** : haha , my favorite person is n00b because she sends me pictures of her grumpy cat . 
  ** n00b ** : yissssss, 
  ** n00b ** : any last words for our dear readers ? 
  ** manspider ** : ~ ~ when my robots take over the earth , just make sure that you wear your tagpro shirts so they know who to kill first . ~ ~, 
  wait ... 
  i mean who to keep alive .

  ** n00b ** : no problem !, 
  ** n00b ** : who cares about tagpro anyway ?!, 
  ** manspider ** : lu blue 's desk is the only evidence i can think of that someone ever cared .

  ** n00b ** : #neverforget, 
  you kind of look like andrew garfield !, 
  i was washing my hair with a shampoo called brilliant brunette and liked that name . 
  could n't register that username for some reason so i used better to keep the alliteration . 
  i will get so many dickpics !, 
  pls, 
  pm me bb . 
  all hail that glorious stache, 
  welcome manspider !, 
  i 've started doing something lately , and i feel so guilty every time i do it because i know how terribly wrong it is , but i just ca n't stop . 
  it all started last wednesday evening . 
  i was starving and all i had was some carrots ( it sounds a little weird , but it happens sometimes ) . 
  i could have ordered something , but as i said , i was starving and did n't really want to wait . 
  then the terrible happened . 
  i sat down to browse reddit while eating the carrots raw , and then i suddenly realized i were playing tagpro !, 
  i did n't mean to do it , i just forgot what i was eating and then i suddenly sat there eating carrots while playing tagpro !, 
  there and then , i was hooked . 
  i had no idea it was that addictive , but it just tasted so amazing !, 
  it actually took a couple of minutes before i started feeling guilty about it , and now i even feel guilty for not feeling guilty in the beginning !, 
  please n00b , how can i stop doing it ? 
  and how can i ever forgive myself ? 
  first of all ; do n't feel guilty for playing with balls while eating a carrot !, 
  carrots are super healthy . 
  plus we all play with balls here . 
  at least i do . 
  just accept that you like it and stop feeling guilty damn it !, 
  ^ p.s. 
  ^ an ^ interview ^ with ^ hootie ^ and ^ a ^ question ? 
  ^ are ^ you ^ trying ^ to ^ get ^ famous ?!, 
  [ is one really the loneliest number ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22qyriwaf-u ),
