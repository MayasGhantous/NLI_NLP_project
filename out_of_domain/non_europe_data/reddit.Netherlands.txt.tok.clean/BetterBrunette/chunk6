  ** daffodils by william wordsworth ** & nbsp ;, 
  i wandered lonely as a cloud, 
  that floats on high o'er vales and hills ,, 
  when all at once i saw a crowd ,, 
  a host , of golden daffodils ;, 
  beside the lake , beneath the trees ,, 
  fluttering and dancing in the breeze . 
  continuous as the stars that shine, 
  and twinkle on the milky way ,, 
  they stretched in never-ending line, 
  along the margin of a bay :, 
  ten thousand saw i at a glance ,, 
  tossing their heads in sprightly dance . 
  the waves beside them danced ; but they, 
  out-did the sparkling waves in glee :, 
  a poet could not but be gay ,, 
  in such a jocund company :, 
  i gazed -- and gazed -- but little thought, 
  what wealth the show to me had brought :, 
  for oft , when on my couch i lie, 
  in vacant or in pensive mood ,, 
  they flash upon that inward eye, 
  which is the bliss of solitude ;, 
  and then my heart with pleasure fills ,, 
  and dances with the daffodils .
