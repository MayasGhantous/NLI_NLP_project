  am i you ? 
  so like this ? 
  `` hey guys , i found this bug/exploit/cheat ( er ) ... '', 
  because people sucked back then . 
  nook, 
  i do n't really know how this works but is it `` it 's [ mister bitey ] and ( it is ) [ me ] '' or `` it 's [ mister bitey and i ] '' with the [ . . ] being the subject . 
  edit : formatting . 
  and when you use your axe it explodes after 3 seconds and the trees spawn powerups which increase your speed , explosion radius or the amount of axes . 
  now try 3 golden radishes turn 1 . 
  you must be fun at parties ... 
  templar assassain ? 
  rip ears biblethump, 
  except hellfire is green, 
  or it 's pseudo random distribution and then they would be right . 
  looks like a deck with golden gazlowe , because of the warrior mech . 
  maybe werewolves of millers hollow is easier to implement ? 
  it is quite similar . 
  i killed someone by using mind spike 7 turns in a row :p, 
  http://critwhale.com/dotamap.jpg this one is a good one imo . 
  it 's only correct if you want a specific spell 3x . 
  if you need just any spell 3 times in a row it is just ( 1/230 ) ^ 2, 
  edit : replied to the wrong person but my point still stands . 
  if it was mind visioned he could n't have played it . 
  and what are you talking about , discarding power overwhelming ? 
  guys , i think you can challenge your friends , but i am not sure . 
  can you ? 
  light bomb, 
  will you ? 
  as does yours, 
  do n't be so mean biblethump, 
  day < month < year so, 
  day/month/year is logical , hence europe does the logical thing . 
  edit : before you say anything like `` woosh '' , i know you were joking ... 
  i have one of these ... 
  it 's a feature , not a bug . 
  that does n't make sence at all ... you are saying you want duplicates so you can disenchant them ? 
  woosh, 
  i hate these kinds of sounds ... 
  it is a joke , look at the title of the original post ... 
  pudge has no counter, 
  i was about to tell you that we are not that arrogant and unreasonable , but then i realized that on average , we are indeed despicable . 
  just keep in mind that definitely not every dutchman is , though . 
  yeah she is dutch , that 's why . 
  edit : i think it 's the milk , but it could be some other conspiracy, 
  if i may ask : what is your age ? 
  unless you read it as `` it 's been a while , since we did n't have one of these '' , 
  a chicken can be a male ... 
  edit : `` in the uk and ireland adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as cocks , whereas in america , australia and canada they are more commonly called roosters . 
  males less than a year old are cockerels . 
  [ 7 ] castrated roosters are called capons ( surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world ) . 
  females over a year old are known as hens and younger females as pullets [ 8 ] although in the egg-laying industry , a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs at 16 to 20 weeks of age . '',

  lol, 
  deep sea baby . 
  do you like to get dissapointed ? 
  indeed undiscovered ; maybe the next expansion brings that card . 
  therazane would destroy everyone in a tournament so it would n't make sence to have her released this expansion thematically . 
  what should i be seeing ? 
  where 's my cat ? 
  what ? 
  that 's more likely , indeed . 
  just realized blizzard did exactly that . 
  dat arcane explosion value though, 
  did someone say `` all minions '' ? 
  the thing is : with a sorcerer 's apprentice you do n't even have to play thaurissan after rhonin , but you can then even play him just to get the discount on maly , and make the missiles 0 with the apprentice ; that seems easier to pull of to me , but what do i know . 
  edit : typos . 
  were you sponsored by google chrome ? 
  rip, 
  [ [ enter the coliseum ] ], 
  [ wow !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juy9_0m3bvk ), 
  at least he typed definitely instead of defiantly ... 
  i guess you could 've used a taskmaster ... 
  this . 
  i hate this . 
  / r/nocontext, 
  carrots !, 
  ^ get ^ ^ your ^ ^ carrots ^ ^ here !, 
  warlock is so bad in this format ; should 've picked paladin . 
  why did you post the same image op posted ? 
  no that would be his right hand ... 
  i want han solo queue, 
   my eyes teared up when i realized what happened ... 
  that 's not too bad, 
  just make a post when eu is up next time . 
  this is `` hello ( sorry for bad english ) '' grade writing . 
  thanks for the post though , 
  it does happen though ; it 's a bug . 
  nah it will be dragon knight for sure, 
  now i 'm curious what theinvisibleprotis called loatheb before the edit, 
   sometimes, 
  always , and it 's not a bug . 
  do n't reroll quests when you have hidden quests left . 
  edit : ben brode confirmed it 's a bug , so apparently i was wrong , 
  / r/nocontext, 
  that 's some high skill cap right there, 
  the ` e ' after a vowel is the same as an umlaut , and the double ss can be used instead of \u00df to make it easier to type . 
  fill me in here . 
  what does mind blast have to with paladin ? 
  go to the battlenet launcher , click on options ( cogwheel ) , and use the option ` scan and repair ' .
