  i like your use of alliteration , 
  you are forgetting that the tier 1 decks are two paladin decks right now , and they both run tirion .

  lay on hands, 
  yes . 
  how do you know he was playing paladin ? 
  freeze mage, 
  83.3 % actually, 
  i think many people spell `` intended purposes '' which of course is stupid .

  lifecoach is never lucky, 
  inner rage would be quite overpowered as a hero power though . 
  yeah , jousting spells is the worst ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kappa,

  how does an assault cuirass keep you cool ? 
  i think it 's the other way around : people who do n't care get a low mmr . 
  no , you did n't, 
  thanks , bot !, 
  good point !, 
  it 's not a circle jerk if no one else does it , is it ? 
   turns out nobody takes you seriously when you e-diagnos a serious condition because you noticed a misaligned letter . 
  better ? 
   insurance business, 
  that 's the problem . 
  insurance is a business . 
   butterfly + blademail, 
  `` hit me .

  that 's exactly what tom_dota said ... you are completely forgetting the fact that valve could just make the arcana that would sell the most , if they really wanted to make money . 
  the compedium vote is just for the community .

  did you just comment the same thing on youtube and reddit ? 
  my goodness ... 
  you left this, 
   she is played like a carry, 
  how people play heroes should not decide which attribute heroes have . 
  do you want dota to have a forced meta like lol ? 
  was that a mines joke ? 
  the bible is n't the word of god ; it is the word of writers who spoke with god . 
  i had to read your comment like 5 times , because of the lack of punctuation . 
  proof = / = evidence , but i agree that it looks like sea just needs good captains .

  well , at least that is what i always assumed . 
  ca n't really find anything about it though ( not on the wiki and such ) so maybe i am just plain wrong .
