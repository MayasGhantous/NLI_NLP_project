  how do you know if someone is smurfing ? 
  americans are so dumb that they do n't know the difference between the eu and europe . 
  it 's the dogs that deserve him . 
  please change all the quests i do n't like, 
  ha , i get it . 
  water color . 
  beause he 's blue . 
  do n't you hate it when you screenshot the stains and flies on your monitor ? 
  maybe closer to dutch and german . 
  maybe because the ` have ' in ' i should have it by tomorrow ' is emphasized ? 
  there 's no way to emphasize the ` have ' part if you join if you say it like ` should 've ' . 
  congratulations , you fucked yourself . 
  do n't leave us in the dark here . 
  what was your original comment ? 
  when you play town of salem in real life . 
  [ oh sweet summer child ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-sexually-identify-as-an-attack-helicopter ), 
  not every assumption requires research, 
  would be the best birthday present ever, 
  what about woman grammar ? 
  something something just the tip . 
  or , you know , he could live in a different country . 
  full stop . 
  you meant to use a full stop . 
  maybe riki roamer with basher ? 
  it 's funny how dad jokes are universal . 
  here in the netherlands we say `` zeg maar wanneer . '', 
  ( just say when [ to stop ] ) , and people answer `` wanneer . '', 
  nah , because we make our own damn sandwiches . 
  i figured, 
  misfits , anyone ? 
  well , are you from holland yourself , or do you live somewhere else in the netherlands ? 
  because the dutch language is god awful to listen to and full of inconsistensies . 
  speaking as a dutchman . 
  yeah that 's definitely one of the reasons i hear many people talk about . 
  the best way to learn a language is hearing it all day every day . 
  we should speak more dutch among international friends . 
  it is funny you say it sounds like a northern german accent , because i live in drenthe ( north east netherlands ) , against the border . 
  the german language on the other side of the border ( emsland ? ), 
  sounds exactly like the drents dialect my grand parents speak . 
  ** tl ; dl : ignore this if you 're not interested **, 
  the double vowels increase both how long you keep it going and the width of the mouth . 
  for example :, 
  the ` o ' in ` onweer ' , meaning lightning storm ( literally ` unweather ' ) is pronounced like the o in the english word ` on ' , but shorter . 
  the ` oo ' in ` schoon ' is pronounced like the ` o ' in ` close ' . 
  same with ` e ' ; sounds like the ` a ' in ` crap ' , and ` ee ' : sounds like the ` ay ' in ` may ' . 
  theres also some weird double vowels :, 
  ` oe ' : pronounced as in ` shoe ', 
  ` eu ' : not existent in english . 
  it 's the same as ` eu ' in french and ' \u00f6 ' in german . 
  ` ui ' : unique to dutch ( except for maybe greek ) , pronounced quite like the canadian way to say ` out ' but not exactly the same . 
  ` au/ou ' : both pronounced like in ` house ', 
  ` ei/ij ' : try to say [ ah , ay , and ee ] in one fluent motion , so inbetween the sounds ` i ' and ` ay ' . 
  we also put multiple vowels together , which does n't change the pronunciation ( oei , ooi , eeuw , aai ) . 
  i almost forgot . 
  if a vowel is written in front of a singular consonant , it 's also an open vowel : ( ` e ' in ` eten ' is pronounced like the ` ee ' in ` kreet ' ( like ` great ' ), 
  i think that 's about it . 
  omg, 
  i get what you mean , but ... the ** best ** food you 've ever eaten ? 
  i would rather go there i think . 
  thanks, 
  but food though, 
  she also licks the dog 's butthole ? 
  i assume he was joking . 
  at least i laughed . 
  it probably was a purposal, 
  obesity, 
  what 's with my not op ? 
  that 's one hell of a typo . 
  we have a winner, 
  does anyone actually know what covfefe was meant to be ? 
  ah , that 's probably covfefe . 
  i 'll have you know that the technical term is osteus claustrophobius, 
  no ragrets, 
  in a few years time you will even cringe at this `` me_irl '' phase of yours . 
  if he 's ready, 
  `` how could this happen to me ? '', 
  do n't kick dogs , people . 
  fuck , i wanted to make that joke until i expanded this comment chain and saw yours . 
   stop whining you stupid . 
   bitch please . 
  i kinda like that tbh, 
  and i 'm living 5 kilometers from nieuw amsterdam in the netherlands right now . 
  i believe you, 
  i thought it was a double ' 3154 ' meme , because the time is 31:45 and the score is 45-13, 
  1997 here . 
  what is payphone ? 
  people born after 1997 did n't get the sarcasm gene . 
  dota as a skyrim mod you mean . 
  it 's basically inception . 
  your height . 
  thanks ren, 
  my mom is indeed overweight . 
  she does n't feel good about it . 
  what if i want my starship to be a pineapple ? 
  because it 's called google drive, 
  if you mean [ this ] ( https://www.google.com/drive/ ) info page , there is a blue button in the middle of the screen that takes your drive . 
  i just tried to be helpful . 
  i guess there 's one click method . 
  i usually just type like ` dr ' in the url bar and press enter . 
  you did the exact same thing .
