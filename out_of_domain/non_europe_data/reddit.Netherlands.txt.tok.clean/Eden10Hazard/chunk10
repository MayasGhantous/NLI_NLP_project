  did he finally get his precious followers ? 
  fuck this shit . 
  burak , please be amazing today , this match might be our last chance . 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  all is foriven lol . 
  let him and yasin cover the wings and sneijder cam . 
  get in there !!, 
  when i saw that header i could n't help but think of drogba 's first match with us . 
  not quite the same , but that was a hell of a comeback !, 
  we ca n't defend for shit though . 
  sabri out ? 
  who 's going to defend ? 
  no tweeting from the birds , no smog, 
  it 's sad we let them score twice in the first half , but it was a great comeback . 
  i 'm already stressing over the fact that all our upcoming games are just as crucial as this one , if not more . 
  maybe chedjou was frustrated because everybody was celebrating while we were very close to screwing up our chances of winning the league . 
  just my two cents . 
  lol , our thread for this match has more comments than any of the threads by the sides who are actually playing . 
  finally , off i go !, 
  edit : i am using the app and do n't have access to it , or at least it does n't show up in the list yet . 
  am i doing something wrong ? 
  definetly . 
  i am a native speaker as well , and the placement test put me in level 8 . 
  i have only done the placement test and some courses after level 8 . 
  i 've found that english and turkish are difficult to translate from one another , due to the grammatical diffrences , which makes it hard to answer the questions properly . 
  i tend to have answers that mean the same thing as the correct answer , but are wrong because they are a bit off . 
  but this is no more than expected from a language like turkish , and i 'm sure it 'll get better as people report their answers . 
  sigh , being a turkish lad in holland during international games has really gone downhill since 2008 . 
  how i miss those times . 
  i just hope we wo n't manifest our utter incompetence to the world , and keep it civil by losing by a small margin . 
  looks neat , you got a new lurker . 
  do you have any more of those ... korays ? 
  mine is probably les intouchables or something . 
  i have n't seen interstellar yet , and i might be overlooking other other movies that came out in the last 5 years . 
  it 's a little over five years old . 
  wow, 
  much old, 
  very nostalgia, 
  bad comparison , messi has much more support from his team . 
  i 'd like to see him try keeping up with zlatan 's stats wihout xavi and iniesta to back him up . 
  it would be hilarious though if they 'd check it . 
  * ` sir , this is a picture of didier drogba ' *, 
  * ` heh , thanks , people tell me i look like him all the time . ', 
  `` do your own research '', 
  is it really unimaginable that there are people who are trying to become a baker ? 
  thought i 'd post it here since it could have been a disaster , killing the entire squad . 
  their busdriver was shot as they were driving in/near trabzon . 
  the bus would have crashed into the canyon if it was n't for serdar k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 , who rushed to the brake pedal . 
  i 'm not much of a reader , but as far as i know ` my name is red ' by orhan pamuk is the most renowned translated turkish novel , and was awarded a nobel prize . 
  if that does n't sound promising , i do n't know what will . 
  noted , i just thought it 'd be alright since there was also a thread about their match earlier , and this is not ordinary news . 
  if it 's a dutch company , there 's no way they had the leeds incident in mind . 
  sneijder sounds like the dutch verb ` snijden ' ( to cut ) . 
  so if anything at all , it 's a pun . 
  yeah , i 'm not sure anymore either . 
  some sources said the driver was shot dead , some said he is in coma . 
  i suppose it might be sensationalist journalism . 
  / r/turkey is leaking ... 
  so you 're the reason they made a japanese twitter account . 
  no freekick there ? 
  i love these sneijder passes that let yasin have a run at the goal . 
  i 'm expecting a tap-in goal today . 
  dae umut looks like robben but is actually shit !! 1 !????? 
  now we wait ... 
  get a hold of this lead ffs . 
  edit : and now each of them is pumping with energy to try and equalize , making us regret all those missed opportunities ... 
  sneijder saves the day !, 
   vvvd, 
  jokes aside , it looks ugly . 
  i personally love our current white and purple kits and hope to see at least one similar kit next season . 
  those four stars would look amazing on a nice minimalist shirt . 
  that 's the best analogy he can come up with ? 
  how anyone thinks this is an acceptable thing to say boggles my mind . 
  i know , but i did n't get why you made line ups with 11 fatih terims . 
  lol, 
  here i am wondering what eden hazard has to do with anything . 
   ca n't even stand tc , the acronym of the turkish republic, 
   still the best president of the turkish republic, 
  echt een kutsite is dat , lol . 
  what 's wrong with 9gag ? 
  it has exactly the same content as reddit , but it gets posted there a little later for some reason . 
  it was an attempt at humour :(, 
  since they steal from reddit all the time , i sarcastically said they are basically the same . 
  good taste , op !, 
  i thought you were german because of your username , but let me tell you about education in europe and america . 
  ** history curriculum in holland ** :, 
  - greek and roman eras, 
  - middle ages in europe, 
  - early modern era in europe and the colonies of europe, 
  - modern era in europe, 
  - wolrd wars fought by europe and allies of europe, 
  - ** history curriculum in america ** :, 
  - founding fathers of murica, 
  - civil war in murica, 
  - murica vs hitler, 
  - murica vs japs, 
  - murica vs commies, 
  - murica in ` nam, 
  - murica in space, 
  turkish history classes might revolve around the turkish nation , but they are not unique in that regard .
