   what is your favorite thing about turkey ? 
  weather , nature , and cuisine . 
  also , the rich history . 
   and what is your least favorite thing about turkey ? 
  the government . 
  it 's conservative and very authoritarian . 
   who is the most famous person in turkey we have heard of ? 
  probably erdogan , unfortunately . 
   and who is the most famous person that we have n't heard of ? 
  one of the most influential turkish musicians ( mainly rock ) of the 20th century , who became popular in japan as well . 
  [ here 's a concert of him in japan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nztyeusedm ), 
   if i were to travel to turkey , what places should i visit ? 
  the west coast of turkey ( istanbul , izmir , and mugla ) is supposed to be very nice . 
   and what places should n't i visit ? 
  south-eastern turkey . 
  you ca n't go wrong with istanbul , 
  there 's a ` travelling to turkey ' section in the sidebar , maybe that 'll be helpful to look into . 
  hakan \u015e\u00fck\u00fcr is # 1 because galatasaray is # 1 . 
  happy cakeday !, 
  according to wikipedia :, 
  the huns were a group of eurasian nomads , appearing from east of the volga , who migrated into europe c. 370 and built up an enormous empire there . 
  their main military techniques were mounted archery and javelin throwing . 
  they were possibly the descendants of the xiongnu ( hsiung-nu ) who had been northern neighbors of china three hundred years before and may be the first expansion of ** turkic people ** across eurasia . 
  even though they were in the process of developing settlements before their arrival in europe , the huns were a society of pastoral warriors whose primary form of nourishment was meat and milk , products of their herds . 
  i 'm giving it the benefit of the doubt . 
  zlatan ibrahimovi\u0107 is a cult hero of some sort , especially among teenagers , because of his badass image . 
  ** q : ** how is he viewed in sweden in general , and how is his reputation among swedish teens ? 
  ** q : ** which swedish city do you guys consider the nicest to visit or live in ? 
  to add to this ; there are many poor people who are pressured into voting for erdogan and his party because they provide them some food and shitty unsafe jobs . 
  same here man , i 'm a huge fan , despite having grown up after his death . 
  yeah the video is amazing . 
  he was fluent in english , french and japanese as well apparently . 
  he was way ahead of his time , imo . 
  that makes sense . 
  they are not that closely related after all . 
  this is a perfect opportunity to get back on track , but we chose to start the match with umut and olcan . 
  shit !, 
  i hope we can still win this . 
  finally !!, 
  most definetly, 
   the kanye west of football , i guess, 
  that 's a surprisingly accurate comparison . 
  haha , i guess everybody is a tad biased towards their own hometown . 
  i do n't really blame him for this , since we 're bad at maintaining leads . 
  however , i really hope to see a line-up with sneijder , yasin , and emre next week . 
  the stress umut causes me is unreal . 
   ` in the end my father could n't sleep due to what the armenians have experienced . 
  it says : my father did n't make it up, 
   i can post youtube articles and wikipedia links as well ... 
  and therein lies the ultimate problem . 
  youtube videos , wikipedia links , and anecdotes from your grandpa , but never even a shred of historic evidence . 
  google ` burden of proof ', 
  amazing goal !, 
  easier than taking candy from a toddler ... 
  melo apparantly . 
  i hope our midfield does n't get overrun now . 
  we should have just called it a day after his first season . 
  i can already feel the tension intensifying . 
  * gathers wikipedia sources that verify the turkishness of kebab and baklava *, 
  and rak\u0131, 
  i 'm barely active at the moment , but i 'm ` learning ' german , french and italian . 
  german and french because i already know the languages to a certain extent . 
  my interest in italian was sparked by the godfather . 
  ever since i saw those movies and understood some italian scenes without subtitles , i want to be able to speak italian . 
  but there 's an entire subreddit of turkish people , i 'm sure you can find friends to chat/skype with here . 
   somebody tries the same type of banter in / r/greece, 
   mfw he gets threatened with a ban, 
   mfw i have no face, 
  if it 's any consolation , i do appreciate quality banter . 
  this is why kebab can not into eu !!!! 1 !, 
  in turkey , there have been tv-series and movies in which greece is a theme . 
  some examples :, 
  - a soap opera about a turkish fisherman who has a double life in greece and turkey . 
  iirc , he had a wife and family in both countries and tried to hide them from eachother . 
  - the soap opera * yabanc\u0131 damat * ( foreign groom ) about a greek-turkish marriage and their families . 
  - the movie * dedemin \u0130nsanlar\u0131 * ( my grandpa 's people * , about an old turkish man who was born in crete but moved to turkey during the population exchange . 
  his last wish is to see his birthplace before he dies . 
  ** ( q ) ** i was wondering whether there were similar greek movies/series from the opposite point of view , and in your opinion , are they any good ? 
  ** ( q ) ** turkey makes a shitload of tv-series that often air in the middle east and balkans as well . 
  is this the case in greece as well ? 
  if so , are there any particular series that became popular ? 
   the dramas are too dramatic ( and they seem to take themselves way to seriously ) and the comedies are usually too shallow or too local ( by which i mean they wo n't make much sense outside greece ) . 
  it 's exactly the same in turkey . 
  the most popular comedy in recent times is * recep \u0130vedik * , which is very simplistic movie revolving about a man who makes a fool of himself because he is too rude/barbaric . 
  there 's an internet meme of some sort in turkey of pretending something is greek when it gets attention in an international forum , when they consider it embarrasing . 
  eg : i love recep \u0130vedik , sahanos gokbakaros is the best greek comedian !!,
