  * * back again *, 
  no krillin , no party . 
  haha , that 's an amazingly accurate description of the recurring piccolo pattern . 
  the shade of red is perfect , if the yellow was a bit darker it would be our colours exactly . 
  well played , op , well played . 
  wow , that 's terrible , til . 
  yes , let 's all come to terms that world could never stop being a hive of scumbags and villainry . 
  what is this `` professional degree '' thing , and how do i acquire it ? 
  i thought that word was only used in german ? 
  if i 'm not mistaken , motorway is uk english and highway is us english . 
  expressway is the same as a freeway , so just a long empty road without ( m ) any intersections etc. 
  in hindsight , i think the word ` autobahn ' should be implemented in the english language . 
  english terms are confusing . 
  you should see [ this video of cristiano ronaldo and his * lookalike * ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opbx1q5cy4s ) . 
  he appeared on a talkshow and a commercial of some sort , all because he looks like ronaldo . 
  shooting dead people would be silly anyway . 
  i imagine so . 
  he is a huge fan who travelled halfway across turkey and did everything he could to meet ronaldo . 
  he even tried to chase the bus in which the real madrid players were travelling . 
  i actually thought * he * was a girl before i watched dbz . 
  * confession * ; i think having a strong urge to punch someone just after seeing their face makes you a sociopath . 
  yeah i know , but i thought the charachter android 17 was female in dbz . 
  i was referring to subreddit , cuntmuffin . 
  he plays for * imaginary madrid * in * not la liga bbva * . 
  then why do n't you just learn to read properly ? 
  i explicity said ** just ** after seeing their face . 
  you 're good , op just messed up a little . 
   says ** where as ** instead of ** whereas **, 
   calls himself a professional, 
  kek, 
  jesus fucking christ , how dense are you . 
  i was talking about how people ** on that subreddit ** are sociopaths for wanting to punch people ** just ** because of their faces . 
   and i fucking said there is usually, 
  no , you said ` sometimes ' not ` usually ' . 
  now gtfo already . 
  most definetly . 
  your username is majestic . 
  just read what i say for once . 
  ** you ** said sometimes instead of usually . 
  you . 
  *** not *** me . 
  do you understand ? 
  do you knowings how to speakings english ? 
  is you understandings ? 
  i would n't even want burak coming to the training sessions with this guy around . 
  woah , calm down man . 
  ah , that 's great , thanks . 
  were you watching an everton match ? 
  i spotted that crest on the screen . 
  i really like chelsea , but i ca n't help but feel pretentious if i call myself a fan , if that makes any sense . 
  i 'm a lifelong galatasaray fan , but i 've gotten attached to chelsea too . 
  also , eden is a naruto fan too , did you know ? 
  that 's spot on , i just did n't know how to put it . 
  it really annoys me how people just declare themselves a fan of a succesful club in a country far away and put themselves on the same level as people who grew up with a club and support them through through good times as well as bad times . 
  so i try not be * that guy . 
  yeah man , this guy is just amazing . 
  i hope to see him become the best of the world some day . 
  sure do , chelsea is amazing to watch . 
  i 'm a huge fan of drogba so i try to enjoy every bit of watching him play the final chapters of his career . 
  it 's a shame i 've never seen him live , but i have visited stamford bridge once and i loved it . 
  i hope to be able to attend a match someday . 
  by the way , where do you live , because it sounds as if you 're in the same position as me ? 
  i 'm from holland . 
  me too, 
  lol , what does turkiye have to do with anything . 
  lmao , this is why i am glad about not using facebook . 
  i was in london when chelsea were playing fc basel ( away ) in europaleague semifinals and the ambiance in pubs were great . 
  i 'd love to see what it 's like in the bridge itself . 
  heh , glad to hear that . 
  so i 'm not weird for liking a team that knocked my favorite club out of the champions league . 
  :d i actually got weird looks for using chelsea all the time on fifa and such around the time they beat galatasaray . 
  and he scores !, 
  best turkish striker . 
  +1 for relevant biggie reference , mein neger . 
  do burak and sel\u00e7uk even understand tactics to begin with ? 
  damn that imcompetent little cunt , amirite ? 
  i 'm slightly deprived of sleep and having a hard time figuring out what the joke is ? 
  ah , okay , i did n't get it because i assumed it was a chain of events over the season . 
  nice try , michael cera . 
  frank lampard !, 
  no , that would be shit . 
  not having access to goku artwork because you do n't use facebook . 
  such is life . 
  if at all possible , can you get that kid 's autograph ? 
  because that is the most badass thing ever . 
  does that mean chicarito plays on the wing too ? 
  edit : oh right , ronaldo as a striker , sorry . 
  yes ? 
  oh you meant hazzard , sorry . 
  did he look anything like ben stiller , by any chance ? 
   the name taboo, 
  i do n't get it ? 
  was it taboo to give your kid a proper name or something ? 
  and what 's wrong with that ? 
  you should introduce it as a different person . 
  as in : there 's this guy savage johnson and john dickbutt . 
  did you proceed to call her lahyphena ? 
  lmao , that 's hilarious . 
  what a great goal , i love this lad . 
  edit : not that it matters anymore but eses ' second goal looks like it could have been offside .
