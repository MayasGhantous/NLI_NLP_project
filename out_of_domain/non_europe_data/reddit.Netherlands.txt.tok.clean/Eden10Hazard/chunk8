  when your friend activates your trapcard, 
  i am now . 
  i will at least give it a shot . 
  oh , i 'm sure they 'd find a way . 
  i was just referring to the ` you would n't steal a car ' phrase . 
  on the bright side , he 's made some good friends by doing so . 
  holy shit , me too . 
  i can imagine that the brazillians call him hazardinho . 
  i do n't think oscar is that tall but he does appear so next to eden . 
  finally , a meta reference i understood immediately . 
  * yup , * reddit has all kinds of ** wizardy ** . 
  ... not that i know of ... 
  i do n't see why they would put sinan on the right instead of pandev , but oh well . 
  i clicked on * load more comments * , aaand of course this comment is there . 
  why do you insist on following that overused pattern ? 
  it 's not event relevant - at all - this time . 
  so do i. 
  haha , that reminds me of a little kid i saw at a barbershop who showed the barber a picture of sinan g\u00fcm\u00fcs on his dad 's phone , saying he wanted his haircut . 
  it thought that was awesome . 
  the red strip near the collar reminds me of gucci . 
  is this amrabat 's design ? 
  really ? 
  * like * no one ever was . 
   because that would just prove to the world that they are mindless cunts who will abandon common sense in favor of a juicy headline . 
  they usually are . 
  i 'm fairly sure you were not the only one . 
  yeah , but it really sucks with regard to our chances to win the league . 
  speaking of our management , yarsuvat 's made some childish remarks about aysal , saying he gathered all his strawberries and ran off , which kinda put me off . 
  i think it 's a pretty immature move . 
  he should just make sure he does his job properly . 
  edit : this is our board , not our management . 
  sorry for the confusion . 
  i 'm young and got nothing to contribute , but appearantly sneijder spoke some words of admiration about hagi on gstv and said something along the lines of :, 
  * i wish you a happy 50th birthday . 
  you 're a legend at this club . 
  i hope to be like you one day . 
  by the way , namelijk means namely . 
  ( maybe you can get something shipped to canada ), 
  always this one dude , who is he ? 
  i feel like i am watching a sunday league game . 
  i never thought i 'd appreciate commentary this much . 
  or maybe / r/thenetherlands has some suggestions, 
  how about letting them live happily for just a little while ? 
  sneijder 's goal against juventus though , that one still gives me goosebumps every time i see it . 
  that goal by olcan is amazing too , especially burak 's pass . 
  best answer ever . 
  saying that line with an attitude . 
  god , i hate their social media team . 
  stop trying to be chelsea 's cool french cousin who has a love-hate relationship with cfc , you 're not on our level . 
  yup , people get butthurt when a club becomes rich due to a new owner . 
  but once they start winning some major trophies , that 's when the real hate starts . 
  as a fan of galatasaray , what 's even more puzzling to me is how they are among the most popular on twitter , but relatively low on facebook likes . 
  all the turks i know are avid facebook users ( t\u00fcrkiye \u00d6zil < 3 ) but do n't even use twitter at all . 
  nah , galatasaray was the 3rd most popular ( football ) club on twitter before they got sneijder or drogba . 
  it 's not meaningful either way , and i guess i 'll never know . 
  half man half namek, 
  i wish our first team was doing as well as the u21 is doing . 
  they are 1st in their league by a four point margin . 
  * romantiek intensiveert *, 
   definitely, 
   might have, 
  that 's a contradiction :p, 
  fuck yeah , chedjou and burak . 
  let 's hold on to this lead now . 
  c'mon let 's see how far we can take it . 
  sneijder delivers . 
  my euphoria is off the hook . 
  credit to yasin for the assists too . 
  lol @ selcuk indicating tarik to pass back to him and tarik just passing backwards . 
  idiot . 
  emre \u00c7olak in . 
  we should be able to have more control over the game with one man more , it seems balikersir are thinking ` screw it , we got nothing to lose ' . 
  why would you ** not ** pass to burak who 's right in front of the goal but to the right instead . 
  i agree . 
  i want galatasaray to win a domestic treble really bad , but just the league is instense as it is . 
  i 'm hoping this :, 
   we win or tie against fenerbah\u00e7e away, 
   besiktas beat liverpool and advance, 
   besiktas wins or draws against fenerbah\u00e7e away, 
   besiktas tries to win europa league , gets injuries and fucks up in superlig, 
   we win everything, 
  surely the hunter kid will hunt her down . 
  yes you are . 
   scarface pyjamas, 
  this might be besides the point , but that sounds awesome . 
  what did you need jaw surgery for ? 
  really , do you have a link ? 
  my jaw feels like it 's too loosely attached to my skull on one side , if that makes any sense . 
  i 'm hoping it 's no big deal , because having to get surgery would be a nuisance . 
  i imagine that it must have taken a while to get used to the new alignment of your teeth . 
  i only had braces but it hurt like hell and i preferred to eat as little as possible at first . 
  i think this half will be like 30 minutes of sloppy play and then a goal out of nowhere will give us the victory . 
  please sneijder , make it happen . 
  haha what a goal . 
   fuck you all, 
  in form burak please . 
  good play by sel\u00e7uk but umut fucked it up . 
  bjk lost . 
  fener lost . 
  today was a good day .
