  and all that , just because of a bigger cult . 
  but we are not unlike them , for our souls can be shaped like theirs as well . 
  in sovngarde , the ancestors of the north still reside , even though all souls get wiped . 
  our stories and tales of hero 's shapes them , creating a collective memory . 
  these are the powers we hold , and this is why the ` gods ' have put us in this prison , to feed of our power . 
  but how do they take our power you might ask ? 
  they harvest our very souls , stripping them of all our hard labour and knowledge , using this raw , aetherial power to still their ferocious hunger . 
  and do n't expect the daedra to treat you any better ; oh no , people . 
  these demons of oblivion also want your essence , but the only difference is that they do not need it . 
  they just hunger for it . 
  so today , my brothers and sisters , we will resent the gods , the aedra and the daedra , both anuic and phadomaic . 
  but we will not stop there : we will destroy everything linked to these pretenders . 
  we will destroy their temples and their shrines . 
  we will storm the metaphysical towers that uphold mundus , tearing down the structures our ancestors were tricked into building . 
  let us make mundus collapse , and make us retake our rightful position of pure et ` ada , unsundered and uncached . 
  today , brothers and sisters , we will bring forth the end of everything , the oh so glorious and freeing end !, 
  for some time now , i have been working on a pet project to redesign the dragon language in skyrim ( as some of you might know , bethesda has done a very poor job of designing it ) . 
  since most of it is not established by lore , or even conflicting with it , i wo n't post it here . 
  however , i did n't change anything about the pronunciation , so here it is . 
  ( the characters between brackets are the ipa spelling of the sound ),

  aa [ a  as in br ** a ** ( uncommon in english ), 
  ah [ \u0251 ] as in f ** a ** ther, 
  b [ b ] as in ** b ** ad,

  ey [ ei ] as in p ** ay **, 
  f [ f ] as in ** f ** ail, 
  g [ \u0261 ] as in ** g ** ood, 
  h [ x ] not present in english , pronounciation varies from scottish-gaelic lo ** ch ** ( lake ) , to dutch ** g ** aan ( to go ), 
  i [ \u026a ] as in b ** i ** n, 
  ii [ i ] as in s ** ea **,

  q [ k ] as in ** c ** ool, 
  r [ \u0280 ] or [ r ] ^ 1 [ r ] does not appear in english , but is known as a rolling r ( more akin to the northern-netherlandish r than the scottish r ) , [ r ] as in bee ** r **, 
  s [ s ] as in ** s ** nake, 
  t [ t ] as in ** t ** rait, 
  u [ u  as in d ** o **,

  ( ' ) [ \u0294 ] ^ 3 as the stop in uh-oh, 
  ^ 1 when r appears at the start or the middle of a word , it is generally pronounced as [ r ] . 
  at the end of the word , it is pronounced as [ r ], 
  ^ 2 while there is a individual letter for uu in the dragon script , it has not appeared in any spoken form as of yet, 
  ^ 3 while there are no individual letters for th and ' in the dragon script , they do appear in some words , for example : thu'um ( in which th is treated as a distinct group , instead of individual sounds ), 
  ^ 4 for the variation of pronunciation , the same rules apply as in english . 
  addressed to : georges devereau , chief scholar , imperial geographical society, 
  concerning : recent research into the religion of the skaal, 
  14th of frost fall, 
  honourable chief scholar ,, 
  i write to you yet again . 
  this time , however , i will not bore you with a obscure theory of mine , instead giving you the results of my research into the religious practises of the skaal people of solstheim , as ordered . 
  i , my department , and a lost dunmer scholar i found making my way back to the imperial city were very interested and enthusiastic about the results ( knowing the history of my department , this does not say much ) . 
  solstheim will appear slightly familiar to the avid traveller , as it appears very similar to the north of skyrim . 
  after some days of hiking through the snow and forests , we found the skaal village in the high north of the island . 
  surprisingly , the skaal were very hospitable to me and my assistants , and we were allowed to speak with the chief and the shaman , as they call their spiritual leader . 
  we were treated fairly by them , and they shared whatever few they have . 
  the first thing we set out to do was collecting the local myths . 
  i have to say , the shaman was of great help to us , and understood our purpose , and was forgiving to our ignorance in the ways of the skaal . 
  while the skaal are ethnic nords , they , at first sight , do not share anything with the culture of the nords of skyrim . 
  instead of worshipping the aedra or daedra , like anyone on the mainland does , they worship just one god , which they call the all-maker . 
  the all-maker is responsible for the creation of all and everything . 
  since the all-maker is responsible for all that happens with the skaal ( their view of the world does not extend outside of solstheim ) , and is , in effect , nature itself , the skaal view nature as sacred . 
  as a result , they are relatively peaceful , and will only kill out of necessity . 
  this extends to not only internal or external conflict , but also to hunting and woodcutting . 
  the all-maker is not alone though , as there is another alone standing deity , the adversary . 
  this demon-spirit is responsible for all bad that happens to the skaal . 
  the all-maker is almost always powerful enough to combat the adversary , although barely at times . 
  the next step for us was to draw conclusions from this information . 
  this was a hard task , but i hope the information will be reliable enough . 
  seeing the unique role of the all-maker , it will be very hard to identify him . 
  it is commonly believed that the all-maker does not represent an aedra , or all aedra at once , but anu itself , with the adversary playing the role of padomay , being the anti-pole of the all-maker . 
  this theory is mainly based upon the fact that skaal culture is very conservative , and that the status quo is seen as the best possible status . 
  in short , the skaal worship stasis , resenting change . 
  while there is certainly something to say for this theory , i believe that it is based upon a misunderstanding of skaal culture . 
  while the skaal are indeed conservative , they also seem to have developed some form of moral duality . 
  they attribute all positive things to the all-maker , while all negative events are the work of the adversary . 
  with this duality in mind , i would like to propose another identity for these two beings , a identity that finds itself on a very different level than our understanding of the forces and beings present in our world . 
  i propose that the all-maker and the adversary do not represent any known being , but purely the concepts of good and evil . 
  i base this of multiple points , which i will detail hereafter . 
  firstly , i wish to debunk the anu-padomay theory , to make way for a revised thesis . 
  the main fact i base this of , is the fact that the skaal see life as a positive thing ( like most races of man do ) . 
  as we know , lorkhan was a strong padomaic force . 
  seeing that he would be incorporated in the identity of the all-maker does not add up to the theory that the all-maker is anu , or a purely anuic force . 
  secondly , i wish to point out the strong link the skaal make between the all-maker and all positive things and events in their society . 
  as stated earlier , the skaal see the all-maker as purely good , and the adversary as purely evil . 
  it is not a far stretch to consider these two beings to be the ( might i add : mortal ) concepts of good and evil .
