  khajiiti music would appear slightly alien to us , as with all other forms of music . 
  their central tone would be e # , seeing their connection to the moons , and the fact that that is azura 's note . 
  along with this , the khajiit would have the notes c ( mara ) , d # ( mehrunes dagon ) , f ( kynareth ) , f # ^ # ( hircine ) , g ( stendarr ) , g # ^ \u266d ( sanguine ) , a ( akatosh ) , a # ^ \u266d ( hermaeus mora ) , a # ( sheogorath ) , and b # ( mephala ) . 
  they would avoid the use of c # ^ \u266d , as it represents namira , a daedra khajiit hold a bad image of . 
  these tones seem somewhat disorganised , but this is very fitting with khajiiti culture , which is based around many different groups of khajiit subspecies , and an altogether carefree nature . 
  since argonians do not recognise anything supernatural besides the hist and sithis , it is unlikely that they would have a form of music anywhere near recognisable to our music . 
  indeed it is described in ` the infernal city ' that argonian chanting sounds cacophonic to the rest of tamriel . 
  with this i will conclude my findings . 
  thanks to the people who gave me input with this idea , and especially to myrrlyn , who 's music posts were a great inspiration and source . 
  the following is a log from recent conversations with ls over the irc channel . 
   [ 19:57 ] < + hollymarkie  quick question : what is lorkhan 's name in ehlnofex ? 
  [ 19:58 ] <lawrenceschick his name is steven, 
   [ 20:20 ] <lawrenceschick did you know that the hist are trees given life by a long lost race of magical forest elves ? 
  i 'm thinking of renaming them `` ents '' in the common tongue . 
   [ 20:23 ] <lawrenceschick thank you . 
  i ca n't wait for you to play eso . 
  here 's another teaser : argonians are malnourished dragons who got real small so they could hide from ysgrammor in black marsh . 
  but they do n't remember that anymore . 
  do n't tell them . 
  what this information means , and what its implications will be , is yet to say . 
  so to tie in with [ myrr 's post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1rhg1f/a_bedtime_story_about_the_elves/ ) about a children 's tale about elves , i wanted to show the other side of it . 
  enjoy !, 
  `` do you want me to tell you a short story before you shut your eyes ? '', 
   `` not really , dad . '', 
  `` so once all races were one ... '', 
   `` dad ... '', 
  `` so once ... '', 
   `` dad !! '', 
  `` be quiet for a minute !, 
  so once all races were one , and they were called the ehlnofey . '', 
   `` sigh ... that 's not even true . '', 
  `` anyway , these ehlnofey , at some point , decided that they did not want to be a group anymore ... '', 
   `` and they became the elves and men . 
  can i go to sleep now ? '', 
  `` just shut up for a moment . 
  so they split and become the elves and men . 
  you know that the elves , then the aldmer , became all of our wondrous , and less wondrous ... well mostly less wondrous ... '', 
   `` how long is this story ? '', 
  `` if you say one more word you are going back to the breeding side !, 
  where was i ? 
  yeah !, 
  so you had all these merkinds , but you knew that already . 
  what i am going to tell you now , is the tale of men . 
  you see , men was scattered back then . 
  they were n't one , as we elves , but they were many different groups . 
  some decided to stay here , some decided to go to the high north , and some went to the far west . 
  the men that stayed here , the ne ... '', 
   `` nedes . '', 
  `` the nedes , that stayed here , they were uncivilised , and lived in small groups . 
  some of them lived peacefully with our brothers , the direnni , and , after many years , they took the good elven blood , and they became the bretons . '', 
   `` than why do you hate them ? '', 
  `` not important . '', 
  `` some of these nedes ... '', 
   `` imperials ? '', 
  `` some of these nedes did not live peacefully with the elves , and eventually , even though our brothers , the ayleids . '', 
   `` we got a lot of bothers , have n't we ? '', 
  `` for godssa ... 
  so they did not want our civilisation !, 
  they became angry , and they kicked out our brothers . 
  and these men wanted more , and they became the imperials , and they ruled the entire continent . 
  do you even want to hear the story ? '', 
  i already told you . '', 
  `` well , suck it up . 
  there were more men though ... '', 
   `` yes , there were countless tribes , scattered throughout all of nirn ... '', 
  `` i 'm talking about the biggest groups , let me finish !, 
  so there were also men in the far west . 
  they were different from the other men , just as our brothers there ... '', 
   `` more brothers !? 
  our parents did n't lay still at night , did they ? '', 
  `` i swear to the gods , if you open your mouth again ... count to ten , count to ten ... . 
  so , i was saying ... these men in the west were different , just like the elves there , the left handed elves . 
  these men did not love the world , just like us . 
  but just like any form of men , they wanted the whole continent . 
  and when they could not have it , they sank it . 
  so now the elves there were dead . 
  or , at least , we think they are dead ... not important . 
  so now the men there needed a new home , so they sailed east , to tamriel , and they took what is now hammerfell . '', 
  `` now , there was a last race of men ... '', 
   `` can you finish this ? '', 
  `` this last race of men were from the high north . 
  they could not agree , and a lot of people died . 
  some wanted to go back to where they once came from , and they returned to tamriel . 
  they met our broth ... the elves there , the falmer . 
  these elves only wanted peace , but eventually even they got a fight with the men of the north . 
  the men , as are all men , were weak , and had to go back to the high north , to get more men . 
  so now this man came back with five hundred others to kill ... '', 
   `` is n't five hundred a bit few to kill an entire race ? '', 
  `` that is how the story goes and i do n't care if you like it or not !, 
  so he came back with his five hundred men , and they killed all the elves . '', 
  `` so that is how the story of men ends . 
  can you sleep now ? '', 
   `` no , dad , i ca n't . 
  the sun is already up again , because you ca n't tell a short story . '', 
  `` well , sucks to be you i guess . '', 
  it has been many cycles now , since the serpent made his skin-ball , on which we stride . 
  or it was this cycle . 
  all we know is that sep 's lost skins have devoured his skin-ball multiple times , every time ending with ruptga impaling it with his big stick , having us begin anew .
