  faolan replied : `` i know her well , for that is h\u00e9stram u\u00ed aledb , the queen of the c\u00edroid . 
  the eight pronged spear is given to them by the gods , or found in their spire [ for this was a number they were obsessed about ] . 
  she is the commander of their army , and she will ride here to rule over us and to conquer us , for we are not yet her own . 
  the strength of her sword-arm is formidable , for the technique was taught to her by her late husband . 
  if any of you meet her on the field , spare her , for combat with her is worthy of a king . 
  andoe continued : `` next to her came an older man . 
  he was wearing a gold and blue robe . 
  he had a beard long enough to shelter five men on a stormy day , and his posture was grand . 
  even though i could not understand them speaking , i could hear the sweetness in his voice , and the beauty of his language . 
  his words became poems and songs and back again , and i could see the army change and swell and back again with every word he spoke . '', 
  `` who might this singer be ? '', 
  asked h\u00edrti . 
  faolan replied : `` i know him well , for he is tul\u00edr , who is the priest from the chantry of kai , who is held in the highest esteem by the c\u00edroid . 
  his words are sweeter than honey , and it is said that he can turn ale into mead , which sooths the throat , and makes the body strong . 
  his words can inspire kingdoms , and crush others , and with him as their priest , there is no telling of what the army is capable . 
  if any of you meet him on the field , spare him , for exchanging poetry and song with him is worthy of a king . 
  andoe continued : `` riding behind the woman was a small men , beardless as is the custom of the c\u00edroid . 
  his armour was old and dinted , and every bold was rusted . 
  on his back were leather straps to hold a shield and a javelin , but they were not there . 
  on his hip was a broadsword in its scabbard , with a wooden hilt , covered in mold and moss . 
  he had an arched back , and did not look as fierce or strong as the other men that stood on that field . 
  even though his appearance was that of the c\u00edroid , i could tell that he was one of us , although i did not recognise him , for he was facing the army , and not me . 
  `` i know who this small men is , '' yelled h\u00edrti , and all the men of the hall joined h\u00edrti in his anger . 
  faolan ordered them all to sit down . 
  `` indeed , we know who this small men is , for he is orc\u00ed . 
  yes , he was one of us , once . 
  nine years ago , this snake was banished from our lands , and it seems he has now found shelter with the h\u00e9stram . 
  he is more dangerous than he seems , since he knows all of us , and our weaknesses . 
  his body has grown merged with his armour , for it was the only thing he had ever since he was banished from the reach . 
  do not fear his broadsword , for it is only of wood , and a child 's weapon at best . 
  his iron sword i posses , for it was i that found out his treacherous tongue and works . 
  when i confronted him , i broke his shield and drove my sword through his right leg , leaving him cripple . 
  i disarmed his sword-arm , and kept his sword , covered with his own blood as a reminder to never betray the eagle . 
  if any of you meet him on the field , do not spare him , for the head of this man is not a fit spoil of war for a king . '', 
  `` now , andoe , ride to the other kingdoms , and call to arms the other kings . 
  let them have their own armies and their own men , but let them be prepared for the beast of the south coming for them . 
  ride to renach in karth and mashuig in dr\u00e1chst\u00e1ir and c\u00eder at the leap and fernhete in sian h\u00e1irgramen and huithar in karthwasten and fedelm in r\u00e9chthadb and m\u00e1ithramail in n\u00e9mach and balgadb in badb and l\u00e9ech in sian sp\u00edr flach and , when you are done , return to me in the remainder of the reach . '', 
  this was what andoe did . 
  he went to karth and dr\u00e1chst\u00e1ir and the leap and sian h\u00e1irgramen and karthwasten and r\u00e9chthadb and n\u00e9mach and badb and sian sp\u00edr flach and , when he was done , he returned to the remainder of the reach , to alert all the kings , and to have them raise their own armies and to have them gather their own men . 
  this was not hard , for all had heard rumbling in the south , and all were eager for war . 
  h\u00e9stram u\u00ed aledb returned from her inspection of the army , and put down her armament in her tent . 
  next to her were tul\u00edr and orc\u00ed , who accompanied the queen in her everything . 
  h\u00e9stram said : `` tell me , orc\u00ed , of the lands i will conquer and rule , which will be mine in the coming months . 
  how are these lands , what roams there , and who are the men i will be about to meet ? '', 
  orc\u00ed replied : `` do not fear , my queen , for i know these lands well , and are familiar with what roams there and who you will be about to meet . '', 
  `` know that these lands are rocky and rugged and barely forested . 
  they are unlike anything you will know ; not like the plains and meadows and glens of coloviagh ; not like the jungles and the wealds and the forests of nibhenn ; not like the water and the city and the white-gold of seshach . 
  the reach is a land not fit for foreigners . 
  be careful where you step , o queen , for every rock and mountain can shift in an instance , especially for outlanders . '', 
  h\u00e9stram said : `` i 'm am not afraid of nature , for my people have a long history of changing it , as we will have in the future . 
  ever since the demon-elves build their idolatry to their ancestors , the lands of the c\u00edroid have been changing to the whim of its inhabitants . 
  no mountain will stop me and my legions , just as no river will . '', 
  `` tell me , orc\u00ed , of what roams in these lands '', 
  orc\u00ed answered : `` know that the creatures in these lands are different from anything in your own lands . 
  there are bears taller than mountains , wolfs that can bite through a solid iron sword , and cats with tusks the size of a full-grown man 's arm . 
  killing any of these is worthy of a king . 
  but these are not the most dangerous creatures . 
  there are spirits and creatures some say are divine . 
  they command the air , or the water , or the animals , or dark forces all together . 
  we are safe from them because we pay tribute to their mothers and fathers , but i do not know if this will be enough for the c\u00edroid , for these lands or not yet yours . '', 
  `` tell me , orc\u00ed , what kind of people live in these lands '', 
  orc\u00ed answered : `` know that these men are the most dangerous thing in the reach . 
  they are a proud people , and will not bow down easily . 
  no men of the reach is willing to give up his house when he is alive . 
  you will not get these lands to bow down with diplomacy . 
  every boy in the reach has been taught in the sword-feat and the shield-feat and the javelin-feat when they were old enough to walk , for it is part of their games . 
  any reachman would be the better of a c\u00edroid . '', 
  h\u00e9stram said : `` i have more men than they . 
  i do not fear them , for they should fear me and my might army , which is bigger than any amassed yet . 
  i have sworn to slay them eightfold for any men that is slain of me , for this is a holy number to the c\u00edroid . '', 
  orc\u00ed replied : `` those are big words , my queen . 
  i know that their kings have sworn to slay your men nine fold for any that is slain of them , for that is a holy number to the reachmen . 
  there men might fall easily , but the kings wo n't , for they are stronger than any mortal [ and some even say they are divine ] . 
  they love the trust of their men , and will act accordingly . '', 
  tul\u00edr joined in : `` they are heathens , every last one of them !, 
  they still hang on to the old belief of the one , while we know that missing deity is no other than kai himself . 
  they are stuck in their ways , and they will need the order to bring them sense . 
  if this is to be done by my song , h\u00e9stram 's sword , or orc\u00ed 's venom , so be it . '', 
  orc\u00ed said : `` still , it is best to be careful with them . 
  even in my current state , crippled that i am , and having nothing more than a wooden sword , i am still able to beat at least one battalion of thousand and eight men , sustaining as many wounds so that not a surface the size of a spear point will not be covered by bruises and cuts and blood , and live . 
  i can guarantee that every single reachmen that will take up arms will be able of the same feats , and especially their kings , who will be able to beat nine battalions of thousand and eight without as much as a scratch . '', 
  h\u00e9stram became mad with orc\u00ed , and she exclaimed , in a voice that some said was that of a dragon , and made the mountains from the dark lands in the east to those of the divided west tremble , and made the seas of the ice in the north and those of the sun in the south rise and swell , and return back again : `` my armies are not the same men as you reach-scorn fight !, 
  they are not merely nede or nord or kothri or men-of-ge or mer , but are something else entirely !, 
  they are the result of tamhr\u00e9al , the people of the heart of it , the most exalted and revered of all !, 
  their swearing on their gods will be their undoing , for our gods or mightier ! '', 
  * translator 's note : the rest of the story contains multiple combat scenes between kings and queens . 
  it is likely that these persons ( if anything more than a literary creation or myth-echo ) never entered in one-on-one combat . 
  the ancient reachmen shared the same sentiment about their leaders with the nords , namely that victory and defeat are the responsibility of the king/general . 
  the combat should be seen as an allegory . 
  the new day dawned , and h\u00e9stram entered the reach . 
  she swept through the reach , facing the kings in a sequence she saw fit . 
  the first king to meet her was renach of karth . 
  their armies fought from dawn till midday , and for every man slain from h\u00e9stram , she slew eight , and for every man slain from renach , he slew nine . 
  at midday , h\u00e9stram lost half a battalion , and renach all of his men . 
  `` let us meet face to face , queen of the south , for your men are deadbeat , and mine are dead . '', 
  said renach . 
  `` you are right to say that , king of karth . 
  if this is what you want , then let 's do this , '' answered h\u00e9stram . 
  they met each other at noon . 
  renach wore one sword in his hand , and one shield in the other , and h\u00e9stram had weapons to match .
