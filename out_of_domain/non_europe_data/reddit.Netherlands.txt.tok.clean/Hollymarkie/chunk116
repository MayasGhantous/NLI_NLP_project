  renach wore plate mail of solid gold , and h\u00e9stram wore armour to match , only her gold was white in colour . 
  they fought from noon till dusk . 
  in this time they only struck true , but had a defence to match . 
  none of them shed blood from the other . 
  when the sun was about to set , renach let his guard drop , and h\u00e9stram jumped on his shield , cutting into renach 's face . 
  her sword scraped of renach 's skin [ so that no one might recognise his life time ] . 
  blood spurted from his face , soaking his armour and that of h\u00e9stram . 
  `` that was quick thinking , woman , '' said renach . 
  h\u00e9stram replied : `` resend your old gods and worship kai , so that he might have you show age again . '', 
  he kneeled before her , and this is how karth fell to the empire . 
  the next king she met was mashuig of dr\u00e1chst\u00e1ir . 
  their armies fought from dawn till midday , and for every man slain from h\u00e9stram , she slew eight , and for every men slain from mashuig , he slew nine . 
  at midday , h\u00e9stram lost half a battalion , and mashuig all of his men . 
  `` let us settle this one on one , queen of the south , for your men are deadbeat , and mine are dead , '' said mashuig . 
  `` you are right to say that , king of dr\u00e1chst\u00e1ir . 
  if this is what you want , then let 's do this , '' answered h\u00e9stram . 
  they met each other at noon . 
  mashuig wore a bow the size of a grow man , and a quiver with enough arrows to cover the reach . 
  h\u00e9stram wore the same armour and arms as earlier , but the gold had regained its white colour . 
  they fought from noon till dusk . 
  every shot of mashuig was on point , but h\u00e9stram had a defence to match , and drew closer to mashuig . 
  neither drew blood from the other . 
  when the sun was about to set , h\u00e9stram threw her shield into the ground in front of mashuig , startling him . 
  she jumped forward , and poked out his eyes [ so that he might never recognise the needy ] . 
  blood spurted out of his empty sockets , soaking his armour and that of h\u00e9stram . 
  `` that was a swift move , woman , '' said mashuig . 
  h\u00e9stram replied : `` resend your old gods and worship shtaerr , that he might heal your eyes . '', 
  he kneeled before her , and this is how dr\u00e1chst\u00e1ir fell to the empire . 
  the next king she met was c\u00eder of the leap . 
  their armies fought from dawn till midday , and for every man slain from h\u00e9stram , she slew eight , and from every man slain from c\u00eder , he slew nine . 
  at midday , h\u00e9stram lost half a battalion , and c\u00eder all of his men . 
  `` let us settle this in combat , queen of the south , for your men are deadbeat , and mine are dead , '' said c\u00eder . 
  `` you are right to say that , king of the leap . 
  if this is what you want , then let 's do this , '' answered h\u00e9stram . 
  they met each other at noon . 
  c\u00eder wore chainmail , and a lance of solid iron four times his size . 
  h\u00e9stram wore the same armour and arms as earlier , but the gold had regained its white colour . 
  they fought from noon till dusk . 
  every jab and thrust of c\u00eder was on point , but h\u00e9stram had a defence to match . 
  every thrust took a chip of c\u00eder 's spear . 
  neither drew blood from the other . 
  when the sun was about to set , c\u00eder 's spear had been chipped of to a stump . 
  h\u00e9stram knocked it away with her shield , and cut off his thrust-arm [ so that he might never decide between life and death again ] . 
  blood spurted out of the shoulder-stump , soaking his armour and that of h\u00e9stram . 
  `` that was a deciding blow , woman , '' said c\u00eder . 
  h\u00e9stram replied : `` resend your old gods and worship \u00darci , that he might heal your arm . '', 
  he kneeled before her , and that is how the leap fell to the empire . 
  the next king she met was fernhete of sian h\u00e1irgramen . 
  their armies fought from dawn till midday , and for every man slain from h\u00e9stram , she slew eight , and from every man slain from fernhete , he slew nine . 
  at midday , h\u00e9stram lost half a battalion , and fernhete all of his men . 
  `` let us settle this by ourselves , queen of the south , for your men are deadbeat , and mine are dead , '' said fernhete . 
  `` you are right to say that , king of sian h\u00e1irgramen . 
  if this is what you want , then let 's do this , '' answered h\u00e9stram . 
  they met each other at noon . 
  fernhete wore a gold and blue robe , laid with radiant gems . 
  in every hand burned fire and lightning , and his eyes shot frost . 
  h\u00e9stram wore the same armour and arms as earlier , but the gold had regained its white colour . 
  they fought from noon till dusk . 
  every spell from fernhete was true to hit , but h\u00e9stram had a defence to match . 
  neither drew blood from the other . 
  when the sun was about to set , fernhete lost his magicka , and his spells became less potent . 
  h\u00e9stram rushed forwards and pierced his skull with her sword [ so that his mind might never work the same again ] . 
  blood spurted out of the head wound , soaking his armour and that of h\u00e9stram . 
  `` that was a wise move , woman , '' said fernhete . 
  h\u00e9stram replied : `` resend your old gods and worship julach , so that he might heal your head . '', 
  he kneeled before her , and that is how sian h\u00e1irgramen fell to the empire . 
  the next king she met was huithar of karthwasten . 
  their armies fought from dawn till midday , and for every man slain from h\u00e9stram , she slew eight , and from every man slain from huithar , he slew nine . 
  at midday , h\u00e9stram lost half a battalion , and huithar all of his men . 
  `` let us settle this as kings , queen of the south , for your men are deadbeat , and mine are dead , '' said huithar . 
  `` you are right to say that , king of karthwasten . 
  if this is what you want , then let 's do this , '' answered h\u00e9stram . 
  they met each other at noon . 
  huithar wore a iron breastplate , and in each hand a sword made of bone . 
  h\u00e9stram wore the same armour and arms as earlier , but the gold had regained its white colour . 
  they fought from noon till dusk . 
  every sword-feat of huithar was sure to hit , but h\u00e9stram had a defence to match . 
  neither drew blood from the other . 
  when the sun was about to set , huithar became exhausted , and could barely lift his arms . 
  h\u00e9stram disarmed him with her shield , and cut of his hands with her sword [ so that he might never protect craftsmen again ] . 
  blood spurted from his wrists , soaking his armour , and that of h\u00e9stram . 
  `` that was a safe move , woman , '' said huithar . 
  h\u00e9stram replied : `` resend your old gods and worship zened , so that he might heal your hand . '', 
  he kneeled before her , and that was how karthwasten fell to the empire . 
  the next king she met was fedelm of r\u00e9chthabd . 
  their armies fought from dawn till midday , and for every man slain from h\u00e9stram , she slew eight , and for every man slain from fedelm , she slew nine . 
  at midday , h\u00e9stram lost half a battalion , and fedelm all of her men . 
  `` let us settle this as proud women should , queen of the south , for your men are deadbeat , and mine dead , '' said fedelm . 
  `` you are right to say that , queen of r\u00e9chthabd . 
  if this is what you want , then let 's do this , '' answered h\u00e9stram . 
  they met each other at noon . 
  fedelm wore a armour of glass , which reflected the sky , and on her back were enough javelins to have five grown men collapse from sorrow . 
  h\u00e9stram wore the same armour and arms as earlier , but the gold had regained its white colour . 
  they fought from noon till dusk . 
  every javelin was sure to hit , but h\u00e9stram had a defence to match . 
  neither drew blood from the other . 
  when the sun was about to set , fedelm ran out of javelins . 
  h\u00e9stram had drawn closer and cut of fedelm 's feet [ so that she might lose her connection to the woods ] . 
  blood spurted from her legs , soaking her armour and that of h\u00e9stram . 
  `` that was a vengeful action , woman , '' said fedelm .
