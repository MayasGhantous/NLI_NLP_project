  h\u00e9stram replied : `` resend your old gods and worship cner\u00e9c , so that she might heal your feet . '', 
  she kneeled before her , and that was how r\u00e9chthabd fell to the empire . 
  the next king she met was m\u00e1ithramail of n\u00e9mach . 
  their armies fought from dawn till midday , and for every man slain from h\u00e9stram , she slew eight , and for every man slain from m\u00e1ithramail , she slew nine . 
  at midday , h\u00e9stram lost half a battalion , and m\u00e1ithramail all of her men . 
  `` let us settle this between us , queen of the south , for your men are deadbeat , and mine are dead , '' said m\u00e1ithramail . 
  `` you are right to say that , queen of n\u00e9mach . 
  if this is what you want , then let 's do this , '' answered h\u00e9stram . 
  they met each other at noon . 
  m\u00e1ithramail wore a motherly robe , and held a claymore in her hands the size of a grown man , and never bloodied . 
  h\u00e9stram wore the same armour or arms as earlier , but the gold had regained its white colour . 
  they fought from noon till dusk . 
  every swing of m\u00e1ithramail kept her enemy at bay , but h\u00e9stram had a defence to match . 
  when the sun was about to set , m\u00e1ithramail misjudged h\u00e9stram 's shield arm , and h\u00e9stram knocked her claymore away . 
  h\u00e9stram swung , and cut off her breasts [ so that she might never suckle a baby again ] . 
  blood spurted from her chest , soaking her armour , and that of h\u00e9stram . 
  `` that was a correcting slash , woman . '', 
  h\u00e9stram replied : `` resend your old gods and worship marr , so that she might heal your breast . '', 
  she kneeled before her , and that was how n\u00e9mach fell to the empire . 
  the next king she met was balgadb of badb . 
  their armies fought from dawn till midday , and for every man slain from h\u00e9stram , she slew eight , and from every man slain from balgadb , she slew nine . 
  at midday , h\u00e9stram lost half a battalion , and balgadb all of her men . 
  `` let us settle this with skill , queen of the south , for your men are deadbeat , and mine are dead , '' said balgadb . 
  `` you are right to say that , queen of badb . 
  if this is what you want , then let 's do this , '' answered h\u00e9stram . 
  they met each other at noon . 
  balgadb wore a leather suit , which she wore as a skin , so that it did not impair her movement . 
  in each hand she held a dagger , which was poisoned . 
  h\u00e9stram wore the same armour and arms as earlier , but the gold had regained its white colour . 
  they fought from noon till dusk . 
  balgadb dodged h\u00e9stram 's every move , and struck at every angle , but h\u00e9stram had a defence to match . 
  when the sun was about to set , balgadb thought she was sure to hit . 
  h\u00e9stram duck to the ground , and thrusted her sword up balgadb nether regions [ so that she might never over the friendship of her thighs again ] . 
  blood spurted from her belly soaking her armour and that of h\u00e9stram . 
  `` that was a passionate thrust , woman . '', 
  said balgadb . 
  h\u00e9stram replied : `` resend your old gods and worship debhellach , so that she might heal your nether regions . '', 
  she kneeled before her , and that was how badb fell to the empire . 
  the next king she met was l\u00e9ech of sian sp\u00edr flach . 
  their armies fought from dawn till midday , and for every man slain from h\u00e9stram , she slew eight , and for every man slain from l\u00e9ech , he slew nine . 
  at midday , h\u00e9stram lost half a battalion , and l\u00e9ech all of his men . 
  `` let us settle this in blood , queen of the south , for your men are deadbeat , and mine are dead , '' said l\u00e9ech . 
  `` you are right to say that , king of sian sp\u00edr flach . 
  if this is what you want , then let 's do this , '' answered h\u00e9stram . 
  they met each other at noon . 
  l\u00e9ech wore nothing at all , standing only in flesh before the queen . 
  his hands were empty . 
  h\u00e9stram wore the same armour and arms as earlier , but the gold had regained its white colour . 
  they fought from noon till dusk . 
  every hit of h\u00e9stram struck l\u00e9ech , but he kept standing . 
  every hit of l\u00e9ech was sure to hit , but h\u00e9stram had a defence to match . 
  only l\u00e9ech was bloodied . 
  when the sun was about to set , l\u00e9ech could not take much more . 
  h\u00e9stram plunged her sword in his heart [ which was n't really there ] and cleaved him in half . 
  blood spurted from his entire body , soaking his skin and that of h\u00e9stram , for it seeped into her armour . 
  `` that was a killing blow , '' said l\u00e9ech . 
  h\u00e9stram replied : `` resend your old gods and worship none of my , so that they might not smite you any more . '', 
  he kneeled before her before he died , and that was how sian sp\u00edr flach fell to the empire . 
  only the remainder of the reach remained now , to which h\u00e9stram travelled . 
  h\u00e9stram travelled to faolan in the remainder of the reach . 
  there she met faolan , who had already gathered his men on the hills . 
  every time her army tried to get near , they were pelted with rocks and arrows . 
  h\u00e9stram lost a battalion in this way . 
  they tried circling around faolan 's position , but found the mountains to be otherwise unscalable . 
  h\u00e9stram said : `` bring me orc\u00ed , for he might know a way to get us past this position . '', 
  orc\u00ed was called for and brought before her . 
  he spoke : `` i am sorry to disappoint you , queen , but there is but one passage towards their position , and faolan holds it . '', 
  h\u00e9stram replied : `` how can we proceed ? 
  what might be a possible way to pass his ranks , and submit the remainder of the reach , which are almost mine ? '', 
  orc\u00ed replied : `` let me ride to them . 
  eventhough i do not have a beard like they do , they will still recognise me as one of them . 
  i will ride in and find a way to disrupt their armies . 
  they will not recognise me anymore , as it has been nine years already . '', 
  this was done . 
  orc\u00ed rode towards the armies of faolan . 
  recognising him as a reachman , the ranks parted , to let orc\u00ed through to faolan . 
  hoping that faolan was preparing himself in private , he rode towards the fort . 
  one man that saw all this was andoe , who was scouting the enemy ranks , and the fort , and the cliffs surrounding them , for he was the fastest man in the reach . 
  andoe rushed into faolan 's fort , and found faolan in his quarters , putting on his armour and arms . 
  andoe said : `` excuse me , king faolan , but i have important news . 
  the army is still holding h\u00e9stram at bay , but they have just now opened their ranks to let a snake pass . '', 
  faolan followed andoe , to meet orc\u00ed in front of the fort . 
  orc\u00ed saw faolan , and spurred his horse to run back to h\u00e9stram 's army . 
  faolan threw a stone after him , shattering the bones in orc\u00eds left leg , forcing him to remain on his horse , for he could walk no longer . 
  while quick in scaring away the snake , andoe and faolan were too late , for he had already poisoned the archers . 
  with the archers gone , h\u00e9stram advanced , climbing the rocks that would lead to faolan . 
  h\u00edrti cried out : `` this was a dirty trick . 
  i will not stand here waiting for the enemy to climb up . '', 
  he stormed down , and started a onslaught in the enemy ranks . 
  some even said that he routed them with nothing more than song and voice . 
  h\u00edrti slew nine hundred men , before h\u00e9stram took his head . 
  the armies of faolan and h\u00e9stram fought from dawn till dusk . 
  when the sun had set , h\u00e9stram and faolan both lost half their men , and both were fought to a standstill . 
  faolan said : `` i will not let my men die and sit idly in my fort . 
  tomorrow morning i will meet with you , queen of the south , so that we may settle this once and for all . '', 
  h\u00e9stram replied : `` there is wisdom in your words , king faolan of the remainder of the reach . 
  it is not fair to have lesser men die in what is a royal affair . 
  i will meet you tomorrow morning at yonder ford , so that everyone might memorise our battle . '', 
  it was decided . 
  faolan and h\u00e9stram went back to their camps , to spend the night in the company of their men .
