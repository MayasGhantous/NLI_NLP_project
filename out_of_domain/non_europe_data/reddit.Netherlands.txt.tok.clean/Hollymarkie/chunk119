  andoe spoke : `` greetings , priest . 
  i am andoe the messenger , and this is king faolan . '', 
  faolan interrupted them : `` i am no king anymore , andoe . 
  h\u00e9stram made sure of that . 
  priest , i am wounded , and in the hope that the waters of the karth might heal me . 
  my battle has been fought , but it is not yet over , and i plan on coming out victorious . '', 
  h\u00e9rnach replied : `` greetings then , messenger andoe and king faolan . 
  i am h\u00e9rnach , and the highest priest of this humble temple . 
  we still worship the old gods , even though our lord does not . 
  you are both welcome here , and we will see what we can do about the wounds . '', 
  h\u00e9rnach sat down at the waterside , examining faolan 's cuts and bruises and wounds . 
  he spoke : `` most of these are not fatal , king faolan . 
  when my healers have treated you , you will live the days that you still have . 
  your chest wound is another concern . 
  from what i see , it was given to you by a proud woman , one which is of royal statute , more so now . '', 
  faolan replied : `` that is correct . 
  these wounds were given to me by h\u00e9stram , who rules the reach now , for she has conquered them and calls them her own . 
  is there anything your healers can do for me ? '', 
  h\u00e9rnach replied : `` we can let you rest here for three months , and then you will live for how many days you still have left , or we can heal you for three nights , and you will be able to fight the armies of h\u00e9stram . 
  you will not live for long this way , and you will definitely not be able to best h\u00e9stram in single combat . '', 
  faolan replied : `` the latter then , for i can not wait three months . 
  if it takes my life , so be it . '', 
  `` andoe , my trusted messenger , go to the other kings , and see if any of them is willing to help me in my effort . 
  if they do not want to help me , see if any of their warriors or heroes or champions are able to help . 
  i will take the fight to the queen of the south once again , as long as i have men . '', 
  this is what andoe did . 
  he went to r\u00e9nach of karth and mashuig of dr\u00e1chst\u00e1ir and c\u00eder of the leap and fernhete of sian h\u00e1irgramen and huithar of karthwasten and fedelm of r\u00e9chthabd and m\u00e1ithramail of n\u00e9mach and balgadb of badb . 
  all replied that they would not help faolan , for the gods of h\u00e9stram had healed their injuries . 
  andoe did find warriors and heroes and champions [ most which were n't in the fighting previously ] willing . 
  then andoe went to the grave of l\u00e9ech , which was inconspicuous . 
  there he conjured the ghost of l\u00e9ech [ which some said was still walking around ] . 
  andoe said : `` king l\u00e9ech of sian sp\u00edr flach , i summon you to help us in our hour of need . 
  faolan requests help in his strive against h\u00e9stram , and the other kings do not want to help him . 
  i did find warriors and heroes and champions , but not enough to pose a real threat . '', 
  the ghost replied : `` i am afraid i can not help you directly . 
  i am dead , and my body is destroyed . 
  my ghost is still too young to help young warriors . 
  i can haunt my former men into helping faolan , for i do not agree with the gods of h\u00e9stram as well , even though i used to love them all . 
  go with my blessing , andoe , and tell your lord of the words spoken here . 
  i offer any help i can . '', 
  andoe heeded these words , and went back to faolan . 
  in these three days , faolan had recovered enough to bring the fight back to the armies . 
  he had been training in the sword-feats and the shield-feats and the javelin-feats again , but his strength and mind were n't the same . 
  he was still weak , and every battle would be a strain on his body . 
  andoe came into the temple , where faolan and h\u00e9rnach were . 
  he spoke : `` my king , i have found men that are willing to stand with you against h\u00e9stram . 
  i did not get the other kings to work , for the gods of h\u00e9stram have healed them of their wounds . 
  the only king that wanted to offer aid was l\u00e9ech , but he is dead . '', 
  faolan was grim , and spoke : `` well then , if none of them would help me , i will do it myself . 
  tell the men to prepare . 
  i am healed enough to fight armies , but not strong enough to fight the h\u00e9stram one on one . 
  tell them that we will fight differently . 
  we will strike pre-emptively , and without warning . 
  we will destroy h\u00e9stram one man at a time . 
  it is a coward 's move , and not a warrior 's , i know , but we have little choice . '', 
  this was what andoe did . 
  he told the men what faolan 's plan was , and all agreed that it was necessary . 
  in those days , faolan did not know how to move against h\u00e9stram with his new force . 
  they tried open combat at first . 
  in this manner , h\u00e9stram lost half a battalion , and faolan an entire battalion . 
  they tried ranged combat . 
  while h\u00e9stram lost an entire battalion , and faolan half a battalion in this manner , h\u00e9stram advanced , and routed faolan 's men . 
  they tried poisoning h\u00e9stram 's supplies , but faolan 's men were caught in time , and executed . 
  andoe came to faolan , and said : `` king faolan , the commanders are growing unruly . 
  every move they make is unsuccessful , and they are losing hope . 
  they want to beat h\u00e9stram , but they believe this to be impossible . '', 
  faolan replied : `` i do not know what we must do , andoe . 
  every move we make is either cut short or ineffective . 
  tell the men i will think about it . 
  tell them i will be spending the night alone on the hill there . 
  a thousand curses on the man that will disturb me . '', 
  andoe went to the camp to tell the men . 
  that night they slept quieter , yet not very . 
  faolan made way to the hill , and sat down . 
  even though he was tired from the battles past , he did not catch sleep . 
  before him he saw wolfs howling and owls sweeping down and bucks running and cats stalking . 
  none of this made sense to him at this time . 
  then , faolan saw a wolf leaping out of the trees , killing a stag in one blow . 
  the wolf , carrying the stag , made way towards faolan . 
  when the wolf was nearby , faolan saw that it actually was a man , wearing the skull of the stag over his head . 
  he wore nothing else except for a loincloth around his waist . 
  the man said : `` greetings , king faolan . 
  i know who you are , and what you do , yet i do not know why you are here , in my time . '', 
  faolan replied : `` greetings , stranger . 
  i want to offer you my kindness , but i promised a thousand curses on the man that disturbed me . 
  if you help me , i might lift those curses . '', 
  the man replied : `` i see . 
  i can not say i am pleased by this answer , but i will do what you ask of me anyway . 
  know one thing , though : by the end of the night , you will understand why you can not curse me . '', 
  firstly , i would like you to share this stag with me , and catch me another . 
  i will be waiting here , judging you . '', 
  the man dropped the stag , and ran of . 
  he threw a javelin [ that appeared in his hand ] into the dark . 
  a great bellowing came forth from the woods , and the stranger came back with another stag on his back . 
  he dropped the other stag on the hill , and build a fire . 
  that evening , faolan and the stranger shared the stag . 
  faolan said : `` i thank you for this meal , stranger . 
  i will lift some of these curses , but not all , for the night is not yet over and daw has n't broken yet . 
  tell me stranger , what is your name ? '', 
  the stranger replied : `` i can not tell you , king .
