  we could try killing him in single combat . 
  he is still wounded from your last encounter , and i doubt he will be able to best all our champions . 
  he is bound by our warrior custom to accept these challenges . '', 
  h\u00e9stram said : `` fine then . 
  search our camp for our best warriors and heroes and champions . 
  let them make their way to faolan 's camp , and take him on in single combat . '', 
  this what was done . 
  many warriors and heroes and champions made their way to faolan 's camp . 
  what they did n't know , was that faolan 's men were masters of the hunt . 
  they knew how to stalk their prey , and take down one that was twice their size and thrice their strength . 
  only one champion , l\u00fag , was able to reach faolan 's camp . 
  he was carrying armour of dwemer craft , with a longsword and a shield three times his own size . 
  he held eight heads in his hand , each wearing the head of a stag over their own . 
  when faolan saw him , he made way to the ford that led to his camp . 
  there he met l\u00fag . 
  faolan spoke : `` who are you , what are you doing here , and why are you carrying the heads of my men . 
  normally i would have offered you peace and hospitality , but it seems you will only bring war and enmity . '', 
  l\u00fag replied : `` i was sent by the queen of the south to have single combat with faolan , who says he rules the reach . 
  the only ones i met were those cowardly enough to hide their faces , and you are no exception . 
  tell me your name , and the way to your master . '', 
  faolan replied : `` i am king faolan , and i am the eagle of your death . 
  i do not hide my face , but wear this to better know my pray . 
  you are all proud , but in the end are all the hunted , and not the hunter . 
  if you want single combat , go ahead . 
  you will find this here . '', 
  this is what was done . 
  he took up his shield and sword , and stood on his side of the ford . 
  faolan was now using two swords , so to better move through the forest . 
  faolan spoke : `` i do not want to fight you , forced like this . 
  i am , however , bound by honour to comply . 
  you are the challenger , so you may move first . '', 
  when he thought he was sure to hit , faolan had moved away . 
  from sunrise to midday , faolan had done nothing more than dodging , and l\u00fag grew tired . 
  faolan lashed out , cutting both l\u00fag 's calves . 
  faolan spoke : `` even though i am still wounded by h\u00e9stram , i seem to have no problem beating you , l\u00fag . 
  if h\u00e9stram wants to beat me , she needs better men . '', 
  faolan cut off l\u00fag 's head , and with all his strength he threw it towards h\u00e9stram 's camp . 
  l\u00fag 's head rolled into h\u00e9stram 's tent , and it repeated the words faolan spoke . 
  h\u00e9stram stood up , and said : `` it seems the eagle is now taunting me . 
  orc\u00ed , get your gear . 
  we will help you on your horse , given you will beat faolan . '', 
  orc\u00ed was helped on his horse , and rode out to meet faolan . 
  he meandered through the forests , and met faolan at a ford near his camp . 
  there , faolan was bathing , washing of the blood of his battle with l\u00fag . 
  faolan said : `` i heard your hiss , snake , and i see you eying me . 
  even though you are as treacherous as your name implies , i would not want you to attack me in the back . 
  a thousand curses upon you by the old gods , which you have resented , if you tried . 
  it is not a warrior 's way . '', 
  orc\u00ed said : `` we have n't met in years , and the first thing you speak is an accusation . 
  even though you saw it fit to exile me , i will still not drive my poison through your back , because , while i do n't have a beard , i am still a reachman . 
  get yourself geared up , red eagle , and we shall do battle at this ford , so that generations to come might recall this fight . '', 
  it was done as said . 
  faolan outfitted himself in a simple loincloth , wearing the head of a stag on his own . 
  orc\u00ed wore a set of dinted iron armour , which was rusted around the bolts . 
  faolan wore his two bone swords . 
  orc\u00ed wore a giant wooden sword , which cracks were filled with green mold and moss . 
  in his other hand was an old , rusted iron shield , which was as big as himself . 
  orc\u00ed spoke : `` let us fight from horse back , faolan . 
  i am crippled by your doing , and can not fight on foot . 
  it would not be a fair fight that way . '', 
  i do not like you , orc\u00ed , but i respect your request . 
  i will comply . '', 
  faolan send andoe to get him a horse . 
  andoe returned with a beautiful black horse , which had been in the stables ever since faolan met hirseinn . 
  he climbed his horse , and took position on his side of the ford . 
  orc\u00ed rode on an old white horse , which was sickly . 
  orc\u00ed said : `` faolan , let 's end this here . 
  h\u00e9stram owns the reach now , and i will further proof this . '', 
  faolan replied : `` try . '', 
  they circled each other , and threw javelins at each other . 
  none hit , for they were both too quick-moving . 
  they continued this from sunrise to sunset . 
  when the sun had set , both sides of the ford were covered in javelins sticking sky-wards . 
  neither had shed blood that day . 
  they met each other at the ford , deciding to continue the fight tomorrow . 
  they set up camps on the watersides . 
  faolan knew that orc\u00ed was a snake , known to backstabbing and poison . 
  orc\u00ed knew that faolan was an eagle , known to hunting and quick-striking . 
  neither slept well that night . 
  when the next day began , orc\u00ed spoke : `` hail , ` comrade ' . 
  let us decide this today , for yesterday did n't bear fruit . '', 
  faolan replied : `` try again . '', 
  they circled each other as yesterday , exchanging arrows with each other . 
  some arrows were true to their target , but most missed . 
  they continued this from sunrise to sunset . 
  when the sun had set , both were covered in arrow-shafts , and the sides of the ford were covered in arrow-shafts sticking sky-wards . 
  blood had been shed , but not enough . 
  they met each other at the ford , deciding to continue the fight tomorrow . 
  they set up camps on the watersides . 
  their wounds were treated by their healers , and for every spell and enchantment faolan got , he made sure orc\u00ed would get the same , for he did not want to win based on the aptitude of his healers . 
  faolan knew that orc\u00ed was a snake , known to backstabbing and poison . 
  orc\u00ed knew that faolan was an eagle , known to hunting and quick-striking . 
  neither slept well that night . 
  when the next day began , orc\u00ed spoke : `` hail , ` friend ' . 
  let us decide this today , for yesterday was not deciding . '', 
  faolan replied : `` try again . '', 
  they took up their spears , and charged each other through the ford . 
  they jabbed and thrusted , and they switched sides of the ford like water in a whirlpool . 
  they jabbed and thrusted and cut . 
  they continued this from sunrise to sunset .
