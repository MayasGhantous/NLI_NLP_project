  andoe spoke : `` snake , state your business in these lands of which you are no part of anymore . '', 
  orc\u00ed replied : `` greetings andoe . 
  i came here to challenge faolan , as your new queen commands of me . '', 
  andoe spoke : `` we do not serve the queen of the south , but only king faolan . 
  if you wish to do combat with him , you are welcome to . 
  meet him at the nearest ford , so that this battle might be remembered . 
  he will be waiting for you . '', 
  orc\u00ed rode towards the ford , and andoe returned to faolan 's camp . 
  when orc\u00ed came at the ford , he found faolan already there . 
  he was sitting on the far shore , and stood up as soon as he saw orc\u00ed . 
  he stood upright , without any of the rage of the previous day . 
  he spoke : `` again we meet orc\u00ed . 
  this is the third time in a short while that we shall do battle . 
  the first time you fled , the second you won , and the third you shall loose . 
  it is mere fate . '', 
  orc\u00ed spoke : `` so say you . 
  i am better from horseback than you , it seems . 
  and it would be unlike a warrior to fight me on foot , since i can not stand like a normal man after you have injured me twice . '', 
  faolan remained silent , and picked up a rock . 
  he flung it with huge force towards orc\u00ed 's horse , breaking the animals neck . 
  the horse collapsed , and orc\u00ed fell to the ground , unable to stand up . 
  he spoke : `` many times have you accused me of bad conduct , king faolan , but it seems you are now the one to act unworthy . 
  i am unable to fight like this . 
  is this how you want to defeat me ? 
  you and your men can do better . '', 
  faolan drew his sword , saying : `` everything for the reach . '', 
  faolan cut of orc\u00ed 's head with a quick slice . 
  he called andoe . 
  andoe , hearing him from the camp , came running with great speed . 
  he saw the headless bodies of orc\u00ed and the horse on the ground . 
  he spoke : `` what happened faolan ? 
  you do not call me for a horse , nor did you have one here . '', 
  faolan spoke : `` i did not need one , as his horse fell before the battle begun . 
  i killed orc\u00ed to forever be done with him . 
  here is his head . 
  i want you to bring it to h\u00e9stram 's camp in the middle of the night and leave it there , so that she might learn of his faith . '', 
  andoe was silent and turned pale . 
  he wanted to comment on the dishonour this fight brought to the reach [ as it was remembered by the water ] , but he did not dare to object his lord , for fear of his new and otherworldly strength and combat-feats . 
  andoe waited until night fell , and then sprinted to the camp of h\u00e9stram . 
  he came with such speed that no man in the camp could see him dash by , only feeling a gust of wind . 
  due to the darkness , no one saw the head until the next morning . 
  * 1 : translator 's note : the word in the text is '' \u00e9n '' , which simply refers to a winged creature . 
  the passage is an obvious reference to akatosh or kai , its reach equivalent . 
  the translation is left ambiguous not due to the exact word , but more due to the language . 
  some context is required for the modern reader . 
  '' \u00c9n '' is a middle-reachian word . 
  middle-reachian developed from old reachian in the early second era . 
  the recession of which this passage comes , as included in the `` book of past times '' ( imperial library of winterhold , ms h 2.18 ( cat . 
  1339 ) , dated to c. 1e 1250-1350 ) is dated , due to textual analysis and the condition of the parchment , to the thirteenth or fourteenth century of the first era when old reachian was still extant . 
  the old reachian word would be `` fent '' . 
  the word does not seem to be scribbled over or later included , even though the necessary linguistic developments would not happen in at least another one or two thousand years . 
  only theories allude to how this word found its way into the manuscript . 
  h\u00e9stram called for tul\u00edr , who made way to her camp . 
  when he came in , he was greeted by the severed head of orc\u00ed on the table . 
  h\u00e9stram was seated on her provisional throne . 
  she said : `` it seems one of our problems is solved , but not all . 
  we are still left with faolan and his men . 
  come , let us walk through the camp and discuss this matter . '', 
  they left the tent and walked through the camp . 
  they inspected the troops , who were growing tired of the long campaign , and were afraid of the fierceness of faolan . 
  the reachian allies were becoming increasingly stubborn and unruly , and some doubted h\u00e9stram 's own might . 
  h\u00e9stram spoke : `` do you see the fear in their eyes , and the weakness in their scared flesh ? 
  this is what faolan is doing to us right now . 
  i am concerned myself , indeed . 
  he proves to be more than simply a nuisance , and we need to deal with him at the first possibility . 
  and we can only do that if we know who and what he is . '', 
  tul\u00edr spoke : `` the men of the reach have discussed this greatly , and it seems what orc\u00ed told earlier was correct . 
  they have stories of these br\u00e1irc\u00f3rs , and of their strengths . 
  i am afraid i know of no way to defeat them , other than the help of the gods . 
  we can only hope that his men loose fate in him . '', 
  h\u00e9stram replied : `` i do no see them do that . 
  he is giving them victory , and they have no cause for sorrow at this moment . '', 
  tul\u00edr spoke : `` that is not true , h\u00e9stram . 
  the reachmen are a proud people , who value the warrior code . 
  faolan had broken this with his warp-spasm , and his unfair treatment of orc\u00ed . 
  he is , to his men , a monster . 
  and i share their perception of him . 
  he is a spurn of evil , and is willing to even sacrifice his men without a second thought if he can fight you out , queen of the south . 
  not because of your conquest anymore , but because of your personal feud . 
  he is a traitor to his own cause , and the lowest of lowest in the reach . '', 
  tul\u00edr 's head was cracked open by a rock , thrown by faolan , who was watching and listening to the camp from a near hilltop . 
  h\u00e9stram looked at him , and andoe , who stood next to the king , his back to the camp and his head low . 
  h\u00e9stram ordered the soldiers to give the body of tul\u00edr a worthy burial , and that is how the priest ended . 
  she went back to the camp , to gather her armour and arms , for she was about to meet faolan for the final time . 
  by the next dawn she set out to the ford where she first met the eagle . 
  she knew that faolan would be there , for kai told her . 
  when she arrived , she saw faolan hunting some deer . 
  before his javelin hit , h\u00e9stram shot the deer with her magicka-feat . 
  faolan stood upright and looked at her . 
  h\u00e9stram spoke : `` greetings king faolan . 
  i see you are hunting here . 
  under normal circumstances i would hunt you a deer , and share another . 
  i would catch you a salmon , and shared another . 
  i would give you to drink of the purest waters . 
  yet these are n't normal circumstances . 
  i want you to know that i do not take kindly to the assassination ( for this is what they were ) of my generals and lieutenants . 
  i am here to make sure such a thing does not happen anymore . '', 
  faolan spoke : `` hail , ` queen ' . 
  even if you would hunt and catch fish for me , i would not accept them ( for it was an insult to deny these gifts ) . 
  i do not negotiate with invaders and false pretenders to my and my brothers ' position .
