  this area will not know a king in a long time , for this is the knowledge julach and kai gave me . 
  prepare my body in the ways and magics of our ancestors . 
  in death , i will not be able to defend the reach , but i will protect the last ember of our freedom , so that it might be lid in the future by those that know our ways . '', 
  he chanted the following verse :, 
  do not weep , do not lament, 
  of how i came to be dead . 
  the rape i could not prevent, 
  for now my fate i have met, 
  faolan 's ghost departed then . 
  his body was balmed and prepared as fits a king , and blessed and enchanted as fits a warrior . 
  the greatest of his kin and kith carried his body into his tower , led by andoe , who aided his king at every command . 
  they put faolan 's body on his thrown , his hand on his sword , which was also named as such . 
  he was to be the guardian of his tower , and was to defeat any challenger to his throne . 
  they sealed the door , and left the dead king then . 
  this is how faolan was buried , and how the reach fell to h\u00e9stram . 
  this was the end of the rape of the reach . 
  ok , this is a work in progress , and any discussion is welcome and encouraged . 
  each province holds its own name , and these names did n't simply fall out of the sky . 
  in this post , and in the comments down below , i would like to try to find the true etymology of these names ( since searching `` morrowind '' on til gives way too many hits ) . 
  let 's start of easy . 
  ** high rock **, 
  high rock is easy . 
  the name is a reference to the rugged and mountainous landscape . 
  this is further attested by the name of the province in the german and french translations , namely hochfels ( high rock ) and hauteroche ( high rock ) . 
  possibly no further etymology . 
  ** black marsh **, 
  pretty straightforward . 
  black marsh is a densely forested swamp , where light would scarcely hit the ground . 
  argonia is a logical reference to argonians . 
  the german and french translations are swarzmarsch ( black marsh ) and marais noir ( black marsh ) . 
  edit : according to the pge , first edition :, 
   `` elves call it argonia , after some ancient battlefield where many of their ancestors fell . 
  thus , the native inhabitants of the swamplands , a collection of beastly tribes of `` lizard-men , '' have become , in common parlance , the argonians '', 
  the origin of the elven name is still unknown . 
  skyrim needs a bit more fantasy to place . 
  my own theory is that it is a simple reference to the northern position of the province , and thus simply means `` rim of the sky '' . 
  this is further strengthened by the german and french names of the place , himmelsrand ( heaven 's rim/edge ) and bordeciel ( heaven edge/border/fringe ) . 
  edit : this has obvious references to kyne , and the throat of the world . 
  the nords see kyne as the deity that breathed them live . 
  this is one of the only places we actually have a etymology from . 
  the name is a partial translation of the dwemer name volenfell , meaning `` city of the hammer '' ( compare vvardenfell `` strong-shield city '' and the name volendrug , which is the hammer after which the province was named ) . 
  the name comes from the rourken clan , who did not want to join the first council of resdayn . 
  their leader threw his hammer , and promised to settle where it landed . 
  it did so in the deserts of the alik ` r. 
  while - fell is n't translated , it does give a nice play on words . 
  the name is n't translated in german ( note : hammer is the same word in german , and fell would not translate well due to german grammar ( causing a inconveniently long word ) , but sounds similar to `` fallen '' , which means to `` fall '' ) , but is translated in french to lenclume . 
  ~ ~ clume means anvil , but i could not place len ( the closest i got to was a corruption from `` lent '' , which means slow , but that seems to be a strange translation ) . ~ ~ this seems to go against the popular founding myth of the province , or it could simply already be used by the translators before the myth was included in any source . 
  edit : the french name should be read as `` l'enclume '' , meaning `` the anvil '' . 
  might be a reference to where the hammer falls ? 
  ** valenwood **, 
  of course , wood here refers to the forests . 
  valen seems to be denoting something along the lines of `` vallied '' , or `` of the valley '' . 
  this seems to be further strengthened by the german and french translation valenwald ( valley-woods ) and val-bois\u00e9 ( wooded valley ) . 
  not knowing about the geological situation of valenwood , i do n't know if valen really refers to valleys . 
  also one of the only places where we have a etymology from . 
  orsinium is `` the city of/for pariah 's '' . 
  this comes from the ehlnofex orsi - ( cognate : orsimer ) , meaning pariah . 
  - ium is a common suffix to denote possession , or belonging , in most real-life languages stemming from latin . 
  the name is not translated in other languages . 
  ** summerset isles / alinor **, 
  the name summerset is harder to place . 
  my first hunge was that it was a reference to the english place somerset , which is come from middle-english sumort\u016bns\u01e3te , meaning something along the lines of `` people living at sumerton '' or `` people depending on sumerton '' , sumerton being a place nearby , which ' name comes from old english , meaning `` summer-place '' . 
  while the reference might not hold true , the name is most likely a reference to the season . 
  since seasonal migration of the altmer seems unlikely to me , it might still be a reference to the tropical weather of the area , or it is the place people would notice the coming of summer the soonest . 
  the name is not translated into german ( probably because the english name sounds german enough ) , but in french it is ironically called archipel de l'automne ( archipelago of autumn ) . 
  edit : seeing the french translation , it might be a reference to the end of summer . 
  this might be symbolic for the aldmer 's fall from divinity , and the sundering of aldmeris . 
  alinor is supposedly named after a king or person , to which michael kirkbride had to say the following :, 
   it 's the oldest name of the set . 
  it was n't a person in the sense you mean . 
  ( set means summerset ), 
  again , this name is not translated in other languages . 
  according to the khajiit , the name is a pun , pronounced the same as elsewhere . 
  they say it comes from a khajiiti proverb , roughly translated to `` perfect society is always elsewhere '' , which sprung up when the kingdoms were first united . 
  the word seems to be ta'agra ` iss , so this might be a folk etymology , or just the khajiit messing with the rest of tamriel . 
  the name is not translated in other languages , possibly due to the fact that the pun would not carry over well . 
  ** morrowind **, 
  this province has gone by many names in the past . 
  firstly , it was named dwemereth ( which seems to be just centred on vvardenfell at the time ) . 
  the name simply means `` of the dwemer '' . 
  when the first chimer settlers landed , they named their land after their prophet veloth . 
  when the two people were united in the first council , the land was renamed resdayn , of which i could n't find an etymology . 
  when the first council collapsed , and the battle of red mountain took place , red mountain erupted , and many people fled from vvardenfell onto the mainland ( although the sea of ghosts might be a product of this disaster ) . 
  from this moment , the name morrowind was coined , but only popularised later . 
  morrow is an archaic english word for morning , or the following day ( as in tomorrow ) . 
  wind is clear . 
  although the name is probably older than the west-is-past and east-is-future idea , it does seem to go this way . 
  the name is not translated in other languages . 
  edit : the following etymology popped up some time ago , by hq, 
   the name is a nordic buggering of the official dunmeris mora vvynth : literally `` pure-as-lotus forest '' but carrying a connotation of `` promised land '' or `` utopia '' . 
  it was instituted by order of a bull issued by archcanon sothlur in the third year of the tribunal temple 's reign , to mark the epoch of their ascendancy . 
  the accuracy is debatable , but it sounds more likely than my own theory . 
  popular believe holds that the name comes from the full name of emperor reman i , reman cyrodiil . 
  under his rule , nibenay and colovia were united firmly for the first time ( the alessians had problems with the colovian estates , and it is doubtful if they would ever be paired with nibenay ) . 
  the name might be older , though . 
  in adabal-a ( taking place in the young years of alessia , when there was not any idea of cyrodiil as we know it ) , the following is said :, 
   perrif 's original tribe is unknown , but she grew up in sard , anon sardarvar leed , where the ayleids herded in men from across all the niben : kothri , nede , al-gemha , men-of - ` kreath ( though these were later known to be imported from the north ) , keptu , men-of-ge ( who were eventually destroyed when the flower king nilichi made great sacrifice to an insect god named [ lost ] ) , al-hared , men-of-ket , others ; ** but this was cyrod , the heart of the imperatum saliache ** , where men knew no freedom , even to keep family , or choice of name except in secret , and so to their alien masters all of these designations were irrelevant . 
  the name ` cyrod ' seems to be much older than reman cyrodiil , and possibly of ayleid origin . 
  the text does n't further clarify what or where cyrod is exactly . 
  personally , i think the heartlands are a good guess , being in the central position of the province , and the place of the imperial city , previously the temple of the ancestors , and the white-gold tower .
