  since i 'm planning to do that as an extension of these posts , i wo n't go into too much detail here . 
  according to the adabal-a , morihaus and pelinal briefly discussed pelinal 's return in one form or the other , and the return of umaril how dangerous that can be . 
  this ends the seventh volume of the song of pelinal : on his battle with umaril and his dismemberment, 
  the final volume of the song is by far the shortest , and deals with pelinal speaking at the deathbed of alessia . 
  it does hold some interesting things , though . 
  just like the seventh volume , the eighth has its own introduction . 
   [ editor 's note : this is the oldest and most fragmentary of all the extant pelinal texts . 
  it is , however , likely closest to the original spoken or sung form of the song , and therefore has great value despite its brevity . 
  strangely , it appears that pelinal is present at alessia 's deathbed , although he was killed by umaril earlier in the saga ( years before alessia 's death ) . 
  some scholars believe that this fragment is not actually a part of the song of pelinal , but most accept its authenticity although there is still much debate as to its significance . ], 
  since the seventh volume was already dated to mid sixth century 1e , which is about 300 years after the events , this is a really old version of the song , and might even be recorded within one lifetime of the events . 
  it is interesting that , if the text is truly authentic , the tone of the epic used to be very different . 
  pelinal does not seem to be the one-minded wrecking ball , but more of a divine advisor to alessia . 
  it should be noted that all events between his dismemberment and alessia 's death are n't described , and there should be more than enough time there for him to have a change of heart . 
  while the editor seemed to be surprised at pelinal 's presence , it should be noted that he appeared to be able to converse with morihaus after his dismemberment in the seventh volume , as well as in the adabal-a . 
  he also later appeared in ghost form to the champion of cyrodiil in the knights of the nine expansion , so it is possible that , if he did die , he appears in that form here . 
  like i already stated , the tone of this fragment is completely different from the first seven volumes , which is probably the cause of the debate regarding its authenticity , as well as the fact that the text is so fragmented that it is hard to place it within the rest of the tale . 
  while there is no indication of who is exactly talking in this fragment , the introduction leads me to believe that pelinal is the one speaking . 
   ... and left you to gather sinew with my other half , who will bring light thereby to that mortal idea that brings [ the gods ] great joy , that is , freedom , which even the heavens do not truly know ,, 
  the mention of other half is interesting . 
  vivec often mentions his two halves in the lessons , often attributing his actions and deeds to his mortal or divine self . 
  in this case , it is more likely pelinal talks about one of his divine counterparts , so either lorkhan or akatosh . 
  in this case , i would put my money on lorkhan , based on the fact that sinews are mentioned , as well as freedom , and him being the god of mortals and flesh . 
  lorkhan is also related to the idea of freedom as illustrated in the second volume , where the concept is named shezzar who goes missing . 
  as vehk points out in `` vehk 's teachings '' :, 
   and this is the most-reached destination of all that embark upon this road . 
  why would lorkhan and his ( unwitting ? ), 
  agents sabotage their experiments with the tower ? 
  why would he crumble that which he esteems ? 
  perhaps he failed so you might know how not to . 
  just like in the second volume , it is mentioned that this drive for freedom , and the ambition required for it , is something the gods love in mortals , and maybe even admire . 
  the gods seem to have a problem with understanding freedom , further enforcing the idea that enlightenment is only truly achievable for mortals ( even though those ideas are often given by gods ) . 
   [ which is ] why our father , the ... [ text lost ] ... in those first [ days/spirits/swirls ] before convention ... that which we echoed in our earthly madness . 
  [ let us ] now take you up . 
  the text is very fragmented here , and it is hard to pinpoint what is actually said . 
  it seems to deal with tamriel as the arena . 
  akatosh is involved , and the text mentions the conflicts during the dawn . 
  i believe the text is implying that all conflicts on tamriel can be explained as myth-echoes of divine conflicts , often dealing with anuic and padomaic principles . 
  this is also the moment that the gods take up alessia as one of them . 
   we will [ show ] our true faces ... [ which eat ] one another in amnesia each age . 
  of course , all imagery regarding the gods is simply mortal fashion . 
  being infinite beings , it is likely that their true form is incomprehensible for mortals . 
  this last line also mentions the kalpic cycle ( if we can interpret age as meaning kalpa ) . 
  the gods are eaten by alduin ( or eat each other , as the text implies ) . 
  they destroy each other , and forget everything that happened , resetting the world to convention , and have the whole charade happen over and over again . 
  this ends the eigth volume : on his revelation at the death of the al-esh , and the song of pelinal . 
  while the adabal-a is n't part of the song , it does deal with the same period and themes . 
  first , the introduction to the text . 
   * editor 's note : the adabal-a is traditionally believed to be the memoirs of morihaus , consort to alessia the slave queen . 
  while this can not be historically verified , the adabal-a is certainly among the oldest written accounts to come down to us from the early first era . 
  being first era , it is probably about as old as the song , although the text is a lot less fragmented than the song . 
  the main character is morihaus , and it is possible that he himself wrote it ( although the editor seems to be a bit sceptical ) . 
   ** pelinal 's death **, 
  and in the blood-floored throne room of white-gold , the severed head of pelinal spoke to the winged-bull , morihaus , demigod lover of al-esh , saying , `` our enemies have undone me , and spread my body into hiding . 
  in mockery of divine purpose , the ayleids cut me into eighths , for they are obsessed with this number . '', 
  the first part of the adabal-a ties in with the events at the end of volume 7 of the song of pelinal . 
  it is likely their conversation is the one that alessia `` deigned not to hear '' in the seventh volume . 
  morihaus arrives a day after the slaughtering of umaril and pelinal , and finds pelinal 's head in the middle of the room . 
  pelinal is cut up in eight pieces , and mentions that the ayleids were obsessed with it . 
  while it is hard to find actual archaeological evidence of this , we do have enough evidence that they were obsessed with the wheel , most notably in the planning of their cities . 
  according to vivec , the wheel has eight spokes , and eight is a number that pops up multiple times throughout tamriel , considering that the aedra number eight . 
   and morihaus , confused , snorted through his ring , saying , `` your crusades went beyond her counsel , whitestrake , but i am a bull , and therefore reckless in my wit . 
  i think i would go and gore our prisoners if you had left any alive . 
  you are blood-made-glorious , uncle , and will come again , as fox animal or light . 
  cyrod is still ours . '', 
  morihaus often downplays himself . 
  he is pretty insecure about his looks , and now downplays his intelligence . 
  he also mentions that he wants to avenge pelinal , even though that is not necessarily necessary . 
  morihaus seems to hint that pelinal is a shezzarrine . 
  blood-made-glorious can be implied to mean a champion of mortals . 
  an incarnation of lorkhan , being the god of mortals ( and flesh and blood ) can be considered such . 
  in any case , pelinal is more than mere mortal . 
  the shezzarine thing is also further enforced by the fact that morihaus says that he will return . 
  the fox animal can be a reference to hans the fox , one of ysgramor 's pets in `` the five hundred mighty companions or thereabouts of ysgramor the returned '' , and often named as shezzarine , or arnand the fox , who is placed in the same list as pelinal , ysmir and arctus by mannimarco in `` where were you when the dragon broke '' . 
  i 'm having a bit more trouble placing `` light '' , and my only guesses are that of a guiding/protecting light , or maybe the serpent . 
  morihaus also states the battle is won , and even though pelinal died , cyrodiil now belongs to the nedes . 
   then pelinal spoke again for the last time : `` beware , morihaus , beware !, 
  with the foresight of death i know now that my foe yet lives , bitter knowledge to take to my grave . 
  better that i had died believing myself the victor . 
  although cast beyond the doors of night , he will return . 
  be vigilant !, 
  i can no longer shield the host of men from umaril 's retribution . '', 
  it is strange that the text says that pelinal speaks here for the last time . 
  the final volume of the song ( although it might actually not be a part of the text ) says that he spoke at the death bed of alessia . 
  it is important to note that that volume in question is rather vague about who is actually speaking . 
  pelinal reveals that umaril is not truly dead , but went off to oblivion , to later return ( as attested in knights of the nine ) . 
  pelinal laments the fact that he , at least in his eyes , failed the rebellion , and warns for his return . 
  he states that he can not longer protect the nedes , although he does play a role in the exploits of the divine crusader . 
   ** alessia 's youth during the slave-years **, 
  perrif 's original tribe is unknown , but she grew up in sard , anon sardarvar leed , where the ayleids herded in men from across all the niben : kothri , nede , al-gemha , men-of - ` kreath ( though these were later known to be imported from the north ) , keptu , men-of-ge ( who were eventually destroyed when the flower king nilichi made great sacrifice to an insect god named [ lost ] ) , al-hared , men-of-ket , others ; but this was cyrod , the heart of the imperatum saliache , where men knew no freedom , even to keep family , or choice of name except in secret , and so to their alien masters all of these designations were irrelevant . 
  these lines give a whole list of all the different tribes living in cyrodiil at the time of the rebellion . 
  the kothri are most likely the kothringi , a race of man who used to live in modern day black marsh . 
  they are well attested , and were wiped-out by the knahaten flu of 2e 560 , probably engineered by the hists . 
  they were also often employed as guards by the second empire . 
  the nedes are the best known in this group . 
  this name also survives as the collective name for the proto-men living on tamriel before the atmorans and yokudans arrived , and they are normally named as the chief ( and sometimes sole ) ancestor to the bretons and imperials . 
  the al-gemha have disappeared from history , and the only result i got from searching in is a book added by tamriel rebuild , mentioning the place gemha , although i could not find the origin of the original book ( til did n't yield anything except this line from the adabal-a ) . 
  the men-of - ` kreath are probably the inhabitants around modern day falkreath , in skyrim , which historically was part of colovia . 
  the text mentions that they were imported from the north , so it could be that these were actually nords , and not a nedic or nede-like tribe . 
  there are just a few scraps regarding the keptu .
