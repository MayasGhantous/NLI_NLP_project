  oct 15 23:26:10 < mojo  finale is n't totally correct, 
  oct 15 23:26:17 < + rottendeadite  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coda_ ( music ), 
  oct 15 23:26:18 < ! dovahkiin  `` closing piece '', 
  oct 15 23:26:20 < + varanu  it 's not really / quite / a finale . 
  oct 15 23:26:20 < + rottendeadite  for the techincally minded . 
  oct 15 23:26:21 < ! dovahkiin  yeah, 
  oct 15 23:26:21 < + myrrlyn  yeah it 's more of a denouement , i guess ? 
  oct 15 23:26:22 < ! dovahkiin  i was about to link that, 
  oct 15 23:26:33 < + varanu  oh man . 
  you know what would be / amazing / ? 
  oct 15 23:26:35 < + varanu  landfall fugue . 
  oct 15 23:26:43 < + varanu  i would listen to that / for ever / . 
  oct 15 23:26:45 < mojo  it 's an ending that is separate from the rest of the piece, 
  oct 15 23:27:02 < % mk  seriously , hold and i 'll answer the music question, 
  oct 15 23:28:07 < _ stille _  we 're holding , we 're just holding while chattering excitedly at each other like kids on christmas day waiting for the big present to be opened :p, 
  oct 15 23:29:01 < % mk  do n't get too worked up, 
  oct 15 23:29:13 < % mk  tamriel, 
  oct 15 23:29:17 < % mk  starry heart, 
  oct 15 23:29:25 < % mk  that whole fucking thing is a song, 
  oct 15 23:29:37 < % mk  it was made either out of 12 planets, 
  oct 15 23:29:57 < % mk  or from two brothers that split in the womb, 
  oct 15 23:30:12 < % mk  either way , it 's the primal wail, 
  oct 15 23:30:26 < % mk  and those that grew up on it, 
  oct 15 23:30:33 < % mk  they ca n't help but hear it, 
  oct 15 23:30:36 < % mk  and add to it, 
  oct 15 23:30:45 < % mk  or try to control it, 
  oct 15 23:30:48 < % mk  or run from it, 
  oct 15 23:31:07 < % mk  the reason there is music on tamriel at all, 
  oct 15 23:31:17 < % mk  is because it exists, 
  oct 15 23:31:32 < % mk  it was and is, 
  oct 15 23:31:47 < % mk  and it will not stop, 
  oct 15 23:31:55 < % mk  there are repeats in it, 
  oct 15 23:32:03 < % mk  plays on a tune, 
  oct 15 23:32:10 < % mk  variations, 
  oct 15 23:32:26 < % mk  and most likely, 
  oct 15 23:32:34 < % mk  magnus ? 
  oct 15 23:32:43 < % mk  he 's the one that made the fucker, 
  oct 15 23:32:55 < % mk  and now that 's why he looks back on it, 
  oct 15 23:33:01 < % mk  every single day, 
  oct 15 23:33:11 < % mk  that 's his promise, 
  oct 15 23:33:21 < % mk  when you wake up , i will still listen, 
  oct 15 23:33:27 < % mk  i 'm sorry i left, 
  oct 15 23:33:28 < % mk  but hey, 
  oct 15 23:33:36 < % mk  i 'm still right up here, 
  oct 15 23:34:04 < % mk  and my mnemoli ? 
  they show up every now and then . 
  oct 15 23:34:17 < % mk  and collect all the songs you 've made since the last time around, 
  oct 15 23:34:22 < % mk  the last real moment, 
  oct 15 23:34:39 < % mk  the mnemoli ? 
  oct 15 23:34:48 < % mk  they 're the keepers of the elder scrolls . 
  oct 15 23:34:54 < % mk  they can not be fixed until seen . 
  oct 15 23:35:05 < % mk  and they can not be seen until a moment . 
  oct 15 23:35:18 < % mk  and you , your hero , makes that moment ,, 
  oct 15 23:35:24 < % mk  does that make sense ? 
  oct 15 23:35:27 < + umpteen  a lot . 
  oct 15 23:35:27 < _ stille _  yes, 
  oct 15 23:35:28 < % mk  cuz i 'm done . 
  well , dagoth ur was insane , but sheogorath is a mystery in itself ( come to think of it , he is pretty insane as well ), 
   oct 17 23:58:08 < transcrybyr  how does the sharmat 's line i am older than music tie in with the concept of music as a fundamental element of the world ? 
  oct 17 23:58:48 < dovahkiin  doom drum ? 
  oct 17 23:59:01 < mk  nice one . 
  he 's ego-trippin ' and balls-trippin ' at the same time . 
  remember , that quote is from the sermons . 
  consider the source . 
  well , mk , his creator , just said that . 
  i do n't have an answer for sheo , though , so that is something to look into, 
  this is ... brilliant . 
  i 'm quite speechless, 
  the skaal were the nords of bloodmoon ( it was also set on solstheim ) . 
  the original pantheon of the nords was n't expanded on , but the skaal religion was described for the first time . 
   i 'm sorry i left, 
  this is strangely powerful, 
  [ they are not the only one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdzn7k5rzlq ), 
  the sun is the hole in oblivion magnus left when he fled creation , escaping to aetherius . 
  the magna-ge , his followers , escaped via their own holes , the stars . 
  this is why the stars and the sun are responsible for the magicka on nirn , as they are the portals to the realm of magic . 
  o i speak german ( not fluent , but i can get the general meaning out of it ) . 
  that , and i had some experience with germans . 
  i skip one night , and this happens :p, 
  but very well done , myrr !, 
  lorkhan is n't the architect tough , that is magnus ( or composer , if you will ) . 
  lorkhan 's heart was , however , used for tonal architecture by the dwarfs , and , because of the beating of the heart , and the connection between lorkhan and improsonment layed down by the elves , it was dubbed the doom drum . 
  still some clever writing by mk . 
  the posts might have dived too deep into the specifics too fast , regarding the music . 
  mk said that the whole aurbis is music ( the transcripts are in the aurbis : the musical thread , and definitly worth reading ) . 
  the idea is as simple as that . 
  i personally think it is a beautiful idea that the whole tes universe is a dream about music , but that is besides the point . 
  since everything is music , some looked into the implecations of what that might mean . 
  myrrlyn 's ( start of a sentence here ) work , for instance , focussed on the role of the gods and the towers , since this brings forth a whole deal of musical symbolism . 
  but yeah , it might have gone too fast for people who had n't read all the threads this week . 
  do n't take it personal , you did great work . 
  if someone does not catch up fast enough , they can ask for information ( like this thread ) . 
  the fact that skyrim was attacked was out of convenience . 
  firstly , the time-wound , which send alduin to the future , was there , as well as all the dragon mounts ( the dragons ruled skyrim in the past , and as such did not go far outside of the province ) .
