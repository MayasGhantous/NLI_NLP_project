  anu is stasis , and padomay is chance . 
  in one dream , padomay killed nir , who was anu 's lover ( not nir ** n ** ) , and was killed by anu . 
  anu then fled to the sun , and started dreaming , becoming an amaranth . 
  this means that someone becomes conscious in his dream , and creates a world therein . 
  anu 's dream is the tes universe . 
  in this dream , padomay also exists ( nir to my knowledge not ) . 
  out of the conflict between the two primordial beings , guided by their souls , anui-el for anu , and sithis for padomau , the grey maybe was formed in the void . 
  this grey maybe was what later bevame the aurbical wheel . 
  in the grey maybe , the et ` ada formed . 
  they remained there , without much change , until lorkhan convinced some of them to create mundus . 
  the et ` ada that helped lorkhan either fled , becoming the magna-ge , sacrificed themselves , becoming earth bones and ehlnofey ( mortals ) , died , or were severely sundered , becoming the aedra ( `` out ancestors '' ) and fully relient on the worship of mortals . 
  my interpretation of thr story is that the wanderers who worshipped kyne split of from the other wanderers there , eventually becoming atmoran , and later nord . 
  the source of nedes being ancestors of all men is the pge , written by the igs . 
  that is the same group of people that say redguards are n't human , all imga like altmer ( even though maruhk hated them ) , and that alduin is just another name for akatosh . 
  point is , the nede theory has too many holes , and as such , we adhere to the old ehlnofey/wanderers theory . 
  i think it was a developer theory , but i do need to look that up . 
  you achieve amaranth by realising you are the one dreaming . 
  chim is that you realise you are in a dream , yet still exist . 
  chim is not achieved by the dreamer , but by the dreamed . 
  also , what we have now seen from amaranths is that they do n't mantle the dreamer of their dream , but create a new world ( very inception-like ) . 
  if the godhead wakes up , the dream is over . 
  on the other hand , dreams are timeless , so that might take a very long time . 
  i really do n't mind . 
  i actually like my philosophy getting tested :d . 
  i would adept , but it wo n't feel right to me . 
  this is mostly because i have been raised with a moral code that is almost completely different from the nazi philosophy . 
  in order to be able to live in a different society , and to have social contacts there , one needs to adept . 
  do n't get me wrong , i also think it 's down . 
  my only point is language here . 
  sundered does not mean the same as dead or down . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm convinced killing the handicapped is wrong . 
  my point is , i 'm convinced that i find this a bad thing , because i was raised with the idea that it is a bad thing . 
  like i said , morallity is a social construct . 
  if i was raised in a society whose moral code says it is good ( like the nazi regime you named ) , i would think it is . 
  going from this assumption of morality , i 'm ok with changing my moral codes to adjust to another society . 
  still , i would be uncomfortable with adhering to a moral code that is so opposed to my , like with nazism . 
  uesp is a good source for information , but it sticks to in-game sources . 
  when you take out of game sources in account , which can be found on the bethesda forum , til , and here , the discussions get a lot more depth . 
  first of , i 'm not an american ( i 'm dutch , in fact . 
  on a global scale , the differences are trivial , but there are some important differences , like a more liberal stance towards religion/atheism , drugs , and sexuality , to name a few ) . 
  i do n't necesarilly reject the idea of a god . 
  when i look at nature , and humanity , i do n't see the necessity of a supernatural being , and , following occam 's razor , i do n't believe in a god ( the key-word is `` believe '' here ) . 
  i do n't believe in a universal truth to start with , since in my opinion there would n't be a source able to create such an universal concept . 
  i believe that these moral codes are part of the culture they originated in , and as such the source of this code is the masses . 
  i stand wholly behind the notion of equality , as i am convinced that that is what 's `` good '' . 
  however , i am also convinced that this truth is bound to my culture . 
  under different circumstances , i might have thought different about equality . 
  about me adhering to all of my culture 's moral code : mostly , but not all . 
  i can not name an example at the moment , but in the end , we are all free to choose our own moral code ( ironically , freedom is also an ideal in my culture ) . 
  anu is the amaranth in the dream above that of the tes universe . 
  mk confirmed this a couple of weeks back . 
  you are right about chim , which i explained too vague . 
  with anu being the amaranth , we can safely assume that there is a sort of lucid dreaming invlolved . 
  still , to my understanding , the dream ( s ) above this one have not ceased to exist ( when mantling , it would mean that the current dream would continue on , which is not the case ) . 
  instead , a new dream is created . 
  depends on what part of the aurbis . 
  it is everything in the dream , except for the void ( which is the absence of sound ) . 
  the daedric realms would sound like the tones of their respective prince . 
  i always envisioned aetherius to sound cacaphonic . 
  mundus would sound more organised , but also more changing and alternating . 
  it is more changing in nature than the other realms , due to being more free , since it has no prince . 
  exactly , that is why everyones pissed of about it . 
  gameplay reasons . 
  you can build in a nice questline this way . 
  cyrodiil was supposed to be a jungle . 
  when oblivion was announced , there was a retcon which had tiber septim change the climate to what we see in oblivion . 
  es :o has the same climate as oblivion , eventhough tiber septim was n't even born yet then . 
  i 'm wondering : why did you choose for representing the gradients sliding down , and not horizontal or vertical ? 
  there is advancement . 
  we are talking about civilisations that have active spacetravel . 
  also , with the presence of magic , there is little need for technological advancements ( the `` spaceships '' also work with magicka ) . 
  also , most advancement is by the elite . 
  while the simple farmer might profit from technological advancement since he has no mages in his family , the upper-class does not wish for it , as they have magic readily available . 
  if the upper-class does not want it , research will not be stimulated or funded . 
  `` two suns light the way to salvation , and the twin lamps light the way to freedom '', 
  someone mentioned this on the irc . 
  i have no idea how right it is , but it seems interesting . 
  hmm , i do n't know . 
  my idea is that the music we are describing here is n't like the music we hear , but music is litteraly ** everything ** ( indeed , mk mentioned that all the different senses are n't that different after all ) . 
  maybe the music you hear is the aurbical music , but i 'm guessing it is just gameplay related . 
  dwarfz are rela an stil exst cuz there kul an thei hv beadrs an they dont takke shit from dark elfz an they not dead the come back, 
  there are some faults in the map though . 
  while anequina and pallatine are officially independent , they are also client states of the aldmeri dominion ( not to mention that the general khajiit does not give a damn about the states , and is grateful to the ad for bringing back the moons ) . 
  also , where do you base it of that morrowind split with the empire ? 
  they were overrun , and their government was practically non-existent , but they never officially split from the empire . 
  maybe the new man ? 
  because it is not in their interest . 
  while the argonians can be supersoldiers , they are with relatively few . 
  furthermore , the hist only live in black marsh , and are contempt with living in a small cornour , where they wo n't be disturbed by others . 
  it refers to landfall , a cataclystic event at the end of the fourth era . 
  it will be fully discussed in c0da , which is a comic mk is working on . 
  it will be released in the first quarter of 2014 . 
  i think they can . 
  there was a rumour that kothringi were also a hist experiment , but there are no hard sources on that . 
  they stick with argonians , though . 
  i think the amaranth does exist in his own dream . 
  we know that anu is the amaranth of the previous dream , and he also exists in the current dream . 
  yet we know that dragonborn are mortal . 
  tiber septim was dragonborn ( both like alesia and the ldb ) , yet he died as well . 
  of course not , but my point was that anu is represented in his own dream , albeit in a different role .
