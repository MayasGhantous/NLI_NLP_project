  i could n't find anything about major assimilation . 
  the direnni had an alliance with the ayleid city states , and openly opposed the order , so i can imagine that some of them fled to balfiera . 
  here you go . 
  it is a pretty dense text , so if you have trouble , use the searchbar to see past discussions on it . 
  a c0da is an headcanon ( a concept or idea you have a hunch of being right or accept , but do n't actually have a source or proof of ) . 
  it comes from the text by michael kirkbride of the same name . 
  most fanfiction/apocrypha/monkey truth springs from headcanons , but since the latter is personal , and the former public , they are n't exactly the same thing . 
  he was the champion of the empire , insane , and destroyed umaril . 
  he is ** very ** closely tied to pelinal . 
  molag bal knows about chim . 
  remember , he is a ** prince ** , not a king . 
  probably . 
  an important part of chim is limits . 
  daedra , being older than the concept of limits , have a harder time understanding it than mortals with infinity . 
  it happens to the best of us . 
  no , but seriously . 
  you ca n't compete with ifw when it comes to writing . 
  no one can :p, 
  congrats to ifw !, 
  i have n't been as active as i was planning . 
  a friend of mine came over , and i still had to do stuff for uni next week . 
  since that is starting as well , i probably wo n't be having that much time in the coming weeks especially since i 'll be having about 2-3 hours of travelling daily . 
  anyway , a good next week to all of ya !, 
  never thought about it that way . 
  still though , it seams that the elven names are derived from real-life languages . 
  ald - from `` ald '' , old english for old , alt - from latin `` altus ( high , long ) , bos - from dutch `` bos '' ( forest ) , dun - from german `` dunkel '' ( dark ) . 
  orsimer and dwemer are plays on orc and dwarf ( in arena , they were n't considered elves ) . 
  maormer is probably a reference to maori . 
  i do n't know where chi - comes from . 
  fal - might be a reference to snowfall , but i 'm not sure . 
  still , your explenation sounds much more interesting . 
  i guess the dunmer and dwemer are kind of fighting for the position of least-favoured , being non-believers and heretics . 
  as a european , i do n't understand why this is a bad thing . 
  the picture is the current dream . 
  the uncoloured part at the bottom is the previous dream , in which this one exist . 
  the frame is sithis and anui-el , the drives of sithis and padomay , the things that cause creation and subgradiance . 
  the person is the aurbis ( which ties in with christian theology in that god is all ) . 
  his eyes are anu and padomay . 
  they give a sense of depth , but also tie in with perception , which is a very important aspect in tes lore . 
  the arm holding the compass is magnus . 
  he was the architect , and his followers the fingers ) are the magna-ge . 
  herma-mora , knowledge , and aka , time , are closely aligned to him in that they cause some form of organisation . 
  the arm holding the world is lorkhan/shor , the person who set the limits of mundus and came up with the plan . 
  his followers are the aedra ( fingers ) , with y' ffre being closest to the sphere because of him being an earthbone . 
  i guess the other things like the void and oblivion are clear . 
  i ca n't help you with sheo , though , as i do n't really understand that allegory ( he did have a special link with lorkhan , though ) . 
  it is not a litteral representation , and there are some weird things ( like mundus and oblivion being outside of the aurbis ) , but that is understandable when you use an already existing piece of art . 
  edit : forgot the tower . 
  towers uphold mundus and aka made the first when trying to impose order on mundus and punish lorkhan . 
  again , this allegory ( and its tie to magnus ) i do n't really get . 
  edit2 : op explained sheo up above . 
  also , note that the foot reaches into the frame of the previous dream . 
  anu remembers that , and the current one is shaped after it . 
  since i love languages , but am a disaster at statistics , i 'll go ahead and post what i think is a good overview of language families . 
  go ahead and criticize the shit out of it . 
  all languages belong to the ehlnofexic super-family , with the exception of jel and dragonic , which are isolates . 
  ehlnofexic splits in meric ( a-ehlnofexic ) and manish ( r-ehlnofexic ) . 
  here we get the following distribution . 
  * morro-aldmeric : bosmeris , altmeris , and dunmeris . 
  historically aldmeris . 
  * ta'agra ` iss : isolated within the family . 
  * dwemo-falmeric : dwemeris and falmeris, 
  * ayleidoon : isolate within the family . 
  maormer and lhe as of yet unclassified . 
  manish :, 
  * yoku : isolate wihin the family, 
  * nedic : tamrielic and breton , as well as reachian . 
  historically colovian , nibenese , kothri and other dialects of the nedic people . 
  * nordic : nordic , as well as some extinct languages . 
  classes are starting so i will probably edit this when i 'm done . 
  edit : edited some things in the families . 
  edit2 : i figured that , without any real vocabulary of most of those languages , any reasonable classification is impossible . 
  only speculation , then . 
  writing as we speak, 
  [ and here it is ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/2fh53n/the_great_hunt_of_the_traveller/ ), 
  no , but there is a `` buy one , get one '' offer on the v. 
  the alik ' r are simply a people . 
  they are nomads from the desert . 
  i guess some of them would sell themselves as mercenaries or assassins , but the word itself refers to the people . 
  there is the gray prince in oblivion ( orc , orc mother , imperial father ) . 
  also , in the pge , 3rd edition , there is a mention of one of berenziah 's offspring being altmer after the mother . 
  i think the first mention of it was in the pge , first edition . 
  it was released with the collector 's edition of redguard . 
  it mentions the reman and aldmeri dominion space programs ( all first era ) . 
  the game battlespire takes place on one of those void battle stations . 
  that 's gon na be one fucked up * catfish * episode, 
  yes . 
  compare albanian in the indo-european superfamily . 
  albanian is n't rven faintly intellegible with other languages in the area , but shares some structural similarities with the rest of the indo-european languages , as well as some very basic vocabulary ( like the names for numbers ) . . 
  of course . 
  many dunmer make their living in cyrodiil , and some of them found the import of telvanni bug musk to be a profital bussiness . 
  it is available at some importers in the imperial city , as well as cheydinhall . 
  of course , that is not the whole picture . 
  many fakes are circulating on the black markets of the ic abd leyawiin , and bravil smugglers have gained huge riches by the illegal trade of it . 
  or you figure out an entirely different back story . 
  edit : for real imersion , have the eec wage a war in bravil over trading right woth the smugglers . 
  `` the pocket guide to the empire , first edition '' . 
  the song of pelinal is definitly one of my favourites . 
  nice story , and it fleshes pelinal out really well . 
  it 's certainly an epic , yeah .
