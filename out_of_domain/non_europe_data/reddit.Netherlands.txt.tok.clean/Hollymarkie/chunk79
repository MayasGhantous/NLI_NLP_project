  remember that the role of pariah is central to orcish culture . 
  also , some orcs have fully adopted to dunmeri culture , and see themselves more as inhabitants of morrowind than orcs ( although dunmer make it hard for them ) . 
   how are all of you ? 
  time for holly 's hour of bitching !, 
  seriously though , i 'm feeling a lot better . 
  my grades are better than expected and i will more than likely get through my first year of university , which means i can relax a bit more . 
  also , with the break for the holidays coming on , i might actually finish some writing . 
  on the downside , i really fucked it up with a girl , which makes things ... awkward , sort of . 
  we ca n't really avoid eachother ( or really want to ) , but any conversation seems forced . 
  kind of feel bad about that . 
  still though , life is going strong , still . 
  the nords have a very agressive culture , one which focusses on violence and physical strength . 
  to races like the altmer ( who value art ) , or imperials ( who value trade and military tactics ) , they come of as primitive , which is often seen by people as dumb . 
  i do n't know . 
  she did want to remain friends , and another guy that is somewhat important to her ( something with an `` adoption '' system in our student association ) tries to involve me in their conversations . 
  still , though , it does feel less weird than right after it happened , so there is some improvement . 
  i do n't mind . 
  this is all sort of anonymous , and i doubt any of you guys could actually do anything with that information ( and if you do , i 'm gon na shank you ) . 
  i 'm still of the opinion that imperial scholars might understand it ( or at least are n't completely ignorant of it ) , but that the igs declares their findings as invalid . 
  the imperials definitly have a gain from portraying nordic and imperial culture as vastly similair , as history has proven that an empire can only stand woth its nordic support . 
  'cause fargoth still had some bills to pay . 
  no one fucks with frodo . 
  no one . 
  probably anthropological stuff ( ** cough ** on the species ** cough ** ) . 
  i really like the imperials and redguards , but i have been struggling with writing for a while . 
  some metaphysical stuff is really awesome , and i have been meaning to get more involved in that side , but a lot goes over my head in that regard , and i do n't really have the time to study them well . 
  alright , tbe following is my own theory on the matter , so take it if you like it . 
  recently ( some months ago ) , mk placed the continents of yokuda , tamriel , and akavir on the axis of time , with yokuda being the past , tamriel the present , and akavir the future . 
  i believe that the continents of atmora , tamriel , and aldmeris form a different axis , namely of stasis and change ( anu and padomay ) . 
  atmora is pure stasis ( literaly frozen in time ) and aldmeris is pure change ( ever-shifting and unmarkable on a map ) . 
  so what does this mean for their peoples and their pasts . 
  the latter is simple : nothing . 
  atmora is pretty much stuck in time , while aldmeris is ever shifting and not really placable in time . 
  for the former : the people of atmora felt stuck , and unable to progress whatsoever , and wanted change . 
  the people on aldmeris , on the other hand , felt that they could not progress due to the ever changing nature of their continent , meaning that they could not settle well enough to create a civilisation . 
  this caused both groups to move to tamriel , causing conflict and war ( indeed , tamriel is named the arena for a reason ) . 
  also , apologies in advance for vagueness and spelling mistakes . 
  i 'm a bit drunk ( or more than that ) , and i 'll probably edit some next morning . 
  yes , that is bassicaly it . 
  tamriel is where ideologies and peoples come to fight it out , and conflict breeds progress ( towards the amaranth ) . 
  it might sound arrogant from imperials when they say it , but cyrodiil and the ic are the centre of the universe , more than just figuratively . 
  ada-mantia and red mountain are created by the gods . 
  all others are made by the people of nirn . 
  well , there was the story that they had two actual elder scrolls in the basement . 
  one was unreadable , and the other badly damaged , creating strange tales that happened and did n't happen at once . 
  still , i do n't know about any actual development stories . 
  i was under the impression the borders of colovia/the alessian empire would extend further north historically , as falkreath was considered colovian . 
  other than that , very cool map . 
   as kurufinve said , pge1 is the way to go . 
  give the whole thing a read . 
  with a grain of salt though . 
  when dealing with cyrodiil , it is a bit safer to read , but generally , the igs has a way with facts . 
  it does point out what could be bullshit , but the commentator might not be completely unbiased . 
  the aedra can maniphest on nirn . 
  think of the dragon at the end of oblivion , and there was an avatar of mara in morrowind ( i 'll get the link for you tomorrow ) . 
  it does take a lot more of them than it does for talos , so it does n't happen often . 
  evil is only whag you make it to be . 
  the elder scrolls universe does not have a moral universe . 
  the imperial cult does think so , but some races disagree with that . 
  but no , daedra ca n't really influence the aedra . 
  every aedra and daedric prince is infinite in their own sphere , but in nothing else . 
  they would be curbstomped of they would try moving out of it . 
  their form and their life support . 
  they were fractured after creation and convention . 
  due to mythopoeic ( myth becomes reality ) forces , they gained strength , but also different forms . 
  this is why there is a much bigger difference between versions of the same aedra between cultures than with daedra . 
  akatosh did n't really create dragons . 
  dragons are shards of aka , who is the time-oversoul . 
  when mundus was created , he was fractured , and fully shattered when he slammed himself into mundus to call convention . 
  the biggest shards still held some potency over time , and these were shaped into the time gods . 
  smaller shards held little to no potency over it , and many became dragons . 
  they probably lust for power because alduin does , and he commands them . 
  alduin had forsworn his role as the destroyer of the world , and took up the role of conquerer , which is not his sphere , and is the reason the dragonborn could defeat him . 
  it 's more a sense of suspended living . 
  think of vampires . 
  as long as they feed they can live on for ever , but cut them up or throw then in a fire , and they 're gone . 
  the relation mortals have to gods ( aedra , daedra , other ) seems to be more like how the greeks and romans treated their gods than how christians do . 
  people strike a pact of sorts with them . 
  they ask for x and give y in return , instead of the general `` thank you '' that is given in abrahamitic religion . 
  ` coda ' can have multiple meanings . 
  in movies , it is an extra scene after the credit role . 
  in linguistics , it is the final consonant ( cluster ) at the end of a syllable . 
  the most likely origin , however , is its musical connotation . 
  a coda is a prolonged part of a song to signal its end . 
  this ties in well with the `` aurbis the musical '' idea . 
  c0da is about the birth of a new universe . 
  it is n't really the end of this one , but it does deal with the moment that dream fulfilled its purpose . 
  the exact spelling probably has to do with some more sci-fi elements of tes ( like the dreamsleeve transmissions , spaceships , tal ( os ) , etc. ) . 
  i could n't think of a different title . 
  i 'm bad with them . 
  according to wikipedia ( prestigious , innit ? ), 
  it ends a sequence . 
  i do n't know much about music myself , so for all i know it could refer to a return to the refrain . 
  still though , the new dreamer will not reset the universe to convention . 
  he starts a new dream , semi-independent from the previous dream . 
  nothing indicates that the kalpa will end , or that the universe ceases to be ( in fact , kinmune takes place in the 9th era , even though c0da is in the 5th ) . 
  yeah , because names like ` smith ' and ` williams ' are really common in morocco , a country only gives its nationality to people who bear arab names . 
  yes he did . 
  he mentions how he changed cyrus ' timeline , so that he did not use the pankratosword against vivec . 
  he also does some strange things with that dying pirate , although that just might be due to the moon fucking with him .
