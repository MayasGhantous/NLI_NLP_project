  probably depends on who is against who exactly , and in what environment and time . 
  both are pretty dangerous . 
  the line between mortal and divine is often pretty vague . 
  dagoth ur was a ( un ) dead god , and he gave his brothers the power of the heart . 
  that makes them about as divine as almalexia and sotha sil , if they can ne considered as such . 
  my take on the appearance of the broarhearts can be found in the `` rape of the reach '' ( i 'm on my phone and too lazy and too drunk to look the exact chapter up right now ) . 
  i took it they imitated hircine , as one of the old gods . 
  but take what you like . 
  it is never clearly stated in texts why they appear as they appear . 
  lorkhan is the god of flesh . 
  what are undead but heaps of muscle , animated by magicka . 
  well , there is this description of pelinal :, 
   he was pelinal the whitestrake because of his left hand , made of a killing light ;, 
  which is somewhat similar to the description given in `` from the memory stone of makela leki '' :, 
   i reached for shehai , the spirit sword , that which i could never reliably form when i needed it , and behold ... it was alive . 
  ** alive with fire ** . 
  it is also interesting to note that the left hand seemed to be important in sword-singer tradition , as cyrus switched his sword arm unconsciously in `` lord vivec 's sword meeting with cyrus the restless '' after he slept with a memory stone under his pillow . 
  still , pelinal is a divine robot , so he might be an exception to normal rules . 
  i have n't seen anything similar in other groups . 
  `` where were you when the dragon broke '' and `` the dragon breaks re-examined '' directly disagree on the existence of dragon breaks . 
  we also know that there was a group called `` the beautiful '' in the summerset isles in the late third era . 
  their ideas ( more contact and assimilation with tamriel ) went counter to those of the thalmor . 
  it is possible they were hunted down by the thalmor , but it is n't really clear what happened to them . 
  the thalmor will at least destroy nirn as we know it , but it wo n't completely be gone . 
  the wheels of lull will keep turning and ticking . 
  as for zero-summing : that is an interesting idea , however it can not be used to spread love . 
  chim makes it possible for an individual to know love , amd work with it , while zero-summing might have an individual know love for a fraction of a moment , but that person is then erased from existence retroactively . 
  also , is it that bad to want to hold on to the form of existence that you know ? 
  if you got a ticket to a state of non-existence right now , would you take it ? 
  or would you choose the other route and become a god in this world ? 
  it does , however allow you to do things out of love ( capital letter ) . 
  from `` from the many-headed talos '' :, 
   '' ` you have suffered for me to win this throne , and i see how you hate jungle . 
  let me show you the power of talos stormcrown , born of the north , where my breath is long winter . 
  i breathe now , in royalty , and reshape this land which is mine . 
  ** i do this for you , red legions , for i love you ** . ' '',

  the main question here is : how common was the dragon language in early atmoran and nordic culture . 
  sure , a lot of texts refer to kings and champions using the voice , but those were kings and champions . 
  would their servants have active knowledge of the language ? 
  seeing the destructive force of shouts , and the fact that the ancient nords were able to kick the dragons out with the voice , it would not be unthinkable that the cult had restrictions on its use . 
  also , as illustrated by the greybeards in skyrim 's mq , knowledge of the words is n't the same as their full meaning , with both being a necessity for shouting . 
  most of the draugrs would not have had active knowledge of the language during their lives , which was more than likely restricted to the priests and high officers of the dragon cult . 
  there are some faults in logic here . 
  the 8 divines are the aedra , on the first hand , and not necessarily of stasis ( anuic ) . 
  the daedra are n't necessarily of change ( padomaic ) as well . 
  the aedra are susceptible to a process called mythopoeia , which you described . 
  the beliefs of the followers shape their gods . 
  this is due to the fact that creation caused the aedra to fall in a sort of coma , and their worshippers are their life support . 
  the daedra , having not taken part in creation , seem to be not or to a lesser amount affected by this . 
  the daedra do n't really have to concern themselves with nirn , but at least 16/17 princes do , and they all have different reasons for this . 
  with alduin and akatosh , you are gon na get in a huge clusterfuck of things , so hold on . 
  initially , both were the same being , aka , the eternal time god . 
  after creation , and the dragon already being weakened , he called convention , to decide the fate of mundus and of lorkhan . 
  aka then body slammed/crashed his space ship ada-mantia ( adamant tower in high rock ) into nirn , further shattering himself . 
  these shards flew around , all of varying sizes . 
  the smaller ones , having no authority over time , became the dragons . 
  the bigger ones kept some aspect of time , and became the gods . 
  this made auri-el the start of time , alkosh the maintenance , and alduin the end . 
  akatosh , on the other hand , was created later . 
  the marukhati selective , a group within the first era alessian order , danced atop the tower ( which one is unclear , but it might have been either ada-mantia or white-gold ) , mantling the aurbis ( the universe ) in the process . 
  since the aurbis is music , and dancing is walking to music , they `` walked like them , untill they walk like you '' , which is one of the `` walking-ways '' ( ways to become a god ) . 
  by changing the pattern at that moment , the selective was able to change their time god to something they wanted , namely akatosh . 
  this also led to a dragon break , a moment ( s ) where time flows forward , backwards and sideways , which was said to have lasted 1008 years , and is called the middle dawn . 
  akatosh did n't necessarily oppose alduin 's role as the world-eater . 
  the problem was that alduin had forsaken this role , and was more concerned with conquering and ruling nirn . 
  since conquest is out of his sphere of influence ( that is talos ' thing ) , he sucked at it , and got his ass handed to him . 
  * the 17th prince is jyggalag , if you consider him different from sheo, 
  * akatosh is an aedra , yes . 
  if alduin eats the world , it would simply be the end of the kalpa , and the world would be reset to the moment of convention , after which the gods will simply be shaped anew by different peoples . 
  * no telling what talos thought of this . 
  he might have been mad , or interested , or simply figured alduin would somehow fuck up and got send back with his tail between his legs . 
   what music have you been listening to lately ? 
  i 've been listening a bit to godspeed you !, 
  black emperor and wax fang , as well as to some dutch hip-hop ( typhoon is great ) . 
  also , i 've been relistening to cream , ever since i saw a documentery on ginger baker . 
  the guy is a complete sociopath , but an incredible drummer . 
  apart from [ spaceships , giant sun cannons ] ( http://www.imperial-library.info/content/tiber-septim%e2%80%99s-sword-meeting-cyrus-restless ) , [ a genocidal , schyzophrenic robot ] ( http://www.imperial-library.info/content/song-pelinal-volume-2-his-coming ) , [ the memospore ] ( http://www.imperial-library.info/content/dominion-prism-textract ) , and [ a reality shattering robot ] ( http://uesp.net/wiki/lore:numidium ) , among others , technological development has been strangely lacking . 
  according to some traditions within tamriel , the world was better off without men/mer , or without mortality at all . 
  put that with the fact that tamriel is dead centre in the aurbis , and that almost all major groups trace their ancestry to other places ( which might not always be true ) , tamriel is the place where people of different believes come to fight it out . 
  it is the arena , and completely and perpatualy war-torn . 
  the memospore funtions like a sort of internet . 
  technically , it is part of the dreamsleeve , which is where all souls go to die , but , being the thing that connects all souls , it can be used to contact between souls , being linked through memory . 
  what the_op3rat0r said , bassicaly . 
  uesp is a good wikipedia-like source , and generally redirects you to in-game sources about the subject . 
  the imperial library has most texts tes related , both from the games themselves and posted on the various fora by ( ex - ) developers . 
  in the compilation here , there is also a short `` required reading '' list . 
  there is also the selective lorecast , but they generally deal with the more heavier subjects and metaphysics ( although the first episode , about the unreliable narrator is very important ) . 
  finally , when reading the sources , remember that everyone in tamriel is a liar , dumb , or both . 
  sources often conflict with each other , and some might be outright wrong . 
  i guess that is the bare bones of how to find what your looking for . 
  generally , if you find anything what you do n't understand , you can ask it on the forum . 
  he did lead a rebellion against septim , and he is rumoured to be the hoonding , but he is still a pirate , of course . 
  hammerfell is n't empire or dominion , but entirely independent . 
  when the great war broke out , hammerfell was a target for conquest , and the dominion was successful in this . 
  when the white-gold concordat was signed , hammerfell rejected it , seceding from the empire completely . 
  the redguards continued a rebellion against the thalmor , which ended with the signing of the second treaty of stros m'kai . 
  this treaty forced the aldmeri dominion to withdraw all their troops from hammerfell . 
  the book the great war deals with this extensively .
