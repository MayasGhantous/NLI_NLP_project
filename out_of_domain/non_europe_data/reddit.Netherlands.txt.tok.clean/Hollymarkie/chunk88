  i really want to give you a snarky remark , but this might actually lead to a good discussion ( also : i 'm higher than a kite ) . 
  yes and no , depends on who . 
  almalexia is a god by the will of the people . 
  she is immortal and has super-human abilities , but the question remains if she is truly divine besides being believed to be . 
  almelexia would definitely poop . 
  now , sotha sil would definitely not poop . 
  he has been integrated completely with the clock work city , and would n't need any form of sustenance . 
  for vivec , both apply . 
  his divine self ( named vehk ) would n't , since this is a divine being that does n't need food . 
  his mortal self ( also named vehk , conveniently ) does poop , since he/she still eats . 
  this also fits with the general idea of vivec being both almalexia and sotha sil . 
  he is woman , and he is man . 
  he is chimer , and he is dunmer , he poops , and he does n't poop . 
  recalling from memory , the lizards get turned into argonians by licking the sap form the tree , but i do n't have any hard sources for this . 
  still , the amount of hist-sap ingested determines the amount of humanity the argonians have . 
  an argonian ingesting a little is still mostly a lizard , and argonians ingesting a lot are nearly indistinguishable from the human races . 
  it is possible the breasts are simply mimicking those of women of the other races . 
  edit : i am in no state to write, 
  [ i wrote this more than a year ago . 
  i was relatively new to the tes community , and probably missed a lot of information ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1k5gxi/on_the_species_of_tamriel_volume_vi_the/ ), 
  there is quite a bit of information on the orcs , especially about their dealings with the human races . 
  it is interesting to note that orcs pop up in all kinds of sources ( even in the lessons and father of the niben ) , even when they do n't deal with the west of tamriel . 
  often , it is used as a pejorative , but sometimes there might be more to it . 
  iirc , sotha sil would have lived on in the clockwork city even after the destruction of his body . 
  i think it was from dialogue with vivec in morrowind , but i 'm not sure . 
  the question is if they are even born outside of black marsh . 
  there is not much known about how argonians reproduce , but i know of no person of a mixed-argonian descend . 
  actually , that is one of the versions . 
  the version of the t\u00e1in i have here ( `` strachan , john ( ed . 
  ) , stories from the t\u00e1in , royal irish acadamy , dublin ( 1944 ) '' . 
  basically a selection of the old irish texts for study purposes ) mentions that s\u00e9tanta dropped his hurley and sliotar to grab the dog , and smashed him against a pillar , `` so that each limb sprung from his body '' . 
  it mentions then that there is another story that tells of how s\u00e9tanta struck the ball through the dog . 
  the funny thing is , he was 7 when he did this . 
  mostly , the political situation changes on tamriel . 
  for all we know , the eras are declared by kings and emperors . 
  still , shivering isles mentions that the grey march happens once every era , so it is possible eras hold more importance than simply being a convenience ( or , the shivering isles use a different era system , or it is just coincedence . 
  i think this can also be looked at in a more mundane light . 
  most of the prophecies we see are vague , unspecific , or are multiply interpretable . 
  it is n't so strange to imagine a person doing pretty improbable feats , and have multiple people yelling : `` hey , i think this story told of him coming '' . 
  also , there are prophecies which are only made up later , and inserted in a story as a narrative device . 
  the elder scrolls , having all knowledge of possible futures , are extremely vague , as they only say : `` well , this can happen . 
  but so can this , and that . '', 
  yeah , my language is a bit unclear . 
  i meant that whatever pelinal faced was daedric . 
  all atronachs are , indeed , daedric . 
  hmm , maybe , although i doubt the minotaurs are that influential in cyrodiil . 
  i 'm banging my head at my desk now . 
  i have been out of tes for a few months , and only really remembered the list of tribes from the adabal-a apparently ... 
  yeah , i was the philologist ... 
  ha , i did n't know that one . 
  it is n't in the game-version , though ( the one i 'm using for the quotes ) . 
  would you worship your older brother as a god ? 
  they might be in oblivion , but they are no daedra . 
  their soul is there , but they are dead for all intends and purposes . 
  the daedra , on the other hand , ca n't die , and are reborn whenever their physical form is destroyed . 
  yes , just weaker et ` ada . 
  more in the sense of being greater than most of the lesser daedra . 
  calling each other family might just be the fancy of immortals . 
  there are multiple answers . 
  he appeared as aka , the oversoul of all the time-gods . 
  he appeared as an semi-independent being after convention , when aka was shattered ( this is also the point where time became linear ) . 
  later on , his shard was continuously formed an shaped by the way the nords worshipped/acknowledged him ( mythopoeia ) . 
  still , all this works retroactively , so , like mojo said , it does n't really matter , since he always was the way he is now , and not . 
  from the song of pelinal , volume 5 : on his love of morihaus :, 
   it is famous , though , that the two talked of each other as family , with morihaus as the lesser , and that pelinal loved him and called him nephew , but these could be merely the fancies of immortals . 
  the thing with the heroes in tes games is that they are a blank slate . 
  we know the eternal champion was active in the cyrodiilic court , we know the agent was employed by the blades , we know the nerevarine was nerevar reincarnate , we know the champion of cyrodiil was , well , involved in the oblivion crisis , and we know the last dragonborn was a dragonborn . 
  other than that , there is nothing written down on the characters ( hell , the nerevarine prophecy requires that there is nothing known of the background of the nerevarine ) . 
  they might be related , or not . 
  if you like them to be related , make a nice background story tying it all together , or if you do n't , they are n't related at all . 
  ** continents , time , and kalpas **, 
  there have n't been any clear answers on this subject , so most is conjecture . 
  the continents can be aligned on two axes , one , going north to south , giving an anuic-padomaic axis , and the other one , going west to east , giving a past-future axis . 
  in both cases , tamriel is the centre , as it is the centre of the universe . 
  the first axis is easier to explain . 
  atmora is frozen because it is pure anuic . 
  any form of progress is impossible , as it is fixed in place . 
  its inhabitants , the atmorans ( ancestors of the nords ) left in order to be able to make progress . 
  aldmeris , on the other hand , is pure padomaic . 
  it does not exist in the traditional sense because it is ever changing . 
  its inhabitants , the aldmer ( ancestors of the elven races , although the khajiit and bosmer might have remained on tamriel ) left in order to have some stability necessary for civilisation . 
  both groups ended up on tamriel , the arena . 
  the past-future axis is a bit more problematic . 
  there has n't really been any major accepted theory on how this works , as far as i know , but yokuda and akavir are basically different kalpas . 
  it was once remarked that tosh-raka might be a flower-child , the first thing born from the amaranth , but i have n't looked into this thing much . 
  you are right in stating that kalpas exist in a dream , and a new dream is not the same as a new kalpa . 
  a kalpa runs from convention , when the aedra got together to punish lorkhan and the start of linear time , to the point at which alduin eats the world . 
  as such , each kalpa is supposed to start with lorkhan 's death at the hands of trinimac and auri-el . 
  however , mythopoeia might make this a bit more problematic . 
  since the aedra are severely damaged and weakened by creation and convention , they are reliant on the worship of mortals to survive . 
  this has the side effect that believe shapes the gods . 
  this is why there are all sorts of variations of the aedra , and why a false interpretation of a divine is virtually impossible , since every interpretation is truth . 
  i do n't exactly know the origin of the dreughs , so i ca n't help you on that . 
  still , the hists are from a completely different dream , and they are n't exactly gods either ( although probably as dangerous ) . 
  this kalpa will probably last for a bit longer than alduin intended . 
  kinmune is the text set the farthest in the future , dealing with the ninth era . 
  still , i doubt alduin is truly dead . 
  the fact that this kalpa lasts so much longer does mean that there is more space for an amaranth to step up , continuing existence . 
  ** planes of existence **, 
  mundus is only nirn , the moons , and the aedric bodies .
