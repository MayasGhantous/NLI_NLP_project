  congratulations with your second day free . 
  i heard a lot of people express their gladness with stopping . 
  currently i 'm supporting a friend trying to get off speed . 
  it went well for a while , but after he broke up with his girlfriend , he has relapsed a bit . 
  me and another friend are now mostly just trying to keep it from becoming a daily thing he does alone . 
  it pretty heavy to see that stuff happen to people around you . 
  i do n't know breton , but i am studying old irish and middle welsh , so i might be able to help you with the related languages . 
  i also have a study book on modern welsh laying around somewhere . 
  i 'll never learn that one by heart , but i do now the layout of goi by heart now . 
  how sounds exactly slip into languages is n't really clear . 
  most of the introduced sounds seem to only differ slightly in pronunciation , like how / \u00f0 / or / \u00fe / is the fricative form of / t / or / d / , which you would find in roughly the same place in english as in dutch or german , respectively . 
  in this case , it is roughly the same as / l / , but then a fricative instead of a liquid . 
  as to its origins : / \u026c / is a development of geminated / ll / or / lt / ( which kind of makes sense if you try pronouncing it ) . 
  common british geminated word-initial / l / , and other cases were either already in proto-celtic or were the result of other developments . 
  in irish , it would correspond to / l\u032a\u02e0 / or / l\u0320\u02b2 / ( depending on quality ) , which is a lot more similar to / l / , and as such is n't as present or absent from most dialects . 
  in writing , it also corresponds to < ll  , except when word-initial . 
  i do n't know how the other languages do it , though . 
  there is nothing wrong with feeling bad abut being rejected . 
  it hurts like a bitch , and i know i felt down about it for a few months the last time . 
  it is ( most of the times ) not ok to be angry about it , though . 
  a girl does n't have to be attracted to you just because you 're nice to her , and platonic relationships with someone of the other sex is a pretty normal thing . 
  besides , there is a difference between being nice and flirting . 
  the voicing of `` g '' is disappearing from dutch , though . 
  in the northern dialects ( the ones `` above the rivers '' ) there is no distinction between `` g '' and `` ch '' , with the exact pronunciation differing between dialects . 
  in the western dialect it 's mostly a voiceless uvular fricative nowadays . 
  in the southern dialects the distinction is still present , though . 
  you could argue that the initial consonant mutations in the modern celtic languages are an example of that . 
  to start with , it is important to understand that phonemes in a word can influence the way other phonemes are pronounced . 
  this is something that is common to ( as far as i know ) all languages , but often does n't serve a grammatical function . 
  a good example of this is the english sentence * what is it ? 
  * while the final consonant of * what * would be realised by most speakers as / t / in isolation , but as a / d / in the above sentence . 
  because the consonant is flanked by two vowels , it becomes more vowel-like , in this case taking voicing . 
  this process is called lenition ( when discussing the celtic languages , mutation is often used , to avoid confusion with the name for one of the mutation forms common to them ) . 
  this also happened in the celtic languages . 
  the exact process differs per language , but the [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/consonant_mutation#celtic_languages ) has a brief overview . 
  initially this would be mostly a phonetic thing , similar to the example of english above . 
  the insular celtic languages , however , eventually all experienced apocope , which is the dropping of final phonemes or , as in this case , final syllables . 
  often , these contained the gender and case markers . 
  the mutations remained , though , and in the modern languages this still is often the only way to distinguish between gender and case . 
  an example of this is the 3rd person possessive pronoun in welsh . 
  * ei * can mean `` his '' or `` her '' . 
  in this case , the mutation distinguishes them : * ei thad * `` her father '' , making / t / / \u03b8 / ( aspirate mutation ) . 
  * ei dad * `` his father '' , making / t / / d / ( soft mutation ) . 
  mutations are disappearing nowadays , though , most likely due to most speakers speaking the celtic languages as second language . 
  the ghost already went through europe and the rest of the world . 
  now it 's america 's turn . 
  long overdue , if you ask me . 
  he had already died inside the moment he came out the womb . 
  i think ` kudde ' is the right word . 
  it 's not as if they had that many to start with . 
  i have a feeling that will turn out to be another arg, 
  they both have seven phonemes . 
  even though / \u014b / and / \u03b8 / are spelled with two letters ( ng and th ) they only represent a single phoneme . 
  if you want to make the argument of 10-20 vowels in english , you would first need to differentiate between spelling and pronunciation . 
  when discussing english , this is n't that hard , since english spelling is all over the place . 
  this is partially due to english using the latin alphabet . 
  while this writong system was good enough for latin , english uses a vastly different phonology , which is n't easy to put down in latin symbols . 
  you see a similar situation in other western germanic languages : dutch ( often , but not always ) uses vowel duplication in writing to express different vowels , and german uses an umlaut for this purpose . 
  the arguement might become clearer to the other person if you make this distinction . 
  [ wiktionary has a collection of some swadesh lists ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/appendix:swadesh_lists ) . 
  these only contain basic vocabulary , though , so these wo n't help when when looking for all but the most common and basic words . 
  depends a bit on what method you are using . 
  the most used method ( and the standard go to ) is the comparative method . 
  you take a set of words from the different languages and you compare them . 
  there is a preference for basic vocabulary ( like cardinal numbers up to ten , words for close family , common verbs , etc. 
  ) , since these seem to be less prone to borrowing , although there are exceptions . 
  the comparative method is the most accurate with families that have either a good documentation ( phonemic scripts help a lot ) , or many members . 
  this is one reason why we know a lot more about indo-european or afro-asiatic ( mostly semitic ) than about the families in america . 
  when you lack other languages to compare your language to , internal reconstruction can be used . 
  this is looking at patterns in phonology ( for instance , some verbs are slightly changing the stem when followed by certain inflexion , which other verbs do n't do ) , and trying to explain the irregularity . 
  the comparative method is definitely more accurate than internal reconstruction , so there is more certainty about proto-indo-european than , say , proto-basque . 
  you also ca n't put a absolute timing on the form . 
  you know which development took place before which , but not when it exactly happened . 
  languages do n't change at a constant pace , and some changes are more intrusive than others . 
  borrowing can also make matters more complicated . 
  there is also a limit on how far you can go . 
  reconstructing a language is basically very educated guesswork . 
  you know that two sounds have a common ancestor and you know what is a logical direction for a sound to change in . 
  this is more accurate than it sounds , so we have a fairly accurate guess as to what a language spoken ten thousand years ago might sound like , but the further back you go , the more room for error there is . 
  i 've heard anything from twenty to eighty thousand years ago . 
  this is why there is of yet no accepted reconstruction of proto-afroasiatic , since it should have broken apart earlier than that . 
  the biggest problem would be the exact grammar , syntax especially . 
  while morphology and semantics leave traces in languages , syntax is not ( always ) phonological in nature . 
  many historical linguists say that proto-indo-european was a sov language , which is solidly based on the earliest attestations of indo-european languages . 
  since the structure might have been borrowed from neighbouring languages ( like akkadian , sumerian and the dravidian languages ) , and observed changes in word order have n't left many traces , there is still a debate about the original word order . 
  actually , historical linguists use those kind of words ( called basic vocabulary ) a lot when comparing languages . 
  i 'm on mobile , so i ca n't link , but wiktionary has a couple of swadesh lists , which are made up of those basic words . 
  languages borrow a lot from other languages , but the most used and common words are n't adopted so easily by speakers of another language . 
  this also means that related languages ( often ) still have related words for the same or similar concept . 
  the celtic languages introduced initial consonant mutation ( a change in the realisation of the first consonant of a word , to indicate things like gender , number and case of the preceding word ) . 
  it should be said that according to current models this is due to the phonological dropping of final syllables , which often contained inflectional suffixes . 
  old irish also innovated on the verb system . 
  you can fill an entire library on the verb in old irish , but to give a simple ( and very simplified ) example : for every one person , number , tense and mode , you have four different verb forms , depending on sentence structure . 
  this does not seem to have been a part of pie grammar . 
  also , languages do borrow grammar from other languages . 
  a good example is irish english , which uses certain constructions not allowed in other forms of english , but available in irish gaelic . 
  examples are the so-called `` after perfect '' ( ` he was after hitting me . 
  '' , i.e. 
  `` he just hit me '' ) , and the use of reflexive pronouns for emphasis . 
  a good book about borrowing and the influence of languages on other languages is `` language contact , creolization , and genetic linguistics '' by sarah grey thomason and terrence kaufman .
