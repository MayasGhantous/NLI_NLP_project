  you 're bringing back great memories . 
  i played that game as long as my gameboy advance battery would let me . 
  the 50 . cal machineguns are great , i totally agree with that but saying that the german cannons are n't . 
  well ... 
  i could n't disagree more with you . 
  it 's true that the cannons on the fw-190 a-1 lack rof but that is due to the drum-fed mg/ff firing mechanism . 
  this means you have to fiddle around with your convergence . 
  also note that the a-1 has 4x 7.7 mm mg 's . 
  load those with the tracer belt and use stealth or armoured belt for the cannons . 
  fire your 4 mg 's at 700m and only shoot your cannons at the same distance as your gun convergence . 
  the true power of the bf 109 f-4 are it 's cannon bipods and it 's great climbing rate . 
  use any belt you like on the mg 's but i insist on using stealth belt for the cannons . 
  because the mg151 20mm cannons are belt-fed means they have a higher rof over the mg/ff drum-fed cannons on the a-1 . 
  if you are going head on with another enemy fighter in the bf 109 f-4 just shoot a 3sec burst at 1.2 km out and it will burst into flames . 
  germans fighters take some skill to fly and use succesfully in combat , no matter what gamemode . 
  know your strengths and weaknesses and use them to your advantage .

  that subreddit is 1 year old but still has n't mentioned in the sidebar by the / r/hardstyle moderators . 
  ( you are one f them / u/guy _ from_sweden ), 
  maybe it 's time to put a link in the sidebar to that subreddit . 
  it is related to what we all love on this subreddit , and that is hardstyle .

  [ this will answer your questions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_focke-wulf_fw_190_variants ), 
  for the 20mm cannon i suggest you use the ground target belt for fighter to fighter combat but it works pretty good on bombers as well because it can seriously damage flight controls . 
  for the berezin ub 12.7 mm i suggest you use the ground target belt because it ap-i , api-t and ap-i ( c ) . 
  it 's the same as the us ground target belt but then russian , so it 's almost an instant win but the us belt delivers more freedom . 
  they did actually .

  [ aircraft carrier class named * jade * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jade-class_aircraft_carrier ), 
  flair your post , but i suppose you are talking about rb . 
  it 's the same as shooting of a wing of an enemy aircraft and getting the message `` critical hit '' instead of `` player-x has killed player-y '', 
  wait for it when you have the fw 190 a-5 / u-2 fully upgraded . 
  the 6x 20mm mg151 cannons wrecks anthing in it 's path . 
  the fw 190 a-5 is a sweet plane indeed . 
  ah okay , now i fully understand your point . 
  missing 1/3 of a wing is indeed reasonable enough to make it back to the base . 
  it would be great if gaijin could implement this into the fm of all the planes . 
  it would take an awful lot o work but in the end it would add more gameplay value to the game . 
  you 're not used to firing so much freedom per second . 
  the only thing i hate is the hit detection of the 37mm gun . 
  does n't matter what belt you choose . . it just sparks and does nothing unless when you spamming it at less than 500m untill it overheats . 
  a 37mm hei-t round should wreck any plane with one shot due to the shockwave and shrapnel if not heavily damage it . 
  do n't even get me started on the ap-t round because the penetrational values are shite . 
  it 's not like bombers and planes are that heavily armoured , apart from the russian stalinwood fighter yak and the us freedom bomber b-17 . 
  yes , and i do n't think it 's very honourable . 
  i have tried it but without any succes from my part . 
  the all api-t tracer belt is not very good from my point of view because in ab you hardly get any engine fires at all . 
  you might think that the incendiary part of the round would make it easier to light engines on fire and light up fueltanks . 
  combine this with the added tracer effect that the bullet has and it should be fine . 
  but for some season it does nothing at all apart from shining very pretty in the sky . 
  [ psyko punkz - beyond belief ( reverze 2012 anthem ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9tyxl7ou9g ),

  you are afraid of flying but yet you fly 10.500 km ( 6500 miles ) to taiwan and then back to the us again ?!, 
  i would like to show how much respect i have for you at the moment . 
  it takes some serious balls to sit in a airplane for 12 hours long from my point of view if you have fear of flying . 
  hopefully your flight back to the us goes well . 
  i do n't think it 's weird to be banned if you have such nickname . 
  your next name should be xxxnanshagger69xxx, 
  bnz is a legitimate tactic , and not having an advantage over the other player does n't make you win . 
  just a ragepost from some random player . 
  i 'm sorry for posting a serious comment to the reaction that the bf player . 
  is that worth the downvoting when somebody attempts to discuss something ? 
  sure , he can take a 30mm to the arm and keep on flying like nothing happend . 
  much freedom, 
  those 4x 50 . cal wreck anything in their path . 
  got ta love those mg151 cannons < 3, 
  the kicks are kinda '' ` meh '' from what i 'm used to when listening to frontliner . 
  but apart from that it 's a nice track nonetheless . 
  back in the days inqontrol was one of my most memorable experiences with any hardstyle festival . 
  too bad they stopped in 2010 . 
  headhunterz - from within, 
  if you look at the two 800kg bombs that the ki-49 can mount you will see that you have an sap ad he bomb . 
  i can only guess that the sap ( semi armour piercing ? ), 
  is good for naval targets and the he bomb for ground units and basses . 
  it will fight against mig-15 's for sure because ; `` da comrade , look in great soviet history book '', 
  you should try the bf 109 f-2 , it can carry 8 rockets . 
  now all you do is feed on the tears of b-17 pilots . 
  soundcloud is more widely used by artist . 
  even though it has never been officially released videos of this track had been removed due to copyright strikes .
