  sounds alot like frontliner - spacer, 
  [ soulrage - deception ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-5tsmie4ow ), 
  this track never gets old . 
  it 's a great track , i love it but there are always some improvements to be made . 
  like some other people said , the hard fade is a little weird , i do n't mind the somewhat mild kick though . 
  i just turn up my bass controller and volume for that . 
  definitely my favourite track to just lay back and start humming along to the melody . 
  [ dash berlin - till the sky falls down ( isaac remix ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi2ah9fkwnw ), 
  what was the most memorable moment in your carreer of how fans showed you their appreciation for being their favourite artist ? 
  awesome to see that adaro has returned !, 
  i 'm excited to see his new tracks and collabs like mentioned in this article . 
  it 's kinda akward to hear that kick with the buzzing sound in it . 
  i like the intro very much though and up untill 2:05 i was loving it , but from my point of view of what i mentioned earlier that is kind of weird . 
  anyway , i think it 's a great track after all . 
  unlike the us 12.7 's which relies on kinetic energy , the breda 12.7 's rely on chemical energy to do damage . 
  it can pen tanks because the 15mm mg151 cannon uses ap-i ( c ) . 
  that 's ap-i with a cermet core . 
  you just ca n't take out heavy tanks with it . . at least i have n't tried yet . 
  just had an eargasm . 
  i 'm gon na test that out when i 'm back from work . 
  bioweapon consisted of audiofreq and code black . 
  btw [ audiofreq - lose control 2.0 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fihojtbwyo4 ), 
  sounds very promising , i 'm looking forward to the release of his new collab with b-front . 
  it 's a hardcore remix , people like different things . 
  never heard of them before , i will check out their other songs for sure . 
  that 's what this subreddit is for , to share hardstyle music . 
  my ears . . ca n't . . handle . . the . . 
  raw !, 
  it just makes my day when you finally find the track that you heard somewhere and you never knew the artist or the track name of it . 
  i searched so long for this track , thx for sharing !, 
  the regular h-111 is a brick to fly , can you only imagine what it was to fly the h-111z ? 
  i like the kick alot , reminds me of early hardstyle . 
  the melody sounds familiar , i have heard it before but i ca n't remember the track name nor artist . 
  i like it alot , keep up the good work !, 
  [ made a gifsound for this ] ( http://gifsound.com/?gif=i.imgur.com/633zoi4.gif&amp;v=y8zzg4n8cpm&amp;s=10 ), 
  he will , on stage blue . 
  edit : spelling, 
  i 've seen a post somwhere on the harderstate forums that suggests that arjan has signed a contract with protocol recordings . 
  i 'd like to listen to a new track of arjan . . when it comes out , who knows ? 
  [ harderstate forum rumor topic ] ( http://harderstate.com/other-music-f67/anything-new-by-arjan-terpstra-t28082.html ), 
  i mean ... who reads the terms of service anyway ? 
  i dind ' t look close enough to your first post , i think i had a brainfart or something . 
   `` hope fully he plays it at defqon this weekend '', 
  i thought you asked if he would be on defqon .1 australia 2014 . 
  it 's actually about buying music , but to be fair spotify has a motherload of hardstyle tracks . 
  i personally do n't like commercials to interrupt my music listening experience so it 's worth it buying spotify premium . 
  i did some research and it must be an unreleased track . 
  according to ** [ this ] ( http://lsdb.nl/set/134186/atmozfears-emporium-2013-25-05-13.html ) ** source it has to be track # 6 , which is n't identified . 
  top of the world seems to get the closest imo . 
  13mm 's are inneffective due to the broken bullets it fires . 
  the mg131 fires rounds that rely on chemical energy rather than kinetic energy like the american 12.7 mm . 
  same goes for the italian breda 12.7 mm and japanese ho-103 which are actually the same mg 's and fire the same chemical rounds . 
  do you even lift ? 
  `` best '' is a big term to use . 
  it really depends on what you preffer yourself . 
  sounds good , the melody is kinda catchy . 
  they only slight issue is that it sounds a bit hollow to me . 
  / r/warthundercirclejerk, 
  these older documantaries are so much better than the `` history '' channel produced trash . 
  i very much enjoy watching these . 
  [ agenda met lan-parties ] ( http://www.lanpartykalender.nl/index.php/agenda#date=2014-09-27,mode=year ), 
  did n't sea that one coming . 
  i preffer the ar-2 anyday because of stronk lelinglass and stalinwood . 
  ju-88 is definitly my 2nd choice . 
  if i would be able to travel back to 2007 , i would stay there untill the end of time . 
  i like hardstyle in it 's current shape and form but i personally like older tracks ( pre-2009 ) . 
  just to give an example of what i 'm trying to say ; no matter what current top of the charts track you choose [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxja0zlkcgy ) track from the prophet & zany called nothing else matters from 2007 just blows it away . 
  day 13 : they are starting to accept me as one of them, 
   12.7 mm m2 browning machine guns do minimal to no damage when coming into contact with other planes, 
  the german ( 13mm ) , italian and japanese 12.7 's would like a word with you, 
  to be honest i think a dj set of just 10min is too short for any music genre , but hey i made you a list anyway . 
  [ noisecontrollers - so high ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxwss4zqqt8 ), 
  [ bass modulators - the same frequence ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpefixxtxvq ),

  [ frontliner - summer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aibsg26wfsq ), 
  i chose for a more energetic line-up of hardstyle tracks get the most out of a 10min session . 
  well hopefully it all works out for you . 
  no stronk stalinwood ? 
  i must say , you have made alot of progress since you started posting here on / r/hardstyle . 
  keep it up !, 
  i think it 's a great track nonetheless . 
  the browning m2 universel belt has more incediary capabilities than the italian and japanese 12.7 's firing their tracer belts which consist of nothing but api-t . 
  [ but that 's none of my business ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nnu4lpf.gif ), 
  i know what i said above here was just a whining comment i made but to be honest the browning m2 's are great for setting anything on fire . 
  i love the full api-t tracer belt for the p-47 and p-51 , just a wall of freedom tracers coming to get you . 
  i 'm looking forward to his new album , sounds promising . 
  * the first kick sounds good , but it 's not harsh from my point of view . 
  maybe that 's because i listen to hardcore music as well . 
  it is at least hard . 
  * the second kick has a really nice deep bass sound which i absolutely love . 
  pretty harsh if you ask me . 
  more like a hardcore kick to be honest . 
  * the third kick from my point of view is definitly harsh but at the same time sounds and feels a bit hollow . 
  sounds nice nonetheless . 
  i 'm not a music producer myself but these are just my remarks as your `` average joe '' listener . 
  i 'm glad i could help you , best of luck with your future productions . 
  release is on 27th october , confirmed by noisecontrollers . 
  [ sauce ] ( https://twitter.com/noisecontroller/status/521663004967190529 ), 
  who cares , in the end it 's all hardstyle .
