  aw yea !, 
  / u/audiofrq is one of the hosts !, 
  this is going to be an awesome weekend , just listening to q-dance radio all day long !, 
  [ this man ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h--iu49ajtq ) is a legend !, 
  using windows live movie maker hampers the video quality and the same goes for not using the optimal file extension . 
  danouh has really nice energetic tracks , i like his track [ orion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf6jhcogwig ) the most . 
  hopefully that specific part is on the original mix when the track is fully released . 
  sounds more like a radio edit to me this one . 
  edit : the original song is 6:03 long  [ spotify almbum link ] ( https://play.spotify.com/album/7otrulyvecq1p2es5j10it ), 
   say they topped smack !, 
  now i 'm interested , bring it on . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omguez7jy5e ), 
  i can understand why the sterotypical image of the netherlands is used in this video for publicity reasons but it 's just not right . 
  this image has been around for too many years and it had to change and show how we , the dutch , really are . 
  the video that is linked to this post does n't give a sneak peak to the videos to come but shows the sterotypical picture . 
  tl : dr i want people to know what real dutch culture is . 
  ( no tulip growing , clog wearing , weed smoking , prostitute shagging , liberalist thingy ), 
  how much more streaming services do we need ? 
  there are like a ton of them allready in existence . 
  the plane itself is fantastic , i like it alot but the problem is that the ho-103 mg 's is broken . 
  i fly out my zero 's to grind out the ki-84 , it 's a paper plane but the cannons actually work now . 
  zatox does n't even have the same style as audiofreq , so how is that relevant ? 
  oh man that melody , i 'm loving it !, 
  please deliver to me ? 
  i had the feeling that my eardrums were about to rip due to the amount of bass , and i loved it !, 
  as a f9f panther pilot i can confirm , i learned the hard way . 
  / r/warthundermemes would like this, 
  if you 're trying to fly the zero 's at high speed then you are doing it wrong . 
  i have mate installed now and it 's working great . 
  i still have to get used to my new os but that 's just a matter of time . 
  thanks for your advice !, 
  i dind ' t really like xfce when i tried it on the liveusb . 
  i also went to upgrade my ram by adding another 2gb and afterwards installed mate . 
  thanks for your advice !, 
  i have gone with mate because cinnamon and xfce dind ' t really fit my needs when i tried them on a liveusb . 
  thanks for the advice !, 
  i meant during combat , i forgot to mention that . 
  and i 'm just sitting here 7 years later and still not knowing who black identity was at sensation black 2007 :(, 
  10/10 - ign `` would bang '', 
  this is straight from the war thunder support article regarding accidently buying a module :, 
  `` unfortunately , we are unable to reverse an accidental plane 's module purchase '', 
  i tried it anyway and hope for some luck but i dind ' t get refunded anyway . 
  flying at low speed at low altitude near a destroyer : do you even hit bro ? 
  flying at high speed at high altitude 2km away from a destroyer : insta-kill, 
  some might call it russian bias , but gaijin calls it logic, 
  definitely my favourite of all the hardstyle remixes . 
  [ veracocha - carte blanche ( toneshifterz remix ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejtqh5eqxuq ), 
  i have my own playlist containing , as of now , 1845 tracks with a duration of 152 hours and 26 minutes . 
  spotify has a a motherload of hardstyle tracks , it 's definitely worth trying . 
  as you can see in my post it says jumpstyle but it 's supposed to be tekstyle . 
  spotify can be weird in a way, 
  that is because of the longer nose , i made the same mistakes but after reading some articles about it you will understand why . 
  looks refreshing , something new . 
  i very much like the new design . 
  i want 144i because it 's more cinematic . 
  to the commander and gunner of the pz.iv i say , rip in pieces, 
  showtek realy gets a party started anytime of the day no matter where in the world that might be . 
  * west on the eastern front, 
  i like the track very much but the picture of the youtube video though ... dafuq, 
  he sure loves touching the same knobs and sliders over and over again . 
  i have the beyerdynamic dt770 's and these perform outstanding . 
  the bass is a bit lifted but not overpowering . 
  mids are ` okay ' for audiophile standards but are certainly not bad at all . 
  high 's are nice and clean , nothing wrong with it . 
  this audiophile headphone works best with an amplifier but works fine as well on just a 3.5 mm input but you might wan na go for the 32-80 ohm version then . 
  you can compare audiographs between certain headphones on [ this website ] ( http://www.headphone.com/pages/build-a-graph ), 
  have you tried shops like zeeman , hema and wibra ? 
  i think their sizes go up to 46 but if you stretch them a bit i will be sure they fit just fine . 
  tl ; dr : you have to listen to it to feel the music, 
  i consider euphoric and melodic to be pretty much the same , i mean it makes me feel good and makes me happy . 
  some nice melodies , vocals and a climax to finish it all off . 
  some people do n't like vocals but hey , people like different things . 
  as for raw , well the name says it all . . it 's raw . 
  screeches , hard kicks and bass . 
  but raw can also be kinda euphoric , take for example [ e-force & frequencerz - men of steel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svuzlez7ztk ), 
  many people also seen to forget about a dubstyle which uses elements of dubstep music which is not too bad actually . 
  whatever floats your boat really , but it 's certainly worth giving that a try as well . 
  the 80 ohms is preffered if you have a powerfull enough soundcard that can power it or have an amplifier because otherwise the full soundstage wo n't be made use of . 
  i 'm not an expert really on amps , you should try visiting / r/headphones and / r/audiophile for some more information if you are interested in the 80 ohm version . 
  since when does it matter where an artist is from ? 
  [ `` it 's all about the music and it always has been '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tyh2cnelow#t=141 ), 
  i found the `` mystery '' as they call it . 
  i 'm not sharing what i found , all i can say is that it is very well hidden and you should pay very close attention to what the riddle says . 
  browsing spotify artists , albums and playlists . 
  you have to admit it though , it 's freaking brutal . 
  i have , yes and tbh i kinda enjoy it . 
  i like everything really from euphoric all the way to speedcore . 
  * ( apart from terrorcore ) *, 
  frenchcore is n't all that bad really . 
  most international flights come in at schiphol airport near amsterdam . 
  zestienhoven ( rotterdm/the hague airport ) near rotterdam is becoming fairly popular with european flights because it 's not as crowded as schiphol, 
  it 's german and from ww2 , has to be nazi . 
  [ henk westbroek - zelfs je naam is mooi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-onejhdh_h8 ), 
  it 's great to listen to the progress that frontliner has made during those years as a producer . 
  it 's like going back into a timemachine , and i love it . 
  call 0-800-murica within the first 15 minutes and we 'll throw in an eagle freedom bumper sticker for free !, 
  hello / r/sweden ,, 
  what do you think is the most interesting thing about our country compared to yours ? 
  euthanasia is a great solution for people who , for example , do n't want to live anymore because everyday they endure horrific amounts of pain or depressions . 
  people have different reason for requesting euthanasia but these are some examples .
