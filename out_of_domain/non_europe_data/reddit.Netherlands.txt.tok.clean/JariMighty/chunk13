  i do think the procedure should be less bureaucratic and but it should n't be like `` here 's the syringe and go your way '', 
  since late november 2013 everything has been quiet about arjan . 
  oh man , ca n't wait for the album !, 
  aboutaleb for president !, 
  even though deadmau5 dind ' t write it him self it 's kinda ironic if he did actually wrote this looking back on the circlejerk he created about wildstylez using ` his ' track for the inspiration of ` straightforward ' . 
  doet me denken aan [ deze ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_lcfltnopa ), 
  no idea what he 's up to . 
  he does have instagram but there 's not alot of information on it if he 's still producing music . 
  probeer eens het youtube kanaal van [ vice ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/vice/videos ) en [ vice news ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/vicenews/videos ) daar ben je echt uren zoet mee . 
  i will try it out as soon as i come home today . 
  thank you for your fast response !, 
  the melody sounds the same indeed but you barely notice it unless you really focus on it . 
  edit :, 
  i have the same thing with [ brennan heart - alternate reality ( qlimax 2010 anthem ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2pavrg02_e ) around 2:50, 
  which i think sounds very simular to [ brennan heart - face the enemy ( zany remix ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-utwtjsqwc ) around 1:40, 
  i would like to see the source on where you found those comments about alternate.nl because i have a great experience with them . 
  but if you really do want an alternative i have some links for you :, 
  i 'm sure there are other stores around but these are the ones that i know of . 
  that 's what i thought . 
  thanks anyway for the reply . 
  borrowing it without asking . 
  he picked some good tracks to mix with . . if he was an actual dj . 
  ca n't be mad at him for aleast trying though , i mean being a dj is something that takes patience and alot time to perfect instead of turning on some knobs on a deck . 
  [ * reference here * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh9c7nqhmii ), 
  * ~ ~ verontreiniging/besmetting ~ ~, 
  these are usually allready sold out because alot if people have the same idea . 
  this is not what i expected of wildstylez at all , but i quite like it though . 
  a couple of suggestions/questions :, 
  * can you get into the bios menu ? 
  * have you tried removing the battery and pluging it in directly into a power socket ? 
  * have you tried bleeding out the system of it 's power ? 
  * ( holding down the power button for ~ 2min ) *, 
  it can indicate that a certain hardware component has broken down or it can also be the cmos battery . 
  have you allready tried only booting up with the essential parts of the computer ? 
  only cpu , ram , hdd and psu and see if it boots up ? 
  i do n't think it 's a problem with the hdd but i think it has something to do with the ram modules because it wo n't load propperly as shown in the pictures . 
  i suggest scanning the ram modules with a memory diagnostics tool . 
  please do . 
  from my point of the artists make the genre what it is . 
  with new elements being introduced by artists the genre evolves . 
  i 'm not sceptical about the future of hardstyle at all because the genre has alot of quality artists that will help keep the it alive . 
  there 's [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3rf2rpi.jpg ) as well if you do n't have gold . 
  [ bomfunk mc 's - freestyler ( sexy simo hardstyle bootleg ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhdfq-dqxek ), 
  it 's hard to find any tracks from mandy or man-d as she likes to call herself . 
  and the tracks i do find by searching on he facebook profile are cheesy as hell . 
  allright then , she 's not a producer but maybe she 's a dj then ? 
  [ because pusing the play button takes serious skill , right ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxhaputdqus ) i mean she can turn on my knob if she wants to . 
  [ look up the new purple mix of defqon .1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plqjto2fjghkxahamzwipe4axzalyecvmj ) , all the other mixes use atleast 1 or more tracks of the artist which has made that mix and yet she does n't . 
  coincidende maybe ? 
  i think not . 
  if people disagree with me then please reply to this and explain why because i value artist that have made a name for themselves rather than just looking good and turning the same knobs over and over again . 
  i working overtime so i think it will be a kapsalon at rotterdam central station for me . 
  konak is what it 's called , right ? 
  i do n't come there as often but it 's a nice place . 
  do n't get to high on the expectations . 
  * europa europa * ( 1990 ) *, 
  `` mandy - tba ... said nobody ever '', 
  definitely a yes if you ask me . 
  my two favourites . 
  * defqon .1 2010 nl - [ wildstylez - no time to waste ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tionbsmbp0m ), 
  * defqon .1 2009 au - [ zany - maximum force ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba-fkwgt5uy ), 
  this is great man , you should have filmed the crowd during this set . 
  i 'd love to see their reactions on it . 
  sounds like a track that should have been released under the alias ` pavelow ' . 
  using emma watson as clickbait . 
  most of the people click on that video because of the thumbnail and most of the time do n't even pay attention to the title . 
  edit : spelling, 
  some people call it noise cause they do n't understand it . 
  the anthem of sensation black got me into hardstyle . 
  i heard it once on a call of duty united offensive montage video and i was sold ... for life . 
  hey wildsylez ,, 
  what other music genres do you enjoy listening to other than hardstyle ? 
  so many good remixes have never been released , such a shame really . 
  these kind of tracks want to make me dance all day . 
  japanese rb player here , can confirm that . 
  by not working at all . 
  hard driver - bass drops, 
  hard driver - exploration ( hard bass 2014 anthem ), 
  wild motherfuckers - natural born raver, 
  blademasterz - still here, 
  cash cash feat . 
  bebe rexha -- take me home ( wasted penguinz remix ), 
  i know it but i ca n't remember the trackname !, 
  audiotricz - united as one ( wish outdoor anthem 2015 ), 
  bass modulators - let me see ya hands up ( remix maybe ? ), 
  profyler & digital punk - bring back the funk ( zatox remix ), 
  adaro - my soul to take, 
  aerosmith - dream on ( sampled text only though ), 
  zazafront & sjaak of sound ft feestmc peerke -- big fat bass record, 
  delete - level ? 
  noisecontrollers - so high, 
  i know it but i ca n't remember the title !, 
  chain reaction - answers ( adaro remix ), 
  do you remember who was playing that evening ? 
  sounds like radical redemption to me . 
  however i did find a prophet remix that sounds the same but does n't have the enhanced bass . 
  [ marshall masters - i like it loud ( the prohet 2011 refixx ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc8effyu5ou ), 
  as i fly the a6m zero the mg 's are pure harrasing fire to make them dodge the shots and lose speed or force them into a turn . 
  the cannons are there for the killing blow in a turn or if you have a really good posistion on your enemy .
