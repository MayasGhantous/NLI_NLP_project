  talking about mg 's the 13.2 mm on the a6m5 otsu is really effective , i would say pretty much on par with the m2 50 . cal . 
  shame though it only has about 200 rounds ;(, 
  what a cracking liveset !, 
  dind ' t atmozfears work with this track as well ? 
  sound travels around 333 m/s, 
  count the seconds from when you see the flash untill you hear the sound of the explosions . 
  this is around 6 seconds . 
  divide 6 by 3 and you will get 2km, 
  2km is around 1.4 miles, 
  edit : i said `` around '' for a reason so that the rough distance could be measured . 
  too bad it was n't the anthem but still one hell of a track !, 
  not really a ` hardstyle ' wallpaper but i thought it was nice . 
  i ca n't recall the exact source for it though . 
  it 's so hard because there are so many sounds representing hardstyle that it 's just impossible for me to make a reasonable choice . 
  i ca n't find the blademasterz liveset but brennan heart did play the track ` still here ' in his own liveset . 
  [ decibel '15 liveset - brennan heart ( track begins at 11:11 ) ] ( https://soundcloud.com/edm_liveset/brennan-heart-live-decibel-outdoor-2015-beekse-bergen-holland ), 
  nsclt stole from noisecult ^ / s, 
  avondrood is water in de sloot, 
  melody sounds a whole lot like brennan heart - wide awake . 
  one of my favourite remixes from isaac . 
  [ dash berlin - till the sky falls down ( isaac remix ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi2ah9fkwnw ), 
  and my # 1 remix :, 
  [ brooklyn bounce - club bizarre ( headhunterz & noisecontrollers remix ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvna45hahu8 ), 
  this picture puts a smile on my face . 
  you can also see 3 other cloaked `` artists ? '', 
  around 0:41 . 
  rs : flamethrower, 
  if so the vietcong is so screwed . 
  the netcode of ro2 can be glitchy at some times . 
  to me it mostly happens because i join a server with 200 + ping without paying attention to it in the server list . 
  my favourite games are :, 
  killing floor , killing floor 2 , red orchestra 2/rising storm and garry 's mod . 
  this used to be a mod for the game blitzkrieg if i remember it correctly . 
  never knew it was available on steam , this is going on my wishlist for sure !, 
  personally , i love the sound of the harder styles and ca n't get enough of it but a tattoo may be a tad too far imho . 
  however i 'd go with just `` live the moment '' , that song is just damn good . 
  `` ghello there tovarisch , do yuo have of moment to talk about stalina our supreme leader and savior ? '', 
  i had the same issue but lucky for you rs is on sale till the the 26nd of october . 
  it 's a bargain at the moment . 
  this remembers me of the original red orchestra . 
  laying prone on a motorcyle with a panzerfaust and blowing the enemy tanks up at max speed . 
  good times , 
  when you have replaced the cpu , you will have to reinstall the operating system . 
  this also goes for ram modules and motherboards . 
  these 3 components are the ` base ' of your config . 
  things like gpu , hdd , odd and psu can be changed without having it affect on the os . 
  whenever i show a hardstyle track to somebody outside the netherlands they always say it 's very `` upbeat '' . 
  as a fan of hardstyle i don ' t know if i should take this as an insult or compliment : /, 
  ( i let them listen to brennan heart - imaginary btw ), 
  never heard of him before . 
  there is a value in the registry that can be changed to disable telemetry . 
  search for : `` hkey_local_machine \\ software \\ policies \\ microsoft \\ windows \\ datacollection '', 
  set dword value for `` allowtelemetry '' to 0, 
  since 2006 when i first went on holiday to croatia i was sold for life . 
  the food , people , landscape , sightseeing but most important the beer . 
  ( [ pic for beer appreciation !, 
  mostly been to istria now for holidays but i 'd like to visit dalmatia as well and in particular dubrovnik since i 've heard it 's a beautiful place to visit . 
  i always view croatians as being `` wannabe italians '' but then better in every aspect , 
  please do come over to / r/thenetherlands , we make sure the bitterbals are ready and the chairs are in a circle for the gezelligheid !, 
  i ate at a restaurant on my way back from the plitvice lakes and the owner insisted i that i drink my `` medizin '' ( insert german pronounciation here ) after i was done eating but i had to drive another 150km to krk island . 
  i declined 3 times but he kept insisting that i drink it , eventually i caved in and before i knew i was down 4 beers with the owner and the locals and hired an apartment in the village . 
  i did notice they are quite stubborn and closed-minded but you just have to take a little `` medizin '' and you 're good to go for a conversation with them . 
  ` radicalz ' it is for / u/thatsradical, 
  searching for a track that brennan played is different than a track that he actually produced . 
  are you sure it 's a track that he produced himself ? 
  dind ' t even notice : /, 
  most likely the account had a copyright strike when labels and/or producers want their content pulled from youtube . 
  which is weird because there are alot of channels featuring the sound of the harder styles . 
  more like mix of two different styles tbh . 
  * ( hardstyle and ? 
  i really like the kinda rawish part at 1:45 with the screeches . 
  not a track made by noisecontrollers but a remix , a very good remix . 
  [ dark-e - gods & symbols ( noisecontrollers remix ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tffazieolpk ), 
  [ black identity - blckr thn blck ( sensation black 2007 anthem ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so5rgr5tvk8 ), 
  this track was on a cod : uo fragmovie back in 2009 when i got in touch with hardstyle . 
  it was n't untill 2012 when i heard the defqon .1 anthem and saw the aftermovie that i really started to listen hardstyle alot . 
  [ headhunterz & wildstylez vs noisecontrollers - world of madness ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scbbksknzn8 ), 
  marder ii has been nerfed to the point that it 's a burden for the team you are playing on . 
  horrible aiming and reload time , not even to mention the accuracy and bloom of the gun . 
  at least the alpha damage is kind of okay but that 's really it . 
  what contest ? 
  where ? 
  example ? 
  not trying to exaggerate but my playlist counts 2285 tracks , 180 + hours of mostly hardstyle , some hardcore and frenchcore . 
  [ link ] ( https://youtu.be/sclzlmxgbzo?t=343 ), 
  the l/70 is just as bad at t7 as the short 88 . 
  it was just a prank bro . 
  vroeger was did gewoon ` de shit ' om over te praten . 
  untill we meet again and #myway have fantastic lyrics as well . 
  darkest hour is still very well populated during the weekend . 
  yesterday both the 29thid and the goodguysgaming server were full . 
  there is a steam group that organises events which is the same as / u/scummywummy reffered to . 
  [ the part ] ( https://youtu.be/lazzjnz6d-e?t=22s ) op is reffering to . 
  twi called it killing floor . 
  mare nostrum for red orchestra ostrfonr 41-45 was allready dead after it was released . 
  sounds like some kind of techno or eurodance . 
  amazing track with the true frequencerz sound . 
  what about these two ? 
  [ the prophet - my religion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crikj5gsm2q ), 
  [ tuneboy ft. e-life - devotion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwhhf1e0wts ),
