  hi fellow redditors ,, 
  i 'm almost done with researching the panzerkampfwagen vii otherwise known as the king tiger . 
  and since i have over 3m of cash i 'm gon na buy it right away but i need some help with the beginning research on the king tiger . 
  if somebody could give me a list what to research first and after that i would really appreciate it . 
  thanks in advance !, 
  btw i hear people keep using the 88cm even if elite for economy play , do you recommend this too ? 
  hi fellow redditors ,, 
  i ca n't choose between the m4 and the bdr . 
  mabye you can give me the final push of which tank to buy . 
  i 'm looking forward to your replies and advices .

  hey there my fellow tankers ,, 
  i was thinking what equipemtn to put on my t1 heavy . 
  i was thinking of the following 3 options but maybe you have some other suggestions . 
  medium gun rammer = so that the t1 heavy has a higher dpm . 
  enhanced gun laying drive = crappy aiming time for a t5, 
  coated optics = crappy viewrange, 
  what do you all think about this and what is your recommendation for me , and why ? 
  p.s my t1 heavy is gon na be my non-premium money maker . 
  i had some cracking good games while grinding my way to the jagdpanther . 
  most of the people dislike the jagdpanzer iv with passion but i do n't . 
  yes , the viewrange is utter garbage and the armour does n't help out alot when you are being fired upon . 
  but it has an awesome camo value and a rapid firing l/70 gun with reasonable penetration values and great accuracy . 
  once you equip it with the camo net , gun rammer , binocs and give the crew the camouflage skill it becomes a force to be reckoned with . 
  having some acpr rounds on you also helps alot . 
  if you get t8 matchmaking you will be raped and you canot damage anything but when the mm system shows some mercy on you and puts you into a t7/6 game , you will be rewarded . 
  while having said all this i 'm gon na move on with the jagdpanther .

  hi there fellow redditors ,, 
  i was asked by a friend to build a litecoin mining rig for him . 
  after some research i figured out what components to buy for him but there is one question still remaining . 
  because bitcoins and litecoins are fairly new and there are not really any laws specificly reffering to this currency i was wondering if it is legal . 
  if it is n't legal that means i 'm accessory by building the rig for him . 
  i have looked around on reddit and searched on google but there are lots of threads claiming it is legal and illegal . 
  i 'd be great if somebody could clear this up for me . 
  hey there fellow redditors ,, 
  i bought the e-75 today because it was discounted by 15 % but i need some advice on how to play it . 
  on the test server i tweaked around with the e-75 and i 've noticed that i can mount enhanced suspension on it which means i do n't need the tracks for the top turrent . 
  i will be buying that next week because then it will be 50 % discounted . 
  i played my tiger ii mostly as a support heavy but after watching a fair amount of videos i got to the conclusion that the e-75 is a brawler , but what if you do n't have the top gun yet ? 
  i hope you can help me out with it . 
  it has recently come to my mind that the do-217 j-2 , n-1 and n-2 have radars on the front where the planes main armament is mounted . 
  this was because they were designed as night-fighters to counted the allied bombing raids . 
  however when i was playing some matches ab and rb matches i came along a map where it was night , but the radars do n't seem to work . 
  does anybody know if the radars are implemented because if they do n't work then what kind of purpose do they serve ? 
  great plane to start with , great climbing rate , very manouverable but there is one big dealbreaker . 
  the armament . . it is total and utter shite . 
  at the first look you might think to yourself that 4x 12.7 mm is great . 
  yes , that is correct if they were to be soviet or capitalist 12.7 mm mg 's but these are japanese and seem to be firing paper origami bullets . 
  does n't matter what belt you use they do n't seem to do any damage at all apart from the very rare moment when you actually set a plane on fire with the all api-t tracer belt . 
  is it just me or is the ho-103 a terrible machine gun ? 
  dear / r/linuxmint community ,, 
  i need some help with figuring out which version of linux mint suites my needs the best . 
  currently i have laptop that is about 3 years old now , it runs on windows 7 at the moment . 
  due to the processor it has windows 7 is quite slow and it is very frustrating sometimes when i need to take notes for school or if i 'm watching a youtube video . 
  ** specs : **, 
  cpu - intel celeron 900 ( 2.20 ghz ), 
  gpu - intel gma4500 hd, 
  hdd - 250gb, 
  ** needs : **, 
  i mainly use this laptop for school to take notes and work on assignments , stream music * ( youtube/spotify ) * and to watch movies and videos on . 
  running ms office smoothly using * ` wine ' * is a must . 
  i really ca n't decie between cinnamon and xfce because i think that cinnamon might be to much for my laptop and that xfce wo n't be able to handle ms office because it is the lightest version of mint . 
  i 'm looking forward to your responses and advice , thanks in advance !, 
  ** edit ** : i have installed mate and it runs fantasticly well , i 'm very happy with all the advice you all gave me . 
  thanks again for the great support / r/linuxmint !, 
  hello / r/homenetworking ,, 
  i currently have a sitecom wl-341 router configured as an access point that is connected to our main router downstairs . 
  the reason i bought the wl-341 is because of the bad wifi coverage in my room . 
  i tried to factory reset both the main router and the wl-341 but to no avail . 
  the situation looks like the following : ** main router = = = wl-341 = = = pc **, 
  i have noticed that the main router gives the ap a static ip address but i have no idea if that 's something that might couse the problem . 
  the wl-341 gives out ip 's from the range * 192.168.0.100 * to * 192.168.0.200 * . 
  if there is more information needed i will be more than happy to provide it . 
  thanks in advance !,
