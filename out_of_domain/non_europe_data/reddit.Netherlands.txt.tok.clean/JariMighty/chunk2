  how can i have never seen that before ? 
  that might be it . 
  also i think due to the seperation of the entire eu server to eu1 and eu2 lots of players have got ping problems . 
  ( including me ), 
  even though i have a wired connection . 
  maybe the servers are just a bit heavy loaded with noobs due to the wot event . 
  you think i have time for that when i 'm being shot at ? 
  `` we hit 'em hard ! '', 
  * gets hit *, 
  oh , awesome scenery over there !, 
  * dead *, 
  i think this song fits wot during the weekend and all holidays . 
  [ teh noob song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkrvcvad2xa ), 
  he dind ' t caught fire at all . 
  on that user his account there are more videos of it . 
  i do n't always tk , but when i do i make sure i 'm not shooting first . 
  i got the same bullshit thrown at me because i have a rammer on my t1 heavy . 
  just some windowlicking doorknobs ca n't take a defeat . 
  yippy ya yay morherf * cker !, 
  normally when i lose i just rage the fuck out , but this is something worth cheering for . 
  kv-s all the way , it is expensive to maintain but when you have a good game you can make good money . 
  the might of the churchill compels you . 
  let 's su the tog ii * and bring him to court . 
  i see that people are starting to use jingles his famous quote, 
  `` windowlicking doorknobs '', 
  you only get 6gb of ram memory on a $ 730 machine ? 
  total rip-off dude !, 
  i absolutely love my t1 heavy tank . 
  63 % wr on my t1 heavy because it is very agile , fast and a great gun for a heavy tank . 
  i 'd almost say it is a medium tank instead of a heavy . 
  also i have my 2nd crew skill at 80 % and i have a medium gun rammer and a gun laying drive . 
  thinking about getting a toolbox or vents . 
  my favorite t6 tank is the vk3601h with the 88mm gun , it is a complete beast !, 
  is n't there some kind of local it shop in your area that sells laptops ? 
  because on most big stores like bestbuy and such you pay way to much than you should . 
  the long 75mm gun on the panther . 
  12 shots per min and almost 200 pen and 135 alpha damage, 
  god ? 
  thank physics for that . 
  reminds me of the m6a2e1 . 
  they should make a system that does n't allow you to make a `` fail platoon '' . 
  so that a tank ca n't fight tank which he normally does n't fight to when not in a platoon . 
  awesome photos !, 
  thanks alot fellow tank commander !, 
  steel wall on my at-1, 
  the dutch army did this too a while back . 
  [ leopard tank redeploying on the dutch highway ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9mny7_38tu ), 
  do they also ship for free to europe ? 
  if you did a few thing different you could have killed all of them on your own . 
  mistakes are to learn from .

  lord finesse - hip 2 the game,

  big l - ( all rap tracks in general ), 
  there are way more rappers like i named above but youtube related videos will lead you to them . 
  i ca n't understand shit of what they are saying . 
  but anyway , here have an upvote, 
  that is exactly what a freestyle is about . 
  otherwise it is called a freeverse, 
  you call this rap ? 
  you are a disgrace for the / r/rap community !, 
  i really enjoyed playing the russian t-26 . 
  it is a very agile and `` sort of '' fast aswell . 
  the great 45mm top gun and the rate of fire make it a force to be reckoned with . 
  so you better wreckonize :p, 
  also the german pz.ii is alot of fun to play and a great credit earner . 
  though it lacks firepower on the 2cm flak 38 l/112 , mainly in penetration . 
  but if you get up and close and shoot them from their rear-in or the side you can easily take them out . 
  people like different things so i have no idea if you like these two tanks i suggested . 
  p.s the pz.kpfw . 
  35 ( t ) is also a fun tank to play imo . 
  you should have gone around the at15 instead of taking him head on . 
  imo , i 'd go for the grille . 
  here is the [ faq ] ( http://forum.worldofwarships.eu/index.php?/topic/34-faq/ ), 
  it is a nick name for the ** panzerkampfwagen vi ausf . 
  it was reffered as the king tiger because it was even more dangerous than the previous version ; the tiger i * ( panzerkampfwagen vi ausf . 
  i used to love my t1 heavy but since i put on the medium gun rammer and the gun laying drive i have been getting utter shit matchmaking . 
  playing against tiger 's ( p ) and is 's . 
  and i 'm not gon na fire heat so i sold it with a wr of 61 % . 
  now i bought myself a t-34 and afterwards i got the t-34-85 . 
  i love these two soviet tanks . 
  currently i have a 60 % wr on the t-34 and a 52 % wr on the t-34-85 but that gun is just amazing when i got it yesterday . 
  ( awfull grind though ), 
  the germans gave their tanks names for some reason . 
  examples ;, 
  bison - buffalo, 
  grille - cricket, 
  tiger - tiger, 
  k\u00f6ningstiger - bengal tiger, 
  maus - mouse ( supposed to be a big tank [ / irony ] ), 
  panther, 
  most of the vk types were prototypes and never saw service in the german armed forces at the time . 
  look up the history of those tanks , it is very interesting if you like tanks . 
  well , if you know better then why do n't you go and tell them ? 
  i can search the lyrics and use my best friend . 
  ( google translate ), 
  you got ta have the 2nd engine unlocked though .
