  i 'd undu playing the m10 wolverine . 
  from the 88 ga, 
  mes i played i have a 38 % wr . 
  this dind ' t happen because it 's a bad td but because i was donking out every match trying to play it as a regular tank . 
  research the 10.5 cm kwk 46 l/68 . 
  you will need it on the e-75 because you will be fighting against t9 and t10 's more often and the 88 will just bounce most of the time . 
  the tiger ii sort of prepares you for the e-75 because of the somewhat simular playstyle . 
  imo , get the top gun on the tiger ii before you go for the e-75 . 
  after reading this i wo n't complain anymore about what we call nowadays `` shitty matchmaking '' . 
  what on earth do you expect from it ? 
  do you expect a 1280x1080p resolution with vsync and settings to maximum ? 
  it is a card game , it is not designed to have good graphics because people will play it because it is fun . 
  russian accuracy at it 's finest . 
  more like a circlejerk imo . 
  watch it lads . 
  [ he ] ( http://www.noobmeter.com/player/na/prototypepegasus/1001828556/ ) will destory you . 
  his nickname will then be `` gnome '', 
  he sure would , no doubt about that . 
  i 'd watch it . 
  very informing video imo . 
  do you think this strat can be used and adapted in tank company 's and team battle 's ? 
  over long distances the wind current and the gravitational pull of the earth are definitly coming into play but tanks were hardly fighting at such a distance . 
  also the training of the crew plays a big role aswell as the gun sights and shell velocity . 
  example : german crews were trained to always hit their first shot, 
  so many little things have affect on the accuracy of a tank 's gun but some of those things are just to small to affect it . 
  because rng . 
  i ca n't blame it all on the team even i have to admit that but in most games i was the only one who was guarding the flank . 
  tanks will swarm in from the flank and from there on the match is lost . 
  i saw it on history channel a long time ago . 
  i ca n't recall the name of the documentary , sorry . 
  i 'm going to get yeh little bugger ... after i finished my tea . 
  i know that 's the actual translation . 
  i was trying to impersonate somebody that speaks english with a heavy german accent . 
  i may have failed horribly, 
  i do n't want to sound stereotypical but . . yes , indeed . 
  at least it has the upgraded turrent . 
  and here we see an e-100 in his natural habitat using his weight to his advantage to subdue his prey . 
  indeed , i 'd rather see wargaming add the team battle stats to the regular stats and that you will be able to filter out the battle that were fought in team battles . 
  no idea , i 'm not a programmer at wargaming . 
  it 's just a suggestion after all . 
  oh yea , forgot this was reddit . 
  to be honest , i used to be a total douchebag in wot . 
  i was trolling and raging against the foes and friendly players . 
  this changed when i finally realised the importance of taking situations from in-game battles and think them through of what i could have done better . 
  after i started doing that my wr has gone up from 45 % to where it is now around 53-54 % . 
  sometimes i still have moments where i rage against my team but most of the time it has a reason for it . 
  that 's my confession . 
  i listen to hardstyle while tanking . 
  sometimes when i really need to blow off some steam in wot i switch to hardcore . 
  do n't you mean the habsburg empire ? 
  they had quite a big fleet , could be very interesting . 
  the might of the tiger ii compels you . 
  * unless it catches fire *, 
  at 0:05 what 's all that lotion doing on the desk ? 
  i know but i want to have the turrent first because the stock turrent is considered the same thickness as a sheet of paper in t9 + games . 
  from there i get the tracks and eventually the gun , or the other way around . 
  we 'll see how it goes . 
  the 105mm is a great gun indeed but the pen on ap shells is really struggling to pen t9 's and t10 's from the front and side when well angled . 
  and firing apcr only is kinda expensive in the long run . 
  cheers for that . 
  i will have a look at it when i get home . 
  i 'd love to get in and brawl in front of enemy tanks but the 105mm gun is lacking the pen and using apcr is gon na be expensive . 
  i 'm gon na free xp the turrent and eventually grind to the the other modules . 
  i wil try to get some advice some other players that do have some experience in the e-75 . 
  thanks anyway , 
  i 'd love to see wg adding the sherman firefly in the british medium line . 
  would be great though because it 's purpose after all was to counter the tiger i.

  i 've searched on the internet about the museum and all that i can find is that it has been closed since 2007 for renovation . 
  at least that is what it says .

  ** russian war doctrine **, 
  * if a tank is unable to move it is considered a fortress *, 
  a great td imo but the main mistakes people make is to play it as a medium which is gon na make you useless for the team . 
  the gun that is gets is very good for it 's tier because it has a great rof and great accuracy . 
  though the turrent traverse is slow the view range is good and combine this with binos you will be fine as long as you stay back and provide covering fire for your team . 
  a fine little derp td that is a quite good allrounder . 
  it 's pretty well armoured for it 's tier and gets a great selection of guns . 
  most people will take the 10,5 cm derp gun but it totally depends on your prefferences . 
  the front armour is 60mm thick with a very good sloping to it which makes it kinda troll at some points . 
  the viewrange is bad juest 260m so getting binos is a must . 
  a td in the new german td line , it has paper for armour but the gun that it gets is very good because it has a high rof , excellent aiming time and a great accuracy . 
  camo net and skill is a must for this tank because it has no armour whatsoever and you can not afford to take any hits from nobody . 
  any derp gun will 1 shit you if it hits . 
  it 's also quite speedy and very mobile and with a viewrange of 360m combined with binos it is a great sniper . 
  this is my personal opinion about the tanks btw . 
  back in the days when i had around 2500 battles and just beginning to understand how everything worked , i sold my is with the entire crew which had it 's 2nd crew skill at 30 % . 
  i thought it would add to the value of the tank ... at least that is what i thought, 
  stupid is as stupid does . 
  mainly because some of the tutorials are outdated and because alot of players do n't even bother looking for it . 
  i 'd rather see a better in-game tutorial like in wt where you can actually learn something from the in-game tutorial . 
  i enjoyed the jagdpanzer iv aswell but the only downside of it was the lacking viewrange before patch 8.9 because before that it was 330 and now has been buffed to 350 . 
  the gun selection is n't that bad either , you can either take the roll of a sniper with the l/70 or skirmish around the battlefield with the l/56 . 
  i personally preffer the l/70 because of the better aimtime , rof and above all a more reliable penetration . 
  gib gold plox, 
  the shell costs 256 per shot which is almost 4x cheaper than the kv-1s . 
  if you like turnfighting with the japs i suggest you try the british . 
  the hurricane and the spitfire planes are just the perfect combination for turnfighting . 
  ** for example **, 
  the hurricane mk.ii has 12x 7.7 mm mg 's with an ammo capacity of 4200 rounds .
