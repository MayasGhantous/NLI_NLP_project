  it 's turns like an absolute boss and the loadout of mg 's is just great and all that for a plane that has a br of 2.3 . 
  it also has the option to mount rockets and bombs . 
  i suggest you watch [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtg6qj6lwjg ) from quickybaby , i think it might come in handy for you . 
  the panther is a medium but not a flanking medium like the comet . 
  play it more like a supporting medium and take away small bits of health from enemy tanks from a distance . 
  if you are planning on keeping the panther i suggest you mount a rammer , vents and binos/optics . 
  have you thought about investing into an fmc 50 t ? 
  whenever i 'm playing my tiger ii i put my gun up in the air like they did on a photo just before the battle of the bulge started .

  option 4 is why i use that in wot aswell . 
  nice to know all those little facts , i thought pointing the gun up in the air was some kind of fancy thing to do . 
  ty for pointing it out , 
  raise the sail !, 
  [ lowrider yo , cuz dat 's how i roll ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmwbh0b9f0m ), 
  because some people are dickheads . 
  i always try to either evade or try to escape from , for example , a dogfight which i know i 'm gon na lose and if the situation is really hopeless i just grant the opposing player the kill because he/she simply outplayed me . 
  simple as that ... or is it ? 
  13 planes shot down with a f6f-3 hellcat in a ab battle . 
  i 've been playing wt for like 2 months and i think this is a big step forward for a noob like me . 
  ( the 6x 12.7 mm mg 's wrecked every plane i encountered though  ), 
  w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk, 
  i enjoyed watching this when it was on the history channel back in the days when it was about actual history . 
  ty for sharing this . 
  as a td it has a terrible camo value and as a medium it has a non-functional turrent which actually acts as a giant tumor . 
  indeed , the only thing i really like about it is the dpm and the gun that it gets . 
  that 's pretty much it for me . 
  he shells from stronk soviet su-152 do n't care . 
  say goodbye to both your loaders , gunner , commander and gun . 
  su-152 , just shooting he at everything that moves and damaging every part of their tank . 
  amen to that . 
  i was actually talking about the perspective side of it but if you look at it that way then , yes . 
  during the [ weekend ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzxqwyhq4i8 ), 
  i can only imagine what poland would bring if they participate . 
  `` horsey wit armor is stronk tenk , poland can into tenk biathlon . '', 
  i 'm sorry i 'm just your average redditor  [ link ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j2gqoxs.jpg ), 
  you got ta play the t-34 as a flanker . 
  the one advantage it has over the other t5 meds is the insane dpm it gets with the 57mm zis-4 gun . 
  it has a suprising `` un-russian '' accuracy of 0.34 m and a 2.3 aiming time . 
  not to mention that the prem shells for that gun have 198mm of pen . 
  the equipment i suggest on it are a gun rammer , gld and vents but you can also go for optics even though the tank has garbage view range . 
  try to make the most of your decisions because people will mostly ignore you because you have such low alpha damage . 
  like said before , it is a flanker but try to use friendly tanks as a meatshield and let them take all the hits while you do all the damage . 
  p.s imo the best non-premium moneymaker, 
  loads a money !, 
  i got ta get this asap and play killing floor again . 
  i do n't really like the bdr because it is really sluggish and it does n't really have great armour . 
  the only thing that i like about it is the gun . 
  this is not really what i seem to like and expected of a heavy tank .

  i have n't played wot for 2 weeks now because of this . 
  i just simply refuse to play because i 've just been losing match after match due to the lag spikes . 
   i have n't played wot for 2 weeks, 
  i did have problems with my isp provider because of the shitty default router they sent over to me so i bought myself sitecom wlr-8100 and all those problems belonged to the past . 
  since i just like playing wot i expect them to provide a great gameplay quality like any other sensible game publisher would do . 
  however since i have n't played for a while the problem might be solved during the time i 've been playing wt and cod4 for the last 2 weeks without any lag-spikes or bad latency . 
  i fully appreciate your help but i do n't need it . 
  the tiger ii is more of a support heavy when you are bottom to mid-tiered in the last . 
  if you are top-tier in a match you can definitly afford to be more aggresive and use your armour to dominate your oponents . 
  this only applies if you are fully upgraded though . 
  i suggest the following research path : tracks  turret  guns  the rest, 
  you can also change the turret and guns around but the tiger ii realies on it 's armour more than on it 's gun . 
  also the first 10.5 cm gun is n't really a good choice imo because the shell costs quadruples over the 8.8 cm and the accuracy and dpm is less . 
  do n't forget to load some prem shells for the 8.8 cm because it bounces alot in higher tiered matches, 
  as equipment goes choose the following : ** rammer , vents and vert . 
  stab . 
  for crew skills i suggest , like any other sensible heavy tank player would do , that you give repairs priority and give your commander sixth sense . 
  ** skills/perks ** * ( my current setup / * = optional ) *, 
  commander - sith sense  repairs  firefighting  * bia, 
  driver - repairs  preventive maintainance  ofroad driving  * bia, 
  gunner - repairs  snapshot  armorer  * bia, 
  radio operator - repairs  sit . 
  awareness  firefighting  * bia, 
  loader - repairs  safe stowage  firefighting  * bia, 
  these are my suggestions from the experience i have got with this fantastic machine . 
  after more then 500 games and a wr of 58 % on this tank i have to say i think this is one of the better t8 heavies in the game . 
  this is all based on my personal opinion , keep that in mind . 
  it does n't mean this works for everybody, 
  does [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/289e3z3 ) need more explanation to you ? 
  pindakaas is baas . 
  i bet that bots are very busy getting these codes . 
  i bet bots are responsible for redeeming lots of thesr codes . 
  go to the banana they said , it will be fun they said . 
  it 's the dynamic campaign from planet side 2 , right ? 
  sort of the same system that wot 's clan wars system uses except that you ca n't join instantly . 
  i 'm sure there will be more information on other models in the future . 
  thou shalt not steal !, 
   complaints about enemies using gold ammo, 
  `` how terrible '', 
   chance to win, 
  because even trying to win is too hard ( xvm whores ), 
   general negativity, 
  just ignore the brainless zombie parade, 
  `` it has been said that this rare fossil might have come from the soviet era . 
  this has not been confirmed yet because there is no fossilized log found yet in the excavation area . '', 
  the tiger ii is more of a support heavy when you are bottom to mid-tiered . 
  if you are top-tier in a match you can definitly afford to be more aggresive and use your armour to dominate your oponents . 
  this advice only applies if you are fully upgraded though . 
  i suggest the following research path : tracks  turret  guns  the rest, 
  you can also change the turret and guns around in the research path but the tiger ii realies on it 's armour more than on it 's gun when stock .
