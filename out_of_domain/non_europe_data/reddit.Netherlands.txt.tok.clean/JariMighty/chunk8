  also the first 10.5 cm gun is n't really a good choice imo because the shell costs quadruples over the 8.8 cm and the accuracy and dpm is less . 
  do n't forget to load some prem shells for the 8.8 cm because it bounces alot in higher tiered matches, 
  as equipment goes choose the following : ** rammer , vents and vert . 
  stab . 
  for crew skills i suggest , like any other sensible heavy tank player would do , that you give repairs priority and give your commander sixth sense . 
  these are my suggestions from the experience i have got with this fantastic machine . 
  after more then 500 games and a wr of 58 % on this tank i have to say i think this is one of the better t8 heavies in the game . 
  this is all based on my personal opinion , keep that in mind . 
  it does n't mean this works for everybody, 
  wargaming 's tank tech support, 
  it 's a fortress now by soviet standards . 
  when you aim at a tank and fire from point blanc range and the shells does n't go anywhere near the target . 
  ( dem servers ), 
  it 's a bit high pitched imo , but i really like the melody though . 
  nice april fools joke , very well thought through . 
   `` jap '' is now banned as well due to racial ** insensitivity **, 
  the main reason why i subscribed to arran is because i like the rage videos with ed because they are glorious . 
  this is amazing !, 
  day 7 : they still do n't know i 'm a panther tank, 
  su-152 with derp and he all day long . 
  kv-2 with the derp is the same story but then a tier lower . 
  that 's why you fire he because aiming at weakspots is n't really an option when you are tipsy or drunk with the stronk russian accuracy, 
   connection timed out, 
  this is going really fast, 
  i f * cking hope not . 
  i bet bots get half of the codes, 
  from my point of view it begins to sound more like dance than hardstyle . 
  that is why i 'm moving to raw hardstyle . 
  fact , the t-43 is a flanker and has to be used to flank enemy tanks whenever it gets the chance to do so . 
  experience come with time . 
  learn from your mistakes and adjust your tactics to it . 
  eventually you will succeed . 
  hopefully i will get one , so excited !, 
  and people actually use these voice comms . 
  you have my sympathy . 
  there is a single player mode , yes . 
  but ro2 : hos is not a sp game at all , it focus is more towards mp . 
  the sp is good but not great it 's more like : `` attack a !, 
  attack b !, 
  attack c !, 
  we won comrade ! '' . 
  red orchestra ostfront 41-45 has better tank combat imo , more vehicles and tanks . 
  red orchestra ostfront and hos have very little tank based servers up and running . 
  and even if there are tank servers up they are mostly unpopulated . 
  look on [ gametracker ] ( http://www.gametracker.com ) for more info about the servers there . 
  do n't expect alot from the ai in sp from the lowest to the middle difficulty mode because it 's underpowered . 
  the hardest difficulty however means you will die instantly . 
  join the army . 
  this is from call of duty united offensive when you need to protect the b-17 from enemy fighters . 
  the skin is nice aswell , 
  for old times sake , aww hell yeah !, 
  / r/antibaw is n't it ? 
  i have noticed this but from my point of view it has n't really changed all the much to be honest . 
  i mean , yes it has changed a bit but it does n't really have any influence on me flying the zero 's . 
  i normally force them into a turn fight and make them eat tracer shells . 
  ( high explosive fragmentation tracer shell = aw yeah ), 
  who ordered some freedom ? 
  the swastika is politically incorrect , but 100 % accurate . 
  looks like a nightfighter skin , but i 'm not an expert on this kind of stuff, 
  til, 
  had to turn down my volume because of the high pitched sounds in the beginning . 
  i like the kick though . 
  tldr : he who knows when and when not to fight will be the victor ? 
  larger bombs have a bigger blast radius thus doing more damage to it 's surroundings . 
  yup , soviet union is a perfect nation for starters . 
  the usa is also a good nation for planes imo . 
  ( former wot player here as well ), 
  i just like both of them , that 's what i have to say about this . 
  got ta love the germans , haha, 
  [ my favourite laugs of james may ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phrj7evcl38 ), 
  nyet tovarish , leninglass it is for to contain glorious soviet drink vodka . 
  had it on full volume . 
  my ears are bleeding but my brain wants more . 
  that 's the so called [ `` schr\u00e4ge musik '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schr%c3%a4ge_musik ) option that got implemented into war thunder . 
  you will have to assign a specific key in the options menu to switch to the `` schr\u00e4ge musik '' point of view . 
  i have tried it and have n't been having any succes with it whatsoever . 
  but maybe it takes time to get used to it . 
  if i were you i 'd just skip that do217 n-2 . 
  same goes for the japanses ki-45 tei toryu . 
  this plane has 1 forward firing 37mm and 2x 20mm upward firing . 
  at least the 37mm there serves a purpose even though it has only 15 rounds . 
  maybe it 's something i have to work on but the br of the do217 is n't as forgiving as that of the ki-45 tei toryu . 
  practice makes perfect .

  worked alot of overtime for this . 
  totally worth it imo . 
  my pleasure , 
  it 's a shame if you give them away , the line-up on defqon .1 is beast !, 
  have fun trying to copy pixels , 
  haha , i definitely will . 
  thanks !, 
  dutch supporters are known to be one of the `` craziest '' football fans . 
  what they lack in numbers they make up for it in enthusiasm for their national team . 
  to the dutch viewers : [ remember this ?

  if wg puts some good effort in it then gaijin would need to put all hands on deck .
