  the regular f4u-1a can mount bombs . 
  you have the choice of a 500 or a 1000 pounder if i 'm not mistaking . 
  as of patch 1.41 the arcade br of the a6m2 reisen `` zero '' should be 3.3 but in-game it says it 's 3.7 . 
  it 's not mentioned in the patchnotes either . 
  i personally like the spitfire mk.ia and mk.iia a lot . 
  great turners , an `` okay '' fighter once on altitude and the 8x 7.7 mm i also like a lot . 
  just load up the omni-purpose belt and annoy your opponents to death . 
  i know spitfire can turnfight very well but i like to use bnz tictacs with it . 
  p.s unpopular opinion ? 
  i can only imagine raving to this track in the sun all day long . 
  damn , this is such a good anthem !, 
  agreed , i actually think it should be tier 2 and have a br of 2.7 . 
  if you really want my honest opinions about the planes you named , well here you have it . 
  i ca n't judge the bearcat and the mustang unfortunately because i have n't researched those yet . 
  hellcat : should be t3 and have a br of 3.0, 
  corsair : should be t3 and have a br of 3.3, 
  from my point of view nothing is related to hardstyle apart from the bass and the kick in this track . 
  edit : it 's dance imo, 
  it 's indeed a fantastic plane . 
  the 15mm is great for sniping critical parts of any plane . 
  i personally like to use the armored belt just like the op said . 
  not even to mention the 8x 73mm rockets it can carry in its wings . 
  to be honest i really like the 15mm cannon , kinda like the american 50 . cal but then german . 
  too bad the germans only used it for the bf 109 f-2 afaik . 
  i stood next to a tiger ii once when i was visiting a museum in belgium . 
  that thing was freaking huge . 
  after some searching i found the museum i visited when i was 12y old . 
  ( 18 now ) . 
  it is definitly worth it to visit that museum even though it is small it gives you a great view of what happend .

  [ la gleize , muse\u00e9 december 1944 ] ( http://www.december44.com/en/history_battle_of_the_bulgela_gleize.htm ),

  no , unfortunately you can only admire the outside of the tank . 
  you can climb it though . 
  there are lots of museums there that commemorate the battle of the bulge in the surrounding area . 
  i also visited a museum in dinant and bastogne . 
  could [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/45tskxp.png ) be the picture ? 
  that 's a sherman m4a3e8 ( 76 ) w `` easy eight '' next to a tiger ii with the henschel turret . 
  many museums have description boards near every museumpiece in english , french , german and dutch so you do n't need to worried about that , 
  during the winter it is snowing there and it really adds to the feeling of immersion when you finished the museum and are outside standing and looking at tiger ii 213 . 
  you get a feeling like : `` well shit ... things were pretty grim here '', 
  til, 
   the initial design is often misleadingly called the `` porsche '' turret due to the belief that it was designed by porsche for their prototype ; in fact it was the initial krupp design for both prototypes . 
  tried wikipedia to verify it and actually the `` porsche '' turret was designed by krupp but made by porsche . 
  50 turrets were produced and fitted on the tiger ii 's hull . 
  hey , you learn something new everyday , 
  oh i see , maybe i misread that article . 
  thanks for the heads up , 
  i suppose you are german , right ? 
  because it is known that german care alot about how their language is being used . 
  especially if something is done wrong . 
  you gave me an idea for a [ gifsound ] ( http://gifsound.com/?gif=giant.gfycat.com/carelessgracefulamericanriverotter.gif&amp;v=zkv4gztmfgm ), 
  call it the soviet `` titanic '' because it did not fare very well , did it ? 
   during operation barbarossa , ** ninety percent of the t-35s lost by the 67th and 68th tank regiments were lost not to enemy action but through either mechanical failure or because they were abandoned and destroyed by their crews . 
  ** the most common causes of breakdown were transmission-related . 
  the last recorded action of the t-35 took place during the early stages of the battle of moscow . 
  at least one captured t-35 was shipped to germany for evaluation at the kummersdorf military proving ground . 
  wikipedia delivers, 
  maybe i interpreted it wrong but what i was trying to say is that the soviet high command thought that big was the way to go for tank . 
  look , it even has a boiler on the back for when it 's tea time . 
  [ goliath , a german tracked mine from ww2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goliath_tracked_mine ), 
  no idea actually but maybe they are reffering it in an ironic way to the bible characters named '' `` david and goliath '' . 
  afaik goliath was the big guy and david his smaller companion or something like that . 
  to sum it up : goliath ( bible character ) is big and strong and the goliath ( tracked mine ) was small and powerful . 
  the irony though . 
  another example : the german maus tank , maus = mice in english and mice are small but the maus was huge . 
  get it ? 
  i never said that , but i like this german joke alot . 
   a german is driving his car in britain . 
  a british cop pulls him over to the side of the road . 
   cop : `` sir , do you realize that there are two poisonous snakes on your windshield ? '', 
   the german : `` off course !, 
  zey are my vinscreen vipers ! '', 
  germony can into mache einen witz, 
  i 'm not even trying anymore to play german t3/4 in rb . 
  at the moment i 'm just playing ab with my bf 109 f-4 and clubbing me some seals because their tears feed my soul and heal my wounds from rb . 
  edit : my skrub spelling was n't mlg, 
  `` nerfwaffe '' should be the new name in rb, 
  i personally like the me-410 a1/u -2 alot . 
  it has 4x 20mm mg151 cannons with an ammo count of 1200 rounds . 
  this means each cannon gets 300 rounds which is more than enough . 
  i have tried it on rb but i 'm not really good at flying it but one well aimed burst from your cannons and the enemy plane gets totally shredded . 
  germony can not into sarcasm . 
  looks like they are dancing on mainstream dance music from my point of view . 
  it just does n't feel right as a true hardstyle listener and certainly not when some raw hardstyle is playing instead of euphoric hardstyle . 
  but da comrade , facist germony lost teh great big patriotic war . 
  sovietsky stronkest country in the world . 
  sorry for having an opinion about something :o, 
  do n't call the gaijin nkvd police on me plox . 
  ( apart van de fundamentalisten dan ), 
  so you 're telling me there is a chance ? 
  for me it 's mostly the amount of grinding in tier 4 that kills the fun for me . 
  what i like about tier 3 is that you mostly need to stick to the tactics that belong to that plane . 
  otherwise you 'll just be a sitting duck . 
  what i meant was , is that tier 4 is more of a grind than tier 3 but not as expensive . 
  tier 5 upgrades on the other hands are a pain in the arse and bloody expensive to buy . 
  i should have mentioned that earlier . 
  but hey , better late than never . 
  watching some tutorials on youtube and then practicing them in a custom battle really help out alot . 
  try that .
