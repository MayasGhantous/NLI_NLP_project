brainstorming . 
  you want to explore as much as possible , the details come later . 
  even the ridiculous / stupid ideas might make you think of something . 
  or at least that 's what they tell me at design uni . 
  as a dutchman currently living near toronto , i 've encountered more stoners here in 6 months than i have in my 20 years of living in holland . 
  and of course the famous canadian etiquette leads to everyone offering me some of their weed . 
  i tell all of them i 've never touched the stuff . 
  never have i seen so many stares of disbelief . 
  a word i 'm often missing in my language is ` kill ' , as in ' a kill ' . 
  comes up often during playing games . 
  the other way around however is much more interesting . 
  i can honestly not comprehend how the english language survived without a word like `` wel '' in dutch . 
  to put it simply , it is the antonym of ` not ' . 
  it is a confirmation instead of a denial . 
  `` wel '' is to ` not ' , what ` yes ' is to ` no ' . 
  there is sort of a lucky workaround in english . 
  for some reason the verb ` to do ' is unnecessarily to basically every sentence , and so they just emphasize this . 
  * `` you did not brush your teeth '' * - * `` you 're wrong , i * *** did *** * brush my teeth '' *, 
  ( in dutch , you 'd just replace ` not ' with `` wel '' ), 
  however , this does n't work 100 % of the time . 
  and it definitely does n't work well in text . 
  sometimes it 's also just weird . 
  think of a typical childish back and forth argument for example . 
  in dutch the children would yell `` niet ! '', 
  and `` wel ! '', 
  at each other , where in english they go `` did not ! '', 
  - `` did too ! '' . 
  * did * '' *** too *** '' ? 
  what the fuck does that even * mean * ? 
  as a recent 9gag convert ( please do n't flame me , i 'm on your side ! ), 
  i would compare reddit to 9gag as i would compare pc gaming to console gaming . 
  the former is pretty much superior in every way , except for the amount of effort you need to put in to it to make it work the way you want to . 
  i personally believe overpopulation is the biggest immediate threat to civilization we 've ever had . 
  to fix this i think the amount of kids you can have should be limited , or it should be exclusive to certain people ( successful ones ) . 
  having children should be a privilege , not a right . 
  hydro means electricity . 
  i 'm pretty sure they call it that way because most of it comes from the hydroplants . 
  i know , confusing as fuck because the word itself means water and that 's also a utility . 
  canadians are weird . 
  also , the tv probably wo n't recieve the cable signal until you pay for it . 
  rectify, 
  my dog always passionately licks both my ears . 
  whenever i try to give her a hug or anything it 's straight for the ears for her . 
  funny thing is she only does it with me and not with anyone else in my family . 
  it might sound a little crazy , but she 's always super massively excited when she meets * anyone * , so when i came back from half a year abroad it was kind of reassuring she licked my ears instead of a normal super hyped greeting , as it showed she still knew who i as . 
  ( i was sorta worried she would n't remember me , being pretty young and all ), 
  to basically any non-english native , this is not very suprising , 
  yeah steam downloads to your primary drive ... unless you change it . 
  you really do n't need 3rd party software . 
  i have a steam library folder both on my ssd and hdd , and i can select which one to install to everytime i start downloading a game . 
  you have to go to steam -  settings -  downloads and then click on `` steam library folders '' . 
  you can add an extra library on a different drive there . 
  `` only if your pussy is as smooth as that line . '', 
  sorry , but i honestly do n't see why bethesda should get a cut here . 
  i can understand valve , as they 're the one hosting the mod and created the workshop platform for mod , and effectively marketing them and giving them exposure ( 30 % is a bit much for just a hosting service , though , imo ), 
  bethesda had no direct involvement with these mods . 
  and no , the creation of the game is not a direct involvement . 
  bethesda already got their cut when you bought the game . 
  let me put it this way : if i bought photoshop , does that entitle microsoft to a cut of every little thing i produce with it and try to sell ? 
  may i ask what master you 're signing up for ? 
  coming from a fellow `` io'er '' that almost finished his bsc and does n't know what to do next ... 
  everybody acts like there was some sort of turnaround , but i see an ongoing trend :, 
  screen larger , everything else smaller . 
  yeah , the more i wrote and thought about it the more i came to that conclusion . 
  regardless , these things are still what makes luden 's echo just that tad bit overpowered , imo . 
  i 'd say katarina for sure . 
  akali is pretty much the same , but travels even * more * distance . 
  ahri is already strong with her q movement speed , but her ult dashes basically give her 2 free luden 's triggers . 
  leblanc definitely , she moves like crazy . 
  i 'm not sure how it works on tf ult , but i 'm guessing it would be similar . 
  there are some others , but in general it 's champions with refreshable dashes where it really gets out of hand . 
  eh , this video is very back and forth and confusing , not really pure one-sided rage inducing . 
  it probably also depends on your opinion on the matter . 
  i actually thought destiny ( and the small additions of kacey ) started really strong and were right to call sky a hypocrit , but after he just kept yelling and shouting for the sake of disagreement he kind of lost his footing . 
  especially after sky and siv started explaining themselves better . 
  after that i kinda had to agree with almost everything tb said , although slightly leaning towards siv 's side . 
  boy , that discussion really threw me around ... 
  you 're completely missing the point . 
  it 's not about judging a game by its graphics . 
  it 's about showing ground-breaking visuals , showing amazing advancement of graphical technology , passing it off as `` gameplay '' and letting people * pre-order * your game thinking it 's gon na be the next milestone in gaming graphics . 
  only to tear it all down and release a version that 's not even close to what you showed before . 
  do n't get me wrong , purely judging the game in its current state , it 's probably still a solid game ( even though i honestly do n't like the current visuals , i 'm sure the gameplay will be cool ) . 
  and downgrading is fine , to a certain extent . 
  it 's about falsely creating hype , and lack of honesty about the obvious downgrade . 
  i was going to comment about how visuals are a perfectly fine criterium to take into account when looking for games , and how we do it all the time with movies , comics etc. 
  but then i saw you played the you-can ` t-do-it-better-yourself card and i realised my mother taught me to not feed trolls, 
  right , and i did n't say `` graphics is all i care about '' . 
  see how twisting words is annoying ? 
  calling me a circlejerker , and saying i do n't understand game dev and should n't call myself a gamer are pretty extreme accusations of someone who mentions enjoying visuals and not liking being misguided . 
  the amd guy is talking about nvidia techniques like gameworks being supplied in dll 's . 
  basically , nvidia writes codes for these graphic effects and the gamedevs ca n't change or even see it . 
  apperantly , nvidia is also creating contracts where they state that gamedevs ca n't cooperate with amd at all . 
  he also mentions a few cases ( crysis , cod ghosts ) where these pieces of code , only visible to nvidia , were abused to make the game run significantly slower on amd hardware . 
  of course , this guy is biased af . 
  but if you ask me he sounds genuine . 
  he repeatedly tries to say how nobody should trust anything either companies say , and to just look at the data itself . 
  and if i have to believe the other guys here , there appear to be many cases where nvidia supported games run much better on nvidia than amd , and amd supported games run similar on both types of hardware . 
  but hey , why trust me ? 
  why trust this amd guy ? 
  like he said , look into it yourself and form your own opinion on it .
