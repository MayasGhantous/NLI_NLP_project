  the connection from dark skin is unnatractive -  black and indian people have dark skin -  i dont date unattractive people -  i dont date black and indian people is pretty clear and no one can blame you for your preference . 
  but you have to remember that the slightest amount of generalisation will trigger an avalanche of snowflakes . 
  so it 's probably your way of wording it that makes people think it 's racist . 
  saying * only * `` i do n't date blacks or indians '' without the context sounds racist because it sounds like you 're judging solely on their ethnical background , whilst it really is about the physical feature that 's typical among these groups . 
  i assume you would n't dismiss a woman you found attractive woman just because of her heritage , but that 's what it sounds like to some people . 
  you have to very precise with these things to avoid being called racist . 
  if you still want to generalise you 're probably better off saying you wo n't date dark-skinned girls than saying you wo n't date black or indian girls . 
  okay sure , bad experiences . 
  although you probably would n't have minded those dishes if you did n't already disliked bitterness . 
  you get my point though right ? 
  this exactly . 
  i use my tv & couch for partygames with friends and games i want to chill out to . 
  although with the $ 20 steam link sale i 've been wondering if that would 've been the better option opposed to all the cable plugging and management . 
  the ` choice ' is irrelevant . 
  why would op choose to date people he did n't find attractive ? 
  it 's the reasoning behind it ( the preference ) that drives this discussion . 
  and like you said , a preference like disliking bitterness ( or dark skin ) is probably something you 're born with, 
  why not ? 
  you 're happy to accept being born with a preference in taste , why not with visuals , sounds , smell , touch , sexuality etc. 
  i do n't . 
  not besides empirical evidence . 
  for example , i live in the tallest country in the world but somehow have a thing for short girls . 
  that would n't make sense if it was entirely determined by nurture . 
  i view having a ` type ' as an extent of sexual orientation . 
  but if you have anything that says otherwise i 'm open to having that view changed . 
  i had a lot of trouble getting through the witcher 1 . 
  it had n't aged great and the combat is shite . 
  however , when i finally managed to push through the prologue and chapter 1 , the game completely sucked me in . 
  the story and quests get really cool in chapter 2 , so try to make it at least until there . 
  after getting gold on all the challenges , i can say this is the hardest one to get . 
  i believe on pc , gold and all-time record are only 2 seconds apart . 
  not really , that 's just the difference between a theoretical example and a practical one, 
  what the hell is he doing . 
  there 's an fps counter on the screen right there and none of the shots show an fps higher than ~ 115 fps . 
  i 'm not too surprised since it also says there 's an gtx 960 in there . 
  what 's the point of reviewing a 240hz monitor at 115 , often even 80 fps ? 
  he ca n't be genuine in saying it looks better , this is suspicious . 
  if you 're too lazy to look through the video see [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7cjh93j.png ) and [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bgdvmst.png ) . 
  this are n't drops either . 
  you can pretty much see the counter at double digits most of the time . 
  ** kanker ** [ * k-ah-ng-kerr * ] ( cancer ) , ** tering ** [ * teer-ing * ] ( tubercolosis ) , ** tyfus ** [ * teef-us * ] ( typhoid ) , ** klere ** [ * clear-ruh * ] ( cholera ) , ** pest ** ( plague ) , ** pokke ** [ * pock-uh * ] ( smallpox ) , ** mongool ** [ * mon-gggg-ole * ] ( down syndrome ) ... 
  * etc. 
  are all * very * common swearwords in dutch . 
  pronounciation added for your convenience . 
  hope your so wakes up to at least a * `` kankerteringtyfusmongool '' * tomorrow . 
  some things are hard to hear because they have a very very thick accent and the grammar is n't always correct . 
  ** santa ** : hello !, 
  i 'm happy you 've come . 
  ** girl ** : oh , you * are * sinterklaas !, 
  i knew it !, 
  i knew for sure you would understand !, 
  ** santa ** : of course !, 
  tell me what you want [ for christmas ] ... to sinterklaas . 
  ** girl ** : nothing !, 
  i have a lot of things . 
  i only want to be with this nice lady . 
  ** santa ** : would you like to sing something for me ? 
  they then both sing the most famous sinterklaas song called * `` sinterklaas kapoentje '' * ( with some minor errors ) , it goes :, 
  * throw something in my ( little ) shoe , *, 
  * throw something in my ( little ) boot , *, 
  * thank you ( little ) sinterklaas !, 
  `` kapoentje '' does n't really mean anything and is only ever used in this song . 
  important is just that it rhymes with `` schoentje '' . 
   im not too familiar with black pete and from the quick google search i dont find anything wrong with it . 
  why are people protesting it exactly ? 
  the only thing i found is something about `` racial stereotypes '' . 
  i mean , yes hes black but what about it ? 
  well hit me with a switch and call me * stout * ... you might be the first foreigner i 've seen who does n't think it 's blatantly offensive . 
  if you 're curious ( and i 'm not going to go into too much detail here because i 'll start a flame war ) , black pete is sinterklaas 's ( equivalent of santa ) helper . 
  combined with his stereotypical appearance ( ` blackface ' , but arguably from a different origin ) he 's often regarded as an image of slavery , which is a sensitive topic either way because of dutch colonial history . 
  each year during the holidays there are protests and riots of people that seek to change his skin colour or remove him altogether , or from people that want to keep the tradition as is . 
   and our cultural traditions and identity are disregarded . 
  european folklore is looked down upon . 
  for example dutch zwarte piet/black pete is on the verge of getting outlawed as being racist , while 80 % of the population is n't even aware about the centuries old germanic traditions from which it evolved ( wild hunt ) . 
  it 's not racist , never was . 
  there 's a beautiful story to be told there . 
  if this is true i think the statistic might be closer to 100 % . 
  i 've never heard anyone ever bring up the wild hunt , and i 've read up about black pete 's origins a lot . 
  any chance you have a source or referral for me to read more about this ? 
  thank you !, 
  oughta keep me occupied for a bit . 
  yeah that 's likely it 's origin . 
  later it was used to mean ` rascal ' , popularised by a certain book , but i thought it was too confusing to explain . 
  regardless , the word is no longer used by anyone today except for in this song . 
  i 'm confused . 
  there 's a message exactly like that just before the final battle ... 
  it says to finish all your business in velen and skellige because there is no turning back . 
  is that not what you wanted ? 
  dat heeft evenveel tekens en `` m ` n '' met de apostrophe is correct nederlands . 
  it does n't necessarily have to be replaced , we just have to shift its focus . 
  right now capitalism is focused more on selling goods and services , but aside from repair and maintenance jobs required to keep an automated society running , we could shift our focus on doing research and ` volunteering ' for tests and missions . 
  sure , capitalism might not be the best option here , but it might be easier to keep the system already in place as opposed to change to a new one . 
  it could be possible to market and ` sell ' research , data , and human testing . 
  in the end , a human society ( even automated ) will always have a large ` human ' factor . 
  machines are n't humans , and can therefore not do everything in a human society . 
  it 's possible machines will never be able to accomplish anything on the field of social , culture , entertainment , philosophy , etc. 
  i absolutely love this idea , but i had to refund my purchase after i just could n't get it to work . 
  aside from the fact that the joystick and controller support is a huge hassle to install ( an error message told me to manually install drivers with an expired link ) , i tried games that have keyboard support like vivecraft ( shown in demo as well ) , but none of it worked . 
  great concept , but regrettably does n't work . 
  i 'm the exact opposite , i think it 's genius and i love it .
