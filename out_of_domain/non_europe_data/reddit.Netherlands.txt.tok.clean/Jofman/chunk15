  i 'm thinking of doing the rr every day since i have a lot of free time , but after my first time yesterday i 'm sore as hell . 
  will this be a good idea or will i just trouble myself ? 
  any way of splitting the rr into different exercises for different days to split the muscle groups ? 
  that makes sense . 
  i 'll probably stick to cardio on the rest days then since i also need quite a bit of weight loss, 
  it 's ctrl +1 through ctrl +5 . 
  it should be in the controls . 
  yeah i 'm guessing that glitch of late where you 're pretty much assigned a random seat when you get in has n't helped you much :p they should really get on fixing that, 
  i considered naming it `` pushing a boat back in dacia '' , but figured the pun would 've been a little too farfetched . 
  that 's a uaz actually, 
  `` aggressively hate on women '', 
  come on that 's a little bit of a fucking stretch do n't you think, 
  it 's making fun of a trope and in no way makes any kind of statement . 
  y' all are taking this wayy too seriously in here . 
  are you sure ? 
  they 're named `` wash bears '' in many languages , that 'd be quite the fuckup if that was based on a misconception . 
  you could argue that they do not really ` wash ' their food for the same purpose we do ( to clean it ) , but they still perform the * act * of washing . 
  not really no , that video pronounces a ` sh ' but it 's a sharp s. 
  the burden of proof does n't rest on the accused , that 's ridiculous . 
  all right , let me start off with saying that i 'm not sure if these issues are intentional and completely thought through by riot , or if it 's an unintentional effect of how the item works . 
  i 'm talking about how luden 's echo adds stacks . 
  as we all know , it does this on a spell cast ( 20 stacks per spell ) and on champion movement . 
  however , if the spell is a blink or dash , it grants the 20 stacks + the stacks from the * travelled distance * . 
  [ here 's an example . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/41nyxhi.webm ) beware of large file size , i do n't know how to make gifs . 
  also , sorry the luden 's stacks are barely readable , i. ... do n't know how to make gifs :(, 
  as you can see , when i cast w it grants 20 stacks , but when i cast e it gives me 40 . 
  you can see that as i walk back the distance of the e gives you 20 stacks when walking . 
  i know the item is supposed to be strong on mobile champions , but especially in cases like katarina with her e and passive , or akali with her unlimited dashes i feel like it 's too much . 
  also , another thing : as you can see in the gif , the spell that * triggers * the luden 's echo and applies the extra damage * also * gives another 20 stacks . 
  now that i 'm writing this post i 'm 90 % sure all of this is intentional , but i think it could be a good way to turn down the item , because personally i think it 's a bit too strong . 
  make blink/dash abilities give reduced stacks from distance traveled , or make the trigger ability not give any stacks . 
  take the poll here : https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bufhonbwbbhy_83sdrneqyx5yofa4aitxm7kxis4a-8/viewform?usp=send_form, 
  so there 's been a lot of discussion about what type of content should be allowed on / r/leagueoflegends . 
  i thought it 'd be a good idea to get some actual data to help the mods . 
  i tried posting it on the main sub before but i think people got quite fed up with the meta posts at that point . 
  you can perform the result statistics yourself , btw . 
  * name : jofman, 
  * steam : http://steamcommunity.com/id/jofman/, 
  * experience : none in competitive . 
  1826 hours on tf2 . 
  coming back from a long break but picking up fast and i want to try out the competitive scene, 
  * time zone : gmt +1, 
  * availability : it 's holiday so basically all day from noon till 4am . 
  ( note : will be gone from 27 july - 3rd of august ), 
  * age : 20, 
  i 've been loving tf2 again , but i wan na take the next step . 
  finding servers where people actually play the game is hard yo , and pubs do n't do it for me anymore . 
  about my class skills : i think i 'm best at heavy and engie , but i realise that 's not meta and i 'm really interested in 6 's , although i 'm definitely open to try hl too . 
  in 6 's i 'd probably do best as either demo or scout . 
  but yeah , i 'm pretty open to anything really , could do well as soldier or medic too . 
  i 'm completely new so let me know if you 're missing some info . 
  i have no idea how this works .

  as mentioned before i want all the newest things on ultra . 
  ** what is your budget ( ballpark is okay ) ? 
  not sure , probably around $ 2000 ( = $ 2188,20 , but hardware is generally more expensive in eu ) for the full build . 
  this includes peripherals and monitor . 
  ** in what country are you purchasing your parts ? 
  the netherlands . 
  if it helps here are some pricechecking websites :, 
  http://tweakers.net/pricewatch/ ( < -- best one ),
