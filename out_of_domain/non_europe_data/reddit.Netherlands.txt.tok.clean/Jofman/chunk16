  ** provide any additional details you wish below . 
  here are the things i 'm currently unsure about :, 
  gpu-wise i think a 980ti might be overkill . 
  however i like the extra vram on it as i can see games rapidly increasing their demand . 
  also i 'm not completely sure about the requirements of 144hz gaming . 
  i find it really hard to find a cpu that matches the gpu nicely . 
  i sorta just picked the most popular one but i keep hearing i7 's are unnecessary for gaming . 
  i always have in the back of my mind that disk size affects loading times , but i ca n't remember if i made it up or actually heard it somewhere credible . 
  can someone tell me if 2x1tb is better than 1x2tb ? 
  also , i 'm probably going for the 256gb ssd . 
  i have one in my current pc and althought i do fill it up , i feel that 250gb extra is a bit much . 
  motherboard is kinda cheap , i realize this . 
  should i pick something more expensive more friendly to upgrades down the road ? 
  like i said , i 'm still deciding on a monitor , and whether to go with higher resolution or higher refresh rate . 
  i 'm leaning towards 144hz because it 's a more universal upgrade since not everything supports 1440p yet . 
  other monitors i was looking at were acer gn246hl and acer g257hu . 
  the keyboard is set in stone . 
  i have one right now and it 's fine . 
  i just really need identical keyboards to not screw myself over when switching constantly . 
  also i do n't want any logitech . 
  i 've had it up to here with their software , pardon my rage . 
  any feedback is highly appreciated !, 
  also even though my budget is large i 'm certainly not rich . 
  any money-saving alternatives are appreciated . 
  edit : added local prices, 
  hey / r/monitors , i 'd love your opinion on my next pc build . 
  basically i 'm building a new pc with a 980ti , but because of the high cost i do n't have much left for a monitor . 
  however i feel like 1080@60 would really make the entire gpu purchase a waste . 
  i 'm thinking of trying either 1440p or 144hz . 
  i could probably run both , but those monitors are just so damn expensive . 
  what do you recommend , pixels or frequency ? 
  what monitor would do my 980ti justice for a decent price . 
  ( might be willing to go $ 300 if i really have to ), 
  bonus question ; how important are gsync and freesync when running higher refresh rates ? 
  i hear so much about freesync , would i need an amd card to effectively run above 60hz ? 
  hey there ,, 
  so right now i 'm trying to build my second pc . 
  it 's been so long since i did this though ( 4 years ) , so i had to completely get into it all over again . 
  it 'd be great if any of you could look it over and tell me if i ( probably ) missed something somewhere . 
  any moneysaving alternatives are always welcome as well . 
  i 'll be using this build for high-end gaming . 
  i 'm putting it at a new location so it uncludes monitor and peripherals . 
  my budget was around 2000 $ / $ . 
  i tried going skylake + ddr4 so i wont have to upgrade my motherboard in a couple of years .

  some quick notes : the mouse will be a cm strom alcor , but pcpartpicker did n't have it . 
  i 'll be buying the cpu boxed , and upgrade to a better cooler once i need it . 
  i also realize it 's a bit of a waste to pick a 1080@60 monitor , but i 'll be saving up for a better one ( probably 144hz ) , and then put this one at my current pc . 
  also , because i 'll be buying the parts in the netherlands , please use [ this ] ( http://tweakers.net/pricewatch/ ) website to check prices and availability ( type search entry into the `` zoek een product '' bar ) . 
  do n't bother calculating in the shipping costs as the website got a handy tool to calculate which parts to order where for minimal shipping costs . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rjcqv1r.png?1 ) 's a screenshot of my build on that website , including the dutch prices . 
  the thing i 'm most concerned about is the psu , i 'd love to know if i made the right call there .
