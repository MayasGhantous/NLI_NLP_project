  well , i see your point . 
  i , as well , welcome aggressive competition , and i guess they 're not really doing anything illegal . 
  however , i personally do n't think this is the right way to do it . 
  exclusivity is a bad thing . 
  and that 's what this is going to turn into if you 'd have amd counter by doing the same thing , and extrapolate a little bit . 
  it could potentially cause a split where we get nvidia and amd exclusives . 
  and that 's not a world i want to live in . 
  it 's complicated , as they ca n't really compete and cooperate at the same time , but i respect amd for its values , with openness and accessibility being two of them . 
   crying that they are too good, 
  i just ... really ? 
  i do n't believe i 've ever seen someone misinterpret something harder . 
  i ` lll admit that the witcher 3 looks better in outdoor scenes , but even then it 's a shame how indoor scenes look so bad they 're comparable to the witcher 1 . 
  also , to people claiming it 's a console screenshot on the right , it might , but i advise you to watch a ps4 to pc comparison . 
  they 're awfully close in quality . 
  ( regardless , i think ps4 will run both those games at the shown settings so the argument is still valid ), 
  personally i 'd say $ 13 is perfectly reasonable . 
  hell , i 'd * easily * buy it for $ 15 . 
  one thing i 'd love to see with these type of multiplayer arena games is a 4-pack or something , so i can convince my friends to buy it too , 
  oh cool , that 's good news !, 
  nowadays it seems only the games that are strictly 4-player games get the pack deals . 
  i wish it was on more multiplayer-focused games , even if the player count is n't clearly defined . 
  ** the witcher **, 
  after buying the witcher 3 and hearing that the combat is n't as good as expected , and i 'm also not very blown away by the graphics , i decided the story was what had to do it for me . 
  and what better way than to start at the beginning . 
  i got ta say , the story is really what 's got ta do it for you , but oh boy it does it well . 
  i was planning on rushing through the main storyline of 1 and 2 , but i just ca n't help myself doing every little sidequest , despite the endlessly slow walking and a combat system that feels like i 'm playing runescape . 
  it 's just that the quests are so interesting and really tie everything together . 
  the way you constantly have to make large decisions makes you really want to get to the bottom of things via the sidequests so you can have a better understanding as to what 's going on . 
  if the other games are anything like this , but with combat improved , you can be sure as hell i 'm gon na 100 % those bad boys . 
  ** team fortress 2 **, 
  i 've been watching all the new ** overwatch ** footage lately and it really got me hyped up . 
  it got me thinking of the good old days when i would just play tf2 24/7 . 
  i love that game , the class-diversity makes it so much more fun than things like call of dullty and boretlefield . 
  they took it a bit too far though imo with the complete spam of new weapons and apparal , which completely ruined the style and ambience of it . 
  so i stopped playing quite a while ago . 
  but i decided to go back in again and i 've really been enjoying myself . 
  it 's still pretty solid , especially on vanilla servers ( if you can find any ) . 
  why ? 
  why did i never think of doing this ? 
  this is brilliant . 
  of course , i 'm not counting on this poll to give rock hard , trustworthy , representative data . 
  i 'm just hoping to provide a little bit more insight , on whatever area that may be . 
  this poll should n't be taken as evidence or support for a new set of rules , but rather as an indication of re-evaluation of the rules , whenever a part of the results strongly contradicts them . 
  i think that might be a bit too specific . 
  this is about what * type * of content people want . 
  whether that content should be a link or a self post is a whole other discussion of itself . 
  the difference is that one set an unrealistic expectation , and the other a ( probably ) realistic one . 
  i really like the colours of the second one , but the colour of the glow around ekko is a bit off . 
  also i feel like the glow is too much in general , try a bit less , or even just an outline or shadow . 
  also , even though the colours of the border really fit , they kind of blend in with the colors of summoners rift . 
  perhaps an extra outline for clearer seperation ? 
  overall pretty smooth though , the new hud is much more streamlined it seems and you made good use of it . 
  this is my main complaint . 
  it swipes back when i 'm trying to scroll all the time . 
  7267 , ~ ~ kerbal space program ~ ~ . 
  actually i 'm just gon na play for the controller if that 's okay . 
  i have enough games already and i 'd rather that prize go to someone else who 'll enjoy it more . 
  ( incidentally , can someone explain if it 's possible to easily search all the comments , to see if my number 's taken , and how to do so ? ), 
  hmm , i always thought tracer 's accent sounded pretty forced ( not real british ) , and her delivery was kinda bland . 
  i agree with your point though . 
  i 'll add that i particularly like a bit of character interaction ( e.g. 
  the `` zank yu enginier '' in tf2 when using teleporters ) . 
  but i also feel like they should n't overdo it , it can become distracting pretty quickly . 
  and i think they already have a few funny lines in there , like mccree says something like `` it 's high noon somewhere !, 
  oh wow this makes it even better !, 
  yup , feeling . 
  to put it bluntly , shadow of the colossus ( their previous game ) makes you feel ` small ' , which is a feeling i 've never gotten from a game before . 
  that coupled with one of the most interesting game-mechanics i 've ever seen ( being the physics-based climbing of ` walking platforms ' ) makes these my favourite games . 
  i can 100 % understand how it looks boring to newcomers . 
  keep in mind though you never actually lose control ( if it 's anything like the previous games ) . 
  when the boy is on the tail it looks like some sort of cutscene is happening , but he 's actually still trying to climb and hold on to the beast . 
  i 'm dutch ( close enough , right ? 
  ) , so i do n't know exactly , but in my experience germans just do n't like being recorded in public . 
  it kinda goes to show if you look at the google streetview coverage in europe [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4j8egsi.jpg ) . 
  this was a pleasant suprise . 
  does anyone know if there is any chance of a red orchestra 3 ? 
  i 'm not sure how exactly they are connected , as they 're part of the same game on steam . 
  i 've always preferred it over rising storm , and ro3 would be a dream come true . 
  also , even though i 'm very interested in this game because of the previous ones , was anybody extremely underwhelmed by this trailer ? 
  the big reason i wanted another one in this series was because of graphical updates , since their gameplay is absolutely fine , but it seems nothing has changed in that department . 
  excited , but not impressed . 
  i might get in a bit of trouble for this ... 
  but honestly : half life, 
  4 ) tahm eats kalista and ults away, 
  6 ) 4 man teleport profit, 
  honest question , are they selected by their height ? 
  they all seem to be about equally tall , or are they organized from short to tall so that it only increases gradually ? 
  i think the most important thing to note is that those excessive trippy visuals of trees with tongues twirling into space safari 's * can * happen ( although usually to a much lesser degree ) , but if they do they occur mostly in your thoughts . 
  what you see with your eyes is just every patterns turning into ` fractals ' , kind of . 
  everything starts flowing and moving and twirling . 
  you get real sensitive to colors and vibes . 
  visuals is just a tiny part of course . 
  there 's also a lot of deep thoughts and philosophical questions . 
  the thing that surprised me the most ( shrooms ) was that everything * felt * absolutely amazing . 
  i was just walking around the room rubbing everything . 
  i was holding a blanket and it felt as if my fingers constantly moved through the fabric and back . 
  also if your listening to music the beat dictates everything . 
  tl ; dr all your senses get ` twirly ' , including your mind, 
  this really is quite the damn hassle . 
  but hey after all these times i can now put up / break down my setup in less than 2 minutes .
