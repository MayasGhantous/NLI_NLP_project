   g.h. 
   president of tax authorities / surcharges, 
  that should cover it, 
  while i do agree that r6siege is a relatively simple game for a substantial amount of money , i 'm not quite sure ` more content ' is going to work . 
  siege is a pretty technical game that requires some level of knowledge about all the game 's assets . 
  i 've played over 25 hours now and i still get confused by the building layout almost every game . 
  i have a feeling putting more maps and operators in rotation would n't really benefit a game like this . 
  that 's not to say it 's a fair deal , or that there 's not a way to fix it . 
  i 'd be okay with a few more gamemodes , but overall i think they should have just sold it for $ 40 . 
  that price is justifiable imo . 
  it 's a good game ( if they fix their shit network ) , great with friends . 
  i paid $ 40 at release and do n't regret it in the least . 
  i feel so bad evolve got it * that * bad . 
  it really did n't deserve to die that way . 
  it was a very unique and well executed game . 
  i think the marketing aspect was a large part of its demise ... but i do n't think it was everything . 
  there 's just something about the lack of variety that made it bore way too quickly for everyone . 
  titanfall , for example , did n't have an * as terrible * marketing plan , but still fell on its ass very similarly to evolve . 
  hell , i loved evolve to death and even i do n't feel like playing anymore , even though i ca n't really name bad things about the game ... 
  also , we really need more asymmetrical multiplayer games . 
  personally i throw in a bag of taco spices and some pineapple chunks . 
  but the real kicker ( for me ) is the cheese sauce i always make . 
  just slowly melt several cheddar slices in some cream on a very low fire until it gets thick enough . 
  pour over chilli , scoop up with nachos . 
  fuck , i 'm hungry ... 
  i really liked the movie , but man , phasma was such a major letdown . 
  i wanted to see more cool stuff from the dark side . 
  kyloren was interesting , but not very badass . 
  all the generals are just generals and not doing any fighting ( and the hitler scene was almost comical ) , and we only saw snoke making a few skypecalls . 
  i was really hoping for an awesome mini-boss , a new boba fett ( but with a more epic final battle ) . 
  instead we get phasma , the highest ranking trooper , intimidated into dooming her entire army by a simple death threat and then just casually cast away with a jokey reference . 
  really a missed opportunity . 
  phasma does n't necessarily have to borrow screentime from ren . 
  they could 've cut out all the general talk , the hitler speech , or even make phasma that trooper with the elbow-swivel lightning stick that battles finn . 
  there were plenty of chances for her to make an appearance . 
  exactly !, 
  i do n't know what they 've got planned for her , but that elbow-spinny-lightning rod could 've totally been her trademark weapon . 
  i thought that thing was really awesome . 
  seeing a regular trooper use it , and him recognizing finn felt so random ... 
  we 're mammals , primates , apes , great apes , specifically . 
  all correct . 
  * indeed , though . 
  can you elaborate on this , though ? 
  well now you 're really just shamelessly copying our * sinterklaas * ... 
  yeah !, 
  sinterklaas ( contraction of ` sint nikolaas ' ) is an old dutch tradition and served as the main inspiration for the american santa , from overall looks till chimney-presents . 
  i just found it very interesting you mentioned the knocking , as i 've never heard of it in a christmas context . 
  it 's definitely part of the sinterklaas tradition . 
  it 's even mentioned in a few sinterklaas carols . 
  the story is that throughout the weeks leading up to december 5th , the sint has his helper black pete ( do n't ask , that 's a discussion for a whole other time ) climb down the chimney and put small presents in children 's shoes . 
  but december 5th is the big night . 
  children anxiously stay up until sint & pete knock loudly on their door , leaving a large burlap sack filled with gifts and littering the ground with hard candy . 
  i 'm not sure if your family got it from the dutch tradition , as it 's really just the easiest and most exciting way to deliver presents while the children are already up , but i found it funny nonetheless . 
  ordering parts and building it yourself is way cheaper . 
  i promise you 'll learn a lot from it too . 
  it 's a lot easier than most people think , as it 's mostly just putting the stuff in the right slot . 
  that said , there are some steps where you need to know what you 're doing ( e.g. 
  cpu and cooler ) , but there are plenty of generic build guides online that should cover the basics . 
  besides that you should be fine if you follow the manuals for each part . 
  just hit install on every game you want to be downloaded and it will push them into a queue . 
  you can view it by pressibg the `` downloading 1 of 3 items '' white text in the bottom of the client . 
  is ... is that not normal ? 
  wait , buying plastic bags for 25 cents is n't standard ? 
  it 's always been like that here ( holland ) . 
  i bring bags whenever i can and if i need one i buy it . 
  what 's the problem with that ? 
  25 cents really is n't much , and i make way less than you . 
  just how often do you go for groceries ? 
  yeah , it 's weird . 
  sometimes it even glitched out and let me control 2 players at once . 
  i will try the button mapper for x360 tomorrow . 
  i did try to map all the steam controller buttons to the keyboard layout in the overlay-configurator , but it still seems to send the ' i am player 1 and joystick 0 ' attitude when i activate it , so that does n't work . 
  i have my doubts about the x360 remap working too , as it 's completely nonresponsive in my case . 
  even when i try to rebind the keys in lethal league it just doesnt register any button presses . 
  i 've tried both the default template , as well as mapping the sc to the keyboard inputs . 
  ahh , it seems like this is it . 
  i guess all we can do is hope valve and the game-specific devs become aware and work together to fix this problem . 
  i get the idea that most people claiming a ` fix ' being a certain activation order or something like that are trying it on different games . 
  the only supposed fix i was n't able to test was to connect 2 steam controllers , then adding the x360 and disabling one of the sc 's . 
  thanks for all the info !, 
  i tried your first solution already , but it does n't work ( at least not in lethal league ) . 
  i 've tried every possible order of activating controllers one after another but the x360 ** always ** becomes unresponsive after activating the sc . 
  interestingly , lethal league * does * use the ` press a to join ' mechanic , but it does n't seem to help . 
  it 's also interesting you say rocket league causes a lot of the same problems , as it also has a ` press a to join ' mechanic that you mentioned usually acts as a workaround .
