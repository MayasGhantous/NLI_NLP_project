  ** [ explanation ] ( http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070210.html ) : ** the center of our milky way galaxy is hidden from the prying eyes of optical telescopes by clouds of obscuring dust and gas . 
  but in this stunning vista , the spitzer space telescope 's infrared cameras , penetrate much of the dust revealing the stars of the crowded galactic center region . 
  a mosaic of many smaller snapshots , the detailed , false-color image shows older , cool stars in bluish hues . 
  reddish glowing dust clouds are associated with young , hot stars in stellar nurseries . 
  the galactic center lies some 26,000 light-years away , toward the constellation sagittarius . 
  at that distance , this picture spans about 900 light-years . 
  please stop mentioning that goddamn movie : /,

  i know it 's not metal , but i assumed most akerfeldt/wilson fans would be in this subreddit . 
  stop bitching dude , if you would read the next sentence `` it is not a place to bury music you do n't like , '' and shut up we 'll all be fine . 
  not all the music you know is known by everyone . 
  also : `` if our ` hot ' page is too mainstream for your tastes , you 'll find more obscure music on the ` new ' page . '',
