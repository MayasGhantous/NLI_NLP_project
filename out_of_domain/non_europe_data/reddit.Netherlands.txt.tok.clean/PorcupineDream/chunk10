  wow , never expected to see my local club mentioned here !, 
  haha , the only time nac is on the / r/soccer frontpage is when ajax scores a beautiful goal against them , that zlatan goal from 10 years back comes to mind too . 
  anyways , enjoy your 4th championship in a row , it 's starting to get a bit monotonous in the eredivisie , 
  fantastic atmosphere man , captures the mood her set perfectly . 
  it 's not hansa , it 's [ aass ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aass_brewery ) . 
  sounds like fun to me .

  holland is fucking shite nowadays , not even van gaal can make a proper team out of a bunch of eredivisie players and rvp and robben . 
  it 's been almost 2 years since i was a submitter on this fantastic sub , but i feel like giving it a shot again !, 
  # ** popular : ** [ slowdive - souvlaki space station ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0lio138z-a ) [ shoegaze/dream pop ] ( 1993 ) . 
  slowdive 's '93 release souvlaki is one of the landmark albums for the short-lived but highly influential shoegaze movement . 
  a user on rym hits the nail on its head with this comment : '' * if loveless is the noisy side of the coin , souvlaki is the dreamy side . 
  yes it is a beautiful coin . 
  # ** catchy : ** [ spiritualized - come together ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nzoz_5hlxg ) [ neo-psychedelia/space rock ] ( 1997 ) . 
  an incredible track of one of the greatest and most immersive space rock albums of all time , * ladies and gentlemen we are floating in space * . 
  # ** obscure ** : [ the greg foat group - uncle bessie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smxyvazrz04 ) [ psychedelic jazz ] ( 2011 ) . 
  this whole album is one bizarre , mental trip through the entire universe with one of the most unique mixes of psychedelia and jazz i 've ever heard . 
  ridiculously underexposed : this is a band that * needs * to heard by a greater audience , they deserve it . 
  that laszlo track is incredible , thank you for that one !,

  i 'm very honoured to have won last election , this is going to be fun !, 
  i start of this month with the greatest band of the netherlands , de staat ( `` the state '' ) . 
  they 're already one of the biggest band here , and it 's time they 're gon na reach a greater audience . 
  this song comes from their third and best album i_con , which they released last year . 
  the whole record is a unique mix of psychedelic , groovy and catchy-as-hell songs with influences ranging from tom waits and nick cave to qotsa to african guitar music . 
  hawk house is a hip hop/jazz/soul group from london , and one of the smoothest currently out there . 
  inspired by the roots , a tribe called quest , j dilla etc. 
  they released their first mixtape last year , that you can download [ here ] ( http://mixtapemadness.co.uk/hawkhouse/alittlemoreelbowroom/1215 ) , i highly recommend checking them out . 
  snowmine is an psychedelic indie pop band from brooklyn that should be way more popular than they currently are . 
  their album dialects came out earlier this year , and contributes perfectly to a certain sound i 've been hearing more recently at other records like real estate 's atlas , the fantastic new war on drugs album : lost in the dream , and damien jurado 's incredible newest album . 
  if you dig this snowmine song i highly recommend checking out those 3 artists . 
  another great song by snowmine is [ let me in ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiqqcjmzavm ) from their debut record , which has less of a psychedelic/ambient vibe like their newest . 
  the lush melodies are still ever so present on this record . 
  hiatus kaiyote is a neo-soul band from melbourne with one of the most progressive sounds i 've heard in a very long time . 
  their debut album hawk tomahawk came out last year and the song nakamarra featuring q-tip got nominated for a grammy for best r&b performance , which they lost to another fantastic band , [ snarky puppy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sjigtle0hc ) . 
  i highly recommend checking their album hawk tomahawk out , it 's one of my favourite releases of 2013 . 
  thank you for posting that bosnian rainbows song , really a neat track . 
  by the way , is your name a reference to that great tallest man on earth song ? 
  oh cool , i 'll check them out !, 
  steve reich is my favourite classical composer and one of the most influential and unique artists of the 20th century . 
  if you dig this composition i recommend checking out his magnus opus [ music for 18 musicians ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxjwo2fq16c ) . 
  bran 's going to be the first man entering the moon door from the other side, 
  avishai cohen is my favourite contemporary jazz musician . 
  he is a bassist from israel and one of the forerunners of the great nu jazz movement of the last ~ 15 years . 
  his ability to mix virtuosity with beautiful harmonies and melodies is nearly unsurpassed . 
  i highly recommend checking out his album gently disturbed , and if you dig that his whole discography , he never fails to impress . 
  you mean the trumpet player ? 
  i have in fact , such a coincidence that two great jazz musicians share the same name . 
  check out tigran hamasyan , he 's a fantastic armenian jazz pianist influenced by meshuggah . 
  [ this is a great solo performance by him ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvn36ou4buu ) , and [ this is a more prog-influenced track with his band ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psjwrgkail4 ) . 
  glad you like it !, 
  wowow , please do n't start that discussion again , ok ? 
  how would you even dare putting them in one genre like that ? 
  djent is as far i know a subgenre that came forth from math/prog and death metal ( and is indeed coined by fredrik ) , so it 's both right i 'd say . 
  furthermore , check out their [ last.fm tags ] ( http://www.last.fm/music/meshuggah/+tags ) , looks all right to me . 
  woah bredanaars on reddit ? 
  :d are you from breda ? 
  yes i am too !, 
  what school did you attend ? 
  ahh i went to the stedelijk ( sounds fucking weird in english ) . 
  currently studying and living in utrecht , but still proud of the pearl of the south :'), 
  finished it one year ago , and i started there in 2007 . 
  an incredible band from norway with a unique mix of post-rock and jazz . 
  this song is the opener of their fantastic album what we must , i highly recommend checking that one out . 
  their latest album one-armed bandit is a bit more rhythm-focused , i really dig [ this track ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk2npil42tw ) of that , it has a great steve reich-vibe going on . 
  ( i prefer the studio version of that one though , but it was n't available on youtube ), 
  i was planning on posting a nat king cole song , but i figured a french song from that era would be more interesting for the american reddit audience . 
  he 's very well known here in the netherlands as he is from belgium , but could an american redditor tell me how grand his legacy is in the usa ? 
  anyways , i hope you enjoy the fantastic and unsurpassed delivery of this legendary musician . 
  how long have you been watching the world cup ? 
  i saw him perform last year in a completely dark and seated theatre with an incredible sound system . 
  one of the if not the greatest show i 've ever experienced . 
  woah this is great , thanks !, 
  i fucking love the intro and the weird grooves , i 'll check out some other stuff by them . 
  that 's funk ostenta\u00e7\u00e3o , a subgenre that 's only ~ 6 years old . 
  no idea why they call that shit funk , it sounds aweful . 
  curate, 
  you wo n't be disappointed !,
