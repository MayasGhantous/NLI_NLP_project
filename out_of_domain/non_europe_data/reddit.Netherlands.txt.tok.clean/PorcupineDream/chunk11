  i saw them last week at a festival and they were the only band to play an encore there , the crowd loved it . 
  even kurt vile dropped by to play a few songs with them too , incredible . 
  [ discogs link ] ( http://www.discogs.com/various-mask-100/release/19797 ) to that compilation . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://bocpages.org/wiki/korona ) the bocpages entry to the song . 
  i saw the track has n't been submitted before to this sub , so most of you probably have n't heard this one before . 
  i see david linklater has n't been mentioned yet . 
  his latest feature [ boyhood ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1065073/ ) is one of the greatest films i 've seen in a while . 
  his before ... trilogy is superb as well . 
  wong kar-wai has made some fantastic films too , [ in the mood for love ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118694/?ref_=nm_knf_t1 ) is incredible . 
  thomas vinterberg 's [ festen ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0154420/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_13 ) and [ jagten ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2106476/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_2 ) are a must-watch . 
  and to stay in the trend of non-american directors , [ paolo sorrentino ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0815204/ ) and [ jacques audiard ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002191/?ref_=tt_ov_dr ) and great too . 
  kingsday is nowadays celebrated on april the 27th , the birthday of the dutch king willem-alexander .

  * todd terje - it 's album time, 
  not all music has artistic intentions though . 
  this is incredible , thanks for sharing man !, 
  i had no idea vaporwave could be so atmospheric and coherent , definitely a genre i need to check out more . 
  do you have any recommendations for starters like me ? 
  the movie is incredible indeed !, 
  though i think it 's not necessarily better than the book , the book is a perfect complement to the film with a lot of background information and different perspectives . 
  what 's wrong with seeking attention when you 're a band that wants to get heard ? 
  woah that local natives vid is incredible , thanks for that !, 
  i really love [ the video la blogoth\u00e8que did with lianne la havas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f845_v41yfo ) , such a fantastic , warm summer evening vibe going on there in montmartre . 
  you seem like a very negative person . 
  change that attitude man , there 's nothing wrong with spreading some musical love on the streets . 
  excellent suggestion man , really digging this . 
  fuck me , i 'm late to the party . 
  nevertheless , i hope i can still make a valid contribution to my favourite top of the year list . 
  i do n't really get why people feel a need to share their appreciation for albums like todd terje , aphex twin or run the jewels that everyone knows about already . 
  those are great records , but do n't need that much more exposure . 
  i 'll try to add some less known albums to the list . 
  [ teen creeps - ep ] ( http://teencreeps.bandcamp.com/ ) [ alt noise garage rock / punk ] [ 115 last.fm listeners ] ( http://www.last.fm/music/teen+creeps ), 
  let 's start it of with some really obscure stuff . 
  teen creeps is a band from belgium , whose only release so far is this great compact ep . 
  their music is inspired by bands like dinosaur jr. , sonic youth and more contemporary artists like fidlar and ty segall . 
  [ gideon van gelder - lighthouse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6a4gcimjla ) [ jazz ] [ 418 last.fm listeners ] ( http://www.last.fm/music/gideon+van+gelder ), 
  a dutch jazz pianist that has been lauded by one of the biggest newspapers of the country , but besides that has n't much received much exposure at all . 
  a great shame , as his album lighthouse is one of the greatest jazz records i 've heard in a long time . 
  his music reminds me of artists like avishai cohen ( bassist ) and greg foat , another scandalously overlooked jazz genius . 
  [ strand - strand ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pps3blnbby ) [ folk / acoustic ] [ 514 last.fm listeners ] ( http://www.last.fm/music/strand ), 
  strand is the artist name of bert dockx from flying horsemen and dans dans from antwerpen , belgium . 
  on strand he only accompanies himself with sober guitar playing , putting the focus on the poetic lyrics . 
  this one may be hard to appreciate if you do n't understand the lyrics , put i recommend giving it a chance anyway . 
  - tayi bebba ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4sdickdz4m ) [ trap / world ] [ 6k last.fm listeners ] ( http://www.last.fm/music/clap!+clap ! ), 
  if lord of the flies were a rave party , this would be the soundtrack . 
  it 's a bizarre mix of african tribal rhythms and progressive future beats . 
  check out [ this site ] ( http://www.tayibebba.com/ ) for the fantastic stories that accompany the music . 
  [ traams - cissa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn-fieiyg6w ) [ garage rock / post-punk ] [ 11k last.fm listeners ] ( http://www.last.fm/music/traams ), 
  traams is a band from england whose ep cissa has been on constant rotation for me this year . 
  the way they manage to create such a full and energetic atmosphere with only three musicians makes them really stand out amongst the current wave of garage bands . 
  [ jungle by night - the hunt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r41dvlbgm54 ) [ afrobeat / jazz ] [ 15k last.fm listeners ] ( http://www.last.fm/music/jungle+by+night?ac=jungle%20by%20night ), 
  a fantastic dutch band that has impressed the dutch music press the past few years with their enigmatic mix of afrobeat and ethiopian jazz . 
  their latest album sees them taking a more electronic direction , but the groove and brass sections remain ever so strong . 
  nails are essential for a round and warm tone . 
  if you want to get more serious with playing classical guitar , i highly recommend growing nails . 
  they do n't need to be very long , if they peek just above your fingertips when you look at your fingers it 's fine . 
  i play asturias completely p i m , although you could play some parts p m a. i prefer to keep it p i m throughout the whole piece , for more constant dynamics and pace . 
  hmm , i have no idea how to speed up growing your nails . 
  it might take a month or so to get them to a reasonable length , give it some time . 
  good luck practising !, 
  almost correct , the band is created and led by [ sinkane ] ( http://www.last.fm/music/sinkane ) , a superb musician whose latest release mean love i highly recommend checking out if you dig onyeabor . 
  david byrne did collaborate with them though , such as at the performance at jimmy fallon . 
  mammal hands and gogo penguin are great !, 
  portico quartet is fantastic as well . 
  oh and check out polar bear too , great experimental jazz band . 
  fantastic comment , thanks a lot for your contribution , 
  i 'd love to hear more about your extensive knowledge on math and economics . 
  please elaborate . 
   if these migrants were all here to work like people like you like to claim the taxes would actually be going down proportional to how much they were putting into system . 
  however you know , that involves maths and knowledge of economics and you do n't seem to give a fuck about that . 
  immigration . 
  you claim to understand what you are talking about , so please elaborate . 
  thanks for your response . 
  like that [ cat bus from my neighbour totoro ] ( https://i.imgur.com/8s23rqw.jpg ), 
  haha that would be great , but the ic direct has a top speed of 180 km/h i believe . 
  why should she go to prison ? 
  thanks for your response . 
  i 'm not an american , so i 'm not really up-to-date with all this emailgate scandal thingy . 
  i 'm just wondering : is there still an investigation going on right now ? 
  and if so , what are the chances of her actually going to prison ? 
  he is not locked up , he is just convicted for discrimination and hate speech . 
  whatever fits your narative ... keep dreaming of that hateful muslim-free world of yours , it 'll only worsen the divide . 
  nah , he wo n't find other parties that want to govern with him . 
  he should n't have fucked that up a few years ago . 
  serious question : why is it that this sub ( and most trump supporters ) dislike dissenting opinions so much ? 
  like , would n't your arguments actually hold better if you 'd debate them with someone else ? 
  wow , thanks a lot for your answer !, 
  this clears things up a lot for me , and i 'll be heading towards / r/askthe _ donald if i ever have a question or want to see some discussion between the ` two camps ' . 
  oh for fucks sake man , just read about the fucker and it is n't hard to come up with a reason to dislike him . 
  read this , for example , or at the least the sources it refers to : https://www.reddit.com/r/truereddit/comments/5qw1gy/is_donald_trump_just_a_pawn_in_steve_bannons_game/dd2pc1k/, 
  anyone with a decent set of brains does n't need his mistreatment of his wife as a reason to dislike him , nor does his anti-semite sentiment .
