  great photos , what camera do you use ? 
  would n't that be a strange coincidence , a porcupine tree and dream theater fan on / r/progmetal ? 
  and what about the whole world cup 2010 ? 
  he was the best player on the dutch squad . 
  why would people even use ` of ' ? 
  i understand the context , i just do n't get why you would be to lazy to type ` have ' . 
  looks like english basic knowledge to me . 
  what is your favourite game ? 
  is that a zr bridge ? 
  i got one on my ibanez s570, 
  does n't prometheus start there ? 
  great to see patrick zwaanswijk there , he played for my hometown club nac breda , we still miss him here . 
  please do n't, 
  here in the netherlands and france the movie is really popular . 
  alternative/indie rock , but that goes only for the bands i know of the list . 
  i was there last summer , did you drive the skyline drive too ? 
  that is one of the most beautiful roads i 've ever driven . 
  the overlooks were beautiful indeed , i even saw a coyote along the trail !, 
  the eiffel tower is 2 times as big as the washington monument . 
  but the eiffel tower is also heigher than the piramids of giza, 
  i guess the latter . 
  this is the truest thing i 've read on reddit all day . 
  i see a fellow dutchman !, 
  where do you study ? 
  the game looks interesting !, 
  no way , i live in breda !, 
  kyteman is special , but not really jazz anymore . 
  and wayne shorter of course , 
  early opeth is undoubtedly death metal, 
  glad to be able to show you something great . 
  well , loads of people are still enjoying listening to him as of today , so your point is invalid . 
  you have no idea what purposes music can fulfill . 
  and in your first comment you claimed no one is ever going to enjoy his music , which i think is clearly untrue . 
  amazing , saw him last may in tilburg , his support band is incredible . 
  a 20 year old dog , that 's old . 
  sorry mate , it was n't very funny . 
  some say her mouth is still going upwards . . 
  how 's that an am6/9 ? 
  assuming you play ( from low to high ) 5-4-5-5-5-7 . 
  what band were you playing with ? 
  this is from the production videos and if i remember correctly he was jamming to a metallica song . 
  though gorgoroth would be awesome too , 
  be glad you are n't, 
  i 've played hl2 and all its episodes and i fucking loved it . 
  good find , just got him . 
  i hope his value will raise drastically now , 
  ruijgh , gesink , mollema ( all dutchies ) , renshaw and larsson resigned today too . 
  dark day for dutch cycling . 
  * `` if you use this for commercial purposes - please remember to buy the font . 
  it 's $ 10 , it will last you a lifetime and make my day  '' *, 
  so if they did pay 10 bucks there wo n't be much you can do , 
  opeth - blackwater park, 
  incredible , though it might take some time to fully appreciate ( and it 's quite heavy for an untrained ear , 
  the fact that he said something does not mean that you have to post the exact same text in image macro format , it 's annoying . 
  [ exotic animal petting zoo ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr2fvrnqz50 ) are bringing out their album too the 17th of july , they 're amazing . 
  they play everything between progressive rock and mathcore . 
  i do n't think that will become a daily on its own , and it wo n't much lower this . 
  golfers do . 
  number 15 looks surreal , thanks for this . 
  i 'm still amazed that someone who plays the same rhythm with few small variations in every song gets so much popularity , while every decent flamenco player is able to play that with ease . 
  good to see some paco de lucia/flamenco love here on / r/guitar , i wish there 'd be more of that . 
  now that i found a fellow flamenco enthousiast , would you please watch a song of my guitar teacher [ maurice leenaars ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxdtmqirfg4 ) , he 's from the netherlands . 
  [ here is a more recent video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyhq_nnfa5w ), 
  yeah , i know pierre bensusan !, 
  i played his song merrily kissed the quaker , he 's a great guitarist . 
  i did not know michael hedges , but it 's clear to me he is loaded with talent . 
  i always have big respect for those 2 handed tapping things , it 's such a difficult skill to master . 
  thanks for these guitarists , reminds me i should check out this genre more often , 
  he said no joke , so there is no way he 's lying !, 
  in dutch zak means ` bag ' or more colloquial : scrotum . 
  he never said that , he said it 's less likely to be filled with irritating douchebags , that 's a difference . 
  best song of the album , which i 'm starting to like more and more i listen to it . 
  i like , very good for a first effort !, 
  the begin ( more than ) reminds me of beethoven 's moonlight sonata . 
  the heavier guitar parts are great !, 
  who 's performing at the stage ? 
  he 's farming negative karma , and sadly enough he 's quite successful at doing so , let 's just ignore this fucker with the res feature . 
  cool , i see they made some pink floyd reggae covers , interesting stuff , i 'll check them out . 
  why 'd you post such a thing to facebook ? 
  and why would you even still play this game , it 's 2012 for fucksake . 
  she has not answered a single question and after 3 hours there 's still no proof . 
  beautifully done , although the artists are impossible to read , and that should be the focus of a festival poster imo . 
  first time submitting , i love the concept !, 
  ** catchy : ** [ the dear hunter - but there 's wolves ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efu-x4xbl0w ), 
  - the dear hunter is an ** indie/prog rock ** band mainly focused around their ( very talented ) singer casey crescenzo . 
  they released the album the color spectrum last years which consists of 9 ep 's with different colors as names . 
  one of the greatest records released in 2011 . 
  ** obscure : ** [ the hickey underworld - the frog ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc2rfvxzghk ), 
  - the hickey underworld is an ** alt/hard rock ** band from antwerpen , belgium . 
  their music has an ironic/dark undertone , and their music videos are somewhat absurd . 
  the latest album of the band is called `` i 'm under the house , i 'm dying '' ( definitely worth checking out ) . 
  ** popular : ** [ rage against the machine - bulls on parade ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-58-36lsqg4 ), 
  - a band that does n't need much introduction , we all know about their left-winged , communistic , anti-american views . 
  there are n't much bands with so much power and aggression in their songs , and tom morello is a big inspiration for my own guitar playing . 
  legendary band . 
  about myself : my musical interest is focused around everything related to ** prog ** , though i listen to many other genres too . 
  recently i 've been digging lots of jazz and blues and i 'm always looking for new , young , talented bands ( especially those from my own country , holland ) . 
  i hope i can add something useful to this great subreddit !, 
  edit : spelling, 
  yes i am very interested !,
