  the 1337th roll does n't have any impact on the outcome itself , it starts with the same 3 dices every time you throw them . 
  they are both great , but incomparable , it is n't always important who 's better . 
  what are you doing on / r/4chan ? 
  thanks for the votes guys !, 
  hope you enjoy my first submission , they 're a young band from holland who are way to underexposed in my opinion . 
  i recently started playing online with friends using [ gameranger ] ( http://www.gameranger.com/ ) , those servers work great . 
  what 'd you consider it ? 
  it is n't another planet , but still it 's a different piece of rock in the vast universe . 
  i 'd still consider that a different world than the earth we 're living on . 
  what made you go to that hideous place in the first place !, 
  but i 'll allow it , you 're destroying their resources . 
  a little back information about willis earl beal , he is n't the average kind of musician , a very interesting persona . 
  ( article taken from [ this site ] ( http://www.songlyrics.com/news/spotlight-willis-earl-beal/ ) ), 
  he began his music `` career '' in albuquerque by leaving cd-rs on park benches or street corners . 
  he continued his unconventional ways after moving back to his native chicago , posting flyers around the city with his phone number or address . 
  he asked for friends , sang songs to his callers and drew pictures for his writers . 
  beal would perform at train stations downtown before returning to his grandmother 's house , where he still lives . 
  he told the chicago reader that he would play with the feral cats near her house and dance to bo diddley songs while the neighbors stared in disbelief . 
  check [ this song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7gbfcenuok ) out to , it 's more like tom waits .

  `` cheek mountain thief is the new project of tunng-frontman mike lindsay . 
  after a performance in iceland he fell in love with the country , so for this project he located himself in husavik , built a studio there and made music with the locals . 
  his studio had a view on kinnafj\u00f6ll , cheek mountain in english , hence the name . 
  cmt 's music has a close resemblance to tunng 's because of modest vocals of lindsay . 
  only he ditched the electronics and made it a bit more orchestral . '',

  `` in 1893 , monet , a passionate horticulturist , purchased land with a pond near his property in giverny , intending to build something `` for the pleasure of the eye and also for motifs to paint . '', 
  the result was his water-lily garden . 
  in 1899 , he began a series of eighteen views of the wooden footbridge over the pond , completing twelve paintings , including the present one , that summer . 
  the vertical format of the picture , unusual in this series , gives prominence to the water lilies and their reflections on the pond . 
  '' [ source ] ( http://nga.gov.au/monetjapan/detail.cfm?workid=w1509 ), 
  i 've seen the painting in musee d'orsay , and in reality it 's less blueish and more contrasted green . 
  a masterpiece in my opinion .

  i took the ferry from hirtshals ( denmark ) to seydisfjordur ( iceland ) , and i made a 5 day stop on the faeroer . 
  the faeroer is incredible , enormous cliffs , beautiful remote villages like tjornuvik and lots of great hiking trails . 
  i highly encourage every nature lover to go there once in their lives , it 's amazing . 
  iceland was fantastic too !,
