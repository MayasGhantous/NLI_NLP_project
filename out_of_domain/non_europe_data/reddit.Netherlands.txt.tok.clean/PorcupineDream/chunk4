  that whole album is amazing , [ miss you ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5duckgyojpe ) is the definition beautiful imho . 
  deus ex : hr had a bit of a blade runner vibe , and that was a great game !, 
  [ this clip ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrkbecv8qc ) is one of the greatest music videos i 've ever seen , and the music is great too !, 
  thanks for introducing them !, 
  he 's been doing these for a few months already !, 
  are you sure about that ? 
  great interview !, 
  really liking their style , attitude and music .

  [ check out his last.fm pic ] ( http://www.last.fm/music/zanger+bob/+images/28332915 ), 
  lotr only had a few very recognizable songs , most of the soundtrack was more intended as background music . 
  i 'm sure howard shore has put a few new distinct songs into the hobbit which everyone will love . 
  that 's an 8 month old post with 17 upvotes , what 's your point exactly ? 
  yeah , we should all post our comments like you want it , if i want to be pretentious ( which i in my eyes was n't ) i have the damn right to be so .

  i took this picture with a simple sony dsc-hx5v during my holiday in iceland . 
  i noticed the fly while enjoying the beautiful night sky and full moon and the view on mt. 
  hekla from our cottage . 
  [ here 's a picture i took of that view .

  thanks , you 're totally right !, 
  when i noticed the fly it was [ sitting like this on the straw . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/z9mgw.jpg ) to my great pleasure it walked to the top and 2 seconds later it was gone , it was magical . 
  certainly do n't !, 
  it 's a terrible camera , but i luckily got some cool pics with it during my holiday . 
  and in my opinion composition is equally ( if not more ) important than technical skill , but that 's subjective . 
  i found [ this interesting wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bering_strait_crossing ) about a hypothetical bering strait crossing . 
  furthermore there was [ this dude ] ( http://www.odysseyxxi.com/ ) who crossed the bering strait swimming/hiking which can be seen right [ here on youtube .

  however , i 've still got a long life before me , hopefully something like that will be finished within my lifetime . 
  should n't you be replying to 5 month old comments ? 
  i still prefer quality above quantity . 
  the fact that i 'm one of the few people aware of the brilliance of steven wilson makes me feel quite better about myself ( as elitist that may sound ) . 
  and the mainstream world has always been shit , that 's not going to change . 
  i started listening to prog when i was around 13 years old , before that i listened to the cliche rock/metal ( metallica , rhcp etc. ), 
  after a few years i started getting more and more interested in jazz and that broadened my taste enormously . 
  now i listen to practically every genre , i 'm no longer bond to boundaries of a particular style .

  not strictly prog ( more mathcore ) , but [ exotic animal petting zoo 's ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqqjerkqsfo ) new album [ a tree of tongues ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00kp3b0csug ) is my favourite album of the year . 
  i saw it yesterday and i thought i saw him when the dwarves escaped erebor , but i 'm not sure about that . 
  he might also have been one of the hobbits in the background when bilbo started his journey . 
  hi mister chambers , thanks for doing this !, 
  what contemporary artist would you like to collaborate with right now ? 
  beautiful , i 'm currently playing recuerdos de la alhambra by him , such a great composition . 
  a substantiated reply always deserves an upvote , whether one agrees with or not . 
  i hope you will still write it , it 's nearly at 50 upvotes !, 
  produced by the great john zorn , a fantastic album !, 
  i would wait if i were you , it 'll be -50 % till 5 january so there 's a high change it 'll go lower before the fifth . 
  wow , you are hilarious ... 
  are you sure about that ? 
  would be a pity if i do n't buy it now on steam and is n't priced off at greenmangaming . 
  wow thanks , that would make it $ 4,50 here in the netherlands , opposed to $ 7,50 on steam right now . 
  should i buy the goty edition btw ? 
  it 's only 2,50 extra . 
  wow , the metro station in mafia 2 looks exactly like this one !, 
  great pictures , thank you !,

  when did you realize it had the potential to become a fulltime job ( or do you still hold another job next to being a badass musician ? ), 
  who the fuck upvotes this crap ? 
  can all that be done by public transport ?

  excellent work as always !,
