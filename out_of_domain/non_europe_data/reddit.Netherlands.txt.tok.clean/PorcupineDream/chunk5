  that is certainly true , yet poopfeastlover ( that name ... ) claims they changed their comments in a way that his own comment would have been more appropriate and logical . 
  i , however , do not see in whatever way the original comments could have correlated to his comments , as his comments seem immature and totally inappropriate in this discussion . 
  then i 'd love to know what those original comments were . 
  fuck the safety fire !, 
  ( but seriously , they are amazing indeed , i saw them support periphery and btbam last year ),

  ( 0-11 ) listened to what my dad listened who has an awesome music taste ( frank zappa , golden earring , system of a down , 16 horsepower etc. ), 
  ( 11-13 ) got into standard rock bands like rhcp , linkin park , metallica etc and i started playing guitar . 
  ( 13-15 ) got into heavier music like children of bodom , opeth , dream theater ( and i started loving prog more and more ), 
  ( 15-17 ) started getting more interested in jazz , indie , electronica and many more whilst staying a huge proghead, 
  ( 17-now ) i listen non-stop to any kind of genre right now , started getting more involved into psychedelia and post-rock , but also into neo-classical music like nils frahm and a winged victory for the sullen . 
  my favourite band is still opeth however .

  wow you are funny ... 
  where in kashmir is this ? 
  amazing picture !, 
  wow that 's awesome , and op 's pic does indeed look like such a [ devil worm !, 
  amazing as always , do you have a slightly higher resolution so i can set it as background ? 
  / r/youtubehaiku is pretty decent for short funny videos . 
  clarence seedorf ? 
  though you got a fair point with his consistence , that 's phenomenal !, 
  i heard they 're gon na do that again in about 67 years !, 
  would be nice if he at least gave some arguments why he thinks they are n't fucking great . 
  his english lesson with ricky gervais is one of the funniest things i 've ever seen : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw2btpyhgce,

  * cardiacs  such an amazing , influential and underexposed band !, 
  [ fiery gun hand ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mloe4dgt3hk ) is my favourite song .

  is n't that usually the reason why you 'd invest in a company , because you expect that something big is going to happen to it ? 
  great vibe , digging those vocals . 
  [ no , more like this .

  thanks so much man , this will get me started !, 
  i personally did n't like the whole love too much either , though art of almost is pretty decent in my opinion . 
  haha you offended me in no possible way , no worries  i can totally see that they 're just of a lesser quality than their earlier albums . 
  very much enjoying the songs you sent me , thanks again !, 
  you really are a fool of a took , bifur is played by [ william kircher .

  serious question or not ? 
  no , not sure what you are doing here in / r/philosophy , but this subreddit 's content is a little more profound than you 're average default reddit article . 
  not funny mate, 
  there are no objective comments about humour possible , as it is one of the most subjective things in the world . 
  and i did not found it funny at all , so that 's my opinion . 
  fantastic film , if you have n't seen it , go watch it right now . 
  [ cardiacs - fiery gun hand ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mloe4dgt3hk ), 
  a unique british progressive punk band that i would consider the most underexposed band ever , their influence is enormous , yet nobody knows about them . 
  sounds like you had a blast , great pictures man . 
  i 've actually been to nyc only once and i live in the netherlands , but i totally agree with you , new york is amazing !,

  nice playing dude !, 
  i 'm currently playing capricio arabe and recuerdos de la alhambra by tarr\u00e9ga , such a wonderful composer . 
  haha , they are hard indeed !, 
  i remember playing this etude a few years ago , that was one of the first tarrega pieces i 've played ( i guess 2/3 years ago ) . 
  just keep practising and you 'll master the pieces in no time !, 
  i never played un dia de noviembre , but i 've played other pieces by leo brouwer , he 's great !, 
  and villa lobos is fantastic , you should definitely check his 4 other preludes as well !, 
  are n't you that guy who 's been posting some cardiacs on reddit throughout the years ? 
  iirc there was one other guy trying to keep the greatness of cardiacs alive on reddit . 
  ( really digging that ozric vid you just posted btw , they are amazing ! ), 
  i want to punch you in the face for adding this pretentious irrelevance . 
  the fact that reddit is spammed with the bullshit like yours does not imply that i should let it happen and accept it . 
  people like you worsen the reddit experience for many with their elitist retarded nonsense . 
  incredible pictures ( as always  i was wondering what do you do for a living to finance such journeys ? 
  any form of self reflection on your side would be great too ; if you consider it normal behaviour to spam reddit with your panseksual bullshit i 'd say it 's you who should be leaving . 
  '' ( said with respect mind you . 
  i hate normal people . ) '', 
  taken from your toprated comment . 
  what are you , a 15 year old people hating paganist tumblr elitist or what . 
  get the fuck off reddit . 
  that 's the most immature response i 've ever gotten here . 
  damn you 're childish . 
  uhm was n't it you who stated that he ( or she , not sure ) was a transsexual paganist ? 
  that 's fucking retarded , how the hell does that contribute anything to reddit . 
  you really think it 's that cheap and easy ? 
  uhm , the us defense budget is 700 billion dollars . 
  if solving hunger really would be that simple i assume the government would have considered that already . 
  [ i can help you with that . 
  you must be a legend at parties . 
  have you checked out [ geskia !, 
  he 's a great producer from japan . 
  i read he plays soccer too .

  i think you 've kinda misunderstood what classical guitar is al about . 
  classical guitar incorporates the use of a guitar like [ this ] ( http://www.theaheng.com/uploads/pics/cs40-2.jpg ) , the shit you are posting is neo-classical poser metal . 
  yes , malmsteen en romero are what i call `` posers '' . 
  francesco tarr\u00e9ga , albeniz , brouwer etc. , real classical guitarists .
