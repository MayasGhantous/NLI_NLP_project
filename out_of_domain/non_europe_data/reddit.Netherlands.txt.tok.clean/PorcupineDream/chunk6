  his piece asturias , albeit not originally written for guitar , is an excellent ( and one of the most famous ) example of romanticist classical guitar . 
  do you actually know what classical guitar is all about ? 
  from wikipedia : `` the classical guitar varies from the `` spanish guitar '' from its construction , size , weight , wood and the sound it produces . 
  the common factor is that both guitars have six nylon strings against metal strings used in acoustic and electric guitars . 
  in addition to the instrument , the phrase `` classical guitar '' can refer to two other concepts :, 
  * the instrumental finger technique common to classical guitar -- individual strings plucked with the fingernails or , rarely , fingertips, 
  * the instrument 's historic repertoire '', 
  now look again at the submissions you 've made to this sub , and ask yourself : do they fit these criteria ? 
  mate i 'd love to see your videos , a player of such a high level as you must be quite famous in the field !, 
  i 'm currently studying classical guitar at the tilburg conservatory in the netherland and been playing it for 10 years , my teachers are maurice leenaars ( flamenco ) and enno voorhorst , quite respected players on a local level . 
  i do n't download tabs you retard , i buy their composition books in my local shop . 
  as you can clearly see this type of humor is n't appreciated here and it might be better suited for / r/guitar, 
  what era would you place it ?!, 
  it has influences from spanish folk music , but it is a romanticist piece nonetheless . 
  [ these guys take babysitting to a whole new level in a post-apocalyptic world . 
  * ^ this ^ took ^ me ^ way ^ more ^ time ^ than ^ i 'd ^ like ^ to ^ admit , ^ and ^ it ^ was ^ all ^ done ^ in ^paint.net , ^ criticism ^ is ^ more ^ than ^ welcome !, 
  that 's incredibly beautiful , amazing work . 
  where did you film the man in the field at 2:49 ?

  good songs , but tame impala 's song came out in 2012 . 
   post as a comment on the thread your top 3 songs or albums of 2013, 
  oh shit , you 're right , spotify said the album came out in 2013 but i see it was actually released in august 2012 . 
  thanks for the upvote !,

  you 're right , my bad !, 
  there 's the [ hardebollenstraat ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/hardebollenstraat ) too in utrecht ( colloquially called the ` harde ballenstraat ' ( hard balls street ) ) .

  thanks !, 
  i 'll work on it . 
  well , i do n't think anyone would have believed you thousand years ago that we 'd be able to land a man safely on the moon and back , so passing through jupiter might quite possibly be achievable someday . 
  the surface of saturn 's largest moon titan taken by the atmospheric entry probe [ huygens ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/huygens_probe ) , which landed on titan on 14 january 2005 . 
  it continued to send data for about 90 minutes after touchdown . 
  it remains the most distant landing of any craft launched from earth . 
  the huygens probe was part of the famous [ cassini-huygens mission .

  do n't forget earth  but yeah , you 're right , though there has been a mission called [ near shoemaker ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/near_shoemaker ) that got really close towards and even landed on the near-earth asteroid eros . 
  fantastic photos !, 
  where did you shot [ this one ? 
  ] ( http://www.homeboundblues.com/post/48937307920 ), 
  fergie is incredible indeed , but imho michels was an overall better coach because he gained his achievements in more different competitions . 
  fergie had years and years to form manchester the way he wanted ( still massively impressive though and his success with aberdeen was amazing too ) , but michels was successful with ajax ( 3 europa cup 1 's in a row ) , with the netherlands ( 1974 world cup final , 1988 european cup winners ) , with bar\u00e7a and invented `` total football '' , a tactic still being used today .

  actual ( though informal ) rule of reddit . 
  it might be a png !, 
  keep in mind though that the data from your map is 19 years old , 17 years older than op 's map . 
  here in the netherlands we use it too , though other words like ` vet ' and ` gaaf ' can be used in that context too . 
  ` geil ' in german ( not in dutch , then it means horny ) could sometimes be used in the context of cool ( as far as my knowledge of the german language is concerned ) .

  then you 're bar for being a dick is quite low , i was just joking . 
  and yes i am aware that [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/bbw/comments/14xilx/charlie_cooper/ ) was what he meant . 
  why do n't you look up such a simple question on wikipedia ? 
  you 're probably not aware of the hooliganism in the netherlands + / - 10 years ago .

  for you non-dutchies-flemings : in the second panel he says : `` i 'm coming ! '', 
  and in the third : `` do you sell canned spinach ? '', 
  `` nope '' . 
  they would n't have been made without robben either ... 
  not saying that ribery 's pass was n't incredible , but overall i think robben deserves more credit for bayern 's win . 
  ribery was practically invisible during the match besides those 2 moments , while robben had quite some scoring opportunities .

  they still sell it at my local gaming shop with all expansions for only $ 3 , such a fantastic game indeed . 
  21-28 ( sas ) vs 14-19 ( mh ) , i do n't think they 're gon na lose because of that, 
   once again black people are not getting credit for their art . 
  seriously ? 
  jazz is n't ` anybodies art ' , it 's art made for and by everybody . 
  well , i 'd rather not , as i think this should n't be mentioned at all . 
  you however , claim that jazz is african american art , which i think is ridiculous . 
  i 'm not even going to start an argument about this , way to ludicrous . 
  i get what you 're aiming for : jazz was originally invented in the 1920 's by black americans , it 's rooted deeply in african american culture and the most well known jazz musicians are all black . 
  that does however , not make jazz an african american art form , music does n't know colour .
