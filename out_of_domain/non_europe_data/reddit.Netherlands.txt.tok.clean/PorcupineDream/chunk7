  beautiful , reminds me a bit of a picture i took on my holiday last year in iceland : http://i.imgur.com/h0bmy.jpg, 
  have you seen the movie ? 
  ( if not , do so , it is incredible ) it 's pretty damn funny to see them out of character like this . 
  what 's the deal with the searchbar ? 
  i 've never had any trouble looking up whatever i wanted . 
  as a reference : that church tower ( the [ peter and paul cathedral in st. petersburg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_and_paul_cathedral ) ) is 123 meters high !, 
  what camera/lens did you use ? 
  beautiful picture !, 
  beautiful shot !, 
  how do you shoot a 3 minute exposure without getting the picture overexposed ? 
  ahh excuse my ignorance , i had no idea what welding glass was , should have looked it up . 
  thanks anyway . 
  woah do you base this observation on just this thread or am i missing something ? 
  because i only see 2 fuckwits below me complaining about him . 
  nope he did n't , it 's an old 4chan copypasta : http://dis.4chan.org/read/anime/1181156369, 
  you 're kidding right ? 
  they 're pretty great indeed , but i think radiohead 's albums have been way more important and influential on alternative rock and music in general . 
  though i 'm not as acquainted with anco as with radiohead , so i 'm kinda biased in that regard . 
  but you 're right , it 's not really needed to choose a favourite , both bands are unique . 
  yeah , well , that 's just , like , your opinion , man . 
  ( but seriously , i have to be honest that i have n't listened to anco nearly as much as i have to radiohead , so maybe my opinion will change after i 've listened to most of their stuff more intensely too . ), 
  * furthermore do i think that godspeed you !, 
  black emperor is the greatest band in the world , but to compare them to radiohead would be ridiculous . 
  ### mentioning patriot and free will in the same sentence is a bit otiose , patriot !, 
  i think belgium holds that honour ( westvleteren , rochefort , leffe etc. ), 
  that show is fucking legendary . 
  eddie vedder made the soundtrack for into the wild a few years ago , it 's quite a beautiful album . 
  awesome !, 
  it 's a fantastic film ( and an even more fantastic book !, 
  ) , one of my favourites !, 
  i 'm from the netherlands and besides hertog jan , la trappe and a few local beers our beer is pretty mediocre . 
  no i did not forget heineken , it 's ( in my most humble opinion ) one of the worst beers in the netherlands . 
  it 's incredibly popular worldwide actually , i 've no idea why either . 
  * museumplein , we are n't german  amsterdam is indeed ( like almost all dutch cities ) very clean compared to other big european cities . 
  it 's a bit more recent and way after the zappa-era , but [ this performance with marcus miller , lee ritenour and vinnie colaiuta is fantastic . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp5vtlpdva0 ) the way how he plays that same note around the 2 minute mark is so incredibly soulful . 
  not really a repost , but there has been someone else who did the exact same thing : http://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/15802s/wait_for_it_apocalypse_now/, 
  or taxi driver ? 
   do n't link to blogs , band sites , artists with more than 500,000 listeners on last.fm , ** covers of well-known songs ** , ( ... ), 
  this does n't belong here . 
  elliott smith has n't been on the front page in [ 8 months ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/search?q=elliott+smith&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on ) , and the last time he was successful here ( or allowed by the mods ) was 2 years ago . 
  there has n't been any ofwgkta for years , actually there is n't any of it on [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/search?q=ofwgkta&amp;restrict_sr=on ) . 
  del tha funkee homosapien has less than 500k listeners on last.fm , so he 's allowed on here . 
  the cover of your sister however , is a cover of the most well-known band of this moment ( which does n't fit under the ridiculous and non-existing genre ` any ' ) and thus , is under no circumstances comparable to the aforementioned artists . 
  good god , it even contains [ elizabeth dole 's cookie recipe !, 
  ] ( http://www.dolekemp96.org/about/cookies/cookies.html ), 
  and what does such a superfluous statement have to do with this picture ? 
  she 's one of the greatest female rock singers of all time !, 
  cool , i did indeed never hear of those bands !, 
  the out crowd is apparently fronted by guitarist/vocalist matt hollywood , the former co-songwriter and co-founder of the brian jonestown massacre !, 
  they sound great !, 
  i could n't find the other bands on spotify unfortunately , but they did n't sound to bad either . 
  beautiful painting , [ here ] ( http://referat.znate.ru/pars_docs/tw_refs/63/62692/62692_html_m2cff685.jpg ) it is in higher res . 
  it 's not hard when you have [ this extension ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/search-by-image-by-google/dajedkncpodkggklbegccjpmnglmnflm ) installed , you just search by image and select the largest one . 
  you 're trolling right ? 
  and what norway is to / r/earthporn, 
  and iceland . 
  so fucking what ? 
  sensitive information that should be released to the people , and in no way be a reason to detain a man for 9 hours in an inhumane way . 
  this is n't 1984 , this is supposed to be a free country . 
  whether your opinions are true or not , that 's still a rude way to answer to an influential filmmaker who 's making time to answer some question on the internet . 
  sorry for being way to late to the party , but your comment disturbed me . 
  such a beautiful mountain range . 
  i watched this video recently of a guy who did a record descent of the mont blanc , very impressive ( especially the part in the woods ) : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viob1c2urpm, 
  why would you make the implication that people implied you 'd eat something else than the cake when there has n't been anyone who has commented on your comment ? 
  ahh i see now , there are indeed some real fucked up ones down there . 
  was it confirmed that that was for gta v though ? 
  i thought he never mentioned the name of the game which he did the radio station for . 
  yes i know that , i was alluding to [ this comment . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/comments/1czr24/flying_lotus_is_getting_his_own_radio_station_in/c9lidd5 ), 
  the great napoleon murphy brock and don preston are keeping zappa alive with their grandmothers of invention tour , i most definitely recommend any zappa fan to see them live if you 've got the opportunity to do so . 
  if there were 44,805 participants , does that mean there was 1 guy who received nothing ? 
  edit : never mind , i 'm retarded, 
  ahh i 'm retarded , 
  that link is n't working for me . 
  it does indeed not mean anything , as it is the name of the trumpeter , tomsits rudolf !, 
  glad you liked it , i bought the record last summer for 2800 ft ( = 9 euros ) on vinyl during my visit to budapest . 
  i had no idea who they were , but the cover was awesome ( and so is the music too ! ), 
  i 've been discovering 60s psychedelic rock mostly last week , what a fantastic genre . 
  ** 13th floor elevators - the 13th floor elevators **, 
  one of the many great bands i 've encountered during my psychedelic journey , they play a mix of garage and psychedelic rock ( one of the first bands to refer to their music as psychedelic ! ) . 
  the record was released in 1966 and they were one of the louder bands of their era . 
  you 're gon na miss me is by far the most popular song of the album and as the album starter a great indicator of what 's to come . 
  it is also used as the openings track in the movie high fidelity ( 2000 ) which i definitely recommend to every music enthusiast !, 
  roky erickson 's strong voice and the use of an [ amplified jug ] ( http://bit.ly/1192rhk ) give the band a very distinct sound . 
  [ you 're gon na miss me ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oytjybfwuk ), 
  [ you do n't know ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bg_ki9vgnc ), 
  ** the underground youth - the perfect enemy for god **, 
  [ the underground youth ] ( http://www.last.fm/music/the+underground+youth ) is a band from manchester i discovered on last.fm , this album was released 2 august 2013 . 
  just like the 13th floor elevators they play a mix of ( neo - ) psychedelia and garage rock , though they add some darker shoegaze and post-punk elements to it . 
  these elements are most notably on the track veil , a gloomy , atmospheric track with a climax full of distortion . 
  half-way the distortion makes place for a beautiful acoustic guitar , thus turning the whole song into some magnificent dark folk . 
  these more folk-like moments are the most impressive ones on the album for me , the simultaneous singing on runaway reminds me of acts like nick cave and even kiss the anus of a black cat ( check them out too ! ) . 
  this album has been one of the greatest surprises so far of an already excellent music year .

  ### truest patriot, 
  maastricht ( utter south east ) to amsterdam takes about 2,5 hours , breda ( central south ) to amsterdam about 75 minutes . 
  maastricht to groningen ( completely north ) is around 3,5 hours by car . 
  well , he did tell the story about the beheaded chicken . 
  great improv , i love that both of you play with your fingers .
