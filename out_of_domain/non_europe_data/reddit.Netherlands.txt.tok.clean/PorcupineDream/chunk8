  [ the original ] ( http://www.1000steine.com/brickset/images/6861-1.jpg ) for those interested . 
  hopefully this fits the standards for the great 80 's labour day dance party !, 
  i 've always wanted to post some cardiacs here , but since most of their good stuff is from the 80s i 've never been able to do so . 
  fantastic , underrated band that should never be forgotten !, 
  [ m83 - midnight city ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx3k_qdnzhe ), 
  you 're welcome !, 
  fantastic music , go see them live if you have the opportunity to do so , they have a great live show . 
  haha unfortunately not !, 
  but when i saw them last year their was a drunk guy doing weird dances on the floor whilst being surrounded by a huge group of raving people , it was awesome . 
  nope , i saw them at rock werchter in belgium !, 
  dazed and confused , a rather brilliant movie by richard linklater . 
  more like [ spinvis ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izfjfkqfghm ) , [ de staat ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddbf-fxjpho ) and [ dewolff . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7curogxyz7u ), 
  is it that fucking hard to type have instead of ` of ' ? 
  where did you guys learn english for fuck 's sake ? 
  who is the greatest unknown musician that you 've ever played with ? 
  it 's in the smithsonian american art museum in washington dc . 
  burger records is keeping him alive nowadays !, 
  i thought you just said you did n't do this for karma ? 
  ( not that it matters to me , you do a fantastic job ), 
  just order your comments best first instead of top . 
  i completely agree , i just started ai at universiteit utrecht . 
  [ no he does not . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/1mynec/surprised_and_very_excited_to_find_this_new/ccdtk8o ), 
  was n't it called cognitive a.i. ? 
  or was the master called technical ai ? 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm only in my first year , so i do n't think i 'll have to make any choices soon , but i 'll definitely inform you if i have any doubts !, 
  you must have enjoyed the show ajaks put up last weekend . 
  heineken  amstel  bahvaria , but those 3 are still all shite . 
  [ oldtimers drop ] ( http://www.oldtimers.nl/ ) is very good . 
  you have n't even seen the movie and you 're already complaining . 
  my point still stands , or are you implying you have in fact * seen * the movie ? 
  i get that peter jackson took some liberties and yes i have read the books too . 
  this however , does not refrain me from enjoying the movies and peter jackson 's view on middle earth !, 
  why should the movie be exactly the same as the book ? 
  why should the trilogy be completely focused on bilbo 's storyline ?!, 
  the only complaint i have is the supposed lovestory of legolas they put in , but i have to see the movie first before i 'll make a judgement about that . 
  \u00c5 sounds more like the o in dog . 
  if you enjoyed this , you should definitely read the book krakauer wrote about it ( also titled into the wild ) , a very interesting and impressive read . 
  even more mind blowing when you consider that [ norway is the most democratic country in the world and north korea the least . 
  ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratie-index#ranglijst_anno_2011 ) ( sorry for the dutch link , could n't find an english list ), 
  unless you 're playing the [ iwato scale ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iwato_scale ) or something exotic like that !, 
  though i 'd never object to anything the great jimi hendrix has ever said . 
  while that 's a beautiful quote , i actually do think we are able to conceptualize parts to a greater whole , it 's one of the strongest features of human recognition . 
  ( and to some extent , the main principle of the gestalt psychologists ) i 'm sure that 's not what lovecraft was alluding to , but the comics statement that we have no ability to conceptualize the totality is a bit too ` pessimistic ' in my opinion . 
  forgive me if i misunderstood the implication of the statement in the comic !, 
  that implies that there is a whole picture that we should strive for to comprehend , or that there actually is a greater picture that 's outside our reach of understanding . 
  mushrooms or less druggy , meditation are possibly great means to acquire knowledge of this greater whole . 
  david attenborough . 
  now you 're comparing them semantically , in terms of syntax the difference is the same . 
  that was n't the initial point of the discussion , the roman numeral system as a whole is indeed not as easy as our current system , but the difference between iv and vi is the exact same as the difference between 17 and 71 . 
  lou never did either . 
   ` too boring ' goes hand in hand with the utterly pointless dismissal of ` pretentious ' . 
  both seem more like reflections on the viewer than the film itself , as in they were bored or felt undermined by a film 's lofty aims . 
  taken from [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/truefilm/comments/1l9tbf/when_is_its_too_boring_a_valid_criticism_of_a_film/cbx44de ) on / r/truefilm , but i think it 's applicable here as well . 
  why do you think the song is boring ? 
  in my opinion its climax is quite engaging , and the music suits the visuals perfectly . 
  then how is the song boring ` even for ambient ' , if you dislike the main characteristics of that genre in the first place ? 
  it does n't seem to me you 're much of a connoisseur on the area of ambient music , or idm . 
  saying the song is boring whilst you admit that is due to your own short attention span seems a bit odd to me . 
  i 'm sure most of us enjoy both shows . 
  does he only do this for shock value or do the women actually have some kind of sexual desire to have intercourse with these animals ? 
  thanks for posting , i had no idea they made a video for this one !, 
  the world needs more oceansize , such a pity they disbanded . 
  i have done the whole ring road last year in 2.5 weeks ( of which we stayed one week in a cottage near the hekla volcano ) and i definitely recommend doing the whole ring . 
  we arrived by boat in the east of iceland , so we kind of had to the whole tour because we wanted to visit reykjavik too . 
  but the more desolate parts in the north and south east are one of the most beautiful places on the world i 've ever been . 
  i personally do n't recommend the golden circle if you 've got a week and a half , for it is very crowded and set up quite commercially . 
  if i were you i 'd visit landmannalaugar or thorsmork , 2 incredibly beautiful nature parks . 
  the only problem with those 2 parks is that they are only reachable with a good 4x4 ( which are very expensive in iceland ) or by a quite expensive bus . 
  it 'll be totally worth it though , there are n't many places in the world where you get to enjoy views such as [ this ] ( http://www.robertwim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/iceland_-_landmannalaugar_-_03.jpg.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://conference.hi.is/ngm2013/files/2012/12/thorsmork_med.jpg ) . 
  good luck with planning your trip !, 
  and do have any kind of proof to prove this ridiculous hypothesis ? 
  i 'd be interested in reading that too , very intriguing !, 
  [ here you are . 
  calm down man , most of us are here because we 're interested in the film making business as a whole , we ca n't be all brilliant directors . 
  his album erotic cakes is one of the highest rated instrumental guitar albums of the last ~ 15 years , it has a 4.4 on sputnikmusic , 5 stars on allmusic and a 9 on ultimate guitar ( though i 'm aware that last one is n't a very reliable source ) . 
  he is one of the few contemporary guitarists who manage to blend fusion , blues , rock and some other related genres in an unique blend that resembles the likes of mike stern and scott henderson . 
  i do agree that people sometimes forget that there are more guitarists like guthrie , but he is one of the greatest of our current generation . 
  but opinions are a bitch , so of course it 's possible that it is n't made for everyone . 
  exactly , that song grooves incredibly hard . 
  why would one be afraid because it 's in german ? 
  as someone whose native language is n't english , this sounds completely ridiculous . 
  we might be more used to subtitles her in the netherlands , but what makes americans unable to read them ? 
  here in the netherlands we have 2 great hammond players who combine their powers in a group called orgelvreten ( `` organ eating '' ) , [ here 's a song they did on dutch national radio ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7yoalmuzau#t=16 ) . 
  not really purely jazz , lots of rock influences as the guy with the beautiful beard plays in the greatest dutch psychedelic rock band dewolff . 
  fucking bullshit , shaitan is the [ devil in islam ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shaitan ) . 
  not underexposed at all  but it is a fantastic album indeed . 
  fantastic , that 's the stuff i was looking for , and only 164 facebook friends !, 
  that 's the spirit man , keep you doing what you love most !, 
  i 'll check out your music tonight , lotus vessel sounds promising already !, 
  tomas dvorak is great indeed !, 
  check out the soundtrack he did for machinarium if you have n't already , that 's how i got to know him . 
  practise the piece as slow as you can play it at an even and fluent speed , do n't try to rush it , as the speed will come with experience . 
  my teacher often let me practice my tremolo letting me mute the strings , that was a very helpful tip . 
  it can also help by playing p i first , then p m i and then at last p a m i ( and if you 're feeling spanish you can try p i a m i , but that one is quite hard to master ) . 
  success with practising this beautiful composition !, 
  exactly , according to this map my house should be already be flooded right now . 
  beautiful shot !,
