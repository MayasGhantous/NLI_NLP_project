  how 's leh ? 
  are you there for holidays ? 
  i plan on going there once i have more time and money . 
  terrible joke man , please do n't try to become a comedian .

  looking at the filename , i guess that 's [ comet encke . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comet_encke ), 
  i 'd say mathematics is in fact applied logic , which ties it to philosophy . 
  but there are enough reasons to put philosophy on the left , which would create a circle and defy any reason to discuss the purity of a scientific field . 
  haha exactly , though a lot of armchair/pop philosophers would disagree with you there . 
  wow thanks for the cocteau twins recommendation , i 've been listening to heaven or las vegas all evening now !, 
  also glad that mogwai 's on that list , such a fantastic band . 
  have you seen the movie already ? 
  he is a big actor and had a role in the movie so of course he should be there . 
  on january 6 , 2011 , swartz was arrested by mit police on state breaking-and-entering charges , after systematically downloading academic journal articles from jstor . 
  federal prosecutors later charged him with two counts of wire fraud and 11 violations of the computer fraud and abuse act , carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $ 1 million in fines , 35 years in prison , asset forfeiture , restitution and supervised release . 
  two years later , two days after the prosecution denied his lawyer 's second offer of a plea bargain , swartz was found dead in his brooklyn , new york apartment , where he had hanged himself .

  dutch guy here , ignore that benedinho for he has no idea what he is talking about . 
  around 1000 years ago most of the netherlands was one big swamp , and at that time the inhabitants started reclaiming the land . 
  in the 13th century people started building dikes around the zuiderzee ( now the ijsselmeer and the markermeer ) , around the river ij and a dam river mouth of the amstel ( hence amsterdam ) . 
  thus , amsterdam was n't built on sea , though it appears that way because those maps are constructed from altitude data . 
  more impressive is the reclaiming of the haarlemmermeer ( 185 km ^ 2 ) , and [ flevoland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flevoland ) ( 2412 km ^ 2 !!!, 
  [ this one 's pretty cool ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_aavyv9pey ) . 
  if you dig ambient , idm , trip-hop etc. 
  i definitely recommend checking out his discography . 
  i completely agree with you , i think the rule from the sidebar ( '' bots will remove artists with more than 500k last.fm listeners '' ) should be tightened to ~ 250k listeners or something along those lines . 
  seeing jon hopkins , mf doom and chvrches on the frontpage seems a bit ridiculous for a sub that tries to promote new and overlooked artists . 
  have you ever been to a dutch dance school ? 
  this is not a meme nor a macro ... 
  i hope i 'm not to late to party , what a fantastic list / u/evilnight !, 
  it 's going to be hard to find some quality music that 's not on there already , but i found some . 
  [ ** the underground youth - the perfect enemy for god ** ] ( http://the-underground-youth.bandcamp.com/album/the-perfect-enemy-for-god ) . 
  a post-punk / psychedelic / shoegaze band from manchester with a really impressive album , i love the atmosphere they create . 
  [ last.fm profile of the band . ] ( http://www.last.fm/music/the+underground+youth ) . 
  [ ** bombino - nomad ** ] ( http://play.spotify.com/album/6zv8pkjigczts7aon6zuze ) . 
  [ african psychedelic folk / blues-rock ] i 'm surprised nobody has mentioned this african beauty yet , it got quite some airplay here in the netherlands . 
  his latest album was produced by dan from the black keys . 
  bombino 's guitarplaying is often compared to that of jimi hendrix and mark knopfler , and slowly becoming one of my favourite non-western guitarists . 
  [ last.fm profile of bombino . 
  [ ** the black heart rebellion - har nevo ** ] ( http://play.spotify.com/album/7gqwna19wbqyyidmla7g6h ) [ post-rock / dark folk / sludge metal ] ominous , terrifying , immense and yet incredibly beautiful at the same time . 
  this belgian band manages to sublimely mix the atmosphere and drones of swans , the dark folk of bands like kiss the anus of a black cat and 16 horsepower and their own roots of screamo and sludge . 
  [ last.fm profile of the band ] ( http://www.last.fm/music/the+black+heart+rebellion ), 
  i hope i 'm not to late , though it has been great looking back through [ my last.fm ] ( http://www.last.fm/user/jaapnac ) scrobbles of previous years . 
  ahh great !, 
  i 'll be looking forward to new years day , i 'm immensely enjoying the rough list already . 
  [ relevant xkcd . 
  ] ( http://xkcd.com/1053/ ), 
  why ? 
  what did i wrong to you d :, 
  well , let 's all keep upvoting gy!be en mogwai for the thousandth time and disregard all other music related to post-rock . 
  yes i 'm aware that this is closer to post-punk than it is to post-rock , but i assumed the average post-rock fan would enjoy this song , sorry . 
  whatever man , i 've been on this sub for nearly 2 years now , but if it makes you happy to think that i 'm new here , so be it . 
  i do n't see the problem with uploading some unknown swans song but apparently it is ... let 's keep spreading hate and forget about enjoying and sharing some great music , great attitude man . 
  jesus fucking christ man , comparing a swans song to an average / r/music submission seems a bit unfair in my opinion . 
  i 'll think twice before i post something that 's a bit out of the post-rock box , no idea people would get so upset about something like this . 
  enjoy your day sir . 
  visually it was the greatest film by far this year . 
  but story-wise ? 
  i 've seen it twice in 3d , but the second time everything about bullock 's character already annoyed me . 
  furthermore , the metaphors and themes throughout the film felt so obvious and forced . 
  so no , not the greatest film for me , that is without doubt the new coen masterpiece inside llewyn davis . 
  i agree that the cinematic experience is superb ( saw it on a huge cinema screen ) , but a film of the year contestor should be perfect regarding all aspects in my opinion . 
  your ` solution ' only seems to raise more questions : what is the difference between a fundamentally religious creature and a non-religious one ? 
  why would a religious approach solve the problem at all ? 
  one of my personal issues with cartesianism is that it seems to divert the mind-body problem , it creates an endless loop of homunculi . 
  how would your catholic approach end this loop ? 
  so what you 're basically saying is that none of my questioned ca n't be answered by your approach and that we should embrace our ignorance ? 
  because that does not seem like a solution at all to me . 
  did you not read my first response to you ? 
  i asked several fundamental questions about the human mind , none of which you have given any answers to ( though you seem satisfied with not giving a real answer at all ) . 
  in order to understand the possibilities of ai we must first understand our own mind , and i do n't see how bringing up god in this argument eases that problem . 
  furthermore , if we are adding religion to the discussion , why would the catholic approach be so suited ? 
  in my opinion buddhism has given way better explanations to the mind-body problem . 
  what is your opinion on [ this article ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=3932740&amp;page=1 ) ? 
  thanks !, 
  you 're right , i had played classical guitar for 6 years before i started with flamenco , so a lot of my techniques are still quite classical . 
  thanks for the recommendation , i 'll look him up . 
  thanks !, 
  i had played guitar for 8 years when i performed this piece , and i think it took me about 3 months to study it . 
  thank you !, 
  i keep my nails quite short indeed , when i look at my fingertips i can just see the top of them .

  wow go watch them then !, 
  those are my favourite movies . 
  and do you really think that movies that are generally well received by the public should be rewarded with high scores ? 
  there are critics for a reason , i 'd rather take advice from a man who 's watched movies his whole life ( like roger ebert for example ) , than a guy who thinks that the avengers is the greatest thing that ever happened to mankind . 
  it 's ridiculously expensive, 
  i am in fact young and short on cash and i did actually go camping ( and hitch-hiking ) in norway last summer !, 
  incredible experience , but having to pay 4 euros for a bread ( just as an example ) made it a bit hard to get around their on the cheap . 
  the nature however , beats all of that .
