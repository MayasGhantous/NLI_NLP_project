the netherlands , and i 'm 22, 
  in case you 're interested , his name means `` bicycle pump ' in dutch, 
  yeah , i solved it on my first try , did n't have to backtrack at all, 
  maybe i 'm just that good , though, 
  how fitting that the playlist contains 7 videos, 
  pretty interesting , i wonder if all cats have this reaction, 
  horses have something similar : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bej-rjzqy7q, 
  it 's mainly electricity that they 're missing ( it has been mentioned in the books that magic often interferes with electricity ), 
  and having little to no electricity has major implications on pretty much anything, 
  asymmetrical * ( sorry , just trying to educate though ! ), 
  horses too , only it 's their lip , not their neck, 
  ( posted this earlier today somewhere else concerning the same video ), 
  it is , without a doubt the easiest and cleanest solution out there, 
  it seems as if a lot of people find this weird or inconceivable , thinking you need enormous amounts of foreskin, 
  you really do n't , as long as you have enough to keep it closed off ( i assume almost everyone who is n't circumcised can do this ) , you 're golden, 
  my thoughts exactly , over here in holland every supermarket and bakery will slice your bread for you ( it is often already sliced ) and sell half loaves, 
  i do n't think we sell smaller than halves though, 
  both of you probably have a clubbed thumb, 
  personally , it 's something that i find very unattractive, 
  no offence of course , but i 've got a thing for good looking fingers/nails , i 'm weird like that ( which goes well with this thread i suppose ), 
  often when i 'm lifting something heavy or raise my arms in a certain position my upper lip raises , kind of like when you have to sneeze ( although i do n't have to sneeze at all , it 's just the lip movement ), 
  i can suppress it somewhat , but i usually just end up with a trembling upper lip, 
  also i can manually unfocus my eyes , i ca n't read a thing when i do it and if i keep it up for a bit ( a minute or maybe even half a minute ) i have to consciously not do it or my eyes will unfocus themselves, 
  it 's useful when i want to look at many things at once , as i ca n't focus on anything, 
  for example if i 'm looking at an ants nest i could see all the individual ants moving instead of focusing on a small spots and have the rest be in my peripheral vision, 
  but they would be blurry , of course, 
  i believe these are all the official ones that arenanet released, 
  have one that 's not included : http://i.imgur.com/glis1.jpg, 
  i 'm not really sure where it came from , but i like it better than all the others, 
  that would be their heads , not yours, 
  unless ... you 're referring to male porn stars ? 
  same here , although it was n't just wrapped around my neck but my torso as well !, 
  there was n't a lot of slack left i 'm guessing, 
  iaman idiot, 
  this still does not rule out male porn starts though !, 
  would n't that depend on the concentration of salt in the water ? 
  i do n't know where you 're from , but i 'm from holland , and i would shift all the descriptions up one increment, 
  then it would be pretty accurate, 
  well , except that 5 \u00bac is still pretty fucking cold, 
  never mind that making sense, 
  did you just refer to yourself in the third person ? 
  actually , i may have been a bit vague by saying `` up '', 
  what i meant was , i 'd say 20 \u00bac is pleasantly warm , and 25 \u00bac is rather ( or a bit ) hot , etcetera, 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvn_0qvuhhw ), 
  exactly , up until a few years ago i had n't cried in about a decade , then i went through a rough breakup and my dog died so my average went up, 
  it 's probably been about a year or more now since i 've last cried, 
  not to be confused with [ blue field entoptic phenomenon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_field_entoptic_phenomenon ), 
  i 've got the photic sneeze reflex , but that does n't mean i 'll sneeze immediately if i go outside on a sunny day , or even stare directly into the sun and sometimes i do n't get so much as a tingling in my nose, 
  it usually helps a sneeze along , and sometimes causes one , but often it does nothing, 
  i love those , i usually try to hang on to the sensation but it does n't really work, 
  oh man , i thought i was the only one or close to it at least, 
  have any of you found a use for it yet ? 
  a friend of mine was ( is ? 
  we were very young back then ) a scruncher , he clogged the toilet more than once that way, 
  folding is much more efficient , you take a few sheets of toilet paper , you fold it down the middle so it 's now half the length , but twice as thick and depending on the thickness or strength of the toilet paper you may fold it again and then you wipe , then you fold it again once again decreasing the length , but exposing a new clean side to wipe with, 
  you can usually wipe a few times before needing to rip off more toilet paper, 
  i used to count lots of stuff in batches of 4 , then later it became 3 and 6 and then 4 again , it changed around every now and then, 
  i mostly did this with subtitles on tv though, 
  i 'm dutch and a lot of english/american shows are on tv , so subtitles are everywhere , even though i do n't need them i find it very distracting to not read them, 
  i have n't really consciously counted things like that for years and years though, 
  pretty much what i did, 
  `` her lips are n't that big !, 
  oh , the fish , i get it . '', 
  i get it '', 
  [ relevant !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzqeud7ov6m ), 
  actually , only 2/3 of earth 's surface is water , the actual mass or volume percentage is quite small, 
  no , not descendants necessarily, 
  if you never have kids , you will never have descendants , and jesus was thought not to have kids, 
  currently we are all cousins , most likely and if you go back far enough we 're descendants of all whose bloodline still exists, 
  have my upvotes , good sir !, 
  i 've registered and am now awaiting my email , i feel like registering another one to be sure, 
  would they frown upon that ? 
  my mistake , madam, 
  just came back from lunch and registrations are now closed so registering again today is out of the question, 
  if the email has n't arrived by tomorrow i 'll have to try again, 
  edit : got the email , took about about 90 minutes in the end, 
  same here , i just want to know for sure everything went correctly and if i then do n't get in that 's fine , at least i ca n't do anything wrong at that point, 
  edit : i 'm in !, 
  same here , i wonder how many of its inhabitants realise where it comes from, 
  ( nederland is the dutch spelling of the netherlands , in case that was n't clear ), 
  from the pottermore account activation email :, 
  `` a million registrants are going to be granted early entry into pottermore to help give it the finishing touches , and the exciting news is that if you validate your account quickly , you could be one of the lucky few selected . '', 
  whereas the pottermore homepage ( after logging in ) states the following :, 
  you 've successfully validated your early access pottermore account . 
  you will be one of the lucky few to shape the experience before the site opens to all in october . '', 
  i 'm not sure what to make of it all , it seems everyone who manages to activate their account is certain to get early access, 
  out of the 5 options this just sounded the best, 
  upvote for yogscast, 
  not to nitpick ( that is exactly what i 'm doing though ) but he apparently died 2 1/2 years ago , so this could not have been posted before 2009, 
  funny how memories can be so imprecise , is n't it ? 
  i 've heard this gets tricky when they get older , can you verify ? 
  it is sort of funny , yes, 
  thanks for fixing my mistake , this is the downside of res i guess , i do n't look at pictures in their full resolution anymore , i just zoom in enough to be able to read it ( which does n't always work , it seems ), 
  have an upvote, 
  came here to say this , luckily it turns out there are others that are aware of this, 
  this will also put www . 
  in front of it , which may or may not be what you wanted, 
  aww yeah , the monkey island series also happens to be one of my favourite game series out there so i am very pleased with this,
