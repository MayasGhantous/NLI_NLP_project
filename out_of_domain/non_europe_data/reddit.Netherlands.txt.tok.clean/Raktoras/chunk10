  from there i ca n't really help you, 
  edit : hold on , while reading your code ( after posting , silly me ) you seem to be connecting to the localhost ( which just means your own computer ) , you would never be able to connect from another computer using that code, 
  you 'd have to figure out what your local ip is if you want to connect from a computer in your lan , or your public ip if you want to connect over the internet, 
  if you want to connect from a pc outside of your lan , you 'd have to forward the port from your router , otherwise you do n't have to, 
  but . . it * is * a toilet , he did n't say piss all over the walls or something , and just because it 's frozen does n't mean he does n't have to piss any longer, 
  always use b over a to go through dialogue quickly , works just as well but prevent accidentally reengaging in conversation afterwards !, 
  took me about 2 years to get there , at that point i really was n't in love with her anymore or even had any desires to get back together , i was pretty much over her, 
  but whenever i let my mind wander or whenever it just was n't preoccupied by something else ( e.g. 
  when on the toilet ) it just ... defaulted to thinking about her , got to the point that it was just annoying, 
  i still think of her from time to time , but days or a week can pass between those times, 
  i hope this does n't get drowned in the other comments , but there is a relevant comic : http://www.spaceavalanche.com/2012/09/11/the-dark-knight-rises/, 
  i have it too , does what it says on the tin , why do n't you like it ? 
  the finish on the keys is starting to wear off , so the blue backlighting is just starting to become blobs instead of letters , and because it 's black , dust and other filth shows easily , but that 's to be expected, 
  no , it 's browser only as far as i 'm aware, 
  it 's been several years now since we had to put our dog down , so i do n't remember every detail that well , but as far as i can remember we only put her collar on whenever we were walking her , once we got home we just left it attached to the leash and took the collar off, 
  my nexus 7 ( which is n't a phone , so the os is slightly different ) does have a rotating lock screen , though , so it 's possible this is built in for all versions of android , even if not all versions have a rotating lock screen, 
  which is stupid and annoying , but might explain it, 
  as a guy , i 've done a similar thing, 
  i was standing on this lookout tower near the sea , in the dunes , watching the sunrise with this girl i met some hours ago . 
  i brought her to this spot , but had n't even realized what a nice spot it was or how romantic the situation might be , i just really liked climbing that tower . 
  she had a blanket wrapped around her and as she rearranged it she asked me if i was cold , without hesitation i told her i was fine ( even though it was a little chilly ) . 
  i pride myself on realizing what i just passed up and quickly recovering with `` actually , i am '' and proceeded to get under that blanket with her . 
  i 'm guessing we stood there with my arm around her , huddled together for warmth for over an hour , just talking , before we went back to her and her friends ' tents . 
  it only took about an hour or two after that before we finally kissed , unfortunately she had to leave soon after that, 
  yeah , i really am a bit of a slow mover , i kept thinking `` does she want me to make a move ? 
  i just do n't know ! '', 
  even though we were standing really close together for a long time in a fairly romantic scenario , i felt like an idiot looking back , she must 've been confused by me, 
  it really was , there was a bit of fog low over the ground which added some very nice shading to more distant dunes , making the ones in the back appear more and more white, 
  she also kept mentioning how beautiful it was , but i thought nothing of it, 
  i do n't necessarily see the big deal, 
  `` anyone could own a gun ! '', 
  they already can , this is just a more difficult way of obtaining one . 
  3d printers are n't cheap , and the ones that can print metal ( i do believe they exist , used in factory work ) must be very expensive right now and unavailable to the public, 
  they have a second video of this which is even better i think, 
  i 'd find you a link but i 'm on a mobile device so its too much hassle, 
  what do jws believe happens to a nonbeliever who dies ? 
  do they think you go to hell ? 
  or do they have something else opposite heaven ? 
  as a left handed person who also uses his right hand for mousing , i have to disagree with you, 
  when i was younger ( 6 or so ) i used to use my left hand for the mouse , but it was so annoying having to switch over whenever any of my right handed friends used my computer i trained myself to use my right hand for using the mouse ( did n't take very long , ca n't even properly use my left hand for it now ) but i still think that the mouse is a much more precise instrument than the keyboard , and i can easily understand using the mouse with the left hand, 
  it 's not like right handed people use the mouse in their left hand , do they ? 
  honestly , i work at a supermarket ( in the netherlands ) and a lot of people , maybe most of them , use collapsible crates , and the ones that do n't usually just get a big cardboard box from the supermarket to put stuff in and the ones that do n't do that usually have a large sturdy bag they can put a lot of items in , and rarely do i ever see anyone getting those tiny bags i always see in pictures on the internet , unless they only needed a few items and it all fits in one, 
  when the host chooses which one to get rid of , it is certain that a bad option is being removed, 
  so let 's say there are three options ( as is the classic monty hall problem , but it works with more than three ) and you 've picked one ( you could call this your suitcase in op 's example ) and the host removes a bad option from the remaining two . 
  now before the host removed that option there was a ~ 33 % chance of any suitcase containing the big prize , the odds that one of the two suitcases you did n't pick contains it are obviously twice as large as that your single suitcase contained it . 
  then the host eliminates a bad option from those two . 
  so the odds that the prize is now in the remaining suitcase is now ~ 67 % , because that 's the odds that it was in one of the two , but the host made it so that if it was in one you ca n't pick the wrong one . 
  however in op 's case , the host did n't remove any bad options , op removed them all and there 's no telling where it is, 
  to be fair , people are always going on about how you should root as soon as possible because you 'll lose your data , but they also say to make a backup so even though i 've been in this subreddit for a little while now , i still do n't know what the backup does , whether it 's in case of something going wrong or if you can actually restore your stuff ( but then it would n't really matter when you root , would it ? ), 
  oh , i do , but i almost always end up regretting it because it takes up too much time, 
  i believe it also has to do with using a very old library for opengl , that they 're intentionally not updating so that older and simpler machines can run it , even if it does cost performance, 
  or something like that , it was a while ago that i read something about it, 
  [ this is a kapsalon ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ehfk4.jpg ) , it is fries , covered in meat ( usually kebab or shawarma ) covered in cheese which is then melted on top of it , and then covered in salad or lettuce . 
  it is a delicious dutch dish, 
  often a sauce like garlic sauce or [ sambal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sambal ) sauce is added as well, 
  it is quite tasty , but to be fair , that image makes it seem a lot better than it usually does , it usually looks more like the image wikipedia has for it, 
  ah , i have n't played it in a while either and i would n't know what the update did but they 're probably still not taking advantage of newer hardware, 
  i 'm in central europe ( the netherlands ) and in my house it 's a very normal thing to keep your shoes on . 
  or take them off . 
  whatever you feel like . 
  i usually go to my room and take them off there, 
  although we usually have to tell our guests that it 's fine to keep your shoes on , so i guess most people here do n't do that, 
  that 's not entirely true though , it only draws blocks that have air or some other transparent block next to them ( if they do n't , they 're not visible ) , and i think it does some other culling as well, 
  but it is true that its voxel nature is a little demanding, 
  i imagine most blocks require much keeping track of as they 're purely visual and serve no function , though , right ? 
  honestly i do n't know a lot of details about how minecraft works , i 'll take your word that it has a lot more going on than i think it does, 
  cool, 
  that 's what i always thought , but it is the central european timezone , so i was n't sure, 
  well that 's easy, 
  came looking for this , very impressed that i actually found it, 
  oh god , i 'm only on book 4 of my re-read through the series right now , it 's going to take ages before i can finally read a memory of light , but it 'll be so worth it to not just skip to it right now, 
  i have to admit i have n't read it yet and actually forgot to start with it but will now read it after the last book , to soften the blow of the end, 
  kelly kapowski , from saved by the bell, 
  but her real name is tiffani amber thiessen, 
  my chrome 23 , windows 7 , amd phenom ii x4 955 3.2 ghz ran everything very smoothly , it was a beautiful experience, 
  does webgl have hardware acceleration ? 
  because maybe it 's my gtx 550 ti that 's making the difference, 
  ohh , if you could reply to the questions in the ama with a youtube video and do a different voice for every answer , that would be amazing, 
  and a lot of work, 
  ( i believe youtube lets you record and upload from your webcam immediately which would streamline this process ), 
  it 's also a pretty great 32 bit comprehensive and complex image editor for newer machines, 
  honestly , i believe photoshop cs2 is from 2006 , but it is still an amazing program , perhaps second only to its own newer versions , and not by that much , the core of what photoshop cs6 is used for can still be done on cs2, 
  i think cancer , by its very definition , is not benign, 
  the view in that last picture is gorgeous, 
  well , shit, 
  the culinary name ( which is what you are looking for ) for meat cut from a horse is `` horse meat '', 
  not very exciting , i know, 
  according to wikipedia , the ban was lifted in 2011, 
  still mostly a taboo though , since horses are often regarded as pets or work animals, 
  basically , if it was bred for consumption , i 'm fine with it , meat is meat and we should n't necessarily feel more affection for one kind of animal than we do for another . 
  if it 's not cruel to slaughter cows and pigs for meat , then that should go for all animals ( if it is indeed not done cruelly , for some animals it might be considered cruel to breed them or keep them captive ), 
  taking this thought a bit further , i have always been curious what human meat would taste like , i understand that cannibalism is very much a taboo , but if it 's all consensual and perhaps just a small cut of meat that would regenerate over time . 
  i 'm not saying i want to eat your dead grandmother , or any deceased person as death is a very emotional thing , you ca n't just treat a dead person as an object , certainly not one to be eaten . 
  but you could treat a piece of a living human as an object , i think , from myself if necessary , i 'd be interested in trying it, 
  i have to admit i do n't remember reading this , and i was all over their updates back then , still if people are claiming this was announced back then i 'll believe it, 
  it really sucks though , as i 'm a european playing on american servers because that 's where all my gaming buddies live , a lot of whom i met through gw1 ( we ended up in the international districts a lot ) . 
  but i do know some european friends that play gw2 as well , and i basically ca n't play with them , unless i pay gems and dedicate an entire week to their server , meaning i then ca n't run dungeons with my guild, 
  for a company that is pushing the cooperative part of the game and the ability to play with your friends so much , this just feels like a really big drawback , especially because we were all able to play with anyone in the world back in gw1 and now ca n't continue to play with them ( conveniently ) in gw2, 
  still this problem might be solved one day , copying a character 's data files from one world to another is hardly impossible , as it is exactly what happens during a server transfer , it seems they want to limit your character 's files to one data center at a time ( as guesting basically allows you to play one more than one server a day ) but i 'm fine with it locking me out of my home world for a limited period ( the time it takes to do a character transfer ? 
  or perhaps a few hours or so ) if it means i get to play with friends from the other region,
