  you , i like you, 
  basically `` to affect '' means `` to have an effect on '', 
  as long as you can remember that it should be pretty simple, 
  i was about to comment `` qi did this as well ! '', 
  when i realised this gif is actually from the episode in question, 
  source : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_iiloveejk, 
  how long did it take you to write that sign ? 
  it 's way too neat and fits too well for that to have been quick, 
  do they actually translate sweetroll as apfelstrudel ? 
  haha , i thought it might be something like that , i 'll accept apfelstrudel as your go-to german treat though, 
  in my country you 're required to know it , but that does n't mean you 'll be tested on it , after all a driving exam is only so long and they do n't go through every maneuver, 
  however it seems to me that this woman simply does n't grasp the concept of reversing , she somehow does n't understand what way her car will turn when steering in reverse , which does seem pretty unlikely to go unnoticed during a driving exam, 
  i feel your pain , 23 and ca n't grow a full beard or mustache either, 
  it 's slowly filling in , but it does n't seem like i will ever be able to grow a real one, 
  i 'll be honest here and tell you that twilight did teach me about washington ( the state ) , and that things like seattle are in it, 
  not american though , so i do n't feel too bad about learning it this way, 
  but then again , being a guy , i do feel a little bad about my method of learning this, 
  to add to this , turkish pizzas ( which are n't turkish ) are the rolled up variant , they 're more like d\u00fcr\u00fcms than pizzas though, 
  a pizza with kebab on it is pretty common here in the netherlands as well , with garlic sauce of course, 
  source : i work in a pizzeria/kebab place ( we also do other foods , but those are most frequently sold ), 
  during the day it would be much like a greenhouse , and you would n't need heating , and if it 's double or triple pane glass it might insulate well enough to keep you warm at night too, 
  he definitely got bigger , you could just attribute it to the drawing style changing a bit , but he is pretty buff now whereas he had a much more rounded body at the start, 
  no one said you ca n't open a window or otherwise keep it ventilated, 
  i do n't know if i 'd say his accent sounded quite authentic , no dutch person would ever assume he spoke it as a first language, 
  like you said his dutch was laced with german ( like he said he was learning it from german ) and his pronunciation was way too harsh . 
  having said that i think he could get the pronunciation right if repeating after someone , he was certainly able to make the right sounds , he just did n't use them right, 
  well people may have gotten sick , but i do agree with you, 
  it ( likely ) wo n't hurt you , and you 're definitely not going to taste it , if you do n't know it does n't really matter, 
  yup , age of 10, 
  at least i did back then, 
  how do the power and reset switches work ? 
  usually those would be buttons not switches , or does it actually function as a button ? 
  ( i.e. 
  it can only rest in one position ), 
  haha , no i ca n't claim credit for that , i think i probably grabbed it form a / co / thread back when i still visited 4chan, 
  very cool , i 'll have to remember these exist, 
  you should just put those switches in series so that you have to flip them all to turn it on , would look pretty awesome, 
  i suppose he means that it does n't keep you where you were when you try to skip , but actually sends you back to the beginning, 
  it 's fine if you change your opinion , though , as long as you do n't want to die you want your life to go on indefinitely, 
  once you change your opinion you can always end it if you do n't want it to go on , or give yourself amnesia and start life anew or create an afterlife to go to or slow your perception of time so years fly past and things become interesting again, 
  i sort of agree with harry that death should n't be accepted but defeated , but without magic it may be a bit of a bigger hurdle for us than it is for harry, 
  i agree , but if you do n't want to be immortal anymore , if you want to die , i 'd say it 's as good of a suicide as actual suicide , and probably better, 
  i do n't see any hands in this picture nor is it any harder to just do a mirrored version of any knot, 
  it 's been a few years since i read the books , but as far as i 'm aware neville was born a day before harry ( or was it the day after ? ), 
  and his parents were aurors ( they fought voldemort , presumably 3 times ) and if voldemort had gone after neville instead of harry the latter part of the prophecy would have fit neville instead of harry, 
  but as we all know , that 's not what happened and voldemort chose harry, 
  do you need 4.2 for this ? 
  because i do n't see it under display, 
  some games do exactly that when taking a screenshot , i know guild wars would save your screenshots for you , and whenever you take a screenshot it renders the game with the highest graphic settings for a single frame ( or perhaps only the screenshot is with the highest setting and it 's not even drawn , but i do remember the screen flashing briefly when taking a screenshot ), 
  pretty cool feature, 
  that was really cute , loved it, 
  i think it 's more likely i 'll win the lottery seeing as i have n't committed any crimes, 
  then again i 'm not playing the lottery either, 
  i believe you can just swallow them, 
  how well would something like a nice picture of outer space turn out ? 
  [ something like this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/hubble_ultra_deep_field_high_rez_edit1.jpg ) , or perhaps something with less background noise, 
  i suppose it was n't a very colourful image . 
  how about something like this ? 
  there are very high resolution versions of this one , so it would n't look pixely, 
  i 'm not a man who 'd put art on his walls , simply because i would only put something up if i really like it , and i love outer space, 
  it would amount to a few cents maybe , but that 's not the problem, 
  the problem with the mentality of `` it wo n't make a difference if i block them '' is that you 're not alone , and it adds up and then it does make a difference, 
  vice versa , if more people think `` i should n't block them , even if i do n't make a large difference '' it will add up as well , and it will make a large difference, 
  agreed , this site looks really nice but what guarantee do i have that the files i see are the files i want ? 
  i mainly use isohunt for the occasional torrenting that i do because their ranking seems to work pretty well and what i want is often on the first page of results i just check the comments quickly and download , if i ca n't find it there i move to tpb, 
  so i just searched for `` monkey island 3 '' , it 's a great game that is n't being sold anywhere anymore and i want to play it so i 'll just torrent it, 
  the search returns 6 results , of which 2 appear to be what i 'm looking for, 
  however instead of getting a download button it keeps saying `` searching ... '' , what exactly is happening here and how long am i supposed to be waiting ? 
  that does n't always work , people are often quick to jump on a torrent and a torrent can rack up hundreds or thousands of seeds even if it 's fake , simply looking at those numbers is not sufficient to judge its validity , even if it does often work, 
  well , it 's lossless so it should n't be, 
  it 's used mainly for the removing part , i 'm not sure what the adding does , i 'm guessing it might add it to some part of the registry allowing windows to know it 's installed and making it easier to find/uninstall ? 
  the point is that even though they 're smaller they have 4 times as many distribution centers, 
  i remember a discussion about this in / r/southpaws and it basically boiled down to where you are from , lefties often seemed to do the opposite of what righties did in their area ( like / u/tweespam explains somewhere above or below this post , different regions have different utensil etiquette ) but it was n't uncommon for them to just have picked up the regular way of holding your utensils ( like me ), 
  it 's funny how those cups are perceived in other countries , over here in the netherlands i was walking through some novelty shop that sold these cups ( in lots of about 20 i 'd say ) labelled as `` american cups '', 
  in case people do n't get this , it says `` raspberry [ extra ] jam '' in dutch, 
  why is tb holding a jar of dutch jam ? 
  now i mean no disrespect , but is n't asking someone to believe in something that appears unlikely without any proof asking them to be an idiot ? 
  again , not trying to call anyone an idiot here , i 'm just being a bit crude , but if we reached all our conclusions in such a fashion we would not be where we are today , science would n't exist as that would probably the opposite of science , and i think if there is anything that has ever been proven to work , it 's science, 
  i beat it round christmas with a single 550 ti , no problem running any part of the game, 
  honestly ... this kind of makes me want to play skyrim again , i never did finish most of the storylines in that game, 
  though i understand it 's a lot of trouble or you might not have the right kind of browser , so i 'll just tell you :, 
   does anyone besides me else walk around like the watch dogs guy , holding their phone like he does , in public after seeing the gameplay ? 
  surely this already happens when rinsing your mouth after brushing your teeth , or are you telling me people are n't supposed to rinse after brushing ? 
  are we talking actual shit here or what ? 
  yeah , i 'm also sure that the posture was just the result of an awkwardly timed photo, 
  despite that , not a fan of the way he dresses , especially the two watches , but whatever floats his boat, 
  i love my internal voice when reading , really lets me be immersed in what i 'm reading , to truly listen to what is written , and take note of how a word is or may be pronounced, 
  it does take longer , but i do n't mind , i 'm a patient man, 
  i 've pooped a white turd once , was pretty shocked and i 'm still not sure what caused it , i did go out drinking the night before so i assume one of the drinks had some special food colouring or something, 
  3.5-3 .53 grams per cubic centimeter, 
  to put that into perspective , that is 3.5 times as heavy as water, 
  yet at the same time cold toilet seats are uncomfortable as well, 
  you know what i find mildly infuriating ? 
  not that a site has such requirements , it 's a good thing to want strong passwords , but that every site has slightly different requirements for their passwords without telling me what they were, 
  i have a certain system to my passwords so as long as i know the password requirements , i 'll know what i would have used as a password , but the only place the password requirements are ever listed is on the account creation screen, 
  i just wish it became a regular thing for websites to remind users of their password requirements at the log in screen, 
  is that a pokemon reference or is celadon an actual gambling term for something ? 
  emulators would be preferable in many situations , especially since you can run them on pretty much any mobile device lately , but there 's something nice about using an actual gameboy , plus the hardware buttons are better than touchscreen , and it 's less hassle than using an external controller, 
  yesterday , he was over there to promote some game , i 'm assuming it was a similar thing to when warwick was there, 
  how do you just cross your eyes ?
