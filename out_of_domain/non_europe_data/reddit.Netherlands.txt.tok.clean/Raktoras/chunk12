  i can cross them by trying to look at the tip of my nose , but then i ca n't see the screen , so i 'm placing the tip of my finger in the exact spot my eyes need to look at for the dots to align , but that 's incredibly tiring and is making me dizzy, 
  it 's in the url : http://nedroid.com/, 
  you 're supposed to pronounce them in english , so they sound like you 're saying :, 
  stuff the turkey i 'm offering ( ? ), 
  seems like double dutch ? 
  well , surprise , surprise , it is, 
  a reverse image search does n't bring up anything above this resolution , i 'm guessing this is the original resolution which is a shame , would 've looked pretty good, 
  i still prefer spider-man 2 , but i played that on ps2 and 3 on pc , besides i remember swinging with the middle mouse button which just is n't easily pressed on my mouse , though i suppose i could 've rebound it, 
  i should give sm3 another go i suppose , maybe with a controller this time, 
  as a jeroen , i think i 'm qualified to answer this, 
  as jeroen is a pretty much exclusively dutch name ( belgians could be called jeroen , i guess , but i do n't know how big the name is over there ) it 's a safe bet that he is , indeed , dutch, 
  it also seems to be pretty hard to pronounce for anyone not dutch, 
  over 10 months , actually , which is a quick growth , but a slow delivery of the plaque, 
   he was n't being cute . 
  he was trying to avoid sexual assault charges . 
  just looking at her could land him a 30 day jail sentence .

  are you sure it 's required ? 
  i thought it was just an optional thing , i 'm not paying anything and it works just fine, 
  here you go, 
  it 's okay , we dutchies do it too, 
  i also have to upvote those people, 
  he means the picture is of lisa , not maggie, 
  i kind of like that word , it 's taking the serious and important thing that is pregnancy and referring to it with a word that sounds nonchalant and comical , you ca n't use it without sounding like you 're making an understatement, 
  it 's sounds funny to me, 
  it 's the big fat quiz of the year , and pretty much every year is on youtube in full length videos , do yourself a favor and look them up, 
  i do n't know , the online podcasts can be watched by anyone , anywhere on the world , free of charge . 
  the amount of people that live near pax east or could afford to travel there , and then afford a ticket and then also be interested in the podcast could 've been a pretty small number, 
  oh yeah , they could 've probably filled a much larger room , just not `` considering the turnout for the online podcast '' , which is the point i was nitpicking over in my post, 
  here 's a nice video by extra credits about the term gamer :, 
  makes it so the pizza does n't cool as fast , too, 
  i work at a pizza place and we generally do n't cut pizzas unless it 's requested , though we do understand a lot of people want it cut so we usually ask what they want, 
  we prefer not to cut them for the reasons stated above , if it has too many toppings - especially vegetables - it 's generally a bad idea to cut it because it 'll just start leaking like mad and everything will get soggy, 
  so do we in the netherlands , we just cut the pizza into slices ourselves or ask the pizza place to cut it for us, 
  this is an atm for a specific dutch bank though , and atms do n't have usage fees in the netherlands , unless you 're withdrawing from a foreign account , i guess, 
  not even underwater , they grow on vines, 
  you ca n't change the past , but you can change the future , or the present , though i suppose it 's not changing if it has n't happened yet, 
  if you 're determined to use your time turner an hour from now , to go back an hour , you 'd suddenly see yourself pop up next to you ( assuming you were in the same spot ) and you could do stuff, 
  that link was purple , i should 've fucking known, 
  that 's an odd resolution , but it 's pretty much 16:9 and looks fine when scaled down to 1080 , so i 'm pretty pleased with it, 
  i do this when rushing to reach the bus in time , the trick is to pull it tight against your back so it does n't bounce, 
  i realise that might make it look more stupid , but at least it works, 
  i do n't think there 's any part of this vagina that 's `` in '' anymore , the opening at the end is the cervix if i 'm not mistaken, 
  yeah but jennifer aniston has ( in ) famous pokey nipples, 
  knows how to shave and knows his matrix references , you 're pretty cool in my book, 
  read that as `` fisting '' at first , which does n't diminish any good guy status as long as it 's all consensual , but sure is an odd thing to share about your uncle, 
  hard to say , so far we only know of one planet in this universe which contains life ; earth . 
  now , one is a terrible sample size , we ca n't say if we were an unimaginable fluke and it has n't happened anywhere else in the universe ( i like to think that 's unlikely , but i have nothing to base that on ) or if it happens all the time and is quite common, 
  this is one of the reasons that finding extraterrestrial life would be such a big deal , if we could find just a few microbes on mars , that would be the biggest discovery in the history of mankind . 
  if we can find life on two different planets in a solar system of 8 , then chances are very good that there 's life elsewhere, 
  of course that assumes any hypothetical life on mars did n't come from earth or vice versa, 
  i do n't know , there are definitely different levels of quality when it comes to atms , when on holiday i often come across atms that are very slow ( likely because it 's communicating with my bank back home ) , unclear and one time i actually had one just quit in the middle of a transaction , it just spat my card back out with no warning whatsoever, 
  whereas over here ( the netherlands ) i 've never seen an atm fail or even heard of such a thing, 
  in dutch it 's simply shuttle, 
  i once heard afrikaans described as a simplified dutch , which sounds somewhat accurate , but i do n't really know enough about afrikaans to say for sure, 
  the javascript one would work very well for java , too, 
  right , so it does n't accurately portray the relation between the two languages , but if someone wanted to know about similar they were , would it at least give them any idea of how they compare ? 
  i 'd like to let you all in on a little secret , in the netherlands , pancakes are a dinner food ( although we do n't have the fluffy american style pancakes so make of that what you wish ), 
  what is your theory ? 
  . . all of them ? 
  here 's her site : http://satwcomic.com/matter-of-perspective, 
  is he saying we do n't have letters that look like cigarettes ? 
  because i 'm lost, 
  one of the rare times i saved a picture , i really like the one that shows the earth and moon to scale with proper distance , most people do n't realise how far or small it is so it 's nice to remind myself every now and then, 
  i thought the way spf worked was that if you apply something with an spf of 5 you could stay in the sun 5 times longer before you burn or have to reapply it ( i believe this is a bit of an oversimplification as solar radiation strength fluctuates throughout the day ), 
  but you do n't need to reapply a t-shirt , so how does that work ? 
  oh yeah i did that all the time when i was pretty young, 
  my parents actually have a tape of me doing it at 2 years old , but i could 've just been doing something else , like pretending to ride a horse or something , i do n't know, 
  i laughed out loud at this , good job, 
  sr :3 is amazing because it allows you to use keyboard and controller ** at the same time **, 
  i always have my controller plugged into my pc but was playing sr :3 with keyboard and mouse , i picked up my controller when driving once and discovered i do n't need to switch to it in the options first , i can just pick it up and drive with it, 
  you got it a blue toy , good job, 
  that mouse clearly does not understand how mouse traps work, 
  this just reminds me of winnie the pooh, 
  the quality was fine , but annoyingly enough it somehow messed up loading when i was 70 minutes in , and the seeker bar does n't let you skip ahead so i was stuck there, 
  just find a download , or at least do n't watch it there, 
  that 's a horrible url , why would they do that ? 
  ah that would be great , my neighbors have a not-quite-two year old that would love this game ( or so i assume ) , but only have an android tablet,

  though it does n't contain the actual interview , which you can see here : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wri2esvnne, 
  how well does this subreddit work for people outside of america ? 
  ( i 'm from the netherlands ) i think taxes can be very different across the globe , i 'd like to learn but do n't know if reddit would be the right place for me, 
  it looks a little weird at first but it seems pretty straightforward, 
  as a dutchman , i 'm not quite sure if i know what that is, 
  is this one of those cases where americans say dutch but mean pennsylvania dutch, 
  obviously , it 's missing the dots otherwise, 
  does anyone have a mirror ? 
  i get it 's a spoof , but i really do want to hear it now and unfortunately the page is gone, 
  i 'm just saying i 've only ever seen two variants of apple pie here in the netherlands , one with a latticed topping , known simply as [ appeltaart ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t1mgdt9.jpg ) ( most common , i 'd say ) and one with a crumble topping known as [ appelkruimeltaart ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3vsoyth.jpg ), 
  i suppose the image resembles the crumble one most , but it 's way too moist to be like any dutch apple pie i 've ever seen, 
  midnight , gmt-5, 
  i was never sure on how that worked , is n't it just gmt-5 but with dst instead of a new timezone ? 
  ( i.e. 
  is the gmt system a fixed timezone or does it change depending on dst ), 
  on the upside , you then have 5 tic tacs in your hand, 
  not necessarily wandless magic , could just be an enchanted teacup/spoon, 
  i see , thanks for teaching me, 
  what about utc then ? 
  also , what 's the difference between utc and gmt , they seem to correlate to exactly the same timezones , do they just have different origins but are the same for all intents and purposes ? 
  i do n't think anyone was expecting it to be more pleasant than vomiting in your own mouth,
