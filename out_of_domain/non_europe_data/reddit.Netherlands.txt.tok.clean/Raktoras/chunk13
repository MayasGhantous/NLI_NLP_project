  i like that i can cool the bottle of water in the fridge , makes water so much better , and afterwards i just refill the bottle from the tap, 
  strange that you 're so far down the page ( he was at 0 points at the time of writing this ) , i thought reddit would be all over this, 
  homeopathy is silly, 
  i wish google would just let us use the google play books app even when they have n't released the store in that country , i just want to import my own books anyway, 
  though aldiko works fine , as well, 
  does anyone know if there 's an ereader app that does dictionary definitions well ? 
  i love the way ibooks does it on ios , but so far i 've only found ones with horrible interfaces or it actually takes you to a browser screen, 
  i 've tried kindle before but could n't get my own books into it , was i doing something wrong or do they only allow books from their own store ? 
  well i 'll definitely have to try that out then , thanks !, 
  oh man , that picture, 
  * the wonderful thing about tiggers ,, 
  is tiggers are wonderful things . 
  their tops are made out of rubber ,, 
  their dicks are made out of springs . 
  they 're bouncy , trouncy , flouncy , pouncy ,, 
  fun , fun , fun , fun , fun *, 
  perhaps the color of the surfer , too, 
  i figured as much since it still keeps track of your chaos , i wonder what 'd be different about the ending . . 
  now i 'll have to play it again on low chaos, 
  he could just absorb the punch and not use the dial again , since he could probably take him out if he does n't have to worry about that punch being used on him, 
  my car actually seems to do this , i have always been puzzled by it, 
  it 's an opel corsa ( from 2004 , i think ) and when you press the lock button a second time it does flash its lights again and sounds like it locks further , pressing it more than twice does nothing, 
  i 'd shift it over by one , so 5 is bad , 6 is passable , etc. 
  at least that 's how high school grades ( or any school ) are viewed over here in the netherlands, 
  came here to make an aa joke , but this will do, 
  came here to post this , everyone should go watch this, 
  it 's a great animation about a cat piano, 
  i 've had these speakers for 8 years , maybe longer and i never noticed this ( of course , wall-e was n't out back then ), 
  also , these things have barely dropped in price at all , that 's kinda funny, 
  i 've gone through about 5 of the same kind of monitor in this way , my dad brought home broken monitors from work , we 'd replace the broken capacitor , et voila , i 've got a new monitor, 
  only 2 of them ever lasted for a significant amount of time though ( maybe a year ), 
  i think they 're just glasses at that point, 
  i have noticed i often have trouble remembering when something took place , i 'll remember the event itself quite clearly ( e.g. 
  eating breakfast ) but will have trouble recalling if i ate that muffin yesterday or a few days ago , only to later realise that it was this very morning , usually by the serial order you mentioned, 
  is this a common thing ? 
  are there things i could do to improve this aspect of my memory ? 
  i should mention this is n't a problem for me , i just notice sometimes that i can remember very specific and uninteresting details about things , without remembering at all when it was that it took place . 
  this usually only applies to things that were recent , no more than a few weeks , i guess , i wo n't be wondering if i had my first kiss at 14 or 21, 
  in that case , i 'd check the top of this thread again, 
  honestly , it seems a lot of people do n't know about the best katy perry boob video , it 's this one, 
  she 's practically topless , i 'm still not quite sure how this is allowed on youtube , i guess it 's because they 're covered in plaster , but it hides almost nothing, 
  i would n't say being raised by a gay couple is universally reviled , not even mostly reviled, 
  i 'm sure there are places in this world ( e.g. 
  many african countries ) where it would be , and i certainly ca n't speak for any country but my own ( the netherlands ) but over here i 'd like to think it 's mostly accepted, 
  glad to hear it !, 
  it 's not that interesting as both the thread name and subreddit name are referencing the same thing, 
  if you do your job well enough , nobody will know you 've done it, 
  to me serif fonts scream formality , and all the little serifs just make it looks cluttered whereas a nice sans serif font is very calm and elegant in its simplicity ( there are plenty of exceptions for both cases of course ), 
  i believe it 's still broadcast by comedy central in the netherlands , though ( i 'm not sure i do n't really watch tv anymore ), 
  not saying that means it has to have the same contracts, 
  i have to agree , but even though there 's no bad feelings anymore and i 've completely accepted it . . 
  i do still think about her, 
  but lately whenever i 'm drinking i 'm out having fun so i 'm not likely to, 
  i distinctly remember learning about this in either a chemistry or history class , probably the former, 
  what does it mean ? 
  thank you for this, 
  maybe he only just saw this topic and noticed the timestamps ? 
  i mean , that 's what happened to me , and my reaction was similar ( only i did n't immediately look at the timestamps ), 
  i found it to be very irritating with a controller , i 'd get the sticks lined up properly , then mash the trigger and somehow fail , or it just would n't open and i did n't understand why, 
  did the mashing of the trigger slightly shift the stick positions and make me fail ? 
  you masturbate funny, 
  huh , never thought i 'd be jealous of elton john 's husband, 
  the names are often listed in order of importance ( sometimes the characters ' importance , but often the actors ' ) but the picture is just something that looks good, 
  folding it back up the first time can be a little tricky though , i hope that part will be included, 
  as a dutch person , that 's what i always say, 
  but my english friends claim we 're central europe , and my american friends say i 'm northern europe, 
  honestly , i 've never even heard anyone in europe refer to anything as northern european , it 's mostly divided between east/west, 
  `` dutch '' could be translated as `` nederlander '' when talking about people ( the dutch ) but when talking about the language or using it as an adjective in any way it would be `` nederlands '', 
  i keep forgetting there 's a new pope, 
  pretty much , my point was that no one refers to it as `` northern europe '', 
  i think you 're right , i also seem to remember clark once healed a cut on his forehead in the same way ( i guess he melted it shut or something , it was weird ), 
  it aged remarkably well , i rewatched the entire show a year or two ago, 
  yeah it went downhill after the first few seasons but it still had its moments now and then , i mainly kept watching to see how they wrapped everything up , but you did n't miss much, 
  or blue , i think, 
  not so much vulnerable as just not invulnerable to it , he 's as vulnerable to magic as any ordinary person, 
  we already have one , / r/southpaws, 
  i do n't really like it a lot though , they seem to complain a lot when i 've always managed to get by just fine as a lefty with only some minor inconveniences, 
  seems to change depending on where in the world you live , though i use my cutlery in the same way as my right handed family does , it 's just the way i was taught and i prefer having the fork in my dominant hand, 
  why did that article specifically point out what the dutch name for that bird is ? 
  as a dutchman i do n't mind , because now i know what bird it is , but it does seem a little random, 
  i figure it 's more along the lines of `` if some kids could 've been that lucky , why were n't mine ? '' . 
  they 're not angry his child is n't dead , they 're angry that theirs is, 
  it 's not nice of them to take it out on the parents of the kids who survived , but they 're just going through some stuff they do n't know how to deal with and if having your kid survive means you have to put up with them , that 's a small price to pay, 
  he was using it figuratively, 
  you could just get a cast on a non-broken leg, 
  in addition to that , here 's a further explanation about homeopathy by james randi, 
  it should illustrate quite clearly that homeopathy can have no effect a similarly administered placebo does n't have, 
  23 years old here and i can barely hear the 15khz one, 
  ha , i paused spotify to play this video , and it starts off right where i stopped, 
  interview is over now, 
  more than meets the eye , indeed, 
  they do , it 's a pretty solid game during the indoor sections , but outdoors it just feels wrong, 
  i loved them , i always felt like a ninja whenever i 'd run up a building with my back to the balloon and managed to jump backwards and grab it without being able to see it, 
  i ca n't speak for spain , but over here in the netherlands i do n't think many people are aware about the racial stereotype of `` black people like watermelon '', 
  at least , i 've only ever seen it mentioned on the internet, 
  also , there appears to be a fruit basket next to the doll , it 's likely a customer that decided to be funny instead of ikea, 
  so where is this . gif from ? 
  do they usually include new pok\u00e9mon in the anime before the games come out or is this just a promotional thing, 
  well , alternatively , an employee could 've decided to be funny, 
  this feels a little creepy , posting someone else 's picture on the internet , but i like being helpful and it 's not like it is n't featured in the op,
