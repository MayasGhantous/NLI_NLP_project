  i 'm fairly sure it 's the other way around , people steal cars and shoot people , and then they made a game about it, 
  i 'd heard of it , but forgotten the name, 
  i was wondering what ever happened to this movie a while ago , nice to finally find the title again, 
  i once went to a party with a friend , had n't eaten all day , drank too much ended up throwing up ( not much , as my stomach was mostly empty ), 
  i had kinda blacked out and did n't remember this too well the next day but felt terrible and cleaned most of it up , until i got to the kitchen ( apparently i made my way to the bathroom from here once i started throwing up ) where they were cooking breakfast ( i 'm from a country where people do n't usually cook anything for breakfast , just eat some slices of bread or cereal ) and the smells were just too much for me , i could n't clean it up, 
  i felt really bad but what was i supposed to do , throw up again ? 
  well , i 'd provided them with some alcohol for the party beforehand , despite knowing nobody at the party ( other than my friend ) , i never really saw them after that ( i was on holiday there ), 
  why do they need a star to indicate the most voted option when they have percentages ? 
  perhaps he had secret aspirations of becoming a taxidermist, 
  we really never bothered to make up our own word for it and just stole it from english , we do this a lot lately, 
  but they use an actual `` d '' from the roman alphabet , do n't they ? 
  how do they refer to it in the japanese manga ? 
  even if they did n't , the manga 's / show 's title is in english as well, 
  someone should xpost this to / r/thelastairbender /, 
  i 'm just glad the dog was n't dying, 
  i like to rationalise this by having high speed thinking be a reflex to high speed movement , in other words , they only think as fast as they move , as fast as is required and ca n't manually `` slow down time '', 
  a flight to paris is # 24 ? 
  i 'm from holland and that sounds incredible to me , surely you 'd spend at least double that , and that 's probably not counting all kinds of hidden fees, 
  actually it might be quite the opposite , which may be a good thing , and it may not be, 
  now that a kinect ( and the ps4 's new controller with motion tracking ) is a necessity , developers can be sure people will own one and design their games accordingly , whereas before including kinect support in your game could be a ( minor ? ), 
  risk because it excludes a part of xbox owners which could lead to lower sales, 
  what if it 's more than a `` little happy trail '' ? 
  if not more, 
  are you saying you do n't have the window maximized ? 
  i 've never understood why some people do that, 
  as someone who lives in the netherlands , i actually had a bit of trouble finding wetshaving equipment in stores , although i do know where to get the vergulde hand stuff , is it any good ? 
  right when he widens his eyes, 
  thank you , i 'm not a pedophile but i do feel bad for them as society 's view of them is more than a little skewed, 
  a pedophile ca n't help the fact that they are attracted to children any more than i can help the fact that i am attracted to emma stone , it 's when they act on those feelings that we should start locking them up and putting them on lists, 
  only option 2 and 4 start with `` i 'm '' , the rest is either `` she 's '' or `` we 're '' , so that narrows it down, 
  i 'm a delivery guy ( i deliver foodstuffs ) and i get this all the time , you can rest assured that you really do n't stand out and i do not remember who has said this to me, 
  i assume it 's because it 's larger and better ventilated , the smells just do n't linger enough to become apparent, 
  i 'm a student majoring in cs, 
  i 've got two part time jobs ( about 4-5 shifts a week , all in the evening ) and i make about $ 600-700 a month i guess, 
  i 've got about $ 3500 in my spendings account and around $ 16k in my savings account, 
  a large part of that savings account comes from my parents , though , who have been putting a small amount in it monthly since i was born, 
  got a tram in about 5 seconds , clearly you 're doing something wrong, 
  i believe denmark is the only other country that has a similar biking culture and infrastructure ( there might be one more country , but i ca n't think of it right now , maybe japan ? ), 
  i do n't know , my parents paid for 50 % of all my lessons and exams , and it still ended up costing me about $ 1500 probably, 
  then again it did take me 4 attempts to pass the exam , so that added up , especially since it takes a while before another exam is available and you keep taking lessons in between to basically maintain everything you 've learned, 
  ridiculously strict examiner , and i kept getting the same guy, 
  the first time really did n't go well , that one i deserved to fail , but the other two times i failed were basically because he determined i did n't look in my mirrors long enough or some such , it 's been a long time, 
  i 'm thinking / u/corgana meant that just because you have to move half the legs , you 're not necessarily spending less energy as you are now supporting twice the weight per leg , which must be a lot harder on the legs, 
  whoa , did not see that last step coming, 
  what exactly keeps it together at the end ? 
  are the loose blocks they showed glued together as well ? 
  the host is a movie adaptation of a book by the same name , written by none other than stephenie meyer , the creator of the twilight series, 
  still , i liked the book , nothing too deep but it was enjoyable , ca n't wait to see this movie , did n't even know it was out yet, 
  i never realised they made a melody , i remember that it told you whenever you screwed up the order ( i guess it made a certain sound to indicate it was wrong , i do n't remember too clearly ) at which point you just redo all the previous notes and try a different one, 
  i do n't know , i used to pick and eat the strawberries on my grandpa 's farm all the time , but i think the ones from the supermarket taste fine as well, 
  i guess it would all depend on the country you 're from and the country the supermarket 's strawberries are from, 
  because harry was the only wizard in the vicinity , i believe there are wizards who do n't send their kids to hogwarts and just teach them at home, 
  yes , a fanfiction called harry potter and the methods of rationality has ( a much smarter version of ) harry doing just this, 
  the good people at / r/hpmor will tell you all about it , it 's a fantastic fanfiction ( currently only covers events of the first book but is larger by far , i believe ), 
  why ? 
  it actually prevents many paradoxes as anything that you do while using time turners ca n't change anything about the future, 
  think of it like this , i ca n't change the present by going to the past because all of those things have already happened, 
  like harry saving himself from the dementors , or hermione hitting him with that stone , it all happened the first time round ( in fact , there is only the first time round ), 
  believe it or not , this is actually addressed in the books, 
  in the fourth book when edward and bella go on their honeymoon edward mentions he picked an island in a tropical climate because the warmer temperature would warm him up and make the whole experience more pleasant for her, 
  yeah, 
  nah , twilight has the kind of vampirism where the venom present in a vampire 's mouth/saliva will start turning a human into a vampire almost as soon as it hits the bloodstream of a human . 
  it is a process that takes several days of excruciating pain to complete though , so it would n't just happen accidentally , venom has been sucked out of a wound to stop it before, 
  i believe whenever they kissed edward just kept his mouth closed ( it 's mentioned in the books ) and i assume he never licks his lips or something, 
  bring your dog to work ? 
  like , to your actual workspace , or did they have a doggy pen somewhere ? 
  something happened with last night 's guest , i did n't catch it though so i 'm not sure what happened, 
  if anyone could fill me in , that 'd be neat, 
  what an asshole, 
  ( not tb ), 
  as someone who never owned a ps3 , it 's still pretty positive, 
  technically , though , they could let you stream the ps3 games to your pc, 
  doubt they 'll do that since they want you to buy the ps4 , but it would be so cool, 
  i mean , * technically * , they could let you stream the ps3 games to the xbox one , but that would be the weirdest business decision ever, 
  i do n't know , they 're single strands , really , only the part where they attach is any bigger and that may be about the size of your hand , kind of hard to see halfway up a skyscraper, 
  although they 're usually stylized to look like thick ropes , i do n't think they 're actually that big, 
  tb sort of addressed this, 
  so yeah as long as you have a us postal address or po box anyone can enter, 
  no i 'm pretty sure the currency symbol goes in front in most countries , it does in the netherlands , at least, 
  why ? 
  it still uses humans , but instead of them on their knees slowly placing the bricks they can do it standing up , and the machine makes sure they get placed on the road, 
  it 's a lot quicker and better for their backs and knees and such, 
  just pop 'em in your mouth and nibble on them all day, 
  i want to make an incest joke here , but i could n't think of any, 
  how would they know what the difference between their vision and regular vision is ? 
  it should just seem normal to them , right ? 
  that 's why i 'm still on 4.1.2 and probably wo n't ever upgrade, 
  unfortunately , i still have n't found a way to turn off the annoying update reminder , google is being more annoying than apple in that regard , which is disappointing, 
  yeah it 's essentially a kid 's show ( and a girl 's kid show at that ) that somehow has managed to appeal to a lot of people outside of its demographic , who claim they like it because of the characters and excellent writing and such , which may even be true , i have n't seen it, 
  this is very dependent on how you use youtube , personally i 'm subscribed to large number of channels so every day there are several high quality videos waiting for me that i watch in * at least * 720p , but usually 1080p without any buffering required on a 30 megabit connection, 
  i also do n't really have loading/playback/seeking issues , every now and then a video will stop loading but i know this is because of my own network problems caused by my router, 
  the netherlands , so you 're right about that, 
  i can generally find what i want using youtube 's search , but i do n't often start on youtube by searching for things , only if i want to find a video i 've seen before, 
  though i agree , youtube causes more problems for me today than it did 1-2 years ago , even if it 's not too bad today, 
  pay close attention to the larger part that breaks off , as it moves to the right it grows at the bottom, 
  it would prevent the water in the air from condensing onto your windshield in the first place , it would n't form and just immediately slide down, 
  i do n't see why he would overheat , if he just coats the outside it should n't prevent the shirt from soaking up sweat, 
  besides even if he completely coated his shirt inside and out his shirt should still breathe , so it would n't get hot under the shirt and his sweat could still run down his body the way it would do if he was n't wearing a shirt, 
  that could get a little dangerous then , though i thought i 'd seen claims that it does breathe , perhaps it depends on the fabric and number of coats,
