  not always an option , i know the theater i go to often only shows the 3d versions, 
  if only they included password criteria at log in screens , i 'm usually able to figure out what i had come up with that way and it sucks having to go to account creation to see it, 
  though i suppose that 's a little tricky with changing criteria , they could still offer the information for current and perhaps even past criteria, 
  wow , that 's crazy , my bank uses at least 2 step authentication for everything, 
  it is indeed your isp that 's throttling speeds, 
  i usually have the opposite experience as op , ads looks like shit and load slowly whereas i can watch full hd youtube videos without buffering, 
  is that canon ? 
  as in , is that really what some religions believe ? 
  because that does n't sound very omniscient, 
  mummify is the word you 're looking for, 
  but all videos are already reviewed , right after it 's uploaded it 's processed by youtube, 
  it 's during this process that youtube checks for infringing content , it would n't be too much trouble to then also cancel out that part of the audio, 
  as a current retail worker , fuck these cans in particular, 
  also for some reason the ones with slices instead of chunks do stack , it makes no sense to me, 
  i actually slept through the sale after voting on it , feeling pretty bad about that, 
  that only changes what the browser saves , nothing else, 
  he 's actually called dug , though, 
  i 'm also fairly certain joss whedon has been confused for a cosplayer before, 
  man , how fun must it be to be able to get away from all attention and not have to keep up any pretenses and just geek out at something like this, 
  i mean it 's pretty fun for you and me , but it must be extra fun for celebrities, 
  yeah , i can fit 48 games in one maximized full hd window, 
  i do n't know anything about keeping frogs , and the picture could be misleading , but that seems like a tiny tank, 
  terrible segue , but i like your taste in music, 
  where can we see the timelapse ? 
  this looks amazing !, 
  pim 's are lu biscuits , so yes, 
  lu is the brand , and they 're french , not american, 
  you could try your luck asking / r/malefashionadvice, 
  well how is he supposed to know that , he 's missed the front page for a couple days, 
  lefty here , have n't had any trouble with this myself , but have n't played many wii games either, 
  i have played super mario galaxy ( 1 ) though , and i do n't get your problem there, 
  you do n't know whether to hold the wiimote or the nunchuck in your dominant hand ? 
  would n't right handed people have the same issue ? 
  you can switch it around to your preference and it does n't affect gameplay, 
  context is hot , also i 'd much rather see someone who wants to show off her nudity than someone who is getting paid for it, 
  i mean , i assume the ones getting paid also want to show it to some degree , but it 's just not the same, 
  when it comes to porn , homemade is ( often ) just better , but there are exceptions to both sides, 
  yeah , it 's not that you ** would ** have sex with her , because you 're in a relation , or you do n't want to have sex or whatever your reason is . 
  the point is that the ** reason you would n't ** have sex with that woman comes from yourself , not her, 
  he ca n't post the study because you can not study it, 
  you ca n't keep track of how many times you think of something without skewing the results , unless you teach yourself to note whenever you 're thinking about sex and keep a tally , all without it interfering with your regular train of thought, 
  `` am i thinking about sex ? 
  . . well , i am now . '', 
  as a dutch guy who recently visited america for the first time , i have never seen toilets like yours before , and i 've been to at least a handful of countries in europe before, 
  dutch toilets tend to be either like [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xattrcr.jpg ) or [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k8sq5cm.jpg ), 
  from what i 've seen american toilets are fairly similar to the former , only your bowls are almost half filled with water at all times ( except when flushing , of course ), 
  there was a kid flash , though, 
  but even he was a teenager , i think, 
  demolition man did this , not quite a horror story , though, 
  no , but illusions are often reflections, 
  euro here , we do n't really use promille much , except to refer to blood alcohol levels , which are usually given as such, 
  promille can also be read and written as per mille ( and other variations ) , like you could read percent as per cent , cent meaning 100 and mille meaning 1000 of course, 
  i was for some reason mindlessly tapping the version number , and this popped up, 
  did not see that coming, 
  the text at the bottom fades out after a few seconds and tapping the screen brings it back , other than presentation purposes i ca n't imagine this is a very useful screen, 
  ah , that did it, 
  how useless , i like it, 
  well not right now , [ as he 's dead ] ( http://deadspin.com/5871954/this-guy-died-this-year-shrek-the-unshearable-sheep ), 
  but at the time , yeah that must 've felt great, 
  if wow was f2p , i 'd instantly buy mists of pandaria and start playing on and off again, 
  that 's just not true , we 've seen ingame footage , or at least ingame screenshots ( i forgot which it was ) a few months ago, 
  you may be thinking of cyberpunk 2077 , made by the same studio , since that one is 2-3 years off, 
  i 've already got / r/guildwars2 to keep me busy , i 'd just like to return to azeroth every now and then, 
  its art style is very different from any of the other monkey islands , but the other ones are very good too , ( well , maybe with the exception of 4 , that one is n't as good ), 
  it 's a bit of an old game , though , so it can be tough getting a hold of it . 
  but definitely try to , it 's an awesome point and click adventure game, 
  but the sizes might not be right for eclipses ( total eclipses , at least ), 
  yeah , i 'm just saying there are factors that make it possible , even if we do n't know how likely it is, 
  aaaand it 's gone, 
  so i 'm still on 4.1.2 since i was afraid of the slowdowns , but would like to update to 4.3 now, 
  does anyone know if i can go straight to 4.3 from 4.1.2 ? 
  right now the update reminder still says it 's for 4.2.2 , do i have to this one first , before i 'll get the possibility to update to 4.3 or do i just need to be patient until the 4.3 update is rolled out to me, 
  i mean , we may as well just update to 4.2.2, 
  best case scenario , we immediately get to update to 4.3 . 
  worst case scenario , we have to run 4.2.2 a few days before 4.3 is rolled out everywhere, 
  nah if you just run the update everything will take care of itself , you wo n't lose any data and you do n't need to clear it either, 
  i mean , unless you 're not on a stock rom , then i do n't know how the process works, 
  okay , so as soon as i installed 4.2.2 it immediately gave me the download for 4.3, 
  / r/perfectloops , get on this, 
  gorillas actually have a penis bone , and as such you could say they 're always hard, 
  i 've got a 1920x1080 version of this , best i can do, 
  that would require a monitor with an aspect ratio of 32:9 though , which do exist but are very expensive, 
  also you rarely stretch a window across the two monitors ( i ca n't recall ever doing it ) so the bezels do n't interrupt anything, 
  now if you were to go with a 3 monitor setup and play games with eyefinity , then the bezels might be annoying but if you 're going with that kind of setup , the bezels are going to be very thin anyway, 
  yeah , having to pay everything in cash when i went to the us was a little annoying, 
  dutch guy here , this is called fierljeppen ( means far leaping in frisian ) and is a very amusing sport to watch if only for the guys that do n't make it, 
  i highly recommend trying it yourself, 
  i ca n't recall , but all you need to know is in the comments, 
  was about to say , i 've been going to university there for years and a large part of my father 's side of the family was born there , yet i was unaware of the lights, 
  rotterdam university of applied sciences , which is just called hogeschool rotterdam if you live there but in english it 's a university, 
  oh it is intentional , todd howard actually told emil pagliarulo ( senior designer on skyrim ) to make them work in both english and the dragon language,

  i 've seen whitening companies claim that it can last up to 1-2 years depending on the things you consume ( coffee , red wine , smoking and more though those are the worst ) but i 've also seen them claim that it really whitens the teeth from he inside and that it really is undoing the staining that has occurred over the years, 
  but if that 's the case , i do n't see why it ca n't last decades , if you do n't consume the bad stuff and take good care of your teeth, 
  it might spoil the jokes for your own playthrough, 
  ca n't wait to play this with my gaming buddy , the last one was hilarious and the gameplay for this seems amazingly fun, 
  usually a lot less , and only if the service was excellent , so it 's common not to tip, 
  at least that 's usually how it works here in the netherlands, 
  does n't work when you have res , as every reply has a link that says `` source '', 
  found that out the hard way,
