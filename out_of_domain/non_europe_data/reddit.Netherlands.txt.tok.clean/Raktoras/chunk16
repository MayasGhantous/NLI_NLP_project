  instead , `` video link '' should work well, 
  [ first thing i thought of when i saw this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=lye3rihlpti#t=41 ), 
  they 're working on a transparent version though , which would be neat for things like this, 
  i do n't think that comes off as being a dick , it 's a good question, 
  i assume you 're mostly just using your muscles and the weight of the hammer to do the job , you do n't necessarily put your own weight in there and as such the most that might be more difficult is getting a good swing going with shorter arms, 
  i 'm sure he manages just fine, 
  the way to do this is to include some strings in your output, 
  for example ,, 
  system.out.println ( number1 + number2 ), 
  would become, 
  system.out.println ( number1 + '' + '' + number2 + '' = '' + number1 + number2 ), 
  this would then output `` 1 + 2 = 3 '' ( assuming your inputs were 1 and 2 ), 
  if you have any further questions let me know, 
  right you are , i thought about adding them for a second but left them out , but if you do n't use the parentheses it 'll just concatenate the the number to the string , thus making it impossible to add the second number, 
  thanks for correcting me, 
  a colleague once brought some candy back from thailand and they tasted so strongly of dirt it was ridiculous, 
  they were n't even disgusting , just a really strong flavour of dirt that lasted all day long ( i tried brushing my teeth twice to get rid of the flavour and it did not work ), 
  on top of this it also smelled of dirt very strongly , within seconds of putting it in my mouth you could smell it throughout the entire room , really bizarre candy, 
  edit : i just realised `` dirt '' can have a few meanings in english , i should 've used earth , i guess, 
  literally drinking some as i was viewing the pictures, 
  i showed the bottle because a glass would n't have been much proof that it was grimbergen , now would it ? 
  [ piglet needs to shut his fucking mouth ] ( http://imgur.com/a/cuypu ), 
  yeah i really cherry picked them , most of the animals are dicks, 
  be honest , how bad is the stubble ? 
  it 's an american thing , the cups are called solo cups , they 're quite well known over there, 
  this is the second time today i 've seen you show your kraken, 
  makes me thirsty, 
  i believe the point that / u/baddox is making , is that apple is the one to make these features popular and desired, 
  but that 's more the definition of a trendsetter , not an innovator , even if apple usually does an exceptional job at implementing features, 
  surely ipas are a subset of the pale ales ? 
  what units are you using that amount of fuel per distance would make sense ? 
  no matter if you 're using liters , gallons , miles or kilometers , it 'd always end up as a number below 1 ( unless you really get awful , awful mileage ), 
  ah , was n't aware of that , and i 'm european myself, 
  if the story does n't have to be adapted from books it means there are no comparisons to be drawn , and we would n't end up with pivotal moments in the story that are hard to translate from book to film, 
  i 'm genuinely excited for this, 
  mind you , i have n't done any skyrim modding , and i do n't know how the game was built but i imagine it only records that the item is a dwemer museum key , and the number that tells you how many you have , not thousands of separate instances of the item, 
  are we talking torrents or is there any place we can watch it legitimately in europe ? 
  really ? 
  but chalkboards are way more annoying, 
  maybe i 've been working in retail for too long , but i 'm not really affected by crying babies anymore, 
  i would n't necessarily call it dumb , but having easily distinguishable bills is pretty useful , indeed, 
  i 've got a bunch of bills leftover from a trip to the usa and i honestly ca n't tell them apart without looking at the numbers , whereas i can see exactly what 's in my wallet of euro bills at a glance, 
  or if you 're cheap , killing a hardcore character and flying around the map posthumously, 
  you 'd be missing quite a bit of content , i 'm afraid, 
  but at least you can take all your upgraded tools and money , it 's not like starting over , you can go right back to digging at ( your current ) top speed, 
  whoa , this was taken in the netherlands ? 
  i was n't aware we had any wild foxes, 
  interesting , ios6 runs perfectly fine on my iphone 4, 
  can confirm that it does not work in the netherlands, 
  however they do have the hoodie , even if it 's a bit more expensive, 
  you make it sound like you 've lost your roommate and are trying to find them, 
  dutch person here , the only reason i ever take my shoes off is because it 's more comfortable , growing up i usually always had my shoes on, 
  if i know i 'm gon na go outside in not too long , i 'll keep them on as well and we always tell people entering our house to just keep their shoes on , too, 
  could be it , euros are thicker than us coins, 
  yeah i 'm just playing ftb on a locally hosted server with a friend of mine , and we 've been unable to play in the little time we had today, 
  it 's a little annoying that minecraft 's drm is not letting us play, 
  edit : just realised i can set the server to offline mode to skip authentication , please disregard my complaints, 
  you 're thinking of the cartoon called `` i am weasel '', 
  and baboon says `` i are baboon '', 
  just felt like adding that, 
  i just spent a good minute looking for a frog . . 
  i need to learn how to read properly, 
  depends on where you live, 
  it really falls apart with the moon scenario , and there are two other moments where you 're allowed ( forced ) to put portals on moving platforms , but saying portals ca n't be moved * relative to each other * would solve a lot of problems, 
  correct , although placing a portal on the moon was such a cool ending that i 'll allow it, 
  exactly , asgardian magic does n't have unlimited potential , if you apply enough force you will eventually overpower the spell, 
  pc , terraria 1.2, 
  it 's an enormous update , have a look at the patch notes if you wish :, 
  south here , never heard of kasseien , we call them kinderkopjes, 
  though i 'm sure it differs from place to place, 
  i agree , i 've definitely seen those kinds of containers used for ice cream , but the colors looks very funky , i wonder what flavor it would be, 
  one of my math teachers in high school did the same thing , we all loved it, 
  i do n't have ocd but whenever a teacher wiped the board and left a few letters in a corner it always drove me nuts , so i really appreciated this teacher 's dedication to a clean blackboard, 
  for some reason that 's where sinterklaas stays during the rest of the year, 
  like how santa lives on the north pole for whatever reason, 
  maybe , but it 's not like it 's a traditional dutch thing , it 's only existed for a few years as far as i 'm aware, 
  i love the word `` queue '' , it basically has 4 consecutive silent vowels, 
  if you 'd like to extend that taskbar onto your second monitor as well you should look into [ displayfusion ] ( http://www.displayfusion.com/ ), 
  it 's also on steam , if you 're into that, 
  a placebo is basically your brain being fooled by expectations , so because you 're expecting it to be faster , you 're experiencing it as such ( even if it may not be noticeable ), 
  i , too , have that same case with a cx 750m ( do n't know the difference , honestly ) and my cablemanagement looks very similar to yours , only my gpu 's power comes from the side not the front, 
  did you have a lot of trouble routing your cables along the back of the case without too much clutter ? 
  i think i did alright , but it was n't easy, 
  oh , of course , i ca n't believe i did n't notice that yours was n't, 
  unfortunately i use way too many drives and i needed two cables for my sata connections and two for their power , so my modularity did n't save me much trouble ( it did save me some though ), 
  i 'll see what i can do , the lighting in my room is fairly awful though so my pictures often do n't come out nice, 
  did you actually just record this for op ? 
  if so , that 's pretty awesome, 
  although , it is n't getting faster, 
  30 '' by 20 '' is pretty big , it 's about halfway between a1 and a2 , about 76cm by 51cm, 
  the problem is that if it is n't high enough , the cats do n't have enough time to right themselves in order to slow their fall and land properly, 
  really ? 
  i mean it 's a pretty powerful image , but that kid is way too old to have been miscarried, 
  right , the browser may keep cycling through the frames but they 're not being rendered so it saves cpu power, 
  of course , depending on the browser webpages may be rendered a little bit offscreen as well to make scrolling smoother, 
  that actually makes sense , i can see that, 
  where do you put the welcome-sign on an island ? 
  or maybe if the drink is hanging from the cup holder ( with as much of the drink below the holder as possible ) it 'll swing slightly in turns , avoiding spillage, 
  agreed , it 's like seeing a helicopter 's blades spin slowly on camera, 
  although the timing is very impressive,
