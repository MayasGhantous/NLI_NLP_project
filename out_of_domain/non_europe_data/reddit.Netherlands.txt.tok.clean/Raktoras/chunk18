  yes , they 're called [ intrusive thoughts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intrusive_thoughts ) and are perfectly normal, 
  unless you have trouble dismissing these thoughts and actually want to carry them out , i would n't worry about it, 
  thank you for that , i used to think that sonic booms were caused by sound waves ` piling up ' so to speak , because the essentially could n't get away from the object ( in the direction that the object is going , at least ) as it is going the same speed , and that made sufficient sense to me that i did n't question it, 
  so as this pressure increase would be even higher at supersonic speeds , is there really just a sonic boom at the moment of breaking the sound barrier , or does it persist after breaking it ? 
  i suppose the standing wave would n't continue to exist , and you made it sound like that was the only thing causing the boom , are there any special effects like sonic booms at even higher speeds ? 
  are those distances to scale ? 
  i always assumed two stars would not be able to get really close without colliding so that planet 's orbit must be enormous, 
  thanks for the numbers !, 
  so why do some companies still physically destroy hdds ? 
  is it just being overly cautious and do they acknowledge that it is n't really necessary ? 
  or is this due to raid configurations in which there might be enough redundancy that it becomes somewhat more likely to recover data ? 
  ( not that this would affect the odds significantly on the whole ), 
  well , the characters are introduced in the first one , as is the love story between thor and jane . 
  they also make some references to the avengers movie in which loki was the bad guy and it is what landed him in asgardian prison . 
  other than that the story is its own and the antagonists are entirely new . 
  it probably did n't for demonstration purposes, 
  right ? 
  why were they so excited ? 
  this makes a lot of sense , actually, 
  thanks !, 
   you can actually feel when you drive from the netherlands into belgium, 
  i like belgium , i really do , but this is so true, 
  that 's interesting , peanut butter is pretty common in plenty of countries i think ( i know it is here in the netherlands ) and when i tried some root beer when i was in america it tasted pretty good, 
  edit : although i have to admit , we do n't put it in our candy and chocolate like you do with reese 's cups and such ( found that to be a bit much ), 
  nah , born in 1980 i believe, 
  i may be off by a year , but that would mean he 's still 34 at most ( as his birthday is in july ), 
  i do n't think he was honoring the anthem , but the athletes it was playing for, 
  could just be me , though, 
  a hippo could probably kill a tiger without too much trouble , those things are dangerous as fuck, 
  but i do n't know if hippos and tigers share any territories, 
  that makes sense , kyros probably revealed his true identity but after being turned into a toy , people only remember him from when his identity was unknown, 
  i quite like the look of your keyboard , i 'm not a fan of mechanical keyboards either, 
  what does a torch do ? 
  wow , none of those percentages correspond to the size of the slice, 
  why not ? 
  is n't that what they 're called ? 
  so what is it called then ? 
  oh okay , so why is the term clay pigeon frowned upon ? 
  it 's what we call them in dutch , so it 's definitely not just some nonsense term, 
  dutch guy here , what provider do you have ? 
  i pay quite a bit for 2.5 gb , though it made the phone a lot cheaper so it was worth it in the end, 
  pretty sure this is what came with the collector 's edition , you could try ebay, 
  cue *, 
  would n't normally have pointed it out , but you claimed to normally be a grammar nazi so i thought i 'd help you out !, 
  i 'm guessing the great wall of china or some pyramid or temple, 
  edit : or , you know , skyscrapers, 
  the for loop on line 64 has an int j that goes up to the last index of the matrix , but in your checkcolumnforsameness ( ) method you then try to access matrix [ j +1 ] [ i ] , which wo n't be possible in the last iteration of the for loop on line 64, 
  at least that seems to be it, 
  since you 're comparing array values to the one that comes next , you do n't actually have to compare the last one to the one that comes next , you could do what you 're doing in the for loop on line 130 ( and remove it on line 130 as it is unnecessary ), 
  so on line 62 turn this :, 
  for ( int j = 0 ; j < matrix.length ; j + + ), 
  into this :, 
  for ( int j = 0 ; j < matrix.length - 1 ; j + + ), 
  and on line 130 turn this :, 
  for ( int i = 0 ; i < matrix [ j ] . length - 1 ; i + + ), 
  into this :, 
  for ( int i = 0 ; i < matrix [ j ] . length ; i + + ), 
  you can remove the - 1 on line 130 since you never attempt to check an index higher than i , so you should n't have to worry about the index going out of bounds, 
  well , i think that could just be random chance , but i also think i know what 's skewing the odds, 
  look at your code , here, 
  public static int checkrowforsameness ( int [ ] [ ] matrix , int i ), 
  / / if all values in row i are the same , then return that value . 
  / / otherwise , return -1 . 
  int intreturn = 0 ;, 
  for ( int j = 0 ; j < matrix.length - 1 ; j + + ), 
  if ( matrix [ i ] [ j ] ! = matrix [ i ] [ j +1 ] ), 
  intreturn = -1 ;, 
  else, 
  intreturn = matrix [ i ] [ j ] ;, 
  return intreturn ;, 
  your idea here was probably to go through all values and set intreturn to a 1 or a 0 if they 're all the same , and at the end return that value or otherwise return -1 . 
  unfortunately you keep rewriting intreturn without doing anything with it , until at last after the loop is done you return the value that was last set . 
  to remedy this , i would make one change , like this : ( line 9 in this snippet ), 
  public static int checkrowforsameness ( int [ ] [ ] matrix , int i ), 
  / / if all values in row i are the same , then return that value . 
  / / otherwise , return -1 . 
  int intreturn = 0 ;, 
  for ( int j = 0 ; j < matrix.length - 1 ; j + + ), 
  if ( matrix [ i ] [ j ] ! = matrix [ i ] [ j +1 ] ), 
  return -1 ;, 
  else, 
  intreturn = matrix [ i ] [ j ] ;, 
  return intreturn ;, 
  this way you immediately return -1 if you encounter a difference instead of overwriting the -1 you may have set earlier by keeping on checking . 
  you should do the same thing for checkcolumnforsameness ( ), 
  i must admit i have n't been looking at your whole code , just until i came across something that did n't seem right . 
  i 'm running your code myself , and there are a few things that need changing :, 
  * when you write row and column in your output , you use their index , which means `` all 1 's on row 1 '' is really referring to row 2, 
  * when checking the major diagonal and sub-diagonal , you only check the first row and first column against the second row and second column , when instead you want to print `` not same numbers on sub-diagonal . '', 
  and exit out of the method when you come across a difference , but otherwise not return anything and print `` all 0 's on sub-diagonal '' ( or whatever value ) at the end of the loop . 
  * you only check if nocolumncounter is equal to 3 , instead of comparing it to matrix.length on line 73, 
  * on line 165 you do matrix [ i +1 ] [ matrix.length-i-1-1 ] , but instead of -1 -1 you could just do -2, 
  honestly , it 's pretty late for me and i do n't even know if your method of checking the sub-diagonal makes sense ( or what the sub-diagonal is ) but at least the rest of the code should work . 
  as soon as anything inside a method returns a value that stops the method from executing further , so it 'll just stop there . 
  this means the for loop does n't iterate any further , and the program will never get to that last line in the method . 
  ( unless , of course , it never has to return the -1 ), 
  no problem , if you change the checkmajordiagonal ( ) to have a similar structure as checkrowforsameness ( ) it should work ( so print a value when you encounter a difference and exit the method , and otherwise keep going and print something at the end ) . 
  seeing as system.out.println ( ) does n't actually return something you can just write a return ; after it and it 'll stop the method , since you 're not actually returning a value this works even though the method is defined as void . 
  you just made me realise i 've had the subreddit style turned off , i 've been missing out, 
  this is how i got myself through rock tunnel the first time , before i learned flash was a thing,
