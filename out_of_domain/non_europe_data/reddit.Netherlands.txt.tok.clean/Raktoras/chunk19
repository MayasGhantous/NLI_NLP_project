  do you have to be 13 years to use it , or do you simply need permission from your parents if you 're under 13 ? 
  i do n't know , you would n't say i took a picture of millions of people if i pointed the camera at the floor, 
  if i 'm thinking of the same game ( and there have n't been enough tomb raider games lately to really mess me up on this , i think ) it was n't a plane but a boat, 
  the rest fits , though, 
  a way to do it is just copying the url and pasting it into the spotify search on your desktop client , it 'll open the playlist, 
  that was a very informative video , thanks for posting it, 
  logically , that still does n't make me * believe * in a god , at most i could act like i do, 
  and bananas are berries, 
  you could build around someone else , yeah , though you 're never really trapped as you could suicide and choose to respawn elsewhere, 
  i assume this would depend on the country and its cost of living , but a figure like that does n't sound that surprising, 
  yeah if i remember right their language just has a lot of compound words, 
  so instead of saying `` yellow snow '' , it would be `` yellowsnow '', 
  for your east scatcat pleasure . 
  apparently they 're switching to direct download, 
  source : http://torrentfreak.com/spotify-starts-shutting-down-its-massive-p2p-network-140416/, 
  i believe the unlimited subscription , the one in between free and premium , is no longer sold in europe ( maybe outside of europe as well ? ), 
  with free you can listen to any music , an unlimited amount of times ( used to be a subscription feature only ) , but you get ads , and on mobile you ca n't choose what you listen to specifically but you can listen to certain playlists on shuffle, 
  with premium you can listen without ads and make playlists available offline on both computer and mobile devices and mobile the way mobile works is equivalent to a computer with this subscription as well, 
  unfortunately the word `` source '' does n't help much when you 've got res , as every bloody post has the word `` source '' under it, 
  this post is at the top now anyway , so it does n't matter, 
  this claims two dutch isps limit bittorrent bandwidth , which is illegal under our net neutrality law, 
  i 'm not saying they do n't , but it seems more likely to me that this information is either outdated or misleading, 
  this is not true , we 've been celebrating it since the late 1800s , where it started as prinsessedag , celebrating princess wilhelmina 's fifth birthday at the time . 
  this eventually became queen 's day , and once juliana ascended the throne the date was changed to her birthday . 
  as we all know , beatrix decided not to change the date to her own birthday , but willem-alexander has resumed the custom, 
  i assume so , though the ones for smaller bins are usually more akin to plastic bags instead of the thicker black plastic regular garbage bags are made of, 
  i still do n't see how that allows isps to throttle bandwidth , what i 'm downloading may be perfectly legal, 
  i ca n't really explain it better than wikipedia does : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supersampling, 
  basically , though , it 's rendering the game ( or anything , but we 're talking about games here ) at a larger amount of pixels than the screen has , and then shrinking the image , which makes it so you have more information about each pixel and makes for better anti-aliasing ( smoother edges ), 
  in summer the room itself can become quite hot , though , which in turn makes it a lot harder to keep the coolant , well . . cool, 
  yeah , pretty much, 
  there 's also subsampling , which scales the image up from less pixels . 
  this does n't look as good , but makes for better performance in games, 
  eh , while there is a general consensus that the books lag a bit at some point , i forgot which books exactly , i think you 're at the worst of it , the people over at / r/wot ( do n't visit unless you want spoilers , they try not to spoil but it will happen ) all agree it 's worth it in the end, 
  if you 've made it this far i would recommend finishing , the book do pick up pace , especially at the last 3 books, 
  the only warning i 'll give you is that perrin 's storyline is going to get really drawn out for the next few books , feel free to skim through his chapters or read a summary somewhere once you 're done with a book, 
  sanderson did a fantastic job with the ending ( by that i mean all 3 books he did ) and and i 've heard from lots of people that they viewed it as a refreshing change of pace while still staying true to jordan 's writing , you are right to be excited about the wrapping up of the series ( and after that you should go to / r/wot to discuss your take on things ), 
  i listened to the audiobooks as well my first time , and it is part of why it seems to go slowly at times , since they take longer . 
  i do n't know what you 're using to listen to them , but if you 've got the option of playing at double the speed , or even 1 1/2 the speed i would recommend it for perrin 's chapters ( unless you really like his character , they 're certainly not bad chapters and they have their exciting moments , it just sometimes feels like not a lot happened at the end of one , and there are plenty of them ) . 
  on the other hand the next few books are some of the shortest books ( the last 3 being some of the longest ) , and you 're well over halfway done , it 's honestly not ** that ** bad, 
  would it be possible to just get one eye done ? 
  if it turns out well , get the other done , if that one screws up , you have one good eye, 
  really , you think of [ she-hulk ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=she+hulk&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=isch ) to kill your boner ? 
  if you go by country the dutch are the tallest according to wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_height, 
  ( i 'm dutch myself , and i ca n't help but feel irrationally proud of that ), 
  there 's been speculation that it was in part due to our diet , as we consume a lot of milk and dairy . 
  i 've learned milk is sometimes considered a children 's drink in other countries , we drink it at all ages , often at breakfast , but also at other times, 
  i can not refute your logic , but as we are taller on average i would say we also consume more dairy as kids ( we also eat a lot of cheese ) and simply grow more in the time we do grow, 
  or as / u/browncoat23 said , perhaps we do n't shrink as much later on, 
  in dutch ( and other languages ) they 're literally called `` seadogs '', 
  huh , never really thought about that, 
  my initial response to your comment was something like : `` but they 've got an excuse , they were n't born with a penis !, 
  no need to be ashamed or anything '', 
  at which point i realised guys with a micropenis were * also * born that way , so that should be no reason to feel ashamed either , but i can see why for both types of men this would be very difficult, 
  maybe this is a long shot , since i do n't know what fields you 're interested in , but if you want to try mixing fiction and science ( real science , not fictional science ) you should take a look at something like [ harry potter and the methods of rationality ] ( http://www.hpmor.com ), 
  it 's fanfiction , which probably sounds even worse than fiction , but the word does n't do it justice . 
  it 's brilliantly written , has a lot of science in it ( not just physics or astronomy , it has a lot of social sciences in it as well ) and does n't require you know the original harry potter books or movies ( though i 'd say it adds to the humor , as it tends to make fun of things taken for granted or that are even praised in the originals ), 
  there 's also a fairly active community at / r/hpmor, 
  uh ... what ? 
  would have never imagined it works like this . 
  i expected steam to be the one who generates steam keys , after all , how else do you know you 're not generating the same key some other publisher has generated ? 
  secondly , why do there need to be any keys involved when i make a purchase on steam , surely the game 's id is simply added to my account , which in turn gives me access to the game 's files that are residing on steam 's servers and steam passes on the appropriate amount of money to the publisher, 
  would love to learn some more about steam 's workings, 
  i 've seen this quite a lot on netflix over here ( the netherlands ), 
  worst example i 've come across is not having the fellowship of the ring, 
  ah , so they 're not steam keys , they 're keys for non-steam activation of the product , gotcha, 
  that 's why you do n't put it in the sink , you reuse the cup and just leave the spoon in the cup until they go in the dishwasher, 
  in case anyone does n't know the reference , [ here you go ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/popping/comments/yoibk/this_may_not_be_the_appropriate_place_but_i/c5xta25 ), 
  if anyone wants to know more about various ways to represent ip addresses : http://www.pc-help.org/obscure.htm, 
  to add to that , dutch for german is duits, 
  you can actually just double click the words it gives in the definition as well to get a new definition , usually that does it, 
  i believe it works as long as your language is set to english, 
  is n't most ( if not all ) dark chocolate free of dairy ? 
  it 's kinda what sets it apart from milk chocolate, 
  seeing as that ship was not his , nor his father 's , i always assumed those ships can just create those kinds of suits , and his father being an ai could just easily customise it like that, 
  happy birthday , dude , it 's my birthday too !, 
  as a dutchman , i find that dutch sounds like intelligible english, 
  do n't worry , it does n't exist, 
  ... yet, 
  try this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtwbpyjjqru, 
  it has slow motion !, 
  but their uniforms say `` feuerwehr '', 
  definitely , since he mentioned the fact that he owned a house as being relevant, 
  this is from the ( excellent ) fanfic called [ forging the sword ] ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/forging-the-sword ) , it starts at the end of chamber of secrets , and up till that point it follows the original canon , it goes a little different afterwards , but this quote should n't be a real spoiler to anyone , as this whole topic is about dealing with the chamber of secrets :, 
   [ he started , surprised . 
  `` what ? 
  please , professor , i want to be here when ron wakes up . '', 
  he looked at her , not above pleading , `` hermione does n't have to leave . 
  what can possibly be more important ? 
  '' ] ( #spoiler ), 
   [ `` i 'm sorry , mr. potter , but they need to ask you to open the chamber of secrets . 
  the aurors want to search all of it . '', 
  her expression remained stern , but a hint of concern softened her mouth . 
  '' ] ( #spoiler ), 
   [ he met the waiting group of aurors at the entrance to the headmaster 's office . 
  professor mcgonagall introduced him to the ten men and women , ( one of whom , it turned out , was actually not an auror , but an expert from the department for the disposal of dangerous magical creatures ) and only about three of whose names he remembered by the time the introductions were over . 
  then the professor rested her hand on his shoulder a moment before she murmured her best wishes and vanished up the stairs to dumbledore 's office . 
  ] ( #spoiler ), 
   [ `` so , mr. potter . 
  dumbledore said that there was a basilisk down in the chamber before you killed it ?
