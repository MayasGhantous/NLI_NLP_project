  `` shot at the bmw museum in munich , these balls were attached to strings from the ceiling and together they created three dimensional shapes including a car . '', 
  i 'd have me get more upvotes, 
  hot damn !, 
  maybe an insult to his father , but not racist, 
  he is merely acknowledging the fact that his daddy is the best in the world , excluding non-white people, 
  just smile at her and say `` do n't worry , you 'll be the first to know '', 
  and then just keep smiling at her, 
  they broke up last year but dated since 2002 or something ( i know this because like half of the people in here i just read her wikipedia page ), 
  and yes , macauley culkin, 
  i know this girl whose mother has an identical twin and their husbands are brothers , i ca n't remember if they were twins as well though, 
  what 's funny is that the daughters that resulted from both marriages look very much alike , they 're within a year of each other and if you did n't know them you 'd think they were sisters instead of cousins, 
  they are also both quite hot, 
  that one always gets me, 
  silent tears , running down my face, 
  same thing i 'm doing now , study computer science and afterwards develop amazing software, 
  perhaps i 'll make a wow-killer first, 
  i 've been told i have soft earlobes, 
  i hate doing this , but he only put the stone from the ring in there ; not the ring itself, 
  i still laughed before realising this though, 
  whenever i read or heard about the `` energizer bunny '' i always thought that was what the duracell bunny was known as in english, 
  edit : `` the duracell bunny was originally trademarked for use in the us and other countries . 
  duracell failed to renew its us trademark of the bunny and as a result , lost it . 
  energizer , seeing an opportunity , trademarked a new bunny for its use . '', 
  i do n't care if that 's how these things work , that 's just a dick move, 
  i just upvoted because it has a picture of a dog !, 
  [ this man can ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuvhqgf6bv8 ) ( almost ), 
  i 'm a courier for a small restaurant that also delivers and does takeouts and i always do this when i get to the street i have to be at and have to start looking for the correct house, 
  especially when it 's dark, 
  yeah it 's a recently introduced feature , you can even drag from one chrome window to another, 
  possibly other browsers too , i would n't know, 
  i 'd say that 's a pleonasm , but i wo n't complain, 
  til, 
  day 2 here , just got my email, 
  only if the water is warm , i do n't think there are any warm water pokemon, 
  although it would make sense if the water was body temperature , assuming water pokemon are warm blooded, 
  you know , as far as magic animals with insane amounts of water inside of their bodies make sense, 
  dutch guy here , i can usually tell the uk accents apart quite easily , not sure if i can tell the difference between australian and new zealand accents as i 'm not sure how nz accents sound, 
  i personally speak with an american accent though , comes much more natural to me ( due to american tv ), 
  ... or pot ? 
  just having a vacuum inside of them would help even more, 
  but neither would help much , it 's not like air weighs a lot, 
  first thing i tried, 
  have an upvote, 
  upvote for browsing reddit while using the toilet, 
  i was about to comment on this , i was taught 9 and 3 and that was about 4 years ago ( in holland , if that makes a difference ), 
  i do n't really see why it matters , it 's just something i 've wondered for a while, 
  beautiful dogs look up at you ? 
  i could live with that, 
  it 's a cool idea , but i think the ring would just fall off as you ca n't really put it on your finger, 
  which are just the only 2 results that came up when i set the resolution to 3840 by 1080 and searched for `` beach '', 
  i recommend omitting the keyword and just browse random wallpapers of that size , it 's a great site with lots of good wallpapers ( and a lot of shit ones ), 
  because it 's a bit tricky to find : http://www.myspace.com/fuckingnarly/photos/44984391#%7b%22imageid%22%3a44984391%7d, 
  it 's got comments from 2 years ago and seems legit , does n't necessarily mean op is lying but i 'm not sure what to think of it, 
  well the picture is the same one as the one shown in the op, 
  the whole point is that it has existed elsewhere ( happens to be myspace ) a long time ago, 
  a mirror would n't really prove anything and kind of goes against the point of xtravis_bicklex 's post, 
  would n't stepping aside make us pedestrians as well ? 
  people will learn , hopefully, 
  but even if they do n't all is not lost as all the dynamic events scale , so if they 're throwing 100 players at this monster and they 're too chaotic to win , players will give up and walk away leaving far fewer, 
  i 'm assuming ( and hoping ) it 's the better players that will stick around and the event will scale down to accommodate the new amount of players , but the average skill of this group is then significantly higher, 
  [ fry and laurie 's version ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8ko2nck_he ), 
  i do n't know man , a lot of the obvious choices have been mentioned of course ( harry potter , pok\u00e9mon ), 
  i honestly think about this a lot , too much probably, 
  i 'd probably pick the harry potter universe but another cool one would be the twilight universe, 
  i do n't care that i 'd sparkle as if i 'd been swimming in glitter , the vampires in that universe are like gods, 
  i usually vary between 2-7 all week long, 
  i usually go 2-3 times a day , and i 'll score a 7 ( this makes it sound a lot better than it is ) a few times a week, 
  my mom says it 's not a good thing , and seeing as this started when i was 14 and once had a stomach inflammation ( or something , i was young , it 's about 8 years ago ; i ca n't remember precisely ), 
  it 's never bothered me though , watery poo is easy to clean, 
  you people should look at the album [ saturday morning apocalypse ] ( http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=powerglove+saturday+morning+apocalypse&amp;aq=0 ) by powerglove, 
  i 'm not a big metalhead , but it 's pretty awesome, 
  as one redditor once said , there 's nothing hotter than context, 
  [ link to the largest wallpaper version of it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oxbcz.jpg ), 
  as provided in the . zip file on the page, 
  looks pretty nice, 
  i do n't know :(, 
  it was around the time i stopped lurking and made this account , so about 2 months ago ? 
  upvote for asking the important question, 
  no it 's not , skateboards have wheels under them ; they 're designed to move , they 're * supposed * to * move *, 
  yet half of these tricks were done while standing still or while barely moving, 
  i 'm not saying it was n't cool , it was very cool ; but do n't say this is how it 's supposed to be done because that just does n't make sense to me, 
  but the title reads `` this is how you are supposed to skate . '', 
  i 'm not saying this is n't legitimately a style of skating , or that it was n't executed well, 
  it 's just that i disagree with the title, 
  a friend of mine recently started blogging about random musings concerning games , and he got to play a demo a while back, 
  while he loved it he certainly had some negative comments, 
  you can read about it [ here ] ( http://blog.poweredgamers.com/2011/07/roots-of-guild-wars.html ), 
  i agree with you , mostly i think the issue was that he had 30 minutes to see this game and got only the shallowest of glances at something that goes much deeper, 
  of course it is , the more butter the better ( because it allows for more hagelslag ) , the soft cool butter mixes very well with the drier chocolate, 
  although i have to admit i 've never mixed the chocolate kind with the fruit kind , the best kind is white chocolate mixed with dark chocolate ( it comes like that in the package , you do n't mix it yourself ) unlike regular white chocolate it is vanilla flavoured i believe, 
  i like setting my alarm early when i do n't need to get up early so i 'm actually aware of sleeping in , instead of just waking at noon and not being able to really appreciate it, 
  waking up in the middle of the night does n't usually happen to me unless i have trouble sleeping so i do n't really enjoy it then, 
  pretty much , i guess `` proud of our boys '' would be a little more accurate but it 's nearly the same thing, 
  your dutch does n't suck that much , and to be honest unless you are dutch i think you can get away with the fact that your dutch sucks, 
  edit : after reading carenot 's link below ( or above by now , who knows ) i 've come to understand that the boys they 're referring to is our national football ( soccer ) team , and not our army as i assumed when i first saw this picture, 
  i thought it was at first , because it would almost act as a regular mirror for him, 
  only fred would n't be crying , of course, 
  in inglorious basterds near the end when they 're introduced to hans landa while undercover as italians , brad pitt 's character ( forgot his name ) who supposedly speaks italian the best out of all of them says in a horribly american accent `` bongiorno '', 
  hilariously unexpected, 
  the friends i watched it with and i did the same thing , as well as the `` arrivederci '',
