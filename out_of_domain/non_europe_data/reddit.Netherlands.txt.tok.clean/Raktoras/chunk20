  '' ] ( #spoiler ), 
  i wo n't go any further , you 'll just have to read the fanfic yourself ( it really is pretty good ) , this occurs in chapter 3 though , if you want to read it just for this part, 
  i 'm looking at this car , and i 'm pretty sure that in my neighbourhood this guy would not be able to legitimately park his car, 
  all the parking spots are perpendicular parking spots , and none of them are long enough to fit a car like this, 
  as long as you had permission to have them in the first place , and you 're not showing them to anyone else and they have n't requested you to get rid of them , i do n't think it 's morally wrong to keep the pictures, 
  i 've got some pictures that , while not featuring nudity , are fairly private pictures and i 've kept them simply as a keepsake , to remind me of the happier times with that person, 
  and if you 're talking about people fapping over the pictures , it 's not as if they do n't already have the memories of them, 
  i was n't arguing legality , but morality, 
  if someone is n't comfortable with me having access to their nude pictures , despite being granted access to them before , to me , it would n't feel right to keep them, 
  no , not necessarily , i did n't specifically say you were morally obligated to , just that if `` you had permission to have them in the first place , and you 're not showing them to anyone else and they have n't requested you to get rid of them '' you were morally obligated to , i was n't claiming that hinged on the request to get rid of it or not , but for me it would play a part and likely depend on the circumstances, 
  do n't be , it 's not a proper planet !, 
  though since it does include our moon , an argument could be made , i suppose, 
  yeah , but i ca n't see what i 'm doing so i 'm likely to skip spots , some mirrors or a camera would be necessary and that 's just too much work, 
  what ? 
  obviously it would n't have been right below his post before he posted it , there 's no need for him to have seen anything, 
  his comment was n't above or below anything until he actually posted it , though , there 's no need for him to have seen any comments at all, 
  yeah , they 're apparently on a pier in that frame, 
  faster than that , even , depending on the observer, 
  when people talk about the flash they 're usually referring to barry allen or wally west , but i believe the first flash was jay garrick ( he was the guy with the weird disc on his head ) but i think his limit was somewhere around the speed of sound , so he does n't quite compare to the others, 
  then there 's also been a kid flash , bart allen , who is actually from the future or something, 
  there may have been others , i do n't actually read that many comics anymore , and their respective top speeds change all the time depending on the plot and writer, 
  i believe they 've all existed at the same time in at least a few comics , but usually they 're not all the flash at the same time , the title gets passed around, 
  well , flash is typically several orders of magnitude faster than quicksilver , but in dofp quicksilver was much faster than he normally is without any sign of having to strain himself , so it 's hard to guess what his limit is there, 
  then again flash 's abilities are more than just `` goes fast '' because of the whole speedforce thing ( e.g. 
  he would n't have to brace someone 's neck to prevent whiplash ) so probably still flash, 
  basically the white gel that makes surfaces able to have portals on them is made with moondust or something , it 's mentioned in portal 2, 
  i guess you could call it a spoiler if you have n't come across that yet , but it 's not like it ruins any plot or anything , it 's just some trivia , you 're good, 
  as soon as i read `` ball peen hammer '' the only thing i could think of was this, 
  i believe robert jordan had originally planned to write a few books that basically follow new spring and focus on moiraine and lan , unfortunately those will never be written now, 
  in case you have n't yet , you should definitely crosspost this to / r/astrophotography, 
  smoother than a billiard ball apparently, 
  to be fair , text behaves the exact same when you drag a selected portion , so that part was n't really showing us anything, 
  the rest still applies , of course, 
  yeah , the air bender symbol is three spirals , whereas this is a [ triskelion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/triskelion ), 
  damn , you are * fast *, 
  yeah all i could think was `` that looks uncomfortable '', 
  not that that matters , of course , but we do go through the trouble of cushioning them , so it just seems odd, 
  it really does , this coming from a guy who was a pizza delivery guy for over 3 years, 
  driving around singing along to my music was fun , but if i could 've been doing that with my girlfriend in the car i would never have quit, 
  right , so how do you adjust this standard to an immortal species ? 
  they 're never old enough ? 
  or the number does n't matter , it 's just arbitrary and maturity is the only thing that counts ? 
  over here in the netherlands i heard they 're now increasing the size of kid 's clothing because kids have gotten fatter, 
  as in , increasing the amount of centimeters in the waist , etc , not the size number, 
  doctors are arguing against it , as it only makes the problem worse by hiding it, 
  4 gb is a decent amount , and may be sufficient for your needs . 
  the thing with memory is , it does n't make your system faster , it just lets it do more things at once without getting really slow . 
  this is because once the memory fills up , and you want to load something else into memory ( this happens when you open a new application , a new browser tab , play a movie , pretty much any content that was n't there before ) something old will have to be taken out first and written to your hard drive , and once you switch back to whatever you took out of memory , it 'll have to be switched with something else . 
  now this is a fairly slow process , and can give you trouble when you have many things open at once , or when you 're playing video games that have rather large levels, 
  if you do n't experience this issue ( because you do n't do many things at once on your computer ) there 's no need to get more memory . 
  those graphs do make me wonder how much of those numbers are skewed due to kids being more likely to live with their mom than their dad if their parents are separated, 
  i 'm probably making a lot of assumptions there , like it being more likely to be abused by a parent if they 're separated , but those numbers do look a little disproportionate to me, 
  or maybe that just goes to show how ingrained some misconceptions are, 
  i do n't think i 've ever read or seen any spider-man comics or shows that are n't in english , but i 'm pretty sure carnage is still known as carnage here in the netherlands, 
  we did n't establish a frame of reference , it will always go down and it will also always go up, 
  it only took five names , so this could 've also occurred during the switzerland - france game, 
  but i was laughing pretty hard as well, 
  why is it a good idea , what are the disadvantages of referring to your own product without the trademark ? 
  weed made me puke , once , i 'd been drinking alcohol , but was n't very drunk , then came the weed and it just got me insanely dizzy and i had to go throw up in the toilet, 
  felt a lot better afterwards , if still a little dizzy , continued to drink for the rest of the night, 
  i do n't smoke a lot of weed though , maybe i 'm sensitive to it ? 
  probably does n't help that i was taking pretty big hits off the joint, 
  ios is n't perfect , but neither is android, 
  lots of android phones come with bloatware from samsung and the likes that is hard to remove , of course that 's not android 's fault , and i know google is trying hard to get vendors to stop including it , but it is there on a lot of popular android phones all the same, 
  as for sd cards , phones like the nexus 5 also do n't have sd slots while still being really popular, 
  i 'm not an apple fanboy , i think the company is fairly arrogant and steve jobs was an asshole , but i love my iphone 5s . 
  the form factor is great and it looks very sleek , ios also looks and feels great . 
  i 'm not saying android does n't ( especially since jellybean ) , because i also love my nexus 7 , but apple added just a little bit more polish, 
  i 'm a software engineer , and i enjoy open systems because of their versatility , but my phone does n't really have to be like that , i use it to stay connected , take pictures and browse the web and i just want it to do its job well and to do it fast . 
  many android users would say you have to get a custom rom to get the best experience , which is much the same as jailbreaking an iphone, 
  right , i somewhat lost track of your point after reading too many comments , i suppose, 
  still , i 'm not even sure what `` 100 % useful '' means, 
  the title of the book was : `` gezocht : redder in nood ! '', 
  which is dutch for `` wanted : savior in need ! '', 
  ( where ` need ' of course refers to the person wanting a savior , not the savior being in need of help ), 
  i thought that was uncomfortably fitting, 
  no , you have n't overlooked it , the standard camera app lacks that feature, 
  it 's being added in ios 8 , though , this picture is just ahead of its time ( or they were running the developer build of ios 8 , but i bet they just used an app ), 
  pretty much , yeah, 
  it 's the dosage at which it 's lethal 50 % of the time, 
  apparently about 10 % of people have got it, 
  sure , but apple 's lightning connector is fairly thick , which makes it very strong , but also means the port on the phone is fairly large , as a result it 's pretty easy for lint from your pocket to go into it, 
  i 've never had this issue with my old iphone that had apple 's old connector , or with my phone before that which had a standard micro usb port , as neither are completely empty and a little smaller ( or at least thinner in the case of apple 's old connector ), 
  if you keep any electronics in your pockets that use regular usb ports or maybe just mini usb , i 'd imagine you run into the same problem more often as well, 
  still sort of unnecessary , the shirt 's just slim-fitting , judging by the shoulders it 's not too small . 
  i guess the dude is n't skinny , but he 's not fat either . 
  it could stand to be a little less tight maybe , but it does n't look bad to me,
