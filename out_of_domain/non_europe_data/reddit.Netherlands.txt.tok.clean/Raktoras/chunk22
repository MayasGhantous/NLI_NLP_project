  you say that as if it 's a bad thing . 
  if that 's what they enjoy , then that just means there 's a lot more stuff out there for them to enjoy , does n't it ? 
  i feel like i have to step in to object and plug / r/hpmor, 
  rational fanfiction can be very good, 
  similar images have been posted here a bunch of times after a company tried to make one and as far as i 'm aware they could n't pull it off due to costs :, 
  so that does make me wonder who is selling this , and whether it is n't a scam, 
  ah , i missed the fulfillment info . 
  very cool it 's finally been made then , i 'm seriously considering buying this, 
  it depends on the part of the world , but i believe in general o + is more common than o -, 
  it 's even more like the [ erasmus bridge ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=erasmus+bridge&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=jlsavyqjfyovu_odguaf&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq&amp;dpr=1 ) in rotterdam, 
  really ? 
  i always thought seasons were a pretty globally universal thing . 
  now that i think about it i 'm not sure why i ever assumed that , but there you go . 
  thanks for teaching me something, 
  i would n't be surprised if this is different depending on the country it takes place in, 
  i mean they are beans , how long can they feasibly be kept without spoiling ? 
  it can be a guy , what do i care if i 'm in a coma, 
  perhaps , but captain america actually mentions that the air is getting thin at some point and that they should get the people off, 
  i always thought that the point of that saying is that both are viable options , but just do n't half-ass it, 
  those are two different things . 
  table  : last-child, 
  this selects every element that is a direct descendant of a table and also the last child of its parent ( so the last element of every table ), 
  table : last-child, 
  this however selects every table that is the last child of something, 
  to be fair everything you exhale into the paper is obviously stuff that * did n't * stay in your lungs , it does n't really prove anything about what does stick around in there ( though i 'd assume it 's more than what comes back out ), 
  i suppose you would use it with a tea pot or if you did n't care too much to get it exactly right, 
  you 're getting close to just minifying the code at this point, 
  i 'm not too bothered about that , it was trying to hide from the humans so it camouflaged itself both visually and thermally . 
  they said that some of the dinos could sense heat , making your body temperature match the surroundings to hide seems like a very instinctual method of hiding . 
  hey i 'm actually taking a trip to norway in about a month , will probably visit oslo , do you know the specific bar ? 
  maybe its horizontal fov is larger than its vertical fov, 
  i 've seen pictures of such an aftermath , but it 's not necessarily dangerous , is it ? 
  i know for a fact my toilet can handle people a lot bigger than me , and i 'm barely leaning on my legs at all , so most if not all of the weight is resting on the seat . 
  as for weight distribution , the seat itself would distribute a lot of the weight around the toilet bowl would n't it ? 
  yeah i also do n't , anytime i do ( just to try it out ) it results in piss everywhere except where i want it . 
  wonder if this is another shitting while sitting versus standing thing where half the population does it one way and another half the other way without realising it . 
  i got that from danish , the resemblance is really striking, 
  i mean , it 's definitely better than the old one , we 'd just gotten used to that one . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_for_google_done_in_house.php ) explains pretty well why the new logo is really great and excels at its purpose . 
  though according to the pie chart it 's mostly empty , which does n't make any sense with those numbers, 
  actually , all he has to do is remove himself from the gene pool in order to be considered for a darwin award . 
  dying is the most common way but becoming unable to reproduce in any other way works, 
  topic specific bulletin boards . 
  like subreddits ? 
  i suppose reddit has the whole voting system that helps though, 
  you could try facebook , the search feature goes way beyond just typing in someone 's name : https://www.facebook.com/find-friends/browser/, 
   i ca n't use a quick filter combo box because quick filters can only apply to a single data source . 
  it seems like the better feature would be to allow quick filters to apply to multiple datasources , or am i missing something ? 
  while technically true , these days it usually refers to the display resolution . 
  so yes , op , 4k means 4000 pixels . 
  you can read more about it on wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4k_resolution, 
  my steam link works with my xbox 360 wireless controller when i plug the official 360 wireless dongle into the steam link ( i used the usb port on the side , though i doubt it matters which one you use ), 
  the dongle lights up and it seems to pick the controller up pretty much instantly , no configuring or manual pairing necessary . 
  if the dongle is n't lighting up for you i assume it 's either the usb port or the dongle itself that 's causing issues . 
  i suppose it could be a software issue , is your steam link up to date ? 
  ( not sure if there 's any way to check this ), 
  does n't that only work when the phone is connected to a charger ? 
  really cool image , but unfortunately it 's actually 2765x1555 instead of uhd, 
  [ here 's an actual uhd version ] ( http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/e/2/6/highres_170064102.jpeg ), 
  it 'd probably be best to rehost that image somewhere , but i do n't know what sites preserve quality the best, 
  they say it quite a lot in this old commercial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdi23gvixz8, 
  i believe they 've actually changed their name recently , but i have no clue what they changed it to ( probably a more internationally recognized version ), 
  if you 're going to do this , would it not have made more sense to have the chairs facing the other way , so that the ladder ca n't slide off and then support the chairs from the back ? 
   considering you 're on a computer , buy < this thing for consoles , 
  that 's not very logical , now is it it ? 
  dutch person here , i 'd be pretty surprised if a stranger suddenly struck up a conversation with me . 
  like / u/derpgamerftw i always thought us dutch were more like scandinavians in that regard . 
  ( having said that , a friend and i asked a norwegian man for directions in oslo and he was quite chatty ), 
  live south of the randstad , but i went to school in rotterdam for 7 years so i 'm very familiar with it . 
  maybe it 's just me being more introverted and people taking the hint . 
  it 's not like i never spoke to strangers , but it certainly was n't common, 
  really ? 
  i 've always had invites disappear . 
  for example when playing rocket league , or speedrunners it often happens that my friend invites me into a room/party but i was loading the game as he did so i have to wait for it to finish loading before getting to the invite and it 'll either have disappeared or stopped working after 10-20 seconds or so, 
  the site looks very nice , i might use this sometime !, 
  though on large resolutions , one page worth of images is n't enough to reach the bottom of my screen , meaning i ca n't scroll to trigger the loading of further pages , so you might want to add some more images to a first page until it reaches below the bottom of the screen . 
  for now zooming in is n't a terrible workaround , but i was stumped for a bit thinking that your front page categories barely had any pictures in it . 
  it does n't seem to get a lot of good reviews , a lot of the issues seem to center around delivery being slow and stock being inaccurate . 
  if you can read dutch ( or use google translate ) you can see a lot of reviews ( on one of the best dutch tech sites ) here : http://tweakers.net/shopreview/7403/max-ict-b-punt-v/shopreviews/, 
  so what if a package gets installed as a dependency , but i also use it on its own ? 
  is this detected ? 
  everything between the ** amino acids ** and the ** fatty acids ** is what the amino acids are made up of, 
  yeah that would be a huge optimization , another one , albeit much smaller , would be to initialize j at 3 , seeing as his odd numbers would never be divisible by 2 . 
  that 's a good point, 
  very nice set !, 
  may i suggest one to add ( in case you had n't seen this one before ) : http://imgur.com/1fq4ovq, 
  steam streaming works pretty well , but has the downside of high delay which can be annoying if you 're speaking over something like skype or teamspeak, 
  two great ways of playing a singleplayer game like this are simply sharing a screen through skype or using nvidia 's gamestream software if your graphics card supports it . 
  they both have their own downsides , though . 
  for example , skype screen sharing does n't seem to work with exclusive fullscreen applications , and nvidia 's solution seems to have the opposite problem where it will only stream exclusive fullscreen applications ( which does mean that if you can use both of them you 're always covered , and i believe the latest beta of gamestream also streams windowed applications ) . 
  furthermore skype does often decrease framerate or image quality ( or both ) but i find it 's not so bad that it 's an issue . 
  nvidia 's solution has the added benefit of builtin voicechat , so you can hear each other and the game , without his pc sending you your voice back to you , it has the downside of only allowing 1 hour long sessions right now , but nothing is stopping you from just starting another session once it 's over . 
  it even lets you send your input to your friend 's pc to play his game while he watches , or to play as a player two if the game supports it . 
  to me the new ones are at perfect ripeness , i like my bananas with just a hint of green on them, 
  actually , whisky comes with its own set of rules to fully appreciate it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw1te_miu5i, 
  i 'm not sure why but i 've never used or ran into hierarchies before with tableau ( other than seeing the option to create one in a context menu and not paying much attention to it ) . 
  one thing that 's not immediately clear to me from googling a bit is whether the option to drill down is available to the end users of the published workbooks , or whether this is only available in the tableau desktop client ( that 's all i 'm seeing in pictures and videos ), 
  currently not near a pc where i can experiment for myself, 
  that 's great !, 
  i 've been looking for something like this for a while now , i 'm glad i found out it exists,
