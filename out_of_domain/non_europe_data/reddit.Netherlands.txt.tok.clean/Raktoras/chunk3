  well , we did say other things to each other but as a greeting or goodbye it was used almost exclusively, 
  as someone who has always shaved using an electric shaver , i 'm not even quite sure what the purpose of shaving cream is, 
  i imagine it 's to make the hair more flexible or the skin more smooth or something along those lines ? 
  i really loved the vats at the end, 
  so where in the game does this occur ? 
  is it just one spot ? 
  and if so is it easy to miss ? 
  i live in holland and i get a bit over 3 mb/s , which is the cap my isp puts on it , not valve, 
  i think your main concern should that you 're still on a 1024 by 768 resolution ( i 'm guessing as your taskbar is missing ), 
  [ here 's what that same site looks like for me ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9akgq.jpg ), 
  ( horrible jpeg compression courtesy of imgur ), 
  the caption reads : `` that the grey heron eats frogs , moles and rats is known , but nature photographer ad sprang went like this : & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; when he saw a heron cautiously approach a young rabbit . 
  the heron drowned the rabbit before it ate it . '', 
  of course it did n't really say he `` went like this : & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; '' but it may as well have and seemed to be the best translation of a dutch saying , the literal translation of `` keek de ogen uit '' would be `` watched his eyes out '' which sounds as strange as this story, 
  i 've got a few of these , from my school as well, 
  one of them is even the same colour red, 
  will post pictures of disassembling later, 
  malfoy * is * an utter douche , the fact that tom felton seems to be a genuinely nice guy speaks volumes about his acting skills if you ask me, 
  it 's so easy to find porn nowadays , i remember back when i was young and there were no good ( free ) pornsites , and i used to download porn by searching for various porn related queries ( `` boobs '' , `` sex '' , `` naked '' ) in kazaa, 
  and it took ages to download one picture . 
  and then it was a virus, 
  i do n't know if it works with ultramon , but i use [ displayfusion ] ( http://www.displayfusion.com/ ) for my multimonitor wallpaper needs , and it works like a charm, 
  ca n't remember what the limitations of the free version were , but i 'm sure you can figure out a way around them, 
  oh please , the british ministry of magic had the only time travel devices in the whole world and was giving them out to teenagers so they could attend classes ? 
  i highly doubt it , there have to be more elsewhere , or similar devices, 
  this should be the top comment , have an upvote, 
  making a church out of lego is good, 
  but whoever designed this seems to think you 're not allowed to match colours and that they have to conflict a much as possible, 
  as anyone with lego experience knows this is only the case when you do n't have enough of a certain colour and as i assume they 're making and painting the bricks themselves , this should not be the case, 
  also i realise that the gaps are there to show it 's lego ( it would just look like a regular ugly building otherwise ) but it 's still silly, 
  still , makes a little more proud to be dutch, 
  i would , but all you do is make me read, 
  so you feel like you nearly dodged a bullet ? 
  i hope you do recall that neo got grazed or perhaps even hit ( unclear ) by two of those bullets, 
  could have been three , i 'm afraid it 's been over a year since i last saw the matrix, 
  [ far fewer !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duqlzxiizqa ), 
  [ because they are fucking terrifying ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8olu7znwq0 ), 
  knowing his schedule , probably somewhere in the next 6 hours, 
  i know i 'm a bit late to the party and this probably wo n't get noticed now , but i hope you somehow read this comment, 
  you should watch this film , [ my penis and i ] ( http://www.vimeo.com/4619491 ), 
  while my own penis is n't below average , i still found it very interesting and even comforting to see how someone dealt with having a small penis , there is also a sequel but i ca n't remember if i 'd seen it or not ( also available on vimeo ), 
  it 's not that people always lose just one sock , but you do n't notice the times when you lose both, 
  seriously ? 
  over here people are wearing these during the summer as well, 
  they do n't look amazing but i 've seen worse, 
  have you ever not been able to master a trick ? 
  as in , you knew the specifics , but could n't perform it because it was too hard or quick or something along those lines ? 
  noun : a cunning or skillful act or scheme intended to deceive or outwit someone . 
  seems apt to me, 
  i agree , perhaps penn and teller will be able to help him out, 
  you 're right , i have n't, 
  i guess he made some reference that just went over my head ? 
  i did , thank you !, 
  i kind of want to remove my original reply now , downvoting myself will have to do, 
  ... wait , we can do that ? 
  i rarely remember my dreams but i 'm fairly certain the last time i had any kind of unpleasant dreams was about 10 years ago , and that was something mild like dreaming that i was too late for school, 
  real nightmares ? 
  do n't think i have ever had one , if the descriptions i 've heard from others are accurate , i 'm fairly certain i would remember if i did, 
  at mach 3 it certainly would n't , it 's only at the sound barrier itself that a sonic boom occurs, 
  see how it works is that when you move as fast as the soundwaves you create , they ca n't move away from you ( not in the direction you 're moving , at least ) and they pile up , and create a lot of noise, 
  at least , that 's how i always thought it worked , someone should correct me if i 'm wrong, 
  she was n't my password , she was my wow account name, 
  well , until the switch to battle.net accounts, 
  is nutella then usually the only brand available ? 
  i find that very interesting, 
  there are probably dozens ( or more ) of different brands here ( holland ) , every supermarket will have their own brand , and usually sell 4-5 other brands ( amongst which is nutella , which is given no special status over others as far as i 'm aware ), 
  to me , this is like finding out you only have peanut butter or milk from one specific brand ( you do n't , do you ? ), 
  really ? 
  i 've been there years ago but it did n't remind me of hogwarts at all, 
  it was a pretty cool place , sure , but it 's all shops and it 's so open that i do n't get a castle feeling, 
  besides it 's not a castle it 's a church , right ? 
  now if we were to compare this to hogsmeade or diagon ally , i might agree, 
  or the netherlands, 
  to be fair , we often use mayonnaise as well, 
  also you seem to not be dutch , yet know our patat , who are you ? 
  i 'm dutch , ama about our fries/chips, 
  i was at a gaming convention last saturday and as ubisoft was represented there , they had hired an actor to dress up as ezio ( or it could 've been altair actually , i wish i could remember the specifics of his costume ), 
  her costume looks at least as good, 
  he did his poses and movement very well though , gently moving me aside by my shoulder as he walked past me in the same way as in the game , pretty cool, 
  i just realised how vanilla i am, 
  fuck not showering with your dad . 
  when i was little i showered with my dad , and he would lift me up and i could reach ** all the way to the ceiling **, 
  if that 's wrong , i do n't want to be right, 
  largest i could find on the internet ( through google ) is [ 1280x720 ] ( http://www.hd4download.com/images/1phim/imaxhubble/3.jpg ), 
  it 's apparently a still image from a film called [ imax : hubble 3d ] ( http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/imax-hubble-3d-blu-ray/21232/ ) which is available on blu-ray in 1080p , so i assume a full hd version should be somewhere, 
  that 's the best i could do, 
  .003 % of the population ( of earth , i assume ) is still about 21 million people, 
  extremely rare things happen * all the time *, 
  edit : as pointed out that is of course 210 thousand , not 21 million, 
  oh , right ; of course it is, 
  i did not live up to my own iq and maths skill , i blame that on alcohol, 
  let 's see if i can get it right this time , though, 
  my point still stands , the current birth rate is about 19.4 ( that 's the amount of births per 1000 people , per year ), 
  if there 's .003 % chance that your child will have such a high iq , that still happens 4074 times a year , or about 11 times a day, 
  yes , i realise that, 
  i did n't realise that in my original comment , but i certainly did the second time, 
  haha , of course it 's extremely rare , i 'm not trying to downplay that, 
  but it does happen * a lot * , and because of that i find it funny that on a site which attracts millions and millions of people there are those who think it is unlikely any of its members have ever witnessed ( or met someone who is ) such an occurrence, 
  i get what you 're saying ( or perhaps i do n't , i do n't have an iq of 182 after all .
