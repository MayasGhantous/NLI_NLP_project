  except it kind of is , and aubergine is also the dutch word, 
  that 's 2.07 billion pageviews , not 2.06, 
  other than that , good job, 
  sweet , i guess my job here is done, 
  a good list , but you missed out one of the most important features : the dynamic event system, 
  basically guild wars 2 has no quests ( of course it has quests ) , you do n't go to an npc and skip through some dialogue to get a few quests that you then grind through on your own , instead they have the dynamic event system that will allow you to discover your quests on your own , to walk up to a some troubled area which will then automatically tell you what the objectives are there and you can choose to participate in the event, 
  there is no competition between resources ( whether it be monsters or mining nodes or something ) because all events scale to the amount of players involved and every participant gets their own share of the loot, 
  it 's designed so that there is never any downside to cooperative playing, 
  that 's also why they removed the three role combat system ( tank/healer/dps ) so that you never have to wait 30 minutes for that tank , instead take whatever profession comes your way , whether it 's a full group of warriors or necromancers it 's likely that with some good strategy and teamwork you can pull it off, 
  but diversity will of course give you more of an edge, 
  am i the only one who read the title and thought to himself : `` well clearly we should all fucking stop speaking '' ? 
  can someone explain to me why that says `` 1 jack daniels '' 16 times , instead of just `` 16 jack daniels '' ? 
  the thing is if people do n't participate you can just do it on your own , all the events scale from 1 person to at least 100 , there are a few that you ca n't do on your own ( i think ) but you can just leave that alone, 
  seeing as it does n't really feature traditional quests , people will be more interested in participating in this , so i do n't think you 're ever likely to be on your own, 
  but that 's something that remains to be seen , of course, 
  i hope the nda on the closed beta will lift sometime soon, 
  ... cereal ; quick , easy , and covered in facts about dinosaurs, 
  or almost everywhere in the world , save for a handful of countries, 
  just tried out the free version and subsequently bought the full version, 
  it 's a great game that i 'll definitely see myself playing , and i 'm not just saying that because it 'll make me seem like such a nice guy ( it does , though ), 
  i should say that with too many explosions on screen the game tends to stutter just a little sometimes ( on iphone 4 ) , i 'm sure you 're aware of it but i felt i had to inform you nonetheless, 
  also how did you make a version for android and one for iphone ? 
  did you develop it in such a way that you could just generate both versions ( like develop it in unity ) or did you first create one and then port it to the other ? 
  any specific problems you ran into developing for multiple platforms ? 
  i love when things actually make me laugh out loud, 
  upvote for the use of the symbol of sarcasm, 
  it 's what the dutch call their own country , the netherlands , in dutch, 
  also it is apparently a place in texas, 
  yes , there is !, 
  with the [ english spelling ] ( http://g.co/maps/hwtbk ) , so it really is all even, 
  i could complain about the outrageous prices of dvds or cds , but i 'm going to have to be honest and say i do n't have a clue what those actually cost, 
  no , i am not giving this man an upvote, 
  while he is correct on both points , the first one is n't relevant, 
  yes , it is a retriever ; but that was claimed in the title , labradors are also retrievers, 
  what he should 've said was that it 's a golden retriever, 
  i do appreciate his second point , though, 
  he was trying to disprove your point that there could be intellectual debates on software in a thread of hot gifs of women slapping their own asses, 
  i thought it was generally a bad idea to sleep with a baby in your bed due to the obvious danger of crushing the baby when you roll over , was i wrong ? 
  well you can switch to the old graphics at any point during the game , but you can keep the voices if you want !, 
  no , what i think the op means is that the browser window is n't actually square , but is missing the bottom left chunk so the video player fits there, 
  which is probably not possible under windows as i have never seen a window that is n't square , but who knows, 
  your best bet is probably dual monitors as suggested by jianxioy either above or below, 
  upvoting you for that edit , that 's hilarious, 
  why on earth would you link to 2 minutes into the song ? 
  play it from the beginning , man, 
  upvote for tim minchin , though, 
  can you ? 
  that 's pretty interesting , i 've never really dealt with the windows side of application development , mostly just simple coding , i 'm curious how you 'd achieve it, 
  anyway , the content flow should n't be a big problem for a web browser , html takes care of pretty much all of that ( or the layout engine , whatever ), 
  [ oh ] ( http://xkcd.org/1010/ ) , [ you ] ( http://xkcd.org/1012/ ) !, 
  you are correct ( i think crysis 1 had dx 10 support ) , this is footage from crysis 2, 
  what the hell , i am watching that episode right now, 
  are we talking about the juice in pickle jars that the pickles are kept in , or juice made of actual pickles ? 
  yeah you 'll never find me on / a / or / v / despite me liking anime and manga , and loving video games , i love / co / though, 
  although to be honest it 's probably been a year since i 've been on 4chan , i guess it kind of got replaced by reddit for me, 
  gotcha , thanks, 
  maybe they think i 'm trolling ? 
  i 've just never heard of it, 
  as far as i 'm aware most dutch people are n't even really aware that technically holland is n't a synonym for the netherlands , and i 've certainly never heard anyone complain, 
  then again , perhaps it 's because i 'm from holland, 
  edit : oh , just saw someone post this link below http://vandale.nl/opzoeken?pattern=holland&amp;lang=nn, 
  i guess it * is * an synonym, 
  well , i am both so it varies, 
  but in both cases i mean the latter ( it is also synonym after all ), 
  i 'm a lefty and originally used my left hand for the mouse , but it was tedious switching the mouse over for right handed use whenever a friend of mine was over and we took turns playing some game or something so i switched to using my right hand for the mouse, 
  i do n't recall it being much trouble to switch over , barely remember using my left hand for it , in fact it 's a little awkward operating a mouse with my left hand now, 
  those differences are fairly interesting , i 'm bilingual myself ( native speaker of dutch and fluent in english ) and i find myself thinking in english quite a lot , usually when exposed to the language ( hearing it , reading it , writing it , speaking it ), 
  i also keep running into situations where i can express myself better in english than i can in dutch , the vast amount of words in the language is pretty cool, 
  what language do you think you can express yourself in most freely ? 
  also , what variant of the english language do you speak ? 
  ( british , american , australian , etc. ), 
  i 'll have to disagree with that , or at least wonder what the boundaries of immersion might be in this context, 
  i 'm dutch and i 'm fluent in english , which i picked up almost exclusively from tv and computer games ( including a pretty good american accent , mainly due to hollywood movies and tv shows and such ) , i 've always been top of my class in the mandatory english lessons at school ( from ages 11-18 ) and never really studied it at all at school because i usually knew all the grammar ( not the rules , but i just got it right , mostly ) and most of the vocabulary, 
  i did pick up some vocabulary from school , but you can pick that up almost anywhere these days with english being used nearly everywhere now, 
  but other than that i had never been to england or america up until a few years ago , when i spent one week in england, 
  i do , but for entertainment value only , i do not care to be informed about the game , i want to see someone funny enjoying themselves while playing a game, 
  i 've watched some by various people , but i really enjoy jesse cox from omfgcata 's videos , that guy just cracks me up ( seriously , most of his lps ; the witcher 2 , skyrim , deus ex : hr , amnesia , crysis 2 ), 
  [ link to the exact moment ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=f9amvq6c5tm#t=436s ) , for the even lazier, 
  do n't they just crawl back out of their shells if you wait a bit ? 
  well it 's the same logic being used by both the video game and this picture, 
  so , yes, 
  yeah , i have to say i 'm pretty glad people do n't get in the habit of just leaving their cart at their parking spot over here ( holland ), 
  having to insert a coin enforces that , but lots of supermarkets have carts without locks and people always take them back , it 's considered very rude to just leave them, 
  is that reddit on the bottom right ? 
  [ uh , what ? 
  unfortunately , this is sometimes true, 
  i bet he taught you everything you know, 
  ( i 'm doing this from memory , and although i tend to replay the games every now and then , it 's been a while ; was i close ? ), 
  i get it !, 
  it 's an apple on an apple on a mac !, 
  i 'm glad the dutch comments are doing so well, 
  this is going to be fairly hard to understand for english speaking people , but it 's a pretty funny skit that 's right on topic :, 
  actually , this will absolutely work, 
  recaptcha generates one word , and includes one word scanned from a book or other printed publication that it does n't know , it then relies on us getting the word right to turn these printed things into digital things, 
  it 's usually fairly easy to tell which word is the generated one , and which is the scanned one , generated ones will always be in the latin alphabet and wo n't have any numbers , punctuation marks or strange characters in it , also it wo n't be upside down, 
  so for that second word there you could have literally put anything ( but not nothing ) and it would have accepted it, 
  both are options , you can click `` transcribe audio '' to get the generated subtitles, 
  the only thing that currently keeps me from doing this is that i always use the shortcuts in the start menu to navigate to my pictures , downloads and documents folders , does anyone know what registry entries i 'd have to change to make them point somewhere other than the default folders ? 
  i could probably google this , but i should be working instead of being on reddit in the first place , and have just barely enough self control to not go off searching for irrelevant things on google, 
  thank you very much , i never knew microsoft had made it this simple,
