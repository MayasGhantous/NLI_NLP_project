  where do you change the language settings ? 
  i 'd like to see if there 's an option for euros , but i ca n't get it to show anything but pounds, 
  i 've got two monitors , which is awesome for multitasking , but when i 'm just focusing on one thing ( watching a video , for example ) it 's not uncommon for the other one to be displaying ( half of ) my desktop, 
  when you 've only got one monitor , you 're right that it tends to be less of an issue , but clutter could still slow down your productivity if you have to search for the lesser used items on your desktop, 
  many people just save things to their desktop if they ca n't think of a better destination , which can lead to a lot of clutter very fast, 
  personally seeing a cluttered desktop irritates me slightly , but as long as it 's not mine i wo n't bother commenting on it, 
  . . probably, 
  you 're not !, 
  judging by that image , i think it 's a page from [ head first design patterns ] ( http://www.amazon.com/first-design-patterns-elisabeth-freeman/dp/0596007124 ) , which really is an excellent book on the subject , it is so easy to read and provides very clear examples for everything, 
  you can just google for it to find a pdf version,

  the artist has begun making a visually impressive ( web ) comic out of this as well : http://www.wormworldsaga.com/, 
  i had n't noticed what subreddit this was in at first , and he was the first guy i noticed, 
  i am desperately trying to remember who pell is, 
  the quickest way to open those packages is to flip them upside down and rip it apart where the ends meet , but only if you want to get them all out at once, 
  source : i have been working at a supermarket for over 6 years, 
  wow , that is uncanny , i am 22 years old and i have been working there since my 16th, 
  to be fair , it 's a fine job for a 16 year old , but pays shit ( as most jobs do at 16 ) , it actually pays pretty decently at 22 and i 'm going to have to pay for college/university some way, 
  magic, 
  this would be a pretty good lock screen or wallpaper for a phone, 
  yeah , iphones only seem to support . m4r files ( which are really just . m4a files ), 
  i 've found the easiest way to create one is using itunes , as you can go into the info of an audio file , enter a start and stop time and convert it to aac , this will then create a new . m4a file which is exactly the part you want , then rename its extension to . m4r and you 've got a ringtone file for iphones , which when added to itunes will automatically appear under a `` tones '' section, 
  keep in mind that iphones only support ringtones of up to 30 seconds ( which is lame ), 
  mostly because lunch is a part of life, 
  they actually recently did this with identical quadruplets, 
  well , i feel silly now, 
  but in an mmo , physics and ai are done on the server , not the game client, 
  well to be fair , a client may do some prediction of collision detecting or general pathing so your character does n't just freeze in place once you lag a bit so it does do some things , but i agree that they 're generally very dumb and do n't do much more than receiving and sending information and drawing the game based on received information, 
  to be fair , i 've never seen a heineken light ( or any kind of light beer ) in the netherlands , it 's just that america ( or whatever country this commercial/product was intended for ) wants it, 
  well , it is just a youtube video , so you could 've linked to the video on youtube directly , [ like so ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwjeei2smiu ), 
  that 's a bit like asking what 's a letter without an alphabet ( note : may not be a very good simile ), 
  bmp is probably the most `` raw '' you could get , it just saves every pixel 's colour value with no tricks at all, 
  cool , i get to be that guy !,

  this conversation starts at 2:24 , but i 'm not going to link to the exact moment because you should just watch the whole 3 minute clip as it 's great, 
  answered in the link in [ this reply to my comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/smo3l/vintage_pooh/c4fbahu ), 
  but to save you the trouble of clicking twice or scrolling up a few comments , [ here 's the video that answers it ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui-qx5r9fnw ), 
  haha , it 's a children 's story and as such not too serious , it 's part of its charm, 
  i just uploaded something ( first time ever ) to test this , and it was checked by default for me, 
  i still had my broken 1st generation ipod lying around , checked the serial number and it was eligible , so i sent it in ( even though i 've opened it up before and it does n't work at all , i do n't even think the battery 's still connected ), 
  i now have a shiny new 6th generation ipod ( that i have no use for ), 
  globes are actually the only thing that can accurately display all the different countries at the right size, 
  ... because it 's just a scaled down version of the earth, 
  well yeah , the earth is n't a sphere but more an oblate spheroid , despite that a sphere comes very close to earth 's actual shape and any distortions would be insignificant when just comparing country sizes, 
  no that does n't appear to be true , player feedback is invaluable to game developers , and arenanet knows that very well and they will take their time to gather and process all our feedback from this weekend, 
  they will then make adjustments to the game based on the feedback ( and their own little tests they ran during the beta ) and push out another beta weekend , and see how the response will be this time, 
  they have said that when the game is ready will be determined by the beta weekends ( paraphrasing here ) , and they will probably repeat this cycle a few times ( i 'd guess 2-3 times at least , but that is a number i just made up ), 
  it 's not just a publicity event or something to generate momentum ( although of course , it does just that as well ), 
  well yes , adjustments may consist of small bugfixes , but if flaws in current systems and features are found , i can see arenanet going in to redesign them ( it would n't be the first time ), 
  the whole point is that it is unlikely that such things will happen as they have reached the last stages of development before release , but even arenanet does n't know if such things will be necessary in advance, 
  also they have said that they want to do one beta weekend event per month , so 2-3 beta events , is 2-3 months, 
  yes , although it does n't seem to work properly ( for example , the box `` mute when in background '' keeps unchecking itself ), 
  also , it loops some music over the login screen, 
  yeah , it was about 3 times as fast for me as well , a bit odd, 
  you could just ask him on twitter, 
  most of it is hidden away in quest text and other texts , it 's not directly mentioned in the storylines, 
  there is the bloodstone ( bloodstone fen ) which is one of the stones containing magic flung from abbadon 's mouth , and there are a few other locations known ( i think , it 's been so long since i read up on my gw lore ), 
  those kind of thought are known as [ intrusive thoughts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intrusive_thoughts ) and are actually very common, 
  i know that i sometimes like to imagine some pretty awful things , like seeing a very small child and wondering just how far i could kick them , i love children and i know very well i would never do such a thing but i 've still had the though , and that 's fine, 
  please do n't feel bad about thoughts like these , lots of people have them and it does n't say anything about you , seeing you say that these thoughts haunt you and that you feel the need to be punished for them is horrible , please do n't think any less of yourself for these thoughts , it seems it 's just human nature, 
  which would still make it a theory ( like gravity ), 
  i 'd never actually thought of that , an explanation is given here , though, 
  such a beautiful picture , such a shitty resolution, 
  yes , but the feature where you hit tab in the address bar to search is made to specifically use a website 's built in search engine, 
  why would you do that ? 
  surely that defeats the purpose of the tab-search , because it would be exactly like a regular search ? 
  i always hear about this , and as an alliance player i feel like i 've missed out on something important, 
  what is ( was ? ), 
  barrens chat ? 
  i definitely agree about the ctrl + rmb , having a modifier and an alternate key does n't make a lot of sense at all , but then i suppose it would 've been possible to rebind the keys for this action ? 
  ( i really did n't go through the menus as much as i should have ), 
  i see , thanks !, 
  again , i definitely agree with you that the modifiers were n't very intuitive and they really should do something about that, 
  for example , how many of you realised that you could draw and ping on the minimap with lmb and pan it with rmb ? 
  probably a lot of you , but then on the world map it becomes lmb for panning ( which is fine , as it 's more likely to be the primary action ) but shift + lmb for drawing and pinging , and i do n't think a lot of people even realised those last two things were options whereas rmb had no function at all on the world map ( i think ? ), 
  i can understand a little bit that dragging ( thus , drawing ) with the rmb is n't very common or intuitive , but i stumbled across the shift + lmb thing after trying rmb ( well , i suppose i came across it kind of intuitively , but i do n't think many others did ), 
  haha , reading it like that makes it seem like it not working all of the time is intended, 
  that is a pretty cool program , i 'm glad i reopened these comments and stumbled across yours, 
  after 10 years of not using one i 've finally started again, 
  it messed up my desk , which i did n't really care about , but this also messed up the tracking from my laser mouse , especially when trying to move it slowly and precisely, 
  i now bought [ this ] ( http://store.razerzone.com/store/razerusa/en_us/pd/productid.169419500 ) , which is pretty great as it 's super thin and sticks to the desk, 
  my thoughts exactly, 
  i quite like your ` right turn on red ' rule , i 'm fairly certain that was an american invention ( think jeremy clarkson credited you with it , i have trust in his knowledge on the matter ), 
  actually , the person who originally said that [ is named steve ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=6xxik6z4exs#t=180s ), 
  it 's okay , they 've got dragonballs and do n't know what to do with them, 
  seriously , they will resurrect the shit out of you, 
  fairly sure he said `` weak god '', 
  the entire audience actually applauded at this ( and laughed , of course ) , i had never witnessed that before at a movie, 
  i just finished with the story again a few hours ago ( mainly due to losing my save game because of gfwl ) , so i 'll actually still be actively playing ac when this comes out , the time difference might actually make sense, 
  i 'm very excited for this, 
  same here , i love feminine hands and fingers , and i definitely have a thing for nice nails, 
  nail-polish though . . it can definitely look good , but half the time it does n't, 
  fake nails ( no matter how good you think they are ) are an incredible turn-off for me, 
  i find it tends to depend on ... 
  i 'm not sure what it depends on , really, 
  black usually looks good , it 's probably my favourite, 
  i am indeed in europe, 
  yes , also i was n't aware of this and since steam says it has steamcloud support for ac , i just assumed my saves were safe and reinstalled windows without backing my ac saves up, 
  first thing i saw was that he 's playing portal 2 , for which he gets an upvote, 
  yeah , you can clearly see some oval portal of some sort on a wall with a giant red laser coming from above ( these were not in the first portal , so i knew it was portal 2 ),
