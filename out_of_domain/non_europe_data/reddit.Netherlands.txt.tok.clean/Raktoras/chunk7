  in that case he would be wielding a portal gun and a lightsaber, 
  i am very cool with that, 
  i think it 's like japanese in the sense that they do subject , object then verb ( i do n't know any japanese , really , but i 've looked into it before ), 
  so they would say `` cat fish eats '' , and not `` cat eats fish '', 
  i do n't know how they mark time , though , maybe that 's similar too, 
  or 12 stone is 76 ( .2 ) kg , which is still approximately the weight of a man, 
  rain is n't the only bad weather , general cloudiness can suck just as hard , or if it 's really warm and very humid, 
  i sure have n't , honestly we dutch people like to complain about our weather a lot but it 's mostly because we think all other places are nicer , i 'm sure it 's not really that bad if you 'd look at the numbers, 
  op may not have been aware there was more, 
  the release information at the end of the video makes it seem as if they will finally have a pc release alongside the console releases , instead of several months later, 
  i 'm having trouble finding an explicit mention of the pc release as i can really only find `` the '' release , is it true we wo n't have to wait this time ? 
  i was surprised the most by this one , especially because i ca n't believe i had n't noticed it, 
  yeah , i 'd love there to be an npc that boosts me up to the appropriate level , if only for the duration of the dungeon because i really want to go in there with my friends , but there 's no way all of us will reach the appropriate level ( perhaps especially for just the duration so i can continue levelling afterwards ), 
  he actually said `` there must be an enormous pressure on this glass '' which is pretty funny as the bear then cracks it, 
  dutchman here , we also have these poopshelves ( although we also have toilets without , it varies ) and i have never closed the lid before flushing and have also never had water shoot out of the bowl , i 'm not sure what 's going wrong when that happens, 
  so it is still totally cool to refer to the dinosaurs from jurassic park as raptors ? 
  ( because they could be utahraptors ? ), 
  til, 
  really ? 
  it 's been a while since i last saw the movie , but i think they were portrayed to be about as tall as a human, 
  no , because they have a low framerate and usually only span a second or less, 
  [ link to video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddmvbvxt9w0#t=162s ), 
  of course , why do you think so much content on the internet is free ? 
  you ca n't blame the rope for that though , ropes do n't hang people , people hang people, 
  i can see why a language might be dangerous , and depending on the developer even a bad choice , but that does n't make the language unsuitable, 
  i never understood why they 're named that , if anything they 're one way windows, 
  seriously it happens way too much , it really is very inconsiderate of the people jumping in front of the damn trains, 
  not only does it cause delays , but it often traumatises the people driving the train as well ( guess it 's not * that * mundane , yet ), 
  while i 'm with you on most of that , he would be able to bite chunks from his arms, 
  the article claims that `` he could not see , hear , taste , smell , or feel . 
  '' , but those are just the five traditional senses and due to [ proprioception ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proprioception ) he should be able to find his own limbs , and perhaps even get enough feedback to know he found them, 
  also if he still had a sense of balance he could probably figure out where a wall was and throw himself at it, 
  but the article is still fake , of course, 
  yeah you 're probably right , i did n't take that part too seriously seeing as they said he was biting himself and throwing himself at the wall, 
  but seeing as i did n't take the article itself serious either , it really is n't worth debating, 
  easily one of my favourite comedians , along with jimmy carr, 
  you can imagine why i really love this show, 
  this looks like a dutch living room , can you confirm this ? 
  i wonder if they ate him , [ apparently they 're delicious ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k-l1hlj9nk ), 
  kut means vagina in dutch , or is a rude term for one, 
  orkut ... would sound weird , i suppose, 
  there we go , i could n't think of cunt , much better translation , although kut is somewhat less harsh than cunt in my experience, 
  yet there you go, 
  now i 'm not a scientist and i do n't work in biology but i can imagine why this would n't work , so hopefully i can answer your question and not get it wrong, 
  the reason why this would be difficult is because the eye is nothing more than a device that can detect a certain spectrum ( visible light ) of electromagnetic radiation , all it can do is tell the brain what wavelength of light is being seen, 
  the brain then has to make sense of the data and form an image out of it , but if the brain has no idea what infrared ( or ultraviolet or anything beyond those two ) looks like it ca n't process it into the image, 
  it 's like you have a box of crayons that are numbered 1 through 10 and i tell you where to colour with what number and you draw the picture that way , in that analogy i am the eye and you are the brain , but if i then tell you that the flower you 're looking at has colour 12 you do n't know what to draw, 
  what wil5on is saying though about the tetrachromacy is that the brain may have more crayons than the eye can see , in which case we could perhaps indeed extend the visible light spectrum by upgrading our eyes, 
  i hope i got this somewhat right , but this makes sense to me, 
  edit : some formatting, 
  edit2 : after reading this article on wikipedia it seems that another problem may lie in the optic nerve , as we 're not certain if it could handle another channel ( anything beyond what we can mix with the current ones ), 
  erectile dysfunction , i think, 
  right , that way you would see more , but not see more colours, 
  any idea what this is from ? 
  i have an extremely similar wallpaper , but i do n't know the source, 
  [ seriously , this is the same building in a different state ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jepy0.jpg ), 
  while i agree with you , the zoom length is a pretty bad example of how they 've put a lot of work into the game :p, 
  like , that should be one of the easiest changes they 've ever made, 
  dude , that 's racist, 
  jurassic park ( the film ) is 19 years old, 
  wait , they have streets of rage on steam ? 
  i did n't even know that game was ever ported to pc, 
  tempted to buy it for some sweet nostalgia , but afraid i 'll just be disappointed as it will never be as good as it was back then, 
  there are lots of controllers available for the pc, 
  honestly , a console is nothing but a computer with a very limiting operating system , there is nothing a console can do that a computer ca n't ( platform exclusive titles such as god of war are really the only reason to get a console ), 
  the `` show enemy names '' option for key bindings ( default left ctrl ) is the button you press to show all enemy names names, 
  well that will show the enemy names at all times , whereas the keybound option just does for however long you hold the bound key down, 
  i would n't be surprised if the bound key actually does the opposite then , namely hiding the enemy names, 
  in gw1 this only covered the major cities that were decorated for the holiday ( it still looked really cool though ), 
  i 'm guessing they 'll do a similar thing with the decorations and snow this time , i ca n't imagine them covering all zones, 
  they do have a much larger team than they did for gw1 , i suppose they could conceivably have a small team cover the lands in snow , whether it 's more trouble to cover it by hand or generate it i do n't know, 
  still , i doubt they 'd do this, 
  look closely , after the guy who was originally on the left ends up on the other guy 's back , he grabs the other guy 's legs and holds on while the other guy jumps backwards, 
  because it 's well choreographed they time it up nicely so the first guy keeps on going and makes a full circle to end up being on the left again, 
  why in the fuck did that first link show up purple ? 
  maybe i accidentally moused over it without realising ? 
  just pissing in the same toilet bowl at the same time and , well , crossing the streams, 
  contact your provider , i think , it 's not something you can do yourself, 
  this is correct , it 's a little too simple to say that 's all they look at as recommendation systems can be pretty complex , but people do n't have to buy them together ( however i 'm sure amazon benefits from keeping track of this and would recommend them sooner if a lot of people bought them together ), 
  that 's what i 'm wondering , i really do n't know what kind of input your os would get from this and how to make use of it, 
  not a miracle , hard work and brilliant minds made this possible, 
  without spoiling the series ? 
  sure . 
  without spoiling the episode and the emotional impact it 'll have ? 
  no , not really, 
  i think it faces your character towards your target if in melee range, 
  is n't that just kalimdor ? 
  that 's odd when you think about it , all the information it contains is still correct after the expiration date and it is just as much proof that i am who i claim to be than a new one would be, 
  the only thing a driver 's license should be good for after its expiration date is identification, 
  i believe it came from the terraria videos , ca n't remember the exact origin but you can be sure it came from some inane argument between tb and jesse, 
  i ca n't speak for the germans , but dutch is partially mutually intelligible with german , so us dutchies can understand most or at least half of what a german speaker is saying in most cases , it 's also very similar in grammar and the words sound alike, 
  i 've heard this only works one way but i do n't know if that 's true, 
  yeah i 've always played portal 2 coop with voice chat , makes it so much more enjoyable, 
  do n't apologise for educating , it 's not like you were being a dick about it, 
  an easy way to remember it is :, 
  = that other one, 
  that 's not what it actually stands for , of course , but knowing it stands for `` id est '' does n't really help you in any way when trying to use it, 
  well the rumours are saying that the next arkham game will be exactly that , a prequel to the first which mostly deals with how batman got to know the joker ( and other criminals , i 'm sure ), 
  at least that 's what i heard a month ago or so , i do n't know how much of this has been confirmed/debunked, 
  i had the exact same problem , took me a while to figure that one out,
