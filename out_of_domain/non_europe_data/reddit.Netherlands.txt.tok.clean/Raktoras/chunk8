  haha , i had totally forgotten it 's a wednesday, 
  thanks , this made my afternoon !, 
  seriously one of the most hilarious parts of the anime, 
  yeah , never got that one, 
  also my jaw is really not that heavy, 
  no , everyone sees it for all characters , but it 's not calculated or synchronised by the server , so on your friends screen your legs might be in a slightly different angle than on your screen, 
  most unimportant visual stuff works like this , like idle animations ( i think ? 
  it depends on the game but usually it 's like that ), 
  more importantly , your level is scaled down to the level of the content , so even as a level 80 , you can have fun playing a level 15 zone and it can even be challenging ( of course you still do better than the actual level 15 player because your gear does n't scale ), 
  combine that with great rewards for zone completion and there 's a lot of content to play that you would have skipped otherwise, 
  apparently the timer keeps its progress even after shutting off, 
  check again , digital sales have just been resumed !, 
  honestly , no, 
  and if you disagree , you can always upgrade ( through the gemstore , so you can choose to spend real money , or play your way to it ), 
  it 's a bug , although you could generally combine any mask and cowl without any clipping issues i doubt that the game has this as a feature, 
  looks sweet , though, 
  jk rowling has actually commented on that , sayign that the characters in the book were actually less good looking than the actors portraying them ( especially hermione , i think , but ron was definitely supposed to be taller and more gangly ) , but since it 's film they ended up like this, 
  not saying they were n't good for the parts , they each portrayed their character very well , but they did n't look exactly the same, 
    ** i remember encoding audio books ** to 8 kbps so they could ( partly ) fit on my 32mb mp3 player back, 
   what were you listening to , audio books ? 
  well yeah , that is what he said in your quote, 
  it 's okay , it provided me with some amusement for a minute or so, 
  sleep makes me feel better once i 'm awake again , plus falling asleep feels nice, 
  i do n't think i 'd feel better after dying , but then again i would n't feel worse , i certainly would n't mind it once i 'm dead but i 'd prefer to live forever, 
  that 's easy , you lick the paper, 
  you need a lot more upvotes, 
  '89 here ( i can say i 'm from the 80s , even if i only lived in them for roughly half a year ) , and i most certainly do n't remember 1990, 
  but it still feels like 10 years ago , how does that work ? 
  yeah over here in the netherlands the pill bottles are mostly opaque white , or they just come in strips, 
  and if you 're not in the uk , watch it [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s95k8ck8di&amp;t=519s ) on youtube !, 
  ( links to the exact part , but the video is the whole xl episode ), 
  it 's actually very well written and i 'm personally not doubting the author 's intellect in the slightest . 
  once i started reading it i could not stop until i had reached the end ( the end being the point the author has gotten to so far , chapter 85 as of right now , i believe at this point the fanfiction is larger than the first book itself ), 
  just check out the first few chapters to make up your mind , i can almost promise you wo n't regret it if you like harry potter and , well , methods of rationality , i guess, 
  while you 're right , america is a bad example, 
  i mean , north america and south america should make up america , however america is usually used to refer to the usa , which is part of north america, 
  gets confusing , and as an annoying european , it always bugs me for some reason that the usa gets to call themselves america, 
  lots of people do n't like it , but it definitely has the best art style and as it was the first one i ever played i like it better as well, 
  simple , no tax reductions or alterations for married people, 
  it was n't serious , but at the same time i do n't really know why married people should get those benefits , what if i 'm really ugly and nobody likes me ? 
  i should n't get the same benefits as married people ? 
  this happens a lot, 
  same here , have had them for as long as i can remember , some fingernails have more spots than others ( my ringfingers , usually ) , but recently they 've largely disappeared on most fingers, 
  my parents used to say it was calcium related , but i doubt it as the amount can vary a lot , but my calcium intake generally does n't, 
  wikipedia mentions low potassium as a possible cause , i honestly do n't keep track of my potassium intake so i would n't know, 
  what ? 
  i 've never seen a 500 euro note in person before , but they 're not really that big are they ? 
  that would never fit in a wallet, 
  i 'm on maguuma myself , not a part of goon , but they 're hard to miss, 
  last week we nearly took everything in wvw ( was nice to get that wvw map completion , just need the red borderlands now ) , but this week we 're losing again , as usual , we do n't do that well in wvw most of the time, 
  i do n't keep up with most communities enough ( other than this subreddit ) to notice hacking claims , but it would pain me to hear that was the cause of our victory last week, 
  what 's wrong with his commas ? 
  i would have probably put them in the same places so this is really making me wonder, 
  well this is reddit , so it 's not too much of a stretch to then also imagine that it 's a pun, 
  seems likely , seeing as i 've had this wallpaper for a few months now, 
  just so people know , it 's the same link , he just told you the title of the video, 
  now go watch it , it 's a great song, 
  i would be very interested in this , i 'd love to one day be a programmer for a company such as arenanet working on a game such as guild wars 2 , and learning about the things they face would be very cool, 
  things like this make me very excited, 
  actually , depending on what time on the 28th the finale starts , it could start in europe as early as 8 am gmt ( that 's midnight pst , anet 's timezone ), 
  that is too funny , this needs to be an animation, 
  that 's not what uncanny valley means, 
  the uncanny valley is when something attempts to look realistic , but something is off and it ends up looking really creepy,

  really ? 
  i guess it is a little subjective , because to me that looks pretty good, 
  then again maybe i 've just gotten too used to computer games, 
  probably bought over here in the netherlands , judging by the label it seems to be at least a few decades old ( it 's fairly worn ), 
  i 'd ask my grandfather , but unfortunately his memory is n't what it used to be, 
  [ i love my dictionary extension for chrome ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yzdci.png ) , i can just double click any word and learn things, 
  edit : [ i really love this extension ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ybuha.png ), 
  yeah , it does, 
  i do n't know , it 's unopened for now, 
  i 'm not a big drinker of scotch or other kinds of whisky , but i 'm learning to appreciate it, 
  thanks for the info !, 
  i think i 'll email them to satisfy my curiosity, 
  even if it 's nothing special , it 's always nice to know what you have, 
  i 've seen this a fair few times in this subreddit , but i 'm not sure what that `` case '' ( for lack of a better word ) over your motherboard is , nor do i ever really see it mentioned in the comments, 
  i assume it comes with the motherboard , because a universal one does n't seem feasible with all the different kinds of motherboard layouts , or perhaps it 's modular and you buy parts ? 
  i guess its purpose is to keep dust off the motherboard , and it looks nice ( although some motherboards already look quite nice ), 
  i 'm just wondering what it is, 
  i have heard this story as well , i assume it 's the case at ops restaurant, 
  it makes me wonder though , how strong are those magnets , or are they throwing their trash at the top of the bins first ? 
  ah , thanks for that, 
  upon closer inspection i can actually see the words `` thermal armor '' impressed in it , so maybe i should 've been able to figure this one out on my own, 
  i do n't really see how it shields the motherboard from heat though , as i 'm sure it itself warms up as well, 
  i second that , it 's original and the result is very good indeed, 
  thank god he did n't do shitty_barbershop, 
  plenty of ama opportunities around here , save it for the next one, 
  people grabbing ice-cream cones by the ice-cream instead of the cone, 
  the first time someone made a youtube video of it , it was very funny seeing the shocked faces of the people behind the drivethrough counter , i can imagine the novelty has worn off by now , especially for the people selling them, 
  to be fair , we get taught english from a very young age ( started at 10 years old for me , i do n't know what it is these days ) and we encounter english every single day ( on tv , movies , video games , these days most notably the internet , probably , although it may be that a lot of dutch people stick to dutch websites ) meaning that it 's easier to immerse ourselves in it and pick things up, 
  i 'd wager you do n't even remember the last time you heard someone speak dutch , and dutch is generally not a language that 's taught outside the netherlands except for belgium and the netherlands antilles , of course, 
  now if you were to flip all those things , maybe we 'd be having this conversation in dutch instead, 
  this makes ordering t-shirts from the internet a tricky business, 
  i know , right ? 
  what 's going on with the kerning there ? 
  they really nailed what , in my head , the average dog sounds like , with him, 
  it 's part of why i 'm such a dog person,
