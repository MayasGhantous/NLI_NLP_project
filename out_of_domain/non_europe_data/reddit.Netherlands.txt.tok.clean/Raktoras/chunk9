  i agree , i find it a highly entertaining show but i do n't watch it to learn science or more complicated facts, 
  they do well with their history and biology and such , though , perhaps language as well ? 
  though they often feature archaic words that really have little to no meaning these days, 
  i do n't have my nexus 7 yet ( stock is very limited here in the netherlands and the 32gb is delayed right now , should be here in a week ) but i 've preemptively subbed to this subreddit and i 'm glad i did , i had heard you ca n't add your own . epub files to the native ebook app , and had been worried there would n't be any good alternatives, 
  that makes sense , but i am quite a stickler for quality, 
  exactly this , for this reason i ca n't really tell whether a guy is attractive or not , and whenever i voice this opinion people tell me i 'm just being homophobic or afraid to admit a guy is attractive , which is simply not the case, 
  i just can not tell in the slightest how attractive someone is , unless they 're on either end of the spectrum, 
  if someone could explain to me how johnny depp is attractive , i 'd appreciate it, 
  oh god do n't even remind me , i have n't smoked a lot of weed , but one of the times i did it was after i 'd been drinking and everything just started spinning so much and i had to throw up , i was n't even that nauseous but the spinning was insane , i felt better afterwards even if the spinning did n't stop, 
  it 's also in europe , though, 
  listening to it myself it seems genuine, 
  also , a 240p youtube video can have an audio bitrate of 96 kbit/s which is n't awful,

  alternating current current, 
  just saying, 
  first spider-man movie by sam raimi , the scene where peter 's uncle dies, 
  the game was a lot harder when i was a little kid , completing it a few years ago it only took me a couple hours, 
  but fuck that waterfall, 
  we 're talking video games here , all waterfalls have entrances behind them, 
  tears in my eyes as expected , i think every dog owner that has had to put theirs down can identify with this on so many levels, 
  coming home afterwards is one of the hardest parts of losing your dog , and not just the first time either . 
  it took me weeks if not months to stop seeing or expecting her every time i walked into the house, 
  i think the joke is that he got a prompt for updates , and in the picture of the game the player is also getting a message about an update, 
  it 's either that or still running xp, 
  it makes for very easy storage since you could stack them and there 's pretty much no wasted space, 
  that does work better in dutch , going to have to remember that one, 
  wait , a polygraph ? 
  how was that used ? 
  was it just to measure your reaction to certain scenarios or was it actually used as a lie detector ? 
  because if it 's the latter that would be ridiculous , there are no accurate lie-detectors as far as i 'm aware, 
  if you 're using chrome you should definitely try [ youtube options for google chrome \u2122 ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-options-for-googl/bdokagampppgbnjfdlkfpphniapiiifn ), 
  allows great customization of the entire page the video is displayed on and also some video settings , such as video size , even nonstandard sizes , such as defaulting to a 720 size ( not quality ) which is obviously nice for monitors that are over 720 in vertical resolution but also the default quality to load videos in , regardless of the size they 're displayed in, 
  yeah that 's what i 'm wondering , using white pixels would n't actually make the screen brighter , would it ? 
  it feels as if it would just make it lighter , which you can then offset by using more of the other colors to make it darker again , i suppose . 
  but that would n't really impact the brightness would it ? 
  really your english is n't bad at all , but if i had to correct your english it would be this :, 
  | i want to estimate how much ** is ** the shipping price . 
  should have been, 
  | i want to estimate how much the shipping price ** is ** . 
  grammatically speaking , at least , but `` shipping cost '' would possibly be even better , or even just `` shipping '', 
  then again , what do i know , i 'm just some dutch guy and might be wrong on those last few points, 
  nothing , he just said that the gif of kramer was * literally * him, 
  oh , well if you have n't looked it up by now it 's one of the main characters from seinfeld , one of the biggest sitcoms ever , and also the guy in the gif, 
  being a good thing or a bad thing does n't necessarily affect things such as evolution and natural selection , though ( i 'm not saying that 's what you meant ), 
  basically if a mutation makes you die sooner , it 's not going to have a large chance of being passed on to the next generation and vice versa, 
  this has just alerted me to the fact that the group that contains all your non-removable storage is called `` hard disk drives '', 
  this is now annoying me endlessly because i have an ssd in there and some virtual drives ( which are physically based on hdds so fair enough , i guess ), 
  thank you so much for that link , . 
  i did try searching stackoverflow , before , but i could n't really find anything, 
  i 'll be reading through it and its various links later on when i 've got some time to really focus on it, 
  does n't work in chrome , i know it stops it in ie , did n't know it would resume instead of refreshing on f5, 
  no idea about other browsers, 
  they just announced it on twitter, 
  i 'm glad i 'm not the only one whose mind immediately went there, 
  pleasantly surprised that worked so well , i 'm not german but i can confirm that 's a good pronunciation, 
  it 's an airship , actually, 
  from [ the wintersday page ] ( https://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/releases/december-2012/ ) : `` this year the city of lion 's arch will host the asuran toymaker tixx as their special wintersday guest of honor . 
  before tixx arrives in lion 's arch in his massive airship toy workshop , he 'll visit every major city in tyria to deliver wintersday toys and holiday cheer . '', 
  ah , i have noticed the creaking every now and then , i assumed it had to do with the screen lift issue, 
  so ... does it even matter ? 
  it certainly is n't visible , and the creaking is minimal . 
  or is this something that will get worse over time ? 
  i quite liked the gargoyles one , when they have their mouths open the inside of their mouths are clearly covered in stone , it 's not strange to wonder how far it extends, 
  probably as far as the light can reach , which would be just inside of their throats , i 'm guessing, 
  it did get silly after that, 
  your mom should come over to the netherlands round this time of year , people walking around like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nictp.jpg ) all over the place, 
  contrary to what the name suggests , this is for windows as well , which is neat i 'll be trying it out, 
  yeah , i do n't know what everyone else in this thread is referencing but that 's what i got out of the picture, 
  source : www.wormworldsaga.com, 
  it 's a comic , and this is just a wallpaper made by the artist out of one of the panels, 
  i can definitely recommend it, 
  which is by the same guy , and made before he started the comic if i remember correctly, 
  concept art , if you will, 
  gravity, 
  to be fair , you can actually email a video to a personal youtube email address to upload them, 
  it 's intended for mobile users , but works as well from a regular computer, 
  i am 23 years old , and i have the same duvet cover , just wanted to share that, 
  actually , not even jesus really has anything to do with christmas ( other than the name ) as christmas predates christianity, 
  not just saturnalia , there are lots of pagan traditions and festivities , and others that were based around the rebirth of the light ( winter solstice ) that were celebrated around what is now christmas that basically contain every single aspect of christmas as we know it , excepting the additions of the story of christ and the name of the holiday, 
  i mean not even the bible states that jesus was born december 25th , and i 'm pretty sure it 's known that he was n't even born in the winter , they just lumped the celebration of jesus 's birth onto the existing holiday and renamed it christmas ( okay , fine , jesus * is * involved with christmas as we know it , but not with the traditions or most of the celebrations ), 
  i guess it sounds like i 'm bashing christmas or christianity 's involvement with it but that 's not really the case , henkie just nitpicked about the difference between st. nicholas and santa claus and i just took something from his post to nitpick about, 
  do note that this is a buy listing , as pears can only be bought with karma and are n't tradeable, 
  however you can only offer as much money as you have , so someone just wants to brag that he has 600g, 
  right ? 
  that never made sense to me, 
  `` i 'll create a new continent ( a very crumbly , rocky one ) and people will have to pay billions and bow down to me to get a piece of it !, 
  and i 'll make it out of kryptonite so superman ca n't stop me !, 
  and i 'll defend myself from the rest of the world with this helicopter , a couple of thugs and a cannibalistic lapdog ! '', 
  that 's awesome , for those of us who do n't have cameras with a manual focus , do you know of a way to trick your camera to be out of focus ? 
  ( you know , on one of those cheap digital cameras ), 
  is the dog housebroken ? 
  if not then whenever they start to do their business just pick them up and take them to the spot where you want them to do it , it 's been too long since we trained our dog so i ca n't remember if you then reward them afterwards ( i do n't believe it 's necessary ) eventually the dog will go to the spot on their own, 
  if the dog is already housebroken , i 'm not sure as i would assume the dog would try to hold it when inside , so it 's harder to teach this behavior, 
  but i 'm no expert , i suggest you look it up, 
  i think i have a camera that focuses when half-pressing the shutter , thanks for the excellent suggestions, 
  i do n't know , i suppose it sounds more precise, 
  you see this with so many products , at a supermarket just pay attention to the tags , sometimes a bottle of water will be labelled as being 500ml , sometimes it will be 0.5 l, 
  it would fix your problem if it stems from windows firewall , however if you 're behind a router it 's likely that the port is n't being forwarded to your computer, 
  you 'd have to fix this by going into your router 's settings and forwarding the port to point to your computer, 
  if you do n't know how to access your router 's settings , simply open a command prompt and type in `` ipconfig '' and hit enter , look for the default gateway and type that ip address into your browser , it 'll often be something like 192.168.0.1 or something,
