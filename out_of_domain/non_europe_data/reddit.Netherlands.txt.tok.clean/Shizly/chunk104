  the driver is going 110km/h , which is probably the speedlimit and is going the same speed as the cars in the left lane . 
  then you 're a little bitch that should n't be on the road . 
  you do n't have to file for permission from other drivers , especially in emergencies . 
  he 's probably going the speedlimit . 
  it says right there that he 's going 110km/h and he 's going as fast as the left lane , are you fucking blind ? 
  believe it or not , you can slow down a car . 
  why should there be boundaries ? 
  we do n't have those in the netherlands . 
  we use voting districts , but that it just an administrative matter to make counting easier . 
  de ene frikandel is de ander niet . 
  eve is created from adam , so it would be pretty weird for them to be a different race . 
  to be fair , just using up/downvotes generally turns out horribly . 
  it 's what creates circle jerks and subs like / r/pics . 
  the up vote button is often used as `` easy to consume '' button . 
  jammer joh , onnodig toeteren is 380 euro . 
  could you add / u/shizly ? 
  are you guys also considering getting extra manpower ? 
  for every 22.000 + users , there is 1 mod . 
  do n't you guys think that after such a steady and long going growth it 's time to have a bigger team ? 
  maybe that would help the quality of / r/f1 more then any rule that could be implanted . 
  what ? 
  it is nothing like that . 
  a driver breaking his leg is like a sprinter breaking his leg . 
  a car break down is like a sprinter which pants came down and let him trip . 
  kan best . 
  you 're forgetting that the bbc is global . 
  amazon is not . 
  na , it 's mostly / r/topgear being so pro-topgear ( obviously ) and pro-clarkson . 
  no , it does n't look like that at all . 
  so it 's not viewable in roughly 95 % of the world . 
  and no one cares about shipping . 
  there wo n't be hundreds of millions of people ordering the dvd from a , to them , foreign website . 
  it needs to be broadcasted on television to even get close to the 350m figure . 
  how are you going to control the bike and hold a handrail at the same time ? 
  no , you did n't wrote that at all . 
  you said that the difference is government/not-government while roland said it was western c/eastern c. 
  bbc is global . 
  as long as amazon is not even close to have the same coverage the 350m number is completely useless . 
  why do n't you agree with 5x5 ? 
  if every subscriber would get to sit in it for 10 minutes ( incl entering and exiting the car ) it would take 1 year and 8 months to let everyone have a turn . 
  we can do this !, 
  edit :, 
  welp , that does n't look as expected . 
  it 's really shitty to let a small non-profit waste its time and resources with that crap . 
   alle defaults, 
  no , it 's 4 years . 
  and even 6 years is n't that long to go from rough idea to film . 
  what 's the source ? 
  when was it established it was on the top floor ? 
  we like to look outside and get sunlight inside ? 
  i do n't know what differences they have . 
  and with wet tires on a dry track you have grip for roughly 2-3 laps . 
  net als `` safety '' en `` security '' . 
  obama is n't actually black , he 's brown . 
  yet we call him black . 
  the joke ( i think ) is that in kenya this would be the opposite . 
  how does it sounds lame ? 
  you already have something in common that you both like . 
  je komt [ hier ] ( https://www.google.nl/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ccaqfjaaahukewjw8ihgyv3hahvmjswkhx6vaba&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bol.com%2fnl%2fp%2fwapen-paraplu-geweer-117-cm%2f9200000025443235%2f&amp;usg=afqjcnepdbvfs2z29zqnslsyy5jwokr4uw&amp;sig2=aprrg69r_r-b_hbtvshomg ) op uit . 
  not to late to make / r/angers and let the css make a redirect to / r/rangers . 
  just make 1 post in it that links to / r/rangers for the mobile users . 
  that would be crazy expensive . 
  and helicopters are useless when in the air , you ca n't just land wherever you like in the middle of the city . 
  it would take a lot longer . 
  they use them in the netherlands during big events and for emergency transport for donororgans and blood . 
  i do n't see the difference between this and motorcycle cops . 
  details . 
  wat is dat ? 
  edit :, 
  this is at most half right . 
  they had border conflicts for years and poland took advantage of the nazi advance to take the regions that were disputed . 
  and this happened when the czech accepted the ultimatum . 
  poland gained roughly 800km ( roughly 30x30km ) . 
  and not a single shot was fired . 
  you make it sound like poland went in slaughtering thousands of czech hand in hand with the nazi 's . 
  no , he said `` should 've known better '' . 
  it 's his fault . 
  yes , they would have been . 
  it literally would have . 
  i heard a rumour that points decide your position in the championship . 
  he was in that spot for almost 2 laps and did n't make any attempt to pass the line . 
  tr has 75 % of their current points thanks to him . 
  who 's feeding who ? 
  what has that to do with maturity ? 
  it happened often enough that drivers ignore team orders . 
  already forgot multi 21 ? 
  if there was an agreement , i agree with you . 
  but i do n't see any proof of that , only a couple rumours here . 
  i did n't see them swapping places before and if that happened during a pit or sc i do n't see why it took so long before places were swapped back . 
  it used to be that you have to pass the leader and catch the end of the pack . 
  to speed things up that was changed ( iirc this year ) and now creating a big gap is good enough . 
  when verstappen passed the sc the sc went inside when verstappen created a gap of half a lap . 
  seems like we read a different race thread . 
  especially when you look at the post-race thread . 
  you mean that thing of which the judge found him not guilty ? 
  is ook schandalig . 
  why would you hate massa ? 
  not even that . 
  just tap with 2 fingers on the post or comment . 
  this is so exiting,
