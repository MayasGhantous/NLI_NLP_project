  thanks for confirming . 
  that is completely unreasonable and a complete overreaction . 
  via trouw :, 
  that 's it !, 
  thank you . 
  as herbert said , it was `` maple leaf against the axis '' . 
  still thanks for your help/suggestion , it seems like a good addition . 
  whahahahaha !!, 
   supporters van pim fortuyn, 
  en in welke context was dat ? 
  en water is nat . 
  yes , it will be no issue . 
  there are a lot of dutch websites that ship cheese international , some of them in english . 
  do know that shipping costs are really , really high . 
  [ goudacheeseshop ] ( http://www.goudacheeseshop.com/ ) en [kaasuitholland.com ] ( http://www.kaasuitholland.com/epages/09020213.sf/en_us/?viewobjectpath=%2fshops%2f09020213 ) both have an english version . 
  true , but the [ us ambassy ] ( http://thehague.usembassy.gov/faqs/u/amerikaanse-douanevragen.html#etenswaren ) notes that most dutch cheeses are n't . 
  reddit likes to think that nestle wants to make drink water really expensive by letting the sources be run by a private company . 
  in reality the ceo spoke out against water waist and said something along the lines that when you use more then x , you should start paying more per litre . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  i 'm fully aware of that scandal that happened more then 40 years ago and called international outrage which resulted in much stricter rules on baby formula . 
  they would be really useful on a loose underground . 
  for vertical jumps there is the vertical jump bible . 
  link ( pdf warning ) :, 
  it 's almost 150 pages on training to jump . 
  i have n't used it , but there have been multiple posts with height achievements were people recommended it .

  yes , it does . 
  he was n't dnf , so he did finish . 
  yes , i 'm wrong . 
  it is impossible to create jokes yourself . 
  how insightful of you !, 
  you thinking a joke is n't fun does n't make it less a joke . 
  it also has absolutely nothing to do with the discussion , but nice try . 
  well , you got me there !, 
  what a quality comment you made there . 
  your parents would be proud if they did n't leave you at birth . 
  wtf !, 
  hou het op een `` heat of the moment '' . 
  bestaat dat nog , analoge tv ? 
  yeah , how dears he to shorten wait time for everyone by doing something that 's completely legal in virtually every country !,

  if you want looks , go for a program that focuses more on that .

  in case you 're serious : there are 2 pilots . 
  both seats are able to fly/navigate and do comms/guns .

  could i train my abs 6 days/week ? 
  i mean , i obviously can . 
  but would it give me enough rest ? 
  i remember reading here that abs do n't need that big of a rest period . 
  i want to do ( side ) plank/abs wheel on running days and do leg raises on gym days . 
  thanks for the advice . 
  then i 'll probably keep it to day on/day off . 
  is n't this what they do n't want ? 
  i do n't now about the us , but the membership turnover rate here at gyms is huge . 
  around 30-40 % of the members only stay with their gym for 1 year before they quit . 
  please come and incorporate fitness in your life , do n't make it a 1 year thing !, 
  if you do n't come for 18-25 days you 're likely to get a call if there 's maybe something wrong they can help you with . 
  not familiar with netflix offline , but could n't you just call them ? 
  seems to be a right hand drive . 
  bronnen : business insider , cfr isis backgrounder,

  nu komen we er niet in ! '' ? 
  plus ze speelde in the expendables 3 .

  the washington post did a great 5 part article about the daily life under is rule . 
  talking about things from education to taxation to what food is available to who picks up the garbage bins :, 
  the leader of the team also did a great interview about this in a recent war college podcast :, 
   please prove me wrong, 
  how the fuck do you even proof that ? 
  that you do n't know how to make shakes does n't mean that 2 shakes wo n't be 1300kcal . 
  or 650/shake . 
  op said 2 servings . 
  he did n't say that only obese people have bad ankles . 
  do n't try to be a victim . 
  @nujij comment, 
  so giving the police more time to get to you . 
  and the other 399 will flee as fast as they can . 
  no , it means that the intelligence agencies of belgium have reasons to assume a large attack is on hands and they want to prevent it . 
  governing a country is n't really the same thing as hosting a tv show . 
  and what makes you believe that he has 3 months off ? 
  it wo n't make that much of a difference . 
  or that russia keeps violating their airspace while being warned multiple times and while they showed they were willing to shoot down drones . 
  not according to turkey . 
  and historically speaking , turkey is right . 
  russia has flown over turkey numerous times in the last couple of months , while being warned by turkey to not do that . 
  and russia has a name for flying over european airspace with their bombers for no reason . 
  just as they had evidence that mh17 was shot down by an ukrainian fighter jet ? 
  not that familiar with the universe , but is n't already in the first thor established that they ai n't family ? 
  people keep repeating that , but is there any source for that ? 
  it seems to be a silly excuse .

  just have 1 look at assen . 
  mailen .
