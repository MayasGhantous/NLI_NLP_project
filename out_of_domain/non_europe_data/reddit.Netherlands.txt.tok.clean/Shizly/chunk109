  look at the pabo studies and jobs for opposite examples . 
  you do n't think that there can be something in front of the motorcycle ? 
  he is n't driving on an infinite road that 's closed to all other traffic .

  what a time to be alive !, 
  tot januari is de code krtdcafn . 
  en via facebook kan je de video wel delen , maar via youtube dan weer niet . 
  `` learning everything there is to know '' is n't the same as `` use your brain for 5 seconds '' . 
  why did you guys choose snowboarding over skiing ? 
  i 've skied a couple hours ( ca n't even call me a `` beginner '' yet ) and i 'm thinking about doing it more often . 
  however , i 'm not sure if i should start with skiing or snowboarding . 
  i 'm planning on doing an introduction lesson to snowboarding to see what i think of it . 
  but until then , what made you make this decision ? 
  edit :, 
  thanks for the many responses guys !, 
  yes , just let someone break your fucking jaw !, 
  not like it matters , there are 4 guys that go after that :d, 
  being with 5 guys does n't make it impossible ( or even less likely ) for someone to punch your jaw around . 
  they had to restrain him , so they did in the safest way possible . 
  alright , i 'm convinced . 
  he was being a threat to them and handled it before it got out of hand . 
  this is a new account ( only 12h old now ) . 
  last time the op asked it for someone else , maybe this is `` someone else '' . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.flabber.nl/artikel/zo-ligt-het-verkeerspark-assen-er-nu-bij-drone-filmt-verlaten-en-vervallen-themapark-46722 ) a back story ( dutch ) to the park with pictures of the park in use . 
  no , it is n't . 
  you do n't wait until someone is standing in your face . 
  at least half of that is just plain wrong or not exclusively his policy . 
  no , you do n't . 
  that idea is just plain retarded . 
  `` better get punched in the face before i do something ! '', 
  great idea pal . 
  i 'm glad for your own sake that you ai n't a cop . 
  they also wear a parachute to land . 
   i was downvoted in this sub a while back for talking about how people who free climb or wing suit fly ( basically adrenaline junkies ) are more likely to die, 
  doubt it . 
  that you were downvoted for saying that doing things like wingsuit diving make you more likely to die . 
  when was that ever the case ? 
  like everywhere else ? 
  that story is completely different than the actual story in the book . 
  so far no one has been able to point to an actual source for it . 
  dat is niet nederlands . 
  which is a stupid thing . 
  not being raised by anyone also would n't show your true personality . 
  no , it is n't . 
  it 's like saying that throwing a baby in a jail for 18 years in water and bread and shows who goes out his true self . 
  it does n't . 
  his only change if an officer function , which you need hbo/wo schooling for . 
  do n't know how it used to be , but nowadays the maximum age for an officer job is 28 years and 11 months . 
  airforce pilot jobs are still 26 . 
  want ? 
  x-post from an older / r/thenederlands post ( [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/257thh/vintage_veiligheidsposters/ ) ), 
  posters are in the 1920-1970s range , with most being from 1925-1945 . 
  the captions provide a translation of the posters . 
  of besloot je express de rest van m 'n comment te negeren ? 
  it 's just a small joke . 
  it 's used for socialising . 
  seems to me that you 're a bit overreacting . 
  `` uitkering '' is n't . 
  that exclusively means financial welfare .

  highly doubt that . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  sounds like crap . 
  the `` chute not opening '' is only 1 of the few accidents that can happen . 
  so it 's a higher risk then simply driving . 
  of course , driving a million miles gives a higher change of having accident . 
  skydiving a 1000 times is also more dangerously then driving for a block once . 
  spoiler : you 're not the only skydiver in the world . 
  even if you were , that does n't mean you would know that . 
  and i did n't downvotes you , but how nice of you to think that you 're so important that i would downvote you . 
  thanks dipshit . 
  glad your mother did n't abort you . 
  jk , i ( and she ) wish she did . 
  that way you can everything seem safe . 
  if double as many people died skydiving you could just say `` 2 years '' instead of 1 . 
  there you have a point . 
  someone , give this guy a passport !, 
  even then it is wrong , the arrows are correct from this perspective . 
  since roughly 9 months or so .

  well , it 's downvoted to the depths of broki 's home .

  edit :, 
  i 've got a british style blazor/suit . 
  now the vents are stitched with 1 line . 
  to be clear , i 'm supposed to cut the stitches so that the vent is free to move , right ? 
  thank you !, 
  they make some big claims without any actual sources . 
  and as they themself stated , the janitor did interact with other people . 
  where do you camp ? 
  i 've never paid more then 10/15 euro in germany and france . 
  happy new year from london !,

  en het is complex .
