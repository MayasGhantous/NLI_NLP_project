  but tpb is still blocked !, 
  torrents give you to option to upload what you download . 
  it 's the etiquette that you do and it 's normally turned on , but it is n't impossible to download a torrent without uploading . 
  and that 's what breins lawyers tried to let the judge believe . 
  where 's that from ? 
  thank you, 
  i 'm sorry i disappointed you . 
  it will not make it happen again . 
  it depends on what activity you did that day , what you are expecting to do tomorrow , how long you 're awake , what you eat , etc. 
  there is not something like `` you need xhym sleep '' . 
  on a normal day you will need around 8 hours of sleep , but an other day you maybe only need 6 or maybe need 10 . 
  i do n't really have had a traumatic experience . 
  but my mom did . 
  when she was 13/14 years old her father was in a serious depression . 
  then one day she came home and saw her father jump of the balcony . 
  she run after him , but he had hit the ground before she even reached the balcony . 
  he died on impact . 
  the thing she remember the most is that everybody in the apartments was just watching how his dead body was lying there on the ground . 
  and afterwards , she had do clean the blot out of his clothes . 
  that 's a badass cape you have !, 
  he \u00b4 s a hero . 
  he sacrificed his life so that others maybe would get a change at a better life . 
  he was prepare to dye to help other people , even though there was a huge change nothing would happen . 
  and he would never see the outcomes of his actions . 
  he didn \u00b4 t offerd his opinion . 
  he stated `` facts '' . 
   in oslo for example , you are 3 times more likely to be victim of a violent crime than nyc . 
  not true and not a opinion . 
   rapes and child molestation is sickening common and their still a culture their that the victim ` wanted it ' . 
  not true and not an opinion . 
   you could be born in norway but if even one of your parents are not native norwegian you will always be considered a foreigner, 
  so like how almost whole europe is ? 
   even if you are 100 % norwegian and you move to another town or village you and your kids will always be seen as an outsiders, 
  not true . 
  it could it 's a opinion , but it 's stated as a fact . 
  conclusion : snowburger is just a troll , or a horrible close minded person with even worse prejudices . 
  when did i say that ? 
  i said that bouazizi is a hero because he sacrificed himself so that other people maybe would get a better life . 
  why using quotation marks when you 're not quoting me ? 
  no , they 're not . 
  you where saying :, 
   `` it never accomplishes anything . '', 
  and, 
   `` he 's dead and he could n't enjoy the outcomes of his actions, 
  idiot . '', 
  the first is clearly wrong , and bouazizi is a example on that matter where it did accomplish something . 
  when bouazizi example was brought up , you stated that he was an idiot and that he could n't enjoy the outcome . 
  and that 's where a commented that he was a hero , because he gave his life so that others maybe could get a better life . 
  even though he would die , he choice to sacrifice himself . 
  nobody said that setting yourself on fire is a good thing . 
  they are saying that disrespectful statements on this mater like, 
   `` so win win ? 
  he dies , we get to see someone on fire . '', 
   `` the guys is so dumb that the world is better off if he dies . '', 
  are not accepted and that your reasoning does n't add up . 
  what has that to do with anything ? 
  and you 're comparisation does n't match . 
  you should say :, 
  `` single mothers : shut up bitch you aint special . '', 
  `` single fathers : shut up bitch you aint special . '', 
  now you are just comparing two different statements . 
  and both of them are even wrong . 
  why would there be a law about this ? 
  or am i missing a figure of speech ? 
  i think it 's worth the experiment . 
  i think that the dear esther developers would qualify for trying out to do an ama on tg . 
  if it turns out to not be a success , than you know that it tg proparly is n't the right place . 
  if it turns out to be a succes , you could make a rule or something that you need permission from a mod to start a iama . 
  motherlode - sims 2/3, 
  and the `` lose your stars '' - cheat in gta : sa . 
  i 'm unable to recall it exactly , but every time i pick up the game i 'm still able to do it . 
  it 's an assassins creed ii spoiler . 
  they do n't need to run a server . 
  they need the emulate the server . 
  that 's not the same thing . 
  the `` only '' thing the release groups need to do , is add the server functionality to the actual game that gets released .

  / r/explainlikeimfive, 
  was there when the subreddit started . 
  but after a couple months , it turned into a / r/answers and people did n't used the eli5 concept . 
  now it 's just for lazy people that do n't bother to go to / r/askscience , / r/answers , / r/askhistorians . 
  edit : [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s8l4e/meta_i_think_people_are_forgetting_what/ ) to [ meta ] post about it . 
  / r/explainlikeimfive, 
  it turned into a mutated child of / r/askscience , / r/politics , / r/askhistorians and / r/answers . 
  and there is a complete lack of eli5 answers . 
  a couple days after [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s8l4e/meta_i_think_people_are_forgetting_what/ ) meta post is decided to unsubscribe . 
  i 've done almost everything you could do in the game , even almost all the yellow signs and the burnout boards . 
  but my psn + expired and i had to buy the game . 
  decided to buy the game physically , since it had all the addons . 
  it turned out that the save game from the psn version could n't interact with the physical game and that i had to replay the entire game . 
  and not a single tear was given that day , i absolute loved replaying the game . 
  you care enough to think you are a horrible person and should die . 
  so i do n't think you truly hate yourself . 
  i think you lack a hobby to take your minds of things . 
  when you are busy with something that 's truly yours ( that could range from making music to brewing beer and from gaming to running ) you just do n't have to time care about other people that much . 
  you stated that you are insecure , however : other people think your confident . 
  that sounds to me that you are not really insecure , but more like that you know you can do so much more . 
  work on that . 
  get a binding with the world , read a newspaper , get a hobby , work not only on your shortcomings but also on your qualities .
