   how do you think it is justifiable to have people in places of power within the european union , whom never have been chosen by the european people ? 
  which places are you talking about ? 
  but we see cops drinking beer . 
   pushing the stig as a central marketing focus for the new series, 
  where are they doing that again ? 
  the daily show also has a lot of correspondants . 
  now happy ? 
  is 20 euro de man , ben je er al. 
  and it 's just stupid . 
  if you have extra salt on 99 % of your meals , why not add it straight away ? 
  what if the meal normally is saltless , but you enjoy it with salt on it ? 
  i 've a hard time believing this . 
  sister wives in de polder ? 
  there is a double train track going into zandvoort as a train station . 
  they could use that to place parking spaces a lot further away . 
  or even do n't come with the car at all , but use public transport . 
  nowadays it 's always on every km marker that marks a full kilometre . 
  yes , this exists and does work . 
  there 's even a type of physical therapist that specialises in this muscle group . 
  i had hearing problems that were caused by one side of my jaw being much stronger then the other side . 
  that caused by eustachian tube to irritate . 
  ca n't really remember how all the exercises went but one of them was forcing my mouth closed with my fist under my chin and slowly opening my mouth will doing so in a straight line . 
  also the same exercise but while pushing on some spot behind my ears instead of pushing my chin . 
  however , these are pt exercises to help you with medical issues . 
  they are not exercises to make your face look different . 
  hoho , dat is frans !, 
  would n't call it ugly , but i ai n't a fan of the matte look . 
  the netherlands , & lt ; 25 y.o and 2 years damage free ( so since i started biking ) , gs500 from 2002 . 
  i pay 170 euro 's a year for liability , storm/fire damage , gear and theft . 
  it 's almost 7000 kilometres . 
  only estimated time i found was almost 1 year . 
  as a survival game which lets you wander alone , but is single player , i would recommend the long dark . 
  you play a character that is alone in the wilderness , after civilization has ended . 
  not because zombies or aliens or something , it just did . 
  from wikipedia :, 
   the long dark is a first-person open world survival simulation video game in development by canadian company hinterland for multiple platforms . 
  the player assumes the role of a crash-landed bush pilot who must survive the frigid canadian wilderness after a global disaster . 
  until now it 's a plotless sandbox game , but in spring the first part of the season 1 story will be released .

   death discovers their plans , but is unable to act directly because he can not see - and interact with - time ( the anthropomorphic personification ) . 
  instead , death sends his granddaughter susan to stop them , assisted ( apparently ) by the death of rats and quoth the raven .

  it was my gateway into hard rock/metal music 8-10 years ago when i was in high school . 
  i first heard of in flames , trivium , shinedown , soilwork , korn and many more bands thanks to them . 
  for people i was influenced by a friend who really is into 80 's music . 
  she got me in all those band you know because everyone knows them and they 're legendary , but never really listen to . 
  that was how it was for me at least . 
  when you 're bulking , you 're adding body mass in fat ( unless you 're lean bulking and doing it very carefully ) . 
  this fat will move somewhere in your body . 
  visible abs require a low fat % , which is exactly the opposite of what you 're doing . 
  the anti-spam system will cut it in 1/10th of that easily . 
  the obama ama also had over 40k points , but sits now at 8k or something like that . 
  it even is n't at the top of the week right now .

  do you have a source for that one ? 
  being a vegetarian does n't make this comic more confusing in any way . 
  yes , it 's free . 
  how did you get the idea that it is n't ? 
  no one was talking about the licensing behind it . 
  you 're not paying for the software , so it 's free software .

   i think berlin qualifies as `` cold climate '', 
  it really does n't . 
  just bought the sennheiser m2 iem , and i 'm a bit disappointed . 
  let me start of by saying that there is an very audible humming noise and that i 'm returning them under warranty . 
  the humming happens on different phones , different pc 's , different audio installations and in different powergrids . 
  my problem is that it sounds perfect ( minus the humming ) , as long as i sit perfectly still . 
  when i move the slightest , the cable noise will be louder then the music i 'm listening to . 
  could anyone else with the m2 iems shine some light on this ? 
  i almost do n't see any reviewers mentioning this issue , but i found a couple of the customer reviewers describe it as the worst cable noise they 've ever experienced . 
  say that the issues do n't get resolved , then i 'm looking for an alternative . 
  * budget - ~ $ 60 - ~ $ 110, 
  * source - mostly iphone, 
  * requirements for isolation - none to low . 
  * will you be using these headphones in public ? 
  - yes , the majority of the time . 
  * preferred type of headphone - iem, 
  * preferred tonal balance - not sure , i 'm not that experienced with different tonal balances and do n't really now what i like the most . 
  from feeling i say that i like a more bassy balance . 
  * past headphones - sennheiser cx400 , sennheiser mm 70s , ( sennheiser m2 iem ), 
  * preferred music - ( hard ) rock , metal ( core ), 
  * location - the netherlands . 
  an other must have is a remote that allows me to skip tracks or pause .
