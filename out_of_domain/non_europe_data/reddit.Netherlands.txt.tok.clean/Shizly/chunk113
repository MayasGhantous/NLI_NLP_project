  when playing one of the songs of the top of the list , it will only play songs i 've recently saved . 
  when i start with a song somewhere halfway , it plays mostly songs that i 've saved around that time . 
  it 's 10k per playlist . 
  `` songs '' under `` your music '' counts as a playlist , so yes . 
  read the sidebar on / r/headphones and if you can be more precise and have done some research , just ask in the daily buying thread . 
  i do n't know . 
  you can press ctrl + a to select your entire music library and create a playlist from it . 
  that would work . 
  i 've playlists the same way [ this guy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/4em8ww/how_do_you_use_spotify/ ) has . 
  when i listen i mostly listen to entire albums or multiple songs of the same artist , but i use playlist when i feel like it . 
  no , he 's asking for examples of surviving a crash like the op describes . 
  which is n't in a planebody . 
  that 's a load of crap . 
  you remember the great ones and you forget about the garbage . 
  or `` an accident '' . 
  it 's almost like different people are saying different things !, 
  exept that it was an accident . 
  the driver of the car was his wife .

  haha , wow . 
  i 'm not a big consumer , but i think that using a 7l would make my buddies pretty unhappy . 
  thanks for the advise . 
  i 'll keep them around for if i decide to try sidemount diving . 
  en wat is je bron ? 
   bij popcorn time stream je films en series . 
  is dat net zo illegaal als downloaden ? 
  seems pretty clear to me . 
  where do you see them do that ? 
  and it 's entirely possible that this happened thanks to some form of phishing , which means that they did n't got leaked . 
  is dit de rij ?

  could n't you just do it at a truckrest ?

  like this : https://youtu.be/lq-54gox6-k, 
  you can copy-paste track urls to word , so you would n't have to start over completely . 
  just copy-paste them back from there to a playlist . 
  and you can use [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/2phwhb/found_an_actual_solution_to_deactivating_facebook/ ) method to use spotify when you close your facebook account . 
  he said 50 hours , not 150 hours . 
  180 hours in a week , 154 when subtracting the activities he mentioned . 
  minus 40 hours of work and 50 hours of sleep , it still leaves you with 64 hours a week . 
  no , you call them and ask for advice . 
  then do what they tell you to do . 
  the out-of-office-hours posts are located in hospitals , you ca n't just show up . 
  no problem . 
  he said using a shot in which rosberg was already going to the right to block hamilton . 
  this was n't the start situation . 
  we had that a couple years ago , but it worked horrible . 
  and we did have problems , so it got removed . 
  because it 's not the job of this sub to make sure you do n't see a spoiler . 
  no , the point is that someone actually notices you . 
  just hearing some random noise is something different . 
  a horn universally mean `` watch out ! '' . 
  which is the message you want to give . 
  there 's a double train track , which gives plenty of possibilities . 
  place the parking areas way out of zandvoort and let trains and busses peddle the visitors . 
  what makes you think that formula 1 is n't that big ? 
  and compared to what ? 
  rock am ring blokkenschema is bekend geworden , en wat is die ballen . 
   still i have to hear good arguments for the need of a zandvoort track . 
  the same reasons we hold any sport event . 
  it 's fun and good for the local economy . 
  you 're telling me halve a story mate . 
  what happened afterwards ? 
   red bull are , objectively , the third team in terms of space . 
  on some circuits with a larger emphasis on raw engine power , they might even be the 4th team . 
  realistically , they battle for 5th or 6th . 
  it really is n't . 
  why would you want 2 world wars ? 
  then why would n't you want another one ? 
  if that 's the thing that matters the most . 
  he just sees through your bullshit . 
  you ca n't travel in europe for 10 euro 's a day for six months . 
   * rock am ring, 
  * the offspring, 
  my belgian and german gp tickets also say the same thing . 
  i believe that connecting your account is n't possible with dutch banks . 
  afas used a way around this by giving you the option to automatically download the transaction lines when you logged in to the ing website , but that loophole got closed a while ago . 
   iii . 
  brigading door wie dan ? 
  am in the eu , i 've maybe seen one phone with that . 
  if you have empty slots left , i would also be interested . 
  i 'm from the netherlands , so we should check if it works or not .

  you need to be in the same country .

  yes , that 's the case . 
  create a new playlist , select all songs in your discover weekly , paste them to the new playlist ? 
  could n't adding a song to a personal playlist also been seen as saving that song ? 
  that would make the most sense to me . 
  what do you want us to do about it ? 
  rock am ring !,
