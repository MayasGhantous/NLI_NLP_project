  i would be surprised if it were that many people more . 
  in my experience , it is n't . 
  most distinguishable pok\u00e9mon i catch ( ergo , not ratata 's or pigeys ) are just in a random place in the nearby screen . 
  then they are n't region exclusive . 
  they are just more common in one place then the other . 
  first the general advice seemed to be level 10 and now 20 . 
  as more and more people are going 20 + , this will only increase . 
  i 'd say it depend on how much you want to play . 
  1-15 takes as long as 15-20 . 
  things can get boring then , especially now tracking is bugged . 
  i stopped actually hoarding dust at level 15 , but i 'm still using it sparsely . 
  alright , then we 're talking about the same . 
  the debunked theory is dat pok\u00e9mon only appear in certain regions exclusively . 
  it was said that kangaskhan only appeared in australia . 
  there are a lot of high quality posts on this sub . 
  could n't we put some of those in the faq ? 
  and update the faq , since it still uses outdated beta info . 
  lapras 351 73 400 false no combinations found, 
  an other thing i noted :, 
  poliwhirl 332 56 1000 false 22 combinations 26 % to 86 %, 
  i do n't know the exact works behind your sheet , but this seems like a really big range . 
  when looking at the found combinations , it both found level 9 and level 10 combinations roughly equally . . 
  same goes for :, 
  raticate 336 47 1000 false 24 combinations 6 % to 64 %, 
  23 of the combinations are now level 9 , 1 is level 10 . 
  you 're right . 
  my mistake . 
  is there somewhere a post with more information about this or a link to an usable map ? 
  i do n't blame you !, 
  [ link ] ( https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/07/14/rock-is-wit-en-rap-is-zwart-welnee-3232936-a1511536 ), 
  nothing happens when i press a pok\u00e9mon that 's on the `` sightings '' list . 
  no selection , no message , nothing . 
  anyone else has this ? 
  so even with the new update , not everyone get this feature ? 
  how is [ this ] ( https://www.ingress.com/intel?ll=52.115206,4.588634&amp;z=15&amp;pll=52.115981,4.585911 ) portal possible ? 
  one agent installed 4 mods and 4 lv8 resonators . 
  i 'm still pretty new to the game and the only thing i 've read is that a agent can only add 1 lv8 resonator on a portal . 
  go to the key in your inventory and press `` recharge '' in the left bottom corner . 
  alternatively you click on the image of the portal that shows up when you select the key and `` portalview at distance '' will open . 
  alright , thank you . 
  did n't know that when a portal was flipped all the mods and resonators stayed at the same levels . 
  google image search shows [ this ] ( https://plus.google.com/+%e9%bb%84%e5%8d%8e%e9%9f%b5/posts/v7cibj8bwpw ) as source . 
  to give some perspective as someone who only started to play this week , i got to level 6 in about 4 nights of playing . 
  1 of those nights was a friend of my explaining how this game works and only 1 of those nights i went to the city that 's a couple miles away ( live in a small village ) . 
  for me the best way to learn how to play was that friend explaining how it worked and [ this ] ( http://ingressbootcamp.com/ ) guide for some background . 
  you could ask in the team comm if someone is willing to help you out a bit . 
  it should n't take more then 1 hour . 
  i learned it on a terrace within range of 3 portals and with a beer  . 
  on the nights i played a bit , i 've played a couple hours with some people that offered to help me a bit without me even asking them . 
  ( though those guys were really happy that someone else from the village started playing ), 
  there 's probably also a local google hangout that you can join . 
  again , ask in the team comm . 
  depending on your team , it 's possible the first thing they tell you about . 
  no , he died . 
  this picture is posted on reddit pretty frequently with a backstory . 
  it should be in one of the other posts . 
  apart from the fact you chose the wrong faction to begin with ( haha ) , you should n't . 
  ask in the comms or in the hangouts to team up with someone . 
  a friend of my became l8 yesterday after an other player helped trough flipping portals and stuff like that . 
  the other player also had better insight in what were good links and what were not . 
  how does damaging a portal actually work with damage done ? 
  a l8 burster does max 2.7 k damage according to [ wikia ] ( http://ingress.wikia.com/wiki/xmp_burster ) . 
  however , when i try it on a field with 1 l8 agent in [ ipas ] ( http://ipas.graphracer.com/ ) , it shows 7k damage done on the field . 
  does this mean that a l8 burster ( or any burster ofcourse ) can do 2.7 k damage per resonator instead of only 2.7 k max damage on an entire field ? 
  so it would give the resonator i 'm on a max damage of 2.7 k and those further away would get reduced damage , based on distance ? 
  and i heard that before about ultrastrikes , but the max xm damage is the same . 
  does n't attacking with a burster on the center of the portal achieve the exact same , if the max xm damage is the same ? 
  i do that on trips of more then a week or when i visit many cities . 
  i like to read back what i did . 
  writing it down makes remembering the details much more easier . 
  and when someone asks for things to do in a city i went , i can easily tell them what i 've done and recommend . 
  heb deze 3 wel nieuw gekocht , maar 1 daarvan is ook pas recent gereleased ( volbeat - seal the deal & let 's boogie ) en de ander 2 ( kings of leon - only by the night en mot\u00f6rhead - ace of spades ) scheelde ook nauwelijks in prijs . 
  what makes you think we do that ? 
  what do you mean by blockers ? 
  when hacking a 4 glyph sequence correctly you get 120 % bonus plus a bonus for how fast you finished the sequence . 
  i generally get an additional 60 % . 
  that 's a 180 % bonus , which is a lot . 
  is there a way to find portals by name ? 
  in our local ho i see a lot of people just using portal names , but i never really know which ones they 're talking about . 
  this is false . 
  the first birds have finished their training and are reading to start . 
  they are able to take down drones up to 3kg without hurting themselves . 
  there is armor being developed for the birds to enable them to also take down those larger drones . 
  dutch source from today : http://nos.nl/l/2131405, 
  for 3 . 
  depending on the other players in your area and their tactics , you can also capture portal a on day 1 , b on day 3 and c on day 5 . 
  when a decays , you can lay the field again . 
  when b decays 2 days later , you can lay the field again , etc.

  hoe was royal republic ? 
  i 've a chainoiler installed . 
  i use it every other fuelstop , so roughly every 550 km/330 mi . 
  i completely clean it quarterly ( + / - 1000km/620mi ) . 
  the 600 upv was the 25 % cutoff at that time . 
  there already were multiple answers saying that modding and deploying also count .
