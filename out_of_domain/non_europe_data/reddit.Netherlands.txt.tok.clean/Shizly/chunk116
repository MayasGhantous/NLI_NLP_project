  he 's referring to 12-16 year olds . 
  that 's a massive difference socially . 
  he was referring to kids . 
  it 's in his comment . 
  you even quoted that part . 
  it 's a common saying . 
  and there 's a little bit of a difference between a 14 y.o. 
  and 21 y.o.

  dusssss, 
  suggestions for a documentary on nepal ? 
  i 'm going to travel to nepal next year and am looking for some nature/history/every-day-life documentaries . 
  so far the only documentaries i could find are based around mt. 
  everest , earthquake disasters and orphanages . 
  en hoe lost dat 4 dagen in de week stage/1 dag school op ? 
  tunnel ? 
  the first time i 've seen it was on either / r/fitness or / r/running , but that was years ago . 
  and it probably did n't originate from there . 
  nice pictures and great tips , high quality post op . 
  how long did you spent in each place and did the triangle trip take ? 
  which stop would you like to revisit the most ? 
  and why ? 
  en was om 06.00 thuit . 
  was wat anders dan ingepland . 
  je weet wat ze zeggen , `` nothing good happens after 2 a.m '' .

  umh , when did he say that he thought you could n't vote on a retired driver ? 
  he said that he was curious whether a retired driver still could be the dod . 
  tourists also do the first thing . 
  i woud say that every traveller is a tourist , but not every tourist is a traveller . 
  and ` siting on a hilltop admiring the view ' is n't something special that only travellers do . 
  especially in prague . 
  jaaa . 
  you ca n't pay with creditcard in [ any regulair albert heijn ] ( http://www.ah.nl/klantenservice/29672/algemeen/30123/service ) , for example . 
  same goes for many jumbo 's . 
  i 'm looking for my first dslr or mirrorles with a budget of 700usd ( 650eur ) for the body and 2 lenses . 
  problem i have with a mirrorless is that is must have a finder , that 's on of my big requirements . 
  this means i would be looking for something like a sony a6000 . 
  the body costs 600usd . 
  with a 16-50mm + 55-210mm kitlens that would total on 1050 usd ( 950eur ) , which is way out of budget . 
  now i 'm looking for a nikon d3300 ( 350usd ) or canon eos 1300d ( 350usd ) . 
  anyone have thoughts on how those compare to the a6000 in terms on image quality ? 
  is the a6000 a lot better in that regard , or is the price difference from different places ? 
  and any thougts on how the d3300 and 1300d compare ? 
  i read some initual reviews of the d3300 and it seems that the d3300 used a lot more high quality sensors and processors , while the 1200d already seemed outdated . 
  and as far as i see the 1300d uses the same sensor as the 1200 . 
  thanks for the info !, 
  i will check the olympus and fuiji lines . 
  i 'm still in the early stages of deciding , so there 's still a lot of info to process .

  heb 2 dilemma 's, 
  met 18-50mm kitlens 700 euro . 
  een nikon d3300 18-55mm of canon 1300d 18-55mm kost zo 'n 450 euro . 
  of misschien 1 18-105mm in plaats van 18-55mm ? 
  want de maximale zoom van de 18-55 is de minimale van de 55-210 . 
  de d3300 is inderdaad dx . 
  thanks for the tip !, 
  i 'll check it out . 
   our colleague is lost in nepal , annapurna area . 
  please help us find her !, 
  say i 'd buy a aps-c dlsr , would the lenses for those dlsr be usable on a potential future same-brand aps-c mirrorless ? 
  or is there a fundamental difference between the two that makes it impossible ? 
  thanks for the advice !, 
  thanks for the explanation !, 
  it 's really useful . 
  definitely that . 
  a couple weeks ago i took part in creating a big field . 
  the next day there were 3 enl players that flipped my entire town . 
  a town that has been untouched for weeks and only has me as a player . 
  just take it as a compliment . 
  by scraping the comm data . 
  which is against the rules of niantec , but both teams do it .

  edit :, 
  i use them for keys for bigger operations and keys which i probably need often . 
  once a month or so i go to a big city nearby , which has over a hundred portals in really close range . 
  you 're always within reach of 3-5 portals , and that for a kilometer or so . 
  i use the locker to store those 200 + keys and when i go back next time , i can unload them and just start linking and fielding . 
  i also have 50 + keys of a portal in the middle of nowhere , so that i can make a star to that portal when i feel like it . 
  meanwhile , i 'm also collecting keys to lay a multilayerfield on my own . 
  which adds another 40 keys . 
  my town is n't heavily fought after , since i 'm the only player here . 
  tho enl does like to kick it down when i annoy them . 
  so i 've 3-4 keys for all the portals in my town . 
  when the enl kick it down , i just want to rebuild is . 
  having to wait until i 've enough keys is just plain annoying .
