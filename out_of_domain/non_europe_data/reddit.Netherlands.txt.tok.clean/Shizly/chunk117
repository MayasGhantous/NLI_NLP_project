  yeah , i do n't see why it should be there . 
  it takes up a lot of space . 
  the button in the top-left was fine with me . 
  if it was only a bottom bar i would agree , but now there a 3 bars . 
  the top bar , the bar with the current song and the bottom bar . 
  and all of them are quite large . 
  they could easily half the top bar and song-bar . 
  instead they give us less space to see the actual content . 
  funny , since they did already solve it . 
  should be solved now . 
   the previous issues surrounding dropped items and links have been resolved . 
  agents are also reporting that previous items that disappeared when picked up have reappeared where they were dropped . 
  we appreciate you patience as we worked to resolve this . 
  edit :, 
  grrrrrr . 
   ladies and gentlemen , we have passenger who did n't pay for a ticket . 
  at the next station we will make a delayed stop to hand him over to the authorities .

  ik vind voor zulke posts ook ` reddit new comments highlighter ' een hele chille extension . 
  in de afgelopen [ vrijmibo ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/5et2bs/de_vrijmibodraad/daey4mg/?context=3 ) had ik het erover dat ik heel erg benieuwd was naar de cadeau 's die ik zou krijgen . 
  jeej .

  anyone got a link of that ? 
  i 'm debating between the dali zensor 1 and dali zensor 3 . 
  i can get a pair of zensor 1 's with the denon n9 receiver for 420 euro 's and a pair of zensor 3 's + denon n9 for 540 euro 's . 
  that means an additional 120 euro/60 euro per speaker . 
  it 's my first not-logitech-25-euro-pc-speakers-system , so i 'm not sure what to do . 
  120 euro 's more seems like quite a lot . 
  i have to listen to both the z1 and z3 , but it seems that the z1 bass output is quite bad unless you put it close to a wall . 
  that is n't possible in my bedroom situation , so i 'm worried about the bass being horrible . 
  any thoughts ? 
  edit :, 
  for the record . 
  the system will mostly be used for music along the lines of rock classics , hard rock and folk . 
  it will also be used for movies/tv series and gaming , but not nearly as often as music . 
  the speakers will be at the end of my bed , so roughly at a 2 meter distance . 
  the nearest wall at the back is 1-1 .5 meters away . 
  however , the rule in our community is that you have to be at least l14 . 
  this is to that you at least get a 75 % effeciency rate at recharge . 
  those portals can over a thousand miles away , you do n't want to waste pcs by letting people who get < 50 % efficiency ( to say a random number ) .

  wat is hier mis mee ? 
   being able to say that you were able to see your kids growing up at every point of time is worth more than any further titles !,

  i seem to be the opposite of most . 
  i aim to carry 100 < l4/l5/l6 and 70 l7/l8 . 
  that enables me to create 50 fully deployed portals on my own , plus an additional 20 l7/l8 . 
  the same as always . 
  the more command enables you to get a key while you already have one in your inventory . 
  is 185.000 stemmers nu vs 150.000 stemmers in 2015 . 
  are those 4 codes posted somewhere when they 're solved ? 
  96 pc l8, 
  96 us l8, 
  48 pc l8 and 48 us l8, 
  currently i also have 1 with 96 common shield and 1 with 90 shields and 6 keys from special places . 
  i 'm planning a larger solo job , so lots of common mods and low level reso 's are welcome . 
  low level reso 's are easy to come by , but mods are harder . 
  what about the portal that made you l8 ? 
  that would be my choice . 
  no , that would n't be to useful . 
  i understood it as the codes only working for 24 hours . 
  but if they have a limited number of redeems it would n't work . 
  die staan [ hier ] ( http://www.groenehart.nl/routes?category[0]=30104&amp;page=2&amp;sort=city ) . 
  i 've never , ever seen anything like that . 
  do you have a link to the ad ? 
  you could try youtube if you have the brandname . 
  the dutch word for `` commercial '' is `` reclame '' , maybe that helps . 
  thought it was interisting to compare spotify with the last.fm scrobles and compare my last year with the last 30 days . 
  according to last.fm i 've scrobbled 1791 unique artists , 3036 unique albums and 4908 unique tracks . 
  placing me in the 98th percentile of the artists/albums and 96th percentile of tracks . 
  longest streak is 117 days and biggest day has 183 tracks . 
  i 've scrobbled 21.659 tracks , but not once between 2 and 3 am . 
  though i did listen to 52 days and 15 hours worth of music .
