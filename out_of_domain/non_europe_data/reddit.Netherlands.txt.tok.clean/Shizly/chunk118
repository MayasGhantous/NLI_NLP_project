  not that surprised by spotify and last.fm yim . 
  i 'm not the biggest metalhead , so i listen to the same heavy music pretty often . 
  meanwhile i do appreciate more relaxed music , but in that ` genre ' i listen to a wider range of songs and artists . 
  i am surprised by my 30 days , combined volbeat - evelyn has nearly trice as much plays as the number 2 . 
  also note worthy , the offspring is n't in my spotify top 100 at all . 
  i can say with confidence completely wrong . 
  it 's one of the artists i listened the most to this year . 
  you just got yourself a new follower . 
   hey folks , do not freak out yet . 
  make sure your email settings on your account page : https://www.spotify.com/account/notifications/ make sure the option for email is set to a green check mark under spotify news and offers . 
  i also made sure to tick on the green check mark for the push notification as well . 
  some of the rock stars and a number of premium subscribers , we have been getting monthly wrap ups of the content we have listened to as a test to make sure everything is working . 
  if the your top songs 2016 have hit for most spotify users , the individual user spotify stats should be coming soon . 
  from the [ spotify community ] ( https://community.spotify.com/t5/content-questions/no-my-year-in-music-2016/m-p/1518426 ) . 
  this seems to imply that this is going to be a new feature that they 've been testing the last couple months internally . 
  i 'd say that the mail to you has been a mistake . 
  i remember reading a couple months ago someone mentioning the same issue . 
  volgens last.fm heb ik 1791 unique artists , 3036 unique albums en 4908 unique tracks [ gescrobbled ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmomcik_s5o&amp;t=22s&amp;ab_channel=damian ) . 
  1 | amon amarth - valhalla awaits me | amon amarth - valhalla awaits me | volbeat - evelyn ( live ), 
  2 | billy talent - red flag | billy talent - viking death march | volbeat - a warrior 's call, 
  3 | ac/dc - highway to hell | ac/dc - highway to hell | volbeat - evelyn, 
  4 | amon amarth - first kill | billy talent - red flag | the dreadnoughts - the cruel wars, 
  5 | anti-flag - the press corpse | anti-flag - the press corpse | guns n ' roses - civil war,

  10 | volbeat - the devil 's bleeding crown | the offspring - the kids are n't alright | volbeat - 7 shots, 
  ook bijzonder is dat in de hele spotify top 100 the offspring er niet instaat . 
  is 40 % langer . 
  complete shit . 
  it 's nearly impossible to find other users , let alone find friends . 
  i only use it to keep track of what i 've listened to . 
  it just seems stupid that they 've the functionality to find people with similar taste , but that you ca n't even find friends and users through the search function . 
  let alone trough facebook or something . 
  all the stats ? 
  compared to 2015 it 's really incomplete . 
  you get your top 3 songs , total minutes listened , total artists and total unique songs . 
  furthermore there is your top genres , top artists and they show which weekday you listen the most . 
  compared to 2015 it 's just plain simple and boring . 
  spotify already released this feature in october in japan . 
  does n't seem that unlikely that they 've been testing it there . 
  s6 , same problem . 
  it 's a problem with the resolution . 
  samsung has a game tuner app . 
  install the app and apply the ` balanced ' mode instead of ` high ' . 
  the ` balanced ' mode could already be selected , then you have to select it again . 
  you want to remove it ? 
  no clue . 
  you could disable its notification rights .

  are the opening posts going to be the same , or are you going to adjust the material of last year ? 
  nummer 1733 , memory remains - metallica is ook een stuk 2e kamer debat . 
  1833 , sad mans tongue - volbeat ook . 
   fuel, 
  what about 2 , 3 , 4 en 5 ? 
  oehhhhh yeah, 
  it 's a gym , not a library . 
  you should expect gym sounds in a gym . 
  edit :, 
  dat is gedurfd . 
  de lonely planet al gelezen ? 
  just bought a new camera ( nikon d3300 ) and only used it a couple times . 
  somehow i 'm unable to upload them to imgur for now , so i used tinypic .

  some sheep in a field . 
  the horizon is n't completely straight and i think that maybe it should be cropped a bit . 
  [ picture that should went better ] ( http://i67.tinypic.com/2i7sdw4.jpg ) . 
  in the real world there are multiple straight lines ending at the same point in the horizon . 
  i tried to show that , but failed at that . 
  i tried doing the picture by standing on the road , but then you could n't see that water anymore .

  how is this a problem ? 
  if it 's your faction you can finish it up , if it 's the opposite you can destroy it easily . 
  625 ap with virtually no effort . 
  i do it often in a city center when i 'm just passing through . 
  what did the hospital say when you explained your problem to them ? 
  so what do you expect to get for a respond from us ? 
  you have payments due with the hospital , not with us . 
  discuss the paymentterms with them . 
  we have 3 slowchat posts a week , an irc channel and multiple secondary subs that can be used for banter . 
  no need to have even more banter-zone 's . 
  i assume you 're already familiair with / r/1200isplenty ? 
  no problem that you ai n't an expert , we 're all here for a reason  . 
  thanks for the advice !, 
  what do you mean with ` how straight the irrigation canal is ' ? 
  are you talking about the actual canal going vertically towards the horizon or about the horizontal border down in the frame ? 
  thanks for the advice !, 
  it 's really useful .
