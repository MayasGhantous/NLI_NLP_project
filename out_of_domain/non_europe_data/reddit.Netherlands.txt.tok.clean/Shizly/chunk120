  expect to pay 1600-2000 euro for a drivers license here . 
  they separate from the netherlands though . 
  is it 2012/2013 again ?

  f60 because ferrari was in f1 for 60 years and f150 because of the italian unification 150 years ago . 
  only the f138 is random crap . 
  13 because of `` 2013 '' and 8 because of the v8 . 
  i 've a lens that has a [ big , white cup ] ( http://imgur.com/a/nlfdu ) protecting the camera-side of the lens . 
  now i want to store this lens in a lensbag . 
  would it be okay for me to do that without the white cup ? 
  it adds roughly a cm to the lens , which means i need to buy a much bigger fit since it would be just a bit to long for the bag i want . 
  thanks for the advice . 
  i 've bought the bigger bag , since it would still be a really tight fit without the white cup . 
  since it 's propably < 35kw , you 'll need an a2 license . 
  this you can get at 20 years old . 
  how are you going to change the 300cc in 125cc ? 
  a1 is limited to 11kw and 125cc . 
  changing the airflow wo n't change the engine volume . 
  no , you ca n't . 
  you 're not allowed to have a engine bigger then 125cc on a a1 license . 
  300 is more then 125 , so you ca n't . 
  en dan is de motor nog kleiner . 
  `` i 'm sorry to hear that our employee did that '' . 
  i thought he was the driver of mclaren . 
  since when did honda join f1 again as a team ? 
  dat is wat anders . 
  yes , it is . 
  it basically locks your motion , making it very unlikely to make a c-shaped motion with your body when performing the squat . 
  this was pretty common only a couple years ago . 
  i remember having to wake up every year for at least 1 03.00 am gmt race . 
  the dsi is composed with marines , green barets , sf from the military police and specially trained police unites . 
  its under command of both the police and the military . 
  which rules are they violating ? 
  and whose rules ? 
  again , which rules are they violating ? 
  i bet you 're glad that you 're using a throwaway now . 
  the embarrassment !, 
  thanks for providing us with the correct information than . 
  only a week beforehand .

  so how do you start sorting 18.000 photo 's ? 
  i think my couple hundred holiday pictures are already a pain in the ass . 
  je specialiseert je in een hele specifieke richting . 
  als de discussie is of ze het bestaan ervan erkennen of niet is dat relevant ja . 
  so we basically lost 25 % of the teams the last 5 years . 
  last week there was a post here from a pitbox that had some guy in it with a really old camera . 
  that turns out to be this guy , who uses an 104-year-old camera to shoot f1 photographs .

  nice !, 
  get out here with your facts !, 
  do n't you know ferrari is evil and wants to screw over kimi ? 
  jeej !, 
  guilty of what ? 
  making the car crash with his kick ? 
  like the idea of dotting the second line of a team . 
  however , raikonnens line is n't dotted . 
  it 's a dumb point . 
  you bought the product they sold . 
  complaining that they should do y because you 're a `` paying customer '' is silly, 
  ca n't you put a tiny , black border around the lines and use a white background ? 
  the advantage is that you do n't have to spend 400 million to be even close to competitive . 
  that simply is n't worth the money . 
  the people surrounding the victim do n't know what to do . 
  so no , the main character would n't get in the way performing the heimlich maneuver .

  ric just said on dutch television that if max admits his mistake in the debrief , that would be good . 
  however , if max just talkes over it or pretends it 's not his fault there will be a bigger problem in the team . 
  it 's not illegal , unless specified for certain area 's in the apv . 
  being intoxicated is illegal, 
  thanks for welcoming me for 1 month of my malaysian trip . 
  i ended up there more on accident then on purpose , but was really surprised by how nice the country was . 
  do you think that the government should invest more in getting tourists to malaysia ? 
  i ended up there to meet a friend and it simply was the cheapest option to go to that also looked nice . 
  bit late to the party , but did you have to book very far in advance ? 
  and did you do the ` classic tour ' or the ` waterfall tour ' ? 
  planning on going to the region in a couple months and this seems really awesome . 
  they still do weight cars , just not every single one .

  obvious answer , neem een hobby !, 
  no problem , thanks for the info . 
  i really like this style . 
  do you know any more watches like this ? 
  only think that keeps me of at the moment is that the seconds are larger displayed than the hours . 
  what ?
