  and that works different then a dryer . 
  a dryer centrifuges your laundry whole blowing in hot air , a wasmachine does n't . 
  what about '' ... that start with an a '' ? 
  `` dislike '' is too big of a word . 
  say that if the seconds and minutes numbers were switch it would take me 5 seconds to pull the trigger and now 5 minutes . 
  what ? 
  there is a really big spatboard on both wheels . 
  maar dat is race . 
  said by an even sadder kid . 
  he is right . 
  this would n't be upvoted if it was some random guy and propably even be removed . 
  always funny to see a white knight in the wild . 
  issue is dat ik dus in de nacht werk . 
  what ? 
  she decided to be there . 
  it 's indeed indefensible that she thinks being old excuses her for not leaving and means that they would stop for her . 
  being an old shit does n't give you more rights then others , even though she seems to think that . 
  the riot police is clearing the street . 
  whether you 're 20 or 80 does n't matter , you have to leave . 
  what should the police do otherwise ? 
  just go home because someone is being old ? 
  they are going to arrest her . 
  it 's not the job of the first line to arrest someone . 
  the second line behind them will arrest them . 
  how ? 
  how is it possible that there are so many people ? 
  i understand that a country with 100 million people will grow faster than a country with 10 million people , but how did it start ? 
  morning folks ,, 
  i 'm a 18 year old boy ( 175cm tall , 60kg heavy ) and have some problems with finding a trainings program that fills my needs . 
  for over a year i was trying to become overall stronger , but i just ca n't figure out how i can do that efficiently . 
  i started to fitness to gain confidence , to get in shape and to be able to join our ( not us ) military . 
  in the begin i had a good start , but i keep having a problem ( about that later ) . 
  to clarify , my goals are :, 
  - gaining overall strength, 
  - do 12 perfect dead-hang pull-ups, 
  - do 50 sit-ups in 2:00, 
  - do 60 push ups in 2:00, 
  - six pack/stronger abs ? 
  but as mentioned , i have a small problem . 
  my core is keeping me from performing more then 12-14 push ups . 
  when practicing chin-ups i noticed to same problem ( i ai n't able to perform more than 1.5 pull ups , so did n't meet the problem with my core there ) . 
  every time i want to perform more , my abs just collapse . 
  that made me decide that i needed more focus on my abs . 
  since i wanted to do more about my abs , i started to think about trying to create a small six pack . 
  and that made me think about my diet . 
  it ai n't healthy at all . 
  but since i live with my parents i 'm not able to just start a whole diet with `` eat monday that for diner , tuesday that , ... ) . 
  i was thinking more about `` eat that for diner '' , `` eat that as small snack '' ( i get out of the door at 8am and am back at 9pm so most of my diet consist out of cookies and white bread with peanetbutter ) . 
  i 've tried : [ 100 push-ups ] ( http://hundredpushups.com/ ) , [ 25 pull-ups ] ( http://www.twentyfivepullups.com/ ) and the `` ab workout '' on the iphone ( 10 minutes , 10 exercises of 1 minute long ) . 
  for a long time i 'm thinking about kettlebelting , but i decided to wait for any advice [ / r/fitness ] ( / r/fitness ) could give . 
  any help with reaching my goals would be very , very welcomed . 
  so yes , we are all against sopa and boycotting the companies/politicians who support sopa . 
  but there are also companies/politicians who oppose sopa . 
  and i think that we need to tell them that they are awesome and that we need them to win this battle . 
  take for example kaspersky . 
  they have [ withdrawn from the bsa ] ( http://news.softpedia.com/news/kaspersky-sopa-divides-the-world-into-criminals-and-idiots-238825.shtml ) because the bsa supports sopa . 
  so i just mailed them , telling them how much we need that kind of support and how much i appreciate that attitude towards sopa and the bsa . 
  i do not have a list with companies/politicians who oppose sopa . 
  but there must be one out there . 
  or otherwise , we could make one . 
  and how are we going to get this attention spread out in the whole world ? 
  i mean , it 's just insane how big anti-acta is in poland . 
  i want to fight acta in a active way , but i do n't know exactly how the european union works . 
  i know that there is a european parliament . 
  and the ep is the only directly elected institution in the eu . 
  but i want to learn more . 
  what would be a good read ? 
  why ? 
  why is n't it made universal ? 
  since sl has nothing to do with articulation , would n't it be just as easy to have made sl a universal language ? 
  but as far as i read about it , asl and bsl does n't even look like each other , even though both american and british is english . 
  i was just reading some of the points in the agreement between vvd , cda and pvv , but to me some where just awful . 
  is it maybe better that this plan did n't goth through ? 
  or are the ( possible ) consequences of not having a plan at this moment even worse ? 
  points of agreement ( source : rtl nieuws ) :, 
  * aow : in 2015 to 66, 
  * health care : own contribution up to 9e/recept . 
  awbz to 600 million . 
  * btw : low btw +1 % ( 6 % -  7 % ) . 
  high rate +2 % ( 19 % -  21 % ), 
  * housing market : `` hytoheekrenteaftrek '' not for for now interest-only mortgage . 
  * broadcast budgeting : first year -25 million , second year -50 million . 
  * freeze salaries, 
  * purchasing power : low income taxes with 4.2 billion euro to composite for the hight btw rates . 
  * education : stufi becomes a full loan system . 
  parents have to pay the schoolbooks in secondary school . 
  i 'm pretty sure i raped him in prison . 
  for example ( from my memory , real example could be different ) : if you liked multiplayer gaming , you could describe yourself as a team worker . 
  i 'm currently preparing for a job interview and it would have been really helpful if i had the shot . 
  some time ago , professor schultz and dr. hazim from the hanover ( germany ) did research on the subject of ritual slaughtering of animals . 
  they concluded that in the halal method of slaughtering , the group of test subjects felt less pain than those in the group that goth the method with cbp stunning . 
  i have a hard time believing that slicing someones veins and let them bleed to death is less painful than cbp stunning . 
  i 'm also worried about the reliability of the research itself , since i can only find the conclusions on islamic sites and i 'm unable to find the actual research . 
  that makes my question : is the islamic slaughtering of animals actually less painful than `` regular '' slaughtering ?

  she is trustworthy . 
  i think it writes faster and it looks better . 
  i do n't understand why it get so much hate on reddit,
