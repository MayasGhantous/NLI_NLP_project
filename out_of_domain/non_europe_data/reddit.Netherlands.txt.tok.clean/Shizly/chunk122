  i want to buy ps + , but ai n't sure if i should buy ps + on the us psn of the eu psn ( i 'm from the eu ) . 
  the eu psn tends ( tended ) to have less content than the us psn , but is this also the case with ps + ? 
  i do n't mind waiting a week longer , but i do mind have more/better content . 
  hallo ,, 
  i 'm using firefox 18.0.1 and i ca n't get rpl to work . 
  whenever i try to load a subreddit , it just does n't load and keeps on `` adding new items ... '' . 
  i 've put ff in safe-mode and then rpl did work . 
  after manually reactivating all my addons , i saw that adblock was the problem . 
  then i created an exception-rule for rpl , but that only made things worse . 
  when i did that , the layout just disappeared and i only had text . 
  is there any way to fix this ? 
  as a f1 junkie trying to expend my views , i decided to try fia wec . 
  i really loved the 24h le mans last year and watched most of it and know i would like to get into wec more . 
  now i have a couple questions to shoot :, 
  what are the rules that i need to know ? 
  what do the different classes mean ? 
  who are the guys to follow ? 
  which blogs/sites report to follow for wec ? 
  how do alcs , elms and fia wec work with each other ( cross-over teams , same organisors , completely different class ? ) ? 
  and what else should i really know ? 
  i 've been looking at building a gaming pc that could handle heavier games like fsx , ksp , end of nations etc.

  * western digital green wd20earx, 
  * fractal design define r4 pearl black, 
  * dell ultrasharp u2312hm zwart, 
  * kingston hyperx khx1600c9d3b1k2/8gx, 
  this ran me into a problem . 
  i already bought ram ( 2x4 gb , 1600cl9 ) , but it 's 1.65 v. 
  and as far i understand 1.65 v wo n't with the cpu . 
  does anyone has tips on how to better the build ? 
  and what to do with the ram ? 
  edit :, 
  i do n't plan on overclocking in the near future , but ca n't speak for next year . 
  that 's why i still selected a k version of the cpu , but did n't buy an other cooler . 
  i just build my new pc and wanted to start playing fsx with my x-52 hotas . 
  however , it does n't seem to work in normal windows , only in safe mode . 
  at first i connected the hotas to the usb , but the lights on the thruster did n't go on , while those on the joystick did . 
  i just thought that those the lights on the thruster where broken and tried installing the drivers from the saitek site . 
  when i started the install , the installer froze and i had to force my pc to restart . 
  here i noticed that i could n't even get past the bios screen with the hotas plugged in . 
  then i tried installing the drivers in safe mode , and that worked . 
  the lights on the controller even worked again . 
  but when i go back to regular windows , the lights stay off and i 'm unable to use the key profiler ( it freezes on launch ) . 
  any suggestions ? 
  those are the only issues i have with starting the pc and the usb ports . 
  i 'm using windows 7 x64 , currently no gpu installed and my cpu is a i5-4670k . 
  ** update : **, 
  i just went out of safe mode again . 
  when plugging the device on in launch all the lights are turned on , but then the system freezes on the windows launch . 
  when restarting the pc without the device plugged in , i was able to start windows but now i have the problem with the device not working again . 
  when having the devices plugged in windows start acting weird ( freezes , no internet ) and when i unplugged and wanted to shut down the system , it stuck on the logging off screen . 
  i remember that in 2010 there was a fight between 3 teams trying to get into f1 ( usf1 , hrt and another one ) . 
  since hrt left we now only have 11 teams and i do n't hear anything about a replacement . 
  since shipping to new zealand would make me instant poor , international shipping was n't an option for me . 
  however , i can hop over the border to my neighboring countries easily and send a package at local rates . 
  and sending it through the post office here would n't cost that much more . 
  for 10eur more i could send it to 11 countries and reach 370 million people instead of 1 country and reaching 17 million people . 
  title says it . 
  i want to buy an used iphone 4s ( 32 or 64gb ) . 
  are there any tips to look for when buying an used one ? 
  indicators of how much the phone had the endure , etc. 
  morning . 
  i 've decided to pickup guitar playing again ( jeej for me ) . 
  i fired up my vox vt20 + , but it turns out he has a very loud humming sound . 
  it 's always there , even without my guitar connected to it . 
  it sounds the same as in [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yx-sumbv7u ) video . 
  i 've already reseted the amp to factory settings , but that did n't help . 
  going to an other room that 's on an other power group did n't help either . 
  how more watts i ask from him how louder the hum gets , but playing around with the volume settings does n't matter for the humming ( i can turn the volume full up no problem ) . 
  i have him for 3,5 years now , but he was unused for 2,5 of them and i ca n't remember having the same problem back then . 
  thoughts ? 
  i 've read something about contact cleaner , but without any additional information on where to do it . 
  ( unrelated question : is it recommended to change my guitar strings after 2,5 years not using them ? ), 
  edit :, 
  correction . 
  i have him for 2,5 years and stopped playing 1,5 years ago . 
  since a couple weeks i 've a problem with login in on my pc ( windows 7 ) . 
  whenever i login i can immediately start using programs like firefox , but it takes up to 2 minutes to launch the launchsoftware ( my keyboard driver , utorrent , gmail notifier ) and the internet icon keeps spinning until that moment .
