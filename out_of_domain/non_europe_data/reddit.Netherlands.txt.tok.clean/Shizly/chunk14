  then why did n't he held elections if he was that good for egypt ? 
  victory secured . 
  he also took the lives of many mothers and fathers that where against his regime . 
  care to elaborate how he saved yours ? 
  is that a dead puppy ? 
  i feel so sorry for all the tech supports in australia . 
  told this partly in another submission about the war in fr/be/nl :, 
  a lot of people died . 
  seems obvious , but i 'm talking about the average persons . 
  my grandfather ( 11-16 ) saw a lot of his friends die during the german occupation . 
  he worked at a farm , and a german plane crashed into the fields . 
  some of his friends went to the field to see what happend , but got shot cause they broke the curfew . 
  also , the hongerwinter . 
  we live in a village below the rijn , and my grandfather worked together with some farmers to transport food to the north on homemade rafts . 
  they had 3 rafts that they used to transport bread and water . 
  they did this for a couple of weeks until they got discovered . 
  the germans opened fire on one of the rafts that sank . 
  since then it was almost impossible to redo it because they germans started using searchlights . 
  our village also got bombed ( no mass bombing , but since it was a small village it was very easy to just blow the village away with only a couple of planes ) . 
  after the bombing of rotterdam , some planes still had bombs left and they used those to bomb small villages . 
  it destroyed the school and a part of the church . 
  and during the liberation , a lot of canadian cavalry used our bridge to go to the north . 
  my grandfather and a couple of his friends that survived sat on the water tower and watched how canadian troops march into the village . 
  how are the lap times measured to the 1/1000th of the second ? 
  gps does n't seem accurate enough . 
  thank you for that , it was an useful read . 
  because then you help the market . 
  the seller actually will get the money if you do that , and will again sell someone . 
  plus that if they know ngo 's are buying their `` products '' , it 's going to be very likely that the situation of the products will even escalate further . 
  imagine you are a fake buyer who wants to set someone free . 
  you see 2 products . 
  one of them is doing well ( taking the situation in account ) and the other one is being raped all the time , has a vagina that 's ripped , etc. 
  you probably would buy the last one . 
  and dealers know this . 
  they will de-huminate their products even further so that you will buy his/her product . 
  the point was n't that rape is funny . 
  the point is that i said `` was your father a thief ? '' . 
  the then expected answer would be something along the lines of `` because he stole all the stares and put them in your eye 's '' . 
  i decided to make an anti-joki about that and change the last line to `` i 'm pretty sure i raped him in prison '' . 
  with this i 'm not trying to make fun of being raped . 
  it 's just a part of the joke . 
  it 's meant to be harsh . 
  one of the classic anti-jokes is `` why did the boy drop his ice cream ? 
  because he got hit by a bus '' . 
  this was not implying that being hit by a bus is funny . 
  at least 1.5 million people die every year because of traffic accidents ( worldwide ) . 
  quick math shows that would be 2-3 dead every minute . 
  so please make another punchline . 
  you 're free to add what you would have said . 
  let me help you correcting that :, 
  that would be a correct sentence that 's more often used . 
  you say `` die '' instead of `` het '' , that 's because `` die '' is the anaphora ( `` verwijswoord '' ) of `` de '' . 
  when we 're talking about het-nouns , the anaphora ( `` verwijswoord ) would be `` dat '' . 
  de/het is a bitch . 
  you really need to get a feeling for it . 
  but there are a few guidelines you can follow . 
  for het-nouns : [ link ] ( http://www.dutchgrammar.com/en/?n=nounsandarticles.04 ) . 
  for de-nouns : [ link ] ( http://www.dutchgrammar.com/en/?n=nounsandarticles.05 ) . 
  you will not be able to identify every word with this guidelines . 
  just remember that if it is n't `` het '' , than it is `` de '' . 
  `` stom '' is the equivalent of ` stupid ' . 
  it 's very common used and socially acceptable to use . 
  people will despise you when you use `` kanker '' as a profanity . 
  sources : [ de nederlandse taalunie ] ( http://taaladvies.net/ ) , [dutchgrammar.com ] ( http://www.dutchgrammar.com/en/?n=main.homepage ) . 
  why should the parents have religious freedom and the child not ? 
  nobody really cares about the difference and you can use both . 
  `` dom '' is more a insult to someones intelligent , where `` stom '' is more an insult to someones character . 
  the difference in definition would be that `` dom '' means `` lack of understanding '' where `` stom '' would mean `` stupid - lack of ability to talk - a letter you do n't say '' . 
  but once again , no one really cares about the difference and you can use the words visa versa . 
  yes , i think we are talking about the same thing . 
  and thank you . 
  thank you very much !, 
  that 's how i do all the multiplications . 
   finally , op , if you 're concerned about the animals pain , you may want to consider switching to vegetarianism . 
  or piscatarianism , because fuck fish . 
  or , best bet , pastafarianism . 
  i 'm not concerned in a way that i would consider becoming a vegetarian . 
  the main reason i asked was because a couple days ago the dutch senate rejected a bill that would forbid religious slaughtering . 
  now there are a lot of debates about this subject going on and a lot of people refer to this research . 
  but as i stated in the op , i really doubt the reliability of the research . 
  and i 'm unable to proof an other view on the subject . 
  do n't you fool me !, 
  you are clearly trying to convince me that your regime does n't see this as anarchistic and there is no need to rebel against the system , because they give is this kind of freedom . 
  but what you did n't expect was that i would look straight through your plans !, 
  [ link ] ( http://boards.4chan.org/b/res/407287440 ), 
  nobody is doing that . 
  but both posts where heavenly upvoted ( in / r/askreddit over 1000 , in / r/videos over 2000 ) and the community behind those 2 subreddits will surely start a attack against the mods of the subreddit in question . 
  yes , you have to dig through a lot of crap . 
  but there are some useful tips . 
  i would recommend through the top section and just keep an eye out on posts , even when 19/20 posts are useless . 
  that means 1/20 are useful . 
  and you could look through [ thedatingspecialists his blog ] ( http://www.thedatingspecialist.com/dating-101/ ) . 
  so now you 're just fucked as a new player ? 
  bandits with weapons along the coastline are a way bigger problem . 
  before you had a small change to defend yourself , now you 're just screwed . 
  you 're thinking this totally wrong . 
  what facebook did was n't a protest against a company , but an attack to the competition . 
  d66 does n't say `` let 's make all ddos ' legal ! '', 
  but they say `` let 's make ddos legal as a form of protest '' . 
  that 's a big difference .
