  i disagree . 
  the same thing stopping facebook from inventing an excuse to ddos an competitor is the same thing that is preventing an cookie factory hiring people to block the exit of a competitor so that they ca n't spread their cookies . 
  controlling which ddos is valid or not could be even easier than regulating street protests , where you still have the problem of where the protests would take protests . 
  in what conservation did that came up ? 
  they were n't . 
  this was a standard patrol mission in international waters . 
  even though 50 % are just made up ( and i made that 50 % up ) . 
  my grandmother has had every disease you can expect a 90 year old to have , but when she died they just put down `` swine flu '' as cause of death . 
  they did n't had to effort to research what the real reason was ( probably being 90 years old and having 2 types of cancer ) . 
  example : simon newcomb , an the great astronomer , wrote mathematical proof that human flight was impossible and published it a day before the wright brothers took off . 
  just do n't say things are impossible . 
  by the time you said it somebody already has done it . 
  and that could mean you missed an opportunity ( to late to apply for a job ) or that you where just to close minded ( ca n't think of a better way to word it , it 's like in the example ) . 
  so it 's basically america , but colder ? 
  you sir , changed a part of my life right there . 
  me too !, 
  luckily i always insure my ipod for 25 bucks , so when to throw it on water damage ( 5/6 cases ) i get a new one . 
  i 've only bought the 1g ipod , but i have had every ipod generation that came after that . 
  in my experience , they are only good in building consoles . 
  but even their console support is horrible . 
  i once got scammed on psn ( my guess is that the hacker owned a site i registered on with the same password ) and they where like `` hey , you want a refund buddy for that 100eur that is been used to buy psn games ? 
  just call the cc ! '' . 
  so i called the cc and got a refund , gets my psn account blocked by sony because i did an illegal refund . . 
  op needs to deliver and record proposal for a motherlode of karma . 
  you wo n't let you die because you have no money anymore . 
  they socialized it ( for american standards ) . 
  i even did n't learn it from school . 
  i learned from porn , wikipedia and talking with friends . 
  the only thing i `` learned '' in school is that being gay is n't evil and that we should n't discriminate them ( i was 16 when they showed that video ) . 
  but i have to admit that i though that you needed to eat the sperm in order to get a baby . 
  i only have to pay 1800eur a year and the gov give me 250eur a month to pay for college , so i think there is still some improvement to do . 
  ` rope, 
  i do n't know if it was mentioned in the documentery ( is a long time ago since i last watched it ) , but the last dead was a track marshal named graham beveridge . 
  he died in the 2001 gp of australia .

  do you know what caused your deafness ? 
  an error in your brain , damaged hair cells , something different ? 
  is your type of deafness treatable with something like a [ cochlear implant ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cochlear_implant ) or does it look like there will be a treatment anytime soon ? 
  boys fight with fists . 
  girls with physiological warfare . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  he ( math ) never literally stated that he would do a 50/50 split of the total charity money . 
  he would try to raise 20k in donations and would donate 50/50 to 2 charities . 
  that could be defended as 10k/10k . 
  and since 220k/4 = 55k he still would make his promise . 
  fucking 2.26 usd/l in the netherlands right now . 
  definitely a troll . 
  of you mean that ( at least on lower resolutions ) the joystick first looks like a cock : then yes . 
  so , what was the lie ? 
  it 's an audition room . 
  for porn . 
  they measure how many energy ( joules ) the particles has . 
  e = mc ^ 2 . 
  c is known ( the speed of light ) , so when they measure the e ( the energy ) they can calculate the mass . 
  the higgs particle has a energy between 120-130 gev ( iirc ) . 
  almost all planets in me have stories like these .

  you live in a place where taxis ai n't available ? 
  what ? 
  so far as i see it using `` ai n't '' is n't wrong . 
  contraction of am not . 
  used also as a contraction for are not , is not , has not , and have not .

  i realized this before i had read this !, 
  all this precious karma i missed out on ... 
  in concepts . 
  sometimes you ca n't find the right words to express yourself , but you know what you mean . 
  if you would think it out in words , you could just use the words that you use in your mind . 
  you were n't thinking in words , you were thinking in a concept . 
  ca n't we use that service that sends crap to people to send crap to those who voted in favor of acta ? 
  or even to those that did n't vote or where absent . 
  i wonder myself that with almost every story involving a principal ... or with zero tolerance policy . 
  it 's illegal in the us . 
  in the netherlands euthanasia is legal when the conditions are met ( 2 doctors stated that the patient is in horrible pain , the patient volunteered , things like that ) . 
  i do n't know about any other country . 
  we should take turns . 
  every 6 hours someone replies to his comment and he will get a notification .

  you should try using the [ nukemap ] ( http://www.nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&amp;lat%5b%5d=34.395472&amp;lng%5b%5d=132.453528&amp;kt%5b%5d=16&amp;lat%5b%5d=34.395472&amp;lng%5b%5d=132.453528&amp;kt%5b%5d=16&amp;lat%5b%5d=34.395472000000005&amp;lng%5b%5d=132.45335633862305&amp;kt%5b%5d=100000&amp;zm=8 ) that t_lancer linked to earlier and look it up for your own town , it 's fun in a very weird way . 
  the tsar bomba would destroy my entire country if it was tactical placed !, 
  this !, 
  do n't listen to people that say otherwise !, 
  vote for witcher 2 !, 
  tl ; dr : buy everything !, 
  wait , that 's what this is all about ? 
  those few seconds ? 
  never went to zuid-limburg ? 
  it was horrible running there on my vacation .
