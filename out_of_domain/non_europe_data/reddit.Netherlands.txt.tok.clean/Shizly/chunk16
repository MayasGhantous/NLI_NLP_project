  got disapointed when i realised my mistake . 
  i do n't like cheese , even though i 'm from a area where there are a lot of cheese farmers . 
  any tips on how i can start to like it ? 
  no , it is how the original definition of first/second/third world country was . 
  3e : neutral, 
  first of all , i would like to say you look gorgeous . 
  second , why did you choose this line of work ? 
  and how did you get into the business/did you decide to do porn ?

  i 've watched f1 since the day i was born , it 's a family tradition . 
  my father had a mancruch on mika h\u00e4kkinen , but my uncles loved schumacher and everything that had something to do with ferrari . 
  they turned me into a fan of ferrari , just to screw with my dad . 
  in 2007 i did n't really supported a driver . 
  i 'm dutch so i supported albers , but he sucked . 
  so i stayed with the ferrari team and liked massa . 
  in 2008 i fully supported massa and i went down on my knees when massa lost the championship . 
  i was funny in a very weird way , because 2 laps before the finish my dad ( still loved mclaren ) just went upstairs because he was sick of it and i was cheering . 
  but 5 minutes later the roles where inverted ... 
  in 2009 i did n't really care since massa 's crash . 
  i thought that the brawngp car was really cool and button seemed a nice guy , so after the crash i started supporting button . 
  since 2010 i do n't really do n't care that much anymore . 
  i thought ' 10 / '11 were pretty boring , so i started supporting the mid-grid . 
  rosberg , sutil and petrov were awesome to me . 
  petrov did disappoint me in the mid/end -11 and '12 season and sutil has retired , so that was an end to that . 
  today i would say grosjean , i think he has a lot of potential . 
  he only need to drive more controlled ( but i also thought about petrov he just needed to drive more controlled , and see how he performs now ) . 
  and webber . 
  as far as i see him he 's really a nice guy . 
  and he is second driver . 
  i love it when a second driver of a time performs better than the first driver . 
  as last note : i still like kimi , i think it 's a funny guy to see but that 's it . 
  and i really dislike vettel . 
  i think he 's a little bitch that thinks he 's some kind of demigod now he was successful a couple season . 
  and i hate that finger of him so much !, 
  * 2009 : buton/browngp, 
  * 2010-2011 : sutil , petrov , rosberg, 
  that 's it !, 
  we need a book people !, 
  thank you . 
  tomorrow i 'm going to pick up my guitar again !, 
  - yes , i know you said now but family sleeps and they 're going to hate me if i start playing know , i 'm just going to set everything up for tomorrow -, 
  yesterday there was a thread where people suggested that somebody was going to start eating pizza with homeless people and start writing a blog about it . 
  just throwing something in . 
  i 've no idea where your interest are ? 
  motorsports ? 
  keep up-to-date with / r/formula1 , / r/indycar , etc. 
  maybe homebrewing and beer ? 
  you could read / r/homebrewing and / r/beerporn . 
  diy ? 
  try / r/diy , or [ http://www.instructables.com/] ( http://www.instructables.com/ ) . 
  you even could build a robot . 
  and when you do n't think in a hobby-way , start volunteering . 
  start making a difference to people/animals . 
  i do n't know where you live and what the possibilities are , but over here there are a lot of volunteer fighter fighters . 
  maybe a girlfriend or regular friends ? 
  you could try meetup.com or a dating site ( trying would n't hurt ) . 
  i 've never see one come with the car either , but it 's the best investment possible regarding to car safety . 
  i did n't thought you where acting creepy . 
  now i think i 'm creepy ... 
  well , that was unnecessarily harsh . 
  just ... how ? 
  where did you say you live again ? 
  i 'm i the only one who thinks that this movie is overrated ? 
  i thought it was very focused on `` just look how senna is a god !, 
  we shall obey him !, 
  prost is the devil ! '' . 
  but maybe that 's just because i 'm post-senna ? 
  because it 's way less fun . 
  maybe a better response , but still . 
  he could do both . 
  pretend he is a cia agent that tries to assassinate assad/poetin and still note down when she checked his location . 
  well ... ummh ... 
  it 's like ... screw the admins !, 
  i will not fall in their traps . 
  ( seriously , i did not know ), 
  he topped at 200k in 24 days . 
  and the internet is bigger then reddit . 
  because ? 
  they better invent some way to let each other know that they are part of the community , without revealing it to other people . 
  maybe a hand signal ? 
  edit : grammar, 
  for fun ( yes , not all are that small ) :, 
  * [ sickipedia ] ( http://www.sickipedia.org/ ), 
  * [ pusheen the cat ] ( http://pusheen.com/ ), 
  * [ cyanide & happiness ] ( http://www.explosm.net/comics/new/ ), 
  * [ buttersafe ] ( http://buttersafe.com/ ), 
  * [ doghouse ] ( http://thedoghousediaries.com/ ), 
  yes , i was sarcastic . 
  it 's fine . 
  you saved me from the grammar nazis . 
  i think an `` official '' weekly `` photo friday '' would catch more interests . 
  and it makes the mods able to just ban posts that only contain a link to an image . 
  the images that have a story behind them ( i just ran my first 5k after having knee surgery last year , finished him in 25 minutes , was in colorado , etc ) can just be self posts with a link to a picture in the post itself . 
  can you elaborate ? 
  why did you do that ? 
  just because it 's illegal , or because it started to affect her and her surroundings ? 
  just here to say tha i love your work with victoria black . 
  what i did is just following the news in the ict world ( i 'm dutch and only use dutch sources , could n't recommend any international ) . 
  and when i did n't understand something , i googled it . 
  maybe is n't the most effective way , but for me it was the most fun .
