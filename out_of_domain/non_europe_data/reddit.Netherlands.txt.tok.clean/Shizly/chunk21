  well , it 's still a warrior speech . 
  and the geneva convention stated in article 6 :, 
  `` wounded or sick combatants , to whatever nation they may belong , shall be collected and cared for ... 
  evacuation parties , and the personnel conducting them , shall be considered as being absolutely neutral . '', 
  i think that would also be a part of being a good warrior . 
  see your enemies as humans , not animals . 
  respect those who are brave enough to fight you . 
  i 'm afraid there ai n't enough palestinian for a fight like that ... 
  hamas took power after the elections and does n't recognize another election . 
  they did n't take part in the last election that was writen out by the opposition and decides to keep power . 
  palestina is a dictatorship by now . 
  `` does anyone else '', 
  no , ash is . 
  to fight spam bots . 
  it 's explained somewhere in reddits help ( on phone now , ca n't search for it ) . 
  my theory is that since the government is democraticly choosen , supporting your government means that you fight for your people . 
  even if you disagree on a personal level , you would still do what the citizens of our country want . 
  believe it or not , we have our own history that we teach at our schools . 
  the cold war is covered , but it 's just the basics . 
  if obtaining speed up to 99.999 ... c is possible it should n't be a problem , since time changed with speed . 
  his comment was pointed to the one you responed to . 
  so deep . 
  i agree . 
  i did n't see a single post that actually gave an answer to the question . 
  i agree . 
  a lot of good caracters ai n't used anymore and they changed the style to much . 
  plus most episodes ai n't dumb humor with a political message , but a political massage with dumb humor . 
  after season 11/12 they really went the wrong path . 
  that 's not because the post , but because his comments here ai n't usefull . 
  do you have any source on the first statement ? 
  that just does n't seem right and i ca n't imagine that there is n't any documentary that mentions such a vital faillure . 
  they did n't do what the people from tibet wanted . 
  and it still is n't close to a democracy , the tibet people did n't gain any freedom and are losing their culture . 
  male and female . 
  grosjean had 9 dnfs . 
  * ** melbourne : ** got pushed off track by maldonado . 
  [ best ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcmf6pmoq3c ) video i could find . 
  took no other drivers out . 
  * ** malaysia : ** he spinned off track because aquaplaning . 
  took no other drivers out . 
  * ** monaco : ** collided with schumacher . 
  debatable who 's error it was . 
  as you can see on his [ onboard cam ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x90zxus1xkc ) , alonso tried to squeeze himself on a spot that just was n't there . 
  grosjean tries to correct a little bit to the left to give him room , but their tires still hit each other , causing grosjean to go further left , causing a collision with schumacher . 
  i would call this a race accident . 
  took no other drivers out . 
  * ** europe : ** car failure . 
  took no other drivers out . 
  * ** belgium : ** clearly his fault , did take other drivers out . 
  * ** italy : ** banned because off belgium, 
  * ** japan ** : collided with webber . 
  grosjeans fault , could n't find a video . 
  took webber out . 
  * ** abu dhabi : ** collision with perez , webber falls out . 
  could discuss that . 
  i think it 's perez his fault , there was no room for him at that point . 
  grosjean was n't able to go further inside the corner . 
  * ** brazil : ** his fault , could n't control the car . 
  no other drivers taken out . 
  so to summarize : 9 dnf . 
  1/9 because a ban , 1/9 because technical failure . 
  2/9 he did n't collide , he just could n't control the car . 
  that still 5 dnf left . 
  in the ones where there was a collision , 3/9 ( or 1/9 ) was n't his fault ( and 1/5 of these did n't involve an other car to dnf ) . 
  the 2/9 left are his fault . 
  so when we take technical failure , not being able to control the car away and getting pushed or rammed in to away , he only has 2 dnf left . 
  i think that that 's a decent score . 
  yes , he has a lot to improve , but i do think he is f1 worthy . 
  that does n't really matter . 
  you only should n't expect that a request in / r/formula1 would be seen by anyone ( that 's also where / r/iama goes wrong ) . 
  the drivers should be contacted . 
  i think it would n't be to hard to get a driver like kovalaine down here , since he 's very active on twitter . 
  / r/parents ? 
  i loved ` grand prix : the killer years ' even more . 
  made me shed some tears . . 
  i think different from the engines of the days of old, 
  no , nsfw subs are excluded . 
  that 's way has a nsfw random button . 
  lies !, 
  she goes to church !, 
  clearly someone made a mistake in the evolution . 
  rtl lost the rights , sport1 is now going to broadcast it . 
  now let 's hope it 's better there with a post-race commentary and a real pre-race commentary . 
  that last one is n't true . 
  you could put a baby in it - yet it would be very tight - , but not an adult . 
  i learned that from my parents . 
  that 's correct , does n't excist with the rtl . 
  but i do remember a time when there was a hour pre-race in a studio with dutch old f1 drivers and a better grid report . 
  then they also had a post-race report where they would discuss the race . 
  it was awesome . 
  also on ps3 , the only thing the browser on the ps3 is good for . 
  in a link proved earlier she was 171cm and 59kg . 
  that is n't so bad . 
  she 's just ... dense . 
  thank you for reminding me that our reporting sucks . . is there a way to watch the reports back after the race ? 
  i think he is , if he takes the lead at the beginning of the season and is able to stay consistent . 
  he 's already training . 
  the question is of he should calm down the week before the race , or keep training at the same intensity . 
  no , but i see it 's posted in a update in their post about the incident . 
  that 's because violence by non-western immigrants is a really big problem in the netherlands .
