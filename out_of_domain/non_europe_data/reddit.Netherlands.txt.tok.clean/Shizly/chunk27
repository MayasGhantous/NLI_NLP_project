  an additional 30 bucks is to much . 
  plus that i have 2 slots open , so i can always put a addition 8gb in it . 
  but ... why ? 
  kids are materialistic , but also go for imagination . 
  if you maybe died from a impact like that , your car is just unsafe . 
  yeah , you totally got him with you counterarguments !, 
  like useragentfaker ( from memory ) ? 
  a cydia app that does that . 
  thank you . 
  or not , 1.5 bar is nothing . 
  can you expand on that ? 
  so when did he say the world was n't violent ? 
  since we are clearly the same person , i will follow this . 
  need more mirrors . 
  if i remember correctly , they would use drones and let the actual passengers sign a non-disclosure agreement or something like that . 
  it 's a moral thing . 
  would you rather buy eggs from [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8pzpjwgwho ) or from [ here ] ( http://www.aact.org.au/images/battery_hens/pitts%20farm.jpg ) ? 
  and that for + / -15 cent vs + / -22 cent, 
  that 's why i carry my id and donorcard . 
  i think adding your bloodtype would be useless , since the doctors would n't risk giving you the wrong blood . 
  and could find out in a couple seconda in theire database . 
  but that 's just my theory . 
  ofcourse , but the bad ones `` entertain '' us . 
  that the roadsafety in your town is improved by x % is no news , that person y 200km away got beaten up is . 
  since that my cat turned her back on me for a couple days after i went on vacation , i believe that . 
  just finished my first sub-50min 10k !!, 
  i finished with 49:21 . 
  the other posts here are really , really overkill . 
  seriously , guys ? 
  just a couple weeks ago there was a discussion going on here how we should think about the situation of the buyer and how he maybe does n't really know how much he can get for which price . 
  to me it seems you have no idea how much you need to spent go match your requirements and just stated you have a budget of 1500usd ( no offense , just trying to give you the right money/needs system ) . 
  for 1000usd you could have a up-to-date , mid-high-end pc . 
  a wow pc could cost a couple hundred bucks less ( i think 700usd max ) , but this is good for the games that are coming out now and in the coming time .

  if you would want to spent more :, 
  * hd 7950 instead of a 7870 ( 300usd vs 220usd ), 
  * my go-to case would be a 110usd fractal design define r4 . 
  you assume there are multiple groups involved ? 
  pfff ... 
  that is n't from / b / , is it ? 
  do you think i should wait for a couple more months before i buy a new build ? 
  it seems that they change the weather cycles . 
  couple versions ago there was snow on the neu server on christmas , now it comes in januari, 
  let the ai crash . 
  every real race there are dnf 's , but in games that just does n't happen ... 
  easy , `` poetry in motion '' by sky sports .

  i just realised i have to work than ... now i 'm very sad . 
  i really did n't like the ending . 
  he worked 8 years with most of them , there would be at least a little party that evening . 
  but the walking away part was powerfull . 
  that 's why i take a look at google maps before i leave and then set my gps , but leave the screen off . 
  i only start it when i really need it . 
  pretty sure that most judges would laugh at that case . 
  i 'm currently developing the [ hse-expert ] in the [ education ] tree on uni of applied science difficulty . 
  i 'm also working on becoming a [ militarist ] on the [ job ] tree . 
  but that is only as a side-quest . 
  you mean lower crime rates ? 
  fuck quallity control on education , amirite ? 
  that guy probably is n't kidding, 
  well thank you . 
  i 've submitted it in a comment to / r/netherlands, 
  people change in 6 years . 
  mayb op was n't the same guy anymore , maybe the group developed and he did n't . 
  who knows . . 
  you realised that just now ? 
  only money people have 2 potato . 
  police not after them . 
  give them money . 
  try being dutch and talk to foreigner about your country . 
  `` no , i never used drugs '' . 
  `` no , i did n't . 
  drugs usage in the us is twice as high '' . 
  on reddit it 's even worse `` i bet there are a lot of dutch users because of / r/trees '', 
  why would anyone that wants to use drugs go there ? 
  we have way better forums over here with reviews on different types , what the best way to roll a joint is , experience rapports on different drugs , etc. 
  why would anyone go to / r/trees ? 
  this has nothing to do with fraud . 
  he used a figure of speech to make us understand him easier . 
  i remember falling down and the other dude just followed me and was like `` are you okay buddy ? '' . 
  or i like to imagine he was like that . 
  and at the end of the game i lost him for a while and just kind of panicked and got saddened . 
  and was relieved when i found him ... brb , playing journey again . 
  if you mean with `` a lot '' 8/48 ( [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_minimum_wage ) ) , that 's true . 
  but those countries are the scandinavia 's , germany , switzerland , italy and liechtenstein . 
  as far as i know do the first 6 have a pretty decent standard of living and wage .
