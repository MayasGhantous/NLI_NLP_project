  let 's say ( for the sake of the explanation ) that there is 20 meter of metal strip in it . 
  that wire is wound around a central point . 
  in that point there is a arm with a metal point on it . 
  if that point touches the 1m point of the wire in the dimmer , there is very little resistance . 
  so a lot of electricity can reach the light bulb . 
  but now you are going to twist the knob . 
  the arm with the metal point is attached to that knob . 
  when you turn it 359 degrees , it goes to the end of that wire . 
  the 20m point . 
  that causes a lot of resistance . 
  instead of 1m of wire , the electricity have to go through 20m of wire . 
  that makes that less electricity reaches the light bulb . 
  and that 's where pepelarue 's explanation gets involved . 
  there are also other kinds of dimmers , but in home-use there are the most common ( at least here ) . 
  thank you !, 
  was just thinking about that , but i forgot the name of it . 
  good guy firefighter .

  well , post it on 4chan and wait .

  damn . 
  grammar of mother language took the wheel . 
  what i meant is that hey will be told about opcorker . 
  nobody told about the rules and flags yet ?? 
  most important rules to know ( well , i think they are the most important ) :, 
  ** flags : **, 
  * blue : a car is approaching closely and is about to lap you ( that means that he will be a entire lap in front of you ) . 
  you have to let the car pass . 
  * waved yellow ( single ) : in this sector overtaking is prohibited . 
  there is danger . 
  most of the time it means a car crashed and there are pieces on the track, 
  * waved green : end of danger , track is clear . 
  * black ( with car number ) : stop on the next lap . 
  most of the time you are disqualified . 
  * waved red : the race is stopped by the marshals, 
  * chequered : end of the race, 
  ** race length : **, 
  the length of a gp is equel to the least number of laps which exceed a distance of 305km . 
  take for example a circuit that is 10km long . 
  that last lap will be finished , so that would make a total of 310km ( 31 laps ) . 
  ( a exception is monaco where the figure is 260km ), 
  there is a time limit of 2 hours on every race . 
  but when a race need to be stopped ( for example , thanks to heavy rain ) the timer will be stopped . 
  if ( for some reason ) the race is ended before the drivers drove 75 % of the total length of the race , only halve the points are given . 
  ** points : **, 
  points mean everything in f1 . 
  as a driver , you win the championship when you have the most points . 
  1e place gives 25 points , 2e 18 , 3th 15 , 4th 12 , 5th 10 , 6th 8 , 7th 6 , 8th 4 , 9th 2 and 10th 1 . 
  there is also a championship for the teams . 
  every team has 2 drivers . 
  if in the end driver a1 got 145 points and a2 200 , team a has 345 points . 
  ** race weekend **, 
  there are 3 parts in a race weekend . 
  the practice ( as far as i know , not on tv ) , the qualification and the race . 
  there are 3 practice sessions ( p1 , p2 and p3 ) and 3 qualifying sessions ( q1 , q2 and q3 ) . 
  in the qualify session , the line-up for the race is determent . 
  in q1 are all cars on the track . 
  the 7 slowest cars drop out . 
  the remaining cars will go to q2 . 
  then again , the 7 slowest drop out . 
  10 cars go the q1 where they will fight for the fastest lap and the best spot on the grid positions . 
  if a driver is 107 % slower then the fastest driver , he will not be allowed to race . 
  example : driver a has the fastest lap with 100 seconds ( 1:40 ) . 
  driver d has a lap time of 210 seconds ( 3:50 ) . 
  that 's 110 % slower , to he is not allowed to drive . 
  ** safety car **, 
  when there is a very dangerous situation ( heavy rain , major collision , etc ) , a safety car will be called on the circuit . 
  all the cars have to line up behind the safety and overtaking is forbidden ( but the rules for that rule changed a bit for the 2012 season and i just do n't get them yet ) . 
  a system that stores energy that is created with the braking . 
  using the energy stored in kers gives a 81hp boost . 
  but you can only use it a couple seconds every lap . 
  the driver can choose to use all the energy at once , or spread is out ( or not at all ) . 
  the drag reduction system . 
  enables the driver to open his rear wing . 
  this reduces drag and increases top speed . 
  but there are very strict rules on using the drs. 
  * you have to be maximum 1 second behind the car in front of you ( does n't matter of you lapt that car or not ) . 
  * you are in a drs zone ( zone is determined by the fia ), 
  * you are not in the first 2 laps or in the first 2 laps after a restart/safety car appearance . 
  i thinks that these are the most important things to know about the rules . 
  of course , there is a lot more . 
  ( if i accidentally made a mistake , please correct me ) . 
  cause `` 60 's, 
  thank you for explaining the new rule . 
   ass, 
  maybe he had paid for them . 
  you 're such a pessimist . 
  then you can put the original author in a comment . 
  what about geert wilders ? 
  how does someone do that ? 
  i do n't see how this is n't a rage comic ? 
  `` this is not a stand-in for livejournal or a place to talk about your day . 
  and you did n't do any of those 2 things !, 
  how much more do you need ? 
  i see in your post that you say 200-300usd . 
  but do n't know when you last updated . 
  i have sent some money . 
  when i heard the rule changes that caused this , i just could cry . 
  i thought that the 2008 cars where the most beautiful f1 cars since 1987 . 
  i 'm very happy to hear that you got the money .
