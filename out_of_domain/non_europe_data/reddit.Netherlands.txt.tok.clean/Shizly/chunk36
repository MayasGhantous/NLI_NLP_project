  i will look for it when i 'm on my pc . 
  i 've edited my original comment . 
  i played it a couple times , but had the problem that the prisoners just kept coming . 
  is there already a way to stop that ? 
  it happens everywhere . 
  we have other people for that . 
  haile gebrselassie has the world record on the 10 mile with 44.53 . 
  without training 1.40.00 would be a realistic time . 
  it 's a whiteboard , it does n't have a name . 
  how do you coop with missing a training ? 
  i just finished a 8 week/3 days schedule and want to go to a 5 days schedule . 
  however , some weeks this would be possible , and others not . 
  if i mis a run , should i redo the week ? 
  do it the day after and just move around with the schedule , or what ? 
  for reference , i 'm talking about [ this ] ( http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/racing/rws-8-week-10k-schedule-5-days-per-week/75.html ) schedule . 
  it 's our version of the blue angles . 
  there is an orange painted f-16 and a ah-46 for demo 's . 
  thank you . 
  this was really useful for me and gave me some new insights in training schedules . 
  i do n't really understand what you 're trying to say . 
  you 're harddrive did n't work properly , so you took it to the repair guy , who trouble shooted it and said he did n't know and brook your gpu ? 
  hold your horses einstein . 
  we 're not all as smart as you . 
  wait , that was n't fake ? 
  i think the / r/metal following is pretty chill . 
  as long as you do n't mention metalcore or five finger death punch . 
  the only problem i really have with it is that there is n't really a difference between / r/metal and / r/headbangtothis . 
  / rmetal is mostly video 's . 
  let 's be honest here . 
  anyone here who would actually try it would die . 
  it has a reason it took so long to explore some area 's . 
  that said , there is still a lot to discover . 
  we do n't know nearly enough about the caves in the world . 
  you could explore those . 
  and yes , it would be dangerous . 
  it has a reason it has n't been explored before . 
  threatening anybody is a crime . 
  since i would not use the wd drive for my most used programs , games and the os and would only put bulk ( school documents , pictures , downloads , ... ) on the drive , i gave soundproduction a higher priority than i would otherwise . 
  i used the results from [ this ] ( http://nl.hardware.info/reviews/3504/25-35-inch-harde-schijven-review-strijd-om-de-terabytes ! ), 
  review and [ this ] ( http://tweakers.net/productreview/45242/western-digital-green-wd20earx-2tb.html ) user review ( both dutch ) . 
  it showed me that the wd green was a very quite drive ( < 30db when active ) and still decent performances , for a good price . 
  i wanted a ( semi - ) modulair , + / - 600w psu . 
  that 's why i choose this psu . 
  after your tip i searched for xfx and the only ones i could find that matched my demands was the [ xfx pro 650w xxx ] ( http://www.4allshop.nl/p1-650x-xxb9 ) for 30eur more . 
  i 'm going to look into the 760 , will comment on that later to / u/jakewjf2 . 
  i 've tried a mechanicalkeyboard and looked into it . 
  i decided that i understood the reasons that people would want a mckb , but that it just was n't for me . 
  i 'm still not sure what i really want for a keyboard . 
  that 's why i choose a board that had good reviews and still is cheap , so that when i figure it out i could buy an other one . 
  and thanks for the mousesub . 
  i currently have a trust mi-7770c which is n't that good . 
  it 's fine for mindless browsing , but it 's a little small . 
  do you maybe have any other place to start looking for a new mouse ? 
  i 'm non-us , so online deals are not really worth it for me . 
  the cheapest hd 7970 i could get would be around the 320eur . 
  i took your tip and searched for a couple reviews , and the gtx 760 would be a better choose for me ( slightly cheaper , slightly better ) . 
  i was thinking about getting the [ msi n760 tf 2gd5/oc ] ( http://azerty.nl/producten/product_detail/5644/631070/msi-n760-2gd5-oc-grafische-kaart-geforce-gtx-760-2-gb-gddr5-pci-express-3-0-x16-2-x-dvi-hdmi-displayport.html?channel_code=40&amp;product_code=77466750 ) . 
  the only-eu brand that i know of would be club3d ( the one i chosen first ) and palit . 
  the first one being a good competitor to the other brands , the second one being a nvidea-only brand ( do n't know about there quality ) . 
  and then it will be the msi gpu . 
  thanks for the tip on the psu ( and using tweakers.net ) , i 'm going to look into him . 
  i have n't tried a full scale keyboard , but i have the test-packet posted on / r/mechanicalkeyboards . 
  i 've noted that the browns felt the best , but it just felt not so smoothly . 
  plus that my upper limited for a keyboard would be 70-75usd . 
  i just like to rest my hand on the mouse when using it , not applying much pressure . 
  my hand is a little on the backside of the mouse , like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qy32sbo.jpg ) ( picture for impression , normally i 'm putting my thumb in the right spot ) . 
  there 's still some space between the palm of my hand and the mouse . 
  i do n't know it that 's how it 's `` supposed '' to be used , but that 's how i 'm using my current mouse . 
  yes , they do . 
  is n't reddit an international site ? 
  i see comments like these all the time . 
  no , i did n't learn about lincoln/washington/cia / nasa / ... in grade school . 
  i understand your confusion . 
  i 'm dutch , but since this is an us based site ( and assume you 're too ) i tend to switch between eu and usd . 
  thanks for both the tips , i will also look into those . 
  i know that the local electronic store has both those mice , so i 'm going to test them there . 
  it 's not only merchandising . 
  i think that , for the smaller teams , they almost do n't make any money with that . 
  / u/xjagerx made a huge comment about the concorde agreement , the agreement between the fia , fota and foa that regulates the financial aspect . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1j1va8/poll_reverse_place_constructor_ad_revenue_award/ ) to the post . 
  it should give you a good view of how the money business in f1 works . 
  clip : [ link ] ( http://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=375534184 ), 
  of course . 
  you need a warrant for that . 
  dad . 
  it says it right there , in the screenshot . 
  i 'm going for my first build and i 'm still debating on the ssd en psu . 
  when i started picking parts the crucial m4 256gb ( 170eur ) would be my best choice . 
  has anything changed in the time or are these still the best in this price bracket ? 
  for reference , [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1j39lu/build_ready_building_a_1300eur_1400usd_gaming_pc/ ) was my [ build ready ] post .
