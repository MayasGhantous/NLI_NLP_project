  since these projects are projects created by the municipality this last requirement is very important . 
  and if you had an addiction before and an other treatment worked on you that time , you ca n't take part in the program . 
  so you meet the requirements , good for you ( or not ) !, 
  will that mean that you can take part in the program ? 
  you need to go the treatment center 3 times a day . 
  if you 're willing to do that , you will be investigated by the centrale commisie behandeling hero\u00efneverslaafden ( central commission treatment heroine addiction , ccbh ) . 
  those will investigate if the treatment will work on you . 
  if they give a positive advice , you have a couple weeks to pull out of the program before you start it . 
  now you need to go the center 3 times a day to get you shot and be mentored by your mentor and social worker . 
  you will have lunch together , while the social worker helps you getting a job at the job center that 's located in the facility . 
  in the meantime you can work out at the sporting facilities . 
  if you want more information , just ask . 
  peter blanken also did his promotion on the university of amsterdam on this subject , [ link ] ( http://dare.uva.nl/document/207365 ) . 
  hahahaha !, 
  i assume that the debate is about the current hp universe . 
  otherwise : nuke those robe wearing magicians of the planet . 
  thank you so much !, 
  i never could figure out why i could n't click the install button of api 's . 
  how would you even figure out twilight was the problem . . 
  for reference : see the second post on / r/f1circlejerk . 
  use the search function and search on `` american '' in the title and you will be fine  . 
  we also have `` wednesdays at bernies '' which it our weekly `` ask anything '' threat . 
  well , it is a circlejerk subreddit . 
  you mean a different subreddit ? 
  you do n't even now that guys contract . 
  to be fair , it 's why you 're doing it ( partly ) . 
  i want to know if i 'm wasting my time or not . 
  where do you go after you die ? 
  we also could use that land to thow it in the sea and create more useable land . 
  screw mountains , way to hard to cycle on them . 
  we build every single building on huge pillats because of this problem . 
  it is n't sinking like venice , but it is a problem . 
  where i live kreeping out streets and houses on the same level costs millions a year . 
  but how ? 
  how would it spread to 10.000 people ? 
  39 days later . 
  he asked how old that package would be . 
  this is not true . 
   `` also , on our highways are monitored with cameras scanning/collecting car license plates . '', 
  source ? 
   `` train travelling is going to be impossible without a personalised chip-card in a few years . 
  source ? 
   `` there were already plans to put kilometer registration ( with gps ) devices in every car . '', 
  and it did n't happen because of privacy concerns . 
   `` location of all phones can be monitored as they send out a signal every 6 seconds . '', 
  just like every other country in the world . 
   `` our passports are digitalised with finger prints and such '', 
  just like every other country in the world . 
  the issue was n't passports , it was id cards . 
   `` there 's camera 's on the streets without people really knowing they are being filmed all the time . '', 
  they are mostly in shopping and nightlife area 's . 
  source ? 
  wait , `` he wants drones ( small airplanes controlled from a distance ) to spy at people at all times '' . 
  never mind , i thought you where serious . 
  the last paragraph of the article you just used as a source proves you 're wrong . 
  it says that it 's possible to be used during events where a lot of people gather ( big festivals , soccer matches , etc. 
  it 's the only example . 
  it 's talking about masses of people . 
  seeing how groups react . 
  i know who opstelten is . 
  and that 's the future use , not the past . 
  please provide a source that says your right and not that you are wrong . 
  when did that happen ? 
  i know he mist a race because of that , but the next race he already was back on the track with an other sponsor . 
  does n't make it justified . 
  i could n't find any subtitles , but for those who speak dutch : [ here ] ( http://www.een.be/programmas/koppen-xl/kom-mij-maar-halen ) is the video . 
  what 's the problem ( exept the original picture in the post ) ? 
  i do n't know how most of the people of the bands i like look like . 
  how much did the course cost you ? 
  i looked into it but remember it being really expensive . 
  no , i do n't know their names . 
  i know their band names and that 's enough for me . 
  remembering the line ups of 50 + bands is not that easy . 
  brb , going to do my homework . 
  and can solve and answer billions of problems and questions they could n't otherwise . 
  iraq was a war , not a single battle . 
  there was a war going on at the time that killed a lot of people . 
  that is the explanation . 
  exept that zwarte pete = / = black person . 
  we live in a multicultural society and that works both ways . 
  those who do not agree with that are free to leave or do n't follow sinterklaarjournaal ( it it was n't because of this discussion you would n't even notice ) . 
  there are only a couple ( we are talking about 20 people max in a country of 16 million ) who want to ruin it for everyone . 
  edit : [ here ] ( http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/21992361/__zwarte_piet-heisa_overdreven__.html ) is a second source . 
  i would say 150 years is pretty long . 
  this would mean that the grandfather of my grandfather was already born with zwarte piet ( and maybe even his father ) . 
  that 's 5 generations !, 
  we are not parading them around . 
  they 're giving us candy when they come to our country to surprise us with gifts . 
  ooh god . 
  he is older than me !, 
  this . . 
  this has never happened before . 
  how do i ever cope with this ? 
  my dreams ... 
  it 's ... 
  it 's . . 
  literally , yes . 
  except when we see a zwart piet we think `` look , a zwarte piet '' , not `` hey , a black person '' . 
  the same is for children . 
  there are enough that ai n't scared for black people , but would shit their pants if zwarte piet asked them a question .
