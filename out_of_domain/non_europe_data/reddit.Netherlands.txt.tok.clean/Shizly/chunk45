  my main source for music is reddit . 
  i think there is simply to much music out there to really get into every single genre , even though every genre has it 's good songs/albums/artists . 
  so let me start with this : you will be overwhelmed . 
  remember that you still have a 100 years to discover new music . 
  never feel guilty about not knowing a musician , not having enough time to listen to all the music you want or not knowing as much about music you like as someone else . 
  i still make that mistake and it can really ruin the fun . 
  i mainly focus on music posted in / r/listentous , / r/listentothis , / r/metal , / r/headbangtothis . 
  i also like djs like hardwell and project one , but having only a couple albums of them is good enough for me . 
  and i also get music from the radio . 
  however , those last 2 ways for me to discovering new music is mainly for guilty pleasure music . 
  for those subreddits , i mainly use [ rplaylister ] ( http://redditplayer.phoenixforgotten.com/?r=metal+headbangtothis+listentothis+listentous ) . 
  then i use it as background music and when i hear something i really like i go to the subreddit and look into the comments , download the album , etc. 
  when i really want to do it as way of passing time i go to the subreddit of choice . 
  since / r/metal and / r/headbangtothis arre the same genre i will still use [ rplaylister ] ( http://redditplayer.phoenixforgotten.com/?r=metal+headbangtothis ) . 
  for / r/listentothis ( i do n't use '' * to us '' as much ) i go to the subreddit . 
  the mainly use radd.it for their playlist , but you need to whitelist them in your adblocker and in ghostery ( if you have those addons ) . 
  they have `` what 's your x playlist ? 
  '' , `` top 2013 '' , `` top last month '' playlists and more threats like that , what makes it really worth it to check it out . 
  ** an example of music i found through / r/listentothis ( plus a couple extra ) for last summer : [ youtube playlist ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k-jwhoue4w&amp;list=plgumlihny6xdz7bc9iiuulvfr39hjs36k ) **, 
  ** current october playlist : [ link ] ( http://radd.it/1prc7f ) **, 
  now , i understand you would n't like metal at first . 
  and i 'm not the right guy to discuss this with you . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fzbuj/i_dont_hear_any_musical_quality_in_the_screaming/cafam2z ) guy is way better at that . 
  if you do n't want to read the entire thing , just start reading from the third bullet point ( so including the third bullet point ) . 
  ** some examples of metal i like ( in no particular order , i do n't really care about the specific genre but it 's to give you an idea ) : **, 
  ** by sabaton : [ a lifetime of war ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvdbdw5bxnq ) ; [ union ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=338bvvgwwo4 ) ( there is a video with great footage , but the sound quality is n't that good ) ; [ burn your crosses ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvxzdyavhu0 ) **, 
  ** by alestorm : [ shipwrecked ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggyc0fozqhm ) ; [ you are a pirate !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5txyjlemc ) ( folk/power metal ) this is n't meant to be deep or something , it 's just fun . 
  ** [ devil driver - hold back the day ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ocrkkxhr0m ) ( grove metal ) **, 
  ** [ heidevolk - levenslot ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uptwkjh5ie4 ) ( dutch folk metal ) **, 
  ** [ steelpreacher - we want metal ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4qeemt1ll8 ) ( heavy metal ) . 
  final tip : learn to like music , even if you do n't like the lyrics . 
  for example , i really like [ deer trick - christ jesus ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hobfo6cs8ui ) and [ soulfly ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qveptkenrsu ) , which both are christian themed bands . 
  do n't let such things stop you . 
  in moderation !, 
  in / r/metal there was a [ discussion ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/metal/comments/1pjfsk/homosexuality_in_heavy_metal_quick_survey/ ) about homosexuality and political views in metal . 
  my pov was that racism should n't be tolerated . 
  but it 's up to you to decide how much you let it effect you . 
  final final tip : read the sidebar of the linked subs . 
  they provide really useful information . 
  alright , really the final tip : remember to enjoy it . 
  that is the most important thing . 
  it 's fine if you like listening to 1 song for 2 weeks and then listen for 2 weeks to 1 other song . 
  it 's your decision . 
  do what you like . 
  and if you have anything to ask , just ask . 
  i would be glad to help you . 
  my thoughts are with the family . 
  people here wo n't even help you by pointing to op more clearly \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  `` hey guys , i just did something really awesome !, 
  well , not really me . 
  me talking was irrelevent , it was the axe bodyspray that did it '' . 
  this is not true . 
  when talking about gypses people mean those living on someone 's trailer park without permission , training there kids to be criminals . 
  we tried to reason . 
  my major provided them housing . 
  they destoryed the house . 
  he gave them another , they destroyed it again . 
  we decided to enforce tax laws on them ( pretty normal if you live in a country ) , they refused . 
  the comments are about that . 
  fuck gypies . 
  what ? 
  that 's racism ? 
  maybe . 
  i do n't think it is , because it has a base . 
  they could n't do that . 
  according to researcher annemiek dul [ children are expect to bring in money and woman are les important then the ambitions of the men ] ( http://translate.google.nl/translate?sl=nl&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=nl&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.trouw.nl%2ftr%2fnl%2f4492%2fnederland%2farticle%2fdetail%2f3529220%2f2013%2f10%2f18%2fromacultuur-maakt-slachtoffers.dhtml ) . 
  this makes is very normal for the children to commit petty crimes , giving there income to their parents . 
  young woman also do n't have a choice about wanting to work in prostitution ( this research was done in theme of human trafficking ) . 
  so we should give them `` real '' jobs ? 
  i mean , it 's not like we actually give jobs other people , but let 's try . 
  what ? 
  they sent there brother after a week ? 
  only showed up every other day ? 
  your expensive equipment disappeared ? 
  that 's what happened when a couple of our local construction contractors decided to work together and provide them jobs . 
  and this is only top of the mountain . 
  sometimes they go to a local agent , who rents a house for them here , let them live here a couple of weeks , let them go back to where they came from , and collect welfare . 
  the only reason we know about this is because someone was stupid enough to go to the police when his agent did n't give him the money he `` deserved '' . 
  or let 's talk about the time we wanted them to pay taxes , but they refused . 
  we should not being accused of racism stop us from targeting this group . 
  we already target age groups when fighting crime , we should do the same for cultures . 
  i 'm not saying we should put them down , remove them from the country , or take there rights away . 
  they have a certain culture , use that . 
  but blacks also commit more crimes ? 
  that 's different . 
  here we are talking about a skin color , not a cultural choice . 
  - every older generation ever . 
  it does make some sense . 
  i have n't seen the til , but if us drivers drive 10x more miles and have 1,2 x more exidents per capita , i would say that the us was safer to drive . 
  says the guy that tells over the internet how he would punch parents that spank their children in their throat . 
  you 're idealizing the past . 
  children have always bullied others , only now with different tools . 
  and last time i checked the large school shootings were done by adults . 
  that this is not true . 
  stepping out of character here for a moment . 
  it 's stupid to pretend something like this happened to you . 
  this is a joke . 
  i do n't think it 's a funny one , but that does n't matter . 
  just do n't say it like it 's something that happened to you .
