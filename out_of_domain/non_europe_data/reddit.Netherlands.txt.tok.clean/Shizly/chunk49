  pirelli liver the exact tire the fia wants . 
  to be fair , i also took it as you being born on that day . 
  i know . 
  it 's stupid . 
  but he does n't literally means to say that we would be speaking russian ( were everyone in this threat is making fun of ) , but that we would have lived under russian rule ( what he meant ) . 
  they are next to russia . 
  it 's a pretty big and important country . 
  i know , you do n't have to convince me . 
  just think that almost every single 14-20y . o likes to think that they know much more then you and like to express that in a not so respectful way . 
  laudi was a pay driver his first year ( s ) . 
  pay drivers are the norm in motorsport and paid drivers are rare . 
  dutch here . 
  did n't think to much about it . 
  it would seem pretty weird to just have a `` 17 years later '' screen when nothing really changed . 
  does n't change anything about the fact that pay drivers are the norm . 
  the field would be pretty empty with only 18 cars . 
  and this is just f1 , in gp2 , nascar and other feeder races classes there are a lot more . 
  racing is simply to expensive to not have pay drivers . 
  the hold button on top of my itouch was stuck . 
  they refused to replace it because it had `` fall damage '' ( scratches ) at the bottom ... 
  what happened in nascar ? 
  fun facts :, 
  * 40 % of the free water management market is in dutch hands,

  * inland shipping in the netherlands accounts for 54 % of the european trade shipping, 
  `` neither man faces charges . '', 
  move along people . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jdlipwx.gif ) is probably how that fight went down . 
  i just get angry thinking about that bullshit again . 
  glad the trend of famous power users died in a very slow and painful death . 
  depends on where you live . 
  i would have failed the test . 
  you do realize that he never said you should n't shift gear ? 
  that 's not the same as driving with 1 hand . 
  you are shifting literally every single second you are driving ? 
  except you do , according to every single source online ever . 
  you are still right about the free trials/downloads , etc. 
  but you still need ps + for online gaming . 
  [ first ] ( http://uk.playstation.com/ps4/features/psplus/ ) bullet point . 
  edit :, 
  it said, 
   playstation plus is not mandatory for online, 
   people need to realize this . 
  playstation plus is merely like the `` pro '' version of an app . 
  it lets you get free trials of games , free downloads , discounts , and you get a little plus symbol next to your name . 
   you do not have to have it to play online . 
  unless there is a child rapist or something involved . 
  then reddit turns into a slaughter machine . 
  fun fact : in 2014 a law will go into effect that will let foreign company owners be arrested if they have a business in certain parts of the country . 
  everyone that has lower income is able to get `` zorgtoeslag '' . 
  how much you get depends on your income . 
  we are pretty awesome ( i may be a little biased  ) . 
  you should visit . 
  here you go :, 
  i think s4/5 should have been the last . 
  when they where talking about all the yellow , her playing bass , living with that roommate , etc. 
  the plot almost came to an end , but then they decided to add some random crap and here we are at s9 . 
  s9 is the first season i like since s4/5 . 
  to me it seems like a big movie . 
  can see why some people would n't like it , but it became a fun show again . 
  made me think , is n't there still a slap to be given to barney ? 
  noted, 
  noted, 
  how ? 
  he is a f1 driver , making it true . 
  new top bar image , anyone ? 
  it said 1 + million people died . 
  it said nothing about the liberation of any country . 
  last year i made a post on / r/wec about starting to watch wec . 
  / u/terribadusername and others gave a really good insight into how wec works and what to follow . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wec/comments/1c9n8j/getting_into_fia_wec/ ), 
  it 's not like people get laid of these days and are forced into situations like this . 
  silly lyrics . 
  or drones . 
  is he really that stupid thathe reads the name of a act , and then thinks `` that act totally does what the title said without inflicting my views '' ? 
  he says he 's against piracy and support the acts that try to block it , but he does n't support blocking piracy ? 
  would n't it be possible to have people who want to participate draw the area they are from/able to run on a map with their username ? 
  that way you would see very easy what would be possible ( especially international ) . 
  the netherlands . 
  depends on your carrier . 
  possible . 
  i live in the netherlands and 38 & seems the norm . 
  but i get cheap healthcare , extra money to spend on healthcare if i make less then xxxxx a year , almost free education , extra money when i 've kids , a lawyer when i 'm to poor to get one myself , extra money if i would be handicapped , good unemployment benefits , ... 
  it 's more then just healthcare . 
  keep running through 2014 . 
  i just started for the fourth time and if i can beat the winter i can beat anything !, 
  if you work 1600-0400 you 're tired . 
  does n't matter that you would only drive a hour . 
  where i 'm from the roads are littered with such ramps . 
  we are trained to move a lane over when we see someone or a ramp merging , unless we are going slow and merging traffic is n't that dense . 
  thank you for that . 
  out of all of them , this might be the one to make me say `` there 's a subreddit for everything '' . 
  hamilton and vettel are . 
  actually trained since a young age by a professional team is n't that new . 
  but say that rbr trains 6 youths to be on the level of f1 , rbr still has only 2 places , the others probable ca n't go to an other constructor because money/contracts . 
  that 's the rest of his sentence and his next sentence . 
  he literally said what his point was .
