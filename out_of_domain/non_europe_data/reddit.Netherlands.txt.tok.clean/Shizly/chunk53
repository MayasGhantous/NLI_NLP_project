  the . 
  how can someone even think so lightly about dead . 
  i did n't make the mistake of not counting those . 
  i read '' ** unarmed ** civilians ** killed by ** ( the actual performing of an action ) axis ** within eyesight ** '' as them being shot . 
  the entire sentence just does n't make sense . 
  `` civilians who died by axis actions : ... '' would be a lot clearer and more plausible .

  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s8l4e/meta_i_think_people_are_forgetting_what/ ) [ meta ] post on eli5 explains the best why i hate it . 
  the eli5 concept is ( was ? ), 
  completely disregarded and even made fun of . 
  i was there when he got murdered by his own community . 
  questions used to be [ why is x0 = 1 ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j8wmr/eli5_why_is_x01/ ) and [ what is fire and how does it work ? ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/j4xq2/what_is_fire_and_how_does_it_work/ ) . 
  then it became [ why does n't reddit simply hire the guy who makes reddit enhancement suite ( res ) and make those features part of reddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s4iun/eli5_why_doesnt_reddit_simply_hire_the_guy_who/ ) . 
  anwers became eliabiologymayor or eli210 . 
  i tried finding a heavenly upvoted post about how 5 y.o. 
  would n't understand it anyway and how the concept was stupid , but the comment was deleted . 
  eli5 is n't eli5 , it 's / r/answers . 
  at first we even tried to make a book out of the answers * sobsob *, 
  no they were n't . 
  so my teacher is like * so * random, 
  noticed it after maintenance on the european servers . 
  did n't have any crashes ( yet ) , but a lot of stutters . 
  fuck you dickhead !, 
  he can so what he wa ... 
  it is n't a repost . 
  it would n't even be a cross post . 
  there always would be an investigation . 
  jokes on you , he still did the 5 minutes cool down . 
  just ignore the downvotes . 
  sub just went full retard for a moment . 
  that 's not how proof works . 
  it should be proven that it 's the official topgear fb page , not the other way around . 
  otherwise i could just make / u/jclarkson and do an iama . 
  * proof ? 
  you should proof that it is n't me !, 
  if you have the means to go , do it !, 
  it 's an awesome show . 
  and it seems that they changed it a bit . 
  when i want last year the first part of the show ( or the album pics ) look different . 
  i hated jd . 
  i watched that show only for the support characters . 
  i think the best ( or top 3 ) episode is the one where the janitor locks him up in a water tower and releases him only at the end of the episode ( note that the episode in itself was really good ) . 
  naa , it 's you . 
  those where some of my favourite episodes because of how emotional and specific they were for just fry . 
  no he is n't , do n't try to make everything sound racist . 
  he is doing exactly the opposite . 
  you said that it 's the dolphins fault because if they were smart , they would have stayed away . 
  / u/trex _ luke responds by that that saying that that is a stupid thought , because otherwise you could also say that africans were dumb because they did n't stay away . 
  nowhere is any mention of africans being dumber then dolphins . 
  it implies that those africans who where enslaved ( who probably were dumber education wise , not a lot of schools in the jungle in the 18th century ) where at least as smart as the dolphins . 
  it 's not our fault that you guys flirted that open with wallonia . 
  that hurts ... 
  why ? 
  * international, 
  every mcdonald 's i know that is at a drivable road ( so not in city centers ) has a drive through . 
  do n't know about burger king/kfc , we do n't have that many of them . 
  ( the netherlands ), 
  this is not true for almost any music purchase since [ 2009 ] ( http://www.macworld.com/article/1138000/drm_faq.html ) . 
  ( [ apple link ] ( http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1711?viewlocale=en_us ) ), 
   cuz it 's slow, 
  you only need it to download once ... 
   is only 256kbps, 
  and spotify premium is 320kbps , that 's very little difference . 
   you can only put the songs on 5 devices for each account, 
  this almost was n't true anymore in 2009 and is n't true at all at the moment for music . 
   costs money ,, 
   it also takes a big cut from the artist/label . 
  wait , what ? 
  spotify slaughters artists . 
  and what is the money problem ? 
  you want to support the artists and itunes is the bad guy for providing a platform that gives the uploader 70 % of the revenue , but you do n't want to spend money ? 
  pick one . 
  if you want to support artist , buy music from them . 
  my first choice is to download a album from there website ( pretty rare ) , or a download from [ bandcamp ] ( http://bandcamp.com/ ) ( 10-15 % cut ) / [ indietorrent ] ( http://www.indietorrents.org/ ) ( no cut and almost no content , but do n't know other bc-like sites ) , or a cd from their webstore , and if that 's not possible a itunes album . 
  that 's how you can support artists . 
  not by spending as little money as possible and accuse the service you do n't use of taking to big of a cut . 
  take as an example [ this ] ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/infobeautiful2/selling_out_550.png ) infographic about how many albums/downloads/streams they need to sell before making minimum wage . 
  ( [ from here ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/11/how-musicians-really-make-money-in-one-long-graph/249267/ ) ), 
  do n't believe that source , or thinking it 's overreacting ? 
  maybe [ this ] ( http://musicbybradleyjames.wordpress.com/2012/05/07/hey-can-you-spotify-me-some-cash-an-indie-artists-perspective/ ) indie artist can change your perspective . 
  i quote :, 
   you 'll see that for 4,498 streams i earned $ 20.76 . 
  type that in your calculator and you 'll get 0.0046153846 ... 
   perspective : what that means is if i relied solely on spotify royalties to make a minimum wage income ( $ 1,160 a month at $ 7.25 / hr ) it would take 251,333 plays a month !, 
  obviously if december accurately depicts an average of monthly listens i am nowhere close to that , most artists are n't . 
  i admit i 'm not some holy man who buys all his music . 
  i pirate most of it . 
  however , i do try to buy digital form from them and give them money , not a streaming company . 
  and whenever i have money to spare i buy an album of an artist i already was listening to . 
  you must say virgin so that i can say '' * vigin '' , damned !, 
  remember your lines . 
  very lazy mod work . 
  this should not be allowed . 
  innocent till proven guilty . 
  why do you have a blue bar ? 
  can i do that too ? 
  ##### test ;, 
  awesome . 
  i do n't even get why people give him attention .
