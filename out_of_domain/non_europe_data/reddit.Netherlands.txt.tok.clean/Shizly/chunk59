  then you explained yourself by saying that you thought that he disagreed on the immigration policies . 
  how can i animate them if i 've a jail broken device ? 
  it 's a horrible sub . 
  last time i checked it was jokes about having expensive cars and discussion about how people below 21 should n't be allowed in restaurants . 
  and he was scammed by a company that pretended to employ secret shoppers . 
  do you have a source for this ? 
  as far as i know the lakes is only very limited used as fresh water source and not even classified as a strategic water supply . 
  could n't really find anything on google about it . 
  well , he is a panda . 
  do n't start expecting to much . 
  what makes you think it 's against nuclear bombing ? 
  as far as i know it are just regular bombs shelters . 
  i must disagree with that . 
  he seems to be a really down to earth guy that really has a heart for his work . 
  it happens regular that when a couple of people protest he engages in a conversation with him . 
  i disagree with his policies , but he seems to be a nice guy . 
  he arrived with 6 black hawks . 
  i could he wrong on this one , but i think they are black hawks . 
  please , explain yourself . 
  i do n't see how he sucks up to poetin and what he has to do with the nsa spying . 
  if you mean about the problems with the russian ambassador , our relationship with russia is import for trade and russia had the international law on their side . 
  if you mean the ukraine crisis , we ca n't really so anything except lobby at the eu . 
  and the nsa spying was covered up by the minister of justice ( i thought ? ), 
  and minister of defence . 
  there are a lot more people involved in ruling a country then this 1 guy . 
  even if he did , i do n't see how that reflects his personality . 
  apparently i 'm talking about his personality and you about his leadership qualities , which are different things . 
  this seems a good deal . 
  someone should post a link to the iama about that woman who woke up during surgery and was n't able to communicate with the doctors . 
  it seems to be a pretty big issue . 
  ** edit : ** found it . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1pajkl/iama_anaesthesia_awareness_survivor_ama/ ) . 
  i 'm also looking for that topic about the guy that was so fucked up he could n't get anesthesie , because there was the fear that he would die if the doctors did it . 
  the topic that mentioned his case linked me to the iama in the first place ( or the other way around ) . 
  easely 2 of the better reddit posts . 
  around 90 % ? 
  whenever i read / r/personal finance it 's something like `` invest for 1/2 in your 401 , let the rest be put in by your employe . . '' etc. 
  that is n't how things work here . 
  is it more advanced than `` keep track of your income and outcome '' ? 
  then it 's country specific . 
  i think it 's a joke about actually cutting cables . 
  when did anyone say they only watch f1 for the sound ? 
  now you 're just making up arguments . 
  i also hate the new sound , it 's part of the experience . 
  does n't mean i only watched it for the sound . 
  proven by ? 
  that only proves that he had a good car , not that he only won because he had a good car . 
  webber was n't even close to vettel performances . 
  yes , then the sound would have been different to him ... 
  i do . 
  when i 've to bend a lot my phone wo n't be in the way . 
  you 're not paying for the paper that it 's printed on . 
  very unlikely . 
  even if it was n't about his username . 
  the op asked what we thought about the transformation and he would have given his opinion . 
  the article is n't available in my country . 
  does anyone have screenshots or a mirror ? 
  what has your leaving abroad to do with anything ? 
  sounds like `` as a mother i think ... ' '' . 
  so private places ? 
  i must disagree with that . 
  just relaying on the up/down-vote system would kill subreddits . 
  see the / r/f7u12 experiment a couple years ago when they stopped moderating for a month . 
  or just in which state / r/askscience and / r/askhistorians would be without the deleting of low quality posts . 
  the biggest problem is that they did n't communicate the rule change , causing the theories of them being paid . 
  the commentator said that they did n't had them , since it was n't a practice session . 
  as far as i saw , massa was n't actively defending his position against bottas . 
  bottas was unable to overtake a non-defending opponent , that makes lap speed pretty useless . 
  so how would you call it ? 
  it 's censorship by definition . 
  it 's hiding unwanted information . 
  then what do you suggest ? 
  it 's a team sport and fines are a joke . 
  it only has been 2 races ... 
  is probably in one of the top week posts explained . 
  there are serious issues with downvoting with people that you disagree with , up to the level that people on other subs complained that they did n't want to give their view anymore on f1 . 
  because it 's harder creating the pinnacle of motorsport with restrictions . 
  it 's more impressive . 
  goed argument !, 
  what does that even mean ? 
  it is n't f1 , is it ? 
  you have to pay that back if you do n't finish your study , including the free public transport ( 92eur for every month ) . 
  and you still pay 1700-2000eur a year for college . 
  grenadine ? 
  should just be in the store at the same place the other syrups are . 
  [ karvan cevitam ] ( http://www.ah.nl/appie/producten/product/wi185822/karvan-cevitam-vruchtenlimonade-siroop-grenadine ) , [ ah basic ] ( http://www.ah.nl/appie/producten/product/wi67672/ah-basic-limonadesiroop-grenadine ) and the regular [ ah housebrand ] ( http://www.ah.nl/appie/producten/product/wi163966/ah-vruchtenlimonade-grenadine ) all have grenadine in their assortment . 
  or do you mean something else ? 
  since you mention alcohol stores . 
  at the store i worked ( and probably at every ah ) it 's in the aisle with coca cola , pepsi , ice thea , etc. 
  if you ca n't find it , you can just ask a store worker . 
  01/04/14 , the day submission were downvoted . 
  never forget . 
  it is n't . 
  his economic advisor that left the job 9 years ago said it . 
  it 's on the front page of / r/whatcouldgowrong , with context . 
  is ok , just malnourish speaking . 
  complaining about a post that 's a couple months old ? 
  really ? 
  it never was posted to / r/thenetherlands and the last time it was posted in / r/netherlands was 8 months ago . 
  photo ?
