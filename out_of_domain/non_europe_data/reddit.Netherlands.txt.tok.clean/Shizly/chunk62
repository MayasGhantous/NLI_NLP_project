  so , just like other countries would ? 
  the guy is fucked up in the head , and the lyrics support it . 
  that being said , i really like the atmosphere this song sets . 
  and i 'm basically lyrics deaf , so i 'm not bothered by them . 
  everyone also knows it was koningsdag the 26th of april , but we still have posts about it . 
  yes , `` overlords '' is also a term we accept . 
  it 's like war paint on your face . 
  it induces fear by out enemies . 
  and it 's the f16 of the demo team . 
  yes . 
  especially on days like koningsdag ( kingsday , our national holiday ) . 
  like someone else said , we have a lot `` the girl next door '' type of women . 
  i would say the opposite . 
  i 've never heard of a non-government employee caring about it or asking if you do drugs . 
  and if i look at my own circle of friends , non of the parents have really issues with it . 
  history . 
  willem van oranje ( willem orange ) is from the royal house of oranje-nassau . 
  he was basically our washington in the fight against the france ruler . 
  he was commander in the war against the france ruler and became the first king of the united kingdom of the netherlands . 
  it is n't a national sport and not that famous at all . 
  i only know that we 're that good at it because my brother is a kickboxer . 
  that being said , i do n't know how popular it is in other country . 
  you 're never that far away from a fight club here and it 's sometimes televised on one of the 10 biggest non-premium tv channels . 
  he does n't have a slave . 
  he has helpers . 
  the elves of santa clause ai n't his slaves either , are they ? 
  there where talks about that when it took belgium so long to form a government . 
  our pm stated he is positive to the idea ( as are many dutch people ) , but the initiative is with the belgiums . 
  political : the economic crisis and the population ageing . 
  our social system is under huge pressure . 
  social : the rise of racism . 
  a lot of people lose their jobs to cheap workers . 
  i do n't try to make it sound like a `` they tookourjubbss !!, 
  '' , but it 's hard not to . 
  many people get laid off as a result of it . 
  it 's also a simple fact that foreigners commit more crimes . 
  around 20 % of the population commits 40 % of the crimes . 
  i 'm not saying that it 's because it 's there heritage , but a lot of people do . 
  people get sick of living in uncertain times . 
  and zaandam , volendam , schiedam , leidschendam , ... 
  since your asking about working in the medical field , it 's probably better to make a post in / r/thenetherlands . 
  it depends on what your specialization is . 
  true , but it 's common . 
  that must me b exam . 
  i remember that i had to wear winter clothes for my c exam . 
  i 've to admit that was 10 years ago , so i do n't know if things changed . 
  edit :, 
  if you go for you c you need to wear :, 
  * swimming clothes, 
  * t-shirt , blouse of sweater with long sleeves, 
  * long pants that do n't close on the skin, 
  * rain/wind jacket with long sleeves, 
  * shoes ( plastic , leather or sport shoes are allowed , shoes without real sole are not ), 
  more '' wtf deathandtaxesmag '' . 
  it 's their article and it 's the reddit title is the same as the articles title . 
  i would like to know this to . 
  this was asked before in [ `` roman citizens were free to travel throughout the empire unimpeded , but how did they prove they were roman ? 
  did they have the equivalent of a passport ? ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/21x3fg/roman_citizens_were_free_to_travel_throughout_the/ ) '' . 
  problem is that the only answer in the treat is a april fools joke . 
  fun fact : poland lost 16-17 % of their population in the war . 
  i was kidding , it is n't a fun fact . 
  in total 65-80 million people died ( wikipedia ) . 
  according to the un department of economic and social affairs , there was a world population of 2.3 billion . 
  that makes that 3 % of the world population died . 
  or 1:32 people . 
  the votes stay the same . 
  if there are 5 upvotes and 5 downvotes , the netto is 0 . 
  the system reddit uses just changes the +5 / -5 into +16 / -16 or something . 
  triple plot twist , you can see your `` hiddin posts '' on the `` hidden '' tab on your profile . 
  i wanted to join the airforce as a pilot after finishing high school , but decide to go to university first . 
  this i did because i wanted to prepare myself better and i thought that i was n't good enough yet . 
  plus the huge budget cuts made joining the forces a big risk and i wanted to get a qualification . 
  now i 've a little more then 2 years to go before i graduate . 
  what can i do those 2 years to prepare myself for the function ? 
  i would be with the royal netherlands air force ( rnaf ) as a pilot , and it 's one of the toughest jobs to get mentally speaking . 
  blind people use reddit . 
  there have been a lot question addressed to them and there always have been answers by blind people , who use special software . 
  please , do n't say your timezone . 
  this is much more exiting . 
  why pay.reddit.com ? 
  sound like bro science to me . 
  do you maybe have more on the subject ? 
  articles , sources ? 
  who are all those guys in black clothes near the end of the video , walking towards the site ? 
  link ;, 
  did anyone see the picture ? 
  i ca n't find it anywhere . 
  * x-post, 
  see what happened to / r/netherlands . 
  we had to move the entire sub to / r/thenetherlands because a retarded kid decided to screw us over . 
  him being top mod made that easily possible . 
  there 's something wrong with reddit itself . 
  i would n't be surprised if they where top mods on those subs , which makes it impossible to remove as mod . 
  that was 2 years ago . 
  probably still happens . 
  can anyone explain why this is a/r/askhistorian question and not just / r/answers ? 
  as i read it , it 's a sole your put in your shoe . 
  if he only had keep it to the second paragraph , i would even be able to agree with him . 
  i was today at robbie william in the ziggo dome .
