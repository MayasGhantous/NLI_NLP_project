  he is actually going against op for using the first pic of his sis , which are completely unnecessary . 
  would putting flame stickers on it accomplish the same ?

  it also does n't feel like getting a blowjob , it feels like giving one . 
  there is a very low limit on it and it takes roughly 5 seconds to block your debit card . 
  what makes op think that there maybe would be terrorists in japan , since there are terrorist groups in iraq ? 
  why would that be the case ? 
  i miss the relation between the situations . 
  out of interest , do you have a picture or something from the painting ? 
  he did n't say people did n't dislike them , he said it 's a non-issue in day-to-day life . 
  it 's almost only brought up to show how racist europe would be . 
  it 's not of by 15 % on such a short distance . 
  organisers are more incompetent in actually getting to the distance then you would think . 
  how did the king react when the news came to him ? 
  they did n't sort the issue , did they ? 
  a lot of redditors definitely seem to hate wealthy people for being wealthy and not just for tax reasons . 
  they do , only not with an antenna . 
  sounds like dordrecht .

  just ask at the jumbo . 
  in our ah they 're in a different place then the other bags and they 're stocked only on weekly basis . 
  the gate did n't support the pressure and would fell over . 
  right , i forgot we stopped taking new people in prison .

  funny that this comment gets downvoted so much , while the comment wishing he was murdered gets upvoted . 
  if it 's really such a big emergency that a 10 second delay makes such a big difference , you should have called 911 . 
  he is clearly visible and it would be very easy to identify him . 
  yes . 
  looks like amsterdam . 
  except us of course !, 
  we are way smarter than that . 
  long answer short : they did n't when they should . 
  only the 15th army ( roughly 200km north of normandy ) was alarmed of a possible invasion in the next couple days by a message , the 7th ( who guarded the normandy coast ) was not alarmed of this message , rommel went to germany for his wife birthday , the higher generals and commanding officers left the front to train for and simulate a possible normandy invasion ( the irony ) , the luftwaffe 26th fighter wing was moved from the coast and only 2 fighters stayed and when the invasion did happen , the german command did n't believe it was the real invasion and many of the soldiers first thought it was false alarm . 
  long answer , used the longest day by cornelius ryan as source . 
  i 've the dutch copy , so quotes are translated to english from dutch and not a 1:1 copy . 
  i will mainly go about the first week of june and not the operations to put the german forces off , like operation fortitude . 
  rommel wrote to his wife on the 6th of may that `` their still is no sign of the english and the americans ... every day , every week . . we grow stronger . 
  i look with confidence towards the battle ... maybe it will start the 15th of may , or maybe at the end of the month '' . 
  however , in his rapport to the ob west ( oberbefehlshaber west , command of the western front ) he stated that there was a increase in messages to the france resistance and that the allies had made preparations for a invasion . 
  `` but , from pas experiences we known that this does n't necessarily mean that an invasion is about to happen '' . 
  on the 4th of june he left the front to be with his wife on her birthday , the 6th of june . 
  this , without the hq knowing . 
  only general-mayor schumndt knew about rommels trip . 
  the others at the okw thought that rommel was at the front when the invasion happened . 
  ** messages **, 
  in the morning of the 4th of june at the 15th army headquarters , more then 200km north of the normandy beaches , lieutenant-colonel meyer was tasked with the command of the only counter-espionage service at the invasion front . 
  this group of 30 men did nothing else then listening to radio messages from across the channel . 
  in the night before , the next message was received on the press telegram :, 
  `` urgent - press associated nyk flash - eisenhower hq announces allied landings in france '' . 
  first meyer waited before alarming berlin . 
  first reason for this was that there was n't any allied activity across the entire front . 
  secondly , canaris , head of the german secret service , told meyer that there where going to be hundreds of false messages to the france resistance and only a couple would be relevant to the d-day invasion . 
  he concluded that the message would be a mistake , since there was n't an invasion going on . 
  a much more important message was received the 1st of june . 
  this is the first sentence of the poem [ chanson d'automne ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chanson_d%27automne ) . 
  canaris had informed meyer that this would be the first part of a two part message . 
  the first one would be on the 1th of 15th of the month and announce that the invasion would be in the coming 2 weeks . 
  the second part ( the rest of the poem ) would announce the invasion being within the next 48 hours . 
  meyer informed the staff sergeant of the 15th army of the message who immediately gave the order the put the entire 1th army on full alert . 
  the message was sent to okw ( hitlers hq ) and meyer called ob west , army group b and von rundstedt hq . 
  and that was the end of that ... okw assumed that von rundstedt already had sounded the alarm , and von rundstedt assumed that rommel 's hq already sounded the alarm . 
  this caused that on the entire invasion coast only 1 army was on full alert . 
  the 7th , who was tasked with the normandy coast never knew . 
  on the 2th and 3th of june the first part was repeated . 
  that convinced meyer that the ap message must have been a mistake . 
  the invasion was about to happen , and his man would be ready as never before . 
  he only hoped that his superiors would be in the same state as him . 
  meanwhile , rommel prepared his trip to germany . 
  ** re-stationing of the 26th fighter wing **, 
  there where only 183 day fighter planes in france , of which 160 considered serviceable , of which 124 belong to the 26th fighter wing . 
  in the afternoon of the 4th of june , 122 of those fighters where re-stationed elsewhere and moved back from the coast ( a squadron to the north-east of france , a squadron to the rheims and the 3th squadron to the south of france ) . 
  this left the coast almost completely without any airpower . 
  only colonel priller , one of germans top aces , and his wingman stayed behind . 
  even though they where only with 2 , they did saw action during the day . 
  they made a couple low passes over the beach and shot at the allied soldiers who where trying to get of the beach , after which they flew off . 
  ** weather and false alarm **, 
  these subject are more widely known and i will skip a bit through it . 
  in the past the allied had shown that they would n't to airborne landings in bad weather . 
  guess what , it was bad weather . 
  the germans where convinced that the invasion would n't happen with such bad weather . 
  when the first troops landed , people thought it was just false alarm . 
  and when the first fights broke out , people thought this was n't the invasion and only a diversion . 
  ** round-up **, 
  the germans made mistake after mistake after mistake . 
  they had reason to think the invasion would happen in the next couple of days , but thanks to bad communication the message never came through . 
  when it did happen , the commanders that were n't at the front did n't believe it was the real invasion . 
  to put it in perspective . 
  here 's a conversation over the phone between pluskat , who was in one of the bunkers over looking the omaha beach front , and block , mayor of the 352th division :, 
  * `` block , this is the invasion . 
  i believe that there are roughly 10.000 ships coming this way . '', 
  * `` stop being an idiot , pluskat !, 
  the americans and british do n't have that many ships . 
  no country has that many ships ! '' . 
  * `` if you do n't believe me , come and look for yourself !, 
  it 's beautiful .
