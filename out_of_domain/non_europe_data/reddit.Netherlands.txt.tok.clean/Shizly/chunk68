  i ca n't describe the chaos in the first 9 hours of d-day . 
  i really recommend reading the longest day . 
  it very easy to get into and it reads a bit like a novel . 
  edit :, 
  and i was already happy that i could provide an answer that would n't be deleted . 
  edit :, 
  a sort like question was asked a couple months ago , maybe it can help you :, 
  and the book list and faq here has lots of information on different topics . 
  / r/documentaries also has lots of history orientated submissions . 
  if you know your subject or timeframe it 's really easy to search for . 
  i would n't have mind you guys loosing either . 
  have fun . 
  and a megamegalounge , and a megaloungeiv , v , vi , ... 
  goes on for a while . 
  no it is n't . 
  the image is only focused on this one girl . 
  there are a lot of books on the holocaust on the askhistorian booklist ( [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/wiki/books/holocaust ) ) . 
  there 's also a wwii section in the faq , which has some questions answered on the holocaust ( [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/wiki/wwii ) ) and about a year ago there was a ama with holocaust panelists ( [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1ao282/wednesday_ama_holocaust_panel/ ) ) . 
  / r/documentaries also has a couple documentaries on the holocaust ( [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/documentaries/search?q=holocaust&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all ) ) . 
  you just have to skip through the american ` holocausts ' . 
  the normal track , the oval , city circuits and i do n't know what he would mean with the 4th . 
  maybe 50 oval/50 normal tracks or something ? 
  which tax dollars ? 
  the 50 pound the fuel costed ? 
  even if you where right , your answer just was a shitty answer . 
  you gave no information whatsoever . 
  and other comments already explained why your wrong . 
  the situation is often much more complicated . 
  no there would n't . 
  and there should n't . 
  he attacked cops and was armed . 
  he was a danger to everyone in the area . 
  he was armed and they opened fire when he throws it . 
  he was armed with a knife and starting running to an area that was n't contained . 
  you ca n't attack a police officer and run away to a public space while armed and outrun the cops . 
  it was completely justified to shoot him . 
  they had already shot warning shots and the article said that the officers already announced that they would should him if he did n't surrender . 
  you ca n't really close a landingstrip . 
  in emergency situations , you would still be able to land . 
  and even if they were out of gas , then the plane would just act like a glider plane and would still be able to land fine . 
  as happened in real life situations where the engines died . 
  it 's hard , but not practically suicide . 
  they 're trained to land in hard conditions . 
  it would n't be a perfect landing , but it certainly would be possible . 
  the pilots still have height maps and altitude meters they can use . 
  do n't forget guide van de garde , test driver for sauber . 
  not that i think that he will ever get back in the f1 racing seat , but still . 
  i 'm really looking forward to verstappens future . 
  he 's really promising and is still very young . 
  a lot of those island actually have big issues , ai n't they ? . 
  i thought there where a couple island next to australia that still kill people for witchcraft ? 
  and islands like jamaica have huge homophobic and crime issues . 
  tell congo that . 
  there a bit of area between `` not perfect '' and prosecuting witches and murdering homo 's . 
  does n't alexa get their stats from people that installed the alexa toolbar ? 
  would n't call that to reliable . 
  welp , better do n't do any un missions anymore . 
  if you somehow partly fail your duty thanks to many reasons , the country who sent the soldiers is reliable . 
  other landing crafts ai n't submarines ? 
  even today they do n't crash with full size amphibious warfare ships on the shore but sent the troops with smaller ships . 
  valt over te discussi\u00ebren .

  edit :, 
  it 's necessary . 
  you guys seem to be forgotten why it was put into place . 
  fyi , / r/casualiama takes iama 's without proof . 
  they were like 30-50 % cheaper like 6-8 months ago . 
  that 's always the case with f1 races . 
  it 's still expensive in early pre-sell , but cheaper . 
  he is n't able to save up a 100cad ? 
  a f1 race is easily 5-10x as expensive as a dtm , wtc , wec or even motogp race . 
  so it 's expensive compared to alternative or even comparable races . 
  especially since `` think before you drive '' is a fia initiative , not some quote of bernie . 
  so , what would be accurate ? 
  is n't spa one of the most expensive races to attend if you do n't want a field ticket ? 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  i know that a dutch general said that the netherlands is more pacifist ( referring to the soldiers ) , while the france ( soldiers ) are more trigger happy . 
  it had nothing to do with the eu or anything like that , it was during the 2002 hearing about the srebrenica massacre . 
  but that 's the only thing i can find . 
  yes , and i liked it more . 
  however , it 's just to expensive . 
  you pay a monthly fee , which is fine by me . 
  and then to race in any other championship you have to pay for at least 1 car and 6 tracks , which easily totals up to 75usd . 
  and that 's for 1 championship . 
  yes , i know . 
  i mean it 's for just 1 championship class . 
  by now it 's decided that it 's impossible to make ethical arguments . 
  or he says something like, 
  `` hey mate , i do n't really know you but have something to tell . 
  monday night x slept with me without telling me about you . 
  i understand that you would n't want to believe me or something , but i at least wanted to tell you . 
  if you do something with it or not is up to you , but keep an eye out . '', 
  does n't like 40 % of those lids break open in case of a crash ? 
  we have ? 
  i 've seen a couple showers in my life , but only at some of those holiday parks like centerparks they seem to have those options . 
  and hamilton could have gone with his merc through the drive in next to the circuit before rosberg would be past him .
