  would say it 's still pretty successful . 
  last year they totalled around 26 million usd , now they got + / - 40 % of that in 3 weeks . 
  has to be in a sauna first .

  you 're joking , right ? 
  even gp3 is louder . 
  and it 's a lot louder . 
  i 'm at spa at the straight before rouge and you almost do n't hear the f1 cars before they come through the corner . 
  last year you heard them easily when you were still on the highway . 
  and 1 thing you do n't need are earplugs for the f1 . 
  corona hipster ? 
  motorcycle licenses are mostly regulated on eu level . 
  it 's for like 75 % the same in the netherlands . 
  do n't know about how the different car regulations are . 
  except point 4 the law seems nice . 
  in the netherlands parking is horrible . 
  it changes per city if you can park on the sidewalk or not . 
  but no , let 's not make laws about that ... 
  you already said kanaleneiland / commentthreat, 
  hehehe, 
  they 're required to do that by law . 
  that already was the case , but then the costs of that service was blend in . 
  `` us government ... make up rules '', 
  is n't that like , what governments do ? 
  make laws ? 
  and we elect them democratically so that we have influence on the rules they make . 
  you already got charged , only now they bill it differently . 
  why would you even lie about that ? 
  he did n't edit his comment . 
  he obviously meant on this location , not on this pile of dirt . 
  not really . 
  family on both sides could easily be 60 + total . 
  not just his direct aunt and uncle , but his great-aunt , etc. 
  then add friends , coworkers , the random people that ask for his name , government workers ... 
  i 've read the book , but this quote is n't from there . 
  this incident is mentioned , but not in in this kinda detail . 
  does anyone have the real source ? 
  what most of the comments are most of the times . 
  only know the commenter was n't anti-renault . 
  most people do know about that . 
  `` propably '' -79 - 10 minutes ago, 
  impressive . 
  no wonder we are the main import market of ze germans . 
  mammoet is abnormaal groot . 
  edit :, 
  in 2010 the distance between leader mammoet and second place company ale was 52673 tons , but in 2011 difference lowered at 40113 tons . 
  tag ? 
  get the duitser !!, 
  *** it 's vaderdag ***, 
  benelux # 4ever . 
  i also would like the guys that do n't use your backyard as battleground more . 
  there a difference beteren making a mistake and going 60 over the limit . 
  i also have gone 15 over in 40 zones , but this is retarded . 
  still busy with my license , but money . 
  getting a car would cost me as 20 y.o. 
  260 eur/month for having it stand still in the parking lot . 
  a motorcycle less them 30 eur/month . 
  a difference of 230 eur/month or roughly 2750 eur a year . 
  getting my license and buying gear is going to cost roughly 2000 eur , so i would already saved that costs in 8 months or something . 
  plus you can get a better motorcycle for a 1000 eur than a car . 
  plus lane splitting . 
  i work a lot at big events , so traffic is horrible . 
  and when i go to school i travel in the spits . 
  and all the other stuff people already said of course . 
  hear hear . 
  even though i think it is n't that bad yet , it seems that certain genres are way over represented . 
  this already was a bit the case , but now you have 2/5th being either rock or electronic . 
  and it seems that those 2/5th are the most upvoted by a large marge , making them show up even prominent . 
  i still do n't get why this sub should be a default . 
  if you even have a slight interest in music the sub is really easy to find . 
  you probably go to the default / r/music , look at the sidebar for other subs , and see / r/listentothis as one of the subs named . 
  first you had the situation that those who had an interest in music could search for this sub and subscribe . 
  now anyone who registers immediately is subscribed , before showing any interest in this sub whatsoever . 
  that does n't even make sense . 
  why would the us government make it seems that there are beheadings going on of innocent journalists thanks to their actions . 
  dan is het te snappen . 
  voor de rest vooral armchair experts en politicologen-in-spe . 
  how badly were they injured ? 
  not us , so maybe saying something stupid , but would n't they just have his license plate number ? 
  you were n't joking , [ 200 + nay , 39 yeah ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/2baw5g/meta_a_rlistentothis_referendum_were_calling_a/cj3gx21 ) . 
  the response ? 
  that we need real solutions , not running away from the problem . 
  a * real solution * is attracting people who put a bit of afford in finding lesser known music , not screaming at every new user that we 're here . 
  now every newly registered user . 
  there already is the / r/music + movies + gaming package when you register for general interest in media . 
  / r/listentothis adding to the package does n't add anything for anyone . 
  / r/music is right there !, 
   more subscribers = more music being submitted = the possibility of more undiscovered/new-to-us artists . 
  why would that be the case ? 
  we got over 750.000 subscribers extra in 3 ( ? ), 
  months . 
  non of them thought `` hey , this sub looks cool . 
  let 's subscribe and participate in it '' . 
  people who already though `` gosh , i 'd like to use reddit to listen to music '' probably already saw / r/music , read the side - and topbar and then moved to / r/listentothis . 
  and quantity = / = quality .
