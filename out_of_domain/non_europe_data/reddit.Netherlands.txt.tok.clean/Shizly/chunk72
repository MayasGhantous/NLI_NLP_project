  that 's why many creepshots subs were shot down in 2012 . 
  reddit has a history of spreading child porn and they were able to beat it down . 
  by implanting this system they would destroy their ability to do it again . 
  your comparison has no place in this discussion and it not in any way comparable to reddits situation . 
  it 's a joke , not a historical analyse of the german role in the months leading up to ww1/2 . 
  are you blind or something ? 
  you are endangering people more by threatening the robber . 
  you 're not rambo . 
  how do you imagine it would go ? 
  you might not be sick , but you could . 
  we do n't have a real shortage or anything so we do n't take risks . 
  i do n't know . 
  as i said , we have no need to take the risk . 
  howewr , they 're very specific against this disease and specifically the uk , so they have reasons to still not do it . 
  maybe it spreads in a specific way , or could you be a carrier who is n't affected . 
  edit :, 
  walls that ai n't made out of concrete ? 
  what is this , medieval times ? 
  at least do a bit self research . 
  this has been discussed before in this post . 
  is n't it , technically , owned by lamborghini , who is owned by audi ? 
  link :, 
  i think / r/askreddit still is tolerable ( especially now the `` tell me your worst work story ( nsfw !!! ) '', 
  posts died out ) and / r/movies and / r/gaming are fine if you take them for what they are . 
  / r/movies light discussion about movies and a very easy entry to movie news . 
  / r/gaming is the i-want-easy-content sub . 
  kind of a guilty pleasure . 
  how ? 
  how do you find the time to watch so many movies ? 
  what 's your schedule like ? 
  true . 
  i only have a select few games that i play often , so do n't really have that problem . 
  and when i finally play hyped games i already forgot the spoilers , 
  why would the median be used for a map like this ? 
  would n't the average be more meaningful ? 
  i know a couple days went by ( time goes hard ) , bit i still like to comment on it . 
  first of all , i still love the sub . 
  i appreciate what you guys do on voluntary basis and think that you guys have a lot of great ideas and many work out . 
  it may seem like that is n't the case since i when i comment here it 's complaining about the default status , but i really do . 
  now to the default status . 
  as you said yourself in the [ referendum ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/2baw5g/meta_a_rlistentothis_referendum_were_calling_a/cj3gx21 ) we had 200-300 new users a day . 
  that 's already a big number that many subs would be jealous on . 
  i do n't see the need to increase this number artistically . 
  getting 1 million subscribers by being a default is not a accomplishment . 
  its been 6 days since this post and we already have a solid 100k extra subscribers . 
  that 's almost halve the users we had before becoming a default . 
  there is no need for these numbers . 
  as i said , you now only get more and more people we are not interested in this sub , do n't get the difference between / r/music and / r/listentothis or would have been satisfied with the already existing / r/gaming - / r/music - / r/movies triangle . 
  and if you had even the slightest interest in music , you would go to / r/music , hover over the `` music subreddits '' / look at the sidebar and see / r/listentothis as the top sub mentioned . 
  we already were growing steadily with users who had interested in music behind / r/music . 
  about the first option you mentioned . 
  you 're saying that we are being dramatic by overstating the problem , but i think saying that there would be threads about never recovering and plumbing numbers is even a bigger overstatement . 
  you keep saying that people think that the default stating is the problem . 
  as far as i see it , many know it is n't . 
  it 's just completely unnecessary , makes the problem we already has even bigger , and has no need whatsoever . 
  in other meta threads before the default status , quality management issues were addressed and people who follow the sub even a little already know that there was a lot of planning going on in the background . 
  as far as i read , the actions that would taken to improve quality would be very visible ones ( the meltingpot , genre appreciation threads , discussing `` new releases `` rules , etc. ), 
  and i think it a little doomish to think people would n't notice you guys hard work and just shove it under '' ` it 's because we are undefaulted '' . 
  this being said . 
  i know you guys ai n't going to change it in the near future . 
  so all i can say is that i hope that you guys can pull it of . 
  btw , are we sometime going to have a [ genre appreciation thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/275apc/roundup_this_is_our_first_genre_appreciation/ ) again ? 
  if the reason would have been `` cause it was fake '' ( spoiler : it was n't ) . 
  otherwise it would have just been a lucky coincidence . 
  how it that anti-american ? 
  it 's the only time the us is painted in a bad light . 
  you could also call it pro-western propaganda , looking at the factory workers and people working until they fall asleep . 
  you 're now just looking for a message that is n't there . 
  last year someone decided to make a search function for reddit that actually worked after this question was asked . 
  he released it on his site and it did work like how you expected a normal search function to work . 
  sadly , his site went down . 
  amateur sterrenkundig is anders dan amateur voetbalcoach hoor  . 
  if you read the entire sentence , you see i said that it was n't the initial reason for deleting it . 
  it was a lucky coincidence . 
  west/oost ? 
  dus centrum ? 
  so it 's exactly the same as if the cops would come ? 
  those like 17 are horrible . 
  probably published by the white feather movement . 
  this chart is just completely wrong . 
  almost everything is priced differently . 
  this year a burger at spa was 6eur , which would be 7,80 usd . 
  this is a joke , right ? 
  2 day tickets for the dtm at zandvoort are 50 eur , motogp assen 60 eur . 
  f1 tickets are really , really expensive . 
  he should race 300km at race speed . 
  i do n't think that would qualify . 
  that 's were the yellow flags are for . 
  for pitting they already use the signs , in addition to the radio . 
  2 years ago there was an ama with a kid who had sex with his mom . 
  this happened after he broke both his arms . 
  being unable to masterbate , his mom asks a friend of her if her daughter want to do it . 
  she declines , mom decides to do it herself , ends in sex even after arms got health . 
  it 's a bus for those truck , okay . 
  do n't need to discriminate . 
  took me a second . 
  in the left circle you see that the oil is see through ( dirty ) , in the right you see that the oil is brown ( clean ) . 
  no , it is n't . 
  the motogp and dtm are huge , worldwide classes . 
  for wec are similar prices .
