  because this has a political motivation . 
  a terrorism attack is by any definition at least political motivated . 
  this is in no way different than playing the lottery . 
  they 're completely delusional . 
  edit :, 
  in other news , it 's [ just another ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/us/dead-montgomery-county-pennsylvania-shootings-sources/story?id=27606093 ) day in the us with 6 people shot and killed by a veteran that went mental . 
  if only the 14 y.o. 
  girl had a gun !, 
  which of those 3 does n't apply ? 
  there is a prize ( theoretical 1 million dollars ) , there is a change ( 1 commenter gets picked ) and a fee ( the theory is that 1 million people pay 1 dollar , so that would be a fee ) . 
  so , it 's almost impossible to get the amount . 
  anyone can play and no one has to pay . 
  i do n't see why people with pay for that . 
  you could also donate that money to a local charity and make someone that probably needs it more happy . 
  i do n't know how it works in the us , but that 's how lotteries work here . 
  you pay like 10 bucks to enter for a multi million price . 
  the lottery uses that money to pay people out , make more money with interest and donates a big chunk to charity . 
  that big chunk is 40-50 % of the revenue . 
  the `` friends lottery '' donated 50 % of their revenue ( almost 100 million euro ) to 43 charities . 
  the `` zipcode lottery '' donated more than 290 million euro to 90 charities . 
  why would you buy new jeans every year ? 
  more white trash than bmx , snowboarding , skiing , stunt flying and parachute jumping ? 
  no they do n't . 
  that one stunt is n't a space program . 
  plus they had huge support from the usaf . 
  in the documentary it 's becomes very clear that it would have been impossible without `` real '' spaceprograms . 
  what can possible make you believe that ? 
  they 're a private organization , not a non-profit . 
  red bull does support the administrative division of wings for live so that all the money raised actually goes to the research and not to organizing events or administrative costs . 
  i 've seen enough opinions on red bull to not be surprised by that opinion  . 
  are you from belgium ? 
  iirc you also have the problem in belgium that if you live in wallonia you can only vote on wallonian parties and if you live in flanders you can only vote on flanders ' parties . 
  except when you live in brussel , then it 's free for all .

  en nog staat reddit in de top 50 .

  `` maybe he has forgotten the conversation '', 
  because people totally forget conversations where they promise people 50.000 usd . 
  [ of zo . 
  that 's completely what he was saying , what a good comment !, 
  that sub gave me cancer . 
  i had the same experience years ago . 
  then they also banned my account , because i had content on it that i did n't pay for \u0ca0_\u0ca0 . 
  that 's quite the claim to make . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  that they will remove it from my account , not ban me . 
  thought that it would n't be so hard to figure that out ... sony told me to charge it back , then banned me when i did . 
  that 's what wikipedia says , yes . 
  but it does n't have any sources anywhere . 
  i also ca n't find anything about those claims on google or the wikipedia talkpage . 
  this has to be the dumbest thing i 've ever read . 
  hahahaha !, 
  why you would wish someone to get seriously ingured and maybe even permanent damage is beyond me . 
  yeah , all those 2 comments !, 
  here 's a tip : go on twitter if you like to read all the tweets of a specific person .

  following a formula and being scripted is nowhere near the same . 
  this formula is already placed since season 5/6 . 
  non of the older episodes look scripted like to nowadays . 
  the burma special being especially bad .

  his brain . 
  he addressed the question . 
  you do n't have to agree , but he did respond to what was asked . 
  that 's to show it 's oc ... 
  he is n't . 
  he 's asking insight from the community . 
  race07 is only 1 dollar on steam now . 
  it 's a bit old , but a great sim game . 
  it 's what got me into / r/simracing . 
  the fabric does n't scratch , they 're easy to find in your pockets thanks to their size and they 're easy to spot . 
  would building dike on the sea floor ( forgot the real term ) help against the rising sea level ? 
  or is that just to protect the existing dikes/dunes along the shore ?

  for me , no other christmas movie comes even close . 
  it looks dated now , but it does n't bother me .

  it 's not the biggest part of the country , but what do you expect ? 
  i think that we have beautiful parts in our country . 
  they 're not not realising that they can make a lot of money with digital releases . 
  there are many other reasons to not release movies digital that early . 
  i do n't see the problem if you only use it for steaming services . 
  they do realise that . 
  but sony is n't one guy and the company also has contract with other parties all over the world . 
  you must be fun at parties .
