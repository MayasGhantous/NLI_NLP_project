  that 's both political as religious . 
  if his reason were n't political , his reason was probably `` because the fun of it '' . 
  it would be because he was sadistic . 
  he wanted to murder those 70 people , to feel the power . 
  to know how it is to murder . 
  to see people suffer . 
  to have blood on his hands . 
  and i think that in this case , you could call someone insane . 
  everything said in this episode about scientology is true . 
  not `` south park-true '' , but it 's actually how scientology works and what they believe . 
  no they 're not . 
  it just big enough for one of those small inflatable boats the navy uses . 
  video : [ link ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38nbsdkavlq ), 
  true gamers that play with fun and understand that other gamers want the same thing . 
  some people will have fun in playing cod1 on competition level , and others will have fun with kirby 's epic farm and some browser games . 
  as long both those people have fun in what they do and can accept that the other person has fun with his type of playing , i would cal them `` true gamers '' . 
  what type of gamer i am depends on my financial situation . 
  i 'm currently out of a job , so i bought red dead redemption . 
  i 've a total playtime of 20 + hours and still did n't beat the first part of the game . 
  after that i 'm going to play dark souls and try to get into that . 
  but under normal circumstances , i buy a couple of games that get my attention but will not finish ( killzone 2 , resistance 2 ) . 
  i buy a couple games that suck , but i just get overexcited about the game and make a instant buy ( shaun white snowboarding , turok , pain ) . 
  then i buy games that really suck me in . 
  the mass effect series , assassin 's creed series , gta iv , gt5 . 
  i love those games with my whole heart and still play them very regularly . 
  but i will never sell one of my games . 
  it 's a ** collection ** . 
  i bought every game with a reason , and that makes that i have a game collection . 
  people that blame games for rising violence and murders . 
  especially when it 's a so called `` expert '' on a news show . 
  i will become physically aggressive when someone insults me or the media in that kind of way . 
  i think [ / r/answers ] ( / r/answers ) or [ / r/iwanttolearn ] ( / r/iwanttolearn ) are better subreddits to ask this . 
  also , look at [ / r/homebrewing ] ( / r/homebrewing ) and [ / r/beerporn ] ( / r/beerporn ) . 
  edit :, 
  fixed broken links . 
  i would partly disagree with you . 
  yes , it 's to get simple answers . 
  but answers on complicated subjects . 
  of course , that 's still a little complicated . 
  we would hit a lot of sides with [ / r/askscience ] ( / r/askscience ) . 
  but i think a question like `` why are pixels rgb , when ryb are the primairi colors '' would fit the description i just gave . 
  it 's a complicated subject that has a possibility to be hard explainable in `` adult language '', 
  but as far i see , this question even is n't a elx but a iwtl . 
  he wants to learn about different kinds of beer and what the differences are . 
  this has nothing to do with religion . 
  it 's about money , power and a being `` superior '' race . 
  i mis your point ? 
  i 'd rather watch my country be burned to the ground than live 1 day on my knees . 
  so how should i brush my teeth ? 
  i brush around the 5 minutes , but the dentists keep bitchen about me not brushing good enough . 
  `` ey guys , freddie wants to let you guys know the party is cancelled '', 
  `` awwwh , to bad . '', 
  not to me . 
  sounds just like a funny joke with people that overreact . 
  i 'm a american , and i 'm sick of people saying america is `` the stupidest country in the world '' . 
  personally , i think europe is the stupidest country in the world . 
  that 's the joke . 
  it will inform people . 
  that 's what they 're trying to do . 
  no one feels the need to tell why this guy is downvoted ? 
  now i do n't know or it 's because he says that fc1 is better than hl1 ( in his opinion ) , or because he said something wrong , or because i-don ` t-know-why . 
  and when are you going to tell us the story ? 
  at least they did 1 full term and 1 almost full term ( they had 15 days to go ) . 
  since paars there was n't a single coalition that stayed together for a full term . 
  unless they would get 76 seats , that \u00b4 s not going to happen . 
  if sp becomes the largest party , then they are probably going in a coalition with pvda+d 66 ( + gl ) . 
  they would not allow that . 
  and i think we would have for the first time in 10 years a stable government . 
  they agree on a lot of points . 
  they agree on a lot of points in health care , development aid , stop working on the jsf , legalizing soft drugs . 
  the most differences are in economics . 
  sp wants lower taxes for the poor , higher for the rich . 
  d66 wants only lower taxes for the poor . 
  sp wants the aow at 65 , d66 wants aow at 67 ( in 2022 ) . 
  they actually had a lot of good points . 
  i remember that last time i agreed with them on the most points . 
  i rather keep my stufi , so i 'm not going to vote vvd . 
  i think he 's looking for a coalition between d66 , gl , pvda and sp . 
  like the demon child of a democrat and republican , with child support paid by mossad . 
  seriously , where are people getting this footage from ? 
  formula1.com ? 
  or are they just cutting this out the sky stream or something ? 
  would n't the slipstream of the truck in front of you save a lot more energy ten bypassing the truck to keep tour speed ? 
  i would say that especially trucks have a huge advantage with slipstream , because they are basically driving windscreens . 
  does it make me want to start a manslaughter ? 
  or is it more then just bad stuff ? 
  your username scares me . 
  a lot of people died . 
  seems obvious , but i 'm talking about the average persons . 
  my grandfather ( 11-16 ) saw a lot of his friends die during the german occupation . 
  he worked at a farm , and a german plane crashed into the fields . 
  some of his friends went to the field , but got shot cause they broke the curfew . 
  also , the hongerwinter . 
  we live in a village below the rijn , and my grandfather worked together with some farmers to transport food to the north on homemade rafts . 
  our village also got bombed ( no mass bombing , but since it was a small village it was very easy to just blow the village away with only a couple of planes ) . 
  and during the liberation , a lot of canadian cavalry used our bridge to go to the north . 
  a thousand times this . 
  please , for the love of god : do n't listen to the people that tell you to let her make public apologize . 
  that 's just a horrible idea . 
  you could ad volunteering with elderly to learn her about respect .
