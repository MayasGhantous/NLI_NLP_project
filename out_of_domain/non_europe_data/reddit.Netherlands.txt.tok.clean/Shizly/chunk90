  he could be some random behind-the-scenes tech guy . 
  around 70 countries ( partly ) use dst . 
  still 1/3th of the world . 
  plus that sauber did n't really tell their 2 current drivers about the case . 
  when vdg wins , the one who loses his seat will also sue . 
  i think more . 
  that seat could have put him in the spotlight by an other team , increasing his changes of a future pilot job in f1 . 
  in the same category : whenever there is a reload , ab is back where i was a couple swipes ago . 
  say i went from / r/askreddit to / r/running and open a comment there , i 'll be back at / r/askreddit when i reopen the app . 
  look at the map in earth . 
  that are a lot of boots waiting there !, 
  `` he paniced '' does n't make him at fault at all , not even partly . 
  he is n't the one that decided to cut in front of an other road user , the pedestrian did that . 
  never be surprised by corporate stupidity . 
  no , it is n't . 
  this is one of the dumbest petitions i 've ever seen . 
  does anyone seriously belief that this will change shit ? 
  what 's even more dumb , is that he started the petition under the name `` fawkes '' . 
  seriously ? 
  no one can take something like that serious . 
  one does n't exclude the other . 
  why ? 
  you miss seeing screencaps with some text on it about a scene we all have seen ? 
  no , fuck off . 
  at least pretend to wait to the full announcement you 'll get tomorrow . 
  contracts do n't change when you cross a border . 
  do n't even bother going against the pro-jeremy circlejerk . 
  they see him as an immortal god . 
  it 's like they 're part of a sect . 
  the article is a couple days old . 
  since it turned out that many people do n't know what happened to sutil and this is n't as widely reported as the vdg case , i still decided to post it . 
  if anyone has a problem with that , just say so . 
  which is his first tweet since november . 
  you do n't have to pay for the f1 site . 
  sixth gear it is !, 
  jup , this is right . 
  i 've heard rumours that there are laws that say you ca n't start punching people ( how ridiculous ! ) . 
  if he punched someone , he would have broken that law . 
  the producer should press charges if clarkson actually did hit him . 
  no they do n't , what a fucking stupid title . 
  who learned you to read ? 
  it 's an opinion/blog piece , not an official statement of the guardian . 
  it evens says `` with jeremy clarkson suspended , ** here 's my vision ** for an eco-feminist top gear '', 
  but he 's funny , so it 's totally cool if he punches someone guys !, 
  yes , obviously it 's okay to break the law and punch people if you 're hungry . 
  seriously , what are you trying to accomplish ? 
  except that he would have committed a crime , which should be settled in court . 
  how should we know ? 
  ask amazon , they can give you an actual answer instead of a guess . 
  because the bbc suspended a presenter that 's accused of punching someone and is doing an investigation to come with a accurate statement ? 
  yeah , remember that . 
  they mean something else with technical analyse . 
  wish i could say what they meant exactly , but i 'm unable to find the list with premium features . 
  what ? 
  are you making a joke or something ? 
  that incident alone was the pushing force behind the virtual safety car . 
  where did you read that teams do not agree with him ? 
  i ' have n't seen a single team respond to the case , let alone not agreeing with vdg and siding with sauber . 
  or just download the 2008 season . 
  that 's exactly what they are doing . 
  jeremy is n't being punished , he 's put on a hold . 
  you do n't believe that this would be his punishment if it turned out that he actually did punch a producer over some foods , do you ? 
  that 's because it 's the 4th time that it 's posted . 
  yes , because it 's totally fine . 
  did n't you know that clarkson can do whatever he wants to do without any consequences ? 
  the engine was striped from a car they used in an early season . 
  they had an episode where they used a v12 as a blender , that 's that engine . 
  no , it is n't being punished . 
  if you are accused of punching your secretary , it 's completely reasonable to be suspended until they figure things out . 
  that 's not a punishment . 
  especially when you keep getting paid . 
  yeah , because it 's true ( well , not centuries of course ) . 
  not because we ca n't do it , but because we wo n't do it for financial reason . 
  because there is only 1 type of suspension of course . 
  he is being not punished . 
  how do you know ? 
  the live blog stated that his lawyer showed his super license in court after sauber accused him of not having one . 
  edit :, 
  it seems you are right . 
  wonder how fast he could get one . 
  so was marussia , yet we will see them in australia . 
   ** direct new lawsuit van der garde against monisha kaltenborn and sauber **, 
   the sauber-gate does n't seem to be over just yet . 
  it keeps waiting on how and if sauber will cooperate with the verdict . 
  after the verdict a little hour ago , the lawyers of guido van der garde announced that a new lawsuit against sauber will be filed . 
   they do this against sauber and kaltenborn personally . 
  even though it 's the last thing men wants to do , could monisha kaltenborn be arrested and jailed . 
  tweets mentioned in the article , grouped :, 
  ** from adam cooper : **, 
   1 ) the new action from @gvandergarde names monisha kaltenborn personally in addition to the team . 
  a ` freezing order ' and contempt mentioned, 
   2 ) ' @gvandergarde 's lawyer talking of `` potential sequestration of @sauber 's assets and committal of its directors '' if team does n't comply, 
   3 ) ' @gvandergarde lawyer refers to press release yesterday in which m kaltenborn raised safety concerns, 
   4 ) vdg lawyer : kaltenborn statement `` was clearly calculated to make it more difficult for our client to participate '', 
   5 ) re monisha kaltenborn @gvandergarde lawyer mentions prison - but acknowledges that it would be a last resort . . 
   6 ) ' @gvandergarde lawyer requesting full list of @sauberf1team 's assets in australia as a first step to potential sequestration, 
   7 ) and justice croft agrees and asks @sauberf1team to provide list of assets , ie the equipment that 's here in the paddock, 
   8 ) court proceedings will continue tomorrow at 1030am , ie two hours before practice starts . 
  and so the saga continues ...
