  i mean so dog tag thingy . 
  it 's an example . 
  a part of the theta protocol was to assemble the avengers . 
  you do n't need a 100 beds for 10 guys . 
  i theorise that the 100 beds is to make the avengers a fully operational unit . 
  in the comics the avengers are also an unit of around 100 powered people that work in shifts for the team ( or so i heard ) . 
  so you do agree . 
  instead of being open about it with his/her spouse and trying to change the situation ( by bettering it or by getting out ) , s/he makes the decision to cheat . 
  it does . 
  questions addressed to the blind are pretty frequent here and they also get answered . 
  how original of you . 
  it would be much more efficient if a guy who read it would directly refer to it then that everyone should look it up again . 
  now you feel how it is the be us for every release ever !, 
  fox news is er niks bij . 
  it means that watching f1 races does n't make you a f1 driver in a closed circuit , so do pretend to be one when you go on the road . 
  they stop counting upvotes . 
  there are posts that got over 12.000 upvotes and in the mater of minutes drop back to around 5.000 upvotes . 
  you 'll almost never see a post with more then 5.000 upvotes , but that is n't because there are no posts with actually more then that . 
  yes . 
  like calling out some lady who said she got beaten up because some doctors friend said the blue i looked weird !, 
  never meant that there was a court case between her and the suspect and was reported in the means , that does n't matter ... 
  that sub is horrible at detecting bullshit . 
  they were n't fleeing from socialism itself . 
  the traps are on the eastern side . 
  guardians of the galaxy is on netflix here . 
  no one forgot about it , that 's simply not true . 
  plus it 's pretty ignorant to completely ignore the situation in the ussr . 
  it 's not even 30 years ago , let alone close to a lifetime . 
  the boy in the striped pyjama 's en unsere m\u00fctter , unsere v\u00e4ter staan ook op netflix . 
  spoiler :, 
  well , she died because of it at the age of 21 , weighting 40kg at 172cm tall . 
  so yea . 
  same could be said for the u.s. 
  you 're dumb as fuck if you do n't know that . 
  you 'll blind people when you shine a laser into their eyes , no one has to be learned that in school . 
  yet he got shoot by a regular police officer . 
  and is n't fort hood also in texas ? 
  congratulations on intervening in that . 
  does n't change anything about the first guy being taken out . 
  last year there where 20 shootings with more then 4 casualties in texas alone ( and a total of 280-300 in the u.s. ) so again , congratulations . 
  you guys sure show the rest of the world how to deal with violent threats . 
  maybe something like `` gun shot wounds '' . 
  yes , because people do n't develop at all between 15 and 60 . 
  - on the side somewhere or something . 
  there is no reason for them to be in this picture, 
  - he was a german , people probably knew he was at the site . 
  - they do n't have to be civi 's . 
  they could be party members watching , could be priests ore something, 
  - yes,

   you can drive long before you reach the age of majority in most places, 
  as a sidenote : assuming you 're speaking about worldwide , this is not the case . 
  see [ here ] ( http://www.visart.io/is-that-legal-a-breakdown-of-culture-through-data-and-age-limits/drivingage/ ) a map with at which age you can get your license and be able to drive unsupervised . 
  note : the data used seems to come from [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_minimum_driving_age ) wikipedia article . 
  the light yellow countries are n't featured on the list . 
  no , she definitely started it . 
  they could negotiate for weeks , but she decided to end it when gonzales told her what his position on the matter was . 
  she did n't even say to him that she thought it was n't a good idea and does n't want that !, 
  no worries , they 'll end on a cliffhanger that will keep us bite our nails until s3 . 
  no , but they could set up future talks or at least try to . 
  there are hundreds of ways to deal with it . 
  gonzalez did n't put out his final offer , it 's the only thing he said directly about the subject . 
  he said what his position was and then got murdered . 
  the last part is n't true . 
  plus , she did n't even attempt to discuss it . 
  it was a murder in cold blood so she could start a war . 
  she did n't try to save her people , she immediately went to war . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  if that truly was the only option , she did n't have to put up that act of her . 
  zoals al zei is hier al meerdere malen over gediscusseerd ( [ 1 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/344q96/monarchie_of_republiek/ ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/2s29z0/discussie_republiek/ ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/290eel/zijn_de_nederlandse_redditors_voor_of/ ) ) . 
  it seems a bit random where you can watch it from . 
  you ca n't watch it from germany , uk , usa ( which all 3 have full coverage ) , the netherlands and belgium ( both only have highlights ) . 
  it does work if you use norway . 
  no , we do n't know that . 
  and if we do n't know that , the inhumans certainly do n't . 
  we were n't arguing about the index being a good idea or not , so i do n't see the point you 're trying to make . 
  please , quote where i said that . 
  i only said that they did n't even attempt negotiation . 
  shield came to negotiate and make their position on the matter clear . 
  jiaying did n't say that she does n't want it , she did n't say why she does n't want it , she did n't say how she sees the future , she did n't say how . 
  she did n't try to do anything . 
  gonzalez came in , clarified shield 's position and got murdered without any explanation . 
  she could have told her position on the matter and , well , i do n't know , * negotiated * ? 
  but no , instead of trying to find a peaceful solution starting a full scale war based on the lie that shield started it is somehow a better idea . 
  and i say ** there was a change of negotiating ** . 
  and even assuming there was n't , jiaying would n't know that . 
  the only way she could now that is trough riana , which she does n't trust anymore , or sky , who would want peace talks and promote negotiation . 
  there are many , many more options . 
  i do n't know what to make of it that it seems impossible to you to find ground between 2 extremes , so i wo n't even bother . 
  no , it shows that i know to not waste my time on stubborn people that do n't have the ability to think for themselves . 
  indexing people 's religion was done way before nazi-germany . 
  and being on a list does n't even compare to getting inhuman 4829 or something tattooed on you an having to where a warning symbol for everyone to see . 
  it 's not about shield knowing that , it 's about the other inhumans knowing that . 
  she did it to rally support for a war . 
  nederland . 
  it 's forbidden by 137c and 137e , it falls under discrimination . 
  this is decided by the hoge raad in a court case in the 90 's . 
  there 's probably a timer at the start/finish line . 
  you can drive this in gta5 . 
  only problem is the height , which makes you collide with highway signs .
