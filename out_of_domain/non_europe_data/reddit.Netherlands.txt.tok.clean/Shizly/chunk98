  they once had dutch in their weekly featured language . 
  he got attacked by mach when he was under influence , so i doubt that the kree blood as any effect on that . 
  iirc the mist itself is n't dangerous , it 's touching the diviner . 
  trip died when he got pierced , the hydra grenades use parts of the diviner , skye 's mother goes in a lengthy story about how they created a crystal them self , but the crystal contained diviner splinters , etc. 
  on the right side of the map ( almost at the shore line ) there is a mining grove , there are a couple parked there . 
  spanish f1 presentator and years of pr experience ( 1 year as the head of hrt ) . 
  short question where i ca n't find an definitive answer for :, 
  what if you combine special forces with support troops ? 
  i heard people say that if you combine them you nullify the advance of the special forces , but i also see people advising special forces + support . 
  does this mean that when you combine regular forces with special forces ( expl : 3 mtn + 1 inf ) you nullify the advantage and when you combine support with special forces ( expl : 3 mtn + art ) you do n't ? 
  edit :, 
  somehow used wrong examples , fixed it . 
  been a month , but you did help me eventually . 
  i installed dlc for dlc , solve all the problems when they came along . 
  no , since he does n't get punished . 
  in my opinion even a life sentence is n't even close to heavy enough . 
  those people should n't even exist , but sentencing to dead is the easy way out . 
  i believe that they should suffer for the rest of their live, 
  yes , that 's revenge . 
  but their crimes are so ungodly that they should never walk on the streets again . 
  they are to dangerous . 
  as / u/blogem says , people like that will never function in a society without endangering it . 
  i know that i do n't give them another change . 
  the people who do know a lot about the case ( hint : the om and the judge ) also think that . 
  but nice try . 
  good try , . 
  you just repeated my argument . 
  but thanks for pretending you made it up , i 'm flattered . 
  and it 's hitler , typing error nazi . 
  but funny to see you try to undermine me by pointing out typing errors . 
  and i think that shooting with an automatic weapon in a neighbourhood is barbaric . 
  barbaric enough to never get out of prison . 
  if there was a dutch on the english throne and there was an alliance between the dutch and anglo , why was there a 4th anglo-dutch war ? 
  how did the english react to the french occupation of he netherlands ? 
  you seem to be completely wrong on that matter . 
  i also do n't see why a left liberal would be in support of this . 
  and i also never see people advocate lower sentences . 
  thanks for the great answer !, 
  first i theorised that when you use it with normal troops the game uses the worst number , and when you use it with support it ignores the support stats . 
  this is something i can work with . 
  he never said it was his content . 
  i do n't see any problem with it . 
  europe is bigger in square miles . 
  once again , glorious / r/yurop is the victor !, 
  i would recommend first playing one or two games before you watch a guide or play through . 
  just explore the menus a bit and screw around . 
  it will make understanding what 's explained to you in the guides much , much easier . 
  there are two yt users who put out great guides . 
  broschek made a basic guide ( http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl177cf59636f80bd7 ) with all the basics ( what is diplomacy , what are techs , how do you control the military ) explained . 
  alexlifeson made a more in depth guide ( http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plu_cbwbxcs740xvgsabdrvyzrywuqydy - ) . 
  it leaves the diplomacy/tech / ... tabs largely behind and focus ' itself on how to composite , maintain , organise and use your units . 
  i would say that broscheks guide is optional and alex 's guide is vital . 
  broscheks is n't kidding when he said `` basic guide '' . 
  but that 's just what i think . 
  a good lets play user is marco antonio . 
  he can get really creative with what he does . 
  last he finished playing as tibet and now he 's playing with ethiopia . 
  how i is it was first play as germany to familiarise myself with the interface ( as germany you have a lot of control and gaming options , which is a plus ) . 
  then i watched the guides and then i started playing as republic spain . 
  you 'll get straight into a war and when you win and increase portugal 's threat enough you can start a war to annex them ( ir they supported the nationalist with military and diplomatic support , so they deserve it ) . 
  if you play as rs , remember that you 'll lose 50-55 % of your army to the nationalist . 
  it 's easy to defeat ns when you remember to use your fleet ( let you figure out how  ) . 
  something that is n't really that important on first play , but took me really long to figure out : you win a war with an independent nation when you have occupied more victory points ( important locations , like vichy ) then the other has national unity . 
  if the nu of portugal is 50 % , they 'll surrender when you have 50 % + of their vp . 
  never said it was n't  . 
  / u/allochthomas is scheikundedocent i.o. 
  en scheikunde examentrainer . 
  flags are officially displayed in order of the french alphabet , which is the case here . 
  it seems to be a coincidence . 
  that said , they also liberated the island of texel and unarmed the german soldiers still fighting there . 
  on the 20th of may . 
  2 weeks after germany already surrendered . 
  his story probable is n't true . 
  i ca n't imagine anything that comes even close to that happening . 
  je punt is ? 
  glove and boots ftw !, 
  the left one is his sister victoria . 
  she was 13/14 y.o. 
  then . 
  you do n't represent the community . 
  that 's a possibility . 
  what i most of the time do is sending a small force south to engage them . 
  then i reroute a route to transport ships and launch an attack on the north-west from the east . 
  the troops i sent to the ships invade a port on the north and attack the nationalist from the other side . 
  since the nationalist force will mostly be with fighting with your eastern force , the western coastline will be mostly undefended . 
  this makes taking their capitals ( first is there , second one will be in the same area ) a walk in the park . 
  how does being anti-birth control while also being anti-abortion and opposing gay marriage make the world a better place exactly ? 
  the mistake is looking away .

  you 're not on ss/sl for 2 years . 
  it 's very clear that 's only a beginners program . 
  it 's not that uncommon for people to want to actually be challenged . 
  no , for some reason mods love being a default . 
  it gives bragging rights on how much you grow .
