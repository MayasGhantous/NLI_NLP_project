  and do n't forget the `` woho !, 
  we just got our [ big , round number ] subscriber ! '', 
  parties . 
  most good subs that became a default have that problem . 
  the photographer did help . 
  and i would like to see you make a sprint to someone who 's getting shot at . 
  it almost seems that different people have different opinions . 
  and that you can have different styles indifferent pictures , depending on your clothes and how you act . 
  who would have thought !, 
  it would be a circlejerk if everyone had the same opinion . 
  you just said that was n't the case and that people keep having different opinions . 
  so thanks for arguing with yourself , saves me the trouble . 
  and you do believe random redditors ? 
  according to your fiends cousin , he did n't do that . 
  interview with him :, 
  was this the 40 's or something ? 
  i really , really doubt this . 
   20 lbs of muscle and 6 inches in height, 
  do you believe that yourself ? 
   as big , as fat and as healthy, 
  whut ? 
  of [ m\u00f6nchen-glubla ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld_oyxcfaro ), 
  the pharmacies still get paid . 
  at least pretend you know how social medical care works , now you just look retarded . 
  they 're made to protect you head when you hit the ground going 80 . 
  you can deal massive blows without feeling a thing . 
  no , this was attempted murder . 
  there is no way the motorcyclist would made it out alive if he did n't dodge the car . 
  stupedly endangering yourself vs attempted manslaughter/murder, 
  there are less weed users in the netherlands then in the us . 
  no one expects you to be fluent in dutch , but there is no reason to not have some basic knowledge . 
  [ duolingo ] ( https://en.duolingo.com/course/nl-nl/en/learn-dutch-online ) has a dutch learning course . 
  it 's forbidden , but tolerated . 
  you are allowed to park scooters in the same way you park bicycles , so you can park them on the sidewalk . 
  see [ here ] ( http://www.motoport.nl/on-the-road-tips-adviezen-en-leuke-reisverhalen/blogs/tips/advies/parkeren-mag-dat-overal ) an article from motoport about it . 
  thank god you 're not a team principal . 
  you put the guy who can be the best in the seat , not the one that 's currently the best . 
  look at kimi for example . 
  how he is now , is how good he is . 
  he does n't have any growing potential and wo n't become faster . 
  for sainz this is less of a issue , but it is an issue . 
  it took him 6 year of training to get where he is , while someone with only 2 year of training can seriously battle him . 
  got it . 
  oke , super cool verhaal . 
  it 's an us soldier . 
  it 's easier to relate to your own countries citizens . 
  was . 
  i do n't see how this is possible . 
  in the 90s there were enough back markers that where `` ok '' . 
  that was when there was unlimited testing . 
  same goes with the engines . 
  in the 80s there were plenty of back markers , while the were was no limit on the amount of engines you could use . 
  there even was a third car !, 
  all those things are already seriously limited , without much results . 
  it will help integrating you . 
  people do n't have to adjust themselves just for you , which will make socializing easier . 
  the others are wrong . 
  that people * can * talk to you does n't mean that they get close to you . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/36oglj/dutch_people_would_you_be_friends_with_a_foreigner/ ) post talks about this at length . 
  see also the [ protein chef ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/dhftns ) on yt , [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pljb8blhm39oug7bmytehlqspopny7odqv ) his shake playlist . 
   he managed almost single-handedly to bring the ttip into national consciousness, 
  highly debatable . 
  he gave it some attention on reddit , but not much more . 
  he seems to be mostly known ( if he would be known ) for the pharaoh affair . 
  i think that this information is useless when we do n't have the report , since the article itself is also useless . 
  it does n't say which place we were ( the articles states `` among the worst , which is something different '' ) and why . 
  no one expect you to become fluently . 
  3-18 months is n't even close to being to short to learn the basics and being able to hold a basic conversation . 
  especially since you probably did n't come here by surprise but knew months beforehand that you would move here . 
  see also [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/36oglj/dutch_people_would_you_be_friends_with_a_foreigner/ ) thread about this issue . 
  except that most of the comments are completely untrue . 
  [ tweet met excuses ] ( https://twitter.com/coenwessel/status/605633345674813441 ), 
  and pretends to speak for everyone, 
   seems to dumb to us , only tuning left all the time, 
  they also did that 50 years ago . 
  only then it would 've been a beatles album . 
  ticket is zo 'n 120eur en reizen in nederland is 11,40 ( 2x 5,70 ) . 
  kabinet ? 
  they are n't . 
  ( warning : rant incoming ), 
  want tijdens de bezetting is niemand dood gegaan . 
  ftfy, 
  heb je het dan over / r/travel ? 
  no , they would see / r/all . 
  you see the defaults when you register an account . 
  you 're right , seems that i remembered it wrong . 
  no one hates avatar because of that . 
  it 's a really big stretch . 
  we 're not using lions and tigers for warfare either , while we have centuries of experience training and raising them . 
  and animals are still just pieces of meat , you can put them down with bullets . 
  running out of gas is an emergency , do you have any source to back up your claim ? 
  i heard about this for germany , but not for here . 
   running out of gas is an emergency , but since the reason for the emergency is pure negligence , ( since you can easily check the amount of fuel in your vehicle , and there are plenty of gas stations ) you 're held at fault and get a $ 230 fine . 
  again , what 's your source for that ? 
  the only cases i see are the ones where the driver endangered others by stopping on a highway line and not on the side of the road . 
  so they would n't read the title , but would read the nsfw tag ? 
  the reason he hates the movie is that he is unable to think for 10 seconds and find an explanation for halve of these questions . 
  no wonder there are downvotes . 
  everyone got the sarcasm . 
  the comment was just dumb as fuck .
