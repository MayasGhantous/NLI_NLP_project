mumble rap has got nothing to do with `` fast rap '' . 
  mumble rappers are artists like young thug , desiigner , 21 savage , future , and lil yachty -- rappers that ` mumble ' and slur their ( generally indecipherable ) lyrics . 
  can i have a source for that ? 
  i 've been listening to the 24 preludes ( op . 
  28 ) nonstop today -- the argerich recordings and the pollini recordings are both highly recommended . 
  as a rule of thumb , the further you go back in time , the more expensive it was to record someone . 
  einstein died in 1955 . 
  before the 50s , it was economically unfeasible to make a ( professional ) recording of an amateur musician like einstein . 
  popularity does not equal artistic merit . 
  while i agree with the way scotus interprets this , i wonder if ` freedom of speech is limited to political speech ' is just a roundabout way of saying ` it 's not practical as a society to allow people to constantly make bomb threats and get away with it ' . 
  because surely there is a lot of decidedly non-political speech that would be considered `` free speech '' ? 
  that , while extremely nasty behavior , should be legal , as it is not ` dangerous ' in the sense that someone will immediately get hurt ( except the one constantly yelling racial slurs/curses at someone , of course ) . 
  look , you can nitpick the statements he has made in search of a gotcha , but i think the intent of his original message was clear : restrictions on speech should be as minimal as practically feasible . 
  i think he meant `` not mandatory anymore '' . 
  actually , i think almost everyone , regardless of political affiliation , would feel extreme amounts of second-hand embarassment from watching op 's actions . 
  single-payer healthcare systems are n't that common , [ but universal healthcare is .

  i own a reissue lp of tche belew by hailu mergia & the walias . 
  i highly recommend listening to that album . 
  i can also recommend the ( much less obscure ) ethio-jazz musician mulatu astatke . 
  it 's not just * unfair * , it 's completely ** illegal ** . 
  why would they use ` african-american ' ? 
  black british people are not from america , and it 's often been centuries since their last ancestor left africa . 
  ( many black britons are from the caribbean ) . 
  in most european countries , red is associated with social-democrats ( the left ) , and blue with classical liberals ( the right ) . 
  china 's current economic system is state capitalism . 
  other than that , you 're correct . 
  china does not give a shit about ip . 
  let me know when economists recognize your narrow definition of capitalism . 
  german courts do n't work like that . 
  they do n't just randomly give custody to the father , without seeing or even contacting the mother . 
  this is almost certainly some sort of scam . 
  an example is the fvd . 
  they 're as anti-immgration and anti-islam as geert wilders ' pvv . 
  the fvd 's leader , thierry baudet , is an incredibly intelligent and promising young right-wing politician . 
  he has a phd and has written books on the necessity of defending dutch/western culture against outside influences . 
  he is also notable critic of post-modernism ( = the ideology underpinning `` sjwism '' ) and new leftism . 
  as for congress , as long has the us has a single member district-based electoral system , it will have a two-party system -- `` thanks '' to duverger 's law . 
  therefore , third parties should not focus on campaigning for a change in the rules of presidential elections , but for a change in the rules of congressional elections . 
  only then they 'll be viable choices . 
  the chance that fundamental changes like these will ever be made to the electoral process is practically nil though , as long as the democratic and republican party are in power . 
  it 's pronounced closer to `` groad '' , with the `` g '' sounding like the `` ch '' in the scottish word `` loch '' . 
  i just voted for baudet of the fvd . 
  he is as anti-islamic and anti-immigration as wilders . 
  his party 's program revolves around topics such as protecting dutch culture , protecting freedom of speech , eradicating foreign influences in the netherlands , and raising the dutch military budget to 2 % of the gdp ; to meet the nato norms . 
  i feel that baudet has a far more solid party program than wilders ' 1-page long bullet list , and that therefore baudet will be much more effective at removing islam from the netherlands . 
  take a look at * both * wilders ' and baudet 's results tomorrow morning ; they are both awesome !, 
  sidenote : since we have a multi-party proportional representation system in the netherlands , and not first-past-the-post , my vote is also not `` wasted '' . 
  it 's the netherlands , not holland . 
  but yes , i agree !, 
  yes , absolutely . 
  ideologically speaking , they 're brothers from another mother . 
  fvd just has somewhat different views on topics such as drugs , economics and the exact implementation of anti-islam policies . 
  but the main message is strikingly similar : get rid of islam , stop immigration , defend dutch and western culture . 
  it 's the beauty ot the insane amount of political parties in the netherlands , most with a real chance of getting seats in our proportional representation system , that we have not one , but multiple anti-islam parties . 
  if you think baudet wo n't look you in the face and tell you what he thinks , you do n't know much about baudet . 
  that 's basically his whole selling point : being direct about himself and his opinions . 
  also , msm tried so hard to paint baudet like the * worst thing ever you guys * , so i doubt he 'd be `` controlled opposition '' ( whatever that means , dutch politics are n't that high profile ) . 
  msm absolutely does * not * want baudet to get seats in the dutch house of representatives , because they know he has the power to win over middle and upper class voters that have not been responding to wilders ' message yet . 
  his `` intellectual conservatism '' reminds me so much of pim fortuyn , who famously got 26 seats out of * absolutely nowhere * in 2002 , in the first ever election his party participated in . 
  msm knows this , and is really scared by the prospect of a new pim fortuyn . 
  a politician like geert wilders is categorically * not * a new pim fortuyn in so many ways , but baudet is . 
  in fact , i am a little more suspicious of wilders sometimes . 
  after all , wilders has a lot of foreign funding , and every now and then i get the feeling that his ragtag team of bumbling fools is counterproductive and slows down the rise of mainstream anti-islamic thought . 
  i mean , i love wilders , both for his speaking style and his viewpoints . 
  however , even though he himself is highly competent and an excellent speaker , many of the lower ranking pvv-kamerleden are easy targets for msm because of their genuine incompetence and their habit of leaving the party prematurely to found their own spin-off right-wing movements . 
  he should be more careful when selecting candidates for his party list . 
  i mean , a guy like martin bosma is a good choice ( ideologically consistent , loyal , very intelligent ) , but a fuckhead like hero brinkmann ( who had a fair bit of legitimate scandals , and who betrayed the party by leaving halfway , and founding his own ill-fated party ) should never have been let on the candidate list . 
  it makes it too easy for regular people to dismiss the party as a joke . 
  the fvd on the other hand is filled to the brim with right-wing intellectuals , has a much clearer message , and a solid ideology underpinning the party platform . 
  after all , baudet has a phd and is a somewhat well-known writer of books on topics such as the necessity to defend our own culture . 
  i believe that fortuyn , and later wilders , paved the way for a solid , highly ideological candidate like baudet . 
  edit : spelling, 
  it 's not a question of winning , just getting as much seats as possible , and then trying to form a coalition consisting of the pvv , fvd , vvd and the cda . 
  baudet will not get much more than 3 seats at most , but every seat counts in a coalition-based democracy . 
  i also voted fvd . 
  elsewhere in this thread i tried to explain why fvd is such a solid pick for people who feel at home in / r/the _ donald . 
   could you tell me how your system works ? 
  for the dutch house of representatives , we have an electoral system called `` party list proportional presentation '' . 
  in short , this has two important implications :, 
  * proportional representation : the percentage of votes your party gets is completely equal to the percentage of seats you get , * unless * your party gets less than one seat worth of votes . 
  an example : if your party gets 14 % of the vote , your party gets 14 % of the seats . 
  ( 21 seats out of a total of 150 seats in the dutch house of representatives ) . 
  there are no districts , no minimum vote tresholds ( except for the minimum of 1 seat ) . 
  ** this means that strategic voting is not necessary , and hence does not really exist in the netherlands . 
  * party-list : you vote for a party first , a person second . 
  the process works like this : every political party hands in an ** ordered ** `` party-list '' of candidates . 
  all these party-lists are printed next to each other on a ballot . 
  voters then vote for a candidate on the party-list of their favorite political party . 
  then , the votes for candidates of a single party are pooled together , and used to determine how many seats a party will get ( the proportional representation bit ) . 
  for example , a party might have a combined total of votes worth 26 seats . 
  this means that the first 26 people on the party-list of that political party will take these seats , * unless * an individual candidate gets at least 1/600th of all votes in the entire elections * and * has more votes than one of the higher-ranked elected candidates on their own party-list . 
  if that happens , they 'll have to swap places , and the lower-ranked candidate gets a seat in the dutch house of representatives based on individual votes . 
  it 's a really fair and balanced system . 
  this electoral system has led to a multi-party system . 
  currently , there are 14 political parties with seats in the dutch house of representatives , none of which has even close to a majority . 
  in fact , no party has ever achieved an absolute majority in dutch history . 
  based on the polls , it is predicted that the party with the most seats after this election will have about 18 % of the seats -- far too little for a single-party government . 
  this all means that dutch political parties have to form coalitions with likeminded parties to form a government . 
  it 's also the reason why wilders , despite possibly becoming the `` largest '' party ( with about 15-20 % of the seats ) , might not be part of the government .
