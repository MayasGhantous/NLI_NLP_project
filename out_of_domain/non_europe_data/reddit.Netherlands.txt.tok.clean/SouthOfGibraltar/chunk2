  it is very likely that a couple of medium-sized centrist parties like cda , vvd , augmented with the leftist pvda , gl or progressive libertarian d66 , might form a government * without * geert wilders ' pvv . 
  the previous `` article '' posted about this topic consists of just a headline , so i decided to post an actual news article about the elections . 
  coalitions with many parties are viable if the parties are ideologically close to each other . 
  plus , it has to start somewhere . 
  if we 're really , really , really lucky , fvd becomes really big two or three elections from now , and together with the pvv they 'll have captured a much larger share of the vote than the pvv would have had on its own . 
  you may be right , but i am betting on a more long-term solution , where we 'll see * multiple * large anti-islamic parties , that combined can capture a larger share of the vote than the pvv ever could on its own . 
  that 's part of the reason why i voted fvd . 
  your view on the matter is too short-term . 
  oh , and baudet is at the core much more hard-right than wilders even , so there is no virtue signalling involved . 
  translated for your entertainment :, 
  copied from my other comment in another thread :, 
   could you tell me how your system works ? 
  for the dutch house of representatives , we have an electoral system called `` party list proportional presentation '' . 
  in short , this has two important implications :, 
  * proportional representation : the percentage of votes your party gets is completely equal to the percentage of seats you get , * unless * your party gets less than one seat worth of votes . 
  an example : if your party gets 14 % of the vote , your party gets 14 % of the seats . 
  ( 21 seats out of a total of 150 seats in the dutch house of representatives ) . 
  there are no districts , no minimum vote tresholds ( except for the minimum of 1 seat ) . 
  ** this means that strategic voting is not necessary , and hence does not really exist in the netherlands . 
  * party-list : you vote for a party first , a person second . 
  the process works like this : every political party hands in an ** ordered ** `` party-list '' of candidates . 
  all these party-lists are printed next to each other on a ballot . 
  voters then vote for a candidate on the party-list of their favorite political party . 
  then , the votes for candidates of a single party are pooled together , and used to determine how many seats a party will get ( the proportional representation bit ) . 
  for example , a party might have a combined total of votes worth 26 seats . 
  this means that the first 26 people on the party-list of that political party will take these seats , * unless * an individual candidate gets at least 1/600th of all votes in the entire elections * and * has more votes than one of the higher-ranked elected candidates on their own party-list . 
  if that happens , they 'll have to swap places , and the lower-ranked candidate gets a seat in the dutch house of representatives based on individual votes . 
  it 's a really fair and balanced system . 
  this electoral system has led to a multi-party system . 
  currently , there are 14 political parties with seats in the dutch house of representatives , none of which has even close to a majority . 
  in fact , no party has ever achieved an absolute majority in dutch history . 
  based on the polls , it is predicted that the party with the most seats after this election will have about 18 % of the seats -- far too little for a single-party government . 
  this all means that dutch political parties have to form coalitions with likeminded parties to form a government . 
  it 's also the reason why wilders , despite possibly becoming the `` largest '' party ( with about 15-20 % of the seats ) , might not be part of the government . 
  it is very likely that a couple of medium-sized centrist parties like cda , vvd , augmented with the leftist pvda , gl or progressive libertarian d66 , might form a government * without * geert wilders ' pvv . 
   is holland still pretty cucked ? 
  the country 's name is the netherlands , not holland . ~ ~, 
  fuck off and go insult a truly cucked nation , like the swedes or something . ~ ~, 
  americans approximating dutch words is adorable !, 
  love the support and remember : the netherlands and america are age-old allies !, 
  kind regards , a dutch centipede . 
  even better : one of the leaders of the dutch socialist party is called [ tiny kox ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tiny_kox ) . 
  van dijck literally means `` from the dyke '' by the way . 
  # [ if i had a province with `` holland '' in its name for every existing gender ] ( http://www.phenomenalglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/the-12-provinces-of-the-netherlands.jpg ), 
  translated that for ya :, 
  haha , y' all make me view common dutch words and names in a new light !, 
  lel , you now made me realize the dutch vote by drawing a red pill next to their preferred candidate . 
  proportional representation is fantastic . 
  currently , there are 14 parties with seats in the dutch house of representatives , and an additional two or three other parties with a real shot at getting at least one seat ; as well as a dozen smaller parties . 
  just a lil ' footnote for the americans : the fact that there are 1114 candidates does n't mean the choice is unnecessarily complicated , as the dutch political system is geared towards voting for a party first , a person second . 
  so there are 28 choices , really , of which about 13 or so are guaranteed to get at least one seat in the dutch house of representatives ( based on the polls ) , and an additional 4 or so parties have a real shot at getting a seat or two . 
  in total , there are about 17 parties that are worth voting for ( in the loosest sense of the term `` worth '' , you 'd be a proper fucking cuck if you 'd vote for groenlinks and jesse `` just fuck my demographics up fam '' klaver ) . 
  also , these are what y' all americans would call `` house elections '' , as we do n't vote * directly * for a prime minister . 
  instead , we vote for new representatives in the dutch house of representatives , and the biggest party in the new government coalition then gets to pick the new prime minister . 
  centipedes know their history , good to see . 
  the netherlands has proportional representation , so vote splitting and strategic voting is not an issue of any importance whatsoever . 
  i voted for baudet and the fvd as well !, 
  dutch politics do n't work like that . 
  we do n't have electoral districts or a first-past-the-post system . 
  today , the netherlands is voting for new members of the dutch house of representatives . 
  the distribution of seats is directly proportional to the percentage of votes a party gets . 
  for example , 16 % of the votes nets a party 16 % of the seats . 
  therefore , strategic voting and vote splitting are not issues in dutch politics ** whatsoever ** . 
  it has led to a multi-party system with currently a * staggering * ** fourteen different parties with seats in the dutch house of representatives ** . 
  also , the biggest party in the ** biggest coalition ** gets to pick the prime minister , * not * the biggest party period . 
  even more importantly , the powers of the prime minister are extremely limited and basically negligible in the grand scheme of things . 
  the amount of seats an anti-islamic coalition gets , that is the only thing that matters . 
  since baudet 's fvd and wilders ' pvv are * both * part of an hypothetical anti-islamic coalition , a vote for either one of them is equally good . 
  / rant over, 
  sincerely , born and raised dutchman , who supports both wilders * and * baudet . 
  close , but no cigar . 
  welcome to a democracy with completely proportional representation . 
  in the netherlands , if you manage to get 1 % of the population to vote for you , you 'll get 1 % of the seats , and you 'll have a job for the next four years . 
  you understand that everyone wants a slice of that pie ... 
  red pencil , actually . 
  but yeah , it 's nice that we get to draw a little red pill next to our preferred candidate . 
  a short summary of the current situation :, 
  print shops here will print everything as long as you give 'em green ( or , rather , multi-coloured bills , seeing as we pay with euros over here ) . 
  i agree to a certain extent with some of your points . 
   the virtue signalling is in the fact that the fvd-shills always try to picture the party as intellectually superior to wilders . 
  oh true , that pisses me off as well . 
  sure , got a little bit too carried away . 
  i apologize . 
  i went too far . 
  no one likes to be called a `` cucked nation '' . 
  i mean , i fucking love my country , so it hurts to hear somebody call us `` cucked '' . 
  kek . 
  we 'll see what the future brings . 
  maybe guldens . 
  maybe not . 
  i 'll try to remember , but i ca n't promise anything . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  pretty much every western democracy uses some form of voter id - even sweden iirc - yet the us has no voter id ?? 
  what the fuck ? 
  this poster is correct . 
  for example , there are polling places in very small villages that always have a +100 % turnout , because people from nearby suburbs prefer to vote in the quaint village instead of the hectic suburb polling places . 
  since you are n't bound to a polling place , and as long as you vote * within * the borders of your own * gemeente * ( dutch version of a us county ) , you see a lot of people going to polling places other than their `` recommended * polling place . 
  anyway , overall turnout might be as high as 85 % . 
  usually it is about 75 % -80 % . 
  keep in mind that those polling places are in small villages with like 40 inhabitants , all of whom are religiously dedicated to voting ( literally , they usually vote for one of the christian parties in those villages ) .
