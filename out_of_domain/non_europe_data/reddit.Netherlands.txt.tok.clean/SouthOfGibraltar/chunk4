  source : am a native dutch speaker . 
  no dutch news outlet said they were crushed , though . 
  in all exit polls , they were 2nd from the get-go . 
  you americans reason from an american perspective . 
  you 're used to the president having a lot of power . 
  the dutch prime minister , on the other hand , is more of a representative role , as the netherlands does not have a presidential system . 
  the dutch prime minister 's unique powers are negligible . 
  he is literally just the just the most prominent of all dutch government ministers ; that 's what meant by the whole * prime * minister title . 
  his job is to represent the netherlands and keep the other ministers in check . 
  the non-importance of being the prime minister is why many dutch prime ministers , if they feel they 've made a misstep or lost the support of the parliament , have voluntarily resigned in the past ; almost always despite there being no scandal or other integrity issue . 
  meanwhile , the dutch parliament is the one with the real power . 
  the prime minister and government 's job is literally just to carry out the decisions of the dutch parliament , with minimal input from the prime minister and government . 
  since the government coalition in the dutch parliament pretty much always has a majority , its interests aligns with those of the government itself . 
  ** in short this means that the important thing in dutch elections are the distribution of seats . 
  ** the fact that wilders ' party has * gained * seats , and became the 2nd biggest out of the 13 parties with seats in the dutch parliament , is a big fucking deal . 
  this election was never about who got to be prime minister . 
  it was about the distribution of seats . 
  y' all americans are not realizing this , and that 's why you think wilders `` lost '' . 
  it 's frustrating to read . 
  finally , someone who is looking at it from the correct perspective . 
  being the pm in the netherlands is not the important matter , as the dutch pm 's unique powers are negligible . 
  the important thing here in the netherlands is the distribution of seats . 
  his party is now the 2nd largest party , out of all 13 parties with seats in the highly fractured dutch parliament . 
  i explained in another thread why fraud in dutch elections is unlikely . 
  wilders ' party made gains ( they got more seats ) , which is the one thing msm was trying to avoid . 
  he was never going to get something like an absolute majority , because the netherlands has a multi-party system with a two dozen parties - almost every single one with a genuine shot at getting at least one seat in the dutch parliament . 
  in the netherlands , if you get x percent of the votes , you also get x percent of the seats . 
  we do n't have electoral districts here , like you americans do . 
  this means that we did n't naturally gravitate towards a two-party system , but have a multi-party system instead . 
  there are a staggering 13 parties with seats in the dutch parliament right now . 
  for example , wilders got 14 % of the vote , which means he 'll get 14 % of the seats in the dutch parliament . 
  his percentage score might seem low , until you realize that the biggest party only got 20 % of the vote , and also only 20 % of the seats as a result . 
  the dutch political system is highly fractionalized . 
  never in dutch history has a party gotten anything close to an absolute majority . 
  it just does n't happen , because of we have a proportional representation system ( instead of an american style district system ) . 
  no problem . 
  and note that there is nothing inherently wrong with reasoning from an american perspective , it just is n't very useful if you want to gain an understanding of why wilders ** won ** in these elections , instead of ** losing ** . 
  if y' all would have had a realistic understanding of dutch elections , this sub would be cheering right now . 
  wilders made gains , he is the second largest out of all 13 parties in the dutch parliament , and like five other conservative-leaning parties in the netherlands are slowly ( but steadily ) embracing the inconvenient truth that islam can not be reasoned with - all thanks to wilders ' presence . 
  the fact that the vvd got so big is because they adopted a lot of viewpoints from wilders , after realizing they 'd be obliterated if they did n't . 
  ( like the dutch socialists , who refused to adapt , and just got annihilated . 
  the dutch socialists went from 38 seats to a historic low of 9 seats ! ), 
  the fire is rising , friend . 
  the fvd is a promising newcomer to the political battleground . 
  pvv is gaining again . 
  the percentage of people who will * always * vote for anti-islamic parties is rising by the month . 
  exactly . 
  soylent is unintentionally hilarious . 
  techies paying lots of money to buy slush that tastes like cardboard . 
   i love that you 're using y' all . 
  dutch also has different words for ` singular you ' ( jij ) and ` plural you ' ( jullie ) , so it kinda feels natural to use y' all instead of just ` you ' or ` you guys ' . 
  also , ` y' all ' sounds pretty close to dutch ` jullie ' ( the j is pronounced like the y in yoghurt ) . 
  i have a very strong dutch accent , so me pronouncing quintessentially southern us words would most probably sound fucking hilarious to an american . 
  pronuncation is by far my weakest spot , when it comes to english language skills . 
  it 's the one part about the english language that i struggle the most with . 
   congrats on your big win , then !, 
  thanks !, 
  very true , though almost all frenchmen were already aware of geert wilders ' existence . 
  he has been covered by european media for years now . 
  after all , he has been in the dutch parliament since the 1990s , and he started the pvv in 2005 . 
  if the phrase was n't associated with low energy jeb so much , i 'd use the words `` slow and steady '' to describe wilders ' ascent towards becoming the biggest party of the netherlands : over the years , his dips in the polls are less and less severe , and his peaks higher and higher . 
  there is a clear upwards trend here , and it is directly correlated to the increasing presence of islam in europe . 
   in the future could you see pvv being # 1 and wilders becoming pm ? 
  i could see the pvv becoming the largest party in the next elections , but it will take a mentality shift among the vvd and cda voter bases for wilders to be able to form a viable coalition and become pm . 
  this mentality shift among the vvd and cda voter bases is already occuring , so i have very high hopes for wilders . 
  for example : the cda seems to have adopted a new , nationalist party line , with symbolic but meaningful proposals such as introducing the singing of the national anthem in schools . 
  meanwhile , the vvd has stressed that immigrants of non-western descent have the choice between 1 ) adopting dutch culture , or 2 ) going back to their country of origin . 
  while these new , vaguely nationalist positions of the vvd and the cda pale in comparison to the hard-right , unabashedly nationalist line of the pvv , it 's still a sign of hopeful new beginnings . 
  thanks . 
  i appreciate that you 're educating people about this . 
  hopefully . 
  the dutch are a merchant nation after all . 
  voc mentality and all that . 
  can you give me a link to that post ? 
  i 'd like to read it . 
  the muslim party got 2 % of the vote , not 7 % . 
  but yes , it 's a disgrace . 
  every percent is one too many . 
  pvda , not pvdd . 
  everything else in your comment is more or less correct . 
  the denk party is not nominally a `` muslim '' party , but for all intents and purposes they can be considered the muslim party , since their voter base is almost solely muslims . 
  it 's a symptom of the problems with islam . 
  it shows that muslims are not participating in our society . 
  in the netherlands , the percentage of seats a party gets in the parliament is directly proportional to the percentage of votes that party got in the elections . 
  for example , if your party gets 13 % of the vote , your party then gets 13 % of the seats in the parliament . 
  since there are 150 seats , the muslim party ( who got 2 % of the vote nationwide ) got 3 seats ( 2 % of 150 seats ) . 
  there are no electoral districts , just a single nationwide pool of votes . 
  this system is called proportional representation and versions of it are used almost everywhere in the western world , except for the uk , us , canada , and france . 
  good and correct explanation . 
  the amount of seats is proportional to the amount of votes . 
  example : 14 % of the vote means you 'll get 14 % of those 150 seats ( i.e. 
  21 seats ) . 
  no , the majority of the people are still blue-pilled . 
  that 's why it was a tie . 
  not because of the dutch political system . 
  in fact , the political system here in the netherlands is excellent , because it makes it easy for new ( ish ) political movements like geert wilders ' pvv and thierry baudet 's fvd to gain traction and get seats . 
  proportional representation is one of the most democratic systems possible , and also the one system where it is easy for newcomers to get big ( remember based pim fortuyn ? ), 
  without having to change an establishment party from the inside ( like trump had to do with the gop ) . 
  [ their party leader looks uncannily like a frog though .
