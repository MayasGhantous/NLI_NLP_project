  you 're so wrong about gl . 
  gl are the worst type of leftists . 
  they want to * intentionally increase * immigration by intentionally inviting refugees from the middle east to the netherlands . 
  all under the guise of `` it 's the humanitarian thing to do '' . 
  remember : one of the four predecessor parties that joined forces to form the gl party in the early 1990s is the former ** communist party of the netherlands ** !, 
  these guys are at the core marxists , through and through . 
  i did n't mean to come across as condescending . 
  i only tried to explain how the dutch political system works . 
  maybe the language barrier made it sound more abrasive than intended . 
  exactly . 
  the more seats he gets , the harder it will be for the other parties to form a viable coalition without wilders . 
  at some point , they 'll have to accept that they 'll have to cooperate with him . 
  yes , in 4 years time . 
  however , it is not uncommon for the elections to be even earlier than that ; because dutch coalitions voluntarily break up every now and then , if they feel they 've lost popular support . 
  no , the initial 19 seats result was a prediction based on exit polls . 
  those are usually off by about 5 % -10 % compared to the actual results . 
  yes , that sounded more condescending than i intended . 
  language barriers are a bitch . 
  the netherlands does ** not ** have birthright citizenship ( we have what 's called * jus sanguinis * , look it up ) . 
  you will only be a dutch citizen if one of your parents is a dutch citizen . 
  the kids of non-citizens are n't automatically a dutch citizen , like in the us . 
  this means `` anchor babies '' are n't a thing in the netherlands . 
  the problem is that these non-western parents * do * have citizenship , because they became naturalized citizens at some point . 
  overall , the left shrank though . 
  blue = all right-wing parties together have a majority in this municipality, 
  red = all left-wing parties together have a majority in this municipality, 
  yellow = about even, 
  the darker the color , the higher the total percentages . 
  netherlands , not denmark . 
  and vote splitting is not a issue in the netherlands , because of proportional representation . 
  there are no districts , so every vote counts .

  my niece lives in stockholm . 
  i fear for her safety . 
  you guys ' do n't have to deal with massive muslim minorities . 
  only 1 % of americans are muslim . 
  unless you live in dearborn , you wo n't be fully aware of the immense impact that large groups of muslims have on society . 
  a staggering 11 % of inhabitants of france are muslim . 
  for sweden it 's 6 % . 
  the numbers are even higher when you look at urban areas . 
  a quarter of people in stockholm are muslim . 
  for paris it 's something like 1 in 3 ( france does n't collect statistics on this , so researchers have to make rough estimates ) . 
  these high numbers mean western europe is slowly but surely being islamized . 
  that 's news too , right ? 
  alright . 
  i think when people mention country when they talk about how they like pretty much all genres , `` except for country and rap '' , they are usually talking about what you might call `` bro country '' -- not the traditional country music you mentioned . 
  bro country is essentially pop music for young people that identify with the whole `` conservative rural lifestyle '' ( whether they live in a rural area or not , that does n't really matter ) . 
  i think a debt like that has less to do with impulse purchases , and more with something resembling a gambling addiction . 
  are n't there laws against mislabeling the ingredients of your products ? 
  it 's not that weird that there are lots of useful compounds to be found in plants . 
  evolution is essentially a trial-and-error experiment that lasts for hundreds of millions of years , which ( generally ) results in complex chemical compounds that have some use to the plants that produce them . 
  it stands to reason that this `` lab of evolution '' has created some very useful compounds . 
  even when we try to find useful compounds ourselves by randomly trying out new compounds in a lab setting , we ca n't compete with the hundreds of millions of years of blind trial-and-error of evolution . 
  and yes , agreed , homeopathy is still bullshit . 
  less . 
  it costs all americans about a buck each to drop ** 20 ** of those motherfuckers :, 
   but the number heavily cited across social media , $ 314 million , was how much the us military paid for 20 such bombs , technically called the massive ordnance air blast . 
  you paid 5 pennies each to blow 100 is fighters to smithereens . 
  i 'd say that is great value for your money . 
  are the doodles specific to a country , or are they generally used globally ? 
  because i could see google not including memorial day because it means nothing to billions of non-americans . 
  dark blue = le pen ( nationalist ), 
  yellow = macron ( liberal ), 
  red = melenchon ( socialist ), 
  light blue = fillon ( conservative ), 
  france does n't vote state by state . 
  they have a nationwide vote . 
  hence , swing states do n't exist . 
  her best strategy would actually be the opposite from what you are suggesting : she should tour her own strongholds , because those contain the groups of swing voters that are most likely to vote for her . 
  which subreddit is this from ? 
  [ removed ], 
  `` it must be incredibly frustrating as an islamic terrorist not to have your views and motives taken seriously by the societies you terrorize , even after you have explicitly and repeatedly stated them . 
  even worse , those on the regressive left , in their endless capacity for masochism and self-loathing , have attempted to shift blame inwardly on themselves , denying the terrorists even the satisfaction of claiming responsibility . 
  it 's like a bad monty python sketch :, 
  `` we did this because our holy texts exhort us to to do it . '', 
  `` no you did n't . '', 
  `` wait , what ? 
  yes we did ... '', 
  `` no , this has nothing to do with religion . 
  you guys are just using religion as a front for social and geopolitical reasons . '', 
  `` what !? 
  did you even read our official statement ? 
  we give explicit quranic justification . 
  this is jihad , a holy crusade against pagans , blasphemers , and disbelievers . '', 
  `` no , this is definitely not a muslim thing . 
  you guys are not true muslims , and you defame a great religion by saying so . '', 
  `` huh !? 
  who are you to tell us we 're not true muslims !? 
  islam is literally at the core of everything we do , and we have implemented the truest most literal and honest interpretation of its founding texts . 
  it is our very reason for being . '', 
  `` nope . 
  we created you . 
  we installed a social and economic system that alienates and disenfranchises you , and that 's why you did this . 
  `` what ? 
  why are you apologizing ? 
  we just slaughtered you mercilessly in the streets .
