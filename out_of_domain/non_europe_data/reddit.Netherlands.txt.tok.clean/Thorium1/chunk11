  enjoyable read . 
  if you have a good relation with the person over a long period of time , they 'll slightly change their attitude . 
  it cost me 40 years to go from hostile to neutral with aragon as portugal . 
  i 've seen the ai take land and give them to you in an offensive war where you took a part in . 
  ( and sieged stuff , otherwise they wo n't be able to give them to you . ), 
  there was a thread like half a year ago which had a certain text you had to search in google . 
  if you can find it , good luck .

  chanarchive has been down since 12 aug. which is 8 days ago . 
  the plot thickens . 
  well done , there 's more though . 
  it also increases the manpower and tax income . 
  you do n't get negatives for uncontested claims except a event that pop ups randomly claiming the peasants are outraged over rightful land ** if you got the event which states that there were map issues and you decide to press the issue instead of the stability loss ** . 
  ( you 'll have to choose between losing 100 diplomatic power or a stability loss . ), 
  over time they will go away . 
  you can see when if you select the province you have a claim on , mouse over your shield at the cores with a green lining around it , indicating that it 's a claim . 
  a tooltip will appear and show you when it ends . 
  it shows that aragon will keep their ideas , but not if portugal will keep them or not . 
  transfer to na , < insert na gets free rp joke here  . 
  those fiora splasharts look amazing :, 
  mountains give -3 dice rolls for the attacker . 
  river crossings is -1 . 
  if you view the terrain map , it shows you the percentage of the terrain , which decides if you have a defensive bonus or not . 
  river crossings are also really vague . 
  if you see a river on the campaign map then you can assume 9/10 that there will be a river crossing where ever you go . 
  that 's at least my experience . 
  you can also take a capital if it 's the wargoal . 
  you ca n't fabricate a claim on it , but you can get an event which gives you a claim , and then press it as the wargoal . 
  the normal limit for improved relations is 100 , but vassals can go higher than that . 
  `` 30 % better relations over time '' means that the negatives drop 30 % faster and the positive increase 30 % faster , to their respective limit . 
  thanks for the answer , i just have the question of , how do you deal with france ? 
  in my game they seem to have this unending selection for great leaders compared to my own , and they just have a 6/5/3 / 3 commander wrecking my forces . 
  rejoined a game , only 4 people were playing .

  compliments to arumba . 
  in my 2 games great britain got beaten by france to greenland and they had to wait till they could reach the americas . 
  ( i blocked the bermuda to delay them , they usually discover that , right ? ), 
  this happens usually around 1595 . 
  correct . 
  if it does n't have an adjacent territory they can be claimed . 
  you ca n't also fabricate a claim against a capital , but you can receive the border friction event which gives a claim and you can claim it as the war goal . 
  at least , that 's my experience . 
  `` peacefully changing government type costs 100 administrative monarch power and requires the country to have enough administrative technology for the target government type to be available . 
  monarchies may only peacefully change to other monarchical governments , and republics may only adopt other republican governments . 
  a republic becomes a monarchy if its republican tradition reaches 0 or if overran by noble or pretender rebels . 
  a monarchy becomes a republic if overran by revolutionary or peasant rebels . '', 
  so no . 
  source : [ eu4 wiki ] ( http://eu4wiki.com/government_types ), 
  also a higher stability cost . 
  if the specific rebels that are mentioned are victorious , yes . 
  i 'm not sure about if you can accept their demands or not . 
  i know for a fact that at level 5 the infantry is nearly twice as good . 
  also with military tech , the enemy gets increased combat width , allow for more troops to fight . 
  military tech also increases the base value of shock and fire , which determines how much damage they do . 
  tatics is also increased , which reduces their loses . 
  tl ; dr military tech is super important . 
  6 ' 6 '' reporting in for the bitches . 
  do n't worry , i got the monty python reference . 
  i knew she was dutch , even though her accent is barely noticeable . 
  [ picture used on reddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1l3al3/now_i_can_officially_say_that_miley_cyrus_is/cbvfsva ), 
  i would say that the caribbean are the most valuable . 
  you could transfer from the caribbean trade node up to the americas , and from there to london . 
  the caribbean is the meeting point for the mexican , panama and mississippi river trade node . 
  everything from there automatically flows to the trade node because the natives have a hard time with trade , usually with the tribal democracy they have 0 % trade power . 
  so if those areas get colonized , there will be a lot of trade value that can be steered forward . 
  the ai usually does n't collect from it since it has the 50 % penalty and it 's usually better to steer it forward to your capital 's trade node . 
  there is n't an answer without explaining it , so good luck finding it out . 
  if it helps , discipline is the best way to increase combat efficiency . 
  he meant the nation ( s ) attacking sweden . . 
  i believe f they refuse you join on the defender 's side . 
  you do get a huge discount ** if the territories are overseas ** . 
  when i was converting the aztec culture i only needed 5x base tax worth of diplomatic points . 
  coring still costs more than you 'd like to spend , though . 
  apparently [ anivia ] ( http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/anivia_0.jpg ) , sortof an articuno of league of legends is prohibited on the fact that she 's female . 
  although she does make the joke `` laying an egg is n't as easy as it looks '' , it 's hardly justified . 
  so i 'd say no . 
  in my experience , early in the game assaulting , even with a wall breach usually runs into losing a lot of men . 
  unless there are like certain circumstances ( his armies are coming back and you want to get as much warscore to peace out ) it 's generally not worth it to assault . 
  the morale loss just puts your army at risk and if you 've already beaten his armies , why waste the manpower ? 
  i failed to mention that i formed spain as portugal . 
  france is in tatters and just a bunch of smaller states are now in control , although some are growing stronger . 
  embarking them would cost me since i 've got rivals in place to keep alliances with great britain and the netherlands , plus to find new allies against the ottoman empire whom have grown too much for my liking . 
  great britain is one of the people sucking out of the trade node but it 's just a coalition of smaller nations that 's sucking out the most . 
  so my logic was to get more trade power to decrease theirs in comparison . 
  i 've managed to get 289 trade power and still they suck out about 1/5th of the wealth in it . 
  but why is it grey instead of blue ? 
  some locations do n't need steering . 
  i know for a fact that brazil automatically steers it forward since nobody is collecting from it/keeping it there . 
  the same counts for cape of good hope and california . 
  mexico splits two ways , into the panorama and into the caribbean , panorama goes only towards the caribbean , same as peru which only streams into the panorama . 
  i am the only person with provinces there and only have one merchant sending everything from the caribbean to seville . 
  ( i only had to kick two french provinces out of the caribbean , took bermuda to slow down the english since the french had greenland and was expanding into southern africa . ), 
  asian trade notes do however split more and i bet there are other nations attempting to collect from it .

  [ trade nodes flowing without a trader , evenly split .

  although it does reduce your income by 50 % if the trade node you 're collecting from is not in the same trade node as your capital . 
  so it would be most efficient to move his capital .
