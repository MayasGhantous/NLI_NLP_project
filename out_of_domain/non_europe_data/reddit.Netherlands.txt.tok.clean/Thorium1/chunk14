  used on euw and eune , good luck with it . 
  you only get that penalty when you have a kingdom . 
  since giving away duchy titles while a duke will release independent states instead . 
  there 's good reason to form kingdoms . 
  rather than please a lot of counts with gifts and titles , you can instead please a few dukes . 
  they 'll be stronger , but you 're more likely to get more bang for your buck in diplomatic powers . 
  rather than convert a different culture count , you could put him under a duke of your culture and not care about him at all . 
  kingdom laws such as crown authority will increase the men your vassals will supply . 
  you will also get more troops from 1 duke that owns 3 counties than 3 individual counts in general . 
  since the troops the count vassals of the duke will provide is 100 % rather than based on their opinion . 
  prestige is also another reason to create a kingdom title . 
  plus it allows for dejure claims to be pressed , and counts and dukes will be more likely to accept vassalage , rather than counts not wanting to vassalize because you 're not so much a higher rank and not being able to vassalize dukes at all . 
  tl ; dr , lots of advantages to creating kingdoms . 
  `` 5 days ago '', 
  read it , m8 . 
  it 's his splash page now . 
  they 've redone a lot of splash arts and visual make-overs to look more refined like the new champions . 
  a lot has changed though since you 've last played . 
  perhaps check out / r/leagueoflegends, 
  episode 3 confirmed . 
  the game is in a terrible position at the moment . 
  i 've bought the game myself and although i had little problem running it , the ai is just terrible and diplomacy is once again , worthless . 
  i hoped they would learn and listen to the advice given to them by the community . 
  i watched angry joe 's review and i was embarrassed buying the game . 
  they 'll fix it up eventually as always , but it 's a disappointment nonetheless . 
  i thought immediately about 9/11 draven with planes instead of axes . . 
  draven is just a picked by / r/leagueoflegends in order to get people butthurt . 
  probably a gamefag trying to `` rally '' support for snake . 
  `` partner gets up '', 
  i knew something was up . 
  if you were a straight person you 'd say she was a 11/10 and brag about it . 
  tyrion told him instead of going to dany , he should invade westeros and have dany come to him , claiming that if she hears of his position she 'd rush to his aid . 
  proving his skill in battle rather than just appear at her court , he 'd be her `` equal '' in terms of conquest . 
  there is no way to weld doors in dayz . 
  basically once you can raise so many troops the game ca n't follow it . 
  it had something to do with code and maximum number or something . 
  imaginary sex/with himself . 
  /  tfw you attempt to greentext, 
  /  tfw when no qt 4.13 gf, 
  even / u/reads _ small_text_bot knows better . 
  it is n't exactly blue . 
  it looks more like a really light shade of purple to me . 
  i 'm not sure what your question is . 
  are you trying to find a suitable husband for your daughter , but the list for `` potential suitors '' given to you only contain 2 - 3 results ? 
  what do you mean with `` remove me as the dynasty label '' ? 
  question 2 :, 
  if one of the nations create ireland , they become the nation of ireland and gain cores of ireland all over irish lands . 
  so if they would be destroyed , they can still be released as a new nation . 
  as for question 1 , i believe being independent is required for forming most nations . 
  do n't quote me on that though . 
  except you have to select each individual county for every duke , which is what he does n't want to do . 
  i do n't know of a way to keep the capital either , but in my experience the keyboard shortcut mod makes this really easy which really speeds it up . 
  all you have to do is select a coastal county , press z and repeat .

  ( as far as i know , the mod link will provide future updates . ), 
  your chances increase significantly at the 100 % and 200 % mark , but i do n't know the exact numbers . 
  every percent plot power increases the chance . 
  it 's a joke . 
  a terrible one at that , but a joke nonetheless . 
  it 's probably a exported game from ck2 , because if he was so good , why would he need hints ? 
  damn , this is an old one , a copy pasta no less . . 
  nothing . 
  i just colonize , have it core and move onto the next one . 
  usually colonize where there is profit , especially trade . 
  you can core with fleet basing rights . 
  except that desperate teenagers roam this sub board , which use this for attention on any social media . 
  do it like this : \\ \\ #, 
  because else it wo n't show the \\ # if you do n't use a \\ \\ . 
  i suppose the \\ \\ is to nullify the effect of reddit 's software use of the digit , which is in this case to create a line . 
  it 's useful for stories and such i suppose . 
  #like this . 
  #the end . 
  credits and whatnot . 
  there 's also an achievement if you conquer the world as ryukyu . 
  i believe it 's the hardest achievement to complete . 
   does n't know how to zoom in . 
  open link ( image ) in new tab , use zoom . 
  proof , time stamp , who are you , what is your relationship to this person ? 
  do n't be a faggot like this guy . 
  if you export a game from crusader kings 2 with the sunset invasion dlc , which means aztecs invade europe , they have the same as western tech , unique national ideas and start with a lot of land that used to be places for colonies . 
  same with the inca 's and the maya 's start in the bahama 's islands and the right island of cuba . 
  i did exactly this , watched a lets play without commentary a year or two back . 
  the gameplay is n't all that special in my opinion , but the story is worth watching . 
  edit : i watched enslaved odyssey a year or two back . 
  i watched day9 's let 's play of the last of us . 
  i 'd say amumu 's ult is better since it 's almost instant plus larger , compared to leona 's .

  did n't you mean heartsbane as in the valyrian weapon ? 
  or whoresbane , the umber guy ? 
  well , did op deliver ? 
  my guess is that [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1o7j6l/i_finished_my_jinx_upvote_gif_hope_you_guys_gals/ ) is it . 
  / u/xeolleth, 
  the target being at war does n't prevent you from declaring war yourself . 
  are you using any mods or dlcs ? 
  and what is your starting date ? 
  it depends on base tax though . 
  adding temples or constables does n't increase the base tax .
