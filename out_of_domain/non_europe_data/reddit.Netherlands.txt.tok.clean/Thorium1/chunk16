  it 's because you are not a de jure vassal of the holy roman empire . 
  kings can not swear fealty unless your kingdom is not in the de jure area of the holy roman empire . 
  i would recommend not giving yourself titles through console though . 
  most of the time it has ... 
  unforeseen consequences . 
  to add to spamburgler 's comment , you should check out the [ northern conspiracy theory ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1iwfc1/spoilers_all_the_grand_northern_conspiracy_parts/ ) about the last one . 
  this is the event :,

  it 's quite rare . 
  you need to have a province with the highway_robber_band modifier on one of your provinces with positive revolt risk . 
  your character needs to be older than 20 , ca n't be a prisoner or incapable . 
  you can also not be ill , muslim , in command or at war . 
  i 've heard multiple people complain that if you put somebody on ignore ( s ) he 'll be removed from your friend 's list . 
  not sure if it 's true or not . 
  yes , you can . 
  it does trigger even when at war/in command etc. 
  generally the holy roman empire will join the defender 's side if possible to increase imperial authority . 
  wait until the emperor is busy in other wars . 
  austria will most likely end up at war with venice/hungary . 
  that backfired so hard , damn . 
  the problem is probably that it does not compare the army strength . 
  gunz had/has a pretty dedicated duel community . 
  it was like the true way to display skill and most people used the bow emote to start off the fight . 
  i 'm not a fan of athene or anything , but that was pretty good . 
   the first association of the tricolour with republicanism is the orange-white-blue design of the prince 's flag ( prinsenvlag , predecessor of the flags of the netherlands and luxembourg ) , used from 1579 by william i of orange-nassau in the eighty years ' war , establishing the independence of the dutch republic from the spanish empire . 
  hipster dutch . 
   my oldest sister is 5 years younger than my mom . 
  is she really your sister and did your mother birth her at the age of 5 or is she a step-sister ? 
  the witcher 2 for me . 
  i love the story and that alone should convince me to finish it , but i just ca n't get into the combat system . 
  [ funnier video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwvbxiegl44 ), 
  he seriously responds to every post of / u/noobsniper1o1 with the same story . 
  this is like the 4th time i see him , he 's pretty dedicated . 
  damned spanish trying to oppress us again !, 
  everyone knows that grenades launcher launches grenades in a bow angle , while rpg fires in a ( sortof ) straight line . 
  so by that logic a grenade launcher is flacid and a rpg is erect . 
  joan of arc is considered part of the good military record ? 
  i thought she was more an idol than an actual military commander . 
  it 's probably all the christian priests getting send north and getting shorter by a head , that or a christian made with the ruler designer . 
  it might ask for it when you start multiplayer or if you want to apply the game to your paradox forum account . 
  just ignore it , you 'll be able to find the key if you need it by right clicking the game in your library in the game 's settings or whatever it 's called ( the lowest option most likely ), 
  no worries , they 'll just use that $ 100 bill instead . 
  yeah , i mean why did the person leave with all the stuff left behind and how does he get inside the house ? 
  how could the person know of the secret staircase and the owners/sales people not know ? 
  ( or did n't tell anything about it ), 
  so many questions unanswered . 
  ha , gulden is best currency . 
  germoney pls . 
  yeah , a while back we had a pretty big storm . 
  blew my 2,30 m fence straight out of the ground . 
  the person that made this usually keeps this up to date whenever it 's updated . 
  it says . 
  `` getting a beta key not guaranteed . '', 
  keep this in mind . 
  if you did what i think you did ... =(, 
  well played can also be used when an opponent makes a good move . 
  i 've seen it often used in streams . 
  i 'm also jealous , does that count ? 
  i 've heard if you have been accepted for beta you get an extra key to give to somebody of your choice . 
  this is probably the reason if it 's true . 
  it 's 21:19 cet and i saw that the 16.11.13 had n't been released yet , just saw placeholders for part 1 , 2 and 3 . 
  then the site crashed for me . 
  nope , it 's not working . 
  the codes have n't been released yet ... 
  you could 've found out from the other thread . 
  i 've learned quite some things , even though i come from a mtg background . 
  mostly which card people can play with which class . 
  my favorite card would be the lightwell for priests .
