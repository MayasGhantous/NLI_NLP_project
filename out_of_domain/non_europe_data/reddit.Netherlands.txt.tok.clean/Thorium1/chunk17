  everytime it gets thrown down somehow it ends up being this huge ~ 20/20 monster or something . 
  i 'd probably start with a druid or priest . 
  they look like fun . 
  did you get 25 prestige or was it just a visual bug ? 
  i 'm not sure why you 've created a new account to post these messages , but just check ebay , everyone is selling them . 
  besides , he 's giving most of them away at random to random viewers . 
  $ 50 dollar ? 
  you 'd be able to buy for less anywhere else . 
  also `` keys are to be given away or put up for a contest only . 
  do not make threads asking for keys , and do not ask people to pay for your beta key using money or anything that is easily bought . '', 
  [ ebay ] ( http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.tr8.trc1.a0.xhearthstone+key&amp;_nkw=hearthstone+key&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=r40 ), 
  there 's still 3 days to go though . 
  i swear , this is slowly turning into a cult . 
  i can see members here already sacrificing horses with fake horns for him . 
  did you really make this ? 
  from 2010 . 
  top kek is also pretty popular . 
  you quoted the key , shame on you for giving me false hope . 
  good luck everyone . 
  i 'm not forcing people to use this method , just an idea to give equal chances to everyone . 
  i 'm sorry , but we 're all in the same boat here . 
  you can check the [ posts ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sharehearthstone/comments/1qyxln/new_giveaways_1911/ ) that / u/pywack is so kind to make and try your luck in the raffle / giveaways . 
  `` will i ever play the game ? '', 
  open beta is 1/2 months away , so unless you lost complete interest in it , there 's still that . 
  they just posted and i tried every key , all claimed . 
  edit : there is one last list of like 15 keys left , all the rest are already claimed . 
  trust me , i tried . 
  it 's happening right now , the last of the last is being posted in ~ 10 minutes, 
  same here ;d, 
  you probably took the lowest , right as i clicked continue it was claimed , but the next one was also unclaimed ^ ^, 
  same here in the netherlands . 
  amsterdam is like a major spot for prostitution . 
  is geen nazi terrorist , just forced to commit crimes for germany . 
  is innocent . 
  updated the post to clarify what i meant by it . 
  he usually kept a link in his videos to the keyboard shortcut mod , but i have n't seen it in a while . 
  have n't seen anything on his website either . 
  perhaps a point he should look into . 
  how many likes do they need to give them out ? 
  edit : apparently sharing gives you a free heartstone key . 
  i doubt this is real . 
  move along people . 
  i believe it 's for a link site . 
  you know those sites that say `` refer this page 10 times and you get a key '' ? 
  this is probably one of the pages to get people to join those sites . 
  pywack really saved people here . 
  if it was n't for his dedication by finding giveaways a lot here would n't have gotten any keys . 
  i 'll try it out the next time i get the chance , thanks . 
  that copy pasta though . 
  it only took me 3 days to get my key . 
  december / probably delayed to january . 
  they 've also said they were supposed to be in open beta already but got delayed countless times . 
  if they go through with it and it 's not ready , perhaps nobody will be able to play . 
  i think / u/lhedn meant jake instead of the operator , since she 's clearly a woman . 
  for murdering two of his close family , he does sound very indifferent . 
  yeah , probably takes another month or so . 
  last time i played we have like a battle line of turrets , nobody had the aoe to destroy them . 
  they could n't stop the siege due to the passives . 
  `` you liked this '' . 
  you 're cruel . 
  it 's upside down because everything in poland is upside down . 
  take over indonesia and i 'll be proud . 
  why would i give a fuck about 9/11 ? 
  to explain waaagh to non-warhammer 40k people , waaaagh is basically a giant war and is to rally support of other orks to join the waaaagh against their enemies , rather than fight amongst their own ork clans . 
  avid game of thrones fan , i bet . 
  even the hair looks alike . 
  [ sounds good . 
  you ca n't get link karma for a self post . 
  ( text post ) =(, 
  as long as you do n't spam `` free keys follow this suspicious link and download these files '' you 'll be fine . 
  i thought it was a play on being so shocked that he shit a monocle . 
  ( instead of bricks ), 
  yes . 
  surprisingly according to karma decay it 's has n't been posted there yet . 
  it has been posted about a million times on / r/funny , as expected . 
  i guess if you get both questions right you get the key . . 
  gold v dutch here too . 
  i 'd like to think i have knowledge about the game . 
  not really role defined here . 
  i guess that sortof makes 5 people if you all are interested . 
  mobafire requires you to have an account of at least 2 months old to be eligible for the key . 
  `` what is updog ? '', 
  translates to `` what is up , dawg ? '', 
  used by black people mostly to greet each other . 
  it 's the same as `` how are you doing ? 
  the closeup in the video though , literally makes me sick . . 
  looks more like a hairball of a cat . 
  is that really the wtf of this picture ? 
  i 'm more surprised they held it on the 6th of december . 
  i hear countless stories in the netherlands about bombs being found by people stumbling upon them . 
  usually some special bomb squad comes and either detonates it or diffuse it . 
  have n't heard any story of one blowing up on people , yet ... 
  `` what would you want him not being ? '', 
  does n't really make any sense though , i automatically read `` what would you want him to be ? '', 
  without a second thought . 
  actually you can go to user 's page , find the comment and then downvote it from there . 
  congrats , you won !, 
   i 'm surprised by the number of people that have asked about this . 
  i did n't intend to make the game moddable . 
  if there 's enough demand for it , i 'd think about releasing a tool set , but it is n't a focus of the development at the moment .
