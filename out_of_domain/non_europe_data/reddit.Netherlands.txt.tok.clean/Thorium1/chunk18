  i think it was a / r/wtf post wherein a user found a hidden stairs behind his bookcase and found some crazy shit from what seemed like a child . 
  he placed a banana he had been eating next to it and when he was asked if the banana was fresh he said he put it there . 
  at least , that was the first time i came across it .

  sweet !, 
  it even got a little windmill as upvote button !, 
  there 's a reason many people call ireland the `` tutorial island '' . 
  it was pretty obvious what was going to happen after the 2nd spoiler happened , but i honestly really felt for emily . 
  also , after having finished the game and restarting with the purpose of the `` good '' ending plus restrictions ( my personal favorite playstyle was not using blink and attempt to not kill any guards . ), 
  but the good ending is much more satisfying in terms of story .
