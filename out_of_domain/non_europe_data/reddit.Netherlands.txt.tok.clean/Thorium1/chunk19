  looks more like both players had double faceless + mind controls . 
  lorewalker cho copies spells , not minions . 
  plus you ca n't thoughsteal priests from a mage . . 
  / r/games already has had multiple instances of banished being advertised there . 
  they 've gotten a pretty positive impression of the game . 
  this is horrible ... 
  to add to this comment , gathering huts work best in forests . 
  / r/theredpill, 
  i was wondering why i have you tagged as `` i have more comment karma derp derp '' . . now i remember . 
   no one will judge you as well if you pirate it as a sort of demo , most of the pirates of paradox games end up buying them out of a sense of morality which is pretty good for them . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvo50gyniii ), 
  the article does say this about it :, 
   let 's put that 190 hours in perspective . 
  that 's almost 8 days of solid play time . 
  and that 's the average for someone who plays paradox games . 
  that means there are people who play the game for thousands of hours to offset the few who might pick it up for only an hour or two .

  you can still use alt + enter and then alt + tab . 
  just select hearthstone and use alt + enter to return . 
  nope . 
  you 'll have more luck paying for a vpn . 
  i 've tried free vpns but when 9 of em do n't work , you just give up . 
  using a paid vpn of a friend allowed me to play . 
  i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  there are nudes of her somewhere , the original thread had like 50 of em . 
   / u/qedomelets [ 1 ] [ apparently he sniffed his sister 's panties ] [ sniffs mumsister panties ] there .

  that 's a start, 
  doing my part . 
  the `` artist '' even signed his name on the lower left corner . 
  `` 100,000 people play this '', 
  seems fishy . 
  because the player 's name is bjergs ** e ** n. 
  also , the ` real ' one is probably / u/xlbjergsen since i believe he used that account for his ama . 
  do you know the correct pronunciation ? 
  thank you !, 
  [ here 's another one .

  this was news some time ago , if iirc it was a protest in jerusalem about something related to the jews . 
  i believe ** overlord ** deserves another try . 
  the cheesy humour , unique mechanics and the story are just what makes it an interesting game . 
  i feel that if they would try it again , they could just make a lot of improvements and put life again in the fun game i loved . 
  at least it 's not as bad as that person that masturbated on stream . 
  i remember that guardsman bob was in chat saying `` man loco is taking attracting viewers to a whole new limit '',

  [ here 's some more video game wallpapers with the names of the games . 
  windlord 's ruin :, 
   after destroying a minion with an attack , your hero gains windfury this turn . 
  it 's a bit unclear for me . 
  do you get 1 overload for each time you gain windfury or when you play the weapon ? 
  if it 's the 2nd case , then this would be more appropriate, 
  windlord 's ruin :, 
  after destroying a minion with an attack , your hero gains windfury this turn . 
  there are sample chapters of twow though . 
  i accidentally came across one being discussed in an ( spoilers all ) thread and not reading those would pretty much limit a lot for me .

  i once heard of a time traveler that got laid . 
  are you that one ? 
  that sounds pretty interesting . 
  do you know which episode by any chance ? 
  sorry for the bad quality , i do n't have a good camera . 
  here 's what i need help with : in the ` break ' i had from warhammer i 've lost quite a few shields that were n't attached yet to the units . 
  i 'm missing 2 lizardmen shields and about 10-12 bretonnian knight shields . 
  i 've tried searching bits sites for these , but since they 're quite old i have n't been able to find any , as expected . 
  so i wonder , would it be possible to use a 3d printer to print these plastic shields ? 
  i do n't have a lot of experience with them so i would n't know how to start , but i might be able to get my hands on one . 
  god his `` draw my life '' is just so . . sad . 
  i have , but they 're not exactly the kind of shields i 'm looking for . 
  i 'm a perfectionist and i 'm looking for shields matching the knights helmets . 
  the ones offered on ebay are n't really what i 'm looking for . 
  i 'm kindof embarrassed not knowing what you meant and having to look it up . 
  i 'll definitely look into it , thanks for the tip !, 
  you dropped this \\ \\,

  western europe . 
  this is so old , even newfags are facepalming . 
  not sure if it 's true , but i heard that we 're earning a lot of money by selling water control technologies . 
  it seems plausible enough though .
