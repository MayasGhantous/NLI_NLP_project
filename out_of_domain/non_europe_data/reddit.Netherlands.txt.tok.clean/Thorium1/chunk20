  it might refer to lyanna , but she was never described as having kind eyes . 
  it could be something to happen in the future , but instead of `` he could almost see her face '' it reveals his mother in his dreams , just like bran met the three eyed crow and his `` third eye '' opened . 
  the mystery just makes me wonder what it means and if there is more to it . 
  that 's why i shared it . 
  it could mean something or nothing at all . 
  declare war on a nation and invite france into it . 
  if they accept , you are both in a war together and you can declare war on england without france , since france can not join the war against you while being allied in another war . 
  they 'll still lose it on their monarch 's death , but they did n't lose the title because they were literally unable to join the war . 
  prussia , ukraine and sardinia ? 
  sounds interesting , which country did you start with or did you use the later start date ? 
  i woud love to be a part of this . 
  `` really just look up random summoner names '', 
  aka, 
  he just searched summoners based on the word `` girl '' hoping to find a girl . 
  that 's pretty sad . 
  more like / u / _ vargas _ humor . 
   `` and her pretty cock . '', 
  pretty awkward i 'd say . 
  reminds me of a til post a while back about , y' know , [ the 5 year old girl being the youngest person to give birth . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_youngest_birth_mothers#age_5 ), 
  i believe it is indeed site wide like roerbakei said . 
  i 'm having the same issue while previously i could watch vods without a problem . 
  i 've played it for a while now and want to voice my opinion on it . 
  the game is not optimized at all . 
  the game looks a bit like mount & blade only runs terrible . 
  you can see the minimum requirements on the steam page and even with better than that you can expect it to run poorly . 
  logging out of a server takes about ~ 2 minutes , every server on eu is almost always full , combat is just awful as in `` good luck hitting anything '' because of ping and desyncs . 
  the game also has no message system to tell you if you disconnected or not , you just have to notice if npcs are static or moving or if trees do n't fall down after cutting . 
  ( you 'll still get the flowers if you cut them and the bushes disappear even though you 're disconnected , which is misleading as hell . ), 
  this is just my experience with official servers . 
  do n't know if it 's better on non-official servers . 
  also the fact that nothing is explained . 
  no tutorial or guide anywhere . 
  hp levels of any structures or blocks is just a mystery , a lot of items lack useful descriptions , starting out is just a trial and error run ( with a lot of errors usually ending in your death . ), 
  and building things is just something you have to figure out on your own . 
  ** tl ; dr ** the concept is fun and if it was optimized and has a decent tutorial , i could assure you the game is more than worth it imo . 
  ** in the current state i would n't suggest buying it . 
  ** we 'll just have to wait and see what the devs make of it . 
  it 's a possibility i have thought of , too . 
  it certainly would add to the shock value of the show , brutally killing a child . 
  i 'm also assuming we 're going to learn a bit more about her before they 'll kill her to make her death more meaningful to the viewers . 
  according to the imgur page . 
  they did n't cross a river and if i remember correctly the terrain in that specific province does n't give you any bonusses . 
  there is no defense bonus unless the terrain gives you one . 
   add to that the fact that you were outnumbered almost 2 to 1 it 's no suprise you took way more casualties than them . 
  probably the main reason , the enemy has 4k more infantry , 4k more cavalry and 2k more cannons . 
  because they have more units and are most likely flanking ( which increases their damage by a significant amount . ), 
  they 'll deal more damage . 
  the only reason you won is because they ran out of morale . 
  there 's some shit in between , i did n't create the album . 
  enjoy, 
  edit : http://girls.nwps.ws/index.php?dir=4chan%2fkyndall%2f, 
  this appears to be a full album , not sure if they 're all the same person but who cares . 
  i 'm suprised more people do n't know about the warhammer fantasy mod for medieval 2 total war , call of warhammer . 
  not one mention of it in the / r/games thread either . 
  i really suggest to look it up if you ca n't wait for this game . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/33735w/anon_wants_help_editing_his_family_photo/cqif0gc ), 
  like i said in the linked comment , she was a person that frequently goes to / r/gonewild and likewise placed on reddit . 
  gonewild is a place where people , mostly women , post nude pictures voluntarily . 
  she or most likely someone else posted the thread picture wanting the `` retarded eyes '' of her brother photoshopped and the photos came to light in 4chan . 
  nobody said to photoshop her naked , the pictures already existed on reddit . 
  that 's the story that i 'm getting out of it . 
  do n't know her name but people seem to be calling her kyndall . 
  why do you care who she is ? 
   his name means `` ambition overlord cruelty . '', 
  in my last 2 games i 've played burgundy has done extremely well without my intervention . 
  both times they did n't get the inheritance event . 
  the first time they managed to beat france and eventually got a personal union with spain , kicking everyone around . 
  the 2nd time , and this is a suprise to me , is when they used the hundred years war to their advantage . 
  normally they 'd suck on their thumbs watching france grow big but they actually allied with aragon and kicked france 's butt . 
  they got the inheritance event which kind of reverts everything , but they can definitely pack a punch . 
  probably to prevent doxxing or something . 
  probably charlotte hope , the person who plays [ myranda , ramsey 's lover . 
  ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3745225/ ), 
  the joke is that his girlfriend turns the temperature up so high that the hobbits mistake it for mount doom and throw the ring into the bedroom to destroy it . 
  as to why it is funny , i do n't know . 
  not my kind of humour i guess . 
  we can literally put cancer in front of any insult to amplify it . 
  i 'm used to it as a dutch person but from an outsiders point of view it must look weird . 
  according to the wikipedia source and other articles people in the netherlands did make the carrot orange . 
  it could also be a thinman , but since they have no need to disguise themselves anymore they evolved ? 
  it was my pet peeve of the episode . 
  they take ~ 10 minutes fighting a few scattered wildlings behind the walls but those tens of thousands outside put up no resistance . 
  i get that they wanted to have the whole hollywood fight scene , but it just kills the immersion . 
  also when he looks outside through the wall where there were hundreds up against it , and suddenly they 're all gone . 
  what was up with that ? 
  i 'd have my back against the wall . 
  [ it 's a trap !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4qzpbcfia ), 
  a lot of people up voting them are ` protesting ' against what they consider censorship and from their viewpoint , they 're right . 
  the admins only banned fph and a few subreddits while there is a list of hundreds of subreddits that fill the description . 
  except fph was the target . 
  the arguments : [ 1 ] ( http://www.np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/cs26fh3 ), 
  [ 2 ] ( http://www.np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/cs21c2r ), 
  [ 3 ] ( http://www.np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/cs20wu6 ), 
  now rebels can siege provinces without a fort in a month . 
  the new fort system is a great system against other factions but rebels are imo broken . 
  the 10 years of nationalism still apply when a siege is successful . 
   this is considered best of ? 
   * his point about varys is idiotic because he was headed to mareen ( if i spell things wrong forgive me i have not read the books ) to support daenerys , so it stands to reason he would show up at some point .
