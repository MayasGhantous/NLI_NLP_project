  i 'm currently looking at the top 25 on cringepics of this week and 8 of the posts are cringe at women .

  in the netherlands we consider women being 5 '10 and above as tall and we 're pretty tall in general . 
  it 's just a matter of perspective on an individual level , really . 
  it might be true that men give less about height than women do , but if you do n't care as a guy what height a woman is you can just go to a regular dating website for people of all heights . 
  if you 're a guy searching for a `` taller than average '' girl this website would be the thing you want .

  rotterdam has the most percentage of non-western immigrants though . 
  1 out of 3 people in rotterdam is an immigrant not from the west of the world . 
  but it 's true that immigrants like asians for example do bring the average down .

  i bet he saw [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ies5iu4odus ) `` pillow fight prank '' video . 
   the abbot of septimo , a very fat and corpulent man , on his way to florence one evening , enquired of a peasant he met , `` do you think i shall be able to enter the gate ? '' of course , he thus meant to ask whether he was likely to reach the city before the closing of the gates . 
  but the country-man , rallying his stoutness , replied , `` to be sure , you will ; a cartload of hay gets through , why should not you ? '', 
  i 'm surprised , even in medieval times people made fat jokes . . 
  i 'm curious how this makes him a jerk and an asshole , for just parking next to the car and nothing else . 
  [ there is plenty enough room for the doors to open ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zpughhl.png ) besides being opposite of the drivers seat . 
  is it because he drives a pickup or is this just an american thing ? 
  well , * technically * ... 
  it was n't a matter of relevant image , anyone viewing the video saw him cross the entire parking lot . 
  i just wanted to show that the guy did n't intentionally park against the expensive car , blocking the car doors . 
  i 'm trying to find the reasoning why he would cross the parking lot to do basically do nothing . 
  is he mad that the expensive car is in sight as a `` show off '' kinda way or what is his reasoning ? 
  plus why is he an asshole for it ? 
  i have faith in / u/fatherlorris to make funny comics no matter the game .

   the character first appeared in his current form in an 1850 book by jan schenkman and is commonly depicted as a blackamoor . 
  edit : i 'm not claiming it is the first time `` zwarte piet '' was displayed . 
  it is the first record zwarte piet is depicted ** as human ** and that it laid the ground source for the current zwarte piet . 
  seriously read the wiki page . 
  yeah , the wiki explains it further :, 
   in medieval iconography , saint nicholas is sometimes presented as taming a chained devil , who may or may not be black . 
  although no hint of a devil , servant , or any other human or human-like fixed companion to the saint is found in visual and textual sources from the netherlands from the 16th until the 19th century , [ 11 ] zwarte piet and his equivalents in germanic europe , according to a long-standing theory , [ 12 ] originally must have represented such an enslaved devil , forced to assist his captor . 
  this chained and fire-scorched devil somehow re-emerged in the 19th-century netherlands in the likeness of a moor , as a servant of saint nicholas . 
  [ 13 ] a devil as a helper of the saint can still be found in the austrian saint nicholas tradition , in the character of krampus .
