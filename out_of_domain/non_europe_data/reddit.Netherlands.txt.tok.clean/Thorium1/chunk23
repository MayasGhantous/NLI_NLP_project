  you 're free to give another source that contradicts it , but this seems to be the consensus on the subject . 
  the dutch also had a lot of holdings in indonesia,

  for the people that do n't know :, 
  the mods of 4chan made a fake `` spoiler '' for fallout 4 just for laughs that got a lot of people angry and now they 're doing the same to star wars . 
  the spoiler mentions that `` kyle ren nukes boston '' which does n't even exist in star wars as far as i know . 
  edit : apparently it 's a legit spoiler , i do n't watch star wars but i just assumed it was fake .

  banished is a good example . 
  it 's made by one person and looks pretty good . 
  the developer even recorded his own water sounds for the game . 
  they also wiped off belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg, 
  could you explain it for me ? 
  i 'm not familiar with usa politics enough to get the joke . 
  edit : thanks , ca n't believe i missed that . 
  at least na got free rp for the server being down while euw does n't , is down constantly and gets 2 ip win boosts . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ #ancientcirclejerk, 
  it triggered my fear for those security gates in stores that go off to prevent theft . 
  ever since i was younger and one randomly went off when i walked through . 
  now i have anxiety walking through them . . :'(, 
  pretty much what is going on . 
  although perhaps tasteless and/or cheap , it 's free marketing and gets people to talk about the game and the controversy . 
  [ link to the part ] ( https://youtu.be/tjmgdzy85cw?t=4m53s ), 
  compared to the one bomb dropped on hiroshima i have to rate this 1/10 . 
  but we 're talking about fireworks factory explosions . . 
  hardly anybody gives a shit . . you 'd have to be very petty to give a shit about that kind of thing . 
  the funny kind of autistic , extreme insecurity stories and shitposts . 
  as long as you do n't look at the circle jerk comments you 're good . 
  i like talking to the autistic people , then i can make references to / r/4chan in applications in case i want a job in a insane asylum . 
  the neet life is n't for me . 
  that was one hell of a roller coaster , i did n't know what to expect after each message . . 
  maybe they have n't reached the level requirement for flash because like 6 people in that game at 1:00 do n't have flash . 
  it 's not just rude and disrespectful but really shallow . 
  you should n't judge or ridicule a person based on their height . 
  the standard door height in the netherlands is n't 2.30 m . there are a lot of houses that still have the 2.05 m height . 
  that 's for future construction , not for the current buildings . 
  i was trying to say do n't come to the netherlands and expect every building to have a door height of 2.30 m. i could 've worded it better in my previous post so my bad . 
  king 's landing ? 
  it was varys however who brought it to robert 's attention , by giving away that she was pregnant . 
  somebody can correct me on this if it 's in the books or in the shows , but they also suggest the faceless men . 
  littlefinger is then the one that convinced them that that 'll be to expensive for the crown and that a lordship should suffice . 
  he explains this to ned after the council meeting since ned left it prematurely . 
  because the barrier does n't last long enough while the ignite ticks over time . 
  [ this guide ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/playrust/comments/41kdav/rust_settingsperformance_guide/ ) helped me out a bit, 
  do n't forget the 80 years war !, 
  now i think about it europeans history is filled with long wars . 
  `` i did n't agree to this . '', 
  best part . 
  currently you ca n't . 
  i believe chris ( the developer ) has mentioned something about balancing issues with slave armies and ai so it 's unlikely to be added in the future . 
  perhaps in the release ? 
  if you really want the slave master experience tho , you can free slaves from slavers ( only the ones named slave ) and there 's a good chance that they 'll join you . 
  although there is an easy way . 
  recruit people and just name them `` slave '' . 
  that 's because you sold the stolen goods back to another trader of the same faction . 
  if you steal for example from the holy nation , every shop owner that is in the holy nation will recognize the stolen goods . 
  i 'd suggest taking expansive loot and selling it to the western hive . 
  you can also sell stolen goods to a specific thief in bars for 25 % of the price if you hate the run . 
  early game is kinda a huge grind atm on v0 .9 if you really hate this part of the game then you can always train up a group in kenshi v0 .76 ( which is way easier ) and import them . 
  i 'd suggest using non-combative lucrative businesses like looting or thievery or mining to amass some fortune . 
  then just buy your units good gear and buy your way to the top . 
  if you do the group start though you might give fighting a small band of hungry bandits a try . 
  fighting as 1v4 + is just impossible unless you have pretty good armor/skills in this new patch since you 'll just get stunlocked by consecutive attacks . 
  a useful strategy i 've tried is using the taunt and block tactic on a few of your people . 
  give them a weapon that gives a good bonus to defence and use others to kindof 1v1 or 2v1 the others while one person tanks all the damage . 
  or you can always use the lvl1 skills strategy : have half your people fight and lose , pick them up with the other half of your people that stay clear of the fighting later . 
  in the current state leveling is just hard . 
  ai units have a pretty good upgrade to early game skills , you ca n't block beast attacks anymore and you ca n't fight big groups effectively with a small group . 
  in v0 .9 any 1v4 + is pretty difficult due to consecutive attack and stun locks on your people . 
  i 've done some searching and i 've found out that you have training dummies in this version too . 
  [ here are a few located in the city `` stack '' ] ( http://imgur.com/4iatpvn ), 
  there might be more in other cities . 
   - if your people get stuck on something ( mostly building a wall ) , just save and load . 
  all fixed . 
  you can also just have another person pick them up . 
  it 's much quicker . 
  he said `` big '' not `` tall '' . 
  just finish the username one first . 
  it currently has the same icon as a first aid kit . 
  if a trader has first aid kits they 'll probably have repair kits . 
  i know that the hivers have some at least . 
  in my experience importing bread does n't work . 
  at least i got like a lot of bread with just 1 nutrition . 
  i 've noticed a bug with building placements too , sometimes they wo n't appear but you can still click to place them . 
  this is easy for campfires but walls are a pain to place . 
  be sure you are n't in the area of a city because you ca n't build there . 
  also incest ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  my personal favourite has to be jinx and the [ diana theme . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-u2jdihbsc ), 
  in the bottom left when you select an door it should say either `` private '' `` public '' and if it 's for sale . 
  the smallest building you can buy costs 2000 . 
  there 's no way he got up that wall on his own without flying . 
  see 10:27 of the video . 
  the rock is way too far for him to jump up there . 
  you need to put the bread into a `` food basket '' the bread baskets are to prevent people from eating possible ingredients . 
  this is such an edgy opener . 
  @op if he responds with `` that 's the spirit '' tell him to fuck off / cut him off and block immediately . 
  you can buy dogs from one/some of the holy farms .
