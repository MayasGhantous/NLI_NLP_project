  you 'll have to be careful about what race the buyers are though . 
  ( you probably figured out that the holy nation are racist dicks already ), 
  so if i were to punch a wall would i and that wall be in combat with eachother ? 
  if the wall was a martial arts combat and i lost , would it still be humilating ? 
  how is this post flaired `` light/dc '' ? 
  it 's okay if you 're into a fetish but i 'd call unwanted gore and murder fetish erotica pretty fucking creepy .

  ah my bad , makes sense . 
  read it as light disturbing content . 
  can you make a screenshot of you trying to place the research bench ? 
  i 've had this happen often when stationing near the western hives . 
  i 've had when i made a campfire on the edge to cook some meat and every drone came to it to work on the campfire .

  one of your characters probably got a bounty for impersonating a faction member . 
  it 'll take time for it to disappear depending on how high the bounty is . 
  my dog got taken by greed instead of attacking me , so perhaps it 's a shield of some sorts that gets hit before your crown gets throw off . 
  i 've seen people call him the hermit , still no idea what he does though . 
  edit : i 've found out what he does !, 
  when he is on the back of your horse you can upgrade towers to a higher level . 
  if you have a tower that has 3 archers in it you can upgrade it to a ballista tower . 
  when you leave an island you take the bag of gold and the contents with you . 
  make sure to fill up your bag of gold before leaving . 
  some nice starting cash for the next island is nice . 
  and the ai gets free hundred trained units in just two days ; _ ;, 
  it 's a heartstone streamer that is known for being salty . 
  it 's a pretty niche reference . 
  i know that checkers have some salty people even though it 's a simple game . 
  it 's not about the game but more about winning and losing or sometimes people even search for an excuse to be angry at something even though they 're not upset for losing the game . 
  i know i have . 
  getting beat down is usually the best way . 
  hungry bandits are the best step to train up from low stats . 
  training dummies are safe but take ages and can only level up to 15 from lvl 3 dummies . 
  the white-necked raven is on average 20 inches , while the common raven is 24 inches average . 
  these things are more than a fourth of our length !,

  [ i made this thread with general tips .

  i have n't seen the new areas yet because i kinda got annoyed with trying to build on one of the islands . 
  ( you ca n't actually get there without exploits , which is a huge shame imo . ), 
  the best thing i can think of is training on dummies in stack til your fighting skill is level 10 and then start training your men on hungry bandits . 
  they 're the first step and then slowly work your way up . 
  you can try to take on 1 beak thing if you think your group can handle it . 
  they 'll eat the downed people but you could distract it with one of your healthy people and then carry the wounded guy out of there . 
  luckily you wo n't lose limbs completely ( yet ? ), 
  i know that in the jungle there are these pale four legged passive creatures where you can train on . 
  just surround them with your group and then order to attack . 
  if you hurt their legs or stun em and train your skills on them , too . 
  they also give some hides and meat you can use/sell . 
  base building is quite a big issue though , what exactly is a puzzle to you ? 
  there are training dummies levels , 1 level brings you 5 so level 3 , the max , gets you to 15 . 
  building requires a bit of planning . 
  where do you wan na set up ? 
  are there resources nearby ? 
  close to the village/town ? 
  is there wildlife ? 
  travel and use prospect so see the resources . 
  what kind of food do you want to produce in the location ? 
  the spot is very important . 
  the wastelands have a lot of iron but you wo n't be able to get any other resource there . 
  the jungle is fertile but dangerous . 
  you got ta explore a bit and really find a good spot or just start multiple outposts each with resources of their own and trade around between them . 
  to get started with building you 'll need to purchase your first building materials and iron plates . 
  best way to start building is getting your materials and iron plate production set up . 
  you basically just plop them down wherever , but when placing for example a stone mine it shows how much stone is in the ground , same with farms and wells ( the higher the ground the less water usually ) . 
  a house with a research table is also required to advance in the selection of buildings . 
  to research you require books which can only be purchased at vendors . 
  ( unless it has changed since last i played . ), 
  next thing is food . 
  you can hunt wildlife or purchase food pretty easily , but producing your own is a good start for the long term . 
  cactus grows in arid landscape , greenfruit and riceweed in swamps and wheat in plains . 
  you can do certain combinations to get better nutrional food . 
  ( as you advance in technology ofcourse . ), 
  these are the basics , i 'll let you discover and find your own way , it 's part of the fun . 
  let me know if you 're stuck though !, 
  i 've come across them multiple times in the general goods stores around the world . 
  they 're books but with a blueish background now . 
  perhaps try importing your game ?

  literally talked to the engineering shopkeeper in world 's end asking about ancient books , he sents me to the machinists . 
  the machinists send me to the tech hunters in the `` world 's end bar '' but in all 4 of them talked to everybody and nobody is designated for it . . 
  i 've been checking ancient ruines in the top left and so far i 've only found 1 ancient book in the 5 i 've explored . 
  edit : i do have to say the weapons i 've found set me up for life . 
  each worth between 6k to 21k . 
  not enough inventory space to carry it with a bull and 7 people each with backpacks . 
  a good to know , i intend to explore the world anyhow so i 'll come across them eventually . 
  my guess is on the gasmask blocking his vision , especially towards the ground . 
  the actual quote was `` they always cry in the kitchen but they cry with laughter '', 
  kinda important context .

  `` confused looking anime girls with interrogation marks on their heads '', 
  this a question mark also it 's beside her head not on it .
