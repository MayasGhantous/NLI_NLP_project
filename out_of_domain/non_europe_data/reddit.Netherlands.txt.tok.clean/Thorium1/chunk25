  i know how this happens . 
  your new leader increases his levy and garrison with his better marial score . 
  the levy is absorbed by the garrison and this is the outcome . 
  this usually happens when you have a good martial leader vs your previous leader having a bad martial score most likely due to wounds/disease . 
  pretty sure the prisoner recruiting is a result of [ this mod . 
  ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=726254871 ) have n't read anywhere if it 's possible to bail out and recruit them like stated above myself . 
  you can make your own cages and by talking to them , convince them to join you . 
  you 'll have to take away their weapons for it to work . 
  the reason i did n't vote for it is because it 's , imo , op . 
  muslims in general get a demesne income and morale boost due to how it 's easy to control your decadence . 
  add the special non-muslim tax bonus of 25 % on top if you 're a vassal , your liege can probably take care of it . 
  you get a free cb `` conquest '' which makes expansion inside a realm or vs small realms pretty easy . 
  opinion bonus due to piety is also a boost for your feudal vassals . 
  bonus if you 're sayid . 
  also in my experience muslim realms are so stable . 
  playing as austurias vs the umayadd , have n't seen a single revolt unless it 's a revoke revolt . 
  wroth is -1 diplo -1 intrigue and +3 martial . 
  my next step was fogmen . 
  just being on the edge of their lands , careful to not go in deep . 
  just be careful of their princes , their heads are a nice bonus if you can defeat them though . 
  i had 9 men . 
  i started out as a thief and worked my way up . 
  stealing loose items in shops at night in the holy cities , first selling them to the holy nation outlaws just north of the hub , then selling them in the hub ninjas after purchasing membership . 
  stealing gave me a big wallet , but i believe you can do with less , just being more careful . 
  the strategy is to hit and run , picking up your people that are wounded in the leg and setting up camp somewhere outside the canyons with camping beds . 
  i also stole a lot of food so i guess i had that to my advantage . 
  you can use conquest cb inside a muslim nation , not sure if your liege needs to be the same religion though to allow it . 
  kinda looks satire though , with the `` bible quotes '' like `` sarkeesian 4:56 '' and `` libelle 4:20 '' . 
  the original chick tracts is pretty die hard christian though . 
  can you bind attack to toggle on say , mouse button 4 or 5 ? 
  boy you 're missing out , you can use a [ vpn ] ( http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/vpns-still-work-netflix/ ) to get around this . 
  yeah this sounds amazing for my lazy ass , no more answering the door in my pjs but with jeans . 
  now i need a matching suit with tie top for it . . 
  well if your army is defeated they can retreat into the boats , if they do n't have boats/ports in the area it 'll be hard to destroy them . 
  other than that they 're pretty much useless .

  also the other deer corpse that you can see when the deer is getting hit by the arrow . 
  do n't you dare blame the sabre tooth you fraud . 
  damn those stuck-up , arrogant , know-it-all slavemongering elves , thinking they 're better than us with ranged weapons , the cowards . 
  wait , sinterklaas is a whole different thing than christmas tho, 
  edit : til dutch and northern germans do n't celebrate christmas . 
  my bad . 
  yeah but you can be a catholic tribal ruler . 
  i know in charlemagne start there are catholic tribal rulers in ireland and scotland . 
  mongols spawn with 100k event troops at least . 
  [ there is an event that a hole appears , suggesting that it 's a portal to hell . 
  you can either fill it with stones , feed it cattle or an exorcism .

  did n't there used to be a character modifier for bishops `` rumored to be a woman '' or something like that ? 
  might have been a mod though . 
  [ according to the dutch wikipedia page ] ( https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/diergaarde_blijdorp ) they built a 5 meter high rock wall [ shown here . 
  is african american limited to the us ? 
  i thought because of north and south america . 
  genuinely curious . 
  [ demonstration video .

  i would 've described it more like blow a kiss . 
  but it 's always useful to have 2 descriptions than one :\\ ^ ), 
  if you 're literal and upon succession your levy is completely empty , which can happen if your previous ruler had a martial skill of 0 and now a martial skill of 25 , increasing the levy and garrison , which means the levy gets absorbed by the garrison . 
  considering 3 times in a row would be unlikely , i would file a bug report on the [ paradox forums here ] ( https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?forums/crusader-kings-ii-bug-reports.680/ ) , keeping in mind that you need to login with your ck2 linked to your paradox account . 
  they do work like that as a tribal ruler but not as a feudal ruler . 
  my bad for not clarifying that , i assumed he was having problems in the former period . 
  not true , i 've seen immortal characters with more than 10 alive at a time . 
  there is a random event that gives you 3 options which the cat is one of or you can get one from a seduction focus event . 
  also as wotfan123 said keeping the cats to observe during that event chain and you get one too . 
  usually when i come up 1 too short i take a look at the optical drive or the hdd/ssd . 
  usually they have 4 screws the hold them in place but i believe you can do with just 3 or even 2 as long as you keep it in place . 
  alternatively you can just buy a bunch of them .

  the screws are called `` toothed hex 6/32 screws '' .

  i 'm impressed by the memory and the cpu cooler suggestion , real good advice !, 
  also the tower looks really slick , exactly what i was looking for . 
  i 'm just curious about the thought process behind the monitor . 
  side by side the specifications are n't much different . 
  my choice the lg is 75 $ cheaper and has an 2ms response time compared to the dell 6ms . 
  the dell does have ips but i 'm not sure if that 's really worth the price difference . 
  thank you !, 
  i 've looked at the prices in the netherlands and the dell is n't really that popular here apparently . 
  it costs $ 239 , - compared to the lg which is $ 119 , - ( 20 off deal ) . 
  the benq might also be an option . 
  i 'll look into it tomorrow . 
  thank you so much for your help and your time . 
  i 'm confident enough to figure it out . 
  also you 've given me a + advice !, 
  cheers !, 
  confirmed fake and staged . 
  i would listen to this advice , but some advice when looking for a motherboard :, 
  the things you need to look for are cpu socket , most high end video cards use pci-e slots which is pretty standard . 
  in this case the amd cpu works on a amd3 + socket . 
  every motherboard specification shows which socket they support and usually you can filter to show the socket you want . 
  also look at reviews for motherboards before considering them . 
  his heir is of his dynasty though . 
  his only remaining son . 
  searched `` rule 34 polandball '' , would not recommend . 
  shhh do n't ruin the circlejerk , move on or be called racist . 
  i like this rule , especially since the sub is named `` never tell me the odds . '', 
  that zoom in on the rock was amazing , well done .
