  the only problem is that you ca n't prevent people with multiple accounts and i have n't really found a solution to this other than the mods checking if every user is unique . 
  ideas are welcome . 
  edit : i just wanted to clear things up , i do n't want the mods to enforce this rule , only to convince givers to give equal chances for everyone .

  is there any way to access the battle.net `` app '' through a proxy ? 
  i 'm unable to access/connect to the battle.net app and play hearthstone probably due to the connecting being blocked . 
  ( internet connection issues , probably because people are downloading it through this special connection . ), 
  cheers in advance , direct me into another direction if it 's the wrong sub . 
  whenever i join a custom game with the game mode one for all i return to the server list and to others i 'm still in the game ... until the game starts and the server returns to the lobby because `` i '' disconnected . 
  is anyone else having the same problem or is it just me ? 
  i 'll be giving away a key to a random comment in this thread , just post your favorite card name and i 'll pick a winner .

  the movie was about two english gentlemen ( lords ? ), 
  whom were friends and joined some 18th century army . 
  i only remember a vague scene from the aftermath of a desert battle wherein one of the guys was blinded and lost in some old yellow brick ruins and his friend found him there and brought him home . 
  the ( near ) end scene was something of the two men on horses returning to the blinded man 's wife with a mansion in the background . 
  this guy does a really good job of voice acting the series and i think he needs some love !, 
  ( the first few episodes are a bit rough , but he gets better over time . ),

  i have n't seen all the let 's plays yet except the few first episodes , and i have n't seen anybody show the planning mode . 
  has any of the let 's players used planning mode yet ? 
  also a link would be appreciated !, 
  edit : i 'm pretty sure somewhere it was mentioned that the developer ( perhaps intended ) to make a planning mode where you could place buildings but they would n't actually be built . 
  this way you could make your city and literally `` plan it out '' before you build it . 
  perhaps it 's already there . 
  perhaps it 's just placing the buildings and setting the construction to paused . 
  can somebody please tell me what he 's saying in the intro [ here .

  i ' v been trying to figure out what it means for a long time now but never found out . 
  it 's in got page 152 of my book , jon 's first chapter on the wall . 
  `` not my mother , thought jon stubbornly . 
  he knew nothing of his mother ; eddard stark would not talk of her . 
  yet he dreamed of her at times , so often that he could almost see her face . 
  ** in his dreams , she was beautiful , and highborn , and her eyes were kind . 
  it 's during the argument with the blacksmith , donal noye . 
  just thought it interesting to share . 
  `` my friend wanted to feel like a princess on her wedding day , so i made her marry the slothful , ugly king of england , waited till they had children , murdered her husband and pressed their child 's claim to the throne instead of the original heir born by the king 's previous wife . 
  after that i killed off the late king 's entire family just for fun . '', 
  original joke :, 
  is when simon uses his hand to inject the venom into the heart of wau . 
  his hand is destroyed and you can see the human elbow underneath the suit ... 
  but was n't the purpose of the suit to protect him from the depth pressure and would n't the pressure just crush the organs ? 
  should n't he have died there and then ? 
  or did i miss something ? 
  i thought it would be a good idea to start such a post . 
  so share your tips/advice for the new v0 .9 update !, 
  i 'll start :, 
  - generally when you start try to avoid fights . 
  you can mine iron and copper to sell to vendors for the early game money . 
  it trains your labouring skill + it 's safer than looting . 
  - beak things . 
  normally you 're supposed to avoid them as the plague . 
  since this update their attacks are very hard to block and have a sort of area of effect basic attack . 
  but their eggs are worth 1500 a piece . 
  try to sneak into a nest and steal multiple eggs for a lot of money !, 
  - most of the towns with taverns are to the east of the map . 
  [ here is a full map ] ( http://imgur.com/a/rqpnq ) with all the locations . 
  [ credits to this guide . 
  ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/app/233860/discussions/0/365163686049720362/ ), 
  - before you start building your outpost , be sure to use the `` prospect '' button on the lower left of your ui . 
  it 'll show you the area and where all the resources are located . 
  you can filter them by clicking on each resource . 
  the default range is 400m but that range can be increased by 12m per sience level !, 
  - tips when starting a new outpost : when starting a new outpost i would suggest starting close to a city and expand/colonize further away later once you have functioning outpost set up . 
  when looking for a new outpost you need to know what kind of food you plan to produce . 
  on the top right of the prospect screen you can see the land type you have . 
  if it only shows wasteland then you wo n't be able to build crops on it . 
  greenfruit and riceweed do well in swamps , grain do well in plains and cactus grows well in arid regions . 
  when looking for a new outpost location , you can start without iron or copper but they are a pretty big part of the later stages of the outpost game and you might want to consider having multiple outposts for different things since it 's pretty hard to find a location with all of them . 
  i have n't found a use for carbon yet . 
  - you can use walls + small shack to reach areas that are inaccessible . 
  it 'll cost some resources but it 'll allow you to reach some pretty good bases . 
  you can also use this tactic to get onto the islands in the west !, 
  in order to do this you have to build the small shack in such a way that you can enter it . 
  once it 's build you can walk into it and dismantle it with the button on the ui . 
  the small shack disappears and you 're on the other side of ridges you normally would n't be able to cross . 
  i might make a video of it tomorrow if it 's still unclear . 
  [ example of a wall `` bridge '' ] ( http://imgur.com/a/v87il ) i recommend you to build them using 4 in 1 walls instead of single walls to save costs and to allow you to build ramps on them . 
  - books can only be sold by vendors at the moment , so be sure to keep that in mind when you 're building your outpost . 
  - you can kill nomads and kill their animals for a lot of stuff , including food and tradeables . 
  there are a lot of them and they are generally easy once you have 5 people or so with decent weapons . 
  they 're mostly in the wastelands west of the white area on the map . 
  - you can build in water ( watch the depth though and you cant build wall ramps in water . ), 
  and you can build buildings while swimming !, 
  - you can sneak while swimming and it wo n't slow you down !, 
  this might be a bug though . 
  also currently the drowning is n't implemented as far as i can tell . 
  ( yet ), 
  even though shop guards do n't sleep at night ( probably bug .
