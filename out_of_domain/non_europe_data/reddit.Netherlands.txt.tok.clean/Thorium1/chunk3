  zzzzzzzzzz, 
  he wants revenge on the lannisters for killing catelyn , on which he had a crush on . 
  do n't quote me on this , but it does n't seem his original plan . 
  his actions lead to the death of eddard stark . 
  since then he has been trying to get big ( really huge ) , perhaps to impress catelyn and save the day with the arryn forces . 
  this is speculation ofcourse , though . 
  patchface 's pov with him witnessing the events in the future but `` blurry '' . 
  just once , in the first/last chapter to finish/start off a book . 
   lady paramount of the trident . 
  i doubt that 'll happen , since she has no claim in the slightest to the riverlands . 
  the freys own the riverlands now , and i sincerely doubt they 'll all just die before she does , then there 's the original tullys and all the minor houses of the riverlands which hold some claim on the riverlands . 
  as a stark she has no claim to the riverlands whatsoever . 
  cressen arryn , knight of the king 's guard . 
  pretty sure it was the queen of thorns after she heard from sansa about what an evil boy joffrey is . 
  love it . 
  probably since you 're on your phone or something alike . 
  if not , then do n't mind me . 
  are n't they going to increase the price to 350 now though ? 
  all aboard !, 
  the reason they talk about, 
   a bunch of useless bullshit, 
  is a way for people comment on what could have been better and having game developers know what they should avoid in order to make the game and/or future games more enjoyable . 
  but you play league of legends , which runs on micro transactions , because ... ? 
  and the circlejerk hate ea card is activated . . 
  you are op , op . 
  most likely the purple one . 
  ( if it shows up on the show this season ), 
  it 's from the game [ oddworld ] ( http://legostevereviews.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/abes-exoddus.jpg ) . 
  it 's from the early bird special pack , giving a golden pistol and machine gun instead , plus 5 health/shield/salts bottles at the beginning . 
  somebody released an `` enhanced mod '' which is way better than the original mod . 
  [ link here ] ( http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?477004-released-submod-enhanced-0-53 - ( new-version - ( 01-04-2012 ) ) ), 
  also more realistic according to the books . 
  there are plenty of tutorials on youtube if you do n't know how to do it . 
  just search `` sansa hair tutorial '' and you 'll find em . 
  also the brother of tywin lannister ( ca n't remember what his name was ) made an expedition to valyria , although he never returned . 
  cause rule 34 . 
  a + + for effort , it 's not really that bad actually . 
  xbox live fees . 
  hah , [ spoilers all ] ( #b `` freys are surely the most trustworthy . 
  you ca n't go wrong with those nice people . 
  if his king/queen commanded it , yes . 
  they are actually for the lords of winterfell , but lyanna was an exception . 
  they would be rewarded in texas for waving around guns . 
   gf of 6 months, 
  so op is a pedophile ? 
  only a pleb would believe such superstitious nonsense !, 
  is this for na only or does it also apply for eu ? 
  there is a truth in what you say , at least , in my eyes . 
  it 's a harsh truth nonetheless . 
  although with the current system at the moment it does seem that smaller game creators using kickstarter as a stepping stone provide for a pretty good games for the future . 
  the player base simply decides whether they should fund the game or not , flushing out the `` bad '' . 
  and what i meant by `` bad '' is that some of those games are the genres that have a smaller community and/or fanbase and thus will have more trouble getting funded . 
  not exactly . 
  catelyn and beric are exceptional cases , whom have been revived by the power of the red god , if their priests are to be believed . 
  wights have blue shining eyes and have no thought apart from eating brains and all that good stuff . 
  all the gaming related websites i usually visit is 99 % of the time a forum . 
  i just love being able to view their news , discuss topics and give out suggestions . 
  / r/leagueoflegends, 
  in case the link 404 'd . 
  this shit again ? 
  that 's going too far . 
  even though people have probably watched this episode on t.v or somewhere else , please use spoiler tags . 
  cheers . 
  i guess he meant in the books he needs to get past the twins to go home , plus needs the freys to recapture the north . 
  i honestly doubt it . 
  perhaps if the person just is n't able to watch the series by following it every week / can watch it at all on his television , or is unable to find another source . 
  i personally love to watch a series/movie about the books i 've read , even if it might be disappointing with parts being cut and such . 
  [ it `` s like true terror ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gyxaeeoxjk ), 
  nah , he told them stannis the mannis is the man . 
  show fags do n't know about stannis . 
  knights and merchants is n't necessarily the best option , but if you want to keep some options open , go ahead . 
  i dislike the latest settlers and where they are going . 
  the best you 're going to get for a real settlers game would be the settlers : heritage of kings , ( number 5 ) or lower . 
  [ for the mount and blade fans . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3pengsuar8 ), 
  i can see jax and hecarim being one . 
  jax 's lore is about how he was unbeatable with his weapon and won 40 ( ? ), 
  matches in a row . 
  he sure was powerful enough with his old weapon . 
  iirc hecarim came out of nowhere and started to rampage through the countryside . 
  for the people interested : there is also crusader kings 2 got mod . 
  i also suggest using submods for westeros total war . 
  my favourite being fire and blood . 
  [ spoilers agot ] ( #b `` an alternative situation where in dany lands in westeros prior to robert baratheon 's death . 
  you can play as minor factions such as house darry , bolton , frey , hightower , redwyne and yronwood . '' ),

  i 'm not sure if the game is out yet in any other part of the world , but in europe it 's being released at the 17th of may , at least on steam . 
  if you want a professional opinion , you should check out some reviews , like totalbiscuit or any other for that matter . 
  whichever reviewer floats your boat i suppose . 
  could be either the goths or huns . 
  unless you were able to play as the mongols or slavic spawns later in the game . 
  ( i believe there was some way to play them . ), 
  even so , stannis could 've been named to lord of dragonstone and storm 's end . 
   he is n't too bad of a lol player, 
  to be fair , he only plays 2 characters which are relatively easy in complexity . 
  the item named after him , `` athene 's unholy grail '' is because he got his fanbase to give him the 10,000 referrals needed to accomplish that goal . 
  here is his latest thread of importance regarding the lol community , wherein he did an ama about him cheating on stream .
