  i do doubt that he 'll rush out the gate though being outnumbered and just sit back on the walls . 
  he might 've even kept his nose because lannister forces would 've been around and everyone would witness the deed if he were to be killed . 
  i 've ordered all 5 books from amazon and had not a single problem .

  westeros : total war mod for medieval 2 : kingdoms . 
  i 'd recommend finding the the fire and blood mod , for it , or any other . 
  the mod itself is lackluster . 
  and, 
  to add on this , ** stainless steel ** is a good representation of the medieval 2 total war campaign map , with more land and cities/castles , more factions and more historical accurate . 
  ** call of warhammer ** , takes place in the warhammer fantasy world , in the midst of the empire . 
  ** thera ** mod , takes place in a fantasy world of the creator , having historical locations and factions , like agincourt , roman empire , crusader states and the fatimid to the aztecs with the faustian reich having guns . 
  it 's a mod where the world basicly split in some great apocolypse . 
  those are just my personal favourites . 
  on top of westeros and third age . 
  most of these mods also have different submods , so be sure to check those out , too . 
  the picture itself does n't reveal much , but it allows the people to discuss without the use of spoiler tags . 
  plus , it might set off some of the more clever people on the subreddit whom have only watched the show . 
  every time i hear the name charles dance i ca n't think of anything else but him reading the passage from 50 shades of grey . 
  you know , the `` kinky fuckery '' line . 
  you do n't refuse a king that easily , especially when he gifts you something . 
  it 's most likely tradition , you do n't actually need to serve the seven or abandon the old gods when you get knighted . 
  to add on / u/isengr1m 's comments , she could in fact * rule * the westerlands if she had a heir by tyrion if tyrion did not become his/her regent , and thus sansa would be lady regent of the westerlands , just as cercei is queen regent . 
  same way tyrion could * rule * winterfell . 
  it 's not his by name , but his heir 's . 
  if there is no proper heir , or the throne decides to seize the lands , the king will inherit the lands and might give them away to some other lord/person . 
  also what / u/isengr1m means with his latest comment is that the king rules the lands , he gives it to the lord to govern and call his own , the lesser nobles answer to the lord , the knights answer to their ( lesser ) nobles and the commoner basicly lives off the land , and has to pay homage to the person above him , which in turn pays homage to the person above him and so forth . 
  personally , i learned from playing myself and figuring things out . 
  but even though i have 200 hours in it , there is still to learn , so do n't get frustrated when you do n't know everything . 
  now i know a person that might be able to help you . 
  [ arumba07 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgwcofx1nn0&amp;list=plh-huzmeggwdgedk0ytddsl2ni3zcmlf6 ) is one of the let 's players that i watch frequently , specificly because he plays a lot of crusader kings two and he has a lot of tutorial videos . 
  i 'd suggest you watch them on the topics that you 're interested in . 
  you can even just watch let 's play and he 'll most likely explain his actions 90 % of the time . 
  he also loves to dig around in the files and find find stuff out like calculations and even has experience modding himself . 
  also , i have heard that he 's planning on doing a lets play on game of thrones soon !, 
  is this a benjen joke ? 
  if so , it 's a little bit overused . 
  god i hated that show . 
   i think it woud be equally controversial if sansa willingly slept with littlefinger . 
  cersei did tell her the best weapon ( a lady ) has is down there . 
  the quote was about the field of fire . 
  well , honestly , if the lannisters are weak , that 'll make them even more dependent on the tyrells . 
  they are ambitious , might 've even be able to take over the iron throne . 
  that makes sense !, 
  bran = ellie, 
  edit : meant to reply to / u/reducedtorubble, 
  indeed . 
  it 's mentioned there is just one proper bridge there for a group to pass . 
  basically a choke point with probably archers up on some higher ground . 
  but they can always create a little raft and cross the bay of seals , just like osha crossed . 
  or just climb the wall . 
  casterly rock is build on some kind of mountain , with lannister port on the flatlands . 
  also , winterfell and king 's landing both count as one location with the red keep and winterfell 's castle . 
  yet casterly rock and lannister port are two locations on the map . 
  will you be streaming ? 
  you can answer the viewer 's questions in the chat still and play during it . 
  veigar uses his ultimate on himself in his confusion !, 
  it 's super effective !, 
  i 'm hoping to see what happens to them , just like the theon scenes that were added to season 3 . 
  i thought it was from an episode of criminal minds ? 
  she 'll marry daario rather than the `` hideous '' imp . 
  he promised his wife not to kill arya untill ados , so , she might just die there . 
  iirc grrm does n't like the idea of plot armor , protecting them from harm because they are an important character . 
  actually , he only said it on face book , as explained in the video . 
  the only thing lol related is that justin plays the game . . 
   the golden company does n't seem like the rape/pillage types, 
  ... yet . 
  we know grrm likes to explain that everyone is good/bad in their own way . 
  imagine if somebody 's game just crashes or internet falls out . 
  that must really suck for the person . 
   cersei is lady of the rock , tommen is heir , with myrcella after him , but as tommen is king he could very well pass it off to myrcella, 
  since cersei did n't have a matrilineal marriage , the children fall under the baratheons rather than the lanisters . 
  this means that another branch either inherits the rock , tyrion , or if cersei 's `` bastards '' ( currently they are acknowledged as trueborn baratheons though ) are legitimized , they can inherit . 
  actually , it was last hearth , house of the umbers . 
  it 's a northern town just south of the gift/brandon 's gift . 
  he was taken captive during the red wedding , although they do n't show it happen explicitly . 
  in the books [ asos safe for show viewers ] ( #b `` during the red wedding at the twins , petyr , merrett and ser whalen frey are tasked with getting the greatjon too drunk to put up a fight . 
  however , the greatjon is only subdued after eight men grapple with him . 
  he still manages to kill one man , wound two others and bite off half the ear of ser leslyn haigh '' ), 
  the reason i wear my flair . 
  the very same . 
  it does n't need to be 8 seasons . 
  they 're in asos and they are already stuck midway through . 
  there are just so much events , and the fact that affc and adwd ( plus twow and ados perhaps . ),
