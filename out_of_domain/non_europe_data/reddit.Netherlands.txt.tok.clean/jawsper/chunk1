  penis does what penis wants !,

  the new album by underground gangsta dupstep rockband la granja d'escarp did not sell as good as expected , but their loyal fans made sure they still made a profit . 
  it 's only $ 3 here [ ] ( / troll ), 
  oh wait , that 's like $ 4.24 [ ] ( / sad ), 
  what is this thing you call `` redditer '' ?

  tom savini , age 61 . 
  especially the derpbuntu with derpunity ... 
  i tried 11.04 , raged about derpunity , decided to format and put good ol squeeze on there and never looked back . 
  hodor ? 
  hodor hodor !, 
  oh hey , i actually have the same problem . 
  except for that i already went with staying in the target hear rate zone for two months , as i thought it would improve but it didn\u1e97 - i rather felt like i got worse . 
  so i read plenty on here , found a website where the zones are calculated based on your resting heart ( don\u1e97 have the link atm , sorry ) , as opposed to my watch which does it based on gender/age , and that told me i could go 10 bpm higher . 
  so now i doing that ... but supposedly that 's overdoing it now . 
  i 'm really confused . . sorry for the rant : /, 
  wait wait , is that in the latest episode ? 
  who says this ? 
  i must know !, 
  so you 're implying that shelters in the us are all rabbit unfriendly ?

  from my experience shipping from hong kong can be anywhere between 5 ( working ) days and over 3 weeks . 
  i have also noticed that there seems to be fixed days in which international orders get released by customs . 
  had 3 things ordered from dx.com arrive on the same day even though there was some days between orders . 
  i would personally expect it to be here in the week of the 11th of february , 
  tywin 's death was spoiled for me on the back of adwd , i was happy that it happened , but not that i found out before i got to the actual chapter :(, 
  does anyone know what song they 're playing around 7:45 ( just after jeremy talks about how lexus loses money on every lfa ) ? 
  that 's the one !, 
  i knew it was a song i know but i could n't figure it out . 
  thanks !,

  it depends on the characters , but some accents are impossible to understand if you 're not a native english speaker . 
  netherlands is the home team but does n't play in orange ?

  is this not what you are looking for ? 
  either switch can be used to turn on or off the light , rather than your current requirement to turn both switches off to turn the light off . 
  at my local hackerspace , they implemented a solution using ibuttons ( see the other comment for more info about that ) : http://tkkrlab.nl/wiki/dooraccess ( the whole page is in english ) .

  dutch pebbler here , got my pebble last week ( gray to black switcher ) , and i was lucky enough to not having to pay any taxes or fees , 
  tiny feature i noticed : the sports api supports pausing/resuming your activity with the select button , and it shows the app in the pebble menu so you can return to it even if you close it on the watch . 
  * edit * runkeeper does in fact support this . 
  not certain if this worked on the old firmware . 
  if you did n't end the flight , you might be able to copy the vessel { } data of your ship from the save to a . craft file . 
  i would double check this now but i 'm not at my desktop right now . 
  4 ) this would need to be requested from the audible app creator , since the pebble app simply queries the os for apps that can accept media keys . 
  seems like audible does n't do that . 
  * edit * it appears there is a german reviewer writing that the media keys stopped working in ics . 
  actually , that is normal . 
  the old crt screens make that high pitch sound . 
  i have an upper arm strap for my phone , and behind my phone it 's easy to put a creditcard sized card . 
  i suppose most of those work , but i personally use a tunebelt and love it , 
  damn !, 
  i also saw this , saw some red dots on the minimap , and killed all survivors because i assumed they were going to attack me . 
  then i drove off and crashed my car into the river , called a cab , stole it , and drove off . 
  i do n't think they ship , but i once found this site who seem to offer a large part of the assortment of alles vegetarisch : http://www.veggiedeli.nl/, 
  mostly the same prices , i guess they buy from the same distributor , 
  i also did this on my gamecube , and to make sure i never needed to do it again , i used a saw to cut a slot in them . 
  now a flathead screwdriver will open it up as needed . 
  though at some point before moving out of my parents ' i decided that the screws were not needed , and now i have no idea where the screws went ... 
  i did n't figure out all the tubes yet , but do not touch the middle tube !, 
  this appears to be the gas tube !, 
  these are your tubes :, 
  central heating out, 
  hot water out, 
  gas ( bad !, 
  no touching ! ), 
  cold water in, 
  central heating in, 
  edit :, 
  so the cold water enters in 4 and comes hot out of 2 . 
  and your central heating comes out of 1 and feeds back into 5 . 
  i think pipe 5 is where you want to add the cold water , but i 'm not certain .
