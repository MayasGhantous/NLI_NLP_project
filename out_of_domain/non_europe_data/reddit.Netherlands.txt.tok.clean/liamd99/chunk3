  modifying a car in the netherlands is allowed , your modifications must follow the rules though , and the rdw must check your car to make sure it does . 
  source : https://www.rdw.nl/sites/igk/paginas/wijzigingen-aan-een-auto.aspx, 
  i fully agree on ugly license plates , but that 's mostly because of the yellow color , and the rest of europe is not much better ( in my opinion ) . 
  but i think allowing the smaller plates ( in the front ) would make the ugliness less of a problem . 
  luckily i do n't like ( big ) wings on most cars , but i did n't know that . 
  i believe there is a little bit of a car scene , but it 's definitely a lot smaller than in other countries . 
  they want to make sure all cars on the road are safe . 
  for example , most front bumpers wo n't give you any problems but by having them check it they can make sure you do n't rip somebody 's legs of if you run someone over . 
  to me it sounds quite reasonable that it needs to be safe . 
  sadly i 'm not old enough to drive alone , and i drive my mothers car , so i do n't have much experience with the rdw ( our dmv i think ), 
  that is definitely an r33 . 
  did n't get to finish this today . 
  but i like the idea , and i 'll post the result when i 'm done . 
  you can drive a us-spec car in europe . 
  at least here in the netherlands it 's possible , there are enough dodges and chevrolets that are imported . 
  you 'd probably have to tune them for lower emissions ( permanently this time ) , and then i do n't see a reason why they could n't be imported to europe . 
  i wonder if volkswagen has any interest in selling these ... 
  my s3 is running nougat just fine via lineage os . 
  it 's stable too . 
  i could understand you not wanting to give a device with a custom rom to your kids though . 
  in that case i 've been lucky . 
  i 've been mainly using iphones since the first samsung galaxy , so i bought the s3 used a few months ago for $ 50 to play around with android ( and see if it 'll be on my next phone ) . 
  i immediately flashed cm , but i guess the previous owner did n't do the ota update then . 
  i have n't been able to find any problems on the build its currently running , apart from the horrible battery life . 
  i think that could be because of a bad battery though . 
  they blocked openiv . 
  they may say that it was being used for online modding , but it 's simply not true . 
  if you modify the game files with openiv you ca n't enter online , because openiv does n't allow it . 
  they just think now we 'll be buying shark cards because we ca n't play our mods , so sp is boring again and we will move to the online grindfest . 
  red is allowed here in the netherlands . 
  but people are n't used to red turn signals , and all cars sold here have amber turn signals . 
  i 'm pretty sure red is allowed to make importing a car from the us easier . 
  this is in the netherlands . 
  ( in big cities ) here vespas are actually really popular , even with guys . 
  these are not vespas , these scooters are cheap `` retro '' scooters , so your point still stands tho . 
  that 's one way of putting it , but yes . 
  edit : and preferably matte grey, 
  i 've lived in amsterdam all of my life , and i ca n't even imagine it being taboo . 
  when i smell weed on vacation it actually reminds me of home . 
  things like this just kinda funny to read . 
  last week i jailbreaked my mothers iphone 5 ( iphone5 ,2 ) . 
  when she tried to use her phone this morning it would n't do anything , when i plug it in the charger it gives no life either . 
  it does n't even show the apple boot logo . 
  we used the phone for navigation yesterday using sygic europe ( 1020 kilometer/630 miles ) . 
  we replaced the battery about a month ago in the apple store . 
  is there any chance the phone is fixable ? 
  and if so , can i just walk into the apple store ? 
  sorry if i missed anything , but i do n't have much time today,
