  edit : spelling, 
  one of the reasons might also be because these two are default subscriptions for some reason . 
  the other criticism mentioned about the quality can hold true and mean that these subreddits get undue exposure . 
  it can happen that someone was scrolling the frontpage and not paying attention to what subreddit something was posted on and think he 'd get a news story about some five year old kid that got electrocuted but instead get a creepypasta . 
  i lurked reddit for quite a while before making an account and i did it initially to get rid of these subreddits . 
  i can imagine that more people have done this . 
  i read the title as ` roman & greek weapons of world war 1 ' and thought that the supply problems could n't be * that * bad .

  i 've never bought a phone and i 'll keep it like that . 
  some people in my family keep buying new phones when their old ones still work perfectly . 
  every couple of years it 's ` my turn ' to get an upgrade . 
  with all the publicly funded support teams get in the name of the ` community ' it would be more realistic to call them partially state-owned . 
  in my hometown the city bought the ground under the football stadium and now leases it back . 
  only five years later the deal was officially ruled not state sponsoring . 
  that 's how close these things get . 
  teams get bailed out all the time because they mismanage their money and the city does n't want to lose them . 
  just to avoid confusion : footballer means footballer not handegger .

  the last two seasons ( three seasons ? ), 
  were spent on making barney and robin work . 
  barney changed , ted let go . 
  then the finale came and the show just said ` lol whatever ' and threw years of character progression out the window . 
  if they really wanted the ending we got all along they should 've canceled the show sooner and not spent all that time moving away . 
  that 's because it 's so narrow and easily used . 
  90 % of anglophone swearing is done using fuck and shit .

  people making legislation on firearms should be forced to shoot guns and pass tests on their knowledge about them .

  including all forms of sexuality , orientation and gender would make the acronym infinitely long and defeat its purpose . 
  anybody can express their sexuality in some way or another which is not covered by a specific letter yet . 
  by adding those the acronym would end up like lbgtqiayfbfudthequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydogoishdf . 
  unless we start imposing artificial boundaries on what counts as an acceptable orientation and that would be [ something ] ist .
