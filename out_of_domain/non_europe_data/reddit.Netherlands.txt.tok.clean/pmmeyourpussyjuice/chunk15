  he should n't have been shot . '', 
  also the poster seems to think that the eu language is english . 
  please do n't try to bribe people to commit fraud for you . 
  go to the nearest city hall and ask there for help . 
  it 's used to keep the long ending vowel long . 
  the * o * in salto 's and saltos sounds like * bro * and * job * respectively . 
  salto is also a the dutch word for somersault . 
  it comes from latin . 
  kamikaze0617 if you do n't speak dutch do n't try to correct others . 
  ask him how tall he is , bust out the tape measure you secretly brought along and ask him to prove it . 
  he 's on fire . 
   i 'm irish . 
   * when was your last ancestor born here ? 
   i do n't know . 
  also scrolling though his post history to see if i missed something in that thread i found this :, 
   i personally am a holocaust denier , i 'm just wondering why there 's all these people claiming that so and so family member was a victim of the holocaust when it was a hoax . 
  most people do n't drive a car since childhood but still manage to learn somehow . 
  yeah they really tricked us with that previous mission . 
  protip : the planes in 8492 always spawn in front of you . 
  if you turn around for a just few seconds at the correct time you can finish the mission without being fired at . 
  how do you know ? 
  if dogs taste from chicken to mud what is the human taste range ? 
   what the f asterisk number sign percent are you taking a picture of ? 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h42pgjg.png ) it is following the iec standard . 
  wikipedia says the squiggly resistor is in the us system of symbols . 
  the other option is ` international ' so i guess venezuela would use the iec system . 
  maybe / r/askvenezuela ? 
  same here . 
  was disappointed . 
  please explain . 
  please explain what is almost symmetric . 
  paint a picture that shows what you think what should be symmetric and one that shows what 's off here . 
  because now i still have no idea what you are on about . 
  what percentage would be acceptable here ? 
  and how much does the motorcycle actually cost ? 
  if they 're teaching exponents they are probably at the stage that anything that 's not y = f ( x ) would be confusing . 
  english alphabet ? 
  do n't you mean a version of the latin alphabet ? 
  i have no idea who sigur ros is and did n't notice any cameo from them . 
  i have heard of ed sheeran but did n't really know what he looked like . 
  in this scene it does n't matter if you know who ed is or not you immediately know it 's a cameo of a singer . 
  it would be bad teaching to keep switching up which letters are constants and variables . 
  if you are teaching linear functions and you have :, 
   y = a * x + b where y = f ( x ), 
  but sometime later you suddenly use, 
   y = a * x + b where y = f ( a ), 
  with * a-y * axes and the constants * x * and * b * you 're causing needless confusion . 
  it 's probably some object or maneuver called an ave that she got confused by . 
   \\* sings with a close up \\*, 
   it 's a pretty song . 
  i 've never heard it before . 
   \\* looks directly at the camera \\*, 
   it 's a new one . 
   \\* shuts up for the rest of the scene \\*, 
  how is that not a blatant cameo ? 
  arya even sits next to ed which magically puts him in frame every time she talks . 
  if ed 's role was given to some small time actor like any other bit part the whole scene would be different . 
  the singer would n't get those close ups , arya would n't sit next to him and he 'd get an actual speaking role . 
  what would be blatant enough for you to take you out of the scene ? 
  what if ed said :, 
   it 's a new one . 
  it 's a song that i , ed sheeran , wrote for my new album ` songs of game of thrones ' . 
  in stores august 1st . 
  how about they do n't use sneaky hidden costs to squeeze more money out of their customers . 
  i do n't think op would 've gotten the sauce on top if it was clear beforehand that it would cost a dollar extra . 
   ... unless you 're taking it in enema form . 
  wine 's proof is way too low . 
  you 'd vomit from the sheer volume ... 
  for a just moment i thought you said people would vomit out the wine that was put in their ass . 
  i should read more closely . 
  thanks . 
  it 's the correct glass for swirling a red liquid you barbarian . 
  they really edited her face . 
  luckily you can scroll down . 
  peta stole a dog from somebody 's yard to kill it . 
  maybe these people thought it was a great idea but they still need to give the dogs a home before they can steal them back again . 
  [ very funny ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7prw6y7lck ), 
  my dad once tried to remove a wasp 's nest with fire . 
  in our wooden shed . 
  luckily the garden hose was nearby . 
  is sweetheart the go-to word for condescending americans ? 
  but it also impacts sieges . 
  i was expecting that last option to allow recursion . 
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh !, 
  het is brabant of boten . 
   send, 
   the $ 1000000, 
  i was disappointed . 
   westerlands to reynes, 
  can you give fiefs to dust and bones ? 
  the scene was good . 
  the cameo was bad . 
  it was just too blatant and took you out of the moment . 
  of course the average game of thrones fan does n't understand the concept of suspension of disbelief so replies with ` but ice zombies and dragons are totally realistic bro ' gain infinite positive karma . 
  mcmansion strikes again !, 
  there are 6 hours between wendover 's video and this being posted . 
  100 % inspired . 
  the only winning move is not to invade afghanistan . 
  when the french established a colony there . 
  if all the murderers kill each other the murder rate will go down eventually .
