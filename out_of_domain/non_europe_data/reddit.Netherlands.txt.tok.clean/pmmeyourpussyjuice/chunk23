  i would too if that was the question because it 's the safest bet . 
  if the question was name countries that use the dollar you 'd get a different answer . 
  menards has real lumber yards !, 
  they do n't . 
  menards has real lumber yards !, 
  * they * do n't . 
  without any emphasis on they you 'd not pronounce it differently than the other words . 
  that changes the meaning . 
  when you read it a second time it becomes clear what was meant but you 're still left with the initial confusion . 
  not just lately . 
  half the conversations varys had had some a reference to his lack of parts . 
  that they lack the testosterone to be hardened warriors because they get cut when they 're prepubescent . 
  yeah . 
  you do n't need 5 cuts in a 4 second fall . 
   i do n't believe hurricane harvey is god 's punishment for houston electing a lesbian mayor . 
  but that is more credible than `` climate change . '', 
  [ link to politico saying it 's climate change ], 
  please include the beginning of the tweet . 
  this is a fucked up way of denying climate change , not a claim that god punishes cities with lesbian mayors . 
  she 's still a cunt that should be ignored but this is just needless sensationalism . 
  the static pressure is rho * g * h , density * gravitational acceleration * height . 
  the width of the column is irrelevant for the pressure . 
  intermediate calculation in metrique because i do n't really get freedom units :, 
  2 feet 4 inches will give 1 psi . 
  if you want 15 psi just by gravity you 'll need 31 feet 8 inches of elevation for the water level . 
  you do n't want to rely on a full tank that means that the bottom of the tote needs to be that high . 
  if you want to get all that pressure from gravity alone you need to build a water tower . 
  you could pressurize the tote but i do n't know if they 're made to handle that and you 'd need more research into that . 
  i suggest looking into a second pump mounted at the bottom of the tank to increase the pressure to the desired amount . 
  how the fuck can you get germany as a vassal ? 
  you 'd need to get a german culture vassal , feed it the specific provinces , make it independent so it can form germany and dow it to vassalize it again . 
  if the germany you created has too much development or you do n't have enough administrative efficiency and province warscore cost reduction you need to split it up in pieces and vassalize it after multiple wars . 
  arsenal of democracy and bbb2 are yet more meme-y wc runs . 
  the general sentiment that there should be some good achievements for larger nations is good but your ideas are also bad meming . 
  i 'm looking forward to this . 
  it 's probably going to be another episode filled with ` go home gamer girl . ', 
  and ` they leveled up . ', 
  material . 
  do n't forget all the [ fps gun pointing edits ] ( https://i.imgur.com/oezbzzw.jpg ) . 
  i very often spend a while googling the thing i want to post to check if it 's actually true and not a `` fact '' i got from a popular science magazine years ago . 
  a lot of times i see things posted here that can be debunked in under half a minute by literally googling the post itself . 
  it 's not always shaming for being wrong but shaming for getting elementary and easily disprovable facts wrong . 
  [ fake .

   -17,7778 ^ o c is really fucking cold and 37.7778 ^ o c is really fucking hot . 
  i do n't see why these temperatures specifically are useful in day to day situations . 
  i can see why 100 ^ o c is n't all that useful very often . 
  80 degrees and 100 degrees will both burn you and while boiling things you 'll just add heat until bubbles form . 
  but hey , you got ta set the point somewhere . 
  but 0 ^ o c is * very * useful in e.g. 
  weather forecasts because water ( which is everywhere ) freezes then ( which happens often ) and it has a big impact . 
   because you do n't need to believe in every position of a side to say `` i have more interests that align with this side , so i will side under them even though we have our disagreements . '', 
  in other countries there are generally more than two parties so people do n't ` have to choose ' the party that aligns with 51 % of their opinions . 
  do bot makers actually do something with the ranking ? 
  or the mods or admins ? 
  to me goodbodbadbot looks just like any other annoying spammy bot . 
  king harlaus constantly throws feasts instead of using his armies to actually fight a war and protect his cities and castles . 
  to throw a feast you need a number of luxury goods , one of which is butter . 
  so the joke becomes that harlaus spends all his time collecting butter because he loves butter so much . 
  mount and blade 2 has the subtitle bannerlord . 
  it 's a small step from bannerlord to butterlord . 
  the county itself is not special . 
  venice is valuable as a merchant republic . 
  get them as a vassal under you and roll around in the cash . 
  y = -1 / x, 
  bruh ... 
  why did i initially think this was part of a brazzers porn video ? 
  is it because of how the first shot was set up ? 
  guess what this meme is called on knowyourmeme .

  * flak, 
  you mean 3/16 of the subs of / r/ireland and 1/128 of / r/cherokee . 
  he edited it . 
  this is literally the 40k eagle + color + crowns . 
   welcome to / r/dontdeadopeninside , it 's for signs/media that read as nonsense if read like a book : from left to right . 
  the top uses the incorrect ( for this sub ) pattern . 
  if you need that many words to explain the look of the flag it can only turn into a terrible mess . 
  other guy : the flag of sweden but it 's the graph of y = 1/x, 
  me : y = -1 / x, 
  other guy edited to : the flag of sweden but it 's the graph of y = -1 / x, 
  i 'll just have one more bot to consistently report as spam until the mods ban it . 
  nope, 
   at what point do we decide that somebody 's condition is not worth treating ? 
  why burden the va with treating people with horrendous ptsd when we can just tell them to end it ? 
  ( actual example from the netherlands ),

  sideways austrian empire ?

  is that what they call not wanting to lose 20 trust now ? 
   welcome to / r/dontdeadopeninside , it 's for signs/media that read as nonsense if read like a book : from left to right . 
  the guy literally wrote a book called * make your bed : little things that can change your life ... and maybe the world * . 
  the start of the article explains the context for why he likes making his bed . 
  and there was much rejoicing ,, 
  you do n't have to censor the word fuck . 
  we get it : you do n't like the military . 
  this article is not sas . 
   ( the country , not the state ), 
  unless the state also has a city called tbilisi this would be obvious . 
   orleans , normandy , armagnac,
