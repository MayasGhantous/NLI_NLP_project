  good job !, 
  communism has never worked . 
  the only way for real communism ^ tm to work is to implement it in a society of altruism robots . 
  anytime communism is implemented and it inevitably leads to a dictatorship and fails there 's bound to be some fuckers to declare it false communism ^ tm to protect the holy name of real communism ^ tm . 
  whenever something capitalistic fails i 've never seen someone proclaim ` that was n't * real * capitalism guys !, 
  so you agree that communism is unattainable . 
  so why bother trying to implement another utopian pipe dream ? 
  ** stereotype and gross generalization disclaimer **, 
  black people are often seen as inarticulate by racists because they speak in ebonics . 
  calling a black guy articulate means saying ` huh , i did n't expect that black guy to actually talk intelligibly ' . 
  articulate is only ever used when referring to black people so it 's actually a racist code to use the word . 
  ** stereotypes end here **, 
  i would actually describe the weatherman as articulate and he 's in the top 2 most articulate weathermen i 've seen . 
  the other guy was posted a few days ago and also explained some stuff about hurricanes . 
  i 'm now aware that articulate is yet another word to avoid when talking with americans for fear of offending even more people .

  i 've never had a problem with matlab that did n't go away with that but did with a restart in the last 6 years i 've been using it .

  i usually block the `` hey , looks like you 're using an ad blocker ! '', 
  female rulers default to matrilineal marriage to get kids of her own dynasty . 
  only the same dynasty accepts a matrilineal marriage proposal . 
  if the ruler finds a matrilineal match why would she switch it to a normal marriage ? 
  maybe keep this on / r/weddingproposals or facebook or something . 
  the score of 0 indicated that nobody was interested in a repost from the day before .

  i had the same problem with trying to take over the divided russian dukes . 
  quite quickly after declaring a war i found out that all of them were called rurikid . 
  using the word articulate is apparently racist when describing a black person because it apparently comes with an implied ` surprisingly ' and it 's only used when describing black people . 
  if you sort by controversial you 'll see a shitfest with loads of comments calling it racist and loads of comments saying that it 's a correct use of the word in this situation . 
  that can only happen when the current emperor becomes ineligible because he ca n't lose emperorship the normal way during the league troubles, 
  why would you go to / r/food in the first place ? 
  he was n't really hurtful . 
  hearing ` huh ur ugly ' from someone who ca n't come up with anything clever ca n't sting . 
  especially if he would have made the exact same joke if someone else was standing there .

  baelish has n't been a core character for years . 
   do you know me to respond well to people telling me what to do ? 
  this sounds like a person that would go find the nearest crack dealer when they hear ` do n't do drugs kids ' . 
  if all the alcohol evaporated all the water would 've evaporated too . 
  this would leave you with a hard crusty yet greasy cake .

  say what ? 
  comments like this keep making sure that that sub is gets flooded with incorrect reposts . 
  i keep reiterating the main goal in the comments there in the hope that people will get it .

  99 % of the comments get [ removed ] anyway . 
   fun fact , there are ten times more americans of norwegian descent than there are norwegians . 
  that 's a hell of a diaspora . 
  that 's such a meaningless number because having 1/64 norwegian blood makes people claim descent . 
  it 's not like there 's 52 million people with 100 % norwegian blood in the usa . 
  the same guy above :, 
   blue = saved the world from the third reich and rebuilt europe, 
   white = fought a war to end slavery, 
   red = invented pretty much everything , including the technologies others use to shit on us, 
  how exactly is fighting a war to end slavery a good thing instead of just doing it diplomatically ? 
  we did . 
  16 years later we do n't do it nearly as much . 
  the 9/11 never forghetti did n't last . 
  it 's impactful because the usa thought it was the best idea ever to start two wars soon after . 
  it 's the catalyst for a new round of usa imperialism and all the terrible things that followed it . 
  the day itself and the event are not that important anymore for anyone outside the usa . 
  i do n't see people getting butthurt if someone mentions fabrique nationale or cafes on 28 june . 
  i was waiting for fifteen seconds for the images to show up thinking that the wifi was crapping out for a moment but no , the page itself was crap . 
  you took a screenshot !, 
  the only indication i can give you is that the machine gun looks like a ww1 style water cooled one . 
  i do n't know if they would still be in use around ww2 .

  it is literally the opposite of racism to not know the ` hidden meaning ' of the word articulate . 
  i 'm not from the usa so i did n't know some people use articulate in a racist way . 
  everyone uses words differently so any word you use will be used as a racist euphemism by someone . 
  a while back the words google or yahoo were uses by alt-right like types to get around google filtering words like nigger from their search results . 
  this would mean that the word google is now racist and ca n't be used anymore . 
  i mean how the fuck is it racist to use a word that in your mind does not have any racial connotations ? 
  it 's not discriminating based on race . 
  it 's not treating people of other races differently . 
  i saw an articulate weatherman and thought he was more articulate than other weathermen but the racism police made it into a race thing . 
   welcome to / r/dontdeadopeninside , it 's for signs/media that read as nonsense if read like a book : from left to right . 
  is the sas that / r/latestagecapitalism is yet again a retarded sub ? 
  the tweet read :, 
   if they did n't already exist , public libraries would strike people as the most outlandish left-wing idea . 
  it 's a showerthought but lsc of course changes it to mean commie hating propaganda . 
  loads of things are the way they are because they have been that way for a long time . 
  opening a library now if the concept would n't have existed would probably make it rain copyright lawyers .
