  how am i supposed to click on liechtenstein with literal pixel perfect accuracy ? 
  something like a middle mouse click to undo the slot reservation that 's automatically put in place sounds nice . 
  how exactly did tenacious d cause you to get into this crazy business before they even existed ? 
  we never got an answer . 
  why would they ? 
  small prop guns make your own guns look bigger .

  it 's a perfect blend of bfme 1 and 2 . 
  the trend is just saying ` science !, 
  ' , wearing a tshirt with a picture of some space thing on it and watching 5 minute summaries of years of work on youtube , not actually doing anything scientific . 
  at least its better than outright denouncing it . 
  are you really a firefighter of you completed the required training , extinguished one fire and then spent the next 30 years doing ted talks about it ? 
  being a scientist is a job . 
  why exactly is studying law something you do after doing something unrelated in college in america ? 
  i looked on the internet but could n't find an answer . 
  in europe you just start studying law after high school on a university level . 
  does it have something to do with a lack of standardization where everything is just called ` college ' and the level of education is based on the name of the institution ? 
  i recognized the hotbar and the repeated drawing of horizontal and vertical lines from factorio . 
  and then i looked at the comments . 
  i can just hear the * thunk * * ( thump ?

  the other half is just filled with metal gear references . 
  i 'd recommend getting it into a tissue or something , that way you do n't have to get it off your chest . 
  you attributes israel 's success to the people being jewish . 
  you brought race into it .

  did you just see [ this video ] ( https://youtu.be/gcdmp0snzge?t=165 ) by name explain ? 
  money dear boy . 
  for me it 's pretty normal because i 've switched the ingame music off after many many hours of hearing it . 
  they also misspelle tiiii-iiii-iiime . 
  i lost it when they said milligrams instead of micrograms while showing a mu on screen . 
  i have n't played the witcher 3 but if this is your only choice i suggest you play that . 
  da : i is terrible . 
  are those the only relevant bits ? 
  i could n't get through more than a minute of the video . 
  what kind of party were they at ? 
  i did n't read any reference to alcohol or drugs , just sugar .

  austria has an event to get the von habsburgs back if they have a foreign dynasty on the throne . 
  does n't the us congress have fascist [ fasces ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xl7vw4r.jpg ) ? 
  richard has n't had the power to be a dick and get away with it in general . 
  when he gets some power/leverage he can be pretty mean . 
  he busted blood boy with the drugs and went on a crazy rant about normies all because he talked in a meeting . 
  he also broke up with his girlfriend over tabs vs. spaces . 
  to me it looks like richard could turn into a gavin ( light ) if you put him at the head of a huge corporation for 20 years . 
  either something that shows you are very rich and open do gold diggers like a lambo or a ` cute ' car like a convertible beetle .

  why the hammer and sickle for austria ? 
  for those that do n't know ( like me until i accidentally clicked after looking for 10 minutes ) the images have some text below them if you click on them . 
  they have their own guesses . 
  i would n't even have recognized the packs of cigarettes or boiler as being those things without the help . 
  it does n't get me further in identifying but still . 
  the shirt picture is also mirrored . 
  anyone can design a large concrete block with a small hole in the bottom to let people through . 
  with another style of accent interpretation of his keyboard it 's easy to mace special letters with typos .

  all you do is bitch about ` flag rules ' , a.k.a. 
  common sense , being some form of oppression and call any ugly design good because it was made an official flag decades ago .
