  ( not sure on this ), 
  tobi `` so high '' wan kenobi, 
  yes of course . 
  but we were talking about python here , 
  i think you 're technically looking for naive . 
  it 's his personal twitter . 
  he 's not making these tweets so people on reddit get excited i hope . 
  not . . 
  doctor ? 
  people actually eat french fries with cheese ? 
  sure but it seems like it caught him by surprise . 
  as you can see he did n't anticipate the landing very well and just kind of fell on his face ... 
  which afaik is not used for online tournaments . 
  but only for big lan ones . 
  humanity 's saddest right here . 
  tells me he 's made approximately 0.001 comments per minute . 
  ( going with a 48 hour account time , i do n't know the timezone redditinvestigator goes by and the time since account was made was suffering from some kind of bug . 
  ( showing negative values ) ), 
  yea i like feeling stuff as well . 
  mandatory 5 rapier + branch mention . 
  i thought reddit liked grammar nazis ? 
  what happened to this place ? 
  it looks more like a mixture of scandinavian languages to me . 
  which is i think what the guy was going for . 
  you mean * rip in peace billy mays, 
  then ok, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ all ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ aboard ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ negative ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ karma ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ train . 
  smash your monitor . 
  wtf !, 
  what is this black sorcery ? 
  what the fuck fucking gross why is there no ultra nsfw wtf tag for this my mom expelled me from her house when she saw what i was looking at, 
  so you are telling me linkfixerbot has now become a sentient machine ? 
  yes he is . 
  so meta . 
  so are youtube and facebook and probably countless other things . 
  most of these have a chinese , censored counterpart . 
  so which one is it ... ? 
  use science !, 
  so . . zero is nothing then ?? 
  edit : i 'm confused : s, 
  and blood veins . 
  just a tiny correction :, 
  `` bakken baarmoeder '' would be containers/bins with uterus inside it whereas `` gebakken baarmoeder '' would be fried uterus . 
  some examples ? 
  i 'm curious . 
  i thought this subreddit was called / r/interestingandorweirdandorfunnyandorawesome now, 
  put ... put your dick in it, 
  maybe it 's just me but i did n't know mimes were a race . 
  do n't think so . 
  and i do n't really think it is viewed racist towards asians to have martial arts inspired pokemans . 
  maybe it 's just me but this thread was about racial stereotypes . 
  maybe you should try reading the actual comments before commenting . 
  thanks for that . 
  and yea last i checked pokemans was japanese not american ... 
  takeshi 's castle best show ever . 
  ( at least that 's what it was called here ), 
  why didnt you post this in / r/poemeta ?? 
  you just manually made it a link which is a lot of hard work . 
  all you have to do is add a / before the r/coffee like the linkfixer bot did and reddit automatically creates a link . 
  edit : hi linkfixer bot !, 
  what i watched from it here on the dutch comedy central was japanese cut footage with dutch voiceover . 
  some pretty funny shit at times . 
  all hail army . 
  gebakken means baked/fried . 
  baby container would be baby houder/bak, 
  so you 're saying you are almost sure the results are legit ? 
  you mean war !, 
  everyone who does n't wna go to war and kill civilians for the luls is obviously gay . 
  ( like the south park episode ), 
  usa is a pretty major human rights offender as well i 'm pretty sure . 
  from keeping pow without a trial and torture to on purpose mowing down civilians from inside the safety of your helicopter and getting joy out of it . 
  the latter was on video online for a while but i would be surprised if they are the only warcrime commiting soldiers in all these wars against freedom . 
  edit : i guess wars for oil probably fits pretty goid as well . 
  joke 's on all of you i 'm writing this from outside spacetime where all to-be-born souls linger . 
  why do people use autocorrect , then constantly have trouble with it and then just continue using it ? 
  well ? 
  potato, 
  fair enough . 
  i 'm not fond of it myself since we transferred from 9 button typing to touch screen . 
  is it slowly changing into something completely irrelevant like / r/wtf ? 
  which has by now evolved into / r/interestingandorawesomeandorcoolandorcreepyandornsfw, 
  i know . 
  i see i poorly worded my comment . 
  what i meant was that it is slowly changing like / r/wtf into something that is completely irrelevant to the whole idea of the subreddit . 
  i 'll edit my comment above a bit . 
  there exist others ? 
  t9 was amazing . 
  ( and still is i guess ), 
  i remember how fast i used to type on my samsung cybershot ( i think was the name ? 
  pretty irrelevant ), 
  it used t9 with the ability to add words to it and it did a great job prediction which word i needed ... 
  pretty bad to see that typing technology is worse now on my smartphone than it was 5-6 years back with a midrange mobile phone . 
  edit : also regarding physical keyboards on phones . 
  i saw a video of some new technology which provides tactile feedback for typing on a touchscreen . 
  not sure on where that video is or what the technology was called tho :\\ . 
  if a keyboard popped up on the touchscreen they used some kind of fluid to create bumps on the surface of the phone where the keys are . 
  so this way you get some feedback as to where your fingers are . 
  lel it 's 0ver 9ooo !!, 
  and get some cum spraying over the enemies . 
  it 's a relic from the past , cherished as a tradition in most countries that still have a monarchy .
