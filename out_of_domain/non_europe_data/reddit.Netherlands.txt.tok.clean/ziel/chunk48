  maybe in programming , but in real life i would say often not . 
  at least he has the decency to keep them to get rid of them properly afterwards instead of tossing them into the water mindlessly . 
  even between two simple things as notepad + + and github there was a lot of inconsistency . 
  luckily notepad + + let me easily convert those tabs . 
  druid claw, 
  genuine question , but how would you cheat in tabletop mtg ? 
  or do you mean mtgo ? 
  all i can come up with is using your phone in the bathroom or having a friend sneak a peek at the opponents hand . 
  that sausage made me so hungry . 
  it looks delicious !!!, 
  i definitely would n't be able to fit that on one line when viewing 2 files side by side on my laptop . 
  viewing 2 files side by side on a smaller laptop screen is probably a fairly common scenario . 
  how people have started calling this positive discrimination is beyond me . 
  it is as negative and baseless as ever . 
  ` sorry , but even though you are perfectly qualified we ca n't hire you because we already filled our men quota ' does n't even sound positive to me at all . 
  stop fishing . 
  this guy will bend himself in any shape to not admit his employer is discriminating . 
  this means open on us i assume ? 
   thousands of stars, 
  i 'm no expert but i think you are off by a lot of orders of magnitude . 
  there are probably a ton of galaxies in the picture . 
  a lot of them will through merch or even donations . 
  lewis was right about the pantheon thing i think . 
  if both players have exactly enough faith to get a pantheon this turn , only 1 can pick it . 
  after 1 person has picked it the faith requirement goes up which means the other person may no longer have enough faith . 
  this is just an intended side effect of playing multiplayer where everyone takes their turn simultaneously . 
  i have n't played that much since the changes , but so far i like the timers . 
  it feels like there is a lot more action/intense moment because both players always know the exact timing . 
  it is probably because we sucked at keeping track of the timers before . 
  now every item pickup can be contested because both players know the timer , so it seems to me that there are a lot more engagements . 
  how about just using html and hyperlinks . 
  if all you want is a table of contents and hyperlinks ... 
  i 'm so jealous of your murdering prowess, 
  yeah !, 
  did n't everyone know only white people can be racist ? 
  let 's go kill some racist whities ( read : anyone who is n't the deepest darkest black ) together !, 
  maybe an even better idea : let 's just round up all the racist white people and use them as slaves for the non racist black people ( read : all black people ) !, 
  seriously , saying that you should n't care about white people because they are n't black is the most retarded thing ever . 
  i do n't even know why color matters so much to americunts . 
  it 's like saying you should n't care about black people because they are n't white . 
  either that or make the pothole bigger , shaping it like a penis . 
  which words exactly ? 
  i 'm not sure you know what buzz word means lol . 
  did n't know europe was that big , or is that what they teach you in the american educational system ? 
  using your logic you might as well say ' i take it he 's north american ' because costa rica uses a ' , ' decimal seperator . 
  mods are allowed to send death threats ? 
  but if you do crosspost should n't you always put the original subreddit in the title ? 
  going by that only the one with x-post / r/funny is technically a crosspost . 
  the others either did n't know this or tried to spin it as something new they just discovered . 
  better give the us server some free packs to compensate !, 
  this is n't very reliable though . 
  for almost all games that do this it always says intel integrated for me even though it is using my discrete card . 
  even in reflex this feature does n't report correctly for me . 
  `` cheese '', 
  it 's an issue with some mobile reddit apps people say . 
  not sure why that still is not fixed though , i first saw people complaining about it a long time ago . 
  you could probably also solder , it is not that hard , ask your gran to teach you how to do it !, 
  look at this : butthurt americans because of their broken murica circlejerk in their natural habitat . 
  in what context did valve use this ? 
  i thought it came mostly from blizzard saying that too many deck slots in hearthstone would be too confusing , which is probably equally ridiculous . 
  but if you would take away guns you would take away gun accidents . 
  then there will be less accidents than with guns most likely , unless suddenly all ex gun owners all go do more dangerous activities instead . 
  edit : i was just pointing out how that guy 's logic was extremely flawed . 
  i did n't really intend to argue with american gun nuts , because you ca n't win anyway . 
  works fine for me on mobile using chrome ( or reddit is fun for that matter ) . 
  so it does n't seem to be an issue with imgurs mobile site . 
  would n't it more likely be an issue with the in-app browsers of those affected reddit apps ? 
  i do n't think imgur would n't fix a bug accidently serving porn to customers after years and years . 
  there 's probably swimming lessons you could take if you really wanted to learn it . 
  it 's almost as if the usa is n't the center of the universe , or even the earth !, 
  are there really 12 lanes merging into 2 near the bottom ? 
  if so , that 's insane . 
   as it 's not a chemical reaction, 
  still do n't get how this comment is still posted in every thread on this sub . 
  literally the only way the mods can make it more clear that ** physical reactions are allowed ** is by removing the sub and replacing it with a huge image saying ** physical reactions are allowed ** . 
  seriously , everywhere you look in this sub it says in huge , fat letters ** physical reactions are allowed ** . 
  yet in every physical reaction post ( which are ** allowed ** ) there are a bunch of retards saying it 's not a chemical reaction . 
   the official reflex race mode which is coming soon . 
  any source ? 
  ca n't wait for this . 
  i know it 's coming at some point , but thought it might take a while since i did n't think it would be very high priority . 
  it worked great for me on a 4.5 inch screen size compared to your 5.2 ( i think ? ) . 
  i can see how it could be a problem if you have disgustingly fat fingers but so far i have n't had any problem with it . 
  you could just turn it off in the google settings on your phone . 
  at least they are also doing good stuff with it . 
  like using it for the traffic overlay for google maps i think . 
  i personally turned it off the first moment i got an android phone . 
  i do n't have anything to hide , but i do n't see why i should have to give them access to my location at all times . 
  that was the reason for me to opt out as i said , but i will agree with you that it is n't so obvious to a casual user that it is even happening . 
  laughing : downvote train edition, 
  there 's no way that fide can do something like this on accident , is there ? 
  if not , then why would they do it like this ? 
  do they just not care about other big ( is it big ? ), 
  events running at the same time ? 
   if you did n't like what they made that day , then you did n't eat because that was the only option . 
  how about bringing your own food ? 
  surely that would also be cheaper than buying food at school ( or was the food at school free ? 
  but you could say the same about any game . 
  `` it is n't viable because it is only on windows . '', 
  i like pcs too but you seem to completely disregard the consoles as having a combined < 1 % gaming market share ?
