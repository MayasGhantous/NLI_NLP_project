  verify your account , and you 're free from the restriction . 
  ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ bit ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ restriction ^ ^ ^ though . 
  sorry , i 'm not into small talk . 
  `` that shirt looks very becoming on you , but i suppose , if i were on you , i 'd be cumming too . '', 
  `` cap'n , we 're surrounded ! '', 
  `` i 've shit me pants , john ! '', 
  good guy sarukaitee, 
  i feel you . 
  good girl sarukaitee, 
  go with your love , but still see your kid . 
  i suppose wait it out . 
  i do n't know man , i feel bad for you . 
  u wot m8 ? 
  currently trying to learn c++ among other things , can confirm it is a good skill to have . 
  although you were talking about cats and titties , i did indeed put nsfw . 
  i 'm reading that jumping into c++ ebook , it 's really helpful . 
  i did  and okay yeah i was gon na , but it 's fine . 
  thanks, 
  no i still want the clock there , just not the four down the bottom , and dragging just deletes wholenclock . 
  it just deselects it when i try resize ? 
  time does n't show . 
  14ms response time on those monitors ? 
  we have a winner !, 
  thank you , there were multiple locations set . 
  thanks heaps  no more annoying clocks . 
  oh right , i was imagining trying to move your mouse around with that response time . 
  the bezel looks really wide , does it interfere much ? 
  or do you tend to use separate screens for separate things ? 
  i live in new zealand , nearly wednesday !, 
  just wondering , why would n't you notice performance difference if it were smaller , because it 's the same resolution is n't it ? 
  is n't it pixel density does n't effect performance but resolution does ? 
  i would also like to know this , somebody pls respond . 
  best low cost water cooling ? 
  u wot m8 ? 
  yeah but who follows those things anyway ? 
  from what i know , it 's sorta like `` bridging '' ssd/hdds , and they form as one , and there is an increased speed . 
  i think it is also less reliable . 
  i 'm not entirely sure though , watch [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rybtmvmth1g ) video for more . 
  i see , i thought he was talking about performance sorry . 
  that would mean you have no memories ? 
  who did let the dogs out ? 
  he was talking about inside the * hospital . 
  what was `` up '' ? 
  that 's how i 'd assumed how most people work out memories from when they were really young , i remember from like 6th grade because that was n't a long time ago , but like memories from when i was 3 for example , the only reason i can tell i was 3 is because i was in kindergarten/preschool . 
  ooh , 2sneaky4me . 
  yeah i never did bother reading the whole thing . 
  just skimmed it . 
  link ? 
  on a scale of 1-10 , how much do you like your job ( 1 being least ) ? 
  * edit : also why ? 
  commenting so i can save later as i 'm on mobile . 
  this is * build a pc * , so i thought people that build computers might be interested in pc parts , specifically parts that are of importance . 
  i care :(, 
  i imagine s/he never leaves . 
  i could n't capture mine in one image , album coming right up . 
  what tone are you using here ? 
  ^ ^ ^ hard ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ tell ^ ^ ^ through ^ ^ ^ text . 
  can we do something else , i do n't have kik :(, 
  not sure if doing what was said above , or genuine . 
  i 'll go with first one . 
  eyyy , i 've seen you here before . 
  aw thanks , 
  or having them not reply , or not really knowing them , or not being interested , or all going away . 
  mainly them all combined ( including being a little bitch ) . 
  for what though ? 
  it is n't that easy though , `` new girls '' all hang out with `` popular '' people , who in turn hate me . 
  the girls i do go near are n't interested . 
  i will some day , do n't you worry . 
  like ? 
  i saw this on one of the battlestation subreddits ? 
  ninja edit : it was teenagers nvm . 
  [ could n't be fully captured in one shot ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ozkfo ), 
  i do , but i still get lonely :(, 
  okay sure but no girls are nerds wherever the hell i live . 
  literally.none . 
  i will talk to a random girl right now at 1.33 am for you though . 
  been applying for jobs . 
  yeah okay , i will take your advice . 
  i will grow a singular testicle . 
   you need to have something that you have a passion for, 
  i know i love computers , and i can photoshop average and stuff , but i really want to build computers , and i feel that this would indeed pick me up . 
  i am trying to learn code , but i really want to build a pc , but i do n't have much ^ ^ ^ . 
  ( any ) money for it . 
  but i am indeed saving and know that computers and shit is what i really want to do , but i seem to have gone with a very costly hobby . 
  i am learning new stuff to keep myself busy , and i work at my dads work , and i race cars , and i do all this other stuff , but i really want to build computers , so for now , i keep myself busy while i save . 
  cost money , no job no money . 
  i 'll prob just use my sisters membership or something . 
  that 's actually amazing  thanks , although i 'll just sell things . 
  i have n't seen you here before though . 
  its actually really nice to use . 
  not a word of a lie i live in the middle of nowhere and the nearest place is way out of walking distance , i 'll just walk around . 
  okay thanks c :,

  hey there . 
  ^ ^ ^ you 're ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ girl ^ ^ ^ right ? 
  asking if she has a boyfriend could be awkward , could you find out through somebody else ?
