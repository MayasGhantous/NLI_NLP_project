  april stewart, 
  but since we have n't experienced that yet , this is the worst we have had it , and thats probably why most teens ( including me ) hate it . 
  we find our lives the most difficult they have been . 
  plus we usually hear about the dream life and all of that from tv , so our expectations are set high , and we just do n't want to be a teenager . 
  you ca n't tell me that , as a teen , you did n't find it challenging . 
  i do n't know when you grew up but it sure is now , there are indeed a lot of expectations that we are expected to meet , maybe not as much as an adult , but still a lot . 
  ** tl ; dr , we do n't know what it 's like to be an adult .

  [ he is the biggest role model . 
  he is my hero . 
  i look up to him so much . 
  he has a stable job , he is smart , he has the best voice . 
  and trust me ... he is no lemon ... 
  he is the best . 
  i wake up in the morning hoping that one day , just one day , i may be like him . 
  can play an instrument like a pro , something one day i can only hope to do . 
  although he has been banned in the great , he still inspires me , and this shows me that if he can do it , i can do it . 
  he is the most chill man ever , he never gets angry , and he has a phd in everything . 
  i just look up to dan like an ant looks up to a flower , or people to buildings , he is there , keeping me safe , and sheltering me from all the harm this cruel , cruel world can bring . 
  i believe dan tries his hardest to please everything , and if he ca n't he still tries his best . 
  i know i may be rambling but he is honestly the best man , the only man , that can truly bring great into this world . 
  thank you and goodnight . 
  you all know who he is , it 's been said before . 
  you commented literally a month ago ? 
  thank you , you are the best .

  sir , i was pulling you over for for going 5 over the limit . 
  what ? 
  if there were souls , you would sell them to the devil ? 
  it was [ the ol' reddit switcharoo ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1kn95k/this_is_what_lily_looks_like_with_the_switch_in/cbqrapm?context=2 ), 
  i would go with the first one , it has a better motherboard , which has 8 sata 6gb/s , and also supports sli , so although you have a slightly worse gpu , the motherboard makes it more upgradeable . 
  you also have a bigger hdd and an ssd so if using as a boot drive it will be faster , also faster loading times for other things you put on there , games etc. 
  it is also cheaper and i personally like the case better . 
  both pc 's should run your games pretty well , but personally i do n't think the 780 build is worth the sacrifices and more expense . 
  * edit : * why is the unlocked processor cheaper than the locked one ? 
  760 should be fine . 
  `` how the guy in the computer store thinks the cpu is the most important for gaming '', 
  he actually wants to melt his computer , and that 's why he did n't listen at all .

  he should n't dump her , to me this seems more like a dick move , let her decide . 
  you ca n't just be like , `` we 're over , oh and i cheated on you '' he needs to tell her and let her decide .
