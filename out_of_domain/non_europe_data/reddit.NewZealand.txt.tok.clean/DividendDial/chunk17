  am ocd . 
  she got out of the shower and took the photo . 
  was gon na write that . 
  definitely should n't have . 
  which doing what she did here ruined it even more ... 
   if you found this then i killed myself . 
  so if she does n't find it , she has n't killed herself ? 
  can confirm . 
  i am lukes father . 
  even then . 
  so that 's 5-6 years difference . 
  i just laughed in the middle of class . 
  i showed the teacher and she laughed too !, 
  too funny . 
  so you 're saying ... you got your pussy wet ? 
  [ just watch it and some of his other lectures ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmrrcypxd0i ), 
  and i 'm also giving you 100 dollars . 
  i know not everything on the internet is true , but [ this ] ( http://www.geekstinkbreath.net/greenday/song-meanings/wake-me-up-when-september-ends/ ) , [ this ] ( http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3936 ) prove against it , and also [ this ] ( http://www.greenday-only.com/green-day-lyrics-wake-me-up.php ) where it says that ... 
   in an interview on vh1 , billie joe says the song is about his feelings surrounding the death of his father , who died of cancer when billie joe was ten years old . 
  now keep in mind not everything you read is true , there is a lot of evidence against this . 
  it 's a joke . 
  oh shit , i thought this was / r/completelytruestories . 
  new zealand :(, 
  did she reply ? 
  upvote for the edit . 
  keep it down , i can hear you . 
  ^ ^ ^ sincerely ^ ^ ^ new ^ ^ ^ zealand, 
  it sucks here . 
  i do n't cook , but hey it 's free right ? 
  there 's nothing to do . 
  hahaha holy shit this is amazing . 
  i 'm going to use this . 
  * highfive * . 
  can you link the askreddit thing ? 
  haha , i have you tagged . 
  late , but if you go on the nz.pcpartpicker and go to hdds , you can find what size and speed you want , and where the cheapest one is . 
  they are allowed more than tasers ? 
  this is what i do n't get , especially with such a high budget , he could have easily done better . 
  fuck attention cutters . 
  like fuck off you do n't even know what is in the minds of people doing it , you would fucking cry if you were in their position . 
  can confirm . 
  am brian 69 . 
  fathers day here too !, 
  itt : girls upvoted , guys downvoted . 
  new zealand !, 
  this ca n't have been long ago ... 
  do you like iron man too ? 
  i have you tagged, 
  i 'm not too fussed . 
  pfft . 
  where we 're going , we do n't need * trains * . 
  all laptop i5 's have 2 cores and 4 threads , and only the i7 's have 4 cores . 
  the processors are different for laptops . 
  mine has an i5 and it has 2 cores and 4 threads . 
  also the clock rate on that does n't help . 
  try go for a laptop with an i7 , as they are quad core , and try find one with a reasonably high clock rate ( not 1600mhz ) . 
  that i5 on the asus has a low clock rate and only has 2 cores and 4 threads . 
  if you are n't going to be doing anything too stressful the i5 will do fine . 
  there is n't * that * much of a different between 3rd and 4th generation laptop processors , so you could cut some of the price down and go for a 3rd gen. also even if you do n't play games i recommend trying to find one with dedicated mobile graphics , as they can make a huge difference . 
  i do n't have any exact suggestions , but i recommend something like hp or asus .

  for anybody wondering . 
  we can keep this thread alive !, 
   usually things have gone pretty central ( or a little bit west ), 
  that 's kinda why i wanted one on the north shore , because i ca n't easily get past the bridge too easy . 
  from what i 've seen yeah you 'll be okay . 
  especially since it 's easily overclockable , you can always get more power out of it . 
  if you are getting a cpu cooler , why a locked processor ? 
  i would change the 4570 to a 4670k , and cut some costs on the gpu .

  that one looks alright , i know it 's expensive , but it has high refresh rate , low response time , good resolution . 
  i do n't know if you wanted ips or anything so i just went for a good monitor . 
  if you do n't need such a high refresh rate , i got one of [ these aoc monitors ] ( http://www.aocmonitorap.com/root/hk_en/product_display.php?id=205 ) and i 'm really liking it and it 's quite cheap . 
  you say anytime soon ? 
  if you are at all even considering overclocking in the future , i would go for an unlocked one , it 's worth the extra money even if you are n't sure you will now . 
  low response time is the time from when you input to when it shows that , so low response time is good , ips panels generally have a higher response time than just led 's , and i * personally * prefer led monitors because of that , but it just depends . 
  do n't be silly .
