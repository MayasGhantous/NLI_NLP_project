  that 's why we have pc 's right ? 
  pc master race . 
  i would get a cpu cooler man , it looks like you are thinking about ocing . 
  you do n't have a video card , i ca n't now but i would change motherboard , get a smaller hdd and get a gpu , if you are n't doing too much with it you really do n't need an i5 . 
  unlocked processor , motherboard . 
  even that 's an overclocking , but how much would you get it for ? 
  also what speed ram ? 
  maximum, 
  i would pay the extra for the better build . 
  oh here , i brought somebody else here . 
  that you do n't know . 
  to eat your food . 
  i hope you do n't mind . 
  1572 points . 
  kik or snapchat or both ? 
  but ... they are literally perfect . 
  bet you are scared of subway too . 
  you subway hating ... * jerk *, 
  how small ? 
  same here :(, 
  they need to be watercooled or they can do that . 
  late i know but is n't there also an output on some motherboards . 
  are you going to watercool or aircool ? 
  i am assuming aircooling so therefore something like a noctua . 
  do you have an sli bridge ? 
  how * cheap *, 
  i would go for an unlocked cpu , as they are a only bit more expensive ( 10-20 dollars ) , and if you had one you could overclock if you wanted . 
  check with game requirements . 
  new zealand here , i am proud to say we have cheaper prices than you . 
  * yisss ^ ^ new ^ ^ zealand ^ ^ wins ^ ^ agaiiiinnn . 
  760 runs near even with a 7950 , and the better ram is just nicer , also the reference does n't run too hot , also this is more expensive for basically only a slightly better gpu , a worse hdd ( caviar blues are worse than barracuda , also seagate is * extremely * reliable ) , slower memory , and a case which is kind of important , overall he would be better slapping that case on his current build . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ * maybe *, 
  our chem teachers did the same . 
  [ new zealand mum . 
  who 's been initiating text convos ? 
  does this work for android ? 
  are you french ? 
  please , tell me more . 
  if she has words on her , like on her top , read them . 
  that 's how you read her . 
  however , if she does n't , try find like a tag or something with writing on it to read off of . 
  well i do n't have an ios device , only android/harmattan , so i was wondering if the `` what are your favorite ios games ? '', 
  worked for android and such . 
  my intel hd4000 gets a solid 4.8 . 
  if you can go for a barracuda hard drive , they are literally a few dollars more , sometimes even cheaper , and are faster than caviar blues .

  save where you can right ? 
  i do try . 
  * this girl is on fire ... *, 
  late , but reddit has a spam filter , so if you do it off their profile it does n't count towards karma ... 
  fallout 3 it 's by that spaceship where the mothership zeta dlc starts , and fallout nz it 's far north , raiders or something have it and they usually have a gauss rifle , but with wild wasteland they are aliens . 
  the aliens are easier to kill .

  yess , thank you . 
  i know some of those words . 
  late , but also if you have a lot of processes , they are all evenly distributed , e.g. 
  if you have a few complicated programs and a lot of not so complicated ones , they will put themselves evenly over all the cores , meaning it is n't stressing it out as much . 
  there 's fluids in there when i smoke ? 
  well from what i 've heard , a higher clocked say dual core cpu , can perform about just as well in tasks that require fewer cores as say a lower clocked quad core cpu . 
  but now tasks are utilizing newer technologies such as more cores , so things such as games take advantage when there are more cores , and make it easier to bare the workload , also meaning more stress when there are less cores . 
  windows for example is utilized for dual core processors , and spreads its workload evenly over both cores , so from what i interpret , having a quad core over a dual core in os , does not give a noticeable cpu benefit . 
  in operations like 3d modelling or rendering , i believe they use as many cores as they can , meaning something like a 6-core processor offers a substantial increase over a dual core processor , no matter the clock speed . 
  so a good analogy is a cpu is a highway , the clock speed being how fast , cores being how many lanes , and then there 's a load of more complicated stuff . 
  sorry for the long explanation ... 
  tl ; dr different applications for different cpus . 
  * ninja edit * i did n't answer your question , the point is for more handling at once simultaneously , the more cores can handle more things at once . 
  it 's like having lot 's of arms . 
  it is n't that easy though , sometimes you freeze up or mumble your words and screw up . 
  i ca n't imagine you 'd know since you 're probably outgoing , people who are n't get scared and screw up when they try to speak to girls . 
  cool that he knows it 's metallica . 
  even cooler you listen to similar music . 
  i would n't either , but it 's still embarrassing , and sometimes it 's so embarrassing and you do n't want to go near them ever again . 
  i would n't seriously go for an iphone . 
  my point being , their buttons do n't last , and i think most people that have had any * recent * device , other than an ipad could agree , also they do n't even use that good specs now , so as newer products come out and ios caters better for the newer systems , the phones that are say only a year or 2 old get really slow . 
  most android phones from that time are still running fine . 
  i have an ipod , and that * can not * open anything , but my nokia from 2010 is still running reasonably good . 
  did you complete the tutorial , or are you still going through , because if you start applying too soon into the tutorial none of the [ job ] guilds accept . 
  late as fuuuuuuuckkk , but what are specs of pc ? 
  and also what peripherals other than blackwidow ? 
  nice watch btw . 
  do n't get karma from self posts anyway . 
  do n't look into their eyes !, 
  you 'll turn to stone . 
  what were you thinking ?
