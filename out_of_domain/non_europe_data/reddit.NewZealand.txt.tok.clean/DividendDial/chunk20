  you could go * much * more extreme , but this will be good ... 
  * did n't see you had a case in mind , ignore the new case ... 
  fuck you . 
  you got me . 
  yeah that case is huge , also the 770 is a beast , and should go ultra on most games at 1080p . 
  what did it say ? 
  i have n't , but i know people who have , and i have seen benchmarks and the like , but there is a difference , higher clock rate on the gigabyte card , higher vram , which is important for multi-monitor and for when/if you install mods , or play games that take advantage of more vram , the gigabyte card has different dvi links , and the gigabyte card has custom * `` windforce '' * cooling , which includes 2 fans , and keeps it quite cool . 
  i could n't find a cheaper evga card with 4gb of vram to compare to , so i 'm assuming you mean a 2gb one . 
  either way they are both good cards . 
  yeah , everybody i know is telling me to go 1600 , i 'll just go 1333 for now . 
  the cpu will run games fine , what monitor will you be playing on ? 
  what makes him washed up ? 
  his last albin was 4x platinum , and he is n't trying to be black . 
  older people are still trying to tour here , he 's nowhere near as bad as them . 
  but then you wake up dirty ? 
  recovery was his latest , it went quadruple platinum , relapse went double platinum . 
  i think i can safely say the album coming in november will at least go platinum . 
  to be honest , here , in new zealand , all ram is overpriced , an 8gb 1600 mhz dimm with 11cas is about $ 103 , and the cheapest 1333mhz ram has 9cas and is $ 107 . 
  in this case , i would probably go for the ram with the higher frequency , and there is an 1866mhz dimm for $ 113 with 10cas , so would you say that i should probably go for the 1600mhz ram ? 
  even though it has an higher cas latency , it has a higher frequency than the 1333 for a lower price , and really i wo n't notice the performance difference in gaming . 
  what do you mean single ? 
  survival or bezerk ? 
  i agree if it 's bezerk , it 's really hard to understand , but everybody says they like the old him , and when he tries to bring it back people hate it . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ suck . 
  aww . 
  cute couple . 
  ca n't spacejews delete his comment and it would be the same ? 
  i do ? 
  that uh ... that is n't how you do it ? 
  do n't state an opinion people do n't want to hear on reddit . 
  bad things happen . 
  i played on the xbox one today , the controller feels great , better than the ps4 , but there was just something weird about them . 
  * edit : sorry for posting my opinion . 
  i forgot this was reddit *, 
  i played on all ( except steam controller ) and i have to say , ps4 comes last out of the 3 i tried , it 's just uncomfortable to hold . 
  i wonder why he only ordered one slipper . 
  like , the feel of them , the placement of the start/select buttons and trackpad , and especially the triggers/bumpers . 
  `` and i walk away laughing my ass of . '', 
  of what ? 
  not enough time , not as entertaining , there 's other stuff to do . 
  i 've been on like twice in the past month , both for about 5 minutes each . 
  um , ok you think whatever , but i have , and to me it is uncomfortable . 
  it could be just me , but i have tried it , and have seen it . 
  well , i mean that it is different , and i * personally * do n't like the change . 
  the triggers and bumpers are * sooo * comfortable , but the new xbox button is a bit out of the way to reach , but that is n't too much of a worry . 
  it looks fantastic , the new d-pad is great , and the only thing i can complain about is the feel of the thumbsticks , as they have a weird rough feel around the edge , whereas in the middle there 's a smooth , deepish dip . 
  it just feels a bit odd to me , but i guess that 's not much to worry about . 
  he 's in 8th grade according to his history . 
  * edit : he also browses trees and apparently smokes , he said his girlfriend was crazed . 
  he does n't work , he just left middle school ... 
  i do n't think dirty ears cause this ... 
  i live in new zealand , and do indeed do this . 
  you do n't * have * to be diagnosed with depression to be depressed . 
  that 's basically saying you are n't depressed , until they say you are . 
  which is stupid . 
  some people are genuinely depressed , and contemplate suicide without seeking any medical attention . 
  yes it 's more complicated than being sad . 
  i realise a lot of people who say they are depressed are n't , but some people genuinely feel depressed , and probably are . 
  i did actually , but it also says if you want to know more ask . 
  i did just that . 
  plus i thought there might be some new places , new people here who are from around there , or people who did n't see it last time . 
  there is only 48 comments on things to do so there might be a more to add here . 
  but these all sound like * good * bots . 
  op does . 
  that 's him in the picture . 
  * `` friend '' *, 
  i thought it was my feelings when ... 
  ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ whole ^ ^ ^ life ^ ^ ^ has ^ ^ ^ been ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ lie . 
  squidwards suicide . 
  [ watch out . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fan_death ), 
  fuck i forgot what thread i was in . 
  oh my god i 'm glad it was just a dream . 
  yay for me in lounge and the parents room is in between me and my room . 
  pee on them to assert my dominance . 
  have you tagged as kevin , needs to deliver . 
  * what do you need to deliver ? 
  * *** tell me . 
  bow chicka wow wow . 
  that was ... anticlimactic . 
  she sounds like a bitch . 
  yeah , i do n't really like the look of this one . 
  i wish i held out for the new nexus 7 , i got mine like a week before the new one was announced . 
  damn . 
  and for a ridiculously low price . 
  this is what i * love * about google/lg , they have specs that majorly outperform something like , let 's say , and iphone , and they charge less than half the price . 
  even at $ 400 / $ 500 , it is a lot cheaper than any new iphone . 
  i got it in sf , i live in new zealand , so not really . 
  bae caught me walkin ' .
