  ... what ? 
  it says like , if he liked it , it would say unlike . 
  not 100 % on the matter , but i would have to say that , that is op . 
  my shin or chin ? 
  this is definitely a time for correct spelling . 
  the titles are the dates , like 201310010714 is the 1st of october 2013 at 7:14 am , and i 'm not sure what the numbers and letters are inside but i 'm sure they mean something . 
  so ... it should stay blue ? 
  * and * razer . 
  and how much was that alienware x51 ? 
  i think a lot do , but we never notice them on here , i think you only notice them when they make stupid comments . 
  i 'm 15 and also realise people on the internet hate me , but i ca n't help it , so i hide until my time has arrived . 
  yeah , some people you can tell are trying to make jokes on / r/buildapc , but there are just some places that you ca n't act like an immature asshole and get upvoted . 
  yeah , if you go on something like / r/im14andthisisfunny , they are all immature , and most of them are n't too young . 
  it 's sort of like 4chan , most of them are older than 18 , but they are still very immature . 
  and things when people correct others grammar and spelling , it 's okay if you ca n't read what they wrote , but when it 's like a full stop they missed , just leave it , it 's not going to kill you . 
  and this , when people go against the grain they get downvoted , you are going to get downvoted for something everybody knows is happening . 
  does anybody new even * look * at the reddiquette anymore , or even know what it is ? 
  i know you 're probably thinking my account is new , but i forgot the password of my old one . 
  and all the users that are here now would probably leave at that stage . 
  reddit would then turn into something like 9gag , where shitty memes are posted with dull comments . 
  i honestly do n't they are , if you look at the comments they are indeed something they think a 14 y/o would say , and they really say , and they are masking that they would really say that behind jokes . 
  but if he built it himself , he could have got more power . 
  why op . 
  it was $ 2000 . 
  well just 2 years ago was n't youtube saying do n't use your real name , and now google 's there they encourage it . 
  the same could happen here ... * what then ? 
  is it the lights ? 
  * it 's the lights is n't it . 
  they see it * in the future * , that 's how much faster they are . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's nsfw . 
  * edit : sort of *, 
  clearly . 
  in all honesty i have a razer keyboard . 
  only because it was on sale , and was like $ 40 than the next cheapest keyboard . 
  those nzxt phantom cases are nice , and are similar to the alienware ones , especially the black and orange one , that looks so good . 
  yeah , i do too . 
  but that 's because it was dirt cheap at the time . 
  oh yeah , i remember now . 
  celly what about me . 
  i know * some * css . 
  right now i am proud to be a new zealander . 
  that ... that is n't what teachers do to you ? 
  problem is , i ca n't stand mmos . 
  i have gone forward in time , reddit is now in shambles , and this site is , indeed , irrelevant . 
  pming got taken out long ago , and i request my gold . 
  * anything * literally * anything * . 
  i do n't care if it 's a space flight or a walk on the beach , thanks for the recommendations though .

  something like this ? 
  the ones who are unwanted think they are wanted and comment , and this makes a negative stereotype , and then others in that group do n't speak up . 
  yeah i know , i saw , i searched up standard price . 
  that 's newer though is n't it ? 
  i uh ... 
  i was n't blaming him for anything ... 
  were there any females in there ? 
  'cause ca n't you get somebody pregnant by doing that ? 
   i 'm going to enjoy my legally purchased alcohol . 
  3 more years here buddy . 
  3 more years . 
  is it the / r/teenagerstinychat ? 
  some tilt shift photography and this tab . 
  i was typing random words at the end of reddit.com/r/ and eventually typed teenagers , and heyo presto this was here . 
  i do it a lot , and is how i 've found most things i 've subscribed to . 
  nah i used to go on a while ago , but i stopped . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ [ goodbyeeeee . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/teenagerstinychat/comments/1naxrr/i_will_probably_stop_going_on_completely_now/ ), 
  not sure , but try / r/tipofmytongue , 
  just saw this on askreddit and came here to post it . 
  you beat me to it . 
  so these 5 french models brought their baby puppies over to florida on vacation . 
  then this evil man threw them in the ocean and sharks , like 30 of them , came from now where and were just about to get the puppies when i saved them . 
  i had to kill 16 sharks and the rest swam away in fear . 
  one of those lucky bastards managed to nip a piece of my skin and gave me that pretty cool scar . 
  i returned valiantly to the models and said with a sexy smile that all it cost was a kiss for their puppies back . 
  i got 5 really nice puppies . 
  that would imply you doubted this cool and true story . 
  new zealand . 
  not everybody lives in us . 
  i 'm not sure any of the links are purple . 
  bullying ... by talking about sex and christmas . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ cock, 
  and here in new zealand . 
  well here in new zealand mcdonalds pays minimum wage ( $ 13.50 ) , so that is not unlikely . 
  america is weird with their paying scheme , a bit screwed up but i guess it kind of works . 
  why and when are you going 240 km/h on a motorcycle ? 
  i think she 's a girl . 
  that 's because theres a finite amount of content that can posted , and then people get desperate for karma . 
  i really hope you win ...
