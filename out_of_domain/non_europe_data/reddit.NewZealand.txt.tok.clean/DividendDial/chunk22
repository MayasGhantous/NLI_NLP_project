  what would you consider ` late . ', 
  because i know in some places late is 12 , and others it 's 18 . 
  i 'm what i consider introverted , and i do n't hate extroverts . 
  even as an introvert it 's difficult to focus on homework , theres stuff like games , hobbies and such that is distracting . 
  i am seeing * way * more new zealanders on here recently ... 
  i like it !,

   i should be of note that itunes does n't use mp3 , but rather m4a, 
  i found that out pretty quick . 
  xbox does n't support that format :(, 
  although i like logan , he can be extremely bias , more so than linus . 
  how has nobody heard this copypasta ? 
  and what were those cupcakes made out of ? 
  can confirm , am doge . 
  you asshole what the fuck just happened . 
  how did you do that ? 
  have an upvote . 
  still , you can tear muscles with adrenaline , you are much stronger than you think , but your body limits itself so it does n't rip your muscles apart , and with adrenaline it ignores that . 
  once the adrenaline had worn off i think your legs would be jello the rest of your life . 
  i have this as well . 
  my favorite part was the `` hdd will and has fueled my butt . '', 
  there was a story about a man ripping his muscles apart while saving somebody , and he had an adrenaline rush at the time . 
  i never finish . 
  are ... are you a guy or a girl ? 
  well sheeiiitttt . 
  wooo new zealand . 
  but good job slim . 
  i 'm not sure , but i do n't mind because i 'm from new zealand . 
  but when mmlp2 comes out it will be top of the charts for weeks/months, 
  get him to number 1 on itunes . 
  i want the cd , but probably will just get it off itunes . 
  i have 20 dollars on my debit card just to do the same . 
  the girl who played with hitler . 
  there was another one about some youtube channel some kid was promoting as well . 
  she * almost * died a million times in that movie . 
  also there were some inaccuracies with physics in that movie . 
  you 're a * teenager * ?!, 
  you suck ! . . 
  oh shit wait . 
  the thing here is you could either be joking , or you could just as likely be not joking .

  the man who he lost his virginity to ?
