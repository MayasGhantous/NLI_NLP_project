  that 's kind of like saying it 's month 10 , or day 301 , which nobody really says .

  [ face/off it is ... ] ( http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/f/face-off-script-transcript-cage.html ), 
  new zealand or aus ? 
  i 'm going to new zealand !, 
  and heard album as well . 
  they are basically all 5 stars though . 
  this is my favorite line ... have n't finished album yet though . 
  i love the little ` easter egg ' type things for people who know the old stuff . 
  mmlp = / = mlp , read it . 
  he is doing it just to annoy me . 
  he 's not too good at spelling ... 
  no , i keep it a secret pretty well . 
  resolution is n't much better though ... 
  australia for sure . 
  - new zealand, 
  the scary thing for me is that , either the universe is infinite , and it has been going on forever , or it has n't , and there 's an edge to the universe , and the universe * will * end . 
  shit 's scary . 
  i am pretty sure that 's the joke he was trying to get at . 
  but * infinite * , usually everybody just goes along with it , but when you think about * infinite * , never ending , it 's crazy to comprehend and wrap your mind around . 
  the fact that it 's never ending and that as far away as you want , something is happening . 
  i have resorted to imagining it as a giant circle/loop , so it just goes back to where you are . 
  it gave me frisson . 
  that 's the spirit . 
  but i 'm pretty sure it 's worse with itunes , and online purchasing places , especially since they just boost up the price when the song is popular . 
  buy the cd to get the most money to him from album purchases . 
  i 'm probably going to end up doing both cd and digital anyway , one for nostalgia , and one to have as soon as i can . 
  go back 4.5 billion years and see the world . 
  the egg came first though ... 
  2/11 and warn everybody about the next week .
