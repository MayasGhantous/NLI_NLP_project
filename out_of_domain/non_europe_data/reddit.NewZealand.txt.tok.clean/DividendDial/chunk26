  it 's a rare condition, 
  it 's what you 're suffering from, 
  when you simply do n't care if it 's an, 
  80 degree day and there 's no fricken air conditioning, 
  and you ca n't see the bitch 's hair is frizzing, 
  cause you got the windows up, 
  blaring the system in your chevrolet prism '', 
  it is n't all pointless , they do n't send people up there for the hell of it , they send them up there to either check and study information , or because they payed shitloads of money . 
  i usually just forget about it . 
  i think as teenagers we just forget , because with other subs there are more upvotes than comments . 
  oo bby , i also luv defined abs,

  oooh google 's so sexy , such defined muscles . 
  are n't we all ... are n't we all ...

  i lied . 
  he wants to play a game .

  i mean i would , but i made my skype like 3 years ago so my username is really embarrassing . 
  celly can you read the rules , no personally identifying information , no personal attacks , that is a personal attack and personally identifying information , take it down or i 'm messaging the mods . 
  also it 's kind of fucking annoying rather than funny now . 
  every day is one of those days . . 
  i have n't started ... 
  i 'm not sure if it is . 
  so would i , i sent my username and i have n't started . 
  15 m new zealand , nothing very interesting , a plain boring person . 
  well it does . 
  money !, 
  not of me , but if you showed people a picture of you that they wanted to see , and then i got that picture and showed a whole bunch of other people , in an album of pictures i made , and then asked you which one was the hottest , would you think that was fucked up ? 
  i mean sure they posted it , but they did n't want that to happen . 
  so uh ... can i have a picture of you ? 
  where do you think the baby 's sleeping ? 
  well yeah but you 're asking if you 're hot , not somebody else asking to compare hotness with others . 
  who the fuck goes on reddit ? 
  mouth open as well , ooohhhh yeahh . 
  i 'm listening to dance with the devil right now , and also atmosphere - the last to say . 
  so ... say never ? 
  woooo new zealand , where abouts ? 
  ( auckland here ), 
  kristin ... you ? 
  woo , go new zealand . 
  that uh ... that means you 're the new one . 
  auckland , new zealand . 
  am i doing it right ? 
  1st i also find interesting . 
  second , space is expanding , if the universe is infinite , nothing , if the universe is finite , it 's just expanding . 
  i think minutephysics or vsauce did a video on this one . \\, 
  * ninja edit : [ it was deep astronomy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv33t8u6w28 ) *, 
  none ... megapixels are digital , our eyes are measured differently . 
  although sperm has like 37mb or information or something , and every time a guy blows his load its 1500tb of data going out . 
  it is crazy , that 's why i just refuse to believe it is infinite , but then when i think about the universe constantly expanding , it will expand forever , and since it is finite ( using the assumption ) , it will never be infinite , but it will keep expanding infinitely . 
  it 's crazy , and then there 's the question of if the universe is finite , what 's beyond the universe ? 
  does it loop back , are there other universes , are we just some tiny spec on another , larger being . 
  the fact that we do n't know is so amazing . 
  i love space . 
  well then there 's the fact of the shortest length known , planck length , and that is * tiny * . 
  i did once calculate how much volume of the observable universe i took up lol , 4.8 e ^ ^ -43 % . 
  well if something goes wrong up there , we might want somebody up there to fix that billion dollar space station . 
  i rather spend $ 100 million on astronauts who fix billions of dollars of equipment . 
  huh , so in saying that , the universe could both be finite and infinite ? 
  infinity is an amazingly complicated , but extremely simple idea . 
  there 's some relevance to what they 're doing . 
  i do n't know , i think that it 's cool that we can send people up to space . 
  well was n't that depressing . 
  it 's with text . 
  people have put it on shirts and it has bulging eyes . 
  on reddit , like when people say weird sexual things . 
  thank you sosososooso much !, 
  wow, 
  much douche, 
  so funy, 
  such sophomor, 
  i 'm a teenager ( yes i know scary admitting it on the internet ) and i think most teenagers realize the importance of math and physics , to even some degree . 
  no these people are ... * special * kinds of people . 
  [ girl , it 's a girl . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/search?q=i%20think%20math%20is%20a%20lie.%20physics%20is%20a%20lie.%20if%20we%20used%20this%20in%20real%20life%20we'd%20look%20dumb&amp;src=typd ), 
  well saying physics is a lie , yes she does n't understand it , but a * lie * , * really ? 
  yes , it 's full of teenagers who bag other teenagers , sound familiar ? 
  it was afterwards . 
  lovejoy is probably my favorite comet , solely because of its orbit , and how close and hot it gets ( 4000k ) and quickly gets colder , as it soon gets nearly no heat from the sun . 
   real mature, 
   stopped using that phrase ... realised how retarded it sounds, 
   ca n't stop a crazy train . 
  speaking of which ... 
  bum bum, 
  you just need to keep going do n't you , was n't sixth grade like last year ? 
  grow up man . 
  why did you take a screenshot of a picture of yourself holding your phone on your phone ? 
  could n't you just have taken one or got one , or linked the photo . 
  ** i am so confused . 
  ca n't beat a sloth .
