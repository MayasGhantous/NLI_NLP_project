  oh yeah i guess that might be the case . 
  do you have a gpu , or are you using intel hd graphics ? 
  so even if you kill all of the white legs , they still die magically ? 
  unfortunately , fallout 3 , although the greatest , is a super buggy game on pc . 
  just search around trying everything , i had a similar problem but found something to fix it . 
  i ca n't help you sorry . 
  i ca n't spend that much though , even an i5 is $ 320 . 
  there is ... just go controversial instead of hot . 
  just because he 's 14 does n't mean he knows jack shit . 
  he probably knows more than you , go fuck off , we do n't need people like you here . 
  m8 , i say one comment to you and you go through my history . 
  no need to get your neckbeard in a twist . 
  new zealand as well !, 
  ^ ^ ^ right ^ ^ ^ guys ? 
  now i need some changes in my life . 
  it basically is . 
  the niggas are coming , the niggas are coming !, 
  yeah , [ here 's a 8350 ( $ 217 ) ] ( http://nz.pcpartpicker.com/part/amd-cpu-fd8320frhkbox ) , [ here 's the cheapest i5 ( $ 258 ) ] ( http://nz.pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80646i54440 ) , and [ here 's a 4670k ( $ 320 ) . 
  ] ( http://nz.pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80646i54670k ) i hate these prices . 
  old, 
  no , that 's not it . . something else . 
  i 'm just doing it now . 
  ninja edit : just finished 8 seconds later . 
  was good . 
  stop spamming shit content and maybe people will forget . 
  i was going for the marathon . 
  stop fucking doing this . 
  no , you are just spamming a whole lot of posts that are bad . 
  just stop please . 
  people will soon forget . 
  i think everybody is ... 
  it 's fun though . 
  guessing games , guess the nationality , guess what kind of person they are , etc. 
  twist , / u/thisnewguyisnew is actually mediaboy . 
  my penis . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ kidding . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ? 
  not everybody gets frisson on the same thing , when i saw it i got frisson , so i thought it fit here . 
  since people react differently to different things , some people might get frisson off of it and others not . 
  i do n't get frisson off of some of the very top posts , but others i do . 
  i know of it and i liked it . 
  i only watched it last year though . 
  if you think an ssd , lower the ram , cheaper apu and also the mobo . 
  looks like the new zealand police . 
  i 've never been attacked by a yao guai , i 've played 200 + hrs , have played with and without the animal friend and still have n't . 
  i 'm so dissapointed . 
  first time i went underground in the train stations . 
  is it too late for me to join ? 
  i just started it , but every time i do a dlc , i save twice just before i start it , so if it autosaves i have a backup , and i can then just go back if i 'm not enjoying it , that usually is n't the case though . 
  also spoilers sort of . 
  it also comes with fallout 2 , but i already have it . 
  i think i will get both , thanks . 
  some audio technicas , ad or something, 
  thanks , 
  bit small , but thanks anyway . 
  yep , 
  and the cool sounds as well . 
  i do n't think it would be complete without the sounds . 
  wow . 
  i 'm really not sure if you are a troll or not . 
  i think that it 's still pretty cool that we have barely any idea of what it looks like , and we can only guess with calculations and figures what it could look like , and base it off of a lot of other galaxies . 
  gods do n't age right ? 
  the finest . 
  i am hoping to see, 
  a ) the main reason people do n't want kids, 
  b ) what age they realized they did n't want them ( current age range for comparison ), 
  c ) if you have a partner , did you find somebody who did n't want kids , influence them into not wanting kids or whatever . 
  also i just wanted to see the main gender of the people here . 
  thanks for answering !, 
  yeah i screwed that up . 
  thanks , i did n't need to specific , and as you said , you had many reasons that you did n't want kids , and i simply ca n't fit that in . 
  thanks though . 
  well ... was n't that easy . 
  i think they can handle it , on very low . 
  $ 500 for a pc then , that 's the price of a next gen console , it could run fallout with a bunch of mods . 
  it 's also long term savings with games being so cheap on steam and such , you can get mods and use console commands . 
  i got fallout 3 goty and nv ultimate for $ 10 combined , and also got 1,2 and tactics for $ 5 , which you ca n't play on console . 
  pcs are really good . 
  what are you saying ? 
  as you were , as i want you to be . 
  ^ ^ ^ anybody ? 
  nice , 
  oh sheeeeeeeiiiiiiiiiit that 's pretty damn good . 
  i am !, 
  that 's amazing !, 
  steam . 
  if you wan na be cool , follow one simple rule , do n't mess with the ketchup-status quo . 
  do they really ? 
  why 's that ? 
  does n't cod ghosts say it needs more than 8gb of ram ?
