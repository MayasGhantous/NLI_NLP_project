  unlocked cpu , cpu cooler , slightly lower speed memory , but the performance difference is minimal , nice case , better gpu , better psu . 
  that 's the same wording i got , but i only got 39 % ... 
  my stepfather said that i sucked in the bed . 
  awh shit , so am i !, 
  i 'm so excited , after playing off of my laptop and only being able to run source games . 
  ok thank you so much , i was having horrible thoughts of not having enough power , have you overclocked or left them at stock speeds ? 
  oh sweet , thanks for the help , 
  you ah ... you watch sips eh ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ me ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ maybe ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ mum ? 
  ok , thanks , what can i ground myself on if i do n't have a case ? 
  i have that exact anti-static wrist band , so just attach it to anything metal and i 'll be fine ? 
  thanks , 
  thanks , i need this to buy a case . 
  i 'm not sure if it is functioning , but yes the 24 pin connector is all the way in , do all motherboards have lights to indicate when they 're on ( this is reasonably cheap mobo . 
  renee 's razor blades . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm kind of a nvidia fanboy , so i 'm partial , but do n't really mind what card as it 's my first build and just want the best deal . 
  thanks , 
  i live in new zealand , and the r9 280x is at least $ 50 cheaper , i think i 'll just go with that . 
  beat me to it . 
  no , since what you 're thinking is like if you throw a ball while moving , the ball goes the speed of your hand when it leaves , plus the speed you 're moving , but since the speed of light has a limit , they 'd extend at the speed of light , and it would look as though light is going slow . 
  sorry , i 'm planning to game off of it ( mainly cs go/fallout/l . a noire ) , and i have an i5 4670k , 8gb 1600mhz ram , cas 8 . 
  why the fuck is everything a lie on reddit ? 
  people have met famous people before , and people have met eminem on the street before , so why could n't it have been a redditor ? 
  he was also around the same age as em , and they were good friends . 
  i got same but 550 ; - ; i feel bad now . 
  well in all honesty , i figured i 'm not the one paying the power bills , and i know that sounds bad , but i really do n't have that much money , and a 500w 80 + bronze was $ 105 or something whereas this was $ 85 ( nzd ) .

  hey happy new years !, 
  idk about other guy tho . 
  the future is so cool though . 
  `` facebook ? 
  that outdated crap ? 
  no i use bebo actually . '', 
  is it really lying if you just are n't telling them something sort of private ? 
  good guy / u/spaceparry, 
  oh gaben strike you down , that cable management is horrible . 
  please fix it . 
  but the eye ca n't see more than 30fps !,

  why the fuck would you save with a butt ico ... ohhhhhhh . 
  that 's her name . 
  she 's saying that she does n't care about the people in songs being rich and famous , because in her dreams she is . 
  i ca n't remember where i read the breakdown of the song but it 's really good . 
  he ca n't be . 
  mediaboy i think . 
  the thing is that bottle should n't even be heavy when full , and i assume he has had some to drink , so it will be lighter , ca n't be much more then a couple of pounds . 
  how did you find this ? 
  what was n't blocked out ? 
  are they british ? 
  tagged as alcoholic . 
  i know a few places that have gone smoke free at the new year . 
  is this new zealand ? 
  it 's always been full of children , but now they/we are starting to appear . 
  come on mate we were all children once . 
  may i ask why you never show your damn nose ? 
  i 'm not complaining and it 's not a bad thing , i was just wondering why she does n't show it , it seems kind of weird that she 's willing to show literally anything , except her nose , which people see when she goes out anyway . 
  if the cops are after you , just blow your car up with you in it , then they ca n't get you and you have all of your guns still . 
  * might *, 
  i think this is actually a common thing . 
  i think this one is swept under the rug because of the war , and the fact that there was so much going else on the time . 
  a lot of horrible stuff went on around that time , but we do n't know the half of it . 
  my tenth birthday was shit , first of all some fuckin ' robot destroyed my cake , a kid tried to steal my sweetroll , i got punched in the face , i got some old piece of crap wristwatch . 
  the vault sucks too , it 's so cold and damp . 
  i 'm not around the world , i 'm right behind you ... 
  and that ball of burning hydrogen is circling around a hole in space millions of light years away . 
  just time passing , when you think about it , time is passing here on earth , but again , time is passing everywhere in the universe , and things are happening everywhere in the universe . 
  14 years ? 
  how the where you scared of thomas the tank engine anywhere near 14 . 
  i was the same , then a rottweiler came up for a pat , and sat next to me and i 've loved dogs ever since . 
  why ? 
  i 'd feel kind of gross doing it though . 
  you think i would show myself ? 
  i 'm hiding in the cupboard over here . 
  yeah i know , its an object with mass that looks like a hole because light can not escape . 
  sounds better the other way . 
  no it wo n't be , i can guarantee that to you . 
  plus some people call soccer football . 
  yeah , plus that means learning a whole new sport , and we 've already got rugby down to a science so we do n't need another thing . 
  you can stay safe your whole life , or peek and get shot in the face . 
  i 'm not religious , but i think buddhism seems like the most peaceful , and the most philosophical religion , and i can relate to a lot of it . 
  * not all silvers suck , * trust me , i had a nova iii telling me before game that i was shit and that i did n't know callouts , and i beat her and half the team . 
  sometimes the rest of the team sucks , or the other team is better . 
  not if your team is bad . 
  no , but it can still take a while . 
  they 're puppets , how had can it be ? 
  mine was the same , but nickelodeon .
