  there are people disagreeing and fighting on our own planet , even if we did start to trade , another country who felt we were getting the bad end would start to mess shit up , we should n't interact with extraterrestrial life until we get shit sorted at home .

   the `` do you like cheese '' question allows multiple responses . 
  so you can ( and will ) get people saying both ` yes ' and ` no ' . 
  i realize that and just have to live with it , nobody has said no yet , so that 's fine . 
   the `` would you ever consider buying / using spray-cheese ? '', 
  question includes the response ` other ' . 
  what the fuck else can people answer if it is n't ` yes ' ` no ' or ` maybe ' . 
  that was n't on purpose . 
   the `` what would be the most you would pay for the spray-cheese ? '', 
  question does n't take into consideration people who have already said they would n't buy it at all . 
  the question still stands , if you were to buy it , what would you pay for it . 
  it is n't related to whether they like cheese of not . 
  if you purchase off steam it wo n't be right ? 
  thanks for the help , i 'll make the changes soon . 
  well they laughed did n't they ? 
  bot gabe is definitely the best . 
  * do n't give them any ideas *,
