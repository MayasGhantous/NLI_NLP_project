  please no . 
  thanks , 
  what 's so weird about that ? 
  `` you have impeccable aim . '', 
  `` it 's cus ' i 'm arab . '', 
  nice, 
  thanks for the reply , battery was loose and stuffed it with papers so it would stay touching the connectors . 
  had to get the photo in . 
  also if you want it , [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odudskkzsak ), 
  too late ? 
  i do n't have 150 wins yet , but looking at it is n't it only there sometimes ? 
  like it will pop up if you need it , but if there is n't a case to review it will be normal ? 
  i fuckin ' swear i played against you , or somebody like you . 
  you carried the other team so hard . 
  what region are you in ? 
  maybe not then . 
  damn . 
  i 'm excited . 
  that 's pretty nice of you . 
  what a community . 
  red . 
  says on box . 
  for some people aim < spray power . 
  26.2625 days over 19 months for me . 
  for them not a lot of bullets + semi auto/low mag < lots of bullets + high rate of fire ... 
  i 'm not sure , i would personally go with deagle , or even p250 . 
  it feels way better , proving to everybody you 're the pro . 
  what website ? 
  link ? 
  oh you 're a higher rank , so therefore are better ? 
  wrong , obvious hax . 
  reported . 
  then hindsight kicks in , and you realise that you should n't have peeked , and should have put a smoke down , and you promise to yourself that next time you will , but you never do ... well that happens to me anyway . 
  play with friends , problem solved 'til half-time and end of game . 
  what region are you in ? 
  although we can watch that online on pc anyway . 
  `` but that 's not supporting the devs . '', 
  how much would valve have got from this ? 
  wait , $ 23.850 ? 
  i see , thanks for that , i forgot it was n't sold by steam . 
  [ how often do you cash in on this ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1tanfw/until_tonight_i_never_met_anyone_famous_and_then/ ), 
  well i guess i wo n't be getting the game , sucks that they are n't tradeable . 
  he 's clearly hacking , and helping out the community against hackers is helping everybody . 
  story ? 
  are you ok now ?

  it 's a game though , so theres that . 
  i have an aoc e2357fh , which is .25 mm thinner , which is n't that much , but also shows that the info displayed is n't always right .

  i 'm not sure he wants your pigeon , keith_hugecock . 
  do the tablets use wifi , or have images/videos saved on them , or both ? 
  i do n't think that 's how power works . 
  you ca n't just go around reddefining words . 
  it 's more annoying than anything else . 
  nobody else i know gets this . 
  for most it 's still a luxury item that is n't needed though . 
  when it does i think it 'll be worth it . 
  i think 120fps is glorious , but it 's more than it 's worth right now . 
  what are you going to use this for ? 
  cloud to butt makes this hilarious . 
  buttception !, 
  wooo , represent !, 
  you do n't have to go on e thesub if you do n't want , it adds a fun challgenge , and i find it fun . 
  huggies get s it . 
  kfuck i just tested it and now i cant take away the k, 
  i just try to type as fast as i can , and i 'm sure that 's what other people do on this sub , but yeah i agree , typing isn ; t too difficult . 
  what region are you in ? 
  even though it 's because there 's a licensing fee . 
  the opposite of this is `` we get free games on ps + . '', 
  they keep contradicting each other . 
  if you 're only using ssd for os and basic programs and files , you really only need 64-128gb , unless you plan on putting some games on there , even then , ~ 120gb will manage fine . . also depending on how many games you have , you do n't really need a 2tb hdd , the 280 is a great card , and will play on high-ultra most games ( in my experience with 280x anyway ) . 
  also you do n't * need * a 650 watt psu for that , but i 've added a slightly cheaper one that is still fully modular and has some good reviews . 
  if you want you can keep with the amd cpu to keep the build even cheaper , but this will get you a small amount more performance .

  it should be able to play games on high/ultra , but if you want you can go to amd cpu , and get a slightly better gpu , not absolutely necessary though . 
  if you go to [ steam guage ] ( http://www.mysteamgauge.com/ ) , you can see exactly how much your games will take up ( if they are all installed that is ) . 
  it does n't matter , you can just fuck him ... up .
