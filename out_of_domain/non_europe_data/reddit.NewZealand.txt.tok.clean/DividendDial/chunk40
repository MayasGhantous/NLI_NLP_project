  idk what you 're on about , for 16gb file , you need 16gb ram . 
  and new zealand . 
  yeah i 'm glad they have , although i 'm on a plan with a data cap with spark , and although there has n't been a decrease in speed , it 's still only at ~ 700kb/s, 
  that 's also a good thing to learn from . 
  if you are with somebody on a , and the t 's rush a certain way and take site easily , try the same thing when you 're on t side , because chances are that they are defending the site similar to you . 
  it 's a good way to learn new strategies . 
  definitely asus , i do n't think they realise not all people who play games want leds everywhere . 
  what does this do ? 
  is this the thing that keeps you turning so you do n't go afk ? 
  question on top of this , when i try to help people , they laugh at me , or say they do n't need it , or deny they were doing it , every time . 
  how do i make it so people listen to me when they are doing something bad ? 
  do these take up a lot of space ? 
  what i did in silver when i felt like you was i played with a higher ranked friend , and it put us in a nova-mg game , and i saw how they played , how they peeked and sprayed etc , and how i got destroyed . 
  trust me , a lot of people in silver feel like this , but once i saw how they played , i learnt from them . 
  i do n't think pros would want to use one anyway , they could n't put buy binds , or many of their needed binds on them , and if they had a keyboard as well , then why use the keypads . 
  to your question though , i would n't know . 
  thing is at the end of the game he was 4 ranks lower , and he was bottom fragging , and i just told him to aim for the head , not chest , and he got mad . 
  i was topfragging that game , but at the end of the game when ranks were shown , i just said to listen to advice sometimes , if you want to rank up . 
  what ? 
  i kept waiting for it to stop , then i thought it was too late . 
  that 's seriously amazing . 
  i know , i have to suffer every day . 
  are n't heists coming to the new version of gta ? 
  i really wanted to like swag , but i really ca n't after this . 
  wait , what ? 
  was he on wipeout ? 
  is this actually him ? 
  that 's the one i know ... not sure about loving it though . 
  holy shit . 
  imagining the same guy playing professional cs is very strange . 
  i did one of these for my ak , got fucking george zimmerman . 
  sure glad i sold that . 
  yeah , i really want to know how , it never happened before i got my inventory like it is , but now people ( mostly bots ) want to trade or add me or comment or whatever , some even saying add on dota2 lounge ( do n't play dota2 ) . 
  maybe like a website shows it or something ? 
  he did say *** '' *** * geberally * *** '' ***, 
  oh that might be it , so would it be people or bots ? 
  are n't they adding multiplayer heists ? 
  [ or is pcgamer trolling me ? 
  ] ( http://www.pcgamer.com/gta-5-pc-gets-4k-support-and-first-person-mode/ ), 
  add the / s next time . 
   anytime i play with mg, 
   d ** mg **, 
  you do realise that dmg is still mg right ? 
  keep going after `` nah , i 'm just playing '' ... 
  `` go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that . 
  no , i 'm just playing . 
  i know you think you 're fat '', 
  even then , what would the reaction be if it was, 
  `` go ahead and tell them fat bitches that . 
  no , i 'm just playing . '', 
  man i hate that song . 
  i 'm just saying , that mg is still dmg , i never said anything about how else you play . 
  you could also play on esea with your `` mg friends '' , and it would n't matter that they were mg . 
  i think you 're just trying to feel superior . 
  i 'm not sure if that still works ? 
  pls send help . 
  can you give some tips ?? 
  that 's amazing . 
  why do i feel happy when nz is mentioned . 
  probably dotcoms house . 
  i laughed . 
  i 'm a bit later . 
  what one is this from ? 
  thanks . 
  how would one go about this ? 
  man mines only worth 100 and i still get regular people asking for cases and stuff . 
  damn annoying . 
  you are too ? 
  aha thanks . 
  what time and timezone ? 
  thanks for that . 
  [ just takes me back to the same damn place ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qpzxt8a.png ) . 
  open wheel racing , 2.3 l ford focus engine . 
  yeah ... ... nice ... 
  my nexus 7 is n't even that old !, 
  it 's 2014 ? 
  man i want lollipop so bad . 
  you put a weta on your childs toothbrush ? 
  alrighty . 
  that 's the thing , if you 're doing well , tell that to the other team and they will start to feel like they ca n't win , they ca n't beat you etc. 
  and then , even though you 're similar ranks , you 'll rek them . 
  they would probably make a profit off of it ... eventually . 
  it 's ended . 
  stop trying , you 're only embarrassing yourselves . 
  hang it up backwards on your wall . 
  i second this . 
  when i was using my laptop , i did this and it was amazing , it was a lot quieter , hands did n't get hot , more comfortable , better in every way . 
  dude ... 
  `` successfully landed '' * cough * titan . 
  well actually , it 's because in most places , nz/aus at least , people drive on the left , therefore walk on the left , therefore , the escalators are on the left for up , and left for down .

  hey , i raced quater midgets on dirt last year ( in another country ) , and this year i got a midget out of the ford focus series over there in the us , and am racing it here !, 
  glhf to them , it 's a great class . 
  did you just call her a midget ? 
  i find that offensive , she is a normal girl just like you and me , and should be treated the same . 
  no i know , i used to race them !, 
  he just said that she was a quater midget , not she drove one . 
  yeah , just like you always drive on the left/right . 
  if you look at it to go up , it 's on the left , and if you look at it to go down , it 's left . 
  i could have said one , but i was n't thinking .
