  what fps are you getting on other maps because of this ? 
  ouch , dont get too close . 
  way to edgy for me . 
  it does n't even go ratatatatat now , it actually sounds lethal . 
  mud elite, 
  did it get your dry noodles heated up ? 
   17 so i think my flair is wrong, 
  you * think * it was wrong ?

  what countries do you ship to ? 
  these are amazing . 
  2 bits / u/changetip, 
  what is this one even meant to be ? 
  xbox fanboys downvoting you i 'd say . 
  then it would make people lag . 
  that would be extremely annoying . 
  it might be too high though , because has a ghr of at least 5 . 
  there 's video games banned in lots of countries , i 'm glad nz is n't as bad as australia or germany . 
  i thought that toothless was for people who liked him or whatever , same with gaben . 
  either way i put no . 
  woah !, 
  theres a shutdown button there ? 
  til, 
  it 's nuke boss , do n't open squeaky too much or he 'll find you . 
  no ragrets ? 
  cool tattoo though , you have others ? 
  what 's it of ? 
  if you do n't mind me asking . 
  so people really go look for say a ps4 game , sort by lowest price , see a completely different product , like a mop , and go `` oh wow , a mop just what i wanted '' , and then proceed to get a mop instead .

  does this count in nz ? 
  i hope it counts in nz . 
  manipulative eh ... tell me more . 
  thanks !, 
  i do n't know why i did n't try this . 
  i do n't have this either on n7 or opo . 
  but they will be lazier and 2gb ram will be low end wo n't it ? 
  like the equivalent of 1gb now . 
  its a lot easier to optimise for a smaller amount of phones though . 
  did n't the ubuntu phone do that ? 
  well if he 's gon na die why does it matter . 
  that 's a good point . 
  i do n't know ... 
  door stuck ? 
  you sure ... burnt my dry noodles . 
  what 's the song ? 
  sounds great . 
  op are you still alive ? 
  i 'd say most people would add games anyway . 
  silvers ... 
  ^ ^ ^ / s ^ ^ ^ we 've ^ ^ ^ all ^ ^ ^ been ^ ^ ^ there, 
  i find that , but i also find that the back button being close to the right helps with one hand use for going back on apps and webpages . 
  yeah , i just barely , barely noticed it . 
  i probably will forget about it though because its so minute that i had to stare at it for a while . 
  not all apps do this though right ? 
  chinese version comes white 64gb as well ? 
  or is that another ? 
  because that 's the one i have and its great . 
  that really sucks . 
  it looks so damn good . 
  i might aswell pirate it ? 
  alright thanks i 'll try this . 
  in glad i did n't have to go through that process . 
  a store had them for not much more than i would have paid . 
  i 've played a bunch of hours in all fallout 3 and nv ( who has n't ) , and the one creature i have n't killed or even fought is a yao guai , it is now my mission to never fight one . 
  how difficult are they ? 
  what about in game comms ? 
  there 's no possible way ? 
  at all ? 
  i 'd say a lot of the time he would die on purpose to not look too sus . 
  but we do notice , and most people will at some point in their life go and look at the stars , and think it 's amazing , but are we supposed to do that every night ? 
  i have one , and use mouse4 for mic button , mouse 5 for torch on community servers , and upscroll as jump . 
  my mouse4 is a bit mushy from pressing it too much . 
  yeah same haha . 
  i just got rid of mine at christmas !, 
  i thought they were rips, 
  happy new year . 
  what does a.l.a mean . 
  too lazy to look it up . 
  aaa, 
  i 've seen a lot of hate around here for it , but as my first `` high end '' android phone , its great . 
  this is a great idea , make it obvious you can get there without making it easier . 
  16 here , but my sisters boyfriend used to play cs : s , so i was shown cs : s when i was about 8 . 
  who is this 4chan ? 
  really ? 
  holy shit that 's amazing . 
  i think we need one in nz :(, 
  i think a death match map in gisborne area , maybe called dm_rhythmandvines ? 
  getting xp from steam achievements , like account aging , number of games , participating in events . 
  every 10 levels it gets harder to level up i think . 
  i 'm level 10 so what do i know . 
  it is , its a video of a news reporter saying that quote , ca n't link it now sorry i 'm on mobile . 
  huh , never thought i 'd see trademe on here . 
  with a store like that though what would you expect ? 
  wait ... this is you . 
  m8 at least have a different name . 
  why was the mum so far away ? 
  alright m80 . 
  i second this , did exact same as you for car and motorbike , passed both ezpz . 
  i did n't read anything else .
