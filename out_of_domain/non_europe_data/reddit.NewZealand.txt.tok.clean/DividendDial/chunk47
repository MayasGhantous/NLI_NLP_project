  for people who have it it is n't huge , but for people wanting it i could imagine it would be . 
  apparently you can fix that by taping something up in the phone , i can link it to you if you want to ? 
  haha , fair enough . 
  you 're making me worried . 
  meh , it should n't happen yes , but for me its more of a slight annoyance than a major problem . 
  it works fine , great in fact , but once every few months the screen fucks up so i have to restart it . 
  i got it from a store so i do n't get it anyway ... 
  i 'm on my phone , so i can link it in like 2 hrs , but if you want it urgent , you could look through my profile for it , somebody else links it . 
  i got ta say australia/nz servers are the perfect mix of fun and toxic . 
  how do i play with my silver friends then ? 
  silver 1 is actually one above global elite . 
  who did the same with amazon prime ? 
  this guy . 
  it 's useless in nz as well . 
  what 's your dpi at ? 
  the navbar looks tiny . 
  what screen size ? 
  what do n't you like about it ? 
  i 'd recommend just cm12 , i did n't like 12s or 12.1 so i just went back to 12 , solid build , not much like 12s . 
  i 've got the same on 11s , 12 , 12s and 12.1 , so i ca n't say much about that , but i 'd imagine it is n't as bad as 12s . 
  1 minute and 45 seconds of that 2 minutes is trying to get to sleep . 
  my first gen is so slow ... 
  all of your photos are great dude . 
  how long have you been doing this ? 
  deep . 
  yeah i think it was middle class that was on the tip of my tongue . 
  thanks !, 
  is n't that more synonymous with rich though ? 
  do you know where i can download the rom , i ca n't get it from the downloads.cyanogenmod page , because their cm12 nighlies do n't work ... 
  in my device manager , it recognises `` asus transformer prime apx interface '', 
  i got it thanks , i got into recovery through bootloader . 
  it was a terribly slow process . 
  thanks for the suggestion though !, 
  women are from venus !, 
  i knew it . 
  can you kill him , i thought you could n't kill essential characters ? 
  how big do you want your phone ? 
  and also 16gb of storage ? 
  that 's what , 10 useable . 
  also 4.2 ? 
  really strange choices . 
  dust gets in there , and makes the sliding feel horrible . 
  i 'd never buy a slideout keyboard phone again . 
  my n9 had that !, 
  extremely annoying . 
  worst troll i 've seen . 
  well , that 's just your opinion . 
  tom cruise . 
  so your little finger is your thumb ? 
  would n't that get confusing . 
   `` that 's what '' - he, 
  a happy reply , in an otherwise depressing thread . 
  you from nz or moved here ? 
  i feel like we have a celebrity in our midst . 
  move over prince harry . 
  got mine at 156 . 
  yes . 
  with snapprefs and the new update i can update to 12.1 . 
  there 's also a module which lets you install older builds of apps over newer ones , ignoring the snapchat message . 
  worked for me . 
  it 's been an hour ... 
  i 'm so excited . 
  it 's called xinstaller , [ here 's the link ] ( http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.pyler.xinstaller ) . 
  ah damn that sucks . 
  he has no experience though , is that ok ? 
  yeah , i think i 'll give them my bank account details so they can sort my problems out . 
  what ? 
  trash ? 
  you asked for it ... 
  he should n't bike with a flat ? 
  is n't that obvious ? 
  you ca n't tell / u/11microbe what to do op !, 
  he 's his own man . 
  so when do we get together ? 
  sounds great . 
  my 100th birthday .
