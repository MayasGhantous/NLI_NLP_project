  probably , i think the minimum recommended is a 660 , so if it 's having troubles on higher end cards , i would n't recommend it . 
  no i know , i do n't particularly like elitism either way , console or pc , but saying that all pc games are indie , and all pc games are buggy is wrong , and that all pc gamers care about is pixels and framerate is also wrong . 
  opo owner also , i was strangely jealous , strangely not anymore . 
  what was it ? 
  capturing a moment or something ? 
  i think it was a shark . 
  you 'll turn the way you 're looking , so if you look over your right shoulder , you 'll start to turn that way . 
  if you click on statistics at the bottom you can see the most referenced ones . 
  this xkcd is the most referenced . 
  late , but that is a terrible set of arguments , and if you are somebody who agrees with those , you probably deserve to not wear a helmet anyway . 
  more motor vehicle head injuries than bike ? 
  no shit , more people drive cars , there are more cars on the road than bikes . 
  you 're unlikely to have a serious crash in a motor race , why do they wear any safety gear , it does n't matter how low it is , just wear safety gear . 
  most importantly , that study was done in *** 1978 *** , car safety has come extremely far in nearly ** 40 ** years , cars are a lot safer , that article is null and void , there is no merit in it , and if you take that study for truth , almost 4 decades later , plus the data is n't even at the link , so he could be pulling the numbers out of his ass . 
  why do pedestrians matter , we 're talking about bikes , also , risk of serious injury , plus in that study it says there is an ~ 85 % decreased risk of serious head injury when wearing a helmet . 
  the current risk stated in that study was .41 , so if nobody wore a helmet , it would increase dramatically , even though there is a higher chance of getting a serious injury in the first place , it does n't negate the combined probability of no helmet and the base probability . 
  what one is it ? 
  ah , i think i was on the other team . 
  anybody know her name ? 
  she does n't seem like the sort of person to play minecraft . 
  i 'm pretty sure it opens in a window so it 's easy to forget about it in the background . 
  it 's real , you ca n't make this stuff up !, 
  you can now see responses . 
  what do you do most often ? 
  it had to be a high ratio though , because otherwise nobody would be in periwinkle . 
  i 'd say the screen 's also a pretty big reason ... 
  this comment was made 24 days ago , feel old yet ? 
  ah , thanks . 
  that 's interesting , and weird that it 's still a thing . 
  holy fuck . 
  you should ask her what happened and what her mum thought ... 
  i do n't think so , it was on an article about tess , and the person commenting 's profile picture showed them quite large . 
  but who knows , could 've been a troll . 
  no , its what she 's attempting to actually say , she is trying to say muscle is n't heavier than fat , even though it 's denser , which is not how physics works , and she ca n't even explain her point properly , resulting in a meaningless statement . 
  and she 's still wrong ... she says even though its denser its not heavier , but density and mass are directly proportional . 
  she 's trying to say it is n't ... 
  sweet as , i 'm fine with that . 
  compared to a normal town though ? 
  i think if people have been talking it down too much , it wont live up to that . 
  in which case , she is trying to say that muscle is not actually heavier than fat , which is wrong , and even says muscle * is * denser than fat . 
  she makes no sense . 
  wtf is using your system resources in that picture . 
  you only have like 4 programs open . 
  it is 12.1-20150515, 
  what are you doing with it though ? 
  is that consecutive ? 
  has it been in your pocket ? 
  have you been playing games ? 
  edit : in the screenshot, 
  can it just be flashed on top of the official nightlies ? 
  thank you !, 
  also , have there been any major updates / features added . 
  damn , thanks for answering though . 
  what rom are you currently on ? 
  if you have twrp installed , go in there and backup your phone fully , then reset it , turn it on , download the a new rom onto the phone , go back into twrp , restore the backup and then just turn it on to check , and then back into twrp and install the new rom . 
  why did you post the same picture, 
  i got an older version and i 'm not in us . 
  i think you might be able to get the older version that was posted on here a while ago . 
  so do a lot of roms ? 
  true , but i got the impression that a large percent of the users on this sub are people who would root and/or install custom roms . 
  no he said you did ... 
  ah sorry , did n't know what knox was . 
  i ca n't , it 's stuck . 
  oooooohhhh i 'm trying !, 
  damn , beat me by 2 minutes . 
  man robbie is great . 
  the one on the right is a reflection , look at the wall plug , and it is reflected on the wall . 
  you can also see the break before thebwall and at the top right of the image . 
  what 's the e-brake ? 
  is it custom or not ? 
  thanks , nice setup by the way . 
  really ? 
  i needed an invite for inbox , and that hound app . 
  i do n't get how they have that much hate for it , i do n't like it , but i do n't hate it as much as / u/steve0mac . 
  once the userbase is big enough , i 'm sure it will stop . 
  i was replying to him talking about gmail though , because he was comparing the phone to gmail . 
  i realise there is a difference , but saying invites are n't a thing anymore is wrong . 
  lucky i 'm not late then ... 
  he 's smoking nature . 
  pretty neat . 
  and 11 hours ago : https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3k9ty8/weatherman_effortlessly_pronounces_58_letter/ . 
  holy fuck how . 
  [ look how many times this has been posted ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f4xn5ay.jpg ) , with the same name too !, 
  op , i ca n't believe you 've done this . 
  plus , i do n't think the main focus of many , if any of these , is the pizza . 
  apple tv only natively supports it on osx does n't it ? 
  it will never be as useful again though . 
  what hamilton is that from ? 
  because depending where its from , you would n't want to pick up girls anywhere . 
  the undercut was fashionable in germany wwii times though was n't it ? 
  i put cyanogenmod 5.1.1 on , no other kernel or anything , with nova as my launcher , and for the most part it is like new , with a few noticeable hangs . 
  i 'm on my phone so i ca n't really find a guide , but i downloaded a toolkit that did everything for me , and then flashed cm . 
  i hear you , my name is john cena , and whenever somebody says chimp , i always think they are calling me champ . 
  if you have n't found the answer , can you post a screenshot of you changing the volumes ? 
  did you do a total sum or not ? 
  or anybody ? 
  yeah i got this update a while ago , why are some only getting it now ? 
  its not there sadly , probably because i guess they thought the lollipop animation was nicer . 
  i would say it 's still worse here , the z3 is still going for upwards of $ 800 in most places , with some being $ 1000 , and that 's a year old . 
  i 'd say this one will be 1000 + nzd .
