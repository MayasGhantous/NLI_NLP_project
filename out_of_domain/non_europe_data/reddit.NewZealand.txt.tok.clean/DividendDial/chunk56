  * does it require effot ? 
  if so , then count me out . 
  [ literally what he emailed me ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pnqnrml.png ) about an hour after the podcast dropped . 
  i want to get off mr maddox 's wild ride . 
  due to the fact that he fucked over dick in episode 77 , and this is very similar to that , since dick was n't on and asterios replaced him on the episode . 
  but the bonus episodes were n't free , and i 'm pretty sure they 've ended too . 
  but windows has been around a lot longer than android , surely they 're going to get to a point where they ca n't make it heavier . 
  they should still give an explanation as to what happened . 
  i 'm fine with it ending if they want to end it , there does n't even need to be a reason other than we did n't want to , but the way they handled it was terrible and i feel they need to give a proper explanation other than `` we ran out of problems . '', 
  why ? 
  why ca n't there be multiple channels that do hydraulic press stuff ? 
  presstubes stuff is pretty interesting , they have a thermal camera and show the pressure of the press . 
  there can be more than one of each genre on youtube . 
  i like both maddox and dick , i do n't want to know all of their lives , i 'd probably hate them if i did . 
  i just want any explanation at all for what is happening . 
  just ending it without acknowledging your co-host is pretty strange . 
  i would even be happy if maddox commented on it at all , even if he said `` i 'm not commenting on the recent events '' or whatever , instead he is just being silent . 
  sure he has the right to do whatever he wants , but he is probably going to damage his new network by doing this . 
  the other half is finding out what you got though . 
  i would love to find out . 
  i bought both books , and i got 1 of them twice ( fuck itunes/apple not allowing ebooks to be used anywhere but their devices ) . 
  thanks !, 
  that 's really cool of * you * !, 
  i respect you not telling , and i do n't care if you do n't share , but i doubt dick cares what 's shared , and he definitely would n't tell one person something he would n't want to be said publicly . 
  i sent [ this problem ] ( http://imgur.com/deowkmz ) to dick a while back . 
  also porn savers . 
  how about you pm one of them and see for yourself if you do n't believe the screenshots . 
  every time i 've emailed dick i 've gotten a reply pretty quickly ( just keep it short ) . 
  the beauty is we can live with both and we can get two christmases every week . 
  worked fine on my android , what browser did you use ? 
  where did you learn that ? 
  that seems like a terrible idea . 
  [ if you read the sidebar you 'd realise it * is * the place to post your own humblebrag ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oxbx2iz.png ) . 
  and , if you look [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/humblebrag/search?q=self%3ayes&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) , you 'll see that people do it occasionally . 
  [ incorrect ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/humblebrag/comments/4m30lt/it_feels_really_wierd_and_awkward_when_youre/d3spd8j ) , it 's still humblebrag material . 
  the city it was in has a population of ~ 1.3 million , which is decent enough for this to work , most likely the cover charge . 
  holy shit that 's useful, 
  and you guys say madoff is petty . 
  what episode was the teach amanda to fish joke on ? 
  it 's at 29:10 in the video . 
  nevermind , it 's episode 100 ( during dicks women problem ) . 
  but if they do n't ship to australia it may as well be fictional . 
  when tim said that her tits were crusty and could barely hold his laughter it made it so much funnier . 
  if so , could n't he do an ama through you ? 
  like we ask you questions and you answer with his answers . 
  yeah , i 'm just disappointed a hilarious podcast ended , especially on seemingly bad terms . 
  somebody did that on this sub not to long ago . 
  i 'll try find it . 
  rip . 
  women : ca n't live with them . 
  i used to use metal . 
  switched over to swipe , 100x better than metal . 
  the best advice in the universe . 
  depends on what you use , there is n't on sync . 
  especially the female after that apparent woman wrote in about woman in business , and tried to be really insightful , then next week a guy calls in and says he was the sexy grill from the last episode . 
  found it . 
  episode 79 12.45 was when the voicemail started . 
  i think candy randy asked him to stop . 
  i love how he called people who live at home lazy , but he did this . 
  it was on / r/blunderyears i think , she posted this picture of her when she was younger . 
  ninja : [ found the post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/blunderyears/comments/4m08ws/im_not_really_ashamed_but_damn_thos_pink_sideburns/ ) . 
  get raped . 
  are you from nz ? 
  if so where do you get your stuff from ? 
  yeah dick was furious , definitely made me uncomfortable more than anything . 
  in another , earlier episode though when they 're talking about alcohol , dick says something along the lines of `` vote up my problem of addiction '' , and maddox and/or seam ask why and dick says because `` if anybody is going to bring it in its going to be me . '', 
  so he 's kind of justified . 
  i loved the supercut of all of the good jokes sean had made so far , and it was super long and funny , then the very last joke was one that fell completely flat . 
  i think it was in the 80s / in december 2015 . 
  you 're pretty cool op . 
  i love 97 where maddox shits on that philosopher who could n't predict the future . 
  it 's also an all around solid episode . 
  man if people find out you 're on reddit they 're going to blast you with questions . 
  fixed . 
  even if you were the guy , these are n't real because at the time you did n't say about his new podcast , plus he said to a lot of other people he did n't know about the network . 
  same , i love pupper testicles . 
  not so much doggo ones though . 
  this podcast is gon na be yuuge, 
  no way !, 
  side note , i just dropped my iphone in a blender and [ it 's fine ] ( http://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/w800h450crop/public/field/image/2015/10/iphone-6s-plus-home-screen-hero.jpg?itok=igb-ulj2 ) . 
  haha sex !!!!, 
   why does nobody take her picture ? 
  because nobody wants to . 
  that just seems like a normal question and an answer . 
  why do n't i go outside when it 's raining ? 
  because i do n't want to . 
  it 's not funny . 
  also , haha ur mom !, 
  get it ? 
  also means he wo n't * need * ads . 
  he might get them for the extra cash , but he does n't need them . 
  do you have mirror of the image ? 
  i know some css , i 'm not sure how much you 'll need to pretty up the subreddit though . 
  and probably many more podcast apps/sites . 
  ( not spotify ), 
  i 'm 54 minutes through , from what i can tell he 's only said one side of the debate , does he say the other ? 
  or did i miss something ? 
  i agree but i did n't think his podcast was shit , it was n't great , not even good , just an average podcast . 
  i was prepared to listen to it to see if it got good . 
  but after this fuck him .
