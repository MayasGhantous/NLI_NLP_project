  no , one was impartial and the other was willing to see if you could improve , since they thought you were currently a bad mod, 
   which one would depend on whether i thought there was a division between myself and the mod team or myself and the community, 
  again , you have terrible judgement . 
  you did n't even ask anybody in the community so you thought the divide was between you and the mod team , when in reality most of the community would side with the now removed mod team . 
  it 's never too late to step down though , but you would n't because you 're so power hungry . 
  / r/me _ irl has some of the worst mods in reddit , plus / r/meirl is better for these posts than / r/me _ irl . 
  why do eli5 mods suck ? 
  really ? 
  you should post it . 
  good point . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  i 'll add it to the list of subreddits with shitty mods which is a lot right now . 
  you * do n't * look at neapolitan ice cream and wonder what sexy sex jokes you can make ? 
  not op , but i heard people saying that and that 's kinda why i could n't get into it . 
  i played infinite , really liked it . 
  then bioshock 1 and it was amazing , started 2 and could n't finish . 
  do you think it 's still a good story not comparing to the other games ? 
  a man chooses a slave obeys . 
  man that game was near perfection . 
  i 'm sick of that fucking subreddit dedicated to getting trump off of the front page , they 're just as bad . 
  i 've blocked anything politics related but that is definitely the most cancerous subreddit in a long time . 
  but people go to / r/teenagers to shitpost , people usually do n't go to/r/funny to shitpost . 
  i definitely do n't visit / r/teenagers for quality , it 's literally a place to be stupid where nobody else has to deal with it . 
  plus it 's not meant sincerely , it 's meant as an `` ironic '' joke . 
  this whole fucking sub is shitposts and that 's the reason i come here , they 're usually self aware shitposts , not accidental shitposts . 
  what the fuck did i just read . 
  [ these ] ( https://i.imgur.com/fblknxu.jpg ) are mine . 
  they 're great haha . 
  i think because he 's on tour , not sure though i 'm not op . 
  mine only shows flexicution and wrist . 
  the complaint i have is the tick for saved song is easily pressed and then the song is removed , i 've done it about 4 times and it gets me every time . 
  do you understand democracy ? 
  no of course not , you 're more of a dictator . 
  nah that shows nothing for me . 
  yeah dude i 've got a 280x running off of 550w , and i 'm pretty sure linus ran a titan off a 550 watt psu too . 
  definitely get the 650 . 
  it 's a `` dae hillary and trump suck '' post pandering to reddit . 
  this political bullshit is everywhere . 
  based on your and reddits far left views , sure they suck . 
  the problem is for a lot of people it 's just an echo chamber and then shit like this is all we see . 
  i can say bernie sucks and i 'll just get downvoted because that 's not the right opinion . 
  i have a similar [ poster . 
  but you never saw if the mustang did something , what if the mustang started it ? 
  again not okay , but understandable . 
  i 'd say if the tire hit his leg , that would probably hurt a shitload more . 
  yeah he said it 's ford sync . 
  ** s ** ** c ** ** a ** ** r ** ** y **, 
  the same can be said about texting and driving though . 
  huh , why not ? 
  you like any of the songs ? 
  whoever is behind this twitter account is loopy . 
  my four year old nexus 7 had 6.0 before i went back to 4.3 . 
   longer then the nexus policy, 
  the nexus 7 tablet is still a nexus . 
  also than not then . 
  in the comments people are talking about their grandparents marriage and death , reasonably sad but definitely not worth crying over . 
  of course it exists for the benefit of microsoft rather than the users , they 're a massive corporation that exists to make money . 
  i 'm not sure you 'll find many large companies that are insidious , you just have to go with the least intrusive and least offensive company . 
  i 've never seen ads on windows 10 , am i missing something ? 
  what corporation does n't ? 
  some are a lot more evil than others , but on the whole any big company will ultimately make their choices based on money , and whether that 's at the detriment of the user or somebody else generally does n't matter to them . 
  seriously though , why is albert west 's biography on the google result for kanye ? 
  it was so laggy on 6.0 , it 's a lot better on stock 4.3 . 
  or better , nz . 
  i 'm just excited for changing text size . 
  humblebrag with those yeezys . 
  that subreddits name annoys me more than the content . 
  / r/meirl _ ( / r/meirl mod went crazy ), 
  did n't realise it was a bot , my point still stands . 
  the podcast is generating almost 48000 a year ? 
  holy shit sean must be on something crazy by now . 
  / in i thought you could get the axon 7 with 6gb of ram ? 
  do n't most chargers ? 
  i have a 2.1 amp samsung charger that makes a decent amount of noise . 
  and multiplayer , i do n't like that it was similar but it was n't exactly the same . 
  not this long usually . 
  not sure why . 
  has yours come up yet ? 
  mine hasnt, 
  ugh i 've never had to wait this long for dick in my life . 
  if you use facebook , that 's the best thing to use it for . 
  makes it way easier to use . 
  probably because of the first bonus episode . 
  it 's on pocketcasts now . 
  i like the design , i just hope the bezels are n't that big , i feel that way with the nexus 6p top and bottom bezels , and i did with the pictures too . 
  but they are n't funny . 
  i mean most of reddits jokes are unfunny but this one was especially unfunny . 
  what 's your opinion ? 
  what if it was all black ? 
  i loved side scrolling to see each side , gives me something to do . 
  i think gavin free may have said something similar . 
  i think he redid it . 
  at this point do you feel like you have to buy a new nexus every year ? 
  they usually get taken down by automod/mods , idk how this one slipped through . 
  if you look at their profile it 's all the bot posts . 
  i 'm fat little man boy . 
  it would take at least a few minutes , probably more . 
  weird looking necklace . 
  would n't it be saint pablo , since that 's the 20th track and the 20th option 's the most voted . 
  also how short is short ?
