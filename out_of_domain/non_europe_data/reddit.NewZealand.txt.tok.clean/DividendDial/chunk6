  according to the new york post , new zealand is the free-est country . 
  yeah , apart from the fact that theres around 60 sheep in my room alone , we 're pretty free . 
  can somebody do this with [ downloading more ram ] ( http://www.downloadmoreram.com/ ) please .

  sorry , i wrote wrong name , i think it 's athlon ii x4 750k . 
  do you have enough mouse room , or do you not use much ? 
  it 's where i live that 's the problem , convert that from nzd to usd , i agree it 's overpriced , but i have n't got much to work with , and what i do is overpriced . 
  see i ca n't get at least 3 of those listed ( cpu cooler , memory and video card ) and it is still a few hundred more than yours .

  fuuu, 
  i would more say / r/averagebattlestations, 
  do you think the step up from rat 3 to rat 5 would be worth it ? 
  for a single monitor , is a * gigabyte geforce gtx 660 2gb * overkill playing on 1280x1024 ? 
  and if i can afford it should i go with it ? 
  i hoping to at first add 1 1920x1080p monitor , and then 2 others , when would i notice a large performance drop ? 
  also , if i add more when i add more monitors , will it still run well ? 
  i will probably stay on one monitor then , also last question , how long before it gets behind ?

  did i do it right ? 
  the i7 is n't really necessary , you could change it to a i5-3570k , but other than that it should be fine . 
  my dads ~ ~ it ~ ~ it guy picked out the msata , i 'd honestly never heard of it before . 
  my dads it guy chose most things , but really i 'm lucky i did n't end up with [ whatever the fuck this is .

  my the guy does n't know i have a copy of win8 , but he want 's to buy it , but i think he wants to buy win7 . 
  idk , he 's telling me how to waste my money , and tried to give me 16gb of ram and some video card i 'd never heard of , along with a worse i5 processor . 
  i can still change them , but, 
  gigabyte gv-n660oc-2gd geforce gtx 660 2gb 1.03 ghz ( 13 ), 
  gigabyte gv-r797oc-3gd radeon hd 7970 3gb 1.0 ghz ( 36 ), 
  my countrys stock is limited , and the prices are high .
