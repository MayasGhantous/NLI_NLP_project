  i feel short compared to everybody i know , but i do n't know if i am really short . 
  but it converts to saint pablo on the album . 
  name one genius that ai n't crazy . 
  ** s ** ** c ** ** a ** ** r ** ** y **, 
  i think, 
  he 's not even from italy , he was born in the us . 
  do americans always circlejerk about how great they are ? 
  or is that just a reddit thing . 
  the whole thread could fuel this sub for months . 
  ah right . 
  on reddit , yeah they do . 
  a shitload of people in third world countries are using low end android devices running off old versions , that would make up a decent amount of users . 
  png master race . 
  sean and joan did n't seem to catch on for a while , it was hilarious when they realised . 
  have you tried pressing as hard as you can ? 
  i had a button problem a while ago and i pressed super hard and it registered and is better now . 
  they all say the same shit . 
  `` who am i looking for ? 
  sam ? 
  it was never funny but they say the same dumb ` joke ' . 
  yep just enabled it . 
  it 's at the bottom of developer options for me, 
  might have said something that sounded like okay google ? 
  fuck these are getting clever . 
  `` kill app back button '' . 
  it might be a cyanogenmod setting . 
  haha, 
  same . 
  but can you still charge without dash with a normal usb c cable ? 
  that sounds like the reckless man any woman wants . 
  i think his hairline may also be receding , which makes his forehead bigger and his face look smaller . 
  why is it at half mast ? 
  has somebody important died or do they keep it like that ? 
  sorry i 'm not from the us , where is old glory flown ? 
  ah , thanks . 
  til . 
  i realise that , almost all flags are like that , i was just wondering why that one was since i could n't recall any recent deaths . 
  ninja : sorry if i sound snarky , i do n't mean to . 
  yeah i uh , i got the answer before thanks . 
  my favourite thing is probably the choice of apps . 
  you are n't forced with any one app for emails , or camera etc. 
  you can choose default apps , and because you can do that there are so many apps really great apps on the play store for things like messaging , or emails or calling or browsing the web . 
  least favourite thing is probably just lack of something similar to imessage , and that 's not even a big deal to me . 
  that still seems petty to me . 
  it was taken off of youtube , [ this is all there is ] ( https://flipagram.com/f/sfbgik4bpf ) . 
  there 's an nme award for villian of the year . 
  the whole thing is fucking dumb and every year they pander to the `` dae hate justin beaver '' crowd . 
  harry styles won 2 years in a row . 
  why is this one not higher voted ? 
  why is the newer one at the top . 
  that just crossed the line . 
  because the kid cost him thousands of dollars of damage . 
  it 's not like he did it just for fun . 
  but not many people purposely try to run over people , it was most likely a mistake , and the kid smashed a fucking window . 
  i do n't get reddits whole `` two wrongs make a right '' attitude . 
  that shit 's never okay . 
  plus what if it 's not even his car , that 's pretty shitty of the skateboarder . 
   reddit does n't have an opinion, 
  i obviously did n't mean 100 % of reddit , but way to many of the comments in here are just against the driver because he fucked up and he 's rich . 
   he probably just reacted, 
  i never said he did n't just react , i 'm saying it is n't okay . 
  like i said , there are so many comments defending the skateboarder for smashing the windscreen of a supercar , and saying that the guy in the car deserved it . 
  it is n't okay , and no excuse defending the skateboarder makes it okay * in my opinion * . 
  i 'm at uoa and i never realised this . 
  luckily my password is 8 characters . 
  also / r/universityofauckland and / r/auckland .

  in the bathroom . 
  it 's fun , not as flash as uni hall or o'rorke but its cool . 
  would you be interested in doing an ama ? 
  this is super interesting . 
  where do you live that it 's illegal ? 
  also , that 's what i 'm saying . 
  it is n't right to smash the windshield , if you feel satisfied , fair enough but i do n't think it 's right . . 
  but then he wo n't look * cool !, 
  i assume grid size and icon size , so make a large grid and small icons in nova . 
  why is he a shitty driver ? 
  why ca n't he have made a mistake ? 
  is it because he owns an expensive car ? 
  or do you never make mistakes ? 
  also are you never a shitty driver ? 
  ah right . 
  on nova there 's a frequently used apps setting that does that . 
  it 's the same as gnl but looks different . 
  fair point , i still personally do n't think it 's right to do that , but if you think that 's a good thing then good on you i guess . 
  probably on / r/casualiama would be easiest . 
  that 's similar to my mums car ( diesel hyundai sonata ) , it can go ~ 500 miles on half a tank of fuel . 
  gets down to about 5.2 l/100km or 45.2 mpg . 
  what did she say ? 
  thing is , if he filmed horizontal the other problem probably would 've been solved too . 
  i 'm 18 and was arguing with those fuckwits . 
  that shit is n't right . 
  they all bash him because he drives an expensive car . 
  i ca n't find the original youtubehaiku post , i 've been trying to remember for ages . 
  do you have a link ? 
  yeah i do n't see how op thought this was 1920x1080 . 
  good counter point . 
  i really like well thought out responses . 
  yeah , a super low dose would work fine with little side effects . 
  i do n't even live in the us , plus you 're the one being superior with the `` oh you 're voting for trump ?
