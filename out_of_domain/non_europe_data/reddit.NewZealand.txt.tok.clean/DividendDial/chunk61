  you 're an idiot '' mentality . 
  welp , you got me with that one . 
  ayyy another new zealander . 
  the ai is ridiculously good , in my game it missed about 5 times . 
  i find shit like this so weird , you guys may have seen each other and even talked to each other and now here you are on reddit messaging each other . 
  i 've seen this picture multiple times since 2010 . 
  this picture is super old . 
  i think i 've even seen it in some of those `` damn auto correct books ', 
  that 's a decent theory , could n't they just make a toggle though if that was really the case ? 
  by default it could be on snapchats camera api , and if the person wanted they could switch to the new one ? 
  i think a set of smartphones is quite limiting to the users , and also means more work keeping the list up to date . 
  it does just work right now , and it would still just work . 
  i was saying instead of going through and making a certain list of phones have it , they could make a toggle . 
  it would take no time for snapchat , and if people do n't care then they do n't have to enable it . 
  i do n't care if it has it or not i just want to send pictures to friends , i was just saying an easier solution than / u/sachd . 
  fair enough , but i never said i wanted more options , my point is i was trying to provide a better solution to / u/sachd 's suggestion . 
  * i do n't think there needs to be more options either . 
  * i realise that they should n't add more options , i was just replying to another person about an easier solution to what they would do . 
  it 's been going on for a while too , with multiple people . 
  maybe one day people will stop standing by her . 
  oh fuck it is n't ? 
  you can have a card ui . 
  i used to use it all the time , then switched to relay/slide and now on sync . 
  i think for me sync is the best mix of functionality and looks . 
  rif is probably 2nd for me though . 
  also / r/skincareaddiction is an amazing subreddit for helping with acne , i recommend reading the sidebar there and asking questions if you need to . 
  they 're just big ol' carafes . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ \\ ( i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ feel ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ downvotes ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ coming . ), 
  me too . 
  i thought i 'd be right leaning but according to that i 'm not . 
  i 'm the exact same . 
  i think he did say that , but i 'm also pretty sure it 's the same on both devices , because if you look at a saved snap on ios or android , the image size is the same as the screen resolution . 
  it 's most likely done to save data since sending an 8 + megapixel photo for 10 seconds or less would be ridiculous . 
  yeah i do n't get why people would want to send a full sized photo over snapchat anyway . 
  could n't you push the bin in first ? 
  or still 165 ? 
  thank you for your service . 
  [ reminds me of this .

  stats on that ? 
  in nz more people come to watch oval racing than cricket , and cricket is a big sport here . 
  yes especially when it 's extremely badly done . 
  that 's my weakness . 
  is that the anti reddit circle jerk , circle jerk subreddit ? 
  that place is just as bad , if not worse than the people they comment on . 
  it 'd be nice without the earth too , starting into the black abyss . 
  i feel editing kind of cheapens it a little . 
  what is then ? 
  better than stats pulled from nowhere surely . 
  are n't those less secure though ? 
  looks nice , now the sun looks out of place , definitely an improvement in my opinion though . 
  how are some pools faster than others ? 
  or is it just where the record is ? 
  i think they are , because they can ask for more unwanted permissions that some people just select , and they also are easier to get around . 
  and sync , and slide . 
  i wish i was in the middle of them . 
  yeah holy shit , surprised he does n't have a oneplus and eat cheerios . 
  if a company/product has a unique selling point they can charge more for it . 
  in this case i think it will work for them , the phone is n't designed for the average / r/android consumer . 
  you a wavy dude . 
  surely by doing this you are blatantly getting people to brigade there . 
  plus , how do you know it 's europeans doing that , i visit that sub and i do n't live in europe . 
  lucky it has a removable 1038392 mah battery . 
  you seem to get more karma from being a shill . 
  [ yep , ] ( https://www.amazon.co.uk/damn-you-autocorrect-jillian-madison/dp/0753540088 ) i remember reading it in 2011 , pretty much could all go on this subreddit . 
  yeah his facebook group is the biggest circlejerk there and anybody who has criticisms will get attacked . 
  something probably needs to be done , but they almost universally praise the guy who runs it , so he would n't do anything about it . 
  i actually like maddox 's podcast , it 's no tbpitu but it 's pretty good . 
  yeah sure , i only went back a week , but i remember that there was a huge amount of people shitting on this subreddit because , uh i do n't know why i do n't think there was much reason apart from they thought we were jealous or something because a people on here did n't like the facebook part of the group , and did n't like dustin , and they all had a big circlejerk over how bad reddit was . 
  anyway i could n't find those , but i did find these ... 
  [ somebody asking if maddox had a podcast page ] ( https://www.facebook.com/groups/thedickshow/permalink/1677868019204907/ ) , people in the comments replying with hilarious things such as the `` christian bronies '' facebook page . 
  [ somebody * `` bravely '' * stating they do n't like maddox ] ( https://www.facebook.com/groups/thedickshow/permalink/1679442342380808/ ) , i like this one because it 's so petty and pathetic for them to not even link to his page . 
  [ another * `` brave '' * person saying they do n't like maddox/his podcast ] ( https://www.facebook.com/groups/thedickshow/permalink/1679600499031659/ ) , where they do n't seem to get the two podcasts that dick and maddox now produce are completely different , and also missing the fact that dick does , indeed discuss social issues . 
  also tbpitu did that all of the time , and i believe dick brought in problems/solutions which included those topics . 
  there are a few people against the circlejerk in the comments , as always , but the vast majority agree with the circlejerk . 
  i 'll keep looking and if i find the dustin debate i 'll link it . 
  * ninja * , found the [ reddit/dustin link ] ( https://www.facebook.com/groups/thedickshow/permalink/1675160639475645/ ), 
  fair enough , though i never said it was * awful * attacks , i just said lots of circlejerking about it and anybody who goes against it will be attacked . 
  it 's also probably because i look at the this subreddit maybe once a week and it barely comes up on my frontpage , but i constantly see the dick show on my facebook . 
  and yes it obviously mirrors this subreddit because they 're both pages for dick and his podcast , but i have to say a lot more people are more open to maddox on this subreddit , people may be more mean towards him i do n't really know , but there 's definitely a bigger circlejerk on facebook about dick being the best and maddox being the worst . 
  if you 're serious then it 's a joke about reddits hatred of trump . 
  there 's no reason to bring up trump in a gif about a plant but this guy still manages to do it . 
  i 'm not the one who unnecessarily brought up trump in a thread about a plant gif . 
  yeah tbh i 'm pretty sick of this political shit . 
  i have about 10 political related subreddits blocked and i still ca n't escape it in / r/gifs . 
  i ca n't wait for this to be over . 
  it 'll hopefully be a bit quieter next year . 
  damn i got wooshed, 
  it 's removable though , and with the amoled screen it 'll use less power . 
  no , maybe there 's a tiny chance , but you 're almost certainly going to fall . 
  yeah i could understand it as well if he did n't want to reply , but i had sent him 3 emails which he replied to quickly beforehand . 
  i realise i 'm not entitled to a response , and maybe he has more emails now , but before he replied quick to an email that was just giving him a suggestion for a problem and responded with like 5 words . 
  i realise that , but i do n't think the email i leaked was as bad as some others , it happened after the break up and was n't sinister . 
  and thanks , gfy , 
  i do n't want to sound like an elitist , but i just ca n't get into pop music , i can listen to the top charts and it does n't really matter . 
  there are obviously a few songs that are good , but they are few and far between . 
  yeah i 've been there a few times , i just do n't like most pop . 
  yes . 
  maybe . 
  why would n't that work with the 2012 version ?
