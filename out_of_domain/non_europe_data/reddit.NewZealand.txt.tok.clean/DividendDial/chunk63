  yeah i have this sometimes too ? 
  i usually just manually fix it to lower case a bunch of times and it gets rid of it for that work . 
  not the n, 
  i assume he means merged tabs . 
  why is it not printed on his side view ? 
  thanks !, 
  found it , starts at 1:24:40 if anybody wanted the timestamp .

  not glorious android 8.0 oreo \u2122 ? 
  you should 've used the search function ... / s, 
  subtle putting your steam name in op so people can add you . 
  ^ ^ ill ^ ^ add ^ ^ you ^ ^ later . 
  woops i did n't see 2019 . 
  fuck i 'm old . 
  definitely a feature that would make me not want to buy the phone , i really like the look of the moto z too . 
  i want to be able to charge and listen to music at the same time , plus bent headphone connectors are a must for me and with no headphone jack it would either be bent and not moveable or straight . 
  i like to use methanol so i ca n't see the flame . 
  sure , what would you like to talk about, 
  i assume it 's something you text and it predicts your future/gives you advice . 
  kwgt pretty much fills in what klwp does n't do . 
  yeah i think it 's just an/r/android circlejerk . 
  but you 're putting a gap between where you could 've been and where you are . 
  if you 're on a long trip it adds up . 
  jesus christ when they fucking pull in as the light is going green and the first cars are pulling away , thinking they are so smart for doing so , i feel like fucking ramming them . 
  some are just assholes . 
  one guy i was fighting with doing this on the motorway from hamilton to bombay , when i finally pass and get in front in the fastlane , he goes across mutliple lanes into the slow lane without indicating and comes back to the fast lane in front of me and speeds off . 
  worst part was he was in a honda odyssey with his family in there . 
  where you are , sure . 
  you said you used an example of sh2 or something above in the thread , but a lot of places are n't like this . 
  pretty much wherever i 've been the normal car speed is 110km/h . 
  red/maroon . 
  in the rules , yes . 
  but i have never seen anybody use it like that , plus most people want to pass multiple cars so stay there anyway . 
  nope , sorry . 
  if you ca n't subscribe for whatever reason you 'll have to go without . 
  how do you know that ? 
  is n't it pretty much north island = bach , south island = crib . 
  that 's what i was told anyway . 
  you said it would be too much for a ladyboi , unless you 're trying to buy a human . 
  huh , what 's this afl ? 
  i ca n't see it in the pro sports tabs , is it a real sport ? 
  they have definitely improved in the past couple of years . 
  it does if he can bring more attention to it . 
  cyndi lauper - girls just want to have fun, 
  are we seeing somebody find out they 're color blind . 
  `` i do butt stuff . '', 
  i would try another doctor . 
  it looks kinda serious . 
  that is not what this sub is for . 
  those youtube comments are fucking terrible . 
  this guy seems to always have terrible youtube comments . 
  same here . 
  i ca n't be bothered spending all that time learning and setting it up when switching orientation takes less than half a second anyway . 
  / r/reallywackytictacs, 
  already have it haha , i was just on mobile . 
  haha next you 'll me telling me you 're just going to get some smokes . 
  there are some suspension mods that from what i 've heard fix quite a lot . 
  for me it 's a yellow stick figure . 
  i 'm on android too . 
  i think it 's a joke about how people always say that . 
  what the fuck do you mean forced . 
  it 's people posting images on the internet . 
  [ here 's a video of a moonrise from mars . 
  ] ( http://www.space.com/21826-mars-rover-curiosity-phobos-moonrise-video.html ), 
  less than a minute in to his speaking and i ca n't stand it . 
  i did n't take any classes and i noticed it right away , it 's super annoying to a lot of people . 
  it 's shitty if they act on it , but these people need help , not for them to be outcast more . 
  young children are what they 're attracted to and they ca n't help that , and a lot of them ca n't get therapy or anything otherwise they might go to jail . 
  i think counseling them without consequence is a better way to deal with them , rather than fear-mongering and threatening to murder . 
  years of jail , put on sexual predator list . 
  would you have suspected him as a potential killer ? 
  because they 're young ? 
  they just want to have sex like most young people . 
  that 's what i thought to , but they are pretty close . 
  i recommend finishing the bioshock series . 
  also both portal games . 
  somebody on reddit said that the earlier cases they could n't arrest because it was entrapment and if cops are n't involved they ca n't do much , but the newer ones they did get arrested . 
  yeah i think that 'd be as bad as jail , although from what i 've heard what they do do in jail to them , maybe not . 
  id say that 's what all previous generations said about the next . 
  it used to be normal for people to get married when they 're teenagers , then slowly got later . 
  next generation will be something different and so on . 
  so you want to hurt some guys life because hes rich and can take it ? 
  from what i 've seen he 's a nice guy . 
  why not complain to the people doing it . 
  it had a pc release , i 'm not sure if it supports controller but it 's there . 
  fuck that 's crazy . 
  i 'll see you now at the bottom of the comments . 
  because that means all their apps would be uniform , whereas making their own icons gives them the chance for some of their apps to have old icons , and have that inconsistency we all know and love . 
  quits omegle and goes back to the i fucking love science page on facebook .

  there 's more too [ here ] ( http://karmadecay.com/results/u7780312 ) , and i saw a post on pinterest . 
  also , i saw this as an ad so you 're going for nothing but karma , in fact your profile looks like it 's specifically made for trying to get karma . 
  it works , but it does n't feel quite right . 
  that sounds right , thanks . 
  i see it more as clearing things up . 
  dick has been shitting on maddox in his podcast for a while now , and now maddox shits on dick to defend himself and it 's childish ? 
  for him it 's a lose-lose . 
  i do n't hate either of them so i 'm not trying to be bias to either . 
  plus it 's maddox , part of his whole shtick is to be petty , just like dicks is to be a dick . 
  he 's from nelson , can you even get that much work there ?
