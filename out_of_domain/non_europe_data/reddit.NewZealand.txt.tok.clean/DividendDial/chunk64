  yeah this drama just makes me sad . 
  i remember that thread too . 
  so many people thought it was fake , including me . 
  also , maddox proudly states in an episode he does n't respond to emails , in one case taking 8 ? 
  years . 
  i think this is the dumbest comment i have seen in my life . 
  i have been to schools that are entirely for the mentally handicapped and i still have n't seen anything this retarded . 
  i do n't know where to begin ... just look up the definition of fucking satire . 
  wow dick seems to have told maddox the truth about everything that people try defend him for . 
  amazing . 
  so no he does n't , you do n't need to say the 2002 part . 
  hillary claimed she did n't support gay marriage in late 90s/early 2000s and now she does , who knew presidents change views depending on what the popular opinion is . 
  edit : i conceded below , please stop messaging me . 
   in 2016 he claimed he ** did n't **, 
   so no he ** does n't **, 
  i was clearing this comment up , not making my own answer up . 
  also , nice editing your comment . 
  i think a lot of people think hillary is wrong for president more than trump is right . 
  i 'm not from us but i am following the politics . 
  most media is against trump because they 're mostly liberal , and obviously for some of the racist things he says , and while i agree it 's not right , i do n't think it 's as bad as the criminal things hillary has done , and the lies trump has made are nowhere near as bad as the lies hillary has made which the news does n't report on . 
  the media is kind of childish too , every news segment i 've seen it 's been a professional photo of hillary , and a ridiculous photo of trump for no reason . 
  probably gon na get downvoted for going against reddits liberal mindset , but i do n't mind . 
  well it 's pretty obvious . 
  i have n't seen one news segment on a big network that is pro trump . 
  they 're all pretty biased unfortunately . 
  oh i see , i thought they were saying that he was for it before and is n't now . 
  yeah that is a problem . 
  i guess that means he is n't for it now anyway . 
  i did n't understand what the person above was saying . 
  i admitted it was wrong in another comment . 
  yeah i knew it was coming , unfortunately the echo chamber does n't like different noises . 
  i think most of the people who look at those go there because of their political stance , and people opposed do n't , whereas big networks most people see regardless of political stance and therefore have more influence/reach . 
  but yeah entire media is n't the right term . 
  i understand my bias , it 's pretty clear . 
  the person asked for people who are voting for trump , and while i ca n't vote for him i support him over hillary , and probably would vote for him . 
  anybody who answers the question as he asked is going to be biased since they support trump , the problem is with the media , since they 're not answering for a requested demographic on reddit , but rather pushing their agenda . 
  i can respond , i might be here all fucking night though because i have a bunch of messages to respond to . 
  put a remindme here if you want to see the reply , and message me if i forget , but i think this is going to be a longer answer . 
  i did initially go to -1 , but i am now in the positive . 
  what gets more views though ? 
  a rational view on trump , or a funny picture of him with something ridiculous he said . 
  i 'm not claiming this is 100 % what happens and it probably looks like some zany conspiracy , but i feel that it may come into play . 
  in my experience though , i have found that mainstream media is definitely biased , more under reporting hillarys shortcomings and over reporting trumps rather than saying either is bad . 
  the easiest source is to look at something like / r/politics ( which is biased also ) , and there are places where it 's almost 10 in a row of trump slander , and maybe one thing about hillary not winning millenials . 
  and i assume you know , but before you downvote the person above for thinking they thought it was real , look up satire . 
  i think a lot are crazy coincidences , but that guy that got murdered a couple of weeks after leaking the dnc emails on wikileaks is * super * suspicious . 
  i basically only see those stations so i suppose it would be , since i 'm not in the us and only the big stations from the us really get here , and since the media here is extremely biased ( * actually * every outlet is biased against trump ) , i kind of assumed it was universal over there . 
  if they shit on both candidates i 'm all for it . 
  stay woke \u0394 / s, 
  once when leaving a hotel on my bike at 6am i went to flash the lights to signal for somebody to go , instead honking the horn . 
  i felt so bad . 
  they need to move the horn away from anything else on bikes . 
  i do n't think i 've ever used my horn intentionally on a bike , i do blip the throttle if i need to occasionally . 
  plus it 's a good excuse to listen to your bike  . 
  most harley riders . 
  you can hear those fuckers from a mile away . 
  min icons, 
  nova launcher, 
  hey buddy we are n't all european . 
  does that say he is the 93 most funded patreon ? 
  if so that is absolutely * insane * . 
  i think i 'm going to up my contribution to $ 10 just because i want to see him rise . 
  wow you got him there . 
  anybody know what kind of lexus he drives ? 
  jfc i 'm 18 . 
  something seems so strange about watching 2 random people my age fucking . 
  you do n't need to remind me :(, 
  and deditated wam jokes that stopped being funny as soon as they started . 
  yeah i found one with 9 the other day . 
  i think it shows on all if it 's extremely popular for that subreddit . 
  did we listen to the same podcast ? 
  he constantly called his fans stupid on tbpitu . 
  yeah , you 'd be ~ 0.07 % closer which definitely is n't enough to make a difference . 
  maybe they are n't sure of cause of death , and since it is seen as mysterious it 's made the papers ? 
  op is confident . 
  you might just have to wait a bit ? 
  whos on at halftime ? 
  i doubt people are giving away e for free . 
  if they are please show me where . 
  i do n't think any teenager likes these memes . 
  more like 11-12 year olds . 
  this is extremely unfunny . 
  yeah , and if they were doing it to kill children just use something cheaper . 
  this story is starting to seem less and less likely . 
  when people who are 20 years too old to be driving and need their licence rechecked go 50km/h in a 100 zone it 's not only annoying , but extremely dangerous , to add to that , she pulled out in front of me when i was probably less than 100m away . 
  this lady was oblivious to any of her surroundings and carried on thinking she was fine . 
  what do i do when this happens because it nearly killed me both literally and psychologically . 
  not really relevant i just needed to vent my frustration . 
  i think he , might . 
  that is ridiculously cheap . 
  a lot of things people do for a rush are dumb . 
  it 's not like they do n't know the risks . 
  / u/wauterboi can we get a full instrumental of that ? 
  it was really good . 
  well i hope they are n't making a 7 '' phone ... 
  maybe pixel = premium , nexus = not premium . 
  or maybe just pixel = fully google , nexus = stock android . 
  where i 'm from its ~ $ 800 for the op3 or ~ $ 1300 for every other flagship . 
  either way i 'm broke after buying one , may as well get a pixel . 
  wow how are you able to see in to the future .
