  variations of `` me : two , thanks '' are one of the current memes on / r/me _ irl . 
  that 's even more ridiculous than i thought !, 
  unacceptable . 
  mods are really over the top , and ban you if you do n't agree with their views . 
  [ here 's an out of the loop ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/outoftheloop/comments/3tukip/whats_going_on_at_rme_irl_and_why_are_so_many/ ) , and [ another one . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/outoftheloop/comments/3z2pax/me_irl_vs_meirl_what_happened_there/ ), 
  people got banned for posting [ this image . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7lzwlkc.jpg ) that 's just a meme and they got banned for racism or white people nonsense . 
  what ? 
  nobody bans multiple people as a joke . 
  just look up on google / u/irbytremor and you 'll see what a terrible person she is that ca n't take other people 's opinions . 
  if you post on subreddits similar to / r/tumblrinaction you get banned from / r/offmychest which she mods . 
  they got / r/bannedfromme _ irl * banned * because they could n't handle it . 
  those are just a couple i could think of . 
  yes that 's it 's exactly it , i feel like people need to realise this more . 
  hey i 'm not alone . 
  i would love some way to browse from worst comments . 
  well get your news from multiple sources . 
  if you want unbiased news do n't look at one place , it 's the same as if you just looked at / r/news or / r/politics . 
  but what else will i look down on from my ivory tower ? 
  wow outdated internet memes are sure to bring in unaware customers . 
  do you want to burn the calories or not ? 
  you got ta be dedicated . 
  christ clegg i realise this is a shitty situation , but you do n't need to spam this shit on every platform looking for attention . 
  at this point you look completely desperate ( not that you did n't before ) , since you said you would never come on reddit and you 've been on here twice now . 
  all of your arguments fall flat and the only thing you can do now to get attention is be autistic by posting you getting your bag stolen on a fucking * podcast * subreddit , that you apparently do n't even like . 
  please fuck off i 'm sick of seeing your shit . 
  you can find a lot of his lectures on youtube . 
  i also have the pocketcasts mobile app and somebody uploaded the youtube lectures there ( so possibly some other podcast apps . ), 
  for the masses yes , but i 'm pretty sure google 's is a lot more advanced . 
  next time tell them you picked up some `` four x gold '' , they 'll take you seriously then . 
  dude i 'm late but i did the exact same thing with gmm . 
  war ... war never changes . 
  i also think this sub gets way too caught up in any circlejerk that 's going around . 
  i 'm in huia too ... what floor you on ? 
  i 'm so glad he kept the mustache for the interview , but now i ca n't tell which one is ken . 
  well it 's satire so they will look pretty dumb if they try to claim it 's not . 
  oh wait ... nevermind . 
  i hope i never end up like you . 
  or anybody does for that matter . 
  maybe he no longer stands by that statement ? 
  that was yesterday and does n't reflect how he feels now . 
  release new shoes kanye, 
  i am surprised at the fitting role he had in this movie . 
  we 're doing a meta circlejerk now ? 
  i like it . 
  holy fuck i ca n't contain my excitement . 
  i think they 'll be saltier than trump supporters ever would have . 
  would n't either of them have been the oldest ? 
  yeah , would 've preferred somebody who ca n't handle private emails instead . 
  and when trump started to win out came the `` regardless of who wins '' post . 
  they beat him up for having a trump sticker , he did n't even say he voted . 
  he said when people go underwater though . 
  nemo is n't a person . 
  somebody please talk to me . 
  but seriously res let 's you do the same . 
  just message zootopia . 
  plus the red bar shows he 's watched all of it . 
  even in the side bar or your sub box it should show the red bar . 
  it 's a newish youtube feature . 
  it should show how much of a video you 've seen , and if it is all the way across it means you 've seen all of it . 
  i feel to most people stabbing and shooting are different , since people feel one step removed . 
  similar to the trolley problem of pushing a person off the bridge vs pulling the lever . 
  i think he just does n't like them . 
  you do n't need to make it one side vs the other . 
  i found both memes funny , he does n't like political memes and does n't think they fit . 
  i had an xposed module that did the same a while back . 
  he ai n't signed him but he 's proud of him . 
  yeah i feel like this would work better on another normal sub , or a spin-off sub like maybe / r/askredditnobackspace or something . 
  i also really do n't get how most people make so many mistakes . 
  theres a video of trump talking presidency even further back then that too . 
  yeah but he was thinking about it for at least 10 years , started putting a plan in action 16 ago and then ran this year . 
  he also went to run in 2012 but did n't . 
  it 's not like he just decided `` oh i 'm bored time to run for president . '', 
  plus you can try go run a campaign just like he did , but you 're not gon na be successful . 
  that is a terrible analogy . 
  trying to shove anti-trump stuff where it does n't belong . 
  they need to calm the fuck down . 
  as soon as i heard what kanye said i decided to stay way clear of that place . 
  will we see results ? 
  i 'm not sure , i 've always wanted to build a sleeper car . 
  [ i was meaning more this . 
  ] ( http://hooniverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ford-granada1.jpg ), 
  he 's been acting up since his mum died in 2007 , which i 'm pretty sure is when his depression would 've started or gotten worse , he also had a massive car crash in early 2000s which fucked him up , mix with bipolar , a bunch of concerts in a row , lots of media attention i think it 's hard to stay level headed . 
  im sympathetic and hope he gets help if he needs it . 
  yeah but you gon na use a line on a clearly joking song to dismiss kanye 's song ? 
  a lot of lyrics are true too , and if it aligns with his current behaviour ( `` you ai n't never seen nothing crazier than this n *** a when he off his lexipro '' ) , he even references past freakouts after that line . 
  [ this video ] ( https://twitter.com/cainelovescali/status/743280636945899520 ) always makes me happy . 
  big if true, 
  i wan na see [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/cainelovescali/status/743280636945899520 ) kanye again . 
  nas was right all along . 
  do you know anything about kanye or did you just see the headline and thought you could get some karma ? 
  maybe also post to / r/newzealand since there are more people there . 
  or making any annoying noise really . 
  me too thanks . 
  this is a good question op . 
  wake me up inside . 
  do they send us mars bars ? 
  nice . 
  and it has n't been shortened to make it end too soon either .
