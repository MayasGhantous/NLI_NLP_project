  quality post . 
  it 's heartwarming to see kanyes fam and friends all support him . 
  also shout out to amber rose for saying she was concerned . 
  it 's not even trying . 
  the one on askreddit about redeeming qualities was so low effort . 
  nah as much as a scummy website it is theyre often pretty accurate . 
  huffpo just does n't have many redeeming qualities, 
  [ i saw it here ] ( http://www.inquisitr.com/3734510/kanye-west-nervous-breakdown-amber-rose-kanyes-rants-nervous/ ) but there 's a few articles on it . 
   try to have rational discussions in / r/politics, 
  mate you 're losing before you even start there . 
  no one can judge . 
  they do n't know . 
  i downloaded the video , not at my computer for 7 hours though . 
  if nobody 's uploaded it by then i 'll do it . 
  interested, 
  please stop . 
  it 's uploading to vidme now , should be [ here ] ( https://vid.me/fzij ) when it 's done ( i have pretty shit internet ) . 
  edit : uploaded, 
  the vimeo video got removed , so here 's a vid.me link to it if you wanted to see it . 
  get well soon mr. west !, 
  too much effort . 
  probably easier to be born a twin . 
  , huh ? 
  i turned on the news and they was burying memes . 
  stretch limousine , drinkin ros\u00c9 all alone, 
  as an eraser-kin , you 're literally objectifying me . 
  the full version ? 
  just the audio or with the video ? 
  if you spend all of your time on reddit anyway it does n't matter . 
  no it died . 
  i genuinely do n't know how you could see that post and think it warranted an upvote . 
  it 's not a cool picture , it 's not funny , it 's not relevant , not true and not noteworthy in any other way , yet somehow thousands of people looked at that image , and decided to reward the poster of this useless image and got him to the front page . 
  fuck this shitpost . 
  it 's not wrong . 
  i doubt she could hold his gas . 
  how ? 
  i do n't have to stick my fingers down my ear canal , and the tragus does a nice job of covering my earhole and does n't cause discomfort . 
  battleblock theatre is pretty fun and easy . 
  similarly castle crashers but i do n't find that nearly as good . 
  also speedrunners is a really good one , probably my favourite local multiplayer pc game . 
  if you 're feeling it , the worms games can be fun too . 
  is n't that true with all groups of people though ? 
  they both seem ignorant about a lot more than that . 
  sometimes parents ask questions to help their kids , some older people just hang around . 
  it 's just more relevant when you 're a teenager i guess . 
  found on the kanye interrupting taylor swift video . 
  also definitely not a thug . 
  is n't / r/news a default though ? 
  if it is then there are a lot of people who are automatically subbed or who do n't even go on it . 
  a better way would to measure would probably be sub activity with users visiting or something . 
  yeah i figure it would be less skewed though , so it might be a better indicator . 
  i guess getting all activity and subscriptions and find some way to average it all out . 
  exhaustion had me dead, 
  photo is n't in best conditions , but you look like a pretty attractive dude , i 'm not sure who your match would be though sorry . 
  slightly scratched your carolla, 
  okay i smashed your carolla, 
  you can get 2 door ( or 3 if you include the hatchback ) yaris ' though . 
  i 'd say this is what that is . 
  i 'm from nz . 
  if you know where tell me and i 'll try explore it sometime . 
  me too , thanks . 
  you can email the halls and ask to see a room if you want , i did it last year for whitaker/uni hall . 
  that being said , if you wanted to stay there next year semester 1 you are way too late . 
  [ here are some appetizing pictures . 
  ] ( https://www.instagram.com/huia_mealz/?hl=en ) i was a fan of the `` naan bread '' , or just a plain tortilla . 
  how you gon ' be mad on vacation ? 
  somebody helping ? 
  / r/totallynotmeirl, 
  ya but kanye is a goat . 
  what ? 
  what does that even mean ? 
  i think you have a really twisted view . 
  look at any big pop star and they have more than big rappers , and the rappers that do have a lot of monthly listeners are getting a lot of views off their `` poppier '' songs . 
  what about it do n't you like ? 
  did you just assume my privilege ? 
  big if true, 
  yeah holy shit this subreddit has a stronger circlejerk than nearly any others i browse . 
  dae national has ruined new zealand ???!!, 
  i knew somebody would bring t_d into this . 
  i feel that place is different because it 's clearly circlejerky on purpose , it 's a place for trump supporters , not a whole country . 
  i think it was originally circlejerky , i do n't really go on there unless i see a shitpost it on all . 
  anyway , the second part stands , this is a sub for a whole country including all political parties , but it seems more like / r/fucknational . 
  panoramio was a geo-located tagging , photo sharingmashup owned by google . 
  accepted geo-located tag photos ( uploaded to the site could be accessed as a layer in google earth and google maps , with new photos being added at the end of every month . 
  it was felt all around though , we felt it in auckland so he could be pretty much anywhere . 
  yeah holy shit does facebook make a huge change in battery life . 
  ya i tuck it under my armpits and hold it . 
  i 'm on the toilet right now lifting my shirt up . 
  who tf lets their shirts hang, 
  although technically you * do * have to be of a certain level of intelligence to listen to him , or any artist , i do n't think that 's what he was meaning . 
  if it was satire i doubt 49 people got it . 
  no need for can i , you already are . 
  yeah he definitely did n't cause kanye to start recording , ye seems to always be recording . 
  [ not sure it is a troll ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/biggirlsgonewild/comments/4pkd4x/i_wish_those_were_your_fingers_and_not_my_clamps/ ) , even if she looks like one . 
  [ eyebleach , ] ( http://imgur.com/a/lgnod ) you 'll need it . 
  you should just ram into the cars on either side , you ca n't say it does n't work . 
  well they get a lot of downvotes in their comments , but one of their submissions in a nsfw sub backs this post up . 
  i would not try to finding it either . 
  all dogs are good boys , regardless of gender . 
  what ?
