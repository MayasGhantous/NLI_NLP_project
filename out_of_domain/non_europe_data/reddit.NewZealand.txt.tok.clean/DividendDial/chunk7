  * ninja edit : * it worked , thanks . 
  why not `` this is not fucking awesome '' and then you could optionally use the not . 
  win/win . 
  for me ? 
  `` what is in the safe '', 
  well , if a woodchuck could chuck would , a woodchuck would chuck various amounts of wood depending on its size . 
  lets say it was 6 kg . 
  half that and that 's 3 . 
  divide into 1/3 . 
  that 's 1 , now if we times this number by the meaning of life ( 42 ) it is ( 1x42 = 42 ) 42 . 
  the woodchuck could chuck 42 . 
  no sorry i ate it . 
  maybe ... that 's what 's in the safe ... 
  itt : lots of unsexy names . 
  ok , see you later . 
  no , new zealand is not apart of australia . 
  i really do n't think it 's bad to have two . 
  i foresee nothing but greatness . 
  i 'm not seeing the downside . 
  itt : people who think having two partners is bad . 
  bitches love poop . 
  then i read the edit . 
  why . 
  cpu : i5-3210m, 
  graphics : intel hd 4000, 
  very standard in modern laptops .

  you may now get a real internet upvote . 
  yeah , but do n't get too worried , you should n't count your chickens before they hatch . 
  you would , but you did n't vote obama , so you do n't . 
  op will deliver . 
  swap ? 
  i 've always wanted to be a chick . 
  not op , but i find it saddening because no matter what great things we do , no matter how far we go for something , when we die , all we will ever have been is a small being in a spec in a cosmic ocean ( cliche right ? ) . 
  an unimportant dot . 
  i remember when i was young , i used to think other people were robots , and i was the only human being , then i thought i was crazy . 
  glad there 's term for it .
