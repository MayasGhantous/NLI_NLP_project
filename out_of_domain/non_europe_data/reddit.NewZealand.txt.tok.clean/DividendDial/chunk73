  i always really liked cheryl , i kinda hoped archie would n't abandon her like he did . 
  not everybody is going to cry if they 're exposed to that sort of thing . 
  he looked pretty shocked to me . 
  yeah , plus they seem to only use the color red , so having a different colored marker would n't make sense . 
  is n't that the point of her character ? 
  she 's trying to be a different person and help but she still is the same rich girl at heart . 
  she 'll realise later on money is n't everything and she will choose her friends over her old life . 
  ** why is benson not the dog model  :( **, 
  the real winner here is toyota . 
  * we prey at night , we stalk at night , we 're the rats *, 
  yeah i think this too , they want their hobby to be on the same level as somebody playing any traditional sport . 
  yeah opening with a strawman is not a good way to start . 
  one i went to the guys cut a water bottle , poured vodka in and melted the plastic to reseal it . 
  everything about this car is amazing , but that sound is something else . 
  i think at 30-something million blocks from center ? 
  it 's pretty insane . 
  i do n't think i 've gone more than 3000 too often . 
  they can accidentally press home though , which seems worse . 
  yeah i really , really dislike these videos . 
  it 's not the exact same , but the worst for me is the [ `` hey you there '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbwalf8-q0k&amp;feature=youtu.be ) video . 
  i just went back to the language i usually use ( english new zealand ) , which gives me now on tap back . 
  i use it way to much and do n't really like talking to my phone anyway . 
  sorry should 've said , i did all that . 
  i have a oneplus 3t , i found the problem for recent apps was i had deep clear on for recent apps switcher . 
  i 'm o - . 
  how before me . 
  a lot of his recent videos have been just barely 10 minutes long . 
  looks like steven is milking us for dat youtube money . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ mind ^ ^ ^ ^ tbh, 
  `` oh but they 're nice in [ insert meal with onions ] . '', 
  no , i guarantee if i eat that meal i 'll want to fucking vomit . 
  but then when kj comes back to nz he can drink all he wants . 
  must suck for him . 
  if ur shrek . 
  there are no redeeming qualities about onions . 
  yeah i was saying that it 's still a reasonably bad punishment because it 's a hit for their integrity . 
  yeah i do n't see the reasoning behind it . 
  in nz you can drink pretty much any age , you just ca n't purchase until 18 . 
  i guess that 's something i never see, 
  once they make it to / r/all the normies start to upvote . 
  i use facebook lite . 
  works fine so far , and it 's not a web wrapper like swipe or the others so the features seem to be integrated a lot better . 
  i do n't really use facebook for much other than updating a public page , messaging and idly scrolling so it 's perfect for me . 
  i can see how that would be annoying though . 
  got ta shorten those tweets sumhw . 
  to get karma probably . 
  but just reacting is low effort . 
  there 's only so much to react to in a short video . 
  plus watching somebody watch a video is n't super entertaining . 
  cars generally stop quicker than bikes , plus you are n't going to be tailgating anybody at ~ 240km/h . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.ceddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/6d0pxo/_/dhyv981 ) if you 're interested . 
  i love how they so confidently pulled something out of their ass to use as their argument . 
  tf is the wave genre anyway . 
  you should be able to see the removed comment , sometimes it takes couple seconds but it should load . 
  i have a 3t in nz and i 've been finding it no better or worse than any other phones i 've owned . 
  oh right , nah neither did i. 
  like it 's not a super nice comment but not removal worthy . 
  it probably will be weird if/when it ends though . 
  he looks so happy . 
  tell him he 's a good boy for me pls . 
  i think anybody can park at cpsv and it 's $ 12 for the day . 
  probably the cheapest option if you 're gon na be there for a whole day . 
  carlaw park student village , people usually just say carlaw but cpsv is easier to type . 
  also get off reddit . 
  could somebody please make [ this image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sa6ttmj.jpg ) 16:9 . 
  thanks, 
  `` the uploader has not made this video available in your country . '', 
  yeah dude it 's horrible here , the worst is people that do n't let you in when you indicate , and close the fucking gap when trying to change lanes . 
  i got something a little [ different ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wdrcttx.png ), 
  it 's 2 days old though , i do n't think the post is going to get much more attention . 
  what ? 
  did you even read his comment ? 
  he said the word `` i '' multiple times , it 's pretty clear he 's speaking for himself . 
  he said `` i can not stand when ... '', 
  if you 're serious , you can see a plane in the distance splitting the clouds . 
  ya i realise the point of this sub is like small change for small tasks , but at this point it 's a shit paying job . 
  christ dude , i 'm so sorry . 
  also changes in water temperature do n't open or close your pores , that 's a myth . 
  i do n't trust this guide at all . 
  do you use gpm ? 
  yeah , as long as they 're funny i 'll upvote them . 
  is it consistently freezing at the same time or does it just freeze randomly toward the end ? 
  yeah i am because i see dogs as a friend , i do n't see a cow as one though . 
  it 's pretty funny tbh , / r/shitamericanssay has a bunch of examples of this . 
  have you cleared app data ? 
  meego actually . 
  how so ? 
  how do you flush a sock ? 
  where 's the most important member of the willems family ? 
  benson needs love too . 
  and hopefully longer software support . 
  for 10 pounds i 'm sure it 'll be quality too . 
  or `` my next what ? '', 
  except you would know they 're a furry because it 's their facebook profile picture , banner picture , and it 's in their username online . 
  the less users a platform pays the more it ~ ~ has ~ ~ pays . 
  if an artist had 1 % of the listeners on each platform listening to their music , they 'd get about the same revenue from each platform . 
  is there a link to these ? 
  i 'm curious because everything i 've read stated it was dependent on user number . 
  do you now ? 
  clinton would 've been too though right ?
