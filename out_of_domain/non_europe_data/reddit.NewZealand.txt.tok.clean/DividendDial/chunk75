  when monkeys are the ones running the world i 'll peel a banana their way . 
  and i said in another comment good for them , but they also said it 's an industry , as if the dairy or food industry is out to cause acne and all you have to do is stop having dairy as if people on this sub had n't tried that , yes some acne is caused by diet but people on here have most likely tried that . 
  i 'm just explaining why people would downvoted a pretty presumptuous comment . 
  the second one . 
   `` we want to keep custom subreddit css !!! '', 
   * a few weeks later abuses the shit out of it for the `` greater good '' *, 
  good job / r/videos, 
  they seem to like comparing europe to places in the us . 
  on a / r/starterpacks post about / r/earthporn they were saying what different counties in the eu were in the us . 
  i have no idea what they were basing it off because it made 0 sense . 
  they barely know anything about the world apart from continents , or places on the same continent as them . 
  it 's insane . 
  malta is n't big , but it 's reasonably historical and also famous for its landscape . 
  also there 's an entire dog breed named after the place . 
  probably not far off , and if they did know them i guarantee they would n't know the capitals or even any major cities . 
  you bet your ass they know all 50 states and their capitals by the time they 're 10 though . 
  haha i did say breed , but i 'm sure somebody named their maltese after malta . 
  yeah but knowing countries is n't just about population size , it 's more about cultural impact . 
  and malta is a place that is often referenced in movies or songs or just in beautiful pictures of the country . 
  there 's nothing about a lot of countries that a person in america should know about , countries also do n't have to be significant to be well known . 
  tropical/idyllic countries are often popular with little going for them apart from tourism . 
  this really signalled my virtue . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.ceddit.com/r/diy/comments/6n1t8x/_/dk62c3u ) , i assume it was removed because it was off topic or something . 
  they should 've included that in the email they sent . 
  it wo n't affect gpa , but it does show up as failed on the website and you get to redo it this semester . 
  `` what 's your home address ? '', 
  this group has to be a joke , the founders name is les u. knight . 
  you 're saying that as if too many upper body days is a bad thing . 
  * many americans confuse the us with the world . 
  please tell them you love it , i feel people will complain more than will say they like it . 
  i 'm not much bigger than his starting pictures and i can squat more and dl a lot more , i think he might be skipping leg days . 
  i can hear the people saying to stop being so melodramatic and to just eat the onions . 
  is that why you watch it , assuming you 're a male . 
  could 've hit a bone and further ricocheted , hitting his heart or something . 
  what 's the website in the last pic ? 
  is that because you find it gross or it 's just not your thing or . . ? 
  the glenfield mall is n't westfield anymore ? 
  man i have n't been that way in too long . 
  two capitals when you spell the mans name . 
  the problem for me is if i do cardio i just think about how i could be lifting instead . 
  that 's what i was thinking of doing , just going balls to the wall in this run and doing another run of low chaos , i feel so bad though . 
  also the way i 've read the high chaos ending/story seems like the sadder option . 
  after finding out about chaos i changed corvos thinking in my head to a batman-esque mentality . 
  i guess i 'll just have to change that . 
  the problem i have is i ca n't go to florence , i can go over to the bench press though and do that instead . 
  haha , i will today ! ... 
  hopefully . 
  thanks , next mission i 'll definitely have no regard to human life . 
  i do like how many options there really are , i love getting the drop on people . 
  i think i 'll go hc since it 's easier atm and i 'll probably replay it anyway , and i can practice my stealth . 
  start now so if it happens again you can knock him out and use him for bench presses . 
  awful , but pretty funny to be honest . 
  she 's trying to be nice and saying it was fun and enjoyable and seeing the positives , and he just shits on the date and everything that happened . 
  * what have you done *, 
  oh damn , thanks . 
  i 've started m7 doing low chaos so i think i 'll try stick to that , but i 'm still tempted to go hc so i can do a clean hands run for my lc run . 
  dude ... spoilers . 
  yeah i 'm the same height and a bit over his starting weight but i look quite a bit smaller , maybe just fat and/or muscle distribution ? 
  i wonder how he got it . 
  they do in my accent , also i feel like they rhyme when i try do my american accent but i 'm pretty shit at that . 
   as in most things, 
  you 're being generous by saying most . 
  we win more water in the sea and some cool crazy weather , as well as the the trees dying so we do n't have to keep cutting them down . 
  you ca n't add weights to the barbell ? 
  wtf kind of place is planet fitness ? 
  good bot, 
  you take that back , pickles are a crime against food . 
  there 's this website where people in nz can trade items for money or other goods , should probably put it up there . 
  i do n't wear timbs , i wear *** y e e e z y s *** . 
  holy shit i completely forgot about igoogle , what a strange time, 
  to the united bank of *** m o n e y ***, 
  lol what 's the point of the kit then ? 
  / r/gatekeeping, 
  that 's if you do get addicted you 'll have a vitamin deficiency , if you do it infrequently you 'll be fine , you can also take vitamins if you really want that b12 back . 
  also it can last up to a minute plus . 
  yeah , and the biggest shitposters are n't even kids , they 're young adults who try get upvotes like it 's their job ( for some it probably is ) . 
  what phone ? 
  i assume you tried rebooting ? 
  am i missing something ? 
  this is n't the first solar eclipse in 99 years . 
  that 's what i get for not reading the article earlier , just read it now though and wow , what a sensationalised headline . 
  depends , how many calories are you eating every day ? 
  it 's probably better to get your macros throughout the day rather than all at once . 
  yeah i would n't recommend it either , although this guy was very smart about it and people have gone longer doing the same with no long term side effects . 
  i 'm not the same person who posted the video ... 
  if you 're currently taking 1890 and are wanting to add a 2000 calorie shake to that it 's not gon na do much more than a 1000 calorie shake in terms of macro nutrients , depending on macro amounts you 'll probably shit most of it out . 
  is there any reason you ca n't have food throughout the day ? 
  all good haha . 
  i do n't think anybody here started with the appetite either , i definitely did n't . 
  it just takes some getting used to , and it gets a lot easier . 
  if you want to hit 3k calories you could have a 1000 calorie shake in the morning , then a couple hours later have a ~ 250 calorie snack , at lunch you could have 500 calories of food + 500 calorie shake , then later another snack the same size as before , then you only have 500 calories left at dinner . 
  milk is great for calories ( do n't go too crazy though ) , so are almonds , potato , rice and meat . 
  also at the start try spreading your calories across the whole day . 
  50 cal is very different from 1000 and also for fat people that 's a normal day for them , although i concede i am most likely wrong . 
  would it not still be better to just eat more throughout the day if possible though ? 
  is n't nutrient timing relatively important . 
  since earl released an album sure , but leaked/unreleased stuff of his pops up on youtube/soundcloud pretty often . 
  i ca n't imagine the outrage if any healthy or underweight person started doing that . 
  they 're not saying lean mass is perfectly healthy , they 're saying that it 's a lot healthier than fat mass , since the guy above said they were the same . 
  i 'd say the right side is not too far off what younger people text like here .
