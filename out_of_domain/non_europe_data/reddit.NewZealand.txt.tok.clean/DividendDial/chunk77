  jeff nippard , jeff cavalier . 
  i like to think they tested that in one of their meetings . 
  `` hey we could just black out the notch at the top and put a black bar at the bottom for the home button ... oh uh ... maybe we do n't do that . '', 
  yup , weight is binary . 
  you 're either a literal stick or a fierce beautiful goddess . 
  every damn time i see pineapple lumps i say in my head `` pine-bzz-apple lumps . '', 
  good stuff . 
  wider grip works short head more , short head makes biceps look bigger . 
  also working brachialis can make it look wider . 
  thanks for reading and replying . 
  i think i got volume down , [ here ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ygzmh6z.png ) is my routine . 
  i think it says go down by 10 % on the guide , maybe i 'll do that and just a few less sets for more reps next week . 
  thanks !, 
  also nah they 're not in order , i alternate between the muscle groups . 
  i just wrote them down in the order i remembered . 
  thanks , i guess i 'll deload this week . 
  i put the accessories in another comment , i feel like i have a pretty good range but i might be forgetting about something . 
  [ here is my routine ( accessories not in order ) ] ( https://i.imgur.com/awglola.png ), 
  i was wondering the same thing !, 
  i think that 's cloud atlas . 
  better than quickly i always say . 
  if you 're losing weight go for the largest reasonable value you can for the food , plus if you 're manually writing your fruits and vegetables anyway you can just put them in the app . 
  but whatever works for you is best . 
  late af but if big ramy had smaller legs i feel his larger waist would be even more obvious . 
  `` they 're photo-shopped !!! 1 ! '', 
  maddox was already a cuck , it 's about maintaining that cuckness . 
  mentally feel good ? 
  you 're asking a lot there buddy . 
  good point . 
  idk if it 's true here , but in a video i was watching ( i think uk based ) the guy said that you can spoil the vote by not following the rules ( e.g. 
  ticking in an empty space ) , and the vote is still counted but as nothing . 
  so your vote is counted but not to one of the parties . 
  i think because he got the electorate vote for his district ( epsom ) . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure though . 
  or it 's just an echo chamber and the national voters here are either afraid to post their opinion or just do n't bother since it will be down voted and people will hate on them . 
  huh ? 
  sources ? 
  do you know what subreddit you 're in ? 
  wow good way to influence them to your side for the next election . 
  it 's good that you are n't alienating them , very open minded . 
  that 's a name i have n't heard in a long time . 
  lmao dude it 's pretty much over . 
  nope !, 
  alright well i admire you for holding so much hope . 
  life is a social construct anyway . 
  did you come out as fat to them though ? 
  you need to be openly fat , otherwise they may not actually know . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/comments/2e79y4/dumbbell_ppl_proposed_alternative_to_dumbbell/ ) was just posted in another thread here . 
  what 's your routine like ? 
  you could eat at maintenance and keep lifting try keep max strength . 
  you basically just gained fat and whatever muscle you 'd usually gain with fat gain . 
  in 9 months you could 've made some pretty serious strength gains and gained a lot of muscle . 
  i 'd really recommend getting a proper program and sticking to it going forward , and start to cut down and then bulk while lifting . 
  no , it has to be about race !!!, 
  lmaooo if only i 'd have known . 
  trouble knowing which processor to choose between amd a8-5600k and fx-4100 , they are both the same price , so basically which one i should choose , i am only going to be gaming and internet browsing on it , i also ca n't decide if it would be worth it to go up to an a10-5800k or fx-4300 .
