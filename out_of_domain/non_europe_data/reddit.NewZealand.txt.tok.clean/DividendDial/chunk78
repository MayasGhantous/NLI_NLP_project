  so i noticed the person who was sitting next to me in english class was on reddit , i thought , oh yeah thats cool , until i looked over a while later , and saw he was browsing 9gag . 
  he started laughing at the posts so just to check he was on reddit i looked up at his tabs and sure enough reddit / r/funny open on another tab . 
  i really need to sabotage him or something along those lines , what do you guys think i should do ? 
  what are your favorite songs or musicians that not many people know ? 
  what do you like about them ? 
  * edit * : * i realise title does n't make sense *, 
  * edit * if it had 100 % success rate would you go into cryonic suspension ?
