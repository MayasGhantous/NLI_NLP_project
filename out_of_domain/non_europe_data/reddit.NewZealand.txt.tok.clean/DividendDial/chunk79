  i was wondering if mac os x would run on my laptop ( pavilion dv4t-5100 cto ) , i have read faq , and realise that some laptops do n't work , but am still wondering if it will run . 
  specs :, 
  cpu : i5-3210m, 
  graphics : intel hd 4000, 
  storage : 500gb 7200rpm hdd, 
  current os : windows 8, 
  * edit : * also why would you choose them ? 
  what are some self-taught skills that have proven to be useful , and how ? 
  i know this was posted awhile ago and wanted to see new thoughts . 
  i was wondering what irreversible haircuts you have done . 
  edit : also if you 've received a horrible haircut . 
  a while ago i used to play a game where you were a talking car , and you go around completing missions and helping people out , i used to love the game , i think it was around 2003 but i 'm not 100 % sure . 
  add snapchats here with your name if you want . 
  mine is corbinanderson, 
  edit : i 'm 15, 
  yup . 
  bored , willing to do most things , within reason obviously . 
  i 'll be here all night folks !, 
  * gon na be here for the next few hours *, 
  bored , home alone , in need of entertainment . 
  i watched a movie around 10 years ago ( although i 'm not sure if that 's when it was made ) about a guy who travels through time , and ends up getting stuck in the past . 
  it could have been a program ( not phil of the future ) , but i 'm not sure . 
  i think he gets stuck hundreds of years before now . 
  woops forgot motherboard .

  i have a laptop with an i5-3210m dual core processor , and was wondering how safe it was overclocking . 
  i already have overclocked from 2.50 ghz to 3.0 ghz , and the idle temps are 50c and when playing any game 90c . 
  also was wondering at what point will it fail ?

  have a 1280x1024 monitor , r.a.t 7 , and no keyboard . 
  i was wondering how well this would run on this monitor , also a 1366x768 monitor , and lastly any changes you could make to help . 
  thanks, 
  i got a nexus 7 , and when i got it i changed time and date , and then after a few days , multiple clocks showed up [ like this . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/jzopz8d ) could somebody help me in removing these , i have gone through time and date settings but have not found anything . 
  thanks . 
  or famous . 
  sorry , just incase you wanted to ask . 
  i do n't have many friends i talk to , and most of them are away , i am a guy and only talk to guys and i get really lonely and down , so i was wondering what you guys do ( other than reddit ) to combat this ? 
  i listen to music , play games , tumblr , and reddit , but there is n't much else . 
  edit : added a word, 
  it can be multiple things , but it can only be $ 10000 or less . 
  do n't feel selfish for spending it on yourself , 
  edit : never knew there were so many kiwis on here !, 
  also might help if you say what gender . 
  but hey , no pressure . 
  edit : okay , haha . 
  apart from the obvious like a heartbeat , a pulse , a brain , certain genetalia dependant on gender , or body parts . 
  just wondering what your thoughts were . 
  edit : i ca n't spell .

  ** forenote : could you please do this on [ the new zealand pc part picker ] ( http://nz.pcpartpicker.com/ ) , thank you . 
   what will you be doing with this pc ? 
  i will be gaming , web browsing , some light photoshop and video editing . 
   what is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes ? 
  $ 1300 nzd , the lower the better , but if i can get good performance out of something a little better than that 's fine . 
   when do you plan on building/buying the pc ? 
  probably as soon as possible , not 100 % sure yet but most likely in the next few weeks i 'll start ordering .
