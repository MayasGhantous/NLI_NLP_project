  it 's called porn bro . 
  thats almost as bad as sitting outside yourself by your shitphone and laughing at mcd 's . 
  this thread is frightfully depressing . 
  well you could be looking at it , causing you to think about it . 
  picked up a maths book once , i can second his working . 
  chirp chirp * chirp chirp chirp * *** chirp chirp *** *** chirp chirp chirp chirp ***, 
  my computer optical drive makes a nice beep . 
  based on what i can see , there is a monitor above his keyboard for gaming on pc , which is where he sits , and the pc is n't in the way , the other side is dedicated for his consoles , wiiu and xbox , so he wo n't use the second screen for his pc . 
  instructions were n't clear , got my dick stuck in a fan . . 
   quick !, 
  how many joules does the sun produce in 5 minutes ? 
  well ... 
  3.8 \u00d7 10 ^ ^ ^ 26 j is the sun output each second . 
  so that 's 3.8 x 100000000000000000000000000 . 
  so thats 380000000000000000000000000 . 
  so let 's say he cums for 10 seconds , to keep things simple . 
  that 's 10 x 380000000000000000000000000 . 
  meaning 38000000000000000000000000000 j for 10 seconds . 
  and that 's not even adding the intensity of his ejaculation . 
  so 94 x 38000000000000000000000000000 = 3572000000000000000000000000000 joules . 
  estimate . 
  i 'm a highschool student so i hope i 'm correct . 
  watts is power , joules is energy . 
  there is a difference ? 
  i do n't get it , still retarded . 
  please explain . 
    three words, 
   also need three, 
  thanks . 
  i 'm not sure ... 
  `` oh here , i brought somebody else here . 
  that you do n't know . 
  to eat your food . 
  i hope you do n't mind . '', 
  not sure she 'd like it ... 
  so did i. 
  and they are n't a crustacean from the paleozoic era . 
  he 'd probably * want * to know . 
  ** 3,572,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 ** * or * ** 3.572 nonillion ** * or * ** 3.572 x 10 ^ ^ 30 ** joules in his fap * i think . 
  these may not all sync up but hey , points for trying right ? 
  * ninja edit : i got `` nonillion '' from a reliable [ source . 
  ] ( http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060916124031aai1rua ) *, 
  i. . . can too ... ? 
  * might *, 
  at least you get the thought . 
  you said it 2 minutes ago , there is a [ +1 ] by your name . 
  half life 3 confirmed . 
  fuk bitchz , gt monnies . 
  legit ate this in 2nd grade . 
  truth or dare . 
  you do n't own me . 
  i only got the shotgun guy ? 
  also gay pride , i suppose related to gay . 
  i do n't belong here . 
  you do n't tell me where i belong . 
  depends what mac you want really , also how much ram do you have , if you were to get a mac pro for example , it would blow it out of the water , but if you were to get a macbook air , obviously the desktop pc would be better . 
  it depends on what you are willing to spend , and what you spend on a mac pro you could upgrade your own pc and make it better than a mac pro , so it depends on your situation and what you are willing to spend . 
  i would take a guess and say it would handle it . 
  but do n't take my word for it . 
  what 's your budget ? 
  if you did a build in a [ bitfenix prodigy ] ( http://images.bit-tech.net/content_images/2012/09/bitfenix-prodigy-review/2-1280x1024.jpg ) or another mini-itx build , it 'd probably be portable enough to carry , but you ca n't carry a full atx case or anything . 
  i 'm not sure you can match console portability , unless you did a custom case , or there are tiny cases i do n't know about . 
  what resolution are the monitors going to be ? 
  i think it should be okay for something like 1080p on 3 monitors . 
  oh right , i suppose you could watercool or something at that budget , but if you 're not comfortable , 212 evo should be alright . 
  i 'm not sure about haswell though , i do n't have much experience and apparently they get * really * hot . 
  * ninja edit : [ the new i7-4770k gets really hot when overclocked to 4.4 ] ( http://www.networkworld.com/news/2013/061013-intel-haswell-270677.html ) *, 
  he 's not new either . 
  would i be better off gaming lightly on an apu for now , or would it just be worth it to go extra money for extra power . 
  budget is $ 1300 nzd ( pretty much $ 1000 usd ), 
  okay , i 've heard of this , what is dice cooling * exactly * ? 
  small + hot + bad cable management = wasted money, 
  curious , motherboards that support 128 gb ram ? 
  wow . 
  that 's going to get packed , and when it 's packed in the case it gets hot and parts fail , so watercooling is going to take up space . 
  also i have n't seen a mini-itx that supports crossfire/sli setups , but i could be wrong . 
  and i think it would fit closed loop water coolers but heating would be a problem , even with good cooling . 
  i could well be wrong though . 
  well if i had the money . 
  but i do n't , i was just curious . 
  yeah , if you want portability , i would use console , but if you want power , i would use a full or mid . 
  are they 196gb ? 
  thats amazing . 
  now having all those tabs open on chrome does n't make a dent . 
  yeah , that 's fine . 
  i mean yours should be good to go for video editing . 
  i do n't know yet , but apparently it is , thanks , 
  holy shit . 
  wow . .
