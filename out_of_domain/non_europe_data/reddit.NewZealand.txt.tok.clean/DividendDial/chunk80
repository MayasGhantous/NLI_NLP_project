   what , exactly , do you need included in the budget ? 
  basics ( cpu , ram , gpu etc. ), 
  tower, 
  wifi adapter, 
  preferably a sound card, 
  an apu instead of dedicated gpu will be fine, 
  also if possible webcam and mic , but * they are not necessary . 
   which country will you be purchasing the parts in ? 
  [ new zealand ] ( http://nz.pcpartpicker.com/ ), 
   if reusing any parts , what parts will you be reusing ? 
  1 1080p screen , vga or hdmi, 
  2 1280x1024 screens , vga, 
  i have a mechanical keyboard , mouse , speakers , and headphones . 
   will you be overclocking ? 
  will probably be overclocking cpu down the line , so another cpu cooler could be included . 
   if there 's any specific features you want/need from the rig , please list them . 
  usb 3.0 on front and back , but not necessary on the back . 
  blu-ray player if possible , not necessary . 
   do you have any specific case/tower preferences ? 
  preferably a windowed case , possibly some led 's , i do n't mind noise . 
   do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable os key/license ? 
  i have a copy windows 8 pro . 
  i would * like * an ssd ( around 240gb ) but if that can not fit in the budget just a small ssd boot drive , and a separate hdd . 
  it will most likely be on carpet , so bottom fans may not be ideal . 
  thanks,

  for example , first motherboard , cpu , psu , ram etc. . . 
  just wondering because i am going to order over a long period of time and want to be able to use it as soon as possible . 
  i 'll compile a list or something . 
  wew why da downvote, 
  [ here is the link to the original post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1l01q9/redditors_who_married_their_best_friends_how_are/cbuesau ), 
  it 's hard to explain , but it 's like 0-5 years take up half the bar , then 5-15 take up 1/4 , then the rest take up 1/4 . 
  [ for example , this video of alan watts has literally changed my life . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmrrcypxd0i ), 
  so ... unihouse , saturday the 7th at 1300 suggested by / u/idontrecallbeingmade ? 
  best maximum overclock, 
  being wrong and dying :(, 
  i did n't really know what to put , but i think there is a website to ban it , and it makes i * think * water or vapor or something , out to be some horrible killing chemical , and says things like `` everybody who has inhaled it has died . '', 
  not ^ h 2 ^ 0 . 
  thanks, 
  what is the complete process of pressing print to it printing out ? 
  i 've always wondered . 
  post your steam or origin username . 
  steam/origin dividenddial, 
  it 's an image and it says why she was nude ( because her boyfriend stripped her or something ) and why she kissed the sledgehammer etc. 
  or if there 's a link to the explanation that would also be good . 
  thanks, 
  [ here is the image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cebazyd.jpg ) , i was wondering what the meaning was behind it . 
  i 'll start . 
  when going over your essay , put it into google translate and listen to it , then it 's like listening somebody and can help with editing . 
  i read the faq , it says if you want to know more ask . 
  i did just that . 
  plus i thought there might be some new places , new people here who are from around there , or people who did n't see it last time . 
  there is only 48 comments on things to do so there might be a more to add here . 
  ok , i get it , you hate me before i even get there . 
  thanks anyway , 
  i have tried to search and google it but i could n't find an easy to understand answer . 
  thanks . 
  i was wondering this , and could n't find an easy explanation . 
  thanks . 
  * also what is a ` good ' bitrate , and what is ` lossless ' music ? 
  seriously . 
  theres a no `` advice animal or other similar memes '' rule , and while they are fine sometimes , when there are about 5 on the front page alone it can get a bit annoying . 
  can you read the rules about posting before you do . 
  for example , it 's 7 o'clock , it 's monday , it 's october , and it 's 2013 . 
  there is n't any term for what week it is and i was wondering why ? 
  has n't been one in a while . 
  celly why, 
  he just wants raw game power , and thinks any gaming laptop is as good as a gaming pc . 
  i need to show him otherwise , he has limited knowledge of computers and thinks that nothing comes anywhere close to a gtx titans performance . 
  i really need help here . 
  * money is not an object for him , so roof is probably about $ 5000 .
