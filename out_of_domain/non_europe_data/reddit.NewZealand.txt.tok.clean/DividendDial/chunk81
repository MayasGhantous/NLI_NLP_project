  credit to / u/sraa, 
  if not , can anybody make one ? 
  thanks . 
  i 'm hearing a lot of bad things about it and was wondering if i should get it with fallout 1 on steam for $ 5 , or just fallout 1 on gog for $ 4, 
  i have an i5 4670k and a 550 watt psu , and was looking at a gtx 770 in the future , and was wondering if it would be enough , with 8gb ram , hdd , ssd etc. 
  i calculated at idle it would be plenty , and at full load it would be very close . 
  thanks , sorry i could n't include partlist , as i 'm on mobile . 
  i do n't have a case , but i 'm getting one within the next few days , and i wanted to test my pc , so i was wondering if you could keep the motherboard on the anti-static motherboard bag for a while . 
  i 'm looking for a good micro atx case , preferably one with a window . 
  i was looking at the [ corsair 350d ] ( http://www.corsair.com/en/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/3/5/350d_hero_up_built_1.png ) , as it has plenty of space and good cooling , but still keeps it 's small size . 
  just wondering at what point i can play well at 1080p , thanks . 
  i 'm not too rushed , but just put everything together and just need a gpu , so i was wondering if i should get something like a gtx660 now and a good gpu like 780 ti ( or a newer one ) next year , or wait and get a gtx 780 in a few months and play off of intel hd4600 for now . 
  also why ? 
  curious, 
  what one is more cost effective ( considering i 'm in nz where the prodigy m is ~ 120 and the 350d windowed is ~ 185 , same as the non-windowed version ) , which one looks better , which one has better cable management , which one is easier to build in , etc. 
  thanks, 
  say you were in a round where you were buying , and you had ~ 2500 , would a nova and a cz-75 be a good option , as the nova is only 1200 , and high damage at close range , and the cz-75 is only 300 , and high damage against armored opponents , and good at long and close range . 
  then you can spray with the pistol and still kill with the nova . 
  the nova also has high rewards with money , so you would be getting your money back relatively quickly , and if you really needed to you could pick up another gun to use , and it would most likely be to your advantage because the gun will be worth more than the nova . 
  the reason i do n't say only cz-75 is because if you get into a tight situation , you might need your nova , plus a lot of money comes out of it . 
  thoughts ? 
  i need questions answered for a business paper about spray-cheese ( stupid , i know ) , if you could answer it that would help a lot . 
  thanks , 
  also any suggestions would be great . 
  edit : 1 r in paper, 
  thanks for the support and effort , 
  he is reviewing a terrible gpu , and slams it , because people wanted him to do more angry reviews . 
  thanks for the help . 
  i got a sony hdr-as30v action cam for car racing , which was working great for about 4 races , then the camera started turning off mid race . 
  i was wondering if anybody had trouble with this , or anybody had a fix for it . 
  any help would be great , sorry if this is the wrong place . 
  * fixed : loose battery , padded it with paper . 
  i 'm thinking of getting a second monitor ( current is 1080p @ 60hz ) , and i want a second one , so was wondering to go with 1440p , or 120hz , and i ca n't really afford both . 
  i like to play competitive csgo which pushes my decision to 120hz , and then it could still match my other monitor , although i 'm not sure . 
  any recommendations on any monitors ? 
  specs : i5-4670k , r9-280x , 8gb ddr3, 
  help me pcmr . 
  i 've tried looking for 144hz monitors to go along with my current 23 '' monitor , but can only seem to find 24 '' or 27 '' monitors . 
  thanks . 
  i 've been looking for a 120hz monitor to match my current 23 '' monitor . 
  i have only been able to find 24 '' and 27 '' monitors , apart from [ this one ] ( http://www.asus.com/monitors_projectors/vg236h/ ) , only problem is it 's from 2010 , which slightly worries me , although it matches what i want exactly , and i also want height ajustment and vesa mounting , which this has . 
  does it matter that it 's from 2010 ? 
  the reviews say it has good color for a tn panel . 
  i have a [ 23 '' led monitor ] ( http://www.aocmonitorap.com/root/hk_en/product_display.php?id=205#prettyphoto ) , and i 'm looking to get a second one to match the first one , which means i preferably want one that looks the same , preferably from aoc , same response time , although i 'm not sure what else there is . 
  i am looking for a monitor with either display port , or dvi , as my gpu only has 1 hdmi port , and i 'm also worried about the monitors having different colours , although the only similar aoc 23 '' monitor i could find to those specifications was a ips panel , which i am interested in , although am worried about color . 
  most importantly , i want a 23 '' 1080p monitor . 
  i know a reasonable amount about monitors , thanks for the help .
