  we have giveaways , people ( probably 3 people doing it ) gilding comments and submissions all the time , generally respectful , people ship parts , what else could a community want . 
  if there was a statistic that showed generosity per user , we would be leading . 
  i 'm not sure if that statistic makes sense though . 
  edit : thank you for the gold . 
  may gaben bless you . 
  if you do n't know where i can , i 'm not sure if this counts as begging , but i missed out on that humongous entertainment flash bundle , and i wish i got it , so i was wondering if anybody had any copies , i 'll buy them through steam trading or steam money , or any other payment method you could think of .

  i went over to / r/leaugeoflegends for the first time , and saw they could change their flair to the teams they support . 
  i thought this was a good idea to add here , what do you guys think of this ? 
  i 'm looking for a search bar completely black , with white text saying google or something similar . 
  it 's a classic surf riff , it sort of sounds like dananananananananaaaaaaaa . 
  i 'm not sure how else to explain it . 
  i 've never been happier . 
  i am looking at getting a 120gb ssd soon , and it is about 2/3rd the price of the rest of them , so i was wondering if it was worth it . 
  i 've spent the last few minutes just opening and closing programs . 
  it 's amazing . 
  nearly every time i load a save , it crashes , when i get past that , it will crash when i go through a door , if i pass that , it will crash in vats , lockpicking , terminal hacking , discovering a new area , speaking to people , and even just randomly . 
  i 'm 20 hours in on pc , no mods , and there have been crashes previously , but not as bad as this , can anybody help ? 
  ^ or would most win8 drivers work , because i tried one driver and it did n't install for some reason . 
  i have a 50gb partition on my laptop that i 'm using for windows technical preview ( too similar to w8 , not worth ) , but want to install linux ( again ) . 
  i liked the look and feel of ubuntu , as well as the touchpad support , but the battery life was a bit disappointing compared to windows 8.1 . 
  can anybody recommend a linux distro with good battery life and general laptop support that will be good for school , and have great battery life . 
  i installed deepin from cd/dvd onto my hard drive , and when i went to boot into deepin , i pressed the button , and it booted into windows 8.1 . 
  any help ? 
  i do n't mean to sound like a dick , but i 've been searching to show my friend for a while but ca n't seem to find it . 
  also , what bootloader ? 
  i heard the song on the radio , and i do n't know the station so i ca n't call the station . 
  *** i think *** it says `` it ai n't me , it ai n't so ... '' and in another point `` i ca n't live a lie running for my life ... '' , although i 'm not sure and *** i could be completely wrong *** . 
  i think it mentions snow something , i really do n't know , i heard it somewhere and did n't have luck searching the lyrics . 
  it 's not miley cyrus or ccw . 
  if i need to i could upload myself humming the tune . 
  i just know it 's a female artist , and it 's relatively fast paced . 
  i 've been told in all games recently that i have the american flag payday 2 mask , which is cool and all , apart from i ca n't see it myself , because nobody seems to have the mask . 
  so is there any way i can see this mask to take a screenshot of it ? 
  i have been added by a lot of scammers recently , and one commented on my profile to a fake link , and i was n't friends with the guy and he did n't even have csgo . 
  how do people like this find me ? 
  i have not given any cases or skins or anything , so how do they find me ? 
  i charge it and it will work , and can take the battery out and put it back in and it will work , but i ca n't turn it off and back on later . 
  i was wondering if anybody knew the problem or how to fix it . 
  the camera was used for oval dirt racing , so it was used quite roughly . 
  i want to make a watch face [ like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/csdw2sg.jpg ) , and was wondering if i can do it , and how i can do it , or if there is already one like this . 
  thanks . 
  i put protected apps on a few uh . . on a few apps , my apps disappeared , i then took it off , but my apps did n't come back , i also reset the protected apps and my password , but they have n't come back . 
  how do i get them back ? 
  my one updated normally , but i just checked my mums phone and hers has n't had the most recent two updates . 
  she does n't want to press cancel update because she 's scared it wo n't come back . 
  what can she do to update it that is n't * too * complicated for her ? 
  it looks like a normal app , but when it is dragged up of , it will open up a folder , i saw it on a video but ca n't find it . 
  my touchscreen often lags , which gets annoying when texting . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's the screen itself or apps on the device . 
  it also incorrectly reads gestures , and has phantom registers on random parts of the screen . 
  any help ? 
  ~ ~ i flashed the latest cm12s nightly build on phone , and now it is n't booting . 
  it 's showing the boot animation ( i think , the blue cm head with bubble ) , and getting extremely hot , but not booting . ~ ~, 
  i got it guys !, 
  if anybody wanted to know i factory reset phone through twrp twice and then turned off , went into bootloader , and re-flashed . 
  i do n't know all that was necessary , but it worked . 
  ^ thanks, 
  i was thinking it would be easy with a hopper , and all of the items would go into a chest and into the chest to get converted , but in tekkit classic , there are no hoppers , so how would i get drops from a mob farm into pipes to convert to emc ? 
  what would be the easiest way to ship it to nz ? 
  on the website the only place it looks like it ships to is the us , so is there a cheap service that i would be able to send it through , or could somebody send it to me and i would pay shipping ? 
  i do n't know if the website still exists , but there was a website about 10 years ago where you could go around different monuments , i think including things such as the colloseum . 
  i 'm wondering because i 'm pretty sure [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/kqcypedhdns ) at 8:40 is the same place . 
  if you look there that is what the intersection looks like , the other person ran a yellow light . 
  it was posted a month or two ago . 
  after a while of fiddling , i decided that i could not do it . 
  when flashing supersu and then going into the app , it says :, 
  `` there is no su binary installed , and supersu can not install it . 
  this is a problem !, 
  if you just upgraded to android 5.0 , you need to manually re-root - consult the relevant forums for your device ! '', 
  does this mean i have to do * everything * i did the first time , including installing the bootloader etc. 
  i 'm using twrp . 
  will i have to wipe the device again ? 
  thanks, 
  i ca n't log into an old snapchat build , but i do n't want to update to the latest one , is there a way to get around the message ? 
  i 'm still on the nightly from the original update for the touchscreen , which they then pulled for battery drain with double tap to unlock . 
  is this fixed for the new nightlies with the touchscreen fix or not ?
