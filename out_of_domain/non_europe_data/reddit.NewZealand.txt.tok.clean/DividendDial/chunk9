  / r/firstworldanarchists - fuck your rules . 
  / r/sixthworldproblems - adliuhdalksjndawuo, 
  / r/outside - these graphics are great !, 
  that 's why i did it ... * ^ dun ^ ^ dun ^ ^ ^ d ^ u ^ n ^ n ^ n *, 
  anything with new i5 or i7 really . 
  also i suppose mobile graphics could help . 
  also at least 4gb or ram . 
  well i doubt you could get away with a pentium . 
  what settings ? 
  i 'm just saying in a year minecraft has changed a lot , and if it was a year or two from you playing on an old pentium mobile processor , it probably could n't handle todays minecraft with all it 's features . 
  i used to have an i3 from 2010 and intel hd4000 , and it ran like shit on low , i now have 2012 i5 with intel hd4000 and it runs high fine ( 35 + fps ) . 
  * ninja edit : clarity *,

  yeah , without it i probably would n't have laughed . 
  i would n't know :(, 
  just a ^ * teeny * bit .

  ^ ^ ^ ^ what ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ fuck ^ ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ doing . 
   just to see if they 'd stay with their husbands . 
  were you really ? 
  girl or guy ? 
  the lone wanderer . 
  a curious question , i realise it 's a serious thread , but a lot of people on reddit are n't serious , so i was checking . 
  i did n't mean for it to come off as sarcastic or joking . 
  just wondering , no need to answer if you do n't want to , was it by somebody you were related to or not ? 
  oh okay good , i considered myself weird for doing that .
