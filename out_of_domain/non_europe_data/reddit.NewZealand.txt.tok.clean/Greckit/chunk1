did n't see this anywhere so i thought i 'd try and make one . 
  zimbabwe look like they could win this one against what looks like the full strength sri lankan side . 
  after their performance against nz the other day they 're looking like real dark horses for the world cup , they 'll be eyeing the wi and pak for a qf spot from group b, 
  really hoping misbah gets his 100 even if it does n't officially count . 
  ( \uff0f \u30fb o \u30fb ) \uff0f you can do it !, 
  misbah got the team on his back, 
  . . just stop cutting to crowd shots , surely they realise the audio is fucked ? 
  are they having a stroke ? 
  ... is someone sleeping on the mic ? 
  ian bell looks like a grizzled sea captain, 
  pretty sure mark nicholas did n't know jason holder 's name there . 
  he kept saying '' ... you ... '' awkwardly, 
  hahah athers forgets he 's not in nz , no tui shirts in aus !, 
  dilshan hits 6 4 's in a row ... still gets overlooked, 
  so many full tosses ... 
  woah nice reverse swing now , have n't seen it that much in this world cup . 
  i saw on cricinfo commentary that sarfraz was asking the fielders at the start of the match to bounce the ball on the throw in to try and get it reversing later . 
  [ his inspiration ?

  de kock has a pretty unusual backlift with the face towards point , kinda similar to what mark greatbatch used to do . 
  [ and rockstar !,

  still better than smith, 
  boult not as effective against the double left handers, 
  could n't find a video but here 's the writeup from the [ telegraph ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/cricket-world-cup/8407066/cricket-world-cup-2011-new-zealand-v-south-africa-match-report.html ) :, 
   and yet , for all new zealand 's excellence in the field , there was also an ugly side to their display . 
  immediately after de villiers 's dismissal , their 12th man kyle mills brought out the drinks and began sledging francois du plessis , whose ill-advised call had led to the wicket . 
   du plessis then shoved mills in return , and was surrounded by a pack of angry new zealanders , who could clearly be seen swearing at him . 
   it is easy to see why mills and company wanted to remind du plessis of his error , as he was south africa 's last specialist batsman , and they hoped to put him off his game . 
   but their foul-mouthed , intimidatory huddle was the type of thing you see more often in football than cricket . 
  the icc should discipline mills for his needless intervention . 
  haha they 're not even playing williamson because he 's not a power hitter ? 
  why put him so far down then ? 
  should have just played steyn instead ... 
  [ mechiake no reaction drama ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xj7yzi_mechaike-no-reaction-drama_fun ) ? 
  who would csk replace him with ? 
  irfan pathan ? 
  hahaha did taskin just get body slammed to the ground !, 
  haha if rameez called warner a `` pocket sized dynamo '' in a bar he 'd punch him, 
  ... if they 're playing 5 specialist bowlers why play bopara , an allrounder ? 
  if he wins it for them sure but i 'm surprised they went for bopara the batsman rather than kane/morgan . 
  hahah commentators curse, 
  i honestly want to like the sunrisers but their team selection just sucks , removed all their match winners . 
  prediction : srh scores 160 , bopara scores the usual 23 ( 25 ) , ishant takes surprise 4-fer and they still lose, 
  starc 's secret ? 
  if he can push the field back it might be a bit safer as well, 
  nathan mccullum 's place in the team in danger now ... ? 
  yeah he looked good , who would you drop ? 
  billings ? 
  no doubt mickey was biting his tongue there, 
  [ here is a good video on why online voting would be a bad idea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oadmi ), 
  it went something like this :, 
  reed : must be cool having dr. storm as your father , were you adopted ? 
  sue : yup, 
  reed : cool i hate my parents , i wish i was adopted, 
  reed : where were you born ? 
  * unfunny joke about russian accents *, 
  -- end --, 
  if johnny storm had walked straight out of the comic book into this movie it would have sucked just as hard, 
  i suppose it 's implied that there 's some tragic kosovo war story behind it but that really is all the explanation you get . 
  josh trank just likes michael b. jordan and wanted him in the movie .

  [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/mar/01/super-tuesday-results-live-state-by-state?cmp=ons_b-supertuesday_c-us_g-1 ) accidentally calling ma for bernie !,

  [ 2008 's super tuesday ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_party_presidential_primaries,_2008#super_tuesday ) had 1,681 delegates , nearly double the 880 this year and included states like il , ny and ca so they are n't completely comparable . 
  hillary actually held on to a slim delegate lead coming out of super tuesday ( +20 ) but lost the next 11 states which were more favorable to obama and never recovered .
