  clinton still holds leads in big liberal states but unlike in 2008 they have n't voted yet . 
  for the moment i think reports of bernie 's death are ( slightly ) exaggerated, 
  from the original [ nyt article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/us/politics/hillary-clinton-libya.html?_r=0 ), 
   france and britain were pushing hard for a security council vote on a resolution supporting a no-fly zone in libya to prevent colonel qaddafi from slaughtering his opponents . 
  ms. rice was calling to push back , in characteristically salty language . 
  `` she says , and i quote , ` you are not going to drag us into your shitty war , ''', 
  at first the resolution was just for a no-fly zone and the obama administration was not convinced . 
   mr. gates , among others , thought mrs. clinton 's backing decisive . 
  mr. obama later told him privately in the oval office , he said , that the libya decision was `` 51-49 . '' when they told him that [ a no-fly zone ] could not prevent a massacre , ** mr. obama directed his staff to draft a new , tougher united nations resolution . 
   late that night , mr. araud , the french diplomat , was astonished to get a second call from ms. rice : the united states would not only support intervention , but wanted united nations support for more than a no-fly zone . 
  mr. araud said the turnabout had so shocked him and his british counterpart that they at first suspected a trick . 
  by the end the u.s was actively involved in the drafting of the resolution , lobbying for it and were instrumental in having the resolution authorize `` all necessary means '' , which allowed bombing of ground targets . 
  hillary clinton 's support of the intervention in libya was definitely important and without her support the resolution may not have authorized `` all necessary means '' , or passed at all . 
  you might be surprised at how loyal clintonians can be, 
   susan mcdougal is one of the few people who served prison time as a result of the whitewater controversy although fifteen individuals were convicted of various federal charges . 
  her refusal to answer `` three questions '' for a grand jury about whether president bill clinton lied in his testimony during her whitewater trial led her to receive a jail sentence of 18 months for contempt of court . 
  this comprised most of the total 22 months she spent in incarceration . 
  mcdougal received a full presidential pardon from outgoing president clinton in the final hours of his presidency in 2001 . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/susan_mcdougal ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/10/us/susan-mcdougal-goes-to-jail-for-not-testifying-on-clinton.html ), 
  the code geass gambit, 
  australia and new zealand have obesity rates of 24.6 % and 27.5 % respectively which is n't that far from 31.8 % in the u.s. 
  if this was the major driver of healthcare costs we would see the [ most obese countries ] ( https://data.oecd.org/healthrisk/overweight-or-obese-population.htm ) being the same as those [ paying the most for healthcare . 
  ] ( https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm ), 
  you do n't see that , not because obesity does n't cause increased healthcare expenditure but because the efficiency of the healthcare system is much more important than the relative health of citizens . 
  does anyone think hillary will ever manage to get a democratic house/senate elected ? 
  candidate obama was the best obama,

  nooooooooo ... detroit ... ^ ^ ^ why, 
  `` could it be that some `` main line '' michigan dems -- the exit polls say that seven out of 10 voters in the primary identify this way -- decided that clinton probably had things sewn up and decided to go with bit of a `` heartstrings vote '' in the form of sanders ? 
  maybe . '',

   in general , do you think people convicted of murder during an act of terrorism should receive the death penalty or life in prison with no chance of parole ? 
   death penalty : 58 %, 
   life/no parole : 36 %,

  citigroup [ recieved the biggest bailout ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/id/42099554 ) . 
  ** citigroup ** , literally the reason glass stegall was repealed by the [ gramm -- leach -- bliley act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gramm%e2%80%93leach%e2%80%93bliley_act ), 
   citicorp , a commercial bank holding company , merged with the insurance company travelers group in 1998 to form the conglomerate citigroup , a corporation combining banking , securities and insurance services under a house of brands that included citibank , smith barney , primerica , and travelers . 
  because this merger was a violation of the glass -- steagall act and the bank holding company act of 1956 - citibank was given a two-year forbearance that was based on an assumption that they would be able to force a change in the law . 
   the gramm -- leach -- bliley act passed in november 1999 , repealing portions of the bhca and the glass -- steagall act , allowing banks , brokerages , and insurance companies to merge , thus making the citicorp/travelers group merger legal . 
  boa and morgan stanley were next on the bailout leaderboard . 
  the reason they did n't collapse was because ** they had to be saved ** , they were too big to fail . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/videos/2016-04-11/jane-sanders-we-will-release-full-tax-returns ) is jane sanders saying she has n't done them yet but will release them .

   ... the claim that the only `` sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption '' is one that is `` limited to quid pro quo corruption . '' ante , at 43 . 
  this is the same `` crabbed view of corruption '' that was espoused by justice kennedy in mcconnell and squarely rejected by the court in that case . 
  540 u. s. , at 152 . 
   corruption can take many forms . 
  bribery may be the paradigm case . 
  ** but the difference between selling a vote and selling access is a matter of degree , not kind . 
  and selling access is not qualitatively different from giving special preference to those who spent money on one 's behalf . 
  corruption operates along a spectrum , and the majority 's apparent belief that quid pro quo arrangements can be neatly demarcated from other improper influences does not accord with the theory or reality of politics . 
  ** it certainly does not accord with the record congress developed in passing bcra , a record that stands as a remarkable testament to the energy and ingenuity with which corporations , unions , lobbyists , and politicians may go about scratching each other 's backs -- and which amply supported congress ' determination to target a limited set of especially destructive practices .

  reinvestment among the largest corporations is only around 10 % of earnings , you 're right that that includes more than just r&d but i think his main point is still valid . 
  the largest companies have plenty of cash they could use to expand their business but demand is weak and giving them more money is n't going to change that . 
   . . the 449 companies in the s&p 500 index that were publicly listed from 2003 through 2012 - used 54 % of their earnings -- a total of $ 2.4 trillion -- to buy back their own stock , almost all through purchases on the open market . 
  dividends absorbed an additional 37 % of their earnings . 
  that left very little for investments in productive capabilities or higher incomes for employees . 
  -- [ hbr ] ( https://hbr.org/2014/09/profits-without-prosperity ), 
   stock buybacks , in which companies buy back their own stocks and reduce the number of shares on the market , surged to $ 561 billion in 2015 -- a 40 % increase from the year earlier and the highest since 2007 's $ 721 billion . 
  and that figure is expected to rise another 7 % for 2016 to $ 600 billion , according to goldman sachs .
