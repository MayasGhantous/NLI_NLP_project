   sanders is also something of a loner who shows little interest in hanging out with lobbyists . 
   a few years ago , he attended a democratic senatorial campaign committee retreat on martha 's vineyard , to which lobbyists and other big-money donors were invited . 
  but instead of chatting up the other guests at edgartown 's harbor view hotel in hopes of fattening party coffers , sanders largely skipped the proceedings to enjoy the island 's attractions , according to a lobbyist who attended . 
  [ and that 's not even the worst clinton pardon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marc_rich#u.s._indictment_and_controversial_pardon ), 
   in 1983 rich and partner pincus green were indicted on 65 criminal counts , including income tax evasion , wire fraud , racketeering , and trading with iran during the oil embargo ( at a time when iranian revolutionaries were still holding american citizens hostage ) . 
  the charges would have led to a sentence of more than 300 years in prison had rich been convicted on all counts . 
   hearing of the plans for the indictment , rich fled to switzerland and , always insisting that he was not guilty , never returned to the u.s. to answer the charges . 
  rich 's companies eventually pleaded guilty to 35 counts of tax evasion and paid $ 90 million in fines , although rich himself remained on the federal bureau of investigation 's ten most-wanted fugitives list for many years , narrowly evading capture in britain , germany , finland , and jamaica . 
  fearing arrest , he did not even return to the united states to attend his daughter 's funeral in 1996 . 
   on january 20 , 2001 , hours before leaving office , u.s. president bill clinton granted rich a highly controversial presidential pardon . 
  several of clinton 's strongest supporters distanced themselves from the decision . 
  former president jimmy carter , a fellow democrat , said , `` i do n't think there is any doubt that some of the factors in his pardon were attributable to his large gifts . 
  in my opinion , that was disgraceful . '', 
  clinton himself later expressed regret for issuing the pardon , saying that `` it was n't worth the damage to my reputation . '', 
   clinton 's critics alleged that rich 's pardon had been bought , as denise rich had given more than $ 1 million to clinton 's political party ( the democratic party ) , including more than $ 100,000 to the senate campaign of the president 's wife , hillary rodham clinton , and $ 450,000 to the clinton library foundation during clinton 's time in office . 
  clinton explained his decision by noting that similar cases were settled in civil , not criminal court .

  if i remember correctly even piketty agrees that current wealth inequality is still driven mostly by income inequality . 
  if you were to land a high paying job today ( top 1 % of income earners ) you could become part of the top 1-3 % of wealth holders by the time you die . 
  you 're right that piketty 's * capital in the twenty-first century * argues that wealth inequality is increasingly being driven by wealth inequality itself . 
  perhaps in the future we will need something like a global wealth tax to stave off a new gilded age , where you pretty much need to be born wealthy or marry into it to die wealthy , but we are n't there just yet . 
  executive salaries , taxes and decent paying jobs ( i.e income inequality ) are still very relevant to understanding wealth inequality . 
   the maddening thing about the democrats is that they refuse to see how easy they could have it . 
  if the party threw its weight behind a truly populist platform , if it stood behind unions and prosecuted wall street criminals and stopped taking giant gobs of cash from every crooked transnational bank and job-exporting manufacturer in the world , they would win every election season in a landslide . 
   this is especially the case now that the republican party has collapsed under the weight of its own nativist lunacy . 
  it 's exactly the moment when the democrats should feel free to become a real party of ordinary working people . 
   but they wo n't do that , because they do n't see what just happened this year as a message rising up from millions of voters . 
   instead of a reality check for the party , it 'll be smugness redoubled,

    what does it all mean ? 
  if you 're a clinton fan , probably nothing . 
  to anyone else , it shows that the primary season was very far from a fair fight . 
  ** the sanders camp was forced to fund all of its own operations , while the clinton campaign could essentially use the entire democratic party structure as adjunct staff . 
  ** the dnc not only was n't neutral , but helped with oppo research against sanders and media crisis management .

  i like matt taibbi 's articles so a bit of a shame the main thread for this one got deleted after it had already made it to the frontpage .

  great game !, 
  well deserved win, 
   in the name of making megathreads about the issue at hand , we 'll now be ** removing meta commentary ** within those and redirecting it to modmail or these monthly threads . 
  large amounts of meta commentary within megathreads indicates unhappiness with the megathread solution and ** the reason the vast majority of people are unhappy is not because of meta commentary ** . 
  simply silencing criticism will not fix the problem , it will just make those who are unhappy feel like their voices are n't being heard . 
  surely you recognise that there is already somewhat of a silent protest going on as sticky posts get downvoted to oblivion ? 
  personally i believe megathreads do n't work for big stories like the dnc email leak where one well written article ca n't cover the whole story , the mods should trust the users to upvote the articles they want to the frontpage and downvote when they are unhappy with duplicate spam . 
  the idea that users know what they want to see is the defining principle of reddit after all . 
  for stories that can be summed up by one article like `` clinton picks kaine for vp '' , i think most people are perfectly happy with that being a megathread . 
  user criticism is critical for you to see when something should and should n't be in a megathread and silencing public criticism feels more like pride than pragmatism . 
  but npr said [ questioning if an election will be ` rigged ' strikes at the heart of democracy ] ( http://www.npr.org/2016/08/07/488893858/questioning-if-an-election-will-be-rigged-strikes-at-the-heart-of-democracy ) ? 
  [ according to the imf ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2014/sdn1402.pdf ), 
   lower net inequality is robustly correlated with faster and more durable growth , for a, 
  given level of redistribution ... redistribution appears generally benign in terms of its impact on growth ; only in, 
  extreme cases is there some evidence that it may have direct negative effects on growth . 
  thus, 
  the combined direct and indirect effects of redistribution -- including the growth effects of the, 
  resulting lower inequality -- are on average pro-growth, 
  [ further ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf ), 
   we find an inverse relationship between, 
  the income share accruing to the rich ( top 20 percent ) and economic growth . 
  if the income share of, 
  the top 20 percent increases by 1 percentage point , gdp growth is actually 0.08 percentage point, 
  lower in the following five years , suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down . 
  instead , a similar, 
  increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent ( the poor ) is associated with 0.38 percentage, 
  point higher growth . 
  this positive relationship between disposable income shares and higher growth, 
  continues to hold for the second and third quintiles ( the middle class ) . 
  of course the study of economics itself has become so polarised that you might not believe any of these studies but hopefully you can understand where people are coming from when they argue for better income equality . 
  yeah it 's not working for me either .

  let 's not pretend that during the primary hillary was championing the public option , her [ initial healthcare plans ] ( https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/09/23/clinton-plan-to-lower-out-of-pocket-health-care-costs/ ) did not include the public option . 
   but as she tries to clinch the nomination , mrs. clinton is moving to the left on health care and this week took a significant step in her opponent 's direction , suggesting she would like to give people the option to buy into medicare . 
  `` i 'm also in favor of what 's called the public option ... 
   the idea of allowing people to buy in to medicare has been discussed in policy circles and in congress for decades . 
  mrs. clinton 's husband , former president bill clinton , floated a similar proposal in 1998 , including it in his state of the union address that year . 
  the strategy has been embraced by many advocates of single-payer health care as a way to move more americans into the existing government system . 
  an incremental expansion of medicare was the hoped-for strategy of medicare 's original authors . 
   but it is a new idea in mrs. clinton 's presidential campaign . 
  she has called for a range of health policy overhauls to preserve and expand the affordable care act . 
  she has proposed expanding financial protections for people with high health care costs and expanding subsidies to help middle-income people buy their own insurance . 
  she also has proposed a package of policies to lower the price of prescription drugs . 
   but more recently , she has moved further .
