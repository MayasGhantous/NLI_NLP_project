  without sanders running to her left it is entirely possible it would not have been added to her healthcare plan .

  next level tactics here , maidens till the sun shines boys !, 
  :o soooo lucky so far, 
  realistically it comes down to money , the wicb is pretty much broke . 
  subpar facilities in places like the west indies are the natural result of an icc revenue distribution models that favour the big 3 . 
  if it costs india the # 1 spot then that 's a little bit of poetic justice but as usual blame cricket 's shitty administrators ( bcci and wicb ) . 
  as far as i know [ this is the one they passed ] ( http://wicdn.wisdenindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/infographics-graph-distribution-1.jpg ) . 
  i definitely do n't absolve the wicb of the blame here , they could have bought covers if they had thought about it but the ground should have had good drainage in the first place . 
  that takes more money and probably more regular regional test cricket so this really is more of a reflection of the decline of west indies cricket in general - just thought it was interesting that one of the factors in the decline of west indies cricket infrastructure could be traced back to the team that wishes it would now be better . 
   if i laid with my back up against a wall with my butt up in the air,

  obviously , if the bcci had n't shortsightedly sold their weather machine to world rugby they would n't have been able to sabotage test cricket like this . 
  for comparison [ here is the icc 's ] ( http://www.icc-cricket.com/team-rankings/test ) . 
  and looking at how the rankings are calculated , naturally rugby factors in home advantage :, 
   when calculating points exchanges , the home side is treated as though they are three rating points better than their current rating . 
  this has the effect of ` handicapping ' the home side as they will tend to pick up fewer points for winning and give away more points for losing . 
  in this way , the advantage of playing at home is cancelled out . 
  meanwhile in cricket :, 
   the underlying formula that determines the number of points awarded to each team for its performance in an individual match is identical ; so as with the odi system ** it takes no account of the venue ** or margin of victory of any match . 
  hahah not sure if / s but i think he 's talking about the nz nrl team ( rugby league ) rather than the golden state warriors, 
  past the outside edge is fine , i think people were more annoyed at how many genuine edges went to nobody or the boundary, 
  it 's just a joke , sort of famous for [ being in finding nemo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrad4y3fpdm ) . 
  it 's also a lyric in the owl city song [ the bird and the worm ] ( https://youtu.be/mgptwkrlhzm?t=2m24s ) which i think is what 's being referenced . 
  yes , which is why a carbon tax would likely include a carbon tariff like a border tax adjustment . 
  this was included in the montreal protocol which phased out cfc 's in order to protect the ozone layer . 
   the amount of the tax imposed by subsection ( a ) on any imported taxable product shall be the amount of tax which would have been imposed by subsection ( a ) on the ozone-depleting chemicals used as materials in the manufacture or production of such product if such ozone-depleting chemicals had been sold in the united states on the date of the sale of such imported taxable product . 
  - [ u.s.c. 
  \u00a7 4681 ] ( https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/4681 ) 26, 
  so basically if you import stuff from somewhere else you get slapped with a tax that would make it equivalent to the tax you would face if you produced it in the us . 
  obviously someones going to have fun time properly accounting for the amount of greenhouse gases produced by every product under the sun but it can be done . 
  [ here 's a paper on it ] ( http://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/research/activities-and-programmes/~/media/d183374fe147420297ad7ae249c539e0.ashx ) if you want to know more . 
  just use a forward slash in front of the # to get it to show up :, 
  where in your linked article does it say isds was not initially planned to be included ? 
  the raw output numbers are misleading since the entire economy has grown as well . 
  it would be more accurate to look at [ manufacturing as a percentage of gdp ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/nv.ind.manf.zs?end=2014&amp;locations=us&amp;start=1997&amp;view=chart ) which shows that manufacturing has indeed been a shrinking part of the economy .

  this has always been about regime change , the humanitarian angle is just pr . 
   internal united nations assessments obtained by the intercept reveal that u.s. and european sanctions are punishing ordinary syrians and crippling aid work during the largest humanitarian emergency since world war ii . 
   in 2013 the sanctions were eased but only in opposition areas . 
  around the same time , the cia began directly shipping weapons to armed insurgents at a colossal cost of nearly $ 1 billion a year , effectively adding fuel to the conflict while u.s. sanctions obstructed emergency assistance to civilians caught in the crossfire . 
   meanwhile , in cities controlled by isis , the u.s. has employed some of the same tactics it condemns . 
  for example , u.s.-backed ground forces laid siege to manbij , a city in northern syria not far from aleppo that is home to tens of thousands of civilians . 
  u.s. airstrikes pounded the city over the summer , killing up to 125 civilians in a single attack . 
  the u.s. also used airstrikes to drive isis out of kobane , ramadi , and fallujah , leaving behind flattened neighborhoods . 
  in fallujah , residents resorted to eating soup made from grass and 140 people reportedly died from lack of food and medicine during the siege .

  it 's over if that 's right, 
  bizarre op-ed , mike pence says smoking does n't kill and then cites statistics of exactly how many people smoking kills ( a lot ) . 
  i ca n't tell if this is the dumbest or most brilliant spin ever . 
   `` time for a quick reality check , '' pence wrote . 
  `` despite the hysteria from the political class and the media , smoking does n't kill . 
  in fact , 2 out of every three smokers does not die from a smoking related illness and 9 out of ten smokers do not contract lung cancer . '', 
   pence 's statistics are questionable to the point of being ludicrous, 
  are pence 's statistics really questionable though ? 
  he claims 1 in 3 smokers will die from smoking related illnesses : [ true ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1646951/ ), 
   ** as many as one-third ** of heavy smokers age 35 will die before age 85 of diseases caused by their smoking . 
  he also claims only 1 in 10 or 10 % of smokers will develop lung cancer : [ true ], 
  ( http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/164/12/1233.full ), 
   a cohort mortality study of nearly 1.2 million adults enrolled in 1982 ( 2 ) . 
  based on a 6-year follow-up to 1998 , the cumulative risk of lung cancer by age 75 years , after taking into account competing causes , ** was 10.6 percent in men ** and 4.9 percent in women among current smokers . 
  based on the research that was available to pence in 2000 he 's got it pretty much dead on ... 
  yup totally agree !, 
  not sure if you misunderstood me , i meant mike pence 's op-ed in 2000 is totally bizarre . 
  [ this is a pretty good answer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3snuqu/what_is_stopping_fusion_reactors_from_lasting_a/cwz1y79/ ) as to why tokamaks ( this particular type of fusion reactor ) are inherently on/off reactors . 
  long story short if you shape your reactor like a donut then you need to run a current through the plasma to keep it under control . 
  but you ca n't touch the plasma because it 's the temperature of the sun so they induce a current using magnetic flux just like in an electrical transformer . 
  to make that magnetic flux they need to continually increase the current/voltage in a solenoid ( [ set up like this ] ( http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/originals/30/7b/1e/307b1ec69e3630220090da96df5af3a8.jpg ) ) and you ca n't keep increasing the current forever so you have to stop , unfortunately tokamaks only really work in dc so we ca n't use ac like in an electrical transformer to keep it going forever . 
  if you shape your reactor like a [ wobbly donut ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stellarator ) however you can avoid this particular problem but it 's more expensive/complicated . 
  also [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qukj9pjx3h0 ) with mancow muller getting waterboarded since he comes into it pro-waterboarding and changes his mind in about 5 seconds . 
  according to the video :, 
   hits him with a laser pointer, 
  pretty sure that 's the guys in the helicopter using the laser pointer not him . 
   the box can be shaved, 
  close !, 
  some manufacturing is more easily automated than others , the jobs that are hard to automate have a high incentive to go offshore . 
  the result is that trade accelerates the transition to automation within developed countries , it 's not just a scapegoat we should ignore . 
  haha i guess we should thank bipolarbob as well ? 
  thanks op,
