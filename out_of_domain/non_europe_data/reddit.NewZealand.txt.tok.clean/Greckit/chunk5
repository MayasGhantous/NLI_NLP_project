  that 's ... not the same things at all !, 
  you just know bmac would have had a 3rd slip in ... 
  if you watch the video in the article you can see it . 
  united nations security council resolution 1973 was adopted on 17 march 2011 authorizing the no-fly zone . 
  [ here is a map from nato showing the frontlines in march ] ( http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pictures/2001_09_110922a-libya/20110922_110922a-002.jpg ) ( nato ca n't properly label their map legends , red = pro-qadhafi forces ) . 
  neither in terms of territory nor population did the `` rebellion [ have ] half of libya by the time the west sent in jets '' . 
  that 's not true , switzerland has mandatory basic private healthcare coverage which healthcare insurance providers are restricted from making a profit from , this is considered fairly comprehensive . 
  ~ 2/3 of swiss are covered by these plans . 
  insurance companies offering basic coverage can then offer clearly separate supplemental health insurance for extra coverage ( dental , private rooms etc. ), 
  that they are allowed to make a profit on . 
  their system is unique but primarily non-profit .

   i said to flower , for what was the second time , that i did n't think james taylor should be playing for england . 
  that he was the wrong choice . 
  i have nothing against james but at 5ft 6in he 's one of the shortest men currently playing county cricket . 
  his dad was a jockey and james is built for the same gig . 
  we were facing the fiercest bowling attack in world cricket ; i did n't think he was up to it . 
  what a tool . 
  it does n't even make that much sense , most of the best batsman are n't very tall . 
  [ ` southee could become world 's best swing bowler ' ] ( http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc_cricket_worldcup2011/content/story/508249.html ), 
  he was amazing at the 2011 world cup with allan donald :, 
   `` i have n't changed his style of bowling , although i think we can improve that . 
  i think he can add the inswinger to right-handers and that 's something i need to bring to his game to add some variety . '', 
  he still does n't have that inswinger ... 
  as far as i know he has a cross seam delivery that can come back in but not a genuine inswinger , could be wrong though . 
  conspiracy !, 
  what if boundaries are a tie ? 
  haha tahir is the best, 
  i 'm not sure anyone cares anymore but for my own sanity i wanted to separate the truth from the hysteria here . 
  truth : bannon on the nsc is unusual . 
  the rest is kind of bullshit . 
   missing from the nsc 's principals committee were the cia director and the director of national intelligence . 
  if you follow the article 's own [ link ] ( http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-national-security-council-cia-234381 ) you realise that the cia director has n't been part of the nsc 's principals committee since the [ dni ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/director_of_national_intelligence ) was created in 2005 . 
  this seems perfectly logical since the dni oversees the 16 intelligence agencies just as the cia used to when they were on the committee . 
  as for the dni the wording of the memo regarding his role is the same as it was under bush and functionally the same role as was performed under obama according to both [ wapo ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/the-media-botched-this-trump-story-last-week--and-thats-bad-for-everyone/2017/02/05/e665271e-e974-11e6-bf6f-301b6b443624_story.html ) and [ politifact ] ( http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/feb/01/politifact-sheet-national-security-council-shakeup/ ) :, 
   experts told us outrage on this particular change , or rather reversal , is overblown . 
  despite being regular members under obama , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff did not attend every principals committee , nor did he under bush , according to peter feaver , a duke university professor and former adviser to the national security council under george w. bush . 
   `` on the contrary , if the topic did not touch military issues or had crossed over into political considerations , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff would either not attend or leave the meeting , '' feaver said . 
  `` on this aspect of the issue , the trump team is telling the truth and obama critics are not . '', 
   similarly , john bellinger , legal adviser for the national security council under bush , told npr that there 's really no need for the chairman of the joint chiefs nor the director of national intelligence to be involved if the meeting pertained to , say , hurricane mitigation . 
  in an era where everything criticising trump can be called fakenews \u2122 unfounded outrage just plays right into his hands . 
  honestly i do n't think trump will attend many of the nsc meetings either ... 
  if it 's worth anything [ priebus said they were invited to all the meetings if they wanted to come ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/29/trump-priebus-nsc-steve-bannon ) . 
  even if he was lying i do n't really see the practical difference between being invited and ignored and not being invited at all , it is just an advisory forum afterall . 
  if i was to play devils advocate the only thing i could imagine was if trump was to actually attend the nsc and bannon wanted to control the information that trump was getting , then it might be worth shutting people out . 
  i just think that seems more unlikely right now than trump 's people copy pasting bush 's memo . 
  dni is still a member ( and the director of the cia is as well now ) , see [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5v7tfp/i_didnt_think_id_ever_leave_the_cia_but_because/de0ajy4/ ), 
  i noted in my second sentence that the true concern here is bannon being part of it , especially when i get the feeling that trump is going to skip most of the meetings and just rely on bannon to relay the info , but i do n't think that this specific change to how the nsc operates is some sort of anti-intel agency powerplay . 
  haha i said ** if ** it was worth anything to you !, 
  if trump does n't attend then he will just get his information filtered through bannon anyway so why bother shutting people out ? 
  i was trying to say that i do n't see the point of this being nefarious unless : trump would attend and bannon wanted to control the information he gets in the meeting because he 's an evil puppet master . 
  if trump does n't attend then obviously he can control the information trump receives without these rules . 
   there is one real difference between the two : ellison has captured the support of the left wing . 
  ellison backed sanders early in his primary race against hillary clinton , and was one of the first candidates to announce his bid for dnc chair . 
  his election would generate goodwill from sanders supporters -- or , to put it another way , would avoid the enmity that would surely result from a perez win . 
  in the huffington post , one ellison supporter put it succinctly :, 
   `` keith ellison had incredible support from the quote-unquote establishment side of the party , the progressive side of the party , the grassroots and the elected officials . 
  nobody was clamoring for another entrance , and yet we got one foisted upon us . 
  if tom perez were to win , the message that would send to the grassroots , to labor unions that endorsed ellison before tom perez joined the race , [ is ] that their voices , their muscle , their enthusiasm and turnout does n't matter . '', 
   as jeff stein points out at vox , sanders supporters are likely overstating the power of the dnc chair . 
  but that is all the more reason to throw them a win . 
  if an ellison victory is a modest , symbolic concession , the upside is that democrats will signal to progressive and younger voters , who democrats will be desperate to turn out in 2018 and 2020 , that they are on their side . 
  it would be a choice of utmost pragmatism . 
   but members of the democratic establishment do n't quite see it that way . 
  the hill reports , `` perez supporters have expressed concern about handing the party over to the sanders wing of the party , arguing that ellison would move the party too far to the left . '' and the new york times suggests that democratic leaders pushed perez to run because they viewed ellison as too close to the sanders wing . 
   it appears that the underlying reason some democrats prefer perez over ellison has nothing to do with ideology , but rather his loyalty to the obama wing . 
  as the head of the dnc , perez would allow that wing to retain more control , even if obama-ites are loath to admit it . 
  [ the case for tom perez makes no sense . 
  his supporters say he 's just as progressive as keith ellison . 
  so why bother fielding him at all ?

  this comment thread reminds me that if you 're a progressive voter who does n't think the democrats represent your views you 're kind of in a classic [ repeated game ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/repeated_game ) situation against the party . 
  you ideally want the party and the voter to both ` cooperate ' ( the party represents the voter and the voter votes for the party ) but if the party ` defects ' ( does n't represent your views ) what is the optimal strategy for the voter ? 
  if we look at repeated game theory tournaments like [ axelrod 's in the 80 's ] ( https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerkay/2011/12/19/generous-tit-for-tat-a-winning-strategy/#7d6ba1c266eb ) you can see that if you just cooperate every time , which is what many ` pragmatists ' advocate , you are likely to be taken advantage of . 
  the consensus around the best strategy is some form of retaliation when met with defection followed by periodically offering the hand of cooperation to avoid a vicious cycle ( tit for tat ) . 
  so in defence of / u/orezinlv , taking his ball home is actually a sound strategy in the long run . 
  hahaha yeah this tweet is hilarious , even trump knows how stupid this move was .
