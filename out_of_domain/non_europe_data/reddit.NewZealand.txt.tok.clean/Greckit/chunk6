  i posted this in a different comment : '' [ the case for tom perez makes no sense,

   there is one real difference between the two : ellison has captured the support of the left wing . 
  ellison backed sanders early in his primary race against hillary clinton , and was one of the first candidates to announce his bid for dnc chair . 
  his election would generate goodwill from sanders supporters -- or , to put it another way , would avoid the enmity that would surely result from a perez win . 
  in the huffington post , one ellison supporter put it succinctly :, 
   `` keith ellison had incredible support from the quote-unquote establishment side of the party , the progressive side of the party , the grassroots and the elected officials . 
  nobody was clamoring for another entrance , and yet we got one foisted upon us . 
  if tom perez were to win , the message that would send to the grassroots , to labor unions that endorsed ellison before tom perez joined the race , [ is ] that their voices , their muscle , their enthusiasm and turnout does n't matter . '', 
   as jeff stein points out at vox , sanders supporters are likely overstating the power of the dnc chair . 
  but that is all the more reason to throw them a win . 
  if an ellison victory is a modest , symbolic concession , the upside is that democrats will signal to progressive and younger voters , who democrats will be desperate to turn out in 2018 and 2020 , that they are on their side . 
  it would be a choice of utmost pragmatism . 
   but members of the democratic establishment do n't quite see it that way . 
  the hill reports , `` perez supporters have expressed concern about handing the party over to the sanders wing of the party , arguing that ellison would move the party too far to the left . '' and the new york times suggests that democratic leaders pushed perez to run because they viewed ellison as too close to the sanders wing . 
   it appears that the underlying reason some democrats prefer perez over ellison has nothing to do with ideology , but rather his loyalty to the obama wing . 
  as the head of the dnc , perez would allow that wing to retain more control , even if obama-ites are loath to admit it . 
  you 're right , from another comment i 've made :,

  kurt eichenwald is a lunatic who has a history of making incredible claims without any evidence and violating journalistic ethics . 
  the things he claims to have seen in the oppo book have been [ reported on before ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cxu5rmbxuaeyyel.jpg:large ) . 
  he has previously claimed [ `` i believe trump was institutionalized in a mental hospital for a nervous breakdown in 1990 , which is why he wo n't release medical records . 
  '' ] ( https://youtu.be/lanaxkhyaia?t=2m24s ) for which there is [ no evidence ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/a-reporter-tweets-his-way-into-trouble-with-a-claim-about-trump-that-lacked-evidence/2016/09/14/f8bd2a54-7a95-11e6-beac-57a4a412e93a_story.html ) and which he later claimed [ was intended as ` signal to a source ' ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com.au/kurt-eichenwald-trump-mental-hospital-tweet-2016-12?r=us&amp;ir=t ) . 
  he paid a source for an article about child porn [ `` a violation of generally accepted journalistic ethics . 
  people at the magazine say that was just one conflict among many . 
  '' ] ( http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9e06e2d91230f93ba3575bc0a9619c8b63 ) , and he 's on record using all kinds of [ dirty tricks ] ( https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/10/did-newsweeks-kurt-eichenwald-use-threats-and-brib.html ) to hold up his reporting when it inevitably falls apart . 
  so if kurt eichenwald says `` wowsers , i saw so much oppo research on sanders that it 'd make your head spin and tank sanders ' campaign in seconds but i have no evidence or original reporting proving any of this so you 'll have to trust me ! '', 
  i 'm not exactly convinced . 
  haha yes !, 
  i was there as well , [ here 's the scorecard ] ( http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/64748.html ) for the match . 
  and the match report from wisden :, 
   at westpactrust stadium , wellington , february 16 ( day/night ) . 
  new zealand won by 155 runs . 
   england recorded their second-lowest total in 344 one-day internationals , stumbling to 40 for six and only narrowly surpassing their 86 against australia at old trafford eight months earlier . 
  on a sluggish wicket , the damage was done by new zealand 's batting stars from the previous game . 
  adams wobbled it around to take three for 13 , while astle , whose three wickets cost just four runs , was left on a hat-trick . 
  only flintoff passed 12 as fleming 's clever field placings exerted a stranglehold . 
  new zealand 's 244 was held together by mcmillan , who swept cheekily for his 69 . 
  england experimented by handing the gloves to trescothick , who occasionally looked out of his depth but would be preferred to foster for the rest of the series . 
  england 's fielding was shoddy and three catches were dropped ; hussain later pointed to a lack of intensity . 
  the crowd had no such problems , particularly during the interval , when peter jackson , the director of the lord of the rings , stood on the pitch with a microphone and persuaded them to make howling , growling , grunting noises for use in battle scenes in the two towers . 
   man of the match : a. r. adams . 
  i thought most people believed it was carried out by associates of [ ramzan kadyrov ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/08/putins-dragon ) ? 
   nemtsov 's supporters , including his family , immediately pointed to kadyrov and his inner circle . 
  two days after dadaev 's arrest , kadyrov took to instagram in dadaev 's defense . 
  `` i knew zaur as a genuine patriot of russia , '' he wrote . 
  dadaev was one of the `` most fearless and brave warriors in his regiment . 
  genuinely devoted to russia , ready to give up his life for his motherland . '', 
   putin 's mood was hard to read . 
  orkhan djemal , a journalist with extensive sources inside chechnya , told me he had heard that for days putin would n't take kadyrov 's calls , which caused kadyrov to panic . 
  kadyrov apparently managed to smooth relations with putin , but the fact that people even tangentially related to chechnya 's political \u00e9lite had been arrested on murder charges marked an unprecedented moment in putin-era politics . 
  was the theory that the chechens and ukrainians were working together ? 
  i was trying to put how i feel about this into my own words when i realized that we 've been through all of this before and / u/oct8ngle put it so perfectly in '' [ dear democrats : an open letter from a sanders supporter to democrats calling for `` unity . '' here is how it looks from my side . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/sandersforpresident/comments/4tqox2/dear_democrats_an_open_letter_from_a_sanders/ ) '' before the dnc . 
   in 1992 i served as a delegate for jerry brown to the vermont state democratic convention , when we were trying to beat the first clinton . 
  bill won the presidency promising law and order and an `` end to welfare as we know it . '' he was so in favor of the death penalty that he left the campaign trail to see that a mentally handicapped man on death row was executed in arkansas . 
  as president he signed the north american free trade agreement , the first of a series of `` free trade '' agreements that have destroyed the middle class in the years since . 
  he signed the legislation that ended the glass steagall act . 
  he and his supporters ended whatever was left of fdr 's democratic party and replaced it with what was essentially pro-choice republicanism . 
  a kinder and gentler republican party . 
   democrats rejoiced . 
  after years of wandering in the wilderness of reagan and bush sr. , bill clinton had showed the way to win again . 
  as a bonus , democratic coffers surely filled with money from big business now that the party had so solidly come into their fold . 
   i did not rejoice . 
  nor did bernie sanders . 
  we wanted to continue the proud tradition of being the liberal party , the party of the working class . 
   an argument ensued , an argument that has not ceased to this day . 
  the argument that unfolded between hillary and bernie this year was not new . 
  it has been going on for decades . 
  the clinton forces argued that we could no longer be the party of the new deal . 
  we could no longer win that way . 
  the country had changed . 
   our job , the liberals countered , was not to give in , was not to emulate the republicans in order to win , but to fight for our ideals , to educate . 
  to bring voters back to us through consistency and truth . 
   a quarter of a century has passed and certain results are now in . 
  the cries for `` law and order '' have left the united states with the most people in prison in the entire world , more than authoritarian china . 
  that is shameful . 
  the endless tax breaks for the rich and corporations have left our once great infrastructure in shambles . 
  the calls for `` free trade '' have led to the complete decimation of our manufacturing base and of our middle class , just as was predicted . 
   one can only wonder what might have been if the negotiations for those agreements had focused on protecting our workers and the environment instead of simply giving corporate america places to make their stuff as cheaply as possible .
