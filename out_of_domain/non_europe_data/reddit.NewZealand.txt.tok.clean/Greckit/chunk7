  one can only wonder how much better things might have been if we had said to china , `` if you want to make our gadgets , your workers must have democratic rights , the right to organize , and a living wage . 
  your environmental standards must be comparable to ours , both on paper and on the ground . 
  we will not give up these environmental and work standards that our people have fought for , for generations , for a quick buck . '', 
   so clear are the results of the democrats ' twenty-five year experiment with republican-lite , that even hillary clinton , one of the original champions of the so-called third way , now claims to be an economic progressive . 
   so here i am , dredging up the past and crying `` i told you so . '' of course that ca n't be the point . 
  the point is that not everyone got these things wrong . 
  the liberal and progressive voices of our party , who have been marginalized year after year , stand before you vindicated . 
  bernie sanders stands before you vindicated . 
   your candidate says , `` i voted for the iraq war . 
  i was wrong . '' `` i was for `` free trade '' agreements , hell , i was even for tpp not long ago . 
  i was wrong . '' `` i called certain of my fellow americans ` superpredators ' and said we have to ` bring them to heel . ' i was wrong . '' but not only that . 
  not only are you choosing a candidate who consistently finds herself on the wrong side of history , you are choosing a candidate that is insincere even in her flip-flops . 
  if you were wrong about the iraq war , then why advocate for the libyan one , creating yet more chaos and yet more space for isis ? 
  if you were wrong about `` free-trade , '' then why wo n't you sign off on an anti-tpp statement in the democratic platform ? 
  if we are honest , we all know the answer to these questions . 
   so why ? 
  why should we continue down this terrible path ? 
  everyone knows the answer to that too : money . 
  money that comes out of the pockets of working americans and goes into the pockets of the rich and powerful . 
  money that is diverted from building the modern infrastructure that our country needs to succeed and goes instead to paying for tax-cuts for the wealthy . 
  money that is desperately needed to pay for healthcare and education and instead is squandered on prisons and foolish military interventions . 
  money that should be fairly paid by the rich as taxes that instead is spent on lobbying lawmakers who then pass rules that send that same money to stockholders and executives instead of workers . 
   can we unify ? 
  maybe . 
  perhaps not by the time you celebrate your balloon drop , but over the course of the next years as all of these young awakened people come into their own and use all that they 've learned in the past year to fight for a better world ? 
  maybe . 
   for us , it will begin with your party showing us that you want it to be our party too . 
   we can find unity if together we can field honest , ethically-clean candidates . 
  candidates who have spent their careers in service to the public , not to their own personal power and their wealthy contributors . 
  candidates who are ready to stand up to the economic royalists , as fdr so rightly called them . 
   bernie sanders and the rest of the progressive wing of this party are ready to move forward with the momentum that they 've gained this year . 
  will you treat them with respect ? 
  refrain from marginalizing them ? 
  when in the majority will you give their bills a vote on the floor ? 
  will you work with them to create a better , more progressive america ? 
   i hope so . 
  that will be what i call unity . 
  yes , but what happened to the horses ?

  this was posted 9 hours ago yet i ca n't find a single person pointing out that it 's impossible for trump to be prosecuted for treason !, 
  under [ 18 u.s. code \u00a7 2381 ] ( https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381 ) treason is defined as :, 
   whoever , owing allegiance to the united states , levies war against them or adheres to their ** enemies ** , giving them aid and comfort ... 
  keyword being : ** enemies ** . 
  the united states would have to actually be at war with russia for treason to apply !, 
  is / r/politics driving away all the people that usually fact-check this stuff ? 
  it 's actually the [ pregnant version ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/10/05/tom-cruise-helped-jack-reacher-rosamund-pike_n_1941703.html ) ... 
  i see where you 're coming from acid , you think there 's something like a [ hot-hand fallacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hot-hand_fallacy ) here but it 's not that at all . 
  you 're right that each coin toss is an independent event with a 50/50 or 0.5 chance of losing but hopefully you can also see that losing twice in a row is less likely than losing once . 
  with just two coin tosses you can see that there are 4 possible outcomes : you win twice , you lose twice , you win the first and lose the second or lose the first and win the second . 
  all 4 are equally likely so the likelihood of losing both tosses is 1/4 or 0.25 , the [ way you can do that mathematically ] ( https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/probability-events-independent.html ) is by multiplying each independent event 's probability by the other . 
  in this case 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25 . 
  so the probability of losing eight coin tosses is 0.5 ^ 8 = 0.003 ... or 0.3 %, 
  [ here 's the probability distribution ] ( https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=8+coin+tosses ), 
  consider the ordinary toss in which you call whether it is heads or tails or a modified version of the toss in which the home team is heads and the visitors are tails . 
  if there is a fair coin and flip is there any difference in the chance of winning between the two ? 
  both are 50/50 so really winning the toss by calling it or having it land on heads every time has the same probability . 
  but the chance of calling it correctly regardless of how it falls is 50 % !, 
  getting a 50/50 call right 8 times in a row has a probability of 0.3 %,

   interviewer : so if you were offered $ 400k to give a speech you would turn it down ? 
  * laughter *, 
  bernie : if wall street offered me that ? 
  yeah , i do n't want wall street 's money, 
  damn , i 'd take bernie 's integrity over obama 's pragmatism \u2122 any day of the week . 
  you think they would be paying obama for speeches if he had broken up the big banks , brought prosecutions for top executives , used drug and prostitution charges to get employees to flip or passed and enforced tough regulation that would have seriously cut into their profits ? 
  it does n't need to be an actual kickback for this to be damning of obama 's legacy , that the financial industry likes him at all is more than enough . 
  he used to have a [ mini ] ( http://autoguide.com.vsassets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/mini-large-speedometer.jpg ) so he probably knows that not having the speedometer right in front is n't that big of a deal . 
  buzzfeed today :, 
   but do n't report their false claims . 
  ** rather , only report on claims that you have verified ** , that are important and factual . 
  buzzfeed a few months ago :, 
   a dossier making explosive -- but unverified -- allegations that the russian government has been `` cultivating , supporting and assisting '' president-elect donald trump for years and gained compromising information about him has been circulating among elected officials , intelligence agents , and journalists for weeks . 
   ** the dossier , which is a collection of memos written over a period of months , includes specific , unverified , and potentially unverifiable allegations ** of contact between trump aides and russian operatives , and graphic claims of sexual acts documented by the russians . 
  buzzfeed news reporters in the us and europe have been investigating various alleged facts in the dossier but have not verified or falsified them . 
  cnn reported tuesday that a two-page synopsis of the report was given to president obama and trump . 
   ** now buzzfeed news is publishing the full document **, 
  buzzfeed has zero credibility on this shit . 
  you ca n't say do n't publish unverified info on people we like if you do n't uphold the same standards on people you do n't like !, 
  and many news organisations reported on that . 
  only buzzfeed saw fit to publish the full dossier which by their own admission was unverified and which many other outlets refused to publish . 
  i am just pointing out the contradiction between how this buzzfeed contributor asks the media to act and how the buzzfeed editors have acted in the past . 
  here she says :, 
   the us experience shows the many ways such uncurated dumps of hacked emails fuel viral misinformation , create grave violations of privacy , and leave the public in a state that is more confused than illuminated . 
  but in an editorial in the nytimes an editor of buzzfeed stated :, 
   you trust us to give you the full story ; we trust you to reckon with a messy , sometimes uncertain reality . 
  so which is it ? 
  should journalists publish claims that are verified or publish what they have and let readers figure it out ? 
  and when you 're inconsistent does n't it look like bias ? 
  i 'm just trying to defend proper journalistic standards in a time where the trust in media is plummeting and here is buzzfeed sanctimoniously preaching about it while being blatant hypocrites . 
  but of course it might come across as defending trump so r/politics drones mindlessly downvote .
