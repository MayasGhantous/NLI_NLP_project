i 'd like to see a school try and introduce one of those today , it 'll just be a waiting game for the complaints from parents after that . 
  centipede from new zealand , the world needs a strong leader like trump !, 
  not hillary , who last time i checked , because she cares so much , has n't even tweeted about this attack !, 
  saw this on fb this morning , made my day . 
  meanwhile hillary wheels out pocohontas and co to try and criticize trump , nobody cares . 
  ** dankness rating 10/10 **, 
  ** desire to make america great again intensifies **, 
  crooked hillary * still * has n't tweeted about the attacks in nice , see how much she cares !, 
  i thought she does n't cancel her nap anyway ? 
  like in benghazi ? 
  what was that about him being not for sale ? 
  ** sold !!!, 
  ** desire to indict hillary intensifies **, 
  hillary clinton with her supporters, 
  we all know how unbiased twitter is .

  ** you knew damn well i was a snake **, 
  do n't underestimate the stupidity of hillary 's voters, 
  deport, 
  gutter journalism , ladies and gentlemen, 
  the look you give someone when they say hillary would make a good president, 
  no matter how trump responded to khan , or even if he did n't respond at all - the dishonest media would somehow twist it . 
  khan 's son was a hero - but if it were up to trump ** he would still be alive !, 
  ** , simply he 's being used by crooked hillary for political points . 
  religion of peace my butt . 
  fine - the left can call us racist but they do n't make any effort to debate this because it 's the truth !, 
  removed for `` copyright violations '', 
  i notice she says `` f * ck america '', 
  ** if you hate america so much then get the f * ck out !, 
  oh wait , i get it , she wants welfare but she hates everything else about america and the west . 
  ca n't stand this crap . 
  i 've got one question : ** where 's hillary ? 
  oh wait never mind i know , she 's somewhere else doing jack shit . 
  they 're whispering because they do n't want to `` commit suicide '' . 
  i agree 100 %, 
  i 'm sure it 's just me , but i really find it annoying when everyone goes on about how funny they are ( yes - they 're allowed to do that ) but to me most vines just come off as unfunny and just generally annoying . 
  for me , they were never funny in the first place and now since so many people are doing them , that does n't make it more amusing , it just makes it more annoying that everyone seems to be into it . 
  but this is just my opinion . 
  i never found a lot of mainstream things amusing in the slightest , for example , i never did find annoying orange or john oliver funny at all . 
  yes . 
  i certainly have . 
  just because someone is related to you ( which you have no say over ) , does n't mean you are absolutely * compelled * to like them . 
  i 'm going to be blunt - i 've been happy when non-relatives i did n't like passed away because i had no like for them , so why should it be any different if they 're related ? 
  if i do n't like them , i do n't like them . 
  same . 
  i 'm straight as well and i just do n't find it appealing really . 
  i use porn as imagination and i ca n't do that with lesbian porn . 
  if i was a female i would n't find gay porn hot at all either . 
  i think it 's stupid . 
  men do this all the time . 
  i can say i have discussed how attractive a girl is , in private , not quite in the locker room , but with mates . 
  it 's something we do , and i am sure a lot of girls do it too . 
  suggesting to grab someone by their genitals i agree is unacceptable ( as is mishandling classified information ) , but there are bigger issues facing the nation than this , such as , i dunno , terrorism maybe ? 
  the media and the liberal elites are really scraping the bottom of the barrel . 
  they have to rely on decade-old clips to try and bring trump down , and create outrage that just is n't there for most people . 
  meanwhile , hillary gets away with a crime that most ordinary people would see themselves locked up for doing , or even locked away for doing 1/100th of what she did . 
  if there 's anyone above the law , it 's clinton . 
  i 'm sick of this race - it 's stupid and i hate it . 
  since when do they have to dig out something from over a decade ago that is largely irrelevant to advance their agenda ? 
  it is so stupid . 
  i always had a slight feeling the polls were rigged , or at the very least tilted in hilldog 's favour . 
  i ca n't believe the media gets away with this tripe !, 
  sad !, 
  trump has 15,000 at a fl rally with 12,000 + who could n't get in , as opposed to clinton who ca n't even fill up a school hall . 
  how is it that she 's leading ? 
  even people i know who `` support '' her still hate her guts . 
  remember brexit !, 
  a poll on the day of voting had leave 10 points behind , i did n't believe the polls then and i wo n't believe them now . 
  loyal centipedes just need to go out and vote . 
  is it just me or do i see a hijab in every single photo of a clinton rally ? 
  as usual , john key 's government does what it does best and waits forever before actually doing something and then doing as little as possible to look like they 've actually done something when in reality they have n't done much . 
  if the left says so , it must be right . 
  otherwise we 're all a bunch of racists . 
  also remember what wikileaks released , clinton saying she wants `` open borders '' and meanwhile she 's claiming to be for the american people , where 's the outrage ? 
  trump does know what the media is doing , as well as whose side they 're on ( as well as the moderators at the second debate - awful ! ) . 
  exactly !, 
  where ? 
  i have n't seen anything from the media about bill clinton 's rape past , but of course they do n't want to hurt their goddess and savior hillary clinton , who claims to be all for women 's rights . 
  meanwhile clinton does something bad and trump says something bad , who gets all the `` outrage '' from the media ? 
  luckily a lot of people know , but the media will never publish their concerns , or only in small amounts . 
  you 're exactly right , if an ordinary person does so much as sniff a classified document they get hauled off to jail , while clinton `` apologizes '' and simply gets off scot-free , and people are languishing in prison or suffering demotion or humiliation for doing a fraction of what she did . 
  i agree fully , it 's outrageous . 
  i 'm sure that that clip is n't the only one , there will be more scraping from the bottom , they 're clearly very desperate to get anything they can against trump and blast it to the public . 
  and exactly !, 
  he knows * exactly * what their game is , and he knows * exactly * whose team the media is batting for , even if he loses , the media is probably going to limp away from it with a lot of lost credibility , as will the clinton family and their `` foundation '' . 
  she wo n't get a second term either - she 's far too unpopular , but she 's desperate for power , willing to do anything , and the media will stick with her through thick and thin . 
  neither . 
  i think some people just have different tastes , and you 're right , there 's literally no difference between a straight woman watching gay porn and a straight man watching lesbian porn , it does n't make much sense because there 's no imagination brought by it ; you ca n't actually do it . 
  ca n't stand the failing new york times . 
  bunch of wankers . 
  thirty years ago , i was sexually assaulted by hillary clinton and i 'm only ready to come out about it now , obviously this has nothing to do with her presidential run . 
  i do n't have any evidence , but cnn , wapo and nyt give me an interview please !, 
  exactly , everything was in place for a sequel , but sadly it never happened . 
  it was in my view one of the most underrated games , ever . 
  i mean i was sort of referring to the fact that the whole game feels a bit empty because once the targets are done , there 's literally nothing to do anymore . 
  as opposed to gta v for example , there 's still plenty of possibilities . 
  precisely . 
  i would have definitely played the sequel because i liked and still like the original one so much . 
  yeah she did say every rape victim needs to be heard , but you forgot the secret clause : unless she or her husband did it . 
  and yes , i 'm sure what you 're saying is completely and entirely legitimate , and who cares about your lack of evidence ?
