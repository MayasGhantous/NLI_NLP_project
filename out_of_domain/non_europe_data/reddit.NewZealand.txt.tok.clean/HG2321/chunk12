  shit , i wish i had invested in the salt industry . 
  for fucks sake . 
  ** i do n't give a rat 's arse if i hurt some sore loser liberal 's feelings !!!, 
  nothing to do with islam , the media will say . 
  precisely . 
  nothing wrong with a bit of variation at all , i 'd tolerate a futuristic bf game ( provided it was just one ) . 
  by the same token if they kept making wwii games one after the other that would get old as well . 
  it depends who you ask . 
  she 's now a white supremacist if you ask a certain sub . 
  they ca n't make their damn minds up . 
  they still ca n't even explain how their gender studies degree would net them a job , let alone anything else . 
  fair point . 
  good news for those who like salt on their food . 
  although personally i 'd be less inclined to do so knowing that a liberal cried it out on election night , refusing to accept a democratic result . 
  did his mum knit that for him ? 
  is n't that what most people on the anti-trump bandwagon are ? 
  ( this bandwagon has already been destroyed , it was on the trump train 's tracks when the train was passing through ) to put it simply , previously irrelevant people trying to gain some recognition and relevance . 
  take green day as an example , as well as pocahontas warren and robert de niro ( i had n't heard about de niro or green day for years until this ) . 
  jeez , i never thought i could grow to agree with a democrat this much . 
  i still disagree with her on a crapton of stuff but boy , is she right about this . 
  good thing she 's not like most democrats who will and have chosen party before country , as have a number of republicans . 
  specifically neocons . 
  well the social benefit was getting noticed , as well as praise from the msm . 
  supporting trump , although it would have got them attention , it would have got them criticism from the msm . 
  the uniform could always be set differently for different maps , for example in a vietnam map they have vietnam uniforms while on a korea map they have korean uniforms . 
  i 've seen it done before in different games . 
  my father regularly clogs the toilet on a weekly basis , nobody has been able to beat his record . 
  for him , it 's a badge of honour . 
  perfect example right there , they 'd already had a long string of modern shooters , although ea tried to have a police shooter . 
  many people did n't like it , and they learned their lesson , good on them . 
  if this was cod we 'd be getting hardline 2 . 
  for sure , we 've got modern era fatigue . 
  i remember when we had wwii fatigue from all the wwii shooters at the time , it happens with any era . 
  as you said , time to go back in time . 
  i do n't mind how far back the next bf game is , as long as it 's a refreshing setting , it should be good . 
  the good thing with dice and ea is a lot of the time , they learn their lesson . 
  i agree , i despise suez , it 's always a washout every game , the armoured train does nothing to help , and so on , i 'm sure you 've all heard it before . 
  there 's a reason why half the team usually quits whenever suez comes around . 
  but at least dice and ea actually * tried * to fix it , unlike a certain company which shall not be named . 
  i see where you 're coming from , campers are annoying af ( coming from an ex-camper ) , but i do n't see a hard limit as a way to solve it . 
  it 'll simply punish scouts who actually do ptfo , spot , use flares etc , and probably all the campers will take the sniper slots leaving ptfo scouts out of luck . 
  furthermore most will probably pick the sniper or marksman variants of medic rifles and continue camping . 
  we could put hard limits on the medic class too , but that 'll cause it 's own set of problems . 
  when i go on to customize soldier from the menu i 'm apparently only a level one scout ( i 'm level 11 ) and a level one medic ( i 'm level 4 ) , so i ca n't buy guns that i should be able to buy . 
  it works in-game on the customization there , but not on the menu . 
  anyone else ? 
  i 'm on ps4 btw . 
  reminds me of flyboys . 
  who else ? 
  played my first operations last night . 
  probably not playing another one again because of this . 
  and here i was thinking i was the only one who thought horses were literally invincible after not being able to kill one after emptying a magazine into it . 
  if you guys deport him , please make sure he is n't sent to nz . 
  iran sounds better for the likes of him , considering how much he praises islam . 
  hill shills be like `` but muh popular vote '', 
  guess what , the founding fathers knew that direct democracy would result in a handful of cities deciding who governs america , hence the electoral college . 
  ( 3 million illegals voted so trump most likely won the popular vote too anyway ), 
  and neither should anyone else . 
  at least we 're not gearing up for wwiii like we would be if a certain other candidate had won . 
  we need a different platform , it seems all the time our shit gets shut down . 
  if this place got shut down tomorrow it would n't be surprising . 
  tfw no tavor because nz gun laws, 
   do you carry a gun on your person ? 
  ( either open or concealed carry ), 
  no , the laws here do n't allow it . 
  i would definitely do so if i was allowed to . 
   if so , why do you feel the need to carry a gun in modern day society ? 
  answering this because i said i would carry if i could . 
  i feel the need to because sometimes when you 're in that situation , you 're not often in it , but when you are , you 're damned if you do n't have a gun or the police to help . 
  a tie between the lee enfield 303 and the mauser k98 . 
  good question . 
   views on gun crime as a whole, 
  obviously a bad thing but it has nothing to do with law-abiding gun owners like myself . 
  making guns harder to own for the law-abiding in an attempt to stop gun crime is like making cars harder for sober drivers to own in an attempt to stop drunk driving . 
  basically , crime is crime . 
  better to enforce the laws that are there rather than make new restrictive ones that wo n't do anything ( as we all know criminals do n't follow laws ) . 
   do you own guns for a very specific reason that is n't self defence ? 
  ( i.e. 
  home defence , like the mechanical aspect , fun to shoot and so on ), 
  i 'm a member of a historical re-enactment society , so it started from there , but it 's grown in to pure collection . 
  i 'm especially interested in military bolt action rifles and i own a few rifles for hunting ( namely a ruger 10/22 and a rem mod 597 ) . 
  looking to get a more advanced license and move on to assault rifles and potentially pistols . 
  we 're not allowed to own guns for self defence here anyway .

  new zealand . 
  [ a selection from my collection , if anyone is interested ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yexftop.jpg ), 
  i literally thought you were serious for a second and thought `` are you kidding me '' , i both kill and get killed enough times with that . 
  damn , how much i wish i could change my psn name .
