  tfw you want to send all the capitalists to the gulag but there is n't enough room on the privatized trains, 
  to be fair i experience the same with japanese tanks but at least they can reverse into cover at sufficient speed, 
  this man is god . 
  this man is going to make talin look like an anarchist, 
  the swedish and czech ones . 
  i 've played the british non-turreted line , that 's pretty good although it takes some getting used to ( especially since they change radically at tier 5 with the at2 ) . 
  the t67 is good but i ca n't speak for tanks past that as i have n't got them yet . 
  is this millennium dawn ? 
  i have n't been called a hacker yet but someone sent me a message after a game calling me ( and i quote ) `` a dumb and useless fak '' and that i should sell the game . 
  weird , considering wot was free to play last time i checked . 
  oh yeah , he puts einstein to shame, 
  meanwhile , we are being told that the world has no trust in trump and that everyone outside the us hates him . 
  not true . 
  just another bit of the never-ending ** f a k e n e w s **, 
  i mean , if they 're going to criticize trump , i think it 's rather important that they take a peek in their own backyard first . 
  this is implying that i should be surprised . 
  but why ? 
  i mean it 's gone and been replaced , i do n't see any point in bringing it back . 
  then again , what has wg done recently that has made sense ? 
  japanese . 
  i just do n't like being attacked by something i ca n't counter on the other side of the map , that kind of class should n't be in a pvp game like wot . 
  it 'd be interesting if wg added an option to not play with arty - the argument i hear against that is that it would take forever for arty players to find a game , i think that just about proves the op 's point that most people think the class is of no benefit to the game as a whole and would prefer for it not to be in the game at all . 
  disabling premium tanks is silly , yes , but i personally think removing arty is n't idiotic . 
  i have n't stopped playing because of arty , but that does n't mean i like it and want it in the game . 
  i 'd be happy if the class was reworked but i would n't miss it if it was to be removed ( inb4 `` it wo n't be removed '' - i agree , it probably wo n't be , but that does n't change my opinion ) . 
  would n't mind it . 
  seeing all the clickers saying `` i ca n't find a game '' would be kinda funny . 
  oh i wonder why ... 
  many aspects of 9.18 are steps in the right direction . 
  however , with an upcoming update , they 're allowing a sky cancer back into platoons so it 's a step backwards on that part . 
  i heard that , but zero per platoon will be better . 
  at least we wo n't be seeing the return of three lefh platoons . 
  if you do the swedish td line , word of warning that the sav m/43 is probably the worst td i 've ever played and i hear the ikv 103 is n't much better . 
  true , i do n't think it 's as bad as most of the french tds but i have n't played them . 
  might give it another go . 
  plus you 're right , i suppose most tanks can be good if they 're played right , it 's just harder to play some right than others . 
  all in all , the sav is the worst i 've played but i have n't played the french td line so, 
  amx 40 because of the memes and i do n't have a tog ( feelsbadman ), 
  voted, 
  i hate arty but i seem to see these almost every time i come here . 
  to be honest i just get used to it . 
  gold spam is especially bad on asia servers and pretty much everything except the front of my at8 is susceptible to it . 
  i just wish some people would try and aim for weakspots instead of going straight to gold spam as soon as they see they ca n't pen the front of a tank . 
  the amx 40 is good unless you get bottom tiered ( which i got ta admit is most of the time now ), 
  constantly being bottom tier ( yes , i hate that more than arty ), 
  good old franco and his endless division spam, 
  i 've done the british non-turreted tds up to tier 6 and swedish tds up to tier 4 . 
  the british at series i found to be pretty good , albeit slow so not what you 're looking for , but it they have a lot of armor that can bounce a lot of shells , even some gold rounds in some cases . 
  swedish tds , however , i lost the will to play . 
  the sav m/43 is essentially a bad hetzer and i hear the ikv 103 is n't so good either . 
  i 'll probably do what i usually do ; give it a break then come back to it , i 've driven worse tanks on different lines and gone back to grind those . 
  thanks for the tip !, 
  i used the 122mm as a means of introducing myself to the derp gun mechanic and to prepare myself for the kv2 . 
  it all depends what sort of gun you want . 
  to be honest the m/43 is * okay * , although like i said it 's sorta like a bad hetzer . 
  might just free xp through the ikv , i 've heard so much bad stuff about it . 
  i mean sure , it 's cool if there 's a derp gun there , but not if it 's the only one you can use . 
  the issue is that whenever wg steps in to balance something , it just makes everything worse . 
  gold spam is especially bad on asia server , whatever happened to using skill and aiming at weak spots i 'll never know . 
  armor is pretty much irrelevant for most tanks i drive nowadays thanks to gold spam . 
  i 'd be all in favor of making gold ammo less expensive but less effective , but i know it wo n't happen so long as wg can use it as a cash cow . 
  this is literally how i feel whenever there is a skorpion in the enemy team . 
  hate those things , especially when i play tier 6 . 
  well , any op premium in general, 
  i do n't have anything i can think of to add but i was just coming by to say that this is a great idea !, 
  that 's a problem with the mm then . 
  ideally i 'd like + / - 1 but i accept that it 's probably not possible because of the amount of people who play the game . 
  ** a r t y **, 
  i did n't think the 3 inch gc was that bad . 
  is it just me , or is the whole british tree up to that point so damn awful that i do n't notice ? 
  it 's just mm in general . 
  whenever i play my tier vi tanks i get in bottom tier games literally * all the damn time * . 
  really saps my will to play , so instead of rage quitting , i decide to take a little break before going back . 
  then i go back . 
  and what happens ? 
  more bottom tier !, 
   how often do you actually see lefu on battle ? 
  too often . 
  it very much is the case , considering i often only get to play around 10 battles a day . 
  that 's if she 's alive . 
  i 'd be interested to see sanders/waters . 
  interested , that is , to see how badly they lose . 
  it seems their political careers take precedence over what 's best for the country . 
  oh , only just now ? 
  i feel sorry for the children of these people to be honest . 
  i just hate how they talk like everyone should agree with them . 
  happens here all the time . 
  i mean , if they do n't like trump , that 's fine , but i do n't see why i should be subjected to them going on and on and on about it constantly . 
  thanks , liberal globalism !, 
  where would we be without it !, 
  it 's simple , they put party and their own political career before country . 
  some of them are almost as bad as the democrats, 
  the issue is there are so many issues with the game and sometimes i hate it so much that i consider stopping , but the issue is that i never do . 
  plus , there are very few games like this , with the most obvious alternative being war thunder 's ground forces , and if i do n't think this game is fun at times , do n't get me started on that ... 
  i just stop playing for a few hours before i rage quit , come back later . 
  if it has n't improved , then maybe leave it for a day . 
  times like that just sap my will to play . 
  i got 9/15 of the missions done with the british at line but they usually wo n't do for the missions that require stealth and damage, 
  war thunder is on steam and seems to have mostly positive reviews ( though there is n't much positive i can say about that game myself , but hey , i 'm just one person ), 
  i 'd nerf the lefh ( and yes , i 'd give gold or something to the people who have it ),
