  yeah , war thunder air battles is cool but ground forces is just tedious and as you said ; not that easy to get into ( plus anyone who thinks there is russian bias in wot - play wt ) . 
  i know steam keeps a portion of the revenue but it could attract more players at the same time . 
  ** f a k e n e w s **, 
  keep posting these , pedes . 
  buzzfeed might think it 's real . 
  liberals find racism and hatred where it does n't exist and ignore it within their own ranks ... nothing new !, 
  would not surprise me at all if they went after him next . 
  you know clinton is bad when salon criticizes her, 
  oh yeah , i hear na 's population is kinda low and sea could always have more players , plus these players might spend money in game so there 's an incentive in it for wg too, 
  it 's essentially a double edged sword , it 's unbalanced to some degree no matter what happens . 
  ** slow and steady please clap **, 
  shut up george . 
  you 've said this sort of thing before . 
  i like it that trump is doing something most western `` conservative '' leaders will not do ; he is reversing crazy liberal policies . 
  we need more real conservative leaders like that . 
  the libtards said they 'd all go to canada if trump won ... we 're waiting !, 
  i hope it comes for sale in sea server , looks cool . 
  i know it could make me a bad person ... but hey , it could be worse . 
  they 're not selling the lefh, 
  it 's pretty much most of the problems with arty summed up in one vehicle . 
  the issue is it 's too hard to remove because it 's already in game - it should have never been in game in the first place , and i could go on forever about how there should n't be an indirect fire class in a pvp game or how it encourages the camping it supposedly prevents but i 'm sure it 's been said here before many times . 
  use the ~ ~ disagree ~ ~ downvote button if you want but that 's my opinion and no amount of people ~ ~ disagreeing ~ ~ downvoting will change it . 
  edit : knew it . 
  if you 're going to downvote , at least argue your point . 
  do n't be a coward . 
  i 'd make premium ammo less effective ( hear me out ! ), 
  and maybe less expensive too so there is still an element of skill required as opposed to just pressing 2 as soon as you ca n't pen the front of an enemy tank . 
  i was about to say nice joke but this is actually the truth . 
  i like all tea more than arty . 
  i live in new zealand and i never get under 120 , some nights it has constant spikes where i just have to not play for a while . 
  i heard killping etc but since it costs i 'd rather put up with the ping at the end of the day . 
  ugly both inside and out ... 
  finally . 
  i 'm looking forward to it , i do n't get it when people say `` oh its just a copy of the soviet td so it should n't be in game '' , well , nobody is forcing * them * to play it . 
  these never fail to make me laugh . 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  i look forward to seeing more of these . 
  i 'm sure they do that to tease us . 
  looking after his own political interests again , he does n't care about the country or it 's people , he only cares about himself and he 's only butthurt that trump gets to be president and he did n't . 
  sad !, 
  about time . 
  good on him !, 
  i have played it , and to be honest , i do n't find it fun at all . 
  others have different opinions , i get that , but i just prefer to be in the battle actually competing rather than just clicking on players who ca n't harm me or fight back . 
  essentially the same reason why i do n't like it as a whole - i do n't think it 's fair to be hit out of nowhere without any way to fight back . 
  i do n't really buy the argument that spgs prevent camping either to be honest , i 've been clicked on when i am both camping and not . 
  furthermore , i wo n't say it does n't take * any * skill but there is certainly less skill involved than the other tank classes in game . 
  in short , no amount of skill can realistically outplay a click and there 's no way of fighting back . 
  if you like it - whatever floats your boat i guess , but this is just my view . 
  i doubt it . 
  they tried that in wt and that 's how atgms came about . 
  in my view , atgms are war thunder 's arty . 
  i 'd prefer an italian tree myself and i 've seen some interesting potential swiss trees , to be honest i 'd prefer more original trees but that does n't mean i do n't think it should be in game at all . 
  i know the feeling . 
  just loaded five shots into a t-34 in my valentine ix and set him on fire , then he turns his turret and one-shots me . 
  feels bad man . 
  see how it feels , mcstain ? 
  their stupidity never seems to amaze me . 
  i do wonder how long this can go on for , surely there 's a level of stupidity that will be rock bottom . 
  then again , this is the democrats . 
  it never was okay and it never should be . 
  illegals are illegals , criminals or not . 
  british police can chase up a girl for owning a lemonade stand but they ca n't control these people !, 
  yep . 
  not a chance of them being economic migrants from africa . 
  the `` evil whitey imperialists '' do n't seem to be so bad now !, 
  would not surprise me at all . 
  then again , i never said they could n't break through the rock so i hate to think what 's beyond that, 
  does it say something about me if i was to say that i agree with most of the opinions on here ? 
  definitely agree op . 
  he 's a condescending asshole , just like john oliver and most other liberal comedians . 
  i just hate how her concerts and everyone at them always become all emotional . 
  i mean i get it , that 's some people 's thing , but it 's not mine . 
   and he just acts like a smug asshole to everybody . 
  i find a lot of shows today seem to be like that , sad really . 
  i 've got no idea why anybody would find that funny , but apparently some people do . 
  literally this . 
  really wanted the katyusha when it was being given away , a bit upset when i did n't get it . 
  but it 's a meme ( as is the bm-8-24 ) and i probably would n't have used it at all anyway , thinking about it . 
  he 's just butthurt that trump gets to be president and he does n't, 
  i find it kinda ironic how democrats say `` they have n't committed any crime , they should stay '' . 
  no crime , apart from entering illegally of course . 
  definitely , solid shot needs a buff :( a lot of tank crew would escape the tank as soon as they were penetrated , in my view solid shot should be buffed to take that into account . 
  i find it really sad how , as you said , we ca n't kill russian tanks even after dumping five shots into them when they can kill us in one shot . 
  the germans were supposed to be scared of the sherman firefly ... war thunder does n't do it and the 17pdr justice . 
  that child 's parents sure as hell raised him right . 
  i noticed she did n't even get her original claim right . 
  trump greeted and shook the boy 's hand when he came in . 
  fake news !, 
  jk rowling is and always has been just another out-of-touch liberal elitist . 
  lost all respect for her this election . 
  i guess the only reason i used to like her books is because i did n't know she was this damn stupid - ignorance is bliss . 
  at least they did n't threaten to release the kid 's identity this time , but still ... 
  typical career politician . 
  putting himself , his interests and his political career over the interests of both the people who elected him and the country as a whole . 
  this is implying we should be surprised . 
  thanks merkel . 
  i got ta feel sorry for the germans , this election they have a choice between merkel or schulz . 
  like choosing between cyanide and a bullet !, 
  sick of jk rowling .
