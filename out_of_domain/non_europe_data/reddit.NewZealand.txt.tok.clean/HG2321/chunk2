  the mainstream media does n't care about that anyway !, 
  oh yeah , i forgot , they disregard evidence for anything trump related . 
  you should totally go to the media !, 
  i seem to be agreeing with a lot of these opinions on here . 
  does that say something about me ? 
  i agree 100 % . 
  if a woman hits a man , the man gets told to grow some balls ( i speak from experience ) , but the moment a man hits a woman everyone goes ballistic and gets angry at the man . 
  what 's with the double standards !, 
  it 's not just that , so many double standards are in their favor . 
  feminists go on like `` equality !, 
  equality ! '', 
  then proceed to say things like `` you ca n't hit me , i 'm a girl ! '', 
  among others . 
  they want equality - but at the same time they demand everyone else treats them as some sort of special being , who basically live by the saying `` your rights end where my feelings begin '' and then there are the double standards which i 've already covered . 
  rant over . 
  i could n't agree more . 
  i have n't worn jeans for over ten years and i do n't have any in my wardrobe ( and i 'm 17 ) so that definitely says a lot , i ca n't remember when i last wore them at all in fact , but i know i did , and i hated it . 
  yes , they do n't look professional in the slightest , they shrink , they fade easily , and one thing that ** really ** grinds my gears is that these days you can buy jeans new with rips and holes in them . 
  as if they could n't already look more unprofessional !, 
  i do n't get why some people seem to worship denim as their lord and savior . 
  i know people say to wear them in and that but in my view i might as well just get something that you can wear straight away and be comfortable in , as well as something that does n't shrink , fade , look terrible or look unprofessional . 
  rant over . 
  the democratic party is like that kid who gets caught cheating on their phone and then gets angry at the person who caught him cheating because they looked at his phone . 
  no i do n't believe it is . 
  people who think it 's racist to even express the slightest amount of concern are just deluded , racism means believing a certain race is superior or inferior to another . 
  but , some people think shouting `` racist '' over and over ( donkey does this a lot ) actually constitutes a valid argument . 
  no , it does n't , and we should be allowed to have a free discussion on the issue , as with any other issue . 
  furthermore `` immigrants '' is n't a race ( and a large portion of our immigrants come from the uk ) so that 's why i think the racism argument is total and utter crap . 
  deport and ban them . 
  fraud is fraud . 
  also if they want to work they can apply for a work visa , rather than break the law . 
  if they do n't have enough money to begin with then they should n't be allowed to come here in the first place . 
  been to tijuana , did n't get robbed but i get your point . 
  was n't a nice place . 
  and i agree , then if not a wall the border at least needs to be secured somehow , and the illegals as well as their anchor babies need to be dealt with once the border is secure . 
  so yes . 
  we need a wall , or at the very least a robust and secure border . 
  i agree . 
  sjws literally go around * looking * for things to be mad about . 
  furthermore they spend all their time rambling on about some irrelevant issue that no sane person could give a rat 's arse about . 
  and yes , they get triggered so damn easily it 's not even funny . 
  do n't even get me started on their retarded safe spaces . 
  now we know why obama 's daughter was caught smoking a joint . 
  in my humble opinion no celeb should be given cult status or seen as a role model because they 're just not . 
  beyonce 's music sounds like a cat being run over by a steamroller and her behavior is no example that an impressionable youth should be following . 
  it 's not unaffordable if you go to a reasonably priced one , live within your means and , most importantly , study a degree that actually has a good chance of getting you a proper job ( yes , i 'm looking at you , gender studies sjws ) . 
  when i said `` the border at least needs to be secured somehow '' i was referring to those . 
  i was thinking exactly the same , everybody who is involved should be held responsible for it somehow .

  the time i play can be quite random but it 's usually in the afternoon from about 4-5pm to about 12am , sometimes longer in weekends ( with a dinner break of course ) , occasionally in the morning . 
  returning battlefield player looking for some people to play with ( all of my mates either do n't play or have xbox ; _  , possibly make friends and just have some good times . 
  i do n't have a mic but i 'll get one in the future . 
  just getting used to bf1 . 
  if you want to have some casual fun feel free to add me , that 's all . 
  i look forward to gaming with some people here . 
  i do n't have any requests except please do n't be too serious and get mad if we lose . 
  this is a game after all . 
  when you got ta liberate the holy land at 10 but you have school photos at 9, 
  and i thought i was the only one !, 
  yes , i implied that racism was discriminating against an individual for their race , and yes , i agree with you , some people * do * , but i 'm not one of them . 
  a large deal of migrants come from the uk , so me being racist against them would mean i was being racist against myself , considering i 'm of british ancestry . 
  i 'm one of those who wants to have a reasoned argument , rather than being shouted down as racist whenever i suggest that current levels of immigration are too high . 
  now , you have n't accused me of that - yet , but that 's my standpoint . 
  if we had the numbers that we do coming in and 100 % of them were from the uk ( for example ) i would still have an issue with it because of the issues i 've previously outlined . 
  it seems that with her someone else is * always * at fault . 
  she does n't manage to maintain a sufficient level of police , blames previous police ministers . 
  wtf !, 
  and now this too !, 
  someone or something always gets the blame from her . 
  pointing fingers is n't going to cut it , judith !, 
  you actually need to take action , thought about that ? 
  i do n't know , but last time i checked , pointing fingers does n't actually solve the problem at hand . 
  thanks , john key !, 
  because it 's very safe here and heaven on earth compared to some places where some migrants come from ( and some places i 've travelled to ) . 
  now , do n't get me wrong , sensibly controlled immigration is totally fine , but we have to make sure we do n't make nz like the country the migrants come from , they left that country for a reason . 
  not everyone can have a piece of the cake . 
  sorry , that 's just the way it is . 
  great , thanks for clearing that up . 
  i never ever thought i would say this , i repeat never in my whole life , but i got ta say it now . 
  i would prefer fascism to this crap . 
  not that i would always prefer it over anything , but this is too far . 
  these leftists need to stop one way or another . 
  rome has truly fallen . 
  once it was the bastion of civilisation , what the fuck happened !, 
  ** the wrong obama was elected **, 
  this guy is based af , seriously . 
  ** these liberals are ducking ridiculous !!!, 
  in monte grappa , it 's possible for me to be shot ( and shoot at people ) from behind the wall between outside and the bunker . 
  we should at least ensure that there is a level playing field so that anyone who wants to succeed can do so if they work . 
  but the government is n't focused on that , obviously a lot of things take priority over the living standards of new zealanders and inequality . 
  just strengthens my belief that we need to properly enforce our immigration laws and that no faith at all should be put in the government to solve this situation . 
  i hear stories like this every week , for crying out loud !, 
  do n't try and exploit the system firstly , then , second of all , do n't play the victim card . 
  do n't worry , the economy is doing well !, 
  who cares about anything else !, 
  i do n't know about that , but they 're going after a meme frog of all things so i do have to question some things about them . 
  not being able to say what i want at college campuses ( or anywhere for that matter ) just downright pisses me off . 
  if people ca n't handle free speech they should be at home sucking their thumb .
