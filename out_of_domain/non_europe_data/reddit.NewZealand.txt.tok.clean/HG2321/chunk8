  go to your safe spaces and fucking stay there !, 
  ** here comes hannipede on fox !, 
  illegals , pack your bags !, 
  they could always go in the donald j trump presidential library along with the rare pepes, 
  i wonder what jeb is up to, 
  the wall just got ** ten feet taller **, 
  ** this is a historic moment , centipedes **, 
  we 'll be able to tell our children and our grandchildren how we were a part of this . 
  how we fought in the great meme war . 
  they can ban us , they can get triggered at us and they can downvote us but they will never beat the might of kek !, 
  obama , maybe you should stop shilling for hillary and whining , and maybe , i dunno , go back to being president ? 
  you better enjoy this joke while it lasts !, 
  i would tell liberals to stop doing this but i realised that if they stop doing it they 'll start winning again . 
  let 's let them dig their own grave . 
  he 's a woman ? 
  tfw you make a joke but it 's over after 8 years, 
  watching the results in florida , waiting for the panhandle , i have n't felt that nervous in a while . 
  i never guessed pa , mi or wi would go red either . 
  damn , you centipedes sure did your job . 
  i was about to call him a racist but oh yeah i remember the liberals said he 's black , he ca n't be racist . 
  we would have beat any liberal cuck . 
  ** the liberal tears are so sweet , i 've been waiting for this for years !, 
  that 's if he 's alive in 2020, 
  exactly . 
  he came back from the brink !, 
  for sure , same with pennsylvania . 
  i was real worried some `` extra results '' would come in because they rigged it , although even their rigging could n't stop trump winning . 
  wow , this is really deep , i do n't think i 've read anything with more truth this week . 
  i know i 'm not american , but they try the same tactics here . 
  they talk down to us , they treat us as if we are nothing , they do n't listen to us , and worst of all , we are called names because of whom we choose to vote for . 
  this needs to be spread everywhere . 
  if these liberals want a civil war , i 'm not at all worried about who will win . 
  ** this is why people voted for trump you dumb and worthless liberal pieces of shit **, 
  fuck , kids at my pre-school cried less than this . 
  grow a pair !, 
  well someone now ca n't control the us with daddy 's oil money . 
  i was expecting mass suicides at ctr hq . 
  precisely . 
  it 's worse than brexit and i thought nothing could be worse than what i saw there . 
  it 's like the second american revolution , whether those cucks like it or not . 
  medic guns need to be beefed up ? 
  wtf !, 
  most of the medic rifles are op as it is , and too many people play the medic class just for the guns with no intention of actually playing medic . 
  wait they actually have to * hire * people to support hillary clinton ? 
  holy shit ... 
  wow ... 
  they were really that desperate . 
  and clinton called project veritas a conspiracy theory . 
  tfw when you want civ 6 but your computer is a potato, 
  yeah , i will for sure , although i only have an intel hd 4000 however that runs civ v just fine . 
  thanks for the reply !, 
  i 'm not sure of what medic guns are weak because i do n't play that class but if they are truly so then fine , i do n't see an issue with buffing them up . 
  however , if they buffed up the ones i experienced , which are op as it is , that would make medics nearly invincible . 
  enough medics already camp using the mondragon sniper as it is . 
  okay , i just had a brain aneurysm trying to find all the irony in that . 
  ** we ** are the sexists , yet we never condone the raping of * anyone * . 
  we are they misogynists , yet we never support a religion which treats women like garbage , and we are the women-haters , but we call out bill clinton for being a rapist . 
  yet the liberals do this , condoning the rape of a woman just because her husband beat their candidate of choice fair and square . 
  these leftists make me sick . 
  never mind the fact that sanders opposes tpp and clinton came to oppose it because trump did . 
  although we always knew facts had never been popular with liberals . 
  they look for anything , literally anything , slap `` news '' on it and that 's it . 
  the issue is , people keep reading that tripe . 
  great , some more lefties . 
  as if we did n't have enough of them here already . 
  it 's ironic how the anti-trump protester has a no-tpp thing on the other side of the sign . 
  ** do n't we all love trump girls , folks **, 
  damn , wish i knew girls like that round here . 
  already been unfriended by several because their feelings ca n't handle my trump memes and support of trump . 
  they 're trying to make themselves believe that trump is hitler and as a result they shut themselves out of any rational discussion or debate on the topic , as well as facts proving their stupid argument wrong . 
  thanks a lot for doing the giveaway !, 
  good luck to everyone else  personally , i 'd love to win the glorious modular mechanical keyboard . 
  oh , my mistake , should have mentioned them . 
  from top to bottom, 
  steyr m95 long rifle, 
  i `` longtom '' ( bsa manufactured ), 
  gewehr 88/model 88 commission rifle, 
  another steyr m95 carbine `` stutzen '', 
   that 's awesome . 
  do they all work ? 
  have you considered getting a mosin nagant ? 
  i 'd imagine it will be in the russian dlc . 
  thanks !, 
  to my knowledge they do , i used the longtom at a reenactment yesterday , and i 'm firing the m95s at a shoot , i 'd imagine they 'd all work . 
  in fact i 've already got a mosin nagant ( 91/30 ) , i should have photographed it . 
  will perhaps upload it and others another time . 
  do you have a mosin ? 
  good gun that 's for sure . 
  thanks again !, 
  i 've never actually shot it , although it feels solid and i 've disassembled it etc , i 've only shot my k98 ( not in picture ) . 
  and i too find that it 's weird they did n't include the russians ( and therefore the mosin ) considering how big a part they played in the war , same goes for the french . 
  oh that sucks :( i 'm from new zealand so it 's pretty okay regarding gun laws . 
  i would say though , if you get a chance to shoot one , definitely take it . 
  http://imgur.com/gallery/oo0h1 here 's a picture of the mosin, 
  haha thanks again , that 's something i 'd like to know for a lot of rifles , it 's like whenever i hold one , i 'm holding a piece of history . 
  although i think this one had a rather quiet life compared to others , it was found in a crate packed with cosmoline in the middle of russia , according to the previous owner . 
  the same can not be said for most other mosins though , and most other guns . 
  for example my k98 was captured by the russians on the eastern front and rebuilt after the war . 
  need a more advanced license for those where i live sadly ; _ ;, 
  thank you !,
