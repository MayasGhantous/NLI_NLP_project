  i found the most enjoyment jumping into the simple platform map . 
  just my thoughts . 
  what new project skins ? 
  unfortunately you ca n't start without a refinery and assembler . 
  i would love it if you could say create the iron furnace by hand , or with a simple hand tool that can refine/assemble small simple parts slowly . 
  then once you have the iron furnace going , you could build another machine which can craft simple parts , eventually being able to build a proper refinery and assembler , or something of that sort . 
  so there is progression from nothing . 
  yeah or something like that . 
  i do n't like the idea of having to start off with a ship/station that has already built 90 % of what you need . 
  who was being sarcastic , op or the commenters ? 
  yeah sorry , i meant this . 
  rome 2 sorry , i thought i added the flair but apparently not . 
  an example where this might happen is :, 
  i set my units up in a defensive battle . 
  a little way off my right flank is a grove of trees , perfect for putting in some skirmishers ready to flank around the enemy infantry and pummel them from behind . 
  however unfortunately , the enemy chariots got slightly too close to the grove , and revealed my skirmishers . 
  they then turn to charge the skirmishers . 
  should n't be a problem , chariots are super vulnerable to skirmisher fire , and even just one volley should be enough to seriously reduce their numbers , if not destroy/route them . 
  unfortunately , despite me having issued an attack command on the chariots , which are approaching , the skirmishers do not fire , and proceed to enjoy getting mowed down . 
  maybe i had a second unit of skirmishers there that got just clipped by one chariot , the whole unit gives up . 
  i then have to spam command them to move away , out of melee , line up again , and start the attack animation . 
  by the time this happens , the other unit of skirmishers has routed , and the chariots turn on the ready to fire skirmishers , repeating the whole process again . 
  it 's little things like these that make the battles so clumsy , and very hard to do anything other than repetitive hammer and anvil . 
  maybe i am doing something wrong . 
  yeah i make sure to turn this off on most cases , and enable it when it is facing specific units . 
  yeah i am starting to realise this . 
  cheers . 
  it 's just so frustrating that they have the potential to do so much damage , and win very quickly if used right , but because of some clumsy game mechanics they can easily lose you the battle . 
  goku got [ metaphysical manipulation ] ( http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/metaphysics_manipulation ) and can now manipulate all of reality , physical or otherwise . 
  superman got [ insomnia inducement ] ( http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/insomnia_inducement ) goku can no longer fall asleep . 
  supes seems to be getting the short straw today . 
   terrors of the night : can always choose to fight night battles, 
  this is going to help so much . 
  story time :, 
  i was once attacking a castle with a moderately sized force , the defenders in the castle had a smaller force , so i felt confident . 
  unfortunately though the enemy had a large amount of reinforcements from another army coming . 
  i decided to attack anyway , figuring i could retreat if it seemed hopeless . 
  once i was in the battle , i realised that the defenders allies were n't on the map yet , so i plausibly had time to take the castle . 
  i bum rushed the castle with everything i had , knocking the gate down with some ballista . 
  after destroying the defending force , i took over the castle , positioned my now ammoless ballista in the gateway , and placed archers all along the walls . 
  the reinforcements eventually showed up , but now that i had the defenders advantage , and their only way in was a tiny gap being blocked by siege weaponry , i destroyed that army as well . 
  i have since used this bum rush a fort tactic multiple times in rome 2 , always to good effect !, 
  wait , were you in orbit ? 
  hopefully all these upvotes will lead to more donaters . 
  i am 50/50 on this . 
  on one hand , more progression is good , and having the challenge of getting into space is a good first step . 
  but :, 
  it might be hard to balance on multiplayer . 
  maybe planets should be a reward you get from building up towards a large ship and getting a warp drive to explore and find a place to settle . 
  saying all that , something needs to change , the current system of everyone starting with nearly everything you need is not good gameplay . 
  tempted to try this myself . 
  how do you get it zero upkeep ? 
  so if they used a river or a cliff for the map border as the interface , instead of a red line , but otherwise everything was the same , you would be ok with it ? 
  can someone explain the hype of underground battles ? 
  in what way would it be different from above ground battles other than different ground textures ? 
  it would be cool if the default ordering of the players list was ( the best attempt at ) matching the players by position . 
  i always do this at the start of games , and there is no reasoning i have in this process that is beyond a computer , in fact , i would guess the computer could do it better . 
  i think comparative to how often cash is used in other countries , nzs cash use is probably ` rare ' . 
  here 's a decent summary of expected temperatures in nz :, 
  it has been on the extremer ends recently , with this winter just been particularly cold . 
  the other thing about auckland weather is that it is extremely changeable . 
  it it common ( read : majority of the time ) , that when it rains , it will also be sunny that day . 
  do n't rely on it except in the deep of summer . 
  lastly , auckland is great for hiking and exploring , great hikes both out west and south . 
  i 'm gon na try give the best case scenario , and assume just playing a pokeflute sound in a top level dream wo n't do jack . 
  getting snorlax to descend into deeper levels of sleep wo n't be too hard . 
  i propose that the first level dream is very similar to his normal day . 
  ** dream 1 : ** snorlax is lumbering around kanto , swatting away the occasional beedrill , looking for a snack . 
  he stumbles upon a bountiful harvest of local fruit , finishing off the meal with a drink from a bulbasaur bulb . 
  replete , he snuggles up to a nearby tree and promptly falls asleep ... 
  ** dream 2 : ** snorlax finds himself in jhoto , a land unknown to him . 
  no worries , snores snorlax , food is everywhere . 
  he pulls himself up , and trundles off in search of his other love . 
  no fruit nearby , snorlax continues . 
  trying to take bites out of the occasional thing to look appetising . 
  no luck . 
  eventually he comes across an apricorn tree , at last , something that smells like food . 
  he takes a bite , ugh , far too hard . 
  snorlax sniffs again to be sure it 's not one of those pinecone things he found earlier . 
  nope . 
  tries to take a chunk again , the apricorn does n't budge . 
  snorlax used crunch . 
  it 's super effective . 
  at last the apricorns give way and snorlax eats their delicious inner juices . 
  tired , and a little frustrated , snorlax falls asleep , chest ridden with apricorn shells ... 
  ** dream 3 : ** snorlax finds himself awake again , unsatisfied by the pitiful apricorns . 
  new surroundings , unfamiliar land . 
  a strange desert with a volcano smouldering above him . 
  why would i fall asleep here snorlax wonders , there is nothing here . 
  the ground rumbles , rocks near him start to evaporate . 
  he rolls to look at the volcano , but sees no apparent change . 
  the grumbling suddenly gets louder , but is interrupted by a sweet scent , causing him to roll back , nose chasing the smell . 
  his stomach starts to join in on the grumbling , and the earth settles . 
  his body picks itself up and moves towards the source of the smell . 
  stewed chesto berry , he recognisess . 
  it changed , something else , iapapa berry . 
  plonking along he wonders how long it has been since those apricorns , was it a few hours ago , it felt like weeks . 
  snorlax realised he had n't gone this long without food , nevermind , the smell must be just around the corner of this volcano . 
  minutes , days , weeks ... months later , snorlax does not knows , he stumbles upon a young girl , stewing berries . 
  a little kip of a pokemon at her side .
