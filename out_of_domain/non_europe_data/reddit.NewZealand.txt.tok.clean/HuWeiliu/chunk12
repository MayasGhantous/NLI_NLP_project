  they were both muddy and tired from exploring . 
  uncaring for strange pokemon , intent on one thing , snorlax marches over and intruduces himself to the fresh stew . 
  surely there are other berries around here , some better kai . 
  he looks around and no longer sees a volcano , as it has been replaced by endless dying bushes . 
  each bearing one sour berry . 
  snorlax 's rampage begins , tearing apart the land for what unsatisfying food is left . 
  still hungry , but out of options , snorlax resorts to sleep as his only escape ... 
  ** dream 4 : ** starled awake by his growling stomach , snorlax looks around . 
  pleased to see a healthy forest with plentiful food , at last , home thinks snorlax . 
  although , he ca n't remember seeing that mountain ridge before . 
  nevermind , to lunch !, 
  snorlax reaches out to pick a handful of tasty berries from his side.he moves to place the berries in his gaping mouth , but finds his hand empty . 
  he goes to grab another handful , only to find them disappear once again . 
  snorlax looks around , trying to find where the berries could have gone . 
  a short way off , just down from that ledge snorlax spots another pokemon , munching on some apparent berries , juices flowing down it 's face . 
  the pokemon looks oddly like snorlax , only small and puny , with weird black marking . 
  son of a houndour , that little bastard is eating my berries !, 
  with that cheeky little grin . 
  snorlax swipes for more food , only to be intercepted by this little pokemon . 
  snorlax felt that it should really spend less time munching , and more time snoring . 
  and so began the decade long battle been snorlax and munchlax . 
  snorlax never being able to quite catch munchlax , who would taunt him by eating the spoils around him . 
  the island became barren as these two fought , snorlax always losing . 
  snorlax 's hate for this creature , and frustration with getting so close every time he attempts to eat , eventually overcome his hunger . 
  his health seemed to be draining , no longer with quite the same amount of belly fat . 
  snorlax used sleep !, 
  ** dream 5 : ** snorlax finds himself in a world unknown , neither space nor time makes sense here . 
  snorlax floats through this realm , all sense of matter and being pulled from him . 
  centuries are passing in the blink of an eye . 
  his sanity is only being maintained by one solid feeling . 
  an anchor to the identity of a snorlax . 
  hunger directs him to continue . 
  hunger beyond what the world can know . 
  starvation without death . 
  snorlax becomes one with the grumble in his stomach , nothing else exists . 
  nothing to perceive but hunger . 
  millennia pass , leaving snorlax as an etherial mist of great voracity . 
  the mist finds itself eventually with a new perception . 
  colour ... size ... shape . 
  some sort of ... tube , grumbles the mist . 
  the mist starts to solidify , expanding into a stomach , a head , a mouth . 
  absorbing this strange tube , with some sort of apricorn shape on it . 
  close enough to be food . 
  close enough to satisfy the great craving . 
  snorlax 's body reassembles , only to find that the tube is not food in the slightest . 
  a great anger overcomes the snorlax , suddenly aware that something is tormenting him . 
  snorlax gets ready for battle . 
  snorlax uses snore and lets out the longest and greatest snore to ever be percieved . 
  spacetime struggles to maintain itself on all levels . 
  but from that snore , from the great release of air , the tube makes a noise . 
  a sweet , melodic noise . . 
  `` and that 's how we will wake up snorlax '' , says cob . 
  have n't played much , but i know path of exile ( diablo rpg style game ) is to be recommended . 
  can someone give an explanation for why they would n't . 
  i 'm trying to think of an ulterior motive , but it 's just a fucking flag . 
  what do people get out of messing up the process enough to get the flag they want ? 
  india express is a decent indian take away . 
  their pakoras are really good . 
  further down , but new flavour is good ( not as good as it used to be , and far more popular/busy , but still worthwhile ) . 
  i just watched this this afternoon , and within 30 minutes in i had decided i did n't mind if they all died , because they are clearly far too incompetent for the jobs that they have . 
  from entering the atmosphere as soon as they approach the planet , and not looking at weather patterns , to having no regard to cross contamination . 
  biologists that stick their finger in clearly aggressive animals ' mouths . 
  people with clear symptoms of alien infection not informing anyone , especially the person they love who they just swapped multiple bodily fluids with . 
  rushing to explore day 1 with minimal daylight left , despite having years of supplies . 
  removing helmets in an alien atmosphere , find living organic material , and proceed to touch it . 
  reading your comment was so satisfying , i 'm glad i was n't the only person who felt this way . 
  i 've seen a few gifs like these . 
  they are really cool . 
  but they all seem to involve ripping apart some cardboard packaging for something . 
  what up with that ? 
  i feel like 10 minutes is n't very long . 
  i 've waited over half an hour for team builder games . 
  i would suggest waiting longer ? 
  while the hulk movie was n't particularly core , i thought it was waaaaaay better than the likes of say captain america , or iron man 2 . 
  the one without all the stones in it is after credits of avengers 2 . 
  the one with the filled gauntlet ... i have no idea . 
  i 'm guessing it 's been done for this ? 
  are they military allies or just defensive allies ? 
  if any are defensive , see if you can force them to attack you ( tresspassing , raiding etc ) , it wo n't necessarily immediately pull everyone else into the fight . 
  he 's a kiwi , we have pretty tight gun control laws here . 
  maybe op is a node developer, 
  how many people watch tv still ? 
  especially of the 90s children demographic ? 
  if people loved the nostalgia so much of watching kid 's cartoons , why would n't they just watch it online ? 
  or is this targeted towards children ? 
  i did n't realise we could get planetary orbits , i thought the max speed was too low ? 
  yes please . 
  rome2 is in a great state at the moment , i have n't played attila , but i would say rome2 is the best total war out . 
  they can be defined in the css using the background property . 
  also in the `` continue watching '' list it has heaps of movies that i finished watching , stopping at the credits . 
  very annoying . 
  is this vanilla ? 
  my mind is blown , how the hell do the placed blocks turn into blueprints ( i assume that 's what they are ) , how the hell does it know to remove complete rows ? 
  what do i think the stuff on the dash is ? 
  also if you have the golemn buff , it 's a good time to get the scuttle crabs , as they give you two stacks each . 
  `` not my fault '' ... 
  wut ... yes it is . 
  i feel like this should n't be possible , for balance reasons . 
  or if it is allowed , it should use waaaaaay more energy . 
  `` i hate all this labeling of games and genres '' ... `` ok guys this is definitely an fps , not a moba '' .
