  i do n't think it 's `` a god '' , rather it 's `` god '' . 
  it 's kind of like how we live in the observable universe , but we know that this is part of the greater universe . 
  pop culture or sub culture ? 
  and if this does n't eventuate , as i certainly do n't expect it to , what sense will you make of that ? 
  so many lives are a horror movie . 
  particularly for children - the world is a place full of giant monsters threatening their destruction at any moment . 
  but for plenty of adults too . 
  indeed . 
  and if such tests are not forthcoming , what sense would you make of that ? 
  the fb comments on that article are very satisfying . 
  need to get the word out there , i 'd love to get into this . 
  and thus the nation-state paradigm continues its decline . 
  i 'm reminded of how key and national got help from us political gurus to get their initial win and rise to government . 
  i ca n't see it as a coincidence that national 's policies are driving us to us style public services . 
  translation from the yt vid :, 
  be prepared take hold, 
  reach out we of palmerston north boys ' high school stand steadfast, 
  within our domain, 
  standing firm, 
  standing proud, 
  standing with respect, 
  to uphold, 
  to uplift, 
  to uplift, 
  to uphold, 
  the prestige of our school, 
  our aims are to seek knowledge, 
  and reach our goals and aspirations, 
  seek the horizon of aspirations, 
  and draw near to it, 
  those aspirations that are near , take them, 
  and it be known , yes , let it be known, 
  let your adrenalin abound high above, 
  it is done !!, 
  at the moment i think the * best case * scenario is ordinary nzers get screwed like the worst off are getting screwed right now . 
  worst case is we become a satellite state that has to base its laws and economy around the whims of a dominant power . 
  i bailed from my post-grad studies because student allowance for post-grad study was cut . 
  working nearly full time plus studying full time plus the placement requirements were a bit much for me . 
  i know , right ? 
  op must be some kind of anarchist . 
  lease expired , new rentals too expensive ? 
  well , the whole knowledge economy flopped , so what else can we do ? 
  well , that 's [ retarded ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eobokxecvaa ) . 
  pretty sure where i live i could call the local social services to report child neglect . 
  assuming i got over the shock . 
  ms tolley probably called a half dozen random families to confirm that their children were n't being abused instead . 
  i suspect these days if you want to be popular in music ( and media in general ) you have to cultivate an online following . 
  if only i could believe that . 
  the cop did n't lucky , the cop used their training . 
  if you do n't believe me , here is an exhaustive list of british police killed in the line of duty :, 
  it seems your approach results in more dead cops . 
  compare [ dead british cops ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_british_police_officers_killed_in_the_line_of_duty ) with [ dead us cops . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_american_police_officers_killed_in_the_line_of_duty ), 
  yeah , us cops are trained . 
  they are trained to kill . 
  you need to check [ the stats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_american_police_officers_killed_in_the_line_of_duty ) again , population does n't begin to account for the difference . 
  crazy gun ideology might - but cops are part of this ideology , which is the point . 
  so you think this incident is very rare ? 
  because if it 's not then how to you explain the rarity of uk cop deaths ? 
  us cops die * a lot * more than uk cops . 
  us cops have got something wrong . 
  that is what you need to do . 
  and everyone else 's guns . 
  but you love guns , so dead citizens , dead cops is what you get . 
  do you think that this is something that occurs only every couple of years or something ? 
  you think that uk cops only rarely have to face knife welding crazed people ? 
  or do explain the minimal number of uk police deaths with luck ? 
  perhaps they 're importing leprechauns from ireland ? 
  or brilliant and she knows who she 's pandering to . 
  we 've all got our blind spots and in the us `` freedom '' is often that blind spot . 
  any suggesting that someone made you less free and boom , popular support . 
  it depends . 
  what if we find they are at risk ? 
  it 's easier to do nothing when we know nothing . 
  i think that will be part of it . 
  i also think the us police force is an easy way for cowards and psychopaths to get some power they can hold over others . 
  and then there is the limited oversight . 
  of all the horror in [ this article ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/07/13/the-jaw-dropping-policeprosecutor-scandal-in-orange-county-calif/ ) about a recent police scandal this is the stand out quote :, 
   `` what 's newsworthy is not that it 's unique . 
  what 's newsworthy is that we actually found out . '', 
   various assorted monkey on keyboard output . 
  damn , do i feel called out . 
  you reckon the peelian principles at work , eh ? 
  no one wants to be policed . 
  but it 's hard not to accept policing when you see the stability and freedom it generates . 
  which in turn results in less policing . 
  the us seems to be in the reverse of this feedback loop , escalating police force rather than de-escalating it . 
  if all you have ever seen are draconian measures of power over vulnerability ... well , our economic models assume people are rational , and so they are . 
  i would n't submit to a force that only cared for its own existence either . 
  and what word is there on crackdowns on tax evasion ? 
  tell us more about the calibre of your fb friends ... 
   you live a much more exciting life than me :(, 
  haha , i 've seen your submissions , i get the feeling your life is as exactly exciting as you want it to be . 
  oh , so you learnt about imagination too !, 
  how wonderful . 
  there 's a third option : those who equate their imaginings with a complete data set . 
  lolz , projecting much ? 
  my understanding is that humans are incredibly diverse . 
  that any focus on or grouping of any particular behaviour is a reflection of one 's own biases and prejudices as much as anything . 
   touchingly , trade minister tim groser thinks this means he enjoys a special relationship with the us .
