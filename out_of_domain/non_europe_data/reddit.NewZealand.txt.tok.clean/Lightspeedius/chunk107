  you do n't see any return from healthcare when it enables people to return to work quickly , or it ensures children are n't too distressed and so they and we do n't have to deal with the long term effects of trauma ? 
  `` we need to look into the role of the office of the auditor-general , to ensure the money it receives is n't better spent elsewhere . '', 
  do n't break an arm jerking yourself off . 
  gosh , you 're so wise and enlightened . 
  i am humbled by your generous and considered advice . 
  unfortunately i 'm naive and simplistic , your opinions transcend my capacity to understand them . 
  but you 're so patient and kind !, 
  i 'm very lucky . 
  but dairy is [ nz 's most important industry ] ( http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10319051/nick-smith-denies-bullying-fish-and-game ) , so , too bad . 
  john key is the leader of the national party and their policies are hurting nz 's vulnerable for the sake of money and ideology . 
  personally , i find it too difficult working in my profession of choice : mental health , because there is so little funding and so much need in the community . 
  [ national cut funding for years ] ( http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/242981/sexual-violence-funding-boost-%27minimum%27 ) and only recently offered the bare minimum to keep the industry alive . 
  instead i have opted for more lucrative it work , because if i ca n't look after myself , i ca n't help anyone else . 
  as part of all this , [ national gutted the acc sensitive claims service ] ( http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/110951/acc-sex-abuse-claims-down-by-36-percent ) , with a drop of accepted claims plummeting and as a result those making claims dropped . 
  stuff like the [ police minister having to resign ] ( http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/9996560/maurice-williamson-resigns-over-police-call ) because they did n't realise they could n't use their position to influence police investigations . 
  stuff like how national bully 's those who speak out about the impact of national 's policies , like [ the problem gambling foundation ] ( http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/239456/anti-gambling-body-loses-funding ) or [ fish & game ] ( http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10319051/nick-smith-denies-bullying-fish-and-game ) . 
  and really , there 's just a general lack of anything positive coming out of the government . 
  from labour we got kiwi bank and kiwi saver , they also drove the knowledge economy hard which seems to have born some [ good ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/xero_%28software%29 ) [ fruit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rocket_lab ) . 
  oh , and also , national raising gst when [ they said they would n't ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4swwhx0j5bk ) . 
  while at the same time refusing to consider any real improvement on how we tax capital gains . 
  the overall theme for national seems to be more expenses for the little guy , more benefits for those already making bank . 
  ali g was the coolest when i was a kid . 
  i should watch it again , it 's probably no less cool . 
  check out waiheke island . 
  you can catch a ferry there from the auckland cbd . 
  is it possible to have a double ko in mma ? 
  i often wonder at the flash 's ability to focus . 
  it seems like he can read and digest information with hyper-zen ability . 
  i mean , i can manage 80 hours of study a week when really pushing myself , but really that 's made possible by the other 88 hours in the week where i rest and recuperate . 
  i suppose he could take a lot of breaks that ca n't be seen ? 
  can the flash sleep really fast too ? 
  in the military it takes a long time to replace something that works . 
  i 've had a hunt around and could n't spot it , you have a link ? 
  i did spot one sweet double ko in my search . 
  if the bsa did n't mind about the bachelor , i do n't see why they would care about this . 
   marketing exists for a reason . 
  because a number early psychologists switched to a career to develop the marketing industry ? 
  if you want to give to the homeless , vote green next election . 
  it 's not a coincidence that homelessness has increased so much in the last few years . 
  damn , too bad . 
  well , at least i got to enjoy it before the mods got around to their dirty business . 
  both . 
  i find distasteful any industry that relies on psyche hacks ( casinos are another example . ), 
  it does n't have to be . 
  well , it does , because that 's the path we 've taken . 
  but it 's a failure of imagination to think this was the only possible outcome in a functioning economy . 
  i 've never seen it from beginning to end , but i 'm pretty sure i 've seen most , if not all of the film . 
  sounds like a good book , i 'll have to get it . 
  you 're talking about climate change , right ? 
  where 's the actual engine on that thing ? 
  the story has been updated with more detail , it was pretty sparse originally . 
  people be grumpy . 
  this is something that stuck out :, 
   key wanted to see `` overt patriotism '' in new zealand in the same way countries like the united states turned up to sporting events with jerseys , scarfs and hats emblazoned with stars and stripes . 
  personally i feel patriotism engenders an `` us and them '' mentality , which can be exploited to great and terrible affect . 
  so i can understand why key might want this . 
  because of how harshly key 's government treats the vulnerable in our community and how disingenuous the rationalisations national provides as justification . 
  i do n't believe key wants us to be proud , he wants us to be distracted . 
  i find it cartoonish to be proud of overt symbols . 
  it 's hard to find pride in a country that benefits from such wealth yet leaves its vulnerable to face such hardship . 
  just because hungry children are n't in the news right now , it does n't mean those children are n't right now hungry and developing beliefs about nz and the world around this experience . 
  also , patriotism has a long demonstrated history of being dangerous . 
  of favouring knee-jerk reactions over insightful consideration . 
  there does n't need to be a plot . 
   for everyone either saying i 'm not answering the question or `` but that does n't explain why '' or some variation of that sentimen, 
  whenever the deeper `` why '' questions emerge in these situations i always think of feynman 's explanation of how magnets work :, 
  that 's not true . 
  national has a [ fantastic team of spin doctors ] ( http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/281741/pm-accused-of-breaking-election-promise ) . 
  patriotism is really popular with some people , i get it . 
  myself , i value people more than states . 
  you have no real rights or obligations in this situation . 
  they could try enforce the agreement via the [ disputes tribunal ] ( http://www.justice.govt.nz/tribunals/disputes-tribunal ) , but it does n't sound likely . 
  likewise , they do n't sound like someone who is going to care about your complaints about the deposit . 
  you likely are going to have to either put up with it for two weeks or cut your losses . 
  makes me wonder about the flip side : how does a company continue to function when an important and not easily replaceable staff member is compelled to go on a long stint of jury service ? 
  i assume those in critical roles can get exemptions , but what about those only in important roles ? 
  it 's not that he will , or it 's part of some grand scheme . 
  rather it 's a continued outworking of national 's values as it continues the push towards power for the powerful . 
  when i raise concerns about public health and community health services being gutted to the detriment of the quality of our society , no one seems to disagree - after all , it 's easy to demonstrate - but no one who takes umbrage with complaints about key acknowledges this either . 
  this is what i believe national has in mind for nz . 
  an economy and society that benefits those who are already successful while ignoring or muting the cries of those on the harsh end of the systems that support these things . 
  yeah , i 've watched that video way too many times . 
  / r/worldevents, 
  perhaps try something like https://news.google.com as well ? 
  i really like the era , i ca n't recall a ruling that did n't strike me as sensible . 
  `` your fate is unsealed ! '', 
  recruiting eh ? 
  that sounds expensive . 
  i would have guessed older based on his achievements . 
  that 's a good point . 
  my sense is many employers could do with any number of wake up calls - and when they come it 's often too late . 
  you like to blame people for their own circumstances do n't you ? 
  this seems likely as the article was n't about blame , but rather about pursuing what you value regardless of whether or not you achieve great heights . 
  there are countless stories of people who achieve success who then ultimately fail because they failed to account for the external factors to their success . 
  well , kim kardashian is really successful , since i 'm not an arbiter of quality i guess i have to accept that she is a person of high quality . 
  certainly christchurch should be offended that someone responsible at a high level for the rebuild chooses to blame rather than intelligently understand and address apparent problems . 
  `` i 'm only the ceo mate , what can i do !, 
  it 's these useless buggers that are the problem ! '', 
  people think a great many things . 
  optimal decision making involves accepting the role of chance in our lives , being prepared for rare circumstances , whether they be opportunities or disasters .
