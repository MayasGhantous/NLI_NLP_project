  couponing is such a weird phenomena to me . 
  are you looking for a place in auckland or [ wellington ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/wellington/comments/41a9jp/do_one_bedroom_apartments_still_exist_in_town/ ) ? 
  hahah , what are you doing here / u/editingandlayout , get back to / r/highqualitygifs where you belong !, 
  i 've done this before with jam jars . 
  apologies for my lack of camera skills :, 
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0otrlff5r9s, 
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl72oe6eqj4, 
  i placed the jars in some water for cooling , so they would n't break so quickly . 
   sadly waitangi day always seems to be a day of protest and division , when it should be a day celebration and unity . 
  i 'd rather it be a day of acknowledging nz 's history , the glorious and the grimy . 
  a day of acknowledging successes and challenges we have yet to face , struggles we have yet to overcome . 
  if you live in auckland , [ cads ] ( http://www.cads.org.nz/ ) offer a sophisticated , non-judgement service for those trying to get control over their alcohol and drug usage . 
  it 's a jam jar with a hole in the lid . 
  you :, 
  * heat the jar, 
  * put a small amount of meths in the jar, 
  * put the lid on, 
  * place thumb over hole and shake to vaporise the meths, 
  * light the vapour coming out of the hole, 
  it 's tricky getting the right hole size , and lighting the vapour at the right moment . 
  if you get it running and use too much meths , the jar will break . 
  yes , it 's a masterpiece in that it so perfectly captures a classic theme in a contemporary context . 
  this is where the expression `` have you cake and eat it too '' comes from . 
  i use methylated spirits , which i picked up from the supermarket . 
  i love the little kicks the dog gives to push itself down the slope , hahaha . 
   this thing has evolved over 100 's of millions of years, 
  so have we , and it 's just the same evolutionary process that makes us experience things as `` scary '' and to want to `` burn it with fire '' . 
   excuse themselves from what ? 
  from our treaty obligations . 
  given we live here by the virtue of that treaty . 
   but why does this never . 
  ever . 
  ever apply to any of the people who have kids they do n't have any money to pay for ? 
  because it 's a dystopia where only those with wealth get to have children, 
  is that [ david lange ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_lange ) in the picture ? 
  i 've discovered it 's [ frederick hart ] ( http://www.frederickhart.com/biography.asp ) , but it 's a striking similarity . 
   that 's a little ironic is n't it ? 
  no , it 's not . 
  what do you think is going on then ? 
  the world is changing and it will ever change . 
  no one knows what 2061 will really be like . 
  with how technology is advancing and disrupting the status quo , and with the uncertainty of how climate change will advance , we do n't really even know what 2030 will be like . 
  it will be interesting to see who the whole nation-state paradigm survives climate change and the massive migration that will result . 
  it 's certainly only an anecdote thus far . 
  if the information is accurate , it is quite compelling , given that these cases are from one corner of the council rather than the result of a complete canvassing of all 3000 employees . 
  personally i do n't think `` probably not '' is an acceptable level of certainty to the question of is there nepotism in a public organisation . 
  i tried , but because there is personal info it got deleted . 
  of course , without the personal info it 's a non-story . 
  we do n't know that at all . 
  technology is racing and we do n't know what breakthrough is around the corner . 
  also what is worse for some may be better for others . 
  for example the west 's standard of living may drop , but for everyone else it may rise . 
  and it 's not short on style , imo . 
  haha , i read that in / u/imperialdane 's voice . 
  you can use bleach . 
  bleach is mostly water . 
  we 're mostly water . 
  therefore : we are bleach . 
  i 'm reminded of [ buck shelford ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wayne_shelford ) 's impromptu scrotum `` surgery '' in the midst of a rugby game . 
  i imagine sage had to deal with plenty of headlocks like that growing up . 
  no wonder he 's such a top class fighter . 
  hunting down pesky tpp protesters i imagine . 
  last time i was in the us for an extended period i got homesick for good espresso and kebabs . 
  i was in upstate new york . 
  my options were subs or chicken parm . 
  it was good , but not really something i could enjoy regularly . 
  everything else was a poor imitation . 
  i did have a kebab in canada , it was okay . 
  i miss the diners . 
  any dive could serve eggs over easy perfect . 
  it 's hit and miss at even the best cafes in auckland . 
  some people probably do it for the lols rather than the cause . 
  we ca n't really expect that kind of consideration from a person who feels suicide is the best option available for them . 
  what 's messed up is how clearly disturbed this teen was and how this could go undetected ( by anyone who might know how to help ) until it was too late . 
  i agree that those closest to us are in the best position to support us . 
  but my friends ca n't help me fix a broken leg any more than they can help fix a broken heart . 
  they need the help of trained disciplined professionals in either case . 
  now if i have a broken leg , my mates know how to seek such help . 
  seeking help for less visible , less definable injury is much more difficult . 
  in some cases seeking such help has been demonstrated to only make things worse . 
  on the flip side , [ this female teacher ] ( http://www.newshub.co.nz/nznews/wellington-teacher-jailed-for-relationship-with-student-2015112710 ) was imprisoned despite it not being possible to charge a woman with rape in nz , and despite the perpetrator 's own history of being abused . 
  frankly i 'm not comfortable with the whiny `` woe is me , life is n't fair '' aspect of trp . 
  i like the aspect of trp that calls for men and women to grow up , take responsibility for what we can , forget what we ca n't , accept what we must . 
  excellent . 
  context ? 
  [ thank . 
  ] ( / r/ledootgeneration ), 
  so the fence was put back in its original state ? 
  and the original fence was a legal structure ? 
  i could n't get past the first line :, 
   `` the owner of a controversial wooden structure in wellington claims he was simply trying to replace a fence that was torn down 20 years ago . '', 
  * simply ? 
  * how is it simple when the fence has been gone for 20 years ? 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  wait , this is n't a tpp protest march ? 
  i remember when i was a kid , when the battery was running low on my walkman , i 'd turn that adjustable resistor to speed up playback before the battery died completely . 
   the second is that some breakthrough in solar panels makes the technology used in this plant obsolete , and it 's no longer competitive . 
  that would be a very good problem to have . 
  i agree , at the same time with the grim reality mental health workers have to accept , trying to gauge what 's acceptable and why can get very murky . 
  it 's quite horrific really .
