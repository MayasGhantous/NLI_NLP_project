  i mean , there ca n't be that many people in nz adequately qualified to work in the typically grim world of child welfare . 
  that chilling last gasp [ at the end as the boat retreats ] ( https://youtu.be/9xpb7f7basm?t=123 ) ... 
  new horizons is excellent . 
  their current programs are a great source of contemporary knowledge . 
  [meetup.com ] ( http://www.meetup.com/ ), 
  there are heaps of various interest groups in auckland . 
  you 'll make connections , no worries . 
  maybe ask a university that offers a food science degree ? 
  they 'll need to get their stuff from somewhere . 
  those who benefit most from our social and material infrastructure ( and thus have the most money to be taxed ) already are speaking on their own behalf . 
  the result ? 
  more and more wealth is being concentrated into their hands . 
  have you considered te reo ? 
  aut offer [ free classes ] ( http://www.aut.ac.nz/study-at-aut/study-areas/te-ara-poutama/qualifications/short-courses/te-reo-maori-beginners-and-intermediate ) . 
  it 's a good spot !, 
  not flash like most of the neighbourhood , but the rent is cheap for the area . 
  do kiwis care about anything ? 
  other than the bachelor i mean . 
  if recent work by auckland uni is anything to go by , they 're well positioned to renovate the building . 
  maybe , but hnz suffers from being a political football , auckland uni does n't . 
  and the land value might be high , but it comes the building that is a liability that must be maintained . 
  no doubt . 
  but maintenance is a funny thing , spending money on problems that do n't exist yet . 
  when resources are tight and there are problems that do exist , it 's easy for maintenance to fall to the wayside . 
  yeah , his christian world view was very contemporary and accessible . 
  still is i suppose . 
  i need it . 
  i hope it 's back up in some form soon . 
  yeah , that seems to be right :, 
  i do n't get the big deal with debt . 
  our debt-to-gdp ratio is something like 30 % . 
  the us record low for debt-to-gdp is around 30 % , with 70-100 % more common . 
  nz can afford a lot more debt . 
  can we afford to let our healthcare crumble ?

  i 'm looking for a flatmate in auckland , if anyone is looking for a room :, 
  it 's central , by the beach . 
  it 's a unit , not a flash house . 
  no dining area , just a lounge . 
  eclectic set of dishes . 
  flatmates use words like `` eclectic '' . 
  it 's true . 
  wow . 
  that 's terrible , amazing . 
  trademe lists it under auckland city . 
  i could have gone east central i suppose . 
  or you think central east ? 
  it 's nice if you like the beach . 
  these men are heroes . 
  i do n't think the economy could handle that many people quitting their jobs . 
  oh , i guess they just mean unhealthy food . 
  i think the seal was up for it . 
  recreational whale riding . 
  i 'm in love . 
  if she 's a precious bitch , you 're a racist cunt . 
  unless you can demonstrate otherwise by showing how each and every point that was raised was also equally invalid ? 
  rather than just picking out the one thing you take issue with to justify the status quo . 
  many people not suffering from institutionalised racism may suffer from a number of the problems raised in the article . 
  op explains that because they suffer from one of these problems the author is a `` precious little bitch '' . 
  op 's argument is invalid and inherently racist . 
  indeed . 
  the question is why , amongst so many more serious , more legitimate , more difficult to refute concerns , pick on the one that when viewed alone could be considered petty ? 
  i 've already made what i think the answer is clear . 
   the rest of the article could have been perfectly argued, 
  no it could n't have , at least not with arguments that could be independently backed up by academic sources . 
  brutal . 
  the western world also demonstrated their capacity for extreme violence during wwi and wwii . 
  `` criminals are a superstitious , cowardly lot . '', 
  ... `` it 's an omen . '', 
  i have major surgery and specialist health insurance . 
  i first got it via work ( which included gp visits ) , then i paid for it myself after i left as the insurer let me keep the group discount . 
  the public health system seems to be in a state of triage . 
  and i do n't have great social supports , so it 's a good way to make it easy to get the care i need if i get sick . 
  keep up the good work . 
  i [ know that feel ] ( http://imgur.com/oac31qh ) . 
  the print does n't breath , so it gets very hot when its warm . 
   every rick will consider himself to be the rickest rick . 
  even doofus rick ? 
  when will he focus his skills on politicians ? 
  if american psycho is anything to go by , you do n't need to be gay to be attracted to yourself . 
   some shoddy upper management, 
  that 's a generous way to put it . 
  it seems like dse was the victim of an [ elaborate heist ] ( https://foragerfunds.com/bristlemouth/dick-smith-is-the-greatest-private-equity-heist-of-all-time/ ) . 
  all jokes are at the expense of someone . 
  except for puns . 
  they 're at the expense of everyone . 
  so the rules are inadequate . 
  shitty situation , that 's for sure . 
  who do you think is smoking [ all this stuff ] ( http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11656081 ) ? 
  how long would it take for nz to go through that much meth ? 
  is the demand really that high ? 
  who 's smoking is all ? 
  it 's got to be people with decent paying jobs right ? 
  to be fair , for most of human history , most people were unable to read the bible . 
  it 's only recently that people could easily access the text .
