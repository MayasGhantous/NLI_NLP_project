  the priority seems to be your own ego ; i 've written a great deal to try to make my view-point understandable and cohesive , you 've simply questioned it and thrown in a few inane one-liners . 
  from my perspective you 're leaning heavily on hyperbole , rhetoric and strawman arguments to support your position . 
  i can demonstrate specific instances if you like . 
  you keep saying things i know to be false , either through expertise , or when you claim things about my own view and why you think i 'm posting . 
   put simply , i do n't have any reason to go research this for you . 
  my understanding is implied ( funding changes do n't happen without some report/evaluation , and if this is an attempt at appeal , it 's incredibly weak ) ; i 'm just advocating the critical thinking which i am also applying . 
  so your basis your experience as a service user and your personal critical analysis ? 
  that 's a completely fair perspective . 
  you might want to go to research if you 're interested in convincing me . 
  i 'm always interested in expanding my understanding and testing the veracity of my current knowledge . 
   if my experience/perspective does n't sway your opinion in any way , and yet this ( stupidly light ) article does , i 've no reason to think you 're actually interested . 
  the article does not sway my opinion . 
  it aligns with what i already know . 
  knowledge i am confident in because i have acquired it through both varied experience and formal study . 
  i can demonstrate my knowledge if challenged , which is why i am confident with what i say . 
  you are welcome to challenge my understanding . 
   regardless , this is pointless . 
  you 're making an awful lot of excuses instead of putting actual effort in . 
  i hope you appreciate the effort i have made . 
   if you 're really involved in the services ,, 
  i 'm not . 
  i know a variety of people in a number of different roles , from front line to senior management . 
  i have the training for it , but it 's grim , poorly paid work and i 'm no hero . 
   it just reinforces my belief that a shortage of funding is n't the issue - it 's getting the funding to the right areas ( / people ) . 
  can you tell me how you formed this belief ? 
  do you have any idea who should decide the right areas/people ? 
  any thoughts on what the criteria might be ? 
   please , share your perspective . 
  i 'll pass on your wall ` o'text . 
  it does n't start well , i ca n't imagine it improves . 
  on a clear , moonless night you could definitely make out the galaxy clearly . 
  this picture is probably good camera work as well . 
  excellent , thank you . 
  it seems we are making different arguments . 
  i think you 're arguing that the funding lifeline receives would be better used elsewhere . 
  it makes sense you believe that services that have helped you should be better funded . 
  i 'm arguing that these services should n't be competing for funding . 
  that we need to fund a broad range of services for a diverse community facing a variety of concerns living in a variety of contexts . 
  there are people completely different from you who also need help . 
  the reason this is political is because national has reduced funding across the board , without genuine rationale . 
  nz is not poor . 
  some of the services that failed only needed thousands of dollars , usually to afford the salary of at least one qualified individual to support volunteers , often students in their masters training . 
  i do n't know if you were familiar with mental health services 10 years ago . 
  i was , and i have seen a sharp decline in services in that time . 
  it 's not a case of some services have closed , while better services are thriving . 
  i am trained at a masters level in mental health practice from a nz university . 
  i choose not to work in mental health because the grim state of the industry is bad for my mental health . 
  i hope it will give you some self-awareness . 
  what kind of response do you expect this to evoke ? 
  do you think i will be relieved to be enlightened by your great wisdom ? 
  you do n't think maybe your implication that i lack self-awareness would be offensive ? 
  cool , thanks . 
   we 've been trending up in debt while cutting spending across the board , without any economic growth or the improvement prospects to justify it . 
  so the most vulnerable should bear this burden ? 
  this is my problem with national . 
  this is why it makes sense that the greens speak up about letting lifeline fail . 
   quite simply , we are n't in a position where we can just throw money at stuff . 
  *** cough *** flag referendum *** cough ***, 
   that 's what i 'd vote for . 
  yep , this is a political issue , hence why it makes sense for the greens speaking up . 
   dramatised misinformation ( the mental health system is n't going anywhere ) is n't . 
  that 's an opinion . 
  i think you 're wrong . 
  that 's politics . 
  just to be clear , you would be happy to miss out on the help you received for the changes you think are necessary ? 
   mental health system ceasing . 
  this is a strawman . 
  i did n't suggest the mental health system ceasing either . 
  you introduced this extreme . 
  there are literally people right now who can not access services they need . 
  you 've experienced this yourself - having access to a service is a world of difference from accessing the right service . 
  for some it will mean a miserable fucking life , which is something that you suggest the vulnerable should bear . 
  triage . 
  for others it will mean needing to access crisis services they would n't otherwise need . 
  the police have already reported the marked increase for the need to respond to mental health crises . 
  this is the real situation i witnessed many times working in mental health . 
  you can try and blow that off as poorly grounded , as an `` emotional preference '' . 
  that does n't demonstrate the strength of your opinion . 
   the way you suggest a ` miserable fucking life ' is this intolerable , awful thing, 
  the lives i witnessed were intolerable , awful things . 
  that 's not rhetoric . 
  i 'm not sure why you 're talking about solving mental health . 
  helping people in need is n't solving a problem . 
  it 's a part of life . 
  it 's part of a healthy community . 
  like a rage zombie . 
  that 's very foamy ... 
   language is ~ ~ just ~ ~ a tool that is used to communicate ideas and information, 
  indeed , and different languages lend themselves to being better at communicating different ideas than others . 
  nuances of languages shape ideas themselves . 
  so within languages exists elements of culture as culture shapes languages . 
  i can imagine that at least among those who wish to preserve their language there is more than a moral imperative involved . 
  exactly , it 's an easy argument to make . 
  it takes sophisticated techniques to demonstrate the world is round . 
  we do have measures , they 've been undermined by unjustified funding and policy pressures , so they 're not particularly effective . 
  which in turn becomes a justification to allow such services to fold . 
  leaving us with these kinds of issues . 
  how boring . 
  rigid adherence to definition is for programming languages . 
  nothing to do with the jump in mental health callouts police are having to respond to , i 'm sure .
