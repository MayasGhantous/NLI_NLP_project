  [ plutus ] ( https://plutus.it/ ) is going to be up and running soon . 
  it 's a cryptocurrency wallet service that provides tap-and-go payment services . 
  apparently will work for any nfc enabled service . 
  i think grief , fear and suffering plays a role . 
  we leave a lot of people to suffer in this world , and the decisions of the powerful in recent decades have thrust suffering onto many more . 
  i mean eugenics was gaining considerable popularity in the west . 
  i wonder how the whole eugenics movement would have played out if the nazi 's did n't take it to such an extreme and made the whole idea of eugenics toxic . 
  wrong ? 
  nothing wrong . 
  it 's just that people live in genuine nightmares in auckland . 
  well , nightmare is a little tame . 
  hell is more accurate . 
  that is people face deep , meaningless suffering , without any expectation of anything different . 
  if only nz was one of those rich countries . 
  fascinating . 
  who is getting arrested for smoking weed ? 
  more or less . 
  with [ mindfulness ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mindfulness ) practice you become effective at noticing how your attention has drifted so you can draw your attention back to where you wish it . 
  which is effectively the meditative practice : drawing your attention to something , such as a person speaking , and maintaining it there . 
  my guess is those charges were more significant than the consumption of cannabis . 
  i know from experience [ procare ] ( http://www.procare.co.nz/ ) offer a good psychiatric service . 
  they can help you identify both medical and non-medical interventions available . 
  fyi , it 's always racist when you point to someone 's ethnicity when ethnicity is n't relevant . 
  communication was relevant , work ethic was relevant , ethnicity was not . 
  the indians i know have impeccable english , you know , with the whole centuries of being an english colony business . 
  you of course can do what you like , including dealing with an inbox of offended people . 
  op never mentioned their socio-economic situation . 
  they did ask for a gp , but general knowledge of mental health practice in nz is minimal at best , so i figured i would suggest a good psychiatrist . 
  it 's a good option if you have ~ $ 300 to spend . 
  procare have a good understanding of the services available . 
  the person i know got referred to a public mental health service which costs nothing , thanks to the psychiatrist recognising their needs . 
  it sounds like some nz journalists might dodge a crime infested , zika virus laced bullet . 
  why not be accurate and say who they actually are relevant to the situation ? 
  replacing `` indian lady/lady/guy '' with `` employee '' seems to work much better . 
  if you 're choosing to point out someone 's race when race bears no relevance , you 're being racist . 
  you can be racist if you want . 
  racism is terrible for us , but we all do things that are bad for us , right ? 
  to quote myself :, 
   please be fringe , please be fringe , please be fringe ... 
  yes !, 
  op is complaining about a person 's behaviour . 
  bringing up race without qualifying why it 's relevant implies that race is related to this behaviour . 
  op admitted as much , saying that he thought it would imply poor english . 
  indians reading op 's post get a reminder that people see them as less able than others . 
  which sucks for them . 
  that 's racism . 
  it 's not about political correctness , it 's about not making others put up with our shit . 
  consider [ this image ] ( https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1a38ygprdau5dnisw68ebxyzvhg=/800x0/filters:no_upscale\\ ( \\ ) / cdn0.vox-cdn . com/uploads/chorus _ asset/file/6798021 / boss3dwedge .0 . png ) of observed galaxies . 
  on the right hand image you can see how the plane closest to our observation is much smaller than the plane most distant . 
  conceivably that observation could extend right until we get to the big bang . 
  which is where the issue is . 
  the big bang began from a point , the very early universe being a very small place . 
  how does that very small space get stretched across a very large plane ? 
  i understand about red shift and objects distant from me . 
  but what about objects close to each other that are exceedingly distant from me ? 
  yeah , in [ this image ] ( https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1a38ygprdau5dnisw68ebxyzvhg=/800x0/filters:no_upscale\\ ( \\ ) / cdn0.vox-cdn . com/uploads/chorus _ asset/file/6798021 / boss3dwedge .0 . png ) the closest plane is smaller than the most distant plane . 
  as we get closer to the big bang , i would expect matter to be more densely contained in less space . 
  so the edge would be much more dense than the centre . 
  if we could see through the opaque universe to the big bang , i would expect that as we saw back far enough that we would see a point stretched out across the entire sky , which is counter-intuitive . 
  surely that 's the grift . 
  but even the very early translucent universe would be much smaller than the space it occupies in the sky . 
   it was so small that the laws of modern physics do n't work to try to explain wtf was going on in there . 
  this might be the real answer here . 
  would n't that be awesome ? 
  kiwi general gives you a squad with [ this guy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/4tgdpj/a_soldier_from_new_zealand_takes_aim_with_twin/ ) and his twin brens with anti-air pans . 
  now i want to see a kiwi squad in [ coh ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/companyofheroes ) . 
  imperial dane is the best . 
  you 're the best [ bro ] ( / u/imperialdane ) !, 
  looking far away , we see what * was * . 
  of course , we ca n't see the point of the big band , as the universe was opaque . 
  we can see from when the universe was translucent . 
  but this would have expanded from a point . 
  but it was . 
  and we can see what was . 
  so what do we see ? 
  how does it digest a snake ? 
  that must be one bony , scaly shit in the morning . 
  my upgrade plan from win 7 is linux for desktop , steam os for gaming . 
  i ca n't imagine how awful it would be to get hit in those cramped conditions . 
  i wonder how things are for northlanders these days ... 
  iirc it was a $ 15 minumum purchase , which was a lot more money in the late 90s ( minimum wage was ~ $ 9 . ), 
  some nights i would eat a lot of kfc . 
  / r/mildyinfuriating, 
  well , that 's mildly infuriating . 
  i remember radio . 
  used to listen to it as a kid with ole constable keith and his dog sniff . 
  you mean the dominant group , the group most able to be racist due to its dominant position and least likely to be impacted by it ? 
  it depends on the button and what else you can see the screen where you press the button . 
  poor user controls can be as responsible as a poor user . 
   i 'm not sure we fully understand the mechanics of a super volcano eruption yet , since there has n't been any in the short time we 've been actively monitoring earthquakes/volcanoes . 
  it 's one of those things i hope we never get to find out about . 
  at least not terrestrial super volcanoes . 
  not everyone is trying to solve racism . 
  the best some can do is offer their own experience of it . 
  if solving racism interests you , i do n't think picking on the flaws of those most impacted by it will help . 
  but i do n't think there is racism . 
  it 's not racism . 
  pakeha are the dominant group . 
  we literally colonised the country and imposed ourselves over others who are different to us . 
  our values , our virtues and where we lack virtue dominate our cultural landscape .
