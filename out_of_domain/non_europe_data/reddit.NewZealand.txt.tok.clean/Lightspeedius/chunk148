  nothing is travelling through space , space itself is moving . 
  i would suggest that many voters are caught in the pressures of their daily lives , limiting the effort we can put into understanding political issues . 
  pressures some leaders have little interest in alleviating if it means they can rely on easily manipulated votes , if power is their primary goal and not the interests of voters . 
  all politicians are caught in this dynamic , but i do n't believe all would exacerbate it for their own ends . 
  if only because they appreciate the gains are short lived . 
  eventually if the pressure is kept up too long , you end up with a situation like in the us right now . 
  [ ` ongoing risk ' of sex abuse at gloriavale - govt report ] ( http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/327640/%27ongoing-risk%27-of-sex-abuse-at-gloriavale-govt-report ), 
  oh , is there a problem with people being sexually abused ? 
  is that something we 're unhappy with ? 
  if so , that 's really strange . 
  because as a nation we 've let the kinds of services that help people recover from this abuse and hold perpetrators accountable fail . 
  we 're not making an effort to ensure victims have somewhere safe to turn . 
  are we sure we really care about this ? 
  or is it just when we can identify some `` other '' as the perpetrator , rather than members of our own communities , that we get concerned ? 
  sex abuse is rife in nz . 
  we do n't do shit about it . 
  unless we get to point the finger of blame . 
  another problem with compulsory service is you get a militarised population . 
  thoughts , values , language all exist within a military filter . 
  the filter itself may not be problematic , the lack of alternative filters however can result in a large social and cultural blind spot . 
  i hope you affect the change you desire , good luck . 
  mental health services have gone by the wayside in nz , with sexual abuse services being the first to go . 
  where the government leads , others follow .

  these are some of the most obvious examples , but the situation is much more nuanced than easy to report stats . 
  freud was wrong like newton was wrong . 
  it really depends on what you 're studying and the dominant forms of mental health practice in your local community . 
  freud was a * starting point * for many of the concepts i learnt studying post-grad mental health practice . 
  the thing is there is no right answer to get . 
  freud indeed was caught in the `` man in the white coat who knows best '' paradigm , but his work helped us move beyond this . 
  if you learn mental health practice without learning freud , you may still be caught in that old paradigm . 
  freud invented the talking cure . 
  sure , we see far beyond his theories now , but listening to patients was a major contribution . 
  so much of what freud started is so normal now , we do n't realise things were different . 
  that 's not true at all . 
  psychoanalytic theory is still an important and helpful part of mental health practice . 
  maybe where you learnt freud . 
  and the unconscious mind has been well demonstrated and accepted across numerous discplines . 
  yes and no . 
  now days we look at the different levels of brain function based on evolutionary hierarchy , but it 's still a useful introduction to the internal world and the complex nature of self . 
  you ca n't just brush off freud 's introduction of the idea of the unconscious mind . 
  it was revolutionary and it continues to change the world . 
  that when we think freud we focus on psychosexual stages is frankly testament to how close to the truth he was . 
  much more sensible than the guys doing something similar with the gas canisters . 
  that 's incorrect . 
  serious academic works written this decade still reference freud . 
  what 's your academic background ? 
  i 'm sure this is an isolated incident . 
  most meth users are much more responsible . 
  unfortunately we 're going in the opposite direction of all of this . 
  apparently all we need is better communication between departments . 
  they absolutely do . 
  they also reference transference , repression and neurosis . 
  and any number of concepts still in daily use in treatment today . 
  you clearly have no sound basis for what you know . 
  there are myths abound about freud and you 're perpetuating them . 
  freud wrote plenty on the subject of myth . 
  were you taught how it was concluded freud 's theories were wrong ? 
  were you also taught about sullivan , klien , winnicot , erikson , bowlby ? 
  if freud 's wrong , then they 're all wrong too as their work built on his . 
  as are contemporary theorists like mcwilliams , maroda , acktar , holmes , bateman , etc. 
  the field of psychology is very broad , with plenty that 's cross-discipline and plenty that is niche . 
  there is plenty of knowledge that does n't depend on psychoanalytic theory , but it 's still a contemporary field of science and practice . 
  saying freud was wrong is patently absurd . 
  i definitely am not saying that . 
  no science is `` right '' . 
  any model or theory we have is only a best understanding in our current circumstances . 
  it 's a false analogy . 
  i know that 's so because we still use freudian concepts . 
  we do n't use alchemy . 
  my training is at the masters level , psychosocial studies and psychotherapy practice . 
  correct and incorrect understandings of the humans psyche are more suited to freud 's time . 
  in contemporary times it 's understood that how we understand ourselves says much about ourselves , the sociocultural-political paradigms we live in as it does about what it is to have a human experience . 
  the most robust research i 'm aware of demonstrates that what 's most effective is n't one model of the human mind , or one method of practice , but the rapport between client and therapist , and the therapist being trained in a relevant academic discipline - * any * discipline . 
  in my training , we started with freud . 
  it involved heavy critique , but it was still fundamental to the training . 
  no doubt there are competing theories where freud is absent , but freud has in no way been done away with . 
  there are plenty of government funded institutions around the world that practice psychoanalytic psychotherapy . 
  pretty much as soon as national got into office they started dicking around with mental health services , ignoring expert advice , to obvious effect . 
  here 's an obvious example :, 
  [ fears for sex abuse victims under new guidelines ] ( http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/16018/fears-for-sex-abuse-victims-under-new-acc-guidelines ) ( 2009 ), 
  [ acc sex-abuse claims down by 36 % ] ( http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/110951/acc-sex-abuse-claims-down-by-36-percent ) ( 2012 ), 
  [ acc overhauls sexual abuse care service ] ( http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/267591/acc-overhauls-sexual-abuse-care-service ) ( 2015 ), 
  but there have been plenty of reports of ngos and other community services failing or having to operate on a triage basis because according to national they 're `` hobby horses '' , experts simply being overly `` passionate '' , rather than having an understanding of human behaviour based in academic training . 
  also , i 'd be interested in what rationale national had for ceasing the government 's social policy journal :, 
  that 's not alchemy , that 's baking . 
  alchemy is turning lead to gold , or making magical cure-alls . 
  * listening * to patients was a profound innovation of freud 's . 
  the unconscious mind was a profound innovation of freud 's . 
  psychological defences in general , and specific defences such as repression and suppression of thoughts and affect . 
  or projection , which is a revelation to anyone when they first grasp it . 
  transference and counter-transference are considered essential to understand in contemporary clinical practice . 
  this list is not exhaustive . 
  me too . 
  i do n't agree that freud was largely disproven , no . 
  newton was right , up to a point .
