  do you think the system clock slows down over time ? 
  or perhaps operating systems have eventually start to use the hardware less effectively until they 're started fresh ? 
  that 's a lot of flags . 
  no two people are the same and modern medicine tries to recognise this . 
  the [ dsm v ] ( https://www.theravive.com/therapedia/antisocial-personality-disorder-dsm--5-301.7-\\ ( f60 .2 \\ ) ) is useful in providing a clear way of using these terms while accepting the limited and contentious nature of them . 
  but it will always be limited by being forced to provide clear definitions for insurance and forensic purposes . 
  i think psychodynamic literature is more effective at capturing the nuances of behaviour and character : psychopathy is a spectrum of behavioural functioning , some of us high on it , some of us low . 
  but all of us with some psychopathic capacity . 
  in psychodynamics a traditional psychopath would likely be someone with high capacity for both psychopathy and narcissism . 
  i 'm not a psychopath , but i can choose to relate solely through power if the need arises . 
   note : sociopaths and psychopaths are not the same thing . 
  for the purposes of this post , they are close enough to be treated as one . 
  the [ dsm v ] ( https://www.theravive.com/therapedia/antisocial-personality-disorder-dsm--5-301.7 - ( f60 .2 \\ ) ) states the difference being an environment or genetic source . 
  and that the basis for determining whether it 's one or the other is contentious and not widely agreed upon . 
  great post . 
  a home computer is an uncontrolled environment . 
  anything could be going on . 
  if you turn on a working computer with a clean os for the first time , then leave it running six months before logging in , it should run just as fast as if you just turned it on . 
  uptime only relates in the sense that the longer you 're using the machine , the more opportunity you have for something to go wrong . 
  like maybe when that browser window crashed , it did n't completely crash , so it 's still in the background hogging memory and cpu . 
  surely you know the first step to troubleshooting a home computer ? 
  `` have you rebooted ? '', 
  i think some of the spending figures are disingenuous . 
  looking at [ official data ] ( https://education.govt.nz/ministry-of-education/budgets/budget-2016/highlights-budget-2016/ ) on education spending for instance we see the bulk of the increase in spending appears to be property related . 
  if there are all these new schools , where 's the funding for teachers and staff to run them ? 
  why do we see headlines like this : [ budget 2017 : schools , early childhood centres on tenterhooks over their funding future ] ( http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:wx3wffox0zkj:news.co.nz/news/getnews.asp%3farticle%3d3901809+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=nz&amp;client=firefox-b ), 
  ( via google cache , nzh chose to remove the story for some reason ... ), 
  these kinds of stories by the nzh look like information , but in the absence of context and critical analysis i think it 's misinformation . 
  and be lucky . 
  like do n't find yourself in an out of area hospital where your insurance is n't valid , leaving you in debt many times more than the average annual wage . 
  we dodged labour 's nanny state only to by subjected to national 's demented granny state . 
  you would be naive to think otherwise . 
  quid pro quo is how the us government runs , from any reasonable perspective . 
   athlon t-bird, 
  i loved that cpu ... until a friend cracked the core putting on a new hsf . 
  because the government is elected by people who have been subjected to a lifetime of nixon 's propaganda . 
  give it a generation or two more . 
  i had a 700mhz oc 'd to 1ghz , which was only possible by using pencil across some cut bridges to enable increasing the cpu multiplier . 
  for the time it was amazing . 
  alas [ the die on the cpu ] ( http://mixeurpc.free.fr/site_x86-guide/photos/grandes/25/amd%20athlon%20800%20a0800amt3b%20adfa%2001.jpg ) was exposed , with the hsf applied directly to it . 
  if you applied too much pressure to a corner seating the hsf , the die would crack . 
  it was a sad day . 
  i do n't think those cultures tend to survive . 
  russia might be the exception . 
  it 's missing west new zealand too . 
  well at least we know if they get re-elected they have no new ways to screw over the country in mind . 
   besides , even if they did announce any policies , labour would shit all over them . 
  national 's policies are turning nz to shit . 
  anyone would have a go at whatever they come up with next . 
  my hope is personal/domestic ai will help us cut through this . 
  i also hope it ca n't drag your foot under the bottom . 
  a fail safe ca n't be too hard to implement . 
  who ultimately receives the money from such an invoice ? 
  showering and abstaining !, 
  well done . 
  is it bad cgi or just old cgi ? 
  welcome to / r/auckland . 
  the money the insurers pay to hospitals . 
  it 's far in excess of what medical treatments cost in most of the world for equivalent care . 
  who gets the money ? 
  are doctors paid a lot more ? 
  or are hospitals expected to be hugely profitable ? 
  does it just go to suppliers of medical equipment ? 
  a combination of all of these ? 
  something else entirely ? 
   also doctors provide far more treatments in the us compared to other countries which further drives up cost, 
  there might be better services available to those that can access them , but for * equivalent * care , the cost in the us is much much higher than the rest of the western world . 
  is it your belief the average healthcare consumer subsidises these advanced services ? 
  so someone paying hundreds of dollars for care that costs tens of dollars elsewhere is actually paying for some fancy machine and expert training that someone else is using ? 
  if we do n't know what to do , it 's because we 've stopped thinking about what we can do . 
  for example , the government cut its social policy journal , which i will point out was initiated by a national government :, 
  [ social policy journal of new zealand te puna whakaaro ] ( https://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/journals-and-magazines/social-policy-journal/ ), 
   the social policy journal of new zealand was published between 1993 and 2011 by the centre for social research and evaluation at the ministry of social development . 
  it was a forum for public debate on social policy . 
  the truth is we have a lot of knowledge and expertise about the causes and prevention of suicide . 
  anyone with such expertise saw this epidemic coming . 
  but national writes such expertise off as `` passionate '' and prevention services as `` hobby horses '' . 
  we have n't seen the worst yet . 
  even if national did a complete about face today , it will be at least a decade before this peaks . 
  there are a lot of kids right now who will become adults having no idea how to live a meaningful life . 
  okay , but that does n't answer my question . 
  why are * equivalent * services so much more expensive in the us ? 
  if i need a catheter , or dialysis , it will cost a lot more in the us than in australia or the uk or fiji . 
  why ? 
  where does that money go ? 
  i do n't know what more i can do to stress the word `` equivalent '' . 
  as in the same service with the same result . 
  so it 's the hospitals that pockets the cash ? 
  this is so out of character for national . 
  i 'm talking about the current situation , the consequences of current policies . 
  the rate should n't be constant . 
  if we had kept up the practices we had in place before national took office , we would be seeing a continuing decline . 
   the stats i linked do n't show any decline since ~ 2000 though, 
  which is concerning . 
  it seems we have a situation where we are getting two different stories . 
  for instance we have the police stats showing a jump in mental health call outs , which along with other stats matches a general perception of problems in the mental health sector . 
  on the other hand we have government stats showing in this case that nothing is changing . 
  what 's going on ? 
  are we to believe that mental health , poverty , homelessness and suicide are not linked ? 
  or that the widely reported stats showing an increase in these things are not accurate ?
