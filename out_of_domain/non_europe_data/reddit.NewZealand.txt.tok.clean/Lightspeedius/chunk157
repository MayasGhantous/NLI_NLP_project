  it 's power unexamined . 
  people with power very much like their power to be unchecked , and we all have power , we all wield it against vulnerability . 
  we all want what we want , feminism is about thinking what do we * really * want , rather than acting as we always have . 
  it 's about discipline . 
  it 's about growing up . 
  i do n't believe humanism captures this . 
  i could be wrong as i 'm much more familiar with academic discipline that informs feminism , but very little about humanism . 
  i do n't see that these terms need to be mutually exclusive . 
  we could cook up new terms each time the general public grasps and then subverts the basic principals . 
  but that 's a never ending treadmill that brings problems of its own . 
  will it be a smart detective film ? 
  or will clues conveniently reveal themselves as the plot requires ? 
  that 's not how it works , no . 
  what i was referring to was how these changes in our values emerged from considering how power was used and how it impacted the vulnerable : feminism . 
  when you 're angry at someone and you know a racist remark would hurt them and leave them dis-empowered but choose not to say it because you understand the unwanted consequences of racism , you 're using feminist insight . 
   well i 'd say there are n't really that many stats that are reported in the area at this stage . 
  most of the stories that are around involve anecdotal evidence rather than actual stats . 
  we 've been studying human behaviour as a serious scientific discipline for over a hundred years , there 's an abundance of science that demonstrates connections between these things , as complex as these connections are . 
  it 's important to be aware that pure stats do n't tell the whole picture . 
  meta-analysis is the gold standard , which first requires a volume of research to analyse , which there is little funding for in our particular circumstances . 
   also , the stats i showed were per capita stats - this means that overall numbers are increasing and so the absolute numbers of suicides are increasing . 
  that 's a good point , it would explain at least in part the increased pressure on services , if they 're trying to help more with static resources . 
   i 'd say that it has always been poor and we are becoming more aware of it now . 
  i disagree , it 's been better and getting worse . 
  mental health is n't an issue people are aware of when people in need are getting appropriate help . 
  a decade ago we were making earnest strides into offering quality , effective mental health services based on an academic understanding of human behaviour and functioning . 
  and then we threw it away for an idealogical approach . 
  i can demonstrate a clear and direct example of this if you are interested . 
  however there is much more that ca n't be easily demonstrated by a few links to statistics . 
  i thought both parties had to `` like '' each other or whatever it is on tinder for their to be a match ? 
  maybe he was drunk . 
  that 's a good point . 
  the onus is on their employers . 
  if these small venues are n't able to hire appropriate staff then they should n't be able to run these machines . 
  you 've got the think of the noble job creating businesses that run these machines . 
  thankfully we have [ national to stand up to ] ( http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11768587 ) job hating organisations like the problem gambling association . 
  a guy i knew from school went out on the street with a sword to complain about the noise his neighbours were making . 
  they grabbed it off him and killed him with it . 
  and cat . 
  huh , i was [ just talking about ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/6k7694/woman_jailed_for_eight_months_after_tinder/djl4ooz/ ) what i understand feminism to be yesterday . 
  it 's a controversial topic no doubt , but despite the toxic nonsense that accumulates in social media , there are reasoned , disciplined perspectives . 
  i 'm curious about your academic background . 
  my background is psychodynamics , so my perspective is skewed in that direction . 
  at its core i see feminism as the disciplined examination of power dynamics , rather than the liberation from oppression . 
  for instance neither complete freedom or complete control is desirable or possible . 
  feminism asks the question : where does the balance lie ? 
  but i 've read plenty that suggests feminism is both much more and much less than that . 
  and of course there 's the lay perspective which typically states feminism is about women 's rights . 
  human reality is subjective . 
  do you imagine yourself god ? 
  what 's your basis for this assertion ? 
  are you referring to a particular branch of philosophy or epistemological frame ? 
  hahaha , you are obviously very familiar with your field . 
  are you currently a lecturer ? 
  you wrote that very quickly , for something so clear and concise . 
  i agree feminism is a methodology , i 'm not sure its core focus is equality . 
  for instance feminism does not try to place children as equal with adults . 
  but your understanding appears much more in-depth and nuanced than mine . 
   it is at least partly about liberating people from unnecessary and disadvantageous power disparities , which i would call a type of equality . 
  that 's fair . 
   but , as you say , there are many feminisms . 
  i 'm probably being blunt by saying `` feminism is not this , but that '' , it might be more accurate to say `` feminism is not only this , but also that '' . 
  a fruitful discussion . 
  you might be interested in this [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/6kjngp/a_response_to_the_newspaper_editor_who_thinks/djmqfhk/ ) by / u/thezizekiest who offers a more robust perspective than mine . 
  thanks , that 's helpful . 
  i did n't realise there was a single , coherent ideology . 
  what is it ? 
  it 's hard to believe the change in funding was n't due to the pgf 's opposition to the sky city expansion . 
  the ministry only offered weak justifications for handing over the contract . 
  in the article i linked it 's clear that it does n't matter whether the pgf 's service was better or not as the ministry is able to use its own discretion , it does n't have to rely on research . 
   it was a complex process which involved national and regional providers but the ministry was under no obligation to use a statistically sound process in arriving at its decision , the judges said . 
  at the time i recall the sallies stating they put in their standard tender for the contract . 
   but , on a more serious note , any ideology that has at its core the idea of oppressed vs oppressor , usually manifest as some concept of ` the patriarchy ' . 
  this is n't a coherent sentence . 
  you 're just making shit up , right ? 
  i think it 's more defined by the context . 
  for instance experience tells me that feminism is quite different on the internet than what can be found in print . 
  i think we 'd all like to know that . 
  expert evidence suggested that the sallies could n't match the pgf , but the appeals court has said that the government does n't need to consider this evidence in making its decision . 
  that 's a very generous perspective , particularly in the context of national 's behaviour overall . 
  i do see what you 're saying . 
  that maybe the pgf in speaking up should have been asking for more funding to assist the increased problems they anticipated rather than opposing the casino expansion . 
   the history of it, 
  i only know a history of feminism , specifically its role in mental health practice . 
  i 've never studied feminism as a primary focus . 
  / u/thezizekiest was kind enough to offer an in-depth perspective of their own in this [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/6kjngp/a_response_to_the_newspaper_editor_who_thinks/djmqfhk/ ) . 
  what you 're saying about feminism matches what i 've read on the internet but what i 've read in print tells a very different story . 
  how have you learnt about feminism ? 
   if you knew anything about the history of it , you 'd know better, 
  what history of feminism were you speaking of that you do n't think i 'm aware of ? 
  it seems like you 're conflating your history of feminism with the history of feminism . 
  i think you 're confusing people with feminism . 
  as you point out people will subvert any idea if they can get it to serve their agenda . 
  i admit my authority on the subject is limited . 
  check out this [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/6kjngp/a_response_to_the_newspaper_editor_who_thinks/djmrmau/ ) that talks about feminism as a methodology . 
  sorry , if you 're going to call me out for not knowing the history of feminism , i would at least expect you to have a sound basis for this claim . 
  your perspective is no less skewed than mine . 
  you ca n't be in feminism if feminism is a methodology . 
  a sound basis is not a single source . 
  nor is it a bunch of sources that fit your perspective .
