adding to this ,, 
   `` barbarian '' culture started to meld with `` roman '' culture, 
  as different cultures within what had been the empire 's borders were able to flourish and grow again , the skills and knowledge required to continue making use of the old roman systems would n't necessarily be needed by those localities . 
  politics for example , could shift from a senate , to a chief , later to a king . 
  adding to this is the fact that many places were absorbed into other cultural spheres , e.g. 
  north africa by the early caliphates , which brought their own cultural influences . 
  the caliphates ruled with the pact of umar , which restricted repairs and construction of religious buildings - a key area of architectural expression . 
  the logical follow up to this is , `` what about in rome then ? '', 
  and the answer is that rome was greatly reduced in size and wealth without the empire . 
  i 'm not sure of the exact numbers ( why i 've posted this as a follow up comment ) , but i do know the population had dropped to that of a medium or large town a few centuries after the fall , from great city population it had held previously . 
  hope that helps , and that this comment 's in line with the rules of the sub . 
  i 'm from new zealand , so i do n't know if this one is feasible for you to try . 
  we make sandwiches with marmite ( similar to aussie 's vegemite , but better ) , and then fill the sandwich with potato chips . 
  personally i prefer sour cream and chives , or chicken , but it works with any flavour , the crunch and the contrasting flavours makes for the best sandwich ever . 
  the spanish flu pandemic killed approximately 3-5 % of the total world population according to wikipedia . 
  what was different and especially scary about the spanish flu was that unlike other strains of flu , it was to young , healthy people - teenagers through to young middle age - as well as to other ages . 
  that age group ( the young ) , and that condition ( physically strong ) would have been less susceptible to other forms of influenza which generally were more fatal among the very young and the very old ( much as is the case today ) . 
  because of these factors - 3-5 % population dying , and affecting all age groups - the logical conclusion is that yes , famous people died in the pandemic . 
  the next question is `` who qualified as a famous person in 1918 ? '', 
  because fame is a slightly anachronistic concept . 
  however , wikipedia does have a [ list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_1918_flu_pandemic_cases ) of notable flu cases , both survivors and deaths . 
  just glancing through the list of survivors shows that fdr , woodrow wilson and david lloyd george all survived , as well as the queen of denmark and the king of spain . 
  the presence of so many heads of state ( even haile salassie in ethiopia ) , suggests that standards of medical care played an enormous role in curbing the effects of the flu . 
  as per today , higher status in society would have a link to access to said medical care . 
  this is new to me , but i gather it 's quite old . 
  not everyone may be familiar with it though . 
  apparently , lbj had a habit of recording all of his phone calls while president . 
  they were then collected and sorted by date on this [ website .

  an example on [ youtube . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3gt9un7ndo ), 
  oddly enough , this question has nothing to do with italy . 
  the only significant event i could think of in europe in 1789 was the fall of the * ancien r\u00e9gime * in france - also known as the french revolution , and a bit of investigation showed that it was connected to this . 
  lorenzo da ponte ( the venetian opera writer i hope , or else this is all off course ) , was not living in italy in 1789 , but in austria , where his patron was joseph ii , the holy roman emperor and older brother to marie antoinette , queen of france . 
  da ponte 's position in society then was quite a high status one ( at least , it is if you go for an arbitrary upper/middlish/lower split ) , and the fall of the old order in france , the imprisonment of marie antoinette and her husband , and the general tension that this spread around europe would have been felt keenly by da ponte . 
  as a member of austrian society , he would have been directly threatened by the possibility of revolution fermenting outside of france . 
  in the 1790s , multiple armies gathered on the french border foreseeing just that , so we know it was a widely felt fear . 
  the earthly paradise most likely refers to the status quo pre-revolution , and the fall to the end of that with the uprising of the french populace . 
  purely speculation , but it 's probably all tied into the garden of eden seeing as he was italian , his patron was the holy roman emperor , and france was catholic . 
  revolution was the fall from eden all over again for the aristocracy . 
  just to add to this , the concept of oral histories being less valuable than written histories is one that is quite discriminatory in its origin . 
  i ca n't find the thread now , but it was discussing native american peoples , and one of the answers pointed out that calling native americans `` stone age '' is offensive , and also incorrect , because `` stone age '' is a european measure of achievement . 
  in the same way , cultures that record their histories in an oral tradition are often viewed as lesser and inferior by those that have a written language , when in actuality , a written language is only one facet of a culture . 
  a good example of this is the above comment , where the pacific nations had an oral tradition , which prejudiced european colonisers towards them . 
  however , pacific cultures such as the m\u0101ori and the rapa nui among others had far surpassed european skills in certain areas , notably seafaring and navigation . 
  so because of the way in which cultures with a written language marked out others as inferior , the integrity and veracity of oral tradition has been challenged unfairly as a marker of a less developed group of people . 
  edit : [ here 's an article ] ( http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/document/?wid=1010 ) by judith binney , a new zealand pakeha historian talking about the use of written histories ( european ) and oral histories ( m\u0101ori ) in the writing of new zealand history . 
  the immediate answer to your question is that it was because europe was a christian continent , and rome was the seat of the papacy . 
  the popes were the heirs to the throne of st. peter , the first pope and the disciple that jesus entrusted his church to . 
  this bestowed the popes with significant powers and influence in christendom , of which most of europe was a part . 
  now that we know why rome was important , we can turn to why the monarchs were so interested in rome , and there are several reasons . 
  the first is that the pope was the representative of god on earth , and the supreme figure in christianity . 
  this is the most important factor , and the one i 'll focus on . 
  the second is because the pope had access to all the papal wealth and resources , giving him non-spiritual influence too . 
  the third reason was that the pope was able to use all of this influence to become a significant player in european politics . 
  as representative of god , the pope was able to take multiple actions which could hugely benefit the recipient of his attention . 
  he could issue papal bulls , which could take precedence over the laws of states . 
  one such papal bull , named the * inter caetera * , was issued in 1493 by pope alexander vi , who had previously been known as rodrigo lanzol y de borja , commonly translated as rodrigo borgia . 
  you may have heard of him . 
  the * inter caetera * granted all the lands discovered beyond a certain point in the atlantic to the spanish crowns of castille and aragon . 
  those crowns were held by queen isabella of castille and king ferdinand ii of aragon . 
  they funded an expedition into the west by a genoese man known as christopher columbus . 
  so now , knowing what columbus discovered , and what the pope had just granted isabella and ferdinand , we can immediately see the value of the pope as an ally . 
  especially , when the lands were granted , `` by the authority of almighty god [ ... ] to you , your heirs and successors '' , which put the spanish crown in a position to become the most powerful kingdom in europe for the next few centuries . 
  the pope also had other powers , which were able to be exercised in a less beneficial manner . 
  he could excommunicate people , and groups of people , regardless of status or size . 
  this made for a useful threat in christian europe . 
  his position as leader of the roman catholic church also meant that when a pope endorsed a monarch , that king or queen was granted the divine-right to rule . 
  this essentially meant that that person was now above all judgement by any man , excepting the pope . 
  no one other than the pope could claim to have the ear of god . 
  this made monarchs nigh on infallible and protected their status . 
  but the pope could also remove this endorsement . 
  a notable example of the power of religious titles is that of henry viii , who was granted the title `` defender of the faith '' by the pope , then had it revoked after he split from the catholic church and was excommunicated . 
  once the new anglican church was set up however , the title was reinstated by the english parliament , and is retains by the british monarch to the present day . 
  we can see from this how important divine-right was -- even after the split from the catholic church , it was important that henry retain religious links and superiority . 
  as the sovereign rulers of the papal states , the popes also had access to the wealth and resources of the papacy , and the papal army . 
  they were also the sovereign rulers of the papal states , making them monarchs in their own right . 
  the church also owned land all across europe -- churches , monasteries , abbeys and the housing of important clerical figures such as bishops . 
  these provided them with a certain degree of economic and regional influence . 
  these were always useful in times of war or peace . 
  the holy roman empire was ruled by the holy roman emperor , who required the current pope to approve him and coronate him . 
  this guy was ( supposedly ) the supreme catholic monarch in europe , and by virtue of the title , heir to charlemagne and ruler of the germanic states . 
  the pope 's blessing being required was just one more reason rome had such importance . 
  two generations after isabella and ferdinand were granted the possession of all those lands and territories columbus discovered , their grandson became the holy roman emperor charles v. 
  so after all that , we see that rome was important because it was the seat of the papacy , who wielded more influence than any other person in europe due to their office of vicar of christ and heir to the throne of st. peter . 
  this in turn meant that the pope could put monarchs into favour , giving them god given rights to rule , or remove them from favour , leaving them open to questions of their legitimacy . 
  as well as that , the pope had the wealth of the church , and significant land holdings across europe . 
  he was also the man responsible for the coronation of the holy roman emperor , who in turn was the leading catholic monarch and the ruler of germany . 
  lastly , as in the case of isabella and ferdinand , he was an invaluable patron , able to give away vast rewards with a single decree .
