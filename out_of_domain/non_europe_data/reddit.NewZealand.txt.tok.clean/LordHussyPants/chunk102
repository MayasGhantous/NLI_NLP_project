  if the sun is up when it would usually be down , then that 's extra time out . 
  but that 's exactly it - seasonal variations means that there 's more usable sunlight . 
  rather than being bright and sunny at 6 or 7am when not many people are utilising it , it 'll be bright and sunny at 7 or 8pm when a lot of people will . 
  it 's the same amount of daylight of course , but it 's the difference between usable and unusable . 
  yeah , it 's not perfect because netflix has the rights to a lot of shows , but it 's good . 
  i 've gone through 8 seasons of seinfeld , which i 'd never seen before , so that was quite a nice thing to be able to access . 
  fair enough . 
  i assumed everyone would value a sit in the sun with their dinner . 
  so i started watching justified a few years ago , and goggins is sublime ( i mean all of the actors on that show are , but we 're talking wg here ) . 
  he fits the character so well , it 's uncanny . 
  * then * , about 2 or 3 seasons into that , i decided i 'd go back and watch the shield because i 'd missed it when i was young . 
  so i see boyd , and then i realise it 's not boyd , this guy is a fuckin ' chameleon . 
  so here i am watching the shield , and wg is now shane vendrell , and he 's also fuckin ' brilliant . 
  sleazy , loyal , doing what needs to be done , and then some if it pays well . 
  the clincher was an episode when their squad go into a house to find someone , and vendrell kicks everyone out and threatens to rape the guy 's wife . 
  he 's holding her down and making her legitimately fear the prospect . 
  i felt sick , and i instantly loathed him . 
  it was something i could n't get past . 
  shane vendrell was automatically scum , and i just hoped that he would get his comeuppance . 
  well i went back to justified a bit later , and lo and behold , boyd crowder 's back . 
  i was wary , but then within 5 words of him speaking , i was cheering for him again . 
  i realised that the only reason i loathed that character so much , was because wg portrayed him so well that it was a very real situation playing out on the screen . 
  he is such a fantastic actor , and it 's mind boggling that he has n't got more big roles along the way . 
  wait , is he related to mark ruffalo . 
  i just googled him and thought i 'd searched the wrong thing, 
  i do n't know if it 's fair to call their salvation a deus ex machina moment - we all had an idea sansa had done that . 
  we knew it was coming . 
  we also knew why jon was n't told about it , and therefore , why his troops did n't know about it . 
  as to your problem with the logic of an unknown jon snow leading , remember that he was riding as the heir to the warden of the north - prestige counts for far more than skill sometimes , as we saw with mace tyrell who was like the proverbial sack of potatoes upon a horse when he rode into king 's landing . 
  i 've just watched that season too !, 
  i really liked how it played with the idea at first , and i genuinely thought they were being seriously injured . 
  by the second or third do over i was a bit annoyed . 
  that said , i 'm always happy to see that show get some appreciation . 
  bloody hell , he 's so good . 
  i ca n't argue with your deus ex interpretation . 
  personally , i do n't think it 's warranted , but you put up a good argument . 
  as for the second part ,, 
   and jon snow should not have been heir to the warden of the north, 
  it does n't matter that he * should n't * have been , it matters that he * was * . 
  the lords of the north did n't ride to battle because sansa asked them , they rode because jon asked for their service . 
  and of the starks left alive , jon is the natural heir to robb because of his military skill and knowledge . 
  sansa would make a fantastic queen , but she has no military prowess yet . 
  arya is an assassin , not a soldier . 
  bran is more suited to the slughorn type , if you will , `` he has never wanted to occupy the throne himself . 
  he prefers the back-seat ; there is more room to spread out . '', 
  rickon is a child at the start of the battle . 
  as to why not sansa as heir , i think that will come eventually , but it has to be handled strategically . 
  sansa and her family are hellbent on ruling winterfell . 
  i do n't imagine she would accept being the wife of winterfell 's ruler . 
  hi [ this is the best thing ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nrl/comments/4eq8bp/round_7_sea_eagles_vs_eels_discussion_thread/d22fqzc ) i 've ever said on / r/nrl, 
  do i need context ? 
  i think someone was talking about gherkins sideline bc the game was boring him, 
  ben hunt . 
  i believe he successfully caught at least one ball in the finals this year, 
  fuck , i love how genuinely surprised and happy he is, 
  the answer to your question is in the article . 
   `` germany views many of the afghans who 've arrived on its soil as economic migrants seeking jobs or education . 
  `` german officials maintain that under international law , germany is not required to grant asylum to those migrants -- unlike syrians , who are fleeing a war zone . 
  no , because the rule is based upon the pairing of the two vowels . 
  if there is a c , then logically the order must be reversed from ` ie ' to ` ei ' . 
  the exceptions appear when you have words still using ` ie ' after a c - sc ** ie ** nce , soc ** ie ** ty , spec ** ie ** s - or words that use ` ei ' with no c in sight - d ** ei ** ty , s ** ei ** ze , h ** ei ** st. 
  it does , because it 's a grammatical rule and there must be a clear indication of what the alternative is . 
  what region do you play in ? 
   but if i have a bad laning stage , i panic and do n't know how to catch up and kinda end up tilted . 
  ok , so do n't panic . 
  that 's first . 
  am is n't as forgiving as spectre , because once she hits 6 she can ult and assist in kills for nothing . 
  but am can put farming simulator to shame . 
  the key thing with anti mage is ** to never give up ** . 
  you can have the entire team yelling at you `` come fight '' , `` come help '' , `` you 're reported '' - ignore them . 
  they do n't matter . 
  four players ca n't win the game , but they can hold off the other team if they do it right . 
  as long as you have your t3s , you can be zipping around the map , counter pushing and farming . 
  to help with your laning phase , try this : start with 2 x tangoes , 1 x salve , 1 x quelling . 
  that 's plenty of survivability ( which you need because they * will * focus you ) , and it will get you through any lane , even something like a silencer/necro . 
  item build : ring of regen , ring of health , power treads , battlefury . 
  heaps of regen . 
  that ring of regen is crazy helpful , because of the +2 hp/s and because it now builds into vlads , which lets you farm everything . 
  ancients , jungle camps , lanes . 
  so with treads , bf , vlads , you can farm all 5 jungle camps in ~ 35-40sec , and then push out the safe lane a bit . 
  make sure there 's a ward around the jungle and chop down any trees to give better vision , and you 're able to farm away relatively safely until you have your manta . 
  get manta , and you can come to fights . 
  walk , do n't blink , unless you 're sure of winning . 
  farm up that butterfly , then assess . 
  are you dying a lot because you have low hp ? 
  heart . 
  are you getting disabled too much ? 
  bkb or linkens . 
  do they have someone like pa with evasion ? 
  do you need a way of locking someone down ? 
  sheepstick . 
  and in lane , if you 're against magic , just level your blink + spell shield until 8 , mana burn at 9 , ult at 10 , 11 . 
  fighting is overrated with am until you have items . 
  just remember that adaption is key . 
  this build might not work for you . 
  i use it as a very defensive player - i do n't try jump on fights too early , or even in the lane , unless it 's 100 % guarantee . 
  i see a lot of ams who waste gold . 
  they build wands and poor man 's shield in lane . 
  pms means you need to buy another stout for vanguard if you like abyssal . 
  it means you wasted 300 on 2 agi slippers , which would have brought you the vlads ring .
