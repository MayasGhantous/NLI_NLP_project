  just try stuff out , and remember that am needs two things : survivability ( spell shield + regen + blink ) and battlefury . 
  like i said below , it 's preference . 
  i do n't like to build abyssal since the sacred relic was swapped out , and i prefer early regen to a minimal amount of damage block . 
  i do n't build a pms , so it 's not going to build into any sort of agi bonus for me , whereas the ring i buy after the first wave does give me regen and builds into my vlads . 
  you misunderstood me . 
  i meant now as in `` now you 've completed your battlefury , this ring of regen will turn into vlads . '', 
  i was n't suggesting that the makeup for vlads has been altered . 
  i do n't buy a stout at all . 
  i do n't like abyssal since it lost the damage element , and i do n't want to waste gold on a pms . 
  the 16 blocked damage is n't worth it imo . 
  i find i can usually do all that already because of the high early regen i have , but i 'll give it a go in my next game . 
  guys , i 'm like 99 % sure it was a civ joke . 
  i remember someone doing this in one of my undergrad classes . 
  they realised about 10 min later , walked out . 
  the rest of us kinda sat there like `` oh shit , he has to do all that again ?? '', 
  i agree . 
  silly to change up the rules now . 
  i do n't even know if a margin is essential in the super rugby version because / u/jaumebg mentioned introducing a maximum of 2 picks against teams too . 
  that said , with super rugby i imagine it 'll be moved a bit given it 's so large . 
  how amazing is it that the skin is so strong that it does n't tear at the top part of the picture, 
  robert quarles in * justified * . 
  joffrey in * game of thrones * . 
  this is a thing though . 
  selling a house recently , the real estate agent would call us and say that a buyer had made an offer , and would then come to present it in person . 
  she was n't allowed to give us the offer over the phone . 
  i can see the same thing happening with lawyers , especially in big deals like that where you might need to look at a contract and one glance could show a clause you were n't happy with . 
  unfortunately , no , we did n't . 
  people who are die hard trump supporters will spin it for him . 
  t_d is partying because they think he just smashed it out of the park . 
  unfortunately , they have votes . 
  you know what gerrymandering does , right ? 
  i really do n't know what you 're trying to say here . 
  trump had the run of that debate because he 's too rude to be quiet when he 's asked . 
  every time hillary was told she had exceeded her time , she wrapped up what she was saying . 
  trump would start a new point when he got told that . 
   the racial makeup of the town is 96 % white ( 93.8 % were non-hispanic white ) , [ 11 ] 2.57 % black , 0.53 % asian , 0.04 % native american , 0.02 % pacific islander , 0.21 % from other races , and 0.63 % from two or more races . 
  2.56 % of the population are hispanic or latino of any race . 
  wikipedia demographics for palm beach . 
  do you ? 
  of course they 're not 100 % , but they 're bloody effective and have an enormous effect on voting results . 
  by cutting a low income area with a population of 50,000 in half , and putting each half into two different voting districts , a vote that might have gone the way of the democrats is artificially rigged . 
  it takes a 50,000 vote bloc and turns it into 2 25,000 vote blocs , which do n't have anywhere near the same effect . 
  since america runs on first past the post , that 's a huge change . 
  first of all , 500 voters out of 10,500 is 4 % , which is substantially less than the 20-30 % which op suggested would fix the issue . 
  secondly , gerry mandering is n't just about rigging voting areas so that candidates have an easy win . 
  it also engenders a sense that a vote does n't count . 
  in my country , i live in a blue area and i vote red or green . 
  my area has been blue for over 70 years , and wo n't change soon . 
  my candidate vote is meaningless here . 
  gerrymandering has the same effect because unless that entire 30 % goes out and votes , nothing changes . 
  it 's not just a numbers game , it 's psychological too . 
  so no , it 's not as simple as 30 % voting , because thirdly , areas that are targeted by gerrymandering are the same areas that lawmakers target with voter disenfranchisement measures - photo id requirements , closing polling stations early or only opening them at times when people work , and making voter registration more difficult than in other areas . 
  [ ** and lastly , ** i did n't downvote you ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vkz1sjx.png ) , because i can stand on the strength of my argument rather than taking away one of your internet points . 
  i mean , that does n't sound entirely wasteful . 
  some hotels have no refunds if you 've reserved a room . 
  he paid and went to better accomodation , reimbursing the hotel he was at for any fees they may have lost for hosting him . 
  because i ca n't imagine you 're suggesting he 's wasteful for wanting to have similar accommodation to other heads of state , rather than taking an unsuitable suite for his position . 
  i 'm not misinterpreting anything . 
  you , and the several other people above you , tried to brush off gerrymandering as if it 's not a big thing and put the blame on non-voters . 
  ** gerrymandering is electoral fraud on an official level . 
  when you have districts shaped like a lower intestine wrapping around an entire city because the local elections board wants to maintain control , * the system is god damned broken and it 's not the fault of the voters * . 
   i do n't want to get into a discussion about the validity of photoid requirements ... but most americans require photoid to make a living and live legally . 
  photoid requirements prevent voter fraud , and i ca n't think of any other first world nations ( with functional democracies ) that do n't make an effort to prevent voter fraud . 
  it seems asinine to be up in arms about it , but i guess many other hot button topics can be called asinine too . 
  too bad it 's an important issue which affects the outcomes of elections in conjunction with gerrymandering . 
  photo id disenfranchises the poor , the elderly , and often minorities . 
  how is photo id required to make a living ? 
  how is it required to live legally ? 
  you should really do some research . 
  america is in the minority for requiring photo id ( at least among first world nations with functional democracies , which the us might even be excluded from ? ), 
  new zealand requires no form of voter id . 
  when i voted , [ this is all i needed to take with me . 
  ] ( http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/images/2011%20easyvote%20card%20front.jpg ) it 's the size of a credit card . 
  australia , denmark , and the united kingdom also require ** no id to vote ** . 
  all four countries had higher turnout than the united states in 2012 . 
  australia and denmark had 90 % and 80 % turnout respectively , while the uk had a dismal mid-60s percentage which still beat the us by 10 % . 
  [ here 's an article about how bullshit requiring voter id is . 
  ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/voter-id-proponents-point-to-laws-in-other-countries/2012/07/12/gjqavlgcfw_blog.html ) because it 's not issued automatically to voters , it 's an extra step required to vote . 
  contrast that with being mailed a piece of cardboard with your details on it at the first election after your 18th birthday and being told you now get to elect someone . 
  hopefully you do a bit of reading , but it 's up to you to learn about why this is all wrong . 
  edit : half the stats do n't even require photo id . 
  wyoming , vermont , washington dc , west virginia , pennsylvania , new mexico , new jersey , new york , nevada , nebraska . 
  and a bunch more . 
  i just went up the alphabetical list backwards . 
  oh and republicans are * always * the ones introducting voter id laws . 
  did you know that ? 
  i wonder why that is . 
  they 're generally the gerrymanderers too !, 
  oh and for your information , photo id only prevents one type of fraud , of which there have been less than 40 cases of since 2000 . 
  40 cases , in 4 elections , with how many people voting ? 
  i do n't know how you can defend voter id laws , because voter fraud is literally not a fucking issue . 
  god that looks awesome . 
  as i said before , republicans are the ones that propagate the myth of voter fraud in order to pass laws that disenfranchise those that wo n't vote for them . 
  so you 'd do better to provide sources that are n't from a rightwing mouthpiece . 
  i do n't know you . 
  maybe you 're a republican . 
  maybe you 're some idealistic kid who thinks democracy must be protected at all costs . 
  whoever you are , you should be ashamed of yourself . 
  because you 're wilfully advocating for the continuation of racist and discriminatory practices against voters in the * so-called * land of the free . 
  it 's sickening .
