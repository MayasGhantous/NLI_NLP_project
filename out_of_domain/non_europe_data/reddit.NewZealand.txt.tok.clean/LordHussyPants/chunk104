  lmao , you 're so stupid it hurts to read . 
  this is the perfect time . 
  i 've never heard anything about a pillow , but regardless of that , it 's still assault . 
  it 's not as bad as the penguin getting buttfucked by another bird 's beak . 
  my arse clenched harder than it ever has before . 
  i was n't sure either and might have shot a little high ... by 10k or so ... 
  it started with 10 and had several numbers after it . 
  i was n't sure if it was weighted against votes and seasonal performance , so it 's completely absurd haha, 
  i have a glass topped coffee table in my living room that we 've had for several years . 
  it 's not once had any sort of water get in between the glass and the wood - and it has a collection of papers underneath it as decoration so we 'd know if it did . 
  how do you see water collecting under the glass ? 
  sopoaga 's a first five . 
  edit : who the hell downvoted this ? 
  mckenzie is not in that squad as a first five eighth , he is there as a fullback . 
  there is no argument on this . 
  what team ever puts three first fives in the game day 23 ? 
  smith to wing , mckenzie to fullback . 
  barrett to other wing , sopoaga to first five . 
  it 's only if they need to . 
  hansen will probably prefer to let the starting wings finish the 80min . 
  but if they both go down , he can rotate cover easily enough . 
  i 'm not sure how accurate the number is since it 's cited in a tv show ( and is from 2012 ) , but [ here 's an up to date one . 
  ] ( http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/mar/17/greg-abbott/light-match-greg-abbotts-claim-about-rampant-voter/ ), 
  oh and cc / u/jimmydorry - look , voter fraud is n't a thing !, 
  but disenfranchisement is . 
  i want to state first that i like your comment , because you acknowledge the problem with disenfranchisement of groups by requiring voter id . 
  but i 'm interested in why you support a requirement for id to vote ( assuming that everyone in the country has one ) , so could you tell ? 
  the reality is that voter fraud is not a thing . 
  and / u/dylanhousman , having a photo id would n't have stopped that . 
  you do n't have to be a citizen to get a driver 's licence . 
  this is brilliant . 
  last time i explained trigger warnings on reddit , i pointed out that 99 % of redditors use them anyway . 
  how ? 
  a [ nsfw ] tag is essentially a trigger warning . 
  it 's telling you that there is something in this link that might not be safe to open in your present situation . 
  have some more evidence . 
  my cousin had a man pull up alongside her in his car once . 
  he asked her for directions . 
  she gave them . 
  he questioned one of them and she was confused because he seemed to be acting dumb . 
  she stepped a bit closer to repeat herself , and she saw that he was masturbating in the car while talking to her . 
  another time , she was walking home , and heard a sound from a hedge . 
  she turned to look , and could see a man crouched there flashing his dick at her . 
  it happens . 
  disclaimer : i do n't think police are deranged hoodlums . 
  i would n't call police a gang with guns . 
  but i think there are bad practices , and mistakes made , and instead of holding someone accountable the trend seems to be to close ranks and accuse people of being ungrateful , or fearmongering , or racist . 
  on to the list .

  edit : downvoted after posting in good faith :'), 
  is this done line by line ? 
  i 'm curious to hear your logic on a kid on a swing being `` bad driving tactics '' ? 
  also , how do you define justified ? 
  because i think maybe that could be the problem . 
  you said alfred olango was a justified kill , despite him being unarmed , and his sister specifically saying he was mentally ill and needed help . 
  i do n't see shooting with impunity as justified . 
   in a 911 call released by the police , a man said that `` a guy '' who appeared to be a juvenile was pointing a pistol at people and scaring them . 
  the caller said twice that the gun was `` probably fake . '', 
   `` there is a guy with a pistol , '' the caller said . 
  `` it 's probably fake , but he 's pointing it at everybody . '', 
  [ from the nyt . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/24/us/boy-12-dies-after-being-shot-by-cleveland-police-officer.html ), 
  if a member of the public can tell that it 's fake , why ca n't a trained police officer ? 
  these incidents are n't cops defending themselves - they 're cops shooting to kill . 
   maybe his sister should 've helped him before it got to this point . 
  so in america , who do you call to help you if someone is mentally ill and needs to be restrained ? 
  if you need assistance , because you 're not big and strong enough to calm down and restrain a grown man , who do you call ? 
  i 'd appreciate if you stop down voting my comments . 
  as i said in my first one , i posted in good faith because i wanted to have a discussion . 
   slavery was a well established institurion accross the world before europeans made their way to africa , and was actually a big part of many african tribes ' economies again well before europeans sought to bring slaves to the fledgling us . 
  this does n't excuse it , nor does it wipe out the effects of slavery , and the ramifications that are still present in modern society . 
  i ca n't be fucked responding to the rest of what you say , but if you are actually a cop , i 'd hope you 're a bit smarter than dismissing history to the past and acknowledging that the present does not exist in a vacuum . 
  that said , * the man in the high castle * is a really good look at a nazi victory without any praise or glamourisation . 
  the seven wonders of the ancient world were so-called because of the magnificence of their creation . 
  they were constructions that later men and women were in awe of ; the work of ancient minds that operated on a grander scale than was thought possible . 
  originally , they were n't called wonders at all , ` it was not as `` wonders '' that such monuments were first listed , but as `` sights '' - not , in the greek , * thaumata * ( wonders ) , but as * theamata * ( things to be seen ) ' . 
  to the ancients , they were the creations of contemporaries , and were essentially written about as an early form of tourist attraction . 
  travellers were told about them as marvellous things they should take in on their journeys . 
  many writers mentioned them in their texts , herodotus being one of the most famous names , and credited with the earliest recording of the sights to be seen . 
  over time , as people became more distanced from the creation of these structures , they were viewed with more incredulity , or wonder . 
  clayton and price write that the common usage in the greek shifted from * theamata * ( sights ) to * thaumata * ( wonder ) , and it was set . 
  concurrently , the passage of time provided more perspective on the wonders themselves , and the list was narrowed down by various people . 
  many people had differing lists through time though .
