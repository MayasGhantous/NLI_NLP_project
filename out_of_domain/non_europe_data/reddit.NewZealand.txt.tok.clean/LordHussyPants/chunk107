  when you 're fatigued , you 're fatigued . 
  coffee , singing , music , windows down , moistening your eyelids - none of that actually helps the fatigue , it just masks it . 
  yeah , and that 's why there are worker laws . 
  if you 're fatigued , the only thing you can do is get another driver to drive , or take a rest . 
  if you 're not allowed to do that , then you 're putting your life at risk , and the lives of your passengers and other people on the road . 
  [ here 's an advert that used to air when i was younger . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myjkwlejjng ) do n't mess around with fatigue . 
  that rings a bell . 
  there were 1146 people killed by us police in 2015 . 
  there were 130 law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty in 2015 . 
  not all of the 1146 were illegitimate kills by police . 
  not all of the 130 cops died at the hands of civilians . 
  at night is very different to during the day , and i 'd hazard a guess that when a game warden catches you out in the back of beyond you could be up to any number of things he is wary of disturbing . 
  they buried the bar six feet down and he 's still tripping over it . 
  this is a fairer approach i think . 
  it 's still not good , but it 's kinder to england at least . 
  on the subject of overseas players though , i think you have to give a pass in some areas . 
  manu tuilagi has been in the uk since he was 13 , and he was educated and played all his rugby there . 
  likewise , jerome kaino moved to nz when he was 4 , and grew up here . 
  kerr-barlow is 1 of 650,000 kiwis in aus/1 of 128,000 maori , and went to school at hamilton boys . 
  this is the annoying side of `` foreign born player '' allegations . 
  these players are n't poached , and they are n't wholly homegrown - they 're a product of both countries . 
  i did , when i had about 5 hours play time . 
  who clicks show in shop though ? 
  there is no s in the te reo alphabet , maori is the singular and the plural . 
   sometimes , reading translations of very old documents , i get the feeling the writer was trying to describe a concept that their language did n't have a word for at the time . 
  here the writer is describing fraud , plain and simple , but stretches that into a three-line description . 
  do we know if the egyptians had a word for fraud at the time ? 
  it 's not always fraud though , it 's a bit more nuanced than that and is applied to different areas as you can see - farming , merchants , builders . 
  it 's probably stated as it is to show that whatever it is is a wrongdoing no matter who you are - no one is about maat . 
  to add more to the original post about maat , it was a very different concept to anything we have today . 
  maat quite literally defined who you were . 
  by this , i mean that if you were living in egypt you were considered egyptian no matter your origin , so long as you lived according to maat . 
  if you did n't abide by the principles of maat , even if you were the son of the pharaoh , you were an outsider . 
   but these players will probably run circles around the womens team, 
  what makes you think that ? 
  serious . 
  the sparta women 's club is the best in the czech republic . 
  they have players who are highly capped in the women 's international side , but the two guys who are in trouble have only played 10 international games - they 're not the best of players . 
  and since women 's football is n't as big as men 's , the concentration of good players in a women 's league will be more on one team , which suggests that a team that has won 18 of the previous 23 championships will be quite strong . 
  on skills , these two could be easily matched by the women . 
  what u15 boys team did that ? 
  it 's not that at all . 
  it 's an aspect of slytherin history that was very important in the founding of the school houses . 
  salazar slytherin only wanted to teach purebloods , and as such , the students selected for his house were from old pureblood families . 
  the only student with muggle heritage we ever see join slytherin is tom riddle , who coincidentally , was also slytherin 's heir which kind of trumps his muggle father . 
  ok , this is like the fourth time in this thread i 've seen this misused . 
  the word is * canon * . 
  a cannon is a weapon . 
  or it 's because they were sending a horde of underage witches and wizards to a local village without supervision , while quidditch was played on school grounds , in front of some of the most skilled witches and wizards in the country . 
  it depends . 
  in a country like myanmar which was colonised by the british , and where their religion was disrespected by those colonisers , it 's pretty fair of them to have a law saying tourists must respect our culture and religion . 
  oh , i thought this was an encounter rate , but instead it 's something that has not mattered at all as long as you can swipe in a straight line . 
  if you do n't respect the culture of a country , why are you there ? 
  newsflash : it 's not * your * country , and you are both a guest , and privileged to be there . 
  they do n't have to allow you across the border , but they do on the condition you show some respect . 
  you have a funny definition of respect . 
  jesus boys , week of upsets . 
  but they realised it , and that 's everything . 
  especially when you have companies that come back an double down saying it is n't an issue . 
  yes , the kiwi media which has been linked in this thread exactly ... oh , ** zero ** times . 
  rokocoko is like fifty now , and carter has struggled with injury throughout his career . 
  it 's really not that surprising that 'd he be using these medically . 
  i also would n't be surprised if some shady doc did n't fill out a form , but new zealand media is reporting that he did , so i guess we now wait and see . 
  q : how are you a florida native if you moved there in 95 ? 
  i mean , i was being sarcastic , but in terms of winger age , he 's old . 
  i 'm not sure you should be weighing in on how the country is governed if you cant see how voter id laws are an unnecessary hindrance to voting . 
  i see you 're trying to propagate voter id misconceptions !, 
  let 's do some statistics to clear this up !, 
  australia is a democratic country that has elected a new pm every 1.5 years on average since 2010 . 
  they ** do not ** require voter id !, 
  they have [ 90 % turnout in elections ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/australian_federal_election,_2016 ) , compared to america 's 55 % . 
  they are [ also less corrupt than the united states !, 
  ] ( http://www.transparency.org/cpi2015#results-table ), 
  new zealand is a democratic country that elects leaders every 3 years . 
  they ** do not ** require voter id !, 
  they are the 4th least corrupt nation in the world . 
  [ they had 78 % voter turnout !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_zealand_general_election,_2014 ), 
  denmark and the uk also do not require id to vote !, 
  germany and ireland require it only if the poll worker asks for confirmation !, 
  all of these countries had higher voter turnout than america !, 
  this indicates that voter id laws can play a role in restricting voter turnout !, 
   countries such as spain , greece , france , malta , belgium , and italy provide national identity documents to their citizens to use for many purposes , including travel , banking , and healthcare access as well as voting . 
  this means that they effectively do not require id , because their government provides it to them . 
  america is not like these normal democracies . 
  america forces its citizens to procure their own id by sometimes extreme measures , and restricts their civic duties if they can not achieve this !, 
  hope your misconception has been corrected !, 
  there is evidence of fraud . 
  it 's something like 80 cases in 20 years . 
  80 cases in a population of 300 million plus . 
  over 4 elections . 
  assuming half of those 300m are voting age , that 's 600m votes able to be cast at 100 % turnout , and only 80 case of voter fraud have been discovered and prosecuted ? 
  but sure , let 's disenfranchise several thousand people per election to stop those 80 people voting for a third party `` unlock area 51 and show us the aliens !! '', 
  if we 're going for the bare minimum , he supports smaller government . 
  do they not ? 
  i thought they were all about states ' right to make decisions over federal ? 
  is habana really in the top two south african wingers at the moment though ? 
  ... that would be the concessions to a radical political movement , would it not ? 
  first thing i ever baked was brownie .
