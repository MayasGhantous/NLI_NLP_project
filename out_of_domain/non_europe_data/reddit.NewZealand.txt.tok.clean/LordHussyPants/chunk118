  and then sprays you with a hose , you 're receiving a negative impact - for your race and gender . 
  so what 's the issue with protecting people from that ? 
  i think this is correct , but i do n't see a lot of his supporters taking a concession quietly . 
  they 'd probably flip to something like `` trump 's been bought by the conspiracy ! '', 
  lmao , number 1 is obama knowing about an email server . 
  number 2 is hillary wanting free trade and open travel around the americas . 
  want to know a dirty liberal secret ? 
  ** free trade will make america more wealthy and give americans a better standard of living because they can export more product , and import more for cheaper . 
  remember when he had a latino reporter kicked out of a presser , and literally said `` go back to univision '' ? 
  tremendous smarties , they 're just great people . 
  i 'm so confused . 
  she 's a legal immigrant with illegal family members ? 
  and fox tried to spin it that she was illegal too ? 
  ok , good point . 
  so you do n't want to be associated with racism , because a character that looks like you in a movie was racist ? 
  you 're not actually a racist , so really , you have nothing to worry about . 
  but you 're uncomfortable with the association , right ? 
  it 's not a good feeling . 
  so what if someone refers to a trans-woman as ` he ' . 
  they 're in a room and when someone asks where jessica is , they respond `` oh , he 's gone to the bathroom . '', 
  jessica , who has transitioned and is now legally a woman , is being called a ` he ' , and does n't like it . 
  other people here this and some will go `` oh that 's weird , so-and-so used the wrong word , what a dick '' and some will go `` oh , maybe jessica is still a dude '' while some others will go `` i knew it !, 
  not a real woman ! '', 
  jessica does n't want to be called ` he ' because it associates her with manliness , and her original gender . 
  it invalidates her status as a woman . 
  so again , what 's wrong with protecting people from negative impact ? 
  damn , that 9.5 line was generous with the way these guys are playing . 
  so should racial discrimination laws be overturned ? 
  but they 're very specific . 
  [ here 's the canadian law being debated . 
  ] ( http://www.parl.gc.ca/housepublications/publication.aspx?language=e&amp;mode=1&amp;docid=8280564 ), 
   the purpose of this act is to extend the laws in canada to give effect , within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of parliament ,, 
  so the law is to apply only within the federal authority of the canadian parliament . 
   to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated , consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society ,, 
  ... and it will guard the principle that all canadians should be able to do the same things as other canadians ... 
   without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race , national or ethnic origin , colour , religion , age , sex , sexual orientation , gender identity or expression , marital status , family status , disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered . 
  ... regardless of these 12 things which some people might not like . 
  effectively all it says is that you ca n't refuse to provide goods and services to someone because they 're black , or from finland , or muslim , or 70 , or 20 , or male or female , or gay , or because they look like a dude , but they dress like a chick , or because they 're unmarried , or disabled , or because once upon a time they got wrongfully accused of something . 
  so again i ask , what 's the problem ? 
  it 's very simple to understand . 
  we 've already established that you do n't want to be tainted by association for being a white male ( race + gender ) , so why should n't black gay female appearing people who identify as male have this choice too ? 
  my dad and i watched it delayed ( we avoided all internet and news sources so we could sleep in ) so about halfway through the afternoon , we 're sitting in a sunny room going `` what the fuck is going on here ? '', 
  as nz scored all the comeback points , and wondering if it was match fixing . 
  then ireland took that final try and we both laughed and he said `` well that 's done it , about time they beat us . 
  how much did you have on the abs ? '', 
  as soon as we saw it scored , we knew just as well as you did . 
  to be fair to all critics of savea , he was 5m out from the touchline and he ended up tackled in goal . 
  that was a colossal fuck up . 
  you deserve it , this is the best rugby shitpost towards nz i 've ever seen . 
  definitely was n't joe moody, 
   highlanders fans are pretty great . 
  always gracious in defeat, 
  ** practice makes perfect **, 
  but you 're an adult , so you can go buy some !, 
  this is my good deed for the week . 
  yo , it 's definitely ** a ** charm . 
  yeah , the correct statement would be `` america is at the bottom of the list of first world countries on many metrics '' . 
   bernie is n't trying to be a politician, 
  then he should get the fuck out of politics . 
  but that 's not true anyway . 
  bernie 's an independent who caucuses with the democrats and works tirelessly in the senate . 
  he 's a politician , and he 's a good one at that . 
  however , ( and i 've said it before ) , i do n't know that he would have made a good president . 
  i 'm sure there are several million people who are proud of hillary . 
  iceland ? 
  do n't forget the mass disenfranchisement in florida 2000 when voting rolls were purged . 
  i live next door to a polling station in nz . 
  jump the fence , walk into a small building with 20 polling booths . 
  grab a form . 
  tick . 
  walk out . 
  home . 
  5min from the decision of `` might as well go do it now '' to end tops . 
  good reasoning . 
  my problem with that is that snipers are already fairly conspicuous because of the scope flashing whenever it points at you . 
  i mean , that 's sort of the point of sniping right ? 
  is that you have to work a bit to figure out where they are . 
  sorry , i assumed i was talking to someone who knew how to connect basic sentences that they 've read . 
  i 'll make it simpler . 
   donald trump is a certified lunatic, 
  this is from my first comment . 
   he 's a compulsive liar , and shouts ` wrong ! ', 
  at people while muttering under his breath, 
  this is from my second . 
  the second comment is an example of the behaviour of donald trump . 
  there 's video evidence . 
  this behaviour is an example of how a lunatic behaves . 
  * therefore * ( we use the word therefore when supporting information has been given for a prior statement to transition into a conclusion ) donald trump is behaving like a lunatic . 
   most of his own party do n't like him . 
  statement from first comment !, 
   huge parts of his party refused to endorse him , including the leader of the party , and the only members of the party that anyone actually respects, 
  supporting statement !, 
  * therefore * ( that pesky word again ) , donald trump is not liked by his party . 
  i hope that clears things up for you kiddo . 
  i know we should focus on the basketball , but what 's up with the heat uniforms lmao, 
  actually ? 
  i feel a little bad now aha, 
  lol , yeah , let 's accuse hillary and bill of corruption because they get paid to speak , when literally * everyone * does it , and [ ** trump ** does it for even more money than they do . 
  ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com.au/donald-trump-makes-a-lot-of-money-for-a-speech-2015-8?r=us&amp;ir=t ), 
  holy fuck haha , i ca n't imagine how many cops have had this happen to them , that 's brilliant,
