  as for how it prevents people from voting , i 'll link you [ this article ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/03/how-voter-id-laws-are-being-used-to-disenfranchise-minorities-and-the-poor/254572/ ) because it explains it a lot better than i will . 
  voter disenfranchisement is very much a real problem today . 
  and just in case you think , `` well , that 's not so bad because lots of people from both sides will get hurt like that '' , [ there are studies confirming that it affects young people more ] ( http://www.civicyouth.org/popups/factsheets/fs07_registration.pdf ) . 
  [ and here is another wikipedia page elaborating the different ways it happens , and giving examples in american elections since 2002 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voter_suppression_in_the_united_states ) again , google will provide plenty of evidence too if you dislike wikipedia . 
  i advanced my argument against world government five posts back . 
  you chose to say that my reasons were wrong , so i gave you evidence that they were n't . 
  since you do n't seem to be able to take concrete evidence and pull a conclusion out of it , i 'm gon na leave this now . 
  liminality at its finest . 
  he 's had practice . 
  the comment you 're referencing is referring to a different idea of the `` noble savage '' . 
  the modern version , which you 're asking about , is as far as i know an entirely european view , used alongside racist views of non-european peoples to distinguish those groups which were higher up the scale of `` civilized '' , and therefore were capable of being `` tamed '' . 
  in some areas of the world , the indigenous people were beyond help . 
  this was the case in south america , where efforts were made to convert the indigenous population but no efforts were made to civilize them . 
  the conversion only served to protect them from hell in the eyes of europeans , and was seen as a kindness . 
  in new zealand , the m\u0101ori were viewed favourably by their british colonizers . 
  at least , as favourably as non-europeans could be viewed . 
  they were seen to have ,, 
   [ ... ] capacity for civilization . 
  indeed the m\u0101ori had the good fortune to be ranked higher than most other ` savages ' . 
  exponents of the old theory of a great chain of being invariably put the maori somewhat above the unfortunate hottentots or australian aborigines who were usually placed in the last links in the chain between man and the apes . 
  even in newer forms of racial classifications of humans , the m\u0101ori fared well compared to others :, 
   it was much the same if a more modern though still pre-darwinian evolutionary scheme was used , for the m\u0101ori , [ ... ] were usually placed on the border between savagery and barbarism and assumed to be capable , with proper guidance , of graduating to civilization . 
  despite these quotes however , the m\u0101ori were never really viewed with the `` noble savage '' descriptor by the british - it was the french who had this idea . 
  marion du fresne in particular subscribed to that view , and it cost him and twenty of his men their lives , when they assumed that the `` nobility '' of m\u0101ori would allow him to flout their laws . 
  laws which he viewed as lesser because the m\u0101ori were not civilized like europeans . 
  so we can see the concept of the `` noble savage '' was inextricably linked with colonization , and a desire to rank ethnic groups into a racial hierarchy . 
  it was used to separate those ` savages ' who were beyond help from those who were able to progress . 
  the attempt to civilize m\u0101ori through colonization was often referred to as a process of making `` brown skinned englishmen '' , which is rather telling - the idea that a group could be brought up to one level , while others could n't . 
  i hope that 's a decent explanation of it , and how it was applied in some areas of history .

  sorry , i meant where do you source for this sub . 
  primary sources for most of the topics here are impossible to find , and most people seem to be referencing books but it would seem incredibly lucky that they just happen to have all that material . 
   just the french word for austrian, 
  however , the continued use of the term was indicative of a deep mistrusting of marie antoinette and she was never properly accepted by the french public because of it . 
  arguments against miscegenation were usually based around the fall of the white race , or a toppling of the status quo . 
  so , yes , they were similar to arguments against same-sex marriage in that both feared change would arise from the legalization of either . 
  as for religious reasons , i do n't think there were any against miscegenation . 
  the only example i can find of a religious argument is this one from the trial of richard loving and mildred jeter in virginia in 1967 :, 
   this governmental interest in selective breeding led the trial judge to declare `` almighty god created the races white , black , yellow , malay and red , and he placed them on separate continents ... 
  he did not intend for them to mix . '', 
  the argument only invokes god , and does not refer to biblical theory . 
  however , it is a key part of racial theory , and that was often informed by religious beliefs . 
  according to biblical history , the sons of noah were the ones that repopulated the earth , being the last ones alive . 
  three of those sons , japheth , shem , and ham , were used to classify different ethnic groups in early racial theory . 
  those descended off of japheth were in europe , shem 's descendants in asia , and ham 's in africa . 
  the bible also makes reference to a curse by noah on canaan , although this was misinterpreted in europe as `` the curse of ham '' . 
  as africans were supposedly the `` sons of ham '' , they too were cursed , and seen as inferior . 
  this was a justification of the slave trade and the inferiority of africans in later centuries . 
  so while miscegenation was n't argued against in religious concepts , it * was * argues against with racial ones , of which one origin was found in religion . 
  it 's important to remember that this religious rationalization of racial inferiority was n't the only concept - phrenology , the great chain of being , and other means were used to classify races as lower than the caucasians of europe . 
  i assume you 're referring to `` chienne '' ? 
  that was used , and commonly in written material as a play on words . 
  is it * the adventures of sherlock holmes * ? 
  the major issue with disregarding oral history is as / u/khosikulu says below : it 's a way of denying the expression of history prior to the entry of western nations into those regions . 
  as for not conforming to the same chronology or representational strategy , i 'd assume he 's referring to the cultural differences inherent in recording history . 
  i ca n't speak to the experience of australians , or the formation of their identities through service in wwi , but i 'll happily cover the new zealand aspect of this . 
  ( p.s. 
  thanks for reposting the question , i spent half an hour typing at 2am and got told it 'd been removed ) . 
  at the outbreak of war , new zealand had been an official part of the british empire for 74 years , dating this to the signing of the treaty of waitangi in 1840 . 
  considering that in 1840 there were only some 2000 european settlers in new zealand , it 's fair to say that the pakeha ( non-m\u0101ori ) population in 1914 was at most , two generations removed from europe . 
  as such , england was often referred to as `` home '' among the settlers , even though some had never been there , and neither had their parents . 
  the nickname for new zealand was `` the britain of the south '' , and was used commonly both in new zealand , and back in the uk . 
  the settlers of new zealand , and their first descendants , were seen as the `` cream of the british population '' . 
  they had settled in the wild , and made a successful colony . 
  social legislation was being passed in the later years of the nineteenth century providing for the better health of children , and the population in general . 
  this all bolstered the attitude of being the best that britain could offer , and was furthered by more efforts and organisations such as the plunket society , whose mission is still stated today as , `` to ensure that new zealand children are among the healthiest in the world . '', 
  the rural atmosphere of new zealand and this new interest in child welfare was all meant to maintain the superior stock of new zealanders for the future , and world war i was the first test of that . 
  when war was declared , new zealanders reacted enthusiastically . 
  echoing the sentiments of one of the slogans , `` 98 % british '' , war was felt to be a duty to the empire . 
  new zealand sent more troops in proportion to their population than any other british dominion at the time - some 100,000 in total . 
  by doing this , new zealanders were able to claim that their ties with britain were unbreakable . 
  gallipoli was the ultimate display of this . 
  the first news new zealand heard of gallipoli was in a telegram from london . 
  it read :, 
   his majesty 's government desires me to offer you their warmest congratulations on the splendid gallantry and magnificent achievement of your contingent in the successful progress of the operations at the dardanelles, 
  this news was enormous . 
  it was n't really news at all of course , as it was a relatively uninformed message . 
  but it was proudly displayed across the newspapers , in piecemeal phrases . 
   the * new zealand herald * ran headlines of ` splendid gallantry ' and ` new zealanders praised ' . 
  making the most of this limited information ... 
   the christchurch * press * concluded that new zealanders now had the ` joy and satisfaction of knowing that when the test of battle came they were not found wanting ' . 
  the `` cream of the british population '' was therefore flourishing in battle for the empire , and it was confirmed by messages from the capital of that empire . 
  the rural atmosphere i mentioned above came into it too , with one reporter saying that new zealanders had `` shown the mettle of their pastures at the dardanelles '' . 
  the battle at the dardanelles had been talked up previously too , by the papers . 
  they claimed that if it was won , it would be a turning point in the war . 
  so the assumed success from the early reports was all the better for the british population in new zealand . 
  however , gallipoli was not a success . 
  the casualties were enormous , and the australian and new zealand troops withdrew .
