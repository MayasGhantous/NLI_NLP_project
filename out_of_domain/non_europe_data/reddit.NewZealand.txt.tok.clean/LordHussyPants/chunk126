  [ wall street journal held an exclusive interview with president-elect trump .

  they 'll attack older lions too , and anything that 's alone is fair game to a pack of adult hyenas . 
  this seems misleading . 
  when nicholas cage is making 2 movies a year , he has ( a ) much more disposable income and ( b ) in theory twice as many filming locations . 
  this would mean that he has a greater chance of encountering people standing by pools , and the money available to settle lawsuits after he has pushed people to their deaths in pools . 
  this is the attitude of the left that was missing a week ago , what the fuck, 
  there is , it 's the dude getting up and high fiving everyone . 
  before that it was funny as hell, 
   can we please not have the first woman president be someone whose political experience derived from the wedding altar . 
  how about you take a second to stop diminishing the political prowess of a woman who has held a career in her own right for thirty years ? 
  reddit liberals think that bernie is the messiah , that bipartisan politics is betrayal , that moderate-centrist policies are weakness , and that every other democrat wants exactly the same thing . 
  amazing how the dnc is n't considering michelle obama at all . 
  look at everything kanye 's achieves whenever he tries something new . 
  he 'd probably get peace in palestine or some shit . 
  in the battlefield 1 beta , a mortar exploded next to me . 
  i was wearing surround sound headphones , and i could hear the sand landing all around me , grain by grain , as if i was at the beach . 
  i went to a library where my friend works the other day and they had a mezzanine floor that was dead silent . 
  the weird thing is that the * very first step * you took as you got off the stairs was onto a warped board which groaned and creaked loud enough for the entire library to hear in the silence . 
  i nearly lost it at that point . 
  he can , and that would account for some amount of time being spent together . 
  but for mere insight , you do n't require ** more ** time than that spent by every other pair of transitioning presidents . 
  ~ ~ literally , bee-hooves . ~ ~ edit : were you asking for how to use it ? 
  b/c that i ca n't tell you for sure : <, 
  a hipster looking bloke said it next to me in a meeting a week back while steepling his fingers and i had to bite my cheeks to keep the giggles in, 
  we met up after she 'd been at drinks with a work mate . 
  she was tipsy , but we were just talking normally about family and stuff . 
  she mentions that several family members have been in prison . 
  i brushed it off , it 's not her fault . 
  then she tells me about her cousins , who she adores , and who are super overprotective of her and her sister . 
  `` oh you have a sister ? '', 
  which leads to the story where her parents worry if she gets home late because something happened to her sister last year . 
  she would n't say what it was , but the implication was that she got raped . 
  at this point , the overprotective cousins jumped back into it , and i was told they 'd been rearing to go beat up the guy who did it . 
  well after the prison bit , this was the final straw and i sorta noped out of there . 
   you can lead a horticulture , but you ca n't make her think . 
  dorothy parker . 
  it 's not strictly an overall favourite , but as far as word play goes , it 's top . 
  the benefits of not releasing your bird next to a highway like a fucking dipshit . 
  oh this one was , but that part of it still sunk . 
  if i was told tomorrow that i could give everyone in the world one game to play forever , and destroy all others , i 'd give them 1942 . 
  so much fun . 
  1942 had waaay better vehicle viewing than any other bf game . 
  you could look behind , forward , first person , flybuy , and it was so much easier to spot enemy planes with . 
  it 's the b flag on midway island , facing south from the hill above the channel . 
  behind him is a channel , and then a rise up to a flat plateau covered in trees . 
  to his left is a bridge , then a gully between two hills , then the airfield . 
  it 's a very recognisable point in battlefield , and the difference you 're pointing out is the sheer detail in battlefield 1 . 
  1942 looks exactly like that screenshot in gameplay . 
  amazing how they investigated him and decided that detonating a suicide vest at a sports game * was n't * terrorism . 
  wonder why that would be . 
  ah , yes , desert combat . 
  unpopular opinion , but i never liked that . 
  is n't this a positive fact , rather than a negative one ? 
  eap is n't an alcoholic , and someone else was the dick !, 
  this just sounds like your boss wanted profits over people if he was n't even providing healthcare beforehand . 
  this is a good point but whenever i see something like this i 'm reminded of the news article from last year where a couple lost their kids to cps because they let them walk home from school unsupervised . 
  the kids were 10 and younger i think , and the cops picked them up bc some lady called to say they were neglected . 
  blaming bosses might lead to a change in the culture of employment and business that results in healthcare being offered as a part of a job . 
  i might be wrong , but if a business already offered their employees healthcare , they were n't affected by obamacare , were they ? 
  i 'm a die hard lefty and i think that if you 're dumb enough to pay money for a voucher , you deserve to get screwed . 
  you probably should n't gloss over the bits in the bible that have similar sentiments then . 
  there 's a bit of dodgy stuff in the new testament too . 
  but yes , they generally try to pass the old off as jewish and not valid . 
  it 's a bit hard to do that when many christians continue to be circumcised and the ten commandments are taught in christian schools . 
  but then of course there are jesus ' golden commandments from the gospels , and those override the ten , buuut that 's got the whole do unto others bit which does n't really gel with hating non-believers . 
  thinking about the way water reacts to cum , and then thinking about a dishwasher throwing water around ... 
  i do n't think i 'd want to go there ? 
  lmao , i remember that , and he absolutely says `` fucking _____ '' while barnes is within hearing range . 
  fucked if i know what the second word was , but if you 're a captain that 's been warned , then you deserve a red if you 're going to mouth off . 
  as for what / u/pm _ me_dog_pictures says , ashton started that mess , so of course he got a card . 
  tuilagi should have been red carded though . 
  watch the tuilagi tackle @ 0.5 speed , and watch ashton 's shoulder . 
  you can see tuilagi make contact with ashton 's upper arm , and tuilagi 's arm wraps ashton 's chest . 
  ashton 's shoulder is visible * above * tuilagi 's arm - it 's a perfectly safe contact . 
  nothing high about it . 
  in fact , here 's a screenshot from the video of [ just before full contact ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1zbe8h5.png ) and here 's one of [ just after ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sr6nisn.png ) . 
  neither is high . 
  ashton then gets up , pushes tuilagi in the back just below the neck ( which any kid can tell you is a very , very , uncomfortable feeling because it jerks your head around and ashton is a strong bloke ) , then tuilagi lets loose . 
  so to recap , it was n't high , but ashton started something over it , then tuilagi said fuck it , i 'm not taking that . 
  fair enough in my book . 
  was n't high ( see my other comment ) , and tuilagi could n't see it was off the ball . 
  ashton was receiving a pass , and tuilagi came at him from the other side , so would n't have seen that the ball was knocked down by his teammate while tacking the passer . 
  and that little shove was on a sitting down player , in the back of the neck . 
  we call that whiplash when it happens in a car . 
  my mum always used to say `` people remember the bad things '' , and used it to remind me to be kind and behave myself . 
  the thing is , we all ( internet users since youth ) know about desensitisation , and we also know that people do remember the bad things about other people ( think of all those careers ruined over one tiny thing ) . 
  but in a way that could be because maybe there 's so much good in the world , it takes something exceptional to register , but there 's not as much bad , so the truly bad things stick around longer . 
  this would also explain why everyone forgets that steve buscemi was a firefighter on 9/11, 
  i said it deserved a red card , did n't i ? 
  it 's fair enough that he reacted , but he copped a punishment as he should . 
  that shove was n't mild at all . 
  base of the neck ( whiplash ) , to a sitting player ( cowardly + less resistance for tuilagi ) . 
  but of course , you did n't even watch the video , or look at the screencaps which clearly show that he was below the shoulder ** which makes it a fair tackle ** . 
  as opposed to letting them ferment hate and gain followers ? 
  unfortunately we have to take actions sometimes that we do n't like . 
  ban a hate group . 
  restrict their free speech . 
  the people who do n't mind sending in the special forces to kill a terrorist leader seem to object to telling racist whackjobs to shut up . 
  free speech should n't infringe on the rights of others - to safety , to freely practise religion , to live in a country they 're legally permitted to live in .
