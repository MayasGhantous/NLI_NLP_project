  but at home , the audiences at the first anzac days ( for they were already occurring by 1916 ) `` heard not about failure but success '' . 
  while gallipoli had not been a successful military campaign , it did show that qualities inherent to the people of britain such as `` valour , resource and tenacity '' were present in the new zealand population . 
  the anglican bishop of auckland claimed that the casualties had `` proved the worthiness of the nation to take it 's place in the great family of free nations in the empire '' . 
  gallipoli and the anzac movements were a source of great pride for new zealanders , because it was the coming of age of the colony . 
  it was a proving ground to show they belonged to the empire , and the fact that their troops acquitted themselves well was a sign that they did belong . 
  at the treaty of versailles , new zealand signed as a member of the empire . 
  they governed western samoa for a period of time , and they also got a place at the league of nations . 
  wwi , and gallipoli especially , were seen as the coming of age of new zealand as a member of the empire . 
  it was the time when new zealanders could feel they belonged , and deserved to belong , as a branch of the british nation .

  supposedly it was a metal only mined on atlantis , and second in value to gold . 
  today it 's thought to have been an alloy of zinc , copper , and one or two other metals . 
  i 'm guessing the atlantis bit is the part which makes it so crazy interesting though . 
  on the contrary , it is a brilliant tactic , and one which had served many military commanders beforehand , including the khans in mongolia , and the romans . 
  the corps system allowed for the army to be subdivided into smaller units , so that orders passing down the chain of command would reach the ranks quicker , with no loss of clarity . 
  imagine for example , if you have 10,000 men in your army , divided into 5 groups of 2,000 . 
  if you give the order to engage , 2,000 men will be asked to move as one , and will be looking to their commander for orders . 
  if however , you have further decentralized command , then the order will pass down quicker and more fluidly . 
  rather than having 2,000 men trying to fall back when you might only need a quarter of that number to do so , you can have individual companies pulling back as one , and bolstering the defence elsewhere . 
  it also allowed for greater maneuverability pre-battle . 
  an army could be divided up into smaller groups with those groups sent in multiple directions , * immediately * . 
  if you have no system in place that has your men divided as such , it 's going to take a long time for your men to divide themselves into several similar sized groups . 
  having the corps system transformed napoleon 's army from a lumbering mass of men , into a fluid and dynamic collection of companies , allowed for more precise movements and control . 
  edit : this higher level of control allowed napoleon to split his army so that they might advance quicker , while maintaining relative closeness in the event of meeting an opponent . 
  by splitting , they could also maneuver sections of the army to reinforce other sections , making one flank stronger and more resistant to attack in a matter of minutes . 
  in the old style armies , this was impossible . 
  perhaps the best part of the new movements was the ability to lock down an enemy army , by engaging with one portion of the army , while the rest came up in reserve . 
  this allowed engagements to happen quickly , speeding up warfare and locking enemy forces into position . 
  thanks for that !, 
  i only parroted what 's appearing on news sites , as they 're the ones making it a big deal . 
  it was n't necessarily the size of the armies , so much as it was those divisions . 
  [ here 's an essay ] ( http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/c_armycorps.html ) i found while looking for clarification on a point . 
  if you look in the third paragraph , he makes reference to the difference between napoleon 's armies and those of frederick :, 
   napoleonic warfare was characterized by '' ... its limitless variation and flexibility . '', 
  napoleonic warfare was quick and bloody , and sought a decisive engagement . 
  napoleon 's army dispersed to move along separate routes and concentrated to fight . 
  by contrast , the description of previous armies is quite ugly :, 
   an army had no sub-structure higher than the regiment and was therefore a pondering beast that generally moved along one route [ ... ] supplying this type of army required huge depots , which tended to keep the army on a `` short leash '' from its supply base . 
  monarchs were not willing to let these armies live off the land , and [ ... ] it was impractical since a single route may not have sufficient food stuffs, 
  the mongols , who also split their forces up when needed were able to graze thousands of horses in this way . 
  a well fed army has higher morale , and is more ready to fight . 
  the previous generation 's method of organisation was a good defensive choice , but it restricted the offensive capabilities . 
  a napoleonic army , or a mongol one , could harass an enemy army and eventually choose the battlefield itself , rather than leaving it to chance , and/or the enemy . 
  do you have a link with this in it ? 
  it 'd be more helpful to see where the writer was coming from . 
  from my knowledge , pakeha new zealanders at this point very much viewed themselves as british , as i said , and this did n't change until the years around the second world war . 
  gallipoli did sow distrust of british military structure , as the losses there were catastrophic and the australian and new zealand troops had been commanded by a british general . 
  the change in attitude towards britain and the empire came later , as japan entered the war in the pacific , while the uk was boxed in in europe , unable to help . 
  consequently , new zealand and australia looked to america for aid . 
  in new zealand , it 's seen as a bird leaving the nest period , as new zealand became a pacific nation separate from the empire , because britain had been unable to help . 
  i suppose in some ways it was also a time when the united states was seen as a replacement in some ways , but that 's more speculative on my part , and anyway , it did n't last long . 
  in short : it was great . 
  literally . 
  the expansion of islam happened so quickly , that quite often the muslim rulers were minorities in their newly conquered territories . 
  to make their position safer , they had the pact of umar , a document of islamic law that governed the behaviour of * dhimmi * , which translates to `` people of the book '' , meaning jews and christians . 
  the laws of the pact were strict , but they were not created to enforce religious discrimination . 
  rather , they were there to maintain a social hierarchy , and therefore the rules were not applied equally throughout the muslim world , but instead were adapted to suit the communities in which it was enforced . 
  this meant that in places with a strong muslim presence , like egypt , christians and jews were often prohibited from practicing their religion in public , or repairing religious buildings , like churches and temples . 
  they were not allowed to evangelise to muslims , or display crosses or bibles . 
  even in places like egypt , these rules were not necessarily enforced . 
  in one instance , a jewish funeral procession in egypt was attacked by muslims , and the caliph , rather than imprisoning or killing the jews who had breeched the pact , pardoned them . 
  this action suggests that the importance of the pact was in keeping the peace between the muslims and other groups . 
  in spain , this was especially true . 
  muslim spain was surrounded by christian regions . 
  [ this map shows ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/califato_de_c%c3%b3rdoba_-_1000.svg/686px-califato_de_c%c3%b3rdoba_-_1000.svg.png ) the various christian territories in spain during the time of the cordoban caliphate . 
  the pyrenees are all that separates france from spain , and beyond that lies the rest of europe , all christian . 
  the various muslim rulers there worked to keep the community peaceful , so that the christian kings beyond their borders would n't be incited to invade . 
  one of the prohibitions of the pact of umar was that the * dhimmi * could not hold government positions , yet in spain this rule was largely ignored . 
  in the case of the cordoban caliphate , it was recognised that those best suited to run the local government , were the locals . 
  at the same time , there was the tax applied to all * dhimmi * , called the * jizya * . 
  it was an annual tax for the * dhimmi * to pay to their muslim rulers . 
  it was paid as usual in spain , however , it was largely offset by the economic benefits brought to spain by the muslims . 
  the ruling class demanded luxurious goods unavailable in spain , and when they were imported , anyone could purchase them . 
  this was because muslim traders could n't go via european ports , while jews could pass freely through the mediterranean harbours from east to west and vice versa . 
  the caliphate 's demand for these luxuries meant that the jewish merchants prospered by importing the desired goods , and the christians and jews of spain gained access to them . 
  religious freedom was also recognised , both to appease the christian rulers surrounding spain and because there were more important matters . 
  the royal court required translators to transcribe texts from muslim and european lands . 
  in this , choice was limited and religious persuasions were put aside in favour of intellectual prowess . 
  these decisions by the muslim rulers meant that the pact of umar was largely swept aside in favour of a more culturally and economically successful territory . 
  and this tolerance of jews and christians was indeed profitable - the portions of the spanish peninsula under muslim rule flourished , with learning , culture , and the economy booming during their rule .
