  di was royalty who connected with the people at a time when royalty was n't all that great . 
  she reinvigorated interest in the royals , and when she got divorced by charles , there was even more empathy for her . 
  she was beautiful , she was kind , she put tremendous effort into charitable works . 
  just take a look at her friends - people like elton john , an openly gay man during the aids crisis . 
  she was someone who was in touch with issues that regular people faced , and that was new for a royal . 
  read the article . 
  what the actual fuck, 
  the most tattooed person i know is a lawyer . 
  i dated a girl who had n't had her natural hair colour in years but got into and went through business school . 
  i have a friend with multiple piercings and tattoos who works as a nanny to high income families ( the sort that pay for them to move their possessions and lives internationally ) , and another who 's equally pierced who is completing a science degree while holding down three jobs within that field . 
  this is 2016 , not 1916 . 
  people who look like that are normal and successful . 
  do we have a biggest dickhead category ? 
  we could call it the ` most australian ' or something . 
  lmao , wtf is wrong with feminism ? 
  people do n't understand it b/c of jokes . 
  which means that people fear it . 
  chill out ** s ** on , if they make the ** p ** lay ** o ** ffs they 're bl ** o ** wing another 12 year landmar ** k ** , do ** y ** ou want that ? 
  that 's the difference between you , who has bipolar disorder , and me , who does n't , making jokes . 
  if you make a joke , it 's coming from a place of understanding . 
  if i do it , it 's because i think of bipolar as a swingset and do n't know anymore about it than that . 
  it 's the same reason i 'm not going to tell a joke about chinese people , but i 'll laugh at my chinese friend 's joke about chinese people - she knows and understands what she 's saying as it relates to chinese culture , whereas i do n't have a clue what i 'm saying . 
  so ... women = subservient to men ? 
  i tried this but when i played unranked i just got matched with the bots with the 16 character random hash usernames . 
  i play online to play with people , not computers . 
  actually , it shows that they thought the jews would n't survive the trip ( `` succumb to its harsh conditions '' ) - they just wanted to try end the jewish race somewhere other than their own backyard first . 
  pancreatic cancer is rarely diagnosed early , and even when it is , carries a high mortality rate . 
  i wo n't judge anyone who chooses to fight it in a different way , or even try and make their last few days/weeks/months peaceful . 
  honestly , i thought the dude was just annoying because he left one team for another to try win . 
  it seemed like that mattered more than the team ? 
  it 's not exactly logical , but as a sportsfan , i thought it was a bit of a dick move . 
  this is some new level of spin . 
  by the same logic , you do n't need your agi/str/int stats constantly displayed . 
  on their own they 're useless . 
  what you need is damage , attack speed , and armour . 
  what are those situations ? 
  i 've seen replies asking `` do you ever play against [ insert hero ] '' , but i do n't see the significance . 
  i check player stats constantly throughout the game , not just in the few seconds before i start a fight with them . 
  for that , i do n't need to have every last bit of information displayed , just the pertinent details . 
  fair call , i was n't a huge basketball fan back then , that was just the perception i had of the situation at the time . 
  actually , if you read my original comment , i used ` thought ' which is the past tense of ` think ' which suggests that what i was referring to was a previous idea . 
  so how about you fuck off and learn to read ? 
  i do actually !, 
  but you saying it 's important does n't change my opinion that it 's not really . 
  you need to give a reason . 
  like i said in my other reply , i check stats throughout the game , so i do n't need them immediately visible before an engagement . 
  what , checking throughout the game at moments when nothing else is happening ? 
  my solution was the reason that i do n't see a need for str/agi/int to be permanently displayed . 
  i only see a need for movespeed , armour , attack speed , and damage . 
  what / u/raxnbury is saying is that in a lot of markets at the minute , there are a shortage of houses available for first time buyers while property investors have portfolios worth tens of millions . 
  the outcome is that a house which should sell for ~ 900,000 is instead selling for 1.3 m or more , because demand is so high and supply is so low . 
  and the only reason property investors can afford so much is that they have tens of properties to leverage for mortgages , whereas first buyers usually only have a deposit . 
   i 'm not about to explain how i know it was fake , because i 'm not going to give anyone any info on how to fake a seizure, 
  is the first clue that they 're convulsing and still opening their eyes to see if you buy it ? 
  would n't that cut into the continuity of your intense gaming sessions ? 
   there have been no purging of dissent . 
  obama was still president in 2016 , so this has no relevance . 
  but he also locked up more whistleblowers than any other president . 
  ok here 's the funny thing about race in the us : it 's bullshit . 
  mexicans are still a different ethnic group , and still bear the brunt of racism in states where they live in large numbers . 
  this is the exact ignorant attitude that this sort of article is trying to fight . 
  not all homeless people have mental illness or substance abuse issues . 
  some do , yes , but their problems are exacerbated by a lack of aid which if they had jobs , they could access . 
  others are homeless because in the current economic situations of their regions , they just could n't afford to live . 
  those people are capable workers who are homeless through misfortune . 
  in both cases , giving a homeless person a job is getting you labour , and giving someone the opportunity to get out of a rut . 
  that old conservative adage about pulling yourself up by your bootstraps ? 
  it does n't work if you do n't give them a bootstrap . 
  nah , i meant because you 'd be eating that much taco bell that you 'd be shitting your insides out for a bit . 
  also credit cards at a fast food restaurant is such a weird aspect of american culture . 
   each comp game takes around an hour, 
  surprisingly , csgo also has a casual mode , where people click play to have a quick 5min run and end up staying for 10 maps . 
   some do , yes , but their problems are exacerbated by a lack of aid which if they had jobs , they could access . 
  jobs = wages = pay for therapy , or healthcare . 
  some jobs give health insurance . 
  the op snarkily labels this `` ground breaking journalism '' but in reality a lot of people think homeless people are homeless b/c they 're lazy and do n't want to work . 
  this sort of article is needed to show that that 's just a lie propagated to prevent people from needing to use their empathy . 
  this is n't a question but rather a bit of advice for anyone who comes through here wondering if they should apply : do it . 
  i signed up to reddit purely because of this sub . 
  my sole intention was to get flaired , because i like history and thought it was a cool idea that the community here had put together . 
  my first application did n't feature enough specialty , so i was given advice on fixing it . 
  i got flaired a few weeks later . 
  so do it . 
  take the chance , and you might find out you 're not as far off as you think . 
  sure . 
  [ here 's one from the guardian ( a liberal bias paper ) . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/16/whistleblowers-double-standard-obama-david-petraeus-chelsea-manning ), 
  i think that credit card usage in the united states is enormously different to outside the states ( although it could be similar in east asia and europe ) . 
  i 'm in new zealand , and a lot of places where we 'd buy food and drinks do n't accept credit cards . 
  we use eftpos ( debit cards ) which are linked to your bank account , so you can only spend what you have . 
  going into debt and incurring interest on something like a taco or a burger is just inane to me . 
  sorry , i guess i meant using credit to pay for something when you have the money readily available . 
  i have a credit card and i use it in an emergency only , but i use my debit card for everything else . 
  i collect airpoints on my eftpos card because eftpos is the major service for electronic purchases in nz and australia , so we get those rewards offered on debit too . 
  the other thing would be cheques : i have n't seen a cheque since a birthday gift in about 2005 . 
  we just do n't use them . 
  tbh , people could just raise their kids right too . 
  i never worked retail , but i always return stuff to the shelf , or if it 's folded clothing , to the worker . 
  difference between 2m ^ 2 and 2 square metres ? 
  63 million people in your country , or 19.7 % of the population , just voted for two men who believe that people who choose their own health over that of a fetus are going to hell .
