  they voted for a presidential ticket that incited violence towards people based on their political choice . 
  they voted for a presidential ticket that promised to make the country muslim free , and , regardless of whether or not he intended to do it , they did n't think `` oh hang on , that 's wrong '' - they did it . 
  so before you get uppity about 20 % of fanatics that think stoning adulterers is ok , how about you consider that america has just as many fucked up thinkers . 
  how about we do a fair comparison , rather than for two different ` sins ' ? 
  if we 're looking at the criminal justice system , america hands out life sentences for non-violent drug crimes . 
  america executes people who are mentally unfit to be executed . 
  as for morally reprehensible , how is it more reprehensible to cut someone 's hand off for a crime they committed , knowing the repercussions , than it is to force a woman to bear a child against her will ? 
  women die in childbirth . 
  they undergo significant trauma to their bodies in giving birth , and to their mental health . 
  you 'd need a roll for your arse and a roll for the water with that toilet . 
  that 's not racial profiling though . 
  that 's looking at a high volume tourist group and saying `` oh hey , these guys like to drink a lot and cause issues . '', 
  racial profiling would be if you saw thirty aussies come through with alcohol and start causing shit , and then every single white person who ever came to the country again was automatically assumed to be a drunk and violent reveller . 
  deciding that all men who look north african are rapists is racist as fuck because there 's no science to that . 
  we know that race is not a sound scientific concept , and that it does not define the behaviours or attributes of an individual . 
  you might not be a misogynist , but you sure as fuck are jumping through a lot of hoops to defend racism . 
  someone referred to howick as chowick in a conversation last year , and i corrected her thinking she was just misinformed . 
  she said `` nah , chowick , because . . you know '' and then she pulled her eyes tight with her fingers like a kid . 
  she was in her 40s . 
  jesus , the level of nit picking here . 
  everyone knew she was white and her boyfriend was black . 
  she gave ethnic groups instead of race , because one is more correct than the other . 
   i once had to track down an event that only happened under certain circumstances and after 10 million repeats, 
   took anyone 2 minutes in game to notice them, 
  holy balls you 're stupid . 
  a dev team finding something or ** millions of players ** finding something when they all load the game up at once to try out the cool new patch ? 
  you sound like a passive aggressive teenage boy with this comment . 
  have you considered that maybe they found a serious vulnerability ? 
  or a hack that would severely impact our playing experience ? 
  have you considered that a 24 hour downtime could be 24 hours of working frantically to fix a problem , and that the pr person is out of the office for the week since it 's christmas ? 
  stop being so emotional and reactionary . 
  shit happens , and clearly it 's happening at valve right now . 
   the person who complimented them was banned for ` deadnaming ' someone . 
  because they called someone by their publicly visible online handle . 
  actually they called them by a shortened version of that handle , which was the name that person used before they transitioned . 
  it seems extreme to ban someone for that , i agree , but given that this person had come out about their gender identity in a society that is not all that accepting of transgender people ( hurr there 's only two genders and you 're mentally ill !!, 
  ) , they had a fair expectation in that safespace to not be respected for their choice , which includes being called james now instead of jessica ( as an example ) . 
  now , maybe they should n't have had a screen name that could be shortened to the original , or maybe there 's a part of the story you 've skipped over , but that was n't the toxicity of a safespace . 
  that was just a bit of respect and some misunderstanding . 
  are you completely bloody braindead or are you just trying to troll people ? 
  overpowered weapons are n't bugs , they 're balancing issues . 
  you do n't take the servers down for 24 hours because there 's a balancing issue with a gun you oxygen deprived goon . 
  you do take the servers down because of a bug that causes people or servers to crash , or leaves people vulnerable to cyber attacks , or any other number of things which are n't game features . 
  stop being so god damned asinine and entitled and let them fix it . 
  i 'd love to see how you handle a crisis if your first response is to attack the people sorting it out . 
  exactly . 
  and changing some code could fuck up everything else , which means a new work around . 
  not to mention the scale of the problem - we do n't know it . 
  the comment by hazuman which i was replying to specifically mentioned bugs :, 
   how about all the times they shipped updates with game-breaking ** bugs **, 
  the comment hazuman replied to , by / u/adakar , also referenced bugs , because a 1 in 10,000,000 event is a bug , not a feature . 
   i once had to track down an event that only happened under certain circumstances and after 10 million repeats, 
  then the parent to that comment is arya35 who said valve was waiting for a community member to reproduce ` it ' ( ` it ' = bug ) . 
   they 're probably waiting for some community member to find a way to reproduce it ,, 
  then the parent to * that * comment talked about three year old bugs . 
   we get glove cases , yet we have bugs that are 3 + years old and unfixed . 
  then we 're in a thread talking about a long downtime , which also is a bug . 
  so i guess maybe you should read the thread , then read the comments in context to the ones they reply to , and you might actually be able comprehend what people are talking about . 
  that 's how oxygen deprived i am . 
  so little oxygen that i have enough time to read what i 'm talking about . 
  which reminds me , why do n't you know how to use `` quote marks '' properly ? 
  not less pc ... just less correct . 
  black/white/african are all pc terms . 
  but human races - black , white , american , asian - are all discredited under science . 
  the only reason people still use them is because they like to categorise things ( i do too ) . 
  but in this story , it was pretty clear . 
  * her boyfriend spoke swahili - he has local connections . 
  * she would n't go there alone without him again - she 's the outsider . 
  * the question is `` most racist encounter '' - if they understood the problem because her bf spoke swahili , then it 's locals posing the threat . 
  it 's not racist if it 's kenyans discussing kenyans . 
  i can see how people did n't understand the story on a first read through , but i do n't get why everyone suddenly was like `` oh they were black were n't they !, 
  were you white ? '', 
  because that just screams `` black men are a threat to white women '' and fuck that jazz, 
  so if you actually read my comment , you 'd know that i told you you need to read all the comments , and not to just cherry pick some . 
  what you did instead was skim read my comment , and then admit to skim reading , showing you have no idea what the fuck you 're talking about . 
  overwatch is in the first year of release still . 
  tf2 was out for years before it even began to morph into something that \\* some \\* people did n't like . 
  that 's literally what i just said . 
   deciding that all men who look north african are rapists, 
  they 're going to a specific locale and saying `` you 're black , over here . 
  you 're white , get out . 
  you 're asian , you 're good . 
  hey you 're moroccan come over here . '', 
  racial profiling is racial profiling regardless of whether it 's in a classroom , a theatre , a city , or a country . 
  size does n't matter . 
  and that very specific group of people were n't doing their `` very specific behaviour '' - they just turned up and * immediately * got pulled aside . 
  there 's no presumption of innocence for north african men , while everyone else was allowed through . 
  so , to summarise :, 
  thousands of men passed through . 
  north african men only were pulled aside for police inspection . 
  men of other nationalities were not . 
  my question is this : would you take offence at being called a rapist ? 
  you 're most likely not a rapist . 
  but the majority of rapists are men . 
  so if you 're walking down the street and a cop pulls you aside and says `` excuse me sir , we 'd like to check you '' and you asked why and were told it 's a precaution against rape , you 'd probably be quite confused , maybe even angry . 
  why 's it different for these men from north africa ? 
  / u/ridinthemonster did n't take your comment as an example of bad logic , but as an actual question . 
  is n't that st leonard 's bay ? 
  round the end of the rocks from where hauraki/clifton roads run down to takapuna beach ? 
  great pic though , it 's a real cool stretch of beach to go down .
