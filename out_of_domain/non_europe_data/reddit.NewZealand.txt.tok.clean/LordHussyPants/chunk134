  some of these would n't win any major book prizes , but i think they suit an introduction to reading if you 're enjoying the stories . 
  and anyway , if you only read prizewinners , you 're missing out . 
  have you read stieg larsson 's * girl with the dragon tattoo * ? 
  bernard knight writes a series ( crowner john novels ) of murder mysteries set in twelfth century england about a local crowner ( coroner ) . 
  conn iggulden 's series on caesar and genghis khan are both excellent . 
  john stack wrote a trilogy about the formation of the roman navy , and a greek sailor who leads it and goes from captaining one ship to being the master of the fleet . 
  it 's fantastic . 
  ken follett 's already been recommended , but i second it because you really would love it if history is what you 're after . 
  matthew reilly 's * seven ancient wonders * combines history and scifi with adventure - it 's not strictly an historical novel , but it pulls a lot of history into it . 
  why were you getting painkillers for a root canal ? 
  i 've had three and was never prescribed meds for after the procedure because if it 's done right , there 's no way you can feel pain from it . 
  tracer can if she has 2 or more blinks . 
  1 usually is n't enough to break the range . 
  her e will work too though, 
  hey dude , your english is really good . 
  it reads like someone typing something in a hurry , which is half of reddit anyway . 
  do n't be disheartened by bad talk . 
  which is really stupid because the sidebar also has a list of narcissistic traits , as well as a `` please assume a context of abuse '' rule which is absolutely wrong when people go and post in there `` my mum made me eat my broccoli before my cheesecake and god it ruined me ! '', 
  ya , i know . 
  i had a comment deleted because i pointed out that a 90 year old man in a retirement home telling his daughter he did n't like the food there and asking her to bring a sandwich was less narcissistic than he was maybe hoping for a daughter who gave a fuck about him in his old age . 
  ok but not ** all chemists ** want to turn metal into gold, 
  we do , but it 's often cheaper from overseas . 
  we do n't have same day delivery either except for one e-store i can think of , and they charge for it anyway . 
  because we have 4 million people , and nowhere near the demand for it . 
  amazon wo n't ever put a warehouse in auckland because it 's just not economically viable . 
  a guy i used to game with this guy who lived in australia . 
  i knew him from about 2007 onwards , and he was this guy who 'd tried all types of fun drugs , loved 4chan , and was just a classic internet persona who was in touch with the most horrid aspects of the net , and the funniest . 
  he was also a volunteer firefighter , and in 2009 , he was out on black saturday . 
  this guy who could make depraved jokes that would make anyone cringe , and was the life of the servers , had never been as serious as when that day came up later . 
  he was n't even near the worst of it from memory . 
  but his stories were insane . 
  so much respect for firefighters , because wild or urban , that shit takes massive balls , and i think tremendous selflessness to go out and try to save the worlds of other people while risking your own . 
  i think it 's really funny how i play tracer for an entire game and get four golds and people complain that the fucking tracer did n't swap on defense and lost it for us, 
  i also think it 's really funny that i play tracer for an entire game and get four silvers and people complain that the fucking tracer did n't get gold elims so we lost, 
  are medals important or are people just upset that the tiny little dps hero outscores you all, 
  it was a [ bad apparently ] alchemist pun, 
  \\* entry \\*, 
  it 'd be nice to have a spare keyboard for when the meis get too much and i smash this one, 
  portland is also close to lots of other cities , like seattle as you pointed out , which makes transport of goods nice and easy . 
  new zealand is two islands , three hours flight from the nearest landmass , which is also an island . 
  we 'd need container ships constantly coming through with stock for the warehouse . 
  portland is also an expansion of the american market , whereas auckland would be a whole new market . 
  it does n't make sense to open up a new warehouse to service 4 million people like it does to open a new warehouse in portland to expand service to 1 million and reinforce the idea of amazon prime being awesome . 
  any losses in portland are covered by other regions , but losses in auckland are covered by what ? 
  america ? 
  why bother . 
  like i said in another comment , we 're so small that it 's easy to just go buy everything we need locally . 
  it 's a 10min drive for me to buy pretty much anything i would get off amazon , and amazon would have to compete with all that . 
  i mean , 40 years is still lost . 
  unless 41 is a magical number where suddenly things stop being misplaced and become lost . 
  as someone who 's firmly anti-cop in these cases most of the time , i think even an open grand jury is too far because it changes the process for police officers too much from that of a regular citizen . 
  best would be a special prosecutor who is immune to influence ( i.e. 
  doens ' t work in that district with that police force ) . 
  because in the end , all a grand jury is is convincing people that there 's a chance the officer could be convicted . 
  and we know that in some areas , grand juries will send someone to trial for no reason at all , so it can be the same for cops . 
  i love how in the middle of that video , one guy turns round to look at the hammer swinging guy in an almost accusing way ... as if he 's not part of all this ? 
  i think obama probably has that calmness in part because he 's a black man in america . 
  if he 's not calm , he becomes the angry black man , the violent black man . 
  which does n't work when you 're a lawyer . 
  or a community organiser . 
  you need to keep your cool at the right time . 
  he 's had to learn to deal with racism , bigotry , condescension throughout his life , and the presidency was just more of the same except someone flicked a magnifying glass over the top . 
  trump on the other hand , has never had to deal with that . 
  a businessman . 
  he 's part of a culture where the bigger you are , the scarier and more powerful you are . 
  he 's a sledgehammer , and while that lack of subtlety might have played well in the business world , it wo n't in the political world unless he tailors it to fit . 
  lbj was massively intimidating , but he was n't foolish . 
  he did n't have tantrums . 
  lol no , that 's called rich people alcoholism . 
  you 're an alcoholic if you 're dependent on alcohol . 
  if you can be drunk 24/7 and it does n't impact your life , you 're still an alcoholic if you ca n't stop it . 
  you 're just a functional alcoholic . 
  your definition means that the guy who pulls down $ 10mil a year is n't an alcoholic because he can still throw money at problems to solve them , but the guy who makes $ 10k a year is one because he ca n't throw money . 
  but a bit of the racism tho too right, 
  right guys, 
  how come when hillary says she wants a no fly zone , every trump supporter takes her at face value, 
  but when trump says he wants to ban all muslims , build a wall with mexico , and repeal healthcare , trump supporters say `` he does n't mean that '', 
  but then hillary says something else and she 's crooked lying dishonest hillary clinton who did lying stuff with emails, 
  but we were supposed to take her threat of a no fly zone at face value ( which means she 's honest ! ), 
  and ignore trump 's rhetoric ( which means he 's lying ! ), 
  ever seen someone capture a burned out village ? 
  people love to bring up necklacing in south africa , and i really ca n't figure out why since it was condemned by the anc , who were the main anti-apartheid group . 
  but i guess when someone 's protesting something , you better bring up everything that people similar to them do . 
  like black lives matter and black on black crime . 
  difference is that china does n't threaten the safety of the united states , whereas russia is allied with countries that would like to see israel wiped off the map . 
  saving poor people is n't a success if you 're a republican lawmaker . 
  i still do n't understand what 's wrong with speeches . 
  should intelligent people not share knowledge ? 
  how is this a problem ? 
  reddit complains about the no tolerance policy and kids getting suspended for being hit by a bully with no action themselves . 
  but when a teacher hits a student for mouthing off , the student should be suspended ? 
  fuck that . 
  the teacher is in a position of authority , entrusted with the care of the students , and there is ** no excuse ** for assaulting a student on the basis of a verbal insult . 
  this is n't the root of a problem , this is a fucking solution to a teacher who apparently lacks the ability to deal with her emotions . 
  if the husband died the day before , then this is a problem with employment practices and the inability of employees to take time off work . 
  and regardless , that was a fucking child . 
  under 18 , that student was a child , and children can not be held wholly responsible for their actions because they are not fully developed - they 're still learning . 
  that 's why it 's even more wrong for an educator to hit someone . 
  the kid should have been ejected from the classroom , and detentions or a suspension . 
  the teacher hitting the child erases all of that .
