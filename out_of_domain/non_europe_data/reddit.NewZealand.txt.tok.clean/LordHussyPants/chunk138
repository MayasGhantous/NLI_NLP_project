   while she missed the presidency , she arrived just in time to show  us all , in unflinching terms , the deep undercurrent of sexist  double standards in our society . 
   and in doing so , she taught generations of girls and women that  yes , you do matter and yes , you can do anything . 
   this is hillary clinton . 
  it is when you 're removing children who had no choice in the matter , came here years ago , and have been educated in the american schools , grown up in american neighbourhoods , and know no other life than an american life . 
  then you look at adults who came here years ago , and now run successful businesses , raise families , contribute to their communities , pay taxes , and serve in the american military in unjust wars . 
  not to mention , i 'm willing to bet that a lot of the shitty jobs that an unemployed natural-born white american would refuse to do - like cleaning toilets from 9pm to 1am , or picking fruit in the blazing hot sun in july in arizona - are jobs that illegal immigrants do . 
  and finally , these men and women are probably better citizens than trump ever was . 
  but not too much of a priority , because then you 'll end up on / r/raisedbynarcissists, 
   yet the way things are playing out is making me very uncomfortable . 
  this is the way a lot of people feel about trump being elected , about his racism and sexism being legitimised by voters , and about people like steve bannon and richard spencer being encouraged on public platforms . 
  steve bannon , a noted anti-semite and white supremacist is in the white house now . 
  as a major player . 
  richard spencer , a modern day nazi , was giving an interview to tv channels on the side of the street . 
  when did it come to this ? 
  when did it get to the point where people who are openly opposed to the existence of their fellow citizens were able to trot out their beliefs ? 
  i see a lot of people saying things about tolerance and tolerating the bad views of others , like spencer . 
  but that 's not how it works . 
  tolerance should never be unending , it needs to have a line . 
  take a look at the white house right now . 
  throughout that campaign , the trump team told lies , they screamed fake news , they discredited media who were reporting facts . 
  now they 're in , and they 've been there what , three days ? 
  sean spicer lied on day 1 . 
  straight away , he started lying about the inauguration attendance . 
  the lie was a small one , but it came from a huge position . 
  spicer is the press secretary for the white house - he 's the public voice of the executive branch . 
  and he used that voice to espouse lies . 
  so now , the lies of the trump campaign which could be brushed off because it was just a candidate , telling lies , he 's a private citizen , he 's nothing much - those are now the lies of the president of the united states . 
  those are now the lies of the government . 
  the government was actively policing reporting over a tiny issue . 
  but if they do it over that issue , they can do it next week over something bigger , and next month , over something bigger , and next year , and so on . 
  by being unendingly tolerant , these little lies of a private citizen who was a bit of a maniac , have become the lies of a president , of a government . 
  so to circle back to bannon & spencer , and specifically spencer , the new england nazi , we see the problem of tolerance . 
  because spencer used to do his alt-right shit in the shadows . 
  he held little conferences around the place , and wrote on his website in the dark corner of the web , where he advocated genocides and whatnot . 
  but he could n't do it openly . 
  because when you openly go out onto the streets and say `` i think we need to protect the white race from the blacks and the hispanics and the jews ( who run the world !, 
  ) '' , someone 's going to tell you to shut the fuck up , or hit you , or worse . 
  but when there 's been a presidential campaign with rhetoric like trump 's , the hipster hitlers of the world feel more comfortable , because * hey that guy talks like me sort of !, 
  fuck the muslims yeaa !, 
  * and that 's encouraging . 
  then he gets elected , and he 's got power , and that 's how you get richard spencer , the ` nazi before it was cool ... again ' on the side of a street nonchalantly chatting about his beliefs , and pepe the frog , and * being open about who he is * . 
  ** tl ; dr tolerance is a force for good , and it legitimises things , like gay marriage , but if it 's applied to other things it legitimises those too , like fascism . 
  do n't be tolerant of fascists . 
  punch them . 
  cc / u/kierik who said below, 
   but you must be tolerant of my intolerance but i will not tolerate your intolerance . 
   tpp was horseshit, 
  from what i can tell , it was horseshit for everyone outside of america . 
  that 's why every other country who was a party to it had huge protests over it . 
   smarmy gray globalist substance, 
  the world is global now . 
  there 's no way out of that . 
  so to further complicate things : is the moon the pimple like deformity on the right white circle , or is it the dark orb sitting to the right of the white circle ? 
  he also had strong support from the upper levels of british society , and quite a few supporters in american society . 
   in 1994 , then-rep . charles schumer ( d-n.y. ) , now a member of senate leadership , had his staff survey 16 insurance companies . 
  he found that eight would not write health , life or disability policies for women who have been abused . 
  in 1995 , the boston globe found that nationwide , allstate , state farm , aetna , metropolitan life , the equitable companies , first colony life , the prudential and the principal financial group had all either canceled or denied coverage to women who 'd been beaten . 
  google 's not hard dude . 
  neither is decency . 
  ~ ~ her face , ~ ~ her whole head , literally twitches when she says alternative facts . 
  this twitter thread explains it better than i did , but the gist is that there are some things which * are not * up for debate in democratic societies , because by their very nature they go against the society itself . 
  i 'll repost all the tweets here ( edited some abbreviations to full words ) :, 
   i just finished a phd dissertation about `` reason '' in relation to the public sphere so with apologies i might risk a short thread regarding the punching of nazis because there is an unstated self-evident logic that i feel like might need clarifying . 
  feel free to mute or unfollow or w/e . 
   every liberal democracy realizes early on there are some positions which must prima facie be aggressively excluded from public discourse . 
   you ca n't even articulate why they are unreasonable because to articulate why they are unreasonable is to itself open the possibility of reason . 
   this is why you ca n't allow `` just hypothetical '' questions about whether jews or blacks , as spencer posits , are innately inferior/destroyable . 
   nazi theorists like carl schmitt very quickly diagnosed this weakness in liberal democracies . 
   you can collapse a democracy by insisting the democracy had a right to end itself : hindenburg to hitler , `` the peaceful transition of power . '', 
   intolerance can not be tolerated , because this corrosive effect means the law can be co-opted by , and so protective of , fascism . 
   ** fascism wriggles into democracies by insisting on the right to be heard ** , achieves critical mass , then dissolves the organs that installed it . 
   which means the stronger it becomes , it can not be sufficiently combatted with reason . 
  because `` reason '' becomes the state 's tool to enforce . 
   the overton window becomes weaponized - as we are seeing in @kellyannepolls and @seanspicer 's `` alternative facts . '', 
  the state decides . 
   liberalism literally can not see this - its insistence on rule of law , not genocidal lust , is what turned the german people into good nazis . 
   some positions must be excluded from discourse . 
  some positions you do not listen to - you can only punch . 
   a society that begins to entertain why some members of its polis might not belong invites catastrophic decay . 
  those voices must be excluded . 
   ** tl ; dr - punching a nazi is actually a supreme act of democracy bc it will not tolerate a direct affront of a fellow citizen 's citizenship . 
  if you give a nazi a voice , e.g. 
  richard spencer , stephen bannon , you 're saying that their words are not harmful enough to ban . 
  these are men who are saying that citizens of the united states are inferior and should not exist . 
  that sort of speech is indefensible . 
  did you read anything in the quoted text ? 
  that . 
  does n't . 
  work . 
  we had wwii because people gave fascists space to talk , and allowed them the chance to air their warts . 
  you 're literally giving the fascists everything they need by saying this . 
  hell , it 's even the bit i bolded out for you . 
  ** fascism wriggles into democracies by insisting on the right to be heard **, 
  here 's another way to think about it : if you claim the right to speech in a democratic society , then you can not use that speech to question the right of people in that society to exist . 
  a democratic society is founded on the people first and foremost . 
  without people , there is no society . 
  the safety of the people overrides the rights to speech . 
  oh my god the people laughing `` what was that ? 
  was that on purpose ? 
  haha idiot '',
