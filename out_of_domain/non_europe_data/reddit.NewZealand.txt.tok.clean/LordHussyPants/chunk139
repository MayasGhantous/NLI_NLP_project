  do your schools not supply old tests online ? 
  ours are all on the library site , and that has discontinued papers too, 
  that 's not tyrannical . 
  that 's preventing the tyrant . 
  in case you were wondering , it works : https://twitter.com/libcomorg/status/823650250036547584, 
  richard spencer put out a video telling his nazi friends that they need security to maintain their public movement . 
  when did this become ok ? 
  when did it become ok for people who advocate the end of the jewish ethnic group , the genocide of blacks , to be allowed to publically organise ? 
  they were ** scared to be public ** prior to the election , why should n't they still be scared ? 
  look , you seem really reasonable and all that . 
  but you 're defending the rights of a group of people who ask for the extermintation of 117 million people in the united states . 
  they advocate for the ethnic cleansing of the united states . 
  you 're defending nazis . 
  i do n't think dissenting political views should be banned . 
  i think it 's incredibly stupid to deny climate change , but go ahead . 
  i think you 're a moron if you do n't like vaccines , but sure , why not . 
  what i can not accept , and what i will not just tolerate , is people whose sole purpose is to destroy every ethnic group other than their own . 
  that 's ** not ** a political view . 
  that should ** not ** be protected speech . 
  the goal of the government is to protect the citizenry : allowing hate speech does not do that . 
  and lydia from breaking bad !, 
   it is that so long as their rhetoric stays right of the law ( the legal system does put some limits on free speech like threats , inciting violence or panic ), 
   they advocate for the ethnic cleansing of the united states, 
  ethnic cleansing = inciting violence, 
  fyi , the president of the united states just threatened martial law on a city via twitter , and said he would build a wall . 
  the national parks service is being censored by the white house . 
  at what point do you get to come down from your moral high ground and fight these things ? 
  guys , it 's only day 5 , let 's give him a chance :') / s, 
  i was going to respond , but you called me a fascist , which just goes to show you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  i never called for murder , or death to people . 
  as an afterthought , free speech is n't universal . 
  and the freedom of the speech is not unlimited . 
  you can not just say anything you want to say without consequence . 
  he 's not downplaying it . 
  he 's pointing out that trump is literally tweeting out plans he made up off of bill o'reilly . 
  trump is legitimately an armchair president right now . 
  it 's irish , which means he 's most likely a republican . 
  i think they 're good . 
  i think the major fear is that brexit will fuck things up . 
  if article 50 is invoked , northern ireland , as a member of the uk , will become a non-european union country and there wo n't be free passage between there and ireland . 
  that means borders , which reinforce the idea of division and could reignite conflict . 
  despite this , i believe the northern irish mps have confirmed they will vote for brexit , in spite of their constituents voting remain . 
  i do n't actually know what the timeline is to be honest . 
  i think that the british parliament votes in the next week or so on the bill to allow article 50 to be invoked . 
  northern ireland will be holding elections in march , so it seems unlikely from that point of view . 
  the other aspect is that i do n't know whether or not the northern ireland elections will affect the elections of northern irish representatives to westminster , if that makes sense . 
  i do n't know if those are part of the same system or not . 
  overall it 's a very interesting situation though . 
  martin mcguiness and sinn fein effectively torpedoed arlene foster ( the scandal hit one ) by resigning and god knows how it 'll turn out . 
  who do you know that is throwing out shirts missing a button lol, 
  so now the terrorists will turn up at border control waving a crucifix and trump will shake their hand and say `` come on in , you 're tremendous , the best religion ! '', 
  and then we 're back in the crusades . 
  i 'm sure the eu do n't want an open land border , because then anyone from the uk can walk into ireland and catch a flight from dublin . 
  vice versa , people could start operating immigrant tours from the eu to dublin , then bussing them over to belfast for a ferry ride to the mainland uk . 
  a hard border makes no sense given the history there and the ni parliament is right to fear it . 
  men with guns and a fence ? 
  even just a fence at the border ? 
  fuck knows what 'll go down , but i bet it wo n't be good . 
  looks like the english might be sacrificing ni for their own ~ ~ gain ~ ~ massive loss . 
  good old trump , already blocking foreigners from enjoying american goods . 
  this is n't an oddly selfish view at all . 
  is it possible to just have a tick box somewhere that i can click `` view old reddit style '' or something ? 
  just in case i ( or others ) dislike your new version . 
  huh , maybe he will make america great again, 
  new zealand has fpp until 1996 , and they were a 2 party system prior to that . 
  even when a third party got 20 % of the vote , they got no seats in parliament . 
  the major problem with the us imo is the separation of the vote for the presidency from the vote for the senate and congress . 
  in new zealand , the uk , australia , canada , the party with the most votes becomes the ruling party and their leader becomes pm . 
  in america , you just vote for your candidate , but it 's not linked at all to the senate race for example . 
  an alternative might be to abolish the presidential race , and just have votes for senate and congress . 
  the parties decide who their leader is , and then whichever party wins the vote , gets the president . 
  there are two immediate problems with this though : firstly , that it completely removes the illusion of democratically picking your president , because you 're not directly voting for him , but for the party ( even though that seems to be how most americans vote ?? 
  ) ; secondly , that it removes the separation between executive and legislative branches . 
  in other countries though , our leaders sit in the parliament , and have a vote . 
  in america , he sits separate , and has a veto . 
  quite odd . 
  in the interest of fairness , what was the amendment attached to ? 
  i 'm not sure what that 's about , but judging by the replies below , it seems like it was a fair vote by mccain ? 
  the vote sounds like it went against the laziness of the dod who were trying to save themselves some work by putting regulations from one service onto another . 
  mums need cash money too, 
  gah , she 's so adorably excited when she successfully lands a trick too . 
  ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ her ^ ^ ^ emails !, 
  i 'd put the kardashians in the white house before her any time . 
  have you noticed that most of the world is reeling at the fact that america elected donald trump ? 
  no one would give a shit if iceland elected him , or australia , or italy . 
  because america has influence , and this is a part of that . 
  we should make everyone work every possible day of the year and reduce annual leave to so that those small businesses get to stay afloat !, 
  it 's one day mate . 
  it 's not unreasonable at all . 
  it is absolutely horrifying that a man can ask someone with jewish heritage to take a picture with him , say `` hitler did nothing wrong . '', 
  and then make a police complaint for being pushed away . 
  this is 2017 . 
  america should be better than that . 
  oh come on , really ? 
  that 's how you 're going to argue this ? 
   looks at all the work the bush administration did for aid to africa . 
  yes , this was wonderful . 
  one of the most common things to hear a racists say so `` fuck off back to africa ! '', 
  you can help africans while disliking the black people in your own country . 
   one of , if not his most influential advisors was black ( condi rice ) .
