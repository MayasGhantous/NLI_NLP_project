  if that is n't enough , i 'd happily take one in asian history for my mongolian and japanese answers ... , 
  feedback appreciated though , i 'd rather be answering in a suitable manner across subjects than having flair in one . 
  i think the organisational structure was the revolutionary bit though . 
  the tactics were merely logical advances made through use of that structure . 
  the corps allowed everything to be done where before , none of it could be . 
  that was huge in european warfare . 
  i have however , updated the comment with more information . 
  conversion to islam from christianity in spain is uncertain . 
  we know that christians were converting , and in such numbers that it worried those christians opposed to islam . 
  the martyrs of cordoba were 48 christians who purposely broke the pact of umar and offended the muslim rulers so badly that they were executed . 
  the motives of each of the 48 individuals are uncertain , but it is definitely seen as an expression of christian faith , and by extension , as a protest of sorts against assimilation into muslim culture . 
  this is not to say that all christians were converting - some were of course , but many others merely adopted islamic practices with regard to food ( such as refraining from consumption of pork ) , and others . 
  this allowed them to retain their faith , but also be acceptable to the muslim population , and gain advancement . 
  an example of this was education : arabic was the language of the muslims , and many young christians learned it as it would ( naturally ) be helpful in this environment . 
  but other christians objected to them choosing arabic over or in addition to latin , as it was the muslims ' language . 
  christian sources recording the conversions make special note of young men converting , while not mentioning women . 
  this is possibly because the men were looking for social advancement , while women did not hold public posts ( like local government ) , and therefore would not benefit . 
  the source i 've linked is a bit earlier than the end of the muslim period , but it gives a good overview on conversion , particularly the * why * .

  jessica a. coope , [ religious and cultural conversion to islam in ninth-century umayyad cordoba ] ( http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/journals/jwh/jwh041p047.pdf ) . 
  that 'd be fine !, 
  can always change it later , right ? 
  no i have n't read him , but he 's the primary source that many articles cite . 
  he 's quite biased too , speaking from a christian point of view , but then again , everyone has biases . 
  the women converting within marriage is debatable . 
  generally muslims did n't marry non-muslims , and a woman would n't be expected to convert to islam by her husband if he was just putting on a facade of having converted . 
  she would likely just be pretending as well . 
  my mistake !, 
  i 've just looked at one of my books and it says `` the * dhimmi * were , in turn , the ` people of the book ' ( ahl al-kitab ) '' , which does n't lend itself to easy interpretation . 
  i got given a book called * the black russian * , by vladimir alexandrov , for christmas in 2013 . 
  been trying to get through it this last week , and it 's quite interesting . 
  it 's all about the son of ex-slaves in america who made his way to russia via most of the major european cities , and became one of the richest businessmen in moscow . 
  i also went hunting for books on irish history , but did n't find exactly what i wanted . 
  i did however , pick up these four :, 
  * peter bakewell , * a history of latin america *, 
  * thomas keneally , * the great shame *, 
  * daniel k. richter , * the ordeal of the longhouse *, 
  * richard storry , * a history of modern japan *, 
  i assume that the last one is probably a bit out of date , but that 's the perils of buying $ 2 books at op shops . 
  god damn spacemen , always dropping their rubbish there . 
   though there is wide disagreement among scholars about the origins and development of this covenant , it seems clear that the pact of umar was a composite statement that became central to the muslim legal structure in the early abbasid period . 
  this is the prevailing argument i 've heard for it , and it seems the most likely as it 's supported by the treatment of jews and christians around the muslim regions . 
  it 's accepted that it was n't written by umar . 
  it was a composite document , that came to be used in islamic law . 
  it still existed , it was still authentic , and it * was n't * a forgery . 
  it was misnamed , and possibly misrepresented as something written by umar , but neither of those things takes away the factual history of the document where it was applied to jewish and christian communities in muslim governed land . 
  ahh i see what you 're saying now . 
  i do n't think that the history of the document and its naming would have had any effect at all . 
  at the time , around the 10th-11th centuries , is when we have the earliest evidence of the pact . 
  this suggests that it was the people of this time period , or possibly the previous century , that had instituted these rules in the first place . 
  also , the rules were somewhat adapted by earlier pre-islamic tribal law , and later added to by muhammad . 
  that would support the composition theory . 
  realistically though , the unequal application of the pact comes down to environment . 
  you ca n't apply a harsh law against jews and christians in a country where you 're a minority ( e.g. 
  spain ) , like you can somewhere like iraq , where muslims were a definite majority . 
  it just does n't work out well if you want to maintain your conquest . 
  she really does n't look that stoked on her new role . 
  they are the oldest , and so have the longest histories in which to grow their prestige . 
  they were also exclusive . 
  for the first century or more of operation , the schools only admitted students who fit the criteria . 
  namely , that they were male , white , and wealthy . 
  women , people of colour , and poor white men , were all excluded from the universities . 
  harvard and w&m were both set up in the 17th century ( 1636 and 1693 are their respective founding dates ) , while yale and the university of pennsylvania were founded in the 18th century ( 1701 and 1755 ) . 
  in this time period , education was only given to a minimum level , and after that , further education was a pursuit of the wealthy . 
  i 'll look specifically at harvard , as it was the first university , and massachusetts was the first colony to enact compulsory educational legislation . 
  massachusetts was the first colony to pass a piece of legislation governing this , and theirs stated that the minimum requirement was to be able to read . 
  in their words , it was thus :, 
   and for this end they [ selectmen ] , or the greater part of them , shall have power to take account from time to time of their parents and masters , and of their children , concerning their calling and impliment of their children , especially of their ability to read and understand the principles of religion and the capital laws of the country, 
  the selectmen referenced were `` the chosen men of every town '' , which i am guessing refers to respected figures in the community . 
  they were given the right to check the literacy of the children , and if they were not up to standard , further measures including fines , and removal of the children into apprenticeships , could be taken . 
  it is interesting to note from the quoted passage of law that the reason was so that they could * `` understand the principles of religion and the capital laws of the country '' * , or in other words , be good christians and citizens . 
  the apprenticeships these children or young people were moved into were for skilled labour . 
  the purpose of the educational act above was to provide skilled labourers for the colony , as it was assumed that unskilled citizens would become paupers and be a greater burden on the state ( which was most likely true ) . 
  so we have here , for the most part , the citizens of the colony of massachusetts ( where harvard was situated ) , being educated to the level of being able to read , but no further , and then entering skilled apprenticeships . 
  harvard was the alternative here . 
  but who could go there ? 
  certainly not women , poor whites , or people of colour . 
  so it was left to the sons of the colony elite to attend . 
  these were men that came from families educated previously at institutions in the uk , like cambridge and oxford ( also on your list ) . 
  they were wealthy families , who had been able to afford higher education for their children for generations . 
  harvard 's enrollment process was discriminating right through until the 20th century . 
  after world war i when millions of immigrants arrived in the united states , harvard imposed quotas on jews , allowing only the most talented students in . 
  other groups less desirable were also less likely to gain access . 
  those most likely to get in ? 
   students of good character who could pay the tuition were usually admitted , even if sometimes on academic condition . 
  sons of men of inherited wealth , the old college families , were joined by sons of nouveaux riches businessmen . 
  these sons of the elite , who were descended off `` the old college families '' , were to continue in the highest levels of society . 
  they were america 's upper class , and as such formed the bulk of the political and economic elites . 
  harvard , along with yale and princeton , had educated `` proportionately more leaders than any other undergraduate colleges in the united states '' , lending a great deal to their prestige . 
  bonus material from [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_presidents_of_the_united_states_by_education ) - a list of presidents and where they went to university . 
  out of 43 presidents , there were :, 
  7 who attended harvard in some form ,, 
  5 for yale ,, 
  4 for w&m ,, 
  and 3 for princeton . 
  so those four schools alone educated just under half of the men who went onto become president . 
  if you go to the individual college alumni pages , you 'll find a bevy of other political figures who went through those institutions too .
