  when i hit the sub , i look at the front page for anything interesting , then i go to the newly submitted threads and open anything that looks eye catching - which a lot of it is . 
  after each page i might have 10 tabs open , and i sift through those , looking at questions and considering what i can answer . 
  ** how do i choose which topics to look at closely ? 
  firstly , i look for topics that i 've studied . 
  i completed a degree in history last year , and took as many papers as i could in that subject . 
  secondly , i look for topics that i 've come across out of interest or heard something about so that it 's slightly familiar . 
  lastly , if a topic does n't fit into either of those categories , i try and judge if it 's going to be easily researched . 
  for these ones i jump into jstor and have a quick poke around for some resources on the topic . 
  if it does n't fit the first two , and the third does n't throw anything out , i leave it . 
  ** how do i answer those ? 
  if it fell into the first category of something i 've studied , i check my old essays to see which way i argued , and what resources i used . 
  when a topic comes up like [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2rxlc6/what_was_life_in_spain_under_islamic_rule_and/ ) or [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2r6cuv/were_songs_that_we_currently_associate_with_the/ ) , which i had extensively answered upon only recently , i 'm able to find those same resources , and write out my answer again . 
  ** but ** questions are never exactly the same . 
  so i 'll do more research now to add further evidence , or answer side questions that pop up . 
  this means that i can do more directed research , but along a field i 'm familiar with . 
  they 're also fun to answer because you have the general knowledge of the information in your head . 
  the problem is that whereas this information is considered common knowledge at a university level , and so does n't need to be cited , here that is n't always the case . 
  so i 'll take more time on these questions to find sources for information which i would normally assume a reader would know . 
  for the second category , the topics that i 've not studied but still have some familiarity with through other sources , it 's a little different . 
  i go back to where i learned about that topic , whether it 's wikipedia , a novel i 've read , or some news articles talking about the issue . 
  from that overview , i find academic sources which can give me more information on the topic and the pieces of the historical puzzle . 
  an example of this is [ this answer on genghis khan 's invasion of europe . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2pg33w/why_didnt_genghis_khan_invade_western_europe/ ) i have n't studied the mongolian empire academically , and the only reason this answer stood out to me was because i had recently read conn iggulden 's fantastic series on genghis ( there are five books and you should read them all and devour them ) . 
  having read it , i was tempted to immediately switch my focus from the civil rights movement to 13th century mongolia . 
  short of that however , i read sources , and the question motivated me enough to look up the answers and find out the likely truth of the matter ( since i knew the fictional reason , but not the real one ) . 
  so having looked through john man 's text , and checked timelines , i was able to work out the answer to the question , while learning a fair amount for myself . 
  the final category is those that i know nothing about , but intrigued me enough to click . 
  these are the really fun answers , because they bring me into contact with history i knew nothing about . 
  they 're also difficult , because i usually have only a basic knowledge and therefore no framework to work off for the research . 
  i notice these ones when they 're submitted because they 're the sort of question i would submit if i thought of it . 
  my answers on [ henry clay ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2qoc14/henry_clay_ran_for_president_three_times_over_a/ ) and the [ symbols of communism ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2qoc14/henry_clay_ran_for_president_three_times_over_a/ ) are two examples of this . 
  communism was such a huge part of 20th century politics , and its symbols are famous around the world . 
  henry clay was a consumate politician , with a long history of political service . 
  yet i could n't tell you from a quick google search where those symbols originated , or why clay was so unlucky in his quest for the white house . 
  they 're the deceptively complex questions that drop you on a wikipedia page for a quick answer , and you emerge an hour later with a basic knowledge of the royal families of europe . 
  for these questions , i 'd go to google for a basic outline , and then to my university library site and jstor for more resources . 
  in the case of henry clay , i found a large amount of articles straight away that gave me information on his policies . 
  it was quite a famous career . 
  the communism one was more difficult - the first answer was two lines of basic `` hammer means this , sickle means this '' , but i wanted to know * how * it came to be chosen . 
  i spent maybe an hour looking through databases and google for an article , until i stumbled across one written on political symbolism by a russian scholar . 
  it was n't available , even through university networks , so i had to keep looking for another version , which i eventually found . 
  ** so in short , ** if i 've studied it or run into it in my reading ( fictional or not ) i 'll take a look at a question to see the answers . 
  if it 's something i 've studied , i 'll be able to point to some sources fairly quickly , and if it 's from a non-academic point of view that i know about the topic , i 'll go hunting for some academic knowledge to sort the fact from fiction . 
  lastly are the questions which bring something up out of history which i do n't know about at all , but draws me in anyway . 
  these ones i 'll take a look for sources and then attempt an answer , or if i find no sources , i 'll save it and come back to read someone else 's answer . 
  i think most people aim for freely available sources , but it 's not always possible . 
  i 'm a student , so i 'm still making use of the databases i have access to . 
  personally , i like jstor because it has access to everything right there . 
  but it is a pay to access service , so before i link any jstor source i use in a post , i 'll try find it for free elsewhere ( it 's amazing how many academic papers are freely uploaded on the internet ) . 
  i think you have a few things mixed up here . 
  the chinese population in america dates back to the mid-nineteenth century and the california gold rush . 
  the chinese enclaves are not a newer development , but rather an older one based on their exclusion from society for not being white . 
  their prominence is due to their age , not their relatively late entry into american society . 
  as an aside , mass european immigration to the united states was huge in the years during and following wwi , as refugees from the war poured into the country . 
  these are arguably newer ethnic appearances than the chinese . 
  huntly . 
  121 km/h on the best roads in the rain would be insanity . 
  yeah , i definitely think that some open roads could be higher limits , but they inevitably have t intersections with cars pulling out , and if people are free to do 120 km down those roads , we 'll likely see more issues . 
  at the end of the day , i think most of our speed limits are ok . 
  i would n't mind one or two 50 areas getting moved to 60/70 , but not really necessary . 
  after driving at 50 for the last two months , accidentally getting up to 60 on a downhill slope these days feels positively light speedish . 
  let 's not pretend that drivers on our roads are anything near the quality of race car drivers . 
  when you say arbitrary number , are you referring to a blanket speed of 50 km/h around suburbs or something ? 
  in auckland it 's 50km moving into 60 , then 100 , then down to 80 ( going from suburbs  arterial  motorway  inner city motorway . 
  going in the other direction , there are 50 zones which change to 80 for arterials , or 70 for country roads linking suburbs . 
  it seems pretty set to me . 
  democrats are centre left in us politics . 
  while they might be centre-right or even right to the rest of the world , most definitely centre-left there . 
  by what standards ? 
  if you compare to them other western nations , yeah . 
  look at it internally ? 
  democrats are liberal , republicans are conservative . 
  tea party faction is very conservative . 
  if you start looking at it by the standard of other leftist parties , you make them a conservative nation , and they do n't know who to hate anymore !, 
  i was n't replying to his question , i was just pointing out that he 's wrong when he calls the democrats a centre-right party . 
  most other countries have more than two parties , so political spectrums are far different to the us . 
  being a two party system however , democrats and republicans make up left and right . 
  it 's not that the definitions of left and right change , it 's that the centre changes . 
  is it possible that it was a hollow loaf of bread with a brick inside ? 
  easy to do , and it effectively conceals the bricks from scrutiny until you get to a riot and want to throw it . 
  it would also relate to the raines law sandwich in that it was a false sandwich , with something inside . 
  light rain/drizzle , it 'd be fine . 
  but i 'm thinking of motorways in my area ( specifically auckland ) , and the corners some of them have which would have cars wiping out one after another if their tyres were even the slightest bit worn . 
  but really , i 'm content with the speed limits , so i probably should n't be arguing this . 
  i like that there 's only one volcano , so we can ignore the forty nine others waiting to send us all to hell . 
  pretty much . 
  but it comes across as radical due to america refusing to shift . 
  [ hehe hey gerry , i got a new job ] ( http://imgur.com/md4ubxq ), 
  in short : it was n't the main reason . 
  i 'm not even sure i would call it a growing demand for civil rights , because they 'd been demanding the same things for a long time already . 
  however , the movement definitely gained traction and got both visibility and victories , first with brown v. board , and later with the civil rights act . 
  but i 'll go into that in depth below . 
  the post wwii period was marked by a few factors that made everything much more visible to the american public . 
  firstly , was the service of african americans in the us armed forces during the war . 
  secondly , the cold war painting america as a bastion of freedom , while african americans were able to see that was n't the case .
