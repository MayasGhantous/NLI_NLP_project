  i try to !, 
  but i 'm very bad about getting on to it and actually doing it ( as a hobby ) or talking to people about doing it ( as a profession ) . 
  thanks , i appreciate this a lot !, 
  thanks , i 'm always envious of those comments that congratulate writing style on here , so this is really cool to hear . 
  i try , and i succeed some of the time , but to be fair , it 's hard not to be when you 're driving in the new zealand country . 
  he 's being embarrassed daily by the wh . 
  that 's not his job . 
  comey in a room with aides : `` barb ? 
  barb ? 
  holy fuck . 
  barb !, 
  call jim , tell him golf 's on today . 
  nunes went in under 10 , i 've got the whole afternoon . '', 
  is this game any good ? 
  considering flagging the matches tonight and waiting for tomorrow, 
  i do n't live in ireland , but judging by the front page of the sub , i 'm thinking it might be bus drivers today ? 
  i 'm six minutes in and it 's already apparent after mcguinness mentions bloody sunday :, 
  interviewer : this sounds like a playground argument - `` they did this first ! '', 
  mcguinness : if you want to examine the roots of the conflict , and all of the participants in the conflict , then we have to have this discussion . 
  interviewer : i want to examine the morality of killing innocent people . 
  now he 's either completely ignorant of bloody sunday , or he 's just writing off the innocence of the dead there . 
  would n't that be an argument * for * the troubles ? 
  if 1916 occurred when catholics in the north were doing ok , why would n't people want to fight in the late 60s when they were n't doing so well by comparison ? 
  sorry , misunderstood your original post !, 
  god he 's got a fucking rat 's tail too , and tooth gaps you could parallel park between . 
  tbh , from what i 've read on this sub , they seem to think it 's a piece of shit , but that it 's better than the other piece of shit . 
  which seems fair given that it was gutted by repubs before it became law . 
  it was probably a little something like this :, 
  ** mark ** : uly , my man , 10 % ? 
  that 's awful . 
  ** ulysses ** : i know marky , i know , but i need brumhilda to have something !, 
  ** mark ** : i 'll do it . 
  let me do it . 
  ** ulysses ** : oh thanks bb !, 
  did n't he fight and kill rhaegar , who was meant to be an amazing fighter ? 
  being in favour of something and thinking it 's a piece of shit are n't mutually exclusive you know . 
  obamacare was gutted by republicans . 
  this made it a pretty shitty implementation . 
  trumpcare was a piece of shit . 
  this was by design . 
  one piece of shit was liked better than the other by voters , but does n't change the fact that it 's still a piece of shit . 
  would you rather this piece of dog shit , or this piece of seagull shit from the galapagos ? 
  the correct answer is the seagull shit , because it 's a valuable fertiliser . 
  next up , seagull shit , or cat shit ? 
  probably cat shit this time , because it 's an extremely rare coffee . 
  to be less literal , would you prefer this 1970 porsche 911 that 's been sitting in my yard for forty years in the rain ? 
  or would you like the 1990 toyota corolla that 's been there for 25 years ? 
  they 're both pieces of shit . 
  but one is preferable . 
  obamacare was by many accounts too expensive . 
  it did however , provide cover . 
  people were n't happy with it , but it was a damn sight better than trumpcare , so they were in favour of it . 
  stop being so obtuse . 
  but one is better . 
  what do n't you get ? 
  people openly complain about obamacare being too expensive , and it is . 
  it should n't cost anything . 
  it should be free . 
  it 's not fucking perfect , it 's not even great , stop pretending it is . 
   under dinkins ' safe streets , safe cities program , crime in new york city decreased more dramatically and more rapidly , both in terms of actual numbers and percentage , than at any time in modern new york city history . 
  the rates of most crimes , including all categories of violent crime , made consecutive declines during the last 36 months of his four-year term , ending a 30-year upward spiral and initiating a trend of falling rates that continued beyond his term . 
  despite the actual abating of crime , dinkins was hurt by the perception that crime was out of control during his administration . 
  dinkins also initiated a hiring program that expanded the police department nearly 25 % . 
  the new york times reported , `` he obtained the state legislature 's permission to dedicate a tax to hire thousands of police officers , and he fought to preserve a portion of that anticrime money to keep schools open into the evening , an award-winning initiative that kept tens of thousands of teenagers off the street . '', 
  it does n't sound too bad under dinkins . 
  she 's wearing a bikini , he 's just joking around . 
  it 's rare to see him like that . 
  so would you disagree with the summary above ? 
  it sounds like dinkins started nyc on the path that giuliani continued down to make it safer . 
  yes , but julia was short for brumhilda, 
  the broken windows theory has been criticised for simplifying perceptions of crime and its causes , and it resulted in stop and frisk , which was n't a good policy at all . 
  you 're saying rudy took the leash off the police , but dinkins had decreasing crime rates every month for 3 consecutive years , and he increased the police presence and numbers . 
  so rudy could n't have done anything without dinkins ? 
  they 've made 74 tackles to the blues 39 ? 
  had bulls h2h at start when it was $ 4 , what happened to them ? 
  who the hell bets on the blues , right ? 
  i 'm thinking rudy gets some credit , because conservatives do tend to have an effect on crime . 
  i suspect that because of stop and frisk it was probably an overreaching effect which had too much collateral damage . 
  who the fuck was that speedster on the wing ? 
  oh wow , that was really nice of the brumbies player to make sure aaron smith got a taste of the grass after tackling him there, 
  because they both arrived at the same time as the highlanders chasers ? 
  i totally agree with you , i think it 'd be terrible to be commando as a guy or a girl . 
  your skirt comment reminded me of a girl in one of my classes who used to wear * really * short dresses in summer with bare legs . 
  what was weird though was that when she sat down , she would n't smooth the back of the dress over her thighs and butt like most girls do , but she lifted it out of the way so that she sat on the chair with this tiny dress sort of floating around her disney style . 
  the skirt of her dress was too short to be wearing shorts underneath so she was basically sitting underwear and butt straight on these chairs which seemed really gross . 
  no he 's not, 
  everyone knows you have to have a foot in touch and a foot in play to make it out . 
  the ball is n't out until it touches a player or the ground who is out of play . 
  if you jump over the line like the brumbies player did , the ball is n't out until it touches you which means that you 've made it out = other team 's throw . 
  he was n't though that 's the point . 
  the replay clearly showed him with his feet off the ground mid-run when he was taking the ball and that means he 's taken it into touch . 
  i think an even bigger factor was the koch brothers . 
  they set up a new fund for political campaigns , and the only way to get access was to vote against this bill . 
  the kochs do n't want trumpcare because it does n't go far enough in its repeals of obamacare provisions . 
  but they have a fuckton of money so they can get it stopped . 
  trump ca n't , because trump is president , and presidents who offer cash for votes probably get impeached even faster than he is already . 
  she still won the pop vote . 
  she still won the primary . 
  she still had a huge turnout . 
   people i know who i respect ( though less now ) voted for trump and the sole reason was it was against her .
