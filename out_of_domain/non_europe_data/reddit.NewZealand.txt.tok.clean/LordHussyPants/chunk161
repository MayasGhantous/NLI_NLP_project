  for example . 
  you wear a pink shirt . 
  are you less of a man for that ? 
  you like to have sex with other men . 
  are you less of a man for that ? 
  you do n't like alcohol . 
  you do n't like sports . 
  you do n't like hunting . 
  you 're a vegan . 
  you ca n't use a hammer . 
  you use hair product . 
  you like lolly drinks . 
  you get offended when you hear someone use a racial slur . 
  do you think any of those things make someone less of a man ? 
  the people who scream `` there are only two genders ! '', 
  and `` she 's not a real woman if she 's still got her balls ! '', 
  are also the ones who decide that a 30 yo man who wears pink shirts with purple love hearts on them , fucks other guys , and does n't drink , is n't a real man . 
  that 's what toxic masculinity is . 
  the idea that you have to act in a certain macho way to be considered a man , to the exclusion of all the simple pleasures of life that do n't fit into that `` ideal man '' concept . 
  why not ? 
  because you do n't want to , or because you 've been told not to ? 
  there have been thousands of years of human history where men did n't wear pants , but instead wore items of clothing far more similar to a dress . 
  kilts , togas , tunics , all open from the bottom up with no dividing material . 
  you 're thinking of sex , which is biological . 
  and the third would be intersex . 
  these isaiah thomas passes are insane . 
  i know the guy does everything else like a god , but this is what 's standing out to me today, 
  did the commentator just called jimmy butler kevin butler lmao, 
   the site includes a skeleton that looks like it was taken apart and broken ** with stone tools , which are left in place alongside the bones ** they smashed . 
  one tusk appears to have been stuck upright into the ground . 
  why has n't coach put mcw in ?? 
  why are we playing a man down ? 
  i was watching this before and freaking out . 
  i remember trying it as a kid and i must have looked like such a moron, 
  man , where the fuck she gon na keep those raincoats ? 
  you think she 's gon na do some magic trick and pull them out of her twat like a string of hankerchiefs ? 
   i work for the county ; it ' ** s ** a gre ** a ** t job . 
  i actually lo ** v ** e it h ** e ** re !, 
  small-town vibe , b ** u ** t big enough to actually have ** s ** tuff to do . 
  we ' ** r ** e trying to buy a hous ** e ** an ** d ** really put ** d ** own roots here !, 
  hey i think he needs our help to find this guy called redd ? 
  even for subjects in the arts , you ca n't have the same knowledge as someone who has actually studied philosophy for 3 years while you 've just read it . 
  what people do n't consider is the quality of the teaching . 
  my ability to teach myself law is substantially less than that of a law professor who has been trained for that purpose . 
   for a lot of subjects you definitely can . 
  this is only partly true . 
  self-taught people are taking a huge leap because they have to be able to identify what is worthy of learning , while a university course is structured to give you what you need to understand concepts . 
  a self taught programmer is probably going to have a gaps in their knowledge because they just could n't cover the full breadth of the topic . 
  also , understanding is key , so a phd of compsci who understands * why * you need to do a piece of coding a certain way is going to be better able to teach someone who reads a textbook and then says `` oh , it must be done this way because that 's just how it works . '', 
  you could be the thirty year old maccas cashier hanging out with your two friends who did n't get expelled from law school in first year for supplying alcohol to minors in the hall of residence bathrooms , resulting in the dean 's daughter getting plastered and taken to the hospital . 
  but white americans ca n't even handle being told that the negative effects of slavery are still being felt in african american communities . 
  how the fuck they going to deal with being punished as descendants of slavers ? 
  that 's not really a valid statistic for this question though . 
  the survey only shows men 's opinions on abortion when women are having children , but if men could suddenly have kids too , there 's no way of knowing how many people 's positions would change to protect themselves . 
  and to go even further , men are the dominant gender in lawmaking . 
  out of 535 members of the 114th congress , [ just 108 are women - pdf warning - ] ( https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/r43869.pdf ) so a change in our biology that gave men a 50 % chance of getting pregnant would suddenly make 80 % of the house of representatives and senate at risk of unwanted pregnancies . 
  that 's a substantial number of lawmakers who suddenly have a personal reason to want access to safe abortions . 
  that 's supported by the number of people who vote against abortion , but still love getting them for their wives/girlfriends/maids / whoever else they 've been fucking . 
  edit : i did n't expect this to go so high , and i wrote it quite early in the morning and forgot one crucial thing - rich white people will always take care of themselves , so even if trey gowdy got pregnant to a crackwhore in a rest stop bathroom outside of charleston , he 'd be able to get himself an abortion one way or another . 
  in the past [ they 've been known as hermaphrodites . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intersex ) they 're people who do n't have female or male identifying characteristics , which can range from having something other than an xx or xy chromosome set , to having a sex organ that is 50/50 vagina/penis , to having something completely new . 
  in other words , it 's scientific fact that you can see and touch , so it 's not even something you can deny because you do n't believe in it . 
  i would n't be so sure on the empathy scale , but if your son is pregnant to the coat room attendant and his political chances are damage , you might need to do something about it . 
  also , while the senate might be older on average , the house has enough men of childbearing age . 
  somehow , i do n't think he noticed . 
  no , it 's a third sex . 
  sex is the physical manifestation of your genetic makeup . 
  gender is the way you present that makeup to the world . 
  gender is performative . 
  yes . 
  fekitoa 's doing the kick off lifts now ? 
  what ca n't he do !, 
  that sounds a lot better than any episode of south park i ever saw tbh, 
  fascism . 
  you see , it 's really just about the ability to express your opinions freely . 
  they do n't * actually * want to harm people . 
  they just want to * act * like they do !, 
  golly gosh silly liberals !, 
  there are some times where a player carries an entire team on their back , but come on , this was nothing like that . 
  in the first game , it started off crying on the sideline because his sister had just died . 
  bulls only won by 4 . 
  when rondo disappeared , the bulls would have taken a hit , for sure , but at the same time this is a team of pro athletes . 
  and not just pros who play for money but will never have any accolades - it was people like wade and butler who are really good players , and have or will win those awards . 
  the problem was n't that rondo disappeared and suddenly the bulls had no one capable of carrying them . 
  it was that rondo left and the bulls could n't shake the idea that they needed him , so they just slumped and never got up again . 
  it 's not really that primitive a device though . 
  it 's primitive tech , but that 's plainly a modern device . 
  the reason they 're using that is probably because they 're at the end of the production scale where they 're producing the corn , and it would be too expensive to buy an industrial machine to do it , or to send their corn to the factory then buy it back when it 's been ground . 
  all of that said , yeah , it is a crazy reminder of how privileged we are . 
  i can drive 30min and see fields of corn , but i can also drive for 3min and buy a kg of ground cornmeal for $ 3 . 
  this is basically how askhistorians works which is why it 's imo the best run sub on reddit ( i 'm extremely biased , i 'm a flair there ) . 
  to be flaired , you need to have about 5 in depth answers to questions on the topic you specialise in , usually with sources . 
  the benefits of being flaired are enormous though , because you almost immediately see a high rate of karma for your future answers as a flaired user because people trust the flair . 
  this in turn means that the most likely answers to be upvoted are those by flaired users , who are from a select group of applicants that have been checked for the quality of their contributions . 
  overall , this lifts the quality of the sub further . 
  that 's where the depth of his collection channel works - the water will flow out when it reaches the rim , and the hammer begins to outweigh the force of the water again . 
  it 's better than that , he self treated because he was upset they 'd shift him to the back of the queue if he left . 
  he literally touched an electric fence because he could n't save a spot in line, 
  it 's right there in the article . 
  yeah , he 'd had it for 19 years .
