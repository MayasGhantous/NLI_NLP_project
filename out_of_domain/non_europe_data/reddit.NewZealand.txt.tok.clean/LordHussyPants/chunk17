  coincidentally , and of no relevance to this post , the slave was later hanged for murdering a black man in mississippi . 
  so , to sum up , murdering a slave was legal until 1774 . 
  after 1774 it became illegal . 
  but it was still kind of legal because the law was n't written correctly . 
  in 1817 the law was fixed , and in the years following , different courts ruled on different things , and gradually a system was in place . 
  that system was that a man who killed a slave could be sentenced to a year in prison , and upon second conviction , to death . 
  however , the man was not guilty if the slave died after a moderate punishment had been inflicted . 
  if the slave died of excessive punishment , which was `` barbarous or immoderate '' , or used a deadly weapon , the killer was guilty . 
  at the same time , slaves could defend themselves against excessive punishment , but not moderate punishment . 
  to answer the questions of the op : yes there were laws protecting slaves from their owners . 
  if a slave owner tried to torture and behead a slave , he would be sentenced to a year in prison . 
  if he 'd done it before , he would be put to death ( this is of course assuming he succeeded , and that the slave did n't kill him first ) .

   i did n't expect new zealand to be highest up the list compared to all of europe and oceania excluding former soviet . 
  this is the most arbitrary categorization possible . 
  i do n't know what magic you expected , but this was guaranteed to provide flawed results . 
  which have their roots in racism . 
  australia is worse because it 's open about how racist it is . 
  we 're worse because we coat it in phrases like `` well , australia is sooo much worse '' and then just ignore all signs of a problem . 
  what 's super screwed up about this is that the term `` free-range parenting '' is a thing . 
  regular parenting has been rebranded as something extreme , while extreme fear parenting is presented as the norm . 
  if it 's your first application , it 's always a bit shit . 
  when it gets to your second and third years , you can apply and it 's all done pretty much instantaneously . 
  i applied for mine online two nights ago and it was all sorted after half an hour , i just need to wait for them to confirm it . 
  they wo n't ask me for extra details though because they have it all from my first app . 
  edit : best tip i can give you - go to the winz offices and hope like hell to find a nice person there who will take your documents . 
  i tried asking the lady there for the address once and she kicked me out , but my mum went down to suss my brother 's loan at another time , and managed to get a pleasant desk person who took five minutes to stick all the stuff in an envelope and send it off to wellington . 
  that 's a commerce commission complaint , surely ? 
  even if it 's not that sounds like the sort of thing that the company would just swallow and deal with to keep a customer . 
  there are so many replies in this thread about orcon being shit . 
  is this generally the experience with them ? 
  i 've always heard they were great , and no-one 's ever complained about them among my friends . 
  i 've been on telecom since the 90s - never had experience with another isp , so i 'm genuinely curious here . 
  i help out at my mum 's floral business sometimes , so the worst thing in the world is hearing someone say , `` oh my , is that for me ? '', 
  as soon as they spot me holding flowers , because i 've already heard it fifty times that day . 
  obviously it spread at different rates , depending on the developmental levels of individual nations . 
  i 've got some information together on russia , with the help of reviews of a book by jonathan coopersmith . 
  the book is called , * the electrification of russia , 1880-1926 * , and despite being unable to find a copy of it , it sounds like it was custom written for this question . 
  the russian state under the tsars seems to have been quite unreceptive towards new technologies . 
  russian inventors found their fame in western europe , receiving no appreciation in russia . 
  the obstacles to electrification were many . 
  infrastructure was n't available , and local government authorities were n't willing to pay for it , seeing as they were already in debt . 
  there were political disputes too , both local and national , all contributing to delays . 
  the russian military was the leader in the adoption of electricity , so it was n't unheard of in russia . 
  as well as this , while its uptake in the civilian world was slow , it was n't non-existent . 
  this suggests it was available in modest amounts , most likely in the homes of the rich . 
  with pure speculation , i 'd suggest it was also more likely to be found in the homes of those who had travelled outside of russia , and had seen its application elsewhere . 
  diplomats would be well aware of the uses of electricity by these groups , and spending time abroad , by its application there . 
  but america was not fully electrified either . 
  in 1907 only 8 % of american homes had electricity . 
  this grew to 35 % in 1920 , and 70 % in 1930 . 
  the reason for this was because the technology for carrying large amounts of electricity over distance had not yet been completely worked out . 
  knowing this , it 's reasonable to say that russian diplomats would most likely be surprised at the way electricity was deployed in american homes . 
  however , i do n't think it was as widespread as you seem to think it was . 
  with this in mind , it 's more likely any surprise was rooted in the application of domestic use , rather than the actual concept of electricity . 
  i 'm not from america !, 
  but call your local nurseries/garden centres and ask them . 
  i just want to point out that in some fields of history , old books are all that 's available . 
  i was trying to add books to the booklist the other week for new zealand history , and the only general texts i could add were two relatively new ones ( last 4-5 years ) . 
  prior to that , the most recent was years old . 
  sometimes scholarship just is n't completed in a field and you have to make do . 
  often there are issues with that scholarship , but by and large , the information is still true - the only thing that changes a lot of the time between old information and new is the context in which it is analysed . 
  an older book can be a perfectly fine source , and for general reading , it 's excellent . 
  you just need to remember to be critical of it . 
  i 'll generally admit to watching these , but it surprises people that i do/have . 
  * gossip girl, 
  * the vampire diaries, 
  * grey 's anatomy, 
  have you looked at nurseries ? 
  actual plant nurseries ? 
  they specialize in that sort of thing and will be far more knowledgeable than the other two . 
  one of my friends needed hers for work but auckland waiting times were long as after she failed the first time . 
  she took a roadtrip to thames and did it there . 
  successfully . 
  this is really important . 
  in new zealand at least , the anzac identity was bolstered by community groups and government at home , rather than by soldiers coming back and saying `` oh mate , those aussies are our best buddies , we had a real moment together . '', 
  the success of these groups is apparent in the fact that we still hold anzac days , anzac tests , bake anzac cookies and all of that . 
  what 's even more interesting though , is that these days started * during * the war , not after it . 
  the first one was held in ~ ~ 1915 ~ ~ 1916 i believe , indicating that it was n't organised by the soldiers at all . 
  is that ... is that a moving truck ? 
  at the big palace in the foreground ? 
  i saw `` crack '' at the end of the sentence and thought you were making bracelets on drugs . 
  you look like you just stole a mini fuckin ' atm . 
  she weighed 200lb and it was half a pound a pound . 
  first of all , we 'll need to sort out some basic terms and their definitions to make this understandable , otherwise it 's going to be a whole heap of confusion for all the non-kiwis on this sub . 
  [ * iwi * ] ( http://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&amp;phrase=&amp;proverb=&amp;loan=&amp;keywords=iwi&amp;search= ) - a tribal group . 
  the largest group . 
  [ * hapu * ] ( http://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&amp;phrase=&amp;proverb=&amp;loan=&amp;keywords=hapu&amp;search= ) - sub-tribe . 
  the next level down from * iwi * . 
  described as `` the primary political unit in traditional m\u0101ori society '' , a * hapu * was descended from a common ancestor , and multiple * hapu * formed the * iwi * , which was a far looser connection . 
  [ * utu * ] ( http://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&amp;phrase=&amp;proverb=&amp;loan=&amp;keywords=utu&amp;search= ) - to repay or respond . 
  often mistranslated as revenge , it was used for this purpose , but could also be a positive trade such as repaying a favour . 
  * utu * was the main reason for all m\u0101ori warfare .
