  no hate here , he writes a story that does drag you in . 
  [ matthew reilly 's captain jack west novels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matthew_reilly#jack_west_jr ) are into the historical/tech/science categories , but they 're not so much thrillers as they are adventure novels . 
  if you 're not so worried about whether it 's a thriller or not , then i 'd say give him a go . 
  they 're very enjoyable books , and the historical aspects are fascinating . 
  i 'd also suggest a look at [ steve berry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/steve_berry_\\ ( novelist \\ ) ) . 
  like dan brown , he 's not a literary beauty , but he writes interesting stories with a basis ( real or not ) in historical stuff . 
  in one book his characters find the tomb of alexander the great for example . 
  bill bryson 's [ life and times of the thunderbolt kid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_life_and_times_of_the_thunderbolt_kid ) is great . 
  [ bryce courtenay ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bryce_courtenay ) wrote * sylvia * , a book about the children 's crusade . 
  it 's quite harrowing , like a lot of his work , but it is interesting . 
  [ machado de assis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/machado_de_assis ) , brazilian writer from the late 19th century . 
  his book * the posthumous memoirs of bras cubas * is a really intriguing read , and the style of structure is intense too . 
  it 's quite easy to find an english translation of i belive . 
  [ keri hulme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/keri_hulme ) is a m\u0101ori writer from nz and her book * the bone people * won the booker prize in the 80s . 
  [ witi ihimaera ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/witi_ihimaera ) has several books , and is widely regarded as one of the best writers new zealand has produced . 
  [ alan duff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alan_duff ) is another m\u0101ori writer . 
  his book * once were warriors * is about an urban m\u0101ori family and their struggles . 
  it got made into a movie of the same name , but it 's quite a violent and disturbing read . 
  i 'm trying to think of pasifika literature , but the only examples of books i can think of are english writers in the pacific , like robert louis stevenson and his * south sea tales * , and even that is short stories . 
  most of my experience of pasifika writers has been in poetry or short fiction . 
  for that , look up * niu voices * , a collection edited by selina tuistala marsh , who has also released her own collections of poetry . 
  gabe said the shanghai major was james ' second chance . 
  he fucked it . 
  this is proportionate , because it 's a job , not a sentence . 
  you do n't fire someone for sexual harassment and say `` oh hey , come back in 2 years , and you 'll be good to go with a clean slate . '', 
  all blacks win , 2-1 at worst . 
  two of the test matches are at eden park where the abs have n't lost since ' 94 . 
  i think that 's a massive bit of pressure to put on any team that visits . 
  that 's 5 games against lions feeder teams over the course of a year where we also saw 5 kiwi teams play super rugby over 20 rounds or so , the all blacks play ~ 10 tests , and any itm cup games we might pick up . 
  it takes me awhile just to figure out the names of super rugby players because there are so many . 
  i know the names of a few home nations players if i think hard enough , but usually it 's just the big names i remember from world cups - warburton , mike brown . 
  when you 've got so much rugby down here , it 's hard to bring out the enthusiasm to go watch nh games at 3am and learn those names too . 
  it 's not that domestic rugby dominates , it 's that sh rugby does . 
  we all know aussie and south african players , and probably even a few argies and japanese ones . 
  i 'll see youtube clips occasionally , but again , mostly sh rugby . 
  the only rugby forum i go to is this one , and the only facebook pages i can think of focus on sh rugby too , although tony veitch 's might do nh but he 's an arsehole so i wo n't check what he posts . 
  i keep up with rugby through our news mostly , which does n't care for nh rugby too much except if there 's an update on dan carter or the 6n are on . 
  to be honest , when i 've seen nh rugby , i get a bit bored . 
  my mistake , i assumed when you said ` proportionate ' you meant james because i could n't figure out how the fuck you 'd manage to convince yourself that match fixing in a professional competition would merit any level of forgiveness . 
  yeah i think conditionally is important here . 
  he was pointing out that if a 16yo can have sex , they should be able to make the choice to get married too . 
  but he wants them to have judicial approval for marriage still , which judging by the context of the article , means they need a family court judge to approve the marriage rather than just getting parental permission ( which could be used to make a case for abuse though arranged marriages for minors ) . 
  all in all , i 'd say christie did ok here , considering the festival of shit i expect when i see his name . 
  does n't matter what the damage is . 
  it 's matchfixing . 
  that 's a permanent ban in any organised competition . 
  congrats , you probably read more rugby posts than i do then . 
  blog post ? 
  news post ? 
  anything posted on the internet with information about rugby ? 
  it was just a joke about an old lady who did n't see a fire engine come up behind her , chill, 
  good to know that bob iger 's line that ca n't be crossed is global warming , and not all the other stuff trump has done . 
  i highly recommend deleting everything on your reading list and just kicking into these . 
  yeah , i ca n't remember my 2014 vote , and i usually have a great memory . 
  i know i intended to vote lab candidate/green , but i might have gone lab/lab last minute . 
  but they 've only got 3 days between games , so the rest of the tour will be a pain anyway . 
  whether that was a first string or a third string , they should have won by 30 + . 
  they played against 22 blokes no one 's ever heard of , and 1 bloke who we only know because he has a similar name to the coach . 
  crusaders unbeaten run to continue through the june test gap, 
  i watched that game with a childhood mate of mine who 's a crusaders fan . 
  fuckin insufferable, 
  honest question : how many names did you recognise out of the starting 22 ? 
  i knew one . 
  bryn gatland , and that 's only because i 've been to harbour games and i had wondered if he was related to warren . 
  that was a team of unknowns , they should n't have been within 40 at the end , let alone leading at half time . 
  if it makes you feel better , i would have done the same thing . 
  the ease of reading guides like that is assuming the person writing the guide got it right . 
  i would have painstakingly gone letter for letter over their example . 
  the question was ` why england ? 
  what the hell did they do ? 
  ' , and the answer unfortunately is that their their history of colonisation , their alliance with america , and their role in interventionist politics ( like iraq and afghanistan ) , have made them a target . 
  these attacks were wrong , and i do n't think anyone on reddit is disagreeing with that . 
  but if people want to know the reason why england is a target , and not beijing , or moscow , or rio de janeiro , this is a key factor and needs to be remembered . 
  yes , britain is hurting , but forgetting the history of the empire and painting this as a wild attack on an unpredictable target is a misstep . 
  by forgetting that context , these attacks become random and confusing . 
  when that happens , blame gets placed with far less accuracy , and regular muslims ( the hundreds of millions who have no intention of perpetrating attacks ) are demonised . 
  the outcome of that is hate crimes , and a population of minority youth who do n't like the way they 're treated in a country where they were born , and grew up . 
  there 's importance to historical context , especially at a time like this . 
  it 's not pathetic to think about why the uk is a target , and you can do it without placing blame . 
  tourists and civilians did n't cause 9/11 either , but civilians died in the wars that followed . 
  third incident has been confirmed unrelated to the first two by the met police . 
  i begged my parents for this game when i was a kid and they got it for me !, 
  and then i convinced my dad to play it and spent half an hour setting it up * perfectly . 
  * i had read the rule book front to back so i knew exactly what i was doing , and then we started playing . 
  after about 2 hours , one of us had enough money to buy something . 
  dad thought it was a bit slow , so we looked at the rule book again . 
  turns out i did n't read the bit where you collect an income * every turn * , and we 'd made the game run a thousand times slower than it was meant to . 
  he told me to start it again , but it was about 11pm so we only got another hour of play then packed it up the next day . 
  have n't played since . 
  kanye 's a real musician and he uses auto-tune . 
  t-pain uses auto-tune religiously , yet he can sing without it so beautifully he 'd make your grandmother cry . 
  auto-tune does n't make someone less of a musician , how they use it does . 
  so your name and first page of reddit comment history just make me think you 're a 15 year old who thinks he 's mildly edgy . 
  i wo n't bother . 
  well yeah , because it reinforces the notion that he 's not one of us . 
  he 's not western . 
  or anglo . 
  he makes all these movies , he lives here , he tries to fit in , and the one thing people make fun of him for is the signifier of his origin . 
   stair did go on to try and clarify : `` i do n't want to call them n ----- , shit ** i just went to myrtle beach , 24 guys , and i was the only white guy ; i got friends ** , i mean , there 's trash and there 's people that do this shit . 
  they just do n't pay their bills .
