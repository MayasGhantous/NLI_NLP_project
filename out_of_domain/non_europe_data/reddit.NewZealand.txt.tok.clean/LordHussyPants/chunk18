  [ * mana * ] ( http://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&amp;phrase=&amp;proverb=&amp;loan=&amp;keywords=mana&amp;search= ) - prestige , authority , power . 
  this one 's harder to translate into english , as i do n't think there 's any word that really does it justice . 
  it 's something that commands respect . 
  i feel like any of the three words i gave would do it , but qualified with `` dignified '' . 
  so with those basics down , we move on to the makeup of a war party . 
  these were known as * taua * , and they were made up of the men of the * hapu * who were going to war . 
  why would a * hapu * go to war ? 
  and why would all the men of a * hapu * go ? 
  m\u0101ori were n't professional soldiers . 
  they did n't sign up to the army and spend all their time training . 
  they were hunters , fishermen , farmers , etc. 
  when a * hapu * went to war , it was because of * utu * . 
  most often , it was the way that a grievance could be balanced out through * utu * , usually with a gain of * mana * for the victor . 
  an insult or diminishing of the * mana * of one man also affected his * hapu * . 
  as well as that , a * hapu * were tightly knit , unlike the * iwi * . 
  this meant that when insult was given , the whole group went together . 
  so if you were a member of that * hapu * , you were in if you were fit to fight . 
  this is further backed up by the fact that in peacetime ( which was a lot of the time ) , the main focus of a m\u0101ori community was on growing food and maintaining homes , * pa * ( fortresses ) , and * waka * ( canoes ) . 
  the importance of the * waka * and the * pa * in m\u0101ori military operations suggests that rather than warfare being a natural state for m\u0101ori , the natural state was in actuality being ready for war , or actively discouraging it by being ready . 
  m\u0101ori warfare was n't supposed to kill the entire enemy * taua * . 
  weapons ( pre-european arrival ) , were hand to hand only , and generally , only a few of the fighters would die from each side . 
  remember that * hapu * were the units in which wars were fought , and that they could number up to around 500 per sub tribe . 
  this was vastly different to european warfare where tens of thousands of men could be involved . 
  as for your logistical query , it was n't much of a problem . 
  with the smaller scale of the battles , not as much food was required . 
  some was taken with them , but generally portable food was uncommon and the battles were quick , so it was unneeded . 
  in times where it was , [ this website ] ( http://www.ruapekapeka.co.nz/read/traditional-maori-warfare ) says that some women and older children would accompany the * taua * to provide water and food . 
  i 'm not sure of the veracity , but it does n't seem unlikely . 
  another quote i saw in king 's * history of new zealand * mentions that women and children were not given any more mercy than men in a battle , so their presence is likely , although i ca n't say with certainty whether that refers to their presence in the * pa * or not . 
  hope this helps !,

   your mind probably suppressed everything heroes after season 4 . 
  what do you mean ? 
  there was only one season of that show . 
  no , no , i distinctly recall heroes being cancelled in 2007 because of the writer 's strike . 
  they never got to continue it . 
  such a shame .

  jernegan is an old historian , publishing in the early 20 ^ th century . 
  it 's a bit out dated , but since this is more of a factual answer than an interpretive one , it should be ok . 
  compulsory education was recognised as a necessity because without it , children could not be expected to know either religion or law . 
  official guidelines on education said that children must be literate to the level of being able `` to read and understand the principles of religion and the capital laws of the country '' , giving them both civic standing , and religious standing . 
  as with most legal issues in the united states , they were adapted in a staggered manner , with all deliberate speed ( ha ) . 
  in this case it was also because of the formation of certain states being earlier than others . 
  first to legislate compulsory education , and therefore literacy , was massachusetts in 1642 . 
  however , this was only for children , and if they were not literate they were to be apprenticed . 
  apprentices were not required to learn to read . 
  that was amended in 1648 . 
  connecticut followed massachusetts in 1650 , the new haven colony in 1655 ( it was combined with connecticut in 1665 , but had passed legislation in its own right ) . 
  none of new hampshire , maine , or rhode island passed legislation before 1700 , but due to issues of jurisdiction , both new hampshire and maine were subject to massachusetts law for a period , and by 1671 , `` all of the territory of new england , with the exception of rhode island , was under a system of compulsory education '' , which is really quite a wonderful thing . 
  in the south , virginia passed laws as early as 1642 , but these laws were for `` special classes '' of child . 
  the three classes were orphaned children , poor children , and illegitimate children . 
  the first law in 1642 was only with regards to orphans , and was not comprehensive as it only required self reporting on educational status by guardians . 
  in 1656 this was amended obliging justices to inquire into the status of orphan education . 
  for poor children in virginia , there were at least 8 laws passed between 1646 and 1769 on the matter of compulsory education . 
  these laws specifically targeted children who were not capable of being educated by their families - either for reasons of absence or poverty . 
  from this we can see that literacy was expected from the 17 ^ th century onwards in the colonies . 
  once the united states was formed , this expectation would have been shifted to the other states as they joined the union . 
  lastly , it needs to be remembered that it was illegal to teach slaves to read and write . 
  this fact both reinforces the notion of the importance of literacy , as well as showing that education was desirable while only being available to * citizens * . 
  later of course , great emphasis would be put on education by freed slaves and their children because it was a significant division between them and the white american population .

  it was n't that obvious , sorry . 
  this looks promising and it has anna kendrick . 
  i 'm gon na watch it and hope you 're right !, 
  smart of him , to plan his scandal 9 months in advance . 
  tonight i am watching this and camp and i will update if it 's solved or not . 
  this was it !, 
  thanks . 
  it 's just granulated sugar , water and corn syrup . 
  by contrast , regular icing is butter , water , icing sugar , and whatever colouring or flavour you want to add . 
  i 've never used shortening , only butter . 
  i am in new zealand though , so we go in for different recipes to america . 
  i do n't know what you mean by saying butter is n't as stable as shortening though ? 
  the only issue i can see you having with butter is not mixing it enough , but that 's easily fixed . 
  this sounds amazing . 
  what 's the recipe ? 
  but richie mccaw would never disagree with key , because richie and john are best buddies . 
  they even text each other . 
  usually you 'd put the iced goods in the fridge to set , then the butter wo n't melt . 
  you do n't serve it right off the bat with freshly done icing .
