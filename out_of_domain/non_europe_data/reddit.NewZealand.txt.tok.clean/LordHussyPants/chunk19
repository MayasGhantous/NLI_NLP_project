  the fact that she did n't let you go in the water , but did n't * immediately rush you off the beach * is such a typical nz/aus attitude . 
  `` we 'll be fine here kids , but i 'll be buggered if you 're going in the water where that tsunami is ! '', 
  i thought it would be an awful gimmick , but i got given some at christmas and i have never been so delighted to be proved wrong . 
  yeah but the nbr published that about a week ago . 
  so if he 's working to the scale of one additional week of knowledge admitted per week , and we use the second week of december as a starting point , then we only have to wait until sometime in september/october of this year before we know the truth . 
  but that 's when the rugby world cup is on , and to be honest , new zealanders do n't care about what john did last april when richie and dan are on the telly . 
  i only know bits and pieces about this , mainly relating to musa i of mali . 
  he was a king whose predecessor had sailed into the atlantic with a large fleet ( supposedly more than a thousand ships ) to see what was beyond the water . 
  a previous fleet had gone ahead and only one ship had returned , saying that the rest were lost in a giant whirlpool . 
  [ this answer by / u/reedstilt is far more detailed and gives a good overview of the question . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1zmi5t/is_there_any_evidence_that_moors_reached_the/cfuzqd8 ) it wo n't counter all of the claims in your article , but most of those are more cases of choosing a theory and then finding things that fit it , such as the appearance of pyramids in both the americas and africa . 
  coincidentally , that was explained a week or two back by someone else here as a logical building development of a basic shape ( a triangle ) . 
  means no and yes respectively . 
  i did actually say that it was musa 's predecessor , not musa himself , in my comment  thanks for the expansion on the pyramid building , i could n't remember the exact post it was in . 
  would you be able to give some extra context for this ? 
  i 'd answer it but at the moment it 's far too broad and will break the twenty year rule quite a bit . 
  the texture of rice on my tongue . 
  in terms of national identity , i 'd say anzac day is the most important day for pakeha , and waitangi for maori . 
  but as a national day , i think it has to be waitangi , no matter who you are . 
  this is the day that everything came together . 
  all our history stems from the treaty . 
  it definitely has n't been a perfect history , although people have tried to whitewash it many times , but it 's our history and it is important . 
  best of all , there have been steps taken in the last forty years to remedy the issues , starting with the creation of the waitangi tribunal . 
  tuhoe 's settlement last year is monumental , and that was one of the biggest grievances in new zealand history . 
  the history is problematic , and the day is symbolic of that , but the fact that after 175 years , we 're still trying , and we 're making progress , is great . 
  it might be slow , but at least it 's happening and it has n't been given up on . 
  so to me , waitangi is a day off . 
  but in the background of my thoughts of `` shit yeah , holiday '' , it 's nice to know we have a day where our history and the indigenous people are recognised , and that the past is remembered rather than hidden away . 
  it got linked over and over years ago , then i saw some amas and started coming to read those . 
  the next was askreddit threads , and then finally , i was linked to askhistorians and i made an account right there and then . 
  she was in middle school and did n't have actual boobs , just the first appearance of them . 
  i do n't know how long it worked for , but `` ok , you stay here , mummy 's going home now ! '', 
  always did the trick when i was real young . 
  what makes it even better is that i saw a toddler bawling his eyes out at the beach the other day after his mum said to him . 
  i cracked up laughing and she caught my eye and said , `` always works ! '', 
  firstly , the bible makes a good source on this . 
  however , it 's only a secondary source , and that 's always best backed up with primary evidence . 
  to that end , i present archaeological evidence from * near eastern archaeology * . 
  onto the good stuff then . 
  contextually , this period in history was a heavily religious time , and ritual was important in this regard , especially with the varying subgroups in religions ( i think the appropriate term is cult , but not in the modern meaning ) . 
  food was thus divided into two groups - that which was regularly consumed , and that which was consumed in keeping with the cultic practices . 
  also important is the idea of food as a cultural concept , which functioned as an identifier of a person 's cultural group - especially in a time without strictly defined borders . 
  with these two points in mind , we can make a list of what was available , and then look at the dietary restrictions of judaism . 
  ** grain **, 
  * was often eaten fresh or roasted . 
  * made into breads and stews/gruels , both of which were healthy options . 
  ** meat **, 
  * meat was not a daily meal for the regular person , but most likely a once weekly food . 
  * domesticated cattle : sheep , goats , cows, 
  * food that was hunted ,, 
  * to deal with the hot temperature of the middle east , milk was often turned into other products as well as being consumed as a drink . 
  * cheese , butter , yogurt were all common , especially with domestic herds at hand . 
  ** fruit **, 
  * figs , pomegranates , grapes , apricots , dates , apples , olives, 
  * berries such as blackberry and black mulberry, 
  ** vegetables **, 
  * * this category is prefaced by the statement `` an important food group that is not well known from the written and archaeological records * . 
  * carrots , cucumbers , musk , watermelon , onion , garlic , dandelion , capers . 
  ** miscellaneous **, 
  * honey as a sweetener, 
  * olive oil, 
  * grasshoppers and locusts, 
  * seasoning such as salt and herbs, 
  * vinegar, 
  the festive occasions are described `` as the entertaining of guests or civic and cultic festival '' . 
  these events would almost certainly have featured meat , with certain cuts being reserved as the best parts of the animal for the guest . 
  nobles ate in finer style than the common folk , as might be expected . 
  sinuhe , who lived several ( read : 19 or so ) centuries before jesus was an egyptian nobleman who ate bread , meat ( both domesticated and desert animals that were hunted ) daily , as well as wine . 
  a final point : obviously not everyone would be able to hunt , or fish , and to this end there were markets where these items were readily available for purchase .

  the history of the n-word is a long one , and its transition from colour descriptor to racial epithet is inextricably linked to the racism of the system of african slavery that was prevalent in america . 
  i 'll start this post by looking at the origins of the word , and its appearance from spanish roots , and then i 'll show how that is tied into the racist culture of slavery in america , and ultimately , the completion of the shift in meaning . 
  the root word from which the n-word springs is the spanish * negro * , meaning black . 
  it was simply that -- a colour . 
  it 's important to remember this , as it had no correlation with the english word negro used to describe black americans . 
  in the sixteenth century , the spanish * negro * was adopted by the english , becoming * neger * , before morphing into the american english n-word sometime later . 
  the first records of the word in america are from 1689 in an estate inventory in the region of modern day brooklyn . 
  my source on this ( at bottom ) , is from 1967 however , and an earlier form occurrence may be known . 
  so now we have the existence of the n-word in american english , and its roots in the spanish word for black . 
  time to focus on the slavery aspect of this , and the racial connotations which now surround the word and how they came in to being . 
  slavery was justified through the belief that blacks were an inferior type of human to whites , and this was backed up with pseudo-scientific proofs such as phrenology ( the measurement of the skull to gauge intelligence and/or moral character ) . 
  in this way africans in america were subdued by whites , and were portrayed as being of lesser intelligence , of lower moral character , and physically built for the manual labour that slavery consisted of . 
  these stereotypes were later followed by others , one example being the image of black people as having heightened sexual appetites -- often uncontrollable -- which led to the fear of interracial rape . 
  these stereotypes were essential to the power dynamics of slavery because they created fear and hatred of the black population . 
  this is where the n-word came in . 
  originating from a word meaning black , it became a catch-all word for black people in america , regardless of their status as a freeman or a slave . 
  rather than describing their colour , it became a * categorising * word , separating them from people and marking them as lesser animals . 
  it dehumanised them , and relegated them to a lower position in life -- that of a subservient labourer . 
  the n-word came with derivatives too . 
  a n-lover was someone who supported the emancipation or rights of black slaves . 
  a n-heaven was the balcony of a theatre during segregation . 
  a n-head was a hard rock , referring to the pseudo-science phrenology and its beliefs that blacks had thicker skulls than whites ( and consequently less room for their brains ) . 
  it was accompanied by other words which retain their derogatory nature today , such as coon . 
  others , like ` boy ' , used to lessen the status of a black slave by implying childlike tendencies , have alternative meanings today , but if used by whites to refer to a black person , will still have their offensive undertones . 
  the offensiveness of the word today is no lesser when used by white people to refer to black , as it still recalls those derogatory origins in slavery , where it was used only to dehumanise and categorise . 
  it has been described as a shared experience for african americans , something they have all gone through , much like all black people in the nineteenth century experienced some form of racism . 
  while the words negro , coloured , and others were all used well into the twentieth century by white and black alike , the n-word was loathed by african americans . 
  an article from 1944 refers to incidents of magazines being boycotted because of their use of the word , of the black upper and middle class abhorring the word even while the lower class used it .
