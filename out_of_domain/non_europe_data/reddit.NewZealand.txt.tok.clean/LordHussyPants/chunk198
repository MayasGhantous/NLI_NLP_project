  why the hell is someone entitled to 6 immortals and 3 rare/super rare/ultra rare immortals for $ 30 , when that 's not even going to unlock 2 immortal iii treasures ? 
  you 're a fucking idiot . 
  at least the other guy had balls to suggest you should actually contribute a decent amount to get the rare items . 
  if you do n't like the compendium game , do n't play it , but paying $ 30 for a rare item is n't going to happen , * because if everyone gets the rare item , it 's not worth $ 30 * . 
  i made a comment on a post about it and i found out the next day my original comment was being linked to someone in another thread because he did n't like what i said . 
  so he went and found more angry people to join him . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  that 's not very rare at all . 
  the complaining has made these into uncommon items . 
  it would fit in nicely with the current theme of reddit users not understanding how rare odds work, 
  they give you things to encourage you to keep playing . 
  valve gives rewards already . 
  there are cm wheel spins , the quest paths , the io and kunkka immortals , and do n't forget there were three chests with 6 regular immortals too which everyone got one of . 
  there 's plenty of loot floating about . 
  it is actually . 
  people think they deserve to win the best prizes because they spent the most money . 
  ** people literally think the chests should be pay to win . 
   what 's next , a female sherlock holmes ? 
  a female james bond ? 
  a female robin hood ? 
  why not ? 
   or maybe a female shakespeare ? 
  historical figure , doctor who is n't real . 
   why not a female king arthur ? 
  sure . 
  but we could also have a story based around boudicca . 
  or any one of the other hundreds of women in history who do n't get recognised for their feats . 
  the problem with your statement is that traditional characters are male . 
  it 's the vast majority of leading characters in western culture . 
  and it 's bullshit that women are pushed to the side , when women achieve so much on their own merits . 
  even your comment that they should have created a female time lord as an ally - that 's tossing her aside . 
  she ca n't be the lead , she has to be a complement to the lead . 
  a companion with more power . 
  i never played wow , but i assume you 're referencing the period of video games where you 'd join a server and see an item and voice chat would explode with `` holy fuck look at that unusual flame effect hat ! '', 
  and yeah , i miss it . 
  would you watch a show about a black woman time lord hopping around the place ? 
  or would you say nah , i 'll pass , because it was a cheap ripoff ? 
  how do you know that ? 
  who told you ? 
  i assume that the reasons she was cast include ( a ) the new exec producer having a professional history with her , ( b ) her having an extensive cv of film and television appearances dating back a decade , ( c ) her having the personality and ability to fit the role , ( d ) her being english . 
  did her being a woman probably play a part ? 
  yes . 
  did ecclestone being a man probably play a part ? 
  yes . 
  * superman *, 
  why do n't you read the hypocrisy of their comments before you defend them ? 
  so you 're saying representation does n't matter ?

  i think jackass did a few like that did n't they ? 
  their pranks were generally really good though because the only people who ever got hurt were themselves ( which were more dares than pranks ) . 
  i wonder if funding played a role too ? 
  shit this is good !, 
  i do n't know why , but i assumed it was kids . 
  jesus christ the mindfuck right now , i thought i missed a vital clue that ursula was phoebe, 
  apparently paying men and women equally does n't bankrupt the employer either , given that friends did 7 more seasons after this bargain was struck . 
  it 's not going to happen this year , or even in 2020 i do n't think . 
  it was just an example situation of why voting greens over labour could have an effect . 
   ** bbc : ** what does it feel like to be the first woman doctor ? 
   ** jodie : ** it feels completely overwhelming , as a feminist , as a woman , as an actor , as a human , as someone who wants to continually push themselves and challenge themselves , and not be boxed in by what you 're told you can and ca n't be . 
  it feels incredible . 
  tennant and capaldi were n't asked a question upon becoming the doctor that would have warranted a response referencing their feminist views . 
  whittaker on the other hand , was pointedly asked what it meant to her to be * the first woman doctor * , so for her to stress how important it was to her as a feminist makes perfect sense . 
  i do n't know what the second part of your comment refers to . 
  next question please . 
  i like to imagine `` a sea of total shits '' says a lot about the children of manchester, 
  allahu akbar just means ` god is great ' . 
  it 's like someone saying ` thank god ' when they find something they 've lost . 
  it 's not an indicator at all . 
  the extremism is * not * islamic in ideology . 
  the extremism is a warped version of islam , and is not reflective of the religion . 
  are you afraid sonny bill williams is going to commit an act of terrorism ? 
  stop conflating extremists with muslims . 
  they have been disavowed by muslims for years , yet people in the west continue to associate the two as if a syrian refugee family poses a risk to anyone in new zealand . 
  uh no it did n't . 
  jodie whittaker is n't replacing the doctor , she * is * the doctor . 
  what the fuck is your problem dude ? 
  the op asked if there was a difference between voting for labour and voting for greens since they 're aligned , and i explained how a vote for one could affect the other . 
  i do n't see the problem there . 
  it 's because she 's really tall ok chill, 
  ( it 's not lol ), 
   the muslims that do terrorist attacks are usually shouting allah u akbar or outright saying `` this is why we did it '' . 
  you said that terrorists who yell allahu akbar are committing attacks because they 're muslim . 
  that 's . 
  not . 
  true . 
  allahu akbar is something that every muslim in the entire fucking world says at prayer . 
  every fucking christian in the world says amen after they pray , because it means the same fucking thing . 
  so tell me again , why the fuck is someone who 's blowing themselves up , and saying a little prayer for courage , representative of muslims ? 
  if you ship me jaffa cakes i 'll collect all your favourite porn for you and send it through . 
  generally there are n't witnesses to remote detonations , because they do n't want to get caught . 
  why is right wing terrorists in quotemarks ? 
  no one is saying that , but you 're putting more emphasis on one religion shaping terrorism than another , and that 's blatantly false . 
  how much did 2600 levels set you back ? 
  i 've got a brother , but he 's well out of childhood so he 'll be harder to retrain . 
  reckon that 'll do ? 
  so the neediest people in our country are taxed 70 % on part of their welfare payment , while the richest are taxed 33 % on their $ 150,000 ? 
  the people i worked with and knew in those types of jobs all seemed to be national voters :\\, 
  the changes metiria is proposing will make it easier for families to get back to work .
