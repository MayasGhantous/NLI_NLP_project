  i 'm not overweight mate , not even close . 
  apparently i 'm just more alert to the fact that we have a lot of aging gps who are set in their opinions about fat people . 
  in this case it seems they all turned on the cop too . 
  oh and he was muslim . 
  and black . 
  the way you said this means you probably do n't realise that everyone outside the us uses measuring cups too . 
  but we weigh our solids because guessing how much a cup of chopped chocolate is going to weight is difficult . 
  and speaking of the merits , every single cup of chopped chocolate is going to weigh differently because chopped is such a subjective measure . 
  is it chopped finely , thickly , all the way to crumbs ? 
  is it just swept into the cup , or is it stacked neatly to get the most in possible ? 
  a large chunk will throw off the measurement . 
  weighing is much more accurate . 
  which makes it even ballsier because you took 30 % more damage from all sources . 
  `` oh no fire , fire !, 
  get out ! '', 
  `` no wait dude , we 're ok , look , not burning '', 
  `` oh - lag lag get out we are '', 
  [ we really care about comp over casual now ? 
  yeah it does n't have to be unique for every spell , just touch up what he already has . 
  i think he was saying that `` white ** christian ** cop '' would n't make it in . 
  they 'll have cop , or white cop , but they 'd never drop christian in . 
  a few of the front page cop shootings in the last year or two were committed by non-white cops . 
   he entered a home on a welfare check because the person 's ** sister ** was worried about her . 
  found the connection boys !, 
  a sister is codeword for a * woman * !, 
  i love that the top comment on that post is some armchair investigator telling everyone that they were likely raped and murdered rather than got lost and died . 
  if cops over here get a call about something like this , all the schools in the area are notified and it 's on the nightly news for a night or two to keep everyone more alert . 
   if valve can release a companion cube io arcana , i 'm pretty sure they can make an even better arcana for rubick, 
  stack of companion cubes confirmed, 
  you 've been playing on the same laptop for two years ? 
  have you formatted and cleaned up all the crap you 've probably accumulated over time ? 
  that sounds more like a computer issue than the game . 
  n-er is the historic word with all the baggage that comes along with it . 
  n-a is the slang word adopted by the black community in an attempt to claim the word for themselves and diminish its power . 
  n-er is generally considered unacceptable anywhere , and by anyone . 
  calling someone that is invoking its entire history - slavery , scientific racism , the idea that black people are biologically and inherently less than white people . 
  the other is the equivalent of bro , mate , buddy , whatever . 
  but it 's still intrinsically linked to the historical version , and that 's why it 's considered unacceptable for non-black people to use it . 
  when a black person says it , e.g. 
  in a song , or among friends , they 're speaking to a communally shared history and culture , and referencing that reclamation of the word . 
  when a white person uses it , that awareness of the history and power of the word is n't present , which is why it 's inappropriate . 
  if you find a black friend who says you can say n-a , then go for it i guess . 
  but i would n't recommend saying it outside of that relationship . 
  think of it like `` no one can harass my sibling but me . '', 
  everyone speculates on their health . 
  but when someone offers me unsolicited advice on mine , i usually tell them to fuck off . 
  why 's it anyone 's business ? 
  that 's super awkward to watch , he looks so uncomfortable with jimmy right from the start . 
  grrm made a pact ? 
  or are fans just demanding and entitled ? 
  people tell him to hurry up and write or else he 's going to die , as if it 's there business . 
  that would be advising him on his health . 
  so entitled . 
   what 's the craziest thing you 've seen an employee do ? 
  i 'd say walking in on your employee lying naked in a pool of his puke with shite streaming out his arse is pretty crazy, 
  i 'm sincerely hoping your relationship with your wife is different to that of an author and his fans . 
  what on earth makes you think he thinks he 's invincible ? 
  the guy 's probably very well aware of his mortality and just gets annoyed at man-children who tell him he 's constantly about to shuffle off . 
  you 're not owed a series . 
  he 's writing books , and what he finishes , you get . 
  he could write the final two books and give them to a lawyer with the instruction that the manuscripts not be published until 2050 and you literally would n't have a leg to stand on . 
  writing a book and saying `` i plan for it to be a series '' is not a contract , and if was any contract , it certainly would n't be with you . 
  most people wipe down a seat after they use it , or before hand if it 's looking a bit dirty . 
  this guy probably had a really clean toilet rim all the time , so it 's not that ew . 
  the bad bit is if he ever used public bathrooms . 
  there was a kid who did this at my school when he was like 5 ? 
  i would have been 7 . 
  it 's always stuck in my head as being such a weird thing for someone to do , even though he was only 5 . 
  ok i hate to be the beat this guy , but i used to work with a woman who was the loveliest , kindest , most sharing person around . 
  she 'd always have snacks with her too , the absolute best type of coworker . 
  so one day she jumps out of the elevator with me , and she 's got a giant pizza box with her , and she sets off down the hall towards the kitchen . 
  i tell her i 'll just go to my cubicle to grab my phone , and then i 'll come grab some pizza , because who does n't want free pizza right ? 
  well i go to my desk , start walking back , and she walks out of the bathroom right in front of me * with the pizza box in hand * . 
  then my friend walks out behind her , pulling a face , before pulling me aside and saying * she was eating it in the cubicle while going to the bathroom . 
  and that was the day i stopped accepting food from people if i did n't watch them open it myself . 
  pie ? 
  i said wipe it down , not clean it . 
  like run toilet paper over it to wipe up any water that might have splashed up onto the seat , or any sweat . 
  i keep going until it 's coated through the hair up my spine so it looks like i have a chocolatey brown tail, 
  * big trouble in little china * . 
  it stars kurt russell and kim cattrall , both looking mighty fine . 
  it 's directed by john carpenter who also did * the thing * and * escape from new york * . it 's the perfect example of an 80s action film , with a healthy dose of mystical fantasy tossed in . 
  it 's a fucking glorious movie and i ca n't explain why , you 'll just have to watch it . 
  when you do , you can then take this awesome wallpaper and set it as your desktop so you 'll always be reminded of the fucking legend that is jack burton . 
  i have an english friend who had lived in new zealand for awhile , and her accent had bottomed out so to speak . 
  she did n't sound english a lot of the time . 
  she went travelling for a bit , and that included a stint in england before home to auckland . 
  when i saw her the first thing i told her was that her accent was really strong now , and she laughed and said time back in manchester made it spring up again . 
  she then went on to say that the worst part of it was that she could n't use the word cunt anymore , because while the kiwi accent makes it sound almost charming , a manchester accent makes it sound like you 're about to bash someone 's head in . 
  she was absolutely gutted . 
  it 's amazing . 
  like , thinking that having your butt hanging out at the urinal is normal . 
  i 'll wipe a clean looking public seat . 
  fuck knows what 's been there . 
  [ this guy sat on one and someone had put super glue on it . 
  ] ( http://www.news.com.au/national/cairns-man-cut-free-after-toilet-seat-glue-prank/news-story/f2e5d8ccefaa49feaaf305cc62aada78 ), 
  i never understood how someone does this ? 
  why are you zipping up before your dick 's in your underpants ? 
  you going commando ? 
  yeah , i just ca n't do that , it feels weird .
