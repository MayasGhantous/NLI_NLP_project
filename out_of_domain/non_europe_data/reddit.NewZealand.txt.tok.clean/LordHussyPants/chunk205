  and i understand why , because you ca n't just have a hot seat system where a player leaves and a new one is funnelled in , but it makes it so much harder to deal with feeders , or people who are abusive , or anything like that , because while you can mute them , you still have to play it out to the end . 
  and when i 've complained before and people have said `` chill out !, 
  it 's just a game ! '', 
  yeah , but a game is meant to be fun dude , and i 've got time for one game tonight before i have to go , so i 'd really like it to not be ruined by you having a tantrum at your support and feeding the tower for 10 minutes . 
   instead of proving someone wrong , try saying something like : `` thats the beauty of dota , everything is possible in the hands of the right players , '' or `` that 's a valuable opinion that definitely merits consideration . '', 
  we just want cohesion amongst the casters . 
  hi , this is greg from valve . 
  would you liek to come to ti7 as an analyst thanks greg from valve, 
  what sort of insane lack of awareness do you need to think it 's a good idea to walk between people with headphones and people with cameras , and then to get angry about being called out on it, 
  love my war dog . 
  and people used to give such nice comments about it too . 
  everyone is invisible in the grass in the final circles . 
  everyone is visible in the grass at a distance in the larger circles . 
  a moving player is very easy to see already . 
  a stationary player is very hard to see already . 
  what would camo change about any of these ? 
  why did you bother to type up an entire response telling me why we have no leave policies when i said i know why ? 
   and i have to wonder ... what are these `` other '' games where you can leave nilly willy ? 
  is it a comsole thing ? 
  literally any game with a non-competitive mode ? 
  battlefield ? 
  overwatch will find you a new quickplay game immediately . 
  rocket league ? 
  and then a car zips past seconds later as you prone in your fresh ghillie suit . 
  literally pay to lose !, 
  wait you were arguing against doc being banned ? 
  the hell is happening ? 
  this is a lot of rage for what i 've seen happen , so there must be something i missed, 
  circles confirmed to be broken !, 
  implementing squares !, 
  this is the best glitch i 've seen yet and the montage of your life as a pet is fantastic . 
  think it 's meant to look like it 's abandoned and sitting on a pile of dirt , but the dirt pile is n't big enough . 
  you 've never watched his snapchat have you ? 
  dude works out constantly , and i think i now know why, 
  i agree but dota is crazy enjoyable when it goes well , or even is just a close match . 
  and how insane it must be for a black child to hear `` oh , it happened so long ago '' and then see on the news that no , this sort of thing still happens !, 
  and all the videos we get of white middle aged people losing their shit and cursing out non-english speakers or people that do n't fit their image of american . 
  it 's fucking depressing . 
  i think there 's a marked difference between doubting people would be stupid enough to elect the most unqualified person to ever run for office and doubting that the military would just go full coup mode . 
  i do n't leave games , and i think i 've only had one game this year where someone fed intentionally but they were on the other side . 
  but i disagree on the toxicity thing because i 've seen it at every level i 've played at , and spectated . 
  hell , i 've watched 5k and 8k games today with a player who harassed people the exact same way i see people doing in 2k and 3k games . 
  yes . 
  that 's not a contradiction . 
  the specific sentence part of the video i was responding to was n't rude . 
  my point was that i 've seen this behaviour at every level of the game : i.e. 
  toxicity is n't dictated by your perfect behaviour score , because everyone is getting some of it . 
  it makes all the sense in the world if you have a basic understanding of manners and social behaviour . 
  nahaz is on a stream about dota 2 ( valve made game ) , with dota 2 tournament talent ( valve employees ) , being watched by dota 2 fans ( valve customers ) , and he is acting like a 15 year old nice guy with a crush on the cutest girl at school . 
  grant : i 'm actively trying to get to ti . 
  i do n't know about nahaz ? 
  nahaz : i 'd like to but . . 
  valve . . [ * laughs as if it 's nothing * ] valve is not going to magically start to like me at this point , sooo ... [ * makes exaggerated hand movements and grimaces * ], 
  ppd : i think you 'd be surprised man . 
  i think if you put your head down and worked hard . 
  all of this ? 
  all of this was well deserved . 
  nahaz is badmouthing valve to their talent , in front of their customers , while talking about their product . 
  it 's ** exactly ** why they do n't want him , because he does n't have a filter and does n't know what is and is n't appropriate to say . 
  peter points that out and someone had to . 
  nahaz 's reaction is so stupidly incredulous , despite everyone on that call and in the stream knowing peter is right , so for peter to continue and tell him that yeah , he 's a mong on twitter ? 
  fair enough . 
  a bit rude , but fuck , he needed to be told . 
  literally hundreds of idiots then, 
   although , i 'm 30 , and my profession is helping teams improve the way they work together , so i guess i have a slight bias !, 
  however i 've ditched the grind for 6 months so maybe i am the zen guru, 
  jesus mate , you 're like a pro positivity guy , you do n't get a say here !, 
  but really , i do n't find it fun in that situation for two reasons . 
  firstly , because i do n't think an individual performance is rewarded or feels worthy . 
  i could go 20-0 in a game and lose because someone fed mid non-stop and i would n't be happy with my 20-0 because it was all for nothing . 
  you do n't get mmr from individual scores , commends are irrelevant , and kills are kind of meaningless . 
  the only thing that really matters is a win , and if i ca n't get that out of it , i 'm annoyed . 
  secondly , because of the way the game works ( xp and gold advantages ) , the balance is way out . 
  in other games a personal performance can feel satisfying , and can swing a game far quicker than a good dota performance can . 
  dota is just too delicately balanced . 
  when a carry balls out of control , they suddenly have more levels than you , and better items , and better income . 
  it 's not like other games where everyone is on a level playing field , e.g. 
  fps games where you pick up a kit . 
  so once you get to that point , it 's kind of like being dropped in an open field in front of a sniper and you only have a knife . 
  i just ca n't have fun when it 's completely fruitless to try and achieve any game objectives . 
  from that point on , i 'd rather just leave but i do n't like to abandon . 
  and that means 20-30 minutes of horrific drawn out play , because you still have to defend or else you abandon for lack of xp . 
  oo , with the pointy bits !, 
  how about a star ? 
  you could camp at the middle bits where the arms meet , and hit people coming in from multiple sectors . 
   alaskan regulatory issues which require support from the federal government , including ** permission to expand oil drilling in the national petroleum reserve , may now not be approved ** , it is feared . 
  does n't actually sound all bad . 
  you used false equivalencies and resorted to name calling . 
  you were still wrong . 
  they 'll jump in to defend any cop 's behaviour , while dropping lovely lines like `` if it comes out as a bad shoot , he should be fired , but he 's innocent until proven guilty ! '', 
  which is fair enough , except for all the cop shoots where someone was n't presumed innocent , because they were holding a toy gun , or they were unable to breathe through a choke hold , or they were reaching for a wallet they were told to reach for . 
  i said that a jury are n't experts in the law , and a mod called me a moron and banned me . 
  they really do n't like being called on their bullshit . 
  i feel like the floor of walmart might be more sanitary than the bathroom . 
   then the name was hijacked by those cunts, 
  excuse you, 
  you might like to mention that the fire occurred during a period of colonisation by the english , and was n't an accident . 
  mccain voted for ** debate ** the other day , so that a bill would go through a proper political process . 
  he got reamed for it . 
  then he gave a speech saying he would n't vote for a bill that he did n't agree with .
