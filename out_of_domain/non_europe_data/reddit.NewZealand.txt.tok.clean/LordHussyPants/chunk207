  one who believes the jewish financial conspiracy no less !, 
  which makes me wonder if he only put in the bit about `` cries of antisemitism '' as a shitty pre-emptive attempt at disclaiming his idiotic stance . 
  pretty sure a maccas ad would have one of their drinks in it rather than a bottle of wine . 
  also there are three glasses on the table , which means at least two people eating ( one could be for the driver ) , so there are a lot of food options they could have on display which are n't in this pic . 
  the keyboard is n't blocking the wine bottle label ... 
  looks like you 've had a whole heap of advice , so you 're set . 
  i just wanted to ask though ... why do you need hot water for the washing machine ? 
  i was just confused because i 've never used a hot water wash . 
  it seemed like a waste of money . 
  i 've never thought of it being useful like that tbh , i always go for a handwash when the stain is lasting through washing machine cycles . 
  will keep this in mind !, 
  in text referencing is trash , chicago and footnotes for eternity . 
  mate , right click your bookmarks and edit that shit . 
  there 's no need for this messy ` netflix - google search ' fluff . 
  rubbish , a properly footnoted paper is as beautiful as a thurston finals kick, 
  those rooms are awesome !, 
  waaay better than bar karaoke . 
  korea does that shit well . 
  dvd bangs are another awesome idea i wish the west had . 
  was probably andrew himself ay , this could be a whole sneaky plan !, 
  putting it down to money is disingenuous . 
  hone 's alliance with internet was an attempt to tap into a different group of voters which , if he had won te tai tokerau , would have given him a lot more seats on the party vote than he would have got otherwise . 
  if she resigned now she 'd kill the party she 's been a member of for 20 years . 
  i 've actually wondered over time if it 's true , because being pm means a greater focus on broader issues , and she seems to want to focus on youth and children rather than taking it all on . 
  he 's not going to change the game-plan too drastically , because that 's what took them from bottom of the table to champions in a matter of seasons . 
  he 'd be stupid to try and play a different style that does n't work with our strengths, 
  that 's 44 years after the coup . 
  i think the doubts are about the immediate period following . 
   name one nation that came to be through completely peaceful means . 
  switzerland, 
  you 're right , i just yelled out a neutral country . 
  by the way , ` progress through corpses ' does n't include defending against imperialist invaders . 
   you mean the economic miracle that happened once pinochet liberalized the market again ? 
  the economic miracle that heightened inequality in the country ? 
  great stuff . 
   pinochet was a dick, 
  murdered 3,000 people , tortured ten times that number , and imprisoned 80,000 or more ? 
  yeah i suppose he was . 
   pick between him and a socialist dictatorship, 
  hmm , a neoliberal capitalist dictator , or an elected socialist president , hmmmm, 
  dunno , how many people have been illegally imprisoned in venezuela , or thrown out of helicopters ? 
  thanks , i pointed out in another response that it was a joke bc switzerland is neutral, 
  tell that to the first nations . 
  wait why is it ok to report someone for `` stealing a lane '' how is it his lane lmao, 
  god damn stream sniping dacias, 
  anthony and grimmz have both said that 's why they do it , and that while they realise stream sniping 's a problem for some streamers , they do n't think it happens to them . 
  * ca n't be poor if you 're dead *, 
  the immediate period was 17 years of pinochet ( who was a military dictator ) . 
  germany was one in the thirties , now it leads europe . 
  should we have a holocaust every century to find the new leader , or should we maybe act like decent fucking people ? 
  ten from now it 'll be `` 19 famous actors you did n't recognise in their cameos in * the mandarin candidate * '', 
  it is !, 
  collusion is teamwork !, 
  keith holyoake ( reform/national ) , ran the family farm from age 12 with his mother , became mp at age 28 . 
  mike moore ( labour ) , worked as labourer , elected to auckland trades council aged 17 , elected to parliament aged 23 . 
  helen clark ( labour ) , worked as a politics lecturer , elected to parliament aged 31 . 
  jacinda 's been working in politics for 20 years . 
  president of the international union of socialist youth , worked in policy overseas and in new zealand , been an mp for 9 years . 
  john key had no political experience at all . 
  jacinda has twenty years . 
  what 's your problem ? 
  i mean , the guy is arguing that there 's no victory coming from skill or strategy , but that 's simply not true . 
  find multiple cars . 
  camp before the bridge and collect meds so you can tank the blue and cross later . 
  find a boat earlier , rather than rushing to find it at the eleventh hour . 
  skill and strategy involves planning ahead for the final circle , not just reacting to each new adjustment as it pops up . 
  flavour of the week is grimmz hate . 
  the flies were good and are a lot more subtle than birds . 
  wandering around in the dark trying to find someone 's body and listening for the buzzing was hectic . 
  i would n't mind those being implemented . 
  well , now i can cross the nsfw subs off my to do list for tonight . 
   i also do n't know why we deserve a statement from valve . 
  if we do n't deserve something then something is wrong, 
  the all-star match is n't going to be won by the casters jumping in as usual , it 's going to be the ice agents rappelling from the ceiling to arrest the non-americans ( and some of the brown americans ) . 
  dota is the arts . 
  esports is a term used because of the leverage it holds , not because it 's a sport . 
  holy fuck what a scumbag, 
  some people are quite attached to their limbs , even when they 're diseased and amputated . 
  yeah because 0 is nothing , so you can just take it away whenever you like, 
  what is ads ? 
  keep seeing it referenced, 
  i had a 15x once , and i spent most of that game looking across the strait from military and the other side was just a fuzzy blur . 
  so you can miss 179 when you go 1v1, 
  starting to get a bit angry at overwatch and jeff for consistently releasing updates that do n't do anything to annoy me . 
  this positivity is bad for my laugh lines guys . 
  so it 's iron sights ? 
  or is it holding right click and getting the semi zoom in ? 
  the ship was the ms st. louis , named for the city in america . 
  when it was turned away they returned to europe where the refugees were homed in several different countries . 
  during the war around a quarter of the people on the ship died in the death camps . 
  [ there 's a twitter account ] ( https://twitter.com/stl_manifest ) that worked its way through the ship manifest , memorialising the names of the dead .
