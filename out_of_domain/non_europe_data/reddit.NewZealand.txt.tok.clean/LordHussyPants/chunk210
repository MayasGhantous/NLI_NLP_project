  it 's inherently negative . 
  which is different to someone asking `` how is that stupid ? '', 
  which is a neutral statement at worst . 
  people can be triggered by all sorts of things , yes . 
   literally any joke `` could be a trigger '' for someone out there , so if you are a principled , consistent individual you 'd have to stop joking entirely . 
  or you could just be responsible with what you say and use a little bit of consideration and empathy . 
  a rape joke ? 
  bad . 
  a muffin joke ? 
  sure !, 
  going through a glass door is a horrific experience . 
  i 'm guessing you 've never done it if you 're willing to make criticisms about pu suggesting it could trigger bad memories . 
  agree entirely . 
  but once again , i 'll point out that he 's got fox doing one thing and two or three others doing far worse . 
  it 's just a mess of a list . 
  you would n't put hitler at 25 and say he improved germany 's economy , while having stalin at 39 for murdering millions . 
  it 's just silly . 
  exactly , and it 's impossible to have a line that suits everyone , which is where trigger warnings and empathy come into it . 
  personally i do n't understand the fear around people using warnings . 
  we have them for films and tv shows and music already . 
  yeah it 's not hard to say `` oh sorry '' and move on . 
  i do n't know what trigger warnings you 're looking at are , but generally they 're quite specific : racism , sexism , ableism , violence , gore , etc. 
  we put nsfw on reddit posts . 
  are they pointless because they 're applied both to a picture of a man being cut in half and to a joke that references sex ? 
  you 're wrong . 
  i was just using them as an example of something people who get too easily wound up about , just as they do when they hear trigger . 
  nsfw is exactly the same as a content/trigger warning . 
  it 's saying `` stop !, 
  you should consider what content you 're about to view ! '', 
  it 's the same as an r16 label on a movie , an explicit lyrics label on a cd , or a warning that an art exhibit could trigger a seizure . 
  i never said doc 's comment needed a warning , i just asked why it was stupid for pu to respond with a comment that people might feel uncomfortable with it . 
  i did n't dodge the question . 
  i gave you an answer . 
  i told you to use empathy . 
  orange flair day in here ay !, 
  i 'm white too , and i 'm a kiwi , so i 'm far removed from your education system . 
  on the other hand , i think this might help me because i only learned american history at university , when it was taught to me by americans who had a specific focus on marginalised groups . 
  my personal interest in black history is the civil rights movement , and i 'd be using that as my starting point for black history . 
  someone else ( / u/irishpatobie i think ? ), 
  replied saying that the best way to do it is to incorporate african americans into the general history of the us , and i wholeheartedly agree . 
  with that in mind , i 'd suggest charles payne 's book * time longer than rope * , which looks at the idea of a long civil rights movement that extends beyond the traditional 1954-1974 . 
  in reality , the civil rights movement is ongoing today with blm , and began back during slavery . 
  i 'm not sure how your curriculum works , but american history is so large that i 'd still suggest you try and pick different areas to look at . 
  when you get to a civil rights module , you could use the long movement narrative and then point to other modules to trace the progress ( or lack thereof ) . 
  you could also teach it alongside other modules i suppose . 
  my one request would be that you look at the importance of african american churchwomen in the black community . 
  they were the foundation for the grassroots networks that made the 20th century civil rights movement happen , and all too often they 're pushed aside in favour of mlk and the other church leaders . 
  why would she create a new problem when she already admitted to the first one last week ? 
  why would she lie about this when she 's been painfully truthful in her admissions ? 
  i mean , use common sense . 
  it 's not hard . 
  maybe i should add social awareness . 
  people need to think about the audience . 
  you do n't make a joke about readying the harpoons when you 're in the work lunchroom with an obese person . 
  but this is the internet , so people will do as they do . 
  and when they do , they should n't be annoyed when someone else calls them out for acting like a fuckwit . 
  because that 's what they 're doing . 
  we all enjoy our anonymity , but some people go too far . 
  not if the am is any good . 
  he can be good in the context of 1k . 
  which of them applied to john key when he lived in parnell but registered at an address that was under construction in helensville ? 
  that makes sense . 
  but again , why are we all assuming metiria is lying when she 's been truthful so far ? 
  i 'm loving it . 
  if i want to feel good about myself i just come to reddit dot com slash r slash dota 2 and watch the fireworks, 
  got ta link to a lumi clip , would like to hear what 's so bad, 
  why does it matter that it 's her mother ? 
  so pumped that naga has been picked as a support , ca n't wait to return to the days of 2013 and getting told by the riki picker that naga 's a support only and i 'm getting reported for trying to play her as a carry !, 
  thank !, 
  lol, 
  i 'll contest this one . 
  when did you get diagnosed ? 
  what have you done every day since then ? 
  you 're an inspiration because you 've confronted something that has such a monumental effect on your life , and you 're still here . 
  if i imagine getting cancer , i think i 'd just curl up in a ball somewhere and cry . 
  and sure , you might have done that a bit . 
  a lot . 
  you might have done that on 99 % of days . 
  but that 1 % ? 
  that one day where you said `` fuck it , today i 'm doing something for me , and not for cancer ! '', 
  that 's bravery . 
  and it 's inspiring . 
  i realise this might also feel like a load of pressure to take , but you do n't have to be brave . 
  you do n't need to be inspiring . 
  please do n't add to your burdens . 
  millions upon millions of people have n't been in the course of history . 
  it 's normal to be scared . 
  just keep doing what you need to , for you . 
  ** gabe : ** hey anyone know where the $ 23mil from my international fund has gone ? 
  ** marketing : ** um, 
  has n't confessed to her welfare sins yet . 
  ... and what if metiria 's mother was struggling too , and they were living together to try and make ends meet ? 
  an interesting fact about * brown v. board * is that although some people like to bring it up and say that 's when segregation ended , it 's not quite true . 
  when the court handed down their decision , they said that the states were to desegregate with ` all deliberate speed ' . 
  as you can see , there is n't a date on there , or a time limit . 
  it 's very vague . 
  the result was that it took quite a while after 1954 for segregation to actually disappear . 
  so you 're saying it 's unacceptable for the leader of a party to lie to the government , take tax payer 's money , and remain in their political position ? 
  the work that people did to achieve and protect progress is absolutely phenomenal . 
  me opening the thread : now what ?
