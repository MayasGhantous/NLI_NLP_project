  in case you missed it , the experts called examples of coercion ** rare ** and ** exceptional ** as in hardly ever . 
  got a verse ? 
  boboka 's doing the work of 10 supports and it 's great watching, 
   i meant the jiyza tax when applied following the muslim conquests, 
   it was a cudgel to convert anyone who was n't muslim ; either they paid the tax or they would be killed . 
  this is blatantly false . 
  you 're the third or fourth person to reply to me telling me that the quran asks for apostates to be killed . 
  can you show me a verse from the quran that says that ? 
  no one else can . 
  my position is that metiria was advocating for people who can face that choice every day of winter when they have to choose if they spend money on power or food . 
  metiria told her story from a platform she was lucky enough to have . 
  would her daughter have died ? 
  probably not , but i do n't know for certain . 
  but it also does n't benefit anyone to have people who are just trying to protect their families and survive be demonised for doing anything they can . 
  i do n't know why people do n't get this , but the jizya tax was not used to coerce followers . 
  muslim conquerors did n't want people to convert to islam , and were perfectly fine leaving christians and jews to practice their faith as long as they kept it private and followed the law in non-religious parts of their lives . 
  also the fact that esports are n't sports and would be better placed in a context of mental prowess like chess and similar . 
  fuck i was supporting burning and ig but now i 'm listening to kpii and i kinda want a familiar accent to win, 
  there 's an aussie in og too ? 
  no shit , we need to get a kiwi up there and have an anzac final at ti8, 
  brb improving my dota , only 5k to go until i 'm ti8 ready, 
  `` super is a really average player '', 
  yes . 
  a heavier burden in ** the immediate aftermath ** , i.e. 
  the adapting period where they were figuring out what to do . 
  the bulk of modern scholarship has been that it was not used to coerce people , and that 's shown by the second paragraph which says people converted more for social status than to avoid the tax . 
  i meant compel rather than coerce , but the point stands . 
  i do n't have books on me , but go find a book on islam and it will tell you that the tax was not used to force conversion ( of course there were exceptions ,, 
  there always are ) , and that muslims were happy to have jews and christians live alongside them . 
  i said `` there is no compulsion in islam '' , i did n't say no one in the history of the religion ever bent that . 
  [ compulsion existed in rare and exceptional cases .

  why do n't they just send a couple of tons of baking soda first to neutralise it, 
  treaty promised m\u0101ori would retain possession of their land and taonga . 
  that includes the waterways , it includes the foreshore . 
  she is n't the poster child , she does n't want to be the poster child , she wants the public to recognise there 's an issue and try to amend it with their vote . 
  second article of the treaty . 
   her majesty the queen of england confirms and guarantees to the chiefs and tribes of new zealand and to the respective families and individuals thereof the full exclusive and undisturbed possession of their lands and estates forests ** fisheries ** and other properties which they may collectively or individually possess ** so long as it is their wish and desire to retain the same in their possession ** ; but the chiefs of the united tribes and the individual chiefs yield to her majesty the ** exclusive right of preemption over such lands as the proprietors thereof may be disposed to alienate ** at such prices as may be agreed upon between the respective proprietors and persons appointed by her majesty to treat with them in that behalf . 
  the sea was a food source for m\u0101ori , and their rights there have been recognised already through the fishery quotas that m\u0101ori have , so there is precedent . 
  they were entitled to them for as long as they wanted , etc. 
  self explanatory . 
  crown pre-emption . 
  this meant the crown got first dibs on anything m\u0101ori decided to sell . 
  it was meant for land really , because the government wanted to control that . 
  by putting the foreshore and seabed under a land title , the government legitimised it , and made it into land . 
  under the treaty , that land could not be bought by the crown until m\u0101ori decided to sell it . 
  you got ta connect the highbeams, 
  only reason i opened this thread . 
  cars are impossible to see on a hot day when they 're more than 2km out on a long stretch of flat road . 
  the heat haze fucks your vision , but lights will stand out . 
  i 'm going to ignore everything you said ( because it 's mostly shite ) and point out this bit :, 
   what matters is what is * fair * . 
  an agreement was made , and terms were agreed to , and it was signed in good faith . 
  everything should adhere to the treaty . 
  if you do n't like it , you can shut up , or you could leave . 
  but p\u0101keh\u0101 presence in new zealand is founded upon that document , and nothing you say or do can change that . 
  yeah but at least a 2k rubick who ca n't throw a hook can steal something else . 
  pudge is shit no matter what . 
  lifestealer meta incoming, 
  does he roll out of the pit for the default distance , or does he drop another pillar and roll through that ? 
  i watched it on .25 speed and it looks like he calls one down * after * he starts the roll , but i did n't if know that was possible ? 
  ### it 's a snatch, 
  cut = hurt, 
   i only jumped on the pubg train yesterday, 
  so you 've missed several weeks of fps fans telling everyone else that they 're lacking in skill for liking third person . 
  lmao the ending, 
  low mmr pudge will rot and feed , rubick will use his bolt to kill steal but it 'll lower attack damage too, 
  damn , y' all need to learn some boundaries, 
  i thought [ `` he snatches it !, 
  '' ] ( https://clips.twitch.tv/prettyadventurouselephantheyguys ) would be a pretty good one too !, 
  when / u/jpallan said more than your average grunt , i suspect she meant in terms of intelligence . 
  sorry , fixed !, 
  this is a rubbish point of view that reddit takes in all walks of life , and for some reason i assumed it would be different in this sub . 
  it 's not for the sake of diversity at all . 
  diversity makes the game better , makes the game richer in skill , and grows it exponentially . 
  how many peruvians just realised they have a chance to not only go to ti , but to win $ 100k + , hell , to even analyse and sit alongside merlini ? 
  why ? 
  chinese dota is awesome . 
  a worker holding one back is n't greedy . 
  not controlling other people is stupid though . 
  `` and we can hear the chatter starting up again , let 's see if we can hear what they 're saying . '', 
  honestly , it 's ridiculous . 
  that was such a well done game . 
  but this is n't ti4 . 
  but presenting a series from 3 years ago as a reason to dislike that possibility this year is stupid . 
  * pop *, 
  * pop *, 
  * pop *, 
  yeah i was waiting for him to drop an entering battle voice line like `` the age of ice begins ! '', 
  and then one of their holographs pops up . 
  maybe we 'll get that on sunday ? 
  so carries love life , but supports are dead inside . 
  mike brown ? 
  they care about salaries , not wages . 
  nice way to skip the context . 
   humans are a part of nature and our social world is part of the environment as much as the native forest is . 
  we 're part of this world , not some separate thing , and the relationships we have between one another and with the rest of life are all part of the same thing . 
  he 's saying you ca n't separate the environment from caring for people . 
  unpopular opinion time . 
  i really enjoyed it how it was .
