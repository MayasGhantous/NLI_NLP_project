  one style of eyes . 
  the hair is changed up to try and find a proper african look . 
  and every single one of them is wearing a minstrel suit . 
  [ hey look , this lot are a fucking minstrel band . 
  ] ( https://verawoodhead.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/golliwog.jpg ), 
  the rag dolls you posted had diversity . 
  even in the most simplified form of portraying white people through dolls , the differences are celebrated . 
  yet the golliwogs all look exactly the same as if black people somehow lack features that distinguish them from each other . 
  there was a really good article in the guardian about this the other day . 
  the basic premise was that facts ca n't be racist , but that the way they 're used can be . 
  in the case of rotherham for example , all the suspects were of pakistani origin , and the `` fact '' became that pakistanis were out searching for english girls . 
  problem is , that 's only true in the case of the 1,000 or so pakistanis who were connected with the case . 
  1,000 is a huge number for a sex ring though , right ? 
  but there are 1.2 million pakistanis in england . 
  that 1,000 is less than 0.1 of a percent of the total pakistani population in england , yet people are muttering about `` pakistanis like to rape english girls '' because that 's the only thing they connect with pakistanis . 
  it 's ignorance , pure and simple . 
  and the person might not be racist to say that , but it is a racist thing to say . 
  just like that guy in the video who got asked not to steal the white kid 's gear , or the ones who said they knew white kids telling people to stay out of south auckland because of pacific islanders and maori . 
  6th row . 
  african american barbie . 
  also , this is a bad comparison to make . 
  the classic barbie is blond and white skinned , but they do make barbie dolls of different ethnicities . 
  golliwogs are * only * black , and even then , do n't come in different types . 
  raggedy ann has a nose , eyelashes , cheek blush , heavily detailed eyes , and even eyebrows . 
  my original point , that golliwogs are simplistic , and generalistic representations stands . 
  they have basic eyes , and the heavy red lips . 
  a lot of the responses seem to focus on the storybook character , without looking at the context in which the character was created . 
  upton , the creator , was born in 1873 , and drew this in the late 1880s/early 1890s . 
  it definitely was an era of racist depictions , and this is one of them . 
   a product of the blackface minstrel tradition , the golliwogg had jet black skin ; bright , red lips ; and wild , woolly hair . 
  he wore red trousers , a shirt with a stiff collar , red bow-tie , and a blue jacket with tails -- all traditional minstrel attire . 
   the golliwog contributed enormously to the spread of blackface iconography in europe . 
  i do n't know where he got the slave doll idea from , but i 've never seen anything to suggest that . 
  yeah , it was an extremely popular and much loved character . 
  that does n't mean that it 's not racist . 
  think of the context of the time this was created in to see how it 's acceptable , and it 's easier to see how it 's offensive now . 
  the cartoons it was based on are racially insensitive . 
  pretty much says it all . 
  and the character is still based on minstrel shows . 
  when a white kid says to a maori kid , `` hey , can you not steal my stuff while i go to the bathroom . 
  '' , he 's implying that the natural act of the maori kid is to steal . 
  he 's saying that maori are naturally thieves . 
  when a samoan girl is told , `` wow , you 're really smart for a samoan !, 
  '' , it 's implying that samoans are n't expected to be smart or do well in school . 
  it 's racist because it 's ranking someone based on their race into a hierarchy of intelligence , or criminal leanings . 
  no race is predisposed to be smarter than others , or more athletic . 
  no , it 's still racist , and the person who is promoting that view is being racist . 
  if they do n't intend to be racist , then they 're ignorant . 
  it 's not hard . 
  if you 're not ignorant , and you do n't give a shit , you 're probably a racist . 
  you should check out what else is going on on your network while you do that . 
  i 've had no issues at all with lightbox in the time i 've been using it ( also a spark customer with the free year ) . 
  i 'm also quite close to my exchange which might be a significant difference . 
  you 've hit on a vital point there - ethnic groups vs race . 
  race is an archaic term . 
  it lumps all of africa under the `` negroid '' or black race , yet there are significant differences . 
  west africans for example , as you point out , are highly represented in sprinting . 
  east africans by contrast , are highly represented in long distance running . 
  i 'm not sure on the west african environs , but the east is due to the altitude in that region , which encourages stamina . 
  yet if `` race '' is used as a class , both groups are black/negro , and become one large group who are supposedly good at running . 
  and therein lies the issue of generalising and applying the traits of one to the multitude . 
  why ? 
  because i do n't spend my time making arguments to feel better about myself ? 
  but british would n't be an ethnic grouping , it would be a nationalistic grouping . 
  race is objectively bad for analysis - it 's too broad to be useful , and its origins are horribly cluttered in bad science and white superiority . 
  i did n't bring any ad-hominems in . 
  i pointed out a way of looking at `` being a racist '' vs. `` being racist '' . 
  i did n't mean to refer to you , it was merely an example . 
  i 'm not a biologist , so i ca n't say . 
  i 'd probably just call them similarities . 
  why the hell are there so many peacock owners ? 
  i thought peacock was a euphemism for something when i saw this . 
  tried talking to their support ? 
  they sorted me out pretty fast when mine was glitching on the password screen . 
  as an aside , i 've never understood the hate for telecom/spark . 
  always been great for me . 
  so i guess you could say it went swimmingly . 
  they are available , but a lot of them are behind paywalls , or require you to be associated with a university that has access to the database indexing them . 
  [ this one is for british newspapers ] ( http://gdc.gale.com/products/19th-century-british-library-newspapers-part-i-and-part-ii/ ) , and there is a free trial available . 
  [ proquest ] ( http://www.proquest.com/products-services/pq-hist-news.html ) runs one of the better ones , but again it requires a fee . 
  there is an option to request a trial but i do n't know how long that would take . 
  as a plug for nz history , [ paperspast ] ( http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast ) is a free access database , with newspapers from 1839-1945 from around new zealand , and is regularly being added to . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:list_of_online_newspaper_archives#united_states ) also has a handy list of freely available us newspaper archives . 
  they are scattered . 
  it appears the library of congress also runs a program called [ chronicling america ] ( http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/ ) which has a huge number of newspapers available . 
  lastly , i 'd suggest you check your local libraries ( public and university ) . 
  there might be a way you 're able to look at their microfilm collections and see more recent era newspapers . 
  what else would you expect from sky ? 
  here 's an idea : stop being such a douche . 
  south africa fucking owned that game , and we damned near lost it . 
  that was as tight a game as you get . 
  we dropped catches too . 
  we fucked runout attempts . 
  we won , but it 's not done yet , and we sure as fuck did n't give them a hiding to get all high and mighty about . 
  [ here 's the original image ] ( http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=11422840 ) with accompanying article . 
  i 'm not sure why op removed it because it has a timeline with all the corresponding changes . 
  the tab also had the [ original data ] ( https://www.tab.co.nz/information/#news/2015-03-25/odds-review-nz-v-south-africa ) with one set of odds that was n't included in the herald 's report . 
  in the last over , with steyn lying down injured , and nz needing five off two balls , the odds jumped to $ 2.40 . 
  edit : the 22:15 upswing was in favour of the blackcaps , not south africa . 
  that was the south african odds jumping to $ 4.50 after anderson and elliot completed their half centuries within minutes of each other .
