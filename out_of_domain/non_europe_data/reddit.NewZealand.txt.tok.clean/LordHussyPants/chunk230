  now again , if you check windows at one end , but the guy peeks the other end , how do you know ? 
  are you using a hack to show you people 's outlines ? 
  or are you telling me you 'll magically know where to look every game ? 
  why am i running from the blue ? 
  everyone 's example of tpp being broken is two trees in the final circle and someone having to move . 
  apparently running from the blue is the standard method of play . 
  the rng can be nullified . 
  lots of people with depression have issues with insomnia , do n't they ? 
  that would explain the 4am sleep time too . 
  i got ta get res for these comments . 
  i can tag you all as `` wah reverse sexism '' . 
  death pinging ? 
  did you not watch the gif ? 
  who was feeding lol, 
  oh , use a comma next time hey ? 
  it sort of is . 
  it feels like the dayz standalone got messed around with a bit and the problems fixed up . 
   `` early access '' shit game, 
  that early access shit game paid for itself with item sales , and funded my compendium, 
  competitive 8\u00a01/2 rounds *, 
  i 'm not a boxing fan , and i do n't watch mma , and even i could tell that by midway through the 9th the fight would be over in the 10th . 
  i mean , it was n't to me . 
  i thought mayweather would win , but i did n't know for sure until the 9th . 
  but as i said , i 've never watched either of these sports before . 
  he might have broken the top joint at some point and it did n't set perfectly . 
  i think he has a habit of not extending the middle joint though , you can see it on his other hand throughout the vid . 
  i wondered if he was suggesting that nz rugby just has better gathering of rugby data because of the internet connections here . 
  fuck man , neither would i if it meant putting my dyslexia on display to the world . 
  definitely , maybe . 
  my best friend 's girl, 
  how to lose a guy in 10 days, 
  notting hill, 
  10 things i hate about you, 
  crazy , stupid , love, 
  sleepless in seattle, 
  you 've got mail, 
  that awkward moment, 
  ca n't hardly wait, 
  i assume the press will investigate this as deeply as they did when metiria made her admission , right ? 
  a red dot at 300m is n't going to spot anything behind a window that 's only semi-transparent and has a stationary pixel of a person peeking from a door within the building . 
  so once again , how is this not down to luck of the looting ? 
  how is fpp going to help me counter this wall of houses with 50 windows that could have one camper watching me ? 
  if people being forced towards me for the kill eliminates skill , then fpp is not a skillful mode either . 
  where exactly is the skill in this game ? 
  how 'd he manage to make the car blow up ? 
  i 've never seen one do that when i drove into water . 
  because racism is dictated by power , and power is overwhelmingly controlled by societal structures . 
  a black man calling a white man a white bastard only causes offence with the word ` bastard ' , because being white is n't considered bad . 
  calling a black man the n-word invokes centuries of history that are tied to black suffering . 
  it reinforces the power over black people . 
  power is overwhelmingly white in america too . 
  white people are [ 74 % of the total population of the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demography_of_the_united_states#race ) , but holds [ 80 % of the house and 94 % of the senate ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/05/the-new-congress-is-80-percent-white-80-percent-male-and-92-percent-christian/?utm_term=.4f433c70b899 ) . 
  at the other end of political engagement , non-white people are disproportionately disenfranchised through [ voter id laws ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/getting-a-photo-id-so-you-can-vote-is-easy-unless-youre-poor-black-latino-or-elderly/2016/05/23/8d5474ec-20f0-11e6-8690-f14ca9de2972_story.html?utm_term=.acfa9b13e3dd ) and [ gerrymandering ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/how-gerrymandering-black-districts-backfired-south-498036 ) . 
  voter disenfranchisement has a [ long history of targeting black folks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/disenfranchisement_after_the_reconstruction_era ) . 
  minority communities are also disproportionately affected by criminal disenfranchisement , or restriction of voting rights to prisoners . 
  while only 26 % of the population is non-white , [ 60 % of the prison population is non-white . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/incarceration_in_the_united_states#ethnicity ), 
  we know that crime is higher in areas of poverty too , and that [ minority groups have twice the poverty rate of white americans ] ( http://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/minorities.aspx ) and that those same minority groups [ face far tougher challenges in escaping poverty ] ( http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-working-poor-minorities-20150316-story.html ) . 
  this has effects in other areas of life , most notably healthcare and education . 
  we all know healthcare in the us sucks anyway , but it 's [ substantially worse if you 're black , latino , or poor ( which we already discussed is more likely to affect black and latino families ) . 
  ] ( https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertpearl/2015/03/05/healthcare-black-latino-poor/#66b0eef97869 ) health factors include economic measures such as subsidies for certain industries ( corn and corn syrup ) , duties and taxes on fruit and vegetables , [ which increase the cost of living healthily by $ 2,000 per year ] ( http://nationalpost.com/health/a-healthy-diet-costs-2000-a-year-more-than-an-unhealthy-one-for-average-family-of-four-harvard-study ) - a sizable sum to a family in poverty . 
  this not only increases the cost of healthcare , but illness makes holding down employment harder , as well as completing education . 
  education is also segregated often by socio-economic status , leading to [ poorer quality schools for poor people ( remember - they 're more likely to be black and latino ) . 
  ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/02/concentration-poverty-american-schools/471414/ ) schools in poorer areas [ habitually receive fewer educational aids ] ( https://www.brookings.edu/articles/unequal-opportunity-race-and-education/ ) , including things as basic as school books . 
  a lower quality of standard education means less chance of higher education , of a higher paying job , and of breaking out of poverty . 
  all of these factors are institutional in nature . 
  they all negatively affect black and latino communities more than white communities . 
  they all contribute to a society where non-white citizens are more likely to be in the lower classes , and so out of reach of any meaningful use of power . 
  racism is the acceptance of a racially discriminative system , and that 's what this is . 
  that 's why people refer to institutionalised racism . 
  because racism did n't end in 1954 with * brown v. board * , or 1965 with the voting rights act , or 2008 , with obama 's election . 
  it 's actually pretty clear if you take the time to read it . 
  i even gave you all the citations . 
  do n't tell me you only read to the second sentence and skipped the good stuff ?!, 
  i 'll make a numbered list instead . 
  socioeconomic distances affect people of certain races more than others . 
  racism is the acceptance of discrimination based on racial identity . 
  if the socioeconomic environment that causes people of one race to be affected more than another is accepted , then the system is racist . 
  this is commonly called systemic or institutional racism . 
  do n't need a torch and a white hood to be a racist , lad . 
  i freely admit that i benefit from being white . 
  why do n't you ? 
   racism is the acceptance of a racially discriminative system, 
  hi i 'm a definition , read me, 
   white privilege is n't real . 
  class privilege is . 
  why ca n't they both be real ? 
  ( they are ), 
  it 's easier for white people to escape poverty than minorities . 
  the poorest white person in america still has 94 senators and 44 presidents who look like them . 
  they 're statistically less likely on practically every metric to face discrimination because of their race than minorities . 
  you telling me that 's all class ? 
   not remotely true . 
  stop repeating what others say . 
  it is true . 
  white people have better educational opportunities , better job opportunities , lower crime rates , better healthcare . 
  all of which aid upward mobility . 
   literally nothing at all to do with this . 
  representation matters . 
  it 's been proven that having role models that look like you is a benefit .
