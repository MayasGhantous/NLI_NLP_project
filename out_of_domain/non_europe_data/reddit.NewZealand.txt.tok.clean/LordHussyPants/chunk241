   `` there 's thousands of teachers in the uk who would love to come here and teach , who would find auckland house prices not that expensive , and who would love new zealand kids , '' he wrote . 
  i like immigration . 
  i like english people too . 
  but fuck this attitude which suggests that an english teacher is more worthy of a house in * my * city than me , because they 've got money that i do n't . 
  you want to come here and teach ? 
  fine . 
  but the selling point should n't be that you can afford property in a fucking untenable housing market while the locals ca n't . 
  yo bill 's eevee to espeon my loooooooooooord, 
  so i worked around that by using a trick from the prima guide i got given when i was ten . 
  eevee to l30 --  learn bite . 
  then make eevee really happy and evolve it to espeon by l35 . 
  espeon at l36 learns psybeam . 
  you do n't get stab for bite , but it 's got that high flinch chance and is still super effective against other psychic types . 
  if you get espeon to ~ l45 or above before the elite four , it 'll take out all of will , bruno , and koga 's teams on its own .

  [ hi i 'm gareth morgan and i 'd just like to say ] ( https://i.imgflip.com/1wdqqw.jpg ), 
  why ? 
  everything i know is in auckland . 
  am i supposed to leave behind my entire life for a chance at home ownership ? 
  with no support network ? 
  no friends ? 
  no job security ?

  hone has done as much if not more for m\u0101ori as any other modern mp . 
  exactly , but somehow i ( and everyone else in my generation ) am a spoiled brat because i do n't want to relocate due to the shitty actions of a government i did n't vote for . 
  not that it matters - because he runs in a m\u0101ori electorate , in a m\u0101ori party , for m\u0101ori issues - but his main fights are for better education , better health policies ( especially those around drug use and abuse ) , and helping those in poverty . 
  how are any of those not p\u0101keh\u0101 issues too ? 
  that was n't my logic at all , you 're misinterpreting me . 
  i 'm saying hone does n't have to care about non-m\u0101ori issues because he does n't run for them . 
  he only runs for m\u0101ori and once he gets in , what he advocates for m\u0101ori more often than not helps non-m\u0101ori too . 
  nah , lorde did that already , remember ? 
  because he has nothing else to stand on . 
  british immigrants who have come here and now rant about double standards for m\u0101ori and how the treaty is archaic .

  i played on what was probably the best australian server ( by longevity and quality of player ) and it had been modded to add more vehicles so all players would have a chance to move around those huge maps . 
  it also meant that we could have extreme naval battles with 10 ships involved , ramming into each other at full speed .

  the ssd is a sata connection , and i know the new retina models use the pcie connection . 
  i 'd like to know whether there is another bay/port in the retina models where a sata ssd could be installed . 
  if not , then are there any newer models than the june 2012 mbp that i could install it in ? 
  and finally , is there a way of getting a replacement pcie ssd for a mbp retina directly from a legitimate company - i.e. 
  not off ebay or by buying a second mbp . 
  this is a film i saw part of on late night television back in the early 2000s . 
  it was mainly about the camp leaders/counselors and their relationships with each other . 
  it was not wet hot american summer . 
  the one scene i recall vividly was a guy and a girl having sex on a table of some sort ( pool or table tennis ) in the side room of a camp building . 
  it might have been a case of him performing oral on her rather than sex . 
  it is not :, 
  * wet hot american summer, 
  i set up a form to rank world cup teams in their pools and see how / r/rugbyunion thought it would all turn up . 
  here 's the link : www.surveymonkey.com/r/kdg6g7q, 
  here are the results as they arrive : https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/sm-8w8vc2t2/, 
  [ if you go to this article ] ( http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=11521598 ) and scroll down to points 6 . 
  & 7. , there are individual player stats for metres made , carries , offloads , etc. 
  and then there are team stats for the same thing . 
  i 've linked to screenshots of the ones i reference in each section . 
  what i noticed and thought was interesting is that in measures on the individual table , there are often one or two high number individuals from a team that ranks quite low on the team table . 
  in other cases , there are no individuals on the player table from a team , while that team ranks highly on the team table . 
  this suggests the reliance on star players for some teams , while others distribute workload , and all contribute . 
  [ i think the best measure is metres made ] ( http://i.imgur.com/au9hb2m.jpg ) . 
  on the individual list , australia , rsa , and nz do n't appear at all , yet fill out the top 4 behind ireland on the team list . 
  ireland has 3 top 10 individuals , but only one is top 5 . 
  tonga , england , canada , and argentina have the top 4 individuals with metres made . 
  but those teams come in behind the sh big 3 and ireland . 
  the logical assumption is that while these teams are relying on one or two big names to do the hard work , the top four teams are spreading their work among their players , so that a total of 1172m ( australia ) , is evenly distributed across their players rather than lumped onto one , like mike brown who has a quarter of of england 's total metres at this rwc . 
  this appears in other areas too . 
  [ in ` carries ' for example ] ( http://i.imgur.com/p9wfrny.jpg ) , there is only one irish player in the top 10 , and no kiwis , yet ireland and nz are # 2 and # 3 respectively on the team carries list . 
  the reverse can be seen with japan , who have two players in the top 10 individuals , but on the team list , come in much further down than nz , ireland , and south africa . 
  [ the same comes up in ` defenders beaten ' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fglyvi1.jpg ) . 
  nadolo , mike brown , and milner-skudder make up the top 3 , and england has a second appearance in johnny may . 
  but fiji does n't make the top 10 teams , and england is only in 6th , despite two top 10 players . 
  meanwhile , australia ( mitchell ) , ireland ( none ) , south africa ( none ) , tonga ( veainu ) and new zealand all rank above england and fiji .

  so only heavy use will be video games .
