  i have an ssd and bluray drive handy already . 
  i need a psu obviously , and a cpu cooler . 
  i 'm not sure what cooler will fit with the mobo i 've chosen . 
  i 'm also not sure what psu brands are best at the moment - i 've heard corsair 's dropped a bit . 
  so i need :, 
  double check of compatibility/bottleneck issues, 
  psu, 
  cpu cooler for an asus h170, 
  ideas about where money could be saved , or where a little more could be spent for better performance . 
  just put together a new rig , installed windows 7 , and updated with windows update . 
  i have a logitech g15 keyboard , g400s mouse , and g930 headset ( this is n't plugged in yet ) . 
  the keyboard and mouse are working fine ( albeit with no sensitivity options for the mouse ) , but i wanted the g15 panel and the mouse 's programmable buttons to work so i installed the latest version of lgs . 
  as soon as the install completed , i restarted , and the computer automatically bluescreened once i 'd entered my windows account password and begun loading the desktop . 
  booted into safe mode , uninstalled software , rebooted normally - no issue . 
  installed the windows update kb3033929 as suggested on the logitech support page , reinstalled the lgs , rebooted , same thing again . 
  i 've done it three times , and ca n't find any more windows updates to install , so i ca n't see what the problem is . 
  the overwatch community has gone downhill a bit since opening week . 
  it 's changed from joking calls of `` lol noob hero '' to `` fuck you , you suck ! '', 
  i 'd be willing to bet it 's competitive mode , and people taking the game far too seriously . 
  but today i did see something nice . 
  playing as tracer on defence ( a role i think she is best suited to anyway ) , i had one guy spam chat with `` tracer switch '' for the entire round . 
  i did n't reply ( too busy killing ) , and when we lost , possibly because he was typing more than playing , he promptly blamed me in all chat . 
  now , i do n't care about that because it 's fairly common in games . 
  it 's sad to see in overwatch though , because i still have my nostalgia lenses for when people were friendly in this game . 
  so imagine my astonishment when the other team immediately comes to my aid . 
  `` she did better than you ! '', 
  `` she wrecked our backline for the entire game , gave you easy 4v5 fights . '', 
  `` gg trace , well played . '', 
  so thanks to everyone who has n't devolved into a toxic scrotum of hate yet , and still appreciates good plays . 
  even if they 're not from the winning team , or they 're from an enemy destroying your team 's ability to push . 
  a year ago , [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyunion/comments/3mi9uk/breaking_news_from_twickenham/ ) brought us some breaking news from twickenham - the hosts of rwc 2015 had been eliminated from the pool of death and would not advance to the quarter finals . 
  in that thread , a lot of comments revolved around the perceived unfairness of how pools were drawn three years before the world cup . 
  we are at this point in time , three years out from rwc 2019 , and using the draw from last year 's world cup ( based on rankings from 2012 ) , this is what the 2019 world cup pools would look like if it was seeded today !, 
  i 've altered the minnows and rank 9-12 where they 've changed , e.g. 
  japan/georgia . 
  | pool a | pool b | pool c | pool d |, 
  australia ( ranked : 3 ) | england ( r : 2 ) | new zealand ( r : 1 ) | south africa ( r : 4 ), 
  wales ( r : 5 ) | argentina ( r : 7 ) | france ( r : 8 ) | ireland ( r : 6 ), 
  scotland ( r : 9 ) | japan ( r : 12 ) | georgia ( r : 11 ) | fiji ( r : 10 ), 
  so , if drawn today , pool a looks to be the pool of death with australia and wales being challenged by samoa and scotland !, 
  interesting also , that france is only a loss or two away from dropping to 9th , which would put them in pool a instead of scotland . 
  with a brand new draw , that could in fact result in a pool that england , wales/ireland , france altogether . 
  edit : i 'm really not interested in how wrong i got the bottom 3 in each pool . 
  stop telling me . 
  i have n't slept since last year , and i 'm exhausted !,

  because the germans like to walk in the shade . 
  i was considering watching caprica , and i read that it 's about the initial creation of cylons 58 years before the events of bsg . 
  but i thought that the cylons were originally created by the 13th colony on the original earth - the same place where the final five were born . 
  this does n't seem to gel with the caprica story line that suggests the cylons were created 60 years prior to bsg . 
  can anyone help here ? 
  wales are seeking to eliminate their 0 % win rate at eden park tonight !, 
  they have played there three times against the all blacks , losing 33-12 ( 1969 ) , 54-9 ( 1988 ) , and 39-21 ( 2016 ) . 
  but they have also played there during world cups !, 
  in 1987 , wales triumphantly topped their pool with 3 from 3 , winning at palmerston north , invercargill , and wellington . 
  they went on to win a qf in brisbane , before losing the sf in brisbane , and winning 3rd place in rotorua . 
  in 2011 , the world cup returned to new zealand , and wales found more victories . 
  however , this time , as before , eden park was cursed . 
  after 3/4 in the pool stages at waikato ( x2 ) and new plymouth - and a close loss to south africa in wellington ) , wales beat ireland at wellington to advance to the sf . 
  there , they were beaten by france in a close match ( with an ignominious red card to the skip ) , and then lost to australia in the bronze medal match . 
  both losses were close - the first by 1 point and the second by 3 . 
  so the question is , can wales beat the curse tonight and take home a victory over tonga ? 
  history suggests yes : wales has never lost to tonga in their 7 match ups , but the pacific island nations have proven themselves to be entirely capable to upset big nations in the past . 
  tonga has wins against australia , scotland , and france under their belt . 
  in the last 2 matches against wales , tonga has finished within 10 points while playing on tour to the uk . 
  tonight , they have much closer to a home ground advantage , as well as several players who are familiar with eden park from the super rugby and npc competitons , not to mention a crowd that will be cheering for the pacific team . 
  if i disconnect while i 'm on the island , will it still count as a game played in the stats ? 
  if so , can this be changed ? 
  i ask because i queue in squads with the matchmaking enabled , and over the last week or so i 've gone from being matched with solo players to being matched with groups of 3 who refuse to talk or communicate ingame to the point where i 'm effectively playing with 3 bots . 
  it 's not fun , and it ruins the game experience . 
  so in the pregame i try to communicate with them , and if i get a response , all well and good . 
  otherwise , i disconnect . 
  edit : just joined a squad game , got matched with a 3 . 
  the 3 did n't talk once , died within 2 minutes at crater . 
  joined a new one . 
  they said hi , then they shot me when i found a gun they wanted . 
  maybe just add a report function for these fucks . 
  edit 2 : in 19 minutes i 've joined 5 games , had 4 x 3 stacks who did n't communicate at all . 
  solo matchmaking is n't finding games at this time of day . 
  there has to be a way to improve this experience , surely ?

  make an offer or counter-offer . 
  will also accept rares from the dota 2 international chests, 
  it 's currently very easy to kill cars by smashing them with a clip or two of ammo . 
  this makes bridge camping very effective , which in turn makes the military circles a lot harder for people who do n't understand what a boat is or are afraid of swimming . 
  making cars more resilient to bullet fire would mean that drivers would have a better chance running the gauntlet , and an rpg drop would mean that a bridge camper would have to be properly equipped to take out a vehicle , as well as sacrificing a weapon and requiring a degree of skill . 
  in solo games you can currently track your wins , and your top 10s . 
  it 's good because there are 100 people , so top 10 is impressive . 
  but in duos , there 's only 50 teams , and in squads , only ~ 25 ( assuming perfect distribution ) . 
  if we had some sort of ribbon , or badge , or something ( gold , silver , bronze ) that you could get when you came first/second/third , it would look nice on stats , and give a bit of relevance to those duo and squad games where you did well , but did n't win . 
  at the moment , squad games are highly forgettable unless you win , because there 's no record of non-winning games where you still performed well .
