  he had entertained black guests in his home , and he had made several more rulings which went against the segregation of black and white charlestonians . 
  in another case , freedom riders who rode buses from washington d.c. down to the south in an effort to break segregation were met with violence . 
  arthur marwick writes in his book * the sixties * about the reception they met in alabama : '' [ outside anniston ] one of the buses was destroyed by fire , and vicious mob attacks took place in birmingham and montgomery '' . 
  the third example is the albany movement . 
  it was founded by members of sncc and the naacp , and dr. king aided the group . 
  they were protesting segregation too , because despite it already having been ordered by authorities , it remained in place . 
  in 1962 , king was arrested with several others while protesting , `` during an episode in which the police led the way in manifestations of extreme white violence '' . 
  i bring up these different events to show that white on black violence was not a rarity , but was in fact a common occurrence in the south at this point . 
  in the face of black protests over segregation and inequality , white populations in the south had reacted with extreme prejudice , committing numerous acts that would be regarded as criminal today . 
  arson , assault , and police brutality all featured . 
  in the case of the judge in charleston , intimidation and threats of violence were also used , but came at later dates in the form of recrimination for previous acts . 
  knowing all of this , we can see the threat that the sit-in participants were exposed to . 
  in their immediate situation , violence from shop owners , police , or members of the public was a possibility in every protest . 
  as well , they could face later consequences in the form of harassment , refusal of service , and threats of as well as actual violence to their families or homes .

  i think / u/eulerseulogy is saying that his older brother was the reason he had a shorter leg , because it was broken when he was younger by the brother . 
  constitution, 
  the ` great man theory ' is one that was popular in the early-mid nineteenth century . 
  it suggested that `` the course of human history results largely from the actions of great men '' , or in other words , that certain figures were responsible for the bulk of the goings on in the world . 
  an example would be napoleon bonaparte . 
  rising to the heights that he did , ~ ~ he plunged europe into war , and ~ ~ the events that followed his campaigns undoubtedly had an effect on europe in the century that followed . 
  the counter-argument to this theory came via herbert spencer , who said :, 
   those who regard the histories of societies as the histories of their great men , and think that these great men shape the fates of their societies , overlook the truth that such great men are the products of their societies . 
  basically , spencer is claiming that great men would n't necessarily exist outside their societies . 
  if you were to remove napoleon from eighteenth century france , where he grew up , and instead placed him in another place and era , his life would take a different path , not guaranteed to be one of ` greatness ' . 
  spencer 's counter-argument asks us to inspect the context of these ` great men ' , rather than just accepting their greatness as inherent . 
  this is in effect , one of the cons of ` great man ' history . 
  we are lulled into thinking of certain men as the key figures of a time or place , and neglect to look beyond to what made them that way . 
  we are also led to believe that these people are somehow the sole forces for change or moves of history . 
  if history views events this way , then it forgets the people who participated . 
  napoleon invaded russia with over half a million troops . 
  a great man history reduces those men to cannon fodder , who are of little or no use to the historical record . 
  yet if studied , we can learn about society at that point in time - the feelings of the soldiers towards the war and their officers , how their lives were affected by war , and any number of other bits of information that may come up in journals , diaries , and letters . 
  from my area of study , the most obvious choice would be martin luther king , who is * the * person of the civil rights movement . 
  he was a brilliant man , an eloquent speaker , and he oozed charisma . 
  but while he was essentially the frontman of the movement , he was n't the reason it happened . 
  he could n't have achieved all that he did without the help of sncc , and the sclc , and the naacp . 
  before mlk was born there was half a century of black ( and white ) men and women fighting for equality in america . 
  but the position of mlk at the time of the crms greatest victories meant that he is remembered as the cause . 
  the cost is that the churchwomen , and educators , and student groups , and railway men , who all organised activism across the south are often forgotten by popular history . 
  ** edit : ** * as / u/theshowisnottheshow pointed out in his reply , the greatest downside is the erasure of everyone except ` the man ' . 
  that 's essentially what i wanted to say here , but it was n't very clear . 
  and this is where i would tenuously suggest that the positive side of ` great men ' history is that it entices people to history through the actions of these popularised figures . 
  people get interested because they hear names like henry the eighth , or charlemagne , or your example of genghis khan . 
  not as many people will be drawn to history by john smith , the baker who baked a cinnamon bun that the prince of avignon choked on in the 16th century . 
  but tell that same person about mansu musa , the malian king who destroyed the economy of the eastern mediterranean by giving out bags of gold dust to egyptian beggars , and they might be lured into asking more questions . 
  so the upside of ` great men ' history is that it creates these leading roles , and they act as lighthouses for this field , guiding people in to a certain area of history that intrigues . 
  the hope is that once you 've reached that safe harbour and begin to learn about that history , you 'll dig deeper and explore the society that these men come from , and the context which led them to become conquerors or despots , heroes or villains . 
  or both ? 
  ** source : **, 
  my main source is [ this article - ( pdf warning ) ] ( http://mises.org/sites/default/files/5_2_2_0.pdf ) about herbert spencer , the man who countered the ` great man theory ' with his argument that great men are formed by their societies . 
  the rest would just be knowledge gleaned through my studies , and i can try find some more articles if anyone wants them , although i suspect that they might be paywalled . 
  i would argue that this is based entirely around personal circumstances and context . 
  imagine you 're in high school , hanging out with your friends , or in a class . 
  now imagine that a student comes around the corner to where you 're hanging out , or bangs open the classroom door , and says `` the principal wants to see you op . '', 
  you do n't know why the principal wants to see you . 
  you do n't remember doing anything bad , or good . 
  you do n't see a reason that you would be called to their office , for either a punishment or a reward . 
  but they are an authority figure , and you 're required to go . 
  in some ways , they 're negating your free will by their summons . 
  it 's the same thing with police . 
  if you see a policeman , and get jittery , it 's not necessarily because of a lack of trust , but because you 're unsure . 
  you do n't know if * you * are their target , or if you are extraneous to their purposes . 
  i write all of this from the perspective of a white male , so if you 're not white , this might not apply in the same way . 
  i think that some groups have legitimate reasons to fear the police . 
  the stop-and-frisk problem in new york city is a great example of this as it disproportionately targets non-white citizens . 
  and i would argue that that is a lack of trust by the police , which leads to a lack of trust * for * the police by the public . 
  barkers outlet are great for hugely marked down stuff that would normally cost $ 100 +, 
  also , their t-shirts are the nicest i 've ever worn . 
  teaching should be the last thing in this world that is affected by the convenience of something . 
  you 're right in stating that personal narratives are effective , but gm theory relegates anyone who 's not that key figure to the sidelines . 
  it creates an illusion that if you 're not the key figure in a historical moment , then you have no personal narrative , or , if you do , then it does n't matter . 
  what sort of lesson is that for students ? 
  [ all the major cities ( and hamilton ) have them . 
  ] ( http://www.barkersonline.co.nz/stores.aspx ) auckland has two : one at dressmart in onehunga ; one up in rosedale on the shore . 
  hamilton outlet is at the base , the wellington one is in tawa , and christchurch has one in hornby . 
  i got a $ 200 jacket there for $ 35 , and i 've had heaps of use out of it . 
  possibly . 
  i think it 's safer to say that if napoleon had n't existed , there might have been someone else in his place who did some of what he did , or the same as , or even took it further . 
  but it 's all speculative . 
  drawing back to america and civil rights , rosa parks is a good example . 
  she 's referenced everywhere today , from pop music to movies , to general conversation . 
  she 's the little guy who took a stand . 
  but she was also one of several little guys who had taken stands , and circumstance was kind to her , and allowed her instance of resistance to become the example . 
  * brown v. board * was n't the first instance of a black family challenging segregation in schools , it was just the one that got chosen as the best context and climate in which to take action . 
  a thousand times this . 
  i did mention it somewhere , but it might have been on a reply to another comment . 
  i was n't very clear about it in this one , so thanks for bringing that up . 
  full on 100 % great man theory right there . 
  i only took napoleon as my example because the rise of the idea in the 1800s suggested to me that he was the one they were all drawing from . 
  great example of history being cluttered by great men and their great tales . 
  firstly , i 've spun out on cook st off ramp . 
  it 's scary , and i do n't begrudge anyone who slows down there . 
  secondly , if you 're annoyed that i 'm doing 109 in the right hand lane , and you ca n't overtake me , then get over it . 
  you 're not * allowed * to go faster , and you have no right to be irritated . 
  to answer your title question , simply because it 's easier that way . 
  the decimal system operates on 10s , so we have decades , centuries , and millenia . 
  when noticing change in history , whether it be from social , economic , political , or other causes , it is easy to point to a decade and say `` the sixties was when this changed . '', 
  it works as a general framework for looking at periods of time , and because it 's a simple counting system , it 's easily adopted to general usage .
