  so whenever i 've logged in , and i 'm sitting atop the tallest tower of chernogorsk , i 'd hear those little creaking noises that were part of the ambient sound ... and i 'd freak out and spin to find an empty roof , void of assassins . 
  so now i started logging in , checking , taking two shots , and logging off . 
  i was too scared to stick around . 
  what if someone caught me ? 
  what if i lost everything ? 
  i did this for two more days . 
  then i ran out of food . 
  now i had to descend , there was no choice . 
  problem was , i did n't realise i needed food until i 'd taken two shots . 
  so i descended my ladder , and on the second floor i heard a creak . 
  i was too rushed , it could n't be anything , so i kept going . 
  on the first floor , i heard it again . 
  i decided i 'd be safe and pull out my hmg . 
  i turned around , and the shadows went crazy , flickering all over the screen . 
  i freaked , and shot off two rounds into a wall , purely from my finger tensing up . 
  i calmed down and realised it was nothing . 
  a second later , i heard a shot behind me , and i turned to see a guy in camo gear proned out in front of me on the floor , half concealed behind the a big cylindrical water tower . 
  i went full auto , and let loose . 
  198 bullets to go and he had no chance . 
  i reloaded , then sat still and started my breakdown all over again as i realised that i had effectively told everyone in the southern half of the map where i was . 
  luckily , he had food on him , so i did n't have to go out anymore . 
  i grabbed it and climbed back up my tower . 
  i logged off . 
  the next day i came on , and was greeted by the sound of an engine . 
  this was the mod , and vehicles were n't common yet . 
  we saw the odd car every now and then , but it was n't regular . 
  i could n't see the vehicle anywhere , and i sat and waited . 
  i killed a bandit , and then the engine moved closer . 
  someone typed in chat that ` the bird ' had come . 
  i assumed it was standard dayz crazy talk . 
  next thing i know , there 's a helicopter hovering over the edge of cherno , bullets erupting from inside it , and nothing else audible over the engine noise . 
  i sighted in on it , but could n't get a view of anyone . 
  i was n't even sure you could shoot through doors , or if they would glitch the bullets out . 
  then it spun , and faced the other direction . 
  i now had a clear visual on the side door gunner . 
  i took the shot , and being awful at this sort of thing , predictably missed . 
  the bullet hit the helicopter instead , and it started to swing backwards . 
  i could n't work it out at all . 
  then i realised : the as-50 , the most powerful sniper rifle in the mod ; the gun everyone dreams of finding ; the one hit killer , anywhere on the body . 
  it was an anti vehicle gun . 
  all of a sudden my target tripled in size . 
  i started firing off shots recklessly at the chopper , and its rotor seized up , and flames burst out . 
  it started to spiral , and i saw a lone figure fall separate from the chassis and hit the ground a short distance from the building the rest of the machine landed behind . 
  obviously , at this point , i was in serious trouble . 
  i 'd just taken out a helicopter , with 2-3 occupants , who clearly were at the top of the game . 
  they had done the unthinkable in finding that chopper and making it fly . 
  i had only one option : i logged off , and this time , i stayed off for weeks . 
  yes . 
  drunk people are not allowed in motor vehicles at all . 
  except that rommel was never a member of the nazi party , respected his prisoners as men , and ignored orders to kill jewish prisoners on the african campaign . 
  what is often forgotten is that being a german during wwii , or a german soldier , does not equate to being a nazi . 
  i was replying to the guy above who was suggesting drunk people could n't be in the passenger seat , which seems quite silly . 
  as for the law , check your local road code . 
  i 'm in new zealand , and here you can only have someone who is intoxicated in the front passenger seat if you 're on your full licence . 
  if you 're on a lower class , you need to have a fully qualified driver in that seat , and they must be able to legally drive if required : they must be sober , must have glasses if required by licence conditions etc. 
  bit late to this , but i have a friend who 's about 6 years younger than me . 
  i met her when i was about 20 and she was 14 through the sibling of a friend i 'd grown up knowing . 
  this girl joined the navy last year when she turned 18 , and i had last seen her when she was about 16 . 
  i saw her a week or two ago , after a year in the navy and now 19 . 
  she talked to me as if i was the younger person , and with clear authority in her voice . 
  so i 'd hazard a guess that you 're on the right track to getting out of that situation because i do n't think i could ever talk to her as anyone less than my equal in age and experience again . 
  this does n't apply to your mother or aunts or grandmother . 
  you will always be a child to them , get used to it . 
  `` one by one and in short supply '', 
  ** comment synopsis : ** first part is about the cherokee and the trail of tears , concerning indigenous values of land . 
  second part is about andrew jackson and his land grabs , concerning white american policy in the early nineteenth century . 
  i can think of one example where this outcome could have been a possibility , but ultimately was n't used . 
  the removal of the cherokee people from georgia in the late 1830s came as a result of white americans wanting their land for various reasons , including agriculture and gold mining . 
  there had been interest voiced among the cherokee for assimilation with the white population , * for the sole purpose of maintaining residence on their ancestral lands * . 
  this is ~ ~ often ~ ~ always misunderstood by colonial governments . 
  the colonisers come from a european background where land is an asset , and can be bought , sold , and traded . 
  that interpretation of land does n't gel with that of indigenous peoples from outside that capitalist background . 
  the maori , the native americans , first nations - all of these have connections with the land that are beyond value . 
  the land is where their people have been born , have lived , and have died . 
  so when the cherokee made an effort to keep their land , they were instead given land beyond the mississippi . 
  now , this could have been a larger amount of land , and it may even have had resources that were more valuable in later periods . 
  but it was n't * their * land . 
  they had no connection to it . 
  in fact , there was most likely another nation that did have a spiritual link to it . 
  in this example , the answer is no : they never had that intention . 
  but they could have done it with the cherokee in georgia , except that would have obstructed access to the natural resources of the area as the cherokee would have only had a state in that region . 
  and if the intention had been to move the cherokee and then create new states over the mississippi , then the same state of affairs could have occurred with another nation , or with new resources at a later date , or it just would n't have worked because it was n't cherokee land . 
  ** edit ** : adding in some more information about land grabs which is coming direct from a text i have here and not just memory . 
  yay !, 
  the worst perpetrator of the land grabs was most likely andrew jackson . 
  while quelling american indian rebellions in the early nineteenth century jackson promised those who assisted him rewards of land . 
  he also promised that '' ... if either party , cherokees , friendly creeks , or whites , takes property of the red sticks , the property belongs to those who take it . '', 
  the red sticks were a faction of the creek nation who opposed assimilation with white american expansion , preferring to hold onto their land and culture . 
  so we immediately see here an opposition to ( a ) leaving the land , and ( b ) abandoning native society and its practices . 
  but wait , i hear you say , what about the cherokee and the friendly creeks who were promised land ? 
  surely that amounts to a promise of land that could eventually become a state for those indigenous nations members who were loyal to america !, 
  well , yes ... in a way . 
  except for a few factors , including slaves , jackson , treaties , jackson , settlers , and jackson . 
  jackson was in charge of making a treaty after the war in 1814 against the creek nation , which was won by friendly cherokee who fought for him . 
  while making the treaty , he managed to come out the other side with `` half the land of the creek nation '' for america . 
  his response to protests made by creeks who had fought with him ? 
  `` the united states would have been justified by the great spirit had they taken all the lands of the nation [ ... ] the great body of the creek chiefs and warriors did not respect the power of the united states '' . 
  this was given in response to creek warriors who had helped jackson in return for keeping their lands . 
  it essentially set a standard of no promises could be kept . 
  slavery was also still in play at this point , and when slaves escaped , they were often offered sanctuary in native villages and settlements .
