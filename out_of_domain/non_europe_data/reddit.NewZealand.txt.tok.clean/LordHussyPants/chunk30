  it is a highly corrosive acid that dissolves gold and platinum , meaning you could easily melt your way through anything , as well as liquidising precious metals and passing them off as urine samples . 
  i 'm a bit late to this , but two interesting things i noticed in a skim of the op : ( 1 ) cannibalism and ( 2 ) the idea that native americans turned their backs on the arrival of western society by `` holding on '' to their culture . 
  cannibalism always seems to arise as the proof that a culture is barbaric or savage . 
  it 's used here , and against african ethnic groups , and in new zealand to demonise the maori . 
  it 's rather ironic given that the populations that use this argument are european and usually christian - a religion that goes in for symbolic cannibalism . 
  the idea of indigenous cultures turning their backs on the assimilation with western society is recurring too . 
  in actual fact , not all the indian nations did this . 
  [ i answered a question ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/32h7qb/was_there_ever_any_effort_to_get_native_american/ ) in askhistorians about this last week . 
  the cherokee actively tried to assimilate , but were moved off their land . 
  the seminole made treaties with the american government , but were coerced out of their land and displaced by white settlers . 
  even in the twentieth century , the rise of black power and black nationalism was seen as a betrayal of white society by many . 
  mainstream america and the media could n't understand why black americans would want to form their own groups and exercise more self determination . 
  i think it 's almost like an attempted cultural guilt trip . 
  something like , `` why would you do this after all * we 've * done to help you ? '', 
  * disclaimer : i 'm using a book that was published in 2002 for this , and i have n't checked all the flags for consistency , but to my knowledge , none of them have changed . 
  the book was published with the flag institute , the leading vexillological organisation in the world . 
  there are 31 countries in the world ( i counted ) that have flags made up of the colours red , white and blue . 
  there are more that use only two of these , but i 'm assuming you mean the three as a trio . 
  by region , the divisons are thus :, 
  north america , 1 ( united states ) . 
  central america , 3 ( panama , dominican republic , costa rica ) . 
  south america 2 ( chile , paraguay ) . 
  africa , 2 ( cape verde , liberia ) . 
  europe , 12 ( iceland , norway , netherlands , united kingdom , france , luxembourg , czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , croatia , serbia , russia ) . 
  asia , 9 ( thailand , ~ ~ myanmar ~ ~ , laos , cambodia , taiwan , philippines , north korea , south korea , nepal ) . 
  pacific , 3 ( new zealand , australia , samoa ) . 
  as you 've probably guessed from looking at this list , there 's a wide range of nations there , and not all of them have connections with each other , or even with another country listed . 
  to find out why those colours are popular , you would have to delve into each nation 's history , as well as taking a look at colour theory . 
  for example , green is a colour found in the flags of almost all islamic nations , as it is associated with islam . 
  in africa , red , black and green are commonly found together [ representing pan-africanism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_the_unia.svg ) . 
  in other contexts , green is used to represent agriculture , while red is used for courage , communism , or strength . 
  across regions , colours have different meanings . 
  [ norway 's current flag ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_norway.svg ) , for example , has been in use since 1821 . 
  it takes influence from at least three other flags : [ the blue of sweden ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_sweden.svg ) , from the union between the two nations ; the [ red of denmark ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_denmark.svg ) , from * that * union ; and the red , white and blue of the [ tricolour of france ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_france.svg ) , which became a symbol of freedom and liberty after the revolution . 
  in turn , these three nations have their own flag origins . 
  denmark 's red flag with a white scandinavian cross is attributed by legend to a vision seen by a danish king . 
  in actuality , historians have different views . 
  wikipedia has about six suggestions . 
  the book i 'm using favours the theory that the flag was gifted to the danes by a pope during the crusades . 
  the swedish flag is likewise attributed in myth to a vision of a cross in the sky , hence the gold on blue . 
  in actuality , the colours are likely adopted from the coat of arms of sweden : `` three gold crowns in a blue field - which originated in the 14th century '' . 
  france 's flag first appeared during the french revolution ( i 'm holding my breath that i do n't get corrected on this ) . 
  the colours have multiple associations . 
  white was the colour of the bourbons , red and blue the colours of paris . 
  but they also represent the french ideals of the revolution : liberty , equality and fraternity . 
  so in norway 's flag ( which i picked because it was the page the book opened to when i needed an example ) , we have origins for all the colours . 
  blue , comes from the union with sweden , remembering national allegiances , and in turn , from the swedish coat of arms ( and if you like mythical origins , a vision in the sky ) . 
  red also represents a union , this time with denmark , and potentially originates with a flag gifted to the nation during the crusades by the pope . 
  white likewise recalls the union with denmark . 
  old allegiances are the primary reasoning here . 
  secondary to those is that of freedom , deriving from the french revolution . 
  other countries have fairly obvious links . 
  the [ united states flag ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_the_united_states.svg ) adopted the colours of the [ united kingdom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_the_united_kingdom.svg ) in its first form , and kept them when it became the stars and stripes . 
  these also came to represent freedom and revolution , much like the french tricolour . 
  [ australia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_australia.svg ) and [ new zealand ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_new_zealand.svg ) recall the uk on their flags too , both with representation of the union jack in the canton , and the colours of the stars and background , but with none of the revolutionary links . 
  [ north korea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_north_korea.svg ) and [ south korea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_south_korea.svg ) share the same colours , because they hark back to the imperial flag of korea . 
  on the north korean flag , the red is now accompanied by a star for communism and revolution . 
  the flags of [ paraguay ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_paraguay.svg ) , [ cuba ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_cuba.svg ) , [ chile ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_chile.svg ) and the [ dominican republic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_the_dominican_republic.svg ) are also linked to freedom , but by different paths . 
  chile based its flag on the stars and stripes , but attaches local meaning to the colours - blue is the andean skies , white the andean snows , and red represents the freedom struggle . 
  paraguay 's flag dates from the 1811 revolution , and takes the tricolour as a base and influence . 
  cuba , attempting to become a state of the united states in the mid-19th century also adopted the stars and stripes . 
  the dominican republic took its colours from [ haiti 's flag ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_haiti.svg ) - another national union . 
  haiti in turn took red and blue from its french origins , albeit , the revolutionary side . 
  in eastern europe , many countries use the red , white and blue as pan-slavic colours . 
  this origin is commonly tracked to [ russia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_russia.svg ) , and prior to that , the colours of [ the tsardom of muscovy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_oryol_\\ ( variant \\ ) . svg ) . 
  consequently many of these nations retain them as a signifier of ethnic heritage . 
  as a final note , some flags had minimal contact with these largely european origins . 
  [ cape verde ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_cape_verde_\\ ( 2-3_ratio \\ ) . svg ) designed its flag in 1992 , with blue for the ocean , white for peace and red for progress . 
  myanmar ~ ~ uses red for courage , blue for peace , and white for purity ~ ~ [ changed its flag in 2010 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_myanmar.svg ) , as i discovered when i went to find a pretty picture . 
  yay myanmar !, 
  [ in thailand ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_thailand.svg ) , white is for the purity of buddhism , and red for life blood . 
  the blue was only added during wwi to `` express solidarity with the allies , whose flags were mostly red , white and blue . '', 
  so in conclusion , most countries use these colours either to hark back to unions with other countries ( haiti + dominican republic , norway + sweden/denmark , uk + nz/aus ) , or to remember revolutionary ideals of freedom ( france , usa , chile , paraguay ) . 
  but it 's important to remember that within these ideals of revolution and solidarity , each country often has its own reason for those colours being important . 
  whether it be white for peace , or blue for oceans , the colours generally have multi-layered meanings . 
  edit : see [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/33kg1s/why_do_so_many_flags_use_the_colours_of_red_white/cqly7qm ) for a bit of info on the influence that the dutch flag had on flags of europe too , specifically the russian flag . 
  edit 2 : / u/miffedmouse pointed out i forgot nepal !, 
  added it now . 
  nepal also uses blue as a symbol of peace , much like myanmar 's previous flag . 
  i wonder if it 's a south east asian convention to use blue as a representation of peace . 
  possibly because it contrasts so much with red , the colour of war and blood ? 
  edit 3 : gold ? 
  you 're so kind !, 
  many flags are quite young as the formation of the states they represent only occurred in the last century or two . 
  as such , it differs from place to place . 
  while not a proper answer , here 's a small list with a country from each continent and the connection blue has with that country . 
  the shades of blue could well be down to available pigments in those regions . 
  i also wonder if they 're possibly associated with older cultural traditions within groups . 
  [ belize ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_belize.svg ) - blue is the colour of the pup , one of the founding political parties . 
  it 's also linked to the british flag . 
  [ ecuador ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_ecuador.svg ) , [ venezuela ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_venezuela.svg ) , and [ colombia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_colombia.svg ) - all three take their colours from francisco de miranda who fought the spanish for independence . 
  i read an incredibly interesting piece about him discussing primary colour theory with someone , but i ca n't remember where and it 's killing me . 
  [ djibouti ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_djibouti.svg ) - features the colours of the founding political party , and the light blue in particular represents the issa people . 
  [ eritrea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_eritrea.svg ) - uses the flag of the elpf , another group that helped attain independence . 
  the [ israeli flag ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_israel.svg ) , takes blue and white from the * tallith * i believe . 
  they are the prayer shawls used in the jewish faith . 
  the flags of [ kazakhstan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_kazakhstan.svg ) and [ mongolia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_mongolia.svg ) both use blue to represent the sky . 
  i 'm going to make a wild stab in the dark here and suggest that it is a reference to the steppes of central asia . 
  also , both countries use different shades of blue , so i 'm going to speculate that differences in the blue used are often also due to the original designer 's preference , or to a cultural preference of what is the most representative shade . 
  hope that helps in some way !,
