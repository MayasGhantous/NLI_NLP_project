  edit : added israeli flag , because i included the american one below and it seemed incomplete without every flag linked , even if they are recognisable . 
  think i forgot the backslashes . 
  fixed now . 
  thanks for that . 
  yes !, 
  i completely forgot to reference the dutch flag . 
  it came up several times , but i was so caught up in france that i forgot it . 
  edited a catchup to this post in main reply . 
  god , i feel really bad about this . 
  edited main post to remedy . 
  nepal is the badass of flags , just because they say `` screw you '' to square/rectangular conventions . 
  i ca n't answer to that , no . 
  i know that the south korean flag is very similar to the imperial flag - they retained most of the design . 
  supposedly white is the traditional colour of korea . 
  red and blue represent yin and yang , although i 'm not sure if that is a specific colour association or if it was chosen because of the contrast . 
  yes !, 
  the flags of england and scotland are combined , with the saltire of st patrick , to make the union jack . 
  before the acquisition of ireland the flag was the cross of st andrew ( white on a blue background ) combined with the flag of st george ( red cross on a white background ) . 
  ireland joining the union brought `` the so-called cross of st patrick '' . 
  it should be noted though that this flag is `` so-called '' because it was created for the purpose . 
  the flag features no symbols or colours commonly associated with ireland - the blue and gold of the president 's standard , or the green/orange representing the different religious groups . 
  from a quick look online , it appears the red , yellow and green tricolour was the flag of burma during wwii after japan ` liberated ' the country . 
  the star in the middle represents union , while red stands for courage , yellow for solidarity , and green for peace and tranquility . 
  i do n't know if you understand what nearly means . 
  you ca n't learn how to navigate a waka by reading a book . 
  that 's a perfectly reasonable comment for her to make . 
  what is unreasonable is saying that books are an outdated form of learning . 
  she seems to be taking a ` one extreme or the other approach ' , which is either her being an idiot , or a bad phrasing of her point . 
   it will be used mainly in the trust 's primary school , te kapehu whetu , which opened this year , for health and fitness studies , and science , including navigation . 
   chief executive of he puna marama , raewyn tipene , said she was comfortable with the purchase despite criticism . 
   `` i saw a comment that the money should have been spent on books . 
  that 's an old way of looking at learning , '' she said . 
  i blame the online newspaper medium for breaking everything down by sentences rather than paragraphs . 
  pretty much this . 
  i use wikipedia for every question i answer on here to get a quick overview of what the main narrative is . 
  it helps me personally because i can usually get a chronological narrative of a time period , and it might point to some context . 
  but if i was to go and answer questions using wikipedia , it would be atrocious . 
  wikipedia is like a bad lecture . 
  it gives you facts ( wwi began in 1914 , henry viii was born in 1491 , genghis khan conquered things ) , but it does n't do well on the detail . 
  to use a recent answer of mine as an example , wikipedia provides good images of flags , but its information on why those flags are like they are is lacking . 
  it 's a very shallow overview of history , and it 's misleading as it does n't dig deeper . 
  basically , wikipedia is a starting point . 
  i 've had lecturers point me to wikipedia pages and say to scan them for the basic idea of something . 
  but the wikipedia article on the entire life of henry viii is 12,000 words , the length of a fourth year dissertation . 
  fourth year dissertations do n't look at something that broad - they might look at the maritime policies of henry viii and how they shifted favourably towards france . 
  a journal article of similar length would again only look at a minute facet of henry viii 's life or reign . 
  that gives you an idea of how broad and general wikipedia is . 
  i 've given this answer before , and nothing 's changed , so i 'll copy paste it again :, 
   at the time of the creation of washington d.c. , the government did not control the military , and the states provided militia to keep the peace . 
  an 18th century national guard in a way . 
  in pennsylvania , in 1783 , the congress of the confederation ( the federal governing body of the period ) , was surrounded by 400 soldiers of the continental army demanding pay that was owed to them . 
  it was in effect , a union strike , except that the strikers were soldiers and armed . 
  when congress asked the pennsylvania council ( state government ) , to mobilize the militia to protect them , the council refused . 
  this gave congress a problem : they had been unable to rely on the state to protect them , and could not trust that the states would provide protection in future . 
  with this realized , they planned a federal district , independent from the states and their governance , where congress would have complete legal control and charge of their security .
