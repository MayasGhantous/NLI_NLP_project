  [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2r6cuv/were_songs_that_we_currently_associate_with_the/ ) on music during vietnam was my highest rated ah post , and i was quite happy with it . 
  i hesitate to say the others were * good * , as i feel they were probably a bit rushed . 
  however , i enjoyed reading about [ the fenian raids ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2qhff8/what_was_the_deal_with_the_fenian_raids_into/ ) which / u/henry _ fords_ghost asked about , as i 'd never heard of them . 
  i also liked writing [ this post on mlk jr. , ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2r60o5/the_civil_rights_movement_made_martin_luther_king/ ) but i know it was definitely a rushed write up , so i 'll leave that to you to decide if it 's worth posting . 
  i created my own sub and just saved every answer i posted in a thread in there . 
  it was way easier than a word doc as i could hyperlink easier with reddit 's formatting . 
  thanks for the feedback on the henry clay answer , i wrote it while researching it because the question was about to divebomb into oblivion and no one had got around to it . 
  it was mainly my opinion and interpretation of the sources , but i 'll take your word for it that i got some inaccuracies mixed up . 
  pretty cool , but a little frustrating that they miss the spread of buddhism to focus on the west . 
  also , the jewish populations in africa e.g. 
  ethiopia do n't appear at all . 
  the differences between ` stolen ' and ` conquered ' come down to the way history is written by the two parties . 
  indigenous american populations will largely have a narrative that focuses on the theft of land , while white americans will have a narrative of conquest . 
  why ? 
  conquest is a more noble pursuit than theft . 
  it has connotations of bravery and heroics . 
  indigenous americans have a vastly differing view though , because in many cases there were treaties signed between the united states government and the indian nations . 
  these treaties supposedly gave the indian nations the rights to stay where they were , unmolested by the united states . 
  however , things change . 
  influx of settlers into america from europe meant that more land was needed . 
  so began the land grabs . 
  here 's another comment i wrote 3 months ago which details andrew jackson 's role in the land grabs of the early nineteenth century :, 
   the worst perpetrator of the land grabs was most likely andrew jackson . 
  while quelling american indian rebellions in the early nineteenth century jackson promised those who assisted him rewards of land . 
  he also promised that '' ... if either party , cherokees , friendly creeks , or whites , takes property of the red sticks , the property belongs to those who take it . '', 
  the red sticks were a faction of the creek nation who opposed assimilation with white american expansion , preferring to hold onto their land and culture . 
  so we immediately see here an opposition to ( a ) leaving the land , and ( b ) abandoning native society and its practices . 
   but wait , i hear you say , what about the cherokee and the friendly creeks who were promised land ? 
  surely that amounts to a promise of land that could eventually become a state for those indigenous nations members who were loyal to america !, 
  well , yes ... in a way . 
  except for a few factors , including slaves , jackson , treaties , jackson , settlers , and jackson . 
   jackson was in charge of making a treaty after the war in 1814 against the creek nation , which was won by friendly cherokee who fought for him . 
  while making the treaty , he managed to come out the other side with `` half the land of the creek nation '' for america . 
  his response to protests made by creeks who had fought with him ? 
  `` the united states would have been justified by the great spirit had they taken all the lands of the nation [ ... ] the great body of the creek chiefs and warriors did not respect the power of the united states '' . 
  this was given in response to creek warriors who had helped jackson in return for keeping their lands . 
  it essentially set a standard of no promises could be kept . 
   slavery was also still in play at this point , and when slaves escaped , they were often offered sanctuary in native villages and settlements . 
  this was used as an excuse by jackson ( who commanded a sizable number of men ) , to raid into florida ( then a spanish possession ) , as the seminole were harbouring slaves . 
  jackson had continued making treaties with indians , moving south as he did , and gradually coming up against florida . 
  which he then took by the same methods . 
   in the words of jackson , the treaties worked thus : '' ... we addressed ourselves feelingly to the predominant and governing passion of all indian tribes , i.e. , their avarice or fear . '', 
  jackson and those under him encouraged settlers to move onto indian land , and then when the indians raised protest , they were told nothing could be done . 
  this led to indians signing new treaties to cede that land , and moving further away to maintain their autonomy . 
  then the process repeated . 
  the result was a crawling mass of settlers that gradually inched their way through indigenous nations lands , pushing them further west . 
   i realise this does n't fully answer your question about the efforts to make a state , but it does show the mindset of the early white american settlers . 
  indians were n't respected : they were seen as people easily tricked . 
  they were manipulated , and coerced , into moving . 
  the best chance for native americans came early on , when jefferson was secretary of state . 
  he said that `` where indians lived within state boundaries they should not be interfered with , and that the government should remove white settlers who tried to encroach on them . '', 
  so what happened ? 
  the number of white settlers increased to a point where this was n't viable anymore . 
  land was needed , and white settlers needs came before those of the indigenous peoples . 
  i ca n't get the original nyt article as it 's behind a paywall , but i do n't think it 's hugely necessary as you have the gist of it in your title . 
  here 's [ a video of malcolm x ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=80&amp;v=szuooshpddm ) responding to the story some time later , and i 've typed out a quick transcript below . 
   ** interviewer : ** malcolm x , you were involved in a controversy some months ago with your leader , is that over with ? 
  ** malcolm x : ** well uh , i 've been silent for the past ninety days , because of , uh , some statements i made concerning the president of the united states , which were distorted -, 
  ** interviewer : ** they were distorted ? 
  ** malcolm x : ** yes , they -, 
  ** interviewer : ** what did you say malcolm ? 
  ** malcolm x : ** well i said the same thing that everybody said . 
  that uh , his assassination was the result of the climate of hate , only i said , that the chickens came home to roost , which means the same thing . 
  a climate of hate means that this is the result of something . 
  and when i said chickens coming home to roost , i said the same thing . 
  ** interviewer : ** you did not say that you were glad that the president was killed ? 
  ** malcolm x : ** no , that 's what the press said . 
  what would i look like saying i 'm glad the president was killed ? 
  so essentially what malcolm is saying is that jfk had helped to create the ` climate of hate ' that led to his death . 
  one article i saw suggested that this would be evidenced by the vietnam war and the coup d'etat against ngo dinh diem that was orchestrated by the cia . 
  kennedy had never meant for ngo dinh diem to die , but the consequence of the coup was just that . 
  diem was killed on 2 nov 1963 , and kennedy 20 days later , on the 22nd . 
  i would n't suggest that there was any connection between the two deaths , but malcolm x was later against the vietnam war , and i would think he was anti-american involvement in the coup d'etat in south vietnam . 
  no , he was n't saying good . 
  i think kennedy expected the cia to overthrow the south vietnamese government , but the plan was to have ngo dinh diem in another country seeking asylum . 
  instead , he and his brother were killed . 
  the cia and kennedy certainly had strained relations after the bay of pigs , but i do n't know that it had much effect here . 
  that would not surprise me at all . 
  new zealand was only settled in the last 1,000 years , correct . 
  i think there may be arguments for up to 1,500 , but i 'm not sure . 
  new zealand was n't settled by the m\u0101ori in the same manner as taiwan , the philippines , or other islands off asia either . 
  whereas they were all quite close to the land , new zealand has been separate for millenia , and the m\u0101ori settled it through long voyages using the same navigational techniques used to find the other pacific islands . 
  from memory , it involved rowing against the currents from their home islands until they had depleted something like two-thirds of their supplies , and then raising sail to follow the winds + currents home in half the time .

  for a ba , my biggest thing is structure . 
  be clear . 
  tex/sex/tee / see , whatever acronym you have for paragraphs : use it . 
  ** thesis/statement : ** make the main point of your paragraph . 
  do n't try and be subtle . 
  just say it . 
  do it in the first sentence . 
  * e.g. 
  the civil rights movement was not limited to the years 1954-c .1973 , as often suggested by the historical narrative . 
  ** expand/explain : ** elaborate on that thesis sentence . 
  you should have 2-4 points to elaborate here to drive home your meaning .
