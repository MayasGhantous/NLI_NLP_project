  african americans had made concerted attempts to reduce the inequalities of segregation and institutional racism in america . 
  educational initiatives which subverted white laws against black education were present from the nineteenth-century onwards , taught in one room schools and churches across the south . 
  ** example : ** this is where you chuck in a quote . 
  make it good . 
  read your source for a good quote rather than just one that seems ok b/c you saw it first . 
  * e.g. 
  young men in the south were forced to work all day by the demands of a white economy . 
  however , they `` expressed desire for education '' that was denied by the white ruling class . 
  bad example , but i made it up rather than go search for something . 
  keeping to this structure makes sure that you 're on track . 
  if you can , use the last two sentences of each paragraph to slowly shift your focus towards the next paragraph 's topic , and you 'll have a cohesive essay . 
  ** general tips : **, 
  * aim for 200 word paragraphs . 
  * intro should be 10 % of total word count , no more . 
  * same with conclusion . 
  * everyone writes differently : you might like intro first , then paragraphs , then conclusion . 
  try other ways . 
  generally i write my body first , then do the introduction . 
  i do the conclusion last so i can draw together my arguments . 
  if you 're not a strong speller , you need to do this . 
  * footnote check . 
  if you make easy mistakes while referencing , do this . 
  if you do n't like referencing , do this twice . 
  i enjoy footnoting b/c it means i 'm at the end . 
  i concentrate on it , so i know i 'll be tidy on it . 
  lastly , if you have time , do everything / u/second _ mate said . 
  too often you 'll finish an essay with less than 24hr to deadline . 
  but if you can get it done a week in advance and send it off to friendly tutors/gtas - you 'll get a proofread essay that might go up 5-10 % . 
  i suspect there 's a host of reasons that contribute , but we wo n't find them until one of the two nations releases records of it all . 
  this depends entirely on the radio station and the time of day . 
  generally it is a lot more relaxed though . 
  that 's fair , but the koru flag which they did pick was only two spots above in terms of favourability . 
  requires a change in law , and frankly , no one wants to do that . 
  the provincial competition is far below what it used to be . 
  a lot of players jump from high school straight to provinces now . 
  as an indication of quality , you have to be with a province to be selected for the all blacks . 
  however , the reality is a bit different . 
  for example , alex wylie , who played for the all blacks from 1970-73 , also played 210 games for canterbury in the period 1964-1979 . 
  richie mccaw , who has played for the all blacks since 2001 ( 142 caps ) , and first played for canterbury in 1999 , has only played 34 games for the province in 16 years . 
  he 's almost scored more tries for the abs than he has played games for canterbury . 
  it kind of shows you how our professional players are rarely seen outside the super xv and test rugby now , whereas games used to have attendances that regularly went above 15-20 ,000 . 
  in 1985 , when canterbury [ unsuccessfully ] defended the ranfurly shield against auckland , it was with a crowd of 52,000 people watching . 
  great write up !, 
  only two things i 'd point out ... 
  you mentioned ben franks is ill-disciplined , but you did n't mention crockett or whitelock , both of who like their three times tables enough to share them with every team we play against . 
  barrett is great , but i think it 's his inability to run a backline like carter or sopoaga that has let him down recently . 
  he 's a brilliant runner , no doubt . 
  but unless he learns to control like carter/sopoaga , he 'll never be a starter , which is unfortunate . 
  maybe he 'll get a chance against namibia or the other minnows and show us something . 
  everyone knows that fiji and australia will progress after the home nations teams implode !, 
  it really shows how far scotland has fallen that you think the second biggest upset for the cup is scotland vs. romania for 3rd/4th . 
  the south africans do it with the currie cup . 
  they get bigger turnout for their currie cup matches than they do for most super rugby games . 
  it 's because their governing body cares more about that than super rugby and the money it brings in . 
  maybe it 's a case of funding for nz , i do n't know . 
  but for the best flanker in the world to have turned out for his provincial side ( which is n't amateur - only the heartland championship is ) 34 times in 16 years is pretty horrible . 
  that 's two games a season . 
  why did n't he go play for canty last week for 40min ? 
  stepped a dude from a standing position and made it look easy . 
  then made ~ 15 yards . 
  the department which deals with the banned books process has suggested that anyone buying the book from overseas and bringing it into nz ( even for private use ) contacts a lawyer first because they do n't know how the law can be applied . 
  since it 's a $ 3,000 fine or something , easier to just wait until october to read it . 
  ha , cheers !, 
  i 'm not a lawyer , so i do n't know . 
  following a path of logic , i 'd think that those buyers would be outside the country , and could only be prosecuted if they came here . 
  the receivers should n't be liable , but if they were found to have organised the purchases , that would be distribution . 
  i do n't know how lawyers/govt would see it . 
  i have n't seen a lot of rugby outside nz/aus/rsa in the past year , so this could be wildly wrong . 
  i 've probably missed someone that 'll cause a fuss , but oh well . 
  carter . 
  lambie . 
  michalak . 
  8 . cooper . 
  george ford . 
  reasoning :, 
  carter is still the best , when he 's on form , and he was on form last week . 
  sexton has been getting rave reviews from every quarter , and he 's taken ireland to a 6n win two years running . 
  lambie is south african , and south africans count in 3s . 
  beale is fast , he 's a good kicker , he 's intelligent . 
  he can defend , and he runs like a full back from behind the scrum . 
  michalak has been a solid no . 
  10 forever , and he still plays brilliantly . 
  the kiwi understudy . 
  he 's the fourth best 10 in nz , but he struggles as a starter , so why would you rate him above the others ? 
  cooper . 
  he 's fucking phenomenal when he does things right , he 's good when he does them ok . ca n't defend for shit . 
  rated low . 
  solid player from a family of rugby players , came up through the kiwi system . 
  ford . 
  [ handling this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au24owodxcq ), 
  why was slade left out ? 
  fifth best in the country , made of glass , should n't be there . 
  smith + nonu, 
  de villiers, 
  ~ ~ keith earls ~ ~ . 
  i do n't rate him , but who else do i put here ? 
  there 's a lot of shit talking in this thread ( maybe friendly ) , and i instinctively looked for a fellow kiwi who would appreciate him . 
  i 'm confused , you do n't agree ? 
  is he trash ?
