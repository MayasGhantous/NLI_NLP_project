  for 80 minutes . 
  georgia has been playing well in their european competition too , have n't they ? 
  if anyone followed that tip and lost , i 'm sorry . 
  i had money on rsa by a lot too . 
  no , that 's a completely different fact . 
  i worded it perfectly . 
  i just read the rest of the post . 
  only thing i got right was the eng v. fiji point start :(, 
  was n't 2007 the year the world cup was cancelled during the pools stage ? 
  they 're in good company . 
  some of the greatest all blacks of all time were farmers . 
  colin meads used to train by running up a hill with a sheep under each arm . 
  conrad smith was a lawyer/law student before he got selected for the abs too . 
  mccaw has played 140 tests and been carded three times . 
  he tests the rules with his play , but he is n't a dirty , violent player . 
  cooper however , [ did this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cruyxwxsodm ) he was lucky not to get a red card . 
  there 's a huge difference between cynical play , e.g. 
  tripping a player , and intentionally attacking a player off the ball , and attacking the face . 
  headbutts and punches to the face are instant red cards . 
  it 's assault . 
  that 's why cooper got booed . 
  mccaw being booed for the duration of this morning 's game is perfectly fine . 
  if it continues then it 's a bit sad though . 
  it 's actually the hosts fucking over the rest . 
  all blacks had pretty much even rest periods through 2011 . 
  this year england , wales , and ireland all have pretty good rest period allotments . 
  edit : i think there might also be an issue with football clashes ? 
  i love swing low . 
  i probably should n't , since i first heard it during the 2003 rwc and it 's associated with horrific memories , but i really do . 
  it makes english crowds special . 
  i sat in an irish crowd singing fields of athenry at the 2011 rwc , and it had nothing on the english enthusiasm for swing low . 
  but i do think that it 's wrong to sing it * during * the pacific challenges . 
  it 's as if the singers are saying `` you ca n't do that here , it 's our house ! '', 
  it 's a bit rude . 
  the challenges are being given as a mark of respect . 
  it 's the teams saying to their opposition `` ok , you 're here , we see you , and this is going to be a tough fight . 
  but we 'll take you on . '', 
  to try and drown it out and stop it being heard , is almost like saying that the challenging team does n't matter - it 's not worth listening to their challenge . 
  now that 's plainly bullshit with the all blacks , but samoa , fiji , and tonga present less of a challenge to england . 
  that 's why it 's even more annoying that those three teams are n't afforded the same courtesies of a microphone and cameras for their challenges . 
  i guess my point is that the challenge is a mark of respect for the team they 're facing , and when the crowd sings a song to drown it out , that 's not very respectful - especially when you can hear a pin drop for a kicker . 
  i would much prefer if the crowd sung swing low on either side of the challenges . 
  probably after , because it 's a song that never ends , so it 'd be easier for the crowd to avoid drowning things out . 
  the english would be fucking pissed if they sung swing low in another stadium and someone played pop music over the intercoms to drown our their support for their team . 
  i got downvoted for saying all this the other day , but i 'll reiterate : i love swing low . 
  i also love the expressions of indigenous culture that come from the haka , the cibi , the sivi tau , the sipi tau . 
  i wish that they could coexist without one having to be * better * than the other . 
  tl ; dr swing low is beautiful . 
  the challenges are fantastic . 
  the support for the challenges is somewhat lacking . 
  that 's just luck of the draw . 
  every team in pool a is going to have 3 really hard games , and then uruguay . 
  the all blacks happen to have three relatively easy games post-argentina , which some are speculating will make them soft for the qfs . 
  ireland/france can easily beat argentina if they show up . 
  they have a week 's break between their final game and the qf . 
  surprised beale does n't make the first xv at # 10 . 
  and genia is one of the best 9s in the world if his forwards are on form - which aussie 's are . 
  wayne barnes has been an atrocious referee in the past . 
  in 2007 ( cue jeers ) , he quite literally cost the all blacks a semi final berth . 
  however in the last few years he 's become a really good referee , and because the world cup is the only competition where everyone in the rugby world watches , his new level of competence is now being recognised . 
  it was a shin , not a knee . 
  and carter would be risking a broken leg to try knock someone out with his shin intentionally . 
  hot tip : you will be . 
  aussie does n't heat up until the finals . 
  what exactly is a cynical penalty ? 
  i see it as intentionally breaking the law and not attempting to stay within the bounds of the rules . 
  mccaw bends rules , and pushes them . 
  stuff like the trip are rare from him - 3 yellow cards in 12 years . 
  that 's cynical . 
  he gets watched by referees closely , and you can bet they 'd pick up on law breaking . 
  truth is , he 's the best in the world . 
  he 's honed his skills for so long to do what he does , which is probably why it 's even worse when he does something stupid like today . 
  remember sam warburton ? 
  no one hates him , but he had his cynical moment when he spear tackled the frenchman in ' 11 , and he was widely regarded as mccaw 's biggest rival . 
  that tackle was bullshit anyway . 
  the english winger fell into it , the fijians realised he was being tipped and ** held on so they did n't drop him on his neck , and he was lowered softly ** . 
  the hooker then comes through and pushes him over which made it look much worse . 
  no , what 's teenagerish is assuming that people will break things that do n't belong to them . 
  no , i meant it . 
  different thing . 
  a cynical foul is something like the trip . 
  or kicking a ball away when a penalty has been awarded to the other team . 
  dumping someone on their neck . 
  professional fouls would be conrad smith in the ruck . 
  killing a maul at the try line . 
  things which occur in gameplay , but have to be done a proper way . 
  everything about france is an ` if ' . 
  in nz we know that better than anyone by now, 
  namibia have a better record against ireland than ireland do against scotland . 
  sa v samoa is always good value !, 
  yeah , i agree , but folau is at fb , and i 'd never swap folau out . 
  beale is a brilliant strategist , so i think him + genia could work wonders . 
  mate , the all blacks do n't just slather sponsors across our jerseys !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ unless ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ we 're ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ selling ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ out ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ insurance ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ companies ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ millions ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ dollars . 
  fuck , that seems unnecessarily harsh . 
  it looked worse because of the actions of the english hooker . 
  funny though , he 's just [ been named in the team to face aussie ] ( http://www.ultimaterugby.com/images/entities/105479-17ef7e9c07-7/fiji.png ) . 
  he 'd already announced he was stepping down . 
  it 's one of the reasons the new japanese franchise for the super xv has been in jeopardy .
