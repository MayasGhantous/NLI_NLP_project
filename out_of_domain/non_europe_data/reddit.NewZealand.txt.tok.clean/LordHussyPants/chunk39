  they fight in a ruck , he grabs retallick with one arm , then throws his other arm around retallick 's head ( not allowed ) , to the face ( definitely not allowed ) , where he then grabs ( even more not allowed ) , and pulls . 
  there was nothing accidental about it , he knew what he was doing , and he 's lucky he only got nine weeks for something that could have had him out until the middle of next year . 
  if you 're arguing that the punishment for eye gouging and contact with the face is too long , then look at this : the media release from [ rwc ] ( https://www.rugbyworldcup.com/news/97598 ), 
   with respect to the sanction , the judicial officer deemed the act of foul play merited a low-end entry point of 12 weeks . 
  * low-end * entry is 12 weeks . 
  maybe you do n't know , but this shit does n't fly in rugby , and it is completely indefensible . 
  it has a minimum punishment of 12 weeks because it used to be such a huge problem . 
  the australian team threatened to stop play and walk off the field in * a world cup final * because of french eye gouging . 
  the punishment is there because it 's foul , it 's scummy , and it needs to stop . 
  accept it , move on , and do n't try and defend it . 
  argentina should take it . 
  maybe not easily , but not with difficulty . 
  a neutral difficulty level if you will . 
  it 'd be nice to see georgia win , but really , this is n't the upset i 'd want to see . 
  i 'm enjoying argentina 's increase in world rugby status . 
  japan are a fit team . 
  eddie jones has run them ragged to get them ready , and it shows . 
  i think it was pressure from the thought of what they could do now they 'd beaten sa . 
  scotland won it fair and square , and the 4 day turnaround should n't be apportioned unreasonable amounts of blame . 
  until ma'afu went off , japan were threatening hard . 
  how would it have an impact ? 
  he really embodies the new respect for the haka post-buck shelford .

  most of them like to feel wanted , so if you see someone who might be able to answer your question , do n't feel shy about dropping them a short , polite message letting them know about the question !, 
  this . 
  if people have a question that i can answer , and they pm me , i 'll do my best to put one up . 
  ha , great !, 
  if you can , save them until november . 
  i 'm in the midst of a busy few weeks what with the world cup and the final essays of my degree . 
  i 'll be active through november !, 
  i hope the english defense is better than their dentistry . 
  be nasty to watch wales finding gaps like those in the back line . 
  he 's the best referee so far . 
  they banned fancy dress ? 
  how do you even do that ? 
  i said , `` i hope the english defense is better than their dentistry . 
  it 'd be nasty to watch wales finding gaps as big as those in the back line . '', 
  yeah , when i applied for flair it was with several answers on us history , specifically involving race , i.e. 
  irish migrants and indentures , black civil rights , native americans . 
  i only got the nz history one because i have studied it ( there were n't many qs on nz ) . 
  i do apply the racial histories to nz though , because it 's impossible to separate race from our history . 
  it 's a part of our national myth - `` the best race relations in the world '' , even though it 's patently not true . 
  i do have an old coursebook somewhere with a bunch of essays on race in nz , i 'll try dig it up . 
  other good stuff to look at would be the * huia histories of m\u0101ori * and the new history * tangata whenua * by atholl anderson , judith binney , and aroha harris . 
  i 've put them both in the book list . 
  * huia histories * is a series of essays on m\u0101ori history , written by m\u0101ori . 
  they deal with pre-colonisation , colonisation , and post-colonial m\u0101ori and they touch on a lot of the issues between m\u0101ori and p\u0101keh\u0101 because the writers either experienced them , or were the children of those who did . 
  it also happens to be a beautiful history book . 
  seriously , the design is fantastic . 
  another good source would be the [ new zealand journal of history ] - www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz , do n't know why the formatting would n't link that . 
  ** pool a : ** australia ( 17 ) , wales ( 13 ) , england ( 11 ) . 
  ** pool b : ** scotland ( 14/18 depending on samoa ) , japan ( 12 ) , rsa ( 11 ) . 
  ** pool c : ** nz ( 19 ) , argentina ( 13 ) , georgia ( 9 - if these guys upset arg , then loool ) . 
  ** pool d : ** ireland ( 19 ) , france ( 14 ) , italy ( 10 ) . 
  ** qf1 : ** scotland vs. wales . 
  ** qf2 : ** nz vs. france . 
  ** qf3 : ** ireland vs. argentina . 
  ** qf4 : ** australia vs. japan . 
  ** sf1 : ** nz vs. wales . 
  ** sf2 : ** australia vs. ireland . 
  ** 3rd/4th playoff : ** australia vs. wales . 
  ** final : ** nz vs. ireland . 
  they probably fell over in their rush and he thought he 'd be carded . 
  if ireland won their first world cup in 5 weeks , and it was by beating the all blacks for the first time in history , and it was a good , hard fought match , i think i would still be deliriously happy . 
  my mother raised us with good knowledge of our irish heritage so they 're definitely my second team . 
  nz v ireland will be a perfect ending . 
  japanese money in rugby is a misconception . 
  japanese corporations have the money , not the japanese rfu , which is who would need the money for the franchise . 
  franchises in the super series are owned by the unions , not private owners . 
  you definitely have enough players . 
  super rugby is n't international level - there are plenty of no namers in the squads . 
  the highlanders won this year and have only sent 4 players to the national team . 
  til . 
  the original point stands though - rugby money in japan is largely confined to their domestic competition . 
  that 's not japanese money , that 's money for sanzar . 
  japanese money is what pays the players , which is why they have no one signed up to their team , why they have no coaching staff , and why everyone is staying with the domestic league - because the private backers are throwing money at the players . 
  the japanese rugby union - the only party that matters - is poor as shit compared to those franchises , and it 's crippling the super team before it 's begun . 
  it can add to the pressure though . 
  i most agree with his point about the '03 team . 
  that was an experienced team . 
  johnson , dallaglio , wilkinson , robinson etc. 
  they were all good , game hardened players . 
  now they 've got ... who ? 
  i do n't know any english players off the top of my head except burgess , and he 's a league convert with what , 1 test ? 
  he seems like an sbw experiment being carried out as a final gasp . 
  tonight 's game will reveal all i guess . 
  i did say off the top of my head !, 
  yeah , i 've heard of mike brown . 
  just scanning their team list for the wales game and i recognise names but i could n't put them to faces , or pick out which ones are skilled . 
  i do n't know why i got negged above , am i meant to know every player in a team we play once a year ? 
  haha, 
  nah honestly , i can name players across the big three of the south , but the nh escapes me most of the time . 
  mainly because of the time difference - australia and south africa can watch euro rugby at a half decent time , whereas i only get 4am games . 
  it 'll be interesting to see your scrum in action against the wallabies , because they floundered against fiji . 
  edit : so did their lineouts . 
  not many ... ^ ^ ^ 1100 ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ counting ^ ^ ^ on ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ starting ^ ^ ^ 15 . 
  yeah that 's always the goal , but the foundation problem is that their super team is competing with an exceptionally rich rugby competition by the standards of the southern hemisphere . 
  so yeah , japan is where the money is for sanzar , and for the top league , but not for the super team . 
  if sanzar funneled money in , it 'd be ok , but they have n't done that and that 's causing a shit load of issues with expansion right now .
