  `` take him off , he 's hobbling . '', 
  `` drag him off . '', 
  `` bench him . '', 
  * try *, 
  i think it 's mostly to do with rotation policies from graham henry 's time ( cycling through lots of different players to breed competition and test combinations ) . 
  it 's possible that the fitness regime the all blacks have gives extra legs to our guys too . 
  also , if you look at [ our most capped players ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_new_zealand_national_rugby_union_team_player_records ) , three of them are hookers , and two of them ( mealamu and hore ) , played together for the entirety of their careers . 
  from memory , mealamu has been the # 1 hooker through most of that period , with hore as his reserve . 
  but because hookers and props get benched often , the two built up a huge stack of caps despite rolesharing . 
  then you get fitzpatrick who just dominated the hooker position for a decade , as mccaw has done . 
  the really interesting one to me is nonu , who will reach 100 against georgia or tonga - but was n't a constant member of the squad until after 2007 . 
  before then he was in and out , yet he 's still going to become a centurion when 10 years ago everyone thought he 'd be another player that missed out on a selector 's whim . 
  hey / u/wallopyjoe , can i ask why you put 15-9 , then 1-8 ? 
  is it an english format for team layouts ? 
  hmm , i wonder how it started . 
  i always get confused when i see aaron smith followed by tony woodcock :(, 
  i went and found out !, 
  apparently it originates from the old numbering style , where 1 was the fullback , and 15 the number 8 . 
  so when they changed the numbers to the current system , they stuck with the layout of the former , i.e. 
  backs from outermost to innermost , and forwards from the front row of the scrum backwards . 
  no one was fantastic against namibia , and to be honest , i do n't remember much because i had just woken up and it was pretty boring . 
  nonu 's weird . 
  he 's shit in the super xv 90 % of the time ( this year he was great ) , but he gets selected because everyone knows that once he 's in black he 'll be the best 12 in the country . 
  has your acestream conked out ? 
  you say that , but their entire site is down and downloads are n't working . 
  slade 's world class , but not all black class . 
  he 's there because he can cover 12 , 11 , 14 , 15 . 
  he 's also made of glass - broke his jaw twice in one season , and broke his leg the next . 
  barrett is phenomenal . 
  he ca n't run the game though , and that 's an issue which means he 's only really worthwhile as a substitute at the moment . 
  he made the team because he can cover all the back line positions too . 
  sopoaga is the man who should be there , but he is a specialist 10 , and nothing else . 
  he 's the magician who ran the all black back line in south africa this year , and he 's an ace with the boot too . 
  he got left behind because the others provide extra options , but really , he 's the second choice first five at the moment with cruden out . 
  overall , i 'm not that worried unless carter goes down in the qf . 
  if he makes it all the way through , we 're fine . 
  if he goes out against georgia or tonga , we 're fine , because sopoaga will be brought over and only misses one match . 
  so long as we have carter/sopoaga for the sf and final if we make it , 10 should n't be a problem for us . 
  come on , it was almost there . 
  jesus christ , you could hear the air going out of that canuck 's lungs, 
  yeah , she 'll be right . 
  there 's always more coming through . 
  wales picked up gareth anscombe from us because he was about 7th in line for the # 10 jersey here . 
  could n't wait , so he played the maternal right card and shifted countries . 
  hey wait , i thought this is the game we just watched on itv ? 
  bribery , filth . 
  `` no , no , no , we have the crowd to sing ` swing low ' , but thank you for the offer . 
  off you go now ! '', 
  yeah , there 's england vs. wales , then wales vs. england , and i think after that there 's the welsh vs. the english, 
  i 've seen these teams play each other at the world cup twice now , and both times it was * amazing * . 
  this is so exciting . 
  bets on how long it takes for :, 
  first yellow . 
  first head high . 
  first concussion . 
  first fight . 
  first hospital pass . 
  wayne barnes and forward passes right guys, 
  went from 16-9 to 25-28 . 
  not an annihilation but definitely a ~ ~ bit ~ ~ lot of choking there . 
  maybe i should have slept through the night and watched this game instead of staying up to watch the first two :(, 
  you 'd be more likely to save england 's campaign by feeding cipriani to her majesty 's corgis . 
  [ he looks * a lot * like the bloke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cugwim6e39g ) who stormed the field and tackled the ref a few years back in sa . 
  they sound like they were being a bit pedantic about it all , but i think their view was that the game came before the league . 
  in other words , they could n't play competitively , but a friendly meant that you all got to enjoy the spirit of the game . 
  it seems a bit petty to me that you would say you did n't want to risk injury if it 's not competitive , but that 's your choice , and i would n't support anyone belittling you for that . 
  edit : my advice would be keep playing . 
  this is one team , surely not all the teams are like that ? 
  it 's not fudged at all though . 
  there are 4 pools , and ~ 10 tier 1 teams . 
  there 's always going to be three in a group , and there 's always going to be a difficult pool . 
  the only reason anyone is complaining this time is because two of the home nations are in the same pool and are in for a struggle . 
  edit : with a very unscientific method , i rearranged the pools based on world rankings from 3rd dec , 2014 , and the random numbers drawn in 2011 that were used for seeding . 
  the bold numbers in brackets are what the 2014 seed would be ; the unbolded numbers are the 2011 seed . 
  | pool a | pool b | pool c | pool d |, 
  ireland ( 6 , ** 3 ** ) | south africa ( 2 , ** 2 ** ) | new zealand ( 1 , ** 1 ** ) | england ( 5 , ** 4 ** ), 
  australia ( 3 , ** 5 ** ) | france ( 4 , ** 7 ** ) | scotland ( 12 , ** 8 ** ) | wales ( 9 , ** 6 ** ), 
  fiji | japan | georgia | canada, 
  the pools are done by dropping 20 balls into 5 pots . 
  first pot is seeds 1-4 , second is 5-8 , third is 9-12 , and so on . 
  so ireland would have moved from pot 2 to pot 1 , england from 2 -  1 , australia 1 -  2 , france 1 -  2 , scotland 3 -  2 , wales 3 -  2 , argentina 2 -  3 , and samoa 2 -  3 . 
  south africa , new zealand , italy and tonga remain the same . 
  the numbers are randomly drawn from the pots to create the pools . 
  because of the rankings , two tier 1 sides were guaranteed to be placed together with argentina , the only tier 1 outside the top eight seeds . 
  the only difference in reality ? 
  wales had a bad year in 2012 , and got dropped out of the top 8 , becoming the bogey tier 1 . 
  ** edit 2 : ** here are the other iterations of the pool of death , just so you know you 're not alone in losing the lottery . 
  ** rwc 2011 : ** argentina , england , and scotland in pool b. argentina was the 4th seed overall , england the 6th , scotland 9th . 
  ** rwc 2007 : ** australia , fiji , and wales in pool b. i guess it does n't really count because fiji is n't a tier 1 , but they knocked out wales . 
  in pool d were argentina , france , and ireland . 
  argentina won the pool , ireland missed the qfs . 
  sidenote , pool c had new zealand , scotland , and italy . 
  is italy a tier 1 team ? 
  i 'm not really sure , but if they are , that 's a pool with 3x tier 1s . 
  ** rwc 2003 : ** pool a had australia , argentina , and ireland . 
  argentina missed out this time ( by a point ! ) . 
  this was the only real pool of death . 
  depending on how we classify fiji and italy ... 
  pool b had france , fiji , scotland . 
  pool d had new zealand , wales , italy .
