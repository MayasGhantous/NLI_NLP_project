  ** rwc 1999 : ** skipping this because the pools were whack . 
  ** rwc 1995 : ** pool c had new zealand , ireland , wales . 
  pool b had england , samoa , italy , argentina . 
  ** rwc 1991 : ** pool 3/c had australia , samoa , wales . 
  the ranking changes seem a bit extreme , even taking into account the double points for rwc matches . 
  wales were only 0.41 behind england , but that calculator catapults them up 2.5 points when wales won within the 15pt margin ? 
  reckon that bloke 's got an issue with his formula . 
  apparently it 's for `` the prestige of the tournament '' . 
  fuck off , they 're still test matches . 
  would n't you prefer genia/cooper at 9/10 ? 
  i was talking about the fact that genia/cooper is the only combination australia has had since gregan/larkham that actually worked well . 
  someone downvotes me every time i mention this pair lol . 
  do n't know why , name a better halves pairing australia can offer . 
  i hope there 's an aussie contingent singing waltzing matilda tonight . 
  it makes sense now that i know the chariot they 're talking about is tom wood 's foot . 
  australia to top the group on 17 , wales to follow on 14 , england to miss out by 2 points on 12 . 
  nah , not accusing , i just find it funny . 
  genia/toomua would be interesting . 
  maybe in future - carter started at 12 too , and they played him there constantly for a few seasons before shifting him in . 
  what i did n't realize until yesterday is that jdv has been in 3 or 4 world cups , but has been injured in the pool stages of all of them . 
  incredibly unlucky . 
  it 's like the fanatical version of wilkinson . 
  it 's not so much a weird ritual on the part of the kicker , but i love how every time cruden takes a kick , he adjusts himself on his heels , and everyone charges early . 
  dislike him immensely , but that seems unfortunate . 
  they 're etched into my brain too , but generally with laughter . 
  he 's fantastic on attack though , which is why i do rate him somewhat even despite him being a shit personality . 
  funny that you posted this and 10min later he got a yellow though, 
  the piper 's are playing waaaltzing matilda, 
  schalk burger did it two days ago and no one gave a shit . 
  fixed . 
  gave japan a sneaky bonus point against the usa to get them through ahead of your lot !, 
  * cough * heyneke ca n't play nonu and smith , wrong team buddy !, 
  edit : it also sounds like allende and kriel are having their own injury troubles . 
  from [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/27/south-africa-jean-de-villiers-rugby-world-cup-broken-jaw ) :, 
   as the other two centres in south africa 's squad , damian de allende and jesse kriel , were among those to leave the field early , meyer may be facing a crisis in midfield . 
  indeed , kriel 's condition was serious enough to warrant de villiers 's return to the field for the final minutes , despite his broken jaw . 
  the same could presumably be said of the injury to de allende , whom kriel had replaced early in the second half . 
  you do n't put a broken jaw back on the field unless something really bad is happening . 
  he broke his jaw earlier this year , did n't he ? 
  it 's twice in about 6 months i think . 
  an upset 's not an upset without far reaching consequences !, 
  besides , scotland have played well so far , and south africa just lost their captain + their two midfielders are injured . 
  it 's going to be a hell of a game . 
  they look more in form atm , and injuries are assailing the saffas . 
  they fucking crumbled against fiji . 
  wales would have been replaced in pot 3 by argentina , but no one would care then because if it 's not a home nations team , who gives a shit , right ? 
  or wales ( anscombe ) , scotland ( maitland , hardie ) , or japan ( that winger bloke ) . 
  but it 's country of birth , not what you consider yourself . 
  scotland to beat rsa , japan to beat usa & samoa with 1 bonus point , japan to go through on h2h tiebreaker ahead of south africa . 
  * fingers crossed *, 
  that 's a fair point actually . 
  i never played rugby for a team here , but i did play football . 
  i always had a rugby ball floating around the house though , and once i got to high school , we played rugby at lunch on most days of the year , or practiced goal kicking . 
  so i have a * very basic * ability to pass and catch a rugby ball , and how to kick it . 
  i guess i 've never really thought about the immersion . 
  ( now that i see how far people like carter and biggar kick the ball though , i 'm very embarrassed by my penalties taken from the 22 on a 45 degree angle ), 
  also never played cricket but have had a cricket set since before i can remember , and spent all summer playing it haha . 
  maybe it 's just the outdoors type lifestyle we were raised with . 
  i meant football as in soccer haha . 
  coincidentally , the first toy ball i remember having was a little rubber american football , presumably because my dad could n't find a rugby one at the time . 
  suppoort nz , will back ireland , then wales , then south africa ( money ) . 
  probably . 
  let 's all be honest , it 's nothing new for world cup teams to be spying on other teams . 
  the only matter of interest will be if anything is done about it by the officials . 
   mr angry is , on current form , the world 's best full-back, 
  no he 's not . 
   and if you do n't think he is then you can tell him . 
  yes he is . 
  do n't blame them , afternoon rugby is the best kind . 
  true . 
  it might be for international audiences - to try and grow the fanbase . 
  8am la , 11am nyc , midnight tokyo , 2am australia , 5pm south africa . 
  that gives them pretty good times for america/rsa/japan . 
  moving games later by an hour or two would probably lose japan , earlier would lose america . 
  argentina does n't appear in your caption , despite being a definite contender . 
  they pushed the all blacks , and they tore apart georgia . 
  beat south africa 1-2 months back , and will challenge ireland/france in the quarters . 
  australia have n't met a challenge yet , and have done enough to exercise their players without taking mass casualties \u00e0 la wales . 
  their second xv put up 11 tries against uruguay , with no penalties . 
  they 're confident , and that 's dangerous . 
  england have n't looked the goods at all . 
  their first game was a hard slog , when it should have been easy . 
  give them a pass because it was the opening game , but then they followed it up with a bad performance against wales . 
  as / u/doctordbx said `` they had the script prepared in advance and had no idea what to do when the script failed '' . 
  i called the english inexperienced a few days back , and this is why . 
  france has n't met a challenge yet , and wo n't until the qfs ( because how is ireland a challenge when they know they 'll go through anyway ? ), 
  ireland * see france * . 
  new zealand slow to start against argentina , boring against namibia . 
  injury free . 
  they seem more intent on going through their paces rather than doing an australia and putting tries up . 
  i.e. , against namibia they took opportunities for scrums/lineouts when kicks or taps were on offer . 
  scotland should win their pool . 
  i honestly thought they 'd lose the qf spot to samoa , but now it 's them and sa/japan as the most likely option . 
  they struggled with japan in the first half , but they adapted in the second and soared . 
  their game against south africa will be the crux of the pool . 
  south africa floundered against japan , came strong against samoa . 
  the recovery is a good sign . 
  the injuries are n't . 
  jdv , de allende , and kriel all went off against samoa ( jdv even came back on with the broken jaw ) . 
  if they lose to scotland , they need other results to go their way to avoid being knocked out .
