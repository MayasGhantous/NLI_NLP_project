  [ cartoonists even joked about him before the cup . 
  ] ( http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/5843790/cartoonists-uncanny-cup-prediction ), 
  why do n't they just bring in a centre , shift burgess to the flanks ? 
  everyone says he 's meant to be a 6 , so he 's obviously the right build . 
  yeah , he was n't expecting it to at all . 
  he 's so shocked after . 
  he only did it to get the advantage penalty . 
  not made for off road though . 
  nope , just dismembered welsh rugby players . 
  yeah i think his whole episode helped me to get past the rugby fervour that surrounds the all blacks and just treat it as a game . 
  a really important game , but still just a game , played by regular people . 
  oh ok , everyone just seemed kind of upset about easter . 
  or is it just that vunipola was so much better than his backups ? 
  ^ ^ ^ australia ^ ^ ^ has ^ ^ ^ lost ^ ^ ^ wycliff ^ ^ ^ palu ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ you 're ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ luck ^ ^ ^ pommies !, 
  i have a feeling that being that outspoken about your employers might be viewed different in japanese culture to other cultures . 
  especially when you consider that he is basically saying they 're shit at their jobs . 
  [ vine of it from a different angle .

  how do you fuck up a kick to the ball that badly ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ he ^ ^ ^ ^ should ^ ^ ^ ^ play ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ english ^ ^ ^ ^ football ^ ^ ^ ^ team, 
  i ca n't imagine the difficulties associated with fixing up something as bad as apartheid . 
  tana 's not the best 13 we 've ever had , and justin marshall was complete trash . 
  sid going/david kirk/aaron smith/dave loveridge - all better half backs than marshall . 
  13 , i do n't know . 
  joe stanley comes to mind . 
  there 's been a hundred years of all blacks , and i do n't know all of them . 
  but i know that tana 's not the best . 
  is predicting an english exit grief giving ? 
  yes , he should have been . 
  but he was n't . 
  funny that no one is complaining about this like they were about carter 's far more accidental shin collision with the argie lock . 
  well i mean , you did give the world wayne barnes and mark reason . 
  you ca n't expect us to take that sitting down !, 
  recall dallaglio !, 
  the fun thing is that fiji have beaten wales before in a do or die world cup match !, 
  promising for wales is that they then beat fiji in 2011 66-0 . 
  actually ? 
  shit . 
  well the original 's much nicer, 
  we laugh at your struggles , 
  then we fall to pieces and cry from the stress of the playoffs . 
  i 'm kind of dreading the media coverage of the pre-qfs if france loses to ireland and faces us in cardiff . 
  until then , we 'll giggle at the troubles of the mortals !, 
  when i was home sick from school in '04 i saw an episode of this awesome tv show about a high school , but the teachers , not the students . 
  for a week after that , i watched it every day until i was back to school . 
  i forgot about it . 
  a few years later , i found out about torrenting tv shows and found out what the show had been called : boston public . 
  then began the hunt . 
  i could n't find it anywhere at all . 
  i forgot about it for a year or two , then i remembered again . 
  i looked on public trackers , private trackers , streaming sites . 
  it was as if there was no digital record of the show . 
  imdb discussion boards ( ugh ) had gossip about dvd releases . 
  i searched amazon , i searched fox catalogues , i even emailed the company that had released other series by the director , the channel , the production company . 
  they said it was never released and never would be . 
  then one day in 2012 someone linked me to a new ( to me ) streaming site . 
  i looked through and was amazed at what they had . 
  obscure shows that no one cared about torrenting were on this site . 
  after a week of watching , i remembered boston public . 
  a few minutes of stressful clicking trying to find the ` bos ' section , and i started scrolling - there it was !, 
  i had never been so happy to find a tv show or movie , and it lived up to my expectations completely . 
  he 's been fantastic this tournament . 
  the fact that he managed to sort out with the tmo whether a high tackle should have been a yellow card or not , * while running downfield and not stopping the game * was brilliant . 
  it was the equivalent of seeing a good 10 run his backline . 
  i agree with you on this . 
  i think it 's one rule for some , one rule for others . 
  i think this is the part that tier 1/tier 2 plays in the cup , or even racism , and it 's nasty . 
  i do n't think that the scheduling is a symptom of this racism , or elitism , but i would definitely say that this sort of thing is , especially when nadolo is ruled out of a pool defining game against a home nation , but wood manages to escape a sanction to play for a home nation . 
  you know , i watched that and it was horrible , but looking at it again , i do n't see how nadolo flips him . 
  i think pocock stood up because he was getting cleared up , and then he loses his balance doing so . 
  now that vunipola 's injured , lancaster must be shitting himself at the prospect of selecting more englishmen, 
  that 's not a high tackle , it 's a fucking choke hold . 
  funny , because i look at his legs and see him planting the left foot by the hips , and the right foot swings . 
  now i 'm no mathematician , but on my body , that means you 're either doing the splits , or your foot 's connecting with my head . 
  accidental or not , that was reckless , idiotic , uncoordinated , and life threatening . 
  then you do n't understand at all . 
  he 's 32 , and has been over there since he was 28 . 
  i 'm guessing he 's honed his technique for one , and that they were willing to pay big for a pacific prop . 
  remember carl hayman ? 
  made huge amounts in france because they did n't have anyone who could scrum as well as he did . 
  he 's also got a business qualification , which may have helped negotiations . 
  it 's funny how the article kinda makes it seem like a sad thing that we 're losing these players to europe . 
  but carter , nonu , and smith are all in their 30s , have all given ~ 10 years of service , and are now taking the money for their career finale . 
  this is how it should be . 
  their leaving makes way for new all blacks , and super rugby players at their franchises , and that 's how our system works so well and rejuvenates . 
  next year we 're going to have fekitoa , sbw as the incumbents , and a host of others challenging from the ranks below . 
  it 's not like we 're losing three players in the style of nick evans , who could n't beat out carter and left after 20 caps . 
  these three guys have reached centuries ( nonu next game , smith is about 10 short if memory serves ) . 
  he needs a rugby team , not a hospital ward, 
  do n't bring football into it , you 're not much good at that either, 
  edit : guess i did n't entirely leave the sledge thread behind . 
  i 'll go now . 
  sopoaga is better under pressure . 
  cruden will be # 1 . 
  he 's a champ ay , hope he has another good year in '16 and gets called up . 
  completely different game though . 
  he 's a fantastic athlete , but there 's doubt about whether our regular all blacks ( messam/sbw ) will be able to get back into shape for 7s style rugby . 
  ben smith and beauden barrett already declined the opportunity . 
  stadium sizes . 
  every stadium has a different sized in goal area based on what the pitch is designed for .
