  it would be , which would be a horrible thing to do , and not something that i have done here . 
   people on this sub just have a real problem with the english . 
  people say itv is too biased even though it 's a fucking english channel . 
  no one in england gives a shit about wales , ireland , nz , aus etc they care about england, 
  that 's what / u/j0ydivisi0n said . 
  he complained about people criticising the major broadcaster of the ** world ** cup for making the entire event about england . 
  then he complained that no one in england gives a shit about anything outside their country , which is not the attitude anyone wants from a ** world ** cup host . 
  then he complained that people have a problem with the english . 
  which is n't true . 
  i like english people . 
  i do n't like self-centred people like him , who defend the official tv broadcaster of an ** international ** event for being jingoistic and parochial . 
  i even specifically said * `` morons like you '' * . 
  i was n't generalising english people , english redditors , or english flairs on this sub . 
  i was clearly , and specifically , attacking itv , that user , and anyone like him , who got overly defensive over a shoddy tv channel that has been roundly criticised on all fronts for the past two weeks . 
   but i guess people like you and the others on here are riding that england hate train and take quotes out of context from a coach that has n't done anything noteworthy since 2003, 
  i prefaced my very first post by saying that the headline was misquoting woodward . 
  did you read my posts ? 
  or did you just blindly jump to the defense of a fellow englishman ? 
  do n't you jinx us you cheeky bastard, 
  this was a lovely reply . 
  i agree that itv are chasing the dollar / ( pound ? 
  ) , and as you ( everyone else on this sub barring the above ) have said , it 's a great pity . 
  that said , i hope you enjoy the game , despite the atrocious narration !, 
  hey australia, 
  keep those jerseys clean, 
  only gold you guys will get your hands on, 
  oh my god the american commentators !, 
  they just called the centres blockers !, 
  it 's beautiful, 
  why is cricket such a flimsy fucking measure of quality, 
  christ , heart in throat as he started fist pumping before the line . 
  do n't drop it kid, 
  touched it up a bit for you . 
  * cowboys win final, 
  i suppose chasing pounds sounds a bit like a flesh fetish . 
  why do n't you just adopt the euro already ? 
  karen from accounts is n't the same as media . 
  in fact , it 'd be more like the auditor from outside the company asking you a q. 
  are you an ab ? 
  because carter 's just strutted on with a new hairdo, 
  oh no we 're doing lineout drives, 
  * have they learned nothing *, 
  * psst * there were three tries !, 
  start the game again !, 
  did anyone have $ on naholo/savea/milner-skudder to be top try scorers for the tournament ? 
  because it 's happening . 
  so mediocre in memory . 
  i did wonder if some of those handling errors were more down to the passer , specifically aaron smith . 
  it looked like he was throwing some bullet passes when pop passes would have done . 
  then there were also the standard ones every team has , like victor vito leaving it behind him on the wing , and someone ( conrad smith ? 
  ben smith ? ), 
  trying to pop it over a defender and putting it too high for the winger . 
  he 's played there before in a wc match . 
  he can cover , and it gave him a run while keeping the effectiveness of the backrow . 
  they booed him in the later sideline kick and he got it spot on . 
  positives : we now know who our starting props should be !, 
  ( not crockett ), 
  i put him in my [ top centres list at the start of the tournament ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyunion/comments/3l11d7/the_10_best_centres_at_the_rugby_world_cup/cv299pq ) and everyone laughed at me :(, 
  i think you guys missed a joke, 
  new zealanders and australians died at gallipoli because of british incompetence . 
  they were following the orders of british officers , for whatever reason . 
  the irony is that they were sent somewhere by mistake , and the anzacs completed the task anyway . 
  but as far as i 'm concerned , that is so far separate from rugby that it has no bearing at all . 
  he does n't have to speak for everyone , because when people complained about english arrogance in 2008 , they were n't talking about the little old grandmas in the retirement home in the back end of cornwall . 
  i have a few reasons . 
  i want wales and australia to advance . 
  i like wales , and out of australia/england , i 'd find it funnier if england was eliminated . 
  the english media , key example : itv . 
  the coverage has made this seem like it 's the rugby english cup rather than the marquee event that is showing the world developing rugby . 
  it 's annoying . 
  arrogance . 
  it 's there . 
  it 's annoying . 
  because the consequences of the press propping up the english team are oftentimes our teams getting dragged through the mud . 
  this article , cipriani just trashed the aussie team . 
  considering they have better players in half the positions , it 's patently untrue . 
  jesus , that 'd be upping the ante even for irishmen . 
  as the australians on here point out though , he has regular brainfarts . 
  ... the grand final of 3rd place getters ? 
   it is simply ` old boys club ' protectionism, 
  this is everything wrong with european rugby . 
  from the clubs hoarding sh players on contracts that stop them from playing for their countries , to refusing to expand beyond their old competition . 
  ideally , the 6n would remain how it is and add a divison ii with georgia , portugal , spain , russia , and romania . 
  i think the other european teams are quite a way behind those 5 . 
  the problem with a division system is that automatic relegation/promotion for the teams at the end of the season might not be reflective of quality - there should really be a playoff between , say , italy and georgia . 
  world rugby could put a stop to it , but they do n't . 
  who 's got the most power at world rugby ? 
  europe . 
  boudjelol probably does n't care about denying them national appearances , but does he get to keep paul o'connell from playing for ireland ? 
  lobbe for argentina ? 
  the rugby system is fucked in europe . 
  hey , can you not reply to my comments if you do n't know what you 're talking about ? 
  i did n't mention australia , new zealand or england . 
  they 're irrelevant to what i said . 
  top 14 is run by the french rugby union ? 
  they answer to world rugby . 
  it could be easily sorted out . 
  are they below the 6 nations , or are they separate and of lesser quality ? 
  if there 's no interaction between the two , they 're not the same competition , which is what i was saying should happen . 
  he was for me because i had n't seen the others haha,
