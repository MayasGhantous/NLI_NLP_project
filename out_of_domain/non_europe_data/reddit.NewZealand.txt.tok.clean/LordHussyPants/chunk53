  with a very unscientific method , i rearranged the pools based on world rankings from 3rd dec , 2014 , and the random numbers drawn in 2011 that were used for seeding . 
  the bold numbers in brackets are what the 2014 seed would be ; the unbolded numbers are the 2011 seed . 
  | pool a | pool b | pool c | pool d |, 
  ireland ( 6 , ** 3 ** ) | south africa ( 2 , ** 2 ** ) | new zealand ( 1 , ** 1 ** ) | england ( 5 , ** 4 ** ), 
  australia ( 3 , ** 5 ** ) | france ( 4 , ** 7 ** ) | scotland ( 12 , ** 8 ** ) | wales ( 9 , ** 6 ** ), 
  fiji | japan | georgia | canada, 
  the pools are done by dropping 20 balls into 5 pots . 
  first pot is seeds 1-4 , second is 5-8 , third is 9-12 , and so on . 
  so ireland would have moved from pot 2 to pot 1 , england from 2 -  1 , australia 1 -  2 , france 1 -  2 , scotland 3 -  2 , wales 3 -  2 , argentina 2 -  3 , and samoa 2 -  3 . 
  south africa , new zealand , italy and tonga remain the same . 
  the numbers are randomly drawn from the pots to create the pools . 
  because of the rankings , two tier 1 sides were guaranteed to be placed together with argentina , the only tier 1 outside the top eight seeds . 
  the only difference in reality ? 
  wales had a bad year in 2012 , and got dropped out of the top 8 , becoming the bogey tier 1 . 
  based on the ranks from 2014 , pools could have been any top two teams + argentina , who would not be a pushover side . 
  the ludicrous thing is that people are suggesting extra pools be added . 
  why ? 
  so that the top 10 can stay in longer ? 
  how does that present rugby to the world ? 
  is this a sport where the elite get rules bent for them ? 
  this was one of the best pool stages in history , * because * pool a was so tough . 
  japan was the icing on the cake . 
  here are the other iterations of the pool of death , just so you know you 're not alone in losing the lottery . 
  ** rwc 2011 : ** argentina , england , and scotland in pool b. argentina was the 4th seed overall , england the 6th , scotland 9th . 
  ** rwc 2007 : ** australia , fiji , and wales in pool b. i guess it does n't really count because fiji is n't a tier 1 , but they knocked out wales . 
  in pool d were argentina , france , and ireland . 
  argentina won the pool , ireland missed the qfs . 
  sidenote , pool c had new zealand , scotland , and italy . 
  is italy a tier 1 team ? 
  i 'm not really sure , but if they are , that 's a pool with 3x tier 1s . 
  ** rwc 2003 : ** pool a had australia , argentina , and ireland . 
  argentina missed out this time ( by a point ! ) . 
  this was the only real pool of death . 
  depending on how we classify fiji and italy ... 
  pool b had france , fiji , scotland . 
  pool d had new zealand , wales , italy . 
  ** rwc 1999 : ** skipping this because the pools were whack . 
  ** rwc 1995 : ** pool c had new zealand , ireland , wales . 
  pool b had england , samoa , italy , argentina . 
  ** rwc 1991 : ** pool 3/c had australia , samoa , wales . 
  five pools of four was done in 1999 and it gave the second place getters an extra game each . 
  england bowed out early then too . 
  it also guarantees that the top teams advance and do n't challenge each other before the qfs , which is dumb . 
  what 's the point of being in a pool of nz , england , georgia , and namibia , and knowing you have no hope of getting out as georgia ? 
  or no hope of losing as england ? 
  unfortunately argentina does n't get the recognition it deserves , because you 're not european , there 's no real big club competition there , and you 're not from the big 3 of the sh . 
  it 's despicable , but luckily it 's changed somewhat with the rugby championship . 
  with laughter ? 
  the other pools did n't have anyone challenging for top 2 spots . 
  pool b : france , fiji , scotland . 
  pool c : south africa , england , samoa . 
  pool d : nz , wales , italy . 
  edit : i meant it was the only real pool of death at the 2003 cup , not the only real one ever . 
  i agree that fiji definitely got the tough end of the deal of the four teams involved . 
  i did n't see the rest of your argument , so ca n't comment . 
  i would argue nz have been poor relative to expectations in all 3 games . 
  that 's why i think they can pick up . 
  i think they struggled vs. argentina , used the two minnows to fix that somewhat . 
  ireland had two strong games and then seemingly floundered . 
  that worries me . 
   and a weak game vs. italy was shaking off the cobwebs having played two tier 2 teams in a row, 
  maybe this is it , i certainly hope so . 
  even after australia 's demolition of england on the weekend , the radio hosts here were talking about the likelihood of ireland taking them out in the semi . 
  i would say ireland are the northern hemisphere 's best hope . 
  england were guaranteed a spot in those playoffs . 
  it was nz , england , italy , and tonga . 
  the other pools were equally predictable :, 
  pool a : south africa , scotland , spain , uruguay . 
  pool c : france , fiji , canada , namibia . 
  pool d : wales , argentina , samoa , japan . 
  pool e : ireland , australia , usa , romania . 
  you can look at those , and with the exception of d , know exactly who 's going to advance to the qf playoffs/qfs . 
  that 's what i meant by `` do n't challenge each other '' . 
  there was no chance of elimination for nz if they lost to england , or for ireland if they lost to australia . 
  the pools were a formality , that 's all . 
  as for your second point , what would your alternative be ? 
  australia , nz , south africa , and wales in the one pool ? 
  georgia , namibia , japan , and romania making up another ? 
  150-0 in the final sounds promising . 
  stop discounting argentina . 
  they were equal to the 2003 irish team ( lost 15-16 ) . 
  they beat scotland in 2011 , who were a tier 1 nation ranked two spots above them the day before the tournament began . 
  they only lost to england by 4 points ( 13-9 ) ; england was ranked 5th . 
  the pool had 5th , 7th , and 9th together . 
  if it was 1st , 3rd , 5th , people would bitch . 
  they were three teams of relatively equal strength = pool of death . 
  oh and in 2003 , argentina was ranked 7th , australia 4th , and ireland 3rd . 
  definite pool of death . 
  they will if you guys pick up a first five curse like we did four years back . 
  how do you know if a rugby fan is english ? 
  they 'll tell you about that time they won the cup, 
  you know that saying `` do n't bite the hand that feeds you '' ? 
  england just fed you a quarter final , pull those teeth back, 
  you 're in for a treat  irish fans are fantastic . 
  my only suggestion is some sort of coat . 
  i got soaked in beer when i sat amongst the irish fans because they all jumped up with glasses in hand to cheer the australian downfall . 
  i think it 's eric roberts, 
  sorry , i meant irish fans at a rwc . 
  i 've never seen ireland play the abs , but i 'd dearly love to . 
  was that the 78min game ?
