  no moody to start ? 
   their nickname is used almost as often as the name of nation , slavishly , sycophantically . 
  gee , it 's almost like how kiwis talk about the wallabies and the springboks with a sense of awe . 
  but the english beat them a little bit more than they beat us , do n't they ? 
  funny how he does n't care about the lelos , the pumas , or the brave blossoms . 
   the all blacks ' haka has been described as `` a privilege '', 
  but not the cibi , sivi tau , or sipi tau , right ? 
  because fiji , samoa , and tonga are just a few brown blokes who are no threat to england . 
  definitely double red , and a ban for whatever the high end offence is . 
  it 's bullying . 
  that 's what domestic abuse is . 
  league sends players off if they 're too much of a problem too . 
  i 'm pretty sure they 're banned on / r/worldnews for / r/newzealand for being an unreliable source, 
  must be worldnews then . 
  there 's an error when you try to submit the link saying `` this is n't a real news source '' , it 's amazing . 
  what level of rugby are you referring to with 20 pound tickets ? 
   i 'm a huge fan of the northern style and all the quater-finals games were close . 
  i dont really see the southern style having a huge leg up on us . 
  our defence is amazing we just need to score more points . 
  could the `` huge leg up '' possibly be the ability to score points ? 
  that is after all , where wales failed in their game against australia with significant advantage .

  then there 's [ this tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/thesixler/status/656645813960114176 ) where he admits that this is something he 's seen before * but still does n't care to address * . 
  that 's really depressing . 
  the nzrfu had this fear ( which was probably well founded given 2007 ) that we might dip out of rwc11 early , so they assigned all these towns a local team . 
  so the idea was that every team was to have a local fanbase that would support them throughout the cup , so that tourists would feel the vibe everywhere . 
  i ca n't find the list of town/team pairings , but i remember one picture of the main square of some small place that was plastered in the flags and colours of a minnow team , and the people even had the jerseys . 
  i guess it 's partly planning , and partly the competition between rugby and football in the uk . 
  this was the biggest thing in nz sport for 20 years , and we really needed it to succeed . 
  this thread is really interesting . 
  i mentioned rugby to my mum the other day , and she said that the boys she met over there did n't know who the all blacks were , because they were all into football . 
  she 'd lived in belfast as a kid for a few years , so i asked , `` was this in 67 ? '', 
  and she said `` no , it was when we went back in 1999 , and met all my cousins ' kids . '', 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ long ^ ^ ^ ^ lineout . 
  the guy still played 63 tests . 
  that 's huge . 
  i would * hate * to be a sports reporter . 
  they have to churn out articles every day , and usually it 's the same shit from last week being recycled to make it through to the weekend . 
  colin slade ( 10 ) , beauden barrett ( 10 ) , perenara ( 9 ) . 
  they 're the ones that stand out to me . 
  the others i 'm not going to make a concrete decision on . 
  brilliant from start to finish . 
  so basically the super rugby for ireland/italy/scotland / wales ? 
  $ 40 nz is n't that bad for a ticket , but i would n't be spending that much as a regular week to week thing . 
  it 's an english journalist , should i be pointing my comments at someone else ? 
  i dunno , i 'd try stop my friends from being dickheads like that rather than idly stand by . 
  yeah , it was n't a bragging/horn tooting post , just an observation about how nz planned out for the worst scenario . 
  i do n't know how it would have unfolded had that scenario come through , but we had 200,000 people in downtown auckland on final night . 
  it was fucking insanity . 
  oh sorry , thought you were meaning mackenzie would be backup to cruden 's all black spot . 
  you 're obviously talking about the chiefs though . 
  true , but it does n't take a whole heap of imagination to go wide rather than repeatedly ramming the forwards into a defence which is n't folding . 
  yeah probably . 
  i 'm not knowledgeable on front row mechanics in the scrum , and neither of them do anything special outside the scrum . 
  actually , crockett throws penalties away faster than referees can follow , so fuck him . 
  coles is our only front rower who does anything extra . 
  so maybe below super rugby , but above currie cup/itm cup . 
  still an ok price , considering some itm unions charge that for their top tickets . 
  but we can also get tickets to most itm games for $ 20 which is about 10 pound, 
  it 's not bullying to tell a bully that they 're being an asshole , it 's common fucking decency . 
  if i tell someone who 's being racist that they 're being a dick , and to shut the fuck up , i 'm not harassing them , i 'm doing them a favour by giving them an opportunity for self improvement . 
  at the very least , i 'm stopping them from becoming a cringe-worthy embarrassment , as harmon became today . 
  but let 's try another method . 
  how would you deal with bullying ? 
  there was a point where australia had 13 men on the field , and the welsh did n't get a single try out of it . 
  yes , your defense was good , but i was specifically asking about your offense , because defense does n't get you points . 
  i 'm interested in what mccaw will do next year . 
  he 's publicly said he does n't want to play in europe , and he 's not going to play for the crusaders again , but i wonder if he 'll maybe play club rugby/itm cup . 
  shit , maybe he 'll go full amateur and join north otago in the heartland championship . 
  promising !, 
  i 'd love to see richie in an amateur team , or even just lighting up the itm . 
  i 'd argue that crossing the line and getting held up is a symptom of forward play , not backs . 
  i did n't think your backs were all that bad , just not utilised . 
  in one of the earlier games this year he struggled to run the game . 
  he was n't composed as he is with the hurricanes , or when he 's come on as a replacement . 
  i think at the moment he 's better suited as an impact player like sbw . 
  i 'd still pick carter , cruden , and sopoaga ahead of him . 
  not to say i do n't like him of course , the guy is magical when he comes on , and it 's always exciting, 
  ha , keep wishing sorry . 
  richie 's said he does n't want to play his rugby anywhere other than nz . 
  it 's why he never played for a european club over summer despite being given the option . 
  no , no , no , no , no , no , no . 
  stop it . 
  stop all of it . 
  right now . 
  i do n't even know where to begin correcting you . 
  fish in a barrel . 
  telling someone that they are being mean to someone else , or acting like a dickhead , or hurting someone 's feelings ** is not being a prick . 
  what the fuck . 
  if someone close to dan was to say `` hey dan , you 're hurting this guy 's feelings , stop it ay . 
  this is n't a good thing you 're doing '' , that person is not being a prick . 
  they 're alerting dan to the possibility that he is causing harm . 
  where the fuck did you pick up this misguided notion that you should just shut the fuck up when something wrong is occurring ? 
  do you see a robbery occurring and just walk away quietly ? 
  people often fail to realise the full effects of their behaviour until someone tells them . 
  secondly , this * is * real bullying . 
  i 'm sorry if you got bullied . 
  it sucks . 
  i got bullied .
