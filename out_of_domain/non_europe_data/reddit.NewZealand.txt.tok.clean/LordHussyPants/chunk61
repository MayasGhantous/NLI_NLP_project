  everyone gets bullied at some point . 
  maybe yours was very serious , but would n't it have been good if someone had said to your bully , `` hey , stop being a dick . '', 
  the shift to social media from real life encounters make it no less real . 
  stop trying to defend a man who has no remorse for a horrid course of events . 
  ** lastly , racism is not subjective . 
  go fuck yourself . 
  also happened during the rwc 2011 final , when ted told mccaw to kick deep for territory . 
  mccaw ignored him and defended in the midfield with his forwards . 
  i actually wondered if that was the coach pushing too hard in training . 
  i mean that 's pretty much what i mean . 
  player welfare first . 
  although i 'm inclined to think gatland knows what he 's doing and did n't work them to the point where they broke . 
  most likely red card candidates :, 
  * the south african team, 
  * the argentinian front row, 
  * hooper, 
  `` the rich years '', 
  christian cullen , jonah lomu , and jeff wilson . 
  one of the most talented all black backlines ever . 
  none won world cups with the all blacks . 
  lomu did win a super rugby championship twice with the blues . 
  cullen and wilson played for the hurricanes and the highlanders respectively . 
  neither franchise won a title . 
  * brad thorn is arguably the least successful though . 
  i mean , what did that guy ever do . 
  just 1 or 2 ay , 
  australians are far more open about their racism . 
  kiwis tend to hide it and take more subtle forms . 
  [ one of the articles ] ( http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=11479511 ) after lima sopoaga 's abs debut asked if sopoaga had finally proven the old myth wrong : that maori and pacific island players ca n't be good first fives . 
  but good on fitzy for calling it out . 
  the treatment adam goodes has had to deal with has been fucking awful . 
  the fa might actually want to consider that until they can win a world cup this century . 
  * argentina into the rugby championship, 
  * japan and argentina into super rugby, 
  * quite a bit of money into pacific unions, 
  * indirectly , help a lot of pacific players because many of them come through new zealand 's rugby system ( because they live here , not because we poach them ) . 
  cheers mate . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but i think reason , and by extension spiro , have fucked up here . 
  the home nations teams did n't lose 7/7 , they lost 6/6 . 
  omg , maybe they 'll recall warburton to start a tradition . 
  does n't matter if it 's commercial or not , it will help japan . 
  really , it 's a different sport though , is n't it ? 
  japan was one referee call away from making it through ahead of scotland , so it nearly happened . 
  argentina and south africa ca n't put up trophies they do n't have , 
  and they ca n't compete for the bledisloe, 
  good article . 
  [ here 's the ' 30cm off the ground head high tackle ' cheika refers to . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--onrc0godc ), 
  i thought it was justified , but then , i am a highlanders fan . 
  but it 's horizontal integration . 
  basic economics . 
  online content is being offered that will eventually kill the isp marketshare , and not only that - it 's been taken up by competitors too . 
  at this point , they 're just ignoring a deal that could be a foundation for future deals once cable is dropping . 
  touche, 
  well that 's settled !, 
  habana looks like a shit defender from this haha . 
  [ the after party .

  [ no they were n't . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyunion/comments/3p98jp/nice_refresher_on_joubert_2011_rwc_performance/cw48vwk ), 
  never know , we might have a few superstars emerge from the youth ranks in 2017 and replace these guys before the next world cup . 
  dunno what people mean by `` he was n't even looking . '', 
  looked to me like kaino saw it and had a brainfart . 
  also , habana still rushing the line after 100 tests and leaving his wing open ? 
  jeez . 
  was that the cleanest droppie you ever saw ? 
  he had the saffa line right up on him , not a second of hesitation or even preparation . 
  that was beautiful . 
  he has a reputation for being shit , and the kaino yellow was debatable as to the intention , so people are taking issue with it . 
  how brilliant was matfield congratulating carter ? 
  viktor had is final in ' 07 , now he gets to see carter finally get one . 
  good shit . 
  carter went out in the pool games in ' 11 , qf ( obv ) in ' 07 , and was backup 10 to carlos spencer in ' 03 . 
  * hey !, 
  with 10 to go , i 'd thought ` what happens if we lose ? 
  i get a lot of time to do the work i need to this week , but that 's about it . ', 
  most calm i 've ever been through a final 10min of an all blacks game . 
  waltzing matilda, 
  fields of athenry, 
  swing low, 
  flower of scotland, 
  slice of heaven which does n't really count because it only gets sung with the intercom playing it after a try, 
  do n't care . 
  both have positives . 
  * argentina - have never won , let alone made the final . 
  would be great to see them there . 
  * australia - the ultimate rivalry . 
  fuck me , that 's the most clickbait rugby headline i 've ever read . 
  sounds like he 's already been executed . 
  nah , watch the spider-cam view in full screen . 
  it pretty clearly goes marginally backwards , and that 's why kaino is reaching back - he overran it .

  you mean it would have been 19 - ~ ~ 10 ~ ~ 12 ... ? 
  nz only had one penalty , south africa had 5 . 
  other scores remain the same . 
  they need to have a fighting chance !, 
  my bad , i was looking at the rwc website and it has a 5 for pollard , but no number for lambie . 
  bit confusing . 
  lads , mccaw is god , and god is omnipresent . 
  mccaw does not need to enter through the gate , as his omniprescence ensures he is always the tackler .
