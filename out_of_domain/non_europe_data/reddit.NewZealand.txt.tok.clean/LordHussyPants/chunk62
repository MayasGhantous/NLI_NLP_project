  his only job is to release , and get to his feet , which is done , as he is all things at once , including supporting his own weight . 
  yeah i 'd want a strong team to face the boks next week too , 
  i wo n't be staying up for this , but i wish to give my wholehearted best wishes to los pumas . 
  wreak havoc lads . 
  saffas have that colonial spirit where they 'll accept any white guy from the southern half of africa into their team . 
   of course south africa would dominate japan i thought . 
  i will just watch until the score blows out and go to bed . 
  i had a piddly bet on the boks to win 80 + or something . 
  this was my exact train of thought . 
  i 've never been so happy to lose a bet . 
  holy fuck , 36-3 . 
  waikato ca n't even thrash provincial teams like that these days . 
  there are woman reffing local club matches here . 
  a few months back i went to one and she was bantering with the forwards while they set up scrums . 
  they all seemed to accept her and respect her . 
  craig joubert . 
   they 'll take us * back * to number 1, 
  minor quibble lads , i do n't know how you go back to something you never had , 
  how did this get negged it 's hilarious, 
  there 's no irony when you 're referring to a city within your own country . 
  this has been cropping up in the news a lot lately , and it 's really sad . 
  a few rugby fans down there seem to be tainting the reputation of everyone else . 
  context . 
  new zealand teams toured south africa with maori players who were ` honourary whites ' . 
  for the black south africans , during apartheid , those maori players were the only non-white players they ever saw . 
  they were the only people remotely similar to them playing a sport that was huge in the country . 
  captain *, 
  this is n't football , we do n't have managers . 
  gee , i wonder why . 
  but ... that 's stupid . 
  why would you add another person to the infrastructure ? 
  the coach could easily make that decision . 
  or the captain . 
  there are n't going to be breaks of play to pore over footage - it happens and you challenge immediately , or you let it go . 
  edit : pedantry ? 
  rugby superiority ? 
  fuck off mate , you were suggesting something football related . 
  do n't try hide it . 
  fuck that 's beautiful,

  our stadiums vary in size . 
  north harbour is 25,000 people , and hosts one or two blues games a year . 
  i 've seen it sell out for one of those once - the chiefs came up during their last winning year and i walked over to the stadium from a mate 's place to buy a $ 20 ticket and they were turning people away . 
  during the itm cup ( below super rugby ) , they usually only open one stand , and they might get 4-5 ,000 people . 
  * saturation . 
  so much rugby . 
  * usually no all blacks in provincial games . 
  * i 've personally found super rugby boring some years , fun other years . 
  it has ups and downs . 
  * would rather spend my money on something else if i 'm not watching the highlanders ( i live in auckland , so that 's rare ) , or the all blacks . 
  ** scrum : ** australia if they have sio . 
  nz if aussie do n't have sio . 
  ledesma has transformed that machine , and it is fantastic . 
  ** breakdown : ** nz . 
  i say this because we have so many players who go into the rucks and regularly turnover good ball , whereas australia really only has pocock . 
  now , pocock is fantastic , but he 's only one man ( unfortunately his ability to seemingly clone himself at the ruck does n't count for numbers ) . 
  hey australia , it 's nice to finally meet you in a rugby final, 
  even if you had to get help from a south african or two along the way, 
  fair call . 
  if it helps , a kiwi radio station decided today that all loose forward trios should henceforth be known as the sharters . 
  they came to this after wondering why fardy was left out of the pooper nickname , then deciding that fardy pooper was a good name for the three . 
  you can guess the rest . 
  either that or a huge super rugby game involving the chiefs . 
  waikato supporters will drive the hour north for a good match . 
  bad news buddy . 
  australia held it in 2008 after defeating the springboks , but lost it to new zealand three weeks later at eden park ( 39-10 ) . 
  nz did n't lose again in the tri nations that year , and lost it to france in dunedin in 2009 ( score 27-22 ) before winning it back a week later in wellington ( 14-10 ) . 
  they lost it to south africa in the 2009 tri nations , who lost it to australia 5 games later , who lost it to new zealand 2 games later . 
  new zealand lost it to the barbarians club in december 2009 , playing at twickenham . 
  fuck knows who the baabaas have played since , i 'll let you look it up !, 
  edit : [ they lost it to england the following may !, 
  i have work to do , so i really need to stop tracking this , damn you !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barbarian_f.c.#matches_against_international_sides ), 
  edit2 : nz maori are the champions . 
  read comments in this thread to follow the trail . 
  edit3 : nz maori lost to the nz barbarians this year , but the game does n't appear on nz maori 's wiki page b/c it 's just a regional baabaas team rather than the proper one in london . 
  i 've decided not to count this . 
  it was only one error , but i do n't think it takes anything away from the method which is hell interesting on it 's own !, 
  i 've just finished the trail though . 
  england beat the baabaas in may 2010 , before losing to australia in the 2010 june internationals . 
  australia then lost to england the following week , and england lost to new zealand maori * 4 days later * with what i suspect would be a b team . 
  no matter , short turn arounds affect everyone eventually !, 
  new zealand maori have won all six of their games since against canada ( x2 ) , america , japan ( x2 ) , and fiji , and so are the un-official world champions . 
  it 's be pretty disorienting though , to get hit while wearing a helment . 
  the weight of those things would knock your head back and forth quite a bit . 
  makes a lot of sense to us in colonies . 
  i 'm european new zealander , and i can tell you exactly where all my ancestors came from , and where . 
  i would say my strongest european heritage is my irish heritage , because it 's the most recent connection , my mother returned there as a child , and i was raised in a household that discussed it . 
  then there 's also the saint patrick 's day side of it , where irish culture is put front and centre , which i suspect makes it easier for a lot of people to connect to . 
  finally , the number of people who have migrated from ireland since 1700 is higher than the total population of ireland has ever been . 
  the irish diaspora is one of the most prominent european diasporas , and many irish communities are nothing like the ireland they left , but carried traditions with them which have evolved . 
  they are also linked through communal memories - memory of events which they never experienced , never saw , and were generations separated from , but still identify as being relevant to their identity . 
  the potato famine would be one of these , the easter rising another . 
  the phenomenon of community memory would apply to other ethnic groups too , but the irish are one of the best examples . 
  sorry for a long essayish post !, 
  in some cases , slaves who were freed had grown up or even been born into slavery , and had no concept of an experience outside of it . 
  these slaves were now faced with the task of finding food , shelter , and work , on their own . 
  it was a completely foreign concept because they had been owned before , and it was all provided , albeit at a heavy price . 
  note that this only applies to * some * slaves . 
  as in any group of people , there were entrepreneurial types , as well as slaves who had had some greater experience of the wider world .
