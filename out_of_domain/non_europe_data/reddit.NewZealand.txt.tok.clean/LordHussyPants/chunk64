  no one expects kiwi droppies , and carter was 40m out and not set up for one . 
  not to mention the ball came the wrong way for a leftie . 
  tackled ~ ~ beale i think ~ ~ it was folau ! , but it was more of a sliding into his legs and mashing his face across beale 's thigh haha . 
  awesome work . 
  that 's what i thought !, 
  but the news said it was folau !, 
  so based on this , it 's plausible that wales , england , and scotland could be seeded into one pool together if it was done tomorrow . 
  would anyone object to that like they did to australia/england/wales ? 
  or is scotland not worthy of recognition as a threat ? 
  that 's how it was last time , yeah . 
  but they 're changing it this time . 
  no , the point is that there are 9 teams to be divided among 4 pools , so there will always be a group of three good teams . 
  the world cup could be put into pools three weeks before the tournament , and england could be 9th because of an unlucky loss , and people would still complain that they were unfairly put in with australia and france or similar . 
  there 'll be problems with it being done closer to the tournament too . 
  there 's no way around it without making it uncompetitive . 
  but they 're * our * secrets . 
  our * precious * secrets . 
  i do n't deal in european history , but i 'll answer anyway because i think this is a problem that affects all historians . 
  short answer is no . 
  here 's why :, 
  as / u/sunagainstgold said , people can only question what they know , and this limits questions . 
  sure , some people put together different things they know and end up asking about the banking practices of nomad tribes in the sahara , or the development of fish fingers by the mayans . 
  but generally , people stick to expanding their knowledge on something they recognise because it 's a familiar and easy starting point . 
  i 've done so on this sub by answering questions outside my area , but which i have some knowledge of to use as a jumping off point . 
  now when someone comes in and asks a question about hitler , they 're starting off with a fact they know : adolf hitler was the leader of nazi germany during the second world war , and is widely regarded to have been an evil man . 
  recent questions submitted with hitler in the title jump off from this fact :, 
  * [ were there people who were ideologically and or violently opposed to the nazis rise to power that eventually became fervent supporters either through opportunism , matter of survival , pressure to conform or out of admiration for hitler creating a powerful germany ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3r4o6k/were_there_people_who_were_ideologically_and_or/?ref=search_posts ), 
  * [ was hitler actually drugged up ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3r1s9o/was_hitler_actually_drugged_up/?ref=search_posts ), 
  * [ did hitler receive any posthumous awards ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3quweg/did_hitler_receive_any_posthumous_awards/?ref=search_posts ), 
  * [ how did german americans react to the rise of hitler and the nazis ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3qu8ql/how_did_german_americans_react_to_the_rise_of/?ref=search_posts ), 
  * [ how was hitler 's power given to him by the german politicians ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3qsr24/how_was_hitlers_power_given_to_him_by_the_german/?ref=search_posts ), 
  these questions all relate to that core fact : question 1 and 5 deal with perceptions of people amongst the german population . 
  question 3 & 4 do this too , but with a different spin on the questions : one looks at later perceptions ; the other at the german migrant community in the united states . 
  question 2 tries ( somewhat ) to explain hitler 's behaviour in a different way . 
  these questions reflect to us what popular views of history are . 
  in these examples , we see that hitler was a bad person , and people are trying to figure out why he was elected , were people swayed by him , and whether he was recognised for his actions even though they were bad . 
  this occurs in all histories . 
  i do racial histories , usually in north america looking at the civil rights movement . 
  historians refer to a ` long crm ' , stretching from the first days of freedom for the slaves in the nineteenth century , through to the black panthers and black power , and even continuing on to the present day with protests over african american deaths at the hands of police . 
  but while the crm is n't as common a topic as nazi germany , there is a constant narrative about the history that is adhered to and it usually involves malcolm x , martin luther king , * brown v. board * , and rosa parks . 
  they 're the buzzwords for that period . 
  irish history has the easter rising and the famine , slavery has indentured slaves , east asian history has the mongols . 
  they 're the popular images of history . 
  now , the reason i do n't mind these aspects of topics , and even * like * them appearing , is that they give us the opportunity to counter popular history with a slightly more accurate picture , or expand upon it with some wider knowledge . 
  whenever the crm comes up , i make sure to plug the ` long crm ' , ( like above ! ), 
  in the hopes people will retain that and think about the fact that african americans were resisting white supremacy long before the fifties and sixties . 
  likewise , questions about hitler can lead to discussing histories of the german american community and their persecution , about the dynamics of nazi germany politics - not all people were nazis , and not all germans were bad like their leader . 
  so repetitive questions are good because they show an interest , and we can seize on that interest to explain a bit more . 
  they also mean we can challenge a dominant narrative , which may be tiresome because it exists . 
  but answering a question on it is good because you 're showing someone something they did n't know , while at the same time showing them that maybe not all history can be believed at what you 're told first . 
  broadly speaking it 's looking at histories involving race relations . 
  so stuff like the civil rights movement , the different nationalist movements ( red power , brown power , black power ) , japanese americans during wwii . 
  i 'm actually going to get it changed though , because i 've focused a lot more on the crm than anything else in that category . 
  no , no , no , it 's never lupus . 
  i think you 're going to be a bit more specific than this . 
  are you asking about the historiography ( how the history of the revolution has been written ) ? 
  or are you asking about the actual history ? 
  regardless of which , you may also have to provide a specific aspect of that because it 's a large topic . 
  yeah but maybe not all at once ay . 
  then they 'd just be a different majority . 
  in the interests of preventing confusion , would it be ex-king edward or something ? 
  he had abdicated 3 years before the onset of war , and was not the current regent . 
  that would be the appropriate title , but i mean a less formal term to show that he was the king previously , but not at the time when he developed these ties to the nazis . 
  your friend of a friend is an idiot . 
  if you want to keep the current flag , you want to make the second referendum the most one-sided vote possible . 
  burning a ballot paper does n't do that . 
  if you do n't want change , you vote for the ugliest option now , so that the worst one pops up against the current . 
  if you want one flag from the five , you vote for that , then the ugliest ones . 
  it 's stv , so every ranking vote counts . 
  i ca n't see any evidence to suggest that 4 year terms are the most common . 
  briefly scanning down the list on [ this wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/term_of_office ) and picking out random countries to check , 5 year terms seem to be the most common number . 
  america is the most obvious four year term nation , and is accompanied by israel , but mexico has six year terms ( limited to one term per person ) , as does russia ( 2 term limit ) . 
  the most interesting examples however , are the commonwealth nations . 
  with the queen still serving as the head of state , the terms of their prime ministers are `` at her majesty 's pleasure '' , and the pms serve indefinitely , until parliament is dissolved for new elections of representatives . 
  this is why new zealand generally has 3 year ` terms ' , the uk has 5 years , australia has 6 months ( i kid , i kid ) , and canada has four years . 
  but they are n't ` terms ' in the same sense as the presidency in america , because they are dependent on elections being called for the respective houses of representatives , which varies greatly . 
  the united kingdom has had several elections that were only four years apart , while having others that were five . 
  so the answer to your question is that it is dependent on the political system of the country . 
  whereas commonwealth nations have the queen as the head of state , others like russia , america , and israel , have presidents . 
  commonwealth nations ca n't all have the queen present , and use prime ministers to counter the undemocratic notion of a hereditary ruler controlling government . 
  these pms * usually * come from the parliament , as the leaders of one of the political parties . 
  in the united states , this differs as the president is not a sitting member of the congress . 
  the president is elected in his own right , whereas in the commonwealth countries , the pm is elected only if his party wins an election . 
  so right now , the us house of representatives is led by republicans , and in new zealand or australia , this would make kevin mccarthy prime minister as the leader of that party . 
  others have explained how the naacp had a far broader approach than just education , but no one has explained why education itself was seen as so important . 
  education was a benefit which had been denied to african americans across the south since the civil war . 
  white populations preferred to have uneducated african americans who would do their work . 
  voting , a supposedly equal right , required tests to be passed to register . 
  uneducated people had a hard time passing a test where they had to read something like the constitution with no training in literacy . 
  things that we see as basic life skills , like reading a cheque , or filling out forms , and managing finances , were harder for those who were never educated and made them prime targets to be taken advantage of . 
  the fact that they were black merely made it a certainty that there would be no repercussions . 
  education helped african americans with financial autonomy , political expression , and even intangibles , like confidence and self-belief . 
  think about how proud a child is to write their name , or an adult is when they have perfected a new skill . 
  education also fed into an older narrative of community autonomy . 
  schools were spaces where the next generation was learning about the world .
