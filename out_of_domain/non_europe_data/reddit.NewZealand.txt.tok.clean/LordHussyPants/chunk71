  everyone 's real friendly with opposing team 's fans , and the teams , unless someone 's being an arsehole . 
  there 's always great banter , and problems only start very rarely . 
  kyle lockwood had a wank onto a piece of paper 10 years ago and submitted it to the committee last year . 
  otis and dick frizzell are artists and freely gave their time to design the flag options they provided ( 20 or 30 i think ) . 
  pretty sure that ( 1 ) creative people would volunteer to be a part of the process because then they could see it done properly , and ( 2 ) that even if it did cost $ 260m ( it would n't ) , you should do it right or not at all , so the cost would n't matter . 
  that looks pretty spot on then , it just has n't been coloured ? 
  probably got 2-3 more sittings to do .

  how about this haha,

  it 's the mildew man !, 
  one of my friends was on a night roadtrip , and he 'd fallen asleep in the backseat of the car my other friend was driving . 
  they were going through a rural area of highway where the four lane road was broken into two two lane roads over some hills - one of the roads was lower than the other , and you could n't see any barriers or streetlights to mark out the upper road from it . 
  well my sleeping friend wakes up , still groggy from sleep , and he looks out the front window to see that the car is rocketing along a straight section of road , with a corner coming up , but the car is on the wrong side of the road . 
  he freaks out and starts calling out the driver 's name , thinking that he 's fallen asleep too . 
  turns out the driver was overtaking a slower car and was talking to the front seat passenger the whole time , but the act of waking up was so slow for my drowsy mate that he did n't register the other car 's lights , or the music or conversation in the front . 
  full on panic thinking he was about to die . 
  probably ` penis ' shortened to three letters to match lbj . 
  reasoning i woud guess is that lbj was famous for whipping out his meat monster to show people . 
  famous might not be the right word ... notorious ? 
  anyway , [ here is a til about it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/17ew69/til_president_johnson_would_regularly_expose/ ) which links to a review of a book that talks about it . 
  i read about it in a biography of the president a few years back while researching some stuff on him and jfk , so i do n't have the book to hand now . 
  but that does constitute two sources . 
  if you want more , i 'd head to / r/askhistorians - one of the american guys might be able to help . 
  he was also a generally intimidating man , and the dick thing might have had something to do with it . 
  he used to lean over people while talking to them , which meant they either had to retreat or stare vertically .

  i would say that the biggest influence ancestral/ethnic heritage played in wwii was in the case of the 442nd regiment - sometimes referred to as the japanese american regiment , or the nisei regiment . 
  the attack at pearl harbour led to the internment of japanese-americans all over the west coast of america , in areas deemed important to military security . 
  in hawaii however , americans of japanese background were vital to the economy , quite simply because there were so many of them there . 
  removing them would create a vacuum . 
  japanese-americans were mistrusted in ways that german and italian americans never were . 
  they initially were n't allowed to serve in the american forces , despite the fact that many of them were * nisei * , or children of immigrants . 
  in other words , these were people with japanese ancestry who had never seen japan , were old enough to fight ( so had 2 + decades in america ) , but were n't trusted . 
  in 1943 , the ruling was reversed , and the 442nd was formed with volunteers from hawaii and the west coast . 
  the resultant regiment was something like 99 % japanese american , and went on to become one of the most decorated military units in american history . 
  * however * , the 442nd never served in the pacific theatre !, 
  they were only deployed in europe , where there was no chance of running into the imperial japanese forces . 
  on the other hand , german and italian americans served wherever possible , with no fear that they would suddenly turn on the americans . 
  miscellaneous :, 
  [ daniel inouye ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daniel_inouye ) , one of the longest serving senators in american history , and an undefeated politician for half a century served in the 442nd . 
  [ dr seuss drew racist comics ] ( http://www.edb.utexas.edu/faculty/salinas/students/student_sites/fall2008/1/images/cartoondrseuss2.jpg ) that played on fears of japanese espionage by the japanese-american community .

  if you get rid of these eleven words , you do n't look like a massive arsehole . 
  difference is , some words have more power than others . 
  there is no right place or time to use the n word if you 're not black , and if you are black , it 's still a sketchy word to use , because it 's got such an entrenched history that it can never be separate from . 
  i 've never seen such a simple to understand explanation of why things burn up at high speed in the atmosphere . 
  thanks for this !, 
  from the [ online etymology dictionary ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bullshit&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 ) :, 
   `` eloquent and insincere rhetoric , '' 1915 , american english slang, 
  the suggestion is that the slang term is a combination of the swearword shit with the word bull , both in reference to the animal , but also to an [ older meaning dating from the 15th century  ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bull&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 ), 
   ** bull ( n. 3 ) ** `` false talk , fraud , '' middle english , apparently from old french * bole * `` deception , trick , scheming , intrigue , '' and perhaps connected to modern icelandic * bull * `` nonsense . '', 
   sais christ to ypocrites ... yee ar ... all ful with wickednes , tresun and bull . 
  [ `` cursor mundi , '' early 14c . ], 
   there also was a verb * bull * meaning `` to mock , cheat , '' which dates from 1530s . 
  if that 's the case , it could be that it was made up as a handy combination of a swearword + a pre-existing term that also worked as a handy animal pun ( which we all know people love ! ), 
  the oxford dictionary has the same definition of bull dating to the 17th century , origin unknown . 
  the oed also gives the same origins for bullshit - that meaning combined with the word shit . 
  also , note that one of the standard definitions of shit is as an adjective referring to something as ` nonsense ' or ` worthless ' - that would make it a good combination word with bull for the purposes we 're looking at , as opposed to calling something a bullfuck ( or a fuckbull ? ) . 
  the swear word was taboo , but it also had a meaning that was analogous to the word it was being attached to . 
  i 'm just getting this stuff from the online etymology dictionary - it 's free to use and really nicely laid out . 
   ** baloney ( n. ) ** 1894 , variant of ** bologna ** sausage ( q.v. ) . 
  as slang for `` nonsense , '' 1922 , american english ( popularized 1930s by n.y. gov. 
  alfred e. smith ; in this sense sometimes said to have been one of the coinages of legendary `` variety '' staffer jack conway ) , from earlier sense of `` idiot '' ( by 1915 ) , perhaps influenced by * blarney * , but usually regarded as being from the sausage , as a type traditionally made from odds and ends . 
  it also was ring slang early 20c . 
  for an inferior fighter . 
  * blarney * is an irish term , relating to the practice of kissing the blarney stone which used to be a bit of a difficult thing to achieve . 
  people said they 'd done it , but had n't , which led to `` blarney '' becoming a phrase for tall tales . 
  because it 's an irish word , and bologna is an italian one , i do n't think the two would have influenced each other in how they were used in america . 
  the dictionary suggestion above that it came from the way sausages are made , `` from odds and ends '' seems more likely - like a fast talker cobbling together bits for a tale . 
  funnily enough , i was going to drop horseshit in as an example of a word made up from two independent words that retained an overall meaning . 
  unfortunately i could n't find anything suggesting that `` horse '' was a word referencing a lie or a tall tale . 
  i 'd hazard a guess and speculate that horse was just used in different areas because they might have been more common animals in that region . 
  as i said , i welcome the advice , but can you give reasons for the parts you suggested instead of mine ? 
  i play dota , but i want more out of a compute than that . 
  as i said , gta v is practically the benchmark , and that 's a mite more resource intensive than dota .
