   i 'd look at it like this : he dives on top of the brumbie who 's gone down on the loose ball , usually a penalty in itself . 
  no , he tripped because the brumbie slid across and under him . 
  not a penalty , and not a tackle . 
  it should n't have been a penalty at all . 
  no ruck was formed , no one was tackled , and no one had possession . 
  bulls player bats it backwards towards his team , so no knock on or anything wrong there . 
  also , bulls player was n't a tackler , i do n't know how you work that in there . 
  i have n't followed the chiefs as closely as i could have this season , but does anyone know why they were paying $ 1.40 to win while the highlanders are at $ 2.60 ? 
  the odds seemed incredibly exaggerated to me . 
  but that 's what the situation was last year too , which is why i was confused . 
  penalty and nothing more , but after the highlanders card in that game the other week , it should be a definite yellow , possible red . 
  no , but refs set a precedent already earlier in the season for another offence like this . 
  was it le roux with the sharks ? 
  i watched that , and it was nasty as hell , but i still do n't think it was intentional . 
  ngatai went down in a tackle motion , he was intending to tackle dixon . 
  dropping backwards and slide to protect yourself is quicker than what he did . 
  dixon 's jumping was stupid , and caused the problem once ngatai was already committed . 
  carding was silly , but precedent has been set already . 
  i 'd argue emery had nothing he could do . 
  he was running towards the ball , was too late to contest , but moving too quickly to stop . 
  unavoidable collision . 
  i think this was how we won last year . 
  not necessarily the best team , but the defence was great and we kept trudging on and eventually others fell away . 
   fuck this gay earth, 
  hey , fuck you , and fuck off . 
  `` hey ref , how about you tell this fuckwit to shut up ? '', 
  he 's 25 , why the hell would he think it was smart to kick someone in the head . 
  christ , he 's in the scrum with the bloke . 
  he could easily give him some shit in there or a ruck . 
  that backwards flick was * beautiful * . 
  pretty average ae, 
  ** why did n't the ref card the chiefs # 9 for a dangerous tackle on mckenzie !?!? 
  [ whoosh ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/xtitnzt5sqaarnki9i/giphy.gif ), 
  i really want the original video of this and to know if the lioness is ok . 
  no , because we exported all of them to countries where threes are revered . 
  but seriously , we 've lost so many kickers over the years because they had carter for kicks and the other guys were n't the # 1 selection in positions other than first five . 
  ca n't get game time in a national squad = leave for a high paying contract elsewhere . 
  mackenzie injured or cramping ? 
  everytime the chiefs pass it wide , they 're landing it too far in forward of their runners so they have to stretch to grab it . 
  it 's slowing down the runners too much , i hope they fix it . 
  i thought sopoaga was pretty quiet tbh . 
  mackenzie/mckenzie ( htf do you spell it ? ), 
  was solid as per usual , cruden was n't flashy either . 
  this is true , but it speaks more about your government services than the immigrants . 
  was this a concussion joke ? 
  ruthless . 
  `` any maori can get on to a council if their message is good enough . '', 
  this simply is n't true because maori are a minority , and as we just saw in that video , the majority in certain areas are deadset against maori having a say in anything . 
  ignorance of the treaty , its principles , and the goals of maori , leads to fear that all iwi are out to get our water , land , and run us into the sea . 
  they were saying he misrepresented himself - he did n't . 
  he started out by saying that at the beginning of his term he was guilty of racism through ignorance , and that he knew nothing about maori culture . 
  once he educated himself , he tried to make a change in line with his new knowledge . 
  he did n't misrepresent himself , he just changed as a person in his term . 
  that 's either a falsehood , or hosking is suggesting that people should resign when they have a change of mind about something and run again on their new platform . 
  we always knew mike was a dick , i 'd hoped for better out of toni street tbh . 
  the treaty promised equal governance , which is n't happening , and putting two maori wards would help somewhat if it was only to place a maori voice on the council . 
  dictates is probably the wrong word to use . 
   they were saying he misrepresented himself - he did n't . 
  that 's a falsehood . 
  the man never misrepresented himself . 
  by the way , opinions and falsehoods are n't mutually exclusive . 
  i could have an opinion that maori are a lesser people than pakeha , but that would be a falsehood . 
  it would still be an opinion though . 
  opinions can be wrong . 
  they can be right . 
  saying `` just my opinion '' is n't some magic kevlar shield for your words . 
  refs favour you , it 's just negatively !, 
  actually viable , only a 60min commute . 
  how did these guys play a record season with shooting like this ? 
  it 's free !, 
  anyone can attach it !, 
  i was just saying that this seems like despairingly bad shooting from the regular season prems . 
  apparently it was the wrong thing to say . 
  this is brilliant alone , but i always felt that it was enhanced by the following lines :, 
  ** pippin ** what ? 
  gandalf ? 
  see what ? 
  ** gandalf ** white shores , and beyond , a far green country under a swift sunrise . 
  ** pippin ** well , that is n't so bad . 
  ** gandalf ** no . 
  no , it is n't . 
  it 's such a simple and satisfactory idea once they agree on that . 
  that 's hilarious . 
  it 's pretty good though , because if he uses a line two or three times across all those movies and shows , it 's just a touch of sorkin rather than recycling an entire premise for a work like some writers have a tendency to do . 
  jeffrey archer and john grisham are two authors whose work i 've read 90 % or more of . 
  they 're both good story tellers , but they also have a habit of recycling * too much * and it ruins the experience . 
  archer wrote a fantastic book years ago called kane and abel . 
  it was a life long story type thing , with heaps of detail and events . 
  he also wrote three diaries about his experience in prison , and a novel about a man who wrongfully goes to prison . 
  he wrote another little known book about two brothers separated at birth . 
  and lastly there were a few indepth novels about political races for seats in the english parliament . 
  his latest series , * the clifton chronicles * is at the moment five books long , and guess what ? 
  it 's a life long chronicle of two brothers separated at birth and one of them is falsely imprisoned while the other becomes a politician . 
  he has a very limited imagination , but a lot of experience to draw from . 
  not enough however , to fill out 20 odd books with original storylines . 
  so while they 're still entertaining , they 're excessively formulaic now that i 've read everything else . 
  grisham does the same thing . 
  patterson is actually quite different because he sketches plot outlines for his books and has other people write them . 
  it gives a tinge of originality which is nice . 
  yes .
