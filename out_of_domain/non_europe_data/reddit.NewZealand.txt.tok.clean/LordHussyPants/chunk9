  however , they did have slogans that came with the revolution - the colour red , and a worker with a hammer , among others . 
  red already had a history of being used in social democrat political circles , and in protests in the nineteenth century . 
  the worker with a hammer raised came from a group within the revolution . 
  it was used in banners post-revolution depicting a new world being built ( may day 1918 ) . 
  the sickle came in approximately a week later when the uniforms of the new soviet military were created . 
  i 'm not sure who designed it , but this is the first case i saw of it occurring . 
  originally a plow was used , representing the peasant class as the hammer represented the worker class . 
  according to an `` order of the military commissariat dated 8 may 1918 , '' all red army recruits were to receive the `` red army 's ` star of mars ' with a hammer and plow '' , which was to be attached to their military caps . 
  this lasted until may 1922 , when the plow was replaced by the sickle on military medals . 
  the origin of the paired symbols was dated by russian historians to 10th july 1918 , when it first appeared on official russian documentation out of the fifth congress of soviets . 
  later historians found this to be incorrect , noting that it appeared earlier in 1918 . 
  however , since july 1918 is the first official use that would make a more correct timing for its appearance as a communist symbol as it was representative of the soviet government . 
  so the summarised version :, 
  ** when ** : the hammer was a preexisting symbol of a social democratic group that got appropriated by the communist movement in the revolution , october 1917 . 
  the sickle was an evolution of the plow , appearing in may 1922 . 
  before that the plow had been used since may 1918 . 
  ** how ** : the hammer originated from said preexisting group , and was combined with the plow , most likely through government run competitions to design the emblems of the new nation . 
  ** why ** : the hammer was symbolic of the workers , and the sickle/plow of the peasant . 
  together these covered the proletariat which the new union claimed to represent and be the banner for . 
  all credit for this post goes to n. a. soboleva who wrote a brilliant article on russian symbols in the twentieth century . 
  i 'm not sure if the article would be publicly available anywhere , but it is available through ebsco databases .

  yeah that 's why i did n't put any of it in my original post . 
  everyone has a different idea of what they could do , it 's not good for facts , and i was only able to find one or two references to actual medieval sources - those were the ones i chucked in the first post . 
  glad you found it useful !, 
  prison hulks came into use in 1776 by an act of parliament in england . 
  the reason ? 
  the american revolution . 
  prior to 1776 , britain had used the american colonies as a convenient dumping ground for their undesirable prisoners . 
  it was , in effect , an early australia . 
  however , with the rebellion against the crown and its subsequent development into full fledged independence , england was no longer able to send convicts to those colonies . 
  the result was a rapidly growing prison population that far outstripped the available resources for housing it . 
  the solution was to use decommissioned ships to house those prisoners . 
  the ships were made completely unworthy for sea duty - the only boat-like qualities they retained were their ability to float . 
  they were often tied up in harbours , and because of their lack of seaworthiness , they were rarely moved . 
  in hong kong , a boat ferrying prisoners to a hulk overturned , and all the prisoners drowned when the chain they were linked to pulled them under . 
  the hulk was moved closer to shore so that the transport would be safer , and a hundred prisoners took the opportunity to escape . 
  because of their unique nature of being boats that were n't really boats , this severely limited their practicality . 
  you could n't , for example , stick a hundred prisoners on a prison hulk in the middle of the north sea , because it would n't be able to cope with the weather . 
  so the limitations meant that these hulks were n't as good a system as they sound . 
  the hulks were phased out of common * use in the mid nineteenth century . 
  by this time australia was opposing transport of convicts like america had , although with less revolution . 
  england recognised the need for a comprehensive prison system at home , as transporting would no longer be possible . 
  thus the prison hulks , which were always meant to be temporary ( as evidenced by the acts which enabled them being two year measures ) , were shut down and the prisoners relocated to the land . 
  another reason is that the nineteenth century was a century of more enlightened thinking - the idea of childhood being an important stage of development was emerging , and authorities started to look towards reforming prisoners rather than writing them off completely . 
  this was important , as one observer noted , `` every evil that can be supposed to arise from the unchecked association of men of foul lives and unrestrained passions '' did in fact arise aboard the hulks . 
  the hulks could be used for youngsters - those who would be considered teenagers or preteens by todays standards . 
  the new thinking surrounding childhood development and the importance of the child in the future of the nation , combined with the knowledge of violence and complete lack of discipline on the hulks could also have been a factor in a drive to remove them from service by politicians and socially minded citizens . 
  to round up , while all ( that i know of ) prison hulks have been decommissioned , there were still isolated examples . 
  in the san francisco gold rush , the town boomed so quickly that the cost of building made a prison unfeasible . 
  the solution was to use one of the many abandoned ships in san francisco bay to make a prison otu of . 
  the idea was extended to other buildings , including a hospital . 
  and after the end of prison hulks , there were still prison ships . 
  rikers island in nyc has a purpose built barge serving as a prison ward , and is the best example i know of . 
  the british also had a prison ship in the late 90s/early 00s , but all of this is within the 20 year gap so you 'll have to research that yourself .

  is that the macy 's fourth of july display in new york ? 
  is it thunder over louisville , for the opening of the kentucky derby festival ? 
  moomba festival fireworks in melbourne, 
  + correct, 
  guess i made it too obvious : <, 
  it depends on the songs themselves - some songs were popular at the time , while others probably only gained favour with audiences later . 
  ` fortunate son ' reached # 3 on the billboard charts in 1969 , so it was definitely popular with contemporary audiences . 
  it was also very obvious that the song was about the war , and more specifically , the draft and the way it unfairly targeted certain members of society . 
  crosby , stills , nash & young released ` ohio ' in 1970 in response to the kent state shootings where the ohio national guard killed four unarmed students , while attempting to shut down a protest against the vietnam war . 
  that song reached # 14 on billboard . 
  a lot of these songs were popular at the time because they emerged from the sixties counterculture that was also heavily grounded in the anti-war movement . 
  songs like ` fortunate son ' resonated with certain groups , like students , as they became more politically aware and recognised inconsistencies in american society . 
  the kent state protests , which inspired the song ` ohio ' , occurred in 1970 , while there were massive protests occurring back in 1968 at columbia university over the same issues - race and war . 
  the students at columbia protested against their university having association with a think tank related to arms manufacturers working with the dod . 
  as well as that , there were plans for a gymnasium to be built for the university , ~ ~ but it was to be built on land which was already occupied by low income housing ~ ~ but it was to be built on public land in harlem , and segregated entrances for public users ( mostly black ) and university users ( mostly white ) . 
  i bring in this extra detail to point out that what we think of as protest songs , and might see as being unpopular at the time , were actually a reflection of the mood of a large portion of the population in the years of the vietnam war . 
  edit : fixed kent state student sentence re : / u/tractorguy 's comment below . 
  op , i think tastes would have been similar , but with limitations . 
  the people at home were protesting a war , while those away were already stuck in it . 
  i 'm not sure how they 'd feel . 
  hopefully someone else can explore this . 
  edit 2 : i got my usage of land mixed up !, 
  as / u/silver _ kitty pointed out , the university had been buying buildings and evicting tenants too . 
  i 'd connected that with the gym first , when i believe it was a whole other issue . 
  1968 was a hell of a year . 
  stirling , scotland ? 
  cheers mate , that 's what i thought the case was . 
  yes there is substance . 
  a lot of it . 
  it all comes down to pop history , and the ` master narrative ' that is taught in schools , both within the us , and outside of it - because this is n't a localised issue . 
  the master narrative is a popular , watered down version of the civil rights movement , and it frames the crm as a set period of struggle , limiting understanding of the full scope of the struggle . 
  it 's also the story of the movement most of us grow up learning . 
  charles payne paraphrases the idea of the master narrative in * time longer than rope * , a collection of essays he edited on african american activism :,
