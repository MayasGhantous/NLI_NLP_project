  * on average , 2 women are murdered per week ( 104 per year ) in the uk in instances of domestic abuse . 
  30 men per year are murdered . 
  tl ; dr abuse against men matters . 
  but there 's more domestic abuse against women than there is against men . 
  women 's is publicised more because it is quite simply a bigger issue . 
  it 's not more important in any measure other than scale . 
  just like black lives matter which tries to bring attention to the number of black people murdered by cops . 
   even if you aim carefully for the chest you can still miss . 
  of course , but we 're talking about people whose job it is to carry guns . 
  they should n't be `` average shooters '' , they should be highly trained . 
  and we 're talking about a human life . 
  surely that 's enough of a reason to aim carefully for a better target than five or six vital organs . 
  i wholeheartedly agree with you . 
  i 'm pretty sure the conversation in this thread is about domestic abuse against men , not `` the secret feminist agenda and how it 's out to get us '' . 
  i was just pointing out that feminists do n't see men 's rights as competition . 
  agreed , although i 've never heard a feminist deny this . 
  honestly , i 'd just be surprised if he could hear a woman say something about how she 's been treated and not dismiss it as `` oh you 're overreacting , silly ! '', 
  thanks !, 
  i thought `` feminists are conspiring to cover up domestic abuse against men '' was a pretty classy response too . 
  like deserves like !, 
   ( 3 ) where did the western ideas of race and racism come from ? 
  how do we get from xenophobia and religious prejudice to `` biological '' racism ? 
  this is a really interesting one , and it 's amazing because biological racism has arguably led to the creation of stereotypes and the ` races ' we have today , yet it had its own stereotyped roots within the church which are a whole other story . 
  i honestly do n't know what you mean here , but i 'd like to understand because it sounds like something i 'd agree with . 
  [ according to the national violence against women survey that took place through the 90s , that 's simply not true though . 
  ] ( http://www.americanbar.org/groups/domestic_violence/resources/statistics.html ), 
  * 25 % of women and 8 % of men physically abused by partner . 
  * 20 % of all non-fatal crime against women was ipv ( intimate partner violence ) . 
  3 % of all non-fatal crime against men was ipv . 
  * from a survey in 2003 , 33 % of female murder victims were killed by a partner . 
  4 % of male murder victims were killed by a partner . 
  * 83 % of all spouse murderers were men . 
  75 % of all dating partner murderers were men . 
  * 1 million women stalked annually in the us .

  just like black lives matter which tries to bring attention to the number of black people murdered by cops . 
  given that at this point cops seem to just empty their weapon into a target 's chest cavity , i do n't think anyone will complain if they swap to firing a bullet at a leg and nicking a femoral . 
  then again , i 've never seen an american cop shoot someone and go and administer first aid either , so i guess it 's just a lost cause . 
  you said `` not all black kids sag their pants '' , as if his brother 's belief that it should be illegal is n't based in race . 
  my point is that stereotypes are n't applied fairly . 
  not all muslims are terrorists , yet they cop a fair bit of suspicion just because they fit the image . 
  even sikhs get accused of it , and that 's just because they wear a turban . 
  look at the evidence though . 
  the parent comment to this provided links to german police officers making non-lethal shots . 
  other countries have armed police who do n't kill people anywhere near as much as american police . 
  but they 're not all killing bystanders either . 
  obviously there is a risk to hit bystanders , but in that case i expect a police marksman would say `` risk is too great , aim for centre mass . '', 
  the overall goal should be preservation of life , and i do n't think americans do that . 
  from my point of view , they arrive , and they try to end a situation as soon as possible with the most lethal means possible . 
  there does n't seem to be any consideration of letting a perp live and convicting in many cases . 
  other police forces will analyse a situation and aim to defuse it . 
  tl ; dr african american goes way beyond whether you or your parents were born in africa . 
  historically it 's a way of rejecting racism while identifying a group . 
  identifying as african american was a little different to identifying as polish american when the term came into popular use in the sixties . 
  we all know how black people were referred to : the n-word , negro , coloured , and other words that were all used as derogatory and highly charged slurs . 
  calling themselves ` american ' did n't work , because they * were n't * on an equal footing with white americans . 
  african american served two purposes : it identified their community within america ; and by identifying with africa , it marked their blackness as something to be proud of , rather than something to be denigrated ( like those slurs did ) . 
  as for specifics of africa , black families who are descended off ex-slaves in the united states , their family history extends back maybe 200 years . 
  many of them have no knowledge of their family history before they were slaves . 
  all they know is that the family came from africa , usually the west coast , which is split up into many countries today . 
  there is n't the luxury of saying `` oh , we 're ivorian coast american '' like your family can do with your polish heritage . 
  that article is referring to cornwall , one area of the uk which is less than 1 % of the population . 
  that 's like saying that cantonese is the most spoken language in chinatown , so america is chinese . 
  of course i can see how it might have benefits . 
  but i do n't see how it helps your story at all , because you seem to be operating entirely on american norms , and ignoring what is normal elsewhere . 
  the `` great service '' you expect seems unreasonable to me . 
  from the waiter 's point of view , i just see someone who was constantly changing their mind , or who did n't have the foresight to tell me exactly what they wanted . 
  i especially do n't understand why you 'd expect a waiter to know you wanted extraordinary amounts of ice , when that 's not a thing in most places . 
  it 's not half arsing lethal force if you 're not trying to kill . 
  it works for other countries , why could n't it work for america ? 
  last week cops shot someone in nz , and the immediate aftermath of the shot being fired was 5-6 cops gathered around the guy giving first aid to try and keep him alive . 
  videos of american cops shooting people ? 
  they stand there and continue pointing guns . 
  it 's obviously a massive cultural difference which could be overcome to provide a safer experience for everyone .
