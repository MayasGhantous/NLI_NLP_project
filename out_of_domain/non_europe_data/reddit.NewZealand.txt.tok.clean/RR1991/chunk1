  any suggestions ? 
  that worked , thanks, 
  the link does n't work for me . 
  is it safe just to install over an ubuntu 13.10 installation ? 
  should i remove previous scripts used in this guide ? 
  are you stating that you have got everything working under 14.04 ? 
  would you consider writing a howto ? 
  this would help a great amount of c720 users who would love to have the full ubuntu experience on their chromebook . 
  ctrl + l should do the trick . 
  can ' t answer your second question . 
  this saves so much time with the installation !, 
  i must admit though , that i really value the unity and ubuntu desktop experience . 
  is it safe to install ubuntu-desktop after the bodhi installation , will it not mess up hibernation and sound settings , or keyboard shortcuts ? 
  i have an c720 , without touchscreen . 
  is the patch still usable , or will i have bloated drivers running ? 
  is creating the / usr/share/x11 / xorg.conf.d / 50-cros-touchpad . conf file necessary ? 
  i 've ran the cros-haswell-modules . sh and after a reboot the touchpad functions quite ok . what does creating this file do ? 
  so if it did not include the touchpad updates for c720 , is it worth updating to this kernel ? 
  what benefits are there ? 
  * edit : i have installed the kernel , and did you patch , works fine . 
  i actually think that the touchpad works better now than under the standard croshaswell script , can that be the case ? 
  secondly , now that this kernel is installed manually , can/should i lock the other kernel ( 3.13 ) ? 
  ubuntu is asking me to update , can i somehow lock and keep my current kernels , for example by ` package  lock version ' in synaptic ? 
  if so , which kernel packages should i lock ? 
  i 'm happy you wrote this out , i am experiencing the exact same since i 've installed ubuntu ( both 13.10 and 14.04 give me this bug ) . 
  i 've just installed kernel [ 3.16 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/chrubuntu/comments/2czgxn/linux_316_and_ubuntu_on_acer_c720/ ) , i hope there is an improvement , but i can not report on that yet . 
  instead of slow , i guess the c720 ( intel ) users are facing short freezes of the system every now and then . 
  does this mean full support for the entire hardware ? 
  fixing the touchpad , hibernation problems , assigned keyboard keys , microphone , etc ? 
  when can we expect this kernel to be released ? 
  for the c720 , besides the trackpad , what other functions work natively now that did n't work before ? 
  partially agree . 
  xubuntu ( xfce ) does n't feel as polished as unity or kde . 
  for a first-time user , i would definitely recommend unity or kde ( = ubuntu or kubuntu ) , to get the full polished desktop you 'll want to see at first boot . 
  if you do n't like it ( too resource heavy ) , or want to be able to tweak more , you could consider switching to a different desktop environment later . 
  unfortunately , i have to disagree with you . 
  there is still [ this ] ( http://redd.it/2d88dg ) issue that i am dealing with . 
  secondly , there are the shortkeys , microphone and suspend that need some attention after installation . 
  the touchpad driver seems to get corrupted every now and then ( fixed with suspend or reboot ) . 
  apart from the freezing issue , are these all issues the chrubuntu script takes care of ?!, 
  i always did fresh installs fiy . 
  [ no progress ] ( https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80229 ) it seems , so far :(, 
  * office : wps office ( sorry , not open source , but damn good chinese software , free for us to use , with a linux community ), 
  * media : vlc , spotify , popcorn time, 
  * graphics : inkscape , darktable , the gimp , blender, 
  * cloud service : copy, 
  this is pretty much what makes my desktop . 
  unity . 
  it works fast on my chromebook and the use of space on the small screen is perfect ( unlike gnome . . ) . 
  i will reconsider kde plasma 5 when it is more stable , the first kde that does n't look as incoherent . 
  unity just works and makes me efficient . 
  is it the dacia sandero ? 
  it 's most likely [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/chrubuntu/comments/2d88dg/freezing_on_c720_ideas/ ) issue . 
  i have the same problem , and many others with us . 
  there does n't seem to be a solution for now . 
  priority changed to ` high ' as for yesterday . 
  if this gets solved , my c720 will be a perfect functioning machine . 
  i sincerely hope that you are just very unfortunate . 
  if not , a lot of us are doomed . 
  in that case ... 
  i would like to have a full backup of my system ( ubuntu istall , users , preferences and installed software ) . 
  how do i do that ?!, 
  i have a nice big external hdd . 
  which software will do the trick to backup , and be able to restore on an other drive in case of emergency ? 
  i once read that ` trim ' is enabled by default on 14.04 , but i 'm really not sure whether this is the case . 
  perhaps ubuntu should be tweaked to work effectively with the ssd to not wear it out too fast ? 
  this guy is gold . 
  it took me so long to find all the right fixes , since there are so many bad versions of fixes out there . . 
  anyway , 128gb ssd , direct boot to seabios through [ this ] ( http://blogs.fsfe.org/the_unconventional/2014/04/20/c720-debian/ ) awesome guide , distroshare ubuntu 14.04 version and some [ ssd tweaks ] ( https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/ssd ) ( trim etc. 
  ) , set up some final shortkeys and the c720 is a lightning fast super netbook .
