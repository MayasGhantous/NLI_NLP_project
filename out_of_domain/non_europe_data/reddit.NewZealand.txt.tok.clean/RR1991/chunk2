  what is ` amazing ' about the new kernel ? 
  the c720 certainly is extra challenging if you are new to linux . 
  if you dare to ditch your warranty and wipe chromeos , it is surprisingly easy to turn this chromebook into a normal x86 netbook . 
  fully functioning , fast and stable running with e.g. 
  unless you are really using the ram to it 's max , i do n't see why you would prefer xubuntu over ubuntu , but that is personal of course . 
  but . . my question . 
  where can i see the plans ? 
  basically , i want to know whether the lane river will be improved or not . 
  if not , i am thinking about starting a social movement to come with ideas and plans to make the river live up to its potential . 
  then we have at least a whole year to come with a good bid for the project , 
   the lan\u00eb ( definite albanian form : lana ) is the main stream that crosses through tirana , the capital of albania . 
  its source is in the mountains east of tirana . 
  although once clean , it now carries sewage . 
  before there were many buildings around and on the banks of the river , but they were torn down and removed in a campaign by tirana 's then mayor edi rama . 
  now most of its banks have been planted with different kinds of trees and grass . 
  no fish live there now due to the high pollution of its waters . 
  the lan\u00eb flows into the tiran\u00eb river near b\u00ebrxull\u00eb . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lan%c3%ab ) . 
  if it 's the c720 you are using , look [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/chrubuntu/comments/2f75c1/little_freezes_every_couple_of_minutes/ ) and [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/chrubuntu/comments/2d88dg/freezing_on_c720_ideas/ ) . 
  i am working on setting up a website for this . 
  perhaps with a wiki so people can add and share information . 
  i 'll post it here when it 's online . 
  an anti litter campaign could be part of it too . 
  feel free to pm me if you want to help . 
  the only thing i did from following [ this ] ( http://blogs.fsfe.org/the_unconventional/2014/04/20/c720-debian/ ) guide is :, 
   sudo bash, 
   crossystem dev_boot_usb = 1 dev_boot_legacy = 1, 
   set_gbb_flags . sh 0 \u00d7 489, 
  am i at risk now ? 
  how do i set the proper flags ? 
  i have got a full ubuntu 14.04 installation ( fully wiped chrome , directly booting seabios etc. ), 
  did you learn the language in advance ? 
  how do you earn your living ? 
   that 's probably why the dutch are so high , it 's really easy for them to learn german or english because they are so similar to their native tongue and much more widely spoken . 
  english grammar is completely different to dutch . 
  the same goes for german and dutch . 
  the words may look similar , but dutch , germans and english can not understand each other naturally , some learning is necessary . 
  i 'd argue that the difference is similar to that of the west-slavic languages and the romanic languages . 
  secondly , dutch has more native speakers than hungarian , czech , slovak , greek , swedish , finnish or bulgarian . 
  i disagree with your argumentation and take pride in the fact that dutch people actually take the effort to learn foreign languages and have the proper education system to facilitate that . 
  thanks for your imput . 
  any ideas on how we could structure our ideas into a process ? 
  and who we should have involved , how we get information etc. 
  i 'm trying to create a river flow map of the lana . 
  [ this is ] ( http://sharemap.org/public/lumi_lana ) how far i got . 
  if anybody has the ability to improve it , please feel free . 
  the flow path from where the river starts , to where it enters the city , is very unclear to me . 
  say i 'm a noob , and i have got the i386 ( 32bit ) installed , and i try to install the kernel that you suggest . . wo n't work , will it ? 
  no it wo n't . 
  yes , i should use the i368 versions . 
  i would just like to see an improvement in the op . 
  it is not just a ` fix ' , it is installing a new generation kernel , which is not a bad thing , but it might just break other stuff people have fixed and installed . 
  in almere the bus lanes are not on the main roads , but are a seperate infrastructure just like the dutch do with many cycle lanes . 
  an other dutch city ( enschede ) [ does ] ( http://www.fransmensonides.nl/foto/busbaanzuid.jpg ) [ have ] ( http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/83/4d/0e/834d0e0ffb039463d63047de69d33ed6.jpg ) [ dedicated ] ( http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/52/4a/61/524a61ec807decd3492ab8517e927a05.jpg ) [ bus lanes ] ( http://rajvdb.home.xs4all.nl/lra/afb/enschede-hovmap.jpg ) on the main roads . 
  as do eindhoven and many others . 
  almere is one step ahead , but hey . . it 's a planned city , that 's cheating , 
  i am installing kubuntu on a costumers desktop pc in december , will use 14.04 for longer support , will i be able to install plasma 5 and will it be stable by then ? 
  it 's perfect for everyone who just wants ( x ) ubuntu on their c720 . 
  highly recommended , and for updates just follow what he does on that page . 
  great to have this device without being linked to a carrier  looking forward to the speedy update . 
  having a large hungarian minority , with strong historical ties being part of hungary , slovakia is not very keen to promote separation . 
  does anyone have a clue how often the lana has high flows / floods on a yearly basis ? 
  i need to find out more about the technical aspects of the river , 
  there are quite some motorola-specific apps though , which are not included in those lists . 
  2.5 gb backup ? 
  what is the use of that ? 
  i just have my pics synced in the cloud and to my pc , i see no need for backups . 
  c720 used to be a little tricky , but seriously , it is n't hard anymore these days . . my proposal :, 
  1 . use [ this ] ( http://blogs.fsfe.org/the_unconventional/2014/04/20/c720-debian/ ) guide to get the boot and grub right, 
  2 . use [ hugegreenbug 's ubuntu 14.04 iso ] ( https://www.distroshare.com/distros/get/12/ ) and install as you 're used to, 
  you now have a fully functional , speedy , sleek netbook . 
  some finetuning got my system up and running using little over 400mb ram , so i 've got plenty left for my everyday tasks . 
  would yingge be a good city to go to see a less industrialized authentic lifestyle in taiwan ? 
  i do n't fancy the most spectecular sights , just sleepy cute towns will do , 
  where can i find information for the busses ? 
  elsewhere i read that i have to go to xindian . . 
  it 's how you use ubuntu too , for my most critical systems i only use the newest lts when the first point release is out . 
  rock solid . 
  if there was demand , would n't they 've build something themselves ? 
  this foreign interference scares me the same way russia 's interference in it 's post-soviet borderland does . 
  this is purely a geopolitical game that has everything to do with influence and power , and nothing with religion . 
  a game that albania should n't go along with . 
  make a fist now yourselves , or have one stuck up your arse for a long time to come . . 
  so you are saying that lollipop will be just as snappy , and the battery will last as long ? 
  so all that changes for me then really is the looks here and there . 
  fair enough , at least no reason to not switch then . 
  or will it actually be faster , and will the battery last longer ? 
  is there proof of that ? 
  on the other hand , unused ram is wasted ram ? 
  or do n't . . 
  depends on your preferences . 
  i want my phone to do what i want , fast and the way i order it to be , not the other way around . 
  my favourite is the smart launcher ( pro ) , but there are tons of good launchers out there . 
  just try some , 
  if you do , tell me how it went . 
  i am considering the same move . 
  what file did you use for your xt1032 ? 
  eu retail has nothing yet . . 
  i want my tv to be dumb , and i 'll connect something affordable and smart to it , which can be updated and upgraded easily , without buying a new tv . 
  sinking ?
