  hi all , i 'm flying with china airlines through taiwan , where i 've got 16 hours to spend . 
  i 've done this before and spent the day in taipei ( flying into taoyuan ) . 
  this time i want to do something else , see a more authentic town/city and perhaps see some of the taiwanese nature . 
  i 'm keen to catch a train or bus somewhere . 
  any tips that fit within this timeframe ? 
  also , consider that i 'll be flying into taoyuan int . 
  airport . 
  i 've installed owncloud client on my 14.04 machine , but the system tray icon does n't show , nor do the settings manager . 
  running it in terminal gives this :, 
  socketapi : server started , listening at '' / run/user/1000 / owncloud/socket '', 
  = = = = added system ignore list to socketapi : '' / etc/owncloud/sync-exclude . lst '', 
  = = = = added user defined ignore list to csync : '' / home/rr1991 / . local/share/data / owncloud/sync-exclude . lst '', 
  setting remote poll timer interval to 30000 msec, 
  int main ( int , char ** ) already running , exiting ... 
  any ideas ? 
  xt1032 here . 
  my moto g is stock , snappy and smooth , the battery life is great . 
  i 've got a perfectly costumized launcher ( smart launcher pro ) with gestures neatly setup . 
  i like my numix icons , owncloud and caldav + cardav sync is all setup and running like breeze . 
  the bottum slider lockscreen is pretty sleek too , chromecast works nicely and i 've got the latest moto app versions from [ here ] ( http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/motorola-mobility-llc/ ) . 
  basically , i 've never been so happy with my mobile setup before . 
  but i 'm always looking for new , the latest etc. 
  like many of you here probably . 
  so please , explain or convince me , why should i ( not ) want to upgrade to lollipop ? 
  i ran into [ this ] ( http://stellaculinary.com/recipes/70-hydration-sourdough-boule ) recipe . 
  i have been baking my sourdough bread with a way smaller portion of starter than here . 
  usually 12-13 % of the loaf , or 20 % in bakers percentage . 
  this recipe uses 100 % starter , which seems a lot to me . 
  is this just to guarantee good fermentation and rise , is it to improve speed , will it result in a very different crumb than say using 20 % starter and letting it ferment and proof for longer ? 
  what are your thoughts on this recipe ? 
  i 'm traveling through romania and one of my big goals is to see the transfaragasan highway . 
  unfortunately , it is impossible to rent a car since all the agencies are out of cars . 
  is there anyone in sibiu with a car who would like to take us up the road and back tomorrow ? 
  petrol and lunch/drinks are on us . 
  our only request is a sane driver . 
  let 's have an adventure , we 're 2 dutch guys . 
  pm if you can really help , 
  i tried installing gallium , but without removing my / home partition . 
  now that i 've set to use a previous account , the new settings for key bindings , theme etc. 
  do n't work . 
  what do i need to remove from my / home/username folder to get the settings and themes to work ? 
  the updater wants to update my grub , what should i want to do ? 
  it 's a c720 , and i have no clue whether to keep the old one , accept the ` maintainers version ' , or merge . 
  i have been a fan of opensuse for quite a while and used it years back for my daily driver . 
  when university came around , i had to use more and more apps that would n't work on suse . 
  as years have passed i would like to know if it is worth giving leap a try . 
  some essential applications for me are :, 
  * mendeley ( article library and citing ), 
  * maple ( calculation software ), 
  besides that i need / like to use :, 
  * dropbox, 
  * spotify, 
  with ubuntu it has always been a breeze to install this . 
  how is suse doing these days ? 
  i really enjoy gallium and its tweaks , but i also want unity . . 
  therefore i installed ubuntu-desktop , fixed all the hotkeys etc. 
  everything is fine now , apart from that i can not get natural scrolling to work with the touchpad . 
  i have a c720 ( peppy ) . 
  where can i set the natural scrolling ? 
  [ removed ], 
  so i recently moved to new zealand ( auckland ) , and found that it is hard to get places without a car . 
  i could rent a car every time i want to head out , but i want to see if there are alternatives . 
  i found cityhop and yourdrive as options . 
  has anyone of you used one of these services ? 
  how was your experience ? 
  how much did it cost you ? 
  how does it compare to classic car rental services ? 
  ideally , i 'd use it to go out for daytrips in the weekend , say for one saturday or sunday every other week . 
  keen to hear your experiences and tips . 
  i started with 5.04 , as a bored teenager , when i got a cd shipped to me for free !, 
  in 12 years of desktop use i have experimented , tweaked and broken a lot of installations . 
  any installation required tweaking , or fixing things . 
  also my previous two laptops , an msi with nvidia hybrid graphics , and an acer c720 chromebook needed a lot of work to get them to work how i wanted ( graphics , keyboard , suspend , wifi , trackpad issues ... ) . 
  i only just realised , looking back at the past months , something changed for me .
