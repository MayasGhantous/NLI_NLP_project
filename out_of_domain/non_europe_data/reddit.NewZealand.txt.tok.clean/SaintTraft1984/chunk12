  lol, 
  huh ? 
  maze is only one difficulty ? 
  oh memes are included . 
  lol okay , that one 's on me . 
  i 'll admit , i skimmed the rules . 
  i just assumed stuff like porn and whatnot were obviously not allowed while everything else were free-for-all . 
  okay , just wanted to be sure i was n't missing anything . 
  btw , is the rumor about a moogle pointing the right door legit ? 
  or another hoax ? 
  ah , ** behind ** the door . 
  okay , got it . 
  thank you !, 
  used up the 20 tickets i 've saved up for noctis . 
  got 4 chizurus instead . 
  fused all of them into the max chizuru i already had waiting . 
  i was kind of hoping for mercedes as well but , meh , story of my ffbe life . 
  main party is currently wol , cod , exdeath , bartz and refia . 
  doing well enough , though , i will admit that i would n't be able to go through the recent events if it was n't for my whale friends ( i love you all . 
  you know yourselves . ) . 
  sadly , like the noob ftp player that i am , i was pulled in by the noctis hype and blew the meager 20 tickets and 5,000 lapis that i had on day-1 . 
  i did get a total of 4 chizurus and a bunch of charlottes though . 
  yep , you hit it . 
  it was probably due to her ` baby fats ' . 
  it 's a shame that she 's getting real thin lately . 
  i hope she puts some of the old weight back on . 
  like most british women , she looks better with a little ` more on the side ' . 
  i just hope they give medius a skill or passive that will combo with him having draw attacks . 
  that thing was just so randomly slapped on to him . 
  it does n't fit him game-play-wise , and it definitely ** does not ** fit him flavor / design wise . 
  cerius , i dunno , i 'm neutral towards him atm since i already have cod 's omni-veil . 
  who ? 
  lol, 
  upvoted . 
  if those 3 were ever included in kingdom hearts , those would definitely be their profile pictures . 
  nicely done . 
  i take it your teachers * never see you coming * . 
  sometimes too much of something can be bad . 
  best example would be the units in brave frontier . 
  i 'm happy that they learned from bf and made sure they went a little easy with the effects / auras in be . 
  just the perfect amount . 
  exdeath and cod are unique because they 're bosses from their games so they need to be a little daunting with their auras . 
   david caruso, 
  hahahahaha it is , is n't it ? 
  i just noticed now when you pointed him out xd, 
  enchantment removal and pte / stp . 
  reason is there is a particular enchantment card and a creature card that specifially disables lifegain . 
  forgot their names but yeah , they exist . 
  the other sideboard worthy cards would be decided by your local meta . 
  thank you for the back up , rattypack2000 . 
  forgot that stp are not allowed in modern . 
  global . 
  yeah , this has never happened before . 
  i 've switched accounts from a number of devices due to me travelling or acquiring a new phone / tab . 
  my account has been linked to both gmail and fb since day-1 of global release . 
  i 'm that thorough . 
  i 'm still overseas so i 'll find out when i get home to my desktop if the problem has rectified itself . 
  i hope it has . 
  i 'm just a ` dolphin ' when it comes to spending on this game but my expenditures have accumulated to a certain point where it 'll really , really suck if my account is gone for good . 
  i believe the usual land count for boggle auras is 20 so i 'm sticking with that . 
  i am so tempted to but as you can see , too much 3cc spells in a deck like this hurts it . 
  currently doing the recruitment process with the royal new zealand police . 
  grinding myself to get that running mastery skill . 
  you better be able to cast curaja and full raise when you graduate . 
  i expect nothing but the best for my family when it comes to child care . 
  thought so . 
  guess i 'm adding the birds in until i get a new set of nobles . 
  i do n't know about you all but i personally hate and find unfair , lightning bolt and turbo fog decks . 
  i hate and think lightning bolt is unfair because of the fact that a cheap and easy to find common , blows out of the water my expensive and hard to come by noble hierarch on turn 1 . 
  something about that just rubs me the wrong way . 
  i hate and think turbo fog decks are unfair because the whole idea of the deck , which has minimal interactions , goes against the core magic gameplay which are you play spells , land creatures on the field , smash each other 's faces with those creatures and many more . 
  why play mtg at all if you 'll just go with a near zero interaction deck like turbo fog ? 
   utopia sprawls, 
  interesting point !, 
  yes , i 've experienced the horror of turn-1 hierarche / birds dies to bolt myself . 
  i believe your suggestion is more safe and strategically sound . 
  thanks !, 
  never heard of this card before you mentioned it . 
  my boggle is the scout simply for aesthetic reasons . 
  you all must agree that the elf looks way , way better compared to that ` thing ' . 
  about the paths though , i believe most boggle decks do n't have a single removal on the main deck since the idea of it is to slap auras on your creatures and beat your opponent 's face non-stop . 
  interesting . 
  i was wondering on what i could drop for spirit mantle or another umbra aura . 
  however , would n't keen sense help in the event that spiritdancer dies ? 
  thank you !, 
  i 'll test it since as you can see , the idea of my deck is to slap on as many cheap auras as possible then smash face . 
  currently i 'm also looking into spirit mantle . 
  hahahaha !, 
  fair enough . 
  i already have 4 ptes in my binder collecting dust so i believe this may be the perfect time to test them out again . 
  nah , just turbo fog specifically due to some bad experience with it . 
  i know creature-less decks are even worse and a lot more in legacy . 
  turbo fog and i just remembered now as i type this ; land-d decks . 
  ( shudder ) hate those things . 
  wow , this is exactly what i needed to hear . 
  thank you very much !, 
  i 'm now looking into spirit mantle set to help get through blockers and also adding in another umbra . 
  i 'm leaning more towards the single g spider umbra i think . 
  it gives +1 / +1 and reach . 
  the reach does n't matter , i just need the single g in it 's cost to make it a turn faster in casting it .
