  update : okay , i 've re-installed the game and this time tried connecting in-game the fb and google play . 
  still nothing , however , the data clearly still exists because when i tried creating a new one with the same name , it says that the name is already taken . 
  basically , it seems my game data has been disconnected from both my facebook and google play account which are both under the same e-mail . 
  can anyone help me with this , please ? 
  how do i tag cm_rin ? 
  i already submitted a ticket to support but so far , i 'm still waiting for their reply . 
  ~ ~ i 'm surprised you do n't have kor spiritdancer in there . 
  might want to check her out . ~ ~ nevermind . 
  i fail . 
  spiritdancer only works with auras specifically , not all enchantments . 
  wow from fire to lightning . 
  very interesting to see what brought that on . 
  oh right lol . 
  ugh , i 'm sleepy haha . 
  oh okay , so that 's why she suddenly became fire element . 
  to be honest , i just plan on awakening the 7ks and any other hero who 's awakened look and skill animations attract me . 
  off the top of my head those would be hellenia ( who i just awakened despite being naked of equipment ) and i 'm eagerly waiting for bidam . 
  yeah , noticed that detail with the sword too . 
  i guess the flame element and phoenix comes from the sword ? 
  it could also simply be a sign of respect for rachel to carry it fighting . 
  my ug infect would feel the sting a little with mutagenic growth gone . 
  not sure if my ex giant growth will take me back then . 
  lol, 
  a set of breaking / / entering is in my ub mill . 
  only because glimpse the unthinkable is **** crazy expensive . 
  entering is just icing on the cake to be honest . 
  if i 'm able to use it , great , if not it 's fine . 
  i mainly need the mill from breaking . 
  ** fire emblem heroes question **, 
  alright , finally got a banner hero -- lyn . 
  now , i know she was a beast in the blazing blade , however , i was actually aiming for takumi since i like archers and i like his character sprite design . 
  take note i ** have n't played any of the fire emblem fates ** yet so my question is ; should i settle for lyn who i already got or go ahead and continue re-rolling for takumi ? 
  yeah no surprise . 
  she was crazy good back in her own game . 
  also , being a blademaster she 's more flexible as oppose to archers . 
  but , out of curiosity , what can you tell me about takumi ? 
  both as a unit and his character story . 
  i actually used to have a uw etb deck featuring stonehorn and detain creatures . 
  the stall was nice , if i was able to pull it off . 
  what about birthing pod decks ? 
  wo n't venser be able to supplement the multitude of etb creatures in that deck ? 
  actually tried an etb flicker deck i copied off the net featuring stonehorn , mulldrifter and blade splicer . 
  added some detain in the form of lyev skynight . 
  it was so-so . 
  like you mentioned , the deck was just too slow for modern . 
  was fun on the kitchen counter though . 
  oh right ... wow forgot about that . 
  welp , so much for that idea . 
  you really hit the nail with what i needed to hear and i very much appreciate your feedback and honesty . 
  to give a good idea of my magic experience ; my current decks since scars of mirrodin ( which is when i started mtg ) :, 
  * mono w soul sisters - my main modern deck that i bring to fnms, 
  * ug infect, 
  * mono b vampires, 
  * ub mill ( forgot about this lol ), 
  lastly , i 'm more into bant colors which is what attracted me to knightfall in the first place . 
  do you have any good recommendations for bant because outside of uw control , gw boggle and knightfall ? 
  it seems bant rarely makes it in the top decks this year . 
  edit : as you can see most of the decks i have except for ss are just fun decks to be used in the kitchen counter . 
  last time i used tribal at an fnm i got my butt handed to me . 
  that 's the thing , i was hoping knightfall would be the go to deck for me in all future modern events . 
  i 'm actually trying to semi-quit magic by getting rid of my other decks ( i have 5 ) . 
  it 's starting to become an addiction . 
  with knightfall , i was hoping to get rid of the 5 and other unused cards in my home . 
  thank you for your feedback and honesty , though , i 'll just have to keep looking for that one deck to use until i grow old . 
  yeah that 's the thing , i already have inkmoth but that 's pretty much it . 
  i do n't even have the innistrad dual for ug . 
  let alone fetches . 
  and that infect of mine also does n't have a sideboard lol . 
   you do n't need innistrad duals for infect . 
  also , the new ug fastlands are a great budget addition . 
  6 fetches , 2 breeding pool , 2 pendelhaven , 2 forest , 4 botanical sanctum , 4 inkmoth is all you need . 
  if you 're going to get a deck in modern , buying into one when you already own some of the cards is probably a good idea . 
  ugh ... those 6 fetches are going to make my budget cry but thank you !, 
  at least i have a good idea on how else to push my infect to competitive mode . 
  was n't really surprised when my archer did 0 damage to him tbh . 
  tales of destiny and tales of phantasia please . 
  would gladly spend $ $ . 
  huh ? 
  woah , never noticed it till now . 
   '' ... . a good bracket ... . '', 
  i was afraid of that . 
  though i still do n't have ranger of eos and archangel of thune in my soul sisters , i was recently decimated at a modern fnm at my lgs . 
  i was , unfortunately , matched up against rg titan ramp and ub faeries . 
  my supposed 3rd match was unknown because the player conceded due to an emergency he had to attend to . 
  but yeah , i lost real bad that night . 
  made me think if it was time for my soul sisters to turn in the towel . 
  i feel norin sisters is an entirely different deck with the red splash . 
  i 'd like to just stick to the mono-w build . 
  bte have always been a 4-off part of my main deck . 
  however , i am still having difficulty finding archangel of thune where i live . 
  the nearest shop only has 1 . 
  i am surprised that he fared well without hotp . 
  in a way , i think his anthem came in the form of the angel which is better in the long run . 
  too many times i 've had hotp in the field but no creatures to take advantage of it . 
  agreed . 
  too many times i 've had hotp on the field but nothing to beat with it . 
  almost always , my opponents would respond and kill my sisters before it resolves . 
  pointless . 
  i settled for 4 bte because to be honest , i 've had so many games wherein i got anger of the gods or slag stormed to oblivion because all 4 btes would n't show up . 
  my top-deck luck is that bad .
