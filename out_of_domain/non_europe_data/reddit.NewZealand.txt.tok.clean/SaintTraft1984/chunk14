  if 4 wo n't show , neither will 3 or 2 . 
  really miss her pre-jonas weight . 
  if your soul sisters are already fully equipped including the sideboard , you should n't have problems . 
  i 'm still lacking a stable side-board , set of ranger of eos , set of archangel thunes , set of ghost quarters and flagstones . 
  which is why i got my ass handed to me last time . 
  sadly , only good for the kitchen counter . 
  not as fast as boggles so it 's no good in high level competitive play . 
  feels reeeeeal good , though , when invisible stalker or geist of saint traft are all fully aura equipped and smashes face . 
  souls sisters and bant auras hexproof . 
  soul sisters because the deck can actually smash face hard even though it 's a life-gain deck . 
  most life-gain decks have other win-cons , very rarely with creatures . 
  bant auras hexproof because geist of saint traft is my favorite creature and i like how i can just comfortably slap auras on my creatures to buff them because of hexproof . 
  outside of counter-spells , sac and sweeper effects , very little can get in the way of that . 
  after seeing all those years ago how ivy from soul calibur uses a weapon like that ; these animations are really disappointing and shows laziness in their design . 
  yes , the sword-ship does n't have to be used the exact same way as it is in other games . 
  however , the way her animations look , make it seem she just randomly picked up that sword-whip from some ditch and decided to attack with it . 
  i admit , my standards are a bit high . 
  still , they should 've just given her just energy based powers that she uses when she waves her hands around . 
  that 's what her attacks look like anyways . 
  her attack animations do n't transition smoothly from neutral stance to attack stance to recovery stance . 
  heck , there 's no recovery form at all . 
  she just immediately goes back to standing position and the sword-whip appears immediately where it is in neutral stance . 
  the worse one for me is the awakening skill . 
  just a bunch of energy ribbons with no visual representation that it 's a sword-whip . 
  even made worse is they just appear out of nowhere and not in a cool awesome way . 
  like you said , awkward . 
  true enough . 
  the emotion part though , heh , now the body movements kind of makes sense a bit . 
  i 'll give them points for the character itself . 
  they should 've just dropped that sword-whip altogether and instead saved it for a future character that may utilize it more and fit them flavorwise . 
  do you think these recent changes will reduce the prices on some modern cards ? 
  i do n't expect cards like tarmogoyf or vendilion clique prices to drop but it 's just annoying when cards like archangel of thune are pricey even though they rarely see play . 
  i mean i ca n't even get my deck pieces for the counter top because of the crazy prizes . 
  i have the exact same deck . 
  let me tell you , it 's slow . 
  like really . 
  if it 's for your local fnm or counter-top it 's fine . 
  it 's lots of fun to see our traft all buffed up and swinging in for the win . 
  it 's even more fun when i start play with turn-1 hierarch , turn-2 traft , turn-3 auras then swing for 10 + ( including the angel ) . 
  but do n't expect much from it when it comes to competitive level play . 
  it 's that slow . 
  you and i are better off sticking to gw boggles for high level play . 
  adding blue for traft makes for an explosive deck , if you get the right cards . 
  my experience ; with gw at least the starting hand and draws are more forgiving . 
  bant traft requires a specific starting hand and plays top-deck on the get go . 
  ** tldr ; casual fun play , bant aura hexproof is fine . 
  high-level competitive play , gw boggles all the way . 
  * traft when fully buffed can get out of hand real quick, 
  * an excuse to play my favorite creature ; geist of saint traft over that ugly thing called boggle . 
  * explosive when starting with a god-hand which consists of 1 noble hierarch , saint traft , steel of godhead and the rest lands and auras, 
  * turn 2 traft is one of the best feelings in the world, 
  ** cons : **, 
  * a turn slow compared to the classic gw boggles deck which is crucial in a fast environment like modern . 
  * traft is legendary . 
  making a dead card if you draw him instead of a much needed aura, 
  * adding a 3rd color makes every starting hand / mulligan and draw crucial and less forgiving, 
  * top-deck mode as early as turn-1 if you 're not lucky with your starting or mulligans, 
  why not start with the tried and tested mono u merfolk decks ? 
  one of the few tribals that actually make it to gp finals . 
  which says a lot because the competitive side of modern can be very unforgiving when it comes to tribal decks . 
  in mono u merfolk , you get the best of both worlds ; control and aggro . 
  yeah , sadly if we really want to use traft , we 'll have to go control with counters and swords to support him . 
  i hope your account get 's bugged or something . 
  it 's nice that they 're free but ... ugh ... ** those ** are the winning costumes ? 
  can we save the free summon for future releases ? 
  like , can i save it for when orlandu get 's added to the pool ? 
  can we save the latest free 10 +1 summon for future use ? 
  like , save it for until orlandu or sephiroth ( because cloud is coming ) get 's added to the pool ? 
  damn ... okay thank you !, 
  aw ... okay thank you !, 
  it 's your usual mono-w soul sisters . 
  already have a set of ranger , ascendant and spectral possession etc. 
  really , it 's just the archangel that i 'm missing . 
  it 's so frustrating because you see these gp results and nowhere do you see archangel of thune . 
  but for some damn reason , she is so hard to find !, 
  i still appreciate taking the time to share your input . 
  thank you !, 
  the price is fine . 
  what amazes me is how hard it is to look for her here in nz and yet whenever i play at my lgs , i never see her . 
  edh or modern or whatever format . 
  nowhere to be seen . 
  really , really vexing . 
  4 of seeing as all of the recent gp results with soul sisters included had 3 ~ 4 thunes in the deck . 
  not right now , no , but that option ** is ** on the table . 
  i appreciate the input . 
  you caught my eye with anafenza and return to the ranks . 
  might put in 2 and also replace my procalamation of rebirth in the sideboard with rttr . 
  nope . 
  have a set of every souls sister staple already . 
  really , thune is the only one missing and it is so vexing !, 
  i 'll be editing this post when i get home to add on the full decklist . 
  and no , i opted to drop the martyr strategy . 
  it has a nice explosive start but gets really bad in late games . 
  it 's an interesting alt win con . 
  might try as a one of as that 50 life requirement is near impossible to get to with a competent opponent . 
  no player in their right mind would let me hit 30 for my ascendant and even less so to hit 50 for that .
