  i went ahead and edited my post at the top to include the decklist . 
  let me go ahead and review the list you linked . 
  highly unlikely but it would be one of the most beautiful things in this world if ufotable were to be given the task of making an anime version . 
  anyone else remember unlimited budget works ? 
  it was glorious . 
  i really appreciate the time you put in your in-depth reply . 
  you pretty much nailed everything i needed to hear . 
  assuming that i 'm able to acquire all of those pieces you suggested ; would i stand a better fighting chance against those two control decks above ? 
  because , man , if you were there , it was just painful to watch me get decimated . 
  now , i checked the prices of the cards you mentioned at my lgs and sadly , fetches and spellskite really are out of reach for me atm . 
  i could probably buy spellskites one at a time every fortnight but i still need to double check . 
  however , i do have a set of rancor already in my stock pile , so i just need to get my hands on might of old krosa and blossoming defense ( my lgs ran out of them ) . 
  i already placed an order for a set of turn aside , seal of primordium , x2 yavimaya coast and x2 become immense . 
  for become immense , is 2 a good number ? 
  i imagine it 's something i wo n't be hard casting so i figured drawing it too early is a bad thing . 
  `` hehe nice shark . 
  huh ? 
  i wonder what he 's pointing a. ... omfg ! '', 
  originally i was planning to go with a full set of yavimaya coast . 
  however , after some online playtesting i found that having more than one in the field and tapping them for a color really hurts . 
  as you mentioned , botanical sanctum , i found that 4 of those + 1 coast should suffice . 
  i just found my apostle 's blessings set as well so that 's good . 
  all that 's missing now is blossoming defense . 
  i 'll travel to the nearby city ( 30mins drive ) and see if the lgs there has them . 
  crossing fingers . 
  as for going mono color , i dunno , if i 'm going to change into a mono color , should n't i just sell all of these cards and just switch to mono black ? 
  that 's what i ask myself . 
  ah , i also went ahead and e-mailed the shop to replace seal of primordium with nature 's claim . 
  that single g in it 's cost is just too good to pass up . 
  my list used to have spell pierce , however , after going against some ramp or control decks , i found that they were able to easily pay for that 2 mana condition with pierce . 
  since my aim is to protect my creatures , i 'm opting for apostle 's blessing and turn aside . 
  regrettably , there is truth in what you 're saying . 
  personally , i just play for fun anyways , but that does n't mean i 'm not willing to spend a little more if it will make my decks stronger . 
  however , atm , current prices of certain pieces like fetches , skites and hiearches really are just too much for someone like me who does n't compete in gp size tournaments . 
  also , if i was going to spend that much on a single card , i make it a point to focus on my main deck first which is soul sisters . 
  this infect deck of mine is just a secondary one . 
  uhhh okay . 
  lol i 'm 33 hahahaha . 
  it 's all good . 
  i wanted to hear some nice crisp feedback . 
  you and the others took the time to give it and that 's more than enough . 
  i guess seeing your reply was that wake up nudge that i needed . 
  i 've always had a feeling that i was holding my decks back due to my budget constraints and that if i really wanted to play-to-win that i should really shell out on those key cards . 
  you just confirmed that , friend . 
  it will be a while before i get my hands on those fetches and skites but at least i can start saving up for them . 
  to be honest , i ** can ** buy them but not as a set . 
  i can only do so one at a time per each payday fortnightly . 
  so that 's why one of the guys that night i played had some of his cards flipped with something written on them ... 
  always thought they were n't allowed beyond kitchen counters . 
  interesting ... 
  same reason why i wo n't switch to mono black infect . 
  i 'm too far in already in my expenses with this deck that i 'm just going to lose more cash in the long run since my cards will only be bought for less than half of what i paid for them . 
  my only course is to see this deck through or drop infect entirely . 
  i want weston , shirley , mittens and sir bibit in the game as heroes !!, 
  pretty sure that 's shepard disabling reaper ships with some sort of electro magnetic device . 
  lol that 's just the bra lining guys ... come on ... 
  i 'm sure a lot of ftp will rage about it but even they have to admit ; akuma needs to be op like jam and ichigo . 
  it fits in perfectly with his background story . 
  it 's even better because after oldboy , we all pretty much have a good idea of what they look like . 
  which is a bit of a shame really . 
  with akuma , at least they can make it so he has very low max hp ? 
  that 's how it is in the actual sf games . 
  hits hard but man he 's a glass cannon lol . 
  hehe , congratulations on your first !, 
  did you realize then and there how a deck with a full load out of fetches does compared to one that does n't have any ? 
  i know i did on my first modern fnm . 
  tongue < 3, 
  i 'm sure others would be able to provide more . 
  but as another bant auras player , these are the cards just off the top of my head that you could do :, 
  * x4 ** path to exile ** - you 're only removal . 
  you wo n't regret having a full set in your main . 
  * x4 ** gryff 's boon ** - replace all of your spectral flight and aqueous form with this . 
  you 'll want it for the flying , +1 atk all for a single w. 
  * x4 ** spider umbra ** - reach is just a bonus . 
  you 'll want it mainly for the +1 / +1 and totem aura . 
  * x4 ** unstable mutation ** - since you 're adding u , might as well take advantage of this . 
  take note though , you need to end the game quickly if you have this on . 
  * 4th ** rancor ** - it 's that good, 
  * 4th ** hyena umbra ** - it 's that good, 
  * 1 or 2 ** dryad arbor ** - protection against sac effects which is the deck 's weakness along with sweepers . 
  drop the following :, 
  * ** spectral flight ** - too slow, 
  * ** aqueous form ** - does n't boost your creatures damage which is what you should be after . 
  * ** invocation of saint traft ** - too slow and if you 're going with that , then you might as well just add the actual * geist of saint traft * to the deck . 
  * ** unflinching courage ** - too slow, 
  the thing is , aura decks tend to have only two working modes : high-speed aggro or full-on-control . 
  you ca n't have both . 
  i recommend going with speed which is why most boggle decks only run 2 colors . 
  i tried running bant with saint traft but sadly , it 's explosive win is n't consistent enough and most of the time , i lose due to being a turn slow with my lethal . 
  ** lastly , if you really insist on running bant , then you really need to get at least 2 sets of fetches . 
  even the 2 color boggle decks run fetches . 
  even more so if you add a 3rd color . 
  nice , good on you and your positivity !, 
  personally i 'm a ` glass is half empty ' kind of guy . 
  lol, 
  what i love about her . 
  especially those arms and hips . 
  rawr ... 
  most english women are . 
  what i love about them .
