  when should i use my burst pots on cecil ? 
  i finally got him for the first time at 3-star rank . 
  should i get him to max first before i start dumping my burst pots on him or is it okay to start as early as now ? 
  yep . 
  they 're harmless gentle giants until they breach and slam right on top of you . 
  lol, 
  girl on the left looks interesting . 
  fetchlands are a must even if you 're running mono color . 
  i 'll say this , it feels like majority of wizards employees are jund / naya players . 
  lol, 
  aw was hoping for cammy waifu . 
  very interesting . 
  i do recall my lgs having a lot of players running [ [ runed halo ] ] . 
  would n't that sorcery speed be my downfall ? 
  39 tickets , ftp player . 
  lol, 
  100 % ftp , got him on 34th ticket, 
  according to the wikia and some of my friends that already got their orlandeau to 6-star ; he seems to be missing his hallowed bolt . 
  did they really remove it from his gl version ? 
  with the title of `` thunder god '' one can chill and do whatever the hell one wants . 
  always pull out . 
  public or not . 
  better safe than sorry . 
  i hope you never stop making these . 
  even long after you 've quit from the playing the game , i hope you 'd pay a regular visit to see the latest character to be added just so you could make a comic for them . 
  i love the stuff that you randomly make chizuru do . 
  it 's like she actually knows if sht is about to go down and acts accordingly while still being calm and collected the entire time . 
  really funny . 
  nope . 
  i run the mono white soul sisters . 
  since you 're just about to buy into the deck , check if you have the budget for fetches and dual lands . 
  even the mono white versions use fetches at least . 
  the only reason i still have n't converted to norin is because i 'm reluctant to run duals . 
  as for gameplay , i kind of prefer the mono white version . 
  however , it seems norin can get explosive as well with his multiple etb triggers . 
  just make sure you do n't forget about them . 
  she 's endearing , always being behind that bar ready with the drinks or the fire extinguisher hahahaha !!, 
  wow ... talk about a first class buffet line ... 
  i have a ug infect deck as well . 
  replace aqueous form with [ [ artful dodge ] ] , [ [ distortion strike ] ] or [ [ slip through space ] ] for synergy with your wild defiance . 
  take your pick . 
  move apostle 's blessing to side your sideboard . 
  run 4 vines of vastwood instead of 2 . 
  might want to look into [ [ blossoming defense ] ] and [ [ might of old krosa ] ] as the others have pointed out . 
  there 's just no reason not to play [ [ vampire nighthawk ] ] . 
  i 'd drop any of the other vamps just to put him in . 
  he 's that good in this tribe . 
  you might also want to look at [ [ gifted aetherborn ] ] . 
  he 's nighthawk that does n't fly but comes a turn faster . 
  [ [ ponder ] ] . 
  still ca n't accept that they banned it . 
  proof that majority of wizards staff do n't play or hate blue . 
  ponder get 's banned while red gets to keep their [ [ lightning bolt ] ] and black just recently got [ [ fatal push ] ] . 
  what . 
  if i purchase orlandeau 's ** crush helm ** ability , will it automatically be added to his skill list ? 
  or will it require and use up an ability slot ? 
  i 've never purchased exclusive abilities before which is why i do n't know . 
  just go to the selection list and see which costs the least amount and easiest to acquire materials . 
  i think it 's cure but just go to the list to double check . 
  why not both ? 
  noctis shines mainly in a support role anyways while firion is mainly dps . 
  i do n't have noctis myself but i do have firion and the main things that are great about him are a ) his equipment selection and b ) the amount of killer passives he has . 
  depending on the enemy , he can really hit hard . 
  firion is good . 
  i do n't do macro farming , only do the hard long route of using moogles and duplicates . 
  i keep duplicates of weapon tms . 
  off the top of my head , those come from the following :, 
  * kain - gungnir ( though i recently fused my 2nd with the 1st ), 
  for non weapon tms i keep 2 or more of the following :, 
  * montana - camouflage, 
  * medius - growth egg, 
  for now , if you do n't have it yet and you do n't macro farm , i 'd focus on dw then dc if you can . 
  personally , i 've expanded my hero slots regardless of tms because i want to have at least ** 1 of each unit ** for collection purposes . 
  really ? 
  ew ... man , nevermind then . 
  thanks !, 
  if i have time and currency to spare , i 'll just get it for collection purposes . 
  firion should be a good finisher for that chizuru chain of your 's . 
  personally , i 'd use noctis just to balance out my party . 
  none at the moment . 
  the exclusive character i 've been saving up for all this time since i started playing a year ago , i finally got for 34 tickets out of the 54 i had : the thunder god himself . 
  he 's my first and currently only 5-star base . 
  i 've begun saving up again and this time it 'll be for sephiroth , lenneth valkyrie and citan uzuki . 
  edit : grammar nazi, 
  wow , you got ta be the smartest person in the world right now . 
  a remember a time when shantoto was the mage to go to for high-end dps and elemental coverage . 
  and a time when pre-6-star chizuru and her barrage was a monster that pretty much ate even trial bosses for breakfast . 
  hahahaha just some good ol' internet fun bro , 
  would be nice if orlandeau 's skills actually had the same animations like in fft . 
  for now , we only see those signature fft special effects in his limit burst . 
  while his normal skills just get recycled animations . 
  well i already was in a semi-quit status due to all the recent grinding events even before the current ifrit raid came along . 
  the only reason i came back full-on is because i was lucky enough to pull the only 5-star i 've been looking forward to all this time : tgc . 
  now that i have him , i have this new vigor to play the game , grinding included . 
  the few things that would probably take my attention away from the game would be career progression ( trying to join the police ) or , god forbid , they nerf orlandeau . 
  that sucks then . 
  oh yeah , i do agree about the chaining in bf . 
  most of the time it 's just a white screen lol . 
  still , even though it will cost them a little , would be nice if they stayed true to the animation / explosion effects of the skills in bf . 
  if i was one of their programmers , i really would n't mind .
