  i checked and dragonstorm is still modern legal . 
  ooooh okay . 
  thanks . 
  that 's why i decided to go all in with my measly 20 tickets even though i 'm ftp . 
  got fryevia after 2 tickets ... 
  working a mon-fri day job at a contact centre . 
  working part-time to join the police . 
  my cecil is at max rank and is just 2 levels away from maxing his limit break . 
  my wol is also at max-5 waiting for his awakening . 
  my question is ; when at max limit break level , should i stick with cecil or does wol outclass him when his 6-star rank comes ? 
  ** edit / tldr ** : who 's better , 6-star cecil with max limit or 6-star wol ? 
  interesting . 
  already have refia and y ` shtola but i will take that into consideration . 
  thank you !, 
  man , i 'm just glad wol 's lb is just a typical damage type . 
  cecil pretty much used up all of my lb pots . 
  thanks !, 
  taking note of that . 
  edit : thank you again for adding even more tips . 
  will try all of them once i 'm in the mood to see his smug trial face again . 
  overall , i have trouble when he starts using x-slash . 
  it pretty much 1-hits 2 ~ 3 units and leave the remaining ones in near death state . 
  thank you for the threads . 
  will look into them when i 'm in the mood to go try the trail again . 
  for now , i 'm book marking those . 
  gawd ... that means i have to go through the ordeal more than once . 
  i 'll have to go through my inventory for golem staff . 
  ca n't remember if i already have it . 
  i think i also have acquired pretty every elemental sword / blade in the game at this point . 
  i 'm up to speed with the story maps as well . 
  though , i 'm still in the process of completing the latest vaults . 
  you 'd be the 3rd person to suggest not doing the missions all in one go . 
  i 'll really look into that now . 
  guess i have no choice in the matter . 
  i just hate him that i wished i could do them all in one go so that i wo n't have to see his pos face again ( except when i pull him in which case , i 'd consider him a beer buddy lol ) . 
  why not both ? 
  always imagined that if humanity every fully migrated into deep space that earth will be the seat of our power . 
  a planet that is so heavily defended that no alien species goes in and out of our solar system without us knowing . 
  it becomes a sort of vip planet that humans who were born off-world would be like `` omg you were born on earth ?!, 
  sounds really cool if you think about it that way . 
  so yeah , why not both ? 
  take care of our home planet while looking for new worlds . 
  rain , bartz , orlandeau , refia , noctis ( friend ) in that order most of the time . 
  i 'm still leveling y ` shtola as well . 
  alright will do . 
  thank you , you two . 
  lol sorry but that teletubbies line just went over my head . 
  i got nothing from that . 
  as for dark souls , it 's a shame really , i 've been reading the lore at the wikia and also the cutscenes in the game and it really got me interesting . 
  but i just ca n't forgive those god **** hitboxes of the enemies . 
  i just ca n't let go of them . 
  i saw that video of 5 orlandeaus downing him in one turn . 
  i barely got my single tgc . 
  highly unlikely that i 'll get 4 more being a ftp . 
  i 'll try the suggestions everyone 's been sending my way , particularly the bits about my max hp and not doing all missions in one go . 
  ** when i 'm in the mood again lol **, 
  the friend that i used had about 900 + dam but i 'm not quite sure if it 's evasion built . 
  i 'll look into righthandman90 's noctis . 
  thanks !, 
   ditch your orlandeu with best possible tank you have . 
  preferably cecil, 
   equip dual wield to rain , so he can seal 4 element in one go . 
   if you dont have dualcast just use ysholta , if you do n't have her either , use 5 character . 
  because with sub par equipment it will be hard . 
   give bartz lightning weapon so you can seal greg with rain and bartz in one turn . 
   if you use ysholta , you can use any of her magic to cover the elements ( wind , holy , eart ), 
   equip your tank with either wind , light , fire , or earth weapon , just in case . 
   sealing water is n't necessary but if you can , why not . 
   use noctis friend as utility ( hp mp regen , lb buff , full raise , or just normal attack to conserve his mp because flask will eat big chunk of mp ) and to seal the element ( flask ) when rain or bartz dies or doing something else . 
  preferably noctis with fire and light weapon , so he can seal 3 element with thunder flask . 
  i was beginning to think this really is an extra nice community which is a big surprise considering this is the internet . 
  lo and behold , you have not failed my expectations !, 
  haha !, 
  on a serious note , thank you for this . 
  i knew there was something off with x-blade 1-hitting my guys , among other things . 
  will re-try again probably next week with these suggestions along with the everyone else 's . 
  cheers !, 
  yeah , everyone 's been saying that . 
  i 'm fine with the energy consumption , it 's just the idea that i have to do this guy more than once that really detracts me from the idea . 
  however , `` beggars ca n't be choosers '' , so i really need to wake up and realize that there 's just no way that i can get all 4 missions in one go . 
  lol i think i 'm 3 landus short of 1 ~ 2 hitting greg . 
  even with a second orlandeau , it just makes it worse because it pushes giglamesh immediately into the 80 % threshold , which as you may know , pretty much wipes me there on the spot . 
  yeah i 'll be focusing on maxing y ` shtola for now . 
  she 's 40 + at 6-star so i 'll do that first . 
  her dc should help heaps . 
  in the meantime , 4 hp boosting belts are in the oven now . 
  i 'll be adding in cecil and y ` shtola ( once i max her ) the next time i give this trial a run . 
  i 'm thinking of keeping rain for all 4 elemental seals . 
  as for y ` shtola , i never knew that bit about her lb . 
  based on the description i thought it only boosted phy def . 
  thanks for clearing that up . 
  i was fine with the damage gap between your hero and the monsters in dark souls . 
  it 's those hit-boxes of the mobs that i just could n't stomach . 
  just went i thought i 've dodged an attack by inches , an invisible hand slaps me silly on my ass . 
  banged on my keyboard more than once , mind you . 
  and chizuru prepared as always . 
  that girl 's going places , i tell you . 
  when was souls sisters released ? 
  i 'm still in the process of completing it 's mana base ( missing 4 flagstones of trokair ) and i need 3 more archangel of thune . 
  kain and artemios ( or probably a new male archer ) .
