  just missing some rare ones now for obvious reasons . 
  oooooh so that 's why . 
  i was wondering the same thing . 
  lol thanks for your contribution and hard work , still . 
  i hear ya . 
  the first and last time i whaled my summon tickets was to get artemios . 
  lately , i 've just used the 250-daily one and so far i 've been lucky enough . 
  i actually got zidane through that and i was n't really aiming for him . 
  i was hoping for garnet , freya or chizuru . 
  lol, 
  haha i know , my photoshop sucks . 
  hahaha i 'm glad you 're pleased . 
  can it be possible that teo is not in the board at all ? 
   hes there , took me 82 for kong ... 
   some people said they need like 80 + slots open to get teo from board . 
  aaaah sweet as . 
  thanks !!, 
  finally got the bas **** . 
  you were all right ; took me exactly 80 pulls in order to get him . 
  can the cms here relay this to netmarble devs , somehow ? 
  i think it 's time that they update jave to this model . 
  so many other games have their knights riding large dragons . 
  heck , they gave rin a big dragon . 
  i ca n't understand why they ca n't do the same for one of the game 's titular characters . 
  yeah , which is why i 'm hoping that the cms here will pass this on that it 's time for the baby dragon to actually grow up . 
  at least now , while jave 's awakening is barely in the works , they can still squeeze this in . 
  if they wo n't make him ride the dragon , at the very least they should make it grow up . 
  haha tell me about it . 
  that dragon need 's some meat if you ask me . 
  also , a little disclaimer ; art is not mine . 
  just googled . 
  hahahahaha wtf that image hahahahaha !!, 
  sure hope so , 'cause i 've also seen in many other games that devs fall short of the design with the character because either a ) no funding or b ) they 're lazy . 
  currently raising chancellor , guan yu , jupy and karin . 
  i like the design of the heroes and skill animations . 
  in my opinion , the best i 've ever seen from a mobile game . 
  currently have all heroes and monsters that can rank up to 6-star . 
  i love collecting the heroes . 
  sadly , rin is making it really difficult to complete my current library . 
  ** add new ` hero type ' segregation category . 
  ** for example ; i want to be able to just see all of my ` tanks ' or ` attackers ' while everything else are not shown or are grayed out . 
  for someone like me who collects each and every hero / monster that has a 6 * version , it 's a bit of a hassle whenever i need to look for a specific one in my library . 
  ** apply receive all at once in ruby tab just like in honor tab . 
  ** +1 to ts ' suggestion . 
  ** add x3 or x4 combat speed option . 
  ** depending on how fast x3 is , x4 may not be necessary . 
  there is such a thing as ` too much ' so i imagine x3 should suffice , we 'll see . 
  some skills just take too darn long even at x2 speed . 
  lastly , there are times that you just want to just down right skip the whole combat phase and just go straight to rewards if it was possible . 
  ** can receive inn 's buff at lobby screen . 
  ** +1 to ts ' suggestion . 
  most of the time i forget to get the guild buff altogether since i have to go through so many screens . 
  ** add more theme backgrounds , even those from past events . 
  ** i miss my guilty gear lobby theme and music . 
  ** collaboration with ufotable and type-moon please !, 
  ** i want to see saber , gilgamesh and archer !, 
  looks cool . 
  shame byakuya and ishida did n't make the cut tho . 
  i just remind myself that sephiroth and gabranth will eventually come in the future . 
  there 's just no reason for them not to . 
  with that mindset , i 'm able to just stick with the 250-daily pull . 
  also currently have 13 tickets on top of my 6,100 lapis . 
  i 'm a very , very patient man . 
  lol, 
  daily pull got cod ( the one i was aiming for ) and just yesterday kefka . 
   what about cloud strife ? 
  he 's okay if i get him , but i always did lean towards sephy more . 
  that and i 'm thinking they 'll only do it after the release of the vii remake . 
  i have no idea why gabranth is still is n't in the game tho and yet we already have xii characters . 
  daily half-price and 12 tickets for a total of 13 pulls . 
  no lightning . 
  did get garnet , locke and charlotte tho . 
  the azure themed costumes of bidam , black rose and da qiao . 
  my favorite color is blue and netmarble was able to hit exactly how i like my blue costumes with those . 
  pity i only use and like bidam so i only got his . 
  i wish there would be azure costumes for other heroes in the future . 
   i compel you to buy the others !, 
  ( i think they 're limited and wont be available after the sale ), 
  after seeing the future costumes that we would be getting from korea , i 've saving up my rubies for those . 
  lu bu get 's an azure costume in the future as well and it ... is ... awesome !, 
   i like blue too . 
  azure costumes look so cool, 
  they really hit the mark with these ` azure sets ' . 
  there are other costumes in-game that are also overall color blue , but these are the only ones that really attracted me . 
  +1 for diversity and flavor . 
  considering how their skills are , i 'm surprised that rachel and eileen are not fire types . 
  spike should be made into water type because if you look at his personal weapons , their damage type is magical . 
  a light / healer type sena would be a nice addition to the line-up and would complete the element circle flavor . 
  * ** passive ** : all units gain health after each turn and increase your party 's health by 2,000 . 
  ( auto regen from ff series , anyone ? ) . 
  will come back to life once if killed and will auto-cast awakening skill regardless of charge levels . 
  * ** skill 1 ** : heal entire party for x % of unit 's magic and also provides a 1-hit void shield . 
  * ** skill 2 ** : removes all debuffs from party and provides a 1-hit void shield, 
  * ** awakening ** : fully heals and also revive all dead units , remove debuffs and restore all positive buffs from the beginning of the match ( i.e. 
  soi 's or spike 's passives that only last 2 turns or so are restored and the timer on them reset ) . 
   making spike magic just because of a weapon named after him would n't make any sense . 
  he 's clearly physical based on his attacks and actual weapon . 
  ( a big-ass axe . ), 
  plus you 'd have to do that to dellons as well , and that would n't make any sense either . 
  he attacks in a very physical and brutish manner , but he would n't be the first one to use ice magic with physical attacks in a fantasy setting .
