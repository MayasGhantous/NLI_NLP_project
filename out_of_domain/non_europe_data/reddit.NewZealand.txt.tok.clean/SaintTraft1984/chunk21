  hahahaha !, 
  sweet as . 
  i 'll take it , thanks !, 
  as for the fetches , their purpose to filter out the lands for vampire nocturnus ' ability . 
  any other recommendations ? 
  when you said `` honestly , what good is a wife if she does n't understand the importance of foil tarmogoyfs ? '', 
  i had the urge to reply with `` a miserable little pile of secrets ! '', 
  he 's on the christmas list . 
  ca n't afford him yet . 
  but yeah , ideally i 'll be running about 2 sets of fetchlands . 
  oh right !, 
  forgot about them titanshift shenanigans . 
  thanks !, 
  3 would probably be the magic number . 
  thanks !, 
  interesting , would definitely help getting rid of pokers in the first few turns of the game . 
  is kefka a permanent trial or a timed event that will disappear soon ? 
  oh crap i better get to it then !, 
  yeah , been thinking of putting the caverns in the side-board instead of main . 
  control is not even that prevalent at my lgs anyways . 
  power geyser, 
  so it 's mainly truly for discipline and formal sports events . 
  was wondering how that would be useful in actual warfare . 
  i was under the impression that the longer the bow , the more powerful the shot ? 
  so that 's not the case apparently ? 
  that 's what i 'm hoping for tbh . 
  rather him than my pridemates or ascendants . 
  yeah i do . 
  it 's just i 'm looking for additional protection / removal magnets . 
  been in too many situations wherein a ) i do n't have brave the elements when i need it or b ) after i brave , they go ahead and use a second removal on hand . 
  you complain about that , while i complain about certain aoe skills that call projectiles from seemingly out of nowhere from behind . 
  ** cough orlandeau , olive , artemios cough **, 
  would be neat to get a colab event with * that * game . 
  the background music will also change into the dragonborn 's epic theme . 
  crap , now i hear it in my head again after all this years ... 
  wah dein vokul mahfaeraak ahst vaal !, 
  it would stick true to the apocalypse that i 've come to love all those years ago . 
  grinding aps and all that . 
  was viewing in a warfare setting . 
  indeed , the other comments have highlighted the main purpose of the style which makes some sense now when i look at how they do it . 
  was never really intended to be used while fighting for your life . 
  do the high jump passive ability stack ? 
  i 'm asking in regards to dragoon 's gauntlet and units that have the passive by default . 
  i hope so . 
  kain is one of my favorite characters so i 'm planning to make some sort of dh jump build in the future for him . 
  anything to make his jump worthwhile . 
  i miss the week his 5-star form was released and for a short time , he was ** the ** prime nuker outside of mages and base 5-stars . 
  oh ... i thought olive was your typical gunner . 
  did n't know she was a summoner . 
  but yeah , if i was in actual combat with orly or artemy , i 'd be all `` what is happening ?!! '', 
  whenever random projectiles come out of nowhere as back-up . 
  even more so if the battle is at an open field and i know we do n't have archers / cannons with our forces . 
  lol xd, 
  right . 
  fair enough . 
  i 'll take that excuse . 
  pretty sure it would still freak me out the first time but yeah , summoned bullets . 
  lol, 
  it will most likely be a noctis type . 
  has the potential to hit hard like firion but will mainly be used due to the support it can provide with it 's shouts . 
  oh man , i forgot all about that spell . 
  i regret selling it all those years ago . 
  would have been really perfect in today 's spot removal meta . 
  for years now , since it 's conception by conley woods , i feel i should just drop soul sisters and opt for one of those current t1 decks instead . 
  this is because of the fact that the current meta is just not friendly towards the game plan of soul sisters . 
  however , another part of me is reluctant to give it up because it was and still is my main and pet deck . 
  that one deck that i 'll have by my side to play with my childhood friends when we 're all in our 70s already . 
  maybe if i win the lottery or something , i 'd be able to go out and finally buy bant knightfall or uw spirits . 
  but until then , i 'm stuck in a love-hate relationship with my soul sisters . 
  infect and how come no one mentions knightfall ? 
  wizards ' mechanics team probably lost a lot to infect and also happen to be primarily jund players . 
  they banned probe and then prints out fatal push . 
  pretty obvious bias right there . 
  lol, 
  i love the deck . 
  i enjoy it 's interactions . 
  i enjoy the fact that lifegain can actually smash face if given the chance ( which is rare for lifegain ) . 
  however , the deck is heavily meta and match-up dependent . 
  it can just barely keep up with the current heavy removal environment . 
  every win is like free climbing a mountain . 
  a part of me wants to drop the deck all together but i 'm too deep into the relationship already . 
  i just ca n't let my girls go . 
  been playing since global launch . 
  99 % ftp ( purchased that 1.99 d package so i 'm now what another user here aptly call a ` plankton ' ) . 
  first and only base 5-star is orlandeau and i got him for 16 tickets . 
  after that , got freya ( to hell with her name 's actual spelling ) for only 2 tickets . 
  got y ` shtolla at around 500k points from a pull . 
  never got the 2nd one which was the reward at 1.2 mil ( or was it 1.7 mil ? ) . 
  latest , notable haul are 3 setzers and with them along with some luck , completed the noteworthy missions for gilgamesh and dark espers . 
  just last night i was able to complete all 4 missions for kefka event . 
  completed m1 and m2 first , followed by m4 and then m3 last . 
  i included that event in my answer because the damn thing is pretty much all about rng . 
  you 're supposed to just survive until you 're lucky enough for the right weakness you 're aiming for to appear at the right moment which is ** after ** you 've completed the mission objective . 
  so annoying . 
  but yeah , that 's pretty much my luck in a nut-shell . 
  not enough to pull noctis , luneth or the latest who is trance terra . 
  but just came at the right moment for the only base 5-star i 've been aiming for all this time ; orlandeau . 
  freya was just a bonus . 
  my next target is sephiroth or gabranth should they decide to add them in the future . 
  i hope the same kind of luck would come back to me then .
