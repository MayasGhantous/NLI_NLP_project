  still building the side-board . 
  but that 's pretty much what i 've got . 
  it 's been an hour since you posted this he still has n't replied . 
  lol i think it really ** was ** him that you played against . 
  you bully !, 
  haha been waiting for days for this now . 
  chizuru going ash williams is the best thing ever . 
  haha you ` overwhelming-stampede ' the guy 's deck is what you did lolol, 
  i do n't care what sea biologists say . . ** that . 
  not . 
  fish . 
  ** `` dive !, 
  dive !, 
  dive !, 
  dive !, 
  dive !, 
  '' ** sorry , whenever i see a submarine post in any community i have this sudden urge to shout that out . 
  any room for sun titan ? 
  would help in recycling those enchantment removals you have . 
  congrats on the rogue win !, 
  would 've been awesome to see your opponent 's faces trying to figure out what type of deck it was in the first few turns . 
  rogue decks are awesome that way . 
  currently working on and want the following real badly :, 
  * 2nd dual wield, 
  * 1st black cowl, 
  what about unmake ? 
  it 's www straight up removal with no downside . 
  mono-w soul sister player here ever since it was a standard deck back in 2011 ( ish ? ) . 
  that 's more of a win-more card . 
  would probably be useful in a 2hg game where you already start at 30 life . 
  outside of that , it 's just a win-more . 
  at 30 + life , you 're already ( or ** should ** be already ) ahead and winning with ascendants . 
  also , you might want to consider situations where you get discarded , countered and sweeped to oblivion and you have nothing else on hand except aetherflux reservoir . 
  what then ? 
  you 'll be lucky if you 're in those situations and you 're already at 50 + life , but if not ? 
  what are you going to do with that single reservoir on hand ? 
  have you considered chalice of life ? 
  it can help you with the lifegain while at the same time be a finisher for your opponent when it transforms . 
  at least in itself , you can still gain 1 life on an empty board . 
  either this , or just get a 3rd ranger of eos , or 4th pte / bolt mainboard . 
  i know !, 
   ash williams, 
  hail to the ~ ~ king ~ ~ queen , baby !, 
  geist of saint traft . 
  gathering dust in my binder because i ca n't make him competitive enough in bant boggles . 
  oh wow i just noticed now . 
  my bad . 
  got so used to seeing ascendants as auto include in most ss never expected to not see him here . 
  my opinion on aetherflux still stands thought . 
  playtest it more and let me know how it goes . 
  really interested to know . 
  alright this is getting annoying . 
  anyone else from new zealand having connection issues with the game ? 
  it 's not my internet because youtube is streaming smoothly and i can play brave exvius just fine . 
  i already bought a playset of both white and blue cartouches . 
  the first time they were revealed i knew that my boggles deck had to had them . 
  as for traft , sadly , he comes out a turn slow . 
  i mean i 've dropped him on turn-2 with a hierarche on the field but if i do n't get that starting hand , he 's really slow . 
  i 've noticed that as well . 
  but until i have extra budget to create one of those decks from scratch , traft will have to enjoy the bench a little while longer . 
  due to the limited amount of items , who 's worth getting to 6-star ? 
  * terra ( normal ), 
  * ace, 
  * 2nd exdeath, 
  ** edit : based on the comments , 2nd setzer it is ( have a total of 3 , only 1 is 6-star ) . 
  thank you all !, 
  if i was in your situation , as useful as cecil is , i would keep rerolling until i get one of the top tier 5-stars . 
  noctis being one of them . 
  the farther you get into the game , the harder it is to reroll . 
  also , cloud was recently spoiled to be coming to jp soon . 
  it 's safe to assume that sephiroth will be as well in the future . 
  it 's not a question of * will he be in the game ? * . 
  it 's more of * why not ? 
  ah really ? 
  huh , you 'd think there 'd be a little more `` noise '' at his release . 
  how is he overall ? 
  haha we ai n't that lucky and gumi ai n't ** that ** giving . 
  i have two life-time pet decks . 
  with the first one , i like gaining life especially when my opponent 's creatures are the cause of it . 
  i like how life-gain can still play an aggro game ( which is rare ) . 
  overall i just like the core game-play of the deck . 
  second deck , i like how i can just suit up a single creature without my opponent 's removal spells being able to do anything about it ( save for sac effects ) and then smashing them in the face with said creature . 
  some find the game-play of this archetype to be too simple and mind numbingly straightforward , but that 's what i like about it . 
  simple but still effective . 
  just checked his skills out .
