  very nice . 
  a little disappointed that his weapon sprite in 6-star is n't the ultima weapon though . 
  get out while you can . 
  save your money . 
  * wisdom, 
  * ability to not feel fatigue or any form of stress at all ( like not needing sleep or experiencing the physical chemical byproducts of my body when i 'm running ), 
  * ability to increase / decrease the size and girth of my dick at will, 
  at the end of the day , what people outside of your inner circle say does n't really matter . 
  you 'll find that no matter what you do , some people will find reasons to not like you simply because ** they do n't like you ** . 
  it 's not your fault , or their 's . 
  it 's just a simple case of ** incompatibility **, 
  focus only on the ones who 's opinions matter to you and are in-sync with you . 
  mom and dad ( yes , even if you do n't agree with them sometimes ) , your boyfriend / girlfriend / wife / lover , and child-hood friends that you 're still in touch and in good terms with . 
  life is easier and simpler with less drama . 
  you 'll be happier that way . 
  there 's is no absolute golden rule that states you should be friends ** with every single person that comes along your way in life ** . 
  ** question for girls ** : how do we know if you 're just being friendly or if you want something more ? 
  the first and last time i drank alcohol to really get drunk was back in college . 
  did n't repeat it again after that . 
  never did understand what was so nice about throwing up all over the place and being too intoxicated to remember all that fun you had the night before . 
  from then on , i only drank alcohol for the taste and usually when i 'm eating some really nice food ( like a porterhouse ) . 
  lately , i 've found that i like the taste of darker beers like guinness as opposed to those yellow malt ones . 
  i also found that i like the taste of ciders as well . 
  32 here and i 'm still looking . 
  good stable job atm , at least finance wise ( it pays the rent for the house ) , but i 'm still looking for that permanent job i would like to retire in . 
  last that i tried was the police , not sure if i 'll try again this september . 
  i 'm still keen for the job but their requirements for running time is what 's holding me back . 
  i 'm supposed to get 10:50 mins or under for 2.4 ks . 
  i 'm stuck in my ceiling which is hovering around 12:40 mins and my morale is at an all time low because of that . 
  while i 'm waiting to try again , i 've also submitted my application to be a corrections officer ( prison staff / guard ) . 
  still waiting on the response on that and to see what their requirements are . 
  hoping it wo n't be as cut throat as that of a police officer . 
  my original dream ( it still is ) is to become a pilot with the police job coming a close second . 
  only reason i have n't pursued the pilot career is due to financial issues . 
  it 's an expensive dream . 
  is there hope for me ? 
  thanks . 
  it 's just that , you know how some of you like to grab the arms of your guy friends a lot and then pull us close to the point we rub your side breasts ? 
  or suddenly sit on our laps randomly ? 
  i 'm trying to figure those out . 
  vexing tbh ... lol, 
  well shit ... now i 'm thinking more about it now . 
  haha thanks !, 
  play a game or just stream stuff on youtube . 
  she keeps eating my left-overs as well , even when i 'm not done with them . 
  like , i 'll drink half a cup of my coffee and next thing i 'll know she already has it on hand gulping the rest down . 
  she only does it with me , like even if our other friends have bigger portions she keeps taking my stuff . 
  like wth ... 
  haha i 'm not going to assume !, 
  last time i did that it ended so so bad and sad . 
  like , holocaust sad . 
  nah , not this time . 
  nope . 
  lol, 
  pretty sure that 's a song , just ca n't recall the name of it for the life of me . 
  damn ... 
  thursday ... ugh ... ca n't wait for the weekends . 
  tired of my job and i 'm only 3 months in . 
  clearly not for me . 
   can this be done without three exile on etb effects ? 
  i do n't know what you mean . 
  the combo can be started as early as turn-3 and with a minimum of 3 creatures : 1 soul sisters , 1 relic-warder and 1 metamorph . 
  * turn-1 : soul sister, 
  * turn-3 : phyrexian metamorph, 
  i always make it a point to open the egg case and take a quick inspection of each one to look for cracks and whatnot . 
  oh , new zealand . 
  we 're about a day into the future here i believe . 
   felidar guardian, 
  at 4 mana ? 
  and without nahiri , how are you going to make the loop ? 
  urr ... it 's alright . 
  the idea of being a day into the future is okay , i guess . 
  but sorry , still no flying cars or cyborgs . 
  right !, 
  lol ** saheeli ** . 
  i meant her . 
  haha . 
  edit : i see the combo now . 
  yeah , felidar will work as well , albeit it will be a turn slower than the metamorph . 
  truth, 
  well , it 's just that , having 1 tarmogoyf with a full graveyard and 3 death 's shadows smash your face , it kind of feels like infinite life is a good thing . 
  well , yeah , i understand where you 're coming from with that . 
  i mean , you paid for it with your hard-earned money . 
  of-course you 'll be pissed that the conditions are n't what you paid for . 
  hehe , you should tell on them to your country 's food health and safety agency . 
   you, 
  best way to describe how i 've been feeling lately . 
  32 , still have n't found that `` dream job '' that i can really be proud of and actually love . 
  thank you for asking . 
  how are you ? 
  just straight mono white build . 
  i 'm thinking of stalling the next time around so that those shadows would n't grow so big . 
  that way , my paths can be saved for the tarmos . 
  my mistake was i went aggro mode and wittled away at his life with my 1/1 sisters and spirits . 
  next thing , i 'm suddenly surrounded by 5/5 and above shadows . 
  oh and aside from your usual jund / death 's shadow decks , i 'm thinking the infinite life will also help against titan shift , eldrazi and uw spirits . 
  what do you think ? 
  wow you really ... ... made some use out of those eggs . 
  would 've just thrown them out myself and get it done and over with . 
  haha !,
