  i semi-regret pulling and blowing all of my tickets on the current dragon banner ( tried pulling for reberta , got trance terra instead which explains the ` semi ' ) . 
  looks perfect to be an island art in magic the gathering . 
  looks nice when you 're not actually in it . 
  damn ... that blue is unnerving . 
  like it 's sucking you in making you realize that you are insignificant in the grand scheme of things . 
  obvious ones :, 
  * money or a credit card that is connected to a legal account with near unlimited resources . 
  * a number of hollywood actresses that i find attractive along with a particular nude red-head artist that i like . 
  and all of them would really be into me . 
  * an item / equipment that will give me the ability to time travel . 
  sunday is okay in the first half of the day . 
  after that , the dread for the coming monday start to seep in . 
  yeah , hence semi-regretting lol . 
  44 tickets . 
  dumped 14 until i got orlandeau . 
  dumped the rest in the current banner ; only got trance terra . 
  i 'm married and even i miss physical affection . 
  fml . 
  sad . 
  hey wth man ... that laswell part is like john snow coming back from the dead . 
  nah , at this point in time , it 's all over the web so that does n't count . 
  s2 laswell on the other hand , that 's not spread out knowledge compared to got . 
  be careful what you wish for . 
  i 'm glad this banner hold 's no interest for me . 
  the current 300 lapis ticket pack pretty much drained my reserves along with the daily pulls for the dragon banner . 
  thankful for some breathing room after this week . 
  introvert . 
  not entirely anti-social . 
  if you approach me in a kind manner , i 'll reply in kind and indulge you . 
  just do n't expect me to shout across a room just to ask you how your day is . 
  depending on the situation , i can be optimistic or cynical . 
  vindictive , because i think myself to be a very nice guy . 
  not a push over that will just `` hand over his lunch money '' if demanded . 
  but if you 're drunk and knocked out on the middle of the road , i 'll pull you to the side for your safety and call an ambulance for you , even if we do n't know each other . 
  i 'm not a saint . 
  but i 'll never stab you in the back , even if you 're a dick to me . 
  however , as i said , i ** am ** vindictive , so i never forget . 
  my only beef with type-0 banners is that the bonus only applies to the units ** on ** the banner . 
  which means all type-0 units from past banners are rendered useless . 
  at the very least , they could have given past type-0 banner units the lowest bonus which is 25 % . 
  a small act of `` good-will-customer - service '' in a way . 
  alas , as expected with modern day companies ; greed prevails . 
  i just say `` haha yep '' when they call me cheap . 
  hey , i would n't have my sony tv or $ 1,000 desktop computer if i was n't cheap about everything else , thank you very much . 
  it 's called budgeting and saving . 
  lol . 
  interestingly enough , i 'm not in debt . 
  i mean i 'm jusy renting my place and i 'm not filthy rich , but hey , i 'm just happy i 'm not in debt and broke . 
  i just love it . 
  outside of whales , nobody is still going to pull on this banner unless they 're unable to resist the addictive urge . 
  that would be the common scenario , whether or not the old units have bonuses . 
  so , at the very least , a little customer courtesy would 've been nice . 
  well , this is just some wishful thinking anyways on my part . 
  * castlevania symphony of the night, 
  * most squaresoft / square-enix rpgs, 
  * mass effect trilogy, 
  * diablo series, 
  * counter-strike, 
  yeah ... only thing keeping us together is our son . 
  personally , if i have 199 of a material and another 100 + stack of that same material ; i go ahead and sell the first capped stack . 
  will the setzer cheese method work on him ? 
  the esper mission is an entirely different approach , of course , but i still want to know . 
  i 'm more concerned if it has an invulnerable threshold like the bahamut trial . 
  ` meh ' and obviously rigged so that we do n't get anything worthwhile for something that 's free . 
  yeah , sorry , i got nothing . 
  that one just went waaaay over my head . 
  if i had the extra cash , i 'd buy into a fully loaded bant knightfall . 
  it would be my very first combo deck . 
  i really find the idea behind the deck interesting and fun . 
  if i was there and that swarm came out of nowhere , i 'd naturally jerk out of surprise . 
  but once things settle down and i can clearly see what type of fish they are ( and provided they 're not fucking piranhas ) , chances are they 'd be okay with me . 
  sharks though ... excluding the whale shark , yeah , i 'd panic actually , ready my knife and swim my ass off . 
  you can never be too sure that you have a paper-cut or a small nick somewhere in your body . 
  where 's a nuke when you need one . 
  boberoch , would you recommend a line-up with the characters i have atm , please ? 
  below are the ones i have :, 
  * snow, 
  * trance terra, 
  * cloud of darkness, 
  i have other notable ones except from the recent 2 banners but yeah , those are the best i 've got . 
  what 's your recommended line-up ? 
  also , i can easily get a freyvia , noctis or orlandeau friend . 
  only noteworthy high-end tm is dual wield and blade mastery . 
  sweet , thanks !, 
  i 'll take that team and dress them up accordingly . 
  thanks !, 
  got plenty of noctis friends with decent attack , so might try this for the esper mission . 
  it is what it is . 
  they 're focusing solely on the banner units with the mindset that players will be forced to spend on it just to get those bonuses . 
  whales wo n't care and chances are would still pull . 
  ftps will have nothing to work with unless they sacrifice some dailies on hopes of at least getting the 25 % bonus unit . 
  looking at a customer quality service perspective , they could 've at least made the old type-0 units give the minimum of 25 % bonus so that there 's be a reason to use them at all . 
  a sort of `` hey , thanks for being with us still and for participating in past type-0 banners . 
  with that said , you can still make use of your old agito cadets , albeit , they wo n't give as much as the cadets on the latest banner . 
  thank you ! '', 
  excuuuuuse me , i 'm a southeast asian-er and i ** only ** throw tantrums every 4th or 5th banner , thank you very much !, 
  experienced that once . 
  went into preview mode and the moment i basic attacked with him the game crashed with some error code on the screen . 
  just glad it was n't permanent and did n't do anything to my account . 
  a bit off-topic : he seems to be pretty tall compared to the other heroes , is n't he ?
