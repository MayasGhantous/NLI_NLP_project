  i can barely complete the gilgamesh trial if i prepare for it and even then , it 's still an rng win . 
  with elt wilhelm , i can survive him just fine if i prepare for it but he still hits hard enough that i need to pay attention . 
  i 'm fine with difficult content that requires me to pay attention and not rely on the auto button . 
  i 'm ** not ** fine with difficulty wherein i get 1-shot no matter how well i prepare . 
  that 's not a challenge , that 's an annoyance . 
  i want to play this game to de-stress . 
  not to be stressed by it even further because of a few masochistic players . 
  ** edit : i 'm not angry at you op . 
  just being straight with my feelings towards what is considered `` difficult '' content . 
  i wonder when will soul sisters get a 9-0 win rate . 
  lol am i the only one who read this in the major 's voice from hellsing anime ? 
  soul sisters, 
  caffeine from coffee does n't affect me anymore . 
  if anything , it makes me even more sleepy . 
  now , i just drink coffee for the flavor . 
  however , certain energy drinks still affect me to some degree . 
  you do n't even know how you feel ... it 's adorable !, 
  my only beef with the film are the sheer amounts of ` bullet time ' shots . 
  they really abused it . 
  it was n't cool , it was distracting and easily took me out of the scenes . 
  other than that , enjoyed the film . 
  this is really interesting . 
  i was never able to finish the tower past pro . 
  was too weak . 
  i 've come a long way from then with orly now . 
  looking forward to testing golbez and his minions . 
  i want them to bring back maxwell event . 
  just so i can slap her silly and 1-hit her . 
  she gave me such a hard time before . 
  was . 
  awesome !!!!, 
  bow down before the thundergod all ye mortals !!, 
  golbez and his minions did n't stand a chance . 
  they were all like tissue paper . 
  hahahahaha !!, 
  another male archer would be nice . 
  artemios is okay but i do n't really like the whole robin hood look he has going on . 
  cupid artemios looks cooler tbh . 
  up vote for effort . 
  one of my favorite games . 
  looking forward to a collab . 
  i ca n't see a reason why they wo n't since se owns the vp franchise . 
  there should n't be any copyright problems . 
  vp , xenogears and legend of dragoon needs to be done . 
  edit : i believe `` divine assault '' is just their battle quote . 
  her actual limit should be aptly named `` nibelung valesti '' . 
  also , to stay true to vp , her limit break must have 2 different animations . 
  one with a sword and another with a bow . 
  ** get thee hence !, 
  oblivion awaits thee !, 
  soul sisters please . 
  particularly how mono-white is in modern 's current environment . 
  as sinbad said ; ** `` give that guy a raise !, 
  oh right !, 
  man , i thought all this time it was a squaresoft game . 
  my first ever base 5 * . 
  before i pulled him , i could barely do elt events at the time and most of my wins were due to rng . 
  i just want ranged units to stay where the fuck they are when they use barrage instead of having to walk up to the mob 's face in melee range to attack . 
  you 're ` ranged ' for a reason , ffs . 
  ** i 'm looking at you two ; cod and artemios . 
  just experienced a minfillia healing the party 4 times in arena . 
  yeah , i think it stacks in some way . 
  not sure which activates the multiple casting though . 
  i do n't think you 're actually supposed to be hunting / farming / aiming for it . 
  it 's supposed to be something that one day pops up in your crafting interface as ` ready to be crafted ' and will make you go * `` oh , hey , apparently i have all the mats for the ring now . '' * . 
  just play the game normally as if this ring did n't even exist and you 'll just be surprised one day that it 's ready to be crafted . 
  so ... dual wield becomes ... quadruple wield ? 
  we get to turn gilgamesh into actual 4-armed gilgamesh ? 
  now see ... this poster and i are the perfect examples of ` glass is half-full ' and ` glass is half-empty ' . 
  it 's all about perspective , really . 
  first time this happened so i 'm not really sure . 
  but yeah , good to know it 's a natural occurrence when driving a vehicle . 
  and 60 bucks just to have it patched up . 
  like ... wow ... 
  30nzd each . 
  it is what it is ... sigh ... 
  yeah . 
  cheap or expensive ? 
  would n't really know to be honest . 
  first time patching experience . 
  aw ... so cheap . 
  yeah , that 's 30 for each of my tyres here in new zealand . 
  lol, 
  do you mean a type of insurance ? 
  at the moment i only have 3rd party accident insurance . 
  if this happens again i may look into getting tyre insurance as well . 
  i 'll look into it . 
  thanks !, 
  man , owning a vehicle comes with it 's own hassles along with the convenience having one in the first place . 
  this is actually just my 2nd car so i 'm still fresh with the whole car maintenance and do-s and do n't - s. 
  mine 's a tad bit different but along the same lines at least . 
  see : my wife when she does n't notice me and does something adorable . 
  also when she does catch me ** she screams at me and throws the nearest object she can at me while laughing ** . 
  hear : rain when i do n't have to be outside . 
  ** yes !, 
  i just love hibernating under the sheets the whole day . 
  but then i realize i need to pay for bills so i have turn on ` adult-mode ' ugh ... **, 
  think of : i 'm okay with traveling . 
  for this category , i 'm more into that feeling you get knowing you 'll be able to buy something you really want this coming pay day . 
  we can actually survive without the pocket supercomputer and vaccines .
