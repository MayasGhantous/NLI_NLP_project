  got ta admit though , indoor plumbing has come a long way from medieval times . 
  i appreciate having a flush and a toilet . 
  what software ( or website ? ), 
  did you use to create that sprite ? 
  teach me , master . 
  valid point . 
  forgot about that . 
  i use either a spoon or just crush the cheetos so that i can just raise the bag and ` drink it ' . 
  it 's from a magic the gathering gaming card . 
  edit : yes , i 'm a nerd . 
  but a fit looking nerd ( run and regularly goes to gym ) , thank you very much . 
  oh wow ... you just gave me an idea ... hahahaha thanks !, 
  will the setzer cheese work on these guys ? 
  i felt that when i gave up white rice and opted for brown rice . 
  it 's the craving and longing for something you 've loved taking all these years but suddenly had to give up . 
  for me , it passed after a month of just sticking to brown rice . 
  however , it may take longer for you since you 're giving up a lot of what you 've had in your diet most of your life . 
  i 'm all for animal rights and all that , but when it comes to chicken , beef , pork and fish ; all 's fair in my book . 
  we eat them while sharks and lions eat us . 
  it 's called the food chain . 
  i believe more in consuming the right amount of food for a proper and balanced diet . 
  sugar included . 
  but hey , that 's just my point of view . 
  if going vegan will make you happy and fulfilled as a human being , by all means , go for it and good luck !, 
  thanks !, 
  i 'll crush you !, 
  they have * control issues * ... 
  the very last mission of the event is the one where i had to actually sit up straight and pay attention . 
  the bosses where easy enough , however , their missions where the a little tricky for me considering my party at the time . 
  i had to kill one boss with a limit break and the other , arachnea , with an esper . 
  my party consisted of cecil , freyvia , orlandeau , sakura , yshtola and friend orlandeau . 
  so , you can imagine , i had to make sure if i killed the limit break mission boss , that i would n't also kill the esper kill one . 
  edit : i had to go back a second time for the 5-man party mission . 
  same , still ` removed ' for me as well . 
  magic the gathering . 
  well , it depends i guess if you want to be competitive . 
  a single piece of cardboard can be as cheap as $ 1 or go as high as $ 150 . 
  i wonder if astronauts watch sci-fi space films . 
  because if they saw life , they would n't be bringing stuff like that into space to experiment on . 
  god forbid they poke it with a shock stick . 
  i do n't really understand the selfish mindset of companies nowadays . 
  `` unfortunately you do n't have the right amount of experience for us to hire you . '', 
  `` yeah , thats because you wo n't hire me . 
  how am i able to acquire that amount of experience you want if you and the next company wo n't hire me . '', 
  the system is fucking psychotic !, 
  when i realised in a few months time that my deck would be near worthless ( like i would n't even be able to make back the amount i spent on it if i sell it , unlike in modern ) . 
  standard is a cash grab . 
   1500000018 adventurer +4, 
  boost atk , def , mag and spr by 40 %, 
  yeah ... i bet it 's going to cost an arm and a leg to craft even just one of that . 
  that too . 
  considering our current power level , this thing might just break the game if they release it this early on . 
  if that 's the cost then it should be giving 80 % boost . 
  naturally , she does n't know i feel this way . 
  i just smile and try to be optimistic ( i mean really , it 's the least i could do ) . 
  32 years old and i still do n't know where i should be . 
  just recently i tried applying for the role of police communicator / emergency line ; that crash and burned . 
  i 'm looking into pilot / aviation courses but then they cost an arm and a leg . 
  trying to join the police force itself but i ca n't seem to improve my running . 
  i 'm fit for an average joe ( no beer belly and whatnot ) but my running is n't improving at all . 
  i dunno ... stuff is really is n't going anywhere for me ... 
  i 'm happy for you and your partner . 
  you two seem to have it going pretty well for yourselves . 
  i 'd go back to uni , definitely . 
  bills and having a child have made it difficult to just do ** whatever one desires ** , regrettably . 
  and do n't get me wrong , our son was conceived in our late 25s , which is the usual right age to start a family . 
  but i still have n't figured out where i 'm supposed to be in this world . 
  that 's why she does n't know what my feelings are about everything at the moment . 
  i 'm just on ` smile-and-wave ' mode . 
  it 's the least i can do since i 'm not the breadwinner ; just shut the fuck up and pay the rent . 
  i really do n't know where the universe wants me to be . 
  i mean , i 'm keen on helping people ( naturally i ca n't always be in charity , bills need paying regrettably ) and a police officer 's role attracted me but man , this is hard af . 
  to get what you really want , i mean . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm ** am ** trying , at the very least . 
  she really deserves the promotion anyways . 
  she 's a hard worker , very professional and smart ( ca n't be that smart if she married my broke ass , i know lol ) . 
  with the amount it requires to go pro ? 
  especially since i 'm already earning barely . 
  see , our set-up is this ; so long as i 'm able to pay the rent and pitch in in groceries when needed and also save a little -- ** i am free to purchase whatever i want with the leftovers ** . 
  so , because of that , i 'm able to at least play mtg occasionally . 
  but nah , nothing extravagant or going all in . 
   er tech, 
  i 'll look into it , thank you !, 
  considering everything i 've said ; i 'm just willing to try anything at this point that will bring me closer to that dream job . 
  oh god no . 
  no animosity . 
  if anything , sheer humility for being with me and at the same time just in awe of her skill as a human being . 
  she 's really something , man , i do n't deserve her . 
  it 's my one distraction when i get down like this . 
  thanks , yeah , i 'll remember that . 
  only started collecting back in the old days 7th ed etc but i did n't know how to play . 
  mother was extremely religious back then ( i love her dearly ) so she burned my cards . 
  went on a long hiatus . 
  came back in scars of mirrodin and i 've been playing ever since . 
  stuck with modern though . 
  realized that standard is a cash grab . 
  nothing fancy . 
  just mono white soul sisters ( see ? 
  told you i did n't have enough money to go pro lol ) .
