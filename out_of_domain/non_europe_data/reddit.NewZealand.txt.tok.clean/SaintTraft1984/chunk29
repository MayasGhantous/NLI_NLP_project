  what 's your legacy deck ? 
  that 's the plan , actually . 
  this recent promotion should bring in some much needed extra resources . 
  we 'll see once the bills settle down on how much leftover we can spare for my career hunting . 
  i will definitely try . 
  it 's the least that i can do for her ; * try * . 
  sorry , coming from another male , him being upset is more towards himself and the feeling of inadequacy ( at least it is that way in my case ) . 
  interestingly enough , i enjoy doing the dishes and cleaning the house ( when i feel like it lol you know us guys ; when we say we 'll fix it , ** we 'll fix it ** ) . 
  i can cook but the recipes i know are still limited and she still does most of the cooking . 
  it 's hard , is n't it ? 
  sometimes you get that ` feeling ' and you think to yourself `` am i just free-loading now ? 
  yeah , it dawned on me after having our son ( i love him dearly ) that , unless you 're some millionaire , you 're going to have to sacrifice family or career . 
  thanks wheatforsheep . 
  helps a lot . 
  i 'll keep grinding , of-course , until i get that job that i can really hold my head up high in . 
  yeah , i 'm just thankful that i do n't smoke or drink heavily . 
  i have some minor hobbies on the side , which my partner actually insists on supporting but i say `` no . 
  save your money . 
  i 'll use what little leftover i have to feed this hobby of mine . 
  i do n't want you spending on these things just for me . 
  i appreciate the gesture , but no . '', 
  1 daily , 1 4 * ticket and my very first 10 +1 pull ; i got tilith . 
  i 'm done with pulling . 
  time to save again . 
  oh shit that ramza . 
  lol !, 
  gratz !, 
  haha :d, 
  yeah , i 'm hanging-in there . 
  just keep grinding i suppose . 
   c25k, 
  just googled that now . 
  first time i 've heard of it . 
  my problem stems in the fact that it 's currently winter here . 
  so , it 's a bit difficult to push myelf out the front door . 
  but once i get through that and my adrenaline starts pumping , i 'm good to go . 
  what 's wrong ? 
  why is she pissed all the time ? 
  i mean , not everyone can get a masters and she seems to be well on her way . 
  oh yeah , i 'd go crazy if i did n't have anything to distract me from all of it . 
  ew ... emrakul on turn 4 . 
  that 's not nice . 
  i 'll try to remind myself of what you said whenever i start feeling this down again . 
  i appreciate it . 
  hey , at least you got ramza for your troubles . 
  from what i see , he 'll be one of the key units in the future . 
  so , with 6-star maxwell available ; what type of build should she ( it ? ), 
  i currently have her at 400 + atk with gungnir , black bandanna , great mage 's robe , x2 domination ring and x4 follower 's oath . 
  so she ** is ** physical . 
  yeah i was just concerned if she 's maybe hybrid or magical . 
  thanks !, 
  instead of boosting her mp , i gave her status protection against petrify , paralyze and confuse . 
  we do n't need to worry about her being silenced since her useful skills are all ability types . 
  i * am * concerned , though , about her really low health pool . 
  like it 's really bad , even with all the hp +15 % materias on her , it 's still bad . 
  ah no , it 's not that , it 's just i have her set-up as my companion unit for the bonus so i figured , i should at least make her a little useful . 
  oh noted . 
  so i guess it 's just used for the hit count in chains . 
  i 'd get it even if i do n't have him . 
  it 's exclusive to this event only so it 'll be a long time before you see it again . 
  i say get it , especially because you have him already . 
  sweet , thanks !, 
  ribbon for tilith . 
  the downside to her compared to refia is that she does n't have status protection for anything . 
  unless you have 3 orldandeaus or freyvias , that 3rd dual wield might be redundant for you . 
  i 'd get the ribbon for tilith . 
  turn 1 ... wtf that is so not fun to be at the receiving end of it hahaha !, 
  god we 're so old . 
  lol, 
  i can imagine so . 
  i experienced piloting a ur eldrazi ramp deck in modern back before eye of ugin was banned . 
  even if it was a hard-casted emrakul it was still very satisfying . 
  haha pretty sure your deck is a very one-sided bad match for my soul sisters . 
  i mean , even if my ss is already fully decked out with all the key pieces ; it just wo n't make a dent . 
  control has always been it 's worse match-up . 
  it 's twice as worse if it 's control legacy . 
  they 're okay when you understand them, 
  confusion tends to ensue most of the time though, 
  screw this, 
  same kind of christian here . 
  i have to admit though , i like the architecture of catholic churches and the uniform of their priests . 
  deuteragonist . 
  the `` rival '' kind but not an antagonists and overall still one of the `` good guys '' . 
  think protoman from megaman series . 
  yeah , when it came to style and ` fashion ' ; the catholic church pretty much nailed it ( sorry for the pun ) . 
  try to find out what species they are . 
  check with your local exterminator if they 're safe . 
  also , how frequent are the encounters ? 
  like everyday ? 
  every single week ? 
  if it 's one of those , that 's too frequent . 
  there might be a nest nearby , may want to hire someone to permanently deal with that . 
  well , it 's a basement so it 's cool so they like that . 
  plus , from the way you described the rate of encounters , it 's pretty obvious they laid their eggs somewhere there . 
  get a thermo-nuclear device if you can . 
  i feel bad more about the money i sunk into this game but never really went anywhere . 
  32 years old , father to a 6 year old . 
  the only time i would be like this to my son is if `` something happened '' . 
  so , did anything of note , happen in the past that would make them hover that much around you ? 
  are you female and an only child ?
