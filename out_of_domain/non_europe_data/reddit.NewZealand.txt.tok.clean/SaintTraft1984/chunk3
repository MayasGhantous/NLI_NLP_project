  lore wise , it would fit him in a way since his mother is that lania , the ice queen boss at stage 6 , right ? 
  she 's clearly a sort of ` ice mage ' . 
  as for dellons , is n't he already a physical damage type and also fire type ? 
  * ** fire ** : jupy and soi . 
  * ** dark ** : ace . 
  raising him to 40 . 
  been getting him from the puzzle . 
  * ** light ** : recently got karin to 40 . 
  will probably start on karon since he 's a staple in my raid team 1 . 
  * ** water ** : non at the moment . 
  just using the excess that i have to rank up any of my 5 \u2605 water heroes . 
  * ** earth ** : currently raising ramlethal since i got spammed by her during the colab event . 
  she 's eating up space in my inventory . 
  will focus on rudy should i get him anytime before the free 7k monthly ticket . 
  hahaha !, 
  thanks for the laugh . 
  the way they 've handled this puzzle feature has me disappointed as well . 
  they 're clearly forcing us to spend our rubies just for those damn puzzle pieces by making sure their natural drop rates in the maps are nerfed . 
  even worse is that not all selectors will work . 
  back in velika meta , when global was still ` young ' , puzzle pieces like nox or bane kept dropping like they were pooki . 
  now , they never appear even when it 's hero drop rate hot time . 
  now , i do n't mind being forced to spend my rubies but personally , i 'm saving them for the mini-board and also future costumes . 
  so yeah , i 'm a little ticked off that even this damn puzzle game was n't spared from their greed . 
  playing on global and this started only today . 
  in fact , it was n't like this the whole day , for me it only started this evening around 22:00 auckland time . 
  no , i 'm not downloading anything , though i am streaming youtube . 
  but then again , this has never happened before on both my desktop ( bluestacks ) or my phone , regardless if i was streaming or downloading . 
  ~ i guess i 'll just play another game . 
  that 's why i toggle between seven knights and final fantasy brave exvius :p, 
  just another hero to add to my collection . 
  lynxlok94 pretty much gave excellent suggestions . 
  so , i 'll just add that you might want to raise a hellena . 
  she 's a decent tank when you 're just starting out , at least until you get rudy . 
  but the real reason you want to get her to 6 \u2605 is because she will be part of your ` grinding team ' . 
  that team will be solely responsible for leveling units and hellena 's taunt skill will be invaluable in keeping your low levels alive . 
  lastly , she has an awakened form in the future . 
  experienced the same thing . 
  however , i was able to change my password . 
  now , i 'm able to `` log-in '' somewhat in-game but the game tells me that the ` account is locked ( 1005 ) ' . 
  i 'm also unable to send a support ticket to them . 
  i received the e-mail from eyedentity . 
  tried logging-in to the website but i kept getting incorrect password . 
  so , i went and changed it . 
  change was successful but i 'm still unable to log-in on the site and if i try the new password in-game , it says ` account locked ' . 
  thanks , coranis . 
  yeah i stayed away from the website and game for about two days and then tried it again . 
  i was successful this time . 
  thank you . 
  thank you . 
  * ** gatcha hot time heroes drop rate is a joke ** - the rates are so bad compared to other games of this type that it 's blatantly obvious that they 're being greedy . 
  and no , that cliche ` it 's business . ', 
  is not an excuse . 
  final fantasy brave exvius has a gatcha system but you know what , their rates are not as bad / greedy as nm 's is atm . 
  * ** slow content release ** - i do n't understand why we still have n't at least gotten the updated sprites in korea . 
  it 's not like the sprites have any effect on actual battle statistics , however , it 's still annoying that we 've received revamp after revamp of some heroes where nm could have easily included the new sprites but they did n't . 
  also , that 1-entrance-per-day in abyss tower is a joke , really . 
  and not a funny one at that . 
  * ** manual mode in arena ** - since nm is giving the latest heroes and lords to new players and screwing us veterans over , can they at least give us full manual control in arena ? 
  screw rng or so called `` balance '' it 's obvious that nm does n't know the meaning of the word . 
  it 's not like pvp is in real time anyways . 
  we 're still just fighting against the ai . 
  and no , i do n't need to `` git gud '' . 
  you 're just in denial to the problems that are currently plaguing global . 
  * ** why collecting rubies and tickets still ca n't be done in one go like friend points ** - you know nm , it 's obvious that you 're saving those features just so you can say that you have a `` new update '' . 
  just stop . 
  gawd those hips . 
  daily pull : 3 \u2605 mustadio, 
  notable ones that i 've been aiming for since their release :, 
  * lightning, 
  * delita, 
  * exdeath, 
  * fencer, 
  * roselia, 
  * agrias, 
  remember the time when you use the first skill in arena and when it was able to kill ruri or velika in 1-hit it already feels like you 've won the match ? 
  i remember always whispering to myself `` come on , come on kill her !, 
  1-hit now ! '', 
  lol, 
  i still have 1 last mastery to purchase and it 'll cost me 1,100 rubies alone . 
  my ace is also currently just lvl .36 while my teo and lubu are both measly lvl .30 s. 
  the costumes , masteries and chess-game are my only ruby sinks . 
  after spending just 2,000 rubies one time in trying my luck with getting teo in the gatcha pulls , which did n't get me anything at all , i 've decided then and there that i will never again do a gatcha pull unless there 's a 100 % guarantee that you get something worthwhile ( like the guilty gear colab which guaranteed that you at least got a gg hero even though it was still random on who it was ) . 
  currently , i only purchase ** may 's lucky box ** and ** may 's lucky calendar ** . 
  i feel those are the only cheap ones wherein you get more ` bang-for-your-buck ' . 
  the other offers are just way too expensive for what they get you . 
  * shudder * all too well ... 
  ugh ... i just want full manual control for the arena . 
  what part of that ca n't they understand ? 
  with how the pvp is on full-ai-auto-mode at the moment , no one will actually stay to watch the matches in this ares cup . 
  will just get in , leave it in spectate mode then switch to watching netflix to pass the time . 
  ugh ... what is up with these nm people ? 
  there 's you and sorrydoor . 
  so far there 's two of you lol . 
  i ca n't wait for the new look . 
  it should 've come along with the recent revamps they 've made but i guess they 're saving it for an event or for when awakening gets to global . 
   dawn of sorrow . 
  then aos , por , ooe , cotm , and finally sotn . 
  that explains it . 
  sotn pretty much set the ` new base metroidvania formula ' for those sequels that you played . 
  they improved on what sotn started on so it kind of makes sense why sotn might have felt ... ` underwhelming ( ? ) ',
