  as a father i imagine i would react in a similar way if i had a daughter . 
  already am . 
  final straw was when they released gatcha costumes awhile back . 
  that showed how greed have taken over them . 
  being an only child alone will tend to cause the ` over-protective ' syndrome on us parents to rear it 's head . 
  the idea of something bad happening to your well-being or you getting mixed in with the ` wrong crowd ' would be the primary things that would shoot through our minds . 
  that and , like i asked ; did something happen in the past that would make them borderline distrust you ? 
  you do n't need to answer that , just wanted to put the possibility of that question up there . 
  edit : at the end of the day ; try to look at it positively -- * they care enough to hover over you * . 
  meaning whatever you do , and wherever you are , it affects them in some way . 
  they ** notice ** it . 
  some parents do n't . 
  yeah ... no . 
  re-roll , brother . 
  the fact that you do n't seem to have a base 5 * is a good enough reason to do so . 
  purchasing those bundles pretty much just solidified that you ** should ** re-roll . 
  i know , it 'll be a hassle to go through tutorial again and whatnot ; but trust this community -- it 's worth it . 
  * good * base 5 * start units are ** that ** game-changing . 
  umm . . unlike raid exclusive units ; wol and garland will have roughly similar materials like other 6 * units in the game . 
  those are purchased or dropped from events like the current mog king one . 
  if you really need to know the specific materials , go visit the gl wikia . 
  it 'll be listed in their respective unit pages . 
  this . 
  i mean firion is good but since you 'll have a shot at the possibility of acquiring a better one , might as well wait and save those enhancement materials . 
  do killer passives on accs stack with materia and esper ones ? 
  oooooh ... i feel tingly all over suddenly . 
  the gl wiki will have a unit ranking page to help you with that . 
  but off the top of my head , good ones to stick with are :, 
  * dark fina, 
  * olive, 
  * reberta, 
  my mistake . 
  even if they have the same generic 6 * mats , they wo n't be shown properly on the wiki due to their 6 * forms not being available yet . 
  so , just recently purchased birthright . 
  i know , i 'm late for the party . 
  i 'm having trouble in purchasing the dlcs that cost 0.00 even though i still have 1.50 in my account . 
  am i missing something ? 
  i click anywhere and everywhere and there 's just no ` buy ' button that i can click . 
  wow , before i found out about his tm i was all like `` ugh ... a panda ? 
  really ? 
  lame ... '' . 
  is it confirmed that it does n't stack , though ? 
  i need to know if i 'll just feed clones to him or keep at least 4 of him . 
  i see , thanks for the answer !, 
  i never got her so she does n't exist in my book . 
  yes , i go to dg , `` purchase dlc '' but then i can only click on the dlcs to see what 's in them . 
  but no other `` buy '' or `` purchase '' button shows up . 
  i try clicking anywhere else on the screen but nothing . 
  it 's like , i ca n't buy them or something . 
  just window-browse . 
  this is actually how i got orlandeau , the one unit i was saving my tickets for all this time . 
  i semi-quit before his banner , just logging in to collect dailies then logging out immediately . 
  only when his banner came in that i went all-in with my tickts . 
  used up 27 tickets to get him . 
  then and there my vigor was renewed and i 'm now full-time playing again . 
  so , what i 'm trying to say is , keep it up . 
  do n't quit fully . 
  just log-in , get the daily gifts , then leave it at that . 
  you never know when you 'll catch a break eventually . 
  yes , i have those . 
  do you think it 's because i only have 1.50 ? 
  but why should it matter if the ones i want to purchase are 0.00 ? 
  there 's a magical sphere in there that will enable you to summon king arthur and the knights of the round table but you need a special kind of bird that can fly , walk on water and climb mountains to get there . 
  goooo planet !, 
  so , i have orlandeau and freyvia as my main dps team . 
  with that said , is firion worth awakening ? 
  i 'm seeing all these reviews and break-downs with regards to his awakened skills how they 're worth it but still very expensive . 
  is he just another ` win-more ' in my case or truly game changing ? 
  because , atm , i 'm trying to save materials for orly 's awakening . 
  that 's the way to go . 
  i know it 's highly unlikely but it just feels like the game somehow rewards us for not pulling for a long time when saving tickets . 
  as for what to save for , try to check the unreleased units list on the wikia . 
  see if anyone fits your fancy . 
  currently , saving for rikku next then ashe . 
  they 're all max 6 * already . 
  which is why i 'm curious if firion will just end up only adding a little to the total damage . 
  okay , yeah , i was able to buy them . 
  ` e-purchase ' is ** the ** ` buy ' button . 
  lol am such a noob with these things sometimes . 
  so the key is utilizing firion 's killers to full . 
  got it , thanks !, 
  i 'll stick to saving for orlandeau then . 
  or a format where soul sisters can actually compete competitively in and put out some good results . 
  if you 're going to shout it , do it right . 
  ** `` exu-calipooooooooooooooo !!!!, 
  ... baka, 
  well , they have n't released any of the type-0 villains yet , so ... . . 
  you could just go with a chick . 
  i mean , it 's still chicken , just tiny with barely anything on it to nibble on . 
  haha alrighty then . 
  go for it !, 
  enjoy !, 
  she ... feels really fragile tbh . 
  that def and hp of her 's are horrendous . 
  do n't really see the hype for her . 
  got her for one daily , one 4 * ticket and one 10 +1 . 
  got her on the 10 +1 . 
  considering how slow that thing is , yeah , those 3 ninja toads will wipe the floor with him . 
  i 'm fine going against death 's shadow . 
  it 's that fucking fatal push that should be banned .
