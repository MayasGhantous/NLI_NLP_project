  stupid removal pretty much made life harder for soul sisters ; it was already a tough climb to begin with . 
  well shit , infect just got hosed even more . 
  i tend to look at the best in people . 
  so , even if you 're an asshole or a bitch to me , it 's going to take a while to really piss me off . 
  i 'm patient that way . 
  could it be time for wizards to stop buffing jund colors ? 
  i 've learned to accept that no matter how nice or giving you are , there will always be one person or two that wo n't like you simply because * they do n't like you * . 
  most of the time if you confront them about it they ca n't even explain why they feel that way about you . 
  so instead of letting those kind of people take control of my state of mind , i ignore them and focus my attention on the ones who like me for who i am . 
  like litterally my face becomes the poker face emoticon when those toxic people try to get something out of me . 
  and they get annoyed even more lol . 
  coz it gets all awkward when we end up just staring at each other and eventually they give up and walk away hahahaha !, 
  i still get angry at certain situations , though . 
  off the top of my head , drivers suddenly turning without indicating really pisses me off and makes me drop a really loud and crispy f-bomb . 
  that i 'm `` iffy '' on the swimming part . 
  i can float on my back and freestyle just fine but my treading is for shit . 
  ramza for his buffs . 
  gilgamesh or luneth for their tms . 
  ah , i see where she 's coming from now . 
  base on what she 's going through , might want to treat her to dinner / date every week . 
  like , make it a standard schedule . 
  or , depending on her personality , might want to just let her sleep-in 1 whole day per week to charge up . 
  on that one day , you do everything for her . 
  her only ` job ' on that day is to stay in bed . 
  but like i said , it depends on her personality . 
  some people get recharged with just staying in bed all day while others find a whole day outdoors at the park more gratifying . 
  its weird , i can free style and float on my back just fine . 
  it 's treading / floating upright that i 'm having difficulty with . 
  i only have the mono white version that does n't run hawks or martyr , but instead runs a playset of archangels . 
  have n't experienced smuggler 's copter myself but even i think it may not be a good idea . 
  it costs 2 , requires at least creature on the field for it to attack and it 's not a creature itself so it wo n't trigger your lifegain when it enters the field . 
  i dunno , i do n't like it . 
  the cost is n't the main thing i have an issue with , it 's the fact that it 's not a creature . 
  have you tried testing it at your local shop ? 
  i 'm thinking maybe just a 3 or even a 2 of . 
  as nice tasting as these desserts are , i never did like the concept of putting some of the stuff ** outside ** of the glass . 
  so messy and a hassle . 
  i 'll eat all of that , just put them all ** inside ** the glass , please . 
  resisting the urge to pull . 
  even dailies . 
  i like how you think . 
  lol, 
  are those moogles guaranteed ? 
  would n't the plural of ` noctis ' be ` nocti ' ? 
  so is anyone else constantly crashing with the latest gronoa story arc ? 
  the game crashes every single time the main story character battles begin . 
  i 'm able to go through the cut-scenes , but after a turn or 2 , the battle crashes . 
  it 's been like this since the first battle between sakura and rain . 
  i 'm only able to go through the battle after i 've relaunched the game . 
  so the order goes cut-scene  battle  crash  relaunch  finish battle , every time . 
  thanks . 
  i 'll try anything at this point . 
  i can still play the game as is , it 's just a bit of a chore to go through these specific battles . 
  right !, 
  forgot about it being used as a name . 
  the king mog one sometimes happen to me . 
  the most frequent are the story duels . 
  i can get through the cut-scenes just fine , it 's when the actual battles start that i crash . 
  i need to re-launch the game just to be able to continue the duel and finish it . 
  i play on my android phone . 
  i 'm also experiencing this . 
  already used ` restore ' feature twice . 
  all settings on low . 
  deleted a bunch of updates from apps i never used , even default apps . 
  clear cached as well . 
  playing on a samsung sj1 . 
  consistently the game crashes right after the lakshmi intro cutscene . 
  even when i skip it , it crashes always at that point . 
  i 'm convinced that i wo n't be able to acquire lakshmi until they fix whatever 's causing this . 
  suggested this myself awhile back when i was still new to the game and this reddit . 
  i remember someone mentioning that the gatcha laws in japan , which is the origin of the game , does not allow such features . 
  forgot the exact specifics of it but yeah , there are laws limiting / preventing it 's application . 
  ** 10 +1 ticket ** : only worthwhile unit i got is rikku, 
  ** guaranteed 5-star ** : fohlen , ilias and my 2nd orlandeau, 
  really bad timing then because my computer died on me just last month . 
  it 's not so bad , had it and used it everyday for 7 years ( going on 8 , i think ) . 
  is lakshmi that much of a game changer ? 
  or is it okay that i do n't have her for now ? 
  the collector in me is really annoyed , though . 
  ah , just read through the entire thing now . 
  i admit , i only read the tldr part . 
  as for op 's question ; it is possible , is n't it ? 
  but depending on the content he 's trying to do , he may require specific tms and a certain number of each . 
  fohlen , ilias and 2nd orlandeau, 
  got her on the 10 +1 ticket . 
  was ready to blow all my tickets but then that happened so uhhh ... what now ? 
  lol, 
  highly nostalgic . 
  gave me that urge of wanting to play ffx one more time . 
  but then i was also reminded of that god awful chocobo mini-game so yeah , hard pass for me lol . 
  free 10 +1 ticket : rikku, 
  anniversary guaranteed 5-star : fohlen , ilias and 2nd orlandeau, 
  got rikku on the 10 +1 ticket . 
  it 's ramza that i was hoping for in the guaranteed 5-star . 
  game gave me fohlen , ilias and 2nd orlandeau . 
  3 rikkus ... lmao and * you 're disappointed * xd, 
  delita 's break is useful enough and having more than 1 chizuru can help in chaining . 
  still , i feel your pain ... hang in there ... 
  you 're pretty much set for life with that 1-tko team ready to go . 
  i just got my 2nd orly today myself .
