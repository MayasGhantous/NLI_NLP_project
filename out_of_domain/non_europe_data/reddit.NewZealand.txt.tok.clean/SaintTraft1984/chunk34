  my biggest hurdle is the endurance-running quest . 
  i seem to have reached the max cap for my sta . 
  i have spare points to put into it but it 's hit the `` ceiling '' already . 
  press-ups are so far going well ; ** if ** i 'm not tired . 
  alas , the quest giver will make me ** run first ** and then do the press-ups immediately after . 
  it 's crazy . 
  not really , i suppose . 
  just anxious about these things . 
  oh yeah i have n't been here long enough to even build bridges , to be honest . 
  only been her for 4 months going on to the 5th . 
  thanks . 
  straight and simple . 
  i see where you 're coming from . 
  yeah , makes sense . 
  can someone explain in layman 's terms the whole process of rerolling ? 
  i 'm trying to reroll a new account on the wife 's phone . 
  i did not connect her fb to it and just went ahead and started a new game , then , i uninstalled brave exvius in hopes of rerolling . 
  however , when i re-installed the game , the same data is still there and i ca n't re-roll into a new game anymore . 
  yeah , saw that . 
  does n't really help me . 
  from what i understand ; ** do i need to create a new fb account for each time i reroll ? 
  haha no i appreciate it !, 
  thank you !, 
  thank you good sir . 
  yeah , i know , sometimes i 'm the kind of person who reads `` the idiot 's guide to ... '' books . 
  so yeah , essentially an idiot . 
  i highly doubt that gumi would spend resources on this but :, 
  ** design more unique attack animations for skills . 
  especially ones that are really powerful and full of flavor . 
  an example would be orlandeau 's divine ruination skill ; those fireballs come out of nowhere . 
  would prefer to have an animation where orlandeau raises his sword into the air , charges it then jumps and points it downward , after which , the fireballs comes out of his sword like lasers . 
  ** next up , make ranged units not move from their spot whenever they would do a normal attack , barrage or another kind of skill that uses their basic attack animation . 
  example would be artemios and cod using barrage ; the fuck are you two doing going right up in the face of your targets ? 
  what the hell are you ranged for , then ? 
  defianthermit , can you show me the attack animation of lunera 's unique skills ? 
  i think that will decide on whether or not i aim to get her . 
  only with particular skills . 
  not all of them . 
  as for units like king ; him not going up the face of his targets for his basic or barrage attack would cut off some micro-seconds of his attack animation . 
  it 's still something at least . 
  another skill that lacks in proper animation would be tidus ' energy blast aoe . 
  as i recall , he jumped into the air and fired the enegy bolts from his sword . 
  for ffbe , he just raises his hand like any other spell and the projectiles materalizes out of nowhere from behind him . 
  such a shame really , that jump into the air part of the attack gave it more flavor and a unique aspect to it . 
  like , seeing that move done by anyone else , you 'd know they got it from tidus . 
  obviously , `` hey , soul sister '' by train . 
  welp , looks like my luck finally ran out . 
  after giving me 2 orlandeau , 1 freyvia , 1 fohlen , 1 zargasomethinghisname , 1 ashe , 1 rikku and 1 tilith these past months , the game finally said to me ; ** no more . 
  enough !! ** . 
  used my last 5,000 lapis and all the tickets i had for a shot at lunera ( cause i love archers and elves ) and i could n't even get her husband as a consolation pull . 
  only helena and ruggles for all of that . 
  meh , my lucky run was nice while it lasted . 
  here 's to hoping it comes back again when sephiroth or the ff8 crew arrives in the future . 
  good luck to everyone else who are trying to test fate with this banner !, 
  thanks !, 
  was going for about 10 % brag and 90 % humble . 
  did i hit the ratio right ? 
  goddamn it , redditing is hard . 
  my god , i ca n't wait to see mrs. 
  incredible again !, 
  not bad , not bad at all . 
  it 's interesting that you have the husbands but the wives are nowhere to be seen . 
  lol, 
  35 5 * bases ... croist no wonder ... 
  i 'll admit , their sad story really got to me . 
  which is a suprise , considering it 's from a mobile game . 
  damn ... pretty sure it 's expensive to have that kind of teeth . 
  sigh ... 
  gumi has a very weird understanding of what 80 % , 90 % and 100 % means . 
  just a dolphin myself , 1 10 +1 pull , 8 tickets later ; all i got was my 2nd snow . 
  i never even used my first one . 
  i was hoping to at least get lunera 's husband , bran , but he is a fucking tease . 
  only ended up getting the montana fan-girl and gimli . 
  it 's just a fun deck . 
  build it for fun casual games at your kitchen counter but do n't even bother taking it to a gp level event or any tourney for that matter which requires you to pay for an entry fee . 
  calling it now , there 's an ice-based boss living in there which drops a rare ice-based weapon . 
   ` warrior of light ' is just a title given to the character and his true identity is unknown . 
  for all we know his name could be john . 
  he looks more like a ` bob ' to me , do n't you think ? 
  10 % tm moogles are always worth it . 
  except for the ones sold by the chocobo , though . 
  it 's fine to only keep one of each of those . 
  cannibalize the rest . 
  example of units that are useful to have more than one , for chaining purposes , are :, 
  * edgar, 
  * exdeath, 
  * most of the base 5-stars dps units, 
  cyan 's tm is evade , i believe . 
  it 's worth having more than one , definitely . 
  but unless you use macros for farming tms , might as well just keep one . 
  it 's useful , but it 's definitely not a priority when it comes to feeding moogles . 
  edit : you 'll always get more cyans in your pulls . 
  he 's not as frequent as shadow but he does show up regularly . 
  maxed out orlandeau the moment i pulled him . 
  even his lb . 
  only 2 things are not maxed out for him and that is his mag and his tm . 
  looking to max those soon . 
  but then i 'd rather they enable killers to work with jump . 
  otherwise , 6 \u2606 kain will still be pointless . 
  still trying to get her .
