  live life first . 
  games ( any game ) should always be secondary . 
  never really did understand the concept of putting stuff outside of the mug or glass . 
  like , wtf , put it all inside so that it wo n't be messy . 
  chill , they usually have paper plates ready on the side . 
  this is just how it 's presented . 
  writers and director : `` alright !, 
  for this episode 's epic ending , we 'll have all 3 of her dragons pawn the lannister army !, 
  budget team : `` excuse me , ahem , sorry but we can only afford to have either 1 dragon for the entire scene or all 3 dragons for half the screen time . 
  and no , we ca n't make them dodge the arrows or the ballista bolt like how toothless moves in how to train your dragon . 
  you have any idea how much more that would cost us ?! '', 
  the movie about an op bow that shoots straight and it 's arrows all fly side-by-side even when not fired at the exact same time . 
  god i want her to hip-check me so bad ... ** in the face ** . 
  tsk !, 
  beat me to it ... 
  for a second i could n't get it since it looks like a communication tower or something . 
  still , it 's a nice wallpaper . 
  battle of char . 
  get it ? 
  ** char ** . 
  ... okay i 'll let myself out . 
  is n't there an actual real life condition of rape victims falling for their rapists ? 
  that could probably explain the kind of turn-around that dany had towards drogo . 
  tyrion : `` huh ... you do n't see that everyday . '', 
  jon : `` so it 's true !, 
  jackpot !, 
  haha here we come night king ! '', 
  jaime : `` damn ... our battle formations have just been made pointless . '', 
  buy my first home . 
  set-aside my son 's college / university money . 
  pay off some cards . 
  bring my mother along on a trip . 
  give some for cancer research for cancer in children and finally , learn how to fly a plane . 
  just goes to show how much she 's a noob when it comes to warfare . 
  ` how the mighty have fallen ' scenario indeed when you compare her to the old targaryen dragonlords . 
  there 's a few mobiles games in the market that are actually worth your time and money ( should you decide to spend any on them , they 're free-to-play ) . 
  books are a no brainer but personally i grew up with comics and visual novels so i have trouble recommending books as a good past-time ; i fall asleep when there is n't a single picture . 
  and of course , there 's glorious reddit !, 
  well , it depends on what you like . 
  personally i just play rpgs on my phone so if you 're into those , might want to look into final fantasy brave exvius , seven knights and fate / grand order ( if you 're in the u.s. ) . 
  chizuru in 2b 's maid-outfit < 3, 
  i know this feeling . 
  it 's the same state i was in before i pulled orlandeau . 
  that moment when the game was starting to feel stale and i 'm thinking thoughts like * `` why am i even playing this ? 
  '' * or * `` what am i getting out of this out in the long run ? '' * . 
  this is when i ** semi-quit ** the game . 
  which means i pretty much only logged in to use up orbs ( if there was a raid at the time ) or get the free daily gifts and then forget about it for the rest of the day . 
  it was like this for about 2 months , just hording stuff for when orlandeau comes . 
  and then , he arrived . 
  that was my moment . 
  i knew that if i was n't going to get him , then i was n't going to get any future base 5-stars worth getting . 
  i unloaded on orlandeau 's banner ( lol shut up ) like there was no tomorrow . 
  like the game was closing down the week after , i used up everything with reckless abandon . 
  then , the old man came down on me ( fuck you , shut it ) in that glorious unicorn colored crystal . 
  after a mere 20 + tickets he came majestically ( sigh ... i give up ) . 
  fast forward to today , i used whatever little i had to try and get luneria , and i really wanted her . 
  did n't get her . 
  tried to get dv for his tm to bolster the old man . 
  did n't get him or his brethren either . 
  currently using whatever ticket i get on this raid still trying to get dv , no luck so far . 
  point is ... i think it 's ** that time ** again for me to semi-quit . 
  zip up my wallet and just log-in for the free stuff and orbs then forget this game even exists for the rest of the day . 
  i 'm going to start stocking up again for , i dunno , maybe squall or sephiroth if they ever come out . 
  i suggest you do the same , unless you still have n't completed the main campaign yet so go ahead and do that . 
  right ... i 'm a 51 deadeye and tukohama keeps wiping the floor with me . 
  that damn totem of his in the middle keeps sucking up my life like it had a straw . 
  am i under-leveled for this guy ? 
  it was a mere 9 % . 
  i did n't think anyone saw this post of mine so i went ahead and , for the first time , refunded & moved around some skill points . 
  i went for the ones that increased my life and elemental resistance . 
  i never needed them until now . 
  i 'm pleased to say that i beat him just before i posted this . 
  thank you for at least replying and trying to help me . 
  i knew it ... after i saw that story based debuff come in i had a bad feeling about it from then on . 
  ugh ... this is going to be a hard grind because i 've focused on getting bow based passives from the get go . 
  ignored anything for defense . 
  i went with the ** `` best defense is a good offense '' ** route . 
  bad idea i guess ... 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm not even using it on nier . 
  i 'm still trying to get a hold of dv because of his tm for orlandeau . 
  goodluck to us all !, 
  for fuck 's sake , dan ... 
  i 'm curious now that i found out that drakengard is connected to it . 
  i never played any of the nier games but i have played and enjoyed drakengard . 
  i 've just recently applied to be a corrections officer . 
  i 'm not sure how similar the environment of prisons here in new zealand are , compared to the ones in the united states , but i still want the veterans ' opinions here , nonetheless . 
  should i be a `` robot '' when dealing with inmates ? 
  meaning only sticking to my job and my job alone ? 
  saying and only doing things that are required by the job ? 
  does that mean if they try to socialize with me , should i even bother responding or just keep a poker face , ignore and keep on moving ? 
  or can i still try to be a decent human being and ask an inmate in kind how their day was if they ask me the same ? 
  edit : i received the message about me being an unverified user . 
  that 's because , technically , i 'm not even in corrections , yet . 
  i 've only passed recently my cv / resume and is scheduled for an interview . 
  t h i c c < 3, 
  i take it events like that are the reason rig staff earn big bucks ? 
  curing all diseases all over the world simultaneously should get the attention of even the most skeptical of atheists . 
  for the select extremely stubborn ones ( which tend to be the rich , powerful and corrupt ) ; teleport in front of them , speak to them in their mind and show that i know everything that they 're hiding . 
  again , simultaneously .
