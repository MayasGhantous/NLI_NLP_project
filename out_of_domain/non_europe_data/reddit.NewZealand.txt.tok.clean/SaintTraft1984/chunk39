  no matter what you all pull from this , it ca n't be as bad as mine . 
  okay . 
  it ** could ** , indeed , be worse . 
  let all know and remember that , albafika , is the reason why gumi would do such a change to resistances . 
  15/9/2017 never forget !, 
  now that you broke it down like that , his ` broken phantasms ' make much more sense now . 
  just infuse them with mana to overload them and make them explode . 
  as for excalibur , i believe `` he '' did mention that he can try to replicate it though at the cost of his life or something . 
  also , the way he said made it look like he was just bluffing but then we would never really know . 
  does this also explain why we do n't see him wielding axes , spears or even ` snake-swords ' ? 
  but then , just recently in the game fate/extella , he is able to replicate what looks to be excalibur and gungnir . 
  however , that is just a game so clearly it may not be canon at all . 
  hahaha talk about unecessary . 
  i 'm new to this game hailing from ffbe . 
  looking for a 2nd time sink whenever i run out of energy or raid orbs in ffbe . 
  i 've checked the faq on which units are good to start on . 
  my question is ; is there ` rerolling ' in this game like in ffbe ? 
  if yes , ** should ** i even bother rerolling ? 
  alright cool . 
  thank you !, 
  thank you !, 
  the free tickets we get have no expiration , right ? 
  i can just keep them in my inventory indefinitely ? 
  i 'm referring to the free 2-star , 3-star and 5-star tickets that we get daily from logging-in . 
  should i hold off on getting selena via ticket and just wait for her to appear in the inn ? 
  cool . 
  regarding # 2 ; do all of the heroes currently available have a chance of appearing in the inn ? 
  alright . 
  thank you !, 
  oh so , it 's actually okay to use rubies to refresh conquests ? 
  i also play ff : brave exvius and seven knights and using in-game currencies in those games are considered a waste of resources . 
  naturally , i carried over that custom over to this game . 
  so , does that mean saving rubies for heroes is actually a bad thing in the long run ? 
  you just know that sophie is a freak behind closed doors . 
  love it . 
  cool . 
  thank you !, 
  i see . 
  yeah , my main party is mostly level 34 ~ 35-ish and already i 'm feeling the grind . 
  i currently have the following :, 
  * clause - tank, 
  i was planning to get selena and swap her in kasel 's place as my phy dps because i really like archers . 
  is my future plan a sound strategy ? 
  i 've yet to receive the 3-star and 5-star tickets . 
  dimael i got through the 2-star . 
  saving up for cg fina . 
  i like the idea of her being a top tier healer but can still switch to dps even though her main stat is spr . 
  tilith should suffice for now . 
  arch would have been fine if they put in more work into his sprite . 
  he look 's so rushed in his design . 
  his wings are not properly integrated into his sprite . 
  it 's obvious they decided to add the wings in the last minute . 
  his legs look `` off '' in that they 're just a single piece . 
  it looks like he 's naked from his waist below and they only drew the details of the pants and boots on them ala skin-paint . 
  lastly , that `` bow '' of his is the pinnacle of lazy designing . 
  atm , dimael and selena are the only `` real '' looking archers in the game for me . 
   yeah just go with what you like i say . 
  cool ^_^, 
   fyi sprites are 2d ( ffbe ) , models are 3d ( kr ) \u3147\u3145\u3147, 
  whatever . 
  lol xd, 
  now see , this is why i do n't get this sub sometimes . 
  op clearly put some effort in this post and the topic also encourages discussion , and yet , it get 's downvoted to oblivion . 
  meanwhile , really short posts of people reminding others ( which is a nice gesture ) to collect any rewards / compensations from gummi get 's up voted to over 9,000 . 
  yeah i dunno , i think the help thread is seen by an entirely different group on an entirely different planet . 
  that or there 's actually some sort of ` down-vote brigade ' here . 
  yeah the guides and help thread here are really neat , i 'll give the community that . 
  but as for discussion topics , i feel it 's more political . 
  if you 're not on the good side of the mods or if they do n't even know you , your post is n't going to last long or it get 's down-voted real bad . 
  is tomorrow the last day of the raid ? 
  i 'm still about 400k from the 10 % moogle . 
  aw nice !, 
  thank you for answering !, 
  sweet !, 
  i feel the same towards arena . 
  expeditions , i only do because of the ticket . 
  after i get it , i stop and do n't even bother for the moogle . 
  i 'm not having fun with the raids but i am still driven to do it due to that 10 % moogle each time . 
  i do n't do macros as well . 
  at the moment , i am focusing on the singular goal of saving for cg fina and sephiroth . 
  so far those two are barely fueling my drive in playing the game . 
  they better stay true to vp in that lenneth has different attack animations and limit animation depending whether she 's using a sword or a bow . 
  which is really sad . 
  so much room for animation improvement in this game but gumi just `` does n't feel like it '' . 
  i imagine the recent security breaches pretty much guaranteed that updated attack animations wo n't be in their to-do-list anytime soon . 
  i do n't like the sand . 
  it 's coarse and rough and irritating and it get 's everywhere . 
  i 've only been playing for a week . 
  overall party level is 50-ish . 
  main dps units are selena and damiel . 
  based so far on what i 've learned and experienced ; you have to make sure your lone dps can really dish out some damage for a plan like your 's to work . 
  not to mention your tank also has to be really resilient to make it really worth while for those 2 healers to support . 
  not much point to 2 healers if your tank is dead , you know ? 
  what happens when we get a `` session expired '' message ? 
  it randomly happens when i 'm on auto-repeat which then kicks me back into the log-in screen . 
  i play on my desktop via memu . 
  can those actually blow a full grown adult away ? 
  i ask because it 's so tempting to take a picture standing right inside it and pretending you 're charging up for a fight . 
  [ removed ], 
  do you think we 'll get noctis , his crew and possibly even some of the kingsglaives from the movie to coincide with the release of ffxv this coming november ?
