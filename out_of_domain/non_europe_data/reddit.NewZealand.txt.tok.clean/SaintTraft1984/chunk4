  for you . 
  it was designed specifically with long-term replay value in mind due to previous castlevanias before it being too short and linear . 
  if you 're a perfectionist , sotn will take you a decent amount of time to fully complete and that 's what makes it so awesome . 
  sotn also introduced a new art and overall design style for the series in a time when ` conan the barbarian ' was the go-to stereotypical hero look . 
  sotn also overhauled the overall controls and game-play of the protagonist . 
  adding more than a mere whip to use and greatly smoothed and increased the responsiveness of the controls . 
  in short , play it , it 's going to be awesome . 
  i thought it was shane ... then i read the comments here . 
  i feel so betrayed ... wtf ace ... 
  haha extremely so . 
  especially when you got ` that sword ' . 
  i 'm torn about this really . 
  should i make my 36 ace , 38 ? 
  thank you . 
  ** region : ** global, 
  ** player status : ** free-to-play, 
  here 's a picture of all of the characters i 've acquired so far . 
  i was planning to save my tickets for when orlandu comes out but it seems cecil seems to good to pass up . 
  what do you all think ? 
  should i go for it or save them for orlandu ? 
  thank you again , nazta . 
  noted my posting mistake . 
  thank you !, 
  you and nazta pretty much suggested the same thing . 
  i 'll just stick to dailies then and save those tickets . 
  it seems so , since according to the wikia , there are n't any material spawning spots or even hidden treasures . 
  haha !, 
  i try to remind myself that the main story content do n't expire like the events do . 
  i still have a ton of quests to complete there myself . 
  alright , same suggestion as the last two people . 
  will do , thanks !, 
  whoever voted for those two winning costumes ... your taste sucks . 
  like really . 
  they should make this new feature of their gatcha system permanent . 
  a guaranteed reward of the hero the player is really aiming to get after spending that much rubies . 
  the ranked treasures we get for spending are still not 100 % guarantee so this new way is better . 
  no more spending 12,000 rubies but you do n't get the hero that you want . 
  already am but i 'm just afraid that it 's too slow . 
  sadly i can only afford may 's lucky box and may 's calendar gift . 
  and even if i could afford it ; 137.71 nzd for 1,100 rubies and 100 topaz ? 
  there 's such a thing as a little too much . 
  i just started yesterday in playing this game and still in the process of rerolling . 
  while i 'm doing that , what do you think of robin hood and selwyn ? 
  they 're the only reason i bothered to try out this game since i really , really like archers . 
  is there room in this deck type of your 's for those two ? 
  if so , any suggestion on what to drop for them ? 
  also , thank you very much for this deck . 
  i 've played mtg and hearthstone before but aside from a few similarities here and there , shadowverse is essentially a fresh new card game for me . 
  hi all . 
  mtg and hearthstone player here . 
  just started playing yesterday and still rerolling to get the forestcraft cards that i really want . 
  i just wanted to ask on how viable robin hood and grand archer selwyn are . 
  they 're the main reason why i gave this card game a chance . 
  after seeing their art , i was sold since i like elves and archers . 
  so , how good are they ? 
  can i build a competitive deck around them ? 
  lastly , aside from ancient elf , any other key cards for forestcraft that i should be looking out for in my rerolls ? 
  thank you for the in-depth reply . 
  exactly what i needed to hear . 
  i 'll take it greatly into consideration !, 
  i 'll be doing my 4th re-roll as i submit this message . 
  for some reason , game keeps giving me gold and legendaries of the blood and dragon decks . 
  lol, 
  thank you !, 
  will add tia and the others to the list !, 
  yeah , i 'm starting to get the elft/fairy deck a little bit now after going through the cards and the two cards i like really do feel like just ` win-more ' cards than actually staple ones . 
  yeah , it seems i may just go 2-tia 1-hood and 2-cynthia 1-selwy . 
  was afraid my topaz farming would n't make it and i 'd miss out on the ethereal package . 
  i like brave exvius ' `` less-is-more-simple-is-better '' approach . 
  re-downloaded brave frontier out of curiosity and my god ... their high-level sprite designs got even crazier after all this time . 
  i mean really , half the time i have no idea wtf i 'm looking at or i ca n't even see where the hero 's head is . 
  lol, 
   these costumes are great arent they ? 
  one of my two favorite costume sets , 
  they are !, 
  personally would have preferred if the colors scheme was silver and blue but i still like their designs . 
   by doing just arena ? 
  arena , transcending and purchasing the 11.99 nzd package once . 
  in one universe that should not be named , yeah , they do shine ... and sparkle . 
  * shudder/barf *, 
  regardless of who their friend unit is , if they 're inactive for 7 days or more , i kick . 
  i still have a vivi friend and believe it or not ; a rain friend , because they 're both still active . 
  i stopped playing brave frontier on the same year that it came out . 
  i just came back because of ffbe and out of genuine curiosity on what 's new and i have to say , i 'm enjoying what i 'm seeing so far . 
  i currently only have a few omni-potential units from this past week of playing and pulling from the omni summon . 
  below are the ones i have :, 
  * selena, 
  * daze, 
  * holia, 
  now , after going through the new omni units at the wiki , i found myself torn between two : krantz and hisui . 
  based on the ones i already have ; which should i go with the two ? 
  currently leaning towards krantz with the mindset that the best defense is a strong offense . 
  any thoughts or suggestions ? 
  yeah , that bit of krantz ' leader passive giving bonuses based on if you have 5 different elements in the party was what caught my eye . 
  i like variety in my parties , having something for any situation . 
  i also have the following non-omni 's as my main party :, 
  * aem, 
  so ... does that mean i should give hisui a second look ? 
  and yes , my current leader is actually holia since her healing helps a lot . 
  thanks !,
