  i 'm curious to see how armiger arsenal will look in classic rpg graphics . 
  i also would n't be surprised if noctis was given the barrage skill . 
  nyx ulric and general glauca would look awesome as well in be .

  i transferred my account from nexon but now i 'm unable to log-in the game because it keeps telling me ` account locked ' . 
  i tried logging-in on the site but it says incorrect password . 
  tried submitting a ticket at the sites 1:1 support feature but i ca n't submit a ticket and it says i should contact administration . 
  really a bad start for eyedentity . 
  this just started happening after the recent maintenance . 
  anyone else experiencing this on their bluestacks ? 
  the game tries to load but it keeps crashing during loading with no errors whatsoever . 
  the game just shuts down .

  is it possible to have some sort petition going to extend the end date of the package ? 
  it 's only now with these limited edition costumes , that i realize how hard it is to acquire topaz . 
  i did the math and i ** will ** have the required amount at the last day of may 's 30-day box , but sadly , the event will expire before that happens . 
  hi all . 
  mtg and hearthstone player here . 
  just started playing yesterday and still rerolling to get the forestcraft cards that i really want . 
  i just wanted to ask on how viable robin hood and grand archer selwyn are . 
  they 're the main reason why i gave this card game a chance . 
  after seeing their art , i was sold since i like elves and archers . 
  so , how good are they ? 
  can i build a competitive deck around them ? 
  lastly , aside from ancient elf , any other key cards for forestcraft that i should be looking out for in my rerolls ?

  for me , the bug only occurred on my adventure tab . 
  the other tabs like raid , arena , etc. 
  were all intact . 
  as most of you know , if you try to click on the locked masteries , the game will ask if you want to spend rubies . 
  now , i do n't have enough rubies at the moment so when i clicked that , the game asked me if i wanted to purchase rubies . 
  i said no . 
  next , ** out of curiosity , i went and clicked on the offensive button at the bottom of the masteries . 
  lo and behold , my previously locked masteries were all unlocked once again . 
  so , to those who are experiencing this , try clicking on the offensive / defensive buttons . 
  see if the issue works itself out for you . 
  at this rate , i do n't think my refia and cod will hit max on time for me to finish crystal tower elt . 
  ** party : **, 
  * * cod * - kangaroo , green beret , black robe , hero 's ring x2 , atk + 10 % , diablos, 
  * * wol * - mighty hammer , golden shield , survivor helm , force armor , angel ring , muscle belt , def + 10 % , golem, 
  * * bartz * - chirijiraden , flame shield , mythril helm , reflect helm , hyper wrist x2 , ifrit, 
  * * garnet * - mythril mace , green beret , cleric 's robes , ramuh, 
  * * refia * - golden staff , circlet , sage 's robe , gold armlet , muscle belt , mp + 20 % , mag + 10 % , shiva, 
  ** friend **, 
  * * elza * - for some reason i 'm unable to view his equipment in the friend list window . 
  but as you 'll see in the screenshot i provided , he 's pretty decked out and he also has dw . 
  ** battle flow : **, 
  sorry but near the end of the battle , i stopped counting turns due to sheer excitement . 
  in the beginning though , i pretty much followed what the majority of posts here suggested :, 
  * * turn 1 * - wol full break , refia embolden , bartz barrage , cod barrage , garnet basic attack , elza madness rush, 
  * * turn 2 * - wol provoke , cod omni veil , bartz barrage , garnet basic attack , elza madness rush , refia cura, 
  after those two turns , i was able to bring down maxwell 's life near or less 30 % that it activated resurrection which was a free turn for me . 
  from that point on , i recall defending with elza and only using basic attacks on her , making sure that she forces maxwell to use resurrection . 
  in the whole battle , maxwell resurrected 3 times for me . 
  healed if necessary with refia , full breaked and provoked with wol if needed . 
  bartz helped elza in juggling maxwell 's life since he did n't really hit that hard . 
  barrage or omni veil with cod . 
  garnet defended until it was time for her to use her limit . 
  there was a point when garnet , wol and bartz died . 
  had to use some phoenix downs and curaja right after . 
  used bartz entrust and gave his limit to elza . 
  was lucky that garnet was able to fill her bar the normal way . 
  casted diablos with cod then elza 's limit to finish maxwell off . 
  all the while , i was casting provoke , curaja , barrage with bartz or cod as needed . 
  elza defended most of the time or only used a basic attack because she had dw . 
  * tldr ; rushed to getting maxwell down to 30 % or less hp and then just filled my limit and esper bars at that point . 
  skipped the turn 4 limit and 50 % threshold . 
  ** vogor i 'm not sure if you visit this reddit but in case you do , i just want to say a heart felt thank you . 
  not only for this event but for all the past ones that you helped me complete and make that last push for the rewards . 
  i really appreciate it . 
  thank you as well for all of the vets here and fellow non-whales that provided their experience as a guide on how to tackle this ridiculous event . 
  ** btw ; i did not enjoy this event . 
  i do n't feel accomplished at all . 
  maxwell left a bad taste in my mouth and to be honest , i 'm still pissed at her even after completing this . 
  lol !, 
  edit : grammar checks and i 'm sorry if i chose the wrong flair . 
  currently , we only get rewards for completing each location only . 
  would be nice if we could also receive rewards for clearing an entire map . 
  like , if we 100 % clear all of the quests in all of the areas in grandshelt isles , we get a reward for that . 
  and if we 100 % complete everything in the entire grandshelt region , dirnado and olderion respectively , we also get something for that . 
  tickets ? 
  unique and useful equipment for those that are just starting out and ca n't handle acquiring event items ? 
  examples :, 
  using kain and cecil together in a party unlocks a unique combination attack with an original animation for the two of them and also grants passive bonuses to their stats . 
  the special attack will hit very hard , but as a trade-off , they will both use up their turns regardless of whoever activates it . 
  zidane and garnet will get a feature wherein zidane will absorb any and all damage done to garnet . 
  until zidane is taken down , garnet will not be damaged by anything and zidane will always be a 100 % guaranteed cover on garnet . 
  garnet will also get a huge boost to her esper damage on top of her base esper damage bonus when zidane is around ( she 'll be inspired by his presence ) . 
  aside from those unique match-ups ; there will also be party-wide bonuses that can be activated if we use characters purely from one series of ff . 
  for example , using purely ffxiii characters will give everyone in the party a bonus % stat . 
  it can be a bonus to damage or healing amount or even make them immune against certain monsters or status effects . 
  what do you all think ? 
  i feel it would add additional depth to the combat and party system and also it 's kind of fun to fiddle around with combination systems like this . 
  here i thought i had more than enough gil . 
  whenever the gil cavern would be around , i would ignore it completely thinking `` meh , why do they even bother with this cave . 
  i 'd rather have the exp dunes . '', 
  i 'm learning that lesson the hard way right now . 
  damn ... 
  i just went ahead and got it done and over with .
