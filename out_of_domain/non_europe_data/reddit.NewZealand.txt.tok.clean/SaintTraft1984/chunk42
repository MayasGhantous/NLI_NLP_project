  * 3 giant growth, 
  * 4 inkmoth nexus, 
  * 4 simic guildgate, 
  * 5 island, 
  * 7 forest, 
  ** event result **, 
  * match 1 vs uw control, 
  result : 0 - 2, 
  did n't stand a chance . 
  he used two meddling mage to slow me down by lucky guessing glistener elf and blighted agent . 
  used runed halo too after he sweeped the field with verdict . 
  was able to take him down to 9 counters but after that , he just kept pteing or countering my creatures . 
  ghost quartered all 4 of my inkmoths every chance he got . 
  * match 2 vs mono red burn, 
  result : 2 - 0, 
  the only wins i got from the whole night and they were all solely due to luck . 
  i say that because the only reason i won is because the girl was still learning about the game and still getting used to fighting against infect . 
  she made the bad call on both rounds to try and out race me . 
  she kept burning me instead of killing my creatures which was her down fall . 
  * match 3 vs esper, 
  result : 1 - 2, 
  roughly the same kind of game flow as match one . 
  heavy control with 4 ptes and 4 fatal pushes with lots of counters and snapcasters to back them up . 
  he kept killing every single one of my creatures . 
  the one round i won was because i had 2 mutagenic growth in my opening hand and top decked a 3rd one . 
  used all of them when i was tapped out after baiting him with giant growth . 
  he ran out of mana that time and i went all out . 
  following match , was a one-sided game in his favor . 
  so , that 's pretty much how my game night was that time . 
  overall i just enjoyed playing the game but really , after that night , i 'm starting to wonder if i should have just invested in mono black infect all those years ago . 
  any comments or feedback on my deck would be greatly appreciated . 
  are fetches really necessary ? 
  is noble hierarch and spellskite really crucial ? 
  was those really just bad match-ups or i need to upgrade my card list ? 
  i just want the opinion of the community regarding which of these cards are better suited as side-board worthy for my mono white soul sisters . 
  for everyone 's convenience , i wo n't bother listing my main deck list . 
  just google whatever mono white soul sister deck and more or less , my deck is the same . 
  which is better between these for enchantment removal ? 
  * [ [ war priest of thune ] ], 
  the reason behind these cards is because of certain enchantments that hoses my whole deck 's game-plan by * reversing * it . 
  instead of gaining life , i lose it . 
  an example of a dangerous card against me is [ [ rain of gore ] ] . 
  meh , i give up on gilgamesh . 
  i 'll just wait until more units or equipment gets released in the future that will make him a cake walk . 
  there 's a reason why i 've never been into masochistic games like dark souls . 
  real life is already stressful enough as it is . 
  when i play a game i really just want to sit back and relax and not pull my hairs out of frustration . 
  i do n't want to 1-hit the guy , but how he is right now , even after following the strategies i 've seen online , i just ca n't be bothered . 
  ffvii 's weapons were more fun to play against than this guy . 
  they were a challenge , but importantly , they were fun . 
  i 'd rather go against ffix 's ozma or ffx 's dark aeons and penance all over again than this douche-bag . 
  * / end rant *, 
  now that i 've gotten that out of my chest ... 
  below is the party i went with . 
  take note that i only have two worthwhile tms : x1 dual wield and x1 blade mastery . 
  all of my units and friend unit are max 6-star . 
  * bartz / ifrit : laz mirazh , ice shield , survivor helm , reflect mail , gold armlet , frost ring, 
  * rain / golem : mighty hammer , snowstorm shield , grand helm , force armor , lightning ring , gold armlet, 
  * orlandeau / odin : kiyomori , durandal , dark helm , demon mail , hero 's ring x2, 
  * refia / carbuncle : golden staff , mystery veil , magi robe , gold armlet , defense bracer, 
  * friend unit : noctis *, 
  ** thank you for whatever help anyone can give me **, 
  edit : grammar checks , rewording , stanzas , spacing etc. . . 
  edit 2 : yes , i 'm trying to get all 4 missions in one go . 
  edit 3 : cecil , wol , chizuru , exdeath , cod and firion are all maxed out and on the bench . 
  y ` shtola is at max rank but still leveling . 
  if i should replace someone from my party with one of these , do n't hesitate to let me know . 
  edit 4 ( thank you panopticake ) : overall , i have trouble when he starts using x-slash . 
  it pretty much 1-hits 2 ~ 3 units and leave the remaining ones in near death state . 
  ** edit 5 : thank you to everyone once more for all of the tips you 've provided to tackle the 6-armed freak . 
  i 've bookmarked this thread so i can go back to it when i 'm ready to take him on again . 
  ** for now , i 'll focus what 's on my plate which are a ) the eggs , b ) getting y ` shtola to 100 and finally c ) crafting those hp boosting belts for everyone . 
  ** thank you again , community !, 
  ... and saw what everyone 's been complaining about regarding ` specialization ' . 
  i got ta say , i ca n't really blame the community on that . 
  for arguments sake ; yes , i do know that global is trying to move away from how kr does things and would like themselves to be ` unique ' from kr . 
  i 'm all for that really ; but these latest awakened units ... their specializations are n't even ground breaking to say the least . 
  i mean , what they offer for their respective modes are not even enough to warrant using shards on them . 
  i got ta say , if nm is going with this route , they better at least make these ` specialists ' worthwhile . 
  not kalahan or ichigo level but definitely more than they are right now . 
  just my feedback . 
  no hate . 
  tldr ; specializations are okay but nm needs to make sure what the units offer for their modes would really make them worth getting and awakening in the first place . 
  thalia 's lieutenant over ajani 's pridemate in mono white soul sisters ( basic deck-list ) ? 
  i 'm starting to lean in towards the lieutenant because aside from archangel of thune , everyone else in the deck is a human . 
  the only downside i could see from the lieutenant is that she is a mere 1/1 alone on the field as opposed to pridemate which is a 2/2 . 
  however , the downside with the pridemate is that you need at least 1 soul sister that 's already on the field before it in order for it to grow . 
  with the lieutenant , you can drop her first in a clean field , drop a sister after and she would still at least grow . 
  thoughts ? 
  give us the ability to change our equipment in the middle of any battle ( except arena ) . 
  should open up new strategies . 
  most recent scenario for me that this feature would really help with is the dark espers : ifrit and siren . 
  i go in using fryevia 's needle to take down ifrit . 
  after that , i go switch it out with chirijiraden for siren next . 
  i believe such a feature was available with some final fantasy games . 
  off the top of my head , i recall ix and x having this feature . 
  my friends play on their mobile game and they connect to the sea servers . 
  i live in new zealand so can i install the game on steam and play with them still ? 
  i just need general suggestions for my mono black vampires mana base and other utility lands . 
  off the top of my head , are fetches like marsh flats , manlands like mutavault and anti-control lands like cavern of souls .
