  but aside from those auto-includes above ; are there other lands i should be considering ? 
  i wo n't bother listing my decklist since it 's nothing unique or mind blowingly powerful . 
  just your typical mono black vampires build that run nighthawk , nocturnus and kalastria highborns . 
  thank you . 
  with the current heavy removal meta is it feasible to play a set of [ [ grand abolisher ] ] ? 
  i 'm asking because i 'm getting sick and tired of my ajani pridemate getting pushed or pathed every end of my turn . 
  is there any advantage to either style in the way they shoot ? 
  from the european / western standard of pulling straight out and releasing to the japanese way where they put the bow and arrow at the top of their head , then pull it down slowly as they stretch both arms wide . 
  do n't they waste time doing that ?

  edit :, 
  sorry , did n't notice immediately the `` no stupid questions '' thread . 
  i 'm serious about this question but if it still falls under that category , i apologize and please disregard this thread . 
  thank you .

  been browsing the web for soul sister articles , reviews etc. 
  and i 've come across a combo that i have n't seen or thought of for years now since it was suggested by conley woods in those old wizards deck articles . 
  the combo involves [ [ leonin relic-warder ] ] and [ [ phyrexian metamorph ] ] with at least 1 soul sister on the field . 
  once you see these two cards , you 'll immediately see how the combo is supposed to work . 
  my question is , any reason why no one has run this at all ? 
  i know it 's easily disrupted but , naturally , you wo n't start the combo until you 're sure both creatures are safe from response-removal . 
  thoughts ? 
  when i went to my local mechanic to get my warrant of fitness ( wof ) which is mandatory in this country ; the staff found foreign objects lodged in both my rear tyres . 
  a screw on the left and a nail on the right . 
  they were placed way inside the tyre . 
  so , do you think someone put them there ? 
  or just by accident ? 
  if it is by accident , are foreign objects that easily lodged in tyres ? 
  ... she 's a team leader now at an it company . 
  i 'm proud of her , i really am . 
  i know she deserves it . 
  as for me though , i 'm still stuck in an entry level role taking messages and after-hours overflow calls . 
  it 's okay , i do n't hate it or love it . 
  it 's an honest job that pays for the rent . 
  but man , my self-esteem is at an all time low ... my wife is making waves in her career while i 'm ... just here . 
  i dunno , maybe it 's because of the stereotype that men are supposed to be the ones to bring the `` bread '' home or in this case , the ** bigger ** bread . 
  alas , i think all i bring home are `` crackers '' . 
  any other guys feels something similar when their partners are more successful and earn more ? 
  and to the ladies , does it really matter if we earn less than you ? 
  mind you i do n't have any vises ( smoking , heavy drinking etc ) . 
  ** edit : thank for the pep talk , guys . 
  really needed those answers from other people in a similar relationship breadwinner set-up . 
  they helped .

  i 'm currently a level 32 civilian ( message center representative job ) wanting to re-roll into an entirely different class . 
  the guardian / defender job caught my eye as a job that i can really be proud off . 
  plus the idea of being able to defend myself better with the skills it comes with also attracted me . 
  thing is , i 'm having trouble with the sta ( stamina ) and str requirements . 
  they need to be high enough for me to pass the following mini-quests :, 
  * run 2.4-km in under 10:50 - mins or less, 
  * 34 press-ups, 
  * vertical jump, 
  * 100-kg grip test both hands total, 
  any grinding tips ? 
  the job has a minimum level requirement of 18 with no max level cap to change into . 
  but this is really hard . 
  ** update 1 ** : thank you all for your guides and tips . 
  just ran two days ago in the surrounding area around my home camp after not running for 2 weeks ( due to the winter patch coming in ) and boy , my sta disappeared just after dashing in full force 1 whole block . 
  it used to be i could maintain that for at least 3 or push it to 4 blocks . 
  i did n't stop entirely , but i definitely had to walk to let my sta charge back up . 
  this is very disheartening indeed . 
  my str is steadily progressing at least . 
  i can pump out 30 press-ups just fine but still iffy when i try to go pass that and aim for 34 + . 
  the problem is , the quests for the defender job are done consecutively ; meaning the press-ups are done immediately after the running quest . 
  no rests in between , maybe just a minute or two to breath . 
  so yeah , that 's why it 's difficult for me . 
  full spoilers for [ hod ] are up . 
  after going through them , i got ta ask , am i the only one who feels the entire set feels like ... ` meh ' ? 
  my first experience in mtg was way back in scars of mirrodin block . 
  while my favorite one was return to ravnica ( and discovering the first ravnica after that and also loving it ) and the first innistrad block . 
  since then , i dunno , feels like most of the cards they 've released to date seems to lack in power or ` umph ' compared to the old sets i mentioned . 
  so , i 'm okay with my current job but an opportunity presented itself for a new job that fits exactly what i want . 
  thing is ; how would you all propose i resign ? 
  should i say i 'm resigning due to scheduling reasons and would like to be a full time parent and not mention the new job ? 
  or is `` honesty is the best policy '' route still the way to go ? 
  ** edit and reply : thank you for the replies . 
  i know what i have to do now . 
  honest and professional route it is then . 
  it 's just , i 've always been anxious whenever it came to resigning from my job . 
  never easy for me .

  used the search function and i did not find any post related to this in some way so i went ahead and created this suggestion topic for it . 
  however , nazta , if someone else have suggested such a thing before , i do apologize that i was unable to locate it . 
  now , i 'm sitting here with 148/148 energy and tbh , i 'm not in the mood to use it on the maze due to limited unit space ( have 455 slots atm ) and i think i 've had my fill of cactuars and burst pots . 
  i also do n't macro farm so that 's out the window as well and i 'm all caught up in the story maps too . 
  ** my suggestion is , it would be nice if there 's a feature in-game that let 's us convert our energy into orbs . 
  like , there would be a scroll bar that goes left to right . 
  letting us choose to convert orbs ( if we 're done with the raid ) into energy and vice versa . 
  i 'm sure there are some that are bored with the raid as well . 
  they too can at least get those orbs used for something else . 
  i take that this will fall along the lines of qol features . 
  anyways , that 's my suggestion and sorry to the community if i someone else has posted something similar to this . 
  tried searching for it , but nadda . 
  ** edit : it 's true that i could be using the energy to farm megacrysts or even any of the vortexes . 
  but the point of what i 'm suggesting is , i specifically would like to focus on the raid itself and would like some form of energy sink in exchange for those orbs as an option . 
  now , on to the business argument ( which is a fair one ) , i 'm not saying all of my 148 energy should refresh all 5 raid orbs . 
  it could be that 148 energy will only net me a single one . 
  that 's still something . 
  ** and it does n't have to be just with the raid orbs . 
  the feature i 'm suggesting can be applied for the arena / colosseum orbs as well .
