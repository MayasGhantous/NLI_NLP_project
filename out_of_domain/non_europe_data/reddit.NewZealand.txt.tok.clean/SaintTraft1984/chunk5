  made up my mind with krantz on the get go , actually . 
  i just wanted some feedback from the community about him and hisui . 
  this is exactly what i needed to hear . 
  cheers !, 
  penelo has been screwing around with my rainbow pulls lately . 
  got 3 of her just this week alone . 
  i hate her . 
  really hate her . 
  i 'd like to add kris ' costumes where he has different style wings or no wings at all . 
  but when kris uses his skills , we still see the default undead wings . 
  would be nice if the costumes actually changed the skill animations or at least adapted some of the features to match the costume . 
  i do n't mind paying extra rubies and topaz for that . 
  from a business point of view , i highly doubt they 'd do something like that . 
  instead , i see them giving costumes it 's own version of chloe 's ruby box . 
  you accumulate points for buying costumes which you can eventually use to purchase other costumes with . 
  another way to make use of old costumes is to provide a sort of costume synthesis system ; you can combine old unwanted costumes to get one that you really like . 
  it 's a win-win for the company and us , their players . 
  xenogears , vagrant story , brave fencer musashi , valkyrie profile and star ocean . 
  outside of square games ; type moon 's fate series and nintendo 's fire emblem series . 
  archer emiya would finally push me over the edge and convert from 100 % a ftp player into a 100 % ptp . 
  would shell out the cash in a heart beat . 
  it felt like pro since i got killed so easily . 
  lol, 
  usually , i do , but ever since this event started , this particular friend of mine have never changed his lightning 's set-up . 
  this was the first time so i admit , was caught off guard . 
  i 'm on a bit of clock since i 'm aiming to get that 70k moogle . 
  every adv run is crucial for me . 
  looks like it . 
  lol !, 
  i hope so . 
  i got all tickets , all equips , 1 of each unique materia , the 30k moogle , roughly 20 + of each awakening materials , all cactuars , all phoenix downs and elixirs and all star quartz . 
  i 'm not sure if i 'll get the limit break pots since i do n't even have cecil . 
  hahaha and boy is he a fat one !, 
  he 's one of the few friends i have that are able to go pass the 500 + atk mark . 
  really impressive wallet he 's got . 
  meh , as much as i enjoy playing the ys franchise ; my wallet is still recovering from ethereal guardians and i still prefer how those look . 
  used up all of my 24 summon tickets + 1 featured pull only . 
  ca n't afford 10 +1 atm . 
  ** worthwhile pulls : **, 
  * x1 3 \u2605 edge, 
  ** others : **, 
  i added edge and firion as worthwhile pulls because i do n't have them yet in my collection . 
  just slightly bummed that i did n't get luneth but i was kind of expecting that being he 's a 5 \u2605 . 
  overall , i 'm glad that i finally got firion since i was aiming for him and cecil . 
  refia is definitely welcome , as well . 
  hey it 's still ramza !, 
  nice one !, 
  2 luneths ... wtf ... congratulations !, 
  i recommend buying a lottery ticket . 
  see on how you fare on that . 
  crazy luck to get all 4 from the current banner . 
  if it makes you feel a little better ; used up 24 summon tickets and i only got 1 refia and firion . 
  the rest were trust fodders . 
  actually satisfied in using up my entire stock of 24 tickets . 
  got refia and even better ; i got firion . 
  i 've been trying to hunt firion ever since global launched all those months ago . 
  it 's only now that my wish was granted . 
  can someone please provide stats and skills of 6 \u2605 firion ? 
  tried googling but could n't find anything . 
  cheers !, 
  i play 7k on bluestacks . 
  i tried clearing the cache but the main screen background is still the same one where lubu is in the middle fighting against the 7k . 
  is there a way to update that background without re-installing the game ? 
  the background should be the current halloween one where we see rupi and shane . 
  oh man , that sucks . 
  well , thank you for the reply anyways . 
  the least nm could have done was remake feng yan right . 
  sadly , even after this remake he still sucks . 
  pity , since he 's one of the few non-7k / lord heroes who 's majority of costumes are actually decent looking . 
   ** new pvp content ` real time-based arena ( you can control your heroes ) ' is now developing **, 
  about damn time . 
  there 's just no real challenge or needed skill with the current system . 
  it 's all about luck and who can spend the most money for those expensive awakened raid item packages . 
  from what the ga devs have been doing since global was launched , they still go with the base features of whatever korea has . 
  they only customize small bits and pieces , so to speak , of those features . 
  the ga devs can get the design freedom that they want with things like skills builds of heroes or tweaking the difficulty of the dungeons like they did with the recently added cake and power up crystal dungeons . 
  but if you look past ` sub-parts ' like that , you 'll see that the base features of those are still , more or less , the same . 
  this ` real time-based arena ' will be ( or might be ) a base core feature of the game when it comes out . 
  i believe the only way ga devs can truly deviate from kr with this feature would be to drop it altogether . 
  as for the issue with jam and feng yan * sigh * we 'll all just have to get with whatever they give us for now . 
  continue sending feedback their way but yeah , the change that we all want tend to take some time to be implemented . 
  i 'm all for feng yan , actually bought that black costume of his , but for now , he stays a 5 \u2605 collector 's hero . 
  edit : grammar checks, 
  ps : i 've played the game for some time now . 
  started out when velika was still the arena meta . 
  but i will admit that my knowledge of the entire game are not as in-depth as some of you here . 
  but this much i 'll say ; i love this game . 
  it 's the only mobile game i 've ever shelled out cash for ( though only with may 's packages lol ) and i love it wholly ; both good and bad . 
  confirmed . 
  page 3 of masteries ** for adventure ** are locked once more . 
  already purchased and unlocked ** all of them ** before this recent patch . 
  however , after checking the set-ups for the other modes , all of my masteries are still there . 
  it seems , for me , the problem is isolated to my adventure mode set-up . 
  aw man ... sorry to hear that . 
  i know how it feels . 
  i hope nm does something about this quick . 
  those page-3 masteries were really expensive . 
  really ?!, 
  i have n't bothered to try . 
  hang-on , your cod does n't have tms does it ?
