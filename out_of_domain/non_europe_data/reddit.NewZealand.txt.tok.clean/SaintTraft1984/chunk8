  would definitely add some interest to the game even more . 
  it 's ironic that suo is one of those characters with an awesome va and cool game quotes but stats-wise he was lack luster . 
  the only reason why i ever had him in my party was so that i can hear his lines . 
  him and ** `` mugen no kensen !, 
  he could just get meteor swarm as a normal spell , basically a renamed meteor spell and then just keep celestial star as his limit . 
  was n't celestial star the go to end-game spell in vp ? 
  there were only a few monsters that had resistance to it . 
  everyone else would be raped by that spell . 
  that 's a potential colab event dungeon right there . 
  albel knox !!!!, 
  and i want to see ** air ... ... ... ... raid !!, 
  ** as a limit break !!, 
  might want to un-equip her for now . 
  take off all of that weight off of her . 
  but sadly , hit 's like a toothpick hahahaha !, 
  i 'm fine with an increased challenged where even whale friend wo n't be able to save you by themselves alone without strategy . 
  ** however ** , i am not fine with a `` challenge '' wherein you need to have key tms like dw , dual-cast , excalibur or any of the other powerful tms in order to beat it . 
  not everyone is a whale , not everyone is keen on farming earth shrine ( with or without macros ) . 
  some us just prefer not being rushed and just raise our tms the normal way ; via moogles or extremely lucky daily pulls . 
  6 \u2605 rank pianist . 
  ** shiver ** i suddenly remembered my first play-through ffix when that bitch fucked my party up real good . 
  shame really , back then i was hoping that she was a recruitable character . 
  alas , we get stuck with her future husband . 
  lol, 
  ummm , for simple and short questions like this , might want to head on over to the daily help thread . 
  it 's actively monitored 24/7 so you 'll get a reply real quick . 
  as to your question ; what bartz offers is flexibility not only as a barrage unit , but more importantly , being able to act as a human elixir for your other units . 
  but when it comes to base raw str and damage , chizuru has a slightly upper hand and she also has a 6 \u2605 form in the future . 
  take note that this answer does not take into account tms and equipment . 
  just skill set and stat growth . 
  it is also based on what the more experienced vets on this reddit say about both units . 
  brave frontier for obvious reasons and seven knights . 
  seven knights have actually nice hero and skill designs . 
  hahahaha !!!, 
  i love it !, 
  delita got a free cake . 
  calling it now ; no way he does n't have dual wield , barrage and blitzblade . 
  though knights of the round and supernova are obviously one of the most favored ff attacks ; i have a special place in my heart for bahamut zero 's terra flare . 
  something about a dragon having 6 six wings firing an orbital laser just to get rid of 1 tiny cactus just warms up my heart . 
  just priceless . 
  are these black friday bundles sold for 1,200 and 350 lapis each worth their price ? 
  currently i have 34 summon tickets . 
  has anyone gotten any of the decent 5 \u2605 base from summon tickets alone ? 
  i ask because i 'm not sure if it 's better to just save 5,000 lapis and do a 10 +1 pull or go ahead with these bundles and just use the tickets later on . 
  nice . 
  thank you all for your feedback . 
  back to saving up then . 
  i 'm planning to put death debuff accessory on kris . 
  will it stack with his death debuff passive ? 
  will it increase the chances of the debuff activating ? 
  nice !, 
  hehe cheers !, 
  there 's a small chance that shane 's skill hits a second time . 
  you 'll know it activated if it looks like there 's more damage numbers than usual . 
  you ca n't miss it , the numbers will look like they 're glitched and overlapping each other . 
  another way of seeing it easily is during raid . 
  shane will noticeably do more damage to the dragon if the 2nd damage activates . 
  i 'm not really that into pvp . 
  at the very least , it 'll help in pve . 
  it 's still useful to 1-hit those void shield fuckers . 
  i only semi-follow the in-game recommendations . 
  for equipment , i always go for pure spd atk or a combination of spd + crit or spd + lethal , it depends on the hero . 
  for the gems , my tanks always get 's a life steal ruby along with certain heroes like spike and jave who benefit in staying alive longer . 
  you also have to consider what you 're equipping your heroes for . 
  pvp settings are wholly different from adventure , raid , cr and world boss settings . 
  my 40 evan , 40 karin , wallet and dick are all ready . 
  come at me , awakening !!, 
  you gave me an idea just now with that . 
  every-time we complete a region , we get a 10 % increase in getting a rainbow in our pulls permanently . 
  would definitely encourage people to play story and get 100 % on every location and region . 
  haha highly unlikely but it would definitely be a nifty reward . 
  fire equipment from grandshelt region , earth from dirnado and water for olderion ? 
  perfect . 
  yeah !, 
  speaking of which , i wonder when they 'll add more trophy treasure chests . 
  yeah , as i mentioned in another comment , a fire and earth equipment from grandshelt , lightning from dirnado and then water or ice from olderion would be very welcome . 
  that energy suggestion though , i like it . 
  perma reduced energy consumption in that region would be very , very useful in the long run for vets and even for newbies . 
  yes . 
  not game breaking equipment but with stats enough to help newbies alike in starting out . 
  at the very least , they should help in leveling since not every new player are fortunate to receive a whale friend request . 
  after 100 % completing grandsheldt , a cut scene occurs and we see rain and laswell be presented the medal of frontier research and discovery . 
  they 're officers , remember ? 
  we see them wearing military medals . 
  in actual game-play , the medals give both perma passive stats of some sort . 
  god no , haha , as much as i enjoyed sotn , that map % completion made me urk . 
  nah , i just mean completing all of the location quests in each region . 
  as much as i want trust moogles , it 's pretty clear that it is n't something they 'll just throw around for free . 
  heck , even the one we receive as a daily check-in reward only comes after 30 days worth of check-ins . 
  wow ... gl has a lot to live up to . 
  i hope they plan to eventually follow the path that jp is doing with those misc . 
  daily rewards . 
  i think crissaegrim would be a weapon like twin lance ; makes your normal attacks hit more than once . 
  excalibur would simply be  holy sword . 
  i 've never seen them around . 
  haha you noticed huh ? 
  why would such practices be prevented by the jp gacha game law ? 
  something to do with not everyone being able to get some characters and therefore miss out on the bonuses ? 
  wow ... and here i thought my luck as a ftp is bad . 
  never spent a scent , though i 've only been doing daily pulls and tickets since the gl version launched and i already have cod , exdeath , refia , wol , kefka , terra , bartz , zidane and firion to name a few .
