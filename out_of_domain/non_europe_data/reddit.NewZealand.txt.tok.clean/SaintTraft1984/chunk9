  i still do n't have any base 5-star with dual wield though . 
  i am so sorry for your pain . 
  do n't quit , maybe , just maybe , orlandu 's banner is when your luck will finally shine . 
  it 's the holidays ; you might get him as your present . 
  from what i remember from the guides people posted here ; you 're supposed to leave the main flower for last and kill the roots first . 
  killing the flower first with any of the other roots intact will 100 % wipe your team , or any team for that matter . 
  keep full-break up on all of the parts , that 's vaan 's only job . 
  cod should keep veil and protectga up at all times . 
  you have an impressive luneth so you might want focus with his * cut through * skill one root at a time . 
  do n't use * hit all * as you might kill the main flower before the roots and barrage is also too random . 
  from what other 's have suggested in the past ; ** focus fire each part ** is key here . 
  huh ? 
  just click on those branch like things on it until you see the targeting icon on it . 
  she was never known for her boobs . 
  her face , neck , height and legs are her weapons of choice . 
  can you imagine putting implants on that slim figure of her 's ? 
  it 's like two squid balls on the side of a barbecue stick ; ugly . 
  lol wtf ... is this your very first computer game ? 
  hahahaha kidding . 
  you 'll be alright . 
  i beat it just yesterday . 
  do the middle branch first , then the top , then the bottom , then flower last . 
  have fun !, 
  i get that you 're trying to be optimistic and all . 
  i myself purchased some gigantuars and currently stopped doing the event until i see the next banner . 
  but sadly , overall , it is a bad event . 
  in-spite of all the little good in it , it 's still , really , that bad . 
  experiencing connection hiccups as well . 
  looks like netmarble did n't take into account the possible server load they might receive with the release of awakening . 
  at the very least , a quick repeat button would be a good start . 
  a challenge is fine but i 'm a `` filthy casual '' not because i do n't like difficult content but i like multi-tasking while also playing my favorite mobile games . 
  and no , do n't tell me `` well you should n't be playing games then '' . 
  you play however the fuck you want , and i 'll do the same , thanks . 
  op was suggesting a qol feature which the current version of the game is lacking a lot of ( collect all for rubies and shards , or shards just going straight into your inventory instead of having to be collected ** one by one ** from the mail ) . 
  if we were in a golden age gumi would compensate everyone with 5,000 lapis , 20 tickets , and 1 6-star unit of their choosing . 
  oh and we would have the cure to cancer . 
  lol, 
  ahahahahahahahaha extended again hahahahaha !!!!, 
  i 'm starting to think someone pulled the wrong wire somewhere among a bunch of other wires at this point . 
  lol, 
  or probably worse ; one of their it guys spilled a drink on one of the servers . 
  you know , those refrigerator sized hardware inside those extremely cold server rooms ? 
  can you imagine the extension if this game had the same graphics as mobius ? 
  lol 1 week extension hahahaha !, 
  welp , guess i 'll go and sleep this off . 
  so , firion and chizuru both get 6 \u2605 in the future , my question is ; which one should i feed my atk pots to ? 
  currently i only have 1 dual wield . 
  which one should i invest in the future ? 
  if it helps ; my main party consists of wol ( tank ) , cod ( support ) , exdeath ( mage ) , refia ( healer ) , kain ( temp dps which will be replaced in the future by firion or chizuru ) . 
  the only thing i 'm missing is a staple phy dps . 
  sweet , thanks for that tip . 
  i 'll take it !, 
  yaboypsr2 , i forgot to ask ; for phy dps like firion and chiz , is it worth giving them the other pots ( hp , spr , def etc. ) ? 
  obviously they wo n't need mag but what about the others ? 
  does elemental resistance reduction abilities like imperil stack with bartz 's seaker blade giving a total of -40 % wind resistance ? 
  you mean the order that they appear in ? 
  you can try to sort them out and hope that the friends you 're aiming for appears . 
  other than that , you 'll have to use the not so strong friends until the ones you want show up . 
  cheapest way to do that is earth shrine at a mere 1 nrg . 
  tsk !, 
  well that 's a let down . 
  oh well , thanks !, 
  it 's because of this why i 'm holding off on spending a single cent further on this game . 
  i 'll still play but until they show some permanent action towards hackers like these , i 'll take my money elsewhere , for now . 
  i have wol but from what i 've experienced and from countless feedback of cecil owners ; he is pretty much what makes events easier to do . 
  wol is trying really hard , and i appreciate him for it , but he 's just no cecil . 
  currently have 112 star quartz . 
  should i buy 2 force shields or be patient and save up for that moogle ? 
  just recently acquired my first dw via moogles exclusively ( i do n't macro or do any tm farming for that matter ) . 
  i 'm asking because i 'm thinking that i might as well just wait for better shields that will come in the near future . 
  i 'm currently using the latest version of memu and the only time i crash is when i overload my internet connection by playing online games + streaming + torrenting and even then , it 's very rare . 
  up to you . 
  i had about 40 + just a week ago . 
  was planning to do exactly what you 're planning now ... then i snapped and just started mass summoning because i really want to get camouflage . 
  because of that , i have 2 hp + 10 % . 
  camouflage is only at 15 % though . 
  lol, 
  hmmm well since you mentioned the next chocobo ; do you have a link to all of the available fat chocobo merchandise that will be coming in the near future ? 
  i was planning to buff up wol , exdeath and bartz just a little bit more . 
  ran out of energy so right now i 'm just trying to optimize my main units as much as i can . 
  trying to add green numbers whenever i 'm able to . 
  right now all of the worthwhile tms are still only halfway done ( 50 + % mark ) . 
  the latest and first one that i ever got is dw . 
  yeah , that spr stat is why i asked . 
  i was wondering if i could beef up wol , exdeath and bartz just a little bit more . 
  but since there 'll be better shields in the future , yeah , i think i know what to do now . 
  thanks !, 
  nice . 
  thank you !, 
  do 2 growth eggs stack ? 
  i just pulled my 2nd medius . 
  was wondering if i should keep or feed him to the first . 
  thanks !, 
  got it !, 
  apparently so ... 
  could 've sworn i still had over 100k in the past days . 
  recently maxed out chorizo , bartz , maxwell and now garland . 
  i kind of regretting it a little now , that i was n't so smart in my spending . 
  maxed chorizo , bartz , maxwell and now trying to do the same with garland . 
  just kept maxing any units that i can for the future .
