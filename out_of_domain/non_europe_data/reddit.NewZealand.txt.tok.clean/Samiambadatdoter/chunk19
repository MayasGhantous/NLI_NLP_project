  let 's run down the ds2 `` dudes in armour '' bosses . 
  ** dragonrider ** : bipedal human that will slowly walk to you and attack . 
  iudex gundyr is probably his closest match in 3 , but iudex not only had that whole abyss transform in his second phase , his attacks were n't so blindingly obvious to read , he actually did other things aside from slowly swinging his halberd ( jump attacks , punches , grabs , kicks , shoulder checks ) and had actual combos to speak of . 
  he also could n't be beaten by circle-strafing without ever dodging , nor could he throw himself off his own arena . 
  ** dragonslayer ** : bipedal human that will slowly walk to you and attack . 
  he will sometimes lunge instead , but they are telegraphed and not that dangerous . 
  ** looking glass knight ** : bipedal human that will slowly walk to you and attack . 
  his lightning based attacks are pretty much glorified heavy attacks . 
  his thing is to summon another player to assist him in the fight , but my experience of this has always been being summoned into 3 players as players who are willing to solo a ng + knight and another player are a rarity . 
  ** double dragonriders ** : two bipedal humans , one who will begin by slowly walking towards you and attacking while the other fires a bow . 
  when the bow dragonrider falls , he will slowly walk towards you and attack . 
  this boss fight , in my opinion , highlights the ridiculously limited moveset and ai of the dragonriders . 
  out of all the `` dudes in armour '' fights , they do the least interesting things . 
  champion gundyr mirrors this boss by being basically a more difficult version of an early boss , but champion gundyr was n't a double boss fight of a boss that had a silly and limited moveset . 
  he upped the ante by combo-ing like a madman with stabs , slashes , charges , and kicks , as well as flinging boulders when he used his jump attack and using a stomp to stun . 
  he is the most `` dude in armour '' - y boss in 3 , but his fighting ability does a lot to try to make up for it . 
  ** pursuer ** : bipedal human , though this one floats . 
  it does make for some cool looking combos , but ultimately does n't make fighting him that much different as he does n't use his floating power that much and is also ridiculously vulnerable to circle-strafing . 
  he does pretty standard swing sword and shield bash combos , his only interesting thing being his buff stab and the pursuers he 'll cast if he 's buffed . 
  he 's most comparable to dragonslayer armour in 3 , but da had things like lightning buffed and two-handed attacks that did massive amounts of damage and thus forced you to play it safe when you saw him preparing either of those things . 
  he also had the pilgrim butterfly giving him fire support , and was capable of breaking the boundaries of the arena and pushing you off of them if you were n't capable . 
  ** velstadt ** : bipedal human that will slowly walk to you and attack and buffs when he is low on health . 
  he has a very interesting design that saves this encounter , in my opinion , but the fight is very standard if more difficult than usual because of his moveset consisting of delayed attacks that were designed to make you flinch and wide swings that were designed to roll-catch . 
  the atmosphere , music , and bell-hammer do a lot for the fight , however , so i really ca n't say i hate the velstadt fight . 
  ** ruin sentinels ** : 3 bipedal humans . 
  somewhat more interesting as their movesets and design are really mechanical and the music highlights this . 
  the first sentinel is a pretty standard fight , but fighting the second and third is basically just baiting attacks . 
  their only interesting mechanics are the spin to win as they can synchronise it and the shield toss as not only can it catch you off guard , they also lose their shield . 
  they also have a really bad habit of basically being stunlocked by powerstanced hammers . 
  ** the last giant/giant lord ** : bipedal human ( really big one ) and also literally the same fight . 
  they use the same moveset ( for the last giant , he needs to rip off his arm first ) and it basically a ` wait for big swing , dodge big swing ' , i know they did that exact same thing for yhorm , but at least they tried to spice it up with the fire moveset ( which was kinda pointless ) , the storm ruler ( a gimmick which made the boss fight easy ) and relating it to siegward 's questline ( you got an interesting cutscene , at least ) . 
  ** throne watcher , throne defender ** : two bipedal humans that will slowly walk to you and attack . 
  this one breaks my heart as i actually like the designs , but the things that are supposed to make this fight unique are so laughably inconsequential . 
  they buff their sword at 50 % health , so basically just a flat damage boost , but you were playing cautiously anyway because you were outnumbered . 
  watcher does have magic attacks , but he uses them so infrequently i forgot he had them , i only knew that because i quickly looked him up . 
  the mechanic where if one is down , he will be revived in 20 seconds by the other is another pointless addition as the only challenge is fighting two of them , once one is down you can easily take out the other one . 
  ** smelter demon ** : bipedal human that will slowly walk to you and attack . 
  despite the scary design and passive damage in the third phase ( which i still think is a bad design choice ) , he is n't as tough or complex as he looks . 
  he does have some hard-hitting moves and aoe attacks , but most of his uniqueness comes in his visual design rather than anything to do with his moveset , disregarding the aforementioned passive damage . 
  i know what i wrote was pretty long , but i have to admit that i 'm not entirely convinced that you actually read it . 
  i specifically mentioned liking aspects of design and atmosphere from pursuer , ruin sentinels , velstadt , and tw+td , and then saying that it was disappointing because they could have been more than just interesting designs . 
  dancer has more moves in her first phase alone than smelter demon has in his entirety . 
  if fextralife is anything to go by , smelter demon has 6 moves in total and dancer has 8 in her first phase and another 8 in her second . 
  `` does n't actually do many actions '' lmao . 
  i know you 're trying to defend dark souls 2 's bosses but you need to come up with points that are actually true . 
  and for twin princes , i really had to search to think of other bosses in games i 've fought that fight by teleport spamming into attacks . 
  the only ones i could think of were imlerith from witcher 3 , pthumerian elder from bloodborne even though he does n't really attack from it , and possibly monsoon from mgr : r even though you 're supposed to keep blocking there rather than strike back . 
  i do n't feel like dignifying what you said about lothric with a response . 
  you know and i know that lothric makes the fight significantly harder . 
  and please do not speak for me about `` when you fight the bosses , they feel different '' . 
  i 've played ds2 for 225 hours but that 's still less than how much i 've played bb and ds1 . 
  and if you 're going to say `` ds3 boss designs may have unique visuals , but they really fall flat on their face with their movesets . 
  especially wolnir . 
  '' , then i 'm going to have to remind you of many of the ds2 bosses that had literally nothing going for them . 
  incredibly pointless and inconsequential bosses like covetous demon and prowling magus could have been omitted entirely and no one would have noticed or cared . 
  dancer was very clearly designed to be very counter-intuitive to fight . 
  the amount of times she attacks in the first phase was probably to do with this , as the standard procedure is to wait for an attack then punish afterward and she instead takes a while to attack so the player might get greedy and decide to attack just before she decides to swing . 
  they may have overdone it , but it was definitely purposeful . 
  what you 've said about lothric is true , but that does n't make it any simpler . 
  the fight is definitely more difficult solo due to homing magic spam and lorian being behind you pretty much all the time . 
  the heal-wotg thing is another concept made to punish greedy players . 
  as it 's lothric 's health bar that needs to deplete to beat the boss , adding a mechanic that allows the player to do a lot of damage if they 're willing to try and avoid the blast at the last second does a lot for raising the skill ceiling . 
  imagine if lorian just statically healed to full and lothric just chunked for , say , 1/5 . 
  mirror knight was by far the most marketed boss in the entirety of ds2 and while the concept was certainly interesting , they really should have thought about it a bit more , because it 's a lot like gravelording in ds1 . 
  sounds cool in theory , but no one does it because it falls apart in practice . 
  mirror knight only summoning players in ng + was the first shot in the foot as that drastically cut down the available invade targets . 
  not only that , if someone is just trying to get through the game , they are n't going to let mirror knight summon , they 'll burn an effigy or go offline , because trying to 1v1 an invader while the boss is also swinging around is pretty much textbook unfair , especially since the npc summons he has are pretty deficient . 
  inversely , this means the only people who will actually fight a mirror knight squire will be ganksquads as they actually have a chance . 
  on one of the rare occasions i actually got summoned as a squire , i literally instantly died from 3 lightning spears at once that i could not avoid , back when miracles in ds2 were actually worth a damn . 
  bravo , b-team . 
  his only other claim to fame is the mirror shield which makes the fight more annoying for magic users . 
  now , they have to wait until he 's vulnerable until they can pelt them with whatever they have , forgetting that the playstyle already basically involved that . 
  i suspect the objective of the shield was to make it harder for magic users to cheese him to death but still have magic viable , but this could have been accomplished by giving him fast gap-closing moves rather than his super long wind-up jump that i do n't think anyone 's ever been hit by . 
  he 's a more varied and unique boss than most of the bosses in base game ds2 , but most of that is owed to his pvp gimmick . 
  and i 'm not sure what the sulyvahn crocodile beast did to deserve being compared to magus and congregation . 
  he has many purposes , functioning as a beef gate , a part of sirris ' questline , a way to get the right eye ring , and also as somewhat simple but punishing miniboss which is exacerbated by the fact that if you run away from him , then he 'll come down and fight you down in the water where you 're at a disadvantage . 
  magus and congregation on the other hand , are literally just a bunch of dudes in the way . 
  you beat them , you get a titanite slab , and that 's it . 
  i know that . 
  the b-team thing is really just a meme , but there was a substantial drop in quality of ds2 and i suspect much of it was to do with both the director switch and that neither of those directors were miyazaki . 
  i would n't go that far . 
  huge damage and great moveset . 
  i helped with abyss watchers on release day , and the amount of second phase cutscenes i saw was really telling . 
  the secret ( maybe ? 
  it 's still kinda hard to pull off but you might find it easier ) is that pontiff can be parried . 
  that 's better than dragonrider . 
  you can beat him in the first few seconds of his fight by rolling a single time . 
  just before you 're about to get hit , you hit the parry button . 
  the idea is that you get hit while you 're pushing your shield away . 
  do n't listen to the crazies . 
  the first is much better than the second . 
  like , way better . 
  such as ? 
  i 'm using a keyboard and i have yet to run into anything i could n't do . 
  did they ask for someone with a degree in theoretical videogame physics ? 
  when you compare the difficulty of the games to other triple as that come out these days , then souls comes out on top . 
  not really because its hard , but because the others are easy that it makes it look hard by comparison . 
  he also ca n't be parried into irrelevance like gwyn could . 
  i was a bit disappointed by that , actually . 
  are you going to do all the bosses like this ?
