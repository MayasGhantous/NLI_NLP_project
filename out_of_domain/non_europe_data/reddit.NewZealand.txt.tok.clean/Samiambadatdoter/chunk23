  but let 's be real : ds3 has no risk/reward . 
  just throw yourself off the cliff after each bossfight and ember + finger before the next boss for maximum boss summons . 
  better yet , put down your own white sign at the door and get a preview of what the boss does . 
  not denying this , but i do think bb did it the `` best '' ( even if invasions will always be impossible to balance , one party will always be disadvantaged ) , and that was , you summon , you can be invaded . 
  there were still twinks , in fact twinks in bb could reach astounding levels of power though it was very rare , but at least a fight with a twink would always be a 2v1 unless you 're in nf or you rang your sinister bell . 
   the first is that this was n't introduced until sotfs , so for much of the game 's lifespan , sm reigned supreme and the noob meta flourished free from higher meta influence . 
  vets that wanted to hunt noobs were forced to remake new characters eventually due to the souls they gained from invasion kills anyways ... and since creos are of limited supply , might as well start a new character every time and take advantage of the free creos in the starting area . 
  this is one of my points , people can still twink if they really want to , twinks are inevitable . 
   try having an early character attack a well armored vit-stacking twink with sunlight straightsword buff , plus low stat req utility buffs , and raw endgame weapon +2 and full rings and tell me how many times your early character will run out of stamina from spamming r1 . 
  so twinks exist in ds3 . 
  and is that really a bad thing ? 
  you 're already advantaged by being in ember form , twice as much estus , and being able to summon phantoms and using wob , as well as giant seed and being able to beeline for the boss fog or even being able to do a good ol' fashioned disconnect . 
  twinks are not even nearly as big a deal as from and half the whiny as hell western userbase seem to think . 
  sure , you 're likely to die if you come across one , but that 's literally the one single downside to being embered and it stops happening past the early game ( as in , past the easy areas ) . 
  it is a minor issue that was n't worth the lengths b-team went to try and stop it . 
  * people who are having a difficult time getting through the game and are having their sm inflated by dying and not picking up their souls . 
  * people who want to help with early game areas/bosses and assist new players . 
  * people who want to purposefully stay at a low level . 
  * people who want to play with their friends ( because name-engraved does n't completely eliminate sm ), 
  * people who want to do gimmick/cosplay/consumable heavy builds in pvp . 
  * people who do n't want the game to decide their build for them . 
  sm is an inexorable march forward , it 's like the win10 update , good if you were going to do it anyway , an intrusive annoyance if you 're not . 
  taking power away from the player is something that should be avoided , especially in a series like souls . 
  here 's what sm helps :, 
  * makes it harder to twink, 
  * and that 's it, 
   so you 've been given ample reasons why sm is good, 
   what you 're basically telling me is that pvp is not one of your personal priorities . 
  not sure where you got this assumption . 
  i pvp 'd a lot in 1 , a lot in bb ( to the point where i 'd only play it to pvp ) and a decent amount in 3 as well . 
  i did n't pvp much in 2 because the bell and rat covenants turned me off pvp really quickly . 
  soul memory does have merit as one of the better precautions against twinks , but i 've said this and i 'll say it again , ** twinking is not that big of an issue ** , certainly not worth treading on the builds and playstyles of many other characters . 
  and i appreciate the irony of you saying that i do n't want to see the good of sm while simultaneously saying, 
   i conversely care comparatively little about the struggles of pvers who summon for everything , roleplayers who want to do so without putting in effort , those who want to `` help '' new players by thrashing content with exotic items effectively ruining their first impression of the pve , those who would rather whine than adapt to the challenge of increasingly tougher opponents . 
  so all your points you list as sm hindrances either do n't matter to me , or i 'm willing to mitigate . 
  translation : i could n't give less of a fuck about people who want to play the game differently to how i do . 
  i can understand trying to do something to limit twinking as they roamed free as spring lambs in the first game , but soul memory was ** not ** the solution . 
  mm works because it works as a troll covenant without completely dicking over the recipient . 
  and why is stoping twinks so important ? 
  why do you care so much about the misfortune of new players which they indirectly inflict on themselves ? 
  it is really worth screwing over all those other types of players so people who get invaded early have an easier time ? 
  if you really cared about new players so much , why do you then care `` comparitively little '' about players who are having a tough time or want to summon their friends to help them ? 
  it works on ps4 as well . 
  make another account , as long as it 's your primary ps4 then you 'll be able to play online . 
  i hope not . 
  it 's already the best katana for all but pure dex where the chaos blade slightly wins out . 
  i doubt it 's getting a nerf . 
  just because it 's an above-average axe ( when the butcher knife is the best axe anyway ) does n't mean much when the axe category is n't exactly meta . 
  they 're definitely going to . 
  there 's no way the darkdrift is balanced in the state it 's in now . 
  the damage is low and the weapon art far too telegraphed . 
  have n't heard anything from xbox , i 'm afraid . 
  and how do you know that twinks lead to people being turned off pvp ? 
  i pity the new player that walks into doors of pharros unknowingly than having to deal with any twink . 
  unless it is the day of release , just about everyone will lose their first invasion simply because the invader was more experience . 
  also , the games have always been pve centric , that is the design of the game , and that is what from caters towards because that 's what the japanese audience wants . 
  the whole fight clubbing , dueling thing with an actual focus on pvp is a western thing that is not a priority for from . 
  and how can you speak for everyone who gets invaded by a twink ? 
  how do you know their reaction is `` that was super unfair , i 'm never going to pvp '' rather than `` wow , that guy was super strong . 
  i want to be like him '' ? 
  not really . 
  they are n't used in pvp because damage per hit is low and the combos are asking to be parried . 
  range is n't long either . 
  warden twinblades see more use because of the bleed gimmick they have , but in general , twin curved swords got the short end of the stick . 
  i generated a lot of salt with that game by having two single missile slow-moving rocket launchers and firing one , swapping , and firing the other . 
  fun , but there really were only a handful of good weapon combos . 
  why ? 
  do n't bother . 
  even though it has an s in dex at sharp +10 , it sucks . 
  ar and range are very low . 
  immolation tinder looks more like a burning cross ( especially as it 's actually burning ) , and the soldering iron sucks as a weapon, 
  huh . 
  til . 
  i 'm trying to find that one , actually . 
  e : thanks for the downvotes , guys . 
  [ this is the one i was talking about . 
  ] ( https://giant.gfycat.com/animateddifferentaustralianfreshwatercrocodile.mp4 ), 
  the hell makes you think mei and s76 would share the same bones ? 
  with the blizzard production quality we 're talking about , i bet every single character 's bones are considerably different , even the similar bodytypes like mccree and reaper . 
  still ca n't find it , my dude . 
  i saw that one , and he did n't actually fall off , he stops just before he does . 
  i 'm talking about one where he actually does fall off ( to his death ) at the beginning and the camera follows him while his turret gets a bunch of kills . 
  it was posted here around the time of the last closed beta but i ca n't find it . 
  it was pretty upvoted at the time so i assumed that was the one he was talking about . 
  ~ ~ i 'd even understand the downvotes but torbjorn very clearly does not fall off in that clip . 
  it 's like they did n't actually watch it . ~ ~ shit nevermind, 
  bloodshed ( as in literally showing blood from wounds ) is enough to increase something 's rating from t to m. 
  that 's my point . 
  you can destroy robots any way you like because no blood will be shed , they 're robots . 
  omnics are not flesh and blood , no , so they can get slaughtered mercilessly and the game will retain its t rating . 
  someones been listening to twi 's nonsense a bit too much . 
  game development does indeed take this long if you 're disorganised and inefficient , like twi . 
  consider one of the best and most richly detailed rpgs to come out recently , bloodborne , took 3 years to make . 
  if a company that 's maybe twice the size of twi can put out a game of that scale in 3 years , then twi really has n't got an excuse seeing as they 've probably been working on kf2 since ro2 dropped back in 2011 . 
  this guy is just a trick shooter , though . 
  he looks very impressive but he would n't be terribly good in an actual pitched battle . 
  sharp carthus curved sword will have the best performance out of those because of how much damage it deals . 
  i had an inkling that there was something was up with mercy 's pistol . 
  when i tested firing shots and swapping back and forth , it was the same , but for some reason was always fully loaded if i pulled it out in a fight even if i had used it already . 
  this clears things up .
