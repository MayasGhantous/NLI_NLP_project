  orochi are worth 100 . 
  you 'll find it as a thread in / vg / . 
  the g means `` general '' , so it 's just an abbreviation . 
  for instance , / r6g / = rainbow 6 general , / dsg / = dark souls general , etc. 
  sly . 
  i see you know your statistics . 
  that makes sense . 
  spanish is descended from latin . 
  the word `` enemy '' comes from `` inimicus '' . 
  did . . he actually say this ? 
  this seems so mindbogglingly stupid i ca n't believe it . 
  why on earth would you want a healthcare plan that does n't cover anything ? 
  i saw it from a meme in which , mocking an isis-style execution photo , had a muslim on his knees and a crusader-style knight standing next to him .

  it definitely feels like it was designed to be some kind of warning , but was written by someone who either did n't know how grammar works or used a translator . 
  cool , thanks for your time . 
  what ? 
  his charge costs about 60 % of his stamina . 
  alright , i understand that . 
  what about `` miserere '' ? 
  why does it appear to be an infinitive instead of an imperative ? 
  that 's a little confusing , but does clear it up . 
  thanks !, 
  what about it 's `` true '' imperative form ? 
  i think the `` paper walls , no match for steel '' was dumber , honestly . 
  assuming you actually like playing dominion , that one is actually one of the easier ones . 
  or well , it would be , but then i saw your flair . 
  or you could just buy the dlc , that is the point of the season passes . 
  the alternative is having dlc operators completely off limits to those who do n't have the season pass , and that is a terrible idea for obvious reasons . 
  this is why the game is p2p , by the way . 
  connection is n't an issue unless there 's packet loss . 
  understand that i 'm not that well versed in latin , so if someone professing more experience than me says something else , they 're probably right . 
  with that said :, 
  petrus sanctius bartolus is the name of the artist , the words proceeding are art terminology meaning he both drew the image and made the print . 
  they translate to something like `` drew , did '' . 
  a `` sacrum '' is a religious rite , so a sacrifice or a prayer or something , perhaps . 
  `` apollini '' means that they 're doing it for him , so `` apollini sacrum '' = `` rite to apollo '' . 
  really ? 
  what 's an example ? 
  the first part is right as far as i know . 
  `` creabunt '' is 3rd person plural future . 
  `` they will create '' rather than `` you will create '' , which would be `` creabitis '' or `` creabis '' depending on if you 're talking to more than one ( the former ) or just one ( the latter ) . 
  music is also a feminine noun , so it should be `` vestra '' , i think . 
  '' - um '' for possessives indicates a neutral noun , and `` musica '' is feminine . 
  right you are . 
  `` creabitis '' , which is annoyingly close to `` creabatis '' when you 're me and are n't paying attention . 
  i 've edited my original post . 
  yet the right-wing of the us is absurdly hyper-capitalist . 
  women prioritise careers over family because these days , they * must * ( especially in the us ) , you ca n't provide for a whole family these days if there is just one earner unless he is paid * very * well , and if these hurr durr bootstrap people do too much damage , the us will end up like japan with a very low birthrate because women literally can not fit children into their lives . 
  unironically the christian `` allah ackbar '' . 
  the connotations are almost exact . 
  amendment : it has the exact same connotations `` allahu ackbar '' has in the way it is typically understood culturally by the west, 
  you missed my point . 
  to expand on what the other guy said , the first ( venite et videte ) would be said to more than one person , while the second would be said to only one . 
  as for your second request , `` certa me '' or `` me certa '' could work . 
  `` te videbo in latere alio '' , perhaps . 
  understand that this is a very literal translation , and while i doubt that that matters too much as idioms are only truly effective to native speakers , and none exist for latin , there might be someone around who could translate it for you with more metaphorical language . 
  note that you can play around with the word order a bit if it suits you . 
  `` in latere alio , videbo te '' would work , for instance . 
  are you somehow implying that all the tech `` experts '' spouting `` we need dedis '' know what they are talking about ? 
  but lol does require you to grind for ingame stats . 
  quite a lot , actually . 
  runes . 
  while it 's not as bad as it used to be ( when t2s were n't 1 ip per ) , it is definitely a grind to get t3s , and the difference between no runes and t3 is n't trivial . 
  * my * point is that lol has a huge amount of grind for full pages of t3 , and some runes ( eg spell vamp , move speed quints ) are extremely expensive , and while it is an argument for another day , lol also has significant grinding to unlock characters while for honor does not . 
  and here we have a great example of an `` expert '' . 
  do n't worry , it 's not you . 
  people always think they have a clearer idea of networking and client-server connecitons than they really do ( it 's a lot harder and more complicated than you 'd think ) . 
  the thing with dedis is that it is n't just dedi good p2p bad , dedi performance gets worse and worse the more frame-perfect things need to be . 
  there is a reason fighting games are p2p even though they could be on dedis , and that reason is because the client-side information needs to match up as quick as it can with incoming player information . 
  receiving information about other players from a server will always be slower than receiving it from them directly , and it you want an example of how bad this can get , you need look no further than bf3 & 4 on release , those two games had significant problems with dusting , single-frame deaths , phantoms etc , and battlefield is not even an arena-style twitch shooter . 
  with the kind of game for honor is , there is a * requirement * for frame-perfect data , because difference between a parried light attack and a momentary drop of guard from starting a heavy in an attempt to parry will mean the difference between life and death , and in a duel mode , that is literally half your allowed deaths . 
  my point originally was that there is a significant grind for stat bonuses in lol , and that still holds true because tier 3 runes are very expensive . 
  i would like to say that those two arguments for the grind to unlock characters are hilariously weak , and basically boil down to `` you probably do n't need to play them anyway '' . 
  it is literally the same argument that ubi is using for the slow steel gain rate . 
  and duel modes are also 1v1 . 
  the amount of players is n't relevant to the point i 'm trying to make . 
  dedicated servers would be at their most efficient with just two players as there is a lot of free bandwidth in order to quickly exchange data . 
  thinking that the connection issues arise from p2p and not game-specific bugs and poor handling of host migration is not correct . 
  p2p does suffer from one bad apple spoiling the bunch , but that is n't a failing of p2p itself . 
  people with poor connections to dedicated servers instead impact gameplay in ways that do n't happen in p2p . 
  poor connectivity and lag compensation ca n't be fixed by changing paradigm , because that is choosing between host migration crashing games , or low ping players having tangible frame advantages and high ping players being dusted , teleporting , and having hits/gbs land that otherwise should not have because your client and the server do n't agree with what he is doing . 
  in short , bad netcode wo n't be fixed by just switching over to dedicated servers . 
  you are trading one set of problems with another . 
  they have this weird complex that there is `` new '' kind of man these days , that is much less manly ( think of all the `` college safe space '' nonsense they love talking about ) and are impotent `` cucks '' . 
  learning german 's not so bad . 
  when you finally decide to speak with actual germans and they bombard you with a million dialectal colloquialisms , you suddenly realise why there is a popular german proverb that is , almost literally , `` german is hard '' . 
  the first one . 
  i 'm very familiar with it . 
  that was fast !, 
  was n't expecting something so quick . 
  thank you dearly . 
  the \u00de is called a `` thorn '' in english . 
  it used to be part of written english in medieval times . 
  2 looks pretty sensible , i guess . 
  the `` peractu '' in his sentence is n't necessary , basically . 
  just `` diuturnis quam censebam '' will work on its own . 
  however , you can add `` peractu '' in order to give emphasis . 
  roughly , it would be `` it look longer [ to complete ] than i thought '' . 
  always ?
