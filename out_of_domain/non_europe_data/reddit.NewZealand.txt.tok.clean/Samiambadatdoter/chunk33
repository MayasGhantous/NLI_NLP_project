  i looked up `` credo '' in wiktionary , and it contained the following usage note . 
   cr\u0113d\u014d often uses dative case with persons believed in , but accusative case with things or concepts believed in . 
  accusative usage may be accompanied by a preposition : cr\u0113dimus in deum = `` we believe in god '' . 
  or are they wrong in this case ? 
  ah alright , that makes sense . 
  i was n't able to see the deleted comment . 
  actually , not really . 
  nobushi 's damage per hit is on the higher end , and she can confirm a 38 damage top heavy on a gb alone , which is the highest a hero can do without stuff like wallstuns . 
  what makes nobushi 's damage `` low '' is that she 's relatively difficult to combo with , generally , because she is slow and somewhat predictable , as well as her fast moves ( like dash heavy/light ) either bleeding or doing a relatively low amount of damage . 
  i have n't the foggiest how you managed to get `` genesis autem nodus '' from `` origin of a difficult problem '' . 
  it means more like `` birth but knot '' or something . 
  `` birth of a difficult problem '' is more like `` genesis quaestionis difficilis '' , though `` quaestio '' means more like inquiry than problem . 
  fatality of music could be something like `` fata musicae '' , and `` fata '' could possibly be replaced with `` casus '' or `` mors '' . 
  i find bandits are harder than monolith . 
  sure , freedom is neutral rather than hostile , but consider that monolith are numerous and have a huge amount of the best equipped and experienced stalkers , they basically have unanimous dominion over the northmost part of the map . 
  having the ability to get someone with a vss and exo to be your companion no strings attached is a pretty powerful boon , and even clashes with the more advanced factions ( like mercs ) usually end in monolith victories . 
  bandits , however , are stuck in places like garbage , sandwiched between factions that will shoot at them . 
  the average bandit is also far less well equipped than the average monolith . 
  now all we need is to draw a circle of golden stars there, 
  that line will forever bother me , because `` no superstes '' does n't make sense . 
  it 's either not what he 's saying and people repeating it are wrong , or it * is * what he 's saying and ubisoft got it wrong . 
  read from what ? 
  to say that using reason to back up arguments is `` verbally strongarming '' is ridiculous . 
  agreed . 
  there are literally a million nutjobs in america right now who hoard guns because there was a ( successful ) smear campaign against obama and now they 're paranoid as all get out that the government will come take their guns . 
  not interested in arguing semantics . 
  if you really need your collection of projectile weaponry literally expressly designed to end human life efficiently , then go right ahead . 
  i will still call you a hoarder and weird , however . 
  bah , they barely even speak latin . 
  all they know are two words and they ca n't pronounce the second one correctly . 
  t. someone taking latin at uni, 
  not really , no . 
  we know that caesar would have pronounced his name `` ky-zar '' , from measures of poems , surviving writings from teachers , analyzing word etymology from romance languages and loan words that got into germanic languages , etc , however it is a somewhat recent development . 
  throughout the middle ages , latin used a lot in religious environments in what is called `` ecclesiastical latin '' which is pronounced as if the latin words were italian , and has a few different grammar rules . 
  uh ... r/titlegore ? 
  as no one else has tried , i 'll give it a go :, 
  might want to hold on to see if anyone has anything to add first though . 
  i do n't know where would be the best place to ask , but i may as well start here . 
  to put a long story short , i 've found myself volunteering as something of a counsellor , or at least someone to talk to , whenever someone i know is dealing with depression . 
  generally , i try to be sympathetic and do what i can to cheer them up , but it 's becoming increasingly obvious to me that i do n't really know what i 'm doing . 
  are there any good resources on good ways to deal with depressed people ? 
  obviously , i do n't think i could actually compare to a professional therapist , but i also can not force people to see therapists themselves , so i want to help as best i can . 
  catullus 5 was literally given as an example in the op 's post of something that his partner does n't like . 
  have an upvote from a latin student, 
  there 's an entire list of them on wikipedia . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_latin_phrases_ ( full ), 
  some of them are used more than others , but these are all used in * some * capacity in the english-speaking world . 
  - afd idiot in der n\u00e4he, 
  but do n't you understand , my dear redditor , that saying `` white people smell like mayo '' is racism akin to apartheid ? 
  that is such a strange way of thinking . 
  if , hypothetically , a certain concept of item was n't invented at the time we know it was , that does n't mean to say that it will * never * be invented . 
  to say `` without the chinese , society would n't have paper '' is bizarre , especially since there are historical societies who independently had their own concepts of writing on plain , thin material . 
  textbook case of a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
  they have a song called `` the final solution '' , which they stopped playing at concerts because they believed seeing so many people headbanging to a song about the holocaust was too disturbing . 
  additionally they have songs praising the following ; soviets ( night wiches ) , polish army during ww2 ( 40-1 ) , 101st airborne ( screaming eagles ) , norwegian ww2 resistance ( saboteurs ) , and a lot of pre-20th century armies like kingdom of scotland ( blood of bannockburn ) and the imperial japanese army ( shiroyama ) , just for a few examples . 
  additionally , they have songs mourning the allied losses such as cliffs of gallipoli and price of a mile . 
  the american way to measures how much of a badass you are is from how many muslims you 've killed . 
  see : american sniper . 
  you can see remnants of that in other countries ' homosexuality laws , even . 
  a fair few countries have only outlawed male sexuality ( eg ghana , mauritius , swaziland , malaysia , turkmenistan , kuwait ), 
  they 're bolsheviks !, 
  and while you 're at it , stop saying `` deus vult '' . 
  you barely know what it means and probably ca n't pronounce it correctly . 
  it 's a bit of a funny story . 
  `` deus vult '' is the correct way to say it because it makes grammatical and semantic sense , and `` deus lo vult '' does not . 
  `` deus lo vult '' , as far as i know , arrived from a misunderstanding from what the crusaders thought they heard , because they did n't speak latin . 
  they already do that . 
  sometimes the zeds do n't get far enough out of the way , though , and get hit anyway . 
  yeah , the us never dies things out of tradition . 
  please ignore all the confederate flags and the whole 2nd amendment thing . 
  ashe is truly amazing , he 's in a league of his own . 
  altered state would n't have been nearly as amazing if he was n't singing . 
  elliott was good too , as well , but he only sang for that one ep . 
  nice !, 
  i , too , combed out my dreadlocks in january last year . 
  took me and my family a very long and quite painful time , but it was better than being bald . 
  absolutely agree . 
  i voted `` no '' on the nz flag referendum , and there was nothing less mature or not `` grown up '' about my decision to keep the flag looking like something that did n't belong on a beach towel . 
  there are products you can use . 
  knotty boy has a `` dread removal kit '' that they sell , which is what i used . 
  it 's a liquid lotion-like solution . 
  basically , mix it with warm water and rinse it , and it will make the wax soft enough that you 'll be able to work through it , if that makes sense . 
  it takes a while , basically what you are doing is reverse backcombing , going through with a needle ( think more like a knitting needle , not a sewing machine needle ) and physically straightening out each knot individually . 
  it can take a very long time . 
  the longer your hair is , and the longer you 've had the dreads , the time to get them out will increase exponentially . 
  you 'll have to physically remove a lot of the wax yourself ( or rather get someone else to , as it 's hard to use a needle on the back of your head ) , but after a while , your hair will be fine . 
  it makes me sad that this comment is n't satire . 
  that was literally , unironically his train of thought . 
  `` you will not do the thing you want to do if you do n't try to do it '', 
  whoa , so motivational !, 
  i wonder what their reactions were to the part where you literally have to crossdress in order to pass a story mission in botw . 
  i 'm quite glad about that . 
  there is n't a snowball 's chance in hell that afd will win . 
  aaaaaagh , it burns, 
  `` in fermentation we trust '' = * fervorem credimus *, 
  `` truth in fermentation '' = * in fervore veritas *, 
  i believe using `` credo '' in this way is ecclesiastical rather than classical latin , but it 's valid nonetheless . 
  the poster that i have linked claims that an omitted object implies a reflexive , so it would mean `` i fear [ myself ] '' . 
  not sure if that 's actually something you could do , though . 
  a reflexive object being omitted would change the sentence quite dramatically .
