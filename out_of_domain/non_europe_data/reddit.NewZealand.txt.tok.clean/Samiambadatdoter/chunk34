  first , cool . 
  thanks for the explanation , i had a suspicion that the apposition was probably technically correct , but i always see apposition with two nominatives ( eg ; marcus , meus amicus ) , so perhaps i just did n't recognise it . 
  for the context if you are interested , `` nox '' in the sense of the game means more like `` darkness '' rather than `` night '' , as the creation myth for humans involves them being born from darkness , and as such darkness is revered by the game 's equivalent of religious institutions . 
  the person who says it is a priestess , and the rest of her dialogue is in english . 
  she uses it solely as a farewell , so the full quote is `` be safe , farewell . 
  vereor nox '' , which is probably what lead the person i linked to think that the omitted object was reflexive , so it would mean something like , `` i , the darkness , fear myself '' . 
  seems more like looking too deep into a construction that was probably erroneous in the first place . 
  even if it is grammatically correct , it would be a bit strange to talk about yourself in a farewell . 
  neither . 
  i believe that the original latin was just plain wrong and was supposed to mean something else entirely , and he is just trying to find a way for it to make sense . 
  and i 'm pretty sure he made up the rest of the countries . 
  i do n't think there is anyone in canada or sweden seriously considering moving towards free market healthcare . 
  actually more common than you 'd think among those who do n't have english as a first language . 
  the `` th '' sound is known in the linguistics field as the `` dental non-sibilant fricative '' , and is actually quite rare among languages . 
  walking and gathering around fires , two uniquely american cultural activities . 
  well , `` place '' is already from an intransparent latin root , `` platea '' . 
  a little late , but that line is '' \u00fe\u00fa ert dau\u00f0ur '' , pronounced something like `` thu ert day-dur '' . 
  both berserker genders put a weird emphasis on the line , though . 
  where are you getting `` prote '' meaning `` destroy '' from ? 
  i 'm looking up my usual sources ( wiktionary , whitaker 's words , which is telling me that it means `` first '' etc ) and the closest i can find is `` perdo '' ( imperative `` perde '' ) , but that does n't take an `` in '' , just a regular accusative , ie `` mors , perde eum '' . 
  you have n't been paying attention to the meta at all if you think valk and hibana are bad . 
  they are serious contenders for the best operators in the game . 
  this kind of thing needs to stop , i know negareddit loves getting salty about absolutely anything that they can involve what they believe to be reddit 's core demographic with , but usually the reasons are fairly decent . 
  this is not one of those times . 
  claiming that whites are bad because they judge poc as monolithic blocks and then doing the * exact * same thing yourself is not being helpful or constructive in any way , to say nothing of being massively hypocritical . 
  you have absolutely no self-awareness whatsoever if you think you can say unbridled stupidity like this and then go on to think that you 're not part of the problem . 
  i 'm going to assume you 're a native english speaker , so the concept of grammatical gender might be a little bit confusing or arbitrary ( it certainly is to me ) . 
  in english , we gender nouns based on their * natural * gender . 
  we only use `` he '' or `` she '' if the object we are talking about actually has a gender , so usually when we 're talking about living things . 
  for everything else , we use the neuter gender . 
  in latin ( and in a significant amount of other languages , actually . 
  most european languages do this ) , gender between words is relatively arbitrary . 
  in latin , * porta * is a feminine word because it just is , even if there 's no real reason for it , so it is described with the feminine versions of adjectives , and it would be referred to as a `` she '' in writing . 
  to make matters worse , languages disagree all the time on what gender a noun with a natural gender should be . 
  in latin , * porta * is feminine , but in spanish , * puente * is masculine , because there 's no real way to agree on what the gender of a random object like that should be . 
  there are patterns in latin ; many objects that are created in some way are feminine ( domus , taberna , navis , porta ) , many actor nouns are masculine ( miles , poeta , agricola ) , and many concepts or ideas are neuter ( pax , nomen , bellum ) but these are n't really comprehensive . 
  you basically just have to memorise them . 
  you 've done a fantastic job assuming a whole bunch about me without knowing anything about me . 
  i do n't even live in the same hemisphere as the us and was born in a country where `` spite for the white man '' racism ( just like yours ) completely destroyed the economy and the livelihood of everyone involved . 
  23m people are going to lose healthcare , yes , that 's a scary and well-known statistic , and you 're using it as a justification to do the * exact same thing * you accused `` white men '' of doing and actively engaging in widening the rift that is causing this problem in the first place . 
  you do n't care about that , though , by your own words , you care about offending . 
  i 'm not blaming poc . 
  i 'm blaming * you * . 
  * you 're * the one doing it . 
  there is n't even anyone else in this conversation right now , so bringing up other people is irrelevant . 
  disagreeing with people on the internet is not white privilege . 
  i 'm going to interpret what you just said as some sort of concession because it has no value otherwise . 
  and * you * have been relentless in assigning blame to a monolithic entity and then concluding that you do n't care if anyone takes issue with such blatant , boneheaded hypocrisy . 
  ideologically , there is no difference between you and the boogeyman you 've set up for yourself , which even actually exists but you decided to remove all nuance from the concepts of white privilege and institutional racism because being offensive is more important to you . 
  also , fantastic job of speaking for everyone else . 
  this is a conversation between me , you , and so far , no one else . 
  `` you are not fooling anyone '' does nothing but tell me that you need the opinions of others ( that you do n't actually have ) to actually appear valid , and even that is disingenuous considering that you posted this thread in one of the subreddits most likely to agree with you and you 're still getting dissenting opinions , with this very thread at less than 60 % upvotes . 
  do n't worry , i already figured out earlier that you were n't actually going to change your mind because being intellectually honest is hard . 
  you just needed to vent poorly worded frustrations to a place where you did n't want to meet disagreements . 
  i just had a revelation . 
  it might be `` prode '' , imperative of `` prodere '' , which can be translated to `` project '' , `` thrust forward '' , `` go forth '' etc. 
  thus ; `` mors , prode in eum '' might be `` death , go forth into him '' . 
  sounds a bit awkward , but it could be possible . 
  well , this is the same company that got the case wrong for the `` inimicus '' line , and completely bungled the `` no superstes '' line , so it might not fit the context well but i would n't discount it entirely . 
  it 's very likely they looked up `` go forth '' or something and `` prodo '' came up . 
  china circlejerk 2 . 
  depending on the map , that is n't always the case . 
  a skilled heli pilot on dawnbreaker can avoid stinger missiles for days, 
  if you 'd like , you could spell it with a j , `` juste '' rather than `` iuste '' . 
  would still be pronounced the same , though . 
  do n't use google translate for latin again , it 's fine for individual words and maybe short common phrases , but it generally does n't work very well . 
  that sentence comes out to something like ;, 
  `` truly , we are made a star from furniture '' , it 's close but comes across as garbled . 
  i would translate it as , perhaps ;, 
  `` matierieus stellarum sumus '' , which would mean something like `` we are made of materials of stars . '', 
  i 've never understood the point of `` baiting '' a vegetarian ( and similar kinds of baiting , like tricking someone who does n't drink to have a cocktail that has a bit of alcohol in it ) . 
  what do they think will happen , that the vegetarian in question will suddenly have a world-shattering breakdown ? 
  people are still playing and modding morrowind , actually . 
  that game came out in 2002 . 
  i 'm growing increasingly tired of hearing about the `` usefulness '' of latin . 
  why does it need to be `` useful '' ? 
  who or what decides something is useful , and why does that mean it should be worth preserving/learning ? 
  there are a few other ways , one that you could use is `` necesse est '' , meaning `` it is necessary '' . 
  `` necesse est vitae habere sua mysteria '' would be one possible rendering , `` it is necessary for life to have its mysteries '' . 
  `` oportet '' and `` decet '' could also be used . 
  they 're verbs that only use the 3rd person and mean something like `` it is proper '' or something . 
  also , with `` vitae '' , that is also the dative singular , which can mean `` to/for life '' . 
  in perspective , with a sentence that went `` it is necessary for life '' , the `` for life '' bit is the dative . 
  this is the kind of thing socrates was poisoned for . 
  one of the dumbest additions to battlefield 4 , in my opinion . 
  i do n't see what was wrong with the bf3 knifing system , and i 'm not sure why dice thought that having your close-range option effectively be suicide was a good idea . 
  it is , effectively , impossible not to die when knifing from the front because the prompt is * incredibly * generous . 
  someone comes at you with a knife in real life and you are not 110 % ready for it , you 're brown bread . 
  knives are incredibly lethal and agile weapons ( even moreso than people think ) , and the only way you 'd be able to stop someone with a knife from cutting you up is to shoot them before they get to you , and even then , you have to be aiming and ready for them . 
  attempting to gunbutt will get you killed , guns make for very limited melee weapons . 
  i played through a bit with kb+m as i 'm a purist , but had to switch to controller . 
  the game 's controls are just fundamentally broken on kb+m . 
  having to double-tap movement keys to dodge is just ridiculous , and it means that you virtually ca n't dodge to the side while moving forward , and there will always be a delay to any dodge you make , which will completely kill hard/very hard runs because your dodging has to be absolutely on point . 
  well , that 's a correct usage of `` whose '' so i think that 's enough proof that he 's at least smarter than his opposition . 
  `` silum canem '' means `` snub-nosed dog '' rather than pug . 
  pugs were brought to europe in the 16th century , which means that you probably wo n't find a word referring to that breed of dog specifically in any classical latin dictionaries . 
  mixing english and latin that way is n't generally advisable but you could get away with it because `` corgi '' is preceded by a preposition . 
  you would be understood but it would stand out as peculiar . 
  `` corgi '' does n't exist in latin , but you could make it a neologism , perhaps , which could possibly be done by making it `` corgus '' and having it be a 2nd declension masculine noun . 
  in this case , `` genua omnia ingeniculent ante corgum '' would be correct .
