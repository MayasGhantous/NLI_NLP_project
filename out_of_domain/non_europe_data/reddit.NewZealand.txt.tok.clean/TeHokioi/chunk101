  would n't i need to set up a vpn or something , since they have ip tracker law things here ? 
  or am i being paranoid ? 
  nah , it 's just a simple image and caption , not anything automatic . 
  it can be changed though , although that would require mod involvement, 
  yeah , i think / u / - halcyon is working on one now , not sure how far he got though, 
  posting in the subreddit is fine too . 
  as i said there , the image can be rotated at will and takes about 2 seconds , but requires a mod to do it, 
  sorry , force of habit on the internet, 
  how big is the price difference ? 
  hell , for that little of a difference i 'd say i 'll just cover it . 
  they really add so much more gameplay it 'd be a shame to miss out on it . 
  not sure how it 'd work though, 
  okay , so you 've made sure the dr evil mod is in the mods folder ? 
  is it showing up properly in the mod browser , and you 've activated it and everything ? 
  for the civs you gave as examples :, 
  * [ canada ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=231775803 ), 
  * [ new zealand ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=431610825 ) ( disclaimer : i did the civ icon , map and lh on this , so i 'm biased ), 
  * [ serbia ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=203579915 ) ( only one made so far , pretty sure someone is planning one too ), 
  * [ goths ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=81447812 ), 
  * [ hittites ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=111790660 ), 
  i know you said you do n't want other versions of current ones , but i would like to suggest the [ india ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=242272997 ) and [ polynesia ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=323041325 ) civilisation packs which i worked on . 
  instead of just doing something like adding another england , they actually split the uniques of the existing one up into different civs . 
  polynesia for example , the leader goes to hawaii , the uu to the maori and the ui to rapa nui , while the ua is reworked into the tongan uu . 
  polynesia itself does n't exist anymore , but it 's replaced with four much more accurate ones in its place . 
  we 're also planning a greek one too , so expect macedon , sparta , athens and pergamon in the near future . 
  beyond this , i 'd suggest taking a look at the [ new civilisations index ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=533772 ) , which has a list of nearly every modded civ released for civ v ( bnw only , i think . ), 
  i tend to use everything by jfd & janboruta , tomatekh , and lite ( and more civilisations , although i kind of have to since i do most of the code on them most of the time , ) and then some of cl and ge 's civs , as well as a couple others from other authors . 
  do the logs say anything about it ? 
  there should be a log folder in the same place as your mod folder , but unless you 've enabled logging in config.ini first they probably wo n't have any info, 
  looks like it has been x-posted by a guy claiming / r/nz is invading / r/auckland ... 
  fuck that , i ai n't trusting no machine alliance, 
  this does n't go in the css , does it ? 
  i would n't want to screw everything up with the new one, 
  hypothetically , if it was just a list of people in the facebook group would it have been such an issue , given their real names would already be known ? 
  not that i 'm involved or anything , i 'm just curious, 
  okay , sweet . 
  i do n't need to worry then , cheers, 
  reminded me of those texan whackjobs who thought obama was going to invade, 
  fair enough , i suppose it 's separating the counts of storing personal information and linking reddit and real names , the latter being less severe for people in the group ? 
  oh right , did n't realise there were n't any reddit usernames involved . 
  then yeah , that 's pretty shitty . 
  oh , that box is already checked well and good . 
  i 'm sure as hell not getting a self driving car, 
  i thought that was civ ? 
  they 've even got [ support groups ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkhkinbro7y ), 
  paging / u/sukritact, 
  ignoring the orchestral stuff from civ v 's soundtrack , [ u2 's god part ii ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ae1zp3h2wi ), 
  / u/pvtfish complained about them both being ` kiwis ' and suggested changing one to kiwis per capita . 
  in classic mod fashion , they changed both to pvtfishes per capita, 
  work what in ? 
   happy birthday to whoever has their birthday today i cbf right now . 
  birthday today . 
  trying to decide whether working all day in two jobs is better or worse than the two exams i had last year . 
  thanks - first one did n't , not sure about the second one yet, 
  wait , what ? 
  how did they get your name in the first place ? 
  you know , if isis ever work this out your sas is fucked, 
  cv soundtracks ? 
  only run dmc song i know ( other than their collab with aerosmith ) is [ christmas in hollis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or07r0zmfb8 ) , which we had to learn and sing back in year 6 after being taught it by possibly the whitest guy i 've ever met, 
  thanks !, 
  i kind of expected [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsadpc1cs5u ), 
  maybe you * are * coder 's friend who moved to the uk ? 
  ah , i thought it was some u2 thing i had n't heard of and i was all confused, 
  quick css update , i managed to somehow throw enough code together to get the sidebar map working , although there 's still a line of bullets on the left hand side . 
  but the map is working :d, 
  pretty sure it takes away the cost of any players not in the game anymore, 
  huh , it 's not available here in nz . 
  did n't even realise we banned games, 
  * i 'll have you know that back in my day i worked hard to earn enough to buy a house . 
  it took me five months working part time to earn enough to get my house , and two years to pay the mortgage !, 
  that sounds pretty accurate , actually, 
  sorry for being so shit at posting the on this day posts , exams and increased hours at work have taken a toll on me . 
  promise i 'll try to do better tomorrow !, 
  nah , not my day today . 
  no such thing as a break either , i 'm working for most of the day . 
  anyone able to check out / r/nzcss and give some feedback on the progress to date for the new css , so we know if we 're heading in the right direction ? 
  what would you suggest instead ? 
  why are n't you speaking in a question ? 
  anyone know of a 1920 x 1080 version somewhere ? 
  i 'd love to have this as a wallpaper, 
  the kea is just a placeholder image , it can be changed to whatever ( like on / r/wellington and / r/cricket ), 
  i 'd love to get rid of the bullet points , but i have no idea how . 
  hopefully someone with more experience can weigh in on it . 
  i dunno , i kind of like the southern cross where it is . 
  it was originally a placeholder , but it 's grown on me . 
  of course i 'd be willing to change it if that 's the consensus or if someone comes up with something better , but i 'll probably keep it for now . 
  original plan was to get rid of the snoo and have the southern cross link back to reddit , / r/turkey style , but i think the snoo is a nice touch . 
  will probably get rid of the word reddit though , maybe give the snoo a faint glow so it 's easier to see on its own, 
  good idea , i 'll try and figure it out now, 
  i 'd love to , but have no idea what i could do . 
  maybe on the sidebar somewhere ? 
  you can thank / u/sukritact for that, 
  yeah , we 're not losing any flairs , just adding new ones . 
  we considered making it a gallery , but it did n't work . 
  kea pic can be changed manually though , which is the general idea behind it on the subs that already have it implemented, 
  no can do , they all need to be the same image according to the code i used . 
  otherwise it could potentially be done , but it 'd be too much work to make them all different . 
  plus i think the stars are kind of cool, 
  it 's a hover sort of thing , if you hover your mouse over the images they go full brightness . 
  i might be able to increase the base a bit , but i would n't want to go too far as it 's a cool effect imo,
