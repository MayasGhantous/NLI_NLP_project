  although to be fair there were already extensive trade networks between china and africa , so that one is n't a stretch ( especially since the so-called ` treasure fleet ' was mainly a trade mission and a showcase of chinese strength ), 
  i never said that , i said that the polynesians are more impressive because they did n't know where they were going , they just set off in the unknown . 
  a map provides relative locations , which makes everything a lot easier if you have the navigation equipment . 
  if i 'm setting off in the indian ocean from tanzania , that map would tell me i need to go north-east if i want to get to india , or east if i want to get to indonesia . 
  without a map there 's no idea of any of that . 
  let 's have a look at [ drake 's voyage ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/drake_1577-1580.png ) , compared with contemporary [ shipping routes ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/16th_century_portuguese_spanish_trade_routes.png ) . 
  drake was following pre-established shipping routes for much of his journey , and stopping in settlements which had been around for decades . 
  this is far less impressive than the first polynesian explorers , or even the norse explorers . 
  yes , he covered more distance , but he was following existing routes and was in a ship probably ten times bigger than anything used by polynesians or norse , at the very least, 
  same thing has happened in somaliland . 
  northern part of somalia which declared independence back in 1991 and currently has a stable and peaceful democracy while the rest of the country went to shit . 
  no international recognition at all, 
  currently ahmed mohamed mohamoud , leader of a democratic socialist party which won with just under 50 % of the popular vote in the 2010 election,

  ftfy, 
  a little part of me dies inside each time i sell one at work, 
  is parliament usually that empty ? 
  seems a bit pathetic that so many people are absent during debating of such a controversial bill, 
  maybe it 's foreshadowing what 'll happen to the brakes ? 
  good morning and welcome to wednesday the 1st of july . 
  on this day in 1908 sos was officially adopted as an international distress signal , and in 1942 the first battle of el alamein begun . 
  the battle lasted 27 days and pitted allied forces against an overextended but quickly advancing axis force , under the command of the famed ` desert fox ' , erwin rommel . 
  the axis advance saw them come within 106 kilometres of the port city of alexandria , making the allied defense critically important . 
  after four weeks of fighting the battle reached a stalemate , although the allies had succeeded in halting the axis advance towards alexandria . 
  following two other battles later in 1942 , the axis were driven out of egypt completely . 
  also today , in 1970 the nuclear non-proliferation treaty was signed . 
  the npt is a cornerstone of nuclear disarmament , and ensures that non-nuclear states do not pursue nuclear proliferation , and in exchange are given assistance if requested in the pursuit of peaceful nuclear technology . 
  only four states have not signed the treaty - pakistan , india , south sudan , and israel - while north korea withdrew from the treaty in 2003 . 
  also today in international law , the international criminal court came into effect today in 2002 , with the goal of protecting civilians from war crimes and crimes against humanity , while prosecuting those who carry them out . 
  happy birthday today to somalia , who turns 55 today , and to rwanda and burundi , both of whom are 53 . 
  [ definitely intentional ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ej7zenjsea ), 
  maybe chuck in a couple pics from beforehand , or a link to street view ? 
  just did some work on getting some of the flairs transparent and updating the political logos and all that ( uploaded as spritesheet2 , ) but need to run off to work - any chance you 'd be able to try and finish it off ? 
  / r/rugbyunion flairs are [ here ] ( http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/l6ij2v4gtwb6avbrhi5xdu8kzd6ddv2l037biuwtqii.png ) if you 're able to add some of them in . 
  if not i 'll try and finish it off when i get home , but at the very least i think the transparency stuff for the flairs you did would be good, 
  edit : scratch that , i 've added them all . 
  can still fix them up if you want to make sure they 're done properly , but most of yours were fine since i think you made them at 20px instead of downsizing . 
  added a bunch more too , not sure if you 'd want any more, 
  you know what my thoughts on it are , i 'm not even going to bother typing it out again, 
  be sure to collect your 50 cents, 
  you could probably go north-east and skirt most of the major settlements on banks peninsula before heading out into the pacific, 
  working on flairs now , trying to get them transparent so that they look better too . 
  any other ideas while i 'm at it ? 
  i do n't think we 'll go for all the regions ( since there 's an awful lot as you said , and a lot of them do n't look great at 20px ) but i 'm probably going to take the nz ones on / r/rugbyunion along with maybe a couple other ones if i can figure out which ones . 
  someone got offered it , pretty sure it was on the daily a week or two ago, 
  he did n't take it , he politely refused and then got yelled at in broken english, 
  added a few rugby flairs from super rugby and the npc , along with the air nz logo and / u/yurcoxafailin 's crayfish flair - how do they look ? 
  did n't get around to a king country one though , could n't find anything good enough to work as a flair, 
  umm ? 
  who do i have to pay to make this happen ? 
  i thought the height limit was 7 stories ? 
  just added a bunch more flairs to / r/nzcss now , getting into the final stages now before we begin to port it over . 
  anyone have any other flair suggestions or anything before that happens ? 
  since i do n't drink nearly enough , i do n't know what 's good . 
  anyone have any recommendations ? 
  alcoholic stuff , probably beer / cider / spirits more than wine , but just whatever 's good really, 
  reminds me of / r/nonzeroday, 
  what 's wrong with it ? 
  that does n't mean it wo n't come up in debates . 
  i 'm almost certain some group opposed to it will say `` this guy died after being given cannabis !, 
  it should be banned '', 
  normally just speights or isaacs cider , occasionally gin if we have some lying around . 
  but they 're more out of convenience than preference, 
  gin was more because it was the only liquor lying around the house , not because i actually like the stuff . 
  no breweries nearby that i know of , although i think wigram has one, 
  i may be reasonably new to drinking , but i 'm not an idiot, 
  not with work the next morning, 
  i read it like five times and i 'm still not sure what 's going on, 
  we 've already got flairs for the north and south islands , old tv logos could be cool . 
  we 've got the current flag and the tino rangatiratanga so far , probably going to add the silver fern too . 
  maybe the new munster cross for the south island too , flag finalists could be worthwhile too, 
  is the original version square ? 
  i ca n't tell from how small it is , but i 've added a few more that are n't so if it 's not i can update it and make it look better if you want . 
  / r/bestoflegaladvice is fantastic , some of the shit people ask about is hilarious, 
  i was going to , but apparently the internet party is still around , and the civilian flair works for the satirical website too, 
  they 're actually imported from lichtenstein , nebraska, 
  dropped my family off at the airport this morning , as they abandon me and run off to australia for a couple weeks . 
  now have to try and survive four days by myself until dad gets back from europe . 
  that 's assuming he gets in at all , fine line between a potential erupting volcano in iceland and potential huge snowfall here, 
  that 's the plan . 
  just hoping the snow does n't come early , any longer and i might lose it, 
  potentially [ between 10 and 20 centimetres ] ( http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/69902259/significant-snow-predicted-for-canterbury ) to sea level on wednesday / thursday, 
  all i know is / r/science and / r/iama have both gone private in protest , not sure about others yet, 
  / u/karmanaut did [ a great summary ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/outoftheloop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/csq204d ) on / r/outoftheloop too, 
  holy shit has the victoria thing blown up . 
  i take it we 're not going dark , / u/dead _ rooster ? 
  will be interesting to see how it all plays out . 
  if / r/funny went that 'd be a huge blow for reddit , not because it was actually decent but because it 's pretty much the biggest subreddit , right ? 
  fair enough , not sure whether you 're getting modmail over it but might pay to put up a sticky stating as such or something , if only to stop the constant posting about it in new topics ? 
  nah , pretty sure it was mary, 
  pretty sure there 's never been a queen becky, 
  i reckon there 's a chance for a push here if we offer tagpro.gg as a site to fill in the time on, 
  [ tl ; dr : victoria got fired ; shit hit the fan ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/outoftheloop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/ ), 
  there are a bunch of civ fansites . 
  i 'm a mod of [ civfanatics ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com ) , one of the biggest . 
  it 's got just as much civ discussion ( more on the older games too as well as civ 5 ) , so there 's definitely other places to go, 
  we 're really not , we just pretend . 
  there 's a bunch of the old guard who regularly play on diety and win outright , but there 's just as many at normal level ( i only play on king at most ), 
  yeah , we 've found that 's a recurring issue with / r/civ eclipsing cfc in activity, 
  i 've been mulling over doing a jurassic park wonder - soundclip of hammond saying `` welcome to jurassic park '' or `` spared no expense '' or something as the quote , but this sounds awesome too,
