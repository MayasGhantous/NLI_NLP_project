  pretty sure i was right all along though, 
  suicide , such a shame . 
  full clip in the back of the head , too . 
  why would anyone do that to themselves ? 
  oh god , just found out about australia in the cricket . 
  and i thought we bet england pretty badly, 
  still waiting for someone to design a decent one so that i can add it into the new css, 
  how do you figure that ? 
  really ? 
  my full was piss easy , was just a couple blocks round the mall , and calling out hazards , then went back and i passed first time . 
   extras top-scored for the first time in an ashes test , with 14 root 's unbeaten 124 is the highest score in an ashes test in the second innings on the first day, 
  so , australia 's top scorer was actually england ? 
  this keeps getting better and better, 
  august 6 . 
  roosevelt had said that december 7 would be a day to live in infamy , and for four years he was right . 
  but august 6 , august 6 * became * infamy . 
  for on that day , the four horsemen rode upon the nation of japan , and brought with them the divine wrath of every deity to whom man had once prayed . 
  within a single flash of brilliant light , the world had changed forever . 
  the war was over , yet there were no celebrations . 
  a silence descended upon the globe , with all the countries of the world in awe , or fear , of this new weapon . 
  * a hundred million , * the papers cried . 
  the war in europe killed half that , at most . 
  many of them soldiers . 
  japan may have been militarised , yet within her isles the majority are - were , rather - civilians . 
  the americans had another , too . 
  but there was no need , kokura was eliminated by the first . 
  the fallout reached shanghai . 
  civilians there are falling ill and dying in the streets from the effects . 
  providence had determined that america obtained a weapon greater even than he , with which they delivered more death in a single day than even the great genghis khan had seen in his lifetime . 
  for all the nazis had done , their crimes paled in comparison to that of the victor . 
  calls rose for president truman to be charged with crimes against humanity . 
  yet no-one dared act , lest the wrath of god descend upon them . 
  * be grateful it was n't berlin , * leaders said , * for if it was , london would be dead . 
  sorry it 's a bit short , ran out of time . 
  first time writing one of these so any feedback would be appreciated . 
  i removed it from the list of selectable flairs , so that it 's not available to everyone . 
  should still be able to assign it to you manually , which will hopefully already be done when we port it across, 
  sorry , but what the hell ? 
  your mum constantly belittles and emotionally blackmails you , as well as preventing you from moving out , and you repay her by * paying for her to go to korea ? 
  * i do n't quite understand how this works , you should be saving instead for when you move out , not to spend money on her . 
  a lot of that is still a wip , it was originally done to match the banner but that 's been changed since, 
  reality check and a trip to the other side of the world are n't really all that similar . 
  try watching a 24 hour news channel for a bit , if i ca n't sleep i throw on bbc world and i 'm out to it within 10 minutes, 
  did you miss the last election ? 
  the whole national thing was pretty much a personality cult for johnnie, 
  i really hope the whole show is full of jokes about being as close to top gear as legally possible, 
  [ do-do-do-do-do-do-do , vote for me !,

  what was wagner thinking sending walcott on that early ? 
  at work now , will respond later . 
  mean time , what island do you want / rental car or public transport / any requests ? 
  lol , we 're not actually doing anything . 
  the staff here act like schoolkids when it starts to snow, 
  why not do a student exchange thing ? 
  i know uc offers exchanges to uppsala and stockholm , as well as copenhagen and tonnes others in europe , and they cover a fair chunk of the costs . 
  he must be a real butter fingers to let that one slip through, 
  i was going to type out a full-on comment like i normally do , but / u/tafelplot summed it up pretty nicely . 
  they also sound like they know way more about hiking , so mine would be a bit more general . 
  firstly , if you 've only got a week then the south island is probably a better option . 
  i love the north too , but the north is probably more ` cultural ' whereas the south is more ` natural ' in terms of the attractions ( ie . 
  in the north you 'd tend to go to the towns / cities - wellington , auckland , rotorua etc - while in the south you 'd stop off in the cities but you 'd mainly be checking out the nature instead . 
  what i would suggest as an alternative would be to fly in and out of christchurch , and rent a car from there . 
  drive down to either tekapo or mt cook for the night , depending on what you want to do . 
  mt cook is a much smaller town with tours and walks out into the surrounding national park , including the [ hooker valley track ] ( https://nzfrenzysouth.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/when-mother-nature-is-in-a-good-mood-on-the-hooker-valley-track.jpg ) and the [ tasman glacier lake ] ( http://www.christchurchnz.com/media/65502/glacier_explorers_mainrotator.jpg.rotator.ashx ) . 
  tekapo on the other hand does n't have much in the surrounding area as far as walks and all that go , but it 's a lot cheaper to stay at , plus there are nightly ( weather-dependent ) tours up to the [ mt john observatory ] ( http://www.tekapotourism.co.nz/activities/images/earthsky_1.jpg ) . 
  during april there should be between 10 and 12 hours of daylight , so it 's not like summer when you 'd be waiting for 10pm just for it to be dark enough but you 'd still have the weather to contend with . 
  from there , drive down to queenstown through the mackenzie country and spend a couple days in queenstown . 
  if you want , on the way down you can take a diversion to the [ clay cliffs ] ( http://www.odt.co.nz/files/story/2011/09/clay_cliffs_near_omarama_from_the_book_the_beauty__4e6087d0b1.jpg ) down by omarama , but if you want to do this make sure you check with your rental car company as most wo n't let you take your car off-road , and you need to go down a fairly lengthy dirt road to get there ( which can take a while including time to look round the cliffs , so plan accordingly . ), 
  in the area around queenstown there 's tonnes of stuff to do for whatever you 're interested in . 
  / u/tafelplot covered it fairly well , but one thing in particular i 'd like to add in is suggesting you check out arrowtown , which if you 're lucky with your timing looks [ amazing ] ( https://bessiejb.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_6905.jpg ) in april . 
  if you 're here between the 21st and 25th there 's also the autumn festival there , which could be worth checking out if you 're into that sort of thing . 
  a day trip on one of the real journeys busses to milford sound would be worth it too if you had the time . 
  after queenstown , head up the west coast and stop off in the glaciers for a night and check all that out . 
  again , / u/tafelplot covered this part really well so i wo n't go into too much detail . 
  if you had a few extra days , i 'd also suggest heading up to the top of the island and checking out abel tasman national park . 
  it starts to get a little bit cooler in april , but it 'd still be worth going up there to do some [ kayaking ] ( http://www.southern-edge.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/13/abel-tasman-kayaking/abel-tasman-kayaking-592x377.jpg ) if you could spare the time . 
  either way , head back to christchurch over one of the passes ( arthur 's if you skip abel tasman , lewis if you do n't ) or down the [ kaikoura coast ] ( http://bartlettandcorfe.co.nz/content/images/2014/nov/coastal-road-to-kaikoura.jpg ) if you want a massive day 's worth of driving . 
  you could pick up some crays down that way though , which i 've heard are fairly nice if you 're in the market for good food . 
  but yeah , whichever way you go , end up back in chch with possibly a day to spare , have a look round and then fly over to aussie . 
  one thing to note if you are coming over later in the month is that april 25th is anzac day ( kind of like your memorial day , ) and it 's a huge deal in australia ( here too , but they take it to the next level . ), 
  shops are closed until 1pm , and nearly every town and city in both countries holds a dawn service in commemoration of the landings at gallipoli by australian and nz forces during ww1 , and war dead since . 
  if you 're finding everything 's closed , that may end up being why . 
  how 's that / u/404colournotfound ? 
  that actually sounds reasonable by american standards . 
  the absolute cheapest from [ the looks of things ] ( http://www.topuniversities.com/student-info/student-finance/how-much-does-it-cost-study-us ) is roughly $ 16k nz per year for a 2 year course , but in most cases you 'd be looking at between $ 28k and $ 63k per year, 
  maybe i should go flatting , i 'm in my second year at uc and i barely experience any of the ` student life ', 
  the spartans had a whole lot like this . 
  according to legend , when the persians had the greeks surrounded at thermopylae and sent a messenger demanding the greeks surrender their weapons , leonidas responded `` come and take them , '' pretty much a spartan ` come at me . ', 
  another story goes that a young soldier complained to his mother that his spear was too short , her response was that he needed to ` add a step forward . ', 
  oh , i 'm in that area but i 'm still living at home . 
  i 'm not being charged board or anything so decided to make the most of it while i can , although i think i might end up moving out next year sometime just because it gets a bit depressing going through uni with little social interaction, 
   real english, 
   from ` merica, 
  pick one, 
  maybe they 've set up their own olympic committee , but it 's not recognised and is n't part of the african organisation ? 
  i 'm now even more confused, 
  did a quick check but could n't see it on the main page . 
  was hoping if it was elsewhere it 'd use the original source so it 'd show up in the submit thing , but guess not . 
  thanks for the heads up though, 
  ha , fox has [ picked up on it ] ( http://myfox8.com/2015/08/09/newly-married-man-sues-wife-for-emotional-trauma-after-seeing-her-without-makeup/ ) now,
