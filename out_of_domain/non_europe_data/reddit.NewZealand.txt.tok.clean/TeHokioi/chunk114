  umm , yeah , not really . 
  i mean , it 's more acceptable not to drink , and if you 're a sober driver it 's more ` good on ya ' than ` oh come on , ' but drinking is still very much a national past-time, 
  puppet empire : as venice , win the game having lost and recaptured your capital, 
  mod civs please :d, 
  although i might be biased . 
  but i 'd love to get a more in-depth discussion of how people actually play with the civs we 're making . 
  being able to see whether people enjoy a mechanic or how people play with civs would allow us to change the way we make civs and what effects we use so that they 're enjoyed better by the community . 
  there used to be one , but tpangolin did n't have time to continue it when br started up, 
  it 's on netflix here in nz , comes out as soon as a new episode is released, 
  it also opens up a whole host of new gambling-related economic options for the country !, 
  and that he has a tattoo of his face on his face !, 
  op or the other account ? 
  i really hope you mean the other account, 
  this makes me sad, 
  i always thought it was chocka ? 
  we used to have some mammals though . 
  they found a pre-european mouse or rodent fossilised down at st bathans , along with a crocodile and a snake . 
  there 's also older evidence of flamingo-style birds, 
  images from the article with a bit more on some of the animals are [ here ] ( http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ninetonoon/galleries/stbathans ) too . 
  looking round a bit more , seems [ we once had snakes ] ( http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/08/0809_020808_wirnzsnake.html ) and [ mice or something ] ( http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10415144 ) , too, 
  oh , right , not as in your current family . 
  i was about to yell again, 
  where the streets have no name again ( although the original version with the longer intro instead of the u218 version with a cut one , it adds to the sense of grandeur ) - i 'd also throw in i still have n't found what i 'm looking for and beautiful day , maybe desire too . 
  beyond u2 , * running * and * it 's too late ( ride on ) * from evermore and coldplay - lovers in japan ( osaka sun mix ) also have that fast-paced optimism sort of sound from streets . 
  maybe dragon - rain too or crowded house - do n't dream it 's over for a kiwi flavour, 
  i 'm argumentative , especially when people make stupid decisions, 
  i think that was tongariro, 
  given i was n't born yet , does n't really make me feel old, 
  kind of , but that 's a bit of a different situation . 
  normal earthquakes are caused by tectonic movement , which is pretty much giant plates of rock floating on currents in the magma , like pack ice . 
  where two currents come together on the surface the plates collide , and generally either slide past each other , or one goes underneath the other ( a subduction zone , which is what the east coast is . ), 
  normally this happens smoothly , but if they get caught for whatever reason then pressure builds up . 
  earthquakes are when this pressure gives way , and generally it happens with one huge earthquake followed by lots of smaller aftershocks as the plates settle back into their rhythm and pressure which the original quake caused is relieved . 
  on the other hand , what 's happening here is a swarm of lots of earthquakes , all roughly the same size ( so there 's no big quake then aftershocks . ), 
  sometimes these can just occur then die off , like [ this one ] ( http://www.jonfr.com/volcano/?p=5769 ) in south-western iceland early this month ( although a similar one occurred in the same place a month earlier , so it may still be something yet , ) but generally earthquake swarms are bad news . 
  in 2011 on a tiny spanish island in the atlantic ocean there was a swarm of hundreds of earthquakes , including 400 in a four day period between the 20th and 24th of july . 
  these swarms continued until the 10th of october , when [ a volcanic eruption ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%e2%80%9312_el_hierro_eruption ) began south of the island and continued until march 2012 . 
  sometimes earthquake swarms occur before a larger earthquake too , like what happened in the solomons a couple years back . 
  they had an earthquake swarm in late january and early february , which ended up with a magnitude [ 8.0 earthquake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_solomon_islands_earthquake ) on the 6th of february . 
  in this case , we 've got a swarm of earthquakes in a geothermal area . 
  if it were to continue then we 'd potentially be looking at an eruption , which was [ kind of a big deal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eruption_of_mount_tarawera ) the last time it happened . 
  fortunately , it does n't seem anything out of the ordinary yet , with geonet calling the event [ `` very minor '' ] ( http://info.geonet.org.nz/display/quake/2015/08/10/small+earthquake+swarm+near+waimangu-rotomahana ) - which seems fairly reasonable given that only 20 of the 60 earthquakes were big enough to even be located . 
  still , it 's a sign that the region is far from stable . 
  i 've got essays to write , need to procrastinate somehow, 
  i 'm trying to say that if you were going to move across the world with a family you 're trying to move away from then you 'd be a fucking idiot, 
  dammit . 
  i was going to ask if i could invite myself , then i realised we have people coming round on saturday so i ca n't . 
  i should go flatting so i do n't have these problems, 
   fun, 
  was a shitty attempt at a joke, 
  nah , i just prefer to be diplomatic since it 's mum 's boss and her family, 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hddjoq4o5us ) , but it 's only as long as the gif, 
  why not both ? 
  you think that 's a weird election , you should have seen our one last year - kim dotcom , edward snowden , conservative nutjobs and burning effigies , alongside a party with a pineapple as its deputy leader, 
  got ta get those clicks , bro, 
  easy there hosking, 
  gah , shot myself in the foot again . 
  between now and next friday i 've got 2\u00a01/2 essays , a midterm and a presentation , none of which i 've started . 
  it 's only 800-1000 words , instead of 2000-2500 like the others, 
  oh absolutely , i promise i 'm going to try better next term . 
  although i 've been saying that since year 9 , so yeah, 
  but then how will i find out about the latest reviews of belt sanders ? 
  as someone from outside the us i 'm not surprised at all . 
  the one time i went there about 8 years ago i got ` randomly selected for additional screening ' on every single flight , which was quite a bit given hawaii 's made up of islands . 
  and this is despite my pasty white complexion, 
  i think it 's pretty tough to blame them so soon after they took over , but i do n't know enough about it to say for certain, 
  they 're *, 
  welcome to reddit , your first mistake was telling your friend your username, 
  no-one is clean enough to run in the whole senior leadership . 
  collins fucked up with oravida , simon `` fact of the matter '' bridges would patronise everyone to the point he 'd get negative votes ( plus the whole mining / oil fuckups ) , joyce might work but he seems way better in a frank underwood behind the scenes sort of role , and english has already tried and failed, 
  poor rattle and hum, 
  nah , it was more the opening up of conservation land , his complete disregard for the wishes of the people of kaikoura , and the lack of charisma around him . 
  every time i watch his argument with john campbell i want to break things whenever he says `` the fact of the matter is '', 
  you have far more sense than [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou6l8pesroy ), 
  try some of tim butcher 's ones . 
  he recreates the journeys of historical figures , and intersperses them with the history of the original person , recent history of the area and his own journey . 
  his most recent one , for example - * the trigger * - was him recreating the journey of gavrillo princip ( the assassin who shot archduke franz ferdinand , starting ww1 , ) and throughout the book he talked not only about princip , but also about the balkan wars and his experience as a war correspondent there and about his own journey as well . 
  really well written, 
  source is [ here ] ( https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153200638329531&amp;set=a.78043539530.77927.767074530&amp;type=1&amp;theater ) , so it 's not confirmed from an official state department source afaik, 
  by the time obama 's leaving office she 's not running for president anymore , she 's either won or lost already, 
  got ta get that personality cult, 
  or they just stay up ? 
  fuck we 're a lazy bunch, 
   when was the last time you saw a member of the public that close to the us govt ? 
  do they need to survive the encounter to count ? 
  sod off, 
  you 're finally going to move out ? 
  hope you 've got enough money though , ilam apartments instead of flitting means ~ 3x the cost, 
  good job with the allowance , it sucks for me because dad makes too much for me to quality but they 're not paying for any of my costs so it does n't make any difference for me, 
  it looks like someone photocopied the flag and forgot to make it colour, 
  i reckon that 'd work better as `` you better [ belize ] ( #f / beli ) it ! '', 
  but i guess bolivia works too, 
  i have n't had a bad experience with it , personally . 
  the one time i was sober driving i just pulled out my keys whenever someone asked and got some form of `` oh good onya mate '' in response . 
  it helps having a bottle opener keychain to open beers for people too, 
  looks like you 'll need to hold off on becoming a warlord, 
  easy solution then is to get a car, 
  maybe a cross between him and tom cavanagh ? 
  i 'm so sorry , maybe next year, 
  i 'm so sorry,
