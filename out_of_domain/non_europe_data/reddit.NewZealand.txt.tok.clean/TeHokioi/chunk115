  get your learners at least , then you have another form of id if you need it, 
  will do , tomorrow though . 
  no bugs as far a i can remember , but i 'd hold off a bit on doing anything to expand it until we know what we 're doing and we 've got a style we 've agreed upon, 
  something seems to have gone weird , my silver fern flag is now the pan-african flag, 
  okay , just checked out bush mode now . 
  liking it much more than i was , definitely on the right path . 
  does seem to be a bug with the [ res vote counter thing ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gz8h4jq.png ) , but that 's been buggered for a while so i 'm not sure what 's happening with it . 
  links that have been clicked on are still purple too , which makes them [ hard to read ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tki9jvm.png ) against the green background . 
  flair selector also seems to stay the standard blue and white . 
  beyond that though , it 's looking great . 
  i think getting the images to change out is the main thing , since the ones for the posts and the map of new zealand are much harder to make out when they 're against a green background . 
  also seems that the sidebar pic does n't show up for some reason ? 
  no flag , no country . 
  [ oh please ] ( http://worldmapswithout.nz/ ), 
  i was meaning more in relation to the recent protests - first thing monday and he 's belittling them . 
  such as what ? 
  not trying to be antagonistic , i 'm genuinely curious, 
  new political party that is actually decent would be interesting . 
  i was kind of expecting labour to split following little 's victory into a working man 's sort of proper labour party and a more general centre-left social democratic party or whatever under robertson, 
  united tribes flag is really cool . 
  it does n't really work within the scope of getting the british stuff off the flag , but it looks great , has the history of both maori and pakeha behind it and is unique on the world stage . 
  yeah , and hawaii was n't even colonised by the brits . 
  kamehameha just put it on there because he liked them and thought it looked cool, 
  well , it was paul henry , so yeah, 
  was n't the green economic policy actually developed by economists in the last election campaign ? 
  if we 're going with the different themes still , i think i 'd prefer to have a single header image which fits the main theme as opposed to a rotating one . 
  should be if you leave early enough , but it is a [ very windy road ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/q023n ) so it 'll take longer than expected . 
  i probably would n't leave any later than 7:30 just to be on the safe side , although even that might end up cutting it a bit fine if the conditions are iffy or whatever . 
  that said , if you got up real early and got to fox by 7:30 - ish instead you might have time to check out [ lake matheson ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qmdk5iy.jpg ) , which is pretty awesome around that time ( photo credit / u/s13 _ eisbaer ), 
  what i was meaning was more that if we 've got all of the other cohesive themes with different headers and colours and whatever , it would be nice imo to have the main theme ( which is what people will see most often ) as a cohesive theme with a matching header too . 
  we 've got the sidebar image which we can use , could always swap out the main skin for special occasions ( i think a pohutukawa one for christmas would be cool ), 
  possibly , would depend on the weather . 
  i think so long as it 's reasonably fine and you take care it wo n't be too much of an issue . 
  do n't think there 'd be much change within the space of an hour anyway , so you 'd still be facing much the same issue leaving at half 7, 
   this video has been removed because its content violated youtube 's terms of service . 
  oh great , now you 've done it, 
  from / u/japed , from the bbc it 's apparently a `` pictish style wild cat head that recalls the ancient kingdom of cat of the area '' . 
  so it seems there was a [ kingdom of cat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_cat ) in the early middle ages of scotland ... 
  edit : i ca n't format to save my life, 
  * bernie sanders does n't want our money . 
  how 's he funding his campaign ?!, 
  * ( cue illuminati / freemasons logo ), 
  * bernie sanders is violating freedom of speech by refusing money . 
  do n't vote for a man who is against freedom of speech !, 
  * bernie sanders is taking money from the poor for his own gain !, 
  * we 're hard working americans . 
  yet the socialist bernie sanders does n't want our money . 
  what issue does he have with our all-american money ? 
  only someone who is un-american would refuse the proceeds from the blood , sweat and tears of americans !, 
  * ( overlaid with images of cliche american pastimes and careers - defense forces , oil and steel workers etc. 
  throw in a couple american flags and eagles for the hell of it , maybe the blue angels too ), 
  maybe we need national to splinter so the right has n't got it 's big divided front thing going on . 
  get judith to splinter and make some non-shitty conservative party, 
  ha , michael laws came out in defence of him , calling critics of hosking `` fascist liberals '', 
  sounds like / r/nonzeroday, 
  but i work there :(, 
  he 's in the uk iirc, 
  no you silly batman , it 's * indeed i do , good sir . 
  * you 're not in spain . 
  but u2 do n't have any happy , chirpy , party songs :(, 
  i guess i 'll have to try and find something else , given you never added any of my suggestions last week :(, 
  [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/3gh7oj/new_zealand_daily_random_discussion_thread_11/ctymgxo?context=1 ) - even had some non-u2 in there !, 
  huh , odd . 
  just checked again , i 'm not subscribed to the playlist but i 'm only seeing 22 songs there - a couple of my ones , but none of the u2 or evermore , just do n't dream it 's over and lovers in japan, 
  even if it were between two australian teams , they still would n't win it, 
  i 'd definitely say they 'd be pretty much muse . 
  a lot of muse 's stuff has a very queen sound , especially their newer stuff . 
  [ defector ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzbfxlnpgum ) off their latest album was often compared to queen in reviews, 
  oh , that makes sense . 
  i thought you might have done a new playlist every week or something, 
  sometimes i can even get up to 50 on riccarton road now !, 
  video cameras in the milk powder painted white to blend in, 
  damn ruskies getting that chocolate milk before the south island, 
  well i say it 's too much . 
  if the commies get it before we do , then we 're obviously being taken for granted . 
  it 's time for the south island to declare independence and make our own chocolate milk !, 
  i probably would have accepted their us money and then waited patiently for them to still pay the bill in nzd, 
  must be / u/unleashthequiche lurking again, 
  what phone did you get ? 
  did you get it cheap online or buy it in a store ? 
  holy shit i thought you were joking, 
  just disney movies , or do you count disney subsidiaries ? 
  because i 'd prefer a lot of pixar movies over the lion king, 
  which leads me to think that we probably know each other too , in some way or another . 
  because john oliver was pointing out how easy it was to pass yourself off as a church to the irs , and did so by making an official church, 
  oh god , i 'm sorry to say that i 'm not her , and i 'm trying to decide whether to let her know about this or not, 
  well already we 've established it 's no more than 2 degrees , and given that you 're ` besties ' with a good friend of mine that i 've known for years , there 's a good chance we 've probably met, 
  i think / u/onewhitelight might have something to say about that, 
  god , why is it always his office instead of him ? 
  anytime something bad happens it 's always his office and he feigns innocence, 
  last essay before the break , i 'm so close to finally being finished . 
  just need to write the damn thing and i 'm done, 
  was n't he going to retire at some point in the second term ? 
  i think he might have been pressured into it , the personality cult seems to be all they 're running on now, 
  that 's assuming they get consent for birdling 's flat . 
  this might be a sign that the first one is being held up , so they 're beginning to look elsewhere . 
  or it could be them trying to pressure people down here to agree under threat that they 'll move elsewhere, 
  disappointing effort,
