  feel free to suggest stuff !, 
  sorry , it 'll only work with bnw, 
  yeah , that 's the problem . 
  and something as big as tech pacing , which requires a whole game playthrough to check , just takes too much time to test on our own, 
  nah , there 's only a couple building effects and the tech tree lua for the new era . 
  rest of it is pretty much all just xml so it should be fine, 
  most of the major civ projects are compatible - mc , jfd , tomatekh , cl , patria grande etc , smaller ones are n't always guaranteed, 
  menagerie replaces it , but we 've also got the tavern in at machinery to act as an extra happiness building in the middle, 
   you 've got to wonder what goes through people 's minds when they see a brown guy who is holding hands with a white guy and they think `` he 's clearly an islamic extremist '' . 
  not a lot , i 'd imagine, 
  any chance it could just be made compatible rather than be outright included in cbp ? 
  as much as i like to see people use my mods in their own , it 'd kind of suck if nobody downloaded the actual one because it was fully included in another, 
  eh , we 're trying to stick as close to vanilla as possible , so given that there 's no mechanic like that ( except for strategic resources ) i 'd prefer to stay away from it . 
  of course , there 's nothing to stop you from making a modmod for it to limit the number of surveyors, 
  problem with needing the academy then is that on paper they 're no longer in sync , throwing the perceived balance between the two out . 
  keep in mind that going tall / cultural will be a lot more viable with ee as there are two more gw buildings and several gw wonders , so if you 're going for a cultural game it would be just as powerful . 
  could always potentially modify the salon through social policies too to further incentivise it for a culture player, 
  gameplay vs realism - steam power is too far away on the tech tree and does n't maintain the tech paths as well, 
  nah , you understood fine . 
  it is something we considered , but given that option is already available with papal primacy i do n't think it 's too far out of the question , especially if it 's a world wonder . 
  sorry , let me just go and tear up all our hard work :(, 
  it 's representative of the philosophical advances of the age , could n't be an enlightenment era without it, 
  hopefully, 
  i think our unit list is pretty well finalised , but you 're more than welcome to make a modmod adding it in, 
  that could work , although given how limited art is at this point i 'd be hesitant to do anything which would require more of it, 
  just donated $ 40 , will post a screenshot when the others on diameter wake up ( lazy so-and-so 's . ), 
  meantime [ here 's ] ( http://tagpro-origin.koalabeast.com/profile/5364785fda8958803739cc3d ) my profile with the donor flair, 
  i remember watching this when i was a kid and laughing at it having no understanding of what the flag was . 
  i thought they were saying that he was a leprechaun, 
  well , papal primacy and patronage and you 're already at a permanent 35 . 
  add this in and you 're always at 50 . 
  not quite to ally , but a fair chunk of the way, 
  [ because everybody needs someone to hate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftwebpy_47o ), 
  given the state of our election last year i think ours is just as entertaining, 
  [ i dunno about that ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihreejg08ns ), 
  why would i want to find baby seals on tinder ? 
  was n't that just a weekend at the place where it existed ? 
  i suppose i could whip one up for the new css if people want it, 
  about the new css ? 
  / r/nzcss - there 's a bunch more flairs there already , plus i 've made the background transparent on them, 
  yeah , sorry - i got a little bit excited when i saw there was a new video, 
  define newer model ? 
  i was going to post a fact , but i do n't think i can compete with / u/honourandsacrifice 's deep and personal questions . 
  assert your dominance by knocking the first one who speaks up out cold . 
  they 'll know better than to question your decisions then, 
  should be easy enough with that level of support to find others elsewhere in the country willing to help out, 
  oh okay , a bit outside my window . 
  pretty sure mine is a 1999, 
  opposing the tppa and opposing trade are two different things, 
  good , i was about to get really pissed off because the same thing happened last night as a couple days ago, 
  two weeks , and only in the north island ? 
  are you renting a car ? 
  as far as money is concerned , have you considered just taking cash ? 
  as long as you 're not looking overtly touristy and the money is n't blatantly obvious , you should be fine, 
  bloody hell , did everyone here go to the same school ? 
  well there you go !, 
  get 100 people on it and it 's only 4000 people each , much more manageable, 
  awesome , ca n't wait . 
  iran seems like an awesome place based on what i 've heard from everyone that goes there , and it 's got an amazing history that thankfully has n't been destroyed . 
  thanks to whoever set this up !, 
  it might have something to do with the phonetics behind it ? 
  england and hungary 's names seem to refer to an ethnic group - angles and maygars - but new zealand and holland , for example , do n't seem to refer to a group in their name before land , so it does n't translate to - stan ? 
  of course , that 's just a complete guess with next to no knowledge of persian , so it could be completely wrong, 
  that definitely sounds like us , most of the time [ we 're not even on maps ] ( http://worldmapswithout.nz/ ), 
  and by before lunchtime he means wake up at 6 and get in line, 
  what sort of stuff are you interested in ? 
  and are you flying into queenstown ? 
  getting a rental ? 
  ever since i saw iran in a documentary about alexander the great years ago i 've wanted to visit - every book or account about visiting iran i 've read always talks about how kind and friendly you are , and how stunning the scenery is . 
  what would be the best way to see the country ? 
  is the road quality good enough that driving would be an option ( and for that matter , would it be safe enough ? 
  i know we occasionally get issues with people targeting tourists , figured it might be an issue elsewhere . ), 
  on another note , what sort of influences does iranian culture have ? 
  is it predominantly persian still , or has that been replaced with a more islamic culture since 1979 ? 
  or is it different still ? 
  it 's not so much a rivalry between the north and south island as it is between auckland and the rest of the country . 
  because auckland is so big ( roughly 1/3 of the whole country lives there ) they have a sense of self-importance and often ignore the rest of the country . 
  for example , if there was an average wind storm in auckland it 'll appear on the evening news as lead story , even if elsewhere in the country had much worse weather . 
  the nickname for aucklanders is jafas ( just another fucking aucklander ) , which generally describes the rest of the country 's view on them . 
  as far as must see sights go , it depends on what you 're into . 
  in the north island up around auckland , northland , and the coromandel , you can see [ ninety mile beach ] ( http://www.newzealandshores.com/wp-content/uploads/goldenbeach.jpg ) ( legally a road here ) , [ cape reinga ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yzo9f7g.jpg ) ( our northern-most point ) , [ tane mahuta ] ( http://treefellas.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/tane-mahuta-kauri-tree-waipoa-forest.jpg ) , our largest kauri tree ( roughly 45 metres tall and 1500-2500 years old , ) and [ cathedral cove ] ( http://www.seakayaktours.co.nz/home/data1/images/19.jpg ) , nearby which is [ hot water beach ] ( http://www.thecoromandel.com/content/images/2679/1920x500crop/corolowrestimpierce-0011622_copy.jpg ) , where you can dig yourself a hot spring . 
  further down is rotorua , with a large geothermal area including [ geysers ] ( http://www.rotoruanz.com/getattachment/data/listings/tepuia/te-puia/tepuia_signature-geyser-2011.jpg/?width=3500&amp;height=2333&amp;ext=.jpg ) , [ hot pools ] ( http://tourcraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/274_1680_948.jpg ) and pools of [ mud ] ( http://www.southern-edge.com/wp-content/uploads/rotorua-mud-pools.jpg ) which for some reason [ people bathe in ] ( http://www.aatravel.co.nz/great-kiwi-escapes/images/ss-rotorua1a.jpg ) ( only some , others will burn you very badly . ), 
  rotorua is a good place to go to see maori culture too , even if it is slightly touristy . 
  just below rotorua is [ lake taupo ] ( http://www.greatlaketaupo.com/media/81526/lake-taupo-with-tongariro-national-park-in-winter.cex_4g.jpg ) , which was formed by the largest volcanic eruption on earth in the past 70,000 years and potentially contributed to the last ice age , followed by the [ desert road ] ( http://www.allcountries.org/photos/new_zealand/desert_road_new_zealand_photo_david_wall.jpg ) , from which you can see the active volcanoes of [ ruapehu ] ( http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/assets/uploads/images/ruapehu-1995-eruption.jpg ) , [ ngauruhoe ] ( http://tramper.nz/files/objectversions/6143/mt%20ngauruhoe%20desktop.jpg ) and [ tongariro ] ( http://d1k2jfc4wnfimc.cloudfront.net/assets/distinctionthepark/images/ruapehu%20attractions/tongariro%20eruption.jpg ) , the first of which has skifields during winter and the last of which you can [ cross ] ( https://ezperienza.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/tongariro-crossing.jpg ) in summer . 
  beyond that , there 's [ wellington ] ( http://www.builtinwellington.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/city1.jpg ) down the bottom of the north island which i absolutely love , where you can head up the [ cable car ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/wellington_city_with_cable_car.jpg ) and get great views of the city from the botanical gardens . 
  wellington is also the northern terminus for the [ interislander ] ( http://prod-uc.myob.net/f06b5b0e40d46c7ca9a99a5fc7d40907/gallery/1351976716-interislander.jpg-original.jpg ) , which sails between the north and south islands . 
  i 'm just going to try and go through the south island quickly since i need to go to work , so it wo n't be in as much detail as the north . 
  feel free to ask if you have any questions though . 
  up the top , near where the ferry reaches is [ abel tasman national park ] ( http://www.anatokisalmon.co.nz/assets/uploads/abel-tasman-national-park1.jpg ) , which has amazing beaches and kayak tours during summer . 
  from there you can head down the [ west coast ] ( http://www.punakaiki.co.nz/wp-content/themes/punakaiki/images/punakaiki-header03.jpg ) to [ punakaiki ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/pancake_rocks,_punakaiki.jpg ) , and then further down to [ fox ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/fox_glacier_nz_2.jpg ) and [ franz josef ] ( http://www.westcoast.co.nz/content/images/2291/640x480normal/l35_-_franz_josef.jpg ) glaciers , which are sadly in retreat . 
  to get into the rest of the island you 'll need to head over one of the alpine passes , normally either [ arthur 's pass ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/arthur's_pass.jpg ) ( where you can see the native alpine parrot , the [ kea ] ( http://www.westcoast.co.nz/content/images/2548/640x480normal/keas_above_viaduct.jpg ) - just watch out for your belongings [ when they 're around ] ( http://shafir.info/shafir_images/10album/26new_zealand~100tramping~140arthur's_pass~16kea_attacks.jpg ) ) or [ haast pass ] ( http://lynx-travel.com/vacations/nz2000/wanaka/gates%20of%20haast%20bridge%20over%20haast%20gorge.jpg ) . 
  there 's also [ lindis pass ] ( http://www.chrislewisimages.com/data/photos/193_1avis_lindis.jpg ) if you 're going from the [ mackenzie country ] ( http://www.southlandphotographicsociety.com/media/1082/op-1-b-mackenzie-country.jpg ) through to queenstown instead of through the west coast . 
  down in [ queenstown ] ( http://www.queenstownnz.co.nz/content/images/4752/1920x1080normal/dq19241-header-image-internal.jpg ) there 's tonnes of activities to do which i do n't have time to go over , but let me know if you 'd like to know and i 'll go into them when i get home . 
  there 's also the nearby town of [ arrowtown ] ( https://bessiejb.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_6905.jpg ) which is definitely worth a visit , and of course [ milford sound ] ( http://www.backpackingmatt.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/415054_10100630816844929_14801685_54271217_1966282812_o-1.jpg ) which is on almost every tourist 's itinerary, 
  i would n't say maori is a popular language on its own - sometimes people may give a speech in maori as well as english to show biculturalism , but for the most part it 's not that widely spoken . 
  instead , words from maori tend to become part of nz english , so someone might say kia ora to greet you , or ask if you want some kai ( food . ), 
  there are very few maori people who are n't fluent in english , but there are still some isolated communities on the east coast of the north island where maori is spoken almost exclusively . 
  from what i remember , at primary school we had kapa haka class every week where we 'd learn waiata ( maori songs ) and other stuff like haka and how to use poi . 
  the classes also used maori words just normally , like * e tu * or * e noho * for stand up and sit down respectively , or learning to count in maori alongside english ( tahi-rua-toru-wha and so on ), 
  in high school maori was just an optional second language alongside japanese and french , but what languages are available depends on what school you go to .
