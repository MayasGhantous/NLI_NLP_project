  i think the designer in the article summed it up pretty well :, 
   i think if they were an engineering firm in our state , that would be a concern . 
  but a flag in new zealand ? 
  that makes it kind of cool -- and again , they could say it 's different because there 's a blue triangle . 
  i 'm all for people putting more good design and more good work out into the world . 
  by having it as our flag , it would n't have the same connotations of corporatism that having the nzte logo as our flag would . 
  it 's not like we 're suddenly going to be governed by peak engineering & design, 
  nah , i 'm talking about the white and black fern , not the lockwood ferns . 
  happy days , we 'll see you tomorrow, 
  could always try retail , there 's no shortage of hours in the build up to christmas and then if you do well they might keep you on - it 's how i got my job coming up on two years ago, 
  i think a country that 's different from all the other ones we 've done so far . 
  like , i 'd prefer an exchange with / r/spain or / r/greece as opposed to / r/norway , given we 've already done / r/sweden . 
  but beyond that i have n't really got any suggestions that have n't already been covered, 
  i think this is the first repost i 've seen on here that was n't a reposted news article, 
  well , it was a good run, 
  god , that article is written horribly . 
  i ca n't even figure out what they 're trying to say some of the time . 
  so what happens if someone from a visa-waiver country wants to stay for nine months in an 18-month period ? 
  could they apply for a visa ? 
  china , india and the us are not regional powers in the south pacific . 
  they 're still not physically in the south pacific . 
  they could work too , i just suggested those ones to demonstrate my point . 
  i 'd love to do one with a balkan state, 
  those damn commie-nazis, 
  i think the ai is the one attacking again, 
  you sure we 're thinking of the same sanders ? 
  he 's got a fairly consistent voting record throughout his history in politics , does n't strike me as someone who is willing to say anything, 
  i 'd be okay with that, 
  i think the disestablishment of trident might work given how much of a money sink it is , although i think the best way to go about it would be as part of a wider multi-national disarmament treaty , so that there 's no net decrease in security . 
  the number of states with nuclear weapons is only in single digits , and none of the others have suffered nuclear attacks as a result of not having them . 
  nato i can see as being more contentious though , especially in regards to the current climate . 
  although the flip side of it would be that it would mean the uk would n't have to get involved in conflict in eastern europe if russia gets more expansionist , so it may find favour too, 
  and even if customs was cheaper , why would a business bother cutting the price when it can increase the size of the profit, 
  you should really let us know if you get a crash , that way we 're able to keep improving the mods and make them more stable, 
  was about $ 7,500 when i donated and posted the link, 
  no idea when it started , i only found out about it last night on the show, 
  what have you got against turks ? 
  what about greeks , are they welcome ? 
  quick , get him !, 
  depends on your definition of ` okay ', 
  i 'd assume it 's countries that have withdrawn recognition, 
  awesome , good luck !, 
  it seems to have been good enough for president bartlett , so it should be fine !, 
  so what you 're saying is i need to get a rabbit in order to become a mod ? 
  * hot today , ai n't it ? 
  if winnie is anything to be believed , [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/kyle_lockwood's_new_zealand_flag.svg/1200px-kyle_lockwood's_new_zealand_flag.svg.png ) is the flag of chinese new zealand, 
  not sure how accurate it is , but i remember seeing a doco years ago that mentioned them , and some of the three pronged ones were designed like that so that if they were thrown and spinning they could essentially roll over a shield and hit whoever was hiding behind it, 
  should x-post this to / r/talesfromtechsupport , seems close enough and definitely fits . 
  the guy sounds like a three year old throwing a tantrum, 
  does it have to be an original song or can it be another song that was used in it ? 
  i had a friend in high school who suffered from depression ( a few actually , but one in particular which is relevant to this . ), 
  she tried to keep it under wraps to most , and normally you could n't really tell at all , but then sometimes she 'd just break down and spend the whole of interval curled in tears somewhere . 
  despite that , barely anyone outside of her friends knew . 
  one day in english , her class were looking at a story whose main character had depression . 
  in front of everyone , her teacher says `` oh , you have depression , do n't you ____ ? 
  how about you tell everyone what it 's like . '', 
  the teacher was n't the best anyway , and this put my friend over the edge and she just ran out of the room in tears . 
  as far as what i did , it 's difficult to someone who has never experience it to know how they feel , so the most i could really do was just offer them a shoulder and be willing to listen if they wanted to talk . 
  it 's a really tough one to deal with though, 
  as others have said , there 's pretty much going to be no traffic . 
  most people on christmas tend to get together and throw a bbq while getting pissed . 
  generally you 'd have some [ nz reggae ] ( https://play.spotify.com/user/spotifyaustralia/playlist/3qkhcoyxlwupsusvha5rko ) playing and maybe a backyard / beach cricket pitch . 
  [ pohutukawa ] ( http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/i0000adi7_i5leuq/s/1000/ ) are also fairly commonly associated with christmas in nz , although they do n't tend to grow in the south island . 
  while it 's generally pretty choice weather-wise , it can vary a fair bit . 
  i remember one christmas in arrowtown , it started snowing for a bit . 
  never settled , but snow on christmas was still pretty cool, 
  ah , thought that might be the case - especially given the nikau growing as far south as punakaiki - at any rate though , you would n't see them on the queenstown-chch route or in chch itself, 
  one that tries to coax the students into fighting back so she can get them suspended, 
  i love it , caught up with some mates down from auckland the other day and actually sat outside for hours for the first time in god knows how long . 
  shame it 's going to pack in by the weekend , but definitely looking forward to summer, 
  considered setting up a bot , but it 's better and more organic when everyone does it instead, 
   the ministry of civil defence has issued a tsunami warning for east cape , chatham islands , coromandel , and banks peninsula . 
  you 're from here too , are n't you ? 
  if it 's not , shit 's gon na get real bad real soon, 
  quick , get him !, 
  maybe it was feet instead of metres and it got muddled in translation ? 
  still bad , but nowhere near as bad as metres, 
  so with the code i 've got in the op , would just replacing ` body : not ( . subscriber ) ` with ` body.subscriber ` work , or would i need to change something else ? 
  does n't seem to be working, 
  i 've added it to the css , but it does n't seem to be showing up . 
  bugger, 
  hmm , tried both of those and it still does n't seem to want to work . 
  am i doing this right ? 
  body.subscriber  . content : before {, 
  content : '' tsunami warning issued for regions on east coast . 
  see < a href = `` https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/3l8l0q/83_earthquake_of_the_coast_of_chile_potential/ ''  here < / a  for more info . 
  background-repeat : no-repeat ;, 
  color : # 111 ;, 
  display : block ;, 
  that makes sense . 
  is there any way to have a link in it then ? 
  any chance i 'd be able to use a modified version of the header style for the new / r/newzealand css i 'm working on ? 
  i ca n't see japan going nuclear , given their history . 
  wrong comment, 
  damn , okay . 
  thanks for your help !, 
  to be fair , they sheltered us in 2004 so i 'd say we owe 'em one, 
  to be fair you 'll probably be doing that too in summer, 
  trade it for astrophotography lessons, 
  * and , um , this used to be a building .
