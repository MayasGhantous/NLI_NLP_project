   i miss having someone to debate with, 
  ask a controversial question tomorrow and i 'll be more than happy to debate you over it, 
  oh , well in that case feel free to head over to / r/nzcss and give us brutal feedback on it . 
  i 'm like that too at work , although i barely ever get anyone to engage over it , and the ones that do refuse to think any other way is right other than theirs , so it 's pointless, 
  oh yeah of course , i know just what you mean . 
  i love doing it , but sadly most of the time anyone else thinks i 'm just being overly critical of them or whatever and end up getting shitty at me . 
  him or the bath ? 
  history minor , can confirm, 
  what new rule is n't being enforced ? 
  our defense force does more than just fight wars - there 's a lot you ca n't do with drones, 
  sure , [ here you go ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showpost.php?p=13628865&amp;postcount=1713 ), 
  also christchurch , now cloudy and cold, 
  oh good , you can take my place, 
  next time , maybe . 
  i do n't dance , so you 'd have been out of luck anyway . 
  i have my reasons for not going , told zero why already, 
  nah , i explained and he 's cool with it, 
  nah , not this time sorry . 
  feel free to flick me a pm if you want me to explain why . 
  as for the bribe , you could buy / u/zero1s the pint i owe him and i could do my best to show up next time to repay, 
  seriously ? 
  why did you think i was a chick ? 
  i got beaten by a 10 year old the other day , so probably not . 
  nah , he was buying me one if i showed and i was buying him one if i did n't, 
  surely if he was writing in the 50 's he 'd be firmly in favour of that stereotype ? 
  movies and tourism ? 
  oh nah i know , i was just trying to think what else enough of our economy is based around that it 'd be worthwhile . 
  maybe booze ? 
  kiwi here , this guy is ~ ~ the deputy leader ~ ~ a member of a party called `` new zealand first '' , which is a very centrist and populist political party that pretty much only has any significance because it 's independent from the major power blocs and is often the kingmaker in parliament . 
  its leader is a guy called [ winston peters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winston_peters ) who founded the party , and he 's a core figure in nz politics himself , having been there for almost 40 years now . 
  most people do n't pay any attention to the members of the party beyond winston , and there 's talk that it 'll collapse once he retires . 
  although at this stage i would n't be surprised if he 's still in parliament when he 's well into triple digits . 
  edit : sorry , got my mps mixed up . 
  this guy is just a normal mp , not the deputy leader, 
  i 'm expecting them to change it to exactly whatever we choose , but just slightly different so people still get them confused . 
  i for one look forward to new zealand 's annexation of australia under prime minister peters, 
  that article sounds like someone who is bitter that his design was n't chosen . 
  i 'm not saying it means his claim is n't valid , just that it 's not necessarily entirely a sham as he seems to be implying, 
  well yeah of course , but regardless there does seem to be a fair bit more public support for this flag than the alternatives , so adding it to the referendum makes sense . 
  it 's vote manipulation in that that we 'd need to be worried about , and unless john really wants his fern i doubt that 'll happen, 
  how much significance does indigenous culture have in modern mexican society ? 
  i 've seen day of the dead ( which looks amazing ) and that seems to have a very different flavour from traditional catholicism , so i 'm wondering whether it 's due to the different culture which mexico had when the spanish arrived ? 
  also along those lines , i 've seen heaps about day of the dead and it looks absolutely amazing ( i did a project on it for high school years ago , ) and it seems to be reasonably well known elsewhere as a mexican celebration alongside cinco de mayo . 
  are there any other festivals / celebrations like that that are more overlooked elsewhere ? 
  what are they like ? 
  what about a monthly photo contest , where the winner of the contest gets to choose the next theme ? 
  submissions have to be taken that month ( eg . 
  a photo for the october contest has to be taken in october ) and then we vote on the entries in the last three days of the month or whatever . 
  maybe something like / r/vexillology 's flag contests ? 
  australia is a very popular destination because it 's the closest country and is relatively similar to nz in terms of culture . 
  most kiwis also do an `` oe '' ( overseas experience ) where they go off to europe for 3 months - 1 year and travel around there , but that 's more of a one off rite of passage thing instead of a common holiday, 
  it 's a lot warmer , and most of the south island is either too rugged to support permanent settlements or is used up for farmland . 
  the north island also has auckland , which alone is about 1/3 of our whole population , so that inflates the north island 's population a fair bit . 
   what nz movies do you recommend ? 
  i liked `` once were warriors '' many years ago , that movie was sweet as . 
  there 's a few further up in this topic , personally i 'd suggest * boy * and * what we do in the shadows * as awesome examples of kiwi comedy and our film industry, 
   was the maori people assimilated by your culture ? 
  or do they preserve their culture ? 
  here we have many indigenous people yet . 
  we actually have one of the best records when it comes to colonists relating to the indigenous population . 
  there were a few conflicts and attempts to wipe out maori culture , but now a fair bit of it is part of new zealand culture as a whole . 
  even pakeha ( white new zealanders ) frequently say `` kia ora '' as a greeting , and many know maori counting and colours as well as a few maori songs ( or waiata . ), 
   what is the purpose of a haka ? 
  is it something common to be practiced in schools/universities/sports ? 
  depends on the haka . 
  some are war dances used as a challenge prior to battle ( like what the all blacks do with rugby if you 've seen them ) , while others are used at funerals as a sign of respect for the fallen . 
  there are a few videos further up again with a bit more detail . 
  sorry this is n't that much of a response , i have to go to work and do n't have enough time . 
  just wanted to try and give a bit of a response , but hopefully someone else can fill in some of the gaps for you, 
  wall street, 
  / r/outoftheloop would probably be better for something like this compared to / r/tipofmytongue, 
  i 'm guessing top is the redesign of the bottom ? 
  looks kind of familiar ...

  does any route actually have a stopover in auckland without going out of the way ? 
  huh , did n't expect anyone to go to that much effort . 
  suppose australia - sa makes sense , you 'd probably need to stop to get the extra fuel anyway . 
  that said , it does kind of make me want to set up an island hopper route that goes sydney to santiago via all the little islands in the way . 
  hah , i just asked the same thing . 
  could you actually see them , or just hear them ? 
  i was kind of thinking a weird version of geokoala , but yeah, 
  pls , i have to work in the mall all day . 
  i hate going out to take something to a car and seeing how nice the weather is, 
  oh , right . 
  clearly it 's too early here, 
  stuff that convinces them ? 
  convincing stuff, 
  i 'd like to nominate / u/muter , i was going to get him some the other day for his comment about his brother and running over at 3am to help him but i forgot to and now i feel bad, 
  why hello , im . 
  eh , did n't someone used to post limericks ? 
  it certainly made a splash when he announced it, 
  does it have to be one of those ? 
  i actually did n't mind the red and black one , but it did n't make the final four . 
  red and blue seems too much like a [ major ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2a/major_league_baseball.svg/1280px-major_league_baseball.svg.png ) [ league ] ( http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/500/nba.png?transparent=true ) [ sports ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2c/major_league_gaming_%28logo%29.svg/1280px-major_league_gaming_%28logo%29.svg.png ) logo , while blue and black is n't all that inspiring, 
   i wonder what the `` first '' red peak was . 
  i 'm sure you 'll get someone arguing it was the union jack before long, 
  or i just take coloured pencils into the ballot, 
  i dunno , he could pick sanders as his vp so that no-one decides to pick him off because the right would hate sanders as president even more than biden, 
  but i thought balchy was a * god * - king ?
