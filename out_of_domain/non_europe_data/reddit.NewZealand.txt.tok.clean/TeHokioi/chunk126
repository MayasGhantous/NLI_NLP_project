  just in the topic here would be sweet . 
  if imgur plays up and decides to compress it i might ask for a higher res version through dropbox or flickr or something , but we can sort that problem out at that point if need be, 
  shit , those are pretty good . 
  i 'll definitely give some of them a try out and see how they look , cheers, 
  approaching 20 degrees and nice and sunny down here in chch, 
  essay saga day 2 : lecturer came into the tutorial yesterday for history # 1 , told us she still has n't finished marking the first essays and is giving us another week for the second as a result . 
  down to two essays due by the 9th . 
  books issued for politics # 1 , have n't started work on anything else yet, 
  damn , these are awesome , thanks . 
  definitely going to try including a couple of them, 
  starting early i see , taking after / u/weathermannz ? 
  dress as a banana for their potassium content ? 
  i do n't mind them as long as they pull over to the side of the bloody road if they 're going slow, 
  awesome , cheers . 
  do you have higher res versions of # 3 , # 7 , # 8 , # 10 , # 11 , # 14 , # 18 , and # 26 ? 
  probably wo n't use all of them , but need higher res versions of them to see how they look, 
  / r/thatpicofnzfromspace is a favourite of mine, 
  / r/accidentalrenaissance - bunch of pictures that look like they could be paintings from the renaissance ( even though the subject matter is usually modern ), 
  you would n't happen to have higher res versions of # 12 , # 20 , and # 25 , would you ? 
  edit : just # 12 , forgot that i could zoom in ... 
  have you got a larger version of the last one ? 
  both a bit small at the moment , but the first one might be worth giving a shot if you 've got a higher res version, 
  how good is his english ? 
  retail could always be an option given it 's going into christmas season, 
  so yeah , maybe retail would be an option ? 
  especially if he only needs a job over the holiday season, 
   we should strive to rank near new zealand, 
  just as a bit more info on us , our last mass shooting was in [ 1990 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aramoana_massacre ) - arguably there was one last year at a [ winz office ] ( http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/regional/282965/two-minutes-silence-marks-ashburton-winz-shooting ) , but nowhere near the scale of these ones, 
  sorry about the horrible title - to explain it a bit better this is the claim by labrador that national had rights to the song , not eminem 's claim that they used the song . 
  season 7 and we 'll see her end up in micronesia just as tom finally arrives, 
  obviously they do n't know our investigative reputation, 
  depends on whether you 're including warhammer , i suppose - then there 'd be three melee games even without shogun , four if you include that, 
  i 'd find that way more interesting . 
  maybe do n't even include the americas , and focus on the old world + oceania . 
  scramble for africa and british india would be awesome, 
  i do n't think i 'd like having empty provinces set up colonies - maybe up like rupert 's land or something , but i 'd much rather have the indigenous populations represented in it and have colonialism as a conquest, 
  viking : total war, 
  genghis : total war, 
  crusade : total war, 
  there are ways of getting around it, 
  really ? 
  i thought we made them different enough , especially when you compare [ the ] ( http://i.imgur.com/01nimeo.png ) [ two ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2yo24fr.png ), 
  right , well i can now add walking past my brother 's room while he 's going at with his girlfriend to the list of things i never want to happen again . 
  protip : closing the door creates a more private and intimate atmosphere than your ` let 's get it on ' mixtape . 
  have you got any higher res versions ? 
  they 're all way too small to use at the moment, 
  only major event i can think of is the cricket world cup , but i ca n't think of how that would have affected statistics . 
  nothing else that major has happened this year , even the election was just over a year ago, 
  at the moment the smallest thing that annoys me most is people who drive along 60kph roads thinking it 's 50kph , then go 45 to be safe . 
  had two of them across both lanes yesterday , it 's a nightmare, 
  nah , they 're around the same age, 
  nah , couple years younger . 
  mum had told him to keep the door open , with the implication being ` do n't get up to anything ' - he just took what she asked at face value and went for it anyway, 
  no kosovo or south sudan , but western sahara is fully there ? 
  maybe scale it to be more in line with the proportions of the original ? 
  i did that once and / u/404colournotfound actually knew what book i was talking about , and was able to put it aside for me to go in and buy a couple days later, 
  those ones are awesome , dad had some as a kid and i remember being pulled along the park with them when i tried them out . 
  the noise they make when they 're swooping is awesome too, 
  yep - werewolves , not swearwolves, 
  i think i might take this advice , thanks, 
  it 's a trap , they 're just trying to lure you to hamilton, 
  oh come on , lighten up - was just poking fun at hamilton , no need to get defensive over it . 
  on a good day it 's my favourite place on earth , hands down . 
  unless you have one already there 's probably no need for a car - you can walk across the cbd in half an hour at most , and if you need to go further the public transport is fine . 
  as others have said , the only extant native land mammals we 've got are a couple bats , but we have quite a few marine mammals that are only found around nz . 
  the main ones are probably the hector 's dolphin and the nz fur seal , but there are quite a few other ones too . 
  beyond that though , we also have evidence that there used to be native rodents during the miocene , alongside crocodiles , snakes and flamingo-like birds that have long since died out . 
  essay saga day 4 : written the intro for politics # 1 , nothing else started . 
  five days until due date # 1, 
  ruins toast , but fixes the driveway, 
  want to know how your maps do in this thread ? 
  [ click here !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/tagprotesting/comments/379pd7/want_to_know_how_your_maps_do_in_this_upcoming/ ), 
   faq : * yes , you have to fill it out again . 
  every thread . 
  the link says it 's for thread # 53 , is it still the right one ? 
  want to make sure i do n't go and fill out something that 's not being used or whatever, 
  it 's on the conflict between humanitarian ideals and national sovereignty with regards to the nato intervention in kosovo , and whether there 's a middle ground which respects sovereignty but still allows for the enforcement of humanitarian beliefs, 
  oh , we make fun of auckland too . 
  hamilton here is kind of like hamilton in canada too , if that helps explain it, 
  have n't seen one , but heard one when i woke up early after a night camping on the west coast . 
  eerie as hell, 
  it 's almost like how you 'd pronounce the name , except going up at the end like a koowee sort of thing . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=498lyih-ycw ) is what it sounds like, 
  chch - windy as fuck but gorgeous otherwise - warm , sunny , 100 % chance of essays, 
  i see them flying over a fair bit on the way down to the ice , along with the globemasters and our c-130s, 
  any chance of getting some feedback on the one that i submitted ? 
  i 'll admit i thought it was a hay bale when i first saw someone post the video on facebook , but when i actually watched it it was pretty obvious it was a water tank, 
  essay saga day 5 : having written just another 100 words on politics # 1 yesterday , i 'm now firmly at the `` why the fuck did i sign up for this shit '' stage, 
  that reminds me , was watching hawaii five-0 yesterday and they spelt physiotherapy as `` fysiotherapie '' - i 'm not sure how that managed to get through or if they all thought it was right , but it was weird, 
  thankfully all of my ones are maximum 2000 words , but i think there 's like a + / -10 % thing with it so i ca n't under write too much, 
  politics # 1 is on conflict between sovereignty and humanitarian ideals in kosovo , politics # 2 is on why tunisia worked and egypt failed in the arab spring , history # 1 is on the effect of vietnam on us foreign policy , and history # 2 is on suleiman the magnificent . 
  both politics are due by friday , and both history are due by thursday / friday next week, 
  only realised it was on a couple minutes ago , was n't a match thread and i have no idea how to do the fancy bot table thing so i just posted the link to the black caps page on it instead . 
  even cricinfo did n't seem to have it on there , so i dunno what 's going on . 
  gorgeous day for it down here in chch though, 
  eh , it 's not as funny when it 's intentional, 
   what exactly are we getting now ? 
  fucked over ? 
  back to being private for me,
