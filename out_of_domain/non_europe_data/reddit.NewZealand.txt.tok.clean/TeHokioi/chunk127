  i definitely get a worse night 's sleep when it 's going , but that could easily just be due to the noise from the stronger wind, 
  yeah , it 's pretty much like that . 
  hot , dry air coming off the mountains . 
  personally i love it because it means it 's actually warm for once , but it also means that it whips up all the pollen off the plains and coats my car with it , and causes my hayfever to act up, 
  except for a couple bits around the big cities , all our highways are like that . 
  i 'd say some of the resident sources might feel annoyed at competition , but i dunno about the post itself . 
  i mean , / r/wellington had someone make a post offering to sell herself the other day , so stuff like this is n't necessarily unheard of, 
  oh hah , did n't think you lot knew there was country past the bombay hills, 
  why not just go airlift then ? 
  max distance would be two cities on opposite sides of the map, 
  norwegian ski infantry with altitude training and movement promos on a railroad ? 
  pretty sure there is , i tried to set up a 180 x 90 map and it crashed on game start . 
  think the giant earth map on ynaemp is as good as you 'll get, 
  i mean the certain people who offer to sell stuff at the meetups and through here , although i only know one outright . 
  asking and selling are fairly different as far as i 'm concerned , but again it 's a tricky issue as to whether nz law even applies to internet sites where the servers are n't in nz . 
  as for the drought , you 'd need to ask some of the more frequent users but afaik it 's in the summer months when demand goes up and supply drops that you get a drought . 
  maybe it was a 360x180 map i tried , i know it was tied to latitude somehow . 
  iirc there 's a limit on max map sizes regardless of computer specs , which is why we have n't got huge maps and the giant ones from ynaemp are just limited to ynaemp, 
  if it makes you feel better i have n't been north of wellington since 2005 except for a stopover at auckland airport . 
  been meaning to go on another trip round the north island at some point , just need to find people interested in going, 
  calling it now , national will pin it on her if it does n't go down well, 
  it 's good to see they 're actually fighting a bit for a good deal instead of just rolling over and preparing themselves, 
  damn , i should have gone down . 
  ooh , might head down - will have to see if i can knock these essays off tonight then, 
  you might have some luck if you 're booking for 2016-7 instead , doubt anything will still be free this late . 
  alternatively you could try somewhere a bit further out , like glenorchy or arrowtown - although if you 're wanting to go into queenstown for the celebrations it might be a bit far away, 
  essay saga day 6 : up to ~ ~ 800 ~ ~ ~ ~ 900 ~ ~ ~ ~ 1000 ~ ~ ~ ~ 1200 ~ ~ 1700 words on politics 1, 
  edit : almost finished politics 1 , and politics 2 due date has been extended to monday, 
  wait , have i got a different one or something ? 
  i 'm only seeing 59 ... 
  hah , sorry for not responding to your pm too - once these two are done it should be fine , the others can be knocked off in a day or two easy, 
  taking just one or two case studies is bound to be difficult by its very nature . 
  in contrast to what you 've suggested , nz , the uk and australia have much stricter gun laws and have drastically lower levels of gun violence . 
  australia has n't had a mass murder like what happens every month in the us since it imposed gun control in 1996 , and nz has n't had one since 1990 . 
  having not read the article yet , i 'd say it 'll be reduced compared to what it was going to be as oppose to reduced compared to what we have now . 
  i highly doubt they would have turned around after wanting to extend it and go the complete opposite way, 
  we 'd need to see the full text to be sure , but i 'm sure that 's how they 'd get around it if that 's the case . 
  the japanese do seem to be very protectionist even prior to the deal . 
  iirc they buy us rice to comply with their obligations under another agreement and then either let it rot or send it off in aid shipments , while retaining support for their own market, 
  alternatively we could throw in an anti-whaling thing into the treaty and see what they say . 
  that long-term will be the key - they claim it 's scientific anyway , so they can say their results will allow them to better conserve whales by learning their habits or some rubbish like that, 
  depends on where you are, 
  bloody jafas with their high speed internet and proper infrastructure ... 
  should mention it to the mods or something , see if they can add it somewhere to redirect the stories, 
  can i steal this ? 
  this happens to me so often it 'd be nice to have a term for it, 
  i 'm in chch , everything is relative, 
  at least you have decent roads to drive on, 
  but the copyright extension is a godsend for the hollywood lobby . 
  maybe we should do a mma style lobbyist fight to the death on the floor of congress ? 
  do i need to say `` copyright / u/cuzracecar 2015 '' each time i say it ? 
  does n't explain how he knows opotiki exists . 
  i 've only got one lecture tomorrow anyway , so i 'll probably still go . 
  plus one of my books has been recalled and if i do n't get it back tomorrow it costs me $ 3, 
  speaking of which , an outline of what changes to nz law are needed would be a good idea , since those are the main things that would actually change, 
  / u/baraka _ bama [ found ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/3nm6xr/tpp_what_we_now_know/cvpg32d ) this from the us release :, 
   tpp requires all members to combat wildlife trafficking , illegal logging , and illegal fishing , as well as prohibit some of the most harmful fishery subsidies and promote sustainable fisheries management practices . 
  tpp also requires that the 12 countries promote long-term conservation of whales , dolphins , sharks , sea turtles , and other marine species , as well as to protect and conserve iconic species like rhinos and elephants . 
  and tpp cracks down on ozone-depleting substances as well as ship pollution of the oceans , all while promoting cooperative efforts to address energy efficiency . 
  does n't really cover anything relating to dairy so much as fisheries and forestry ( which is aimed more at sea anyway ) so there may not be anything in that regard for us . 
  that 's weird , i 'm looking at [ a spotify one ] ( https://play.spotify.com/user/1269713605/playlist/5efy3msjo8qfkb5lonzuwc ) too and it 's only got 59 songs . 
  maybe it 's a licensing thing for nz ? 
  oh awesome , cheers . 
  might be a bit too tall still though , i have a feeling it 'd cut off some of the buildings . 
  any chance of being able to try get a wider one from mt vic or oriental bay during the day or something ? 
  thanks , look forward to it - i 'd give it a shot myself but do n't have time for a road trip right now so yeah, 
  per book per day , but that 's only for books recalled when someone else requests them, 
  essay saga day 7 : finished politics 1 , politics 2 due date extended to monday . 
  aiming for completion on saturday and starting history 1 on sunday . 
  eh , think of all the times you 've been and have n't been shot - even if you do get shot , do n't let that one time weigh you down compared to the hundreds of days you did n't, 
  i try - otherwise i 'd have given up on these damn essays long ago, 
  because i procrastinate and decide to screw future me over, 
  nah , i 'll just play some civ 5 and rain nuclear hellfire upon the world, 
  ~ ~ i have n't played it in ages ~ ~ nevermind , just remembered i played it last night after submitting politics 1 . 
  but nah , after exams you should totally reinstall it and download some mods . 
  i 'm about to release a bunch of huge ones after like two years of working on them , hopefully just after exams so yeah, 
  history 1 is on the legacy of the vietnam war in us foreign policy , and history 2 is on suleiman the magnificent ( if the books are there ), 
  hey , i still have three days before politics 1 was due and it 's submitted already !, 
  oh cool , there 's a maori one too and i 'm planning a michael joseph savage one hopefully for this year if i find time . 
  but nah , the big mods i 'm almost done with are way bigger , like [ completely new era ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5vxtolv.jpg ) big, 
  to be fair , if it 's anything like uc many people stay home anyway, 
  just comment , or submissions too ? 
  and even if nothing happens , i doubt people will do as good on a test with this on their mind as they would normally,

  did n't they also detonate them at times when the area was empty , like at night or whatever ? 
  well , that and lincoln still being there . 
  another one of these and we might need a megathread for them . 
  are you still planning to ignore what everyone has said and tell them before you move out ? 
  you got rejected from what ? 
  regarding your family situation or your job ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  you 've got an abusive family and they thought it was a good idea * not * to leave ? 
  could always do ilam apartments for a year while you look for another one , or ask friends or something, 
  does n't have my car : /, 
  you can stay in them [ over summer ] ( http://www.ucastudentvillage.co.nz/summer-stays.html ) , which would work to get you out of your current place while you look for somewhere else , whether you stay in them during the whole year or just over summer to get somewhere or whatever . 
  i dunno , but you 're not doing yourself any favours by staying, 
  wait , why ? 
  i just suggested ilam apartments , and you could always look for another flat to move into, 
  wait , am i seeing things or is there text in the splatter ?
