  ** mexico - guadalupe victoria **, 
  * plan of iguala * - artifacts in the empire provide +2 culture for the capital . 
  borders expand 20 % faster, 
  * unique unit : * rurales , replaces riflemen . 
  provides +2 local happiness when garrisoned in a city , and recieves +10 % combat strength when fighting in friendly territory, 
  * unique unit : * zapatista , replaces gatling gun . 
  stronger , but does not have a ranged attack . 
  instead , the zapatista ignores terrain costs , and recieves a combat bonus when fighting in rough terrain . 
  receieve a 20 % combat boost when fighting on a pillaged tile . 
  credit goes to / u/sukritact for the dom and lua scripts , / u/leugi for the leader scene , other lua and unit model modifications , and janboruta for the uu and leader icons . 
  i did the map and civ icon , and / u/professorbread did the civilopedias . 
  the civ comes with unique peace and war themes , both of which come from the [ mexican bicentenary performance of danz\u00f3n no .

  i hope you do n't mind all these mod posts !, 
  also remember that we 're always open to ideas , and while we have a lot on our plate at the moment ( big things coming soon ... ) i always love to hear civ ideas and might try and get them into a civ mod of some sort , even if it 's using the mechanic for another civ, 
  not a dumb question at all !, 
  given the ua is artifact related it ca n't be brought back to g&k , but if you were to delete that lua file and get rid of the bnw dependency it * might * work, 
  we did think about it , but it 's been done a fair bit with ranged cavalry uu ( keshik , camel archer etc. ), 
  so i do n't think it 's that much of an issue . 
  i tried to give it dual upgrade path to melee or ranged , but that did n't work, 
  it needs bnw , but it should be fine without g&k, 
  true , but that also means that you do n't necessarily need to upgrade them further . 
  i usually do n't upgrade beyond crossbowmen unless i can get +1 range, 
  we can , ekmek figured it out . 
  it 's quite a bit of work though , and we 're still limited to existing animations . 
  we 've decided that we can get better quality through sticking to 2d , so until we can get better 3d leaderheads then we 're probably going to stick to them, 
  the flavours should have been updated accordingly , but i 'll double check that . 
  i 'm not sure i updated them from the ayyubids , which will cause some issues, 
  not yet - we 're still making changes to the leaderhead and finalising the uniques . 
  but we have big stuff planned before then, 
  it also helps to protect against foreign influence , and i think it might count when the hotels and airports are built, 
  it will be much harder to take it back to vanilla , since g&k changed a lot of how the game works . 
  it 's worth a shot , but i would n't guarantee anything, 
  yeah , that 's why i said it should work without g&k, 
  i 'm pretty sure there 's a mod somewhere that adds agave as a resource, 
  no ideas for planes yet , since we usually stay away from modern civs , but ships is another ball game . 
  we already have the dhow for kilwa , and a couple of the civs coming up are heavily naval-oriented ( chola and minoans ) and have naval uu, 
  i think we already have some of the art from someone else who was working with us and on his own , but had to leave for personal reasons . 
  so switzerland is definitely a possibility, 
  yes , it does, 
  yeah , there is . 
  the link is on my top-level comment with the civ details, 
  download it from civfanatics , then manually place it in the mod folder :, 
  my documents / my games / sid meier 's civilization v / mods, 
  ( i think that 's the file path , i 'm not sure with a mac ), 
  yeah , it is, 
  no subreddit that i know of , but i would suggest heading over to [ civfanatics ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com ) , since the modding section there is very active and the modders are usually more than happy to help with any questions you have after the tutorials,

   she certainly is exotic and beautiful and smart and our stunt guys are over the moon, 
  oh i bet they are ... not that i blame them at all, 
  this comes up every couple of years , and only when john key wants to distract the public from something bigger going on - in this case , the opposition announcing election year policies, 
  i have a feeling that it 's going to be the same map style as the original - since finding a route to china is a key focus , having a realistic map would provide an unfair advantage to the player since they know straight away to head south . 
  back in vanilla , i had a keshik get every single promotion possible . 
  it took two japanese bombers and an infantry to bring it down . 
  in retaliation for the killing of the keshik , i burnt every japanese city to the ground, 
  let 's make it happen , reddit !, 
  would make sense , given the `` somewhere in there is nz '' comment, 
  we talking about the same guy ?

  i 'm guessing it 's a * frozen * reference,

  tyrian purple is such a beautiful colour, 
  much edge, 
  i 've been having a few issues with searching for it , so you might need to try the direct link posted earlier - that worked for me, 
  but it 's for charity , so surely they could tone it down a bit ? 
  also , [ here ] ( https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/invisible-single/id808571195 ) is a direct link to the itunes page if you had issues getting to it like i did, 
  yeah , except in some places rabbits are pests , and so hunting is used to protect the environment . 
  these guys , on the other hand ... 
  as long as that 's taking votes away from the conservative party i 'm not going to complain, 
  well that 's not his fault , he just needs to get better researchers, 
  i 'd rather have winston in parliament than john , personally, 
  from the [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_hawaii#kanaka_maoli_flag ) :, 
   at the center of the flag is a green shield bearing a coat of arms of the kanaka maoli , made up of the royal kahili , the original hawaiian royal standard . 
  crossing this kahili are two paddles , representing both voyaging traditions of hawaiians , and kamehameha 's k\u0101n\u0101wai m\u0101malahoe . 
  there are nine stripes , unlike the eight striped flag of the present state of hawaii . 
  each stripe represents a hawaiian island . 
  they include : hawaii island , maui , kahoolawe , lanai , molokai , oahu , kauai , niihau , and nihoa . 
  the last of these was officially part of the kingdom of hawaii during the reign of kamehameha iv even though it was not inhabited . 
  according to this flag 's promoters , the green in the flag represents the maka ` ainana ( commoners ) , the land and goodness ; the red represents the landed konohiki ( middle class ) , genealogy and strength ; and the yellow represents the alii , spirituality and alertness to danger . 
  i 'm not a fan of the witch hunts for getting stuff wrong , so of course . 
  that does n't mean i 'll excuse arrogance , though, 
  well , no . 
  i was thirteen . 
  first time as an eligible voter this year, 
  except with more dinosaurs, 
  cheers - international politics is more my thing though, 
  it 's a recreation of it , but it 's a very real possibility that it is the actual flag . 
  no other polynesian groups have had flags per se prior to european contact , which occurred in hawaii prior to unification ( king kamehameha i 's army apparently had muskets and cannons ) . 
  so there is a chance that the shield design was present in hawaii at the time the islands were unified and the kingdom declared in the late 18th century, 
  edit : i 'm more inclined to believe this now , given the kingdom had a proper [ coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_kingdom_of_hawaii.svg/1000px-royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_kingdom_of_hawaii.svg.png ), 
  the video sounds more like classic u2 to me , i 'm not so sure about the itunes version, 
  edit : i like the bits that there were on the facebook ` behind the scenes ' version too , which i 'm hoping is the album version since they 're at electric ladyland, 
  hell , it 's even insulting to religious communities, 
  bottom left and right are icons for india , to replace the mughal fort ( which goes to the mughals ) and war elephant ( which goes to maurya ) . 
  that 's all i 'll give away at the start , so here 's hoping you guys are good guessers !, 
  edit : i will say one more thing , that these icons are done once again by the amazing artists that are / u/sukritact and janboruta . 
  be sure to give them full credit for the icons , not me !, 
  i just do xml stuff ... ( and sometimes maps ),
