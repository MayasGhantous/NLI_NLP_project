  i 'd suggest maybe having both specific stuff on resources and following those resources through , and more general stuff on the role of resources in history overall . 
  something i just thought of , maybe add a username field so we can contact them if we need clarification or whatever ? 
  oh wow , do n't know how i got confused . 
  for some reason i thought they said beside the soviet flag , which is the one of republican spain . 
  not sure what the one in the bottom left is though, 
  should probably start working on your alcohol tolerance now, 
  i 'd gladly take a class before 10am if it means i can get fridays off , which i 've managed to do two out of the last three semesters, 
  does that count though , given it 's an instrumental ? 
  obligatory roxanne , and van morrison 's gloria, 
  dousing it in speights first helps it burn better , but it 's a waste of booze so it may not be worth it, 
  yeah , good luck with that at otago ... 
  just remembered , could you add in suzie q and hello mary lou , both by creedence clearwater revival ? 
  edit : maybe the queen version from wembley instead for hello mary lou ? 
  it 's a little more upbeat, 
  edit 2 : sorry to keep doing this , but maybe maria , maria by santana and the product g&b or whatever too ? 
  dammit spotify !, 
  like hell i 'm gon na vote for a dictator, 
  * lisa , i want to buy your rock *, 
  god , i did n't realise this was kevin spacey voicing it . 
  i want to hear it now , seems like something that 'd be a perfect monologue in house of cards . 
  i 'd say it 's probably the same in reverse in that regard though, 
  surely providing notification and contact info and all that would count as assistance ? 
  i have real trouble with civilisation because i 'm so used to using z for the game itself . 
  feel like i need to go listen to rule britannia or god save the queen or something to get back the right sort of english, 
  you joke , but there pretty much is one ( sort of ) and it 's because we 're the launching base for their antarctic missions . 
  they 're based out of christchurch airport where they have [ their own hangar ] ( http://m6.i.pbase.com/o4/93/329493/1/63515636.cginijf6.sydchcdec05035.jpg ) and headquarters , and during summer you get the c-130s , globemasters and formerly the starlifters flying over late at night on their way back . 
  it 's awesome, 
  no room , we can only have two, 
  just use the tbd thing that 's stickied, 
  ah okay , no worries, 
  that was the only way i was able to figure out how to stop the text from overlapping when there 's a text and image flair , i think the text is indented or something or there 's padding set up in the css or something iirc, 
  coder pls :(, 
  oh well yeah , that 's a bit far from / r/nzcss - if anything they 'll think you 're looking at a tourism website, 
  which fits with the current `` they 'll get a fourth term '' rhetoric . 
  assuming little does n't pull a win out from under his hat , labour just need to get someone young and charismatic in and get the party in line and it should be hopefully a win . 
  heh , ` just ', 
  [ you must be new here ] ( https://reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/2nem47/can_you_have_a_garden_in_new_zealand/ ), 
  * this is what the people want ? 
  so be it *, 
  you joke , but the australian aboriginal team ( i think they 're union but might be league ) sometimes do an awesome dreamtime dance before the start of the match which is pretty kickass . 
  i think that 's something to do with the competition , the maori team have people with taiaha and in traditional clothing too, 
  what if trip is lash ? 
  i feel like half the subreddit is in america at the moment, 
  i have n't had a proper relationship per se , but with regards to the closest thing i 've had to one ( which was a colossal mess and i think i 've talked about it a couple times on here before ) i do n't have proper contact with either girl involved , but when i do see them it 's fairly different between the two . 
  one of them i try to avoid at all costs and will normally walk the other way if i see her , but the other is the same as when i see any other person i know from high school but do n't really keep in contact with - the whole ` hi how are you ' sort of thing as you 're passing, 
  you have an amish guy on * facebook ? 
  it 's his partner 's mum i think , not his mum, 
   justin trudeau does not have `` strong left wing policies '' , he 's very much in the middle of canadian politics . 
  hence why voters rejected the actual left wingers in the ndp . 
  i 'd say it 's relative - compared to the conservatives he 's left wing , which is what would have mattered during the election . 
  having the ndp further to the left would have meant they do n't come across as quite so left , but still different enough to be appealing, 
  i 've never heard of them being called pillars , always either stumps or wickets, 
  pls, 
  also tags do n't work in self posts so / u/luckyspammer wo n't get a notification, 
  huh , i thought it was because the capitals were n't there but that makes sense too, 
  i was actually going to make it so that only you were able to use it , but i can leave it as other people able to access it if you want, 
  wonder if you could set them up to be diagonal keys ? 
  if autocorrect changed a word to * eutybner v * then either your spelling is way too far gone or it 's been drinking just as much as you, 
  in other words `` we could n't afford proper houses '', 
  is your name boy ? 
  i actually did have snow on christmas in queenstown once . 
  new years is generally a scorcher though if you 're lucky . 
  east coast gets pretty hot in summer too with the nor ` wester . 
  got to 40 a couple years ago in feb, 
  should send it back , they 'll need it with that massive snow dump they got last year, 
  i spent way too long trying to figure out how you 'd interview a kokako , then i realised you were the one being interviewed, 
  yeah , that sounds about right with the weather down here - 24 going on 4 - surprised to hear the road to coronet peak was open though , although i suppose they use it for skippers too do n't they ? 
  paging / u/nilnz, 
  found a website that has awesome historical maps available to buy , so the only question now is whether to go with [ 1875 ] ( http://orig08.deviantart.net/0855/f/2014/083/2/7/the_world___1875_by_jaysimons-d7bgvfr.jpg ) , [ 1914 ] ( http://orig01.deviantart.net/49e0/f/2014/083/2/1/the_world___1914_by_jaysimons-d7bgu1z.jpg ) , or [ 1938 ] ( http://orig10.deviantart.net/70d3/f/2014/084/3/0/the_world___1938_by_jaysimons-d7bgq92.jpg ) ? 
  [ pffft , that 's a problem for future me ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cxvya3o.gif ), 
  retail 's the same , everyone else is out enjoying the sun and i 'm stuck in a windowless mall which is the same temperature day in , day out, 
  i was out of town during the easter event . 
  managed to get the easter egg with my 500 ping mobile internet but missed out on the carrot, 
  still none the wiser about which map to get , so figured i 'd ask again and see if anyone had an opinion - [ 1875 ] ( http://orig08.deviantart.net/0855/f/2014/083/2/7/the_world___1875_by_jaysimons-d7bgvfr.jpg ) , [ 1914 ] ( http://orig01.deviantart.net/49e0/f/2014/083/2/1/the_world___1914_by_jaysimons-d7bgu1z.jpg ) , or [ 1938 ] ( http://orig10.deviantart.net/70d3/f/2014/084/3/0/the_world___1938_by_jaysimons-d7bgq92.jpg ) ? 
  arrowtown , and it was barely proper snow, 
  could n't you just have unsubscribed without creating a new account ? 
  i did, 
  oh right , create an account as opposed to creating a new account . 
  i thought he meant that he already had an account but created a new one to unsubscribe, 
  if they wanted ones for show we 'd still have bolas and whatever singapore was :(, 
  holy crap , how 'd you know again ? 
  i do n't remember seeing you round / r/newzealand or / r/chch, 
  oh wow , that 's insane . 
  i 'm at uc currently doing my bachelors too , small world, 
  the image is gone :( i wanted to see the squirrel, 
  holy shit , i did n't realise their tails were that fluffy, 
  yeah , i was getting link removed until sehrah fixed it a couple minutes ago, 
  i suppose , but then that 's just requiring someone to have a reddit account . 
  if you 're wanting to encourage participation it should be tied to posts on the subreddit or something, 
  brings back memories of the end of year geography exams , always a topo map of somewhere in the country, 
  i just liked it because i could actually do well , unlike the other one which we had to do, 
  do you take any hayfever medication ? 
  i got the same thing a while back when i took cetirizine hydrochloride ( active ingredient in zyrtec and a bunch of the other ones ) for the hayfever , turns out nosebleeds are a side effect of it, 
  depends on where you are now and what you want to study, 
  it could be that too , some nasal sprays weaken the lining of your nose making nosebleeds more likely . 
  do you use it in the morning or at night ? 
  aww , i was at work for the whole thing :( any chance of another soon ? 
  at least in neutral flag i 'd put it in the same camp as a sui - if you 're able to , delaying so that your team is able to get a better chance as opposed to capping straight away works out better for your team ultimately, 
  yeah , i 'm not talking about in this instance . 
  i 'm talking about in general , it 's not always waot,
