  depends on what sort of game you want . 
  i 'd recommend [ infoaddict ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=391069 ) and [ yet ( not ) another earth map pack ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showpost.php?p=13628865&amp;postcount=1713 ) as mods which do n't change that much gameplay but still are must-haves . 
  infoaddict gives you a ton more information and stuff like graphs which you can compare to other civs and find your progress and so on , while ynaemp has a bunch of true start location earth maps ( so that the maori always start in new zealand or russia at moscow ), 
  as far as new mechanics go , there 's quite a few i 'd suggest . 
  [ events & decisions ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=528549 ) adds a decision system , where you 've got a bunch of different options you can enact to give you certain rewards . 
  civs and religions all tend to have their own unique decisions and events - for example , if you 're catholic you can convene the papal conclave once per era , which exchanges one magistrate ( a resource added for the mod ) for a lump sum of gold and culture , or if you 're the maori you can develop the technology of the gunfighter pa , which gives units stationed in the pa a boost when fighting against gunpowder units . 
  other mods also expand on this system , such as [ cultural diversity ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=521664 ) , which assigns each civ a cultural group ( western , oceanic , turkic etc. ), 
  the cultural groups have small unique bonuses ( bharata start with a shrine and the bantu start with a spearman , for example ) , and a bunch more flavourful stuff such as splash screens , soundtracks , embarkation graphics and so on . 
  beyond that , there 's also [ piety ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=529810 ) , which adds state religions and expands religion as a whole ; [ exploration continued expanded ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=543208 ) which does as the name suggests and expands exploration as a concept ; and [ mercenaries ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=552053 ) which i partially worked on and adds in the ability to hire other unique units or dedicated mercenary units as mercenaries . 
  if i 'm allowed to blow my own trumpet a bit there 's also [ the enlightenment era ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=551446 ) which i released the other day , which adds an entirely new era to the game along with associated wonders , buildings , units and so on . 
  as far as new civs are concerned , there are a few projects which have all of their civs to a reasonably consistently high standard . 
  there 's my own one of [ more civilisations ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=494241 ) ( which also includes some splits of vanilla civilisations , such as splitting polynesia into the maori , hawaii , tonga , and rapa nui , ) [ jfd 's civilisations ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=474393 ) ( if you like having five different russias ) , [ tomatekh 's ones ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=472751 ) , [ colonialist legacies ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=512802 ) which adds primary first nation and colonial civs , and [ patria grande ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=488283 ) , which adds a bunch of civs from latin america though is now a bit outdated . 
  there are a few others too if you dig around in the new civs subforum with varying degrees of polish , though some might not be up to date with everything . 
  hey , he said he did n't buy it , not that it is n't his, 
  the civilian 's doing well lately , he just published this one as well : [ a man refused to be served by a black air hostess . 
  what happened next will generate advertising revenue ] ( http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/a-man-refused-to-be-served-by-a-black-air-hostess-what-happened-next-will-generate-advertising-revenue/ ), 
  speak for yourself, 
  generally pretty good , no fights or anything and both my parents are really supportive of both me and my brother . 
  that said , they used to be fairly overprotective , and as a result i do n't share much about my personal life and have n't done so since mum came down to school in year 5 and had a go at a kid that was picking on me in front of the whole school . 
  so yeah . 
   you 'll want 8gb of ram to do pretty much anything these days . 
  he 's doing a fair bit of photo processing , i 'd say 8gb would be a bare minimum and he 'd be better to go for more, 
  eh , it 's better than the doorbell shorting the house out like what happens at my place, 
  they 're going to be at eb games levels before too long, 
  bit optimistic , i would have thought, 
  it 's [ a fair bit bigger ] ( http://genuineevaluation.com/wp-content/uploads/us-nz-size.jpg ) than maps normally make it out to be,

  51st state here we come, 
  * in a shock move , the tiny manawatu town of eketahuna has been chosen by the government as the new capital of the country , a move which has been done to ` stimulate employment in the regions ' according to minister stephen joyce . 
  meanwhile , the unemployment rate in wellington has skyrocketed , which mr. joyce claims is nothing but an odd coincidence *, 
   yeah mate well ya know oim strayan an ' oi spent bloody well quarter - ` our fig ` rin out ` ow t ' fuckin ' say th ' bloody word redneck in fuckin ' french so sod off an ' eat a fuckin ' didgeridoo cunt, 
  fixed it, 
  there should be a comma , but they do n't know how to use grammar, 
  i 've always used some version of an nz bird as my usual online name since whenever , latest one when i joined was pouakai - and since that was taken i went with another name for the same legend, 
  it 's kind of still like that . 
  rent in the major cities is fairly expensive , but we have a high minimum wage so if you 're on your own and working full-time you can easily sustain yourself on it . 
  i got my first job almost two years ago , and while my costs are lower ( do n't have to pay rent or whatever ) i was still able to save up enough to buy a car and cover a year of uni within the first year of working there . 
  i 've heard about them , but do n't remember seeing it at all in the nz media . 
  that 's embarrassing about the nz government refusing to pay for them though , i had no idea . 
  and then after that it 's easy :, 
  and so on until twenty :, 
  and so on . 
  there are still a lot of issues facing new zealand as a country . 
  child poverty as zero has said , a poor environmental record by the current government , low quality state houses , a disproportionate crime rate amongst maori and polynesian groups and so on, 
  we have a huge music industry here in new zealand . 
  back in may ( which is nz music month here ) i did [ a series of posts ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/37vlql/patea_maori_club_poi_e_nz_music_month_day_31/crq5g41 ) featuring a different kiwi artist each day , with some songs from each of them . 
  i 'd suggest giving them a listen , as they cover a much wider variety of music than i 'll be able to in this post . 
  one of the main ` kiwi ' genres of music is known as ` nz reggae ' or ` bbq reggae ' , since it 's the music you put on when you 're having a bbq over summer . 
  some of the main bands in this genre are [ fat freddy 's drop ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecjg63szil4 ) , [ the black seeds ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdyucmoikl0 ) and [ katchafire ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3lr__j8p0 ) , though there 's a fair few more than just them . 
  [ this playlist ] ( https://play.spotify.com/user/spotifyaustralia/playlist/3qkhcoyxlwupsusvha5rko ) has a bit of a better selection , so yeah . 
  oh hey gpuzzle , how goes it ? 
  does tarcisio know you 're thinking of ditching him as the resident civ brazillians ? 
  basically i 'd second what tumeke said , come over here on a working holiday for a bit . 
  that way you 're able to get a feel for the country and it 's the easiest way to get here and start work and all that . 
  there are more options after that i think depending on your circumstance and what you 'd like to do , but i do n't know enough about it to say so definitively sorry, 
  pretty sure you 're getting your island chains [ mixed up ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maldives ) mate, 
  does n't surprise me , i got woken up at 7am the other day with fireworks when we won the world cup, 
  why do n't you like / r/nz ? 
  depending on how long you have here there 's a ton of different stuff you can do . 
  what i normally suggest is this :, 
  from auckland , head down the west coast of the north island and check out [ waitomo caves ] ( http://sites.psu.edu/explorenewzealand/wp-content/uploads/sites/23334/2015/02/glowwormz.jpg ) and [ taranaki ] ( http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1359317794/365/8231365.jpg ) ( mt taranaki was used as a stunt double for mt fuji in * the last samurai . 
  * ) then head down the [ kapiti coast ] ( http://www.kapiticoastairport.co.nz/images/flight-information/flight-information-hero.jpg ) to [ wellington ] ( http://www.builtinwellington.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/city1.jpg ) and take some time to explore the city , since it 's awesome . 
  then take the [ ferry ] ( https://www.transfercar.co.nz/blog/wp-content/uploads/interislander.jpg ) across cook strait to the south island . 
  head west , and check out [ abel tasman national park ] ( http://www.abeltasmankayaks.co.nz/assets/guided/hero-images/hero-remote-coast.jpg ) before heading down the west coast of the south island . 
  head through the [ buller gorge ] ( https://giveitaburl.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/hawks-crag-buller-gorge.jpg ) before stopping at [ punakaiki ] ( http://s1.eventfinda.co.nz/uploads/locations/transformed/77902-4170-7.jpg ) . 
  keep heading down and you 'll reach the glaciers , which are two townships near [ franz josef ] ( http://www.glaciercountry.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/franz-josef-anthony-cramp.jpg ) and [ fox glaciers ] ( http://static.thousandwonders.net/fox.glacier.original.27527.jpg ) . 
  then you go through the [ gates of haast ] ( http://lynx-travel.com/vacations/nz2000/wanaka/gates%20of%20haast%20bridge%20over%20haast%20gorge.jpg ) and end up in [ wanaka ] ( http://www.peakfunctions.co.nz/wanaka/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/lake-wanaka.jpg ) . 
  spend a couple days in [ queenstown ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/queenstown_from_bob's_peak.jpg ) , visit [ arrowtown ] ( https://bessiejb.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_6905.jpg ) , take the [ shotover jet ] ( http://www.shotoverjet.com/assets/header-images/_resampled/croppedimage1026552-header-images-2.jpg ) and all that . 
  definitely visit [ milford sound ] ( https://scribblesnz.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_5502.jpg ) , since [ the road there ] ( http://flashpackatforty.com/wp-content/gallery/road-trip-to-wanaka/milford-road-drive.jpg ) is absolutely amazing . 
  then head up [ lewis pass ] ( http://c0481729.cdn2.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/p-7100835f-bba1-713f-04e632d0a32af931-3747524.jpg ) to the mackenzie country , past [ lake pukaki and mount cook ] ( https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/60033316/m%3d2048/455c7843e52c7ad1697505e584664fbb ) ( our highest mountain , the big one in the middle ) and before long you end up on the [ canterbury plains ] ( http://www.fourcorners.co.nz/content/plugins/operator/images/800x600scale/e78ff881-d492-b4c5-d91fe771c9006951.jpg ) . 
  stop off in [ christchurch ] ( http://www.maui.co.nz/sitecollectionimages/locations-holiday/large-christchurch.jpg ) and check out some of the [ damage ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/cathedral_square_2402.jpg ) from [ our earthquake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_christchurch_earthquake ) , then head up the [ kaikoura coast ] ( http://bartlettandcorfe.co.nz/content/images/2014/nov/coastal-road-to-kaikoura.jpg ) and back to the ferry . 
  this time head up the middle of the island , and drive state highway 1 over the [ desert road ] ( https://www.rankers.co.nz/system/experience_images/12191/large.jpg?1364274083 ) and past [ mt ruapehu ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8460/7984385454_ffdefdc5c0_b.jpg ) ( one of three active volcanoes in the central plateau , another being mt ngauruhoe in the other image and the third as [ mount tongariro ] ( http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/u/tvyamnb-bivtnwcoxtkc5xgbugkimh_nj4ujhqkuoxvoxgbdsf10il-51azdrs6n83e5llg2ouwelw/ ) ) until you reach [ lake taupo ] ( http://info.geonet.org.nz/download/attachments/950636/lake-taupo-28761-lge.jpg?api=v2 ) , one of the largest volcanoes on earth . 
  it 's been the source of two separate recent eruptions , one of which is the biggest on earth in the last 5000 years and darkened skies in rome and china , and the other was the largest in the past 70,000 years . 
  so yeah . 
  further up is [ rotorua ] ( http://cache-graphicslib.viator.com/graphicslib/destination/rotorua-141702.jpg ) , which is like our version of [ yellowstone ] ( http://www.rotoruanz.com/getattachment/data/listings/tnz/elite-adventures/elite-2.jpg/?width=550&amp;height=370&amp;ext=.jpg ) . 
  there 's also the coromandel and northland , but i have n't been there yet so i would n't know what sights to recommend . 
  edit : forgot the chch pic, 
  we have / r/nzcirclejerk , though sometimes they 're one and the same . 
  the mods are getting better at policing it though, 
  i currently live in christchurch , but i grew up in wellington . 
  personally , i absolutely love wellington . 
  you can walk across the cbd in half an hour , the public transport is amazing , and you can always discover new things . 
  i remember one time when i visited , we walked into a bookstore , took the lift at the back to the third floor , then went out into a tiny little courtyard thing between buildings , took a flight of stairs up and a little boardwalk thing before ending up at this amazing cafe / bar up on top of the bookstore , that you 'd never be able to find unless you knew where to go . 
  on a good day you ca n't beat it , hands down . 
  christchurch is decent , it 's currently undergoing a huge reconstruction project since the earthquakes destroyed a lot of the city . 
  i guess it 's the same reason why african-americans can use certain terms which would be super offensive if a white person said them ? 
  have you actually play civ 5 in its current state ? 
  it 's miles better and is easily the best game in the series, 
  do you use mods ? 
  there are some great ones which add some of that back in, 
  make sure you 've updated to v3 , pretty sure i fixed that, 
  is n't it * sid meier 's alpha centauri * though , not part of the civilization franchise ? 
  no cheating challenge ? 
  is n't the star wars console already out ? 
  congrats , got much planned over the summer ? 
  i 'd say we 've been in a fairly good position right from the start . 
  there were a few wars between pakeha ( europeans ) and maori , but on the whole it was much more peaceful than elsewhere and the indigenous population was treated with much more respect ( unlike other colonies we actually had a treaty between britain and the maori instead of just conquest . ), 
  our fertile land meant we had a very strong agricultural economy which was crucial during the later stages of the british empire and the wars , while our relatively small size meant it was much easier to develop the country . 
  by the time we were founded the enlightenment had also given birth to much more liberal ideals , so we 've been historically much more left leaning as a country which has led to a much stronger and centralised state . 
  the prime minister who first brought in the welfare state , michael joseph savage , is one of the most revered prime ministers we 've had , and was respected from both sides of the aisle , as it were .
