  this part might be a bit more controversial depending on your political outlook , but i would still argue that like the scandinavian countries , having a strong central government with a focus on the wellbeing of its citizens has been integral to our success . 
  on that note , we also have a remarkably stable and peaceful political system . 
  since introducing mmp ( a voting system ) in 1996 we 've had mainly minority governments , which is panic inducing in most other anglophone countries yet here it 's par for the course and forces cooperation between parties instead of the constant unwillingness to compromise seen in america . 
  and until recently there had been very few instances of politics interfering with the media , ensuring freedom of the press and large amounts of personal liberties . 
  answered the idh one , though potentially somewhat controversially and i 'm half expecting someone to come in and argue over the politics of it, 
  obviously do n't take relations with indigenous population into account, 
  i dunno , like i said on another one i 'm pretty sure it 's not part of the main civ franchise . 
  i think that 's why they used beyond earth instead of alpha centauri 2 , since someone else owns the name for it, 
  the block is the only one of this sort of show that i can tolerate , simply because it 's possible to focus on the renovations instead of the drama . 
  at least with the australian one , have n't watched the nz one this time, 
  between this and the masterchef / x-factor cancellations i bet mediaworks is pleased it invested so much in buying these big international formats, 
  i like this idea . 
  bonus points for actual fryders, 
  be there !, 
  ** be there !, 
  be there !, 
  oh wow , so i 'm guessing there 's only going to be two more spills before then ? 
  hell , i like them just because of the names . 
  could there be one with the normal skin ? 
  i have no idea what anything is, 
  pretty sure we have the most subreddits per capita now too , if the sidebar is to be believed, 
   i helped create ... 
  surely if he lived on the side always facing earth he 'd see it every day ? 
  unless he 's talking about the earthrise itself i suppose, 
  what about the desirability of a tan , would that have any impact down the line ? 
  although i 'd say at the current rate a far likelier cause of developing darker skin would be due to mixed marriages and all that, 
  how difficult is it to make the cut ? 
  i 've been considering picking up law as a double degree with pols , since just a ba in that on its own is n't that much, 
  i 'll send cookies , i 've been told they have the ability to remind people of their childhoods, 
  that was pretty decent , first time i 've actually seen him as prime minister material and seems more like something out of the american political system , so yeah, 
  does your tv not come with freeview built in ? 
  croatian ? 
  why them ? 
  oh of course , i was meaning more in regards to their use of speeches which we seem to lack as much of here, 
  at least there 's still going to be one there from the sound of it :, 
   wellington sculpture trust chairwoman sue elliott said the new orb should look `` exactly the same '' as the old one to the untrained eye . 
  i 'd be pretty annoyed if they went and got rid of it altogether , so i 'm glad they 're keeping pretty much the same thing there, 
  evening post would be awesome . 
  and while we 're at it , i reckon we should change the quote to balchy 's one later on from the current one :, 
   maybe , maybe not , maybe fuck yourself . 
  goddamnit , i always miss these . 
  soon as i saw they were the answers i went back and looked at the questions having not cheated and only got four out of nine , which is annoying . 
  i was only off by one election with the first one though, 
  nah , it 's more a fact of me being slack and not checking the morning thread . 
  my excuse is that i was at the doctors, 
  should be done soon , i think we 're on the home straight with bugs . 
  night mode and link filters are the last things to be done , i think . 
  care to weigh in / u / - halcyon , / u/honourandsacrifice , / u/dirtyformal ? 
  lawl is n't a mod though , right ? 
  are you meaning in general or for night mode ? 
  really ? 
  i tried and could n't reproduce the glitch . 
  does it happen for you on / r/askscience as well , since they use the same rotating header code ? 
  yeah , still ca n't get it to work . 
  maybe it 's a chrome thing ? 
  also need to make a start on the wiki, 
  slightly blue could work , though i think the best idea would be to sort out the header image first and then base it off that . 
  might need to change the flair colours too , since stuff which has been made faint to blend in will stick out on night mode, 
  that 's weird , i 'm not getting it at all . 
  regarding the wiki , i think we 'd need to check with the mods ( / u/nilnz ? ), 
  about what they 'd like in it , but i think from my view the basic stuff we should have is :, 
  * current sidebar info ( travel advice , faq , local advice etc ), 
  * nz-related subreddits table, 
  * maybe some content stuff ( archives of / r/nz recommends , nz music month and so on ), 
  * easy to understand first-stop travel stuff ( suggestions to search by ` travel ' flair ), 
  * explanation of rules ? 
  * archive of the best of / r/nz ( maybe an faq of the subreddit itself so we do n't get `` what 's a pvtfish '' every month ), 
  should we add ` do n't be a dick ' to the rules so that there 's a reason there for the ban if they come whining about it ? 
  why am i expecting it ? 
  last exam today , plus i find out the results of history 2 . 
  that was my first thought too , pretty sure you could photoshop a flagpole in and it would n't look out of place, 
  that 's why it was in the sub / r/accidentalrenaissance , which is full of that sort of thing, 
  was there another landing in the late 90 's ? 
  i seem to remember getting a tour around one as a kid in wellington , though i 'm not sure it was a 747, 
  i did n't :(, 
  bunch of different reasons between them . 
  parihaka is one of the most famous maori pa sites , and was a [ primary example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parihaka ) of the disputes between maori and pakeha , while kaiapoi was the site of a [ major battle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaiapoi#conflict_with_te_rauparaha ) during the musket wars , which constituted a three month siege by the forces of te rauparaha ( the leader of the civ ) . 
  ngai tahu are the main iwi of the south island and one of the most powerful , even today they are the largest landowner in canterbury outside of farms and are essentially a successful corporation now . 
  similar story with tainui and ngati whatua , both very powerful iwi with large negotiations ongoing with the crown . 
  [ the t\u016bhoe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ng%c4%81i_t%c5%abhoe ) have a very strained relationship with the crown , and since they never signed the treaty of waitangi view the position of the new zealand government in the uruweras ( their homeland ) as an illegal occupation . 
  ngati puhi are home to waitangi , which saw the signing of the treaty of waitangi and thus the birth of nz as a nation . 
  there are continued ceremonies and disputes there on an annual basis on waitangi day ( february 6 ) when prominent politicians make the trip to te tii marae for celebrations . 
  beyond that , it 's much the same reason for the east coast one - they 're both very strong maori areas currently , and the iwi plays a significant role in society in the regions . 
  as for rangitane , they 're the iwi which were led by te rauparaha , and were militarily one of the strongest in the country . 
  te rauparaha himself was known as the napoleon of the south seas , and led several successful campaigns across new zealand as well as playing the relations between pakeha and maori off to his own advantage . 
  he eventually got captured and wrote ka mate , the haka performed by the all blacks, 
  but yeah , i suppose they 're not necessarily the ones significant as of 1750 , but they 're definitely the significant ones in the post-european arrival period, 
  if the us declared war , absolutely , but we 're talking about mexico attacking america . 
  i reckon you 'd have the rebels side with the states and the mexican government become increasingly alienated as even its staunchest supporters try to figure out why they 'd want to take even more on while they 're trying to deal with the civil war as-is, 
  he 's just good at hiding it, 
  got results back , a - on history 1 and a + on history 2 :d, 
  kiwi here - we 're a bit of a complicated case . 
  depending on who you ask , we either became independent in [ 1835 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/declaration_of_the_independence_of_new_zealand ) , [ 1840 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_waitangi ) , [ 1907 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dominion_of_new_zealand#dominion ) , or [ 1947 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statute_of_westminster_adoption_act_1947 ) . 
  regardless , at least until ww2 there was a very strong pro-britain sentiment . 
  we were seen as more british than britain , and that it was our duty to be the breadbasket of the empire and support it in times of need . 
  nz was one of the first countries to join both world wars alongside britain , and sent troops to the boer war and other colonial conflicts . 
  gallipoli helped create a kiwi identity close to that of australia , and the fall of singapore made people severely question the empire . 
  it was n't really until the suez crisis that we went our own way from britain , since we essentially had to decide between our old ally or our new one . 
  even if we were independent , i doubt we 'd be significant enough for a permanent seat . 
  though it 'd be nice , and i reckon we could do a bang-up job as a mediator .
