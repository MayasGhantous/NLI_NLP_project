  why do n't you just unsubscribe to them instead of blocking them ? 
  did n't one of the producer people or a close friend of the band say this is the most exciting album from them since * achtung baby * ? 
  yeah , they are, 
  hopefully sometime this month, 
  it does n't get rid of india , but replaces both their uniques . 
  so the only link between vanilla india and our one is gandhi and the civ icon, 
  in all honesty , we 're not . 
  our prime minister suggested it at the same time that his opposition was announcing election year platforms . 
  everyone gets all riled up about the flag debate , the media picks it up and runs with it , and we all ignore the opposition . 
  classic diversion, 
  the two main concerns are the union jack and that it does n't represent maori at all . 
  there 's also the identity crisis with australia and the excessive use of red/white/blue as colours, 
  as for the diversion - absolutely . 
  the media here is terrible , and has the attention span of [ dug , from * up * ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssuxxzn26zg ), 
  nor were they holy or an empire, 
  could someone upload those to imgur ? 
  i ca n't view them, 
  awesome , cheers, 
  originally posted by / u/somesortofidiot about their photo :, 
   to clarify , this is training that soldiers go through to ensure they know how to deal with molotov cocktails while conducting riot control operations . 
  this is n't actually a riot . 
  you can see the rest of the album here :, 
   http://www.dvidshub.net/image/1157169/kosovo-force-mission-rehearsal-exercise-18#.uvelpn-9ksm, 
  this * is * the original ... 
  ah , i thought you meant the one in / r/itookapicture - my mistake, 
  the mix from the superbowl ad sounded a lot more like what i take as `` classic u2 '' to me - the electronic stuff was more in the background , leaving an almost all that you ca n't leave behind kind of vibe to it, 
  oh , your claws ? 
  please . 
  we 'll [ here 's ] ( http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3741/12206681854_9ec760d3b1_o.jpg ) a flickr link that 's 5,514 \u00d7 3,676 , so i 'm not sure if you mind it being cropped or what but that should be big enough, 
  that was what i kept in my mind the first time i successfully asked someone out , it 's great to counteract the `` what-if 's '' that play through your mind when doing something like this . 
  awesome , congrats !, 
  this made me very happy reading it , i hope it all works out for you two !, 
  i swear it just came back on from a break , what the hell, 
  slade could make oliver choose between laurel and felicity to make him pay for what happened to shado on the island, 
  i think it 'd get repetitive if oliver had to choose between her and someone again, 
  i do n't like that , but [ what am i to do ? 
  they use a # or , 
  oh awesome , thanks for that, 
  [ this guy ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/183/766/bush-shoe-throw-03.gif?1318162319 ), 
  can confirm, 
  wait until you hear the [ supporter song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2-d7ybvzse ) for the soccer team, 
  what i find funny with that is that he says they think of him as a commie who is doing the exact opposite of what a commie would do, 
  this quote on a picture of tank man would be awesome, 
   ~ ~ probably ~ ~ definitely in wellington, 
  ftfy, 
  the point of this is n't what the map is representing , but rather the borders . 
  let 's just say that at some point in the future , this is what the map of the world looks like . 
  how did it get like this ? 
  you missed out on an opportunity with rotterdamsterdam, 
  damn , you said thanks to everyone who clarified it , you 're a good guy . 
  have some upvotes, 
  not bad , but then how would the pacific islands join ? 
  do they join in the war vs indonesia , or do they join at a later date as a response to climate change / foreign civil wars / diplomatic pressure ? 
  * navigation - with both the privateer and the frigate , it allows you to straight away build a massive world conquering navy, 
  * education allows you to massively boost your science output and catapult yourself towards the later techs, 
  * industrialisation to get ideology and ( usually ) rush towards the volunteer army tenet, 
  * replaceable parts for the gw infantry, 
  new zealand . 
  shit goes down when people show up, 
  i 'd like to learn how to flip a house please ... 
  does it need to be a full house , and is everything tied down before i do ? 
  oh come on , like * that 's * going to have any effect, 
  dude , come on, 
  landlocked , but not without a naval border . 
  lake titicaca, 
  i actually thought it was in australia for a bit - close enough for a boat trip to the south china seas to be reasonable , and when walter goes off to do business back in season 1 to get some space i 'm pretty sure he said he was heading off to melbourne, 
  it 's even better when you get him from a city state . 
  i was at war with mongolia , then got gifted genghis khan . 
  seems there are n't limitations on when you can get a ugp , unlike uu from city states when they ca n't be ingame . 
  so genghis lead a war against himself, 
  if 100 people have jumped out of a 50 story tall building there 's probably a fairly good reason to jump, 
  the ottoman empire is what 's next, 
  it 's because 45 gold is equal to 1.5 gpt , so the ai will go for one or two . 
  but if you sell 5 at 1.5 each it only goes to 7.5 gpt , which can 7 or 8 instead of the 10 from selling separately, 
  i love the sky when it 's like that, 
  and air new zealand operate quite a few of the smaller planes , which would probably explain it . 
  but that does n't stop them having two policies . 
  actually , i do n't know if the caa ( our version of the faa ) allows electronics yet , so it could even be illegal for air nz to allow them, 
  no , they think it 's from the cook islands . 
  which is where it is , and where it 's from, 
  it 's the 13th over here in new zealand, 
  so which of these units * are * accurate ? 
  i think it would be cool having island based factions - cyprus , syracuse , knossos and rhodes - since they love having the dlc factions in packs, 
  have there been any myths you or adam have wanted to test but you 've been told ` no ' by the producers for whatever reason ? 
  what and why ? 
  the myth that he blew something up went boom . 
  but then the myth is true ? 
  it 's a paradox, 
  whoops , fixed . 
  thanks, 
  yep - it 's how we declared war before the uk in ww2, 
   odd future has been deemed to be a potential threat to public order and the public interest, 
  this whole thing reeks of fascism, 
  sorry , it 's the largest version i could find but i still thought it looked cool so decided to post it here, 
  i think the percentage is of total battles across the two games - like , `` 65 % of all battles have been won in rome 2 '' . 
  coh2 has single player battles in skirmishes and the campaign as well , that 's usually what i do, 
  from the terms and conditions :, 
   only player resolved battles in campaign mode will register a victory ( ie . 
  no auto-resolve victories will be recorded as a battle victory ) . 
  thanks to / u/reddorf,
