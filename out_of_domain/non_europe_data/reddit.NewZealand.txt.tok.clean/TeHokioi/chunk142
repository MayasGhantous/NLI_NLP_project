  as far as the first part goes , it 's a sort of half truth . 
  the adoption of gunpowder did have a significant impact on the ottomans - the use of enormous cannons allowed for mehmed ii ( later known as mehmed the conqueror ) to finally conquer the city of constantinople ( now istanbul ) , something which muslim armies had been trying to do for nearly as long as islam was a religion . 
  the use of gunpowder weapons also gave the ottomans a decisive victory over the egypt-based ~ ~ ayyubids ~ ~ mamluks ( edit : mamluks , not ayyubids - thanks for the correction / u/philippaeilhart , ) and as a result of this the ottoman empire nearly doubled in size within the space of a couple years . 
  however , by the time that gunpowder was adopted by the ottomans they were already fairly powerful . 
  they 'd taken advantage of a divided anatolian heartland and a byzantine focus on the west to develop from a small emirate into a regional power , and successfully exploited both divisions within the byzantine empire and rivalries between european powers to later conquer most of the former byzantine holdings . 
  this is actually where the adoption of gunpowder came from , as it is believed to have filtered into the ottoman empire through their conquest of the balkans , as western europe adopted gunpowder weaponry before the ottomans . 
  so i suppose you could say that the success of the ottomans was due to its use of gunpowder , but it was already fairly well-off before gunpowder showed up and there were a lot more factors than just that, 
  it 'd be interesting to trial a thing where posts with the political tag have a custom css which hides the downvote button , but then that opens it up to troll abuse and there are still ways around it, 
  it 's definitely possible to do it on a subreddit-wide basis , do n't know about individual threads, 
  sounds just like a normal kiwi summer anyway, 
  i dunno , depending on how well connected the local market is they might be able to import the australian varieties . 
  just need to make sure a trained chef removes the venom , or it 's a one way ticket to the morgue, 
  chicken chips and marmite sandwiches were my childhood, 
  i thought people wanted it for the self post ? 
  but i 'd be more than happy to have the kiwi snoo back , maybe give it a bit of a facelift ? 
  ( or we just ask / u/paulfknwalsh really nicely if he 'd be able to whip something up , though i suppose digital painting would be a whole other kettle of fish ), 
  yeah it 's back , but a certain rooster has stolen it too . 
  whoops , this is what happens when i use res . 
  will try and figure something out soon, 
  huh , that 's weird . 
  do you use res ? 
  i 've got res and instead of the three bars i 've got `` my subreddits '' which works fine , but i tried on my phone and the three bars did n't work for me either , so i dunno, 
  oh , so you want it as a selectable flair ? 
  i thought you did n't , which is why i got rid of it . 
  can add it back if you want, 
  what sort of music are you wanting ? 
  both rock and pop are fairly broad, 
  it was already added , it just was n't selectable for normal users . 
  you needed to add it to a user manually through the flair menu . 
  just do n't go fucking around with the flair spritesheet now unless you 've got something which can handle transparency , i 've got rid of all the white backgrounds once and i 'm not doing it again, 
  dammit , i did n't realise i had an old version of the page and was all excited because i got to do it for once . 
  ah well, 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-8ugdukcos ) is kind of cool , someone on here recommended this band once and i love their stuff . 
  kind of a retro vibe to it , which i like . 
  there 's also [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otz1sfwbe64 ) , but i do n't know if it counts since the video is like twice as long as the song . 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stxlk-o2q8e ) is pretty decent too . 
  there 's a bunch of black keys and u2 i could recommend as well but you 'd probably be aware of their stuff already ( and hate me for recommending u2 ), 
  careful , you might cause it [ to explode ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4ro1lqbnqi ), 
  of course we are . 
  just wait until / u/appexxd gets his springbok flair, 
   bbq on bitches . 
  i tend to get better results by using it on a deck, 
  no politics :d, 
  hell yeah , much better than going through and manually giving posts flairs . 
  you lot need to up your game when submitting stuff, 
  what about queen ? 
  santana ? 
  [ not bad , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6whgn_ie5uc ) they 're normally mostly the song being performed [ in a bar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcbs5etszyi ) or [ on a street ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hklnmmaceb4 ) or something but they almost always have [ cool cars ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nplv7lgbmt4 ) , [ good looking women ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlyuu-kdvhu ) and an [ awesome latin vibe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6omuxqhg78 ) . 
  there was also [ this kinda cool lyric video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lisfaaojunw ) if you do n't mind that sort of thing , and whatever the fuck [ this video is ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz2r-cj12zy ), 
  one of the times http://worldmapswithout.nz could be a good thing, 
  might 've done accidentally , i 'll do some work on the sidebar when i get a chance and add back in stuff like the podcast and that and so on . 
  meantime you can get to it by clicking on the wiki page at the top, 
  i am now :d, 
  since yesterday when they made me one to implement the new css, 
  i was thinking the same thing , though i 'd be worried there would be overlap between some, 
  what 's wrong with me being a mod :(, 
  what was my tag ? 
  not without destroying the look entirely, 
  i 'd say an x is n't as bad as other letters , simply because it 's a symbol outside of its symbolism as a letter as well . 
  how ? 
  even with winnie they 'd only have 60 seats to national 's 61 , would n't they ? 
  i dunno , i think winnie would go against john before he goes with national, 
  save up a bunch then take a year off to travel ? 
  nah i just bail at the last minute anyway . 
  might be able to make it to this one , though i 've been fucking busy at work and working like 50-60 hour weeks so i might either be there or trying to catch up on sleep, 
  just fyi , tags do n't work in self posts , and do n't seem to work if you tag heaps of people at once . 
  also , might want to specify which joe 's garage . 
  i went to the bush inn one for dinner with mates tonight only to find it was actually the cranford st one and i was late , so yeah, 
  baikonur is about the same latitude as dunedin , and it handles the entire russian space program, 
  i do n't think so ? 
  yo / u/zeros1s , did you check out those music videos yet ? 
  i have a feeling this will be one of their best concerts of the tour , if not the best . 
  so pleased it 's being recorded, 
   taking from the majority and giving to the few, 
  you mean like what happened a couple centuries back when europeans first showed up ? 
  1 day `` see if / u/asatj is losing his teeth '', 
  it 'll have to be a group effort , the wiki is too big for just me to cover, 
  do it, 
  i 'm still at work , will do it when i get home tonight or early tomorrow, 
  we were always at war with eastasia, 
  shit , how much would i need to pay for one of them ? 
  i 've got the [ republic of new zealand ] ( https://wiseblooddotnet1.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/republic_of_new_zealand-lay.jpg ) one already , but that one 's pretty mint too, 
  maybe check that story of the cat who would bring home wads of cash and drugs ? 
  found michael laws ' reddit account, 
  i 'd say it varies from state to state ( domestic ) and state to state ( international ) - here in nz all judges are justices , but from the sound of it not all judges in the us are justices . 
  wait until you see the flag of [ pocatello , idaho ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ad/flag_pocatello_idaho.jpg ), 
   `` the user interface is now resplendent in a style inspired by the art of the middle ages . 
  influences ranging from illuminated manuscripts and early stained glass work will lend colour and atmosphere to your campaign . '', 
  it 's funny , i was talking about this yesterday . 
  having unit models as the icons was something i did n't like about attila , i 'm pleased they changed back to art for the icons . 
  just wish they 'd port it to the main game . 
  yeah , but we ca n't discuss world events elsewhere on the subreddit because it 's not relevant to nz . 
  i 'd prefer to just have a blanket ban on nz related politics , and then judge everything else on a case-by-case basis . 
  i mean , should n't be able to constantly go `` dae republicans are evil ? '', 
  but something like discussing a current event should be fine imo, 
  yeah , but i 'm meaning more just discussing them in general , not the relationship to nz . 
  friday foreign affairs ? 
  i 'd say a weekly thing , too often and it 'll get stale . 
   be nice . 
  sod off , i 've been working fucking 12 hour days .
