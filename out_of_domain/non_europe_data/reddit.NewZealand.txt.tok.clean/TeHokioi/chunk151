  additionally , the winners of / u / - chocko - 's sponsored categories , with gold provided by him instead of through the sitewide gold :,

  ** politics opinion mvp : ** / u/heinigernz, 
  i was going to donate mine to / u/mamba _ 79 for contributions to photography , since i was running unopposed and my comment was n't * really * that helpful ( i mean , does anyone really need convincing that a nationwide earthquake is impossible ? ), 
  but mamba has had constant gold for nearly three years , so i 'm open to suggestions . 
  plus both / u/nilnz and / u/ballchynz earnt theirs , and i was running unopposed . 
  dammit / u/appexxd _, 
  yeah , i ca n't give my gold away anyway . 
  i was going to buy gold for someone , then saw you had gold for africa and decided someone else would be more deserving, 
  why 'd you leave us :(, 
  maybe ` in-need ' would 've been a better word ? 
  sitting in a tree would be a pretty dece spot for something like this, 
  what 's the most upvoted comment overall that 's not by a mod ? 
  are they a regular here ? 
  most of their comments are outside / r/nz and i do n't recognise the name ... 
  based on your data , who do you think would be most deserving of gold that has n't got it in the bestofs and is n't a mod ? 
  one of my favourite things about this film is how they wrote a script , then did n't show it to any of the other actors, 
  i know , and i was talking about in one, 
   did n't say they could courier the item . 
  next time i 'll ask them . 
  we can do that , it just sometimes costs a bit extra for delivery . 
  i know whiteware and stuff is like $ 80 , but that 's using our guys instead of a courier company , and it 's a tad different from something you 'd get on flybuys . 
  you can also get it sent to another store if you have one that 's closer . 
  some stores tend to hide it which is a bit stink , but generally it 's something we can do if the customer asks for it . 
  ~ ~ from the sound of it the store actively tried to imply that we could n't , which does sound a bit off too . 
  any chance you could say which ? ~ ~, 
  edit : just read it was customer service , whoops . 
  i do n't know why they did n't offer you the option , internet sales get couriered out all the time . 
  might be a bit different with flybuys though since we need to check id and all that , but i do n't see why it would n't work . 
  yeah , realised after i submitted that i 'd misread his comment . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure . 
  from the sound of it , as far as they 're concerned you 've already bought the go pro , it 's just waiting for payment to be finished . 
  in that case , it 'd depend on whether you bought the extended warranty alongside it , which has some sort of weird price match after purchase thing on it . 
  beyond that , it could very well come down to whether you 've caught them on a good day or not , they should be able to credit the gopro and then redo the sale at the cheaper price , but it 's one of those cases where it entirely comes down to them . 
  as long as you get the same one , otherwise that goddamn orange return sticker makes it nigh-on unsellable . 
  jesus man , how are you affording this ? 
  did you win big on lotto or something ? 
  i mean , i work a fair bit too , but bloody hell . 
  did you want a hand ? 
  4 - forge their signature ? 
  ^ ^ * note : ^ ^ doing ^ ^ this ^ ^ may ^ ^ be ^ ^ highly ^ ^ illegal ^ ^ and ^ ^ punishable ^ ^ with ^ ^ criminal ^ ^ convictions . 
  could you get them to sign it somehow ? 
  do they read what they 're signing or just do it ? 
  \\ # 1 does n't sound like a problem , since you 've done the paperwork anyway . 
  not sure whether you 'll have a way out of # 2 though , if you 're not able to get independent circumstances then having them sign it might be the only way you 're able to get it done . 
  why do you need them to sign it , anyway ? 
  you 're 19 , right ? 
  i thought 18 was the age you did n't need parental approval from ? 
  oh , right - i 'm in the same boat , parents make too much for me to get student allowance but do n't pay any of the costs . 
  you can still get living costs through the loan up to a certain point , but it 's on your loan so yeah . 
  better than going back home though , plus it 's interest free, 
  better than being stuck at home with an abusive family, 
  i swear , if i was n't a mod ... 
  i ca n't really go and jump full-steam into the arguments , no matter how much i want to, 
  ehh , maybe, 
  jesus , good job . 
  i was the same with studying ( ie . 
  looking at notes maybe once between games ) and managed to do decent throughout ncea . 
  slipped up a bit at l2 , but put a bit more effort in and got back to excellence endorsement at l3 . 
  what are you planning to take ? 
  definitely sounds better than the current version of hitting refresh , with a side version of heart attacks and hoping the server does n't crash . 
  they 're credits - each assessment is worth a certain number of them , with more work = more credit . 
  you need 80 credits to pass, 
  uc does the same thing based on l2 and l3 endorsements too, 
  wait , why is the subtitle talking about the application to remove it being refused , yet everything else is talking about it being felled ? 
  which is roughly 7,500 km away from us - if they get to a point they 're quarreling with us then there 's going to be bigger problems, 
  i suppose an invasion from indonesia is pretty much the only feasible one if you 're australia . 
  does n't really need to be indonesia on the other side , but it 's the only way they 're going to be invaded from . 
  same thing would 've been the route for a japanese invasion in ww2 , so the same tactics would apply, 
  an indonesian invasion of new zealand would be one of the biggest military operations for quite some time , not to mention a developed western nation being invaded ( by an islamic country no less ) would be met with huge international condemnation and response . 
  it 'd be political suicide for the country . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , both are fine . 
  the jason gunn one is entirely factual ( he 's broken his back , and his thingee is unharmed ) and this one is n't really a news article ( despite being published on stuff ), 
  supremacy is kickass , it 's got that whole bond vibe going on, 
  drones is a great album . 
  i never would have imagined a western about nuclear warfare , yet the globalist pulls it off perfectly, 
  should 've come into work tomorrow , could 've got a good deal from our mutual friend, 
  depends on your definition of ergonomically comfortable , but we 'd probably have the same mouse you bought and she would 've been able to discount it fairly well . 
  [ in three colours ] ( http://products.noelleeming.co.nz/search?w=logitech+m185&amp;view=list ) , and that 's base price . 
  i was meaning in terms of how it 'd be portrayed . 
  they 're the largest majority muslim population in the world , and i 'm sure as hell if they invaded us the right wing in the states would be saying how the * ` mooslims ' * are waging war on the west, 
  well there 's your problem, 
  shit , that 's pretty good . 
  i 've got about three recently that have been suggested , i 'll have a play round with them and see how it looks . 
  because nobody over that side would spend money on a book ? 
  i 'll be honest , i just use bookstores for that, 
  nah , i try and avoid that even on ones i 've bought . 
  what if it 's owl ? 
  sounds like the perfect cover for making all those creases, 
  i 'll be honest , i was expecting a sheep joke with the second image, 
  i thought the third one could come from more than one ? 
  or maybe i 'm misremembering , it was a couple years ago and i have n't given nzqa a single thought since, 
  it 's totally going on the header, 
  whatever happened to / u / _ i_am_batman _ ? 
  i barely see him round here anymore . 
  you 're alive !, 
  no excuse for the pm thread though, 
  too soon to say that he shot his career in the foot ? 
  it 's an expression in english too ... 
   unknown,
