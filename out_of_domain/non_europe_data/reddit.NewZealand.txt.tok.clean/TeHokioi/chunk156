  according to my plays on itunes it 's [ the wanderer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-dzvqxyx1g ) , and lyrically it 's probably [ acrobat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nha1ths9ava ) - though the guitar solo and the drums in this are awesome too - but overall as my favourite song i do n't think anything can top [ where the streets have no name ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzwsrr5wfi ) . 
  non-u2 , it 'd probably be a tossup between [ yellow ledbetter ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs8y3kneqrs ) , [ life in technicolour ii ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxsovfzyx28 ) , and [ rock 'n' roller ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvrkwkvcznc ), 
  linking to my other musical comment , [ yellow ledbetter ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs8y3kneqrs ), 
  / r/forwardsfromgrandma is, 
  why do n't we just put a big fucking sign on the car saying it 's a tourist one ... oh wait . 
  this is pretty much inviting the cars to be broken into, 
  it was the same with the civ franchise , every time a dlc or expansion did n't have poland there were threats of storming the firaxis offices and claiming them for poland, 
  yeah , pretty sure the tap water is literally straight out of the ground . 
  fuck i 'll do it , just need to think of some themes and figure out how spotify works, 
  yeah , there 's a fair few people who do . 
  i think it goes in waves , they were huge after the joshua tree then dropped down a bit with rattle and hum . 
  achtung baby brought them back but they fucked it up with pop , then recovered with atyclb and their superbowl performance - if nothing else , you should check out a video of that one , it 's amazing, 
  eh , plenty of musicians are dicks - does n't mean they ca n't make good music, 
  water taxi ? 
  should get a new account butility not get rid of the old one, 
  what the hell , this fucking phone i swear . 
  it 's not even a bloody word, 
  eh , i still owe him like three for not coming to the meetups, 
  yeah , ca n't make it on friday . 
  like i said , mum 's taking off on that day at the same time, 
   i mean just cos my boyfriend lives a block away and he slept with another girl, 
  sounds like it worked out decent enough in the end , though i 'd still keep an eye on him . 
  was n't going to do these ones , was either going to go with tune tuesday / thursday or music monday or whatever . 
  can put these in a playlist if you want , i suppose . 
  when the levee breaks is pretty awesome too, 
  i 'm 19 , and i know what that is . 
  and now i feel like a shitty youtube comment, 
  i think you 've just written a parody song for a viagra ad, 
  pretty sure we 've still got a few at work if you wanted flybuys too, 
  or , you know , do n't accidentally spoon in the first place ? 
  i 'd say being absolutely clear about everything is the best course of action , things get messy when they 're ambiguous, 
  just make sure we 're not gon na have to drill some sense into owl, 
  dissent ? 
  what dissent ? 
  ^ ^ ^ off ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ gulag ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ you, 
  wait , offended that you thought he had a thing for you ? 
  not sure how i 'd take that, 
  yeah , though i suppose when you make so much music with so much variety you 'll get like that . 
  which of it are you a fan of ? 
  i dunno , getting an objective opinion seems like a fairly good move . 
  though your subterfuge needs a bit of work still, 
  bloody hell , you 're not having a good day with this phrasing stuff, 
  right , started up tune ~ ~ tuesday ~ ~ thursday again . 
  might not be able to update the spotify thing frequently , but i 'll give it a shot . 
  this week 's theme is ** political songs ** - protest songs , bono wailing about another terrorist attack in ireland , whatever . 
  feel free to give a bit of background on what the song is about , but do n't go too much into the politics side and for the love of god please do n't start arguing about it . 
  spotify playlist here : https://play.spotify.com/user/pouakai/playlist/2zzy7mbq8bsybmaro4jygs ( will also be doing a new playlist every week so you can go back and listen to the earlier ones ), 
  shit , i forgot about all the music from vietnam - added that and a couple of my favourites from then, 
  who are you and what have you done with ballchy ? 
  the real balchy would never know shakespeare, 
  added it, 
  added - did n't realise there were any songs about the falkland war, 
  eh , close enough . 
  added it, 
  might need a bit more specifics , ca n't exactly add their whole discography, 
  wait , that 's a political song ? 
  added the three that were on spotify, 
  the john key one and maggie you cunt, 
  i like hans better , makes him sound european, 
  oh right , that makes sense, 
  i 've never been sure , is it argentinian or argentine ? 
  ** baby ? 
  next season 's costume is just him shirtless but with sleeves, 
  we 'd die if we did that, 
  looks like argentinian is the denonym , but argentine is the adjective . 
  not sure which would apply here though, 
  that lineup surely has to be bogus - a fair few of those bands would be headliners of their own right , and to have all of them at the same thing would be insane . 
  the scene in daredevil with this was one of the best ones i 've ever seen on television . 
  music fit perfectly , and there was no sound other than it for the entirety of the song . 
  as well as nessun dorma i 'm a fan of [ o sole mio ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erd4cbbdni0 ) - it 's a lot more light-hearted than most of them , and they genuinely seem to be enjoying themselves, 
  ( spoilers ) it does n't have the same punch on its own though . 
  the buildup with everything leading up to it makes it amazingly cathartic and a fantastic end to the season, 
  the entire series builds up frustration and tension , which is all released in that single scene . 
  it 's glorious, 
  it really depends on what part of south-east africa you 're referring to . 
  the interior of the area ( zimbabwe sort of area ) was home to a succession of fairly substantial kingdoms / empires , the most well-known of which is the kingdom of zimbabwe . 
  these empires grew rich off resource trade to the coast , particularly gold , and built [ fairly substantial cities ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/great-zimbabwe-2.jpg ) . 
  as well as zimbabwe itself , there was the kingdom of mapungubwe before it , and mutapa and the rozwi after it ( who were the empires in the region when portugal arrived . ), 
  most of the trade these empires carried out was with the swahili city states , which were mainly around sort of tanzania through somalia but did extend into northern mozambique and madagascar . 
  these were established primarily by arab traders , but as indian ocean trade increased it became much more of its own thing instead of remaining linked with the arab states . 
  on the whole , these were mainly just city states instead of an empire which controlled the whole coast , but they did have a fair bit of influence in the region . 
  the swahili states were a popular source of origin for early european explorers in the continent , as the frequent expeditions into the interior by these states to capture slaves allowed a much easier path in than say the nile or congo rivers . 
  there were a fair few other kingdoms in the area - madagascar was largely under the control of the merina , while the zambezi floodplains were home to the lozi . 
  southern africa was home to a whole host of different tribal groups , though again these did n't necessarily operate in isolation . 
  there 's quite a bit of history in the area , but much of it is still not that well known for various reasons . 
  sorry this is n't quite as detailed as i 'd imagine you 'd have liked , i ran out of time . 
  let me know if you want me to give some sources and i can put them up later on when i get home, 
  to be fair , in japanese they 're spelt exactly the same . 
   outgoing prime minister, 
  lol , i wish . 
  for some reason , even with all the hate he gets , he still seems to be extremely popular . 
  one person , back at the end of high school . 
  at the time i would 've said absolutely they deserved it given the months beforehand , but i dunno . 
  the whole thing was a fucking mess and i 'm sure i was just as much of a dick . 
  did n't really work anyway , we 've still been kind of talking for about the past year now . 
  on a kind of unrelated note , i still think of ghosting as the act of going up as close behind someone as you can without them noticing you , then following them at that distance, 
  should get one of those fm transmitter things that plug into your cigarette lighter , if your car does n't have an aux port . 
  it 'd make the drive a lot more bearable, 
  meetup is tonight anyway , so that 's what i 'm guessing she 's doing, 
  i remember we had one when i was a kid .
