  have you bought the textbook already ? 
  shit , i 've got a fair few from work that are keen but friday is one of our late nights . 
  i 'm not working it , but will see if they are . 
  oh wait , you said leaving 10pm . 
  we close at 9 so that 'd be fine anyway . 
  any particular reason for making it that late , especially when it 's so far to drive ( compared to the first trip ? ), 
  they 're coming , i swear, 
  hah , weekends are my full days - 10-6 both days . 
  still should be fine , i could always ~ ~ call in sick ~ ~ take leave if need be . 
  fridays are my day off , so i might just try to get a bit of shut-eye during the day . 
  oh nah , i was meaning more compared to the last one . 
  would be cool driving out there while there 's still some light in the sky , but the work thing makes sense . 
  the earlier starts will be nice though , and i 'll just wrap up warm michelin man style . 
  paging / u/tubbylardman , since you sounded keen the other day, 
  i 'm able to make it this time , so you 'd actually be able to say g ` day and i wo n't have to owe you a pint at it . 
  win-win !, 
  you coming this time ? 
  just ~ ~ call in sick ~ ~ live off energy drinks - sleep is for the weak, 
  he 's looking pretty good for 400 or so though, 
  could n't take saturday off ? 
  might bring along some bubble wrap , apparently it 's a good insulator, 
  yeah , but dunno if i 'll have room yet . 
  bunch of people from work sound keen, 
  oh nah we just meet up at bush inn and carpool , there were about 16-17 of us last time but we went in just 4 cars . 
  also , / u/mamba _ 79 , might pay to make sure the bush inn car park is still open in the wee hours , i know the westfields one closes at about midnight, 
  just do n't leave it in the goddamn car and we 'll be fine, 
  got ta say , i was expecting a ufo or something, 
  though in true chch style it 'll need to be stuck in development hell for four years or so, 
  i suppose there may very well have been , but the vendor chose to accept the nz offer instead . 
  they 're under no obligation to accept a higher offer , are they ? 
  i disagree about unknown caller . 
  sure , it could use a few different lyrics here and there , but on the whole it 's a great match for the feel of the album as a whole . 
  the intro of it is second in my book only to the intro of streets, 
  i had the opposite effect . 
  listened to it at first and hated pretty much the whole thing ( except magnificent and breathe . ), 
  gave it a listen again a couple years later and absolutely loved it, 
  i 'm hoping the trilogy theory is right and we hear more of it with songs of ascent after soe, 
  soon as it goes unconditional it 'll be gazetted and added to abel tasman national park, 
  yeah , i 'll try and sort it out . 
  it 'd be easier if / u/kiwisi had a transparent background version of it though, 
  that 'll work , i 'll add it in when i get a chance, 
  by that logic it 's caitlin and patty , too, 
  pleased we got that fancy new css, 
  she likes being a minor local celebrity , i think . 
  at least that 's what i got from the flair, 
  you could give [ these ones ] ( https://www.noelleeming.co.nz/shop/computers/wearables/headphones/plantronics-backbeat-fit-headset-green/prod131769.html ) a shot if you wanted a cheaper pair - still fairly expensive , but i only ever hear good things about them, 
  it also screws up the formatting a lot more, 
  oh , i just assumed it was the booze, 
  jesus , better than the gardens, 
  oh shit it 's thursday , guess i 'd better do another tune thursday . 
  i 've got fuck all idea for a theme , so how about just an introduction to a band / artist you think should be more popular ? 
  spotify link [ here ] ( https://play.spotify.com/user/pouakai/playlist/01oulcuskhgjw4ebwcvlk2 ) , and feel free to suggest themes to do as well . 
  guess i 'll start out with kaleo - their debut album is n't on spotify , but a couple of their singles ( which are n't on the album ) are . 
  main one is probably [ way down we go ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wiu5nn1q0g ) ( seen here performed inside a volcano , because what else are you going to do in iceland ) and then [ no good ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpvziavalie ) , as heard in the trailer for hbo 's new series vinyl ( which has bloody good music on it . ), 
  it 's a shame their album is n't on spotify , because that 's got some pretty awesome stuff on it , and ranges from blues rock to a more sort of indie folk thing . 
  couple of my favourites are [ rock 'n' roller ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvrkwkvcznc ) , [ broken bones ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9ie0glgrcm ) , and [ i walk on water ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro_kzrhvfl0 ) , which convinently also give a bit of a hint at the differences in musical style across the album . 
  so do i , and i 'm a driver . 
  shit , this is n't bad . 
  added them, 
  do n't think you quite understood the ` should be more famous ' bit , but added anyway, 
  couple of those were too unknown for spotify - windfall , leech 2 , and golden boy - but added all of the other ones since they were there, 
  removed , rule 12, 
  my first thought was that sally draper was jamie , before we knew her name . 
  shit , when i ca n't sleep i just go watch 24 hour news and it puts me out like a light . 
  never thought of doing something more productive, 
  wait , what 's going on in the uae ? 
  i get some of it 's neighbours are fairly unstable , but i thought oman and the uae were pretty stable themselves, 
  because it 's 9 in the morning ? 
  jesus , and here i was thinking 1.73 for 91 was cheap . 
   key has promised to help sri lanka out with another coach if hansen was n't interested . 
  maybe a new job for national 's mr. fix-it , steven joyce ? 
  but surely you 'd waste more than you save by heading out that way ? 
  ah , that makes sense then . 
  not as much when you 're in town permanently, 
  jesus , that 'd be worth the trip i reckon, 
  cretaceous, 
  i 've never heard this used before ever , is n't it normally just pakeha ? 
  problem is it uses the all blacks fern , so you 'd get a huge anti-rugby bandwagon going on it, 
  i swear that fern is the logo of a transit company or government department or something, 
  and we did , then the flag committee went and fucked it all up, 
  so is the alternate we 've already got, 
  does n't mean it 's a better flag , just that it 's more popular, 
  the change came around the same time as the breach too , i think you 're onto something here, 
  not necessarily , there are principles of flag design which a good flag should adhere to - if you have n't seen it , i suggest you check out [ this ted talk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnv5ikb2hl4 ) on the subject . 
  from a purely vexillological perspective , red peak is a better flag than the lockwood one . 
  but so is the one in the op , and that 's a pretty average flag . 
  a bunch of the other ones in the contest were better flags too , and they missed out . 
  i 'm crushing bad on one of the girls in a course i 'm taking , no idea what the hell to do, 
  hell , i was working in the mall all day and it was still too bloody hot . 
  a/c in the storeroom must have been buggered or something, 
  well yeah , but would n't it be weird if a guy you 've met maybe once comes up to you and asks you out , a week into the course ? 
  so you 'd say the flag of pocatello is fine if the populace does n't mind it ? 
  i use allan 's tyre and auto on kendall ave ( airport side of burnside park ) and have n't had any issues with them . 
  i think / u/awfulrob recommended them to me , they seemed to help him a fair bit too, 
  oh shit , okay . 
  might buy her a drink first, 
  wait , i thought the three were zoom , ` the ' jay , and the man in the iron mask ? 
  who 's the other one ? 
  the felicity one is an interesting idea , it 'd fit in with the early stuff trying to throw people off the trail , and they have a known reputation for mirages / ghosts of people . 
  whoever it is , it affects oliver deeply - if he went off the deep end like that seeing her ghost definitely would n't be out of the question .
