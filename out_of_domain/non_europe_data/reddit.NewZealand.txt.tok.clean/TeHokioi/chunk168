  removed , rule 5 . 
  see main discussion [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/4b91aq/a_200week_ubi_under_labour/ ), 
  yeah , probably . 
  been a long day, 
  just a heads up with your plan , it 'd take two days to drive from wellington to queenstown , so if you 're going to be here for only six days then it 's probably not worth it . 
  also , the scenic areas you 've mentioned are probably a day away at least . 
  the clay cliffs you could do on your way from wellington , but it 's on a fairly big unpaved road and most rental car companies wo n't let you drive on unpaved roads . 
  but let 's assume that you do wellington and queenstown anyway . 
  on your six day trip , that would give you two days in wellington , a day driving to christchurch , a day driving from christchurch to queenstown , and two days in queenstown . 
  that might work , but it 's one of the busiest periods on the roads here and one of the busiest times in queenstown as a whole ( [ this little stretch of road ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/2wukwtjyub42 ) can easily take a couple hours over new years . ), 
  it 's doable , and it 'd be a great trip , but you would probably feel rushed , would n't get a chance to explore either place properly , and in all honesty it probably would n't be safe when you combine the long drives and the new years revelry . 
  as i see it , you have two options . 
  option one is that you stay the whole time in one place . 
  given you 're a foodie i would suggest wellington , it 's got an awesome atmosphere and has some great restaurants . 
  though queenstown might be friendlier with the tourist influx and large amounts of alcohol consumption . 
  option two is that you spend longer out here . 
  i do n't know whether it 'd be practical with your circumstances , but it would allow you to check out both wellington and queenstown properly , as well as the places in between , without having to stress about the time constraints . 
  take a day to go check out milford sound , or detour through dunedin and check out moeraki boulders . 
  there are some festivals around new year too , if you like that sort of thing . 
  long and short of it is that what you 're suggesting is * possible * , but not practical . 
  you 'd be better to take a step back and figure out if you 're stuck to that time period , then what you 'd want to see more . 
  yeah , a lot of nz roads are windy , plus you 'll want to stop for photos and breaks and all that stuff . 
  even though the speed limit is 100 , in many places you 'll be doing 80 at most . 
  sticking with queenstown is a good idea , it means you have time for something like a milford sound trip or whatever ( day tours are run ex-queenstown , i 'd suggest [ real journeys ] ( https://www.realjourneys.co.nz/ ) . ), 
  there 's a bunch of places near queenstown which are well within reach without having to look to somewhere like moeraki or omarama . 
  arrowtown is nice , gibbston has a ton of wineries and there are wine tasting things that run , then there 's the pub up at cardrona ( do n't drink and drive ) - from cardrona you get [ kickass views across the area from an awesome road too . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il986p_ooee ) it 's also horse racing season , and the glenorchy races up the head of the lake tend to take place within a couple days of new years - they 're always good fun . 
  it does , but only in the big cities - launched in christchurch just this week . 
  you 'd be better renting a car , there 's [ a back road out of town ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/wfnxuxgd1cl2 ) which even during peak times has bugger all traffic on it , so you 'd be fine . 
  i do get where they 're coming from in some aspects of it , though i think it might go into the no politics side of things, 
  finally actually finished my first book in ages last night - start heaps , but then i find another one and start that instead . 
  turns out there 's a fucking massive river in the amazon which is hot enough to give you instant third degree burns for kilometres of its length, 
  it 's actually a brilliant move from a pr perspective . 
  distances himself from the failure and keeps his ` image ' intact , despite being involved in the whole thing from the get go, 
  seems like a rubbish theory , but oh well, 
  yeah , [ that 's what the book was on ] ( http://www.bookdepository.com/the-boiling-river/9781501119477 ), 
  they 're not 100 % sure , but it seems to be an underground source which shoots up to the surface at such a high flow rate that it does n't have time to cool down - given it 's about 400km from the nearest volcanic source, 
  pls . 
  could just be how they market the higher hz rate . 
  might be football mode overseas or whatever, 
  i do hope some of them are the guys that left , i miss that lot, 
  that spike by the powerup makes it hard though, 
  i reckon you 've got close enough to one in the team tiles , but the powerup bit is essentially the main entrance to the base since the other bit can be blocked off easily . 
  too difficult to get out otherwise, 
  i think they fell into a vat of rainbows and became scene kids, 
  wonder if you could score an expenses paid trip to mt john or something now that you 've got one foot in the photography door ? 
  i always seemed to get stuck in the group that never got anything done , i 'd look around and everyone else was nearly finished , then i 'd wonder how i screwed up again, 
  i 'd go to bed , i do n't mind early mornings . 
  especially in summer when it 's light out and you get that awesome bit of watching the world wake up . 
  reminder : ama with geonet is tomorrow morning at 10am . 
  play nice and do n't leave the place in a mess . 
  iirc lambton quay was the beachfront up until the 1855 earthquake , so it could 've been something to do with it being set up before that as a promenade or whatever . 
  might have also been just for grandeur around the government buildings, 
  hah , there are other departments that do stuff down there too . 
  i 'm going down in a couple weeks actually for one, 
  yeah , i used to use that but then i [ heard bad things about it ] ( http://www.pcworld.com/article/2929992/hola-browser-extension-should-be-uninstalled-researchers-say.html ) so i got rid of it . 
  do you want me to put this up in the / r/nz sidebar , or do you want to keep it more a low key / local affair ? 
  just work on spreading your name to the people there , then when you go down they 're like `` holy shit , it 's really him ! '', 
  and give you the guided tour, 
  i dunno , i 'm not in marketing . 
  maybe i 'm thinking of how to win an election ? 
  i dunno , from what i 've seen new subs like that never tend to be as popular . 
  only time i 've seen it kind of work was when one of the top mods at / r/historicalwhatif when postal and destroyed everything , so people remade it at / r/historywhatif, 
  guess there 's no ice cream for you then !, 
  awesome , just put it up . 
  gim me a yell if any of the deets change and i 'll update as necessary, 
  3 from 3 , this is insane, 
  as long as we do n't make it to the final and lose to australia again i 'll be happy, 
  hah , i was just about to come and make these posts . 
  cheers !, 
  nah , i 'm waiting for no man 's sky, 
  there was another one i saw on netflix one time , something like an 80 's aircraft carrier going back to pearl harbour . 
  not exactly as much of a time jump though, 
  one thing you 'll need to keep an eye out for with mt hutt especially is the wind . 
  often the mountain will be shut if it 's a nor-wester , and even if it 's not shut it 'd be fairly miserable . 
  not so much from wind chill , it just makes conditions way too unpredictable and dangerous . 
  it 's not editorialised, 
  if my old history teacher 's 35 year old car which broke down on the motorway and would deploy a smokescreen if it went faster than 70kph can pass , i 'm sure yours can too, 
  did you see that one about the dick smiths stuff ? 
  that was pretty decent too, 
  [ here you go ] ( https://foragerfunds.com/bristlemouth/dick-smith-is-the-greatest-private-equity-heist-of-all-time/ ) , was posted on the subreddit a while back, 
  i remember one time as a kid in wellington , dad took us up to the top of mount albert at that time of night where the sun has set but you 've still got the orange glow on the horizon . 
  we 're looking round for a bit , then he tells us to look up , and points out two dots moving across the sky - the space shuttle docking with the international space station . 
  being able to sit there and watch it fly over is one of the coolest things , definitely try and go out to see it if you can . 
  hi guys , thanks again for doing this ama and welcome to / r/newzealand on behalf of everyone here . 
  to get the ball rolling , i 've got a couple questions from people who wanted to ask stuff but could n't make it during the ama time :, 
  from / u/pebblezcrwd ( who is studying volcanology and is interested in geophysics and stuff like that ) :, 
   so [ this bathymetric map ] ( https://www.niwa.co.nz/sites/niwa.co.nz/files/sites/default/files/images/underseanz_2012_a4_150dpi.jpg ) of new zealand shows how exciting our plate boundary is . 
  so south of fiordland we have the indo-australian plate ~ ~ taking a dive ~ ~ subducting , and then you get up to around wellington and the table flips , so we have the pacific plate ~ ~ being devoured ~ ~ subducting beneath the indo australian plate . 
  this has two questions ;, 
   1 : is there a twisting of the pacific plate , and if there is , will the chatam rise slam into the north island ? 
   2 : for a plate to subduct , it has to enter the mantle at 45 degrees ( right ? ) . 
  so at the point where the puysegur trench becomes the alpine fault , what happens ? 
  does it snap and cause funkalicious quakes or does it just bend and then slide along our * just * transform fault ? 
  pls explain . 
  * is the central n.i being ripped apart or split by volcanic activity ? 
  from / u/thepickledpossum :, 
   what are your opinions on the possibility of zealandia becoming its own continent ? 
  yeah , i 've posted them in the topic - seems to be automod being a little overactive , i 'm just manually approving your posts as they come up , should have enough karma for it not to be an issue soon enough anyway . 
  there have been quite a few earthquake swarms around rotorua recently , is this normal behaviour for the area or could it be a sign that there 's some unrest in the area ?
