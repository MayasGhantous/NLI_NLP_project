   focuses on the civs that firaxis neglected, 
  is n't that what all modded civs do ? 
  fair enough - personally , i think introducing people to new cultures is half the fun, 
  at least it 's not ghost chips, 
  ( since i realised it 's a reference that probably wo n't make sense outside of new zealand , [ here 's ] ( http://youtu.be/diyvd9di1za?t=24s ) the source ), 
  my grandparents did this to my dad , except did n't tell him until years after he moved out and they gave it to him and mum as a wedding present, 
  i think the small country thing can work in europe because of the eu . 
  you can have the small country with a government for the people and so on , but then if the country runs into trouble it has the wider european community to call on for help . 
  in this case , i think venice might actually be better going it alone . 
  they 've got a reasonably solid economy compared to italy . 
  that said , it 's a fairly vulnerable one and they 'd have to figure out a way to combat the sinking of venice as well as help it survive sea level rising in the future . 
  but again , venice is better off in this case going alone . 
  the venetian government would be able to focus exclusively on these issues , whereas the italian government would also have to focus on issues facing sicily , and milan , and lombardy , and naples , and so on . 
  similarly , the tax money paid by citizens of venice can go directly to these issues and the infrastructure of venice , instead of having to be distributed throughout the rest of italy . 
  assuming venice would join the eu , i ca n't see a down side to them gaining independence ( except for italy ) . 
  so i say damn the torpedoes . 
  i loved the scene at the end of season 1 when he 's in the church :, 
  * looking upward : * every time i 've spoken to you , you 've never spoken back , although given our mutual disdain , i ca n't blame you for the silent treatment . 
  perhaps i 'm speaking to the wrong audience . 
  * looking downward : * can you hear me ? 
  are you even capable of language , or do you only understand depravity ? 
  peter , is that you ? 
  stop hiding in my thoughts and come out . 
  have the courage in death that you never had in life . 
  come out , look me in the eye and say what you need to say . 
  * looking at camera : * there is no solace above or below . 
  only us - small , solitary , striving , battling one another . 
  i pray to myself , for myself . 
  would trieste be able to survive if it became a free city state , like it was back after ww2 ? 
  would that be a preferred solution than joining venice ? 
  browsing this tonight and noticed you had n't been answered yet . 
  i 'm just a kiwi student with a couple history papers , but i 'll do my best to give a ( probably quite broad ) answer . 
  the treaty of waitangi does provide a basis for this legally , and during the 70 's the government established the [ waitangi tribunal ] ( http://www.justice.govt.nz/tribunals/waitangi-tribunal ) with the aim of settling disputes over land theft . 
  successive governments constantly have set targets of settling all waitangi disputes by year x , but they are still going on to this day . 
  one interesting case that comes to mind are the tuhoe iwi , of the north-east of the north island . 
  they had the same grievances that all iwi had , except they did n't sign the treaty . 
  this has caused a lot of issues for the government , and has resulted in some more radical members of the tribe calling for separatism . 
  the iwi 's webpage about their requests in that regard is [ here ] ( http://www.ngaituhoe.iwi.nz/settlement/aboutt%c5%abhoesettlement.aspx ) , which i would post some more about but that probably strays into the 20 year zone and i 'm pretty much out of time for the moment, 
  i would presume eventually it just seeps into the earth . 
  depending on how deep it goes , i suppose it could also get to a point where the cave is hot enough that it evaporates and floats around in the air within the cave or something, 
  i think it 's not so bad by having them as a hall of fame than if you were to just ban them outright . 
  that way you can have a link on the sidebar saying `` you should listen to these songs at least once '', 
  i 'd probably be willing to do a fatimid civ after my current lineup of civs is finished ( we 've got about 20 queued ) , and it seems like you 've got some great and unique ideas there . 
  i would need a bit of clarification though :, 
  what counts as an age-appropriate unit for the ua ? 
  what counts as making contact for the uu ? 
  in the mean time , i 'm not sure if you know of them but one of the civs that my team and i have previously completed is the ayyubids , led by saladin . 
  more info on their specifics is [ here ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?p=12803999#ayyubids ) , but that might go at least a bit of the way towards a better arabia ? 
  we 've also got a civ in the works based around the caliphates in spain - we 're having to try and make it a bit of an amalgam of different caliphates in order to make it different enough from morocco ( since a lot of the caliphates also ruled over there ) , but we 're doing our best to make that accurate too . 
  eventually we may even change current arabia into the abbasid caliphate , since that seems to be the primary focus, 
  i loved this episode . 
  i really hope they make ncis : no, 
  that 's what it was !, 
  i recognised her voice while watching but could n't put my finger on where i recognised it from,
