  like , i love that place so much it 's not even funny . 
  you 'd be better to go now than in the semester break though , since then you 'd be going in the middle of winter . 
  or even put it off to the end of the year and do a north island road trip , wellington in summer is gorgeous . 
  [ working link ] ( https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/fluoridation-decision-move-dhbs-0 ), 
  oh god , i know that feeling . 
  girl at work just had her last day before she goes off for bloody 10 months traveling all through the americas ( north and south ) and europe . 
  another couple are planning oes at the end of the year , and some more still have just gome back . 
  i 'm so fucking jealous of everyone , i 'd love to just bugger off for a couple months and go check out europe or whatever . 
  but i think traveling alone would be depressing , and no-one else wants to / can afford to go, 
   i 'm honestly a fan of disastrously windy weather . 
  i do n't mind it , and have some great tales from it ( we were evacuated from half the classrooms at primary on one day with a real bad southerly , ) but nothing compares to wellington on a good day . 
  went up on one of the airlifts after the earthquakes ( i 'm sure i 've told you this story before , but oh well ) and spent a couple weeks up there . 
  waking up early and walking across the city from oriental bay when it 's a gorgeous morning and no clouds in sight was awesome of its own right , but when you 're ducking down alleyways and finding hidden coffee shops or cafes and you just sit down and watch the city wake up , that 's something special . 
  we were very clear . 
  have n't been on one yet , but if what i 've heard about their anti-jetlag stuff is even half true then they 're awesome and i ca n't wait to go on one . 
  that said , i 'm still gon na go with the [ boeing 314 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_314_clipper ), 
  oh god , i never thought about that until now :(, 
  i just hope that united does n't stop its [ pacific hopper ] ( http://airwaysnews.com/blog/2014/05/15/an-island-hopper-adventure-unlike-any-other/ ) before i get a chance to fly it, 
  do n't think so , most of them were decommissioned after the war . 
  but i reckon huge flying boats like that are due for a comeback , especially here in the pacific . 
  there 's [ an awesome story ] ( http://lapsedhistorian.com/long-way-round-part-1/ ) about a clipper that was stuck out here when pearl harbour happened , definitely worth a read if you get the time, 
  mostly that , but also a result of being in a low pressure and dry environment for so long , kind of like altitude sickness . 
  the 787 has a bunch of features which combat it , and mean that you 're much more refreshed and not as jetlagged after the flight, 
  i 'm in two minds about this , given it 's an important piece of information and is n't as bad as saying like `` they deserve it '' or anything . 
  inclined to let it stay , but if the others think it should be removed then i 'd be okay with that, 
  they 've had aurora in gisborne before , so if it 's big enough you 're in with a shot, 
  nah , i 'd be up for an open discussion on it , especially with something as murky as rule 6 . 
  it was put in place to stop stuff like `` fuckwit john key screws up the country again with < policy  '' instead of `` john key refuses to back down over < policy  '' but it 's gotten out of control . 
  we definitely need to work out what 's what with that rule , as well as what sort of shit people want in the subreddit . 
  what can i say , i 'm a shill for the vaccine industry . 
  got to get the population in line with those mind control things in the flu jab, 
  damn this is cool , that bassline is awesome, 
  looks like you 're better going out sooner rather than later , [ forecast ] ( http://www.aurora-service.net/aurora-forecast/ ) has it dying out a bit around 9-10 ( though keep in mind these things are a guideline at best ), 
  have you tried over at / r/reomaori ? 
  why not ? 
  just came back , was a little bit of a glow but not really anything, 
  removed , rules 5 and 6, 
  you 'd think after 8 years they 'd stop blaming shit on the last lot, 
  i 've only got 30mbps now , so i 'm happy with that, 
  wait , what did i miss ? 
  guitar at the start sounds a little bit like an early demo of i still have n't found , and it feels like there 's a little bit of walk on in there too . 
  reminds me that i need to check out tuf again too , do n't listen to it nearly enough, 
  shit , get a room you two, 
  fucking slacker mods, 
  spoken like a true ( student/new zealander/alcoholic ), 
  anzac day is 10 days away though, 
  removed , rule 6, 
  yeah , but it 'd get a bit tedious if you 're having to do that every single time you need more fuel or ammo, 
  it 's a quiet morning for sure, 
  off to tekapo today . 
  here 's hoping the skies are clear , unlike the last five times i 've been there, 
  whereas wellington just says ` fuck it ' and has a free-for-all, 
  fucking bloody moon and clouds and shit ruining stargazing, 
  just was way too bright for anything interesting , i 've seen more stars from out birdlings flat way, 
  wait , what observatory ? 
  oh , west melton . 
  yeah , probably would n't call it a proper observatory like carter observatory is , but it 's still a decent enough night if you rug up warm, 
  but that 's assuming you 're just taking a random string of letters - you 're not going to name a planet `` aewhffhuhvoawtishkea , '' so the names will have to factor into account basic language premises which will drop the count down significantly . 
  you can ask him when he gets back . 
  he just went out for a pack of smokes , he 'll be back any moment now, 
  not enough j 's, 
  i think cunliffe has a lot to answer for in terms of fucking labour up recently . 
  he toppled shearer when shearer was doing well , then refused to step down after his loss for weeks . 
  when he finally did so , he threw his hat in the ring * again * instead of gracefully stepping to the side and doing what 's best for the party . 
  had he just waited in the wings he could very well have been in a much better job by now, 
  i thought some of them were the same at least - what 's with the preorder ships all being one or two specific models , then ? 
  anyone else having real issues trying to use american websites at the moment ? 
  tried to watch a video yesterday and it kept buffering every two seconds - did a speed test , which came back normal . 
  did one to an australian server , which came back normal . 
  did one to an american server and it came back at like 0.8 mbps , which seems to indicate something 's fucked up somewhere, 
  it 's a skill which seems to be fairly common in teachers . 
  lets them help a kid out without having to move their work around, 
  nah , 2degrees ( formerly spark ) - no idea what 's going on, 
  less than three hours until i 'm getting all my wisdom teeth out . 
  this should be fun . 
  fuck i should 've listened to you . 
  god they 're dicks, 
  eh , my day 's gon na be pretty shitty anyway . 
  was n't that bad by comparison, 
  first founded centuries ago when slavic peoples crossed the danube , serbia is a proud kingdom situated in the heart of the balkans , on the crossroads of europe and asia . 
  for centuries serbia flourished in the shadows of empires far greater , until the ottoman turks bested serbia and absorbed her into the ottoman empire . 
  throughout her occupation , serbia retained a fierce desire for independence and sought to refuse all attempts at assimilation . 
  finally , in 1882 serbia threw off the shackles of turkish colonialism and reemerged as a fledgling kingdom once more . 
  since this point , serbia championed the cause of its slavic brethren across the balkans who remained oppressed by the empires of austria-hungary and the ottomans , and sought to drive foreign empires from the region and unite all the slavic people under one banner . 
  it was this cause which motivated gavrilo princip to assassinate archduke franz ferdinand in june 1914 , which ultimately ignited the first world war and began four years of conflict across the european continent . 
  * july crisis * - receive increased production towards military units and buildings for each active defensive pact and declaration of friendship when not at war . 
  cities start with +25 hitpoints, 
  ** dobrovoljac ** - replaces great war infantry . 
  attacks better in rough terrain , and costs no maintenance . 
  moves faster while in non-hostile foreign territory . 
  ** mountain gun ** - replaces artillery . 
  slightly weaker , but can shoot twice when set up on a hill tile .
