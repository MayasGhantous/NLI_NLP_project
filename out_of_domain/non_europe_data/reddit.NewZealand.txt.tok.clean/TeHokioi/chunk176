  i believe it 's 5 % for each dof and 10 % for each dp , and capped at 60 % . 
  though i 'm not 100 % on that . 
  still in progress , jfd is prioritising uni stuff ( as i probably should be ), 
  normally it does , but my health insurance covers dental, 
  no , hitpoints . 
  the strength is the same , it just takes longer to fall, 
  yeah , we 've confirmed it, 
  leaves me money for car insurance too, 
  in my defence , the sedation has n't worn off and i ca n't feel my face, 
  you 'd need to check with / u/jessefrederickdaly , afaik it 's just a cosmetic change, 
  oh well yeah , there are others in the decision . 
  dead rooster verified that he 's the real deal, 
  survived the op , but that was the easy part . 
  bloody things hurt like a bitch and i can feel the half they left in there just sitting there , waiting . 
  the root was too close to the nerve , they did n't want to risk permanent numbness in the lip . 
  might still be a stitch , i dunno . 
  probably is, 
  not a bad idea , but would create some issues with overlap - especially re the politics filter, 
  there 's a bit of confusion around rule 6 - it does n't need to be the exact article title , it just needs to lack an opinion . 
  so posting this article as `` labour distort facts and fearmonger by saying that ... '' would n't be allowed , but saying `` labour claim ... '' or `` david cunliffe says . . '' would be fine . 
  maybe it 's just a cutaway illustration ? 
  people should know better than to say `` do n't quote me '' on here, 
  sod off , bot, 
  i was trying to cook rice in our rice cooker one time and forgot to switch it on at the wall . 
  next time , i make a point of turning it on at the wall but do n't realise that the power cord is n't plugged in at the rice cooker itself . 
  next time after that i did all that , but i forgot to switch the machine on . 
  i swear i can actually cook sometimes, 
  it 's a miracle the damn thing updated for once, 
  we 've got [ this playlist ] ( https://play.spotify.com/user/pouakai/playlist/3iekdkr2rvkrtvmmx7yaxi ) from tune thursday a while ago when people suggested their favourite songs from nz, 
  you happy now ? 
  probably came out harsher than i meant it to , sorry bout that, 
  maybe it 's a secret code which reveals the location of the batcave ? 
  do n't they do like skype appointments now ? 
  wait , only a surface 2 ? 
  you know they 're up to 4 now , right ? 
  it may be difficult to find one - we 've still got a couple at work , but they 've gone discontinued and stores will have likely sold out their supply by now . 
  we 've only still got ours because they were misplaced for about a year, 
  yeah , plus they 're actually half decent machines . 
  oh i 've burnt my fair share of food . 
  forgot to turn the stove down to low when i left it to simmer , there was barely anything left that was n't baked to the pot after, 
  i still prefer my dell xps , that thing is gorgeous and works well, 
  i thought you meant your reddit inbox at first and so i was going to reply to this just so that you had something in your inbox , but you did n't mean that so i 'll reply anyway just in case, 
  i 've still got another couple years, 
  pretty much straight out of the camera 's jpgs ( have n't processed the raw files yet ) which is why it looks average quality . 
  there were too many clouds and the moon was way too bright for decent star shots , so i decided to make the most of it and try some of this sort of shot . 
  did n't come out as good as i 'd have liked , but i think it 's decent enough as a launch point . 
  shit , i thought you were just an urban legend, 
  i 've got no idea - i think it 's mostly a donald trump version of / r/sandersforpresident , but there are some people there who are taking the piss . 
  that sucks , sorry to hear it . 
  there 's bound to be another one that 'll be good further down the line somewhere though, 
  5pm on the dot means you 'll be one or two seconds late . 
  i 'm disappointed in you . 
  finally actually starting to feel the pain everyone talks about with wisdom teeth removal , though it 's nowhere near as bad as i 'd have expected . 
  at least i 'm back on solid food instead of another day of goddamn mashed potatoes, 
  that 's what you get when you use food colouring as a mixer, 
  no politics, 
  yeah , that 's understandable . 
  if it makes you feel any better i thought dick smiths would be a decent place to work a couple years ago, 
  thankfully i never heard back and i ended up at the more successful one , but yeah, 
  day 4 if you count the day of the op as day 1 , if not then day 3 sounds about right . 
  seems to be consistent with what others have said too, 
  people in wellington actually use pedestrian crossings ? 
  what browser do you use ? 
  [ install this ] ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/reddit-enhancement-suite/ ) - you 'll get a little tag icon next to usernames which makes it real easy to set tags and shit for people . 
  it adds most of the stuff from reddit gold too , and used to show you the up and down vote counters for each comment until reddit decided to get rid of the bit of code that it relied on . 
  does n't seem to have worked , just woke up early because it 's hurting like a bitch and is feeling worse than it has since the op, 
  that might be it , decided i did n't need any last night . 
  sure as hell taking them religiously now though, 
  we use it at work too for the price matches normally, 
  steam , it 's their free weekend . 
  i 've already added a flair today , are you never satisfied ? 
  holy shit you 're alive, 
  should be , yeah . 
  we 're opening at one , but smaller places might stay closed for the whole day, 
  was going to do an anzac day one , but now i 'm not sure, 
  hrv is one of those systems which takes heat out of your attic to warm the house up . 
  the control panel has three temperatures on it - the temperature in the attic , the temperature in the house and the temperature you 've set it to . 
  if the house is cooler than the set temperature and the attic then it 'll pump air in , and so on . 
  what op is saying is that when they looked , all three temperatures were the same , meaning the house and the attic were both at the set temperature . 
  now he 's annoyed that he did n't win the jackpot, 
  despite being a small archipelago in the south pacific , new zealand is never one to back away from a fight . 
  upon the outbreak of world war two in september 1939 , new zealand declared war on germany alongside the united kingdom while under the rule of its most beloved prime minister in history . 
  throughout the course of the war , new zealand fought bravely in both theatres , earning a fearsome reputation amongst friend and foe alike . 
  this is not michael joseph savage 's sole legacy , however , as his period of leadership saw the implementation of pioneering welfare systems which ensured new zealand was to be a beacon of humanitarianism for decades to come . 
  new zealand - michael joseph savage,
