  this is part of a coordinated anzac day release with another modding team headed by an australian , who released a ww2 focused australia civ [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/4gclwp/for_all_those_fans_of_civilization_v_out_there_to/ ) - try to play nice if you head over to check it out , but do n't let them beat us, 
  despite being a small archipelago in the south pacific , new zealand is never one to back away from a fight . 
  upon the outbreak of world war two in september 1939 , new zealand declared war on germany alongside the united kingdom while under the rule of its most beloved prime minister in history . 
  throughout the course of the war , new zealand fought bravely in both theatres , earning a fearsome reputation amongst friend and foe alike . 
  this is not michael joseph savage 's sole legacy , however , as his period of leadership saw the implementation of pioneering welfare systems which ensured new zealand was to be a beacon of humanitarianism for decades to come .

  be sure to also check out colonialist legacies ' ww2 australia mod [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/4gclzp/to_commemorate_anzac_day_colonialist_legacies_has/ ) !, 
  is that your city ? 
  i want that start, 
  shit , did n't even think about that ( helen is a spy though , along with winston ) - i was focusing more on how we played a fairly important role in founding the un , and how we 're always involved in war but never in conquest, 
  i 'm from here , it 'd be a bit weird if i did n't know we existed !, 
  nah , i 'm down in the south island . 
  used to live in welly though , still love it to bits, 
  it 's not that hard to get a better flag than the proposed alternative ... 
  maybe with a modern nz , alongside a dairy farm or something, 
  there 's big sales every couple months where you can pick everything up for like $ 15 , at which point you 've got access to hundreds ( literally ) of mods to expand the game further . 
  it 's [ civilization v ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/8930 ) , though you 'll need the complete version to play it ( it 's only like $ 15 when it 's on sale now ), 
  i love this one , it 's just so cool . 
  hoping we get stuff close to this on soe, 
  the one where they dedicated it to the pike river miners was amazing , still gives me chills today, 
  it 's in the options - there are two checkboxes , automatically scale interface and use small scale interface . 
  untick both of them and you 'll have it look like that , along with a bunch of other changes in the city screen and stuff, 
  yeah , ynaemp 's giant earth . 
  back when scotland was holding their independence referendum , jfd and us at more civs each released a scotland mod - representing both sides of the vote . 
  jfd 's ( the one already linked ) was the no vote , while [ my one ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=315655130 ) was a full-on nationalist independence one . 
  i 've considered doing quebec before , but never gotten around to it . 
  same with catalonia , i 've been more focused on other civs at this point, 
  fair comment - though i 'm doing this in a similar vein to seddon being a ww1 leader , or teddy roosevelt as a ww1 leader for america . 
  while the civ is loosely in that time period , we went for the best leader in the area . 
  and while fraser did do a fair bit for the war effort , on the whole his prime ministership pales in comparison to the impact savage had on society , and his adoration amongst the population . 
  removed . 
  rule 5, 
  the mod was actually part of a dual release with more civs ( the team i 'm part of ) - we did a ww2 nz civ under michael joseph savage which was released alongside the australia one . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://imgur.com/a/eakzq ) a bunch of screenshots and info on it , there 's more in my history but it seems your automod does n't like links to reddit ( and new zealanders ? ), 
  different civs have different focuses . 
  with vanilla civs , they tended to represent an entire civ 's history - germany for example had an ancient germanic ua , a holy roman uu , a prussian leader and a nazi uu . 
  but with mods , we 're able to have different leaders for each part of a nation 's history . 
  you can now get four different germany mods , each with a different part of the history as its sole focus . 
  in this aspect , the civ here represents australia during its wartime years , just as my one does for new zealand . 
  if you 've seen the dawn of man text you 'd know that civs are normally glorified a fair bit , so you 're going to have it all painted in a positive light for sure . 
  i dunno , from the sound of it it 's a more ab / zooropa sound anyway, 
  yeah , as would i. 
  in an ideal world i 'd love to split the maori up into a couple of iwi - a resource and greenstone based ngai tahu , or te kooti , maybe even a guerrilla tuhoe . 
  but art and code are both valuable assets , so i 'll take what i can get . 
  thank you for your feedback . 
  have you seen my polynesian civ split ? 
  it breaks vanilla polynesia up into four separate civs . 
  the uu belongs to the maori , the leader to hawaii , the ui to rapa nui and the ua to tonga, 
  to be fair , the ub * is * a monument to the fallen ... 
  i love finding out shit like this . 
  only recently found out a kiwi was one of the leading figures in the us space program during the space race too, 
  but that 's the whole point of the civ d :, 
  such are the joys of fpp, 
  go to the wig party as a whig party partier ? 
  it 'll be really interesting if labour , the greens and nz first are roughly equal sizes come the election . 
  winnie might finally get his shot at the top job, 
  i dunno , a lot can happen in a year . 
  john 's definitely aged a lot in the last year , it 's nowhere near as smooth as the term before was . 
  if auckland housing collapses all bets are off too , but beyond that i 'd say there 's a host of things which could damage him . 
  biggest thing that needs to happen though is labour need to clean house in their advisors and behind the scenes , then get their shit together and actually try to win . 
  get a better one, 
  i was honestly expecting robertson and ardern to lead a split off social democrats or something once little got in on the backs of the unions , with labour going back to a proper workingman 's party . 
  science can be pretty cool , especially if you 're someone like babylon who can go super-tall turtle . 
  keep a small army for self-defence that 's advanced enough to mop the floor with anyone and you 're set, 
  oh nah , i was meaning robertson 's party take over as the main left wing one , and labour becomes similar to the greens, 
  removed , rule 12, 
  wait , is jesse supposed to get powers ? 
  yep - it 's from the most recent episode , and is set two years ago ( before maggie was born ), 
  or , y' know , we 're not omnipotent and we rely on people reporting posts to catch them ? 
  why did constantinople get the works ? 
  you sure that 's right ? 
  i 'm pretty sure i 've got 30mbps and i 'm not on fibre, 
  i take it you would n't get a refund if you cancelled and rebooked ? 
  that makes a bit more sense , definitely a big improvement then, 
  almost want to go and give you the roundel as a flair now, 
   glad you updated mapache instead of taking out . 
  i agree , it 's one of the few maps added recently that are actually reasonably unique in playstyle . 
  it 'll take a bit of people getting used to it , but i can see it being in for the long run once people get the hang of it, 
  this whole thing is making me want to go and develop the technology now, 
  there 's no way anyone in the energy sector over here would be looking near mt. 
  tarawera for anything . 
  iirc it was a survey done by geonet ( our version of the usgs ) on the lake and the area as a whole, 
   kiwi,
