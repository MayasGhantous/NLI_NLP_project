  you know what ? 
  i 'm gon na have marmite for breakfast now too, 
  we want people to do their own research first . 
  after a while , it gets tiresome of seeing `` hey , nz looks awesome and i want to go there for two weeks , what should i do ? '', 
  our recommendations are n't going to change from the fifty other times , so you should check those first and see if your questions have been answered . 
  if you 've searched and ca n't find an answer , or have a couple of gaps in your itinerary or whatever , then those are fine , but only if you 've gone and done a bit of searching yourself first, 
  i think it 's a bit of both - they 've found the terraces again , but they 're much smaller than they were, 
  if none of the mods have posted on reddit in the last three months you can request the subreddit on / r/redditrequest, 
  or you could delete it now to mess with him, 
   ruapehu jealous of all the attention white island is getting . 
  - / u/officialgeonet, 
  official geonet confirmed it, 
  argentina looks fucking awesome , hope you have a great time and take lots of pictures !, 
  in all seriousness , is there any chance the two are related , or is it just a coincidence that they happened within a couple days of each other ? 
  i suppose that 's good , otherwise by that logic we 'd expect the whole north island in between to start waking up and that would n't end well,

  i think i found the plot for the next disaster movie ... just the right mix of bad science and apocalypse, 
  wait , you work in a museum ? 
  what 's that like ? 
  i never realised until now that there were more than two panels to that, 
  ~ ~ torres del paine and ~ ~ tierra del fuego would be on my list too , but you might be stretched if you 've only got a week, 
  edit : torres del paine is in chile , close enough, 
  surely that would * heat it up ? 
  ca n't make it tonight , frantic preparation for recarpeting the entire house . 
  and i have to try and write two essays at the same time, 
  mike mcroberts is still there , though i ca n't imagine him sticking around for much longer . 
  hopefully both of them head over to rnz with john, 
  shit , it 's been four years . 
  things were ... different back then . 
  thanks though !, 
  tl ; dr : read the article , it 's not that long and it has pictures, 
  maybe that explains why taupo is such a massive volcano ? 
  sorry i could n't make it , i 'll try next time .

  we 're back for another round - this time featuring a new music flair and everything . 
  going to try to avoid bands which were featured last year , so like last time feel free to drop in suggestions for songs or bands to feature . 
  and if you 've got any other things you 'd like to see for new zealand music month too , i might be able to make them happen now . 
  for me personally ( and i 'm sure a lot of others ) , zed has a firm place as the soundtrack to the early 2000 's . 
  * glorafilia * was a frequent summer song , while * renegade fighter * took the airtime spot for radio stations with a heavier music base . 
  hailing from christchurch , the group held onto this position for the first half of the 2000s , before going their own ways in 2005 after their second album . 
  many of the former members remain involved in music however , either on their own or in new bands .

  i feel like the top would get used way more than the bottom - wonder what it 'd be like if you flipped the middle upside down, 
  another classic kiwi band that australia likes to think is theirs , split enz was huge in the 70 's and 80 's , and represented the first foray of the finn brothers into music stardom . 
  their music has become iconic , and even at times was caught up in the political drama of the time - * six months in a leaky boat * was banned in the united kingdom because it was released there during the falklands war , and was perceived to be bad for morale during a naval war . 
  despite this , split enz gained huge success both home and abroad , and remain one of the greatest kiwi bands decades after their separation .

  got to make sure monique does n't think you 're dumb, 
  you 'll get a sweet verified flair too if you do give us verification , i might even let you choose what colour it is, 
  what gave you that idea ? 
  the free tickets to his show so that people will be able to come to his show ? 
  there was that ` four giants of iceland ' thing on / r/pics a while ago , i 'll see if i can track it down, 
  yeah , i 'd just tracked it down too . 
  pretty sure there were wallpapers somewhere too though, 
  if you can prove you 're dr. nick you can get a bloody unique image flair, 
   civilization,

  then again , i would 've been into it maybe .

  goddamn this is bad, 
  i would n't be surprised if that 's how the whole thing came up :, 
  * `` hey , why do n't we get rid of four ? 
  * `` oh right , and we 'll replace it with just reality tv . 
  that 'll be great . 
  * `` shit , why did n't i think of that ? 
  nice one , we 'll do that !, 
  mainly because the creator actually showed up and asked for permission first, 
  a mix of multiple genres prominent in nz music , * turnaround * and the awesome music video for it tells the story of a man captured by the dark buzz curse , and the attempts to save him from it . 
  the song itself captures the musical style of ahoribuzz perfectly , in that it incorporates a bunch of different stuff and puts out a great song in response . 
  it 's closely associated with fly my pretties too , but distinct enough to warrant its own day in the sun .

  you 'd probably be better flying chch-auckland , then driving down and spending a day in taupo beforehand . 
  it 's a shorter drive ( only four hours ) and you 'd have more time to check out that neck of the woods .
