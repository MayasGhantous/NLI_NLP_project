  if you wanted to do normal touristy stuff for a day and had the time you could divert and stay in rotorua , they 've got a bunch of cool things to check out . 
  day in the mud pools might do you good after all the hiking anyway, 
  i love this song , especially the popmart version . 
  adding in the sbs drums to the middle of it ties it in nicely with the original on the same topic , and makes them a sort of dual thing . 
  sbs is the yelling and the anger , then please comes in with the despair and the exhaustion, 
  fyi , mentions do n't work if you have more than five or so usernames in the one post, 
  this is the main thing i 've picked up from doing politics at uni - nobody has any damn idea what a country actually is, 
  simple solution would be to take a longer drive back . 
  overnight one night in rotorua and the next in the coromandel or something , tiki tour it proper . 
  you 're having better luck than i am - i 'm thinking about going flatting next year , but none of my mates are and i 'm terrified of going flatting alone, 
  yeah , but that 's not always the case . 
  somaliland is essentially a functioning and ( mostly ) stable democracy and has been since it declared independence in ' 91 , but nobody recognises it and so it 's not a country and is still lumped in with the shitshow that is somalia, 
  ilam apartments are like $ 300 a week though are n't they ? 
  oh nah , i must 've been thinking of the halls , which are like 13k for only 40 weeks or something . 
  someone else that gets rubbish nicknames , nice . 
  i either get nicknamed after an infomercial , and occasionally bonaparte . 
  yeah , second one was the plan but then i 'm back where i started with a lack of mates interested in flatting ( and looking for a flat ), 
  it 's still not always even that - as far as i can tell , somaliland is literally just a country that no-one thinks is one . 
  we 'll see , they laid down a challenge in their fb post to the aussies, 
  goldenhorse 's music always seems to remind me of summer , and road trips across the country . 
  possibly due to the fact that it was always dad 's cup of tea more than mine , and back in those days he always got to decide the music on those trips . 
  all things considered though , in that early 2000 's period they were certainly a big figure in the music industry , with their debut album reaching # 1 in the charts and their followup reaching # 2 . 
  maybe tomorrow also features in almost as many ads as counting the beat , so that might have something to do with it too .

  it 's not left out , we 're also adding in about 7 greek city states as city states , corinth included, 
  city state yes , civ no . 
  keep in mind that it 's a split , not a pack - with the exception of pergamon , all of the civs take at least one aspect of the original vanilla greece, 
  i do n't know how we could include the option , mainly because i 've got no idea how city state selection goes, 
  nope , sparta has the peloponnesesian league and athens the delian league, 
  having just said i 'd never touch that channel with a 10 foot pole , i might actually watch a house of cards style show of the last year or so at mediaworks, 
  not as part of the split , but it wo n't be far behind, 
  not anymore , it 's an assault trieres, 
  do n't forget to fill us in on how it 's going , i 'd love to hear what argentina 's like, 
  mac 's ginger beer is n't much better , it 's disgusting . 
  not if we fill out the wiki properly . 
  just need to encourage people to help fill it out . 
  could be a jab about how he misspelt hilary barry 's name in the email he sent out to staff about it, 
  does this make jfd bill gates ? 
  best way i 've found for modding is to look under the hood of existing ones . 
  most xml tags are fairly self-explanatory , and it gives you a basic idea of how things work, 
   we have n't made any official plans to move into native america . 
  * looks at cl civ list *, 
  umm ... 
  oh , you 're meaning native america as in native ( united states of ) america , not native america as in native ( north ) america . 
  though you forgot the cree, 
  first americans ? 
  because in a priority lane you 'd get all the aucklanders who think they 're a priority using it, 
  step 1 : get some tree trunks, 
  step 2 : chop and arrange in square, 
  step 3 : find a door or something, 
  step 4 : chuck it on top of the tree trunks, 
  step 5 : glue and saw until you have a table, 
  peter jackson : five hours long, 
  or civ 5 with mods, 
   best mate 's so straight up said to me `` hey , he likes you . 
  just saying '' and now wtf do i do . 
  make damn sure they 're right before you say anything , and you know why . 
  though it does n't sound like there 's much room for confusion based on what you 've said . 
  i thought you 'd been over it with him before ? 
  wait , then what happened with the best mate 's so ? 
  ah , so she does n't know for certain ( like , he did n't tell her ? ), 
  if you 're going to say something , be careful about it, 
  that 's all good , your `` we 'll see how it goes '' had me worried . 
  it could have just been that everyone else was busy and he was bored or something . 
  then again , tickle fights ... 
  yeah , you definitely need to be 100 % certain before you make any accusations , otherwise the whole thing can blow up in your face if you 're wrong, 
  i look surprised any time someone mentions someone else to me, 
  i did n't realise there were still cameras that low resolution, 
   be nice . 
  music was gary clark jr , do n't think he 's a local, 
  yeah , he called you a troll and said it was bullshit, 
  what if you 're sitting on your sofa * in * the bahamas ? 
  why not have it so that when you take a screenshot , it saves an image as well as a file which can be opened by nms . 
  that way you can still share images online normally , but if people have nms then they can open it and view the whole scene ? 
  yep , that 'd do it . 
  i 'd love to have three so i can run games like civ or total war on all of them at once , at the moment with two whatever 's selected is broken in half by the gap in the monitors, 
  wait , youtube tutorials ? 
  i must have missed the memo, 
  but not the traditional western and eastern fronts , which is where most games in ww1 are set, 
  battlefield 1912 is just everyone being super paranoid that a war might break out, 
  no politics means no politics . 
  is there anybody in there ? 
  wait , i did ? 
  sorry about that, 
  jesus , how many times has this been reposted in here already ? 
  / u/openmindedskeptic , could we please look at putting some rules in against reposting of top submissions ? 
  looks like it 's fallen off a bit as the sub has gotten more popular , but it 's been definitely at least the third time it 's been on here . 
  same thing with that shot of ted cruz in the senate as well, 
  awesome , cheers . 
  gim me a yell if you ever wanted a hand with it - even something like a frequently posted images list on the submission page would be good, 
  sorry i have n't been able to keep up with the nz music month posts , been way too busy over the past week or so between uni and re-carpeting the house . 
  it was so weird watching the west wing at the same time as psych and mad men,
