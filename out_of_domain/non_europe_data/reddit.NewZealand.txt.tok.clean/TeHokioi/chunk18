  as always , i 'm more than happy to answer any questions you have about any of this ( or even modding in general ! ), 
  let me know what you think !,

  the pack can either be downloaded from steam workshop [ here ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=242272997 ) or from civfanatics [ here ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?p=13136196#india ) . 
  as always , it 's a team effort . 
  / u/sukritact did some of the art , as did / u/leugi and janboruta .

  special thanks also to jfd and irkalla for troubleshooting and consultation !, 
  that 's a good question , i 'll ask leugi and get back to you, 
  the file should download automatically , but steam does n't always work as it should . 
  if you follow the link to civfanatics there 's a manual download link too, 
  if you 're meaning the icon in the bottom left , i 'm using the large-scale interface , which can be changed in the options, 
  i 've cross-posted it there , although it seems much more popular here right off the bat, 
  you can either subscribe to it on steam , or follow the links to civfanatics and manually download it from there . 
  if you manually download it , place it in the following location :, 
  my documents / my games / sid meier 's civilization v / mods, 
  and it should hopefully work, 
  oh awesome , thank you so much !, 
  nah , it 's usually delhi . 
  but for the tsl map delhi was too close to agra , so if you 're playing with ynaemp it 'll be calcutta, 
  those two are n't as op as it would seem . 
  if anyone is op in this , it 's the mughals, 
  the mod is free , but how much the game costs can vary based on where you buy it and what sales are on, 
  this is correct - at the very least , you need the brave new world expansion pack in addition to the base game to play this mod, 
  someone else is currently working on a sikh civ [ here ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=519725 ) , i 'm not sure about a rajput civ . 
  we might revisit india eventually , but we have an awful lot of stuff on our plate at the moment so it might not be for a while, 
  oh right , whoops, 
  you 're welcome , glad you enjoy them !, 
  it 's more of a defensive trait , i think . 
  if you 've got an invading army that is massive you 're able to sacrifice a bit of population ( which you might lose anyway ) to create the units to defend your empire with, 
  as for what unit it is , it 's the most powerful melee unit available at that time - i think it goes warrior , spearmen , pikemen , sepoy , riflemen , gw infantry , ww2 infantry , mech, 
  it should only be in the mods folder , nowhere else . 
  try verifying your game cache ( right click on the game in your steam library , properties and there should be something in there ) . 
  it 'll also only show up if you go through the mods menu ingame , they wo n't show up if you go set up game from the top menu, 
  i 'm not sure , but they * might * stack , which would make it more powerful for chola than others since they 'd get double influence, 
  all four of these civs are in one pack . 
  i 'll work on a collection on steam for the rest soon , hopefully sometime in the next couple weeks, 
  not too hard , but i 'm really busy at the moment with uni work, 
  that 's probably because of how the leaderheads are made . 
  they 're actually a collage of the other leaders ingame so that they look like the same art style , so because we 've only got one indian leader ( gandhi ) we 're a bit thin on source material . 
  i 'll pass that along to the artist though , thanks !, 
  well the least i can do is give you an upvote back !, 
  you need to keep in mind that you wo n't be getting that kind of faith until mid-late game at the earliest . 
  early on you 'll get around five faith at most, 
  good idea , thanks !, 
  we 've started contacting a few , as well as contacting some of the original authors of the academy to see if they 'd be willing to come back . 
  even if you 're not that great at the game we can still use your help - personally i only just made the jump from prince to king ; when i was writing guides i hovered around warlord / prince . 
  and even then , we still need people to convert some of the guides into wa format . 
  so even though you claim you 're not that good at the game , i 'm sure you 'd be a great help !, 
  it 's primarily a single player thing , although the point of the guide is to help a player entirely new to the game know what to do . 
  for example , my inca guide talks about how you should prioritise hill tiles , and that you can get massive networks of roads without paying a cent of maintenance on them, 
  the thing about the freedom of speech on the guidelines is pretty much just saying that you ca n't go around spouting hate speech or whatever and going * ad hominem * in topics . 
  be respectful and you should be fine, 
  and now it 's been deleted from the host too . 
  i wonder if it was the music or the porn that got it removed ?
