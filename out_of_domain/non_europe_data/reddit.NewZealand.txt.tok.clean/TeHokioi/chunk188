  * in a shock twist , ansett new zealand has won airline of the year in new zealand for 2016 , despite having been out of existence for more than a decade *, 
  i could n't trust him on arrow for like the first ten episodes because of it, 
  could always have it as a caveat to membership, 
  so i 'm just casually invading europe , when all of a sudden my armies in italy decide i can get fucked and start a civil war , taking coastal north africa and my capital with them . 
  bastards do n't even give a shit that rome 's on it 's last legs . 
  at least i 've still got iberia to launch attacks from, 
  edit : get fucked you bloody nobles , i 'm pharaoh again bitches . 
  retaken all lost territory , and launching an invasion of the balkans . 
  i think so ? 
  there may be a couple detours in town , but you can definitely get there at least, 
  total war . 
  managed to hold them off at rome while i reconquer africa, 
  i went to the foundry on a saturday night mid-semester one time . 
  including us , there were maybe 15 people there , and the place shut up about 10 . 
  unless there 's an event on , it 's pretty much dead . 
  should catch up for one when uni starts up again sometime, 
  seriously ? 
  rome 2 and attila are some of my favourite tw games . 
  just wish they 'd make an empire 2 now, 
  bloody hell 404 , you 're like five months too early, 
  go back and play it again , it 's so much better now . 
  they 've added the imperator augustus campaign too , which is essentially a second grand campaign set during the octavian / marc antony civil war , for free . 
  they 've fixed pretty much all of the bugs too, 
  i 'm surprised you 've rated mothers of the disappeared so low . 
  i 'd say it 's my favourite album closer besides the wanderer , and is an insanely powerful song . 
  bono 's pleading in spanish at the end of [ this version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txgckwetzde ) always gets me , i really wish they stuck with el pueblo vencera as a concert closer . 
  most of them wiped their accounts and left when the area 64 shit blew up, 
  removed , no posting of personal information . 
  [ bono ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/u2_21081983_01_800b.jpg ) on the far right ? 
  more of a student than me , and i 'm half way through my third year already, 
  your posts make me realise i 'll never understand fashion, 
  that 's pretty much all of my mates - barely talk to anyone anymore : /, 
  how impossible is impossible ? 
  knowing what to wear would be a good start . 
  my standard everyday wardrobe consists of a zip-up hoodie , t-shirt and jeans , normally just rotating the t-shirt . 
  as far as when i 'm going out socialising , i can probably count on one hand the number of clothes for that purpose i have , so any help on what works for that sort of slightly-fancier-than-normal-but-not-classy thing would be greatly appreciated . 
  i do n't study . 
  most i 've ever studied is a day before an exam . 
  maybe two days before an essay, 
  wait until a housing crash and then give it a shot ? 
  how i took / u/mrcyn 's comment is ` why did you choose to support national , ' in which instance it would be the way he worded it because he ca n't shape national 's values if he 's not yet a part of it, 
  you do n't even need to spend anything , just say you will . 
  how are those bridges , northland ? 
  as a cantab , i 'm jealous, 
  huh ? 
  i 've heard a fair few people pissed off about it , especially since ecan is doing an absolutely shit job of the first letter, 
  i love it when the sky gets like this - no clouds , and that big rainbow from orange through to blue and black . 
  it was gorgeous when we went over to qld a couple years back, 
  we ca n't elect our regional council , since the government took it over and refuses to let us have it back, 
  what post ? 
  what a shit cunt, 
  implying the committee actually looked at the flags they chose in our one ? 
  time for a return of the [ united tribes ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/flag_of_the_united_tribes_of_new_zealand.svg/2000px-flag_of_the_united_tribes_of_new_zealand.svg.png ) flag ? 
  good idea , i was wanting a higher res ruapehu for a while now . 
  all good by you / u/whodoyoucall ? 
  sweet as , i 'll sort it out soon . 
  how about that other pano you 've got in your history , the tongariro one ? 
  header needs to be 2000 x 200 , but if possible i 'd like to play around with it a bit so that it looks good to fit the header design . 
  so maybe if i could get a height of 600 and i 'll go from there ? 
  i do n't think there 's a search engine for it , i 'm not even sure if they know what the internet is that far south . 
  the original story was talking about places closing down when their owners retired as they could n't find people to replace them , so i 'd imagine there 's at least some truth to it, 
  paging / u/weathermannz if you 're still alive, 
  the ashanti are n't focused just on city states , they can purchase units with gsp too . 
  and mongolia can just conquer shit for the hell of it . 
  though i 'd love to have sparta or macedon show up, 
  you 'd be amazed at the number of people who come into work and want to take shit away in cars way too small . 
  one guy had to get his mate to come pick up the rest of his speaker system ( since his ute could only fit two , ) then the mate shows up in a bloody honda civic . 
  we got the other five speakers in though . 
  and then there was the guy who left his kids behind to he could fit his home theatre system in his car . 
  i 'd imagine so , she was left behind too, 
  washington background and everything , not bad, 
  meanwhile i 'm getting more and more excited for the grand tour as well . 
  they 're in florence with an aston martin today, 
  shit , you 're good at this . 
  could i pm you with pics or whatever for more specific advice ? 
  what else would you burn it with ? 
  i would n't think boiling water would set something on fire , but maybe, 
  i 'd still think that the water would put it out, 
  think of it like an ncea history paper . 
  what 's the significance to new zealanders ? 
  i bought 9 books on book depository around then , none have shown up yet . 
  i 'd still wait a week or two, 
  couple years ago , even last year i loved hauraki . 
  great shows , great music , and so on . 
  but now , it seems like it 's just ` bhuja and bros ' with that constant bizarre sense of humour , and the same songs they 've been playing to death for the past two years . 
  they need to get some new music , and get some more shows than replaying bhuja 24/7 . 
  he explained in the album descriptions . 
  did they really , if you 're just going to be on reddit for that time anyway ? 
  do you read [ writingprompts at all ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/writingprompts/comments/2ueggh/wp_instead_of_oceans_they_are_all_big_forests/ ) there were a couple prompts like this , they 're really cool, 
  hey , i was taking advantage of the rubbish pound . 
  and none of them were over $ 30, 
  not trying to justify obama flying around hillary clinton , but do n't campaigns receive funds from the government anyway ? 
  so even in normal circumstances republican voters are indirectly going to fund democratic campaigns and vice-versa . 
  still working for me , maybe it 's a regional thing ? 
  i 've talked with chloe in the past and verified her original account , so it should be easy enough to verify this one and sort out an ama if she 's keen . 
  would love to have an ama , even if it is a bit of a local issue . 
  better than turning up at 11, 
  we 're in a good position this year too , since it 's winter down here and so the days are shorter . 
  muslims up in iceland are pretty much fucked,
