  holy crap , hope you do n't get charged for it . 
  i guess that 's a pretty telling response to the experiment , no ? 
  we have done more civs !, 
  the full list we 've released is [ here ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=494241 ) , and we 've got about another 20 lined up after that, 
  let 's not forget commodus , who renamed each month one of his names once there were 12 :, 
  * veritas * is * truth * in latin , so maybe that 's something to do with it too ? 
  hurry , boy , she 's waiting there for you !, 
  i would chip in with the people saying turn based strategy . 
  last year i would fire up a game of civ 5 while studying , usually do something like one turn / one paragraph , or one turn / one problem or whatever . 
  it 's also good since they essentially pause every turn and wait for you, 
  except felicity, 
  the buccaneers - henry morgan, 
  * letter of marque * - naval naval units can enter enemy territory without open borders , but may turn hostile if they end their turn on a tile owned by an enemy . 
  receive extra gold for each trade route pillaged , city captured or unit killed, 
  unique unit : corsair , privateer replacement . 
  receives a temporary combat boost after raiding a trade route , and has an additional bonus against naval units , unlike the privateer which it replaces . 
  unique improvement : rum distillery , requires machinery . 
  must be built on either jungle or marsh , or a sugar resource . 
  provides +1 food and +1 gold . 
  if built on a sugar resource , converts it to a source of rum . 
  after 40 turns of being worked , the distillery upgrades to a vintage distillery , which provides additional yields . 
  credit goes to / u/janboruta for the artwork ( except for the rum icon , which is / u/sukritact ) , / u/leugi for the models , / u/charlatanalley for the dawn of man voiceover and jfd for helping pretty much everything . 
  also to reedstilt ( who may be / u/reedstilt but i 'm not 100 % sure ) and viregel for civilopedia work . 
  can be downloaded from the following links : [ steam workshop ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=244496457 ) | [ civfanatics ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?p=13146373#pirates ), 
  we take our civs , even our april fool 's ones , seriously, 
  it was made by / u/leugi i believe, 
  we know , but there are n't any colours that fit any better for the buccaneers, 
  nah , just naval units have the promotion, 
  does n't work with the icon, 
  it 's a static image like all the others , but the dawn of man has a voiceover . 
  we may get a 3d leaderhead at some point if they become more prevalent , but we 'll have to wait and see, 
  we originally had morgan as the leader because his leaderscene could have had him sitting in a hammock , like in [ this picture ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/pg_014_-_henry_morgan_recruiting_for_the_attack_%28bw%29.jpg ) , but it did n't work out and by the time we 'd got the leaderscene done we had the civilopedia written so could n't change it, 
  whoa , did n't realise it 'd been done before . 
  we ca n't do custom animations at this point anyway . 
  3d sure , and some civs have 3d leaders , but they have to use vanilla animations . 
  this is an individual civ , but we have released around 13 more civs [ here ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=494241 ) . 
  there are plenty more in that forum from other authors too , i suggest you check them out if you have n't done so already, 
  we do n't know . 
  it 's using tags from the game , but we have no clue if the code scales it automatically, 
  because the buccaneers were loosely organised , so a captain might get greedy and go off on his own, 
  nah , it does n't . 
  although i suppose you could say that they increase the value of a trade route to the city , which has tourism benefits ... 
  i forgot what the day was . 
  he has n't left . 
  he 's going around your empire . 
  better seal that gap between camas and washougal, 
  yeah , that 's exactly what it means . 
  if you wanted , you could change a farm to a trading post to a customs house to a citadel and so on . 
  turns put the code has been there since vanilla, 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's like trading posts, 
  reverse jesus ship, 
  it 's an actual civ , i think the title is a bit confusing . 
  you can download and play it, 
  it 's an actual civ , there 's a link up top to download, 
  you can , it 's a proper civ, 
  it 's a joke civ , but it 's still a civ . 
  link is at the top, 
  it * is * done , and can be downloaded now, 
  i think so , this seems a lot more concrete than red was, 
  hopefully not, 
  i took what happened last episode as him testing that one from the great lakes office out, 
  nope , just bnw, 
  was n't that the musical guy ? 
  i would suggest x-posting this to / r/diy, 
  no , just sugar or empty jungle / marsh tiles, 
   who had gathered together so many great works of brilliant geniuses, 
  do we have any idea what sort of great works orosius is referring to ? 
  by which i mean do we have any sources that actually talked about what sort of things were housed at the library prior to the destruction , or is everything mostly speculation ? 
  alternatively , lots of city states too, 
   even achilles was only as strong as his heel, 
  also, 
   cry havoc , said he who fought chaos with chaos , and let slip the dogs of war, 
  even though the last one does n't really count , since he 's sort of quoting shakespeare, 
  well then we should be glad it 's demilitarised, 
  yeah , it works with all relevant maps in ynaemp, 
  i 'm sick of john , but david is n't much better . 
  i wonder how bad things would get if russel was pm ? 
  i am , this is the first i 've ever heard of it, 
  source : new zealander, 
  inner mongolia is still part of china, 
  what on earth gave you that idea, 
  sometimes they do n't copy over properly from the steam folder to the mods folder , might still be in there, 
  but he also used an aussie term one time, 
  new zealand here !, 
  could be that steam has n't copied it over . 
  have a fish around in this location , should be in here somewhere :, 
  c : \\ program files ( x86 ) \\ steam \\ userdata \\ 70305409 \\ ugc, 
  copy it to my documents / my games / sid meier 's civilization v / mods and it should show up, 
  one does not simply fly into mordor, 
  security, 
  at least iceland has its shit together, 
  that actually happens , except with the ground crew workers instead of the all blacks . 
  i seem to remember a video of the air nz ground crew performing a haka to welcome one of the planes to auckland a while back, 
  damn , you did way better with this than i did , glad you posted it separately !, 
  it 's nothing compared to / u/way _ fairer, 
  you have much more patience than i would have had in the same situation , sounds like the second title is pretty relevant . 
  best of luck with the department of labour thing ... 
  you do n't * have * to micro-manage it ... 
  do us down-underites get one for our tuesday night too ? 
  it 's almost 9 here , so depends on your definition .
