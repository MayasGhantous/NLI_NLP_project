  you die if you hit one of them, 
  yeah , i think articles like this about the coverage of politics are fine , it 's when it becomes directly political that it should n't be allowed, 
  i 'd say it 's a case of better safe than sorry . 
  the article mentions he 's going down to scope out the mood first , and if the protective gear is unwarranted then he 's not going to take it out of his bag . 
  but i 'd far rather take it and not need it than not take it and need it . 
  might pay to sticky this on future political articles, 
  i would n't say tear gas or throwing stones is too far outside the realm of possibility , we 've seen it before in this political cycle so far . 
  the vest might be a tad over the top , but i still would n't be surprised if it were needed, 
  sounds more like a courierpost issue than a mightyape issue - admittedly i have n't bought anything from them for a while , but whenever i do it 's pretty much always there the next morning, 
  which part of its location makes it more strategically important ? 
  ( not saying it is n't , just what part is important to nato ) if it 's the proximity to the middle east then supporting an independent kurdistan could easily obtain the same goal , though if it 's control of the bosporus then i can see how they 'd need to keep turkey onside . 
  unless of course they go back to post ww1 and internationalise istanbul , which is about as likely as erdogan stepping down, 
  could always start off with iraq / syria and then look at expanding into turkey if relations deteriorate from there, 
  you 'll be fine - just make sure you make the most of it . 
  i 'm in my last semester having been to only three events - one of which was by accident . 
  kind of feels like i 've missed out, 
  when they took my wisdom teeth out , one of them was longer than usual and so the root was too close to the nerve . 
  since they risked nerve damage and permanent numbness in the mouth by removing it , they just chopped it in half instead . 
  will likely have to go back at some point to get it out , but i 'd far rather that than not being able to eat, 
  gorgeous day down in chch, 
  reminds me of one of [ the best parts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ltwbdqhdhu ) of the top gear africa special, 
  would n't everyone from europe trying to log on have the same end effect and look similar ? 
  * this is not available in your country *, 
  yeah , i 'm in new zealand , which will probably be why, 
  my gp is a scottish guy . 
  i need to actively stop myself from slipping into a scottish accent when i go to the doctor, 
  fuck , 350 % above value . 
  i 'd take the offer / u/logantauranga , though be sure to check he 's from this era, 
  there would n't have been such a reaction in the first place if the volcano had n't exploded and created a channel for the water to enter through, 
  oh shit , they 've got anti-flouridation right below that too . 
  going all out , i see . 
  and then there 's this gem :, 
   zealandia is a center for the dispensation of eco-totalitarian dogma which engages in the indoctrination of children to the eco-totalitarian mindset . 
  literally plying the children with candy while they program them with the lies of eco-extremism . 
  given how different this is from latest polls , i 'm inclined to believe it 's an outlier . 
  if more polls confirm this then it 's definitely a surprise and the opposite of what i 'd have expected given the current situation for sure, 
  when was it said that there would be four locked ? 
  i 'd say the biggest obstacle would be russia wanting to secure an eastern european , given they can veto, 
  stay away from the montieths ginger beer , that shit is horrid, 
  boundary road is great , their cider is pretty decent too, 
  i mean , i prefer moa cider , but boundary road is still a good choice, 
  nope , not me . 
  private tenancy as in living on your own or as in going flatting ? 
  holy shit , you 're alive . 
  any plans to return ? 
  ^ ^ ^ oh ^ ^ ^ who ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ kidding, 
  hell , i have n't even touched the sides of my 2tb drive yet . 
  maybe i need to figure out this downloading thing, 
   6 months, 
   next year, 
  holy shit, 
  figured as much . 
  i 'm wanting to ( finally ) move out at the end of the year too , it 's all so daunting once you start looking at it . 
  even just finding people is a mission, 
  shit , i need to figure out what the hell i 'm doing next year then, 
  eh , there 's a ton of flats just as close , and you could just tell your mum to get stuffed . 
  i 've just started rewatching the whole thing , i forgot how amazing it was . 
  already up to season 4, 
  yo , looks like you 're shadowbanned . 
  should hit the admins up to find out why, 
  that figure has to exclude the property assets . 
  i 'd imagine the chch cathedral land would be worth more than that alone, 
  did you not realise tibet was originally in latvia ? 
  all that time playing cricket under the caribbean sun , it was awesome, 
  huh , til . 
  pretty sure they 're still one of the biggest landowners in the city though, 
   so , he kidnaps felicity and oliver has to go on a quest to reclaim his true love or some shite , then, 
  * season 6 : felicity is in another castle !, 
  the rise in the opposition was based on about three or four polls showing good numbers for the left . 
  this is just one poll showing the opposite of the current trend , so it 's an outlier until more polls confirm it - like the first poll favouring the left was, 
  best place to look is probably [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_next_new_zealand_general_election ) - long term seems to be reasonably stable , but if you look at the most recent polls they 've been showing a slight decline for national and a rise in other parties , up until the most recent poll . 
  here 's the last five or so for the major parties :, 
  opinion poll | national | labour | greens | nz first | balance of power *, 
  roy morgan 17/04 | 42.5 ( -7.5 ) | 26.0 ( -2 ) | 14.5 ( +4.5 ) | 12.5 ( +3.5 ) | -2 ( +10 ), 
  roy morgan 15/05 | 45.5 ( +3 ) | 29.5 ( +3.5 ) | 12.0 ( -2.5 ) | 9.5 ( -3 ) | -4 ( -2 ), 
  reid research 24/05 | 47.0 ( +1.5 ) | 31.3 ( +1.8 ) | 11.1 ( -0.9 ) | 7.8 ( -1.7 ) | -4.6 ( -0.6 ), 
  roy morgan 12/06 | 43.5 ( -4.5 ) | 28.0 ( -1 ) | 14.5 ( +2.5 ) | 9.0 ( n/c ) | -1 ( +6 ), 
  roy morgan 17/07 | 53.0 ( +9.5 ) | 25.5 ( -2.5 ) | 11.5 ( -3 ) | 7.0 ( -2 ) | ** -16 ( -15 ) **, 
  \\* balance of power is the difference between national and a labour/greens coalition - a positive number is labour / greens ahead , while a negative number is national ahead . 
  in all the above polls except the most recent one , nz first would hold the balance of power . 
  ( full disclosure , i have no idea if what i 've done re . 
  the balance of power makes any sense whatsoever when translated to actual seats ), 
  okay , so i may have misremembered the polls and overestimated the level of recovery on the part of the left . 
  national has slowly been pulling away ( somehow ) over the past couple months , but the important bit is that it 's still not enough to govern alone until the most recent poll . 
  if anything , i think what the polls show is that roy morgan is prone to huge swings in results , so on its own the result does n't mean all that much . 
  removed , rule 6 and rule 8 . 
  what if you met in politics class ? 
  feel free to [ message the mods ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fnewzealand ) if you think i 've made a wrong call , but the rules are pretty clear, 
  in that case , send a modmail and get the other mods to weigh in, 
  we would n't need to if / u/weathermannz came back for good, 
  for world war one , sure . 
  but you could make a fairly good argument that the lack of involvement from the us in the league of nations and retreat to isolationism during the interwar years meant that there was a lack of institutions which were able to counteract aggressive actions which led to ww2 . 
  italy would have failed miserably if sanctions had been imposed against it over the invasion of abyssinia , while actions against germany instead of appeasement would have been much more one-sided than waiting for the invasion of poland , once germany had well and truly recovered from versailles . 
  holy shit , you 're the guy that wrote ted from accounting !, 
  removed , rule 8, 
  removed , rule 5 . 
  i 'd be happy if they bowled it and made more carparking , bush inn is a nightmare to find a park during the dinner rush, 
  plus carparking would prevent it from being used for a competitor, 
  removed , rule 8 .
