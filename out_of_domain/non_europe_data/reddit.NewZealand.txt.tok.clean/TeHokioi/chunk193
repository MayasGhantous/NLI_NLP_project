  okay , that sounds good ( and saves me some money , thankfully ) , cheers, 
  i 've got the intel i5-4670 haswell @ 3.4 ghz at the moment, 
  you 've got to start with hello . 
  it 's so great having people to talk to and just vent about life with , i barely ever talk to people in real life beyond just standard talking shit , aside from the occasional deep convo . 
  people do n't normally give a shit, 
  i 'm in the same boat . 
  really regretting some of my decisions , as i feel like i have n't done any of the typical uni life or got the value out of it . 
  thinking of moving out this year and doing honours just to delay the inevitable and give me a chance to do normal uni shit, 
  yeah , thinking i 'll just stick to the ram and graphics card at this point . 
  can always update the rest when better tech shows up . 
  cheers for all your help !, 
  i 'm cautiously optimistic about nms . 
  it reminds me an awful lot of spore , which looked amazing but turned out to be a bit of a let down after a while . 
  plus no-one is sure whether it 's full steam ahead on the hype train or hard on the breaks , based on the leaked video reports, 
  we 've got no idea - leaked version had quite a few bugs from the sound of things , but there 's speculation it was a pre-final version as some of the bugs have been reported as being fixed based on previews, 
  i 've got a mate that went there and absolutely loved it from the sound of things . 
  could hit him up for a couple questions if you had any specific things you wanted to know, 
  awesome , cheers !, 
  i 'd throw in [ whatever by the beths ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtqx7rwtr8a ) and something by kaleo , probably [ broken bones ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noletmmi0b4 ), 
  reminds me a bit of fat freddy 's drop, 
  i need to get onto that too . 
  it 's kind of terrifying, 
  that 's saying the least, 
  pretty sure it 's all in the past now ( as far as i know , at least ) but yeah , what you said . 
  which is why i said it was all in the past . 
  flatting together would probably still be a bit odd though, 
  see i 'm in two minds about the snow . 
  on one hand having it snow would be awesome , but on the other it 'd mean i ca n't go to class and keep chatting up the girl i 've got a thing for, 
  what sort of garage only has one door and no way of opening that door from the outside ? 
  hah , she 's so far out of my league it 's not even funny, 
  now i know how you managed to get lucy, 
  i saw one at work the other day that was i11i1 or something , reminded me of [ this xkcd ] ( https://xkcd.com/1105/ ), 
  have * based on a true story * in big letters at the start ? 
  okay yeah , sorry about that . 
  i mean , in my defence i did n't start it , but probably accidentally fanned the flames a tad . 
  past is the past and all that shit . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ( this ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ what ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ happens ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ when ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ figure ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ shit ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ out ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ though ), 
  i love making random music discoveries . 
  this week alone , i 've found a sort of new 80 's alt mixed with retro surf rock album , a bunch of cursed mummies making funk music , and found out that the lead singer of midnight youth did his own pretty cool solo album . 
  but it turns out you 're cheating on her with her , which somehow makes everything okay and turns it back into a love song or something, 
  kind of like hey ya , then ? 
  i 'm sure fish and chips can be healthy if it 's cooked right , though i think at that point it does n't count as fish and chips . 
  especially if you ca n't read the packaging as your news source, 
  figured it was going to be that one , they have some pretty cool shit, 
  would n't it defeat the purpose if you both knew about it in advance ? 
  oh nah , all of that was put out in the last couple years . 
  definitely need to expand my catalogue of older stuff though , but there 's so much i have no idea where to start, 
  i thought you did n't want it brought up in public again ? 
  i need to give mine a clean , but each time i do the next day it 's dusty again . 
  joys of living in a massive construction site with a pollen-drenched prevailing wind, 
  i was just meaning that after a while of not talking to someone you 're not quite sure what the state of affairs there is . 
  did n't have any animosity or double meaning behind it or w/e, 
  [ here come the mummies ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryqhbacse50 ) , with quite possibly the best [ last.fm biography ] ( http://www.last.fm/music/here+come+the+mummies/+wiki ) i 've read, 
  there are n't even 58 city states in vanilla i think , plus there 's a hard set limit of civs + cs + barbs = 64 , so the more civs means the less city states, 
  i 'd love to get the wiki set up with all that info , if people wanted to help out . 
  that way we can just point people there, 
  we should be able to change that in the settings , but i 'd still want to have some sort of limitation on who can edit it . 
  maybe approved submitters , or even using / r/nzcss or something . 
  edit : okay , looks like each page can have approved submitters added . 
  so if you wanted to cover some stuff let me know what and i 'll get it set up, 
  that 's including the caribbean / central america though , if you 're just doing `` north america '' then there 's three . 
  technically nan madol is micronesian , not polynesian . 
  definitely room for both , and personally i 'd much rather see them go the iroquois route and do one specific polynesian civ , even if it does mean less representation overall . 
  seriously ? 
  well no , the caribbean and central america are both often counted as their own regions . 
  it 's not like i 'm saying to forget about canada or whatever, 
  removed , rule 9, 
  i think that 's a given with the chocolate festival , though the desert road is pretty cool too, 
  it 's tough being a hurricanes fan in chch at the moment , mates were n't too happy with me the other weekend, 
  state highway 87 maybe ? 
  looks like there may be some closures up that way too , old dunstan road and three mile hill . 
  was looking to see if there was a way around sh1 since it 's just the bit up to waitati , mt cargill road is closed too but there may be a couple roads there too that could work - do n't know the area well enough to be certain though, 
  friday drunk shitposting goes here, 
  so the question is whether ilam will be a safe national seat or whether people just vote for brownlee because they recognise the name . 
  so , use whatever currency you want , so long as it 's not our one ? 
  i think it 's a similar thing to people who complain about feminists - they do n't mean normal , garden variety people who want equality / equity or whatever , they complain about the people who jump off the deep end and go all ` men are pigs ' or ` you 're oppressing me just by existing ' or so on . 
  is there a map of the route somewhere ? 
  trying to figure out what the plan is, 
  i still maintain opposal is a word , even though everything tells me it is n't, 
  should get a sodastream , heston whatshisname uses it to make cheap champagne, 
  just keep eating them , say you 're in the process of putting them away, 
  that 's probably because apparently it is n't a word . 
  i just think it sounds like one and that it should be one, 
  we 've got one , it saves a fair bit on the mixers too ( ~ $ 8 for a bottle of syrup makes about 12-15 bottles at least ), 
  removed , rule 6 . 
  removed , rule 8 . 
  97 % hillary clinton, 
  95 % jill stein, 
  68 % gary johnson, 
  good to hear !, 
  sh1 opened then ? 
  you 'd be getting roughly 3l free , though that can vary based on how much syrup you put in, 
  i mean , it 's something that definitely should n't be on , but there 's not really anything in the rules against it . 
  it 's one of the issues i 've got with the current ruleset , and might be worth imo adding something along the lines of overtly racist / sexist / discriminatory comments not being allowed . 
  i 'd be interested to know the psychology behind how polls affect voting . 
  i would have thought showing a false lead would be counterproductive , as it 'd make hillary supporters complacent and not as likely to vote than if it were a close race, 
  we definitely need to do something about it though . 
  that stripper thing brought out the worst in a lot of people , and since growing more the number of comments along that vein has risen as well . 
  works until you get one of the fucking stupid ones where it only handles one letter , and you end up selecting wallis and futuna, 
  i thought it did n't hold up in court because the evidence was obtained illegally ?
