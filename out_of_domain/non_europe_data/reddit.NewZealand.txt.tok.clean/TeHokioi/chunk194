  i hear they 're freaking out in auckland because it got down to 7 degrees overnight, 
  highlight for today would have to be talking to and serving a 95 year old who served as a tail gunner in the air force over europe in ww2, 
  as another pretty big u2 fan and mod of / r/u2band , i 'd have to say my other big favourite band at the moment is kaleo , while a fair chunk of my music collection is the black keys , muse , or pre-mylo xyloto coldplay . 
  i 've also got a bunch of bands which i 've got all of their stuff , because they 've only released one or two eps , and a ton of kiwi stuff because it 's my patriotic duty as a kiwi to have at least slice of heaven . 
  i love how evocative some of their songs are , even if you 're only just discovering them . 
  i heard * [ a sort of homecoming ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnemitpip8i ) * for the first time only about a month ago and it straight away evoked a similar sort of feeling to where the streets have no name that 's almost impossible to describe, 
  shit , i thought my photos from japan a couple years back were bad , but apparently i only took 2,600 . 
  i love going up the summit road , especially when there 's those big cumulus clouds dotted all over the plains . 
  it 's a great road to drive on , too, 
  summit road most likely , turn right at the top of dyers pass, 
  can you send him my way ? 
  i need a new windscreen, 
  i assumed all of the bad news about the events was a ruse to get everyone else freaked out , allowing the brazilians to get a record medal haul, 
  welcome to the world of ` what is a country ' , where the correct answer is no-one knows . 
  depending on who you ask , there 's anywhere from ~ 190 to ~ 210 countries , and kosovo is one of those ones in the grey area . 
  as far as kosovo goes , it 's currently recognised by [ 113 countries , and 109 out of 193 un member states ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/countriesrecognizingkosovo.png ) ( green ones recognise it ) . 
  those that do n't recognise it tend to say it 's part of serbia , with varying levels of autonomy . 
  the ioc has different recognition criteria than the un and other international organisations , so even though it 's status as a fully-fledged country is n't quite clear , it 's able to take part in olympics . 
  similar to taiwan , who can compete as chinese taipei . 
  removed , rules 6 and 8, 
  care to elaborate your explanation for that ? 
  whenever i take that one , i 'm normally well into the negatives of both categories . 
  best place to start is probably the [ great new zealand songbook ] ( https://play.spotify.com/album/6cxkcf6dshgjml37tp6pa8 ) , a compilation album put together with most of the best and iconic kiwi songs . 
  it 's got a mix of pretty much everything , so there should be something for everyone in there hopefully . 
  as far as more specific stuff goes , one of the main parts of our music scene is a sort of [ nz reggae / roots / dub type thing ] ( https://play.spotify.com/user/spotifyaustralia/playlist/3qkhcoyxlwupsusvha5rko ) , which can often also include elements of funk , r&b , soul , and so on . 
  main bands in this sort of genre are [ fat freddy 's drop ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/32lo0j8u6kzjtwboibrdys ) , [ the black seeds ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/0q35wrrhdsu8ebsj1eoucy ) , [ sola rosa ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/5ippraque7rqde9ymckj52 ) , [ fly my pretties ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/2jfutar95bbf8unitqnwgl ) , and [ katchafire ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/786hgmaexhuecdkpaj3jia ) , though there are a fair few more that i did n't mention there . 
  [ herbs ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/6gib5jecf3u9jjuo2of2ba ) deserves a special mention , they were one of the earliest in this genre and incorporated maori elements as well as some iconic protest songs relating to nuclear testing in the south pacific , which was a huge issue in nz during the 70 's and 80 's . 
  starting back in the 80 's , we also got the emergence of a unique indie pop / post-punk culture known as dunedin sound coming out of dunedin ( a big student town , which also influenced the music of this type . 
  [ this playlist ] ( https://play.spotify.com/user/thesoundsofspotify/playlist/3unp96l8dn4aorpskgxoqo ) has a fair bit of it , alongside more modern examples of nz indie music . 
  most of this scene was championed by the independent label [ flying nun records ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/flyingnunrecords/videos ) , with the arguably best known song coming out of that label being chris knox 's [ not given lightly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nasv0yml8jk ) , though there are a fair few earlier songs that could challenge that title . 
  then there are the bands from the big names in kiwi music - normally ones from the finn brothers which the aussies try to claim as their own , though in reality it 's more of a shared custody type thing for some . 
  this started off with [ split enz ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/0upmz8qvulakkafrljywtl ) in the 70 's , and led to [ crowded house ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/7ohlpa8drbtcf92zazcaab ) in the 80 's and 90 's . 
  [ dragon ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/622hmyoaiqowumcd5t3b7t ) is another one that 's split between the two countries , and one who has a fair few of the big classic kiwi songs in their books . 
  the main other name that 's been in nz music throughout the last 40 years has been dave dobbyn , again starting in the 70 's with [ th ' dudes ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/1xgtztskpmwowfzujsm7ch ) ( spotify does n't have much of their stuff , ) then getting even bigger with [ dd smash ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/0rksymwfvvu71d3k8skwp8 ) in the early 80 's , after which he launched his on [ solo career ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/5byfbdxamvcxet7hoavewc ) with nearly every album having an iconic kiwi song on it . 
  he did the soundtrack for an [ integral film ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/footrot_flats:_the_dog%27s_tale ) in kiwi culture , and his song loyal was used as an anthem during the 2003 america 's cup , where new zealand was defending against the swiss . 
  [ shihad ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/3hmmt81w29ljsknjl1iy1s ) are another one of the big kiwi bands which have had decent success overseas ( for a kiwi band ) , they 're a fair bit heavier than most of the other stuff in this post . 
  beyond that , we 've also got a fair few reasonably popular more modern artists . 
  [ the phoenix foundation ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/0rus0e2zrky6t4e5iyfnsa ) , [ the naked and famous ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/0oeupvxwsc8bws6snpu8b9 ) , [ kids of 88 ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/4xldu2aql3ofnd27imcnqy ) , [ six60 ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/1caobfxjrbkcwiatzgkyhn ) , [ shapeshifter ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/4whp3jswwaitn36r9d4zlf ) , and of course [ lorde ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/163tk9wjr9p9dmm0avk7lm ) are all fairly big , and across a decent number of genres - shapeshifter is drum and bass , phoenix foundation is indie , while six60 has a tinge of nz reggae . 
  there 's a couple more smaller bands that i like , but that should hopefully be enough to get you started . 
  if you like any type in particular let me know and i can find some more like it for you . 
  i also did a [ nz music month daily post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/37vlql/patea_maori_club_poi_e_nz_music_month_day_31/crq5g41 ) on / r/newzealand last year , featuring a different artist every day . 
  to top it off though , here 's a couple of songs you ca n't miss when talking about nz music :, 
  [ flight of the conchords and a nz music supergroup charity single ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py_30jzguyk ), 
  [ poi e - no further explanation necessary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqluygs0iaq ), 
  but it does show that the massive poll change from the latest roy morgan one was an outlier and not part of a trend , which is the important thing here . 
  / u/flyingkiwi9 - to continue our talk on polls from a couple weeks ago , might have been a bit premature in calling a decline, 
  is that due to winnie being involved though , or due to them having a narrow enough margin that they need to have him included ? 
  i think winnie would n't want to give john another term . 
  maybe he takes a stab for the big job ? 
  it has an effect to the extent of national 's coalition partners - peter dunne being out would mean they lose a seat in effect, 
  south america or southern ( united states of ) america ? 
   one of the things i really wan na do is road trip through the south island , it might be next on my list . 
  hit me up if you want help with a route map , i 've done road trips around the south nearly every year since i was a kid, 
   i do wonder what the fuck the settlers of wellington were thinking though , who in their right mind would build a city here ?!, 
  massive natural harbour in the age of sail was too good to pass up . 
  add a continent where the chathams are going south and you could easily have yourselves another singapore there . 
  plus it did n't look like it does now , most of the cbd ( between lambton quay and the harbour ) was underwater before an earthquake in the 19th century, 
  shelter from the wind in an early settlement , part of what made wellington harbour even better, 
  oh fuck , that sounds so cool . 
  i 've wanted to drive the panamerican highway for years , plus from what i 've seen the road looks bloody amazing down the pacific coast, 
  as a kiwi , i would love free movement with canada . 
  you lot are awesome , i 'd love to come and visit canada and it 'd be cool having more of you coming over here to say hi . 
  not so sure about the uk given their rise in intolerance, 
  does buying at gog still give a steam key ? 
  it 's like $ 20 cheaper there than anywhere else for me , but it says drm free and i 'd prefer to have it hooked up to steam . 
  yeah , i figured as much . 
  just wanted to hear his justification so i have something to refute, 
  i 've still got to wait three days for the pc release , tell me if it 's worth buying !, 
  the canada strategy , i can go with that . 
  their turnaround in the women 's games against gb was amazing, 
  i was able to watch some episodes when i was a kid ( from about 7-8 years old probably ) but it was always with parental supervision , and normally they 'd change the channel as soon as itchy and scratchy came on or there was an off-colour joke . 
  can confirm , i already have . 
  though i have n't had a chance to update it to bnw yet ~ ~ because i 'm fucking lazy ~ ~, 
  we get them a fair bit in new zealand , which is in the mid 40 's . 
  generally has to be upwards of a 6 or so to have any chance of seeing it where i am though, 
  it 's a weird experience , is n't it ? 
  i saw the aurora about half an hour out of christchurch a couple months ago , and it sort of just looked like a big cloudbank on the horizon which was moving a fair bit . 
  thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, 
  yeah , we did n't realise fully until the long exposure shots came out . 
  there was a flash of red across the sky at one point which we saw , but the colours were fairly dull otherwise, 
  happened with someone last time , too, 
  just finished eating a nice homemade rogan josh . 
  messed up the sauce to rice ratio a bit ( rice did n't get all the flavour through it ) but not bad for a guy who can barely cook, 
  i kind of feel like that 's got the same root word as * cohort *, 
  we were talking about learning other languages the other day at work , one guy said he only knew swearwords and another girl only knew please , thank you , and butterfly . 
  determined there were two types of people, 
  find some aquarius in a vending machine , it 's great to help with the heat and humidity . 
  i downed so much of that stuff while i was over there it 's not funny . 
  there 's also these little pre-made pancake sandwiches in some convenience stores with maple syrup or something in them , they make a fantastic snack food / breakfast warm or cold . 
  i remember running into ma'a nonu down at lyall bay one time as a kid . 
  he gave us advice on bodyboarding , which was kind of cool . 
  i hate driving behind flash cars - i mean , i love looking at them , but i 'm always paranoid the breaks are gon na fail . 
  was behind a real old e-type the other day which was bloody awesome, 
  even do all the spices ourselves , it 's great . 
  lets you customise the flavour to your own tastes ( case in point , adding more spice to butter chicken ), 
  yeah , the canes are pretty cool guys . 
  a couple used to come out to my primary school every year too , they 'd tell us that reading is cool and then come and play rugby with everyone at lunch . 
  i think the advice was pretty solid , got a couple decent runs in after, 
  would n't it make more sense to use one of the south pacific tsl maps instead of the whole world one ? 
  also disappointed you went with seddon instead of savage for nz , but ah well,
