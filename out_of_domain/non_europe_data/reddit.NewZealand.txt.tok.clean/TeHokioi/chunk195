  i 'm considering it , but i 'm still not 100 % sure . 
  was stung with spore last time , and some of what i 've heard makes me worried , especially given the $ 90 price tag . 
  still need to upgrade my pc anyway first, 
  kosovo 's already got us beaten on that , 1 medal for all 1.5 million of them, 
  that happened last time with henry viii , firaxis had to come in and tell people it was a fake, 
  i 'd probably buy that if it came with a steam version, 
   i am concerned however that he 's perhaps a little low on charisma , which means some dumb sheeple wo n't vote for him, 
  everything i 've heard from people who have met him say he 's the complete opposite and is a really likeable guy , but for some reason that does n't come across when he 's on telly, 
  the psych one was fantastic , hoping under central city skies will be just as good, 
  torture does seem to be their mo, 
  i love it when everyone else is reporting crashes and terrible performance on a game and you get no issues on your mid-spec machine . 
  no man 's sky is pretty cool , though it takes some getting used to the controls and you 're slow as fuck when walking around . 
  i 'm the same , no issues for me but it definitely needs work, 
  removed , rule 8, 
  could do it like spore and have you download modded content on the fly ? 
  can confirm, 
  will change it after the midterms i 've got today . 
  any preferences for who to put up ? 
  where 's / u/your _ post_as_a_movie when you need him ? 
  the main reason is that our birth rate is so low that it 's unsustainable as a country , and we 'd quickly start to decline in size if we did n't have immigration as deaths will outpace births . 
  and since we 've got a large aging population we need more money to fund superannuation . 
  most of the issues stem back to the baby boomers , with stuff like economy growth etc. 
  needed to offset their impact . 
  i can go one better - / u/kthulhu42 , would you mind if i included one of the images in the header rotation ? 
  umm , no , this is an entirely different issue and it 's one which is observed across all nations at a similar development level to us . 
  japan 's currently in crisis over it, 
  not a fan of the huge bass , but hopefully that 's just a mixing thing, 
  was n't advocating it , just trying to explain the rationale behind what they 're doing . 
  added one to the rotation , might need to refresh a few times but it 's up there . 
  so sorry to hear about your loss, 
  finally got around to adding new header images - only authors i remember are / u/ekanttakephotos and / u/appexxd _ but the total number has doubled , so there will be more than just that, 
  awesome !, 
  was talking to a girl in my class the other day who had done internships in dubai and stuff , definitely made me feel a bit one-upped, 
   who 's colin craig, 
  oh boy are you in for a fun read, 
  gets even better when you sync it up to stayin ' alive, 
  host servers in nz , give the rest of the world latency !, 
  normally it 's a bird or something and you need to sit there with the bloody mining beam trying to shoot it out of the sky in order to scan it, 
  you do n't need to do anything to keep them , it asks if you want to upload or delete . 
  if you just close the window they stay in the files, 
  i did , then after like 10 minutes got so pissed off i just started shooting at the bloody thing . 
  after running from the sentinels i figured i 'd see if the dead body scanned , and sure enough it did, 
  yeah , the recoil makes it a bit tougher when it 's far away though, 
  is there somewhere with a list of these guides ? 
  could be worth setting up the wiki for them, 
  i 'm from what i would probably say is slightly on the upper side of middle class , and there is no way i would have been able to go to uni if not for a student loan . 
  parents could n't pay for it , and while they have helped by letting me stay at home rent free while i 'm studying i absolutely would n't have been able to go to uni without the loan . 
  and that 's with working as well, 
  i love that song so much . 
  it was one of the best moments in top gear 's [ africa special ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ltwbdqhdhu ), 
  i thought yesterday they were saying we could n't afford to be offering interest free loans , now they 're saying we can afford super ? 
  seems like a fairly clear target audience, 
  i 've found that quite often there will be flying animals , which you may not see because you 're looking for something running around . 
  they 're usually too far out of range so you need to shoot it out of the sky though, 
  i think my original start point was a giant thing of gold , but i did n't realise i could mine it until after i 'd left . 
  i 've had a couple which were big pillars that went underground as well and made craters too, 
  there 's a mod to remove the vignette and visor effects somewhere , ca n't remember where though, 
  it 's only just come out , and i probably would n't say it 's the * most * retrofuturistic game , but i 'm getting serious retrofuturism vibes from no man 's sky right now . 
  they 've got full on 60 's style spaceports on planets and have taken huge inspiration from 70 's sci-fi, 
  new accounts are n't counted as subscriptions until they unsubscribe from somewhere else . 
  so all i take from that is that we 're slightly less worse than / r/funny or / r/politics, 
  was hoping to be enjoying a nice drink with the girl from politics tonight , but then she was one of the 3/4 of class that decided not to show up today . 
  so it 's just me with some moa cider checking out a uni food market, 
  oh cool , did n't realise there were any still with the old livery . 
  that brings back memories, 
  come on now , i 'm hardly going to say that right after i mention i was about to ask someone in class out , am i ? 
  yeah , and it was the last day of term with the midterm having already been taken . 
  not sure why i even went tbh, 
  actually no , i went there to ask her out , which kind of did n't work when she was n't there . 
  at least there 's a second term, 
  that 's what i get for checking my user page i suppose . 
  the answer , mysterious stranger who i 'm guessing is the headphone guy browsing / r/nomansskythegame , is that i do n't really . 
  but i can barely decipher it at the best of times , so i rely on lecture notes and the reading , then hope for the best . 
  wrong class than the rest of this discussion though, 
  i wrote a [ fairly big post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/4wi6ov/discussion_name_a_song_thats_at_least_20_years/d68ndwv ) on / r/listentothis on kiwi music , will repost it here for ease too . 
  might help , and i 'm sure people will point out gaps and where i 've gone wrong . 
   best place to start is probably the [ great new zealand songbook ] ( https://play.spotify.com/album/6cxkcf6dshgjml37tp6pa8 ) , a compilation album put together with most of the best and iconic kiwi songs . 
  it 's got a mix of pretty much everything , so there should be something for everyone in there hopefully . 
   as far as more specific stuff goes , one of the main parts of our music scene is a sort of [ nz reggae / roots / dub type thing ] ( https://play.spotify.com/user/spotifyaustralia/playlist/3qkhcoyxlwupsusvha5rko ) , which can often also include elements of funk , r&b , soul , and so on . 
  main bands in this sort of genre are [ fat freddy 's drop ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/32lo0j8u6kzjtwboibrdys ) , [ the black seeds ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/0q35wrrhdsu8ebsj1eoucy ) , [ sola rosa ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/5ippraque7rqde9ymckj52 ) , [ fly my pretties ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/2jfutar95bbf8unitqnwgl ) , and [ katchafire ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/786hgmaexhuecdkpaj3jia ) , though there are a fair few more that i did n't mention there . 
  [ herbs ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/6gib5jecf3u9jjuo2of2ba ) deserves a special mention , they were one of the earliest in this genre and incorporated maori elements as well as some iconic protest songs relating to nuclear testing in the south pacific , which was a huge issue in nz during the 70 's and 80 's . 
   starting back in the 80 's , we also got the emergence of a unique indie pop / post-punk culture known as dunedin sound coming out of dunedin ( a big student town , which also influenced the music of this type . 
  [ this playlist ] ( https://play.spotify.com/user/thesoundsofspotify/playlist/3unp96l8dn4aorpskgxoqo ) has a fair bit of it , alongside more modern examples of nz indie music . 
  most of this scene was championed by the independent label [ flying nun records ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/flyingnunrecords/videos ) , with the arguably best known song coming out of that label being chris knox 's [ not given lightly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nasv0yml8jk ) , though there are a fair few earlier songs that could challenge that title . 
   then there are the bands from the big names in kiwi music - normally ones from the finn brothers which the aussies try to claim as their own , though in reality it 's more of a shared custody type thing for some . 
  this started off with [ split enz ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/0upmz8qvulakkafrljywtl ) in the 70 's , and led to [ crowded house ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/7ohlpa8drbtcf92zazcaab ) in the 80 's and 90 's . 
  [ dragon ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/622hmyoaiqowumcd5t3b7t ) is another one that 's split between the two countries , and one who has a fair few of the big classic kiwi songs in their books . 
  the main other name that 's been in nz music throughout the last 40 years has been dave dobbyn , again starting in the 70 's with [ th ' dudes ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/1xgtztskpmwowfzujsm7ch ) ( spotify does n't have much of their stuff , ) then getting even bigger with [ dd smash ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/0rksymwfvvu71d3k8skwp8 ) in the early 80 's , after which he launched his on [ solo career ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/5byfbdxamvcxet7hoavewc ) with nearly every album having an iconic kiwi song on it . 
  he did the soundtrack for an [ integral film ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/footrot_flats:_the_dog%27s_tale ) in kiwi culture , and his song loyal was used as an anthem during the 2003 america 's cup , where new zealand was defending against the swiss . 
  [ shihad ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/3hmmt81w29ljsknjl1iy1s ) are another one of the big kiwi bands which have had decent success overseas ( for a kiwi band ) , they 're a fair bit heavier than most of the other stuff in this post . 
   beyond that , we 've also got a fair few reasonably popular more modern artists . 
  [ the phoenix foundation ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/0rus0e2zrky6t4e5iyfnsa ) , [ the naked and famous ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/0oeupvxwsc8bws6snpu8b9 ) , [ kids of 88 ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/4xldu2aql3ofnd27imcnqy ) , [ six60 ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/1caobfxjrbkcwiatzgkyhn ) , [ shapeshifter ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/4whp3jswwaitn36r9d4zlf ) , and of course [ lorde ] ( https://play.spotify.com/artist/163tk9wjr9p9dmm0avk7lm ) are all fairly big , and across a decent number of genres - shapeshifter is drum and bass , phoenix foundation is indie , while six60 has a tinge of nz reggae . 
   there 's a couple more smaller bands that i like , but that should hopefully be enough to get you started . 
  if you like any type in particular let me know and i can find some more like it for you . 
  i also did a [ nz music month daily post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/37vlql/patea_maori_club_poi_e_nz_music_month_day_31/crq5g41 ) on / r/newzealand last year , featuring a different artist every day . 
  to top it off though , here 's a couple of songs you ca n't miss when talking about nz music :, 
   [ flight of the conchords and a nz music supergroup charity single ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py_30jzguyk ), 
   [ poi e - no further explanation necessary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqluygs0iaq ), 
  should be a mod , i 've been called any variety of green party / national party / chinese / mossad shills for ages now . 
  i met a couple guys while working at the open day for my uni last year that played football with the son of my primary school principal , in a completely different city .
