  i think 2 degrees ' marketing campaign about two degrees of separation might not have been far off for nz, 
  should have said you were a redditor , stuff already has an intimate relationship with our content, 
  nah , but it was a connection from wellington in christchurch, 
  personally , while i would n't mind putting something in place to stop the no-research posts , i feel like we 're too hostile towards people who have actually done some research and want to get thoughts on specific aspects of their trip as a result,

   i 'm really feeling africa by toto recently . 
  great song , and i 'm not even going to post the top gear clip i 've posted the last couple times it was brought up !, 
  shit , if only you 'd bought it from a guy who could 've got it sent away for repair and given you a cheap price !, 
  in all seriousness , does it happen all the time , or just occasionally ? 
  mum had the same thing happen on her tablet , sending it away fixed it for the most part but it 'll still do it sometimes if it 's under ~ 33 % battery . 
  might be fixable enough to hold together until the new nexus shows up , or at least long enough to wait for a good price on a replacement, 
  removed , rule 5 .

  yeah , so they may say it 's physical damage , but from the sound of things it 's exactly what mum had . 
  they had to do a factory reset on it iirc , but it seems to have cleared it up, 
  except it 's not editorialised . 
  changing the title does n't make it editorialised , adding opinion does, 
  pretty sure they said there was actually something there, 
  i think it comes under rule 0 of not being a dick, 
  mirror ? 
  looks like it 's been taken down, 
  given this is from the sound of it a remix , it may be that the real one has more guitar and less bass , which would make it a really strong track from the sound of things . 
  i 'm cautiously extremely optimistic about this album, 
  there 's an audio file of the whole new year 's eve concert on youtube , which you may be able to download or record the audio from, 
  oh shit , his response to the whale oil brigade is perfect . 
  either way , we 'll be here and keeping a lookout for anything untoward like this, 
  managed to find a link to the remix of the [ new u2 song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-pbtlqusm0 ) before it got removed again , have to say i 'm really liking how this new album is sounding based on what we 've heard so far, 
  i take it you 've already booked flights then ? 
  are they morning and afternoon flights ? 
  either way , the one big alternate route i 'd suggest is to potentially do the west coast instead of up the middle ( if you had n't booked flights you could do [ a round trip ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/fjp9lwcbf632 ) fairly easily . ), 
  you 'd miss out on [ lindis pass ] ( http://c0481729.cdn2.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/p-7100835f-bba1-713f-04e632d0a32af931-3747524.jpg ) and [ mount cook ] ( http://www.namastenewzealand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mount-cook.jpg ) , but beyond that imo the mackenzie country is fairly ordinary . 
  i mean , it 's cool and all , but eh . 
  west coast on the other hand , you 'd get a much better sense of that classic new zealand image . 
  [ haast pass ] ( http://lynx-travel.com/vacations/nz2000/wanaka/gates%20of%20haast%20bridge%20over%20haast%20gorge.jpg ) for one , but also places like [ okarito lagoon ] ( http://farm1.nzstatic.com/_proxy/imageproxy_1y/serve/okarito-lagoon.jpg?height=420&amp;outputformat=jpg&amp;quality=75&amp;source=1331053&amp;transformationsystem=crop&amp;width=960&amp;securitytoken=1673ab41073849480afe1ffe3bcfeff5 ) , [ lake matheson ] ( http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/i0000hee4g2.r4a8/s/1000/ ) and what 's left of the glaciers . 
  the coast is also just pretty awesome in general , much more classic forest and a sense of remoteness instead of just emptiness in the mackenzie country . 
  fuck i was n't even three yet when that came out, 
  if you 've got the spare cash you can get a helicopter / plane flight over to check them all out , but beyond that you can still get some fairly good views of it from the glaciers . 
  is your flight down a morning one ? 
  what time do you get in ? 
  there 's a difference between that and brigading, 
  hah , phone finally carked it did it ? 
  yeah , for sure, 
  hi metiria , thanks for stopping by and doing an ama here !, 
  sorry i was so slack in getting the fancy verified flair gareth has to show up on you as well , should be all good to go now !, 
  as far as questions go , in the last election there were several electorates where the vote total of the green party candidate was greater than the difference between that of the labour and the national candidate , and as a result the split of the vote on the left allowed national to win extra electorate seats . 
  come next year , would the green party consider not standing candidates in electorates where such a contest is likely , and instead encourage voters to support the labour candidate ( either overtly or otherwise ) in an attempt to win such seats back from national ? 
  on another note , the green party ( and the left as a whole ) tends to have a fairly substantial voter base amongst students and young people , however young people are also among those who are least likely to vote . 
  as a political science student at uni i 've seen this apathy first hand , often in the same breath as people disparaging how john key is still in power . 
  how do you think this apathy is able to be overcome , and do you or the greens have any plans to this effect ( short of hiring bernie sanders , of course ), 
  thanks again for doing the ama , and best of luck for the coming year !, 
  as i understand it , i think it 's the bill english types . 
  they were forced out in favour of neoliberal people such as don brash and john key in the mid 2000s , and have been in charge of national ever since . 
  there 's a doco online about it somewhere , i 'll try and track it down for you, 
  awesome , cheers for the response - really glad to have such a decent progressive party in new zealand , hoping you 're able to continue your rise in influence in the future, 
  that 's a fair point about where the support would go , too . 
  i 'd always figured it 'd go mostly to labour due to the greens = left argument , but i suppose there would be people who would vote national but support you instead due to environmentalism and not necessarily the other aspects of your platform . 
  i asked a [ similar question above ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/4zba0v/kia_ora_metiria_here_ama/d6ueqws ) , the basic response was that it 's too early for talk on that and that there 's no guarantee that green voters would go to labour over another party, 
  no , but there is amongst middle new zealand , and they 're the ones who the greens might need to win support from as the left would already likely support them . 
  if you had someone who agrees with all their policies but does n't vote for them because he thinks they 're pot smoking hippies , would n't it be better to try and eliminate that stigma and get the extra votes ? 
  surely that 's a question for winnie ? 
  left my pc to go and have breakfast this morning , come back and it 's gone to sleep , no big deal . 
  does n't wake up when i click the mouse , which has happened a bit since upgrading the graphics card and ram , normally requiring a force reboot . 
  do that , and now it 's stuck in a reboot loop never even getting to the bios , and powering off after a couple seconds . 
  tried swapping out the ram in case having two different types was the issue , no luck . 
  just having to wait until the pc store opens at 10 now, 
  yeah , figured it might be the power supply since i upgraded , though i thought the 1060 used less power than the 660, 
  yeah , unplugged everything except the controls , one monitor and the network , and still had the same issue . 
  let it set for about half a minute , then decided i 'd better let a pro take a look and he seemed fairly stumped . 
  hopefully they 're able to figure it out, 
  update on pc - the bios crashed , took the computer store 6 hours to fix it, 
  yeah , the bios had crashed . 
  the symptom was it not booting up, 
  the odyssey would 've been over a lot quicker if he 'd had a bugatti, 
  nah , asked whether i 'd overclocked the cpu but that was about it, 
  well , there would be proof that jesus as a historical figure existed , but whether he was the son of god or not would still be up for debate . 
  unless of course it was one of the miracles or whatever, 
  definitely scam imo , even though the story is real it does n't mean it 's him behind the account, 
  that 's how it starts though, 
  i had that happen to be a couple years ago , it gets really uncomfortable when they do n't just take no as an answer . 
  though in my case after like a year or so i started sort of talking to her again , until recently when it got mentioned off the cuff and she got shitty at me again . 
  based on experience , there 's a fairly big difference between legally being able to turn down hours and practically being able to turn down hours . 
  sure it was n't to go on strike ? 
  i hear that 's a daily occurrence over there, 
  as a retail worker , i 'll take any government-mandated forced day off i can get, 
  except that 's never how it happens . 
  you 're always forced to work on public holidays , and you ca n't really do jack shit about it short of quitting, 
  quake tonight ? 
  are you some sort of psychic ? 
  there 's a 51st state party here in new zealand too , nobody takes it seriously and it 's normally seen as a joke party in elections, 
  i thought it was all but said outright that it was bleeding gums murphy ? 
  even if only for the uproar from the republicans after holding off someone they kind of liked until after the election, 
  just got back from work , where i actually had something to do for once, 
  can you still slow down just by pressing s without coming to a complete stop ? 
  removed , you can buy some ad space if you want to advertise here, 
  how is this relevant to new zealand ? 
  removed , rule 12, 
  oi , do n't be a dick, 
  i feel like this is something which may be able to be edited via css , though i 'm not 100 % sure on how to do it , or whether you 'd be able to still have lowercase on some words uppercase on others .
