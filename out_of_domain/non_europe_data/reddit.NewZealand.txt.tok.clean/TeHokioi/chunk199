  if i 'm interpreting [ this ] ( http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/carousel/ngeo2796-f2.jpg ) correctly though , while it does seem that earthquakes larger than an 8.2 do tend to occur more when there is higher tidal stress , i would have expected to see more of a correlation across all magnitude levels instead of just at the top end of the scale . 
  all the other magnitude levels have a fairly average correlation between tidal stress and frequency . 
  i 'd be more inclined to believe it 's following something like [ this chart ] ( https://i0.wp.com/www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd051809s.gif ) as far as the journalism side of it goes, 
  the wanderer without question . 
  it 's just got such a cool space cowboy sort of vibe , and really is the perfect closer to a great album, 
  seriously , those names are impressive . 
  i 'm literally just doing system names after polynesian / maori myth and then the planets are the system name and a roman numeral, 
  better yet , make the proposal look like another misstep, 
  the americans did this , and it works amazingly there . 
  honestly this premise has so much promise , and i really hope it 's either picked up or another network does a similar show . 
  you could make most of the show english by having barry lose fluency in arabic ( though that would n't really be realistic ) or have english as * lingua franca * as a result of the former british occupation , while scenes in everyday life would be done in arabic . 
  how about you elaborate on your claim a bit instead of just saying outright how inaccurate it is ? 
  imagine how amazing this show would have been had it gone to hbo , it could have been huge by now, 
  i was meaning more that hbo has far deeper pockets and a bigger viewer base, 
  removed , this is n't a buy and sell noticeboard, 
  / u/404colournotfound new podcast when ? 
  three essays due in the next three weeks , last ones as an undergrad . 
  need to figure out what the hell i 'm gon na do next year right about now , whether i go for honours , a different degree or just go full time, 
   try to avoid constructed items marked with a star ( such as a bypass chip or power cell ) as you will be able to get more money for a stack of plutonium ( for example ) than a single bypass chip , and they take up the same amount of space in your inventories . 
  good tips , but i disagree with this bit . 
  if you had a full stack of iron , a full stack of plutonium , and some empty slots , bypass chips would easily be worth more . 
  when you look at the costs :, 
  iron : 13.8 each , x10 = 138, 
  total resources individually = 551, 
  bypass chip base value = 3,525, 
  so even without star priority , bypass chips are more than 6 times more valuable than the sum of their parts . 
  it might take a bit longer , but it 's worth it imo, 
  i suppose when you 're making that many posts a day it would get a bit too intensive, 
  just as a question , what 's the stance on ` sources available on request ' ? 
  if i 'm a bit short of time i 'll often just write up a response and then offer to go further in depth in specific areas / provide sources if they want further reading , is that okay or do all answers need to be properly cited from the get go ? 
  similar to op , find an empty ring box and then go ` just kidding , here 's the real one ', 
  awesome , cheers for the reply . 
  what about something like [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/51l2b4/why_did_mediterranean_countries_in_europe_become/d7db478?context=3 ) , where i provided an overview of african civilisations and some context but did n't really go in depth on any of them ? 
  the issue with your post in that case was that it was a misleading title , saying that the chinese immigrants act was passed on july 5 , and not mentioning that it was july 5 , 1881, 
  you 're more than welcome to message the mods if you disagree with a post being removed . 
  as dead rooster said , we 're only human , and we 'll get things wrong from time to time . 
  we 're already working on updates to the rules anyway , and this is one of the things we 're going to focus on, 
  there was an app that had a list of them a while ago , but i 've got no idea if that 's been kept up to date or even what it was . 
  will try and track it down for you, 
  yeah , but leaving out that it was in the 19th century is a pretty big mislead in relation, 
  did n't he just say that the guy actually enforced rules ? 
  know a guy in a band , can confirm he 's taken photos with said band in front of street art, 
  tyrant had potential to be such a good show . 
  it went off the deep end a tad in the last season , but i still really enjoyed it and hope that someone picks up on the premise and does a decent show like it . 
  anthrax in the mail , one of the many perks of reddit moderating, 
  i hear they provide kiwis with free accommodation over there too, 
  removed , rule 12, 
  netflix just added life is beautiful . 
  it 's such a good movie that i 'm torn between watching it again and never wanting to see the damn thing again, 
  * the wanderer, 
  * exit, 
  * one, 
  * kite,

  i dunno , we 're not going to have creative colin this time , or kim dotcom . 
  i feel like people are slowly getting weary of national , team key seems to be copping a lot more flak than they were last time round, 
  that sucks - it 'll pick up though , everyone has a shit day every now and then . 
  at least it means tomorrow will most likely be an improvement, 
  okay , first of all , to respond to those posts in order :, 
  factual headline . 
  not editorialised, 
  factual headline . 
  not editorialised , though long, 
  not editorialised , it 's a guide to avoid flatting issues, 
  factual headline . 
  not editorialised, 
  ~ ~ factual headline . 
  not editorialised ~ ~ this one is editorialised , i agree with you here, 
  factual headline . 
  not editorialised, 
  til post with factual headline . 
  not editorialised, 
  partially editorialised, 
  factual headline . 
  not editorialised . 
  should be removed for rule 5 though, 
  so of those , only two are potentially in violation of rule 6 . 
  in both cases where there was an editorialised headline there was already a good discussion going and the post was fairly old , so instead of removing them we let them through at our discretion . 
  the last one on the list should have been removed since it 's covering the same thing as number 4 on the list , but that 's not because it 's editorialised . 
  secondly , you seem to have no idea whatsoever as to what editorialising titles actually is . 
  editorialising a title ** does n't ** mean changing the title at all , it means changing the title to an opinionated one . 
  so in the case of number 2 ( the tv3 gun story ) the headline posted ** is not ** editorialised , but if it were to read * `` dishonest tv3 host heather du plessis-allan lied to viewers to get a scoop according to police investigation '' * , then it would be editorialised . 
  ** you are allowed to change the title from the source , just not in such a way that makes it biased . 
  thirdly , i 've no idea why you 're so worked up about this , but you need to let it rest . 
  edit to add : we 're not omnipresent . 
  if you see a post you think has been editorialised , let us know . 
  if it actually is editorialised we 'll do something about it . 
  if it 's not editorialised , we wo n't . 
  what are the weird things around the wall in the top left and at the bottom ? 
  the other reply cropped it pretty good with [ this image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5ig8fxy.png ) and suggested they might be trees , which would make sense . 
  it feels like some sort of modern day aesop, 
  i won a psp when i was a kid , and a jimmy neutron cd from the dom post . 
  as for the monopoly one , i won the equivalent of a combo in two days ( free cheeseburger , free drink and free fries ) but have never won a major prize, 
  port levy is a great drive - port levy saddle , not so much . 
  especially not in a 2wd city car, 
  6s without a question , the 7 is an embarrassment to whole number releases, 
  do you go the whole way over or up and back one side ? 
  the little river side is a mare of a road , makes the port levy side look like a walk in the park,
