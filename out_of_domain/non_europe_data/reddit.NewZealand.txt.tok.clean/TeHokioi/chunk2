  did your settings drop at all or did you switch to dx9 mode ? 
  on dx9 i get the same thing , but it works fine on dx11, 
  only kiwi blogger i know is whale oil , so i 'm guessing there 's a lot of unknown kiwi bloggers, 
  supernatural is pretty cool , but that 's more of a sort of pop-esque collaboration album . 
  still some great songs on there - corazon espinado , put your lights on , maria maria and all that sort of stuff . 
  otherwise i 'm thinking one of the ultimate santana compilation albums might be a good place to start to get a more general overview and get a bit more of the classic santana sound in it . 
  i feel like an ama is a must here , if possible, 
  i 'd actually suggest looking up some of their concerts on youtube . 
  listen to it , find the type of songs you like from them and go check that album out . 
  having said that , if you 're looking for an actual album to start with i 'd echo the calls for joshua tree as part of the quintessential u2 sound . 
  what else depends on the sort of music you listen to , what other bands do you currently listen to ? 
  i was doing a modded game as the byzantines ( prince , my normal difficulty ) . 
  fairly peaceful , had a line of about five cities between my capital and my op desert wonder city . 
  got attacked by greece ( s / se of me ) , who took the city below my wonder city and made a serious threat to the wonder city . 
  while they were attacking me , france ( w of me ) joins in and cuts the city off from my capital ( to the north ) . 
  now , for some reason the map was a giant continent but where i was was a canal between the two oceans and one of my cities was a canal linking them proper . 
  germany also declared war and sent their army in from the north , other side of the canal and right by my capital . 
  kongo decided to join in as well , despite being miles off to the east . 
  they send their army to the canal / straight thing ( think of what the red sea is like in game terms ) and began to embark ... 
  at which point i killed their whole army with two dromon . 
  the greek army was being destroyed by a couple composite bowmen i 'd rush-bought and ultimately i managed to recapture my lost city and make inroads into greece ( taking corinth ) . 
  i had to use a couple horsemen to fight off france , but thankfully they did n't have a cohesive invasion force so it was fairly easy . 
  by this point , my dromons were veterans and had extra range , full bonus vs. land , attack twice and so on . 
  both by my capital , i managed to destroy the german army , before sending the dromons up the coast and besieging the entire german seaboard . 
  tl ; dr four wars at once , won all of them . 
  does n't sound indy-enough . 
  `` indiana jones and the sunken empire '', 
   some traditional ideas i think still remain correct, 
  such as ? 
  you should post some of these to / r/earthporn - they like this sort of thing, 
  sorry , did n't know about that . 
  i 'll try and find the original and put the link in the comments , if that 's allowed, 
  new zealand here , can confirm . 
  but it works in reverse too , we give australia plenty of shit , to the point a prime minister of ours in the 80 's famously said that `` people who emigrate to australia raise the iq of both countries '', 
  as much as i would love to take credit for that gem , it was rob muldoon, 
  finally , an aussie admits to their country stealing stuff off nz , you phar-lap stealing pavlova thiefs !, 
  and we laughed that you thought it was punishing us, 
  just making sure , ~ ~ given you 're from australia ~ ~, 
  we 'll take him , but we 're not giving him back, 
  what if op means 8 years in monopoly jail ... 
  * here am i floating round my tin can *, 
  * far above the moon *, 
  * planet earth is blue *, 
  * and there 's nothing i can do *, 
  damn right we do n't, 
  thanks for pointing that out , i should have checked my sources better before posting . 
  cheers !, 
  it used to be $ 59.99 usd here in nz , was waiting for a sale and then they decided to put it up to $ 79.99 usd , just for aus and nz . 
  i ended up buying it today from gmg ( which has it at 16 % off at the moment , down to $ 49.99 usd ), 
  [ here 's an example of one of the pacific-centred maps ] ( http://trctourism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/map2.jpg ) that vontysk referred to - these feature a lot in nz , even in the atlases published here . 
  it 's all a matter of perspective , that upside-down world map that was posted earlier is also seen here , but never as a serious projection . 
  going back further , [ herodotus ' map ] ( http://www.awesomestories.com/images/user/17530c8589.jpg ) shows anatolia at the centre , where he was born . 
  elorlas is right - if the great artist / writer / musician does n't have a name , you wo n't be able to create a great work . 
  it 's one of the reasons i suggest using mods that add great works on larger sized maps . 
  i 'm enjoying the coincidence of the designer 's acronym, 
  not bad , how would i go about getting a copy ? 
  edit : nevermind , found it . 
  bought all of your songs , keep it up !, 
  opening cinematic for vanilla is [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmw5-yxtkty ) - there seems to be lyrics , but i ca n't make out actual words beyond `` civ five '' right at the end . 
  as for the main menu music with vanilla ( which is my favourite of the three and is found [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrltcmhha74 ) ) there are n't any lyrics at all, 
  to those asking for more info , it 's going to be a unique improvement for a civilization . 
  all going to plan , the yield will be determined by your playstyle - not going to say too much more incase it does n't work , but more info will hopefully be forthcoming soon . 
  i think at this stage we 're looking at only desert tiles . 
  the way we 're wanting to set it up it would be op without any restrictions . 
  also , i should point out that the graphic is still , to the best of my knowledge , a work-in-progress . 
  i 'm not sure about the tundra ones , since ingame tundra is only used to represent the polar regions and not mountainous ones . 
  that said , now that we have a fix to the farm crash bug ( albeit unofficially at this stage ) i have a couple ideas that we could do , i 'll talk to you about it on steam or something . 
  as for the improvements , i 'd say talk to leugi about it , he was the one that did the model . 
  there seems to be a bit of an issue with levels of something , meaning the graphic overlaps rivers and roads , so that might need some investigation too . 
  we 'll also need the icon for the other unique , and have a play around with the colours a bit . 
  both it and the three gorges dam were originally going to be in vanilla and had art done . 
  there is also placeholder art for the large hadron collider , but that art was apparently never completed, 
  does it still work with bnw ? 
  i stopped using it with g&k because it was causing issues, 
  oh happy day , thank you !, 
  i ca n't remember exactly , back when g&k first came out ia broke everything , none of my mods would work with it or anything . 
  of course , but prior to g&k they all worked perfectly - wonder mods are only incompatible with destructive total conversion mods , and even then only in the most unusual of circumstances . 
  i would say so - with the exception being during philip of macedon and alexander 's reign when they had been conquered and were all part of the macedonian empire . 
  then of course there are the times when they worked together , either as a whole ( the whole thermopylae thing ) or as two leagues ( delian under athens [ which was to an extent an athenian empire ] and pelepponesian under sparta ) , at which point they were trying to kill each other . 
  but for the most part i 'd say that 's true . 
  5am on wednesday , but that all depends on when i get my key from gmg . 
  new zealand really sucks for international game releases sometimes, 
  indiana jones, 
  ** j ** ust ** o ** bey ** y ** ourself, 
  ftfy, 
  according to legend , i was watching my dad fix the tap , and upon seeing him drop a bolt or something down the sink , uttered ` fuck ' rather loudly as my first word . 
  wo n't stop 'em , they know damn well it 's ours . 
  just like the know that phar lap is ours !, 
  i just had a tie for the wc host vote , both myself ( existing host ) and the inca had 6 votes - the congress stayed with the current host , but i 'm not sure what happens in other cases . 
  i live in chch but spent more of my life in wellington , do i count ? 
  sitting on a roof in a city with friends at night . 
  i was on a trip to japan with a group , we 'd go onto the roof of the hostel in tokyo at night ( ladder from our room 's balcony / clothes rack ) and just chill out . 
  had all the lights of tokyo around us , was n't cold ( still about 22 degrees celsius at 11 ) and one of my mates had his guitar and was jamming in the corner . 
  good times . 
  do n't worry , i came here to make the same joke, 
  the only ` ruin ' i know of off the top of my head is `` great zimbabwe '' - the ruins of a fairly large walled city estimated to be from the 12th century and part of the former kingdom of zimbabwe . 
  if we expand it a bit to the monuments / buildings etc ( such as the hagia sofia to give a rather large example of the sort i 'm meaning ) there 's a fair few mosques on the east coast around where the kilwa sultanate and other swahili states were , most of which were originally built out of coral . 
  then you 've got a bit up in ethiopia , particularly the churches of lalibela , and across into the borderline sub-saharan states such as mali ( sub-saharan by un definition ) . 
  the great mosque of djenne is usually cited as falling into this category , but it was built by the french at the start of the 20 ^ th century , so that does n't really count . 
  there 's the tomb of askia , which was built after his death in the 15 ^ th century .
