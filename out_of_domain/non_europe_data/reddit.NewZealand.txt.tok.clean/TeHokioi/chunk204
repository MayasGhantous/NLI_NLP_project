  do you like the live versions with bono instead ? 
  not that i know of , wowy tends to be more towards the end and streets in the first half . 
  maybe this tour though , when both were part of the encore . 
  now lemon into streets is something i would love to see, 
  with regards to anzus , it 's been contentious since the 80 's when us here in nz enacted nuclear free legislation and banned all nuclear powered ships from entering new zealand waters . 
  since the us navy refused to confirm / deny what ships were nuclear capable all of their ships were refused entry , and as a result nz was suspended from the alliance . 
  things have only recently started to warm again between the us and nz , and we were only recently allowed to participate in war games again . 
  while we 're still officially suspended from anzus , we 've always sort of just assumed that the us and australia would have our backs if we got attacked ( though chances are if it 's happening that australia has either already fallen or is the one doing the invading . ), 
  the us officially has an air force base near where i live which is used as their base for antarctic operations ( where we also collaborate , mcmurdo station is within new zealand 's ross dependency ) and we 're both part of the fvey intelligence network , so even if the overt relationship has been shaky recently it 's still fairly close . 
  public opinion is a whole other kettle of fish though , nz tends to be very opposed to wars such as iraq ( 2003 ) and afghanistan ( we refused to join the coalition in 2003 to invade iraq , ) and our military as a result is far more geared towards postmodern military actions such as peacekeeping and nation building . 
  since america is seen as the perpetrator of wars like this as well as the whole nuclear thing , public opinion does n't tend to be too flash on getting close with the states . 
  it 's something our current pm has been heavily criticised on , especially his habit of playing golf with obama in hawaii . 
  i 'll respond more in depth tomorrow , but the short version is that nz is traditionally one of the friendlier western nations to china . 
  we 've got a thing called the four firsts with them relating to their economic liberalisation , including china 's first free trade agreement . 
  a lecturer of mine is an expert on nz - china foreign relations , so i can link some of her stuff too if you want . 
  aww , of all the songs on october i actually kind of like scarlet . 
  it 's not as much a proper song as some of the others , but it 's still pretty cool and better than a fair few of the songs, 
  yeah , we did send forces to afghanistan and we 've sent forces to the current war in iraq , but in 2003 our government refused to officially join the coalition to invade , instead choosing to officially condemn the invasion . 
  we did end up deploying small amounts of forces during the occupation as a result of pressure put on us by the states , but in almost all cases in these wars nz forces have been deployed outside of the normal scope of the invasions . 
  most recently the nz sas was deployed in a training capacity to iraq and not to fight , while our deployment in afghanistan [ led a provincial reconstruction team ] ( https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-zealand-lead-provincial-reconstruction-team-afghanistan ) to help rebuild afghanistan . 
  beyond these however , our major deployments in the 21st century have all been peacekeeping , and primarily in our own region with both east timor and the solomon islands, 
  it 's not exactly as clear cut as that , the ships thing was a result of us policy not to confirm or deny nuclear capabilities . 
  we 've actually got a us navy ship coming for the [ rnzn 's 75th anniversary ] ( http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11678267 ) , which had been confirmed in a private capacity to the prime minister as being non-nuclear . 
  we 've also as i said got very close cooperation with the usaf in the antarctic , and work together on occasion in the pacific . 
  on the whole , it 's probably better seen as being opposed to some decisions on american foreign policy , but not necessarily holding those who have carried them out as being responsible, 
  lucky i was n't negative ^ pls ^ gib ^ flair, 
  what are you doing at uni ? 
  oh cool , whereabouts ? 
  i did a few anth papers here at uc so can give you recommendations on what to do and what to avoid if you 're here, 
  ah , most of my advice was going to be relating to specific lecturers here so probably would n't be all that much use to you . 
  just had a quick look at the courses offered and holy crap you have a lot more than we do . 
  also auckland uni 's website is absolutely rubbish, 
  hey , happy to see you 're getting some decent responses !, 
  i think / u/ztimo summed the ideal route up pretty nicely , [ here 's a basic route map ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/mcmsktoxny52 ) to get the idea across . 
  flying into chch is definitely the better option as it means you can do the mackenzie country while still being able to check out the west coast on your way up to abel tasman . 
  another alternative as you suggested is to take the ferry over to wellington , which i would highly recommend as wellington is bloody awesome . 
  with regards to milford sound , while it * is * possible to do queenstown - milford - queenstown in a day , it 's a huge day and you do n't get all that much time in milford sound , with the time you do get there also the time that all the tour buses are there . 
  instead , i 'd suggest staying in te anau the night before ( and maybe the night after ) - this way you 're able to leave for milford sound after sparrow 's fart and you 're still able to enjoy the road without a tour bus passing every five minutes . 
  it also means you 've got the quieter tours , and can leave just as it starts getting crowded . 
  as far as your questions go :, 
  ** driving between tekapo and nelson : ** there 's not really any road that goes straight between these two , you 'd be taking lewis pass to the canterbury plains , then the back blocks through to geraldine and back onto sh8 - you 'd be far better starting in chch , going to tekapo on your way to queenstown and then going to nelson / abel tasman via the west coast, 
  ** flying chch to nelson : ** this is another option , starting in nelson , heading down the west coast and essentially doing the route in reverse . 
  it 's definitely just as feasible , but a rental car would probably be easier to get in chch and taking the ferry to wellington would be a cool end point that you may not be able to do ( though now that i think about it you could finish up in chch and take the coastal pacific up and then do the ferry , it 'd add a fair bit on again but that would be awesome too ), 
  ** direction of travel : ** this largely depends on who you 're talking to , personally i prefer going south to north on the west coast while my father swears by north to south . 
  the one thing in this regard i will say is that nothing compares to reaching the crown range lookout and seeing the whole queenstown lakes stretch out before you when the light is right, 
  ** east coast : ** personally i 'm not that much of a fan of the east coast , mainly because you 're driving for hours through flat farmland before you get anywhere half interesting . 
  i mean , there are kind of cool parts like dunedin and the steampunk in oamaru , but i do n't think they 're so good that you need to see them if you 're on a time constraint . 
  there 's a short little walk just north of kaikoura which takes you to a waterfall pool that acts as a seal pup nursery at certain times of year , but you 're coming down at the wrong time of year for the pups to be there . 
  the kaikoura coast is pretty damn cool though if you have time ( bonus if you like whale-watching or crayfish - the name kaikoura literally means meal of crayfish in maori . ), 
  i 'd suggest the kaikoura coast over further south , but the ferry is probably a nicer way to end . 
  ** abel tasman - wellington : ** [ not that hard at all ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/rmw2uszgeur ) - plus it 'd take you on a really nice drive along queen charlotte drive right along the marlborough sounds, 
  ** abel tasman duration ** ca n't really answer this one unfortunately , since i have n't done abel tasman properly myself . 
  i 'd say a couple days at least , it 's not something you 'd want to rush . 
  ** west coast / glaciers : ** you 'd absolutely regret it imo , the west coast is my favourite trip in the south island . 
  [ the glaciers have retreated a fair bit in recent years , ] ( http://users.monash.edu.au/~weinberg/pages/alpine_fault/50pct/2013_2009.jpg ) ( 2009 on the left and 2013 on the right ) but the whole trip is still definitely worth it , ca n't recommend it enough . 
  beyond the glaciers you also have [ haast pass ] ( http://lynx-travel.com/vacations/nz2000/wanaka/haast/haast/images/gates%20of%20haast%20postcard.jpg ) as you go onto the coast from wanaka and queenstown , [ lake matheson ] ( http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/i0000hee4g2.r4a8/s/1000/ ) near fox glacier township , [ punakaiki ] ( http://www.buller.co.nz/assets/uploads/kids-punakaiki-2007-346-640x480.jpg ) and the associated [ blowholes ] ( http://www.prints.co.nz/mm5/graphics/00000001/8972_craig_potton_pancake_rocks_punakaiki.jpg ) , and [ just ] ( http://accessiblenz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/windy-west-coast-road-low-res.jpg ) the [ coast ] ( http://www.punakaiki.co.nz/wp-content/themes/punakaiki-responsive/images/punakaiki-header03.jpg ) in [ general ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/2e/41/ed/2e41ede3b619332d553abe11c4c5d8b7.jpg ), 
  ** queenstown : ** okay , i * can * answer this one . 
  you 'd want a couple days at the very least , but again it depends on what sort of things you 're into . 
  there 's the classic jetboating and bungy jumps , as well as the skyline gondola for views of the whole region . 
  there 's also the tss earnslaw if you wanted something a bit more laid back ( and kitsch , depending on who you ask , ) it 's a cruise across lake wakatipu to a high country farm on board a 1912 steamship . 
  beyond that , there 's wine tours in the gibbston valley and obviously lotr location tours if you 're fans of the movies . 
  i 'd strongly recommend a day trip over to arrowtown , i spent all my summers down there as a kid and love it to bits . 
  i would say probably two-three days , depending on how much you try and cram into them . 
  i 'm surprised with a shout is so far ahead now , i love that one, 
  yeah , pretty good - [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gvcwxnh.jpg ) is my current game . 
  everyone except gilgamesh hates me ( gilgamesh is a proper bro ) because i kind of conquered three civs and am about to invade china . 
  also bonus milford sound in the bottom centre, 
  have you got it yet ? 
  try civ 5 - it 's a lot simpler than the other ones of late , and the complete collection for it is normally on sale for like $ 20, 
  yeah , i 've got two exams in early november but ah well . 
  i 'll figure something out ( civ counts as study for history and politics , right ? ), 
  we 're hiring , though the commute would probably outweigh the income, 
  you could go full tom hanks !, 
  oh shit , just a bit excited for this, 
  $ 10 says he 's working with the cartel, 
  oh come on , that 's easy money, 
  holding down right click also lets you see the movement radius , which i find fairly useful, 
  i thought it was the standard too , do n't understand how people can click to move every single time, 
  removed , rule 8 . 
  been twice in the past week , both preshows were upwards of a quarter hour, 
  umm , what sort of history have you been subscribing to ? 
  police have been around in some form or another since the ancient greeks and chinese , and while police as an entity have only been around in the modern sense since the 1600s or so their function has existed under other names for far longer . 
  claiming they 're a new invention is completely false and misleading, 
  i think it was meant as a joke , the nazi party was officially the national socialist workers ' party of germany , or nsdap, 
  awesome , gives me something to put in the sidebar pic - is the white border or the black border flag more accurate for the time ? 
  as long as you come here * after * planning, 
  should we tell him ? 
  whoops , forgot to put his name in . 
  british resident of nz was his official title at the time , kind of akin to a governor, 
  he also said `` there is n't any '' to be fair, 
  shit this is coming close to the cat genocide conspiracy one as far as my favourite nz-related nutjob blog goes, 
  this is just begging to be turned into an upvote gif, 
  there is a fairly heavy racial component in a lot of statistics , particularly relating to poverty , crime rates and ( as a result ) incarceration . 
  al jazeera has a [ really good doco ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2013/11/locked-up-warriors-201311481133704146.html ) on the subject that 's worth checking out, 
  yeah , we 're pretty much the complete opposite of that . 
  normally labour ca n't govern without support from the greens , and unless the election is a landslide for one side of the aisle nz first typically come in as the kingmakers . 
  the maori party are currently with national but can go either way , and it 's highly possible we see the return of the mana party in the next election . 
  make sure the car has chains or is 4wd though , otherwise things can get a bit more interesting on the roads, 
   body : not ( . search-page ) #search margin-top : 65px ;, 
  awesome , thanks - can that just go anywhere ?
