  and if you cleaned it with another vacuum cleaner , then you 'd be holding the vacuum cleaner that the vacuum cleaner used to clean the vacuum cleaner which the vacuum cleaner used to clean the vacuum, 
  yeah you can sod right off mate, 
  i did that as norway , once you get your army built up it 's piss easy . 
  the extra embarkation helps , and i never once had to worry about warmonger penalty so i 'd just wipe other civs out completely . 
  never once got attacked, 
  against, 
  how is this related to nz ? 
  seems to be mainly about the corruption in tonga, 
  i was made a mod of / r/modernclassics last time this came up , could totally set that up if you want, 
  last time there was a post critical of her moderation ability she removed all evidence of it, 
  it 's a bit difficult here when the post that started the whole place was literally a brawl in parliament, 
  i 'm a mod on / r/modernclassics ( one of the alternative names from when this place was proposed , ) i could try and sort that out or add some people there if you want, 
  i keep having to remind myself that rugby is n't as widespread worldwide as it is here in nz, 
  i 've done the css for / r/newzealand , could definitely help out if you want . 
  not an art major though ( but i am doing history in a bachelor of arts , so that kind of counts i suppose ), 
  just replied elsewhere in the thread , i did the css for / r/newzealand and could help get things up and running if you want ( not today though , i 've an exam in three hours ), 
  because that works really fucking well . 
  how about actually addressing some of the concerns people have instead of just shutting down unrest whenever it comes up ? 
  with regards to the politics example you gave , the lesser upvoted one is literally the picture used in the ads and that started the whole subreddit , so the fact that it 's a repost should be obvious to people, 
  obviously a hundred year old book is going to be the best guidebook on how to moderate an internet community , it 's not like you could look at legit examples almost anywhere else on this site about how lax moderation leads to poorer content and higher moderation better content ? 
  except for the guy she banned for mentioning a spinoff subreddit earlier today, 
  i thought my tone there was fairly civil , compared to the sort of shit i get as a mod myself, 
  i 'm going in to work for the afternoon , but i 'll be out the back so we 'll just have it on the pc, 
  all the smart people ring up to order and skip the line, 
  mashed potatoes , probably some roast meat , and veggies that are about an hour past good in the boiler and that you can digest without any form of chewing, 
  most high schools offer a selection of second languages to learn - where i went , you could choose between french , japanese , and te reo ( maori ) - most people took one of the first two , as you got a trip to the respective country out of it . 
  that kind of leads nicely into your second part too , travelling is a huge part of the kiwi identity . 
  most young people go on an oe ( overseas experience ) at some point after high school or around uni . 
  personally i 'm planning to head over to europe for a bit after my next year of study , but a girl i work with is heading off next week for summer in uni break and another one has just come back from a gap year between high school and uni , so it really varies . 
  this is mainly because it is so expensive , so you tend to go on one big hurrah trip instead of a bunch of smaller ones . 
   anyway , how do you feel about all the backpackers coming to visit each year ? 
  do they get on your nerves sometimes ( often ) ? 
  i do n't mind it so long as they 're respectful . 
  do n't come to check out our natural environment and then go and dump your rubbish all over it , and do n't go and [ attack our road signs ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/20/french-hitchhiker-goes-beserk-new-zealand-four-days-stuck-without-a-lift ) . 
  also americans and brits who say how everything is better back in their homeland . 
   any nz culture you want to recommend ? 
  i like music like fat freddy 's drop and princess chelsea but i only think i 've seen boy as a movie from nz . 
  check out some of taika waititi 's movies - hunt for the wilderpeople and what we do in the shadows especially . 
  also if you 're wanting some kiwi music have a look through [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/4ynny4/what_are_the_most_kiwi_songs/d6p7tc7/ ) i wrote as an intro to nz music a couple months back - if you want to know some more stuff in a specific genre just let me know and i 'll see what i can track down, 
  nice try officer, 
  someone posted [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5bo1kg/kia_ora_hej_cultural_exchange_with_rdenmark/d9q4qvm/ ) on / r/newzealand 's thread for this , and i just had a small question about it - why are you stopping at southern sweden , and not setting your ambition on the whole of scandinavia ? 
  lowest prices * are * just the beginning !, 
  it used to be one of the top all time posts on the subreddit , but the only one i can see up there is yours, 
  pretty much exactly that, 
  i 'm down for this , definitely miss the grandeur of the civ 5 quotes, 
  i really do n't like our current flag , which is why i was so pissed off that the flag committee picked such a rubbish choice to go against it . 
  just in time for election year next year too, 
  i feel like anti-clinton sentiment is carrying a lot of this , especially with the email thing late i 'm the game . 
  i reckon either of them would have been further ahead now, 
  damn , ca n't sticky comments that are n't yours . 
  bloody admins, 
  we were going to use the politics thread , but that was n't going to cover the immigration posts, 
  removed , [ see the megathread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5bywjo/us_election_megathread_or_so_i_hear_you_want_to/ ), 
  what way are you wanting to get involved ? 
  as far as being politically aware , you can just keep track of policy announcements and follow political news more closely , as well as using websites like onthefence . 
  if you 're wanting to be actually involved , you can sign up to help a political party or one of the many electoral groups which encourage turnout and help people vote . 
  the problem with democracy is that you ca n't really do all that much if you 're outvoted,

   if he not been banned first, 
  i can not confirm nor deny this has happened, 
  removed , see the [ megathread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5bywjo/us_election_megathread_or_so_i_hear_you_want_to/ ), 
  have you tried the [ points calculator ? 
  ] ( http://www.workpermit.com/immigration/new-zealand/new-zealand-immigration-points-system ), 
  it 's getting pretty bad for us over on / r/newzealand with the immigration posts too , ca n't imagine what it 's like for you guys . 
  hang in there guys , from your cousins in the south pacific who also have to put up with a loud and brash conservative neighbour, 
  that 's how i took it , but it seems immigration is a sore point here at the moment, 
  shit i 've gone straight for the stronger stuff . 
  best of luck , maybe try an exchange for part of your final year ? 
  i 've got an exam too but fuck it , it 's in the afternoon, 
  nah , i was meaning people wanting to immigrate do n't get the best responses on here,

  did n't stop trump this time though , and as far as a strong progressive candidate going against the traditional system warren seems like a clear choice . 
  though she 's never been too keen on the top job, 
  oi looks like you 've been shadowbanned . 
  you should hit up the admins and ask about that . 
  [ citation required ], 
  holy crap , are they really the sources you 're going with ? 
  i mean , wow . 
  you could have at least gone with something that looked * slightly * reputable . 
  also fox news doing a bias alert is fucking hilarious, 
  with kanye as a third party candidate carrying the yeezus vote ? 
  i do think this was definitely her election to lose , and with all credit to the republicans a stronger candidate could have easily won the election, 
  it 's kind of terrifying that a kanye west vs. donald trump election is a legit possibility now, 
  removed , [ see the megathread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5bywjo/us_election_megathread_or_so_i_hear_you_want_to/ ), 
  redone the originals or done ones of your own ? 
  the interior does n't really look maori per se , though it definitely looks polynesian, 
  hungover as fuck after drowning sorrows last night , with the added bonus of an exam this afternoon . 
  on the plus side , i 'm on holiday for the whole of next week so that should be fun, 
  which reminds me , auckland people , who 's free to meetup in the weekend possibly ? 
  oh shit , that sounds good . 
  think i 've got plans already on that night but will double check, 
  cbp is a pretty shit indicator of what all mods are like - i use over 200 mods , and i hate cbp . 
  you should try out some of the civ mods , or the enlightenment era , that actually try to fit in with the vanilla game instead of changing it, 
  oi you lot , op has actually done some research for once , so quit being dicks and actually be helpful . 
  that 's a pretty decent itinerary , though you could probably skip staying in wanaka and just drive through to queenstown instead .
