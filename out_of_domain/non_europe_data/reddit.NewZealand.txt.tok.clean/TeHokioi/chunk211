  girl a couple rows in front of me as we were waiting to be led into the arena feinted and we had to crack open a guy 's lei to give her some sugar to eat , but other than that the only interesting bits were the maori and pacific island interactions with the crowd ( i feel like karanga is the wrong word but i do n't know what the right one is ) and the harpsichord interlude, 
  how about yours ? 
  that 's a pretty decent graduation present you got - mine was a new passenger side sun visor for my car , since it did n't come with one ( it was also a new decent sized bed but we can gloss over that ), 
  why is it envy politics to say that people who have greater ability to pay tax should have to ? 
  okay , so how do you decide what 's worth what . 
  is my chicken worth a cow ? 
  why not ? 
  how many chickens is worth a cow ? 
  how many chickens can i trade for an iphone ? 
  you 'd need to make it easy to understand though , perhaps decimalise it . 
  people would need to carry it around too while they 're out doing their errands , so perhaps either like little tokens or pieces or paper or something . 
  i 'm not saying that i agree with his policy on tax , just questioning the definition as envy politics . 
  personally i would have exempted single households from it ( ie . 
  a family that only has the one home ) so that it explicitly targets investors , and i would have focused more on a more bracketed income tax . 
  i 'd have also implemented a more intensive capital gains tax , though again exempting single household families . 
  you still never said why that 's the definition of envy politics . 
  and what you 'd propose instead . 
  a flat tax rate ? 
  they needed to have a shade or something up , so that we were n't in the direct sun on a 25 degree day in black gowns and hats, 
  were you meaning the single household families by those people ? 
  if so , i completely agree and it 's unfair to lump them in - my family is in the same boat , and we 're by no means rich . 
  as far as his exact policy goes , i think we 're both in agreement on it - i was merely saying that the statement on the poster and calling for ` rich pricks ' ( whatever that definition ends up being ) should by virtue of capability pay more tax than a family who is living paycheck to paycheck, 
  it does if they get more electorate seats than their party vote - see united future , act - or if they get below 5 % but win the electorate and get coattails . 
  nah , but the procession started outside and went into the arena , this was before the ceremony as we were being organised into our seating arrangement order, 
  for sure on both counts , i do n't like people making a fuss about me , so a low key thing was nice ( not that a bed is low key , just that it 's not like a big flashy expensive thing or whatever ), 
  that 's a pretty impressive effort with the heels , i was so paranoid about tripping i would n't have dared anything that would remotely increase the chances . 
  make sure to dig through the artist 's discographies , so you can get more than one type of deep cut, 
  honestly at this point if one of them has a bad year it could very well be important . 
  labour 's polling at times below their electorate count , and national 's result last time bill was at the front was well below their electorate count, 
  oh shit should have said something earlier , could have said gidday !, 
  i do n't think you were the only person that forgot , there were a bunch of people who did, 
  i love that time of day . 
  crack open some drinks , put on some blues and just enjoy it, 
  13\u00a01/2 hour day at work starting soon , this is gon na be fun . 
  fucking love christmas in retail ... 
  on a better note , what do people think about creating a definitive / r/nz kiwi summer playlist ? 
  take like submissions on different genres of kiwi music and whatnot or something, 
  what sort of stuff does he like ? 
  we have a food smoker that totally is n't an electronic bong or anything, 
  [ 27 seats , 20.9 % of the vote ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_zealand_general_election,_2002 ), 
  which is exactly my point ? 
  oi i 'm the css guy :( will fix it tonight if he does n't, 
  any ideas on where to get native trees / plants in chch ? 
  there 's a couple nurseries from the look of google , hoping someone has experience with them so i can get a christmas present, 
  good job - i remember going to a mate 's birthday one time and none of the girls who had said they were going ended up showing up , which made things a tad skewed, 
  i feel like [ michael bay 's verse ] ( https://youtu.be/_wytg7aqtha?t=2m32s ) is fairly relevant here, 
  do n't know - we 've got a pathway / garden thing out the back with natives along the side of a creek , but we 've got quite a few gaps from where we took out a huge pile of tussocks years ago due to my hayfever . 
  never ended up replacing them , so i 'm wanting to find a place that has a decent selection of stuff which would work well there and get a voucher so the parents can choose what they like, 
  i think that 's [ brt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bus_rapid_transit ) is n't it ? 
  * one of these is not like the others *, 
  it 's hardly a major city , the argument reminds me of [ this article ] ( http://www.noted.co.nz/currently/social-issues/the-delusions-of-aucklanders/ ) straight away, 
   jfk 's america is just too boring for me, 
  well there would have been , it would have just ended a while ago and probably would still have some aspects of insurgency . 
  it 's the same as on the other side with assad, 
  if the train is more than 30 seconds late they give you a note for your employer to apologise, 
  ah , the executive email carpet bomb . 
  definitely a nuclear option in a case like this, 
  and to those up here in chch on the friday graduation !, 
  splurged out and bought some fancy new bose headphones today . 
  now just need to wait for them to come in , but from what i 've heard and tried they sound fucking amazing, 
  got buzzed by one up on the summit of rangitoto about a month ago , still in rnzaf livery . 
  that was pretty damn cool, 
  yeah , i noticed that when i was over there . 
  rural reminded me a lot more of trains elsewhere as opposed to the clich\u00e9 japanese experience, 
  that 's the one, 
  yeah , we had a sale on them which made it more reasonable - got them for ~ $ 430 in the end, 
  yeah , was tossing up whether to get it but decided to buy it in the end, 
  i suppose the flip side to it is that getting a picture with santa is a pretty standard childhood thing anyway , and the dispute does n't really need to come into it ? 
  i might 've done, 
  * a great general has been born in a faraway land !, 
  so br2 is twenty20 and br3 is a test match ? 
  can confirm , the malls are fucking nuts, 
  whenever i talk to scottish people i have to constantly stop myself from slipping into a sort of weird scottish-kiwi accent, 
  god i hope not, 
  i 'm so sorry for you, 
  surprised the moon did n't warn him about that, 
  nothing quite like a town named after a cigarette brand, 
  edit : wait that 's the simpsons . 
  seriously looks like a cool town though, 
  only if you 're the owner, 
  i figure something will happen that keeps sebastian in the lab , that 'd leave much more of a gap and he actually suits that slot, 
  you have been banned from / r/newzealand, 
  yeah racist comments like this are n't on, 
  oh shit tomorrow is december 21st like they were worried about, 
  and all in all it seems to have brought our countries closer together , having that shared history . 
  well it kind of is , battlefield propaganda is a huge part of warfare like this . 
  not here it 's not, 
  new zealand mate, 
  i normally say to stay in te anau and drive - leave early and you miss the tour busses , and get the place to yourselves, 
  punakaiki is definitely worth an overnight stay imo , it lets you see the blowholes at high tide and there are some great walks around that area, 
  too tall , needs a 10:1 ratio, 
  umm , you realise the seleucids were released like a week ago right ? 
  jerusalem is baldwin iii too , will need to ask jfd or jan to post the design since i 'm at work, 
  okay , so here to advocate for jerusalem 's inclusion , here is the design and a bit of explanation about the civ :, 
  ## jerusalem - baldwin iii, 
  ** ua : deus vult : ** may choose a different type of unique crusader order in each city , allowing only one type at the time . 
  combat bonus when near cities following other religions, 
  ** uu : crusader ** , replaces knight . 
  provides different bonuses based on which crusading order is present in the city where it was trained, 
  ** ub : chapter house ** .
