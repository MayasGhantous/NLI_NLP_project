  standalone unique building , available at theology . 
  newly trained units start with +10 experience , and a unique promotion based on which crusading order is present in the city . 
  also provides a small yield based on the crusading order present , and requires a temple present in the city . 
  so that does n't really tell you much about the civ 's specfics , though it does give a great idea as to how the civ plays . 
  in essence , it is five civs in one . 
  each city chooses a crusading order , which in turn gives a varied unique unit and unique promotion from the ub , as well as a pantheon-like effect as soon as the order is adopted . 
  to go into further detail about said bonuses :, 
  ** crusading order bonuses : ** ( come into effect as soon as the order is chosen ), 
  * knights templar * - bonus gold and faith from trade routes to the city, 
  * teutonic order * - +20 % production towards melee units, 
  * knights hospitaller * - carries over additional 10 % food when a new citizen is born, 
  * knights of the holy sepulchre * - extra city defence / hitpoints , +20 % production towards ranged units, 
  * order of saint lazarus * - +1 food from deserts , city acts as fresh water, 
  ** crusader types : ** ( unit type and bonuses vary based upon which order , but all still replace the knight ), 
  * knights templar : * heavy foot infantry . 
  increased combat strength , and earns xp faster . 
  produced faster , +25 % strength while in rough terrain . 
  * knights hospitaller : * light infantry . 
  generates science while in enemy lands , +35 % strength vs cavalry . 
  * order of the holy sepulchre : * cavalry . 
  prevents enemy religious units from converting cities it 's garrisoned in . 
  +25 % combat strength while in friendly lands . 
  * order of saint lazarus : * light cavalry . 
  gain faith from kills , and adjacent units heal +10 hp per turn . 
  ** chapter house bonuses : ** ( unique promotion , and +2 of a given yield ), 
  * knights templar * ( nomini tuo da gloriam ) - +25 % combat bonus outside friendly territory ( gold ), 
  * teutonic knights * ( christ ist erstanden ) - no movement cost to pillage ( production ), 
  * knights hospitaller * ( tuitio fidei ) - +25 % combat bonus while near your religious units ( science ), 
  * order of the holy sepulchre * ( deus lo vult ) - +40 % combat bonus within two tiles of friendly cities ( culture ), 
  * order of saint lazarus * ( atavis et armis ) - when garrisoned , generate additional faith ( food ), 
  * please note : final numbers and effects are subject to balance changes pending feedback and gameplay review *, 
  i 'm more than happy to answer any questions relating to them and why they should be in the game - of note is that the ai is more than capable of using this system , and will be programmed to adopt a variety of orders so that they can make full use of all the units and promotions in their conquest of all heathens . 
  it 's alt history set in america where the axis won ww2 , so it 's pretty full on . 
  oh nah donation boxes are fine , it 's when the cashier is like `` do you want to donate a dollar to ( insert charity here ) '', 
  why were you doing your boss ' washing in the first place ? 
  it 's set in the sixties iirc , the point of diversion was just the war, 
  yeah maybe , i tended to think of boss as in your manager or whatever instead of the customer , but that would make sense . 
  hell , load the train on the ferry and have the same one go the whole way, 
  you just reminded me of inferno , that movie was such a letdown, 
  as someone who works in retail , it 's normally that the amount of money you make in that final bit is n't worth the cost of staying open an extra hour or two , because we have such a small population . 
  where i work we used to be open until midnight the whole week before christmas , but nobody would come in after 10pm so it was pointless to be open for that time and they just stopped doing it - it 's the same sort of thing in these other shops, 
  i remember seeing something a while back where someone redid the track list with only the studio songs , and a couple b-sides included too . 
  they named the album ` heartland ' or something , but it was a really strong track listing, 
  * should *, 
  the art wo n't be the issue ( hopefully ) - it 'll be more the decisions and other little bits of polish not needed for the cbr, 
  the only problem with this is splitting the vote - if 70 % of voters wanted russia , but it was split amongst 6 options , then russia might end up missing out despite being a clear favourite, 
  seleucids have been released , / u/tpangolin just does n't like to admit it . 
  oman ai will be updated too, 
  oh mb , misread the post, 
  yep , finish work at 8pm on christmas eve and start again at 6am on boxing day, 
  i 'm still holding out with probable false hope for that airbus [ `` vitalising zone '' ] ( http://www.airbus.com/innovation/future-by-airbus/the-concept-plane/the-airbus-concept-cabin/vitalising-zone/ ), 
  yeah for sure , i 've been wanting to but i 'm flat out at the moment with other commitments so have n't had a chance, 
  trades hall bombing was n't after 1970 was it ? 
  by all means go for it , i took over from / u/zooropa93 when he ran out of time for them so it only makes sense that the mantle is passed on again, 
  i still check the place almost daily , so can handle the stickying no worries, 
  shit forgot about this . 
  i 'll get on it now, 
  chur , need me some gold anyway, 
  eh , why not, 
  hey guys , glad to see you back here again !, 
  ( i was the one who sent you the message about it on fb too , great to see it finally happen ! ), 
  there have been a few rumours floating around about the increased possibility of an imminent ` big one ' in the hikurangi trench or alpine fault regions , any chance we could get some official word on whether current estimates show increased pressure and likelyhood in either of these cases ? 
  i 'd also like to ask about the recent ` eruption ' in rotorua - is this sort of thing common , or does it hint at increased geothermal activity in the area ? 
  on that note too , i was in the area recently and was amazed at the amount of steam coming out of the ground , not only in marked geothermal areas but also just out of footpaths and stormwater drains and so on . 
  is this a fairly harmless phenomenon in terms of ground stability , or does it indicate at a localised weakness or underground systems of some sort ( if that even remotely makes sense , i 'm not entirely sure ), 
  finally , also on the note of kaikoura . 
  it 's long been said that an underwater landslide in the canyon could potentially cause a tsunami , i 'm wanting to know whether this is possible ( not the landslide , the resulting tsunami ) and if so how such a thing works . 
  as i understand them , tsunami are caused by water displacement , which as far as i know would n't happen in the case of a simple landslide that 's entirely underwater ? 
  cheers again for doing the ama guys !, 
  cheers for the reply !, 
  so the steam is just a case of groundwater evaporation instead of an actual geothermal system ? 
  what about the fumaroles around lake rotomahana and elsewhere , are they similar or different again ? 
  if you have n't gotten too many requests that you 're overloaded , it 'd be awesome if you could please get the top ones for / r/newzealand too,
