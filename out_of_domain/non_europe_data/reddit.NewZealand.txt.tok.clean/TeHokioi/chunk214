  oh nah that would have been fine , she was hitting the bathroom door and crying for water, 
  depends on what sort of modding you 're talking about , working on some stuff for civ 5 now, 
  removed , this breaks about three different rules all at once, 
  those are the best trips though !, 
  i remember taking some mates up to godley head one time for a walk round there , we ended up getting lost and having to walk through a sheep paddock to get back up to the carpark . 
  was n't as bad as yours , but was definitely feeling the tension on the way back, 
  totally would if i did n't already have plans for literally the first time ever . 
  feel free to [ send a modmail ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fnewzealand ) and get a second opinion if you think i 've made a mistake, 
  no mention that it 's a petition, 
  implying all kiwis object, 
  calling the unsc resolution biased, 
  could you clarify what you mean by ` long term vision ' ? 
  why do you have to work ? 
  you in hospo or something ? 
  gah , still tossing up whether to get it or not, 
  removed , rule 8, 
  that would imply he 's ever sober, 
  swear to god it took me like five tries to not read that as amphetamines, 
  went out there to install a telly once , absolutely insane place the guy had . 
  right on the water too, 
  ** reminder : ** today is the ** last day ** to vote in the [ / r/nz best of 2016 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5jpfad/rnewzealand_best_of_2016_awards_thread/ ) awards - results will be announced next week , so make sure you get your vote in before voting closes tonight !, 
  we 're also relaunching an old tradition started several years ago by / u/rraaarr , that is the best of kiwi music from 2016 - suggest your favourite kiwi tracks to be released this year , and we 'll sort out an official playlist with the most upvoted tracks . 
  i 've created a thread [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5l5kbl/alright_rnz_time_to_choose_the_best_of_kiwi_music/ ) , so head on over and suggest some stuff, 
  we 've got weekly whinging wednesday , could easily be part of that, 
  any chance you can include a link too for people who have n't heard it ? 
  oh my fucking god , another one of these things . 
  removed under three separate rules , and if you post another one you 'll be banned from the sub, 
  feel free to [ send a message to the mods ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fnewzealand ) if you disagree with my call . 
   apologizing, 
  the use of z instead of s still makes me think you 're an undercover american, 
   your australian i take it ? 
  * and in a rather unusual turn of events for the night , emergency services were called to a suburban house where a man was suffering from acute marshmallow poisoning after eating an entire bag with two minutes of opening it . 
  emergency services are calling for people to eat responsibly in the holiday period and be aware of the dangers of overindulgence in confectionery after the tragic events of last night . 
   of course , the songs all have to have been released this year, 
  removed this under rule 5 , we already had a post about it a couple days ago, 
  honestly , search the sub first and see what people suggest . 
  we get a shitload of these posts , so understandably it gets a tad tiresome after a while, 
  oh man , i used to love getting fish and chips and sitting down on island bay beach in summer as a kid and just looking out towards the south island, 
  click the flair , it 'll show you all posts with the same flair, 
  you clearly have n't seen the average travel advice post here, 
  ~ ~ friday ~ ~ ** special nye edition ** drunk shitposting goes here, 
  i thought you were going to akaroa ? 
  but you said you went to kaikoura ? 
  had the same issue , talked to support and they got it all sorted out for me, 
  or , you know , napalm, 
  [ the beths - whatever ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=qtqx7rwtr8a ), 
  mothers of the disappeared and exit leading the polls is such a shame , they 're both amazing songs and mothers is the best way to end the album with such a haunting and poignant moment, 
  removed under rule 9, 
  definitely not in the top 5 imo given the a side and one tree hill , but no way should it be one of the first to go, 
  i 'll be honest , trip through your wires is my least favourite on the album , the harmonica never really did it for me, 
  finally done a pano that 's wide enough for the header, 
  holy shit , that difference . 
  teach me your ways, 
  hah , what ever happened to that astrophotography thing you 've been talking about since this time last year ? 
  yeah , he 's pretty onto it . 
  not sure if he 'd be able to pull the image back * that much * though, 
  edit : oh wait , just noticed that 's under and over the final image . 
  yeah as much as i love that idea , that 's a massive trip in the time frame . 
  what i 'd suggest in terms of days etc for this would be :, 
  day 1 : arrive in wellington am , spend day, 
  day 2 : wellington-picton-blenheim, 
  day 3 : blenheim-nelson , day in nelson, 
  day 4 : nelson-punakaiki, 
  day 6 : arthur 's pass-fox glacier, 
  day 7 : fox glacier-queenstown, 
  day 8 : queenstown-te anau, 
  day 9 : milford sound, 
  day 10 : te anau-invercargill, 
  day 11 : invercargill-bluff-queenstown, 
  and to give you some idea , days 1 and 2 are the only ones where you 'd have less than four hours minimum driving . 
  what you could potentially do instead would be to not stay in blenheim , skip arthur 's pass , and not bother with anything south of queenstown . 
  that would get you down to six days and still be a decent trip with time to look around , plus you 'd have time to do a bus tour ex . 
  queenstown for milford . 
  alternatively , if you were able to extend it to a two week trip , you could make it a real great trip . 
  you mentioned last time wanting to get off the beaten track , so from invercargill you can head up the coast to dunedin instead of going to queenstown again and go through the catlins , which is a [ gorgeous ] ( http://m0.i.pbase.com/o2/79/116779/1/98009080.zpjkidzx.nz_67.jpg ) part [ of ] ( https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/8a292f72/dms3rep/multi/desktop/hmcherry_tree03-1600x1066.dm.edit_18bbe1.jpg ) the [ country ] ( http://www.backpackerguide.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tjb1wdv.jpg ) barely ever visited by anyone , with a real rugged and isolated feel . 
  that 'd add about a day , which would still give you time to go check out gibbston for the wineries and the craft beer scene in wellington , which you seemed keen on too last time . 
  all without having to cut anything, 
  plenty of us , though we mostly hide over at / r/u2band to avoid people complaining, 
  no line has some pretty decent songs , but i 'd agree with how to dismantle an atomic bomb, 
  they have absolutely shit choice in singles lately for sure . 
  so many better songs on their albums than the ones they try to market, 
  here in new zealand our national parks are free all the time, 
  this is awesome , the exact sort of thing this place should be about and it sucks to see people downvoting it, 
  * note : poochie died on the way back to his home planet *, 
  are queens of the stone age really small enough to be shared here ? 
  still waiting on gold from the admins , might just go ahead and post it if they do n't give it out by the end of the week, 
  we had 30 + degrees a couple days ago , then it was back to shit the day after , and we 're supposed to have hail today, 
  eh , with luck it 'll mean we get an awesome front and storm cell , which is definitely worth the hail . 
  any excuse to play the joshua tree and stevie ray vaughan, 
  texas flood is always good too , though maybe not when it 's so cold, 
  removed , rule 8, 
  i 'll bite - how is the resolution oppressing all jews ? 
  i 've been hearing a fair bit of stuff like this , moreso in media than through ads . 
  opinion pieces telling people to buy and that the market is safer than ever and all that shit , definitely getting deja vu from it all, 
  damn , good list . 
  i like the danny lanois remix on asoh even more too , and ooc is plain and simple a really fun song . 
  until the end of the world is the only song from achtung i do n't actually have , plus i 've kind of gone off the slower long songs like kite and moment of surrender . 
  they 're both great songs , but i think you definitely need to be in the mood for them, 
  but nah , for me it 's the songs that are different and powerful each time - bullet , bad etc - and the songs that have that raw emotion in them . 
  stuff like streets , cobl , out of control and so on .
