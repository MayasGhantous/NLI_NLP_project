  some also have really good versions of them , like the [ slane castle sunday bloody sunday ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbnuiqivpbu ) or [ mothers of the disappeared from tempe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txgckwetzde ) ( actually , now that i think about it all of the mothers performances have been great . ), 
  and of course , you have to mention 40, 
  i 'd love to time travel to any of their tours tbh - zoo tv is the last time they came to my home town , but looking at footage of all their earlier stuff makes me feel so jealous, 
  i maintain it 's an anti-mc conspiracy , and strongly believe that multiple mc civs lost out because of tpang 's actions to limit our influence . 
  i 'd get rid of sometimes you ca n't make it personally , it 's always seemed a pretty weak song imo . 
  i do n't know if i could decide on an all-out top 20 , but for some songs that i highly recommend from my favourites , not necessarily the best by any means :, 
  * [ acrobat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nha1ths9ava ) : * from achtung baby , it 's easily one of the most raw and emotional u2 songs with a wailing guitar and rolling drums while the lyrics vent about everything from love to existential crises . 
  it 's a great song for catharsis in a sort of opposite way to the opening of joshua tree - where streets is through happiness and running , acrobat is belting out anger and smashing stuff . 
  * [ out of control  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvvscmw8n_i ) * one of their first songs ever , it 's just a straight up fast rock song that 's fun as hell . 
  shows their roots but has stood the test of time too , even if the lyrics are about bono being mopey at turning 18 . 
  * [ the wanderer  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-dzvqxyx1g ) * / u/pieblacon has already given a great list of stuff from zooropa , but i felt like i needed to mention the so-called antidote to zooropa 's drug . 
  the whole track is a mix of stuff which on the surface should n't work at all , but somehow * does . 
  * johnny cash 's vocals set atop zooropa 's weird electronic futuristic music give the whole track a sort of bizarre space cowboy vibe perfect for going out on a drive just after the sun has set . 
  gets better after each listen too - i should know , it 's my most played track by a wide margin ( ~ 30 ahead of acrobat , but ~ 80 ahead of 3rd place ), 
  * [ desire  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8rq575dwd8 ) * another kind of weird song , bono turns half preacher in an awesome and catchy blues rock song based on a classic beat . 
  it was part of a very mixed album that upped pretentiousness to 11 , but it 's still a damn good song . 
  harmonica is always an added bonus too . 
  * [ breathe  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2x2ow1-s5y ) * i often feel like this gets overlooked , which is a shame because it 's a great song that reminds me of a newer version of streets . 
  nowhere near on the same scale as that of course , but it still has that same sense of soaring and wanting to shout at the top of your lungs as it comes back from the solo . 
  i 'll also second all of the top posts list , a sort of homecoming and lemon are some of my all time favourites , and highly recommend doing a bit of exploring of some of their stuff on youtube / spotify to find some songs you might like out of their catalogue that we 've missed , there 's bound to be a few . 
   the combination of `` lemon '' and `` with or without you '' is probably my favourite u2 live moment ever . 
  the fact that two such different songs work so well when played after one another, 
  i 'm still holding out for lemon into streets personally - like the slane castle one , but instead of * all i want is you !, 
  * it 's * midnight is where the day begins *, 
  my itunes shuffle just scheduled an entire album in a row . 
  i do n't know what to do with life anymore, 
  you 've become peter dunne , looks like dirtyformal messed up the css a bit . 
  edit : fixed it , you 're back to billy t ( though it may not be the same flair ), 
  results of the / r/newzealand best of 2016 [ have been posted !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5m1gzf/rnewzealand_best_of_2016_results_thread/ ) head on over and check out the winners !, 
  tbh i seriously considered gilding / u/blazeityolo420 for that category, 
  why are people so negative about the best of results ? 
  it 's been downvoted to oblivion since it was posted, 
  i hear it 's really popular but has issues with quality control and stealing other people 's fibre, 
  mate , i 've not wanted to say anything , but for the love of god we have daily random discussion threads for a reason, 
  yeah fair point, 
  it 's twice what i have, 
  now we just need to wait for the 30th anniversary achtung baby tour to hear acrobat, 
  have it like zoo tv , where he was in a lower range and harmonising with edge, 
  yeah , it 's not like bono made a big deal about it by writing a massive letter or anything ... 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm not saying to stop the self posts entirely . 
  just maybe tone it down a tad and think if it could go in the daily first, 
  look at their post history - it 's not the first time , and often the posts are n't related to nz beyond it being one of the regulars posting . 
  that 's what i 'm meaning , if it 's not something about nz other than that it happened here , that 's why we 've got the discussion threads, 
  as i responded to someone else , this one has n't particularly broken anything . 
  but the earlier posts had arguably broken rule 8 , and this is more a comment directed at those . 
  i probably worded it pretty shit , so i do apologise on that front to / u/chopsnz, 
  that hurts real deep , at least i did n't take the gold from it though, 
  this one , sure - and i 've already stated that i overreacted and have apologised to op . 
  what about [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5lke9k/so_just_sitting_here_watching_a_couple_of/ ) , or [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5lbs9h/i_have_a_hangover_i_was_meant_to_do_something/ ) , both of which could easily be posts in the daily, 
   a few years ago i worked out a version of acrobat that could be played loudly and with passion . 
  the hardest part would be the drums , but they use click tracks and larry is pretty mech has perfect timing anyways . 
  bass would not be beyond adams abilities , and vocals would not be beyond bonos abilities . 
  and edge just pretty much does his own thing anyways . 
  of the songs they do n't play , acrobat would be the one they still would be able to . 
  i 'd be interested to hear your take on what acrobat could be live . 
  i 've worked out two possible ones , electric / full band and acoustic . 
  oh shit it 's automod 's cakeday . 
  happy birthday automod !, 
  yeah except this is an election year and that sort of shit never works at all, 
   1 - how do you classifiy the weather in new zealand ? 
  it 's a little bit of everything . 
  it 's currently warm and sunny here , but we 're supposed to get thunder and hail later on . 
  we 're one of the hardest places to forecast weather, 
   2 - do new zealand have some bizarre urban culture like carreta furac\u00e3o, 
  as far as i know we do n't have anything quite on that level , though we do have some interesting urban culture . 
  wellington ( our capital ) is very hipster-oriented and has some really cool stuff going on , and oamaru ( a small town down south ) is the self-proclaimed steampunk capital of the world , with steampunk festivals and everything . 
   3 - do new zealand invest money and science on outer space-wise technology ? 
  i saw that they were planing opening a space agency but i did n't saw any news after that . 
  we 've got rocketlabs , a private space company which is slated to make nz one of the most active space nations in the world . 
  they 're talking about one launch every 72 hours , which would be so damn cool, 
   4 - what is the feeling of being one of the countries with most `` advanced '' time in relation to the other ones ? 
  i have no idea what it is like to celebrate stuff like new year in another timezone , but does it give some special feeling about it ? 
  we mainly just use it to reap karma on / r/pics tbh, 
   5 - what 's your favorite local food ? 
  do you recomend some kind of food from nz for me to try making it at home ? 
  ( maybe i wo n't have the ingredientes , but i can try it anyway with substitutes ), 
  i 'm not sure we really have ` local ' food , most of our cuisine mainstays are imported from elsewhere, 
  i really wanted a new flag , but the whole process was horrible and our options were worse . 
  i ended up voting for the old flag because that way we 'd get another chance with a better flag later on, 
  it 's reasonably common in a thunderstorm , though we have n't had a real big one lately . 
  normally happens more in winter , especially when it 's not cold enough to snow, 
  not really . 
  we have people who pioneered stuff like maori rights and women 's suffrage , but no-one who is a key national figure like washington, 
  kind of , though we are traditionally fairly left wing and lately we 've moved to the right . 
  but our right wing is still fairly left , gay marriage was passed under a conservative government, 
   how 's the political situation out there ? 
  what were the latest scandals ? 
  well our prime minister resigned a couple weeks ago , so there 's that . 
  this year is an election year too , so should be fun . 
   how does the kiwi accent sound like ? 
  is it similar to or completely different from the australian accent ? 
  they 're completely different . 
  we 're like * ` where 's the car ' * and they 're like * `` where 's the car '' *, 
   do you find it annoying when you 're left out of a world map ? 
  eh , a little bit . 
  but at least it means when the world turns to shit no-one will know where to invade, 
   i know that you might be tired of being asked about the flag referendum all the time , but what were your favourite submissions ? 
  i quite liked this one and another one i ca n't find right now . 
  ca n't find them at the moment , but there were some fantastic submissions .
