  it 's commemorating race relations and the founding of new zealand , and for the head of government of new zealand to stand that up on account of not being allowed to politic then that would in my opinion go against everything waitangi day should be about . 
  of course now that it 's come out he was n't allowed to speak at all then i 'd say the disrespectful one was ngapuhi , but my comment about it being disrespectful was based around that first period , not now, 
  i 'd suggest watching some youtube videos of their live stuff , since that 's more how you 're going to experience them . 
  some personal picks i think epitomise u2 :, 
  [ * bad , * from live aid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ziw8qdphos ) ( 1985 ) : this is the performance that is almost universally regarded as catapulting u2 to global fame . 
  it features lots of now core u2 concert features - bono bringing people onto the stage , snippets of other songs , the rest of the band having no clue what bono 's up to - * rolling stone * has a great writeup of this performance and the significance of it [ here ] ( http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/u2s-bad-break-12-minutes-at-live-aid-that-made-the-bands-career-20140710 ) , which is worth a read too . 
  [ * 40 * , from the joshua tree tour , tempe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2lrxhcriwi ) ( 1987 ) : from the first joshua tree tour , 40 is one of u2 's best live songs . 
  the edge and adam swap instruments , and the crowd joins in , often singing `` how long to sing this song ? '', 
  for several minutes after the band have filed off the stage one by one . 
  it 's become an iconic part of u2 concerts , and one which i 'm sure will be the very last song ever played by u2 live , as it 's the only fitting way to end their careers when the time finally comes . 
  [ * i still have n't found what i 'm looking for * , from the joshua tree tour ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzrxyrbyixa ) ( 1988 ) : i 'll be honest , i could post a bunch of songs from the joshua tree , but this 'll be my last . 
  you probably wo n't get this much with i still have n't found , but this is my favourite live version of it . 
  a great thing about u2 is how many different interpretations and versions of their music you can get , and in this instance being joined by an entire gospel choir on stage leaves no doubt as to the religious aspect of the song . 
  a recording of this eventually found its way onto the follow-up to the joshua tree , which was a weird mix of live and studio songs . 
  does n't stop this being fantastic though . 
  [ * lemon * and * with or without you * , from zoo tv , sydney ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jatpn1ls874 ) ( 1993 ) : this is u2 at the height of their extravagance . 
  the first thing you 'll see is bono , dressed as his alter-ego mr. macphisto , prank calling a taxi company . 
  in other concerts on the zoo tv tour this was everyone from sports coaches of local franchises to president h. w. bush . 
  lemon has bono showing off his falsetto , though in this version he 's also just singing against the rest of the band , which is n't in the studio version . 
  [ * please * from the mtv awards ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecdj_hqiyik ) ( 1997 ) : part way through the performance of lemon i just linked to , bono shouts `` off with the horns , on with the show '' - something which you could argue also happened to u2 after zoo tv , aside from the occasional giant lemon . 
  instead of extravagance and more dance-inspired music , u2 opted to perform one of the more candid songs from their 1997 album pop when performing at the mtv awards , in the form of the song please - a political plea to end the violence in northern ireland . 
  the performance was just straight rock with no embellishment , with bono even opting for a hoodie for the show instead of some fancy bejewelled outfit . 
  [ * miss sarajevo * , from popmart , sarajevo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3krelhvg5i ) ( 1997 ) one of u2 's most iconic performances , their 1997 show in sarajevo was performed in the midsts of one of the most atrocious conflicts of the present day . 
  the song , also written against the backdrop of the conflict , was performed here for the first time live and features an operatic verse performed by luciano pavarotti . 
  the song and the concert both pleaded with people not to forget about the plight of those in sarajevo and the rest of the former yugoslavia , making the performance a very poignant moment . 
  [ * mothers of the disappeared * , from popmart , santiago ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufmowv1cns ) ( 1998 ) another emotional moment from the popmart tour came from the santiago show , where u2 were joined onstage by * the * mothers of the disappeared , an organisation set up of women whose children had been taken by the death squads of various latin american dictators during the 80 's , and for whom the song was written . 
  i thought about including the performance from the joshua tree tour , which included a powerful verse at the end in spanish and english , but decided that this one was a better example of the emotion behind the song . 
  this concert was televised throughout chile , promoting bono to include the chant * el puebo vencera * ( the people will overcome ) at the end after previously using it in earlier live shows , to thunderous applause . 
  one of my favourite concert closers . 
  [ * sunday bloody sunday * and * wake up dead man * , from slane castle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhk6pczb8gi&amp;t=25m27s ) ( 2001 ) if any song gets bono worked up in concert , it 's this one . 
  the call and response of `` no more ! '', 
  is a mainstay in live performances , and in 1987 bono went on a rant and started swearing in the middle of the song . 
  the 2001 performance at slane castle in ireland took a similar approach , with an extended interlude where bono calls to ` turn this song into a prayer . ', 
  he closes the song by naming all 29 people killed in the 1998 omagh bombing , before launching into a quiet , resigned emotional outburst song in the form of `` wake up dead man . '', 
  i could n't find a video of just the two , so i included the whole concert and skipped to the relevant bit . 
  the whole concert is pretty good though . 
  [ * mlk * and * where the streets have no name * , from the superbowl halftime show ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq08ouowiqq ) ( 2002 ) : in a moment of catharsis for many around america , u2 took the opportunity of the first superbowl after the september 11 attacks to pay tribute to those who lost their lives . 
  mlk , an emotional tribute written about martin luther king lead into where the streets have no name , as the names of all who died in the 9/11 attacks scrolled up the screen behind them . 
  streets is one of their greatest live songs , and i could have included any number of versions from across the years , but this one is probably among the best in my view . 
  i 'll finish up with some songs from the tours in the past decade tomorrow , but in the meantime if you want i 'd suggest checking out u22 , it 's a compilation album of the best performances from the u2360 tour . 
  my brother tried voting in it early on and got told he could n't because it was the same ip address , despite using different devices in the house . 
  i feel like there 's some sort of smartass comment i could make to / u/appexxd _ here but it 's too early to think it up, 
  [ here 's a post i wrote up last night ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/u2band/comments/5n7r05/roo_attendee_trying_to_get_into_u2/dca3byv/ ) on the u2 subreddit for another person looking into u2 's stuff before bonaroo , cataloguing some of in my opinion some of their most iconic live performances . 
  i skipped a lot of stuff out , but it 's a decent intro imo, 
  [ citation required ], 
  yeah , that 's a decent idea . 
  i do n't know if i 'd want to remove them outright , but we can definitely put comments in directing them to the regionals, 
  was n't someone in the am thread going berry-picking too ? 
  go to welly anyway , it 's awesome, 
  finally got the a/c in my car sorted , do n't need to overheat on the way home from work when outside is just as hot as the car is from being in the sun all day, 
  too many false positives to work , you 've seen the nz bot, 
  there 's alcohol in anything if you try hard enough, 
  heyooo what kind of schedule ? 
  comment below ruined it, 
  how the hell do you have the united future flair again ? 
  i can see up to 2160p , here in nz and using firefox, 
  what sort of advice ? 
  / u/my _ usrname_of_choice for mod 2017 !, 
  hang on , i 'll fix it * again *, 
  black seems a bit sad for a wedding , surely ? 
  i 'd have thought bright and colourful would be the order of the day, 
  did i ? 
  ca n't believe i went to all that work to fix your flair and you 're using an * app . 
  tl ; dr we 're better mods than you were, 
  love you too, 
  i 'll pm you the details, 
  i dunno , based on what people say i 'd have figured us mods would all be on the extreme far right, 
  new zealand namedropped , i 'm happy - just hope they realise there 's more than auckland, 
  were you around after nloth ? 
  every couple of weeks / months it 'd be `` songs of ascent is going to be released in x months '' - was supposed to be 2010 , then 2011 , then 2012 and so on until it evolved into soi, 
  surely you 'd just need the photo id ? 
  removed under rule 8 , other than it launching from here there 's nothing to do with nz, 
  reminder if you have n't seen it to check out the [ 2017 subreddit update ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5nks76/rnewzealand_state_of_the_subreddit_2017_amas/ ) , including details on how to apply for being a mod ( which is basically just the same as what you do already but with extra abuse ! ), 
  seconding the call for bright accessories . 
  red would look good for sure . 
  i 'm still not completely sold on black at a wedding , but it looks decent regardless, 
  did someone say hawkmoon 269 ? 
  first thought was a bluey-green but then she said she wanted to steer clear of that . 
  does n't mean you ca n't, 
  aww i was looking forward to that, 
  [ they 've ( kinda ) done it before ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7lol8btfg0 ), 
  there 's a bunch from work who have been talking about doing cave stream and castle hill astrophotography already anyway , so i 'm down for sure, 
  given teen pregnancy rates i 'm guessing the latter, 
  looked fucking mint , clouds were all swirly and shit too . 
  last time it was like this it was even cooler , we had a [ globemaster come in at the same time ] ( http://i.imgur.com/najpuxt.jpg ), 
  yeah i could have sworn he was at least 40, 
  mate at work has n't had a winter in like 7 years or something , he goes off to work in the states in winter so just has constant summer . 
  must be nice, 
  i believe it was sarcastic , or at least i hope so, 
  i always screw up at ... koauauo ... 
  deleted comment and five comments begging for more info , i 've never felt more left out, 
  yeah , pretty much enforcing the rules , dealing with user reports ( which links back to point 1 ) , updating shit and adding new shit when needed . 
  sometimes automod fucks up too and we need to open the bonnet and take a look , but tbh that normally happens around daylight savings . 
  other than that we just tend to use mod tags for sweet karma, 
  no need for any of that for the most part , if there is it 's normally straightforward ( as in , changing `` gmt +13 '' to `` gmt +12 '' at the end of daylight savings in automod 's config ), 
  it 's really just whenever you can , it 's not like you 're having to be active 24/7, 
  summit road ? 
  looks mean as , great shot, 
  holy shit, 
  it 's a joke , based on a true story,
