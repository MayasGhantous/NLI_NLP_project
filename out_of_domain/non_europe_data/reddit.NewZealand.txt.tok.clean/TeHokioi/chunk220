  we 've warned you about self promotion before - i 'm gon na ban you this time , feel free to get in touch with us if you have an issue with this, 
  hah , friends reaching out to me . 
  what 's that ? 
  i swear i have a legit reason each time , plus i went to / u/ekanttakephotos ' astrophotography night out by lake ellsemere - you could have even had a ride in my car if you 'd gone to that !, 
  those are normal , check for buttons on the other side to go in said holes, 
  to be fair it 's hard not to make an outdated map of syria at the moment, 
  somalia 's not really middle eastern, 
  you should see what [ our ] ( http://admin.noted.co.nz/uploads/metro/2014/03/mt0314_colincraig_crop2.jpg ) politicians [ do ] ( https://www.nbr.co.nz/sites/default/files/images/colin-craig-grass.jpg ), 
  the best part is his walk [ syncs perfectly ] ( https://gifsound.com/?gif=i.imgur.com/i8tosxs.gif&amp;v=zfovhmfdquk ) with stayin ' alive, 
  but how can that be if we 've already had the last crusade ? 
  nah , it 'll go up as soon as david shows up , since as per usual it 's made by his account to make it easy to sort by answers, 
  shit did n't think granite was supposed to have such sharp edges, 
  any questions are more than welcome, 
  hi david , thanks for stopping by and kicking off our 2017 political ama series !, 
  given your position in epsom ( and by extension , act 's position in parliament as a whole ) is due famously to deals with national in order to take advantage of tenets of mmp , what is your view on mmp reform - specifically in relation to the coattails rule , 5 % threshold and electorate deals with microparties such as act and united future - and how do you reconcile this with act having a seat in parliament despite gaining less votes in the 2014 general election than both the conservatives and internet-mana , both of whom received no seats at all ? 
  with relation to your recently announced housing plan , you call to remove cities from the resource management act in order to force development and speed up construction . 
  how do you justify this , given the rma is designed to prevent unsustainable development and further degradation of our urban environment ? 
  on this note , national has consistently evaded environmental issues and has an extremely poor track record in the area - famously stating that only being able to wade in waterways was an acceptable water quality level . 
  what is your view on this , and how will act attempt to affect this going into the election ? 
  looking ahead at the election , is an act-national partnership a given should the situation require it , or would you consider going against them in select circumstances ? 
  removed , rule 6 ( and to a lesser extent rule 5 ), 
  you have been banned from / r/newzealand, 
  you 're not helping your case, 
  you 're asking in the wrong thread , the ama thread is [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5q10gc/ask_me_anything_act_leader_david_seymour/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=newzealand ), 
  okay , so how do you then stop people from exploiting lower skilled workers with wages that force them to work two jobs and still be on the benefit to just get by , as we 're seeing in america ? 
  and how does this percentage differ from other suburbs ? 
  it 's the apocalypse remix ? 
  their south china sea expansion is n't really the same as expansionist war like the soviets did , and china 's borders have for the most part stayed the same since the 50 's . 
  plus i think if they were going to take on anyone in the region , they would n't go after one of america 's biggest allies . 
  that 's just asking for trouble, 
  saying that it happens already does n't mean it would n't get worse with no minimum wage - the main reason it 's happening is because cost of living is too expensive in places like auckland . 
  where i work in christchurch we 're for the most part paid within 25 cents of minimum wage , and we 're all still able to survive without second jobs . 
  it gets tight closer to payday sometimes , but it 's a damn sight better than it 'd be if there was nothing governing the rate they could pay us at . 
  i get the impression that they 're drawing a false conclusion and implying causation in their data by saying that the economic gap between developed , western nations and poorer post-colonial states in the developing world is due to the adoption of free market economics , when in reality it 's far more complex and more protectionist and state-managed economics are sometimes necessary to help develop and foster economic growth in these regions . 
  * yeah i 've decided not to turn 24 this year thanks *, 
  it 'll still all exist - the atoms will be flung off into the universe , and be incorporated into new planets , stars , life , elsewhere . 
  and that 's kind of cool, 
  psa : david seymour is back and still answering questions in his ama , including the tough ones - [ head on over to see the latest !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5q10gc/ask_me_anything_act_leader_david_seymour/ ), 
  can i just say on behalf of everyone here , thanks for making this such a good ama david - we may not agree politically , but you have n't dodged the questions and you 've well and truly got involved in the discussions in a way that politicians rarely do - hope to see you round these parts again in the future sometime !, 
  except in a job climate where beggars ca n't be choosers you do n't have a choice but to take the job , even if it 's pitiful pay . 
  minimum wage is a simple case of worker 's rights to a fair wage , and the idea that it causes increased unemployment has been rebuked several times, 
  mfw anti-diameter bias from holiday event is still there, 
  i wonder what they think of our stylistic choices at the moment, 
  to be fair i think anything 's an improvement on hamilton, 
  i would have , but you know , beggars can be choosers and whatnot, 
  ... did you not notice the 100k css celebration ? 
  i 'd avoid auckland , it 'd be the most like home for you i would imagine but it 's bloody expensive and there 's about twice as many cars as people . 
  wellington 's absolutely gorgeous and has a great culture , and christchurch is n't bad but can come across as a frontier city sometimes . 
  we changed the css and logo to mock the herald and stuff for stealing our stuff, 
  that 's probably what it was actually , they sound worse when they 're right above your house, 
  same guy who cancelled on you ? 
  any chance you could share some of this info ? 
  so out of my depth it 's not funny, 
  yeah not gon na lie he sounds like a bit of a prick, 
  that 's assuming diesel locomotives though , no reason we could n't invest in a decent electric rail network, 
  i 'd love a decent rail network in nz , though i 'm not sure where you 'd go for a queenstown one - through cromwell or down kingston way ? 
  why is n't it realistic ? 
  plain ones of course , easier to collect for reuse when they bounce off, 
  technically it is a maori flag - the flag chosen is the flag of the [ united tribes of new zealand ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_tribes_of_new_zealand ) , a confederation of northern maori tribes which existed officially following a declaration of independence in 1835 that was recognised by the british as a sovereign nation . 
  this has lead to some claiming the treaty of waitangi of 1840 ( regarded as the founding document of new zealand ) was actually a treaty between two sovereign nations instead of just between the brits and the maori , giving it a different stature . 
  i love how this map slowly gets more and more different the more you look at it . 
  like , you first look and it seems normal , but then you notice the aboriginal flag , then the russian one , and the weird shit going on in canada / europe / south asia, 
  tbh i think we all would, 
  probably should n't have your bed right next to the motorway, 
  that 's in suburban melbourne , i feel misled, 
  you could easily beat a bus or driving on time and service , and probably a plane on price . 
  yeah , but look at the takahe - declared extinct , rediscovered , and now it 's a conservation poster child, 
  / u/kiwikibbles is our man on the inside of the national party, 
  we 're still considering getting someone in wellington to head down for amas if need be and actually have someone on site, 
  clearly you have n't looked at the moderator list recently, 
  should have asked about this in the geonet ama too, 
  i 've heard the opposite , that it 's one of the most difficult places to predict, 
  shit when did the coromandel declare independence ? 
   instant coffee powder, 
  well there 's your problem, 
  coffee first , then the frothed milk, 
  such a conspiracy theorist . 
  contrary to what you think , we do n't delete questions - many of the ones in david seymour 's were n't exactly too kind , and they stayed up . 
  shit , when you take out all the live versions and stuff , rattle and hum is actually a pretty strong album . 
  would n't be hard to turn it into a worthy successor to tjt at all, 
  yeah i 'm not even gon na look back at those , i even hate finding earlier comments of mine, 
  how is 3/50 `` u2-heavy '' ? 
  diameter primetime hour would be choice too, 
  lol as if that 's a thing on diameter, 
  goddamn those are gorgeous, 
  i wondered about this too - it was a live version on r&h , but that was still the first time it was on a proper album, 
  you with the aa ? 
  i never gave countdown my number but got this text , mum suggested it was due to the recent merger and me having joined the aa, 
  maybe ask in the weekly politics thread and link it here ? 
  oh fuck i hate people like that . 
   i also told her not to get a cheap laptop but you 'd still expect it to not be total shit for $ 800 . 
  they should still work decent for lightweight stuff ( and the hinge should definitely not be broken ) but on the other side of this are the people that buy a $ 500 laptop and expect it to be able to run top of the line games maxxed out, 
  alternatively , only submit the quality articles from them - get the idea that quality is just as good as cheap shitty clickbait for clicks and views, 
  hey guys , thanks for stopping by !, 
  hoping i 'm not too late , got caught up in the cricket, 
  my first question is more of a classification question , what are those [ massive flat-bottomed clouds ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/d6/b0/2e/d6b02eba0766d404d0f964a1f35ffff6.jpg ) you normally see in the tropics ? 
  i 've never been able to see something which matches what i 'm thinking of classification-wise , but then again i 'm probably blind . 
  also semi-related , how common are these in nz ? 
  i see them a couple times round here in chch , but normally in spring and as part of awesome warm thunderstorms .
