  leighton baker , leader of the conservative party, 
   the first $ 20,000 of earnings being free of income tax [ 6 ], 
  given the other ones this does n't seem fairly contentious , mind elaborating on why you 've included it to the list ? 
  i mean you can make the argument that their ideology fits very well in with fascism which makes then fascist, 
  how on earth do you make that argument ? 
  much better night last night than i was expecting it to be . 
  manager kicked everyone 's arse at beer pong and met some of the partners which is always good . 
  helped having it just round the corner too . 
  though hopefully the manager is hungover enough today to not care that the rest of us are too, 
  you 're implying winnie is n't immortal, 
  my brother grew out of his gluten intolerance - spent his first eight years or so screaming a couple hours after eating any gluten , finally got diagnosed and spent the next six not eating any gluten . 
  he got sick of not being able to eat maccas one day , bought a cheeseburger , and had no reaction from it . 
  slowly reintroduced gluten and now he 's fine with it, 
  so much bad research in this . 
   anywhere where [ shariah law ] is applied they 're poor , they 're oppressed , they 're in a state of violence . 
  this is a confirmation basis because of the state of the modern world , and is relying on correlation instead of asserting causation . 
  look at oman , iran , the uae or any number of other gulf states . 
  these countries all have some form of sharia in their legal system , and are all peaceful countries that are n't poor , with varying states of oppression but nothing on the scale she 's implying in oman . 
  then there 's the historical examples , when a muslim leader of a country with sharia brought so much gold to europe the market collapsed , or the whole ottoman empire which was much more than just a ` poor , violent oppressor ', 
  why should every muslim have to speak out and denounce the crimes of any other muslim ? 
  do we ask this of buddhists with what 's going on in myanmar , or catholics / protestants for what happened in northern ireland ? 
  how 'd you manage to get this good of a milky way so close to the city lights ? 
  yeah the oppression side is definitely one of the iffier ones , but i 'd argue that 's the case with any religious fundamentalism and not something exclusive to islam . 
  it just so happens that sharia is the most prevalent form of contemporary religious fundamentalism, 
  yeah , that 's why i said varying states of oppression . 
  iran was included mainly as a counter-point to the other two claims , that sharia countries are inherently poor and violent , neither of which iran is . 
  but that 's a case with nations all the time - they do n't just ` get ' rich , they need resources , or trade , or some other means to gain that wealth . 
  it 's completely baseless to try and say that islam makes countries poor , while ignoring rich islamic countries and poor non-islamic ones that would disprove the argument, 
  yo / r/auckland even marton has a better css than you now, 
  hardly prominent, 
  we had the leader of alcp last election do an ama, 
  we also do it if you ca n't make it to the ama , since obviously that 's an issue with scheduled events, 
   sanitized western ones, 
  why is it that any muslim who does n't fit your image of what you think they are is suddenly not a ` mainstream ' muslim ? 
  it 's happening in a sense quite a bit in christian countries , most notably in africa and the united states . 
  rwanda has one of the worst lgbt human rights records in the world due to influence from christian missionaries , while the conservative right in america is frequently using religious motives for repression of lgbt rights, 
  judge , jury , and executioner . 
  i like it . 
  of course , a lot of stuff like that depends on context . 
  i would say that poms is a nickname just as aussie or yanks are , which has lost most of the negative connotation over here . 
  if it 's used in a derogatory manner it 's very different than if it 's just being used as an adjective, 
  [ citation required ], 
  as far as i 'm aware , it 's one of those laws that can be used if someone is making a nuisance but has n't technically done anything illegal . 
  i 'd agree on play the game , but flash is pretty damn cool, 
  stocktake tonight , this should be fun . 
  that 's what i figured too - he knew he did n't have long but did n't want to spend it in a hospital . 
  might help some of the dissent simmer down too, 
  i feel like mmp is really good as it combines multiple systems to account for the flaws in each of them and allow for both local and ideological representation . 
  the one thing i probably would change other than what i mentioned above is maybe replacing fpp with stv in the electorate vote - a couple electorates have left wing views overall but saw right wing candidates win because the left vote was split between the two parties on the left . 
  stv would help prevent against this sort of thing happening, 
  well , moses * was * hanging round burning bushes, 
  i was surprised , the colin craig one last time was very civil . 
  this one was anything but, 
  cunliffe tried it and it fucked up majorly for him . 
  they need to play it safe until september to try and win , then they can go all full-on capital gains, 
  i have this and the two photos before it on my wall at home, 
  what sort of music do you mean by chilled out music ? 
   of course , it 's stuff , i have zero intention of responding . 
  personally , i feel like you should still respond and politely decline . 
  not responding or being a dick in a response would just encourage them not to ask permission in the future, 
  awesome , here 's some of the stuff i 've got , or that i listen to when i want to chill out . 
  some of it might be a bit fast paced or not really chill music at all , but [ hopefully it 's decent enough ] ( https://play.spotify.com/user/pouakai/playlist/63oli4ywtxijx6m8smqzhl ), 
  okay i could put up with an evening lecture for that , that sounds awesome, 
  shit , that 's three tries better than me !, 
  i 'm younger than all my friends and still managed to be one of the first to get my full . 
  it was stupid things each time too , like not slowing to 20kph past a school bus while being tailgated in peak traffic, 
  with regards to the first question :, 
   despite being a green party member for four years , blue blood runs in his veins . 
   the former young nat and election campaigner for murray mccully describes himself as a born-again green who was `` very blue with a green halo '' . 
  it does n't sound like he 's actually expecting to win ( anyone on the left is dreaming in ilam compared to brownlee if they think they have a shot ) but rather using campaigning in the seat to increase green party vote there :, 
   `` this is my opportunity to give back to the greens and push up the party vote up in an electorate that requires an alternative voice for voters and not just a soundpiece for national . '', 
  i do n't know , though i could imagine having a couple blue-green candidates campaign in safe national seats would n't be the worst idea for the greens at the moment . 
  might even help them swing round and get some of the centre-right voters labour 's clamouring over, 
  i 'd apply again - worst case scenario is exactly the same as if you do n't apply, 
  i 'd assume a fair chunk would be enrolled in other electorates though, 
  the smallest one says it has the bonus of being able to hover on the surface of the water , not sure about the other two, 
  i did think that at first , but then they showed it jumping later in the trailer, 
  which ones were the ones you liked ? 
  or / r/deliberatebaroque , which is pretty much the same thing but bigger, 
  that 's kind of funny , because i was n't even meaning that song . 
  was trying to find [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za7-dzhjjrq ) , but it was n't on spotify so i went with that instead, 
  there 's a 2017 mix of one tree hill by brian eno , which is the only one i know is actually new . 
  not sure about the rest of the remixes and whatnot, 
  looks like the whole of cd3 are new remixes, 
  my pols class last election was split pretty much 50/50 greens and nats . 
  plus the one guy who went labour out of pity, 
  if you were able to convince the students to actually vote it might be more of a challenge , though i ca n't see that happening, 
  what issues do you have with the current ones , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  oh man , if you have the time i 'd drive any day of the week . 
  scenery down the coast is more than worth it , though be warned it 's probably a two or three day drive . 
  from picton , you 've got a [ seaside drive ] ( http://c8.alamy.com/comp/a1xdrf/queen-charlotte-drive-and-picton-marlborough-sounds-south-island-new-a1xdrf.jpg ) through the sounds with views like [ this ] ( https://nzfrenzysouth.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/roadside-views-along-queen-charlotte-drive.jpg ) , then a stop off in [ nelson ] ( http://pinehilllodge.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/nelson_city_dsc06096-e1366855347562.jpg ) before heading down the [ buller gorge ] ( http://westport.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bullergorgeheader.jpg ) to the coast proper , with probably a night in [ punakaiki ] ( http://www.punakaiki.co.nz/wp-content/themes/punakaiki-responsive/images/punakaiki-header03.jpg ) , home to the [ pankake rocks ] ( http://www.punakaiki.co.nz/wp-content/themes/punakaiki-responsive/images/punakaiki-header02.jpg ) blowholes . 
  from there , there 's more [ amazing coastal scenery ] ( http://accessiblenz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/windy-west-coast-road-low-res.jpg ) right down though the coast 's main towns of greymouth and hokitika , then more old growth forest right up to the road on the way down to the [ glaciers ] ( https://cdn.audleytravel.com/-/-/79/249175183142071192071035052026155232111009048206.jpg ) , which i 'd suggest as the second night . 
  franz is the nicer town , but fox has [ lake matheson ] ( http://www.glaciercountry.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2010-05-14-11.35.16edited.jpg ) where you can get awesome sunset / sunrise shots if it 's calm . 
  then you head right down , past [ bruce bay ] ( http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/rimu-forest-bruce-bay-south-island-west-coast-new-zealand-australasia-picture-id76195171?s=170667a ) and up the [ haast river ] ( http://www.haastriver.co.nz/images/slider-1.jpg ) to the [ gates of haast ] ( http://lynx-travel.com/vacations/nz2000/wanaka/gates%20of%20haast%20bridge%20over%20haast%20gorge.jpg ) and haast pass . 
  from there you 're into the queenstown lakes area with [ lake wanaka ] ( https://www.lakewanaka.co.nz/assets/blog/_resampled/croppedfocusedimagewyixmzk0iiwinzm0iiwiesisothd/lakewanaka-newzealand-citizensoftheworld-dominicloneraganphotography-meghanmctavish-travelphotography-310116-1677.jpg ) , and over [ crown range ] ( http://www.sisson.co.nz/images/dmimage/standardimage/sisson-crown-range-road.jpg ) to get into queenstown and arrowtown ( make sure you stop off at the [ pub ] ( http://t-ec.bstatic.com/images/hotel/max1024x768/447/44733667.jpg ) on the way over too ), 
  so yeah , as you can tell i 'm a huge fan of the coast . 
  though you ca n't underestimate it in terms of an undertaking , it 's definitely a two-three day thing . 
  almost seems like act might be your best bet, 
  i live in ilam , and would beg to differ . 
  it 's not a huge student electorate , but it 's definitely a substantial amount,
