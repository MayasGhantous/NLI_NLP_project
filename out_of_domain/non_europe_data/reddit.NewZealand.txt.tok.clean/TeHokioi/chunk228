  about a year or two ago , we had a cyclone headed towards the country from up in the pacific , and it had lined up the northland region for landfall . 
  now the mp for northland is a bit of a character named winston peters , well known for being outspoken and not dying . 
  so when the cyclone veered away as it lost steam , one of our weather sites ran with the headline * cyclone winston peters out , northland relieved * , and everyone had a good laugh, 
  i 'm happy enough with the slide if it means more realism in terms of ability , though i do agree about the tracker thing . 
  only issue would be if adrian did n't actually visit susan , given talia as an accomplice, 
  got to nelson in one piece . 
  holy fuck some truck drivers are a special kind of dickhead . 
  going along a road 40kph below speed limit , traffic backed up with no chance to pass , and refusing to pull over, 
  my first school was kind of like that , we 'd have a food festival in summer where all the different families would set up a stall and we 'd have like thirty different national foods , live music and everything . 
  it was awesome, 
  nah , * ride of the valkyries *, 
  new zealander here , can confirm, 
  just to the left of the antenna , or at least it was when this photo was taken, 
  but that 's not as kiwi as pav , and if the idea is for kiwi food then it 's pav all the way, 
  as an aside , if you wanted to make it more kiwi you could always put on some kiwi music through spotify . 
  we can definitely throw some good stuff your way with that . 
  only other thing i can think of food wise is to try and find some kumara as one of the veges, 
  [ here 's a series ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/37vlql/patea_maori_club_poi_e_nz_music_month_day_31/ ) i did a couple years ago on nz music for nz music month , that should be a decent place to start . 
  you 'd probably want some nz reggae , which is standard kiwi bbq music right throughout summer . 
  it 's got a bit more funk / r&b etc than just reggae too , so it 's a kinda cool sound mostly unique to here . 
  [ here 's a decent playlist to get you started ] ( https://open.spotify.com/user/spotifyaustralia/playlist/3qkhcoyxlwupsusvha5rko ), 
  there 's something kind of special about heading up weka pass with the allman brothers band on the radio , that was a pretty cool part of the trip, 
  was in a car , drove up to nelson yesterday, 
  what level is this ? 
  i remember doing something like that through correspondence a while ago, 
  oi , calm the fuck down, 
  if you show me a comment where he was abusive towards you then i 'll make that same comment to them , but saying the dog should be shot is n't against the rules, 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/tv3-becomes-three-in-final-acknowledgement-that-it-is-no-longer-television/ ) an explanation, 
  i 'd rather it look christmasey than fascist , like all the ones which go with black instead are, 
  awesome , glad it turned out well !, 
  ^ ^ did ^ ^ you ^ ^ try ^ ^ any ^ ^ of ^ ^ the ^ ^ music ? 
  if you wanted to give it another shot in the future , out meat pies are normally single serve things - roughly small enough to fit in your hand . 
  not saying yours does n't look fantastic , but if you want to harden those arteries that 's the way to go, 
  [ where the streets have no name ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fsrpeut2dg ) is the perfect opener for the joshua tree imo . 
  the way the synths build and then the guitar just kicks in is fantastic , sets the stage for the whole thing, 
  i 'd say either the joshua tree or graceland - i 've got cds of both in my car and love to just chuck one on when going for a drive, 
  i could have sworn she was chch, 
  oh phew , thought i 'd missed a move, 
  for some reason i like flake , even though i hate dairy milk . 
  must be the texture or it or something, 
  removed under rule 6, 
  all the more reason for it to exist imo, 
  granite, 
  schist, 
  marble, 
  gneiss, 
  flint, 
  chalk, 
  use some other form than dots :, 
  8 - folk rock, 
  9 - southern rock, 
  10 - new wave ? 
  ^ [ source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaqa4mogke ), 
  i was n't sure whether to include it or not , but figured that since it 's formed as a rock it 's close enough . 
  here 's another five for good measure :, 
  rodingite, 
  i prefer scoria personally , even though i did n't include it . 
  something about the colour that always makes it awesome when you see big deposits near old volcanoes, 
  we ended up selling ours , which sucks because i think it 's the one piece of exercise equipment i 'd actually use, 
  okay . 
   if the communists are allowed to plaster their propaganda all over campus , i do n't see why these guys should n't be too . 
  until you provide proof that the communist party is advocating for similar ethnic cleansing to this group , this comparison is n't valid . 
   free speech is a zero sum game , either it 's all okay or it 's not okay . 
  that is n't what a zero sum game is . 
  also , free speech is free speech so long as it does n't infringe on other people 's rights . 
  advocating ethnic cleansing is pretty imposing on those rights of other people . 
   if the ideology responsible for the deaths of 100s of millions is fine,

  might pay to resubmit instead, 
  what i 'd be interested to know is whether the cost per square metre changes with the size of a house , if a bigger house is cheaper per square metre or not and so on, 
   this group outright states they do n't promote violence , so i 'm not sure where that assumption is coming from . 
  ethnic cleansing is n't always just genocide - they 're calling to ` stop the white genocide ' , which is usually a euphemism for some form of rebuttal to multiculturalism and normally involves a form of ethnic cleansing , though perhaps through forced deportations as opposed to outright genocide . 
   the same ca n't be said for socialist aotearoa , which outright celebrates the bolshevik revolution . 
  [ citation required ] , also missing the part where this is promoting violence unless they are advocating for the same here, 
   google stalin or mao . 
  i 'm aware of what those two did , just not on where the ideology was to blame and not the delusions of the leader, 
  group in the link in op is calling for a ` stop to white genocide ' , which tends to be a euphemism for the ethnic cleansing of minorities ( be that through violence or deportations ), 
  where did i say that ? 
  i said they were calling for ethnic cleansing , not genocide, 
  [ white genocide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_genocide_conspiracy_theory ) is often used by these sorts of groups to describe things like immigration and integration from non-white nations and groups into society . 
  therefore , stopping that would involve some form of reversal , meaning the definition of ethnic cleansing through trying to make new zealand ` white ' again, 
  because so long as there is diversity or integration they will perceive it as an ongoing threat to ` white culture ', 
  awesome , good to hear !, 
  always so optimistic, 
  yeah , when i heard ` top of the minor parties ' i thought he was screaming into parliament , not 0.8 %, 
  my school allowed kids to wear long pants , but most guys would just wear shorts all year round, 
  why would a smaller sample size make it more accurate ? 
  sounds like you wo n't be needing that wine cellar any more ... 
  maybe i 'm just weird or something but i really do n't like fadeouts . 
  i feel like i 've been on the receiving end of a few , and i 'd far rather have actually known if someone did n't like me or whatever so i have a chance to improve, 
  i 'd wait - even if you only go for the s7 when the s8 comes out , it 'll be much cheaper, 
  he does have a bit of an / r/atheism vibe , i used to be a big fan and i do love when he actually talks space shit , but i 'm not sure about when he tries to get all high and mighty about shit, 
  there 's a stall at the nelson market i walked past the other day which was selling maori bread , did n't have a chance to stop and try some unfortunately, 
  how 'd that go down ? 
  any new holes in them ? 
  i feel like we should be tougher on those who supply stuff like this , but definitely not on users, 
  normally ballchy 's hamiltonian advice does n't make sense in the rest of nz , but i 'd listen to him this time, 
  oh god you just reminded me milk madagascar is n't a thing anymore :(, 
   minor,
