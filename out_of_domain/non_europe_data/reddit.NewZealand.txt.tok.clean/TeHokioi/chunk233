  i 'm kind of surprised you do n't have like a cellar full at this point, 
  you literally missed me by like 5 minutes , if that, 
  i 've told you how you 're going to get answers , whether you want to pursue that or not is up to you . 
  nothing of value , except for a couple cds and a broken umbrella, 
  removed due to personal information, 
  do n't mind the second half , but really not a fan of the first, 
  and yet we 're one of the worst in the world for action against climate change, 
  what the fuck sort of time do you call this , automod ? 
  oh hey that 's not a bad idea, 
  yo report this shit , we may be able to do something about it if we see it, 
  yeah but if people are being overly dickish then that 's grounds for looking into it imo, 
  this seems like something which needs an explanation, 
  sorry , but this is n't nz related - we 've got the daily for stuff like this , and other commenters have suggested stuff, 
  it 's not our rules it 's an issue with , it 's the sitewide ones - anything with personal information of anyone needs to be removed . 
  it 's the same deal with social media posts etc , and why all of them have blocked names and profile pics, 
  could i suggest a rotating header ? 
  i put one in for the header when i did the css over at / r/newzealand and it makes things much easier , no need to narrow it down to just a single option, 
  were they north in akl too ? 
  yes he was , both / u/dirtyformal and i are mods, 
  i came to uni for this purpose - everyone asks what i 'm gon na do with my degree , or if doing pols means i 'm going to be a politician , and i 'm just like shit , i dunno . 
  i did pols and history and whatnot because i was interested , not because i thought it 'd get me a good job . 
  i mean that 'd be a bonus , but i do n't want to go off and do shit so it looks good on my cv and to do it for just that purpose . 
  yeah i 'm gon na need sources on this, 
  no , i 'm meaning you should provide examples of it leaning left to back up your claim , instead of making it unsubstantiated like it is now, 
  surely if he qualifies for legal aid it means he ca n't afford to pay one ? 
  / r/chargeyourphone, 
  i got caught in a thunderstorm up in the hills behind my school as a kid , was up there exploring with some mates . 
  being in a forest and hearing these huge raindrops on the canopy but not getting wet was really weird, 
  i 'm detecting a trend here ... 
  i dunno , i think mitre peak is more iconic for new zealand than the tree , it 's used in fucking everything linked to new zealand overseas . 
  it 's like the statue of liberty or big ben in terms of cliche level representation for the country, 
  i thought you were just saying tools are the best ? 
  because nothing says `` we do n't want this to be a patriotic anthem '' by saying `` we are new zealand '' over and over, 
  gon na need a bit more to go off than that, 
  i 'd advise against auckland , renting is so expensive you wo n't see much out of your pay left to go round the rest of the country . 
  well like i said in my other comment i 'd need more info - what sort of stuff are you interested in , what are you wanting to do while you 're out here , stuff like that . 
  wellington is great if you 're after that hipster sort of vibe and has great culture , christchurch is within about an hour and a half of some decent ski slopes and on the same island as a lot of the classic nz scenes , and queenstown is right on their doorstep but has the same problem with rent as auckland, 
  `` christchurch : currently ** not ** experiencing a natural disaster '', 
  how the hell does it take four months to make one stretch ? 
  like others have said , there 's some really cool food places going up and we 're actually starting to get a tiny bit of culture with street art etc. 
  i do like that i 'm able to drive to the alps or the coast without a ferry crossing too , though you do have to go through an hour and a half of nothing first, 
  wellington would be a good idea for sure in that case if you like culture , though i did hear some stuff about rent being fucked there too . 
  either way , you 're here for a year so i 'd strongly recommend you either rent or buy a cheap car and go for a tiki tour round the south too . 
  that said , renting and finding jobs would be much easier in chch , we 're starting to get an oversupply as earthquake repairs are finishing, 
  does n't taste as good in plastic as it does in the cans or the glass bottles, 
   fwb is here, 
  `` doing nothing '', 
  as per someone 's suggestion ( ca n't remember who it was ) i changed the time to 4:59 , so even when being 4 minutes late it still seems as though he 's on time compared to 15 minutes late, 
  tell 'em if they think it 's such a joke they can have the feijoa bed, 
  do n't tell me what to do !, 
   wine, 
   ( that 's my go to ), 
  never would have picked it, 
  i thought overheating was something that fixed itself , you just needed to let it cool down ? 
  yell at / u/deadlift-friday to organise another meetup ? 
  yeah , it 'll be being picked up today and should arrive tomorrow i 'd say, 
  it 's almost nz music month so maybe someone would want to take over those posts and we can get something up there for that ? 
  nah you 're thinking of imperial stretches , not metric, 
  oh well yeah , but it might mean he could 've got home, 
  kiwi here , i 'd suggest [ this route ] ( https://www.google.co.nz/maps/dir/christchurch/franz+josef+glacier/queenstown/milford+sound/tekapo/christchurch/@-44.1635814,169.062675,8z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m38!4m37!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d322f4863c5ed01:0x500ef8684799945!2m2!1d172.6362254!2d-43.5320544!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d297e26ef2fb437:0x500ef8684796ec0!2m2!1d170.1832884!2d-43.3873293!1m5!1m1!1s0xa9d51df1d7a8de5f:0x500ef868479a600!2m2!1d168.6626435!2d-45.0311622!1m5!1m1!1s0xa9d5e04dba4b49e1:0x2a00ef86ab64de00!2m2!1d167.8973801!2d-44.6414024!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d2baa0a7e947bdf:0x500ef868479e5f0!2m2!1d170.495509!2d-44.0086731!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d322f4863c5ed01:0x500ef8684799945!2m2!1d172.6362254!2d-43.5320544!3e0?hl=en ) . 
  the west coast is insanely gorgeous , definitely do that if you can, 
  i feel like someone used to , do n't know if he still does though, 
  join the discord and you 'll find out !, 
  i 'm there , i 'm pretty much always on discord if i 'm not at work or asleep, 
  it 's on the main highway on the west coast , either bus down or rent a car / campervan . 
  the glacier itself has a road and track going up to it , so it 's pretty accessible, 
  they mention `` former head of state '' in the article too , seems oddly specific given how vague everything else is, 
  i mean the flipside of this is that you need to make sure people are n't being punished for rejecting unqualified candidates . 
  if someone with no education or experience beyond high school is applying for a specialist job which requires a masters in engineering or whatever , the firm should n't be penalised for rejecting them, 
  mainly because people do n't report shit, 
  oi , play nice, 
  this was one of my main concerns with the post personally , imo if only half of the proceeds are going to the relief effort it should be very clear that that 's the case, 
  one of my local vending machines sometimes gives out two cans of drink for the price of one . 
  i 've had it happen heaps , but i 've got no idea how it happens . 
  i 've tried reproducing the events and it does n't happen with the same variables . 
  there 's not really any way to verify that until after the auction , but it 's something we 'll definitely want to see, 
  i could totally go for a hells pizza right about now, 
  given it 's probably more common than not to get 2 , i doubt it 's intentional . 
  unless they like selling drinks at a dollar a piece, 
  what happened to the one up north ? 
  out there in the cold ? 
  oh god , such a fucked up dream . 
  ended up having to go watch an episode of mythbusters at 3am because i could n't sleep after it, 
  was supposed to go into work this morning to set up some new stuff . 
  wake up this morning , in a mad rush to get out the door , turn on my phone as i 'm leaving to three missed calls from work . 
  turns out the stuff is n't showing up today and all the rush was for nothing, 
  go for the s8, 
  looking at getting a mirrorless in addition to my existing kit , as i 'm not really wanting to lug around 10kg worth of camera gear whenever i end up going over to europe . 
  am i right in thinking that micro four-thirds has the best variety lens-wise ? 
  is it big enough over other mirrorless models to make up for the difference in quality ? 
  or am i getting five different things mixed up in my assessment of things ? 
  you 'd want something that 's not going to reflect the flash and wash out the subject - dad does these occasionally and will use either a proper background or just the curtains , and when we did passport photos at work we 'd just use a white wall with no fabric, 
  hah , it 's something we do at work - if someone 's a samsung fanboy we suggest apple , and vice versa . 
  personally i 'd go with either the se or the 6s , the 6 is the oldest and will slow down quicker than the se . 
  se and the 6s are much and much , the real difference between the two is the form factor - se is pretty much a 6s in the 5s ' body . 
  i like music so i 'm not going anywhere near the 7 personally, 
  you 've mentioned a couple times that you do n't like doing topics if people request them - why is this ? 
  oi , do n't be a dick, 
  given the replies , i do n't blame him, 
  we 've verified it 's legit,
