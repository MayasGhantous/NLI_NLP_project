  like 2/3 of the whole thermal area , including two of the world 's tallest geysers , was flooded by a hydroelectric dam in the 60 's, 
  even stuff like the geysers ? 
  do n't crush my dreams okay, 
   fake news outlets like the independent, 
  [ citation required ], 
  the issue with something like this is one which is similar to what we face with amas . 
  many assume new accounts posting soft ball questions to be shills , but with something like amas the subject tends to advertise elsewhere and you get genuine supporters who dont use reddit asking stuff from new accounts, 
  holy shit people actually believe this ? 
  the lost park : jurassic world ? 
  shit , that 's not a bad effort !, 
  i 'd be straight up and say that every weekend is too much , but then again i can see exactly how that would go down with my mum so i dunno, 
  these guys are really cool , thanks for sharing !, 
  unlike civ v where they did , in civ vi mods do n't disable achievements , so you 're still able to earn them . 
  which is great for people like me who use a shitload of them, 
  i do n't think it needs a remaster , just more new shit, 
  does halo wars count as v ? 
  same genre , same time setting , same studio, 
  the crossing carpark does 2 hours free , and iirc wilsons ca n't legally demand you pay a fine . 
  you may have more luck in / r/chch though, 
  mfw you have / r/newzealand listed under the `` australia '' heading, 
  fuck that , you could n't pay me to go to the bnz centre , let alone make me pay, 
  pretty sure the bubonic plague had similar symptoms at first, 
  oh hey , i remember this map . 
  i used it as a reference and stole shit off it when i was making [ my map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wrdlsln.jpg ) for a civ 5 mod, 
  they 're not mean , they 're just trying to scare people away so they can make a killing off the real estate prospects of the site !, 
  actually , you 're in auckland , right / u/brooke _ girl ? 
  this may be a legit possibility, 
  if it makes you feel better , i 'm not planning on changing jobs any time this year at least, 
  worked late last night to move some stuff around . 
  tore up a bunch of carpet by mistake in the process , but i 'll be damned if it does n't look better by a country mile . 
  i 've been campaigning for it to happen for ages too , so i 'm glad it 's finally happened, 
  new munster can get fucked then ? 
  which one was that ? 
  which exclusive songs are these ? 
  it 's so weird seeing regulars outside of / r/nz, 
  you can spoil your ballot paper , which is pretty much the same thing . 
  but i 'd implore you to reconsider - you 're unlikely to find a party you agree 100 % with , but are there parties which you agree with more than others , or policies which you feel strongly about ? 
  well hot damn , it 's the soggy bottom boys !, 
  mfw i was in like half these games and still get no screen time, 
  more accurate than i care to admit, 
  you can keep russell crowe , it 's fine . 
  the rest are definitely kiwi, 
  the song writing is credited solely to neil finn , not the whole band, 
  yeah , we do n't want crowe back anyway, 
  nor are they a straightforwardly aussie band , which seems to be what most people try to claim, 
  i 'm gon na remove both of these under the no doxxing rule , it 's coming awfully close to the line, 
  i 'm seriously considering banning anyone who uses the term fake news, 
  it annoys me that the singular of ` calories ' is calorie and not calory, 
  it 's the highest ever result in the poll, 
  8 months of peace and you 're back, 
  if you do n't mind , can i ask how you got into the field ? 
  i love photography and have been strongly considering journalism , would be great to hear from someone actually doing it ( and doing such an awesome job ! ), 
  i 'm like this to an extent , it 's more frustration due to anything because given how much national fucked stuff up it should n't be a difficult job to oust them at the end of a third term . 
  yet labour keep putting their foot in their mouth and doing stupid shit instead of actually having a coherent mission, 
  i 'm having a dinner for my 21st , but it 's in town so i have to drive and ca n't even drink . 
  with regards to last election , that also had a heavy amount of influence from kim dotcom which tainted it a bit and put people off - a major party moving in that route would have more appeal than a minor on the outside, 
  removed , rule 1, 
  went out for dinner for my 21st last night . 
  just before i 'm leaving i got a message from someone saying they could n't make it , which was fine and they had a legit reason . 
  get there , there 's no sign of a couple other people who had said they were coming , but that was kind of expected . 
  there were still 7 or so people for a bit , which was decent and we had a good time . 
  we 'd all had enough by about 8.30 , but stuck around because we were supposed to have people joining us after they finished work at 9 . 
  sure enough , at 9 we get a message saying they 're not coming either . 
  i mean , they were all fair enough reasons ( except for the ones who just did n't show up , ) but it still kind of hurts, 
  what 's the new milwaukee flag ? 
  oh that 's so much better !, 
  / r/chch, 
  did you go to the meetup ? 
  i told you i had a byo - though i should have gone to the meetup , the byo was kinda shit, 
  only need to win 6 more races until we lose !, 
  is it a shorter series this time ? 
  you 're missing the ground beneath her feet from that tracklist , are n't you ? 
  / r/deliberatebaroque, 
  i like the idea of being able to post deep cuts , especially since / r/deepcuts is dead . 
  there 's also instances of local songs which do n't get much coverage outside their home , but get enough coverage at home to be over the threshold . 
  we 've got a fair few bands like that here in nz that are n't heard of internationally but are adored here , and ca n't be posted as a result, 
  i 'd like to see the restrictions lessened in those too . 
  have it like a lucky 10000 thread , it 's still going to be new to someone so let 's let them post it and discuss it in the recurring thread . 
  maybe put it into contest mode so it 's randomised if you 're worried about the upvotes / downvotes, 
  and you 've got people who will watch repeated on multiple platforms, 
  you mean other than [ stuff ] ( http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/motorsport/93816569/kiwis-dylan-hartley-and-earl-bamber-win-24-hours-le-mans-race ) and [ newshub ] ( http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/sport/2017/06/kiwis-brendon-hartley-and-earl-bamber-victorious-at-le-mans-to-help-porsche-to-third-straight.html ) ? 
  it was free to stream on youtube too though ? 
  definitely an accident, 
  they definitely do n't have dailies as active as this one, 
  surely it 's the other countries out of line , given there 's over 50 countries on the same day as us ? 
  what sort of music do you like ? 
  i 'd imagine that 'll get started closer to the election, 
  [ six60 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqnwqsjyyiu ) is probably the biggest one at the moment , they 're huge here and nearly every single they have is instantly part of nz 's pop culture heritage , especially amongst the student population . 
  you 'll hear them at every flat party in the country , and across the country over summer with the new years festivals . 
  other songs worth checking out are [ forever ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jc_z3wbkeo ) and [ white lines ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bncn1beeei ), 
  [ tiki taane ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3euc9pmst4m ) is another one , he used to be part of a band called [ salmonella dub ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvrk0qj_p84 ) before going it alone . 
  he 's got a fair bit of variety , some of his songs mix traditional maori themes with modern dub and electronic stuff , like [ tangaroa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g8pnfn0kiq ) , and the occasional [ feel-good protest song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioy0bswpaqg ) . 
  other bands have had a limited amount of recognition overseas , but are still fairly obscure . 
  fat freddy 's drop has been a fixture on here for a while , but there 's also [ the phoenix foundation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diglc94vx2i ) , [ shihad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggdtug0tgvi ) , [ katchafire ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siysfq6qurs ) , [ hollie smith ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7zwviizrwu ) , and [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yooqisqnjme ) which holds the record for the longest stay at the top of nz charts ever . 
  this is just a quick thing while i 'm procrastinating exam revision , but if you wanted more kiwi music i did a [ series ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/37vlql/patea_maori_club_poi_e_nz_music_month_day_31/crq5g41/ ) on / r/newzealand for new zealand music month a couple years back , featuring a bunch of songs from different bands each day, 
  [ i just replied with a generic list to the other guy here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/6i0wxs/discussion_11_million_subscribers_and/dj318kd/?context=3 ) , gim me a bit to check those guys out and see if i can find something more specific . 
  though i will second the recommendation of the phoenix foundation, 
  i dunno , i like being able to search for new music within a genre if i want . 
  sometimes i 'm not just looking for new music , but rather looking for more blues music for something . 
  taking that away would be a pain .
