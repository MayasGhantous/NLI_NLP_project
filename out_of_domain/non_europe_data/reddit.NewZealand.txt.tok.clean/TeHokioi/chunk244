  like in a journal ? 
  currently a bit of classic inxs , some the who , and of course some u2 . 
  though yesterday was a graceland day , whole thing in order in the car, 
  editorialised does n't mean it needs to be the same as the article title . 
  it just means it ca n't have a bias or opinion, 
  wait when was the last time ? 
   so , it 'll be better to play one-off tests against afghanistan and ireland rather than scheduling a meaningless odi series against wi or ** nz . 
  that was removed for an editorialised title, 
  it 's definitely an iffy title beyond that , the whole ` takes x and pays nothing ' feels a bit biased to me ( for the tone more than the actual choice of words ) . 
  you could easily have added most of the shit in the title as a comment and been fine, 
  nah , they 've already deleted their account apparently, 
  ca n't bring myself to it . 
  we 've now got another week of wait where they 'll go and change all sorts of shit . 
  until we have the cup i 'm not watching shit, 
  yeah , but we ca n't win this week even if we win both races, 
  oh cool , i thought it was just the weekend, 
  6-1 up against oracle . 
  not again dammit , not again ... 
  do n't say that until we win , i ca n't do this again, 
  i 'm going to go back and watch if we do win , we 've got them taped, 
  i really want to know what that exam question with * frozen * references was now, 
  come back ? 
  i have n't left yet !, 
  best question i 've had along those lines was an extra credit page with a blank map , though i did have a tutor make all sorts of pop culture references . 
  hah , for me it 's usually :, 
  boss : `` why are n't you doing [ task x ] '' . 
  me : `` because you asked me to do [ task y ] '', 
  boss : `` well do [ task x ] , it 's more important '', 
  me : `` okay , just let me put this stuff down '', 
  boss : `` why are n't you doing [ task y ] ? '', 
  you 've got a feel for your automobile ? 
  yeah , honours this year . 
  considered law but did n't like the look of another 3 years and did n't hate my life enough for it, 
  yeah , i should have looked at it back at the start , but i thought double major was going to be 4 years as is - turns out it was only 3 , so it would have been fine . 
  cheers , might come back and do something else at some point , but after this long of studying with no breaks between anything i need a breather i think, 
  to make things worse , we could n't celebrate anything until we actually won . 
  last time it was nz against the us as well , but first to 9 . 
  we were 8-1 up , and then lost . 
  it was bad . 
  anyone got a pic we can chuck up in the sidebar ? 
  and then the organisers ran along snatching the rest off the team ? 
  6pm news : * australians have won the america 's cup !, 
  so sum up of the birthday festivities . 
  last friday i had dinner with workmates , about half of the people invited decided not to show - as i posted last week . 
  saturday night was a byo with people from uni where maybe 1/3 showed up , and then sunday was supposed to be with high school mates but we pushed it out a week ( to the sunday just passed ) because some people were n't feeling well . 
  gets to this weekend , those same people have family dinners , others are sick , and again half the people do n't show up - one of whom always has a fucking excuse every time we 're doing something , so i 'm not even going to bother with her anymore . 
  this is why i was n't wanting a big 21st thing , i had a feeling it 'd be shit turnout and of course it is . 
  sorry for the ranting , just had to get in a bit of a whinge before wednesday . 
  on the upside the food places themselves were awesome ( except for the byo , that was the same shitty chinese food ), 
   you also ca n't be fired for theft, 
  you can for this , ca n't you ? 
  then we would have won , because we got to 8, 
  no ground beneath her feet ? 
  so new zealand ? 
  ah , did n't realise it was only a bonus track - i 'm from one of the places where it was included on the album, 
  you can still see the tram tracks , has to be way earlier, 
  i 'm at a point where i do n't even register it , because there 's no chance that anyone 's actually into me so they must just be being friendly, 
  i got bored one day and looked up all the places in the world with something like this . 
  turns out there 's a tiny one [ behind a house ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/terme_di_saturnia_-_cascate_del_mulino-0518.jpg/1200px-terme_di_saturnia_-_cascate_del_mulino-0518.jpg ) in italy, 
  we 'll be one of those countries with two flags - the one with the laser can be the war flag , and the one without can be the peace flag, 
  dunno if it 's wide enough to get the whole sky tower in, 
  ever thought about becoming jehovah 's witness ? 
  you 're good at converting people, 
  you 're doing dry july ? 
  impressive effort if you make it through, 
  is n't that an old fashioned saying or something ? 
  not trying to say it 's okay ( it 's not ) but it could just be a lapse or something, 
  removing this under rule 12, 
  it was ~ $ 2 for just as long here , now just $ 1.85, 
  where are they ? 
  what seems to be the problem, 
  i love how this is your response to literally everything, 
  * skip the subway / let 's go to the overground * does it for me for some reason, 
  seriously , when i look at the world ? 
  that 's one of my favourites on the album , i feel it 's really underrated and a great song overall . 
  reminds me of the ones on nloth or tuf / jt era songs , which paint a really evocative picture with the words . 
  it could also be a tinge of nostalgia , i misheard * when everyone is walking lame * as * when everyone is working late * and it reminds me of being a kid , having that song on as we 'd be driving into town in the evening to pick my dad up from work, 
  oh man , if you 're just discovering them now you 're in for a treat, 
  there 's the whole * and i have no compass / and i have no map / and i have no reasons / no reasons to get back * bit too ( i love how we 've established the least catchy bits of the song are the corporate slogans ), 
  no , it 's not . 
  but we 're not omnipotent , and rely on people to report stuff so we can address it . 
  yeah , if you want your post to be approved you 're going to need to choose some better language . 
  i 'm inclined to think this is different - that picture says it 's for a new campaign pack , not a new game altogether, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.artstation.com/artwork/yqkek ) definitely strikes me as alexander, 
  are there any big wars or anything around 500 ? 
  i 'm thinking anglo-saxons coming in but ca n't draw up anything else, 
  he who shall pull the sword from the stone shall unite all of total wardom , historical and fantasy alike , under his rule, 
  you seem to be pretty worked up about this, 
  but that 's not ireland ? 
  oh nah my bad , given what they 've mentioned about it being a smaller area i was thinking only british isles, 
  it does , i built my base on an extreme sentinel planet for that reason ( and so that i could sit on my balcony lobbing grenades at them ), 
  it annoys me that most flag places only offer 3:5 , 1:2 looks so much better when it 's supposed to be that ratio, 
  op just said that he 's already read it though ? 
  / r/askhistorians has a pretty good list over [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/wiki/books/australia#wiki_new_zealand ) on some books you could try . 
  to copy it over :, 
   ### new zealand, 
   * * [ once were pacific : m\u0101ori connections to oceania ] ( http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/once-were-pacific ) * ( 2012 ) by alice te punga somerville . 
  an often theoretical exploration of contemporary and historical connections between m\u0101ori and other pacific islanders . 
   * * [ a penguin history of new zealand ] ( http://www.penguin.co.nz/products/9780143567578/penguin-history-new-zealand ) * ( 2012 ) by michael king . 
  by shifting the focus from the pakeha experience of new zealand to that of the m\u0101ori , and then emphasising relationships rather than conflict , king re-framed the traditional conversation around new zealand history .
