  i 've seen an uptick in scripts which go back and edit comments to random strings , then delete , so to wipe the slate completely from servers as well as public view . 
  they show up a fair bit in older threads , which makes navigating for this sort of thing fairly difficult, 
  i wonder if it 's possible to set up a bot to copy / download comments that receive a certain number of upvotes and are n't deleted ? 
  i know upvotes are n't the best measure on how to judge quality , but it would ensure they were n't follow ups or average responses or whatever . 
  the legal thing mentioned above would be an issue too , but maybe if there was a way to opt out ? 
  hmm , fair point . 
  what if there was some sort of thing at the time , where if a post reaches a certain level it sends the user a message and goes `` hey , we 'd like to preserve your answer for x purposes , is that okay ? '', 
  so that the user grants permission for their answer to be used ? 
  does n't really help with older posts unless someone actively goes through it , but it 'd solve the issue going forward, 
  swap the vowels and you 're pretty much right - shizoku is japanese for ` strange ', 
  this is a post to see if dividing lines and headers work, 
  #header 1, 
  ## header 2, 
  ### header 3, 
  #### header 4, 
  ##### header 5, 
  ###### header 6, 
  it 's also a post for css requests , if you have them, 
  and how do you say it ? 
  * new zealand to triple its involvement on the korean peninsula , to six troops *, 
  surely any significant intervention in nk would be done alongside china / the un , or at the very least it 'd be clear that it would violate the armistice ? 
  sweet , that 's what i thought - and is exactly like you spell it ? 
  was that a legit question ? 
  could n't tell what the tone was, 
  time travel, 
  i went last year , it 's fucking cool, 
  new zealand launched one using our own rocket too, 
  have you got an example of one such moment that you 'd be able to share , so we get an idea of what sort of things you 're talking about as the basis for them ? 
  what ? 
  is n't that what he 's suggesting ? 
  i bet he was that prick who never repayed people who bought him shit at the canteen, 
  oamaru , is n't it ? 
  for a moment there i thought you were going to dispute paint thinner not being delicious, 
  yeah i know , i was just trying to be polite about it . 
  is the pronunciation difference a thing about how it 's supposed to be pronounced in te reo or something ? 
  finished suits today , so i 'm in need of something new to watch . 
  any suggestions ? 
  also finished the outline for my dissertation , and managed to get a bunch of stuff around the house done , so feeling like i 've accomplished a fair bit today for once . 
  oh shit , really ? 
  heard good things about this , might need to give it a try, 
  shit , first balchy and now you ? 
  awesome , cheers for the heads up !, 
  why are they starting in the off season ? 
  i used to love it , but have n't been able to touch the stuff since a byo that went south . 
  fucking scrumpy hands , not even once, 
  it 's a restaurant where you 're allowed to bring your own booze . 
  typically asian food , full of the occasional elderly couple and large tables of students each with their own bottle of wine, 
  i only started it like a month ago , it 's pretty damn good, 
  so , which worst ever result is going to win this time ? 
  labour in 2014 or bill from 2002 ? 
  be wary of the echo chamber . 
  i thought this in 2014 too, 
  edit : i 'm an idiot, 
  i think it 's partially the meme factor too . 
  winnie 's king of the north , he do n't give a fuck , etc, 
  she 'll be taking the reign too before long, 
  did n't you read the cup ? 
  it 's a pretty cent now !, 
  there were a bunch of really nice flags . 
  i wanted to change the flag , but i ended up voting for the current one because the alternatives the panel chose for the shortlist were fucking rubbish, 
  have you got a version of this in colour ? 
  hell , make the shield into a giant flask, 
  i 've been eating like shit for ages and just lost another belt notch too !, 
  to the nice flags or the flags they chose ? 
  the submissions all seem to have disappeared , but the [ long list of 40 ] ( https://www.govt.nz/assets/documents/flags/long-list-revised.pdf ) is still available . 
  of that , they chose * silver fern ( black , white , and blue ) * , * silver fern ( red , white , and blue ) * , * black & white fern * , and * koru ( black ) * as the official shortlist of four . 
  there was then a public outcry as to how shit these were , and those complaining rallied behind * red peak * and managed to get it added as a fifth option . 
  then in the first referendum , red peak came a distant third behind the two colour variations of the lockwood flag , with the black and blue coming in just ahead due to the stv system . 
  at this point everyone lost interest at how uninspired this was , and the old flag one 55-45 in the second referendum, 
  yeah , but the flag does need to change and get rid of the union jack . 
  the new one just needs to not be shit, 
  still better than the shortlist designs, 
  oh for sure , i 'm of that opinion too . 
  plenty of the options were like that , they just did n't choose any for the long list . 
  i 'm kind of partial to an edited version of the [ united tribes flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/unitedtribesunofficial.svg/1200px-unitedtribesunofficial.svg.png ) , maybe without the black and with stars like on the current flag , though it 'd be pretty difficult given the political nature of this flag, 
  oh man that 's so much cooler, 
  i mean , i try my best , but ca n't guarantee anything like that eh, 
  i do n't know what to believe anymore, 
  iirc there were also concerns about the treatment of the indigenous population . 
  the foundation of new zealand is a treaty between the british and the maori , and from the ground up ( with a few issues ) it 's been by and large very bicultural .
