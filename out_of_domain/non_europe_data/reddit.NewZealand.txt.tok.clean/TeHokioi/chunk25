  technically it 's possible, 
  how did you get the key ? 
  it says mine has been processed but i ca n't figure out where to get it ( other than installing the app , which it says requires osx, 
  edit : okay , i found it . 
  but steam 's saying it 's an invalid key ? 
  edit2 : and now it just decides to work . 
  huh . 
  hillary clinton 's one is `` caesar '' - i love it, 
  hell , i 'm not even 18 yet and i 'm feeling old . 
  i remember watching movies on vhs as a kid , installing stuff on floppy disks and listening to cassette tapes . 
  oh , and the day we got this fancy new thing called * broadband * , which let us use the phone and the internet * at the same time !, 
  why are some of the songs greyed out ? 
  does spotify not have a license for them here or something ? 
  that seems like a fair enough explanation , although even when i used hola unblocker they were greyed out . 
  does it all work in the us ? 
  i was never taught about religion , having just completed my last year of high school last year , other than having to opt out of christian education and a christmas field trip to a church in year 2 . 
  not once did i ever get taught `` muslims believe that ... '' or `` hindus believe ... '' . 
  hell , even the christian stuff was n't phrased as `` christians believe '' but rather `` this is the truth '', 
  is that always the case , or sometimes can you overcome it ? 
  i 'm just trying to think of the issue it would cause when you break an arm, 
  well , i should clarify that we did have some religious stuff in the context of greek mythology . 
  one assessment for classics involved comparing aspects of greek culture to other cultures , which meant that for your individual assignment you could choose to research , say , a greek religious festival and then compare it to a hindu one and a catholic one , which i did . 
  but there was never anything structured, 
  that sucks , but such is life . 
  thanks for your help !, 
  you misunderstand , he 's punching a guy called fish . 
  fish 's a dick . 
  i think there 's vietnam in there too , see the dip in population starting with the 30-39 year olds in the '60s, 
  the other one was the dog chasing the cat, 
  mine was the same , except for australian instead of welsh . 
  i 've lived in nz my whole life , and more often than not get asked if i 'm british . 
  i guess the grammar is similar ? 
  wow . 
  proper zippos here cost ~ $ 60 , i 'd love to get one at that cost . 
  any idea how much would it cost to ship across the pacific ocean ? 
  well then hurry , boy , she 's waiting there for you !, 
  amazon does , but it costs heaps to do so . 
  i 'll have a look around , thanks for the suggestion of ebay, 
  it felt weird when i woke up and saw diameter 2 had 16 people on it, 
  great idea , although personally i think you should change the american ball - at the moment it looks like the uk vs the eu, 
  is it available anywhere other than amazon ? 
  it would probably cost twice the cost of the book itself to ship to new zealand . 
  i 'd tend to say instead it 's the huge amount of white . 
  nz flags never have white as the main colour , it 's usually either blue , black or red . 
  i 'd tend to suggest either a blue or black background , with white and red lines at the bottom . 
  ( by nz flags i 'm meaning the proper flag , the tino rangatira , and the silver fern ), 
  it took a bit for me to get used to command center , but after that i enjoyed it . 
  encourages team work with the buttons too . 
  not such a big fan of grail of speed , though . 
  it seems that as soon as anyone gets out of the base with the flag , it 's easy enough to just disappear and you reach a stalemate where neither flag carrier can be found and you 're just running around trying to find them , which is n't that great . 
  i 'm at a loss for words . 
  they could n't stop at opening up normal conservation land for mining , or at oil exploration in seismic regions . 
  no , they had to go and open up one of the last habitats for the most fucking endangered animals in the world , just on the off chance that there 's a bit of oil there which can line their pockets . 
  this is like if the chinese tore up bamboo forests with pandas because there was the chance of some mineral there . 
  if it 's true that it 's a maui 's dolphin habitat , there is no other side that can justify this . 
  there are only 55 maui 's dolphins left . 
  * fifty-five . 
  * their habitat should n't be opened up for oil drilling , full stop . 
  you 're not just gambling with the fate of a few snapper , you 're gambling the future of an entire ( sub ) species , that is even closer than the kakapo to extinction . 
  that would make the only two countries that have driven a cetacean to extinction in this century to be clean-green new zealand and china . 
  damn , it 's even worse than i thought . 
  thanks for pointing it out though , i changed it to marine mammal to keep the point, 
  not an ecologist , but with a population as small as 55 and highly localised , you 're bound to get a fair bit of inbreeding , which would probably lead to genetic defects in the later population . 
  that 's not to say it could n't be survivable though , cheetahs had extremely low numbers at one point , and today many have defects due to inbreeding at that point , but they 're nowhere near as endangered now . 
  of course , they only had prehistoric man to deal with, 
  huh , i just assumed marine included freshwater . 
  okay , this time . 
  pretty sure that 's right, 
  beeline optics , you may be a bit behind but it should n't be too far from when the other civs are expanding, 
  i remember that post , glad to see / r/nonzeroday is still going, 
  edit : damn / r/civ trending . 
  posts are not civs, 
  it 's not just the footprint of the oil well / pipeline . 
  it 's the service roads , and the construction equipment , and the chance of an oil spill , and the pollution, 
  i just want to see john minto in parliament , should be great fun, 
  why is the country so full of idiots ? 
  i 'm under attack from [ commie-nazis !,

   the welfare state continues it by encouraging people to breed who otherwise could not . 
  it does n't matter if you 're happy about it or not , it happens anyway . 
  chances are they 're going to ` breed ' regardless , lack of welfare does n't mean they 're not going to have kids . 
  it just means those kids are going to be worse off . 
  and that 's ignoring that you essentially just said that we should let people in poverty die off , which is a horrible world view . 
  lack of welfare only makes it harder for those in poverty to escape it , and allows the rich to keep more of their money instead of helping others out . 
   please explain how did society grow and learn before welfare was invented in the early 1900 's ? 
  ( 1930 's if i remember correctly ), 
  well , actually . 
  welfare has been around [ since at least the 16th century ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elizabethan_poor_law_%281601%29 ) , before which people lived in fiefdoms and complete servitude to a small landowning elite . 
  did you want to return to owning slaves ? 
  edit : i stand corrected , seems [ even the roman empire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welfare#history ) had welfare . 
  so , in other words , society grew through the invention of farming before welfare was invented . 
  apparently it 's s9e23 . 
  i ca n't remember the actual episode , but that 's part of [ a mcbain film ] ( http://www.criticalcommons.org/members/ccmanager/clips/simpsonss09e23_mcbaincommienazis.mp4/view ), 
  eh , most of new zealand 's energy is from renewable sources - hydro and wind particularly, 
  as i understand it ( but i might be wrong ) , the current oil drilling is further off shore than what they are proposing , with the new proposal coming close enough to the coast to interfere with the [ dolphin 's habitat ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/maui%27s_dolphin_range_net_ban.jpg/640px-maui%27s_dolphin_range_net_ban.jpg ) . 
  but the main issue is that part of the new area is within pre-existing marine sanctuaries , which are established for the exact reason of stopping stuff like this from happening . 
  optics is n't that far along , it 's only pottery - sailing - optics .
