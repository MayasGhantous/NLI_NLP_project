  tl ; dr : delusional girl contributes to a semi-relationship ending between myself and another while spreading rumors before cutting contact , what should i do ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's not a genre , but i 'm using it to mean stuff like [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cmkx_cj-ca ) ( family tree - kings of leon ) and [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bposxm0rnpm ) ( do i wan na know ? 
  - arctic monkeys ) that has the sort of funk undertones with the bass but is still ultimately rock, 
  from what i gather , the difference is mainly relating to who the prophet muhammed named as his heir , so if it 's just that then why has it caused such a large divide and plays a large part in modern events ( eg . 
  syria , with sunni rebel groups opposing assad as a shia ), 
  how were people able to suddenly govern swathes of land from a distance , where in the past it had been small localised city states at most ? 
  would n't the local inhabitants have resented this rule and opposed it ? 
  in addition to this ( on a slightly-related tangent ) how were colonies treated in terms of political status ? 
  were they treated as part of the parent country , were they a separate entity with the parent country overseeing affairs or something different altogether ? 
  edit : / u/casualcasuist pointed out that i actually meant * state * , not nation . 
  so yeah , i thought they were the same but he explained the difference and state was what i meant , not nation . 
  since that seems to be the main hindrance to un action , what would happen if it was suddenly removed for whatever reason ? 
  this is just the what would happen after , not how it would be removed . 
  let 's say everyone woke up tomorrow and it was gone, 
  i seem to remember a song from my childhood ( would have been around 1999-2003 i think ) that sounds very similar to just the first 30 seconds of [ the potbelleez ' * do n't hold back * ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upopxswd8hq ) , but it was the whole song and not just the opening . 
  i think with similar lyrics too . 
  do n't hold back came out in 2007 , which is later than it would be as i remember it ( heard it before i moved in 2006 ) , so i 'm not sure if the potbelleez just did a remake of it or something like that . 
  i 'm a modder for the game civilization v , and as part of the mods a map showing the extent of the empire chosen has to be made . 
  the maps are something like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/fy1sfws.png ) or [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ujfrsky.png ) , and generally when making them the first step is to get the map for the background . 
  for europe i 've been able to find a huge map with the rivers all located on it that was all one colour , so i was able to select all the water and make it transparent - but for other regions i have n't been so lucky . 
  the new zealand map , for example , involved spending about three hours carefully tracing new zealand off a large topographical map ( if someone ever asks to you draw the marlborough sounds , do n't . ), 
  so yeah , if anyone would happen to know of somewhere that i can get huge maps of any areas ( the bigger the better , the maps range in size from whole continents to just the area around lake volta in ghana ) that have more detail than just the standard outlines that would be awesome . 
  thanks in advance !, 
  why are countries like south sudan and timor-leste able to declare independence and get international recognition , while others ( such as kosovo and palestine ) are only partially recognised and others still ( such as azawad or the bangsamoro republik ) fail to get any recognition , despite declaring independence ? 
  i 'll admit that i 'm a fan of u2 , but even so i do n't understand why people are so adamantly against them . 
  is it just personal opposition to bono / his image , or is ( are ) there a legitimate reason ( s ) that people have for disliking their music ? 
  what would be the cause , what would the new countries be and what would be the ramifications globally ? 
  i 'm getting the error message in the title quite frequently while trying to play civilization v on a computer within the system requirements ( dell xps l502x running 64 bit windows 7 home premium ) . 
  it results in a ctd after the screen goes black , and is sometimes accompanied with another error message saying the drivers have stopped responding and have been recovered or something like that . 
  obviously this seems to indicate a driver issue , however i 've updated and reinstalled drivers multiple times , including completely reinstalling windows once and the issue persists . 
  it 's happening maybe once every five , ten minutes or so when ingame , never when outside it . 
  as a result of an earlier issue ( which i have also submitted to this subreddit [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1fyjxe/computer_freezes_super_lags_on_games/ ) ) i took the laptop into a pc repair guy to try and solve the issue . 
  he took it to pieces , cleaned it out , rebuilt it , ran it to death outside of games with a piece of software to try and test components or something ( which did n't cause any issues ) , then fired up his own steam account to play the games which cause the issue ( which let him replicate it ) . 
  but he was n't able to find the issue either , so i 'm at a loss . 
  okay , so [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ak59xcq.png ) is the first two eras ** at this stage ** . 
  it 's still a work in progress and only begun a week or two ago . 
  a couple of things to note :, 
  civs will start with either aquaculture or agriculture , depending on their nature ( polynesia would get aquaculture , huns would get agriculture ), 
  for balance reasons , the central three techs of the first row ( pottery , animal husbandry and archery ) require either one of the original techs , not both . 
  hopefully we 'll be able to change the pipes to dashed or something to show this soon . 
  wayfinding requires aquaculture , mining requires agriculture, 
  so here 's the question : what do you think about having cross-path requirements ? 
  for example , if optics were to require mathematics or drama and poetry to require ornamental carving . 
  ** note these are only examples ** , and that i 'm mainly asking for feedback about the concept . 
  feedback about other parts is welcome too , of course . 
  ( except for the name of the techs , they 're locked in because of the quotes used from the scenario ), 
  i 'm not sure if it 's the same font used throughout , but if it 's different i 'm mainly after the one at the top , which has `` the impossible on exhibition '' . 
  if you happened to know the other fonts used , they 'd be cool to have too, 
  that 's pretty much the jist of it - i can remember obscure events from years ago , as well as pretty much every country in the world and lots of other information of a similar vein , but i ca n't remember being asked to do something five minutes ago . 
  is there any reason this would happen , or is it just normal ? 
  it 's been like this for as long as i could remember ( no pun intended ) , and gets me in odd situations on both sides ( either `` why have n't you done what i just asked you to do ? '', 
  or through being the only person to remember an anecdote happening ) and is awkward at times as a result . 
  i remember falling off a stool onto a floor when i was five / six ( maybe about a drop of a metre or so ? ), 
  but seem to be fine otherwise if that 's worth anything . 
  often on crime dramas you see the characters hacking cctv networks , pulling phone and credit card records and so forth all without going through proper legal channels ( such as obtaining a warrant . ), 
  they use phones to pinpoint the location of suspects , detain people without conclusive evidence , use said cctv networks to locate persons of interest and so on . 
  recently , some ( ncis is one that comes to mind ) even play up the national security card and glorify the nsa on a regular basis . 
  i believe all of this is done to normalise the idea of police and federal use of mass surveillance , and desensitise the public to the thought of it . 
  i see this in the same vein as the concerns about similar shows desensitising the public to death and violence , and seeing it constantly allows people to adjust to the claim that `` if you 're innocent you have nothing to worry about '' . 
  in addition to this , most cop shows have an episode where a main character is suspended or fired for whatever reason in the middle of working a case . 
  said character continues to work this case outside the law and is applauded when they close the case . 
  this is again in a similar vein to the violence , and normalises the concept of the police , the very upholders of the law , circumventing it in order to achieve their goal . 
  i 've read a couple books on the drc recently , all of which state how at the end of the colonial era the drc was as developed , if not moreso , than parts of europe . 
  it was a ( relatively ) safe , rich country , and now it seems to be anything but . 
  was this entirely due to mobutu , or was the country in decline beforehand ? 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lzr774p.jpg ) image came up on my news feed this morning , and it got me thinking about just how large it would be possible to have the levee before the pressure of the water became too great and they collapse ? 
  would it be possible to end up with something akin to an open cast mine and have a massive hole below sea level surrounded by giant levees ? 
  somaliland has a functioning government , lower crime rate and is much safer than somalia , yet is n't recognised by any other state . 
  why ? 
  so , i 'm sure you noticed the recent trend of posting releases of modded civs here . 
  the nazca , tiwanaku and burma have been the recent ones , with snippets of development coming in beforehand . 
  i thought i 'd take this opportunity to ask for some feedback before potentially continuing with this method of posting . 
  - do you guys like seeing modded civs here ? 
  - would you prefer if this subreddit stayed clear of them ? 
  - do you want only complete civs , or only ones in development ? 
  - what about other mods ? 
  would you be interested in wonders / scenarios / other mod types ? 
  please let me know your thoughts on modded civs here , so i know what / r/civ would like to see before i continue ( or stop , if that 's what is the preference ), 
  i 'd like a gif of stephen 's head shake thing that he does in [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bebya-zbjrc ) video at 20:06 -20:07 - the video is too long for jiffy , so i figured i 'd ask here . 
  would it be possible to get it just the head shaking so it loops or almost loops ? 
  thanks in advance !, 
  i 'm not sure if it 's an exact translation , but i remember coming across a song in spanish that was the exact tune of ' 39 , to the point that i could sing at the same time in english and not get out of whack . 
  if anyone knows of this song that would be much appreciated . 
  for reference : [ ' 39 , by queen ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjuyxr5by2s ), 
  i stopped keeping up with the dinosaur world a while ago , sometime around the discovery of * sauroniops pachytholus * , for real life reasons . 
  i 'm sort of back now , so i 'd like to try and catch up and ask what i 've missed in that time ? 
  i 'm wondering what some of the events would be that could lead to international borders being shaped like the ones you see in the image ( not necessarily all of them ) . 
  also , please do n't just say the countries got together and divided the world into regions with a of $ 1 trillion gdp, 
  edit : to quote what i said below , the point of this is n't what the map is representing , but rather the borders . 
  let 's just say that at some point in the future , this is what the map of the world looks like . 
  how did it get like this ? 
  http://forums.totalwar.com/showthread.php/121456-beasts-of-war-pack-announced !, 
  ? p = 1056343 #post 1056343, 
  here 's a transcript from that page , with the units that are being added in . 
  my question is , were any of these actually ever used in war , and if so when ? 
  is any of this accurate , or is it just complete fiction for gameplay purposes ? 
   \u2022 molossian dogs, 
   can be recruited by : epirus, 
   a heavily muscled beast from western greece , the now-extinct molossian is considered to be the predecessor of many of today 's larger breeds , such as the rottweiler and great dane . 
  used as both a guard dog and in battle , virgil remarked `` never , with them on guard , need you fear for your stalls a midnight thief , or onslaught of wolves , or iberian brigands at your back . '' these vicious dogs do not tire easily , and never lose the scent of an enemy .
