  okay , so months ago new civ posts would generally get around 500-700 upvotes , breaking 1000 if they were any good . 
  recently though ( since about the release of 3d australia ) they 've been only getting around 100-200 , with a tenth of the comments that they used to . 
  now , please note that i 'm not trying to beg for upvotes or whatever , i 'm just trying to figure out if the decline in the number of upvotes is indicative of a decline in interest in civ mod posts , and whether people have become less interested in them as of late . 
  so pretty much , what i 'd like to know as a mod author and one of the main posters of civ mods , is whether the you / the subreddit is still interested in seeing these posts , and the standard why / why not . 
  i do n't want to keep flooding the subreddit with new civs if people are sick of seeing them , and likewise if people would prefer they be presented in a different way then that 's important info for us too . 
  ultimately though , this is just me asking for any feedback you have on the modded civ posts - whether you want to keep seeing them or not , if you have an idea for them , if you would prefer to see them in a different way , or anything . 
  i 'm all ears . 
  i 'm currently trying to create a map , but some of the elements i 'm wanting to have do n't work because of limitations either with what map makers can do or because tiles do n't exist yet . 
  these are just a couple i can think of off the top of my head , there 's probably more that others can think of which are n't coming to me right now . 
  ** ability to set boost countdown ** - so this can already be done in groups along with bombs , but not in individual maps . 
  i 've got a pinball-style launcher thing in my map from the team bases to the central flag , but because i ca n't change the boost countdown on the individual boosts it only works for the first 1-2 people , meaning the rest of the team have to make a slow march up the map . 
  ** one-way gates ** - i 've seen this suggested before , but at the moment the only way it can be done is through a huge and cumbersome arrangement of walls and portals . 
  being able to shrink it into one tile would be a huge help not only for aspects of maps which require it ( such as a shortcut being a route in but not out of a base ) but also for the racing league , which currently has to use portals to ensure people do n't be dicks and go backwards around the track . 
  just heard a huge noise outside for the second time , sounded like a fighter jet or something flying over the house . 
  anyone else around the west of the city hearing this ? 
  by this , i 'm meaning the republics around the first half of the 19th century , like [ texas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_texas ) , [ baja california ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_baja_california ) , [ sonora ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_sonora ) , [ yucatan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_yucat%c3%a1n ) and so on . 
  i 'm thinking either full on all of them ( including texas and probably california too ) or just the mexican ones , but would be interesting to see how history would play out if there were a bunch of states instead of just mexico, 
  okay so yeah , this is pretty much where i 'm trying to figure out a replacement css for / r/newzealand . 
  this thread will be where people can post feedback / suggestions / bugs or whatever , or hopefully offer help . 
  it 's also to make sure things look decent with posts and all that . 
  *** bugs / still tbd : ***, 
  * ~ ~ new flairs do n't show up - old ones work fine , it 's just the ones / u / - halcyon did that are blank ~ ~, 
  * ~ ~ new top bar background image ~ ~, 
  * ~ ~ new central image ( coat of arms or just `` new zealand '' ? 
  * ~ ~ updated snoo and reddit image if we 're sticking with a black bg . ~ ~, 
  * other stuff i have n't found yet, 
  * probably some sidebar work too , ~ ~ one of those maps would be cool ~ ~, 
  * ~ ~ ** new : ** fix userbar to be correct height ~ ~, 
  as some of you may know , myself and / u / - halcyon have been working on developing a new css for the subreddit , since the current one leaves a lot to be desired . 
  we 've based it off the dscvry theme ( / r/dscvry ) by / u/doingstuffcarl and / u/jillpatel , and have taken some elements from a bunch of other subreddits . 
  ** you can see the progress over at / r/nzcss **, 
  we 're still a wee way off completion , but this is what we 've done so far :, 
  * new main image and header, 
  * added new flairs by / u / - halcyon, 
  * added in a / r/cricket style sidebar image which can be changed, 
  * cleaner looking subreddit, 
  * updated sidebar , with / r/scotland-style headers , collapsible sections and potentially a map for subreddits ( note : sidebar will also be cleaned of unnecessary stuff with this ), 
  * new background image for header , although we may still change it, 
  this is what we 've currently got on the cards , but have n't had a chance to get around to yet :, 
  * make night mode easily accessible, 
  * updated snoo image, 
  * post flair system and ability to hide certain flairs ( / r/india or / r/worldnews style ? ), 
  this is n't an exhaustive list , it 's just what we 've noted down as stuff which needs to be done before we could even think about porting it over . 
  but this brings us to the point of the thread - since you lot are the ones who are going to have to put up with the new skin , we want to make sure you 're happy with it . 
  so this is a place for anyone to give feedback on the skin so far , as well as say what you 'd want changed ( if anything ) as well as if you have any suggestions for features we could implement , since this is probably the only major update the css will get for a while , if the past 7 years are anything to go by . 
  i 've probably forgotten something in this post , so hopefully someone else will pick up on it and let me know , but yeah . 
  if a mod could sticky this that 'd be awesome, 
  ( reminder : / r/nzcss for current progress and wip model ), 
  ** edit 14/07 : ** okay , there 's been a lot of work since this post . 
  we 're way closer to a final version now , but it still needs a lot of polish . 
  we may still change some aspects of it ( header image especially , depending on what halcyon thinks . ), 
  what we need now is any suggestions people still have , and for people to check out parts of the subreddit for any bugs which we may have missed . 
  the goal is for everything to be finalised soonish , so we can port a fully polished css over to here instead of having bugs and having to keep fixing it, 
  might be a bit glitchy still , but it works hopefully . 
  still need to figure some of it out , like how to hide the bullet points in the top left , but yeah . 
  i 've been working on a new css for / r/newzealand on the testing subreddit / r/nzcss , and as part of the upgrade i added in one of the subreddit maps on the sidebar , like / r/scotland or / r/europe has . 
  but for some reason the bullet points from the list of subreddits are still there on the left , so i have no idea if i 've done something wrong or if there 's a different way of doing it or something that i do n't know about , since i 've never done a css before and a lot of it is just following my nose and changing stuff to see what happens . 
  any help would be hugely appreciated ( and at the same time what 's involved in getting the sidebar headings like / r/scotland and / r/canada have , if possible . ), 
  thanks !, 
  past couple days now i 've been having to play on centra , since it 's got lower ping than diameter for me . 
  ca n't see anything on my end , figured i 'd check to see if anyone else was having any issues or if i have n't looked hard enough, 
  okay , we 've made a fair bit of progress since last time . 
  now we 're at the tail end of it , we need to start polishing stuff up and finding anything that still needs to be fixed . 
  so if you can , please have a play around with the new stuff , see if anything is a bit rough around the edges that still needs some work . 
  current list :, 
  * ~ ~ submit page formatting is a bit squashed at the top ~ ~, 
  * ~ ~ more flairs ( nz / r/rugbyunion ones , maybe some of the other ones from [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/3b9fge/could_we_get_regional_flair_going/ ) and some extras - old air nz tail design could be cool ) ~ ~, 
  * night mode, 
  * link flairs ? 
  * ~ ~ subreddit title on sidebar ( above subscribe ) needs to be fixed ~ ~, 
  * ~ ~ letter heights in header image to be fixed ~ ~, 
  * ~ ~ condense the submissions a bit more on the main page ? ~ ~, 
  since atomicgamer is shutting down later this month , civfanatics has had to locate a new host , and will migrate there in order to continue functioning . 
  as part of the migration , cfc will go down at 2am gmt for the process to take place . 
  at this point we 're expecting it to take the weekend , although depending on how the move goes this may change . 
  we 'll post any news on out facebook and twitter pages , as well as in this topic , and will let you know as soon as we 're back online, 
  sorry for the long delay everyone , but we 're finally finished with the migration and are pleased to announce that civfanatics is back up and running !, 
  the reason for the longer than expected delay is because the first server we migrated to was not powerful enough , meaning the forum experienced significant lag making it unusable for many . 
  we migrated a second time to a better , more powerful server and are now open again . 
  there are still a few issues , as is to be expected , however we 're still working on them . 
  a few user accounts seem to be missing ( we 've had this issue before though , and were able to resolve it reasonably quickly ) and the forum is still experiencing a small amount of lag , but none of this is serious . 
  forum availability over the next week may be intermittent as the issues are resolved , but any outages will not last long . 
  if you find any issues with the new forum or wish to give feedback , please either let us know in this thread or in the topic on civfanatics [ here ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=550564 ), 
  thanks ,, 
  the cfc team, 
  so earlier / u/jahemian asked me if she could steal the / r/nz flairs , and since they were n't mine i suggested she ask the mods or whatever . 
  but then i thought that i might as well try and sort out some / r/chch ones instead , so that it 's not just a duplicate of the national ones . 
  got sidetracked tonight so did n't get around to it , but i 'll try to sort them out at some point in the next week or so if i do n't screw up my uni stuff . 
  which brings me to the actual point of the post - does anyone have any flair requests ? 
  do you want some general nz ones , or just chch / canterbury unique ones ? 
  any in particular ? 
  so far all i 've got is the three main tertiary ( uc , lincoln and cpit ) , a couple sports teams ( well , the crusaders and the npc , are there any other major teams from here ? ), 
  and a couple local brews . 
  there 's got to be more though , so i figured since it 's your subreddit too i 'd open the floor to any ideas, 
  i 'm currently looking into the ottomans ( full disclosure , it 's for an essay ) and their rise to prominence prior to the fall of constantinople , and all the sources i 've found have just attributed it to a weakened byzantium , fractured political climate and the prominence of islam within their elites . 
  but surely this would also apply to any number of the other turkic states in anatolia , so what made the ottomans special that they were able to become the major power and last for six centuries ? 
  or does anyone know of something that could point me in the right direction , at least ( since i know askhistorians does n't like to do work for people ? ), 
  figured that i should probably get feedback now that i 've spammed up jukejuice ( test was n't working on the map editor . ), 
  updated version of an older map of mine that was too small , but this one 's big enough so you do n't spawn outside base so yeah . 
  teleports near the button connect to the closest one in the middle , while the outside ones connect to the opposite one,
