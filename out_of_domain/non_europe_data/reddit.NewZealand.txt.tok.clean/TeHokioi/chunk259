  ** this is not the ama post ** - [ this is ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/4ky607/ama_with_geonetgns_science_volcanologists_68_pm/ ), 
  as a followup to our [ hugely successful ama ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/4bjbhu/ama_with_geonet_new_zealands_geohazard_monitoring/ ) with geonet seismologists two months ago , geonet has come back and brought with them the volcanologists this time !, 
  given the recent eruption of white island and unrest at mt ruapehu , it seems like a fitting time to ask just how screwed we are when there 's a proper eruption . 
  on the panel tonight will be :, 
  ** nico fournier , ** head of volcanology at gns science , posting as / u/pyroclasticnico, 
  ** steven sherburn ** , gns science volcanologist , posting as / u/volcanodatafairy, 
  ** brad scott ** , one of the most senior and experienced volcanologists at gns , with over 40 years of volcanology experience in new zealand under his belt . 
  he 'll be posting as / u/eruptn, 
  the ama will get underway around [ 6pm local time ] ( http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=geonet+volcanologists+ama+on+%2fr%2fnewzealand&iso=20160525t18&p1=264&ah=2 ) and will run for two hours . 
  if you 're not able to make it at this time ( especially for any international visitors - it 'll be the middle of the night us time ) feel free to post questions in here and i 'll be able to ask them on your behalf . 
  the ama post will be stickied when it 's created so that it 's easy to find , and all geonet accounts will have the fancy verified flair so it 's easy to see their comments . 
  hope to see everyone there and asking questions !, 
  okay , so hello again from your ~ ~ slacker ~ ~ ~ ~ mossad shill ~ ~ / r/newzealand moderators . 
  we 've been busy behind the scenes recently working on updates to keep the subreddit going strong as our subscriber count keeps climbing . 
  count this as the announcement post , with the changes being put in place over the coming weeks . 
  also note that we do listen to feedback * when constructive * ( fucking useless national shill mods does n't really help much , instead try ` fucking useless national shill mods should remove posts asking for advice with no research ' ) , and this is what 's prompted some of the changes coming this month . 
  so , without further ado :, 
  the new css was introduced to much fanfare late last year , and has brought my mobile data usage to new heights with the new images . 
  continuing on with this , our css coder-in-chief / u/dirtyformal has been hard at work building changes to the css that include new features that have been suggested since it was implemented . 
  these include :, 
  * ** updated flair system ** - flairs will now be the whole word , instead of just one letter , to save confusion from politics , pictures , advice and amas . 
  unflaired posts will be given an ` unflaired flair ' automatically to cause confusion , and the reminder to flair posts will be even bigger and more obnoxious . 
  users can also now apply for a ** verified flair ** , which you may have seen in the recent [ geonet ama threads ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/4ky607/ama_with_geonetgns_science_volcanologists_68_pm/ ) . 
  this is primarily for prominent new zealanders and people who are claiming to be in a certain position or something . 
  just message the mods with a request and all that , and we can work it out . 
  also included is a new ama flair , which will help identify and easily search for amas on the subreddit . 
  * ** expanded header rotation ** - i 'm finally going to add new header images in , after months of telling / u/mamba _ 79 i would . 
  this may cause some lag for those with slow connections , but once cached it should be fine . 
  * ** preliminary night mode ** - this is still in development , but we 've included the current version in the new css port . 
  huge thanks to / u/dirtyformal for sorting this out , but do keep in mind that it 's only a beta . 
  reporting bugs and feedback here or to one of us directly would be a huge help for getting night mode fully functional and working properly . 
  rule changes & new report system, 
  one of the more contentious issues with the moderation team recently has been in response to the enforcement of the rules , in particular rule 6 - no editorialised titles . 
  we 'll be working on updating these rules for clarification and to eliminate redundancies over the coming weeks , but in the mean time i 'd just like to quickly clarify rule 6 :, 
  editorialised titles are a title which contains an opinion . 
  rule 6 does n't mean you ca n't change the title from the source , it means you ca n't add bias to the title . 
  on this topic though , we 'll also utilise the custom report options to make it easier to alert mods to submissions which break one of the rules . 
  you 'll be able to report a submission directly for having an editorialised title or not being relevant to new zealand , or a comment for doxxing and so on . 
  new weekly threads, 
  following the success of / u / - chocko - 's [ weekly politics discussion pilot ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/4k5rfo/rnewzealand_weekly_politics_discussion_pilot/ ) a couple weeks ago , we 're going to extend this to a weekly event . 
  it 'll be posted on friday afternoons , and allows for discussion of anything political , domestic or international . 
  we 'll keep an eye on it to make sure things do n't get personal , but feel free to have heated arguments . 
  i 'm also going to trial out a weekly new zealand music showcase to make up for the lack of a new zealand music month thing last month . 
  most likely going to take on a similar form to the nz music month posts , but be a weekly thing on mondays . 
  global meetup day 2016 !, 
  it 's that time of year again , to join in with thousands of redditors worldwide catching up in your area . 
  if you 've been looking for an excuse to finally go to a meetup , now 's your chance - meetups will be happening around the country on ** june 25 ** , and since we 're first to see the light we 've got the chance to go first and set the bar high . 
  we 'll be promoting local meetups here , and will do our best to ensure that all meetups we endorse are 100 % spreadsheet free . 
  if you are hosting a meetup in your town or for your local subreddit , [ give the mods a yell ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fnewzealand&subject=global%20meetup%20day%202016 ) and let us know . 
  we 'll add it to our list and the sidebar to help draw out people who do n't frequent the regional subs .

  ~ ~ new mods ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ since the place has grown quite a bit recently , and we 've lost a couple of old mods recently , we are considering looking to potentially expand the mod team a bit . 
  so i guess this counts as an application thread too if you 're keen or want to throw a mate under the bus . 
  though keep in mind this is still subject to internal discussion and may not end up happening . ~ ~, 
  edit : as per / u/zeros1s ' suggestion , i 've stricken this part until it 's finalised as to whether we 're looking for new mods or not . 
  sorry for getting anyone 's hopes up, 
  so yeah , that 's all for now . 
  thanks for reading , these changes will be put in place over the next month or so . 
  if you have any questions / suggestions / concerns etc feel free to let us know . 
  the / r/newzealand mods, 
  hi guys , sorry if this is n't allowed but i figured i 'd give it a shot anyway . 
  so i 'm a big fan of kaleo , and they 've just released their international debut album . 
  i 'd already bought their proper debut album through [ this place ] ( http://www.icelandicmusic.com/music/artist/648955/kaleo/ ) since it was n't available internationally , and with this new album only two songs are actually completely new . 
  we 've had this thing with a couple of bands from here , where their second album has a mix of songs from their back catalogue to appeal to an international audience , and i thought that may be the same here . 
  on the website i linked earlier it has their new album on the charts , but wo n't let me click on it . 
  i was wondering if it was region-locked or something , and maybe it 's only available to icelandic addresses or something . 
  if someone was able to check it out , and see if the track list is the same as the [ international one ] ( https://itunes.apple.com/nz/album/a-b/id1107254993 ) that 'd be awesome , thanks !, 
  [ removed ], 
  i ca n't seem to find anywhere that 's selling it anymore other than on the steam store, 
  i remember watching the video on youtube , but my history does n't go back far enough apparently . 
  from what i remember of the video , the subject was cheating on her boyfriend with another girl , and the whole thing was split between her life with her bf and her life with the girl . 
  the video ended in her sitting on her roof looking out over the city and smoking , and she texts both of the other two to meet her up there , when they run into each other at the bottom of the ladder . 
  since / u/zooropa93 seems to have forgotten , i 'm gon na take the opportunity and ~ ~ procrastinate ~ ~ post a song of the week for once . 
  i 've gone with a song that seems to be a fan favourite more than a band favourite , since despite calls for it , it 's never been played live ( though it has been rehearsed . ), 
  along with the rest of achtung baby , acrobat was an early favourite of mine . 
  it was one of the first songs of u2 i really loved , having found it when i decided to play dad 's copy of achtung baby to see what other songs were on it beyond the main ones he played regularly . 
  it 's got a raw emotion to it similar to their songs about the troubles ( think sunday bloody sunday and please ) while thematically weaving both their political side ( * and i 'd join the movement / if there was one i could believe in * ) and their more romantic side in the chorus . 
  the romantic side provides a nice segue into * love is blindness * as the closer , and makes the song come across with more of a pleading anger backed up with the great drums and edge 's harsh guitar . 
  that said , it sounds equally great as an acoustic version as rehearsed during the zoo tv tour , where it 's even more of a pleading love song . 
  what are your thoughts on [ acrobat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nha1ths9ava ) ? 
  [ live rehearsal acoustic version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faxjzkxqc8y ), 
  found oh berlin the other day , and i 'm really wanting to try and check out the rest of the songs on the extra cds . 
  any idea where i can get the super deluxe edition of achtung baby still ( preferably just the digital versions , but eh ), 
  okay , so since / u/zooropa93 had a post about not having much time i figured i 'd try and post a couple every now and then given my schedule is now freeing up for the summer .
