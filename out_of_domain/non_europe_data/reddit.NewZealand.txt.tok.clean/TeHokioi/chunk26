  sailing helps support the city with work boats on the fish and whales , while pottery means he 's closer to calendar for the dye, 
  my isp ( snap ) used to have unmetered access to steam , but then they got rid of it without telling us . 
  we rang up to ask them about it and ended up with cheaper internet and an extra 100gb per month , but it 's still ultimately a cap . 
  i 've currently got about 30 mbps download with my current provider , so what are the chances that my speed will improve with the turbo offer ? 
  it says 20-60 mbps , so i guess what i 'm asking is what 's the speed most of the time on it , and it is more likely to be at the low end or the high end ? 
   * [ mirror 's edge ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/17410/ ) : $ 4.99 ~ ~ $ 19.99 ~ ~ ( 50 % off ),

  that was n't very clever .

  i thought the strategy there was make the game so goddamn confusing nobody can be bothered to learn it, 
  i don ; t think that it 's they 're bad at typiong , but rathwer that if you 're using a small keyboardf and your hands are too bnig that you hit other keys at the same time , like i 've been doing .

  i 'm curious about how enforced this is . 
  like , if you get into a gun battle with poachers and the only options are you use a gun or you get killed , would you still be prosecuted afterwards ? 
  i 'm so glad that 's still a thing,

  in this case , the author of the mod forgot to add a `` wonder_civilizations . xml '' file , with the following :, 
  < civilizationtype  civilization_barbarian < / civilizationtype , 
  < buildingclasstype  buildingclass_topkapi < / buildingclasstype , 
  < civilizationtype  civilization_minor < / civilizationtype , 
  < buildingclasstype  buildingclass_topkapi < / buildingclasstype , 
  where topkapi is whatever the wonder 's codename is . 
  this means that for the buildingclass , city states have no available building and thus ca n't build it . 
  they should show up in south america , i do n't know why they 're not . 
  they should have all the proper figures programmed in , so if op tells me what map it is i 'll be able to have a look and see if i can figure out why they 're up in canada,

  [ oh , really ? 
  oh nah , i was just checking that was what you meant , but you edited the change already, 
  big fingers plus a small keyboard usually mean you hit the wrong key quite a bit , which leads to that sort of typos showing up . 
  i know in typing this i 've had to change about four words that i hit the wrong key on, 
  my bet 's on the cayman islands ... got ta protect that swimming pool of money somehow, 
  there 's a whole lot of that guy , including [ my personal favourite ] ( http://i.imgur.com/24lwbqo.jpg ) , which looks even better in [ black and white ] ( http://i.imgur.com/km9utqp.png ), 
  there 's also manchuria as a separate state , which i 'm pretty sure only happened when japan set it up as a puppet state in the early 30 's, 
  i 'm not sure about this . 
  this map shows austria as part of germany , which did n't happen until 1938 . 
  it also shows manchuria as independent , which is most likely [ manchukuo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manchukuo ) , which only existed from 1932 - 1945, 
  it 's after the dissolution of the ottoman empire though , so it 's definitely in the 20 's at the earliest . 
  maybe try / r/askhistorians ?

  then you 're not allowed to complain about the government, 
  well yeah , i suppose what i should have said is that he 's not allowed to complain based on who gets in . 
  if he does n't vote , he should n't turn around on the day after the election and say `` i wish _______ did n't win '' or '' _______ should have won '', 
  i ca n't help but feel that if that cunliffe was the same one as the one shown on the news then the gap would be much smaller .

  you mistake the new zealand media for professionals, 
  i had teamviewer installed on both my ipad and desktop , and as it turns out civ works perfectly with minimal lag when using it , provided it 's in windowed mode, 
  it worked surprisingly well . 
  i sat in front of my desktop for a bit to check out the lag , and it was tiny . 
  less than a second , definitely . 
  leaderscenes lagged a bit on loading , but once they loaded it was fine . 
  controls wise , if you want to see the movement range you have to use the move button on the unit panel to move , instead of holding your finger down ( which is right click ) , as that makes the unit move straight away . 
  i only played the first few turns too , but did n't have any major issues at all . 
  no idea , have n't tried it, 
  you should be able to play it on the go , but that would definitely use bandwidth . 
  i 'm not sure if playing it on the same network would though , that might not need to use the internet . 
  would depend on how teamviewer is set up, 
  i just had a quick look on the web about it , seems like it uses quite a bit of data - some things have it as high as 7.5 gb of data over a month,

  you ca n't just automatically say that all sunnis are bad and terrorists . 
  given the right circumstances , a sunni caliphate could easily emerge that is completely peaceful and not in any way associated with terrorism . 
  hell , until the mongols came storming in [ a sunni caliphate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abbasid_caliphate ) was the intellectual centre of the world , preserving and building on works of classical literature while inventing algebra , learning that smallpox and measles are n't the same thing , and even being one of the first to develop the modern scientific method . 
  during this period , you were n't sentenced to death for not being sunni , and all faiths were welcome - even atheists . 
  yes , this new caliphate is bad and a threat to the security of the region . 
  but not because it 's sunni . 
  because it 's run by fanatical jihadists who twist the words of their faith to support their own means , all the while eliminating those who it deems infidels . 
  a shi'a group would be just as threatening , as would a christian group , or a jewish group , or a hindu group and so on , if they had the same fundamental belief that anyone who does n't follow their religion is sub-human and deserves to die .
