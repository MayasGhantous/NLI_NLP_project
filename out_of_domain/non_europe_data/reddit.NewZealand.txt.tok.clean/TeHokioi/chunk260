  this time i 'm going to go with what 's possibly once of the rarest u2 songs that were actually released . 
  * a celebration * was a non-album single between october and war , and was almost entirely deleted just six months after release . 
  which is a shame , because it 's a pretty damn cool song . 
  the lyrics were probably its downfall , since the second verse ( i believe in a third world war / i believe in the atomic bomb / i believe in the powers that be / but they wo n't overpower me ) caused a fair bit of controversy . 
  regardless , it 's still a fantastic full on political rock song which signalled the path u2 would go down with war and hinted at what they 'd become . 
  so , what do you think of * [ a celebration ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbp64zssrny ) ? 
  last week i went with a full-on rock song from early in u2 's career , so it seems fitting that this time i go with the complete opposite . 
  fez is one of my favourites from no line on the horizon , though it 's also quite a polarising song . 
  personally , i find fez to be a great song when you 're travelling , particularly if it 's in a foreign country at either end of the day - though that 's just my inner writer trying to be too poetic . 
  what i do love about fez is how it 's almost a song of two parts - the first minute of atmospheric , mysterious music , followed by the more upbeat main song . 
  so , let 's here your thoughts on [ fez - being born ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz2zzqavucy ), 
   with algeria on the brink of a civil war , elizabeth negotiates a regime change ; henry discovers that religious antiquities are being destroyed in algeria by hizb al-shahid ; the mccord children get their own security detail . 
  since nobody posted this i figured i would , better late than never and whatnot, 
  given my flair , it 's a surprise i did n't do this sooner . 
  like last week 's * fez - being born * , * the wanderer * is in my opinion another song meant for driving at dusk , or rather `` under an atomic sky . '', 
  in some ways it acts as a complete opposite to the entirety of zooropa , yet at the same time it nicely wraps up the whole album and fits perfectly within it . 
  obviously the most notable part about the track is the absence of bono in favour of the amazing vocals of johnny cash . 
  this gives the departure from zooropa , while the instrumentation gives the familiarity with it , and the result is an awesome sound which i like to refer to as the ` space cowboy ' vibe . 
  the lyrics back this up , mixing retrofuturistic tones ( * i went out walking / under an atomic sky * followed later by * i went out riding / down that old eight lane * ) with classic u2 ( and cash / country ) religious themes ( * i stopped outside a church house / where the citizens like to sit / they say they want the kingdom / but they do n't want god in it * ) to create something pretty cool overall and the perfect closer to zooropa . 
  so , what do you think of the wanderer ?

  ** update : the ama is [ now live ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5ahsty/kyle_macdonald_peoples_mental_health_review_ask/ ) **, 
  kyle macdonald will be here to do an ama in / r/newzealand ** next tuesday the 1st of november from 8pm ** . 
  kyle is one of the organisers of the currently running [ people 's review of the mental health system ] ( http://publicmentalhealthreview.nz/ ) . 
  the project was borne out of a frustration with the ministry for health for refusing to run an official review of the public mental health system . 
  so in september , a group of new zealanders including kyle , comedian mike king , and community campaign group actionstation decided to run their own . 
  kiwis with experience of the mental health system have been invited to [ share ] ( https://actionstation.typeform.com/to/lxj1sb ) their experiences . 
  hundreds of people have done so thusfar , a selection of which have been [ published online ] ( http://publicmentalhealthreview.nz/ ) . 
  at the end of the project a report will be written for submission to the minister of health and the director for mental health , with the goal to force an official review and change in our mental health system . 
  ### about kyle, 
  [ kyle macdonald ] ( http://psychotherapy.org.nz/about/ ) is an experienced psychotherapist who has worked in mental health , addiction , domestic violence and specialist psychotherapy programmes . 
  he is a co-director of the robert street clinic , established in 2010 as a private psychotherapy and counselling service in ellerslie , auckland . 
  he is trained in both behavioral and psychodynamic therapies , including dialectical behaviour therapy or `` dbt '' with a particular focus on mindfulness based approaches . 
  kyle is also a registered provider of acc funded `` sensitive claims '' counselling , available to anyone who has been a victim of sexual abuse or violence in new zealand . 
  since 2009 kyle 's also been an outspoken critic of the changes to the sensitive claims process . 
  this began when he initiated an online petition in 2009 , signed by over 4000 people in opposition to the new policies . 
  the petition was tabled in parliament , and lead to a re-design of how acc provided sensitive claims treatment . 
  kyle is a columnist for the new zealand herald , and regular expert co-host on mike king 's long running mental health interview and talk back radio show `` the nutters club '' . 
  as always , this will be updated with a link once the ama starts , and if you 're unable to make it you can pm your question to one of the mods or reply with it below and we can ask it on your behalf . 
  it 's been a very joshua tree week for me this week , mainly because the weather we 've been getting at the moment just has that sort of big feel to it ( it makes sense in my head but probably not to anyone else ) so i figured i 'd have this week 's as one of my favourites off the album - though to be honest that could probably apply to most of the songs on there . 
  i still have n't found is the perfect continuation from the feel of streets , and still has a fair bit of that magic to it . 
  as with most u2 songs it has a ton of different interpretations , though in this case the religious connotations are fairly clear . 
  the outstanding performance on rattle and hum only adds to this with the addition of a full-on gospel choir , while the theme was continued with a snippet of bob marley 's * exodus * elsewhere on both that tour and the next . 
  honourable mention for awesome live versions also goes to the guest appearance of hugh masekela in the performance as seen on u22 . 
  as always , what do you think of * i still have n't found what i 'm looking for ?

  since u2 themselves have used this song during the election season , and said election is coming to an end ( finally ) soon , i figured this week can be the classic u2-gone-blues rock song . 
  the song evokes images of debauchery and sin against the classic bo diddley beat , before breaking into an almost preacher-esque bridge which critiques american society and provides the song with a political aspect which has only become more fitting as of late ( * she 's the promise / in the year of election * . ), 
  the finale brings in a searing harmonica solo which wraps up the song perfectly . 
  the song is one of u2 's most played live , and has been seen in everything from full band with effects in the bombastic days of zoo tv , to a stripped back acoustic version during the elevation tour , and most recently with a scathing critique of donald trump at the iheart radio festival .

  ** things to consider : **, 
  * what is the status of the tpp , given donald trump 's proclaimed stance on free trade deals ? 
  going back to the lesser songs this week , winter is essentially the 13th track of * no line on the horizon . 
  * up until very late in the process it was on the album in place of * i 'll go crazy if i do n't go crazy tonight , * and was even used in place of the latter on the accompanying film * linear . 
  thematically , the song fits with the rest of the album , and talks about a boy who visited the holy land and later returned as a soldier to fight in the region . 
  it 's a pretty cool song overall , and is reminiscent of the classic u2 sound ( which is partially why it was scrapped at the last minute . ), 
  there 's also a much more stripped back piano version which appeared on the soundtrack of a 2009 war movie called brothers , which gives the song a much more melancholic feel over the soaring instruments and vocals of the linear version,

  if you 've been on here today , you would have noticed the massive amount of earthquake posts ( and rightly so ) - but you may also not be wanting to see them , whether due to the clutter or due to personal reasons . 
  given there 's an overload of information on every news website here , we figured we 'd offer you the opportunity not to have to see it here too . 
  as such , we 've gone and implemented a new flair for all earthquake posts ( chur to / r/wellington for the idea ) and added a ` no earthquakes ' option on the sidebar akin to the no politics mode , giving you the option to hide all earthquake-related posts on the subreddit . 
  you 'll still see the psa at the top of the subreddit , but you wo n't see any of the posts . 
  we did consider a megathread to consolidate posts , but as some pointed out many in times like these need a place to vent , and we want to be able to continue offering such a place and allow people to get support in such difficult times . 
  we hope this solution offers a decent compromise , and lets people still get the support they need while allowing those who do n't want to see all the posts for whatever reason not have to do so . 
  we will continue to update the subreddit throughout the night and manage the place , so if anyone has any suggestions on how else we can best handle today 's events or improve in future please do n't hesitate to let us know . 
  the / r/newzealand mods, 
  tena koutou to all the redditors from / r/canada , who we are hosting a cultural exchange with this weekend . 
  we 've got a lot in common with canada , both children of the british empire who have to deal with a larger , more outspoken and conservative big brother nation nearby , who steals our stuff but is still a bro when push comes to shove - plus we both have to deal with hordes of american immigration threads . 
  to those from / r/newzealand , we 're hosting the folks from / r/canada here this weekend and so as always please make them feel welcome and be sure to answer any of the questions they throw our way . 
  they 've also set up [ a thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/5de2fs/cultural_exchange_with_the_rnewzealand/ ) on / r/canada , so head on over that way and ask some questions of them too !,
