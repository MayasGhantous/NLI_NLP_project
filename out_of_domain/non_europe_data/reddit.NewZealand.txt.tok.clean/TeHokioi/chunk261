  canada is just a little bit bigger than new zealand , so their time zones range from utc-3 .30 in newfoundland to utc-8 in british columbia and the west coast , so anywhere from a five to a ten hour time difference ( with canada a day behind . ),

  okay , so here to advocate for jerusalem 's inclusion , here is the design and a bit of explanation about the civ :, 
  ## jerusalem - baldwin iii, 
  ** ua : deus vult : ** may choose a different type of unique crusader order in each city , allowing only one type at the time . 
  combat bonus when near cities following other religions, 
  ** uu : crusader ** , replaces knight . 
  provides different bonuses based on which crusading order is present in the city where it was trained, 
  ** ub : chapter house ** . 
  standalone unique building , available at theology . 
  newly trained units start with +10 experience , and a unique promotion based on which crusading order is present in the city . 
  also provides a small yield based on the crusading order present , and requires a temple present in the city . 
  so that does n't really tell you much about the civ 's specfics , though it does give a great idea as to how the civ plays . 
  in essence , it is five civs in one . 
  each city chooses a crusading order , which in turn gives a varied unique unit and unique promotion from the ub , as well as a pantheon-like effect as soon as the order is adopted . 
  to go into further detail about said bonuses :, 
  ** crusading order bonuses : ** ( come into effect as soon as the order is chosen ), 
  * knights templar * - bonus gold and faith from trade routes to the city, 
  * teutonic order * - +20 % production towards melee units, 
  * knights hospitaller * - carries over additional 10 % food when a new citizen is born, 
  * knights of the holy sepulchre * - extra city defence / hitpoints , +20 % production towards ranged units, 
  * order of saint lazarus * - +1 food from deserts , city acts as fresh water, 
  ** crusader types : ** ( unit type and bonuses vary based upon which order , but all still replace the knight ), 
  * knights templar : * heavy foot infantry . 
  increased combat strength , and earns xp faster . 
  produced faster , +25 % strength while in rough terrain . 
  * knights hospitaller : * light infantry . 
  generates science while in enemy lands , +35 % strength vs cavalry . 
  * order of the holy sepulchre : * cavalry . 
  prevents enemy religious units from converting cities it 's garrisoned in . 
  +25 % combat strength while in friendly lands . 
  * order of saint lazarus : * light cavalry . 
  gain faith from kills , and adjacent units heal +10 hp per turn . 
  ** chapter house bonuses : ** ( unique promotion , and +2 of a given yield ), 
  * knights templar * ( nomini tuo da gloriam ) - +25 % combat bonus outside friendly territory ( gold ), 
  * teutonic knights * ( christ ist erstanden ) - no movement cost to pillage ( production ), 
  * knights hospitaller * ( tuitio fidei ) - +25 % combat bonus while near your religious units ( science ), 
  * order of the holy sepulchre * ( deus lo vult ) - +40 % combat bonus within two tiles of friendly cities ( culture ), 
  * order of saint lazarus * ( atavis et armis ) - when garrisoned , generate additional faith ( food ), 
  * please note : final numbers and effects are subject to balance changes pending feedback and gameplay review *, 
  i 'm more than happy to answer any questions relating to them and why they should be in the game - of note is that the ai is more than capable of using this system , and will be programmed to adopt a variety of orders so that they can make full use of all the units and promotions in their conquest of all heathens . 
  it 's that time of year again - following on from [ last year 's awards ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/40i4z6/rnewzealand_bestof_2015_award_results_thread/ ) , where we take part in reddit 's annual best of awards and nominate on various categories based on the past year for this subreddit , with prizes on the line !, 
  up to 10 winners of categories will receive reddit gold , so be sure to vote for who you think best suits the categories . 
  ( disclaimer : it 's our discretion which categories win , as gold is limited ), 
  rules and guidelines and whatnot :, 
  * categories must be posted as ** top level comments ** , with nominations in said category as replies . 
  * only submissions made in 2016 are eligible, 
  * you ca n't nominate yourself, 
  * to nominate , accounts must be over six weeks old and active contributors, 
  * you can only nominate once per category , and single posts can only win once ( even if nominated in different categories ), 
  we 're going to put this thread in contest mode to keep the results secret until they 're announced officially , and we 'll keep on top of things by removing non-nomination top comments ( except for the discussion tab ) and nominations for stuff which has already been nominated in that category , to prevent the vote being split . 
  we 'll keep this stickied until the results are announced on new years eve , so be sure to stop by , suggest stuff and vote for who you think is most deserving in each category !, 
  good luck to all nominees !, 
  so it 's stinking hot out and we 're about to fire up the barbie for our christmas celebration of snags and booze from the chilly bin , with some byc thrown in for good measure . 
  come onto tagpro for a bit first , and instead of slip , slop and slap being the sunblock it 's all over tagpro with some sort of winter shit - have n't seen ice this bad since july . 
  going to the beach is a core part of christmas down under , so i reckon diameter should have sand which makes things more difficult , or at least have it a fuckin ' slip and slide , which is [ christmas tradition ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adwmhn7nave ), 
  pretty generic gifts myself - chocolate , socks , other clothes , a calendar - and a pretty decent dual monitor stand for my pc which is pretty decent . 
  how bout you lot ? 
  in a continuation of a thread done in both [ 2012 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/154vqx/best_kiwi_tracks_of_2012_nominate_here_and_ill/ ) and [ 2013 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/1rxb4c/alright_rnz_its_time_to_pick_the_best_of_kiwi/ ) by / u/rraaarr , in which / u/paulfknwalsh single-handedly discovered lorde , we 're asking for your nominations of the best kiwi music to be released in 2016 . 
  the best stuff will be added to a playlist and become part of / r/nz history to be played to death at summer barbies next year . 
  nominations should be top level comments , tracks only ( not albums , ) and only one nomination per comment so that they can be voted on individually - but feel free to suggest as much stuff as you want !, 
  of course , the songs all have to have been released this year, 
  the admins have finally gotten around to giving me the prizes to dish out , so it 's time to announce the winners of / r/newzealand 's best of 2016 awards !, 
  we 've only got ten prizes to give out , so some categories with low voter counts or with mod winners may miss out , but let 's see how we go . 
  bolded categories are with gold prizes . 
  without further adieu , the winners :,

  tena koutou to all the redditors from / r/brasil , who we are hosting a cultural exchange with this weekend . 
  brazil recently hosted the rio olympics and fifa world cup , and is the only south american country to speak portuguese instead of spanish . 
  to those from / r/newzealand , we 're hosting the folks from / r/brasil here this weekend and so as always please make them feel welcome and be sure to answer any of the questions they throw our way . 
  they 've also set up a thread on / r/brasil , so head on over that way and ask some questions of them too !, 
  top comments to this post are for brazilian questions , and in the interest of diplomacy we 'll potentially moderate outside the standard subreddit rules to keep the exchange nice and friendly , to ensure reddiquete is followed and so on . 
  much like our previous exchange with / r/canada , brazil is a fair bit bigger than new zealand and is in a very different time zone , so again they have a three hour range in time zones , all of which are offset quite a bit from us .

  we 're really looking forward to this exchange , and hope you all get amongst and make it a great one .

  we 're now a couple weeks into 2017 , which is going to shape up to be a whopper of a year for the subreddit .
