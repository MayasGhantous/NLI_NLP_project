  already we 've got events lined up , including the first political ama of the election year , as well as continuing to grow our relationship with the scientific community of new zealand and establish / r/newzealand as a source of content , not just an aggregate for it . 
  we 're also rapidly approaching 100,000 subscribers , less than two thousand off at the time this post was being written . 
  all of this combined is set to make 2017 one of our biggest and most exciting years yet , which myself and the rest of the mod team are excited to bring you . 
  so without further ado , here is a look back at 2016 and a preview of what the coming weeks and months have in store for the subreddit :, 
  #top posts of 2016, 
  as you may know , we recently announced the results of our [ best of 2016 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5m1gzf/rnewzealand_best_of_2016_results_thread/ ) voting , where you chose winners in several different categories that epitomised the best ( and in some cases , worst ) of / r/newzealand . 
  these awards highlighted some of the best contributors to the subreddit , the regulars of the daily and the content submitters who frequently post to our subreddit . 
  however , this is n't the only way to measure the subreddit across the past year . 
  as the subreddit has grown so too has the number of upvotes , meaning posts from this year have dominated the subreddit 's posts - 18 of the top 20 posts of all time on / r/newzealand were posted in 2016 . 
  the top five submissions at the time of writing from 2016 are :, 
  no | upvotes | title & link | author, 
  1 | ~ 9500 | [ `` my garden was seized today . 
  fuck you / r/nz , you brought too much attention to this issue . 
  '' ] ( https://redd.it/4or2o3 ) | / u/heavy _ metal_viking, 
  2 | ~ 9080 | [ `` how auckland motorways were planned . 
  '' ] ( https://redd.it/51q56t ) | / u/muter, 
  3 | ~ 8140 | [ `` even my mom flouts the law ... growing her own avocado in her illegal garden '' ] ( https://redd.it/4obman ) | / u/dinadinadinabatman, 
  4 | ~ 5780 | [ `` aww . . '' ] ( https://redd.it/4sef99 ) | / u/tehgerbil, 
  5 | ~ 5690 | [ `` there 's a political slogan you do n't see every day . 
  '' ] ( https://redd.it/5i91gd ) | / u/lizlemonismymom, 
  top comments were a lot lower in upvotes , but many still reached several thousand . 
  the top comment from 2016 was unquestionable , when our very own nostradamus / u/thedoodnz predicted almost to the day john key 's resignation then showed up to gloat in the thread mocking his prediction . 
  other posts in the top few were either based off the garden posts above , or earthquake related in a time when even the aussies came to check on us . 
  again , the top five :, 
  no | upvotes | submission & link | author, 
  1 | 3254 | [ let 's wait another six months ] ( / r/newzealand/comments / 5ge0vd/lets _ wait_another_six_months / dasjryf?context = 5 ) | / u/thedoodnz, 
  2 | 2559 | [ my garden was seized today . 
  fuck you / r/nz , you brought too much attention to this issue ] ( / r/newzealand/comments / 4or2o3/my _ garden_was_seized_today_fuck_you_rnz_you / d4ew573?context = 5 ) | / u/courtlessjester, 
  3 | 1646 | [ hey dickheads hope you are all doing ok from r/australia ] ( / r/newzealand/comments / 5ct6sz/hey _ dickheads_hope_you_are_all_doing_ok_from / d9z6g8t?context = 5 ) | / u/thatblokefromnz, 
  4 | 1518 | [ holy shit this is a long one ] ( / r/newzealand/comments / 5cpi8x/holy _ shit_this_is_a_long_one / d9yc577?context = 5 ) | / u/skamp33, 
  5 | 1369 | [ my garden was seized today . 
  fuck you / r/nz , you brought too much attention to this issue .

  #events and amas, 
  2016 was a huge year for events on / r/newzealand . 
  we had several [ hugely successful amas ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/officialgeonet/submitted/ ) and movie nights with various scientists from geonet , green party co-leader metiria turei [ showed up for an ama ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/4zba0v/kia_ora_metiria_here_ama/ ) , as well as [ kyle macdonald ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5ahsty/kyle_macdonald_peoples_mental_health_review_ask/ ) from the people 's mental health review and former auckland mayoral candidate [ chl\u00f6e swarbrick ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/56qmbm/my_name_is_chl%c3%b6e_swarbrick_unsuccessful_2016/ ) . 
  we also ran several successful [ cultural exchanges ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/search?q=cultural+exchange&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all ) with other national subreddits , including / r/canada , / r/denmark and / r/de . 
  2017 is already shaping up to be just as good in this regard , if not better . 
  as with last election year , we are in talks with several political figures for amas throughout the year , with an aim for a political ama series closer to the election . 
  of these , we are happy to announce that the first political ama of 2017 will be a party leader we have n't had the pleasure of hosting before , whom we will host for an ama on the ** 25th of january ** . 
  also this month we will host another first timer ama , this time with scientists from a state-owned enterprise similar to geonet . 
  this ama will be on the ** 30th ** . 
  in both cases we 're a wee bit out from an announcement still to keep in line with our agreements , so any rumours will be neither confirmed nor denied . 
  / u/dirtyformal and / u/nilnz have been working tirelessly behind the scenes on these , and we 're still in talks for more amas with several other parties which we hope to bring you further into this year . 
  we 're also planning more cultural exchanges after the enormous success of the one with / r/brasil earlier this month , as well as other events and contests still to be announced . 
  #election year, 
  as mentioned in the ama section , 2017 is an election year . 
  this brings a whole host of both content and challenges for the subreddit . 
  as with last time , we 're hoping to bring you a series of political amas and extra original content surrounding the election , and we will work with our local political analysts on how to best go about that . 
  we 're also going to be enforcing the editorialised titles rule , which tends to get worse around election time , and making sure that all political posts are flaired as such so that those of you who wish to can easily browse in no politics mode without any hint of an election . 
  we 'll be announcing more about our election year content in the coming months once the political year firmly gets underway , but in the meantime if you have any suggestions on what we could do , or if you would like to help out , feel free to let us know in the comments below or [ drop us a line ] ( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fnewzealand ) in the modmail . 
  #ongoing css work, 
  as you may have noticed , / u/dirtyformal has been working away on minor updates to the css and on keeping it all looking spick-and-span since he became a mod . 
  we 'll continue to do this into the year , adding functionality updates and adding new images to the header rotation . 
  new features and stylistic changes are also under consideration , but as always we 'll keep everyone updated on any changes we make . 
  we 're also always open to suggestions and new flair ideas , and we 're always looking for feedback on our current stuff . 
  on the agenda currently is polish on night mode , which while implemented is still a work-in-progress . 
  when we started 2016 , we had just over 58,000 subscribers . 
  we 're now less than 1,700 users away from breaking six figures ( at the time of writing this post . ), 
  that 's a huge achievement , and we 'd like to thank each and every one of you for making it happen ( hey , we 've got to have * some * corny stuff in here , right ? ), 
  we 're still deciding on how exactly to celebrate , but rest assured we 'll have something figured out . 
  it 'll probably just be a couple thousand users late , like usual . 
  while it 's a great achievement , 100,000 users also brings a whole new set of challenges and makes it difficult for the six of us to moderate the whole place . 
  the mod queue often piles up and some stuff does slip through the cracks ( as you 're often quick to point out . ), 
  we 're working on updating the rules to make them clearer and more relevant to the current state of / r/newzealand , as well as easier to follow so that there 's fewer disputes between people with different interpretations of the rules . 
  this brings me to the next point :, 
  #new mods, 
  a couple months ago , we updated the mod list to remove inactive moderators and promoted / u/dirtyformal to handle the css side of things . 
  at the same time , other mods are currently taking a break from reddit , which on the whole leaves us a tad short-handed . 
  so we are looking for one or two extras to help out around the place , and are officially opening applications for new mods . 
  feel free to announce your candidacy or dob your mates in below , but if you 're actually wanting to go in the running drop us a modmail and we 'll have a chat . 
  make sure you include what position you 're wanting and why you 'd be decent at it and all that . 
  we 're not only opening nominations for mods however . 
  we 're also looking for a couple people , with at least one preferably wellington-based , to act as content people and assist on amas and other original content . 
  the idea behind having someone wellington based first came about with an ama last year , when someone asked if we had someone who could be on site to help out . 
  so having someone in wellington allows us this opportunity if we need it , which will be especially useful in an election year . 
  so yeah , if you 're wanting to try and apply being capital-based would probably help your case !, 
  so that 's about it for now , a look back on 2016 and a sneak peek at what 's to come this year . 
  we 're all excited about the year to come , and hopefully now you are too . 
  good luck if you 're applying to be a mod , to everyone we 'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions , and once again cheers for making / r/newzealand what it is !, 
  the / r/newzealand mods, 
  had three small jets fly over earlier today in formation , just had them go past again . 
  is it some sort of flight training day going on or something ? 
  kodak seems to have disappeared for a bit , so i figured i 'd step in for this week 's one . 
  i 've chosen track 6 from * war * in a not at all thinly-veiled attempt to be topical , playing into the recent talk of u2 's earlier material again gaining relevance . 
  * the refugee * talks of a refugee girl who has a dream to live in america , and her attempt to maintain optimism while her father is fighting in a war elsewhere . 
  the song is extremely political , despite lacking any overt reference to a single political event , and as such has an ongoing relevancy that other political songs lack . 
  it 's also never been performed live , which is a shame in my opinion given the awesome energy in the song . 
  [ link to song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdcvszrij40 ), 
  ** lyrics : **, 
   * wa , war she 's the refugee . 
  i see your face , i see you staring back at me . 
  wa , war she is the refugee . 
  her mama say one day she 's gon na live in america . 
   * in the morning she is waiting, 
  waiting for the ship to sail , sail away . 
   * wa , war her papa go to war . 
  he gon na fight but he do n't know what for . 
  wa , war her papa go to war . 
  her mama say one day he 's gon na come back from far away .
