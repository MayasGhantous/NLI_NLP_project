  started it a while ago with the intention to have somewhere to debate without the rules of / r/debate or / r/changemyview but never got round to doing anything . 
  if you want to give it a shot hit me up and i can swap ownership over to you for it, 
  congrats everyone , / r/deliberatebaroque is one of today 's trending subreddits !, 
  okay , so lately there 's been an uptick in overtly racist and/or bigoted comments , and consequently in posts complaining about that . 
  we 've been looking into the best way to take action against it , by taking into account the opinions of users on the subreddit as well as how other subs deal with the issue . 
  while we understand that many here see this as an issue of freedom of speech , we are not obliged to provide a place for such views to be voiced . 
  however , up until now there has been no explicit rule against it , which made moderating a very murky area . 
  the new rule against hate speech , as seen in the sidebar as rule 4 , reads as follows :, 
  *** rule 4 : no hate speech / bigotry : *** * any posts that attacks , threatens , or insults a person or group on the basis of national origin , ethnicity and/or colour , religion , gender , sexual orientation , disability and so on may be removed at a mod 's discretion *, 
  this does still have a fair bit of grey area , but unfortunately that 's the nature of the job . 
  now , just to be clear - this rule does not mean we are going to remove every single post that does n't agree with our world view , or that we are going to impose soviet levels of censorship on this place . 
  citing immigration as a cause of the housing crisis is fine , but as soon as you start making unsubstantiated claims about a particular ethnic group taking over the country , or saying that all gay people are immoral or making comments in that vein , that 's when we 'll start having an issue . 
  other rule changes also made are swapping rules 1 and 8 ( given we 're / r/newzealand , it seems only fitting that the rule about relevance to new zealand is rule # 1 ) , and a merging of rules 2 and 4 ( which were previously `` no doxxing '' and `` no collecting user information '' respectfully ) as they had a substantial overlap . 
  the full rule list now may be seen in the sidebar , and we 'll be more than happy to answer any questions about the new rules . 
  the / r/newzealand mods . 
  just upgraded to itunes 12.6 ( i run windows 10 but still use it ) and apple has gone and changed the mini player from something which had the album art on the left and a slim artist / song bit into a much bigger thing with no album art . 
  is there any way that i 'm able to get the old version back without reverting to an earlier version of itunes ? 
  and if not , is there any way to revert to the earlier version ? 
  * kia ora all . 
  over the past months the moderators have been working tirelessly alongside select media organisations in order to develop our new media syndication program . 
  this program will provide the opportunity for those on / r/nz to have a voice on the mainstream media stage . 
  this will be developed through a symbiotic relationship between content creators and partner media outlets . 
  we are pleased to announce this new program and we are excited to share it with you today, 
  ** here is a short summary of the program . 
  ** rights : ** our media partners will have an exclusive right to reproduce and rehost all original content * ( including but not exclusive to : text posts , user parent comments , comment replys and original imagery ) *, 
  ** attribution : ** user 's who 's content is selected to be shared will receive no attribution due to the anonymous nature of reddit . 
  this is also in line with our dedication to prevent doxing and other user information revelations . 
  ** revenue : ** revenue from ads placed on syndicated content will be split 50:50 between the media organisation and the / r/newzealand moderators . 
  we believe that this is a fare share of monetary reward between the facilitators of the content creation and the facilitators of the revenue generation . 
  ** approved media outlets : ** as part of the deal , we have negotiated the right for our media partners to be exclusive providers of external content ( especially news ) to / r/newzealand . 
  as such , content from non-approved outlets will be automatically filtered from the subreddit and users will be prompted to submit related content from our partner outlets . 
  due to the commercially sensitive nature of this deal , we can not reveal what media outlets are involved or not involved with the project . 
  ** moderation ** moderators will be more strictly enforcing subreddit rules as a result of this deal . 
  the importance of public image is paramount to the success of our syndication program , therefor any content that goes against our media partners ethos and organisational values will be removed . 
  that is all we can share regarding the deal at this current point in time . 
  we hope to report back in the coming months with information regarding the second stage of our syndication program . 
  hopefully you enjoy seeing your own content reach a broader and more diverse audience through this initiative . 
  on behalf of the / r/newzealand moderation team and our media partners , we thank you for your enthusiastic support of our new syndication program . 
  come and fight 'em back will ya ? 
  hi bopp , delegate from anzac pride here . 
  now that the void has been defeated for the time being in our neck of the woods , we 're wanting to put the tino rangatiratanga flag , symbolic as the flag of new zealand 's indigenous people , in our design along with the two main flags and the aboriginal flag to the left . 
  is there any chance we 'd be able to expand into a space equal to that of the aboriginal flag to the left of anzac , in the same spot mirrored to the other flag ? 
  in return we 'd help you guys expand into the area below, 
  thanks !, 
  okay , so we 've all seen the posts about how nloth is a bad album full of great songs , or how rattle and hum has some fantastic original songs between the pretentiousness . 
  this brings about the challenge in this post : to take a subpar album and fix it up to where it 's one of the greats . 
  try to be reasonably realistic ( eg . 
  do n't go and add ` one ' or streets to rattle and hum , but feel free to add / remove songs from that era , b-sides and so on . 
  hell , even if the song was n't quite finished .

  not exactly sure what genre it counts as beyond the generic ones , but all of these albums have the same sort of feel to them , and are great for road trips etc. 
  i 'd love to find any other songs or albums with a similar sort of sound to them if possible !, 
  examples :,

  kia ora everyone , mods of / r/newzealand here . 
  this is part 1 of a potentially two part post in which we 're aiming to develop a resource for the subreddit to help those who may be suffering from anxiety , depression , or any other host of mental health issues . 
  we had originally talked about this following [ jono pryor 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5zpc9u/jono_was_right/ ) message on television a couple months ago , but because all of us on the mod team are slackers and were too busy shilling for the chinese nothing 's happened until now . 
  this post will collate resources from the community , and part 2 will either be a separate post on here or the wiki , though we may just use this post if need be . 
  ## what is this ? 
  the goal of this first post is to collate resources as a community - where to go , who to call , how to navigate the system or reach out - anything related to the topic . 
  we all know someone who has been through this , or have been through it personally , and want to make clear that no-one should be alone in facing this , and that it 's okay to reach out for help . 
  to this end , we also want to make sure / r/newzealand provides a supportive environment where people feel comfortable to talk about stuff they 're dealing with , to lend a sympathetic and understanding ear should they want it .
