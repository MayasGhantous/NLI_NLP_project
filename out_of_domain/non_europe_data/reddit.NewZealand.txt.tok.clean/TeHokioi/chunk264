  ## why now ? 
  new zealand 's suicide rate is at an all-time high , and our teen suicide rate is the highest in the developed world . 
  i 've personally seen too many times the impact of suicide first-hand - schoolmates , siblings of close friends and colleagues - people who thought there was no way out , and were gone far too young . 
  i 've also seen some of my best friends go down that road , but thankfully sought help and are now in a much better space . 
  our suicide rates are appalling , and as the people 's mental health review ( published yesterday ) states , our mental health system is n't much better . 
  this is all the more reason to have this conversation , and create resources which help people to navigate the system and get the help they need .

  kia ora everyone , mods of / r/newzealand here . 
  this is part 1 of a potentially two part post in which we 're aiming to develop a resource for the subreddit to help those who may be suffering from anxiety , depression , or any other host of mental health issues . 
  we had originally talked about this following [ jono pryor 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5zpc9u/jono_was_right/ ) message on television a couple months ago , but because all of us on the mod team are slackers and were too busy shilling for the chinese nothing 's happened until now . 
  this post will collate resources from the community , and part 2 will either be a separate post on here or the wiki , though we may just use this post if need be . 
  ## what is this ? 
  the goal of this first post is to collate resources as a community - where to go , who to call , how to navigate the system or reach out - anything related to the topic . 
  we all know someone who has been through this , or have been through it personally , and want to make clear that no-one should be alone in facing this , and that it 's okay to reach out for help . 
  to this end , we also want to make sure / r/newzealand provides a supportive environment where people feel comfortable to talk about stuff they 're dealing with , to lend a sympathetic and understanding ear should they want it .
