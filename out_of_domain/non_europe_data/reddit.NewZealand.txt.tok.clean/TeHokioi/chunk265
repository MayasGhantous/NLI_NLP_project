  i 've played a ton and have only won a single soccer ball flair and no football one , despite other people having upwards of seven footballs . 
  are they just random amongst the winning team , or is there something i should be doing to increase chances ? 
  some comments based on listening to it :, 
  the mixing on the live tracks is fantastic - think the new choir version of ishf , but for the whole concert . 
  exit is amazing , october is really cool , and 40 is 40 . 
  mlk sounds almost a bit sped up though . 
  jacknife lee 's remix of bullet is really cool , it 's a sort of cyberpunk blues song . 
  daniel lanois ' with or without you sounds like as if they 'd released it on the unforgettable fire instead . 
  there 's also a really cool alternate mix of ishf from lillywhite in 1987 that almost sounds like a demo , more raw and acoustic , with the whole band joining in for singing `` but i still have n't found what i 'm looking for '', 
  edit : sounds like there 's an extra verse in flood 's remix of streets that i have n't heard before , too, 
  hi everyone , so we 've been watching with great fun from over here in ~ ~ the colonies ~ ~ new zealand , and we 've come to notice how many issues there are with your fpp system - not that you 're unaware of that . 
  now , there are just as many issues with proportional representation , but what we use over here is a mix of the two known as mixed member proportional . 
  cgp grey does a great video explaining it [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0i-sdosxu ) , but the tldr is that you get two votes - one for your local seat and one for your party vote , and both go into parliament . 
  obviously there are a lot of things that would need to be addressed if it were to be implemented in the uk ( 1300 strong parliament might be a * bit * big ) but as far as a quick and dirty implementation on a saturday morning this is what i 've come up with if you had the same results with mmp, 
  before i go any further , some caveats etc :, 
  the seat number has been doubled , so you 've got a 1300 strong house of commons . 
  this is way too big , and you 'd instead cut the number of constituencies imo, 
  people would vote differently if they had two votes , and would be more likely to support minor parties which do n't stand a chance in a constituency, 
  i 've kept a 1 % threshold and the coattails rules, 
  1 % threshold means that if a party does n't win a constituency , it needs at least 1 % of the vote to get in to parliament, 
  coattails means that if a party gets less than 1 % , but wins a constituency , it is allowed additional list mps to represent their percentage, 
  the current votes disproportionately benefit national parties , as they 're on the ballot across the country . 
  regional parties may gain a larger portion of the vote if the party vote was conducted on a national scale . 
  with these established , how the results would have turned out :, 
  party | vote % | constituencies | list mps | total, 
  conservatives | 42.45 | 318 | 242 | 560, 
  liberal democrats | 7.36 | 12 | 85 | 97, 
  scottish national party | 3.04 | 35 | 5 | 40, 
  uk independence party | 1.85 | 0 | 24 | 24, 
  greens | 1.63 | 1 | 21 | 22, 
  democratic unionist party | 0.91 | 10 | 2 | 12, 
  independent | 0.45 | 1 | 0 | 1, 
  the independent candidate brings the total to 1301 , which is a slight overhang but not uncommon with mmp . 
  feel free to point out errors and stuff , it 's early over here and this is far more maths than i 'm comfortable with . 
  the upshot of this is that no-one reaches the 651 majority needed , but this is the standard for mmp and coalition governments are far more common - we have n't had a majority government here since mmp was introduced in 1996 . 
  i 've been re-watching some concert videos , and it got me to wondering if there are any ` studio ' versions of some of the remixes they do . 
  i know there 's the [ fish out of water ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwfajxmoz6q ) mix of ebttrt , which they seem to have performed live since 360 , but are there any others ? 
  a lot of the zoo tv ones would be awesome ( especially rtss or lemon ) or even the way they performed zooropa in the i+e tour, 
  so as you may have noticed , things are a bit more political than usual lately . 
  we 're about to go into the most exciting time in nz politics , which of course brings its own set of challenges as a subreddit . 
  as such , we need to work together to try and make sure we provide the best possible experience for everyone involved , and make people feel welcome regardless of political affiliation . 
  to achieve this , we 've got a lot lined up over the coming months , and we 'd love for you all to get involved . 
  to give a bit of an outline on subreddit things :, 
  #the politics flair and no-politics mode, 
  i know i said it was upcoming stuff , but we 're going to start with this . 
  we 've got the no politics mode in the sidebar , which filters out all political posts , but in order for this to work we 'd like to remind you to ** please flair all political posts as ** *** politics . 
  *** this allows the css to filter it out for those who do n't want to see it . 
  so over the next couple of months , we ask users to be extra vigilant when it comes to flairing their posts . 
  if it 's a post that 's purely political , please flair it as such . 
  if it 's a self post where you 're discussing politics , we want you to have it flaired as politics , too . 
  this only works on the web version of r/newzealand and when using the css , and not on any mobile apps unfortanely . 
  #shilling , new users , and party flairs, 
  given the vast array of amas we 'll be hosting , it 's important to keep in mind the difference between shills and genuine users . 
  politicians and other ama guests will announce the amas on other social media channels too , and give their supporters the opportunity to get involved - some of which will be new to the subreddit . 
  ** these are not shills ** - there will be some softball questions , but * please * do n't be rude to people who are just new accounts , as they may be genuine . 
  if you do think someone is shilling , * let us know * . 
  we 've already had a couple incidents with certain political parties having shills , but we will investigate and deal with them if you suspect something . 
  we would also like to offer users the ability to get a special flair if they are involved with a political party , so they can be seen as an authority on said party , their policies and so on . 
  if you 'd like to get this flair , message the mods with proof of your involvement and we can hook it up for you . 
  #ask me anythings, 
  we 've already announced amas with [ david seymour ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/6s0w47/ama_with_david_seymour_leader_of_the_act_party/ ) and [ the green party ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/6sz60x/announcing_an_ama_with_multiple_members_of_the/ ) to take place this week , and we 'll only be getting more involved as we get closer to the time . 
  if you have someone you 'd like to suggest for an ama or someone whom you have contact with and you 'd be willing to coordinate one with , let us know and we 'd be more than happy to jump on board . 
  #election day, 
  we 're busy underway planning our coverage for election night itself , and we 'll let you know more details closer to the time . 
  we 're working alongside community leaders and politically active members ( such as / u/kiwikibbles with his amazing member 's day updates ) to coordinate a live thread on election night , but we 're in need of more hands on deck . 
  if you 've read this far you can probably guess where this is going , but if you 'd like to get involved * please let us know !, 
  #new mods, 
  given the nature of election season , we 're in the market for a new mod or two to help manage the additional pressures the season puts on us . 
  it can either be a temporary or a permanent thing , depending on how things go and how committed you are and so on . 
  feel free to nominate yourself or dob in your mates , we 'll sort out the nominations and get someone right into the position soon . 
  there 's probably stuff i 've forgotten , but we 'll let you know if that 's the case . 
  hopefully you 're as excited as we are and are ready to make this election a great one !, 
  the / r/newzealand mods, 
  since atlas rises came out , i figured i 'd start over with a fresh slate and see how the early game played out . 
  so of course , i 'm now finding all this stuff which needs hazmat gauntlets , all the atlas pass doors , no room to carry anything and so on . 
  it was also so much easier in 1.0 to find blueprints , i 'm fully regretting the fresh start . 
  sorry about this post , just needed to vent to someone about it, 
  alright , so it 's been a while since we 've had one of these , and with the joshua tree tour on a break ~ ~ and given i 've got an essay to procrastinate ~ ~ i figured we should bring it back for a week .
