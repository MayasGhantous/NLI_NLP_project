  that is what the threat is , and what would lead to the claimed terrorism involvement . 
  not the fact that they 're sunnis . 
  that 's why i said ` given the right circumstances ', 
  i 've been wanting a modded civ of the month for a while , would give me a reason to finish the civs on time for once . 
  would be great to get some actual feedback from gameplay as opposed to feedback from looking at the stats , since some stuff looks op on paper but is n't and vice-versa . 
  use your influence as former head of security to stop the audit !, 
  well , i 'd say that 's a fair bit better than execution . 
  yeah , wikipedia seems to think there are at least 9 , but there are probably more subspecies within those, 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( http://xkcd.com/605/ ), 
  well then , you 'd best be getting busy making those circumstances happen !,

  it takes a special kind of supreme leader to ride an extinct bird the size of an elephant,

  officially a u2 cover , but nothing more than one or two lines in the chorus remain from the old song , so i hope it 's counted as different enough, 
  greenmangaming also offered the spain & inca dlc , when it became available ( i.e. 
  as soon as spain & inca was released in december 2010 , people who preordered from gmg got it for free ), 
  * chain of the earth * - domestic sea trade routes yield gold when connected to a conquered city . 
  naval units gain a 10 % combat bonus against cities for every 10 gold per turn , up to 40 % . 
  * unique unit : * baghlah , caravel replacement . 
  gains additional movement and sight and begins with 1 additional experience for every 3 net gold produced by the empire , to a max of 30 xp . 
  * unique building : * minaa ' , replaces harbor . 
  causes any enemy naval unit ending its turn next to this city to take a small amount of damage . 
  in addition , the minaa ' increases production toward naval units by 5 % for every trade route departing the city , as well as the regular effects of a harbor .

  [ direct download ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/01hobmk7z2z37s5/oman%20civilization%20%28v%201%29.civ5mod ) | [ steam workshop ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=280833300&amp;tscn=1404472519 ), 
  i took it as a joke , given his post was complaining about the very same thing , was n't it ? 
  the singular focus is fully intentional - use the ub to increase gold and train naval units , which you use to conquer cities , which then gives you more gold , which makes the uu better at conquering cities , and so on . 
  full blown economic naval civ . 
  looks like a history channel title scene for something, 
  you can either have a look through my shared files on steam [ here ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/pouakai/myworkshopfiles/ ) or have a look at the more civs topic [ here ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=494241 ), 
  it 's 50-50 . 
  most of the time we try to fit the mechanics around the civ based on historical circumstances , but then sometimes in the course of discussing a civ 's mechanics we 'll thing `` oh , that would be better suited for oman '' or whatever , and go from there, 
  yeah , we did think of that . 
  as it stands now naval units can be as good against cities as siege units when you 've got the bonus vs cities promotions that naval melee get , but capping it at 40 % means that it 's possible to mount a defense . 
  plus it 's only against cities , so if you 've got a good navy you can take them out before they get there . 
  gedemon 's yet ( not ) another earth map pack , which has a giant earth map that 's bigger than huge ( 180 x 94 or something ) that has true start location , which is why oman is actually in oman, 
  we 've got about 15 in progress, 
  nope . 
  bnw gives us so many extra options and the majority of people have it , there 's no point most of the time in releasing a civ for vanilla, 
  there 's the civilization v sdk , which can be found on the tools menu of steam , but i 'd suggest checking out the [ tutorial section ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=394 ) at civfanatics , which should show you exactly how to do everything . 
  the modders there are more than happy to answer questions too ( although post them in the main c&c section , not tutorials ), 
  thanks !, 
  yeah , i noticed that while i was having a playthrough to look for bugs . 
  during golden ages your baghlahs are extremely powerful , since if you 've got a barracks and armory in the city you can give them all three bonus vs city promotions , which stack with the 40 % bonus from the ua and make the baghlah a siege weapon, 
  yep , it still has all standard harbor benefits, 
  i believe it should be [ ibadi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ibadi ), 
  all of our new civs have full tsl support with ynaemp , and we 're working on updates for the older civs to bring tsl support , music and standard updates to them, 
  whoops , forgot to add the dl links to the post . 
  direct download is [ here ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/01hobmk7z2z37s5/oman%20civilization%20%28v%201%29.civ5mod ), 
  not directly from me , but the knights of st. john might make an appearance elsewhere ... 
  i was selling all of my luxuries in my playthrough , gave me enough gpt to max out the benefits, 
  i could have sworn that it said somewhere he was the iman of oman . 
  oh well , we 'll need to update it again soon with more support and models etc , so that change can be made then, 
  well , of the ones we 've revealed there is a split of the polynesian civ into four ( rapa nui , hawaii , maori and tonga ) , a greek split into four civs ( macedon , sparta , athens and thrace ) , then there are individual civs of the minoans , gaul , the ashanti , khmer and about 10 more that we have n't announced . 
  not voiced and animated , it 's still a 2d leaderscene . 
  the only voiceover is the dom, 
  that 's pretty interesting - you 've got pretty much the same percentage of both the major left wing and the major right wing party, 
  is there any way to change the image it picks up ? 
  i 've got civilization v and the civilization v sdk on my most played list , and they both have the same image , so i have no idea which one is which . 
  alternatively , i 've currently got a modified version of the skyrim launcher ( looks like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/widpaet.jpg ) ) - how hard would it be to add the images to that ? 
  [ what was that ? 
  nah , the skyrim launcher is what the names are down the right hand side , it 's part of a [ skyrim skin pack ] ( http://axerron.deviantart.com/art/skyrim-rainmeter-suite-v2-283817269 ) - clicking on the names launches the relevant application , but i 'm wondering if it would be possible to have the images instead of the names for some of them, 
  yeah , but i 've got another 900 hours in the sdk too, 
  oh , of course - i 've done that already and changed the font . 
  what i 'm wondering is how hard it would be to get the images linked to it from steam, 
  when you liberate them , gift them tonnes of settlers and military units, 
  spain won the tournament overall , but they lost a group stage match to switzerland . 
  nz , on the other hand , drew in every single match , meaning technically they were undefeated . 
  shhhh ... we 'll leave that part out when talking about the world cup ... 
  edit : we 'll , not we, 
  whoops , that one was a typo, 
  well yeah , i 'm from nz and i knew that we drew in the wc games , but i did n't know it meant that we were undefeated, 
  what do you suggest instead ? 
  nah , it 's night down there at the moment . 
  wo n't be long now though until it 's sunrise , and then we 'll be finally going into summer !, 
  during the congo crisis , which happened after belgium gave the congo independence and left a power vacuum , the country became divided into [ four areas of control ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/kongo_1961_map_en.png/1024px-kongo_1961_map_en.png ) . 
  katanga was probably the most likely to succeed of the four , but ultimately they all became absorbed into mobutu 's control , who proceeded to run the country into the ground . 
  mobutu 's control lead to the country being one of the poorest countries in the world , despite having an estimated [ $ 24 trillion worth of mineral wealth ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mining_in_the_democratic_republic_of_the_congo ) ( for some context , that 's equivalent of the gdp of europe and the us combined ) , most of which is in the territorial borders of what would have been [ katanga ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/flag_of_katanga.svg/1000px-flag_of_katanga.svg.png ) , had their bid for independence succeeded . 
  i diverged a bit there , but hopefully that was of some interest to some of you . 
  had katanga succeeded in their bid for independence , it 's likely that south kasai would have too , and the whole political shape of africa would have been different . 
  i did n't have to configure anything , teamviewer seemed to sort all of the controls out for me, 
  so if , say , australia was the only country to refuse to let him abdicate , would he have to move there and act as the king of australia , or could he just sit around and not do anything ? 
  well , you ca n't really tell the people on the space station to not have their air on recirculation,

  wait , why is the ratio of the current jack 5:10 ? 
  surely that 's the same as 1:2 ?

  my very excellent mother just served us nachos, 
  now it makes sense !, 
  there 's another one in the works that i ca n't remember the name of , which kim dotcom is funding, 
  i completely missed the reference and thought of it as malcolm being a mobster,
