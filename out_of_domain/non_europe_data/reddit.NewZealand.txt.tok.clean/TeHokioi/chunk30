  ) , i think the main thing i 'd like to see is a unique style for each faction , like what we have in rome 2 . 
  at the moment , there are just three ( four ? ), 
  different building styles ( european , middle eastern/indian , native american ) , with an occasional unique building tacked on at the end . 
  i 'd like to see more variation , personally - even just something like in r2 . 
  other than that , i think the division of provinces was a good step , seas regions too . 
  ha , kiwis do n't, 
  i was expecting sarah palin . 
  was disappointed . 
  yeah , they know to edit the wikipedia pages outside of work,

  only if you can have a sound system hanging from it blaring ` ride of the valkyries ' at full volume, 
  the data is all taken from the [ cia world factbook ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2122.html#198 ) , so it 's probably based on however they report it, 
  i reckon the greens are gon na take a fair chunk of labour voters this time around , the bunch of people who do n't want to vote for cunliffe but want to get rid of national, 
  the map only identifies where a country has 50 % or more of its citizens following a religion . 
  given most censuses ( censii ? 
  census ? 
  censes ? ), 
  identify atheism as ` no religion ' it does n't make sense to say that `` 60 % of the population in this country follow the religion of not having a religion '', 
  or you are part of the 0.4 % that apparently is n't muslim ? 
  yeah , that 's fair enough . 
  i personally would n't use it , but the cartographers here did . 
  just thought of something in regards to the map , it only shows if over 50 % of the population follows one religion . 
  so theoretically , you could get a country with 49 % muslim , 49 % buddhist and 2 % other and not show up as religious . 
  maybe that 's what happened with myanmar ? 
  ah , well they 're probably taking it off official figures , which would be why it shows as such a high percentage of muslims . 
  out of curiosity though , why are people in turkey considered muslim by default , given it 's officially a secular state ? 
  cia 's probably still using data from the soviet union, 
  and * that 's * where i saw the leprechaun . 
  i did n't , the people that made the map got it from the cia world factbook, 
  yeah , i screwed up with the title . 
  not sure if it would be - turkey is listed as 99.6 % muslim, 
  i did n't make the map, 
  again , i did n't make it . 
  no , they 're not religious, 
  sorry , i screwed up with the title . 
  the map is only showing when  50 % follow a single religion, 
  it 's cia world factbook data , so i 've no idea, 
  i do n't think there is anywhere with no data , given the source was the cia world factbook , which covers all countries, 
  i posted a comment as soon as i posted the map with the source , and nobody upvoted it so it 's sitting somewhere around the middle, 
  yeah , that was me screwing up the title . 
  the description of the map on the [ source article ] ( http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/culture-lifestyle/world-religion/140715/map-most-religious-places ) was `` this map shows the countries where more than half the population consider themselves practicing members of one particular faith . 
  '' , which probably makes it a lot clearer than i did . 
  are you a rebel ? 
  the music in tropico is amazing, 
  as a new zealander ( so completely removed from this in everything but moral support ) i support germany much more than russia or the states , both of whom i do n't trust in the slightest, 
  yeah , in tropico 4 when you select el presidente ( the leader of the island and your avatar , who will walk around the island ) , one of the things he says is `` are you a rebel ? '', 
  particularly if there is a rebellion going on, 
  i never got any camels from that guy, 
  mine runs out in a week , i 'm trying to decide whether to get some more . 
  that 's the only feature i used , so i 'm not sure if it 's worth it . 
  even when the reward says ' $ 5000 and one camel ' ? 
  only on wednesdays, 
  what if they had already held office , and thus had sworn in previously ? 
  most of the buildings at my uni are in this style , i hate it with a passion . 
  thankfully we had an earthquake and in the process of repairing / rebuilding we 're getting some cooler , more modern buildings, 
  how many times have you been killed by a terrorist since 9/11 ? 
  * none ... *, 
  well then , obviously what we 're doing is working , is n't it ? 
  carry on , comrade !, 
  that makes sense, 
  c : \\ program files ( x86 ) \\ steam \\ steamapps \\ common \\ sid meier 's civilization v \\ assets \\ sounds \\ streamed \\ music \\ openingmenu_proto_1 . wav, 
  i 've moved it to the bnw folder and use it as my menu music , i love it . 
  now i just need to figure out how to have the background as atlas again, 
  nah , that 's the only one . 
  the rest are . ogg , all 1.5 gb of it, 
  i did n't make the map , so i 'm not sure of the exact definitions or whatever, 
  from what i can gather from the source page , grey does n't mean no data , it means that less than 50 % of the population follows a single religion , so it could be that 49 % are christian , 49 % are muslim and it 'll still show up as grey, 
  nah , i once got gold with 2 upvotes from the last gold train i was in . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ wonder ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ it 'll ^ ^ ^ happen ^ ^ ^ again ? 
  edit : holy fucking shit, 
  well yeah , i was just meaning that in response to your post that grey = no data,

  michael collins never went to the moon 's surface , so anything that happened there would n't affect him . 
  with all the apollo missions , one man stayed orbiting the moon while the other two dropped down . 
  i doubt the west would let him get beyond syria / iraq , let alone spain, 
  for the last steam sale they had a bunch of teams that were fighting for points . 
  that 's pretty much it , really . 
  reddit rigged the game to deny valve the satisfaction of making money off it,

  can someone explain what 's happening in other palestinian territories while there 's conflict in gaza ? 
  are they experiencing skirmishes too , or is it just a conflict between israel and hamas ( who , iirc , do n't control the west bank or the rest of palestine ), 
  ah , i was wondering why a shield would have the hand exposed . 
  thanks for the clarification !, 
  is there anybody out there ? 
  i 'm sure they would read it , it 's most likely that they get hundreds of suggestions , particularly from nationalist people going `` screw you relic , you need to include _______ '' ( or at least , that 's what happens with civ 5 . ), 
  often a well thought out suggestion can get hidden amongst the dozens of mediocre suggestions , so i 'm sure that 's what would have happened . 
   we also had r.e. 
  classes that were run by a teacher who had studied multiple different religions and who taught about these religions e.g. 
  buddhism , islam , christianity . 
  til the religious education classes at a christian school teach more religions than the religious education classes at a public school ( or at least the one i went to ), 
  so is there no rise in tension between fatah and israel at the moment ? 
  what 's happening in the west bank while there 's fighting in gaza ? 
  he 's too busy running around turning off fans, 
  fun fact , some traffic lights used to have people standing next to them controlling them . 
  i ca n't remember his name , but just before the great depression there was a rich financier who would drive to work , and the traffic cops would see him coming and change the light to green for him, 
  maybe try [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rptvkiwesb0 ) , it 's a live version but it 's just as good as the studio version ( along with ~ 2 minutes of piano at the start that is n't in the main version ) . 
  otherwise you could use hola unblocker to get around the gema stuff , maybe ? 
  i never realised that bret mckenzie was in the black seeds , and i 've grown up with my dad listening to all this sort of music . 
  with that in mind , there 's also [ wandering eye , by fat freddy 's drop ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecjg63szil4 ) if you like that sort of music .
