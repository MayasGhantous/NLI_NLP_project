  it 's a kiwi company , but not all of the clients ( hell , probably almost none ) of the clients will be from nz . 
  you might have sky or some of the telcoms launching one , but the vast majority would be international . 
  given that the rockets are built entirely in nz ( from what i can gather , ) if each launch is 4.9 million usd that 's just under 6 million dollars being injected into the nz economy for every launch - 600 million per year if their claims of launch volume are to be believed . 
  all of this is ignoring the ` wow factor ' - how awesome is it that new zealand has the ability to send something into fucking * outer space ? 
  * so far , the countries to successfully do this are massive - the us , russia , china , europe , japan , and so on . 
  new zealand would n't just be punching above its weight , it would be knocking out mike tyson . 
  the simple fact that it 's * so goddamn awesome * means that you 'd get an influx of people wanting to go into stem fields , increasing the technological ability of our country as a whole and making the field ripe for more high tech startups that could revolutionise their own relevant fields , as this rocket has done . 
  and then there 's the whole aspect of products being developed for it finding their way into everyday appliances , with benefits going far being space exploration . 
  he 's got the 500 members needed to register , so i 'm sure he could ring some of them up and ask nicely, 
  september 20 , 2014 `` chocko kisses colin craig '', 
  hamilton . 
  i reckon it 's india , given it sort of fits the general time zone and would have the british english, 
  try [ this tool ] ( http://www.onthefence.co.nz/ ) - it 'll help you decide who to vote for based on your views on issues and how strongly you feel about them , and which party best reflects your views, 
  i just had a look at the website , seems they 're down to upgrade for the election as we speak :, 
   in 2011 we released a desktop-only version of on the fence that has ( and continues to be ) helpful for heaps of young voters . 
  we 're developing a newer , fancier verion for 2014 . 
  it 'll be ready in early august !, 
  just wait . 
  they 're going to canonise him soon , and he 'll forever be known as ` saint ronald ; president reagan ', 
  uphill both ways ? 
  airz is secretly the manager of hotel california, 
  that and the little gap in anatolia are the bane of my existence . 
  we 've got [ something like that ] ( http://colincraig.co.nz/ ) here in nz with our version of sarah palin, 
  i keep saying this , but i really reckon they 're going to do far better this election compared to labour , with people who are voting on the left who do n't want to vote for cunliffe, 
  [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/44zp2sk.jpg ) in the middle of galatia et cappadocia, 
  do they actually * do * anything ? 
  i was , but then i looked and it turns out there is a lake there !, 
  that makes me feel better about it , although it could still do with the same treatment of the other lakes, 
  i do n't see it as much of what the content is , but rather it 's a completely different view of cunliffe than what 's shown on the media . 
  here you see proper rhetoric , on the news you see him bumbling an apology for being a man . 
   or the whole province feature, 
  what 's the complaint with this part ? 
  i thought it was great, 
  we do , it 's called rugby . 
  sorry , what was that ? 
  i ca n't hear you over the sound of the world cup victory, 
  now all you need to do is come up with two pages of bullshit and collect your millions from any art dealer in the world . 
  that 's why it has to be named after a carnivore . 
  herbivores can only run on ethanol . 
  nah , it was on / r/newzealand about a week ago, 
  of course , dear leader 's popularity is eternally at 110 % . 
  these polls are treason, 
  welcome to reddit , or as it 's also known , hotel california . 
  you 're gon na be here a while . 
  they also [ more than tripled ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/nz_govt_debt_1990-2011.svg/1000px-nz_govt_debt_1990-2011.svg.png ) our national debt, 
  are you only counting ` serious ' parties ? 
  i thought the civilian party was registered too ? 
  but at least you can still see the walls . 
  it 's weird , i know , but i 'd prefer to be in any sort of craft than without one in the open ocean . 
  i 'm fine with water , but i 'm terrified of being in open water , even if there 's a boat nearby . 
  it 's not the drowning that i 'm afraid of , it 's the isolation . 
  on land it 's fine , but with nothing visible but water as far as the eye can see ... 
  yeah , i 've used all build points and upgraded everything . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bcfmwy2.jpg?1 ) is what alexandria looks like currently , no more options to upgrade anything, 
  what happened ? 
  now for the real test of whether you 're an elderly lady ... what did you mean by lol ? 
  lots of love or laugh out loud ? 
  if that was serious , maybe it 's because it 's not strictly a retail story ? 
  i know non-tech support posts get removed in / r/talesfromtechsupport, 
  i just thought of something , maybe post it as a comment and have it upvoted to the top ? 
  more like / r/civcirclejerk - / r/civ is n't like that anymore, 
  nz checking in , it 's called uni here too . 
  i love [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbbyc3t-ctc ) from argentina . 
  the audience is like `` i 'll sing when i fucking want , thank you very much '', 
  possibly because rome is n't a port ? 
  alexandria only has six because it 's coastal , and one of them is the port . 
  hey , that 's me !, 
  some died out in the 1400 's , others in the 1700 's . 
  there were like 20 species that were all different sizes . 
  hey bro , i got ta get me some of that parliament tv, 
  i dunno , i can not recall what he said, 
  we need ban ki moon to fly in on the back of a dove armed to the teeth , at which point he gives isis the option to quit their shit , pay a fee , * and * die, 
  i * knew * bugs bunny said something similar !, 
  congratulations on figuring that one out, 
  guys like that give us a bad name . 
  i do n't give a shit what you want to believe , just do n't shove it down my throat and i 'm fine . 
  to be fair , i did n't get it until this post, 
  everyone 's stealing off reddit - it 's nothing new . 
  tv3 's doing an ama thing with politicians on their website , the radio stations take stuff from it , most of gizmodo / mashable come from it, 
  so it 's just like reddit ? 
  damn , i aged quickly . 
  i can remember when i was 18 like it was yesterday . 
  mainly because he 's treated as a source by the media, 
  nah , i was meaning reposts . 
  i think that 's more just the nature of the simpsons as a show instead of being racist . 
  look at how many stereotypes homer simpson portrays , or chief wiggum , or mayor quimby . 
  every single character on the show is a caricature of their particular role - mr burns as the moneygrabbing scrooge mcduck of a ceo , ~ 4000 years old and living in the mansion with the hounds . 
  rainier wolfcastle as the buff action movie star , stereotypically fighting off single handedly the stereotypical bad-guys of commie-nazis while hopelessly outnumbered . 
  martin as the ostracised know-it-all , ned flanders as the overly nice neighbour , ol' gil as the desperate salesman . 
  apu is n't being a stereotypical indian , he is being a stereotypical convenience store owner . 
  the fact that the stereotypical convenience store owner is indian is more a comment on society than on the decision of the show 's creators . 
  would it be more racist if everyone in the town was white ( or , as the case may be , yellow ? ), 
  yeah , but ukraine willingly gave up their nuclear weapons . 
  i ca n't see israel being so polite about it, 
  not as much as revolution did . 
  pretty much every episode was '' __________ got captured !, 
  we need to go to _______ and fight off a larger and better equipped army to rescue them !, 
  * fight scene with people bringing swords to gunfights , and winning *, 
  yay , we won !, 
  oh no , ______ got captured in the fighting ! '',
