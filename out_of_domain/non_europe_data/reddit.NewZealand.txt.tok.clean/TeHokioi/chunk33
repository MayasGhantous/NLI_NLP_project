  i think it depends on the occasion . 
  here in nz , the same bar can have people going to grab a drink with family / friends at one point , then a couple hours later have 18-19 year olds drinking to get wasted . 
  beer / cider in the former almost exclusively , then whatever gets you drunk fastest for the least amount of money in the latter, 
  yeah , but it 's a stereotype of a convenience store owner just as much as it is one of indians . 
  given the circumstances surrounding the stereotypical nature of the other characters and their roles , i 'm inclined to believe that apu is a case or the former rather than the latter, 
  it got better as time went on , would have been an absolutely fantastic show if it had better writers . 
  great universe , great premise , they set the scene for war between countries early on , then ruin the whole goddamn thing with the bad writing . 
  the acting did n't bother me compared to the writing, 
  number 5 will blow your mind !, 
  the civilian had better up their game ... they promised to be threatened with legal action by colin craig again before the election , and so far it 's just everyone else . 
  i think their criteria , based on the list , is parties already in parliament . 
  the internet party is n't on their list either, 
  but it 's under mana , not internet-mana ? 
  how is that thing actually working ? 
  hey you , stop making pink floyd puns, 
  as long as i 'm comfortably numb at that point, 
  or a pr goldmine , depending on which party you 're in pr for . 
   you ca n't plop a port for cargo ships on it, 
  not with that attitude you ca n't, 
  i 'm always upset when i wake up in the morning and have to play on centra because no-one else is online on diameter, 
  i regularly get ~ 60fps and ~ 55 ping on diameter, 
  that sucks . 
  for what it 's worth , i can only play it while at home . 
  i 've tried on uni internet ( which is supposedly better , double my usual speed according to the internet speed test ) and i get 30 % loss and a ping of 200, 
  shame key is n't over there , he could have gone round for dinner, 
  this is one for the ages , folks . 
  this is reddit 's arab spring, 
  it 's been free since the safe was opened, 
  only other one i can think of that would be relevant would be [ comic ] and [ what-if ] , for links that are n't the current one . 
  2000 years ago it was a bridge , then nature decided `` fuck it , alexander wants a bridge here , he 's getting a bridge ' and made it into a peninsula, 
  nah , they built a wooden / dirt bridge out to the island . 
  the ocean currents caused sediment to build up on either side and over the course of the past 2300 years more and more sediment was deposited and it eventually became what it is today, 
  for an xkcd subreddit , i think ismeta would be a nice touch as opposed to the standard meta tag . 
  do n't think so , but he 's been invited to be an honorary mod there, 
  i think the change that i dislike the most is the removal of the spike at the bottom and the changes around there . 
  now it feels a lot more like an open ball vs ball map , as opposed to one where the terrain could be used . 
  / u/thezhu said he was dying , that 's how it was relevant, 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/outoftheloop/comments/2c5v4a/what_happened_to_uunidan_is_he_shadowbanned_if_so/ ) should explain it fairly well . 
  basically , he had a bunch of alt accounts which he used to manipulate votes , upvoting himself and downvoting others giving the same answer . 
  but he also got brownie points for fighting the soviets , i would imagine, 
  to be fair , that treeline one is still accurate . 
  it 's not how long until sunset , it 's how long until you lose sunlight where you are , in which case the treeline is effectively the horizon . 
  i 've heard that the whole isis thing means that there 's a greater chance of kurdish independence in iraq , and turkey would be willing to support it for the first time ( ever ? ), 
  what do you think the chances of that happening are , and how long until you think it would happen ? 
  far enough away that one finger only just covers the sun , iirc . 
  it 's meant to be a rough guide , not a precision instrument, 
  but it was independent for at least part of that period , so it should still reasonably count , should n't it ? 
  that would have been great fun , having act as the most liberal party, 
  i imagine it would be an india / pakistan style separation . 
  people would be allowed to move to the new country if they wanted . 
  although that might not be the best idea , given [ what happened last time ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partition_of_india#independence.2c_population_transfer.2c_and_violence ), 
  which happened in the middle of this time period . 
  along with a fair chunk of decolonisation , which is what i think their point is . 
  wait , really ? 
  it works for me here in nz and not for the uk ? 
  wow, 
  do you make these ? 
  if so , i 've got to ask . 
  why that font ? 
  oh , but do n't you know big government is bad , and welfare is for *** commies *** . 
  here in * america * we have a little thing called *** freedom ^ tm ***, 
  that would have been great :, 
   `` i 'm sorry mr. prime minister . 
  you broke the rules '', 
   `` but i 'm the key speaker ! '', 
   `` rules are rules . '', 
  it still seems confusing to me , especially in regards to europe . 
  it 's like , * `` let 's go to spain for lunch '' * can be a perfectly normal statement in france , but to say * `` let 's go to australia for lunch '' * here you 'd both be rich enough to spend $ 500 on lunch and want to spend 8 hours on planes . 
  a mate of mine is over there at the moment on his oe - he went out drinking one night and woke up in a different country, 
  just for the record , i do n't know what post you 're replying to , but it was n't me ( the guy who wrote that post you 're quoting ) . 
   if you try to convince kiwis that coleslaw is a good addition to fish and chips they look at you like you 're crazy . 
  but the ones who 've tried it here agree that it is good . 
  wait , it 's offensive in other countries ? 
  bugger . 
  i assumed the issue was with the line `` you want compassion / do n't vote for me '', 
  i think in that regard it 's similar to * house of cards * - if you watched one episode per week , it would be a very slow show . 
  but binge-watching it made it a great one, 
   northland, 
   most searched for : killing , lawyer, 
  well , i guess i can cross northland off my to-do list . 
  i dunno , otago seems to have its head screwed on right, 
  i do n't mind it as a film , i just think the finale got a bit over the top . 
  i mean , it 's fine until you 've got a fucking huge spaceship launching out of a waterfall . 
  there are a few other minor plot things ( survive a nuke in a fridge !, 
  tarzan your way through a forest to catch up to commie car-boats ! ), 
  but ultimately i like it better than temple of doom . 
  i doubt that 'll happen . 
  i 'm pretty sure protecting sources is one of the pillars of investigative journalism if they want to remain anonymous, 
  oh , just like paddy gower ? 
  i 'd argue that 's one of the issues that we 're facing at the moment, 
  nah , duncan garner was n't as bad imo . 
  the more biased reporting came in with paddy taking the helm, 
  is it hard being so nice all of the time ? 
  have we found philip 's tomb yet ? 
  any chance that this is it ? 
  oh god , if this book turned out to have a subplot within it that favours parts of the national party that would do my head in . 
  we already have enough subplots and schemes without a pro-joyce element within an anti-national book, 
  i do n't think it would be intentional , more like joyce et al. 
  selectively leaking emails that incriminate collins while keeping a tight lid on their own transgressions, 
  holy crap .
