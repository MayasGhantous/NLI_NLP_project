  no he 's not . 
  surely if the greens get more votes than labour we 'd end up with russel or metiria as pm ? 
  wait , it is n't already ? 
  god , that would be so much of a shock the media would n't know what to do with themselves, 
  just voted in my first election this year . 
  i remember him being foreign minister under clark , was that when he was deputy pm ? 
  1 like = 1 vote . 
  that 's their loophole - they can still say `` the sun never sets on the british empire '', 
  reminds me of red from * the blacklist * , perfect conversation and interrogation style, 
  / u/rory _ macdonald _ usually does a pretty good job of calling them out, 
  that 's a great idea - we have something like that over in / r/newzealand with the upcoming amas , instead of having separate stickies for each upcoming ama . 
  could definitely work well, 
  the nazca ? 
  could you post a screenshot please ? 
  i 'm not entirely sure what that was trying to say, 
  wellington 's ` shitty wind ' is actually a defense mechanism against aucklanders,

  oh come on , everyone 's had to make sacrifices . 
  why , i could only buy one bentley this year !,

  morphing reptilian lizard people confirmed . 
  i have a friend who agrees with the policies of the greens and labour , but is voting national solely because they 're ' a stable government ' and she 's worried of a coup or something if the opposition wins . 
  admittedly she just moved here from the philippines , so she 's not used to a stable democracy , but even so, 
  i wish i could afford lamb :(, 
  but there 's a difference between forming a labour / greens government and having a violent revolution, 
  * at the end of the day , ordinary kiwis care about the fact that it 's the end of the day , which at the end of the day is an important and significant time for the ordinary kiwis which enjoy making it to the end of the day . 
  this is because , at the end of the day they can remember the start of the day , unlike myself , who can not recall the start of the day at the end of the day . 
  and as such , at the end of the day i think that ordinary kiwis should care more about snapper and the flag than being at the end of the day *, 
  damn , i 'm over in a lecture in engineering at that point . 
  if you ask that and he responds i will buy you gold . 
  i looked at that , but it had a prereq of either repo110 or opoc102 , and i have neither, 
  * 7 signs that your country 's election contains politics !, 
  you will never look at elections the same again . 
  wow . 
  and allows any party with votes to get in . 
  hello legalise cannabis and neo-nazis !, 
  unless they somehow manage to mobilise the youth vote which was underrepresented in the polls, 
  calling / u/benuffindell - you wanted to answer for colin craig ? 
  whoa , what ? 
  got proof on that ? 
  can we start a mass campaign of dropping opened envelopes in mailboxes ?

  or the best time ? 
  this is actually one part of a two scotland release to represent the referendum - this is the pro-independence one , and another modder released [ a scotland under james i ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=315651436 ) representing the no vote . 
  we 've updated the celtic city list to more fitting names , so that there 's no overlap, 
  nah - i 'm a kiwi and so is jfd ( the guy that did the lua ) , but the artist is polish , the other artist is thai , the guy that did the ui model is bolivian the guy that wrote the civilopedias is from the uk ( ca n't remember if it 's scotland or england , ) and the guy that did the dom voiceover is an aussie . 
  what 's 20,000 km between friends ? 
  the city state was removed when the celts came in with the first expansion , given that they had edinburgh as their capital ( which is now a more celtic city ), 
  there should n't be , hopefully, 
  try looking under `` m '' as the name of the mod is `` more civs : scotland '', 
  did you try through steam or the direct download ? 
  try the direct download , something 's up with steam, 
  no , it spawns a melee unit when the * empire * is attacked . 
  so if someone declares war on you and you 're not at war already , it spawns a melee unit . 
  we could n't ignore fortification bonuses , so we gave the unit a bonus equal to the fortification bonus to counteract it, 
  the celts have minimal overlap , we changed their city list,
