  definitely chinese . 
  even with kanji , the closest to chinese writing , you still get some other characters in it . 
  i once had some chocolate that was made in a stone mill in oaxaca - the only ingredients were cacao , cane sugar and vanilla beans . 
  it was really bitter because it was so strong , but oh my god it was amazing, 
  and their fur is oh-so-warm , make great slippers, 
  sounds to me like a big game of political chicken with the government workers in the middle, 
  it 's maritime because it 's founded on a massive harbour and was originally called `` port nicholson '' - played a large part in setting up nz . 
  but it could easily have been cultural , what with weta workshops / peter jackson being centered there and a great cultural flavour in the city itself . 
  source : kiwi , used to live in wellington and love it there, 
  yeah , they have a lot of those . 
  plus cuba st and the whole street art / unconventional stuff it pretty well-founded there . 
  i 'm down in the sth island now , and miss wellington dearly, 
  not a bad recovery from that one , good show, 
  and i was planning on making one anyway , nice, 
  almost all of our state highways still have one-way bridges ( i.e. 
  one side of traffic has to give way without traffic lights etc ) and very frequently is outside of cellphone coverage . 
  tectonic uplift, 
  can always check by creating a fake account and using it to search for yourself, 
  my history teacher knew the grandson of one of the royal guards , iirc, 
  as others have said , arthur 's pass . 
  it 's the main pass between the east and west coasts , and if you 're ever in nz and going to the west coast straight from christchurch chances are you drove over it . 
  nearly all the main alpine passes in the south island have the beech forest that you see here ( exception being lindis pass , which is alpine tussock ) . 
  haast pass ( down at the bottom of the west coast plain as you head inland towards wanaka and queenstown ) is of particular mention , as you 've got the [ gates of haast ] ( http://www.lynx-travel.com/vacations/nz2000/wanaka/gates%20of%20haast%20bridge%20over%20haast%20gorge.jpg ) - a fairly large set of rapids down the haast river that 's violent even at the best of times , as well as several other waterfalls . 
  as a matter of course , any of the mountain passes between the east and west coasts is going to have waterfalls and beech forests like arthur 's and haast , and almost all of them have short walks you can go on ( devil 's punchbowl is about 20-30 minutes depending on ability ) that make it easy to forget you 're just off a major state highway . 
  ** flag of new zealand **, 
  the southern cross and colours are existing symbols of new zealand and feature on the flag , while the white triangle is symbolic of the southern alps and the red within is symbolic of the maori heritage of the country ( red being one of the main three colours in maori iconography ), 
  okay , so like others have said , we get requests like this * a lot * . 
  if i 'm being honest , you 're most likely not going to get anywhere by going to modders and saying `` i have these ideas for civs , can you make them ? 
  '' , as a lot of them are busy with real life and their own mods , myself included . 
  that said , most are more than willing to * help * make a mod , and teach you how to make the mod for yourself . 
  most of the time , it 's fairly easy to make a mod , depending of course on what you 'd like the civs to do . 
  what i would suggest is downloading an existing civilization mod and opening up the files for it to see how it does what it does . 
  this is how i learned modding , and it 's still how i make the mods ( i copy all the files from another one of my mods , and just change the names and effects ) . 
  in terms of the suggestion itself , some of them are already civs . 
  lithuania , sumer , the hre and prussia all have versions on steam workshop . 
  scenarios are a lot more difficult , and i would advice starting off with the civilizations first as they 're the easiest . 
  do n't worry about it - i 'm fairly well-travelled within nz ( just east cape and northland left ) . 
  there 's some awesome stuff over there , except there 's a fair bit of disparity . 
  the parts you 'd want to see ( glaciers , punakaiki etc. ), 
  are touristy , and expensive , while the parts you would n't want to see as much are the cheaper ones . 
   they think it is, 
  exactly - why is it so important within islam ? 
  i 'm not wanting this to go into another religion vs. atheism debate , there 's enough of those already on the web, 
  india is almost as big as china and is a democracy . 
  i think the major point here is the `` none of whom have ever participated in a representative form of government '' - china has never been a democracy ( it got close during the early 20th century , but never proper democracy . 
  you 'd almost certainly have political unrest , and whether democracy would last would depend on who got elected . 
  chances are many would see it as an opportunity to take power for themselves and establish themselves as supreme leader / dictator / emperor . 
  if china were to become a democracy ( which would n't happen overnight , and would likely be a result of unrest a la arab spring ) the new democratic process would have to be safeguarded extremely well to make it impossible for any one party to assume total control . 
  that said , you 've got a lot of almost empty territory with little or no ties to beijing within china , often filled with marginalised populations . 
  national geographic did a story a while ago on a region in west china that was effectively colonised for natural resources , but i ca n't seem to find a link . 
  i have a feeling [ this wsj article ] ( http://online.wsj.com/article/sb10001424052702303561504577496930351770466.html ) is on the same region , but i might be mistaken . 
  so you would probably have a few breakaway states in the west ( particularly tibet ) , but i would imagine the majority of china would remain united . 
  india has democracy , that seems to work, 
  first we need to think of how china would become the democracy . 
  personally , i think the most likely scenario would be what is being seen in the arab world at the moment with the arab spring , you 've got revolutions and mass protests that ultimately result in the fall of a government . 
  now , in egypt the amount of protestors has been estimated at around 2 million , or about 2.3 % of the population . 
  if that same percentage of the population were to oppose the government in china , that would equate to approximately 32 million , or roughly 3 times larger than the current largest protest in human history and about the equivalent to one and a half australias protesting . 
  of course , such a protest is unlikely , however you would almost certainly have millions of people on the streets of shanghai , nanjing , guangzhou and of course , beijing . 
  this could then go several ways . 
  the chinese government is not known for allowing protests , let alone one of such size , so allowing the protests is out of the question . 
  given the political nature of china , the head of state is n't as important as they are in a place such as egypt or libya where they were a dictator , so you would most likely not get a situation where they flee , * a la * tunisia . 
  this leaves the military . 
  they would have two main options here :, 
  side with the people and initiate a coup d'\u00e9tat, 
  side with the government and begin a brutal crackdown on the protestors, 
  if they choose option 1 and are successful , they now run one of the biggest and most powerful countries in the world . 
  china has been a military dictatorship before , so returning to that would n't be out of the question . 
  they would be akin to the current regime in egypt , claiming to be acting in the name of democracy but not actually doing anything of the sort . 
  they would keep assuring in the hope people forgot . 
  alternatively , they write an effective constitution in which democracy is safe-guarded and then organise elections , leading to a democracy . 
  if they were to choose option 2 , then the ball would be in the protestors court again . 
  you could get a repeat of 1989 's protests with the repression working , or it could devolve into what we 've seen / are seeing in libya and syria , with the protestors fighting back and it becoming a civil war . 
  however this results in democracy being a long way off , if at all , and we 're not interested in it . 
  chances are during the unrest from the widespread protests separatist movements and rebellions would erupt in some of the more remote reaches of the country . 
  china has over 10 million uighurs in the far west , many of whom hold resentment towards the chinese government and would see the political unrest as an opportunity to gain independence . 
  tibet would probably take the chance too . 
  depending on what the ideology of the new government is , north korea might or might not lose their primary supporter . 
  that could result in the collapse of the state or a flare up in tension , as china acted both as a support and a voice of reason for north korea . 
  the new government would also have potential to recognise taiwan as an independent country , however that would remain to be seen . 
  globally , the markets would become a lot more uncertain as china 's loans to other countries would become endangered and threaten the stability of these countries . 
  the new government could choose to recall loans , resulting in many countries going well into debt and potentially into collapse . 
  however this would be a worst-case scenario . 
  officially western countries would support the advancement of democracy , and would take it as an opportunity to regain ground where the chinese had been gaining influence ( particularly in africa ) while they deal with internal strife . 
  post-revolution , the government could continue these endeavours or they could withdraw from the power play with the us . 
  either way , they would be forced to solidify their rule first and restore stability . 
  if the new government was more aggressive , they could attempt to reclaim lost territories or invade nearby countries - conflicts could escalate through the south china sea , with vietnam or the philippines being targets in that instance . 
  such a move would be political suicide for the new regime , with global opposition an almost certainty . 
  the un would not be able to get involved however , as the new regime would most likely still hold power of veto on the security council ( as was the case with russia and the ussr ), 
  ** tl ; dr : ** depends on what the new government is like, 
  what i meant by that is that a democracy would n't collapse with such a large population , and it 's still technically possible, 
  i 'd suggest in terms of researchers you could ask over at / r/askhistorians if you had any specific questions . 
  the other day i found [ a general history of africa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_history_of_africa ) , a unesco-sponsored series which comprehensively details african history . 
  volume ii is probably the most relevant , as it deals exclusively with ancient civilizations of africa . 
  for the next patch , germany gets a new ub , the hanse ( replacing the bank , gives bonus production from trade routes with city states ) instead of the landschnekt , which is now unlocked by the commerce tree . 
  samurai can now build fishing boats , and i believe japan also gets bonus culture from something and a coast start bias, 
  i 've found rex is a good strategy with the shoshone , you 're wanting to settle early to get as much land as possible and block choke points to restrict enemy movement . 
  gcsb bill being the government allowing the gcsb ( one of our spy agencies ) to spy on new zealand citizens , as a result of public outcry around the kim dotcom saga, 
  vegemite is marmite soaked in evil, 
  do n't sit on the ground if you 're in japan . 
  seriously , it 's very bad,
