  great , now i have to go through the twenty thousand steps to change my watch again . 
  at least going forward an hour is easier than holding the thing down to go forward 11 hours , which is what 's needed to go back one, 
  i feel like going to the west coast and kissing the tasman sea for keeping us separated, 
  mine 's a casio one - you 've got to cycle through all the useless modes it has ( seriously , who keeps a telephone number in their watch ? ), 
  until you get to the last one , where you 've got to hold three buttons at once , then another one to move the hands . 
  forward only too , nobody would ever need to move the hands backwards, 
  this is what i hate about statistics . 
  you can say both that more new zealanders voted than did n't , and that out of all the options most people did n't vote and they 'd both be valid . 
  makes for horrible arguments when both people are right, 
  maybe because of the beheading plot they foiled ? 
  i 'm kinda hoping that national spends a lot of time focusing on changing the flag , so that they run out of time to impose any of this stuff, 
  can we just give guyon espiner his own prime-time current affairs show already ? 
  do it anyway . 
  have so many people convicted that there 's no room for them in the jails and the work force diminishes . 
  where 's a safer place to be in the event of a terrorist attack - the middle of a city or a jail ? 
  only if we can put a giant outboard motor on stewart island to push us further north and give us better weather, 
   in the event of a terrorist attack, 
  not in everyday context, 
  then we attach another outboard to kaitaia and push ourselves further south again, 
  which is why this is a discussion and not a definitive response, 
  the left * really * needs to focus on mobilising young voters . 
  even if that gives national a few extra voters , from the look of it the benefit would easily outweigh the detriment which it would cause, 
  i was n't meaning left votes switching to national , i was meaning votes out of that 36 % of 18-24 's that did n't vote but support national . 
  if they 're focusing on voter mobilisation in that demographic to get some of the 58 % who support labour or the greens , they 're bound to also result in some of the 36 % who support national voting too, 
  it 's also those who grew up in a world where the left was seen as pure evil because of those dastardly *** commies ***, 
  [ this poster ] ( http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1397119815/816/9928816.jpg ) showed up around uni in the buildup to the election too . 
  turns out stuff had [ a piece on it ] ( http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/comment/columnists/chris-trotter/9928806/unintended-irony-in-key-nazi-poster ) back in april , makes for a pretty good read if you can be bothered, 
  hopefully the damage is n't too bad by the time the baby boomers leave that we wo n't be able to bring it back to the centre/left, 
  i thought you just said it lost ? 
  i think it 's a bit harsh to say that 's the only evidence, 
  there was the banning of planet key , then the suspension of @whaledump , as well as suppression of free speech stuff with the banning of protest vessels within 500m or whatever it was . 
  note i 'm not saying john key 's going to become franco anytime soon , just that if you were looking at stuff with this in mind it would be possible to pick out the beginnings of a trend, 
  tell that to scandinavia, 
  i love how all these airliners are bringing out new , more colourful liveries now . 
  ca n't wait to go to an airport in 10-15 years and see lots of different coloured planes, 
  i was also including the 19 % who support the greens , which makes it 56 % - 36 % , which is much better for the left . 
  as for the other groups , that 's why i said focus on mobilising young voters in that 18-24 group , not mobilising all non-voters . 
  i think a lot of new zealand does , and that 's something which needs to be changed too . 
  i think if people realised that a vote for the greens is n't necessarily a vote for labour then we would have seen a different election result , given labour 's train wreck . 
  i dunno , america seems to think big border walls are still necessary ... 
  or it could be a really good idea , depending on which party you support, 
  i was up at 6 ... then decided fuck it and woke up an hour later, 
  * this just in : north korea responsible for low voter turnout *, 
  oh , it must be so terrible having superior public healthcare and paid tertiary education , must n't it ? 
  good idea , i 'd love a present which allows me to slowly watch australia disappear !, 
  hypothetically , could i buy a container and get the crayfish inside for free ? 
  i 'm sure national shares your sentiment , which is why he got the fancy job, 
  the res vote count for him and / u/mamba _ 79 just keep going brighter and brighter green, 
  they 're not the only ones - / u/airz23 and his amazing tfts stories and / u/balchynz because , um , i have no idea . 
  maybe he uses his god-king powers to make the upvote count grow ? 
  sure , if you live in a land where money grows on trees and geysers of coins erupt from the ground daily maybe, 
   a piece of that early heritage was recently revealed on a beach in new zealand , when a 600-year-old canoe with a turtle carved on its hull emerged from a sand dune after a harsh storm . 
  definitely op - our ( more civs ' ) nazca mod only has fresh water adjacent to cities after you complete the ub , and that 's still pretty powerful . 
  i once had one fifth rate against an army of 12 or 13 trade ships in empire ... they sailed straight for me in a line , then slowly started to circle me so that i could pick them off one by one . 
  i 'm not quite sure what happened even now . 
  aliens . 
  and the scenarios , which i kinda liked, 
  bnw also is required for most of the newer mods to work , so if you get it you 'd have access to at least 100 new civs , as well as wonders , mechanics etc which in my opinion covers a bit for the 9 with g&k . i 'd still definitely get g&k when you are in a position to do so , but bnw is definitely a better option off the bat, 
  for those wondering , norway 's attributes :,

  really ? 
  i never got any email ... 
  but then they 're forward settling brazil, 
  no doubt they need more time to figure out how to screw us out of more money, 
  oh , my bad . 
  i thought you meant the bit at the bottom , on the other side of the desert, 
  happened a couple years ago , so might be a tad rusty on the details , but bear with me . 
  okay , here 's the setup . 
  massive continent in two parts , separated by a narrow sea on both sides and a one-tile isthmus in the middle . 
  here 's a really abstract diagram of what i 'm talking about, 
  | ocean, 
  i ( byzantium ) was at spot # 2 , germany was # 1 , caribs # 3 , nubia # 4 , russia # 5 , france # 6 and greece # 7 . 
  i forward settled the isthmus ( at x ) to control it , then settle nicaea at y , which was an insane city location - mt. 
  sinai , desert hills , marble , wheat , sheep , oases ( all on desert ) . 
  i rush petra and then a couple other wonders ( playing with a bunch of wonder mods ) and it gets to a point where i 'm finishing a wonder every 7 turns in nicaea and about every 12 turns in constantinople . 
  greece ends up declaring war and capturing one of my newer cities just below nicaea , which had my only source of horses . 
  i train some comp bows to fight him off , and just as i reclaim my city nubia attacks me , and sends their entire army across the channel . 
  i rush bought a couple dromons and sent them around , end up destroying the entire army , mostly before they get into my empire . 
  while i 'm doing this , russia attacks me and sends an army to the other side of y. 
  at this point my army is advancing into greek territory so i rush buy a couple more units . 
  only just holding them off , at which point germany attacks me . 
  nubia sues for peace because i destroyed my army , so i send my dromons around the coast and camp out at the choke point near germany - the * on the map are mountains . 
  germany continued on a narrow strip right up the coast ( think chile ) , so after fighting them off i build a proper navy and conquer germany 's coastal cities . 
  i make peace with germany and greece , and there 's no russian units in sight so i think i 'm in the clear . 
  only at that point , the caribs and france both backstab me and smash into the side of my empire ( since at that point it was long and thin , from 1 down through x to y and 7 . ), 
  russia also sends in another army on the other side , so i 'm trapped . 
  i expend a couple great generals to build citadels in french territory and only just manage to hold onto them with my weak garrison . 
  dromons come steaming down the german coast and through the isthmus and begin shelling paris . 
  think about sparing napoleon , but then he brings out musketeers so i end up having to capture paris to save my army . 
  meanwhile my original comp bows which protected nicaea from the greeks were up between 2 and x , fighting off the caribbean units successfully until they sued for peace too . 
  i think i ended up conquering the whole of france , but i ca n't remember what happened after that .
