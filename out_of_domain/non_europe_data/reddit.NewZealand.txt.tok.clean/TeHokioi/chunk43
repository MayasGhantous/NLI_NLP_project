  wellington has pedestrian crossings ? 
  i always thought it was just ` walk wherever the hell you want ', 
  hell , i 'm half expecting australia to introduce prohibition at this rate, 
  speak for yourself, 
  ah , so it must be time for the `` prices are falling internationally , so we have to raise prices here to keep the farmers in jobs '' excuse for raising prices . 
  if they were rising it would be `` we need to raise prices to keep it economical to stock dairy here '', 
  nah , that fonterra is quick to find any excuse to raise prices and very slow to drop them, 
  i reckon it would have looked better if they swapped around which hand was in the pocket, 
   it steps from a heavily eurocentric idea , that the classical world was an isolated font of civilization surrounded by savage barbarians . 
  sorry if i 'm misunderstanding , but how is is eurocentric if the focus of the ` rich and relevant parts of the world ' were the middle east and persia ? 
  i would n't bet on it, 
  or new zealand . 
  he 'll know the true purpose when hawaii mysteriously begins to be dragged towards auckland ... 
  like i 've said before , practically it changes nothing , but symbolically it means that national did n't gain an absolute majority and so do n't have a true mandate from most of nz, 
  well i 'd probably cry too , how else could he visit all those houses in one night and give presents to everyone ? 
  first thought was that you 'd misspelled tokyo, 
  polynesia is the term for a cultural region in the pacific ocean spanning from the three extremities of hawaii , aotearoa / new zealand and rapa nui ( easter island ) , and including well over one thousand islands . 
  these islands are full of vastly differing and unique histories , from the primarily land based conflict and fortified villages of the maori iwi of new zealand , to the enormous stone carvings of rapa nui . 
  while the majority of the islands retained contact with one another , changing climates and events cut off the extremities , allowing each society to develop independently without influence of the outside world until the arrival of europeans . 
  as such , the polynesian civ from firaxis is an anachronistic and ahistorical amalgamation of a civ , with a leader from the hawaiian islands , a unique unit from aotearoa and a unique improvement from rapa nui . 
  the polynesian civilization pack rectifies this , with the separation of these into four unique civilizations - the maori , hawaii , rapa nui and the tu'i tonga empire . 
  each civilization features unique mechanics and distinct playstyles to best reflect the civ , from the expansionist and diplomatic tu'i tonga to the militaristic maori and the firmly religious rapa nui . 
  all civs contain support for the following mods : yet ( not ) another earth map pack , events & decisions , piety & prestige , cultural diversity , map labels , historical religions,

  the kingdom of hawaii , one of but a few polynesian kingdoms to be ( albeit briefly ) recognised as an independent state , has a large focus on specialists , with small bonuses for warfare ( but not conquest ), 
  * kahuna mastery * - specialists generate double their base yield . 
  receive great people points from combat . 
  unique unit : koa , longswordsman replacement , costs more production but requires no iron . 
  starts with more experience and the amphibious promotion . 
  unique building : heiau . 
  temple replacement that gives a random specialist when built . 
  known for good reason as * the napoleon of the south pacific * , te rauparaha leads the militaristic maori , with bonuses to aid in increasing the size of your army ( and the potential to gain enemy unique units on your side ), 
  * mana of tumatauenga * - every time an enemy unit is defeated in battle , receive 25 % of the production cost towards that unit in the capital . 
  melee units lower the combat strength of adjacent enemy units . 
  unique unit : taiaha warrior , replaces pikeman ; stronger , generates xp faster . 
  upgrades to musketman . 
  nearby units have +5 % combat strength, 
  unique improvement : pa , requires engineering . 
  can be built on hills and provides food , and ca n't be built next to another pa. . boosts military production by 5 % when worked . 
  known the world over for their enormous stone carvings , the rapa nui are a mysterious and enigmatic people who saw their island paradise turn into a hellish prison as a result of their own actions and a changing climate . 
  they are devoutly pious and place great importance on the tradition of the tangata-manu . 
  * kai kai lore * - every time a citizen is born , receive faith . 
  every 10 faith output of a city generates +1 cultural gpp , including faith from new citizens, 
  unique unit : matato'a , replaces composite bowmen . 
  +1 sight , +1 range ( lost on upgrade ) collect a manu tara egg from an unimproved coastal tile on hills without resources , generating +40 gp points to cultural great people and starting a 5 turn wltkd on the city , the process takes 5 turns and ca n't be done on the same tile twice . 
  doing so transforms the unit into a tangata-manu , which is stronger . 
  unique improvement : moai , requires construction . 
  buildable on coast , it yields +2 faith , and +1 culture for each adjacent moai . 
  +1 additional faith when built on a manu tara egg site . 
  one of the great powers of central polynesia , the tu'i tonga empire controlled multiple island chains in an empire stretching from samoa and tikopia to niue , with influence extending to fiji and beyond . 
  they remain among the only polynesian kingdom to have resisted european colonialism as a result of cunning diplomacy and cordial relations between themselves and others , as is represented here . 
  * the friendly islands * - earn more influence for completing cs quests . 
  whenever you first meet a civilization or a city-state earn a random faith , culture , gold or science bonus . 
  unique unit : tongiaki , replaces trireme . 
  can enter ocean tiles . 
  when an embarked unit starts on the same tile as an outrigger , it too can cross ocean tiles . 
  unique building : mala'e , replaces granary . 
  for every sea tile adjacent to the city , receive +1 food in the city . 
  fish and crab provide +1 food when worked .

  it 's only the base yields , it 's not like it 's every single thing which adds extra yields to them . 
  you 're still only going to get +1 production from the statue of liberty, 
  that 's a good point , we 'll see how balance goes . 
  we only got a fix for the double culture at 10:30 last night, 
  oh awesome , another kiwi !, 
  that was the original plan , but after hours and hours of stuff not working we gave up on it in favour of a simpler effect we knew that we could do, 
  i 'm from the biggest of the polynesian islands , so i kind of have a duty to put some thought into it, 
  of course - i 'd love to do some micronesian civs eventually , it 's just that they do n't fit in a polynesian pack . 
  i think it 's got that too , i ca n't remember off the top of my head, 
  we 've got three civs lined up for the rest of the year , and a secret large-scale project which i want to release before the end of the year , which may mean that one of the civs is delayed until january or something, 
  i think there 's something you can use to link to a site and stop them from getting ad revenue from it , ca n't remember the name of it though . 
  yeah , i mostly like it because most people have classed whaleoil as ` nonsense ', 
  some would say that list includes some legitimate governments , too . 
  not saying i agree with that , of course, 
  thank you for that insightful analysis, 
  not until next year , but one of the civs on the cards to be released this year are the minoans , so that 's kind of a consolation prize ? 
  yeah , turns out it 's done to stop his search ranking from improving, 
  nah , just the ` proper ' yields, 
  yeah , i was amazed that polynesia got any recognition at all .
