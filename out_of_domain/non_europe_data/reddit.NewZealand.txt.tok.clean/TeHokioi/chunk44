  it actually bumped my spirits up while i was having an extended holiday because of an [ earthquake back home ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_christchurch_earthquake ) . 
  it just annoyed me that they were all lumped in together , with islands as city names ( there was one city with the name of aotearoa , which is the whole of new zealand , then another with just the south island , so it would be like having new york and then manhattan as two separate cities , or maybe california and la ), 
  there 's actually even more than a legend , [ historical basis !, 
  it 's exactly what the maori warrior does , it just extended it to all melee units, 
  there 's one in the works , but not from more civs ... 
  pretty much , unless they say it has a 3d leaderhead it 's going to be 2d . 
  it 's still such a rarity in the modding world it 's a selling point to have one, 
  no sorry , i do n't think that tick does anything, 
  except historically , all of the maori wars were fought within their territory, 
  okay , so basically the matato'a can go onto a coastal hill tile and search for a manu-tara egg . 
  if there 's no resource on the tile ( including hidden strategics ) they 'll find one , which thematically does nothing to the tile other than give it a faith boost . 
  instead , the unit becomes a stronger version of itself called the tangata-manu , which also gives it the ability to cross ocean tiles . 
  couple of these guys and you can hold your own against even te rauparaha, 
  you should check out tomatekh 's civs too , they 're awesome and really high quality, 
  but then it discourages offensive warfare, 
  well , it 's more that the maori are an amalgam too . 
  there was never one unified maori empire ( maybe with the united tribes , but that failed ) , and instead were different iwi ( tribes ) that fought against each other . 
  so , while ultimately all of their wars were fought within maori territory in the context of the mod , the majority of wars were actually offensive in nature . 
  it works with yet ( not ) another earth map pack , but no other tsl mods, 
  nah , he said ` op as fuck ' without providing any reason , so i do n't know how to fix it, 
  yeah , that was the guy that did the voiceover, 
  all i need now is paradiso to come back and i 'll be set, 
  then we take this target , change our flag to it and wave it from the rooftops , shouting `` look !, 
  the *** terrorists *** are after us , we need to become totalitarian to protect our *** freedom ! ^ tm *** '', 
  let 's say hypothetically that this happens ... what does parliament look like ? 
  can key still govern ? 
  crossover episode !, 
  it needs bnw and the polynesian dlc , what happened ? 
  / u/mamba _ 79 - thoughts ? 
  i have a feeling this is either you or a colleague of yours . 
  you 're a law lecturer at uc , right ? 
  depending on your definition of inciting racial disharmony , possibly . 
  but they were n't harassing anyone , afaik, 
  is my comment okay ? 
  fair enough . 
  i was going to say let me know if you want me to delete it , but then i realised you probably do n't need to ask me in the event that it needs to be deleted, 
  at least he did n't start [ shagging her head ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t1vfshyiky ), 
  at least he 's got a good subject now, 
  we should start scouting locations for the second capital when they split then, 
  i 'm pleased someone 's covering the whole spying thing in songs now . 
  i was expecting u2 to cover it in their new album , but they only had one slightly political song, 
  goddamnit labour , sort your shit out . 
  i 'll need a bit more info than that :, 
  who are you trying to play as ? 
  when exactly does it crash ? 
  are there any errors in the logs ( my games / civ 5 / logs , lua one is the most likely to show what the error is ), 
  are you playing with any other mods ? 
  what version of the game are you on ? 
  i ca n't get my sweet , sweet calories from water though ... 
  i thought people did n't like u2 because of bono ? 
  you said that vietnam won the poll , but i just checked and tomatekh 's champa are like 10 votes ahead . 
  what 's going on ? 
  i 've got a sort of hanging sliding door thing between my room and a the bathroom . 
  my cat likes to drink water from the tap in the bath, 
  at 4am , the door is usually a drum from the cat banging her head against it to wake me up, 
  i 'm not worried until there 's a confirmed case form someone who, 
  did n't just return from west africa, 
  is n't involved in treating ebola victims, 
  until then , i 'm fine, 
  screw you, 
  sounds like an acceptable way to win a trip to a&e, 
  so far , all the cases have either been people who live in west africa , where healthcare and doctors are treated with suspicion , people who have been in the region and people who have been dealing with ebola patients . 
  unless you 're going around west africa touching people 's bodily fluids , you do n't have anything to worry about . 
  * police raided the offices of the new zealand herald today after a complaint from anonymous member of the public that an article was damaging to them politically . 
  police refused to comment as to what they were looking for , although it is believed they were looking for evidence linking the new zealand herald to any number of hackers and whistleblowers , including the infamous `` rawshark '' *, 
  cameron slater , a prominent right-wing blogger here better known as * whale oil * . 
  known for having close ties with high ranking members and staff in the national party ( currently the ruling party ) and coordinating attack campaigns against the left . 
  read more about it [ here ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/23/-sp-new-zealand-election-john-key-alleged-dirty-politics ), 
  okay , so with the base game there was a dlc containing a `` polynesia '' civilisation , which had a leader from hawaii , a unique unit from new zealand and a unique improvement from easter island . 
  it also had island names as city names , which meant that one city would be called `` aotearoa '' and another `` te wai pounamu '' , as well as the horrible city names of `` tonga '' and `` samoa . '', 
  so myself and a fairly large group of artists and programmers created this , which took the existing parts of the official civilisation and separated them into more fitting and historical civs based on the regions - hawaii , the maori , rapa nui and tonga . 
  all civs contain support for the following mods : yet ( not ) another earth map pack , events & decisions , piety & prestige , cultural diversity , map labels , historical religions, 
  [ steam workshop ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=323041325 ) | [ direct download ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/260b31miei5l840/polynesian%20civilization%20pack%20%28v%201%29.civ5mod ), 
  the kingdom of hawaii , one of but a few polynesian kingdoms to be ( albeit briefly ) recognised as an independent state , has a large focus on specialists , with small bonuses for warfare ( but not conquest ), 
  * kahuna mastery * - specialists generate double their base yield . 
  receive great people points from combat . 
  unique unit : koa , longswordsman replacement , costs more production but requires no iron . 
  starts with more experience and the amphibious promotion . 
  unique building : heiau . 
  temple replacement that gives a random specialist when built . 
  known for good reason as * the napoleon of the south pacific * , te rauparaha leads the militaristic maori , with bonuses to aid in increasing the size of your army ( and the potential to gain enemy unique units on your side ), 
  * mana of tumatauenga * - every time an enemy unit is defeated in battle , receive 25 % of the production cost towards that unit in the capital . 
  melee units lower the combat strength of adjacent enemy units . 
  unique unit : taiaha warrior , replaces pikeman ; stronger , generates xp faster . 
  upgrades to musketman . 
  nearby units have +5 % combat strength, 
  unique improvement : pa , requires engineering . 
  can be built on hills and provides food , and ca n't be built next to another pa. . boosts military production by 5 % when worked . 
  known the world over for their enormous stone carvings , the rapa nui are a mysterious and enigmatic people who saw their island paradise turn into a hellish prison as a result of their own actions and a changing climate . 
  they are devoutly pious and place great importance on the tradition of the tangata-manu . 
  * kai kai lore * - every time a citizen is born , receive faith . 
  every 10 faith output of a city generates +1 cultural gpp , including faith from new citizens, 
  unique unit : matato'a , replaces composite bowmen . 
  +1 sight , +1 range ( lost on upgrade ) collect a manu tara egg from an unimproved coastal tile on hills without resources , generating +40 gp points to cultural great people and starting a 5 turn wltkd on the city , the process takes 5 turns and ca n't be done on the same tile twice . 
  doing so transforms the unit into a tangata-manu , which is stronger . 
  unique improvement : moai , requires construction . 
  buildable on coast , it yields +2 faith , and +1 culture for each adjacent moai . 
  +1 additional faith when built on a manu tara egg site . 
  one of the great powers of central polynesia , the tu'i tonga empire controlled multiple island chains in an empire stretching from samoa and tikopia to niue , with influence extending to fiji and beyond . 
  they remain among the only polynesian kingdom to have resisted european colonialism as a result of cunning diplomacy and cordial relations between themselves and others , as is represented here .
