  as long as you have bnw and the polynesia dlc , just subscribe and it should show up when you start through the mod menu . 
  make sure the tick next to the mods entry is lit up , then click next and they should be in the game, 
  well , ignoring the precedent set by firaxis with the zulu , iroquois , shoshone , greece and even polynesia itself , this was done mainly to split up the horrible amalgamation which was the polynesian civ , and there 's no point in getting rid of the unique unit assets , especially if you 're already doing a mod of polynesian civs . 
  besides , i think you 're shortchanging the maori a bit . 
  they had more than just ` settlements of a few huts , ' they had hundreds of settlements , many of which were fortified with palisades and featured terraces which had been carved into hillsides , with mechanisms in place to ensure food growth even in hostile conditions . 
  they also had large tribal groups and co-ordination , which often saw proper warfare between them ( such as the siege of kaiapoi ), 
  this mod was mainly just splitting up the stuff from the existing polynesian civ , so we kept it at as few civs as possible ( since it 's already a 50mb download each time we have a bug fix . ), 
  samoa 's potentially on the cards in the future though ( although personally , i 'd prefer to cover some micronesian civs first , some of them built cities offshore ), 
  i think the extent of our nz history coverage through my 5 years of social studies / history at high school was two lessons on parihaka and a bit on the early settlers / treaty of waitangi , but nothing more than that . 
  well , unless you count having any assessment in ncea history require 1/4 of it on the significance to new zealanders . '', 
  i mean , come on . 
  what significance did the nuremberg war crimes tribunal have to ordinary kiwis ? 
  it was mainly because the hawaiian unique unit replaces the long sword , so we did n't want to have two units replace it in the same mod, 
  this is one of the things that i 'm worried about with national 's friendship with america . 
  at a time when america is becoming increasingly isolated and opposed in a lot of the world , we 're seen as cosying up to them , which potentially threatens our position as a good neutral mediator in international affairs . 
  i thought the drone operators were to take out the competition ? 
  strategic drone strikes on stuff and the herald ? 
  updating the default city names was actually one of the [ first mods i did ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=77172103 ), 
  maybe key 's umm-ing and ahh-ing about sending troops in until after the vote , so that if he refuses to get involved he does n't alienate the us and allies on the eve of the vote ? 
  * at the end of the day , i think mr. secretary-general is just , well , a bit of a wimp , really . 
  well , none of the civs have voiceovers , partially because we ca n't animate the leaderscenes to make them look good and partially none of us speak tongan , maori or whatever the hell rapa nui called their language ( probably rapa nui , ) but even if they did the tongan leader is from about the same time as the crusades , so quite a bit before meeting europeans . 
  a british accent might be a tad odd . 
  yeah , but for the most part we try to have historical accuracy where possible . 
  we had that too , even got so far as to form our own political parties and have an election . 
  if anyone thinks that 13 year olds do n't understand politics they should have seen it , that campaign was one of the most bizarre things i 've seen . 
  coalitions which bordered on mafia dealings , backstabbing , even obama style speeches, 
  our logo was nz flipped and rotated to be a tick, 
  i 'm sorry , did i miss the part about the car bombs inspired by foreign fanatics happening over the past 15 years ? 
  or the suicide bombers attacking our military installations ? 
  oh , and how about that time where those pesky foreign fanatics inspired us to start a civil war ? 
  the only way such a thing stands even a remote chance of happening is if we attack is and then proceed to marginalise an entire sector of our society just because of their skin colour and/or religion . 
  well , why did n't he just say that ? 
  when does the occupation of the ureweras begin ? 
  except the mongols grew up in a place where it got just as cold , essentially southern siberia . 
  they 're used to it, 
   or who have mentioned the name of our president vladimir putin, 
  did n't he just do that ? 
  this is n't a secure website , so i 'm going to say to the 17 global intelligence agencies that are listening in that he was kidding just then . 
  oh awesome !, 
  yeah , you 're able to either play as him , against him or both , if you want, 
  there 's a great video from there of a rockfall / avalanche a couple years back , that stopped just before the hut . 
  ca n't find it , though, 
  surely it would be ngati toa , since it 's their chief ingame ? 
   by the way - you can vote on comments as a guest . 
  only upvotes , you need to sign in to downvote it, 
  sorry , went way over my head . 
  at this rate , you 'll probably end up being detained just because you 're middle eastern . 
  i love how you posted this as a comment after reading another comment, 
  arrested under new anti-terror laws ? 
  do you give gold on april fool 's or do you tell people you give them gold , and never do ? 
  i think i found those nat supporters that we were wondering about, 
  / u/jasonedeama, 
  / u/jccrusher, 
  the sad thing is that does n't sound too out of the question at this point, 
  from the current front page of / r/newzealand :, 
  do n't blame me , i voted greens, 
  well , * sorry * for voicing my political views . 
  it 'll land me in prison soon enough anyway , going against party lines and whatnot, 
  of course , da vanci drew fucking tanks and murder-machines and he gets no mention whatsoever, 
  '' ... can get me vca band ... '', 
  okay , yeah . 
  that 's fair enough . 
  i mean , one of the other nats on here got a death threat , which is n't okay . 
  i guess it 's that old voltaire thing, 
  would n't that make us lemmings ? 
  well , it 's not part of the law yet , so no-one, 
  there were a few wars between the maori and the british , but that was n't genocide so much as proper wars . 
  the maori held their own pretty damn well .
