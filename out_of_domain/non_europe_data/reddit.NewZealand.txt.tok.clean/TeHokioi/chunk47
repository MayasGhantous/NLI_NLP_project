  i 'm now in the process of figuring out a way to smuggle whittaker 's chocolate milk into the south island without it going off . 
  any ideas ? 
  could we re-purpose the one which you guys built to escape hamilton before the election ? 
  my guess is gotham city, 
  i had this once . 
  was playing as the suebi and having expanded into central europe i was attacked by gaul and a bunch of western european nations . 
  so i had a front spanning from switzerland through belgium when the eastern nations opened up a second front . 
  i was fighting ww2 in 200bc, 
  have you been reading that story on / r/writingprompts where kanye was one of the four horsemen ? 
  should probably get a lawyer ready for when you hit cuba st with colin craig, 
  you 're thinking of [ judith collins ] ( http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/john-key-not-concerned-about-hager-allegations-that-judith-collins-killed-a-man/ ), 
  so who 's going to take up the mantle of the centre-left party ? 
  anyone want to form a new party ? 
  i think the term you 're looking for is * up from centre *, 
  that means that one like is equal to 100 upvotes , that does n't sound right . 
  yeah and funny how they were stupid enough to vote a dickhead like abbott in . 
  too soon, 
  oh , that happens sometimes with oman too , i dunno what causes it . 
  reloading should fix it . 
  pretty sure we do n't have sats here , but i got excellence endorsements ( top mark ) all through high school and very nearly straight a 's through uni so far and i love u2, 
  i would assume it 's the indian space agency and the guy in that post mislabeled it for whatever reason . 
  ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ all ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ conspiracy ... 
  from shore , maybe, 
  i always thought the sonic grenade things were the scream ? 
  i do n't see it as a widespread issue , more about that particular jp up in epsom . 
  if they did it once , chances are they did it other times and were n't called out on it . 
  what 's that version from ? 
  the one i saw in the movies did n't have the hud and his hand was uncensored, 
  could you imagine if other leaders used it ? 
  * president clinton , did you have sexual relations with monica lewinsky ? 
  * `` not in my capacity as president '' *, 
  take a page from muldoon 's leadership manual ? 
  guy [ posted ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1t7tav/falling_in_love_with_a_danish_girl_while_traveling/ ) about meeting and falling in love with a danish girl while in spain . 
  danish girl sees it and [ posts her story ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1tafiq/the_danish_girl_who_fell_in_love_with_american_guy/ ) of falling in love with him . 
  now apparently they 're living happily ever after in a thai paradise . 
  `` shit '', 
  `` what ? '', 
  `` i posted a picture on reddit and they remembered me '', 
  `` why would you do that ? '', 
  `` well , we have to move again . 
  they 're after us . '', 
  `` where to ? '', 
  `` i dunno , how about namibia ? '', 
  the civilian . 
  a land free from the oppression of hamilton and where deputy leaders have 100 % more juicy goodness . 
  not if you 've got a similar arm to body ratio as t. rex with arms that big, 
  some sauropods could for short periods of time , could n't they ? 
  although you 're probably right in that it could n't be sustained, 
   he knew exactly what he was doing by robing that mcdo . 
  he just did n't want a naked mcdonald 's running around, 
  i doubt one tree hill will be a staple . 
  generally they only play it on their nz ( and australia ) shows , because of the significance of nz in it . 
  beyond that , i 'd like a two part concert - first part is the stadium , big rock stuff . 
  streets , beautiful day , the miracle , breathe and so on . 
  then , the second part they bring out an orchestra , and do more acoustic sort of things . 
  maybe have the second part as a sort of encore , but i think bringing out an orchestra would be great . 
  on an unrelated note , who do i need to talk to to get a gospel choir back for i still have n't found what i 'm looking for ? 
  i completely missed the discussion thread , do you have a link ? 
  i thought i recognised the location !, 
  why not a red and white one , like using the original colours ? 
  i do think there is an element of ` who you know ' in some schools though . 
  at the high school i went to , nearly all of the prefects were children of bot members or prominent staff , with maybe a couple that were n't, 
  where russia launches its rockets from is about as far from the equator as queenstown , so i do n't think distance from the equator is an issue here . 
  holy shit . 
  that would be so cool sitting in the uni library , looking up and seeing a fucking rocket take off over chch, 
  [ we should probably send them some freedom ] ( http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10858183 ), 
  we know that , it 's national and the government that 's driving us full steam ahead towards it . 
  if you do n't voluntarily block the site , we 'll make you voluntarily block the site !, 
  a continent which is so big , it would stretch from hudson bay to haiti, 
  do n't forget , the whole of samoa was n't american , just part . 
  the other part was originally german , and administered by nz as a league of nations mandate until 1962, 
  guardians of the galaxy crossover ? 
   twice the speed of fucking fast, 
  how fast is this in relation to the speed of sound ? 
  i 'm gon na need some measurements here , people . 
  what hole ? 
  huh , completely missed that , thanks !, 
  looks like there 's a path going around to it too , so i 'd say you 're right about it being an entrance or something, 
  not always . 
  willie apiata got the vc and he 's still alive, 
  that 's odd , my [ kea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kea ) does fine in winter, 
  the polynesians were kickass navigators . 
  they did n't just find easter island ( rapa nui ) either , they found it , established contact with south america , traded and gained access to the sweet potato , which then was traded * back * through polynesia to the point where it became a staple crop in new zealand . 
  it was n't until climate change started in earnest that rapa nui became cut off and became a hellish prison, 
  plot twist : it 's peter dunne , key does n't want to turn on allies, 
  i agree , i love the drive over haast pass . 
  not sure why they did n't include it, 
  * i do n't actually have ebola , guys !, 
  i 've never had any game last the full five minutes, 
  that makes a lot more sense , i thought they were saying * pedro ... *, 
  had music going at the same time, 
  whoa , when does this happen ? 
  every time i 've suggested it people say `` lol no '' and `` you have to earn it '', 
  not everyone , it 's still difficult to be the last one standing, 
  with this you would n't need an agreement to get the flair , the agreements are only doing this anyway, 
  he 's actually being pretty damn polite . 
  i thought that too , it 's at the end of the line which has fortify , delete etc on it , not the one where you build an expedition . 
  i always thought alan grant was sort of an indy-style character , having harrison ford play it would have made the movie feel almost like indiana jones and the lost island ^ * or something . 
  not that that 's a bad thing , of course . 
  sam neill probably made the film better , though,
