  ^ * ^ i 'm ^ not ^ good ^ with ^ movie ^ names, 
  imagine thinking that you 're about to become the only people in history ever to have been killed by a dinosaur, 
  * hello , and welcome to your personal * *** translator of pandering political arguments **** , or * *** tppa . 
  *** * today , we examine john key 's claims surrounding potential new security laws !, 
   very narrowly focussed . 
  * read : focused on new zealand *, 
   it 's something we need to do, 
  * read : america and the rest of the five eyes are doing this and we want to catch up . 
   quite quickly, 
  * read : before the public realises , we 'll pass it under urgency *, 
  * that 's all for today folks , see you again next time a politician uses the oxford dictionary and thesaurus to make their goals seem less scary !, 
  you mean the guy that fled after he screwed up a war ? 
  bismarck has a much more positive view around him , and sometimes a key political figure is better than a leader ( if you had australia , canada or nz as a civ , you would n't have queen elizabeth ii as their leader , would you ? 
  you 'd have a head of government ), 
  i 'll give you $ 20 * and * some chocolate milk . ^ *,

  you guys are all too nice , 
  just a heads-up , there are still quite a few bugs with it , so once my exams are over ( last one on wednesday :d ) we 'll begin updating our civs to fix bugs , add new features and so on . 
  we 'll be starting from the beginning ( tibet and kilwa are first off the rank ) , so it may be a while , but we 'll get there before summer 's out . 
  expect a few more civ releases this year , too . 
  [ here 's a preview ] ( http://i.imgur.com/c6kbig1.jpg ) of our next one ... 
  if you find any bugs with polynesia , please let us know so that we know what to fix when we 're going thorough, 
  plus mongolia is just as cold as russia, 
  what 's your steam name ? 
  it 's on me, 
  it does n't . 
  it 's a gameplay vs. realism thing . 
  kamehameha conquered the hawaiian islands to unify them , and the kahuna stuff played into the specialist theme nicely . 
  since we already had a conquest civ , we decided to link the two concepts together . 
  not based in hawaiian culture at all , but instead a gameplay decision to link two aspects of the civ we wanted to cover in such a way that makes it unique, 
  sweet , sent the invite . 
  once you add me i 'll grab it for you, 
  edit : sent , enjoy !, 
   each flag must be an original creation no reposts or plagiarism . 
  this includes submissions to any previous contest . 
  does this include modifying stuff ? 
  like , if i were to use an existing coat of arms as a base to get the shape and then modify it , would it still be allowed ? 
  trying to be as descriptive as possible without giving anything away ... 
  can i have a bit of backstory ? 
  nah , i 've taken an animal and changed it to be something completely different , but kept enough of the original design to keep the heraldic feel that if you knew the original you 'd probably recognise it, 
  * the west wing * tells me a blue texas is possible, 
   it does n't look like ( yet ) the nzsis are going to be granted ` increased powers ', 
  oh , just the gcsb then ? 
  maybe a guest list to a party ? 
  because apparently people will choose to get high instead of drinking wine ? 
  nor do i , i 'm just trying to think of any possible way someone could conceive the idea that there 's a conflict of interest, 
  * it 's the ebola cure you 'll die for !, 
  either [ this one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/flag_of_the_mughal_empire.svg/1000px-flag_of_the_mughal_empire.svg.png ) ( which op used ) or [ this one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/flag_of_the_mughal_empire_%28triangular%29.svg/1000px-flag_of_the_mughal_empire_%28triangular%29.svg.png ) , which i think is more historically accurate, 
  and then we can all hum with pride at sporting events !, 
  to be fair , it 's passed the whole south island by :(, 
  nah , he did n't refuse to have his picture taken . 
  iirc tenzing could n't use the camera or was having issues with it or something , so sir ed had to take the photo of tenzing instead of the other way around . 
  i do n't remember hearing anything about ed refusing to have his picture taken . 
  i do n't think knighthoods can be awarded to people who are n't part of the commonwealth though , which is why tenzing norgay did n't get one, 
  i just looked up his [ wiki page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tenzing_norgay#success_on_mount_everest ) , and it seems you 're right , he was an indian citizen , and india is part of the commonwealth . 
  however , apparently the indian pm refused to give permission for him to be knighted, 
   today 's instant gratification society is causing you to hold unrealistic expectations, 
  not really - here we used to be able to get a letter anywhere in the country within three days ( nz is small , okay ? ), 
  but now it takes upwards of two weeks in most cases, 
  it 'd be interesting to see how close their platform would be to those of other parties . 
  * oh , of course changing the flag is a good idea . 
  it should definitely be prioritised over feeding starving kids !, 
  yeah , this subreddit is full of *** commie-nazi islamic terrorists *** and is in drastic need of some *** freedom ^ tm ***, 
  just going on what i 've been taught at school here . 
  could very well be wrong . 
  i 'd imagine operating a 1950 's camera at the top of the tallest mountain on earth with huge gloves on would n't be the easiest thing in the world to do , though . 
  ... maybe ... 
  i 'd assume what they mean is out in public spaces or whatever . 
  i hate it when i go outside on my break to get some fresh air only to have it stink of cigarette smoke from the 20 smokers that are nearby . 
  it 'd be much better imo even if there were designated smoking areas for it , like they have in japan, 
  i was about to ask what will happen when they keep discovering moons and run out of people he fucked , then i realised that if roman jupiter is anything like how he is as zeus in greek they 've got a * long * way to go, 
  maybe he pretends the years 1943-1945 do n't exist ? 
  no shave november ? 
  we call it ` movember down here , has a much better ring to it imo, 
  to be fair , he 's got the greek genocide on there too , so i 'd assume they 're not all good events, 
  i dunno , i think green beer and the greek genocide are about the same level of crime against humanity, 
  happens when you first meet them , and the bonus is doubled if you are the first to meet them, 
  it 's spelled rhys too , i 've always seen it as rhys for a guy 's name and reece for a girl 's name, 
  maybe the biggest single demonstration in one place would be better ? 
  what i found interesting with scotland 's independence poll though , and i 'll throw a disclaimer in here that i can only find [ this ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/297392/voting-intention-in-scottish-independence-referendum-by-age-group/ ) pre-election polling now , but i remember seeing some other source back afterwards , is that if you break it down by age , every single age bracket under 55 had a majority supporting independence , and it was just the 55 + group that voted against it . 
  i think if you held another referendum on it in 20/30 years the result would be very different, 
  yeah , every catalonian i 've ever met or talked to online seems to be very much in favour of it . 
  i make mods adding civilizations / empires / factions / countries / whatever you want to call them to * civilization v * , and in each comment section there 's someone suggesting i do catalonia as a mod next . 
   voting `` no '' is a good enough boycott, 
  no , it 's not . 
  the point of a boycott is to say that a vote is n't legitimate . 
  if you vote in something , even if you vote against it , that 's not boycotting it , that 's participating in it . 
  if they went to the polls and a majority said no , the story would n't be that they boycotted the vote , the story would be that they voted and it was a no . 
  it 's a good thing people in both camps vote , as it 's the only way to get a true representation . 
  maybe it 's just that the welsh spelling is more common in nz, 
  you could be right , like how people tend to vote more conservative as they get older . 
  i 'd assumed that it was people who had memories of the british empire and having bad impressions of independence . 
  thanks !, 
  because flags and politics go hand-in-hand ? 
  oh whoops , i thought we were talking about the name in general , not his name, 
  one of the mods in the announcement thread said that games , tv shows etc count too, 
  can i keep my new pet tortoise ? 
  why do you think a tv show is n't a literary work ? 
  and , you know , because he 's been dead for ~ 230 years ... 
  wow , that 's such a fantastic argument .
