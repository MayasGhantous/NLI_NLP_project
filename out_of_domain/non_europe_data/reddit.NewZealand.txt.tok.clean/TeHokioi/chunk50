  i think there 's some sort of independence movement or something , they get really shitty if you call them new zealanders and none of their maps acknowledge them as part of nz . 
  northland, 
  watch out , you might need your passport to go there according to winnie, 
  fight those dirty isis ebola commies !, 
  well , everyone else is kind of dead , so unless you want to have the queen and four skeletons then i think aging them wo n't really work, 
  hey , i 'm working with some other modders to try and figure out what 's causing the issue so that it can be solved . 
  would you be able to post a list of all the mods which were active when you saw this happen ? 
  thanks !, 
  would n't that be giving them what they want though , or has the situation changed since then ? 
  `` the fact of the matter is ... '', 
  [ context for those outside nz ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed2jkokgrja ), 
  they were actually used as a location for one of the walking with dinosaurs episodes . 
  [ this ] ( http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131229010447/walkingwithseries/images/d/de/tapejara_near_blowhole.png ) is the best image i can find , but there 's a whole couple scenes set there, 
  the earthquake has only affected christchurch and a few of the surrounding towns , nothing more than half an hour 's drive away . 
  we 're all getting on with life and it has n't really changed much , you just notice a lot more construction sites and builders ( my uni has as many builders as students now ), 
  it depends . 
  some of the new buildings have some cool stuff going on , but a lot of it at the moment is just concrete preslab designed to be built quickly , not to be aesthetically pleasing . 
  that said , the university is getting new buildings in that look miles better than what they have ( [ this is the new science building currently under construction ] ( http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/9349322/canterbury-universitys-1b-building-boost ) ) , but the new buildings that look good probably wo n't start showing up for a couple years at least, 
  yeah , it 's pretty surreal studying there . 
  whole buildings are cordoned off and the route you take to class changes each month . 
  if you end up having your lunch at a normal time , you end up waiting 10 minutes just to order with all the builders there . 
   incidentally i learnt yesterday that karl popper spent some years at canterbury university . 
  yeah , i think they just renamed the history building after him, 
  bit of a long one , but i love it, 
  once upon a time in the kingdom of heaven , god went missing for six days . 
  eventually , michael the archangel found him , resting on the seventh day . 
  he inquired of god , `` where have you been ? '', 
  god sighed a deep sigh of satisfaction and proudly pointed downwards through the clouds , `` look michael , look what i 've made . '', 
  archangel michael looked puzzled and said , `` what is it ? '', 
  `` it 's a planet , replied god , `` and i 've put life on it . 
  i 'm going to call it earth and it 's going to be a great place of balance '' . 
  `` balance ? '', 
  inquired michael , still confused . 
  god explained , pointing to different parts of earth . 
  `` for example , northern europe will be a place of great opportunity and wealth while southern europe is going to be poor ; the middle east over there will be a hot spot . '', 
  `` over there i 've placed a continent of white people and over there is a continent of black people '' god continued , pointing to different countries . 
  `` and over there , i call this place america . 
  north america will be rich and powerful and cold , while south america will be poor , and hot and friendly . 
  and the little spot in the middle is central america which is a hot spot . 
  can you see the balance ? '', 
  `` yes '' said the archangel , impressed by gods work , then he pointed to a smallish land mass and asked , `` what 's that one ? '', 
  `` ah '' said god . 
  `` that 's new zealand , the most glorious place on earth . 
  there are beautiful mountains , rainforests , rivers , streams and an exquisite coast line . 
  the people are good looking , intelligent and humorous and they 're going to be found traveling the world . 
  they 'll be extremely sociable , hard-working and high-achieving , and they will be known throughout the world as diplomats and carriers of peace . 
  i 'm also going to give them super - human , undefeatable , strong in character citizens who will be admired and feared by all who come across them '' . 
  michael gasped in wonder and admiration but then exclaimed , `` you said there will be balance ! '', 
  god replied wisely . 
  `` wait until you see the buggers i 'm putting next to them '', 
  accepted and used are two different things , i 've never heard of anyone or anything being referred to as ` united statian . 
   it 's fucking bullshit that they have completely ignored us and it 's fucking pathetic that they have n't taken 5 minutes out of their fucking day to hotfix this half-assed code issue . 
  oh , so you 've figured out the issue , have you ? 
  speaking from experience with modding , issues are usually way more complicated than they first appear . 
  all of my civ mods with unique improvements have a bug where in dx9 mode their texture is replaced with a red and white checkerboard . 
  we all play dx11 so it does n't come up before release , and only when the mod is released do we here user reports of the glitch . 
  despite being aware of it and it looking like a simple issue to fix , it 's taken us the better part of eight months to have a potential fix ( which we do n't even know for certain will work . ), 
  the same thing could very well be happening here . 
  monitors like that are still quite uncommon , so it 's not unreasonable to assume that firaxis do n't have any . 
  as such , the issue would n't show up at all before release , and only when it goes public do they get reports from people like you that there 's an issue . 
  since in this hypothetical they do n't have any monitors , they would n't be able to reproduce the issue , and would have to run out and buy some just to reproduce the issue . 
  and due to your point about them selling out , there would n't be any stock , so they 'd have to wait for stock just to see what they 're deal with . 
  it 's nigh on impossible to hunt through the code to find an issue without knowing what you 're looking for ( my polynesia pack was delayed by a couple months because the civilopedia was not working and i could n't find any reason why . ), 
  so i think the best course of action here would be patience and not treating the devs like they are sitting around doing nothing just because you have to wait a couple weeks / months . 
  [ not a mashup ( for anyone reading the bot ) - men at work , land down under ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfr9iy5y94s ), 
  [ not a mashup ( for anyone reading the bot ) - m83 , midnight city ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx3k_qdnzhe ), 
  those are the originals, 
  i think it 's because generally the statue of liberty is associated with the huge metropolis of nyc , and seeing it with a big empty , sort of run down place seems weird and unusual . 
  as a side note , the cs of lhasa has been replaced with varanasi, 
  i ended up having an argument with a guy on the steam workshop comments of this mod about tibet 's status , that was great fun, 
  what 's 200k between friends ? 
  i 'm pretty sure the ford that you have marked as skipper 's canyon is actually the arrow river , upstream from arrowtown . 
  that could be another scene , though . 
  i dunno , i found my first year of uni much easier than my last year of high school . 
  that said , i * was * writing 20 page papers for history ... 
  yeah , if memory serves it 's somewhere around [ here ] ( https://www.google.co.nz/maps/@-44.9334198,168.83433,815m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en ) , maybe ten minutes walk from town or so up the riverside . 
  the [ queenstown website ] ( http://www.queenstown.nz.com/lord-of-the-rings.aspx ) lists it as the arrow river , but nothing more specific . 
  god , a balkanised russia would be so great and screw so much up at the same time, 
  nah , he was more defending china than complaining in a general sense . 
  the comments are [ here ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=140851009 ) , page 3, 
  maybe they used both locations for the shot ? 
  the lotr tours go up the arrow to the spot too, 
  i do n't think it 's so much that they got a response , but rather that the response they got was comprehensive and in-depth , instead of just saying `` hobbiton or mt ruapehu '', 
  so , you just want scenic locations in the north island , not necessarily related to lotr , or do you still want lotr locations ? 
  that would make sense . 
  the arrow is much shallower and more docile than the shotover ( which runs through skipper 's canyon ) , so it 's easier to have horses running through etc than the shotover . 
  and suddenly starts to talk with a southern accent ? 
  to be fair , it was pretty stupid to engineer a huge , hyperintelligent dinosaur with huge teeth . 
  if you 're going to make a dinosaur that you want to be a good attraction , give it the big teeth and all that but do n't give it any real strength . 
  or make it die when it leaves the enclosure or something . 
  based on the last bit , it looks as though the raptors are either genetically altered or trained properly too, 
  i want to play as the jutes just for the huscarls or the danes for the super dragonships, 
   `` about this game :, 
   *** fireworks simulator !!!, 
  such a fantastic description, 
  evil western imperialists . 
  i would n't be surprised , it would fit perfectly . 
  batmobile 1.0 can be a nice classic aston martin, 
  generally companies which have big productions ( like firaxis , with civilization and 2k as the publisher ) have a lot more hurdles which they need to clear prior to releasing a patch . 
  indie developers and modders do n't have this , so can release patches and hotfixes much quicker than big games can .
