  no no no , you 're thinking of the imperial dairy model . 
  we switched from that in 1969, 
  you aussies trying to steal our slang now , too ? 
  -- new zealand, 
  pretty sure the definition of tourism is that the people * do n't * stay , so it 'd have next to no impact on the property values . 
   will we be great stewards of this land or not ? 
  not at the rate we 're going now . 
  holy shit , it 's so refreshing to have a * proper * answer to a question for once . 
  bill english actually treats him with respect instead of just mocking him like key does . 
  if he 'd asked john this question , the answer to the whole thing would have been `` no . '', 
  yeah , but he gave at least one proper answer , which is usually one more than john, 
  i like to picture the writers sitting in the glass conference room on the set to write the show, 
  but then how do they organise golf !? 
  just , for the love of god , make sure you remember the second j. 
  and if you change the setting this could easily be an `` adult '' experience too . 
  guy and his mate go to a bar , meet some chicks and start talking etc. 
  she turns out to be crazy , he leaves and she accuses him of rape . 
  i 've never been able to trust him since * chuck *, 
  not here in nz , he was a huge part of our election and now he 's still in the process of a long series of court battles, 
  i would love it if they brought back bullet the blue sky ... 
  i missed it on the 360 tour :(, 
   and the next night ( experience ) will be songs from their career . 
  like : new years day , until the end of the world bullet the blue sky unforgettable fire stay streets one etc. 
  what if experience has songs off songs of experience ? 
  i do n't know why this is where you can reach me now has n't been getting any love . 
  i think it would be amazing live , the opening seems made for it and i can see the band cutting out and the whole audience singing * soldier , soldier !, 
  that goes without saying though , right ? 
  why would they have a connection in australia ? 
  oh , i was confused . 
  i thought you meant akl  mel  scl , not mel  akl  scl , which would be going three hours in the wrong direction . 
  there 's talk of it being released after this leg and before the outdoors tour - i would n't be surprised if we had some songs from soe like we had ebw and north star in the 360 tour, 
  as long as they come to nz , too :(, 
  yeah , we 're just able to focus on more than one thing at once, 
  stuff : pretty much everywhere 's last week , today !, 
   the liberty policy affects all wonders , however . 
  tradition , is n't it ? 
  workers build improvements faster is in liberty , is that it ? 
  citizenship , iirc, 
  just did , it was pretty good , thanks !, 
  i spent way too long trying to figure out how you could slice already sliced bread so that it was thicker . 
  because the taliban has an awful lot of tanks ? 
  implying that an anti-tank missile would n't have use against tanks as the primary design goal . 
  of course , but if that 's going to be the case in the majority of situations which you 're facing , then surely you 'd be better off buying surface to air missiles , or anti-personnel missiles , or something that would have your goal as the primary function, 
  i thought it was a jungle gym, 
  saw him on firstline this morning , trying to claim that it had nothing to do with australia joining the fight against isis . 
  i mean , come on . 
  really ? 
  he 's gon na go full on cortez on monty 's ass, 
  there are [ some ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1izufd/why_have_jews_been_persecuted_by_so_many_groups/ ) [ great ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1niu47/why_are_jews_so_hated_historically/ ) [ / r/askhistorians ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1005c0/what_caused_jews_to_be_hated_so_much_through_out/ ) [ posts ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1b1z2x/why_was_there_such_hatred_against_jews_before_and/ ) on the subject ( each word is a different one ) , but basically it seems to boil down to a number of different reasons , including what / u/gaiusaurus pointed out . 
  as for the `` they killed jesus '' argument , it 's not so much that they killed him as when early preachers of christianity were trying to get romans to convert , they * said * that the jews killed him . 
  would n't have really gone that well if they went around saying `` oh hey , join our faith . 
  by the way , your people killed your saviour , so good luck getting into heaven , '' which is what would have led to an early hatred of jews amongst roman converts, 
  god , the fb comments on it were just as bad . 
  most of them were some variation of `` opportunistic politics ? 
  try opportunistic journalism ! '', 
  i love how there are three guys just catching up in the middle of it all, 
  reminds me of [ a ( joke ) icon ] ( http://i.imgur.com/91dqjbv.png ) we created for a civ 5 mod a while ago, 
   you 're not in favor of neutrality . 
  i am . 
  if you insist on excluding points of view you think are wrong , you 're in favor of censorship . 
  i 'm not . 
  i 'm a libertarian and i believe very strongly in political tolerance . 
  am i right in assuming this means you 're giving equal footing to all arguments ? 
  this seems like a very problematic approach , especially with something like what / u/rodents210 pointed out that has an overwhelming scientific basis in favour of one point . 
  if you had people claiming the earth was flat , would you let that stand in favour of neutrality ? 
  it 's actually a giant game of geopolitical chicken between saudi arabia and iran , which accidentally caused an economic collapse in russia , but yeah . 
  which one are you looking at ? 
  i just see the normal nz flag . 
  if the op wanted an nz separatist flag though , they could probably use the [ tuhoe ] ( http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/n/nz_tmmt2.gif ) one or the [ new munster cross ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/zealandia_proposal_1.png ) for the south island separatism . 
  1 month `` check to see if game is released '', 
  oh wow , i completely missed that . 
  i like the new munster cross better personally as a flag , but that 's pretty awesome anyway, 
  to be fair , it 's been a thing longer than nz has, 
  honestly , south island nationalism is barely a thing , most people do n't know about it . 
  there 's not really any one set flag that 's better than the other , so i think it comes down to personal preference . 
  i think the new munster cross has more political standing due to it 's use by ` lobby groups , ' but really i just think it 's a better flag . 
  either would be good , though, 
  * jesus take the ball !, 
  he does n't need bribes , all the other countries are going to mysteriously suffer natural disasters the day before judging . 
  i 'd love that . 
  maybe something like / r/casualdebate instead ? 
  yeah . 
  other times it 's just an agreement thing at the start of a sentence , where nah is pretty much just a filler , like * yeah . 
  nah , you 're right . 
  reminds me of when i was in japan , and i tried to teach my homestay family `` ka pai '' - turns out that in japanese the word for `` cheers ! '', 
  when you toast your drinks is `` kanpai '' and so because of my shit japanese they were all saying `` ka pai '' when they toasted their drinks all night . 
  since chur is an abbreviated form of the other type of cheers i thought it was somewhat relevant . 
  okay , bad example . 
  it is used as filler though , maybe something like this is better ? 
   * hey , you decided when the bbq is ? 
  yeah . 
  nah , i 'll probably just have it next saturday *, 
  okay , that 's a pretty terrible example too . 
  i give up . 
  it ai n't that hard . 
  i think it 's all of the above , and then some more we have n't figured out yet . 
  this is why john key 's such an effective politician , he can say `` yeah , nah '' and it means anything people want it to mean, 
  i thought the second reich was the german empire , which ended with the end of ww1 ? 
  turning my pc monitor upside down is a bit harder, 
  that 's like saying having your car catch fire is better than having your house catch fire .
