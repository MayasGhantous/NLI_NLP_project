  great find !, 
  42 degrees seems low for a hottest recorded temperature . 
  do n't get me wrong , that 's fucking hot as a normal temperature but i would have thought the hottest ever in nz would be more than that, 
  i think they found the ones on the 1970 's stamp , but not the one on the earlier stamp, 
  the supermarket ? 
  or is that too specific ? 
  i was thinking mob , but that 's not really specific to * the * mob and is just any largish group of slightly annoyed people,

   however our airforce is already relying on 30 year old airframes which should be replaced sooner rather than later . 
  you think that 's bad ?

  our right wing party is still about the same as the democrats ... not that i do n't despise them and count down the days until we 've got a left-wing government , but still, 
  maybe he even has eleven ... 
  i reckon you should do it like some of the sports tournaments do , and have more points for a win . 
  something like 5 points for winning , 3 for a draw , 1 for a loss and nothing for dcs ( or 3-2-1-0 if you think 5 is too much ) . 
  that way you 're still earning degrees no matter what , but winning gives you them much faster and still has that incentive . 
  sweet , thanks . 
  changed the exit portals , now i just need to know how to edit the end-zone portals to have a cooldown of 0, 
  is n't that what we were supposed to be doing in afghanistan ? 
  i think the main image of the army in recent years has been in peacekeeping and disaster relief roles - not so much fighting actual wars as cleaning up after them and being a part of the solution , not part of the problem . 
  other than bridges , was there anywhere else that this had significant use ? 
  venice was probably singled out because that 's the main place where underwater masonry would have been used , if anywhere, 
  i think it would have been back in the 70 's at least, 
  was that the chch meetup ? 
  how was it , i was going to go but then got called into work last minute, 
  at least it 's better that it blue screened now instead of the day before you submitted your honours project, 
  there 's also [ this post ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/fiftyfifty/comments/2svg1w/5050_lindsay_lohan_downblouse_gif_nsfw_this_poo/cnt7hsi ) which seems somewhat out of character, 
  that was jeremy wells on the breakfast show , was n't it ? 
  stuff wants people to tip * while in tipping countries . 
  * the last part makes a lot of difference, 
  oh well that 's just the guy being pretentious . 
  the article as a whole though is talking about how new zealanders do n't tip when travelling overseas in countries where tipping is common, 
  new zealand checking in , same thing here . 
  unless absolutely necessary , never ^ * quit without having another job lined up to go into . 
  ^ * this excludes stuff like going on an oe or whatever , or if you 're moving . 
  but yeah , do n't quit unless you 've got plans on what you 're doing , be they another job , traveling or whatever . 
  can someone eli5 why austria is in belgium and not austria ?

   yes . 
  the entire country is on one tectonic plate . 
  you 're clearly not a geography kind of person . 
  not sure if you 're being sarcastic or not , but in case you 're not i feel like i should point out that we 're not on one tectonic plate , we 're on two . 
  [ the alpine fault is the plate boundary ] ( http://www.teara.govt.nz/files/m-4398-enz.jpg ) , and the south island is pretty well fucked if it goes . 
  it 's actually better to be on a single plate if you want to be safe from earthquakes , look at the american midwest or the uk , they 're in the middle of plates and have no earthquakes . 
  everywhere you see 8.0 and larger quakes are on major plate boundaries - chile , alaska , japan , indonesia and new zealand . 
  if we were just on the one plate and further away from the plate boundary , earthquakes would be of next to no concern for us . 
  given we 're on two plates though , we 're prone to huge , damaging quakes . 
  i 'm in ilam / avonhead , they 're going down our street until the intersection before my place , skip my block and start again at the next intersection : /, 
  well , you ca n't really be on the boundary of just one plate , but i have a feeling you 're meaning it as in the whole country being on one side of the boundary . 
  either way , if the earthquake occurred on the plate boundary it would n't matter what side you were on . 
  what 's more the issue is the size of the earthquake - a small country like the vatican could be leveled by an earthquake , but somewhere like new zealand would need a catastrophically huge earthquake larger than anything ever recorded in the history of human civilisation in order to even be significant across the whole country . 
  to give some context of the size ( and because i go into way more detail than is needed ) , the 8.8 magnitude earthquake which hit chile in 2010 was reported as being felt as ` significant ' across roughly 10 degrees of latitude . 
  ^ \\ ( [ source ] ( http://blogs.agu.org/tremblingearth/2011/03/12/japan-quake-felt-over-2500km-radius/ ) ) this is roughly 4 times bigger ^ \\ ( [ source ] ( http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/how_much_bigger.php ) ) than the largest recorded earthquake in new zealand 's history ( the 8.2 earthquake in the waiarapa , 1855 , which raised wellington quite a bit . ), 
  now , with chile the earthquake was offshore , and due to the geography of south america most of those places had a direct line of sight , so to say , to the epicentre . 
  in contrast , new zealand has mountain ranges and other changes of geography in the way , so you 'd need a much larger earthquake - to give an example , the 7.8 magnitude earthquake in dusky sound , 2009 had only a significant impact [ in and around fiordland ] ( http://info.geonet.org.nz/download/attachments/950454/pga%20dusky%20sound.png ) , whereas the christchurch earthquake was felt reasonably strongly [ across most of the eastern south island ] ( http://info.geonet.org.nz/download/attachments/950450/felt_responses.jpg ) , despite being smaller . 
  given this , you 'd probably need at least a magnitude 9 to be felt nationwide , assuming the earthquake was in cook straight . 
  but this guy is wanting more damage , so you 'd need to get even bigger still . 
  even the largest earthquake ever recorded , a 9.5 in similar conditions to the 2010 chile earthquake , only had mostly [ severe shaking , with moderate to heavy damage ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/1960_valdivia_earthquake.jpg ) according to the usgs , although this time on a scale roughly similar to the size of nz ( parallel to it , too ) . 
  so you 'd probably need the biggest earthquake ever , upwards of a magnitude 10 . 
  last time this happened , it needed an asteroid to hit earth to cause it , which accidentally resulted in the extinction of the dinosaurs , ^ \\ ( [ source ] ( https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=qmwt9iaya9gc&amp;pg=pa246&amp;lpg=pa246&amp;dq=chicxulub+earthquake+magnitude&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yap5_s5p8t&amp;sig=q2gvxsacck1i0fpghrrez6bkcse&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=omdbvo6raebamqwr-ydgda&amp;ved=0cbwq6aewaa#v=onepage&amp;q=chicxulub%20earthquake%20magnitude&amp;f=false ) ) so short of an asteroid smashing into wellington i think he 's out of luck , regardless of plate tectonics .

  new zealand did a pretty good job in the scheme of things . 
  sure , we fought a couple wars over land and tried to stop the new generation from learning the culture at one point , but we 're one of the few countries to have a proper treaty between native and immigrant populations , which is still the subject of settlements to this date . 
  we 've also had a resurgence of maori culture , to the point that [ one of our most iconic songs that everyone in nz knows ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqluygs0iaq ) is in maori , and a lot of maori words are commonly used amongst the pakeha population too - including the word pakeha itself , ka pai ( awesome ) , kia ora ( hello ) , kai ( food ) and so on . 
  [ zealand ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zealand ) is in denmark , but that 's not what * new * zealand is named after . 
  new zealand is named after [ zeeland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zeeland ) , in the netherlands . 
  pretty much , yeah . 
  they literally invented trench warfare , and had fortified villages which could stand up to cannon and gunfire . 
  my old history teacher used to tell a story about how during ww2 , the maori battalion was fighting in north africa and ran out of grenades , so they started throwing rocks and the germans retreated because they were worried they were outgunned , so to speak, 
  whenever i see that , i wonder what the reaction would be if the all blacks came out one time and performed it as the haka,

  and i know you reddit , because you found the post i made asking for advice in the middle of the whole shitstorm ( after you stalked my whole post history ) and shared it with the other girl involved . 
  thanks for that , by the way , she came and apologised for the whole thing , now that she finally saw through your bullshit and realised i actually gave a shit about her . 
  i 'm not sure if the discovery of that post had any effect on you , or whether it had anything to do with you getting drunk and writing a whole bunch of poetry , but i hope it at least finally made you realise that i was n't the sociopath out of us two . 
  but i 'm over it , finally . 
  i 'm not going to hide and avoid you if i see you , or pretend that you 're invisible .
