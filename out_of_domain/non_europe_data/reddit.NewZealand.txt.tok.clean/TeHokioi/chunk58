  hell , i 'd probably even respond if you tried talking to me on here . 
  i mean , it 's not like we have n't been talking on here anyway , and you know that . 
  but that 's been as strangers , since you ca n't give away that it 's you , right ? 
  it 's almost funny in a sort of twisted , ironic way . 
  after all the shit we went through , and having not spoken or seen you in over a year , i 'm still the first person you talked to this year . 
  yeah , we 're not perfect , even now - prison rates and socio-economic standings are testament to that . 
  parihaka was a dark day in nz history , but thankfully we 're better than that now, 
  nz was settled at a similar time to australia though , and their record of dealing with indigenous populations is absolutely atrocious, 
  well , it 's officially sung in maori and english , but if you listen to the crowd it 's pretty much humming and english, 
  i thought they did n't start being used until ww1 ? 
  dominican republic had a picture of the virgin mary too, 
  nah , there 's been a couple others . 
  the garden one comes to mind , and i think there was another one after that, 
  binge drinking and a drunken haka , iirc . 
  do they still have that kiwi bar set up for the olympics ? 
  there are probably slightly more efficient methods to destroy evidence, 
  i reckon they need to do that with the week between christmas and new year - just make the whole week public holidays . 
  it 's not like anyone outside retail gets anything done in that time , anyway, 
  i 'll admit that i preordered it yesterday , mainly because gmg had a promo on where i could get it for 23 % off - so i was able to get it and the viking dlc for a price that i probably would n't be able to get it at for at least 6 months post release , during which time i could be playing the game still . 
  as well as this , i never had any of the bugs people were complaining about at release on the same scale, 
  i wonder with the racing games whether it 'd be good to have two people on the blue team ( even if they 're off in a corner ) , just so that people can get degrees from racing ? 
  if i ever find a location like that where petra would be amazing , i usually rush liberty and get the closer at about the same time petra becomes available , giving me a great engineer and allowing me to get it in a brand new city instead of having it build the wonder of its own accord, 
  why would n't it be a good idea , given it 's not a skody dive ? 
  gives experience in a job which kiwis pretty much always do on their oe, 
  nah , that 'd be a decent place to work , i think they only take students though ? 
  there 's a few down here in chch , but every time they march there 's always a crowd several times bigger opposing them, 
  plus there 's sure to be the annual tradition of waitangi mudslinging to be reported on, 
  turkey has shown signs of being willing to accept an independent kurdistan , in light of the growth of isis . 
  i think if isis expand further down into iraq/syria and grow in strength more turkey may support an independent kurdistan as a buffer state , on the condition that they renounce their claim to turkish kurdistan . 
  nepal would n't be keen on a kingdom , they [ overthrew the monarchy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nepalese_civil_war ) and established a republic in 2008, 
  that 's because they 're too busy chasing up people going 5km over the speed limit . 
  [ yes , it is . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0ya618x.jpg ) add to that another 1300 hours in the sdk , modding it, 
  sometimes they even pay you to do it , but that 's during annual events, 
  not a travel agent , but i would n't mind if it meant i got a fancy flair . 
  i tend to go overboard on the travel advice posts anyway, 
  mate of mine went last year , still not quite sure what went on over there but from what i can gather most of it was as a result of booze being very cheap over there . 
  he mentioned waking up in the kitchen of a different hostel one time after a night out , with two drunk danish guys playing guitar nearby . 
  then there was this story , which is quoted directly from him :, 
   lem me tell you about my week i got super high and then i partyed with some randoms and then i put tomatoes down some guys pants and crack, 
  probably wouldnt do tomato fest again its a once in a lifetime thing i guess, 
  id watch people beat the crap out of each other to get some ham on top of a greasy pole again, 
  highlight of the festival btw, 
  but thats it, 
  so yeah , make of that what you will , i guess, 
  i work in a storeroom of a reasonably busy retail store , i pretty much do that for a living . 
  reddit meetup in a hospital !, 
  it 's the quote for horseback riding in civ 5 , so it 's entirely possible op only knows it from there ( hell , i did n't know about it until seeing it in civ 5 ), 
  is that legal ? 
  i was like that when i tried to read the iliad back in high school ... 
  god , two sentences into his response and he 's already taken a shot at the greens and pulled out that whole `` most new zealanders '' bullshit . 
  i do n't know if i want to keep reading it, 
  i got all excited at first because of the loop bit making it sound like a different song , so i thought it was going to be one which we 'd never heard before . 
  still loved it when he started running to stand still ( and made a sort of mix thing of the whole performance cutting out the speaking ) but would have been amazing hearing a whole new song, 
  seems batman 's absence has caused a power vacuum , filled with multiple people competing to post the day of the week . 
  exciting stuff, 
  on another note , is anyone 's text on here suddenly bigger than usual ? 
  i 'm not zoomed in or anything , just the text in comments is bigger and it 's scaring me, 
  glad i 'm not the only one !, 
  oh wow , so this is supposed to be permanent ? 
  in which case , thanks for the link , it had [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/2tw6pm/reddit_change_changes_to_default_text_styling/co2yh8w ) in it with a link to a userstyle reverting it to normal , which makes everything okay in the world . 
   german was dutch, 
  you sure he was n't saying deutsch ? 
  centered on the island of crete , largest island of the aegean , the minoan civilisation was both technologically and culturally one of the most advanced nations of its age . 
  renowned across the eastern mediterranean for the quality of their frescoes and palatial architecture , minoan artisans were in high demand throughout the bronze age as word of their skill followed the trade routes , with minoan frescoes adorning palaces as far away as egypt . 
  but their skill was not limited to peaceful endeavour , indeed the minoan navy was greatest and most powerful fleet in the mediterranean , serving to protect both minoan holdings and her trade routes from piracy and invasion . 
  however , no navy could protect the minoans from thera , a supervolcano just kilometres north of crete , the eruption of which brought about the end of the minoan civilisation in but a single day and night , adding the legend of atlantis as one of the many mythological tales inspired by europe 's first great civilisation . 
  * pax minoica * - enter a golden age when your first coastal city is founded . 
  start the game with 1 additional trade route, 
  ** unique unit : ** gal\u00e9a , replaces the trireme . 
  cheaper and slightly weaker , but had +1 movement and can enter rival territory . 
  generates +2 gold per turn when stationed within two tiles of the destination city of a trade route . 
  ** unique building : ** anaktora , replaces library . 
  +1 happiness , +2 in coastal cities . 
  in addition to standard library effects , during golden ages , each naval troute to a city with an anaktora generates additional +2 science .

  first of all , thanks to / u/sukritact for the amazing as always artwork , and / u/leugi for the equally fantastic leaderscreen and unit model !, 
  sukritact also covered the e & amp ;d support , and the lua alongside / u/jessefrederickdaly . 
  / u/reedstilt wrote the pedias , and / u/charlatanalley recorded the amazing dom voiceover . 
  meanwhile , i just covered the xml and hoped nothing broke . 
  he lives !, 
  well , that 's a tad disappointing . 
  finally released a * civilization v * mod i 've been working on for over a year , and it got barely any attention on / r/civ . 
  before it , no modded civ i 'd posted got less than about 50 comments or 500 upvotes , but this one did n't even reach 10 comments or 100 upvotes . 
  bit of a shame having something which you work so long on get such little attention . 
  put it up last night before going to bed , so probably early morning us time . 
  how much are vigilante roles paying these days ? 
  it adds the minoans as a civ , there 's a screenshot album [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/lstg0 ) - let me know what you think ? 
  it triggers the golden age , so if your capital is coastal you get the ga right at the start, 
  they do get a coastal bias given their focus - london is n't coastal and they have coastal start bias because they 're a naval civ, 
  he 's allergic to having to say what day it is, 
  jfd just updated gedemon 's ynaemp to include a bunch of new maps , including one of the aegean in preparation for the upcoming greek split by more civs, 
  flat science , a % boost or science per pop , iirc, 
  til serving trays are bullet proof, 
  i think if it turned out to be a publicity stunt it would n't be too well received , more trouble than it 's worth, 
  it 's part of a bigger project called [ more civilisations ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=494241 ) , so you may have read about a different one when i was working on that . 
  i 've got a write up from the / r/civ post for this one though , so i 'll just copy that here i guess :, 
  centered on the island of crete , largest island of the aegean , the minoan civilisation was both technologically and culturally one of the most advanced nations of its age . 
  renowned across the eastern mediterranean for the quality of their frescoes and palatial architecture , minoan artisans were in high demand throughout the bronze age as word of their skill followed the trade routes , with minoan frescoes adorning palaces as far away as egypt .
