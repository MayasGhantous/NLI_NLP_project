  however , no navy could protect the minoans from thera , a supervolcano just kilometres north of crete , the eruption of which brought about the end of the minoan civilisation in but a single day and night , adding the legend of atlantis as one of the many mythological tales inspired by europe 's first great civilisation . 
  * pax minoica * - enter a golden age when your first coastal city is founded . 
  start the game with 1 additional trade route, 
  ** unique unit : ** gal\u00e9a , replaces the trireme . 
  cheaper and slightly weaker , but had +1 movement and can enter rival territory . 
  generates +2 gold per turn when stationed within two tiles of the destination city of a trade route . 
  ** unique building : ** anaktora , replaces library . 
  +1 happiness , +2 in coastal cities . 
  in addition to standard library effects , during golden ages , each naval troute to a city with an anaktora generates additional +2 science .

  looks like we 've got a bot fight on our hands ... 
  really ? 
  yet another s shaped map ? 
  i 'm not saying it would n't play differently , the newest s shaped one ( that i forgot the name of ) does feel ( at least a bit ) different to the other ones . 
  it 's more a comment that it 's beginning to feel like anything not s or butt shaped does n't stand a chance of being selected , not a comment on the map itself, 
  it 'd be good to get some feedback on s-circuit , given it was my first submitted map so i 'd need to know what to work on . 
  map : http://maps.jukejuice.com/show/5631, 
  i was thinking it had almost a bit of a last supper vibe going on, 
  last time i played pool i put a hole in the guy 's ceiling , but it 's still probably better than throwing sharp objects . 
  pls . 
  is it too early to bring out the pitchforks ? 
  that 's a bit macabre, 
  labour would n't stand a chance if they changed leader again before the election , regardless of who it goes to, 
  30 minutes and 5 minute games would be great . 
  the amount of times i 've got to within sight of the flair and had time run out is getting annoying now . 
  i saw the scene , but there was a bit of glare and it looked like he was using it as a shield from the gunfire . 
  could be wrong though, 
  it 's [ whangamomona ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whangamomona ) all over again . 
  although this time with a shittier name . 
  a country does n't need the word `` independent '' in its name , and you 're not a people 's republic unless you 're wanting to go full-on commie . 
  i was trying to figure out the same thing, 
  best *, 
  at least you 're on the right island , right ? 
  wait , what ? 
  how many people are needed to get the flair ? 
  that sucks - we had 3 in our last game and a guy who does n't have it reached the mario flair , but did n't get it, 
  if there 's still not enough i 'll probably just go to centra , it 's only 200 ping there, 
  so wait , it only works on that random thing ? 
  i could n't change it back to just atlas ? 
  it 's another mod , from [ here ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=528549 ) . 
  as long as there 's another one tomorrow - i have to work all day today :(, 
  no , but it sure as hell looks good . 
  i wish there was n't a minimum player count , diameter 's dead this time of morning, 
  eh , possibly but probably not . 
  the whole flag debate is brought up by john key ( our prime minister ) whenever he wants to pass some controversial legislation or is in hot water . 
  he 's like `` ooh , change the flag ! '', 
  and suddenly all the media attention is on that and not the political crisis . 
  it pisses me off to no end that it works, 
  nah , if it was vintage arcade the top five players would all be called `` aaa '', 
  have you got a bigger image of this ? 
  i 'd love to have it as my wallpaper, 
  i think anyone other than jk would be a near certain defeat for national , i have a feeling people are voting for him as a person instead of his politics . 
  except i do n't think there 's any senior national figure who either has n't lost before or has n't had a big scandal since national took power, 
  iirc osaka castle has an elevator in it, 
  last years campaign was probably the furthest thing from a campaign about the team as a whole as is possible . 
  given that , it 'd make the shift to a new leader a lot harder , so any shift would make it very difficult for a national . 
  i suppose literally doing nothing is better than a repeat of some of labour 's performances over the past 3 years, 
  calling it now , post election headline of 2017 : * `` little wins big '' *, 
  the problem with something like this , is that we 're stuck with a set number of civs and city states . 
  you ca n't have any more than 22 civs without a dll modification , and total number of individual civs and city states ca n't exceed 63 ( +1 for the barbarians , so 64 . ), 
  as well as this , you ca n't easily add a new player in the middle of the game , so you need to reserve a set number of spots from the beginning for civs / city states which would be borne of revolution . 
  this has the effect of not only meaning you 're going to have fewer civs at the start of the game , but also that a revolution can only happen a certain number of times before you run out of reserved slots . 
  ultimately it would be possible , however engine limitations make it extremely difficult to fit effectively into gameplay without compromising too much, 
  maybe the return of hone too ? 
  not sure , i think we 'll probably find out this weekend though . 
  the harawiras usually have quite a presence at waitangi, 
  crusade , raiders , crystal skull , doom, 
  i have n't had this , but i 've had a couple times in firefox where i join the game and i get just the black game window but ca n't see anything else , other than the chat . 
  no map or anything, 
  belacqua was awesome with this the other day . 
  he was on the server with two of us who were trying to get mario flair , talking us through it . 
  i 'd managed to get to the top about three times beforehand but never get the double jump quite right to get onto the explosions , but after waiting for just under a couple minutes up the top he talked me through getting the double jump right , allowing me to finally get the mario flair . 
  he then did the same in the next couple games with people in the same situation, 
  i really hope this is just the normal mp posting stuff , i swear if he tries another coup it 'd be the death of labour, 
  i was in the supermarket here in new zealand the other day , and noticed these weird bottles in the drinks fridge . 
  turns out they were half litre bottles of mexican coca-cola , in really tall and thin glass bottles . 
  never seen anything like them before over here , even though we have a lot of drinks in glass bottles, 
  ah genghis khan , a true environmentalist . 
  i remember reading a book about a guy traveling through the congo , and he talked a bit about the most popular beer brand in the country . 
  they did this with their bottles , and all of them would be sent back to the factory . 
  you 'd end up with these bottles which had cuts and scratches and all this from being used in fights or left on the street or whatever , which meant each one had character, 
  maybe [ promo spoiler ] ( / s `` the person he killed was someone he thought killed his wife , before he knew brick did it ? 
  if that person was part of the league it 'd also give another reason why they 're after him '' ), 
  i see them as having different purposes . 
  cadbury makes the sort of chocolate which is used in the same way as lollies , as a special treat or whatever . 
  whittakers is a more proper chocolate that is n't as limited , for lack of a better explanation . 
  is n't there some drug that makes time seem faster when you 're on it ? 
  maybe he * thinks * it 's only been a week ? 
  damn , that end sequence with reddington and the shotgun was great , especially with the music . 
  reminds me of the johnny cash one they had earlier, 
   it 's just as idiotic as accusing a black person for being racist towards a white person . 
  yes , it 's exactly like that . 
  if a black person is being racist towards a white person , why should n't they be accused of being racist ? 
  racism is racism , no matter the race of the people involved , just like sexism is sexism , no matter the sex of the people involved . 
   in may 1991 it was key 's turn . 
  he corroborated richards 's evidence and assured investigators he too could recall the lunch they had had and events during it ... 
  he could recall something ? 
  are we sure it 's the same guy ? 
  in that case , we should invent a career-ending scandal that never happened . 
  he 'll remember it perfectly and resign over it .
