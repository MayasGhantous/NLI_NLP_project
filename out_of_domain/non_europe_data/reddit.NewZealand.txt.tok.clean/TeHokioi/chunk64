  wait , bad example . 
  [ here ] ( http://teleprt.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wellington.jpg ) . 
  shit , no , ignore that . 
  bad example again . 
  okay , [ this time ] ( http://www.maui.co.nz/sitecollectionimages/locations-holiday/large-christchurch.jpg ) . 
  bugger , still no . 
  okay , [ one more shot ] ( http://www.holidaysqueenstown.co.nz/images/bg1.jpg ), 
  eh , i give up . 
  i love this place . 
  in all seriousness , people generally leave because they 're bored of nz for whatever reason , i guess it 's because ` auckland ' and ` wellington ' do n't really have the same sex appeal and allure of places like `` new york '' or `` paris . '', 
  it 's also miles away from everywhere , like how in europe you can go to another country for lunch if you want , here it 's a 3 hour plane trip to the closest country , and even then you 're only in australia and you 'd probably have been better off staying in nz . 
  to get to europe means spending at least a full day in transit , often more . 
  do n't worry , not liking auckland is perfectly normal for a kiwi . 
  all those damn jafas ... 
  oh well yeah , i get leaving for an oe and coming back after a couple months / a year or so , but i do n't get leaving for australia permanently or whatever, 
  they 'll look pretty stupid when the mining industry collapses, 
  auckland 's okay , but it 's pretty much a [ generic city type ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/1-nz-street-of-auckland.jpg ) thing you 'd find anywhere . 
  it 's got [ some ] ( http://www.virtualoceania.net/newzealand/photos/coast/auckland/nz1058.jpg ) decent [ beaches ] ( http://auckland-west.co.nz/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/p1190146aw.jpg ) , and a pretty cool [ museum ] ( https://images.ehive.com/accounts/3268/profiles/images/3nn5ev_vhq_l.jpg ) , but most kiwis tend to ignore auckland whenever possible . 
  wellington is my absolute favourite city on earth . 
  it 's got [ an ] ( http://www.naturespic.com/i/42768tc00_m.jpg ) awesome [ waterfront ] ( http://www.virtualoceania.net/newzealand/photos/cities/wellington/suburbs/orientalbay/nz0263.jpg ) , [ lots of pedestrian-only streets ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/6/60/20080608054729!cuba_street_in_summer.jpg ) and these [ awesome little alleyways ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/44248379.jpg ) with some of the best coffeeshops in the country in them that you could easily walk past for years without realising . 
  that 's pretty much what i like most about wellington , how there 's always stuff that you can still find after living there for years . 
  i remember one time going into a bookshop on [ lambton quay ] ( http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1337813179/457/6977457.jpg ) , going up to the third floor and out the back door into a little back alley , where you could climb another flight of stairs into this awesome rooftop restaurant / bar with views right over the area . 
  that 's just in the cbd too , you can take a cable car 15 minutes up to the [ botanic gardens ] ( http://images.travelpod.com/tripwow/photos/ta-00c4-d6b6-13b7/wellington-botanic-garden-wellington-new-zealand+1152_12935641820-tpfil02aw-4775.jpg ) , which also features [ carter observatory ] ( http://www.kiwispace.org.nz/events/eventimages/resized_a11a59384df0aeb844dfbb9ab385de1e.jpg ) and views like [ this ] ( http://markcujakblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/wellington-views.jpg ) . 
  there 's also [ parliament ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2230/2424168458_2ffab02a3e.jpg ) , but that 's still the cbd . 
  going south from the cbd by about 10-15 minutes , but still in wellington there 's the beaches of [ lyall bay ] ( http://cdn.findabeach.co.nz/photo/640/lyall-bay_173b1149-f9f3-45a9-9327-761cda0f9b5b.jpg ) and [ island bay ] ( http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/travel/pix/gallery/2011/6/6/1307372842056/island-bay-wellington-007.jpg ) , between which is princess bay , where about 10 years ago they intentionally sunk the [ frigate f69 ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/3103153.jpg ) to become a diveable wreck . 
  oh , and before i move on there 's also the [ basin reserve ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/basin_reserve.jpg ) cricket ground in the middle of the city , which is also a big [ roundabout ] ( http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/basinreserve.jpg ) . 
  christchurch is a bit difficult because we had an earthquake 4 years ago which left most of the city looking like [ this ] ( http://blackchristiannews.com/news/christchurch.earthquake.jpg ) , so in the mean time between that and the rebuild we 've got a lot of stuff like [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c0/restart_city_mall_christchurch_2013.jpg ) which is sort of a transitional thing . 
  we 're starting to get some of the cooler new permanent buildings now , like [ this ] ( http://www.christchurchdailyphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/dsc04423.jpg ) one and [ carlton corner ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m04sbvu.jpg ) . 
  christchurch also has [ hagley ] ( https://johndierckx.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/hagley-017-1-of-1.jpg ) [ park ] ( http://www.sumnertoferrymead.co.nz/images/19831harperaveblossom20.jpg ) ( old photo but it still looks like that in spring ) , which is apparently one of the largest inner-city parks in the world ( i was always told 3rd largest , but apparently it 's not ) . 
  we also just got a [ swanky new airport ] ( http://www.warrenandmahoney.com/images/processed/images/slideshow/chch_airport_revised_slides_1-939x532.jpg ) . 
  those are the three major cities and i 'm getting tired of typing , so i 'll just do a quick bit on some of the rest . 
  [ queenstown ] ( http://blogs.iesabroad.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/_dsc9096.jpg ) was the fourth image , and has an almost swiss sort of feel to it . 
  nearby is [ arrowtown ] ( https://bessiejb.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_6905.jpg ) , which still has their main street with the old buildings . 
  there 's also [ dunedin ] ( http://goista.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dunedin-new-zealand-the-edinburgh-of-the-south.jpg ) a couple hours away , which has a heavy scottish influence ( their rugby team are the highlanders ) . 
  on the top of the south island is [ nelson ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4mssgedcvj0/tmj5zhgnr8i/aaaaaaaaa0i/wrvgyqebzxo/s1600/nelson_upper_trafalgar_st.jpg ) , while honourable mentions in the north island include [ napier ] ( http://assets1.guestnewzealand.com/assets/napier-in-hawkes-bay-with-art-deco.jpg ) ( which got rebuilt in art deco style following a huge earthquake and fire in 1931 ) , [ tauranga ] ( http://www.cybersurf.co.nz/images/midcityres.jpg ) and [ rotorua ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/rotorua_museum.jpg ) . 
  i did n't include hamilton because it 's sheer ... beauty ... would put the rest of nz to shame . 
  yep , that 's totally the reason . 
  do n't forget uncle john will come to your bbq if you invite him , and he 'll even bring a plate !, 
  only if he has plausible ( or even implausible ) deniability, 
  i do n't do things half-arsed . 
  unless you 're talking about my lack of auckland coverage, 
  i 'm working the whole day , but at least it 's at a tech store so hopefully i 'll be able to convince someone to put it up on the tellies, 
  looks like you did n't get as much independence from england as you thought back in 1901, 
  keep telling yourself that, 
  that 's what happens when you get all out for 152, 
  possibly [ laura mcgoldrick ] ( https://s.yimg.com/ea/img/-/130131/laura_mcgoldrick_152c2159_mx300_18gjmvv-18gjn02.jpg ) , martin guptill 's wife ? 
  radio hauraki just played `` we are the champions '' with a couple bits where the acc crew were singing along, 
  how much for a year supply ? 
  so , england ? 
  [ pretty much ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/2nem47/can_you_have_a_garden_in_new_zealand/ ), 
  that 's their story and they 're sticking to it, 
  [ they did that once ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w610pbzye7m ), 
  see , we 'd probably steal your stuff too if you had anything worth stealing, 
  he 's already given me a near heart attack, 
  what about having something like / r/worldnews , and have the option to hide all the jokes / memes if people want to ? 
  they 're already all flaired anyway , so it 'd just be a matter of setting the filter up, 
  we were watching the game in a pub , dad had just turned down another drink when we lost two wickets in a row . 
  needless to say he changed his mind fairly quickly at that point, 
  i do n't think you can miscalculate something when the price is in the name, 
  my nerves are still shot from the game yesterday , which was n't helped by another earthquake in the middle of the night, 
  iirc , baseball is even more popular in japan than it is in the states , so i would n't assume there is much room left for cricket, 
  i maintain oracle used that day off to fit an outboard on or something , there 's no way they could have won 9 consecutive races after losing 8 consecutive ones without changing something significant . 
  christchurch , was just a 3.6 or something but enough to wake me up . 
  must be less desensitised to them now, 
   they batted shit and bowled brilliantly apparently . 
  which team are we talking about here ? 
  cheating so-and-so 's ... 
  we should just forget them , and host our own yachting competition, 
  * i have thoroughly investigated and cleared myself of any wrongdoing *, 
  yeah , dunne actually seems to vote based on his beliefs instead of voting blindly in favour of his partner 's proposals . 
  i may not agree with some of his stances , but i can respect him for that, 
   generally perceived, 
  they did n't say it 's true , they just said that 's how it 's perceived, 
  people just keep droning on about them , do n't they ? 
  i hope so , i can never find a fucking carpark this year, 
  is your new job with canta or is the new job different again ? 
  i keep telling myself that i 'm not going to leave all my uni work this year until the last minute . 
  and yet , i 'm here having not done anything at all nearly 1/3 of the way into the term : /, 
  that sounds like hell . 
  at least it 's a job though , i guess, 
  so wait , does that mean you decided to go to uc after all ? 
  you were n't going to , were you ? 
  you mean lance armstrong ? 
  i do n't recall louis using music-enhancing drugs in his career, 
  and blackjack !, 
  new zealand here , can confirm australia is extremely casually racist . 
  only thing more prevalent is the sexism, 
  yeah , i 'll admit there 's a fair bit of it in nz too , especially with the tourist drivers witch hunt going on at the moment, 
  i have a tendency to remember useless information and forget the stuff i actually need to pass exams . 
  ( not that your education is useless or anything , just that i have no use in knowing it ), 
  what 's the club ? 
  i only joined the politics one this year , thinking i should get more involved somehow though . 
  maybe when i move out ? 
  the key stealing thing ? 
  [ here 's a news article ] ( http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/key-slams-tourist-driving-vigilantes-2015030313#axzz3tlrxwqlp ) , there 's been a bunch of tourist driver boogeyman articles recently too, 
  edit : just realised what my earlier post was about . 
  pretty much every other day now there 's a news story `` tourist driver responsible for crash '' or whatever and all these stories about the supposed menace that is tourist drivers . 
  as a result some people have begun stealing the keys of them , which is what that article i linked was about, 
  regardless of what i 'm doing that day , i nearly always wake up at around 6:30 -7:30 ( unless i need to be up earlier for a flight or something ) . 
  latest i 've ever woken up was probably around 8:30 -9 am and that was the day after i got back from japan full of jetlag,
