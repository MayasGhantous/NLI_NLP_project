  tibet 's since been updated too, 
  i just put up a [ steam workshop collection ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=389015641 ) which allows you to subscribe to all the more civs ones at the same time . 
  may consider a full civ pack at some point , but that 's a lot of work and given the largely decentralised nature of more civs ( sukritact publishes the ones he works on , so does viregel and so on ) it 's a lot more difficult to update freqently, 
  broken in the other sense of the word though . 
  when you run out of policies to choose you ca n't end the turn unless you have policy saving on, 
  jfd has a full pack of his civs , i 've outlined the reasons why more civs does n't in a post above, 
  wait , cosmic corner ? 
  i thought that was just a clothing shop ... 
  afaik they 're both based on the same [ collection of poems ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/songs_of_innocence_and_of_experience ) by william blake, 
  shit , i really need to get out more . 
  i had no idea, 
  about that ... 
  [ link for the lazy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seob-xy_1iw ) , starts at about half a minute into the video, 
  if i 've scouted out a good location for petra , i normally get the ge at the same time as currency and use it to instantly rush the wonder in a new city . 
  same for some of the sea-based ones if i 'm inland, 
  i preferred may 's response :, 
  given fitz 's whole imagining simmons for half the season thing , that 's probably not the best name for them, 
  holy crap i just found out you can drag the gravity points . 
  i finally have a [ nice line of particles ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b9bod4q.png ) . 
  i turn away to take the image and look back to see that sort of [ classic atom image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2tofxm4.png ) begin to form ( the image does n't really show it that well ), 
  found the air bed salesman guys !, 
  just checked under my bed , found [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q5whlqu.png ) , so he 's not wrong i guess . 
  but nah , he 's now just madly shouting out any possible excuse he can use . 
  i feel sorry for anyone using it as a drinking game, 
  do you have a new place lined up already ? 
  i think having boxes lying around would probably cause way too many problems when discovered ( which they would probably be , from what i 've heard . ), 
  i 'd either box it up and move it to the new place straight away , or wait until you 're home alone , get a bunch of mates around and do it all at once, 
  surely she 'd go out at least sometimes during the week . 
  church ? 
  shopping ? 
  friends ? 
  honestly , given what you 've said , i do n't see any other way that would ensure you 'd be able to get out clean without a huge argument / possible violence, 
  i think you 'd be fine if the cops were there , but there 's no guarantee of that . 
  either way , would probably be worth a call to them in case your family reports you missing, 
  i did n't , i was just trying to think of reasons why someone who does n't leave the house much would leave, 
  damn , i was going to say it was `` did you kill ... '', 
  do n't forget bola , diameter-2 and that one that used to be in singapore, 
  * we 're not sending troops to iraq , we 're sending training personnel to a sovereign state in the middle east *, 
  but david ramsey posted a picture of him , emily , stephen and colton , who plays roy . 
  laurel 's not in either one , but i suppose they ca n't kill her given she 's got plot armour, 
  i read that as snes and got very confused for a moment, 
  * oh , sure , feel free to take the energy companies ' money and vote against us . 
  pay no attention to the death lasers and fighter jets aimed at capitol hill *, 
  currently just sitting around doing nothing , the kids i was babysitting have gone to bed and the movie i was watching on their netflix has finished, 
  captain america , needed a kid-friendly movie and thought i 'd might as well see what all the fuss is about, 
  except for air new zealand 's one , people seemed to love that, 
  today is saturday the 7th of march . 
  on this day in 321 the roman emperor constantine decrees that sundays are to be a day of rest for the empire . 
  bonus fact , on this day in 2009 the kepler space mission was launched . 
  kepler has since discovered hundreds of planets outside our solar-system , some of whom could potentially contain life !, 
  happy 322nd birthday to pope clement xiii !, 
  today 's word of the day is *** pedagogy *** , a noun meaning * the method and practice of teaching , especially as an academic subject or theoretical concept . 
  today 's facts were brought to you by * wikipedia !, 
   mess up traffic, 
  that 's why i 've posted this , now you know where to avoid !, 
  eh , i just copied this from the green 's fb page . 
  i did n't actually make it, 
  hey , i 'm not an american , we do n't learn about that sort of thing . 
  heh , i got gold last for insulting norway in the bestof thread about the guy that said how much he hated nz, 
  please do n't , the pressure is too much for me . 
  a day i can handle , any more than that and i 'll melt down, 
  hopefully / u/appexxd will reclaim his title, 
  nah , i just fill in when he does n't show up, 
  warning : do not use this as a drinking game, 
  what time was it ? 
  i never saw them march past work ( in the mall ) and there was no-one there when i got off work at ~ 3.15, 
  basically , the tppa is hugely controversial and by some reports is pretty much signing over our sovereignty to the interests of big american corporations . 
  while that may be a bit extreme , these people are protesting the deal and demanding that it does n't go ahead, 
  [ do n't speak too soon ] ( http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/tppa-protests-planned-around-the-country-2015030711#axzz3tfgwnerk ), 
   thousands of people opposed to the trans-pacific partnership agreement are expected to join protests organised around the country . 
  granted it 's a future tense , but i 'd probably still count it, 
  i never said it was , i just assumed that the change would take place when the state became a state, 
  were they actually walking on the road or just down the footpath ? 
  traffic seemed to be flowing normally, 
  officially it 's a trade agreement , but all the negotiations are being done in secret and many reports about the contents seem to indicate it would involve a lot of corporate influence in nz , with some claiming it would sign away our sovereignty . 
  that 's bizarre , i must have just missed them both times . 
  nah , both times i went out to check . 
  moved my car at about one so that i did n't get a ticket , then went back out to check at about quarter to two . 
  both times there was nothing and traffic was free flowing ( well , as free flowing as riccarton road on a saturday can be ), 
  i 've got dinner with some mates , but ill try to stop in for a bit either before or after or something . 
  what time are you expecting to stay until , roughly ? 
  perfect mix of therizinosaur and raptor, 
  this is really annoying to us - none of us have the issue so we ca n't figure out what 's causing it . 
  we * think * we 've narrowed it down to only occurring on amd cards , which would explain why none of us ( who all have nvidia cards ) have the issue , but then i had a report the other day from someone with an nvidia card who had the issue , so i dunno . 
  and to top it all off our modeller is mia , so he ca n't fix it . 
  if anyone is experiencing the issue and could give us some more data sets , please let me know !, 
  i find rum tends to cause me more graphical issues outside of the game, 
  today is sunday the 8th of march . 
  it has now been one year since flight mh370 disappeared flying from kuala lumpur to beijing . 
  on this day in 1963 , the ba'ath political party stages a coup d'\u00e9tat in syria , beginning the al-assad family rule over the country which continues to this day . 
  this coup took place 43 years to the day after syria first gained independence from post-ww1 occupation . 
  today is a big day for sport too !, 
  on this day in 1971 the fight of the century between smokin ' joe frazier and muhammad ali took place , and in 1936 the first oval stock car race took place at daytona beach . 
  today 's cricket matches see the black caps face afghanistan and australia take on sri lanka . 
  *** go the black caps !, 
  your word of the day today is *** fernweh *** , a noun from german literally translating to ` farsickness ' and used as a synonym for wanderlust or to describe the feeling of being homesick for a place you 've never been to before . 
  today 's facts of the day were brought to you by looming assignment deadlines !, 
  shameless plug time !, 
  as well as [ the buccaneers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nf7poyo.png ) , [ the chinook ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xeh3smb.png ) and the [ polynesian split ] ( http://forums.civfanatics.com/showpost.php?p=12389390&amp;postcount=3 ) which have already been mentioned , there 's a couple more thalassocratic civs which more civs has done . 
  there 's also [ phoenicia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/priojuc.png ) ( although they 're slightly more focused on trade ) and [ the chola ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eqmbfdf.png?1 ) , part of the indian civ pack,
