  also , our government is democratically elected , and foreign policy is very clearly their responsibility . 
  did n't john skip the vote though ? 
  surely that makes the decision to go to war purely from the executive ? 
  today is thursday the 12th of march . 
  on this day in 1894 , coca-cola was bottled for the first time , and in 1940 the moscow peace treaty was signed , bringing to an end the winter war . 
  this war , which on paper seemed an easy victory for the soviets , quickly turned very bad for the soviets as a result of finnish tactics . 
  ultimately , while the finns lost only approximately 25,900 men , the russians lost well over 126,000 men over the 104 day war , or approximately 1220 men every day . 
  happy birthday today to rita angus , who would have turned 107 today , and to the country of mauritius , who turns 47 today . 
  today 's word of the day is *** quit *** , which is apparently what / u/appexxd has done . 
   feminism is relevant because only a macho culture would have allowed a bunch of idiots to elide heedless fossil fuel use with mindless racial slurs and scientific illiteracy . 
   i would n't charge around argentina spewing asinine triumphalism about some long-gone war . 
  good , because neither did they, 
  yes , but it negates the argument that it was the government as a whole which decided on it , and not just key, 
  nah , it 's totally just piers morgan that 's hunting around for dirt, 
  next up on the block is one of the two kauri that are on either side of one of the bribe bridges up in northland, 
  bought untouched books no . 
  13 and 14 last weekend , and mum came home yesterday with another one as a gift . 
  currently working my way through xkcd what if ? 
  and tim butcher 's ` the trigger ', 
  pft , everyone knows you 're supposed to dramatically jump away from explosions, 
  maybe someone should organise a planting effort , and put palm trees or something around the edge to help keep it in place ? 
  i actually liked the original post , but i just checked out that subreddit and it 's terrible, 
  maybe with less singing ? 
   again , focusing on / r/nz again . 
  why does no one upvote the daily thread ? 
  this thing gets hundreds of comments but only like 12 upvotes . 
  i 'm sure there are people who do n't even know that this thread exists because it never makes it to their front pages . 
  looks like you got your wish, 
  about three cheat-death situations and one lottery win, 
  we got that for a bit after the earthquake . 
  went outside and all the streetlights in the area were out and the number of stars you could see had about tripled at least . 
  bit eerie alongside the sirens though, 
  hell , just take the whole country !, 
  although it 'd be risky for little ( unless it 's a really safe labour seat ) , if he lost it 'd be hugely damaging for the rest of the term, 
  i thought there was a shortage ? 
  is n't there a weed shortage across the whole south island at the moment or something ? 
  ooh , [ new muse song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqlrqztp6rk ) ( warning , some nsfw language ) . 
  i 'm liking this new sound , and more political songs is always good, 
  i think mum has a couple , but i 'm pretty sure she has them in a greenhouse, 
  fuck , i swear i checked . 
  god , this man-flu must be worse than i thought, 
  that works - so i take tomorrow ? 
  i dunno , there was a news story on stuff last month or something, 
  yeah , i miss political u2 ... 
  some of atyclb is political too , walk on is about aung san suu kyi ( and took on a different tone in america post-9 / 11 ) and peace on earth is about the omagh bombing . 
  a fair few of the other songs are about religion ( elevation , in a little while , wild honey , grace ) , although most of them have double meanings ( in a little while was originally about a hangover , the other three are all fairly sensual ) . 
  the rest of it is fairly personal though ( kite is about letting go of someone you care about , stuck in a moment you ca n't get out of was about a good friend of bono 's committing suicide iirc . 
  nah , winnie 's going to be in parliament well into his 90 's at least, 
  and nicked, 
  anyone know the laws around working for a family business ? 
  i have a friend that is pretty much being forced to work 7 days a week in her family 's fish and chip shop with no pay . 
  pretty sure it 's illegal , but i was n't sure whether the rules were different when you 're working for family, 
   he was friendly bordering on invasive and the breakfast was short of a couple of key items that he had promised us the night before . 
  key , meaning no bacon and no egg in our bacon and eggs breakfast !, 
  are they sure they ordered the bacon and eggs ? 
  nah , we just wanted to give you guys some false hope, 
  i think the main issues that arise with that sort of thing are where people draw the prophet muhammad . 
  assuming it begins after his death , i 'm pretty sure there would n't be an issue, 
  depends on how much you pay , i guess . 
  you could have accommodation like the top image , you 'd just be paying a shitload per night to stay there, 
  today is saturday the 14th of march . 
  on this day in 1951 united nations forces successfully recaptured the city of seoul from north korean forces . 
  in the incorrect american date system , today 's date also spells out the first five digits of pi , giving it the name pi day . 
  at 9:26:54 , this increases to the first 10 digits , a feat which will not occur for the next 100 years . 
  today 's word of the day is *** panzerkampfwagen *** , which is german for ` tank ' . 
  today 's facts were brought to you by * compromise !, 
  whoops , fixed . 
  thanks !, 
  google tells me it 's america , so you 're pretty much right, 
  okay , this flair must have some sort of special luck thing . 
  first game after getting the flair , and i manage to successfully make a snipe through the one tile gap in between the spikes in the middle of danger zone 3 while at an odd angle and without stopping to plan . 
  never done it before , probably never going to be able to do it again, 
  would n't it only need the third digit to be anything less than a 6 , though ? 
  0,1,2 and 3 should all work just as well as a 4 or 5 in that situation, 
  fuck , these are pretty much the only things i can have proper conversations about, 
  they should give everyone a turtle flair to make up for that . 
  congrats - i 've been trying to do the same with a girl i used to know that is probably the closest thing i 've got to an ex , but every time we see each other she avoids me like the plague, 
  or they could be nice and give it to everyone who plays a game today ... 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ really ^ ^ ^ want ^ ^ ^ free ^ ^ ^ flairs, 
  oh shit , row not row . 
  i thought it was like a heart attack while out rowing or something , but instead it was a fight or whatever, 
  `` in we trust '' is a terrible slogan, 
  yeah , you could say that . 
  way too much of a complicated and messy situation to explain the whole thing ( although i 'm pretty sure i 've talked about it on here before , if you want to stalk my post history for it , ) but the tl ; dr of the whole thing was pretty much that she had a thing for me and thought i felt the same way when i did n't . 
  ended up wrecking my chances with someone i actually did like too , which kind of sucks . 
  the whole thing ended up with her ambushing me and kissing me , before cutting off all communication , save for a three page letter which she gave to a friend of mine to give to me ... 
  i dunno , maybe there could be something like two different greens ? 
  pro-tip : most aussie pop geniuses are actually kiwi pop geniuses, 
  from what i can gather , it depends on where the storm 's going . 
  if it hits nz full on , then yes , be very worried . 
  it 's one of the worst storms ever to hit this part of the pacific , extremely low pressure and it 's huge ( when it was still over vanuatu , tuvalu was getting storm surges from it ) . 
  it 's looking like the jetstream might push it to the east and scrape past nz , but it 's probably far better to get prepared just in case then be caught out by it, 
  nah , the guy actually says his name after everything he says, 
  how about the mods put in a / r/worldnews style filter , that allows ai-only posts ( along with joke posts , start position posts , modded civs etc ) to be hidden with the click of a button ? 
  greek colonisation tends to be a bit exaggerated , partially due to the way in which it 's portrayed in maps . 
  take [ this ] ( http://www.utexas.edu/courses/greeksahoy!/greek_colonies_550.jpg ) image , for example . 
  while it 's true that greeks colonised those areas , it was n't the sort of colonisation which later european empires carried out , where whole regions belonged to them . 
  in reality , it would have looked a bit more like it does in [ this ] ( http://www.ancient.eu/uploads/images/108.jpg?v=1391811284 ) image ( warning , 2800x1600 ) , where the colonies were primarily localised city-states ( much like greece proper at the time ) . 
  robert bonner has a passage on this in a journal article he wrote on the topic :, 
   it is not easy to determine how much territory a greek colony controlled beyond the wall that guarded the promontory upon which it was usually built .
