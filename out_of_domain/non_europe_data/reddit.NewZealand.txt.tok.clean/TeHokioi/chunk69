  how new counts as new ? 
  damn .

  what a dick , booking the place like that, 
  that 's exactly what he 's like in the blacklist too , perfect role . 
  i had to do a double take though , did n't realise it was going to be him for the voice, 
  what if fury is the director of the other shield , and he 's using coulson 's team as a strikeforce subdivision thing to focus specifically on hydra ? 
  got ta save * something * for the movie,

  swap the stars around in the last frame and it 'll come true fine, 
  it would require us scoring more than 200 though ... 
  hey , come on now . 
  it got to 18 the other day, 
  what do you mean ? 
  the chch one ? 
  go to the meetup and watch the cricket there , i 'm sure they 'll have the game on,

  this just keeps getting better and better, 
  yeah , dad 's streaming it through sky in the other room and i do n't want to screw up his stream . 
  but , but , think of the karma !, 
  plus he needs motivation in the next couple games if we make it that far, 
  3 overs left , he 'd need to hit a four off every single ball at least, 
   48.2 taylor to ronchi , ** four **,

  on this day in 1997 comet hale-bopp made its closest approach to earth . 
  today 's fact was brought to you by our new prime minister / god king , martin guptill, 
  not yet , but today was my day anyway . 
  if he 's still not here for his shift tomorrow then something 's up, 
  how 'd the chch meetup go last night ? 
  sorry i could n't make it , had dinner with friends, 
  hypothetically , let 's say you 're interested in someone , but you 're not their type . 
  would you try anyway , or try to give up and move on ? 
  she 's one of my best friends , you could argue i 've been playing the long game for five years, 
  you know i ca n't grab your ghost chips, 
  yeah , pretty much, 
  nah , it has n't come up like that yet . 
  i 'm meaning more knowing what her type is ( being good friends and all ) and that i 'm not part of it, 
  do n't think so , although there is someone on here who i know ( almost certain they know my username too ), 
   secondly , ca n't you tell if she 's kind of interested in you ? 
  i have a long history of being absolutely shit at picking up on hints . 
  they 're from a cafe in paeroa iirc, 
  * starring / u/leapingdummkopf as bruce `` danger '' stallion , the farmhand with an attitude out for revenge , universal pictures presents * *** horseplay . 
  *** * galloping into theatres this fall !, 
  i 'm guessing it did n't end well ? 
  so what 's with the whole `` i really should n't '' bit ? 
  has he got a girlfriend or something ? 
  ah , fair enough . 
  i probably would n't go back , but i suppose it depends on the circumstances and whether they 've changed what led to the split or whatever . 
  i dunno , i 'm probably not the best person to give advice on this,
