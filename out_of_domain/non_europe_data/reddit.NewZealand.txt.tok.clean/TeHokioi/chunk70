  * stephen joyce says * `` pretty legal '' *, 
  *** safety tip : *** * prior to playing , dial 111 and alert paramedics that you are attempting the game . 
  this way , they will be at your door by the time you pass out !, 
  okay , how long do i wait to see if / u/appexxd shows up before posting the on this day thing ? 
  edit : screw it , he 's now mia . 
  on this day in 1848 the * john wickliffe * arrived in new zealand carrying scottish immigrants . 
  they settled in what is now dunedin , founding the province of otago at the time . 
  on this day in spaceflight history , 1965 saw the launch of gemini 3 , the first two-man space flight for the united states . 
  additionally , in 2001 the former soviet and then russian space station * mir * was deorbited and largely burnt up in the atmosphere , although some parts hit the pacific ocean near fiji . 
  today 's facts were brought to you by unexplained absences, 
  not while i 'm trying to write something due at 5pm that i started this morning, 
  yep , a thing on the role of etiquette in the court of the mughal empire and something about its masculinity . 
  at least it 's only 500 words , but even so, 
  normally essays are a couple thousand words , this is just like an intro thing, 
  sweet , nz vs. india final then ? 
  nz 's playing way better than they were a couple years ago though, 
  yeah , most people in nz wrote them off as a laughing stock, 
  i 'd send the bbc the bill . 
  probably would n't accomplish anything , but makes a point , i guess, 
  what if you sign up for an nz account and then ` visit ' the states ? 
  do you get nz content still or us content ? 
  i 'd assume they 'd be fairly similar, 
  wait , the flag was deemed unconstitutional or the federation ? 
  how can a flag be unconstitutional ? 
  well there goes that plan . 
  always next time , hopefully, 
  well , they * did * go to the same school ... 
  tuesday 's are my day off :d, 
  i always wonder if people have me tagged as anything . 
  i do n't really use it that much , although i 've labelled a guy in / r/askscience who i reckon is randall munroe, 
  today is tuesday the 24th of march . 
  on this day in 1869 the conflict which came to be called titokowaru 's war ended with the surrender of the last ng\u0101ti ruanui forces to the new zealand government . 
  taking place primarily in taranaki , this conflict coincided with te kooti 's raids on the east coast and was a consequence of the land confiscations around the region . 
  in other historical news , this day in 1707 saw the passage of the acts of union 1707 , officially joining the kingdoms of scotland and england into the kingdom of great britain . 
  in 1944 , the prison break which formed the basis for the movie * the great escape * began as 76 allied pows began to break out from the german stalag luft iii pow camp . 
  this day also saw the drafting of elvis presley into the us army in 1958 , the discovery of comet shoemaker-levy 9 in 1993 , and bhutan 's first ever general election in 2008 . 
  in cricket news , the black caps face off against south africa in the first semi-final of the cricket world cup today at eden park . 
  if we win , we 'll face off against either australia or india in the final . 
  however , neither new zealand nor south africa have ever progressed beyond the semi-finals in the cricket world cup . 
  i love how a documentary about the destruction of an entire city and deaths of thousands of people is sitting between bob the builder specials, 
  is this everything ? 
  i might be blind but i could n't see house of cards in there ( the netflix one , not the british one , which is there ), 
  oh wow , it 's a shame they ca n't show their own show . 
  any idea how long rights last for ? 
  yeah , just have to put up with a week of essay writing and study then i can have three weeks of binge watching, 
  jeez , [ another new muse single ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atcjwhmdzpg ) already ( warning , nsfw video ) . 
  sounds fairly different to the last one too , more 80 's mixed with modern stuff . ^ *, 
  ^ * disclaimer : ^ i ^ really ^ do n't ^ know ^ how ^ to ^ describe ^ musical ^ styles ^ / ^ genres . 
  i was about to dedicate today 's on this day post as a memorial to you , but decided to wait for tomorrow if you did n't post again . 
  glad to hear you 're not dead !, 
  i tend to pronounce it as na - but with a little bit of a g - ( like in tiger ) thrown in , which is probably completely wrong, 
  short skirt , long jacket - chuck, 
  it 's funny , this is probably the first time there 's been a buzz in the air about a cricket game in nz for a long time . 
  like , not just amongst cricket fans but in general, 
  what 's this ? 
  an aussie supporting nz ? 
  i do n't believe it ... 
  same reason american football players need all the padding . 
  they 're wusses, 
  would n't it make more sense for them to leave once the game has started though ? 
  i remember going to a game years ago and the crowd started chanting * `` brett lee 's a wanker '' * , does that count ? 
  nz keeping up the strong tradition of losing coin tosses at eden park, 
  no richardson either : /, 
  there 's an / r/cricket discussion thread [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/cricket/comments/30210e/match_thread_1st_semifinal_new_zealand_v_south/?sort=new ) too , which should have a fair bit of activity ( already had 500 comments ), 
  if you look carefully , their caps are black . 
  i think it was conquest of paradise, 
  *** keys to success : ***, 
  * both south africa and new zealand win 100 % of the games where they score more runs than their opponent, 
  that 'll be our guptill moment for sure, 
  screw quiet , i 'm sure they 'd understand once they realise amla 's gone, 
  i 'll admit that i chuckled a bit when the commentators said `` mccullum is all over de kock '', 
  i 'll admit i did n't expect 31-2 in the slightest, 
  i 'd settle for getting sa out for 100, 
  come on matty , make an impression, 
  probably better that he was n't , means he 's actually had game time, 
  he only gave 6 runs from 4 overs iirc, 
  sure thing, 
  eh , if we had one in central otago or the mackenzie country it would probably be okay . 
  problem is no-one lives there and it 's miles from everywhere, 
  kind of off topic , but is that how it 's spelt in australia ? 
  i 've always thought it was jail ... 
  really ? 
  last time i went there i had thunderstorms every night . 
  granted that was in october though , not march, 
  cricket gods may have abandoned us , but at least the weather gods are still on our side, 
  [ bottoms up , people !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/2zvjft/national_candidate_struggles_in_debate/cpmsddl ), 
  america 's cup time - come back after a break and completely reverse momentum, 
  might be worth it then , could use some more rain there to fill up the hydro lakes, 
  i think more than that , is n't the prize down to like $ 71k now ? 
  oh god , 298 seems a big ask , especially over 43 overs . 
  let 's just hope they can come out all guns blazing, 
  10 minutes, 
  it 's amazing how quickly it 's changed - going from boundaries nearly every ball to dots nearly every ball, 
  might need to bring / u/martinsucktill back, 
  just noticed the op has died , or at least it has at my end . 
  not refreshing, 
  no celebration , just relief, 
  elliott you fucking legend, 
  awesome , gives me time to get to the emergency room and be treated for heart failure,
