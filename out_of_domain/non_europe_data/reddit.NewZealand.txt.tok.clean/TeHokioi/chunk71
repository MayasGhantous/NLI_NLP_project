  and if you do , he better damn well be called grant elliott, 
  so this is what having a day off feels like, 
  kind of a whinge but probably more of a fu - ended up leaving essays to the last minute , so now i 'm freaking out because i 've got a week to write 2200 words on bolshevik military strategy in the russian civil war and 2000 words on masculine values and military culture of the mughal empire , as well as studying for a midterm test of the postwar economic evolution of europe, 
  i dunno , the lunar teams are getting pretty good . 
  although the stupid icc rulings around different levels of gravity will probably get in the way of them having any chance, 
  how long are you wanting to spend on the drive ? 
  the most direct ( and usual tourist route ) is down through the middle ( like [ this ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/vddmy ) ) . 
  on this route , you have places like [ geraldine ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/geraldine_main_street_003.jpg ) , [ tekapo ] ( http://www.tekapotourism.co.nz/images/mainstreet_top.jpg ) and [ omarama ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/omarama_ram_%26_sign.jpg ) , all of which have decent cafes and souvenir stores where you can get decent merino clothing ( although sometimes it 's fairly expensive ) . 
  as far as sights go , there 's the [ clay cliffs ] ( https://alphathread.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/mini-bryce-1.jpg ) in omarama , although these are probably a half hour drive on a dirt road that rental car companies probably wo n't be too pleased with . 
  in tekapo there 's the [ church of the good shepherd ] ( http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/233/6/d/church_of_the_good_shepherd_by_elgarboart-d47bofy.jpg ) on the side of the lake just outside the township proper , and [ mount john observatory ] ( http://www.tekapo.co.nz/getattachment/87119c8f-0038-452d-a50f-7ccff146bae0/the-godley-hotel/explore-hotel/lake-tekapo/twizel-today.aspx?height=600 ) , which has a cafe if you just want to stop off on the way through and take a look around . 
  another option if you had the time / were interested would be to stay a night in tekapo , which has one of the best [ night skies ] ( http://www.terrastro.com/wp-content/gallery/lake-tekapo/01-galactic-plane.jpg ) in the country ( without having to go miles into the wop-wops to get there . ), 
  the observatory does night time tours as well if you want to go up there and get a proper view , but i 'd imagine you 'd have better things to do at night time anyway . 
  there 's another option if you have the time , which would be to go down the west coast , like [ this ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/50z4g ) and spend the night in one of the glacier townships , but i 've run out of time to explain that for now . 
  if you want i can give a bit more detail on it when i get back ? 
  * some folks are born , bat and ball in hand *, 
  * lord do n't they know to score *, 
  * and when you ask them ` how much should we get ' ? 
  * they only answer more , more , more , more !, 
  guppy would have had a very good night list night, 
  oh wow , where are you going within turkey ? 
  i 've wanted to go to istanbul for years , would n't mind checking out some of the rest of it too but not sure where to go, 
  `` oh sweet , i 'll come with !, 
  i 've been meaning to hit up the gym anyway '', 
  huh , that 's a good idea . 
  i 'm always most productive on other stuff when procrastinating . 
  thanks !, 
  well , it 's been a good run boys . 
  pretty sure netflix spends more per episode on house of cards than the bbc does on top gear , and netflix 's distribution is probably better than hbo 's, 
  ( at least i can get netflix in nz now , unlike hbo ), 
  i would n't mind if we had a sort of expanded specials road trip kind of show . 
  have the specials and do proper trips - like , cape to cairo or the pan-american highway or whatever - and have the specials like we do now stretch over three or four episodes instead . 
  `` does n't matter , you 're giving me a lift right ? 
  and we 'll still show up at work at the same time '', 
  my main concern was people who would n't binge-watch it would be put off because of how long it was . 
  if you split it up it can still be watched as a huge block , but also can be split up and watched separately if you were so inclined . 
  plus if you just had the car reviews on their own it would n't have the same appeal as a show with different segments and audience interaction and banter between, 
  `` oh , okay then . 
  ^ ^ asshole . '', 
  i do n't think hammond would have an issue with that, 
  if this is true and they really have n't made an announcement yet , what i imagine has happened is two statements were prepared - one for if he was kept and one for if he was sacked - and the latter one got leaked to the telegraph . 
  there was way too much specific information in it to be just speculative or a poor source, 
  i wonder what the point of this is , if it 's not going to be able to be reported in the media ? 
  i always thought `` don '' was fitting , given how some of his mps have behaved fairly mob-esque, 
  what the hell , who acts like that ? 
  i 'm not going to outright say you should end it with him because i do n't know enough to make a proper call on it , but it definitely sounds like you need to take a step back and take a look at your relationship . 
  i did n't think about diagrams , pretty sure we 're not allowed to use them though . 
  might look into it though , thanks !, 
  shit , that 's a huge help . 
  400 words is way less daunting than 2000 . 
  thank you so much, 
  yeah , might be a bit difficult given i 'm still living at home in a house where until last year i thought bringing up the topic of me drinking would result in a one-way trip to boarding school . 
  executive email carpet bomb ? 
  the only way to watch stuff like that is on a channel called soho , which comes as part of a premium sky tv package which costs upwards of $ 100 a month once you factor in the decoder , hd access ticket and everything . 
  and even then there 's a fairly substantial delay between us and nz air dates . 
  and that does n't even have stuff like last week tonight or anything . 
  do n't have any experience on the first point ( that sucks though , you should probably get out of there asap ) , but as far as the second point goes it 's probably just different perspectives . 
  like , take my high school drama . 
  my mates thought this girl liked me , and her mates thought i liked her . 
  now , turns out she did like me and i did n't like her ( by a massive stroke of south africa level bad luck the girl i did like was one of her best friends , but that 's a story for another time ) but because she 'd got it in her head that i * did * like her , that 's how she interpreted my actions . 
  suddenly my rejection was me playing hard to get , and me getting help from my friends was my friends keeping us apart , or something . 
  and of course , i 'm pretty sure it was the same in reverse too , and my perspective on the whole thing affected how i interpreted events , but because every conversation we had after it flared up was either a shouting match or her kissing me i have no idea . 
  my advice would be to just move on from it - as you said , it 's just high school drama , and i 'm sure the other parties have moved on from it . 
  if you really want to sort it out i guess you could always try contacting them and figuring out what 's up , but depending on what actually happened that may not be the best idea . 
  i dunno , i 'm waiting until the end of the term to get it . 
  there 's a list of programming on / r/newzealand though, 
  i 'm sure she would of gotten it right eventually , good on you for pointing it out though . 
  i probably would n't of said anything, 
  okay , had a quick look through some of the games i had to check out prices :, 
  game | $ usd | $ nzd, 
  sid meier 's civilization v | 29.99 | 69.99, 
  total war : attila | 49.99 | 59.99, 
  total war : attila : viking dlc | 8.99 | 9.99, 
  company of heroes 2 | 19.99 | 49.99, 
  mark of the ninja | 14.99 | 14.99, 
  so it seems it just depends on the company . 
  total war seems to be converted normally , civ v and coh both price gouge , and mark of the ninja is just the same for some reason . 
  note that i only checked five games out of my library ( well , four and a dlc ) but it 's enough to show the variation . 
  yeah , that 's true . 
  total war was n't that bad though , at least at the start . 
  rome 2 was $ 50 ( same as in the states ) up until about a month before release , when it jumped to $ 70,

  dacia sandero appreciation hour, 
  i was expecting `` christoper james ` so called ' evans '', 
  are you really over it though , if you 're still cutting contact and telling him you never want to see him again / threatening him with never having kids ? 
   i ai n't thinking about having kids right now , i 'm 18 !!, 
  i was meaning him , with the whole kicking him in the nuts bit ... 
  but nah , i do n't really know enough about your situation to comment properly , although from the sound of it it does n't really seem like just ignoring it and hoping it goes away is working all that well . 
  given it 's been a couple years it 's possible it 'd be a bit more level headed , although that would depend on what sort of things you said , whether he knows about them and whether there 's any feelings there still ( i 'm assuming that 's what this is about since it 's pretty much what all high school drama is about ), 
  i think the main thing around that is how if there was n't the controversy around other comments he would have likely just gotten a warning for this , but because people got all uppity about his other comments they had to put him on a final warning , which is likely what lead to this, 
  today is thursday the 26th of march . 
  on this day in 1945 the battle of iwo jima ended with a united states victory , bangladesh declared independence from pakistan in 1971 , and the bbc made a huge mistake in 2015 . 
  today 's facts were brought to you by *** powerrrrrrr ***, 
  it can still hang around and people can discuss the show like always - / r/thewestwing is still around 8 years after the show finished . 
  it 's admittedly a lot less active , but yeah . 
  could always do an official rewatch of the series , maybe the specials . 
  shit , you know things are getting bad when the stig speaks out, 
  james may said the three of them are a unit , so there 's a good chance they 'll lose all three hosts , which will single handedly sign top gear 's death sentence . 
  with any luck they 'll be picked up to do a `` next gear '' on netflix or something , with their tame racing driver * the stug *, 
  * we 've also decided to try a new format , where the star in a reasonably-priced car acts as a guest host for the episode *,
