  i 'm sure you 'd have people thinking something with that title was a drama about in-fighting within the republican party, 
  regardless of this ( which i think is meant as a joke more than anything , ) it should be changed to the bbc logo now anyway, 
  i think the show might have been able to survive without clarkson , but if all three of them call it a day then the show is as good as dead . 
  we saw what happened when you get 3 different hosts with the us and au versions, 
  nah , we should play the final at gallipoli . 
  why did the police show up at your door ? 
  [ obligatory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfr9iy5y94s ), 
  i 'd love it if someone says this if ollie takes over as ra 's . 
  * `` from now on , we do n't kill . 
  `` but you 're the league of assassins ? '', 
  * not anymore . 
  `` then what are you ? '', 
  * `` a justice league ? 
  do n't worry about it , i 'm just glad some of mine are included :d, 
  nah , they forgot to take the lens cap off, 
  well , not really made entirely . 
  i put oman and the ayyubids together and did the base code for it - a bunch of other people worked on art and advanced code for them , which is why jfd lists them as a collab between him and more civs, 
  sure , i 'll help where i can !, 
  gives me a way to repay the comics , too !, 
  maybe even send a strongly worded letter, 
  can someone eli5 the legality around trade deals etc ? 
  would n't it still need to be passed through our legislature , where it could be stopped ? 
  does it still count as the same car if they hook rocket boosters up to it and get a lap time of 50 seconds ? 
  so presumably at that point the details would become known , and then it could be voted down if no-one other than act / national support it ? 
  what happens then , does it have no impact on us at all ? 
  yeah , although here we tend to laugh at the ones trying to get elected , if only because we end up with pictures like [ this ] ( http://www.nbr.co.nz/sites/default/files/images/colin-craig-grass.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1405742125/376/10287376.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://d3hh2k5k8eginv.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mt0314_colincraig_dsc1717.jpg ) . 
  i 'm still not entirely convinced his campaign was n't satire, 
  i feel pretty sorry for somaliland . 
  stable , democratic , and for the most part peaceful , yet for some reason nobody has acknowledged their declaration of independence and so they 're forced to stay within the mess that is somalia, 
  could you explain a bit please ? 
  is there some way it would be easier ? 
  and this is why the veto system is fucked up, 
  works much better if you sync it with [ stayin ' alive ] ( https://gifsound.com/?gif=i.imgur.com/i8tosxs.gif&amp;v=zfovhmfdquk ), 
  surely there 's a difference between a secessionist movement in a successful and stable country and one in a failed state like somalia though ? 
  what if somalia itself recognised somaliland as an independent state ? 
  it 'd get international recognition at that point , right ? 
  do we get to keep our current opinions and everything , just in their body ? 
  just realised i forgot to do the on this day post . 
  sorry for failing you all !, 
  on this day in 193 members of the roman praetorian guard assassinated the emperor , and then proceeded to auction off the position . 
  the winner of this auction did n't get their money 's worth , however , and ended up losing in a four year civil war , after which they were sentenced to death for treason . 
  also on this day was the raid on saint-nazaire , in which british special forces successfully destroyed a key nazi seaport on the atlantic coast of occupied france . 
  a documentary by jeremy clarkson on the raid ( which can be found [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxuskm5ux0s ) referred to it as `` the greatest raid of all '' ( as it is also known within military circles ) , and it successfully prevented german battleships such as the bismarck from having a port capable of servicing them on the atlantic seaboard , allowing them to be eventually destroyed , eliminating a significant threat to allied shipping operations . 
  conservative party ( that guy ) was probably more social , act ( a different party that is actually in parliament - sort of ) is probably more fiscal . 
  75 % and a 3000 vote lead for winnie :d, 
  i would 've , but every time i walk into a bookshop i injure my bank account , and i want a car, 
  you mean in the maori seat / in 2017 ? 
  or are you meaning past tense ? 
  oh god , john campbell then . 
  if it was just their position i 'd go with key , since i 'd be able to actually change the course of the country as pm, 
  pull out of the tppa , scrap the rma changes ( maybe even toughen it ) , put in place more tax brackets , raise minimum wage ( and implement other worker securities ) and put in place more environmental protections . 
  longer term i 'd probably look to renationalise a fair bit of the power grid and make that cheaper , as well as looking at buffing up rail as an alternative to road traffic ( for goods initially , then high-speed passenger networks . ), 
  i 'd probably try to reform the military into a higher-quality force ( vietnam era helicopters does n't really look good ) and make them more of a rapid response peacekeeping / disaster relief sort of thing . 
  i 'd also launch an investigation into the spying that 's gone on , and look at disbanding the sis and gcsb , to be replaced by a newer one with tougher restrictions if necessary . 
  and lastly , as a pet peeve of mine , i 'd try an introduce some sort of packaging law that means something needs to be 3/4 full of a product at least . 
  those goddamn chip packets with barely anything in them are going to be the first thing to go, 
  i 'm suddenly getting impossible creatures flashbacks . 
  cerbearus , the three headed bear-eagle guardian of the stars, 
  decided by a game of space ice hockey ? 
  crowded house are kiwis, 
  yep , until the 70 's iirc, 
   until recently , i never thought i 've seen a more punchable face than mitt romney . 
  follow new zealand politics and you 'll get a few . 
  case in point , [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed2jkokgrja ) ( on the right ), 
  i think i 'd prefer a landslide if nz wins , and a close game if we lose, 
  i know it 's nigh-on impossible , but i hope we absolutely demolish them, 
  god , our current government is full of them . 
  our pm called edward snowden et al anti-american plonkers , glenn greenwald a goon of kim dotcom and a journalist which called him out on dirty politics a `` screaming left-wing conspiracy theorist '' . 
  pleased they 've just given up completely on trying to sequence it, 
  was going to wear [ this shirt ] ( https://sjponeill.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/anyone-playing-australia.jpg ) today , but i ca n't find it :(, 
  yep , that 's pretty much the jist of the whole acc, 
  every now and then he goes out for four overs and smashes a 50, 
  you just keep telling yourself that ... 
  worst case scenario , i 'm sure 90 % of the bars in the country will have it on, 
  how much would it cost to get a decent ( read : not going to break down every 10 minutes ) first car ? 
  mum seems to reckon at least 5k , but that seems a bit steep, 
  i 'd call 000 now , just to be safe, 
  alcohol seems like a fitting end for them, 
  hey , we let you lot beat us at yachting . 
  ^ even ^ though ^ you ^ cheated, 
  loser gets russell crowe ? 
  since the day the country was founded, 
  yeah , i 'm not expecting a new car at that price at all, 
  shit, 
  i assume you 're talking about the toss, 
  i really ca n't handle another last ball six, 
  if he has n't , he has now, 
   take your time, 
  choose one, 
  1800 off 300, 
  steve smith is gon na run everyone on his team out, 
  oh dear god, 
  nice , what albums ? 
  * the fact of the matter is i 'm a self-entitled prick who wants to line his pockets with oil company money and i do n't give a shit what you think or what damage it 'll do *, 
  nz average opening partnership before today was 56.1 : /, 
  just needs an older uniform and we 'd be in the 80 's, 
  oh man , zooropa is awesome . 
  * the wanderer * is one of my favourite u2 tracks, 
  i 'm going to need a very strong drink right about now, 
  missed the ball completely and it hit the wickets,
