  we went to [ a fair few places ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/ua6gy ) , i absolutely loved it . 
  fantastic memories from the whole trip , tokyo and nagasaki were my favourites and i did n't really care for hiroshima or osaka all that much . 
  finding out that i was allergic to shellfish was n't that fun either, 
  just like he intended to resign if they were spying , and intended to reach surplus ? 
  if you figure out a way to liquidate the ira you should probably tell the brits , they 've been trying to do that for decades, 
  probably because we ended up staying in a skody part of town in a run down hotel , and most of what we did while we were there was just shopping . 
  did get to see a whale shark there though , which was cool, 
  this is a pretty freaky thought . 
  like , how vast earth is but then how thin the thing that keeps us alive is, 
  go to / r/flashtv and upvote some stuff , there 's little bits of text that appear when you hit the upvote button, 
  why do all good kiwi bands have to break up quickly ? 
  just found out that king cannons broke up after one album , a day after i find out that midnight youth broke up : /,

  morning everyone !, 
  today is thursday the 16th of april . 
  today in 1847 saw the opening of the whanganui campaign in the new zealand land wars , when an english sailor accidentally shot a minor maori chief . 
  this shooting kick-started a tit-for-tat response , with a small party of maori responding by attacking a settler . 
  four of those involved in the attack were caught and hanged , which led to the formation of a taua consisting of five or six hundred heavily armed men , who pillaged their way down the whanganui river as they advanced towards the main town . 
  the troop numbers of the maori and british forces were roughly even , and the resulting battle was a stalemate despite superior british weaponry . 
  although the last major engagement was on 23 july , it was not until february of the year after that peace was negotiated . 
  absolutely , i forgot about that . 
  how do i even edit the portal countdown at the moment ? 
  how hard is it to play ? 
  why would i have seen that ? 
  would n't that depend on your definition ? 
  why not webster ? 
  is n't that a gameshow or something ? 
  whose line is it anyway ? 
  ooh , what sort of game ? 
  i much prefer driving to tours if you can drive in the conditions . 
  what i would suggest would be staying a night in te anau , then leaving in the morning to get on the road to milford . 
  since nearly all of the tour buses leave from queenstown , they do n't hit te anau until ~ 9 , so you 've got enough time to get ahead of them , stop for photos and check out the stuff along the way without being swamped with tourists . 
  was n't there someone here who worked in a bookshop ? 
  trying to find a book that i remember seeing a while back , but ca n't remember the name of and could n't see last time i checked . 
  hoping if i give a description they 'll recognise it on the off chance they 've seen it . 
  edit : suppose i should have included a description of the book in case someone knows it . 
  it was a sort of travel book , someone writing about a trip they took . 
  i think it was the balkans . 
  but it was either a manuscript from pre-ww1 that was finally published or it was someone finishing a journey that someone else was doing before ww1 got in the way . 
  i think it was the third book about the trip , but i do n't know if it was a series or not . 
  the cover was blueish-white iirc , with a drawing of a town on it, 
  good point , edited the post with a description, 
  why would i agree to someone without knowing what it is ? 
  not particularly , should i ? 
  i work in retail too , did n't really want to be that guy who comes in asking for `` the book about the thing written by that person who wrote that other book . '', 
  thought i 'd ask here first , see if anyone knew it, 
  do n't think so , it was there probably at least six months to a year ago ( saw it a couple times ) ,, 
  unlike most of the people in this subreddit i actually like giving travel advice . 
  want to make sure people get the best out of new zealand and all that . 
  so let 's begin . 
  firstly , what are you wanting to do ? 
  you mention the south island because you want to check out our scenery , but the north island has [ a ] ( http://www.allcountries.org/photos/new_zealand/desert_road_new_zealand_photo_david_wall.jpg ) [ fair ] ( http://cdnstatic-2.mydestination.com/library/images/274_1680_948.jpg ) [ bit ] ( http://www.seakayaktours.co.nz/home/data1/images/19.jpg ) [ too ] ( http://cdn.3news.co.nz/3news/am/2012/3/30/248640/pink-and-white-terraces---a.jpg ) ( actually , ignore that last one . 
  it got destroyed by a volcano back in 1886 . ), 
  so i 've got a couple options on suggested routes here , depending on whether you 're still set on south island only or whether you 're open to the north as well . 
  before we get started , it 's worth keeping in mind the weather . 
  july is the middle of winter here , so there 's a real possibility that the alpine passes , the milford road and the desert road could be closed ( at least partially ) due to snowfall . 
  if you are driving , check what your rental car policy is on it and see whether they come with chains . 
  it may be that the rental car does n't want people driving in snow at all , and even if they 're okay with it you should n't drive in it without prior experience . 
  the passes are in places narrow , with [ steep drops ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/mlnpm ) and a steep grade on the road . 
  screwing up a bit on these roads in the wrong conditions can be fatal , and that 'd screw your holiday up a bit . 
  on that cherry note , let 's get into it . 
  ** option 1 : 2 weeks , both islands **, 
  [ map ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/6owpq ), 
  this one would require picking up the car in christchurch and dropping it off in auckland , which may not work for some companies . 
  you 'd head over [ arthur 's pass ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/arthur%27s_pass.jpg ) , where you can easily get some close up shots of the [ kea ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/kea_arthurs_pass.jpg ) , a mountain parrot native to nz . 
  from here , you 'd head down the [ west coast ] ( http://accessiblenz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/windy-west-coast-road-low-res.jpg ) to the glaciers , and spend a night there . 
  i 've put [ franz ] ( http://www.westcoast.co.nz/content/images/2291/640x480normal/l35_-_franz_josef.jpg ) on the map because imo it 's the [ nicer town ] ( http://www.rainyhills.com/gallery/franzjosef_files/franzjosef03.jpg ) , but [ fox ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/fox_glacier_nz_2.jpg ) might be cheaper since it 's slightly less touristy , plus it has [ lake matheson ] ( http://www.lakematheson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/slide5.jpg ) nearby , which you can get some great photos at if you head out there on a decent day . 
  it 's fairly calm most of the time anyway . 
  there 's also [ okarito lagoon ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s22901m.jpg ) nearby too , which is n't that well known but is home to dozens of bird species , including the kotuku , which is in the picture and also on the nz $ 2 coin . 
  from here , you go further south and through the [ gates of haast ] ( http://lynx-travel.com/vacations/nz2000/wanaka/gates%20of%20haast%20bridge%20over%20haast%20gorge.jpg ) and across haast pass into wanaka . 
  you can stay here if you want , it 's slightly more easy on the wallet than queenstown , but for good reason ( imo . ), 
  from wanaka , you can just head over cardrona ( making sure to stop at the [ cardrona hotel ] ( https://richardtulloch.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/cardrona-hotel.jpg ) ( non-alcoholic for the driver , of course . ), 
  and then down the [ crown range road ] ( http://i.ytimg.com/vi/il986p_ooee/maxresdefault.jpg ) ( video which that shot is from [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il986p_ooee ) ), 
  once you 're in queenstown there 's a fair bit you can do , but since it 's on pretty much every tourism website and you probably already know most of it i 'm not going to bother with most of it , since i 'll run out of characters in this post otherwise . 
  i will suggest spending a day , or at least part of one , in [ arrowtown ] ( https://bessiejb.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_6905.jpg ) though , maybe booking a spot on a [ 4wd tour ] ( http://nomadsafaris.co.nz/tours/4wd/ ) if you want to see some of the back country , although they can be pricey ( a day trip to macetown is about $ 175 ) . 
  around july is school holidays , so there 'll probably be quite a few people in queenstown given its role as a hub for skiing . 
  you could take a tour to milford sound , either in a [ bus ] ( https://www.realjourneys.co.nz/en/experiences/coach-tours/coach-trips-to-milford-sound/ ) or by car . 
  only do the latter if you 've got experience driving in cold weather , since even if there 's no snow the road will probably be icey , and you also have the [ homer tunnel ] ( http://flashpackatforty.com/wp-content/gallery/road-trip-to-wanaka/homer-tunnel-inside-eeeeek.jpg ) to deal with . 
  but it 's [ worth it ] ( https://cdn.urbantimes.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/02687_milfordsoundsunrise_1440x900.jpg ) . 
  if you do choose to drive , staying a night in te anau either side means you can stay longer in milford sound and leave in the morning before the tour buses make it to te anau ( since they 're leaving from queenstown ) , which means you can experience the stuff along the way without having to contend with dozens of other tourists . 
  moving on from there , when you leave queenstown and head back up the island the best route would be up the middle , over [ lindis pass ] ( http://dphotomagazine.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/lindispasscolour-670x446.jpg ) and up past [ lake pukaki and mount cook ] ( http://www.goodbyevirginiahelloworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/lake-pukaki-1.jpg ) ( our highest mountain ) into tekapo . 
  if you decide to spend the night here and get lucky with the weather you can be treated to some [ awesome ] ( http://laketekapountouched.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/7075972.jpg ) [ night ] ( http://www.williamsphotography.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/south-island-may13-006.jpg ) [ skies ] ( http://www.terrastro.com/wp-content/gallery/lake-tekapo/crown-jewels-above-lake-tekapo.jpg ) . 
  you can also [ book a tour ] ( http://www.tekapotourism.co.nz/activities/earth_and_sky.html ) of [ mt john observatory ] ( http://www.tekapotourism.co.nz/activities/images/earthsky_1.jpg ) , a facility owned by the university of canterbury which has [ awesome views ] ( http://www.tekapotourism.co.nz/activities/images/earthsky_4.jpg ) , even if you just went up there during the day for a cuppa at the cafe there ( again , steep road so only if you know what you 're doing . 
  the night tour takes a van from the township , so you do n't need to worry ) . 
  tours are about ~ $ 140 though , so again a bit pricey . 
  from here it 's relatively smooth sailing back to chch , [ geraldine ] ( http://www.fourcorners.co.nz/content/images/4315/978x255crop/geraldine-central-south-island-tourism.jpg ) is a fairly good pit stop on the way back . 
  now , if you 're going to the north island , the best way at this point is to drive up the [ coast ] ( https://www.rankers.co.nz/system/experience_images/5877/large.jpg?1292556401 ) to picton and catch the ferry . 
  around [ kaikoura ] ( http://www.whitemorph.co.nz/admin/images_bank/bankkaikoura-view.jpg ) you should be able to see a fair bit of wildlife . 
  seals can be seen from the road usually , while if you 're lucky you can see dolphins and whales ( although normally you 'd need to go on a boat trip to see them . ), 
  once you get to [ picton ] ( http://sequoialodge.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/picton_view.jpg ) , you drive onto the ferry and then enjoy a leisurely trip through [ the marlborough sounds ] ( https://www.transfercar.co.nz/blog/wp-content/uploads/interislander.jpg ) , potentially followed by a [ fairly rough crossing of cook strait ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpjwmdaywzs ) . 
  once you get to [ wellington ] ( http://www.wellington.amorahotels.com/d/wellington/media/wellington/wellington_images/wellington_harbour_credit_rob_suisted.jpg ) though you 're fine , it 's an awesome city to spend a day or two in . 
  if you get a clear day you can see the south island from wellington 's south coast , i remember sitting there as a kid having fish and chips on the beach for tea and seeing the ferry go across in front of the kaikouras , great memories . 
  there 's also the [ cable car ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/wellington_nz-cablecar-topview.jpg ) which has great views over the city . 
  once you leave wellington , you head up the [ kapiti coast ] ( http://www.aatravel.co.nz/location/media/paraparaumu01_creditdw.jpg ) and then follow state highway 1 into the [ central plateau ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7111/7529655732_fbd815643c_b.jpg ) , home to three active volcanoes ( [ ruapehu , ngauruhoe and tongariro ] ( http://www.kahupublishing.co.nz/images/panoramas/tongariro05_l.jpg ) ) . 
  you then drive past [ lake taupo ] ( http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1334963422/889/6784889.jpg ) , which was formed as a result of two volcanic eruptions , the first of which was the largest known eruption on earth in the past 70,000 years , and the other which was the most violent eruption in the world over the last 5000 years . 
  i suggest stopping in rotorua , which has a bunch of geothermal attractions , including the [ pohutu geyser ] ( http://www.explorecentralnorthislandnz.com/wp-content/gallery/rotorua/pohutu-geyser.jpg ) , the [ waimangu valley ] ( http://dbijapkm3o6fj.cloudfront.net/resources/3139,3,1,6,4,0/-3673-/20000101/waimangu-experience-half-day-guided-tour-waimangu-volcanic-valley-ltd-rotorua.jpeg ) and [ wai-o-tapu ] ( http://www.aucklanddailyphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/17032013-dsc_8609-1-1024.jpg ) , as well as tamaki maori village , which would give some introduction to maori culture . 
  from here it 'd be a drive up to auckland to go to the airport , but if you had time you could stop in the [ coromandel ] ( http://www.explorecentralnorthislandnz.com/wp-content/gallery/coromandel/coromandel-fullsize-srgb-9.jpg ) for a day . 
  shit , i 've run out of room . 
  if you want i 'll give the other options in a reply ?
