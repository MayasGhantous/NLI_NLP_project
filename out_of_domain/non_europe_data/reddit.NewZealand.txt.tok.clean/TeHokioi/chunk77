  glad to get approval - still not quite finished though , missed out nelson and probably a fair bit of the north island . 
  though i reckon i should get an [ i-site flair ] ( http://www.buller.co.nz/assets/uploads/isite-logo-640x6.jpg ) since i do this fairly often, 
  / u/thewhoha , you did that awesome comic-book style image of the x-wings from the first trailer , right ? 
  any chance you could do the same for that first shot of the crashed star destroyer ? 
  not sure how it 'd look , but could be cool, 
  yeah , you 're the person i was thinking of - no idea of the author sorry , like i said it was either a guy from the early 20th century or a guy from the early 21st century , fair bit of distance between the two, 
  was a paperback , remember seeing it at both your shop and the whitcoulls in the mall . 
  in both places it was in the travel literature section, 
  i 'm pretty sure it was the balkans , might be wrong though . 
  ca n't remember anything in the title , but i think it follows two other books in a series and was interrupted by ww1 . 
  i 'm in at work tomorrow too , might come in and have another look , say gidday or whatever . 
  depends if i have time or not though, 
  holy fuck , that 's it . 
  you 're amazing , thank you !, 
  there may or may not be a new zealand mod [ already in the works ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a18vusb.png?1 ) ... 
  but to address your suggestion , why busby ? 
  yeah , he worked on the treaty , but he never actually * led * new zealand . 
  seems a bit odd , especially when you 've got the likes of king dick and michael savage , even massey and holyoake . 
  i also think the focus of the civ is wrong . 
  the ua requires warmongering , which has never been part of new zealand 's tradition . 
  sure , we 've gone off and fought in wars , but it 's always been in a supporting role for one of our allies , normally either britain or america . 
  with the exception of a [ technological anomaly ] ( http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/culture/books/2842026/did-nz-declare-war-first ) , we 've never declared war on another nation first . 
  new zealand wars are an exception to this of course , but i would n't say that 's part of new zealand proper so much as the formation of new zealand , which is n't indicative of our current society in the slightest . 
  i think a tourism / science oriented civ would be better , personally . 
  anzac as a unique are a bit iffy , given they 're both kiwi and australian , but i ca n't think of any other unique other than maybe the maori battalion . 
  same thing goes with the marae , and it 's an issue we 've been having with the nz mod we 're working on . 
  also , the city order annoys me more than it should . 
  wellington is the capital , so it should be the capital in the game . 
  also , you have dunedin twice . 
  nice touch having `` let me entertain you '' at the start of the show , too, 
  just realised i forgot the day by day thing to give an idea of how long it 'd take , so i might as well continue . 
  day 1 : [ chch - glaciers ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/hfqu9 ) - 374km , probably takes about 5-7 hours , including driving to conditions and stopping . 
  potentially issues with porters and arthur 's passes with road snowfall . 
  day 2 : [ glaciers - queenstown ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/f2zzw ) - 350km , wo n't take as long as day 1 though . 
  day 3 : queenstown, 
  day 4 : queenstown , then leave in the afternoon for [ te anau ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/oxmei ) - 171km . 
  day 5 : [ te anau - milford sound ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/nlsss ) round trip . 
  ~ 2.5 hours each way , ~ 2 hour cruise . 
  fairly long day , good idea to spend the night in te anau again . 
  check road snowfall warnings for the milford road . 
  day 6 : back to queenstown , another day there . 
  day 7 : [ queenstown - tekapo ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/1tt1w ) , 257km , lindis pass might be an issue with snow . 
  day 8 : [ tekapo - christchurch ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/xpr1b ) , 226km , mostly straight driving on the canterbury plains . 
  day 9 : christchurch, 
  day 10 : [ christchurch - wellington ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/p36mp ) , 337km of driving and an inter-island ferry , ~ 8-9 hours ( assuming a normal crossing . ), 
  day 11 : wellington, 
  day 12 : [ wellington - rotorua ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/qalfi ) , longest day of driving at 452km . 
  should probably take about 7 hours including rest stops , photo stops and all that . 
  should take just under 3\u00a01/2 hours , and then catch the flight out in the evening ? 
  if you had more time , there are some other options which could be included in the trip . 
  i 'll list them as separate options , but for the most part they 'll just add on to the above , which i wo n't go into because i do n't want to spend another five posts on it :, 
  ** option 2 : nelson and tasman add-on **, 
  [ map ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/rqznl ), 
  days 1-9 as above . 
  then , you 've got a couple options . 
  what i 've put on the map is heading over arthur 's pass again , then up the coast . 
  it 's a bit of a roundabout route , but it means you get to stop off at [ punakaiki ] ( http://www.punakaiki.co.nz/wp-content/themes/punakaiki/images/punakaiki-header03.jpg ) , home to the famed [ pancake rocks ] ( http://www.paparoa.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/punakaiki.jpg ) , which you may recognise if you 're a fan of walking with dinosaurs as one of the filming locations . 
  you 're probably not going to see any pterosaurs , though . 
  the area around punakaiki also has a bunch of tracks and caves if you 're going hang around for a bit and are n't opposed to a bit of walking , such as the [ pororari river ] ( http://www.newzealandphoto.info/photos/reka-pororari-punakaiki-novy-zeland-121.jpg ) and the [ nile river caves ] ( http://newzealandtrails.com/sites/default/files/nile-river-caves-entrance.jpg ) . 
  driving up , you 'd go through the [ buller gorge ] ( https://giveitaburl.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/hawks-crag-buller-gorge.jpg ) and then meet up with the lewis pass road just shy of murchison . 
  lewis pass road is a shorter option , and you 'd be driving through [ beech forest ] ( http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/i0000ev6nqpzsbwo/s/880/880/lewis-pass-road.jpg ) for most of the way . 
  you 'd also go past [ maruia falls ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bgtyc2-v_km/t0rnelpdl9i/aaaaaaaaahy/agcxs1lgata/s1600/maruia.jpg ) , which were formed by an 7.8 earthquake in 1929 . 
  personally i 'd recommend the west coast over lewis pass , but it 's just my preference . 
  moving on from there , and i 've suggested staying a night at [ kaiteriteri ] ( https://ouramazingnzadventure.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/little-kaiteriteri-beach.jpg ) . 
  not sure how nice it would be in winter , but if you get a good day it should be fine . 
  from here you can go further into abel tasman , and i included a side trip up to [ collingwood ] ( http://www.teara.govt.nz/files/29124-pc.jpg ) and the base of [ farewell spit ] ( https://nzfrenzysouth.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/farewell-spit-from-near-pillar-pt-lighthouse.jpg ) just because it 's pretty cool back of beyond sort of country , cool one-way bridges over estuaries and everything . 
  there 's a walk across farmland to a beach with some cool windswept forest too . 
  after that , you could spend some time in nelson if you want before heading up across the top , past [ cable bay ] ( https://tomakassphotography.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/cable-bay-1.jpg ) and into marlborough . 
  at [ havelock ] ( http://www.newzealandstocklibrary.co.nz/gallery/south_island/marlborough/havelock/nzsl-sb-004277.jpg ) you can turn off the main state highway and follow [ queen charlotte drive ] ( https://nzfrenzysouth.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/roadside-views-along-queen-charlotte-drive.jpg ) along the sounds through to picton , where you 'd catch the ferry . 
  this would probably add three days to the trip , but if you 've got good weather it 'd be worth it . 
  as i said , there are still more options , but it 's late now and i have work early tomorrow . 
  if you want i can try write a couple others up tomorrow if i get a chance , but the quick tl ; dr of it would be the catlins , northland and possibly the east coast of the north island , but i do n't really know enough about the ni to cover it properly . 
  i 've missed the last two chch meetups , when 's the next one / u/chodrick ? 
  i just got a s5 off 1day the other day to replace my s3 . 
  kind of a shame , my s3 is almost at nokia levels of sturdiness . 
  lost count of how many times i 've dropped it and the screen 's only broken once . 
  today is saturday the 18th of april . 
  on this day in 1930 , there was no news . 
  the bbc news report on the day said as much , and then featured piano music for the rest of the bulletin . 
  you mean like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4py3qtigyo ) ? 
  i do n't know , he was just the last person to organise one so i figured it would be him, 
  are n't there anti-monopoly laws ? 
  why is sky exempt ? 
  there 's usually fancy commemorative tins which you can buy around anzac day full of biscuits too , which i do n't think are sold year round, 
  i 'm the same . 
  loved them years ago , had them again recently and they tasted terrible . 
  i 'm hoping that they just changed the recipe and were actually good back in the day, 
  did n't they say the whole thing will focus on africa ? 
   but unlike our broader approach to aof , we 've decided to build out more of a thematic flair and pay a visit to a continent south of europe with a rich history : africa . 
  we 'll be covering civilizations both born within the content , as well empires that held great power in the region -- including one that has been requested many , many , many times by the fans . 
  i thought it was helping you move ? 
  are you moving to his house ? 
  probably because it was a joke , unless you actually needed help i guess . 
  but nah , i 'd offer to organise one but i do n't know enough about town to know where to go or anything, 
  what options have you got left ? 
  diplomacy failed , only remaining choices as i can see it are either a swift and decisive show of force or a tactical manouver . 
  gah , cbd is too far out of the way . 
  would it because possible to order it in your store and get it transferred there ? 
  would mean i can just walk over in a lunch break instead of driving 20 minutes out of the way, 
  [ here 's a post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/32tc8y/need_some_advice_or_suggestions_for_my_holiday_to/cqf0sui ) i made a couple days ago offering travel advice to someone coming out here too .
