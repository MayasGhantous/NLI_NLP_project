  you 've got two weeks here , which should be plenty to complete the trip i suggested there . 
  basically , since you 'd be flying in and out of auckland most likely , what i would suggest is doing this in reverse :, 
  23rd may : arrive , spend morning in auckland then [ drive in afternoon to rotorua ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/xkype ) , 246km . 
  should take just under 3\u00a01/2 hours, 
  24th may : spend a day in rotorua , lots of geothermal attractions here and maori cultural experiences . 
  25th may : drive from [ rotorua down to wellington ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/qalfi ) , longest day of driving at 452km . 
  should probably take about 7 hours including rest stops , photo stops and all that . 
  26th may : day in wellington, 
  27th may : catch the ferry over to picton , then [ drive down to christchurch ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/p36mp ) , 337km of driving and an inter-island ferry , ~ 8-9 hours ( assuming a normal crossing . ), 
  28th may : spend a day in christchurch ? 
  29th may : [ drive from christchurch over the alps and down the west coast to the glaciers ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/hfqu9 ) - 374km , probably takes about 5-7 hours , including driving to conditions and stopping . 
  30th may : [ keep going down the coast from the glaciers and into queenstown ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/f2zzw ) - 350km , wo n't take as long as the 29th though, 
  31st may : queenstown, 
  1st june : queenstown , then leave in the afternoon for [ te anau ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/oxmei ) - 171km . 
  2nd june : [ te anau - milford sound ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/nlsss ) round trip . 
  ~ 2.5 hours each way , ~ 2 hour cruise . 
  fairly long day , good idea to spend the night in te anau again . 
  check road snowfall warnings for the milford road . 
  3rd june : back to queenstown , another day there . 
  4th june : [ queenstown - tekapo ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/1tt1w ) , 257km , lindis pass might be an issue with snow but this early on you should be fine . 
  5th june : [ tekapo - christchurch ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/xpr1b ) , 226km , mostly straight driving on the canterbury plains , then drop the car off at chch airport and fly back to auckland . 
  this leaves a couple days leeway if you decide to spend a couple extra days in one place , or if you wanted to take a bit of a detour and go check out somewhere else . 
  if you wanted you could go around [ nelson and tasman regions ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/rqznl ) instead of down through christchurch the first time . 
  there is a fair bit of driving in this , but it 's split up enough that there 's only a couple days where you 'd be mainly driving , and even then there 's enough stuff along the way that you can stop for a bit and check out some of the surroundings . 
  it 's all in the post i linked , i have n't reproduced it here since it 's fucking massive . 
  one thing which you may know since you 're in the uk is that it 's the 100th anniversary of the gallipoli landings this year , which means we 've got a ton of ww1 and anzac commemorations going on . 
  there 's an exhibition down in wellington recreating it that was done by peter jackson and weta workshops ( lord of the rings , king kong etc ) , and the war museum in waiouru which you 'd pass on the 25th would probably have some stuff . 
  as far as sports goes , you 're here about a week before the targeted opening of the season for skifields , but there 's a chance that they 'd open early if we get a big dump of snow early . 
  [ fixed link ] ( http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/poll-shows-steady-even-after-northland-election-loss-6293625 ), 
  probably the arabic if you 're not fluent, 
  the first world war and the fight against is are two completely different beasts . 
  up until ww2 ( and probably korea too ) wars were fought differently . 
  they had defined fronts , defined parties , set battlefields . 
  they were they sort of wars which would be fought like a chess game by the higher-ups , moving little pieces on a big table and trying to capture strategic points , with the soldiers acting as pawns . 
  it was hell , but at least you knew who you were fighting . 
  ever since vietnam though , the wars which the west has been involved in have been much dirtier by comparison . 
  instead of fighting equally sized powers , the opposition are insurgents or rebel groups . 
  they do n't fight conventional warfare , and the soldiers are n't the same disillusioned pawns of earlier wars . 
  no longer are there defined fronts , strategic points or organised army regiments . 
  instead , the opposition is becoming blurred with the civilian population , as it was in vietnam . 
  just like then , we 've seen american forces killing civilians and labeling them as ` enemy combatants , ' a far cry from the distinct separation of the world wars . 
  similarly , in the world wars the forces were reasonably evenly matched . 
  now though , we 've got to a point where children in the middle east are [ scared of blue skies ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4nrjocnhis ) because of america 's drone involvement . 
  america now has the capability to rain death upon the middle east with no risk whatsoever to its own personnel , and then call whatever it hits the target . 
  what does this have to do with the anzacs , though ? 
  surely at the end of the day , it 's all still fighting and killing ? 
  it goes back to the chess analogy . 
  the anzac forces were just pawns in a giant geopolitical game of chess which had the whole of europe as the board . 
  they were ordered onto the beach heads at gallipoli by generals in cushy positions who wanted to drive the ottomans out of the war and open a supply line to the eastern front . 
  at anzac day , we honour those who were caught up in the game but had no say in the course of events . 
  the current involvement in iraq , on the other hand , sees us and the west as the instigators . 
  we 've had a direct say in the matter and made the choice to get involved in a conflict so brutally one-sided that it 's not even funny . 
  however , our foe in this is n't one with a concrete border or defense force , it is one who can practice guerrilla tactics and strike anywhere at any point , then retreat into hiding . 
  we saw it in vietnam , we saw it in afghanistan and we 're going to see it here . 
  there 's no easy way out against a foe who has nothing to lose , and when we made the decision ourselves it 's on our hands . 
  we 're now the player , or at least part of him, 
  maybe the wop wops, 
  i love that view , used to go to arrowtown every summer as a kid . 
  miss it so much, 
  oi , stealing my job ?

  i was going to go there , but then i realised it would mean i 'd have to live in auckland, 
  it is if you live in dallas, 
  you telling me to show up after you 've left for the day or something ? 
  i should probably start making it clearer when i 'm joking or something : /, 
  that said , would i have to come in today to get the book ? 
  i 'm in at work tomorrow so it might be easier to come in then, 
  this makes me feel slightly better about myself, 
  not sure about other unis , but at uc it 's free if you 're enrolled at the health centre, 
  today 's my day off , you 'll need to talk to / u/appexxd about it, 
  god fucking dammit, 
  playing car race game with some fancy endurance challenge , with the prize of winning being getting the car for free ( in the game , of course . ), 
  last race is 12 laps at le mans , which took about 40 minutes . 
  win that , get the popup saying ' 1st ' then the game crashes , losing all my progress .

  wait ? 
  at least two of our mods are ministers ? 
  i smell a conspiracy ... 
  nah , real racing 3 on ios, 
  i did n't play the whole thing straight though , paused it every now and then to take a break, 
  i was lucky enough to get my firstname.lastname on hotmail , use it over gmail as my main because i could n't get a gmail without a bunch of extra shit thrown on the end, 
  but that drives prices down !, 
  i need this job , i 've got bills to pay !, 
  we 're always open to bribes . 
  well , at least i am, 
  i think i just bought a car . 
  anyone know whether late 90s ford lasers are any good ? 
  that 's part of the fun !, 
  i finally got mine a week or so ago , although now i have the issue of not wanting to spend any,
