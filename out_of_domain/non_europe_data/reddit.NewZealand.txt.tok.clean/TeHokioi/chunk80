  i just played a game on ricochet with about five someballs , both me and the other veterans were fairly helpful and understanding of it . 
  i guess it depends on what server you 're on . 
  that 's one of my most vivid memories from my trip to japan , sitting at the window seat on the way there , looking out over the south pacific with the sun streaming in . 
  put on some smooth jazz and it was just perfect, 
  it does n't look like anyone asking questions is new, 
  wow , i 've never seen diameter on triple digits , ever . 
  this is insane, 
  first time i 've ever seen diameter over triple digits too . 
  was fun while it lasted, 
  wait , what ? 
  why ? 
  imo what the big issue is is that the modder only receives 25 % of the price , and that they need to have $ 100 before they can cash out . 
  so if i make a mod , i effectively need to sell $ 400 worth before i can see any of the money, 
  that 's stupid . 
  i mean , it 's one thing to be banned if you 're saying `` go upvote this post '' but nobody did that afaik, 
  turner 's , we managed to negotiate it down from 4400-5400 as-is to 3500 with a new wof, 
  yeah , the chch one is where i got it from, 
  depends , from the sound of it this one had sat through a couple auctions so they were keen to get rid of it, 
  reminds me how much we need a new css, 
  karma and post history are tricky , since there would likely be a lot of people ( myself included ) who frequent askreddit but do n't post because they 're in the wrong time zone or show up late or whatever, 
  i know , i just pretty much copied the title from the post on / r/turkey , just changed the second part a bit so it would be clearer for people who have n't grown up learning about the gallipoli campaign, 
  today is sunday the 26th of april . 
  on this day in 1721 an earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 7.7 destroyed the city of tabriz , in modern day iran , killing between 8,000 and 250,000 people . 
  also today , in 1966 a magnitude 7.5 earthquake devastated the city of tashkent , uzbekistan . 
  today 's facts are brought to you by r\u016bamoko, 
  there was a game i play which was the top result for ages , but then got deleted because the community has vote brigaded it in the past . 
  pretty much just capture the flag with balls , really simple but great fun and addictive too . 
  games are over nice and quick as well , so it 's good to fill in a couple minutes here and there, 
  does n't your family give you an irrational amount of negative commentary about everything ? 
  i ca n't speak for everywhere , but at least where i work buying the display model is fine . 
  they 're not damaged ( much ) and all get completely reset before sale . 
  give it a bit of a clean and you 're good to go, 
  i think they had the < around the wrong way , the rest of the comment seems to indicate they prefer infinite over the original, 
  god , that version of * fortunate son * in the context still gives me chills . 
  unlike any version i 'd ever heard , completely changed the song, 
  to be fair , display microwaves are n't really used like display laptops are, 
  do n't you get it though ? 
  it 's only a war crime when other people do it !, 
  hopefully soon to add nz to the list , unless you would n't count a private launch, 
  [ let james may help ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtfgzfil8bk ), 
  but even if you worked in a restaurant which had a contract with coke , surely you would have heard of 7-up ? 
  wait , is 7up not a pepsi product ? 
  where i live it 's always sold alongside pepsi and mountain dew in places with a pepsi contract, 
  not me !, 
  ^ i ^ took ^ the ^ day ^ off ^ because ^ i ^ have ^ to ^ write ^ an ^ essay ^ by ^ tomorrow ... 
  nah , that 'd be if she 'd already produced a single and then he came along and destroyed every copy of it, 
  damn you two and your long usernames , they do n't work in that ` up a tree ' rhyme . 
  maybe if i shorten your name to 404 ? 
  yeah , that 'd probably work . 
  so there !, 
  * we did it reddit !, 
  i 'm gon na be that guy and ask all the normal sort of questions you would have been asked dozens of times now - how long , where in japan and all that ? 
  paging / u/appexxd , come in / u/appexxd , you 're needed in the daily facts department, 
  pft , where 's the commitment ? 
  shameful display, 
  was kind of expecting that to go into a grandpa simpson rant , i 'm almost disappointed, 
  pft , that 's no fun, 
  and they 're engaged now , right ? 
  was n't aiming at anything , just making sure i had the right usernames, 
  i 'm 18 if that counts , i 've known about 7up for as long as i can remember, 
  just do n't forget about me when you 're sending out the wedding invites , okay ? 
  depends on which 30 % you understand, 
  i do n't know why you answered ` o ' on so many questions , the options only go up to d, 
  is that four hours drive one way or return ? 
  four hours one way covers most of the north island ... 
  according to some guy i have on facebook , if he 's convicted and the crime carries a maximum penalty of two or more years imprisonment ( regardless of the actual penalty ) he has to resign according to the electoral code . 
  edit : okay , i looked into it . 
  the part in question is s 55 ( 1 ) ( d ) of the electoral act 1993 , which states :, 
   the seat of any member of parliament shall become vacant --, 
   ( d ) if he or she is convicted of an offence punishable by imprisonment for life or by 2 or more years ' imprisonment , or is convicted of a corrupt practice , or is reported by the high court in its report on the trial of an election petition to have been proved guilty of a corrupt practice ;, 
  so he 'd need to be convicted of a crime which has a punishment of 2 years or more . 
  now , common assault only has a maximum sentence of one year according to section 196 of the crimes act 1961 , so this would n't apply . 
  however , section 194 has this :, 
  assault on a child , or by a male on a female, 
   every one is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years who --, 
   ( b ) being a male , assaults any female . 
  given john key is a male , and the waitress is female , he could be convicted of male assaults female , which would carry the two years imprisonment required by the electoral act to vacate his seat in parliament . 
  then he 'd need to vacate his ministerial role within 28 days of leaving parliament , although this is according to the cabinet manual , and we all know how much respect key holds that with . 
  if he 's in wellington there 's a good chance we do, 
  funny how that works , is n't it ? 
  i met him at a conference a couple years back , wish i went to uni up there though . 
  to be fair , the ponytail thing made headlines worldwide , it 's entirely possible they just heard about it on the news there and decided it was so weird they had to do a story on it, 
   in this act , unless the context otherwise requires , --, 
   ** assault ** means the act of intentionally applying or attempting to apply force to the person of another , directly or indirectly , or threatening by any act or gesture to apply such force to the person of another , if the person making the threat has , or causes the other to believe on reasonable grounds that he or she has , present ability to effect his or her purpose ; and ** to assault ** has a corresponding meaning, 
  i suppose you could argue that pulling her ponytail was intentionally applying force to the person of another , although it would depend on what counts as ` force ' ( which is n't defined in section 2 ), 
  morning !, 
  today is tuesday the 28th of april . 
  on this day in 1503 , the first battle in history which used small gunpowder weapons was fought . 
  today 's fact was brought to you by having 1500 words still to write by 3pm, 
  guess you just won the karma lottery, 
  the [ battle of ceringola ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_cerignola ) , between spain and france, 
  seems it was the first battle which was won as a result of using them , my bad, 
  yeah , it used to be the grim reaper, 
  yeah , i did think it was a bit odd that the first battle was between france and spain and not one of the eastern powers , since they used it way earlier, 
  i wish we had that . 
  i 'm normally out working in the storeroom , which is the main route outside and so whenever someone comes back from having a smoke the whole storeroom stinks, 
  and then there 's the footpath outside which is almost white ( instead of the normal red / brown brick ) due to all the cigarette ash, 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's one of the mods , ca n't remember which one . 
  i had the same issue in a mod game with foxes, 
  i ca n't see you making it back before 5:30,
