  speaking of world war two , today is 70 years to the day since the red army announced it had captured berlin , with the hoisting of the soviet flag over the reichstag building . 
  on the same day , general heinrich von vietinghoff surrendered all wehrmacht forces fighting in italy , and the us 82nd airborne division liberated the w\u00f6bbelin concentration camp , finding over 1000 dead prisoners in the process . 
  in lighter news , today in 1952 saw the first commercial flight of a jet airliner , which flew from london to johannesburg . 
  and finally , four years ago today united states special forces killed osama bin laden in a raid in pakistan .

  * stand right up * is a perfect example of king cannon 's style - pure rock , with some blues influences and lyrics with a similar ` working class ' focus to that frequently used by american giants bon jovi and bruce springsteen . 
  prior to their breakup in 2013 , they released just one album and two eps , all featuring a similar genre and with a same standard of music across the board - it was hard choosing one song to have as the main .

  i had 100 % save at one point , but that was just me winning on my first and only save attempt, 
  oh , the rubber industry was only the start of it . 
  they made what were essentially class divisions into two separate races because it was easier for them , and essentially taught them to hate each other . 
  gave rise to pretty much every major conflict in the region since then , including the rwandan genocide , which saw the deaths of up to 1 million tutsis in just 100 days , and the second congo war , which caused up to 5.5 million deaths over the five year war , many of whom were civilians, 
  yeah , i made the leaderhead for it , and the [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/arvjkhh.jpg ), 
  thanks , it was my first shot at a leaderhead and i admittedly had some help from another guy who polished it off , but i 'm reasonably happy with it . 
  also considering doing another nz under savage for ww2 civs, 
  well , there 's already the maori ( which were mine too , but i only did the map and the code ) , but the main issue is getting uniques . 
  it was bad enough trying to find two unique things for one nz , but having to find four would be a nightmare . 
  i 'm thinking maori battalion / cenotaph , but if you have any ideas for other uniques that would be appreciated, 
  cenotaph would be a unique monument , i do n't think a unique pasture would work for a ww2 focused nz, 
  well are n't you just a wonderful human being, 
  surely it 's a bit quick to label a whole country 's music as shit ? 
  if you have any suggestions feel free to bring them up , i 'm not going to be able to do this all alone, 
  heh , my original idea was to have the maori battalion and long range desert group as the uniques , but then i thought of the cenotaph as a possible alternative . 
  yeah , the font was weird . 
  it 's new pltmouth too, 
  is this becoming our speedforce ? 
  scarlet witch , mainly because i 'd never say no to seeing more of her, 
  what got me about ultron is how similar the mannerisms were to spader 's character in the blacklist too . 
  like in the church , when they walk in and he 's just sitting there talking about the history of the building , completely nonchalant about the whole thing, 
  ok , since some of you seem to hate the bands i choose you should probably suggest some alternatives and give me enough on them to cover the writeup , since it 's a bit difficult if i know absolutely nothing about a band to write about them and choose other songs from them . 
  coming from fielding , evermore is widely known for their soaring anthems reminiscent of megabands such as u2 and coldplay , a sound which has earned them multiple awards and nominations throughout their career . 
  although some songs have suffered from overuse as a result of use in the media and on hold music , their songs remain popular amongst many in the country .

  paschendale too , about , well , paschendale, 
  should we count stuff that was current at the time ? 
  if so , u2 have a bunch - please , peace on earth are both about the conflict in ireland , bullet the blue sky is about the el salvadorean civil war , mothers of the disappeared is about the dictatorships in latin america who would ` disappear ' opponents and so on, 
  [ u2 - van diemen 's land ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux8qxtzetk4 ) is about irish ` convicts ' being sent to tasmania by the british back when australia was a prison colony . 
  if you count stuff that was current at the time but historical now , u2 has a bunch more too, 
  20 with freedom , makes it much more worthwhile, 
  not if they went through the south pacific . 
  in otl they got all the way down to the solomons , from where they could island hop east across the pacific until reaching south america . 
  this would be a lot longer though , and would still hit us territories in the process ( primarily american samoa , possibly guam as well ), 
  i was going to do fat freddy 's or someone tomorrow to get a bit of variety in , maybe elemeno p on tuesday ? 
  i have a feeling it would cost him the election , if the flag is anything to go by, 
  metric or imperial ? 
  today is monday the fourth of may . 
  on this day in 1904 , construction on the panama canal is begun by america , who took over the endeavour after previous failed attempts by other countries . 
  also today , italy occupied the island of rhodes in 1912 , whom retained control of it and the other islands in the dodecanese until after the end of world war two . 
  in 1961 , the freedom ride bus trip begins their trip through the us south , and in 1979 margret thatcher officially became the first female prime minister of the united kingdom,

  milk price rise excuse , please choose one :, 
  \u2610 prices are rising worldwide , we need to keep up with the trend, 
  \u2611 global prices are falling , we need to up the price in nz to compensate, 
  i think he 's trying to paint it as separate from gender , which is actually pretty significant as it would mean it would be seen as just standard assault as opposed to male assaults female , which would mean that he would be allowed to stay in office if he was convicted, 
  they 're pretty small fault lines though . 
  generally the length of a fault line is associated with the power of an earthquake on it . 
  [ this ] ( http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1340843335/129/7186129.jpg ) is one about an hour or two from me , and it 's one of the longest natural straight lines in the world . 
  when it goes , it 's going to be an earthquake a whole order of magnitude bigger than nepal , probably on a scale similar to japan 's earthquake a couple years ago . 
  but that 's only because it 's so huge , a smaller fault line like the ones under your house are probably only capable of generating much smaller earthquake , probably nothing more than a 5 . 
  what you should be more worried about is the possibility that you 've got an undiscovered fault nearby that 's much bigger, 
  kind of similar , but the type of shaking is an easy way to see how close an earthquake is to you . 
  if it 's a violent shaking with sudden movement ( like if you were shaking something yourself ) it 's close by , but if it 's a more rolling motion ( like if you were on a boat ) it means it 's further away, 
  should n't be too bad where you are , but in the city that i live in ( christchurch ) we had a series of huge earthquakes here back in 2010-2011 that caused a hell of a lot of damage . 
  first one was 7.1 and the second was 6.3 . 
  what was significant though is that both of them were extremely shallow , and occurred close to town . 
  they also both occurred on fault lines which were n't known about prior to the quakes , so they came as a shock to pretty much everyone . 
  ( as an aside , it 's also interesting to point out that while the nepal earthquake had a magnitude of 7.8 compared to the 6.3 of the february quake here , it only had an intensity of ix on the [ mercalli scale ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercalli_intensity_scale ) , whereas the 6.3 here had an intensity of x , which is typically associated with earthquakes larger than magnitude 8 . 
  but yeah , it 's likely that the quakes here were associated with the plate boundary , which would n't be an issue where you are . 
  a mainstay of the new zealand summer soundtrack , wandering eye is the most well known song of the seven-piece known as fat freddy 's drop . 
  the group formed in wellington , and was originally composed of people also involved in other bands in the nz reggae scene , including trinityroots and the black seeds . 
  in addition to nz , fat freddy 's have gained recognition in europe since their first single , which gained popularity particularly in germany . 
  their musical style , as with many new zealand bands , sees a mix of several genres , most notably including reggae and jazz , as well as dub , soul and r&b .

  i was n't talking about it so much in a legal context as in a public image view , not sure what the procedure around it would be and whether it would involve a jury , but if so that was what i was talking about, 
  it 's actually based on a book series by an aussie author , do n't know if there was any link between that and red dawn though, 
  glad to hear someone 's enjoying it , most people just tend to downvote it if they do n't like the band i chose . 
  i 'd like to have some lesser known bands , although they tend to have the issue of me not knowing about them . 
  that 's why i 've been asking for suggestions , and i 'm going to try work them in soon . 
  main issue as you said is trying to get ones with online songs , which is what 's holding me back with ddub , since i 'd want to have medicine man as the main one . 
  yeah , it 's the sound that 's the shocking thing imo . 
  when we had the 7.1 come through i expected the shaking , but did n't realise it was also going to sound like a train driving down the hallway,
