  it 's tricky , is n't it . 
  i think feminism has been given a bad rep by the ` men are pigs ' crowd , who claim they 're feminist when in actuality they 're matriarchal . 
  i 've seen egalitarianism being used as an alternative , but i do n't see an issue with feminism proper as long as that 's actually what it is, 
  i 've had a couple which were just huge bangs but no actual shaking , did n't realise they were earthquakes until geonet said so, 
  awesome , have you got a bit of info on them or a couple extra tracks ? 
  there 's a joke about that here in nz . 
  story goes that one of our prime ministers back in the 80 's , david lange , was talking to an american school group who was out on a trip around nz . 
  he says `` now , i 'm from the labour party , which is like your democrats . 
  the main opposition on the right is the national party , which is like your , um , democrats . '', 
  is n't there ? 
  if the conviction has a maximum sentence of two years or more he has to resign , assault has one year so he could remain . 
  or am i misunderstanding you still ? 
  a girl did this to me once , only problem was i 'd already turned her down about four times, 
  i feel like i 'm the only one that 's enjoying these new episodes . 
  i love most of the recent ones this season , laughed out loud heaps through the whole episode and found them great . 
  different tastes i guess , but some of the comments still seem a bit harsh, 
  yeah , my argument though was going beyond that and saying that if it went to a jury ( which i have no idea if it would or not since i do n't know how the judicial process works well enough ) that fighting a public image war now would potentially help him in the long run, 
  if you 're in a campervan , be sure to pull over to the side of the road to let others pass if you 've got people behind you . 
  campervans have to drive slower than cars on the open road in nz , so you 'll have people behind you getting impatient . 
  letting them pass means everyone 's safer and has a better trip, 
  i 'm wanting to mix both popular songs and less well known bands , so that there 's something for everyone . 
  feel free to suggest something you think i should cover, 
   todays facts of the day were bought to you by ... / u/nelfoos5 's credit card . 
  france was so strong as a colonial power it needed to get independence from itself, 
  the empire was called the british empire though , so i think saying britain to represent the uk is passable . 
  although i suppose at the height of its power ireland was a colonial possession and not a core part of the country though , so i dunno, 
  do n't underestimate it , but do n't overestimate it either . 
  the british lost battles to the gurkhas , the zulu , the maori and probably some others too . 
  while they may have ultimately won the wars , the british were n't this undefeatable force ,, 
  no , but they do . 
  i remember seeing a big national geographic article on the expedition, 
  holy shit , people actually believe the quakes were engineered by the govt ? 
  john key is n't malcolm merlyn , people !, 
  claimed to be new zealand 's biggest selling rock band , elemeno p 's songs have become widely known throughout new zealand ( in part due to their use in advertising campaigns , like many kiwi bands ) . 
  their prevalence within the rock scene has led to them touring with many other iconic kiwi bands ( including supergroove and shihad ) and acting as a headline act for new zealand music festivals .

  today is wednesday the 6th of may . 
  on this day in 1527 troops loyal to the hapsburg dynasty sack the city of rome , bringing about the beginning of the end for the renaissance . 
  also today , in 1889 the eiffel tower officially opened to the public , and in 1937 the hindenburg airship catches fire while attempting to dock , killing 36 people . 
  today 's facts were brought to you by poor time management again . 
  also be sure to check out today 's [ nz music month post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/34z9ty/the_feelers_one_world_nz_music_month_day_6/ ), 
  most of my complaints are of my own doing ( forgot about stuff until the day it 's due again ) so i 'm not going to bother with that . 
  why the hell do people feel the need to downvote and complain about nz music month on the posts ? 
  i get that not everyone is a fan of kiwi music , but surely it 's easy enough to just ignore it instead of taking time out of your day to post your super edgy `` lol dae nz music is shit nz music month is a joke '' comment ? 
  other than that , i think my main whinge of the week would have to be the fucking guy at westfields who does n't know how carparks work . 
  i was backing out of a park in my car after maybe a week of owning it , get half way out and the guy directly behind me decides he 's going to start backing out too . 
  does n't stop for anything except hitting my car , after honking the horn several times and others waving at him to stop . 
  low enough speed that i do n't think there 's any damage , but still a bit shit to have it happen so soon after buying the car . 
  he did the exact same thing after we talked it over , nearly hitting a car driving past, 
  i 'm still used to chemist being used to describe pharmacists too , i would have made the same mistake, 
  not bad at all , pretty good actually . 
  we like to make foreigners think the moa is extinct so they do n't expect our divisions of moa cavalry . 
  i feel sorry for the poor bugger who tries to invade us next, 
  yeah , it just seems a bit , i dunno . 
  it 's been hovering around the 0 mark all day , even the comment on it with the extra info . 
  i find it amazing that people spend extra time to go into it and downvote instead of just ignoring it . 
  nah , it 's got the controversial dagger thing , so there 's a fair amount of upvotes and downvotes on it . 
  oh shit , just realised he 's not a kiwi . 
  we have a bunch of stock behind a couple lines of fridges at work , maybe a metre and a half of room between the back of the fridge and the wall with most of it full of stock . 
  it stacks up normally above the height of the fridges and takes up the whole space . 
  so one time , a week before the ceo comes for a visit , the manager tells me that he 's been told the fridges need to be as close to the wall as possible , that none of the stock can be visible above the fridges and that we 've got no room anywhere else to move it , but it still has to be done . 
  my point is , this is the same as you moving out . 
  it 's physically impossible at this point to move out on your own terms while preserving the relationship as a whole . 
  you 're either going to stay there until you 're 25 , all the while being guilt-tripped and emotionally blackmailed , or you 're going to just leave , maybe burn a bridge , but get yourself out of the toxic environment . 
  of course , if it 's anything like my example there 's also the option of accidentally reaching critical mass and forming a black hole , but that 's highly unlikely . 
  mmp works fairly well over here in nz , you end up with better representation across the board for both local candidates and ideological support . 
  there are a few issues with the current system , but they 're nothing that could n't be ironed out upon implementing it, 
  well maybe it 's time you actually listen !, 
  while i have n't done it before , i 'm pretty sure they 'd eventually come to terms with your decision and accept it , and as long as you have the cop there you 'd be fine . 
  they 're overprotective , not stupid, 
  that 's a different one - mirror lakes are on the way to milford sound , lake matheson is close to fox glacier on the west coast, 
  basically , we 've got a 5 % threshold - so if a party gets less than 5 % of the party votes they do n't get any seats . 
  however , even if they get less than that but a party member wins an electorate seat they can take extra mps in with them , which means that you can potentially have one electorate given 4 % of the seats . 
  one example was in 2008 , where despite only getting 3 % of the vote act was able to get 5 members in parliament because they won an electorate seat . 
  there 's also an issue here of strategic voting , where candidates from tiny parties win electorate seats as proxies for larger ones so that they can get more seats overall .
