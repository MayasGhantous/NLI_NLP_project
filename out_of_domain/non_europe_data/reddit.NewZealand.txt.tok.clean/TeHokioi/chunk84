  the main example here is [ epsom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epsom_%28new_zealand_electorate%29 ) , which is a very firm national ( our main right wing party ) electorate . 
  however , ever since 2002 it 's been won by the act party , despite the party not getting over the 5 % threshold since 2002 ( in last year 's election , they got 0.69 % of the vote , only slightly more than the legalise cannabis party . ), 
  why this is important is that with the way mmp works , parties are allocated their electorate seats , and then receive remaining seats until their number of seats reflects the percentage of the popular vote they got . 
  so because act wins epsom instead of national , it 's essentially a national seat that does n't count towards their percentage , meaning they get extra influence . 
  pyroclastic flows in the middle of auckland probably would n't end well, 
  what settings do you use ? 
  no matter what i try whenever i go out my photos tend to end up with apollo levels of empty skies, 
  fury should show up at the last minute and make some snark comment about having to always rescue them, 
  have fun with the erupting volcano you 're [ about to have ] ( http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11444436 ), 
  okay guys , what was with the downvotes yesterday ? 
  i get you 're not going to love all my choices , but surely it 'd be easier to just ignore it and move on ? 
  either way , if you do n't like it say so and give me some better options to feature . 
  it 's a nice day down here in chch so i 'm doing a slightly more summery band , hope it 's good enough for the / r/nz music critics . 
  hailing from auckland , sola rosa blends several musical styles together to create a unique sound , as with many nz bands .

  yeah , the feelers were n't so much a proper choice as they were a band i knew four songs on and could do a writeup of in about a minute , since i 'd forgotten and had a ton of work to do that day . 
  i 'm thinking of doing katchafire at some point ( is that what you 're meaning by colour me life , or is there a band with that name i do n't know about ? ), 
  but i might cover a few other suggestions or an older band or two first . 
  i did think she was n't stupid enough to bring the vial back to nanda parbat, 
  22 after the earthquakes though , is n't it ? 
  the west coast here has a very similar climate to the pacific northwest , so it 's not surprising that they look similar, 
  i 'm pretty sure the underground rail road was n't actually a literal underground railroad, 
  kind of reminds me of nagasaki - there 's european churches within japanese style buildings , with chinese and dutch ones thrown in all over the show and some portuguese buildings too . 
  then there 's some massive communist-style monuments in the peace park , with a giant guy riding a turtle overlooking the whole city, 
  okay , can someone explain to me why they 're wanting to open up places like the denniston plateau to mining if they 're having to close mines elsewhere because of falling coal prices ? 
  backyard cricket is n't too bad . 
  all you really need is a tennis ball and a cricket bat . 
  a pole , tree or even backpack can count as stumps , then you have two people batting and everyone else fielding . 
  whenever someone gets out ( either by the stumps being hit , or by getting caught , ) whoever got them out goes in to bat . 
  you do n't really have a separate batting and fielding team in backyard cricket , it 's just everyone at once . 
  you can get [ proper sets ] ( http://www.greenbowsports.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/1b0a75a076a4e8b0214e36dd5b5573fa/g/a/garden_cricket_set.png ) that have stumps , bails and bats , but that 's not necessary really . 
  should just cancel the australia part and tour nz instead, 
  sorry for posting so late , no excuses this time . 
  today is friday the 8th of may . 
  on this day in 1886 a carbonated medicine known as coca-cola is sold for the first time by a pharmacist in america , and in 1902 mount pel\u00e9e erupts on the island of martinique , killing over 35,000 people . 
  today 's facts were brought to you by laziness, 
  why was it recounted if the conservatives had a 11k majority ? 
  oh wow , it 's the middle of the day here and i 'm still talking like i have n't slept for days, 
  i 'm down in new zealand , in the southern version of canterbury, 
  it was a tough choice not to go with april sun in cuba as dragon 's song for nz music month , however as fantastic as it is unfortunately april sun in cuba has been cursed with the blight of placement on hold music . 
  dragon 's songs have become part of new zealand music history , and were so successful that australia tried to steal the credit for them . 
  many of their hits were written by their keyboard player , who as a sheer coincidence shares a name with u2 frontman bono ( whose official name is paul hewson . ), 
  as with many successful rock bands , dragon was plagued with drug use , with drummer neil storey dying in 1976 of a heroin overdose . 
  the band also performed in the states and europe under the name hunter , although their '78 tour of the us ended up with the band being pelted off the stage following frontman marc hunter 's outburst at a crowd when performing in texas .

  holy crap , just had about four iroquois fly right over the house . 
  that was pretty damn cool, 
  yeah , out by the airport . 
  i think they 're on a farewell tour , since they 're about to be retired, 
  what happened to putting the username and all that at the end of the comment ? 
  surely that 'd help a bit ? 
  for april fool 's day , the subreddit changed the css so that it was all in serif font , with a huge first letter and all of the post information that 's normally at the top of the post ( author , karma , post date ) was at the end of the post instead ( where reply etc are ) . 
  people liked it like that , so last i heard they were keeping it . 
  but now for some reason it 's back to normal, 
  can someone better versed in british politics explain why people are saying it 's on course for a conservative victory , despite labour holding a fairly decent majority thus far ?
