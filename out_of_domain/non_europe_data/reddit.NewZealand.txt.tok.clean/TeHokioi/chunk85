  would probably be a simple matter of porting that over , unless it 's hardcoded . 
  which is a very real possibility, 
  oh * please , * everyone knows english longbowmen were bombarding paris without leaving the british isles . 
  you get to make the world a little bit more canadian ? 
   mothers day today, 
  shit, 
  i would n't mind a black flag , provided it was n't the whole flag . 
  maybe something like [ prussia 's flag ?

  good morning !, 
  today is sunday , may the tenth . 
  on this day in 1940 , german fighters bombed the german city of freiburg for some reason . 
  also on that same day , winston churchill was appointed prime minister of the united kingdom , the uk invaded iceland and germany began raiding british shipping . 
  a year later , the deputy fuhrer of nazi germany stole a german plane , flew to scotland and parachuted down to try and negotiate a peace settlement between the uk and germany . 
  he was summarily disowned by germany and imprisoned by the uk . 
  today 's facts are brought to you by the mothers of the world !, 
  take your mum out for breakfast or something, 
  he was a prisoner of war during the war ( but given lavish quarters to make him think he was a guest and was cooperating ) and then was put on trial at nuremberg after the war for crimes against peace and sentenced to life without parole . 
  after he died , the prison he was put in was demolished to stop it becoming a neo-nazi shrine, 
  but if breakfast is anything to go by , would n't that have meant he 'd stay unemployed and living at home ? 
  the sami sisters are a group formed by sisters madeline , anji and priya sami , who have to date released one album . 
  the album consists primarily of sad songs about breakups , however the musical style is very different from the standard pop genre . 
  additionally , / u/teamsteve once saw them perform in his cousin 's lounge .

  disclaimer that i have n't had a proper date yet , so take this as you will . 
  but i remember seeing a post along these lines a while back on here , and the top post suggested something like this :, 
  do n't say where you 're going , and if she asks what to wear just say something for spending a night with a guy you like or something ( maybe not as cheesy ) . 
  then you line three activities up - one casual , one slightly fancier and one formal , and which one you go to depends on what she 's wearing . 
  maybe like mini golf , a nice dinner or a museum opening thing , i dunno . 
  if you plan your wardrobe right you 'd be able to have an outfit which would n't look out of place at any of these , and then you 're making the night exactly what she imagined, 
  it 's getting to this point that 's my issue , i have no idea how to start conversations, 
  i was outside last night , real nice warm clear night and was looking at venus and jupiter when i noticed something moving across the sky . 
  got out my phone and checked , sure enough it was the international space station . 
  was awesome seeing it move across the sky and then slowly disappear as it entered the earth 's shadow , was really cool realising i got to watch the sun set on it, 
  if money is tight being a pilot might not be your best bet . 
  i looked at it a couple years back , iirc it 's something like 90k to go to flight school , which you 'd need if you wanted to become a commercial pilot . 
  just checked the iaanz website , cost seems to be $ 85,900 total , of which only $ 74,340 can be covered by a student loan . 
  ignoring the cost though , these are the requirements for the [ iaanz program ] ( http://www.flighttraining.co.nz ) ( might be different for others , i 'm pretty sure there 's one up in palmy ) :, 
   to be eligible for entry onto one of the academy courses you must be :, 
   * at least 18 years of age before the start date of your course, 
  * successfully complete the adapt trainee pilot pre-screening test ( score average or above ), 
  * ** hold ncea level 2 -- 14 credits in a language-rich subject ( such as , but not limited to , english , history , art history , geography , biology ) and 14 credits in a numbers-oriented subject ( such as , but not limited to , calculus , statistics , physics , chemistry , accounting ) or complete all ppl theory subject exams within a 42 day period **, 
  * hold an aviation class 1 medical certificate, 
  * meet the ` fit & proper person ' requirements of caanz . 
  * be competent in spoken english to meet caanz requirements . 
  generally this is having completed four years secondary schooling in a country where schooling activities have taken place in english or by attaining a level of ielts 5.5 in an english language test or its equivalent . 
   to complete the diploma -- airline prep course with the air new zealand multi crew course , additional criteria will be applied relating to entry criteria and continued inclusion in this course strand . 
  the additional criteria will include :, 
   * ** hold ncea level 3 certificate with -- min 14 credits in a english-rich subject ( english , history , art , geography , biology , classics , art history , journalism , media studies , religious studies , physical education ) and min 14 credits in a numbers-oriented subject ( such as , but not limited to , calculus , statistics , physics , chemistry , accounting ) , or have completed, 
  all ppl theory subject exams within a 42 day period or have a level 4 or higher trade certificate or equivalent **, 
  * english language as above but if not your first language then a minimum of iels 6.0 with no sub part ( reading , writing , listening or speaking ) below 6.0 or equivalent . 
  * an up-to date criminal convictions report showing a conviction free period of at least three years prior to the date on which training will commence , and no more than one conviction for drunk driving , and, 
  * an up-to date demerit points and suspension history report ( traffic offence history ) showing a maximum of 75 demerit points within the three years immediately prior to the course start date . 
  * hold nz citizenship or permanent residency, 
  * an interview to assess non-technical competencies, 
  * a simulator assessment to assess technical competencies, 
  so essentially you need to get ue with a bit more numeracy and literacy requirements in order to be considered, 
  but to become a commercial pilot would n't you need to graduate one of the tertiary institutes to be considered ? 
  maybe say it 's a surprise , and that whatever she wears will be fine ? 
  yeah , from an employment standpoint . 
  if he 's wanting to fly for an airline then i 'd assume ( hope ? ), 
  they 'd want a qualification from a tertiary institute first, 
  i do n't think it really counts as living through something if you die from it, 
  with a career spanning five decades , dave dobbyn has become an icon of new zealand music , for better or worse . 
  his song * loyal * came to be used as an anthem for new zealand 's america 's cup defense when held in auckland , and was summarily destroyed through overuse as a classic ` kiwi song ' . 
  th ' dudes was dobbyn 's first successful stint as a musician , which was followed by dd smash and a long solo career . 
  many of the songs he was involved in stand up on their own right , with bliss coming to play a large role in new zealand 's drinking culture and slice of heaven as much a piece of kiwiana as buzzy bee or l&p .
