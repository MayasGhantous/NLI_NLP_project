  if you can make one ramp you can make two , and then just drive over the top without damage to the suspension . 
  i 'm not arguing that it did n't kill her immediately , i 'm saying that she did n't live through it because she died of her injuries . 
  it 'd be like saying someone lived through the sinking of the titanic if they died of hypothermia after being picked up, 
  i have n't drunk enough yet to know them , unfortunately, 
   using your reasoning , if a 93 year old world war ii veteran died today from health complications after being wounded in normandy , we should go back and add him to the d-day casualty list . 
  how would that make sense ? 
  someone survives whatever happens to them until they 're dead . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  where 's the line drawn ? 
  a couple months after we had a [ 6.3 earthquake here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_christchurch_earthquake ) the death toll was risen by 4 , although i ca n't remember the exact reason but i 'm pretty sure it was because there were deaths which were a direct result of the quake that were counted or something . 
  oh , my last post was n't meant as a continuation of the argument but rather an actual question . 
  at what point is a death not counted as part of the death toll ? 
  sorry that it was n't clearer , i 'm genuinely curious, 
  i dunno , i kind of like some of his stuff, 
  * do n't let the sun in your heart decay ,, 
  it 's our last chance to forgive ourselves . 
  you and i must fight to survive ,, 
  and no-one knows who 's in control . 
  ( i know that underneath it 's me ) *, 
  * oh , and i 'm getting strong in every way *, 
  it does kind of sound like it , although i 'm not quite sure what 's going on . 
  new zealand here , we have both, 
  nah , but our pm is slightly less of a dickhead than yours, 
  i did n't even realise there was one at first , thought it was just part of the road that was half submerged . 
  perfect for people who steal photos without realising there 's one there . 
  today is tuesday the 12th of may . 
  on this day in 1949 the soviet union ended its blockade of berlin , ending the need for an airlift of supplies which had galvanised the western nations against the soviets . 
  also today , in 1968 australian forces ( supported by kiwi and american troops ) were attacked while defending fire support base coral in south vietnam by nva and vc forces , resulting in 25 australian deaths and 109 anzus injuries compared to 267 vietnamese deaths, 
  nesian mystik dominated the early 2000 's in new zealand music , winning dozens of awards and reaching at least gold status on all four of their albums ( their debut , * polysaturated , * reached 4x platinum . ), 
  the band saw members with heritage from all across polynesia , with samoan , tongan , cook islands and maori ancestry all present in the band .

  i work in a tech store ( not in the states though ) and this was really not okay . 
  couple of my coworkers were talking about doing it , one said he had , a manager overheard and fired him on the spot, 
  always open to suggestions , what is it ? 
  is brought to you by glorious soviet union , comrade . 
  oi / u/weathermannz , any idea what 's up with this hail here in chch ? 
  it was hail where i was , needed to run outside and put the car in the garage . 
  other parts of the city did n't get any though, 
  reminds me of a guy at work who bought steak from the supermarket next door and cooked it on the sandwich press in the break room . 
  seemed to work well enough, 
  does he get any say in the matter ? 
  * excellent *, 
  would there be any way to get images of the maps included so i know what they are ? 
  accidental renaissance , definitely . 
  i love that place, 
  wait , do people each have one ? 
  i thought it was just random for each post ? 
  i 'm guessing the would you rather askreddit thread, 
  wait , * what * are you doing to the prostitutes ? 
  i do , i 'm really not looking forward to self-driving cars . 
  might be an unpopular opinion here , but i 'd rather have a slightly outdated car and still be able to drive than to just sit there and do nothing . 
  if i did n't want to drive , i 'd take a taxi . 
  * and presenting our tame racing driver ... 
  the stag *, 
  who * would n't * want to see one of those driving a ferrari around the track ? 
  i 've never seen anyone so happy to be put out of a job, 
  hey , do n't blame me . 
  / u/appexxd has missed his shift about three times in a row now, 
  really sorry it 's so late , i forgot about posting one today . 
  i 've just gone with a band i 'm familiar with so that it 's reasonably quick , normal submissions will resume tomorrow . 
  during their brief stint of activity , midnight youth were able to release two albums and feature at many new zealand musical events as well as their music being used in commercials .
