  it would depend on the magnitude most likely , a bigger earthquake would mean more severe shaking which would be easier to see . 
  what would be more pronounced would be the effect the earthquake has . 
  even if buildings do n't get destroyed , there are plenty of videos of skyscapers in japan swaying as a result of earthquakes , and trees would do a similar thing . 
  if you were n't aware it would probably look more like just strong wind . 
  effects of building destruction would also be visible during , but mainly after the quake . 
  [ this ] ( http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1328918431/158/6403158.jpg ) is a photo taken just after a 6.3 magnitude earthquake hit my hometown , christchurch , in february 2011 . 
  the dust cloud covering most of the cbd is a result of many of the buildings there being damaged or destroyed , so you 'd definitely see that at least, 
  pleased you 're so open-minded about it, 
  what exactly is it about them that you 're so opposed to ? 
  my comment was sarcastic , given he 's not willing to even give them a listen before saying how rubbish they are, 
  saying `` not even once '' would imply otherwise,

  today is thursday the 14th of may . 
  on this day in 1870 the first official game of rugby was played in new zealand , between nelson college and the nelson football club . 
  each team had 18 players , and the end result was a 2-0 win for the nelson football club . 
  today 's fact was brought to you by vice-admiral the right honourable horatio lord nelson , 1st viscount nelson . 
  cut a grape in half and microwave that , they 're pretty fun . 
  or stick a candle in with a glass over top of it, 
  another mainstay of the new zealand reggae scene , the black seeds are the authors of many iconic nz summer songs . 
  they have gained attention internationally as well as domestically , with * one by one * being featured in an early breaking bad episode . 
  they gained widespread attention in the early 2000 's with their 2003 album * on the sun , * which along with their 2005 album * into the dojo * was certified 2x platinum within new zealand . 
  many current and former band members also played in other new zealand bands , including fat freddy 's drop , fly my pretties and even flight of the conchords .

  nothing , but if you have the whole show featuring it as a main theme it may end up sounding a lot like tumblr wrote it, 
  pretty much what / u/akintudne said to the other guy , it 's not a problem if it 's part of the show . 
  but if the whole show centers around it and has it as pretty much the only focus it 'd be tiresome after a while, 
  according to legend , rugby * did * evolve out of football when a guy at rugby college got sick of kicking the ball , picked it up and ran with it, 
  pretty sure it 's already been mentioned that she becomes killer frost by the end of the season, 
  that 'd confuse people , if ra 's showed up again as vandal savage, 
  a pioneer band of reggae within the pacific , herbs had a significant political aspect to their music for much of their career . 
  french letter , along with * nuclear waste * , were protest songs written in opposition to french nuclear testing in the south pacific , while * whats be happen * featured allusions to the bastion point protests and was released in the midst of the 1981 springbok tour .

  if i 'm allowed to blow my own trumpet a bit , i also recommend the polynesian civ pack if you have the dlc . 
  polynesia is such a horrible clumping of all the different polynesian groups that i had to split it up into different groups, 
  often a sticking point between new zealand and australia , the nationality of crowded house is as hotly contested as pharlap and pavlova ( which , of course , are both kiwi . ), 
  crowded house are one of the most iconic new zealand bands , with both tim and neil finn being bestowed an obe by queen elizabeth ii for their contributions to the music of new zealand .
