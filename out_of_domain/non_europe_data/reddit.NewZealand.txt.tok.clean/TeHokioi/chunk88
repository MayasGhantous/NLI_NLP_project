  the show formerly known as top gear ? 
  was n't that where the fridge was in the series ? 
  or whatever that building that [ ward infiltrated during the hydra takeover ] ( / spoiler ) was ? 
  do n't forget to add in the value from having had bb king play it, 
  yeah , all i remember is that i 'm pretty sure the building in shield was called the fridge and it was on the shore in a desert , like dubai or somewhere, 
  i did the base code for it , there 's about ten other guys who worked on various parts of it too . 
  / u/janboruta did the art , and / u/sukritact and / u/jessefrederickdaly did most of the lua for it, 
  pity , you 're missing out on a live stream of u2 's concert, 
  it 's nothing that special , almost a bit disappointed given the rumours beforehand . 
  no rare songs or anything , pretty much the classics ( pride , beautiful day etc ) and some new songs . 
  no acrobat , no lemon , nothing off zooropa or pop at all : / ~ ~ not even bad ~ ~, 
  edit : scratch that , bad 's playing :d, 
  still nowhere near what i 'd want in my ideal show . 
  just play half of zooropa ( the album , not the song ) and i 'm happy, 
  it was night 2 in vancouver , they just finished . 
  had to keep switching between two or three streams though , apparently live streaming for hours kills battery life . 
  ca n't wait for songs of experience to be released though , hopefully we 'll be able to get a bit more of the achtung baby sound back, 
  we have a joke about it on the nz subreddit about how when mods turn green we know shits getting real, 
  the [ nasa ones ] ( http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/exoplanet_travel_bureau ) are pretty cool too, 
  during their five year stint of activity in the first half of the 2000 's , goodshirt enjoyed reasonable popularity within new zealand , with many of their singles receiving regular playtime and a presence in the charts .

  in my defense i did this in like five minutes when i realised i forgot to do it , did n't really have time to go through their songs like usual, 
  seems our maori name has been sponsored by eta too, 
  there were obvious choices of song for the exponents , both from their current form and from when they were the `` dance exponents '' . 
  however , * victoria * has been cursed with hold music placement and * why does love do this to me * is in the same boat as slice of heaven in terms of overuse . 
  whatever happened to tracey was a slightly less well known song , which i 've chosen to provide a bit of variety to the lineup .

  depends where you are, 
  today is monday the 18th of may . 
  on this day in 1756 and in 1803 the united kingdom declared war on france . 
  today 's fact is brought to you by grudge matches, 
  we 've actually suspended all flights to and from the states in response to their pro-garden agenda . 
  the only way you 'd be able to maybe get into the country is if you make your way around the pacific rim , and then jetski or kayak across the tasman or something . 
  just make sure you do n't have any garden supplies with you or you 'll be sent to hamilton ( our version of gitmo , only worse ), 
  trying to smuggle gardening equipment into the country is reason enough , surely !, 
  his story about being american checks out , guys, 
  was n't is born out of the conflict in syria though ? 
  if that had ended quicker , there would have been less of a base for is to build on, 
  what time do you close ? 
  i 've got a meeting at six , so might come in around then . 
  eh , i 've got a shitload of stuff to do . 
  three essays and four exams within the next month, 
  why is that unfortunate ? 
  i have to be in my meeting at six, 
  felt a bit rushed , but had some awesome jokes in it . 
  * `` if mommy 's purse was n't meant to go in the microwave then why did it fit ? 
  oh please , he ca n't even handle a single shift, 
  can you take over his shift ? 
  or maybe that guy we ran out of town ?
