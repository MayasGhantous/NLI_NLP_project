  sorry i did n't end up stopping by , was watching the mad men finale, 
  guy who created it was bill backer , which kind of sounds similar to don draper too, 
  wait , so what if everyone has the same name ? 
  i just played a game with six tydes in it, 
  yep , every second day starting with tomorrow, 
  it 's fairly big on diameter , since that 's what kiwi ( and aussie ) humour is like, 
  speaking of flairs , any chance i could get an i-site one since i 'm always posting way too much info for people looking for travel advice ? 
  god , imagine if they came out with `` auckland jaffa flavour '' as one of the flavours . 
  lawsuits from cadbury aside it would be amazing, 
  5 comments , but only four are visible . 
  seems someone 's been shadowbanned, 
  nope , not you, 
  nope , still not you, 
  it 's where the admins ban you , but you have no idea about it . 
  you can still post and see your posts as normal , but no-one else can , so you have no idea, 
  i think so , at least that 's what i 've heard, 
  yeah , there was a story on / r/tifu a couple weeks back of a guy who had been posting for three years before finding out he was shadowbanned . 
  normally it 's used for spam bots or people who break the core rules of reddit ( like giving away identities or whatever ),

  the warratahs are one of the greatest country bands to come out of new zealand , hailing from wellington . 
  many of their songs feature new zealand locations , including akautangi way ( an instrumental named after a street in hataitai ) and taranaki , talking about meeting someone ` south of the mountain ' and the protagonist 's childhood in the region . 
  arguably their most widely known song is one which was commissioned by the interislander for use in their commercials , with the resulting song ( sailing to the other side ) still used in some form on their commercials today .

  bloody hell , first day on the job and you 're late ? 
  if being a u2 fan has taught me anything it 's that other people are n't going to have the same tastes , and getting worked up about that will just make it miserable, 
  what i do n't get is how people do n't separate the band and its music . 
  like , from all accounts kings of leon are dicks , but i still listen to their music because i like it regardless of what they did, 
  anyone else keen to start up a new news website ? 
  i was going to guess timaru because of the socks in the mall thing, 
  so we 've established that one horse is equal to anywhere from two to fifteen horses . 
  okay . 
  if 50 people show up and someone wants to contribute money then yeah, 
  gah , any time between now and about the 26th of june i 'm out , it 's the end of term so there 's a bunch of assignments due , and then most of june is exam season for uc, 
  god no , went there once , waited an hour in line to be stood up . 
  0/10 would never visit again, 
  can confirm , ran a stock exchange on the playground . 
  went bust when people overinvested in lollipops and lost all the balls in the recession, 
  based in west africa , near modern day ghana , the ashanti empire was a powerful state which constantly proved a staunch opponent to european colonisation of the region . 
  the empire ( or kingdom ) grew out of the smaller state of kumasi and grew to encompass much of the region , stretching from ghana to the ivory coast . 
  despite being relatively near the coast , it was over thirty years before the ashanti gained access to a coastal city , which allowed them to grow rich off trade with europe . 
  however , it was the military prowess of the ashanti which came to be most widely known , with organisational techniques and military doctrine leading the ashanti to become a formidable fighting force unified behind the ashanti throne , known as the golden stool . 
  the ashanti - osei tutu, 
  * the golden stool * - gain golden stool points ( gsp ) whenever a city is conquered or converted to your religion or when a great person is expended .

  weaker than spearmen , but 2 drumroll warriors are produced at the same time . 
  generates +1 golden stool point for every experience point earned . 
  unique unit : abrade , replaces the rifleman . 
  increased bonus against wounded units . 
  receives two extra moves for the first turn after being produced or purchased .

  they 're priced the same as the spearman, 
  xp is a 1:1 ratio , not sure about the others ( you 'd need to ask / u/sukritact ) from my experience i think it 's 80 gsp for expending a gp and for capturing a city , but do n't quote me on that, 
  now known as blacklistt , blindspott were a band from waitakere which gained popularity in the early 2000 's . 
  their music saw experimentation in genres as diverse as reggae and metal , leading their first two albums to both reach platinum certification . 
  their singles however did not chart as well , with * phlex * the only single to achieve certification .
