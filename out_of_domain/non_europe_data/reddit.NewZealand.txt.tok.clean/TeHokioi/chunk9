  you ca n't walk to turkmenistan !, 
  not usually . 
  maybe once every two months i ca n't sleep properly , but for the most part i sleep straight through, 
  can sleep apnea be hereditary ? 
  my father was recently diagnosed with it, 
  i agree with you entirely , but how i took / u/hallgod33 's post is that doing something like what they are should n't have to be religious in nature . 
  respecting other beliefs and their right to practice them should be ( and is ) a basic human principle . 
  it 's like what voltiare said , `` i do not agree with what you say , but i will defend to the death your right to say it '' . 
  regardless of your beliefs , be you christian , muslim , atheist , whatever , you should be doing what those in the photo are doing , and protecting the right of others to believe whatever the hell they want . 
  a person should n't need to be religious in order to realise that . 
  i prefer to be able to say `` i am protecting these people and their beliefs because it is the right thing to do '' than `` i am protecting these people and their beliefs because if i do n't i spend eternity in hell '', 
  i am sure that , in the same circumstances , i would be standing alongside those protecting the people who are exercising their right to practice their religion . 
  i am not motivated by any religion , but rather basic human decency . 
  i respect that they have differing beliefs from my own , and i would wish to help protect them from those who are less accommodating . 
  i would also hope many of those here would do the same . 
  i 'd suggest asking / r/futurewhatif - seems like their sort of question . 
  in order to answer your question , there are a lot of variables . 
  the tl ; dr of it is that there are n't really any countries in africa capable of being a superpower at this rate in the 21st century . 
  namibia , south africa and egypt are often thrown around as being the regional superpowers , but as of yet none are in a position to exert their power on a global scale . 
  now , the first world country part is a bit different . 
  kenya has what is called [ vision 2030 ] ( http://www.vision2030.go.ke/ ) , which is their goal to be a developed ` first world ' country by the year 2030 . 
  they also just discovered vast freshwater reserves , so they do n't face water shortages any time soon either . 
  chinese funded development is also continuing all over africa , even in the democratic republic of the congo , so infrastructure level is n't necessarily an indicator of development in these cases . 
  i would post more but i 'm short on time at the moment, 
  there 's some pretty awesome street art here - i went down the other day to take some photos . 
  this one is dad 's , not mine , but i could upload an album here if you guys want, 
  not even rescued , only two made it out alive . 
  when it happened , i remember them saying that there were three more behind them , but no-one else made it ... 
  i 've had a rough year with this sort of thing , this post is just what i needed . 
  thanks , i wish you both the best !, 
  relevant username, 
  kiwi here , glad to see you 're including nz too . 
  what sort of trip are you wanting ? 
  there is n't really any public transport outside of the big cities here , so you 'd probably want to either rent a car or a small campervan ( there are some two-sleeper ones that would be small enough ) . 
  the bog-standard kiwi tiki tour would probably be flying into christchurch ( ex-auckland ) , renting one camper , then going queenstown - te anau/milford sound - west coast , then either back over arthur 's pass to christchurch or up to nelson and the awesome beaches of abel tasman national park . 
  what you do next would depend on if you 're able to get a campervan to relocate ( sometimes , you can rent the campervan in , say , christchurch and drop it off in auckland ) or if you have to drop it off in the same place . 
  depending on your budget , you have about three options ( assuming you want to do the north island too ) :, 
  drop campervan off in christchurch , fly to auckland and rent another one, 
  drive campervan to picton , cross on ferry and do north island in same vehicle, 
  drop campervan off in christchurch , take coastal pacific train to picton and board ferry as a pedestrian , rent second campervan in wellington, 
  now personally , with the exception of wellington which is my single favourite city in the world ( closely followed by tokyo ) , the bottom half of the north island is n't that interesting imo . 
  i 'd recommend going on state highway 1 up to the desert road and taupo , through to the rest of the taupo volcanic zone ( including rotorua and all that jazz ) . 
  white island is pretty cool too if you 're into walking on active volcanoes . 
  te puke ( not pronounced how you 're reading it , most likely ) is a very touristy town centered on the kiwifruit industry , but nearby are quite a few laid back beach towns that are good for not much but a dose of nostalgia . 
  further up you have the coromandel peninsula , which is probably better for laid back beach towns . 
  there 's hot water beach here , where you can take a shovel and dig yourself a hot spring ( there are geothermal fissures nearby , digging in between tides allows hot water to come up ) . 
  after the coromandel you 're on to auckland and northland ( do n't bother with the rest of the waikato , hamiltron is only sarcastic ) personally i 've never been to northland , but it 's fairly high up my list . 
  if you can find it , the kiwi show * north * was about the area , and would give an idea of what is up there . 
  i remember one multiplayer game a while ago , where it was me and a mate with two strangers . 
  turns out one of the strangers was building it too . 
  he ragequit , the other stranger starts ranting about the guy leaving . 
  i then built the hanging gardens , and the second stranger ragequits, 
  single archer can defeat most early armies, 
  seems like the right place . 
  i 'm so much of a wonderwhore , there just simply were n't enough wonders in the game for me to get my fix . 
  even with ambrox62 's wonders , i still craved more . 
  i began small , and then ramped up to one a week . 
  by the time i was half way through , i was beginning games and building nothing but wonders in my capital from the beginning of the game until the renaissance . 
  deserts rose before my eyes to foster the greatest cities the world has ever seen , with great buildings of stone - each more magnificent than the last . 
  i was building wondrous monuments honouring the gods that reached up to touch the very fabric of the heavens . 
  most early armies . 
  not all . 
  also some stuff like calculus , piracy ( to split up uber-powerful navigation ) and some of the other techs from the 1492 scenario would help flesh it out a bit . 
  you could have a bigger development of gunpowder beyond just a tech and `` oh , cool . 
  i can build guns now . '', 
  have saltpetre as a resource , which you then have to convert into gunpowder with a building before you can build early gunpowder units, 
  `` should not be involved in regulating marriage , yet limits it to one man one woman ? 
  i * love * his logic . '', 
  a battle against bigotry . 
  i like this . 
  christchurch here , no rain yet . 
  sitting here in shorts with cicadas blaring through the open window, 
  edit : damnit this is my fault, 
  it 's that time of month again , huh ? 
  and in australian, 
  hey , do n't be so aladeen, 
  but wait , there 's more !, 
  call within the next 10 minutes and we 'll throw in a second set , * absolutely free !, 
  * that 's not * one * , but *** two *** complete sets , for the * low * price of just ** $ 19.95 ** !, 
  a true kiwi use for the safe , good job . 
  needs more speights though , and maybe a bit of monteiths for good measure . 
  also , you should line up bottles under that `` priorities '' writing on the wall , show yourself what to drink, 
  oh god . 
  i 'm in the south , it 's still good here . 
  new zealand : do n't say we 're australia, 
  well , i 'm glad the nsa released his wife and kids ... 
  reminds me more of [ shin-saibashi in osaka ] ( http://www.vodkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/d72_2827.jpg ), 
  that planet is going to have a very bad day, 
  unknown author of the street art , which is located just outside the restart container mall in christchurch , new zealand . 
  part of a larger piece featuring a poem ( which can be viewed [ here ] ( http://www.christchurchdailyphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dsc02256.jpg ) ) , which is in turn part of the poetica urban poetry street art exhibition, 
  that one was taken with my dad 's nikon d700 dslr , although i usually use a sony nex 5-n ( just got the nex-6 :d ), 
  hey , we saw the safe open . 
  anything 's possible, 
  i think this is a case of gameplay vs realism . 
  it would be stupid to have your fleet be able to sale from alexandria to britain in one turn ( which would be the case even with 4 turns per year if we go by this ) , so ca needed to limit movement at the expense of realism . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1tkcz1/the_safe_some_people_doubted_our_resolve_but_i/ ), 
  it completely depends on what game you want to mod , and what you want to do as your mod . 
  i 'll speak for civilization v , since that 's what i mod . 
  the civilization franchise is known for a large modding community , and some of the people who are involved in making the game began as modders for earlier versions . 
  as such , civ 5 has paid special attention to mods , and comes with an sdk ( a set of tools which help make modding easier ) .
