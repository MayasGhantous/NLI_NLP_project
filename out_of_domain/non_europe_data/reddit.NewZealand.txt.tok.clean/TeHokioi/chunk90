  morning all !, 
  today is wednesday the 20th of may . 
  in natural disaster news , on this day in 526 approximately 250,000 people die in an earthquake in modern day syria , near the turkish border , while in 1883 krakatoa begins to erupt in an event which would ultimately kill over 36,000 . 
  in lighter news , in 1498 vasco de gama arrives in india , becoming the first european to arrive by sea and opening up the continent to european incursion , and in 1896 a six-ton chandelier falls onto a crowd in new york , killing one . 
  in aviation news , on this day in 1927 charles lindbergh set off on his solo trans-atlantic flight , the first of its kind . 
  five years later , amelia earhart would become the first woman to do the same . 
  today 's facts were brought to you by a university education, 
  it 's okay arnie , you 're allowed to swear on the internet, 
  workshop is the same . 
  try to click a category and half the time it 'll say `` no results found '' and you have to try and reshuffle and reload until they show up, 
  kind of looks like he should be in a bond film, 
  as a new zealander , thank you for trying to stop the tpp, 
  different flight - earhart succeeded in this one , it was her later flight around the world that she disappeared on, 
  some of it is n't that bad . 
  stuff like the amazing race where you actually get to see a bunch of places and it focuses on that for a bit is okay , or the block where they actually have to do something . 
  but the ones where they 're just glorified talent shows or psychology experiments are horrible, 
  * burning down your school ? 
  that 's a paddlin ' *, 
  hey , thanks !, 
  just released [ a new one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/36iuwe/after_months_of_no_progress_more_civs_finally/ ) this morning even !, 
  pfft , i have like 2500 hours on it . 
  you should play more , and get bnw if you do n't have it - completely changes the game for the better, 
  yeah , both of them and about ten others . 
  full list can be found on the cfc page, 
  jeez , pick up your game wellington, 
  and it 's all karmanaut, 
  just found out the 2500 word essay i need to write by tomorrow actually only needs to be 2000 words . 
  it 's amazing how much of a relief that is, 
  also known as new zealand shapeshifter to differentiate them from international acts , shapeshifter are a popular drum and bass group who formed alongside other new zealand acts through their tours . 
  they have played at many international festivals and tours , with performances at glastonbury and the big day out , as well as sold out tours across europe and australasia .

  you 're still way off the mark . 
  not only have these ruins ( and other monuments , like the buddhas of bamiyan ) stood in predominantly muslim areas for thousands of years without being damaged , but other religiously motivated groups have done just as barbaric acts . 
  christians destroyed templo mayor in tenochtitlan and the great library of alexandria . 
  while you 're right in claiming these people are doing so because they 're under the belief that it is their divine mission to do so , you 're painting extremely broad strokes by claiming that it 's solely the fault of islam , and is about as bad and incorrect as saying that all atheists are literally stalin . 
  lots of innocent people are probably going to die anyway, 
  not bad , but i kind of like the pohutukawa more personally . 
  blue and white seems a bit cold for the climate, 
  people who want a new flag tend to want less union jack , not more . 
  not that i do n't like these flags though, 
  my discus needs to stay in the water , if it dies i 've wasted $ 150, 
  like that poor guy who organised the / r/oman meet, 
  not if i have to bring my discus, 
  i might come , will depend on how the next couple weeks go uni-wise, 
   former tvnz news boss and media commentator bill ralston said while campbell live ratings had been up in recent weeks , it was the wrong audience for tv3 . 
   `` they wanted another kind of viewer that would keep watching all the reality shows that would run afterwards , and that did n't happen . '', 
   he expected the show would be replaced with something `` light and frothy '' that could compete with seven sharp on tvnz . 
  from [ stuff 's article ] ( http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/68739990/john-campbell-to-leave-tv3.html ) , kind of worrying given the sorry state of current affairs in nz to begin with, 
  it 'll depend on where it is and all that , i 've got no transport if i 'm drinking , and i 'm more than likely going to need a drink, 
  volstead 's probably a bit far , i dunno . 
  will think about it . 
  holy shit , winnie 's on the warpath . 
  calling the nat 's nazis , shouting `` your day of reckoning is coming '' across parliament, 
   mediaworks never intended any other outcome . 
  according to the campbell live fb page , john was offered a 3 year contract last year , but only one of them was on campbell live . 
  this is n't a new issue, 
  we now have a direct financial conversion to weight,
