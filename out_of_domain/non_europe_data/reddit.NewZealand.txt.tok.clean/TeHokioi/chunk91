  following a long career as part of the band salmonella dub , tiki taane pursued a solo career . 
  his music is typically acoustic , although in some instances blends traditional maori themes and instruments with modern dub and electronic music to create a unique sound . 
  his single , * always on my mind , * became the best selling single of all time in new zealand , while his song * freedom to sing * was written in response to his arrest for performing a cover of an nwa song , which was seen as `` disorderly behaviour likely to cause violence to start or continue . '',

  were you flying in on a u-2 or something ? 
  i 'm sorry , i had an essay due today that i had 300 words on as of this morning and 1700 to write . 
  somehow i got it done by 12 , but then i was in a lecture, 
  baz opens , scores 80 off 30 then gets out , at which point he realises that he 's supposed to be playing test cricket, 
  [ are mods okay ?

  i always feel like i 'm the only person here who actually enjoys driving for the purpose of it . 
  everyone acts like self-driving cars are the best thing ever , and ca n't wait to get one , while i 'm just wanting to be able to actually drive my own car . 
  and what a damn fine sky it is . 
  wo n't get nearly as many stars in a lot of other places around the world , at least not without driving for days . 
  a polarising artist , gin wigmore 's iconic style of music has given her increasing recognition in the states and worldwide through both the albums themselves and the use of the music in tv shows and advertising . 
  * man like that * was used as the soundtrack for a james bond themed heineken ad to coincide with the release of skyfall , with gin herself performing , while * under my skin * was used in an air new zealand in flight safety video . 
  additionally , this post is likely going to have a response of ` shut up gin wigmore ' due to a facebook rant which she made in response to a detractor earlier this year .

  this would be so cool . 
  i 've always wanted to buy some farmland next to the state highway and turn it into a native forest , but that 'd require me to be filthy rich, 
  at least on diameter , it also seems to have the added effect of freezing the game each time you tag with it , not sure about capping though, 
  i finally have a cameo in a gif !, 
  good morning !,
