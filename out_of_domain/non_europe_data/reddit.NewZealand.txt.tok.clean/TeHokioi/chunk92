  what are you trying to say ? 
  clobberin ' people, 
  and then take a screenshot of it and post that ? 
  i wonder how long we can keep it going for ? 
  australia , the hamilton of the western world . 
  nice try, 
  nah , i was meaning the whole gay marriage reminding you of me thing, 
  ... that makes more sense, 
  404 pls, 
  heading into the last week now , and i 'm running out of ideas . 
  i 've lost track of suggestions , so if anyone has any ideas and has links to four or so songs please let me know so i can include them . 
  i 'm sorry about choosing dominion road , i was going to go for * anchor me * but decided that an upbeat song would be better this morning . 
  the mutton birds also have about half of their successful songs as covers ( do n't fear the reaper for a peter jackson film and nature just because ) which makes it difficult too .

  people exaggerate the weather in wellington a bit . 
  i used to live on the south coast and absolutely loved it there - i remember dad waking me up in the morning and taking me outside , could see the milky way damn near perfect and hear the lions at the zoo . 
  as long as you 're not on a south-facing property you 'd be fine ( where i lived was in a little side valley , we were sheltered from the southerly ) . 
  i 'm not sure about house prices , but down around that area could be worth a look too - decent school and community , easy access to the bus network and in summer you can walk down to lyall bay to go for a swim / surf , or head over to island bay and have fish and chips on the beach with a view of the south island . 
  wait , snowing in napier ? 
  you sure you did n't accidentally move to naseby ? 
  i need probably about four more tracks and a description to be able to post it , if you have any, 
  i 've already covered the phoenix foundation on the 9th , some other good ones in there too , thanks, 
  given i 've never heard of 8 foot sativa before , that 'd probably be why i have n't done them yet . 
  covered dave dobbyn alongside th ' dudes , seemed a bit weird to have him on three different days - th ' dudes , dd smash and as a solo act . 
  might do bic runga at some point too , different from the other stuff so far, 
  i do n't think the ferry counts as wasting a day , especially if you 've never done it before, 
  as long as they do n't do the hairdryer one , i 'm fine with it, 
  i 've only been able to find a couple weta songs on youtube , you able to help out a bit ? 
  yeah , that 's only one . 
  i need at least three more , preferably four or five , to make a post, 
  if you can , that 'd be awesome , thanks, 
  to be fair , geographically they 're pretty damn close, 
  it 's all hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy, 
  please , no . 
  constant leadership changes cost labour last time , do n't want it to happen again . 
  two more years are bad enough , let alone five, 
  fuck i hate new zealand voters sometimes . 
  i 'm not doubting that , i 'm just saying that five ( six ? ), 
  leadership changes in four years is n't really a good look, 
  i reckon it 's because they 're essentially two parties rolled into one - the ` proper ' labour working class party is in charge now , leaving the social democrats out of it . 
  mainly that after so much shit this government 's pulled they 're still so far out in front . 
  just venting frustration more than anything , really, 
  originally from auckland , the naked and famous have received relative success on the world stage as an indie electronic band , gaining attention in the united states and elsewhere . 
  their single * young blood * debuted at # 1 on the nz charts when it was released , since which point they have continued to get success in the charts for their singles .
