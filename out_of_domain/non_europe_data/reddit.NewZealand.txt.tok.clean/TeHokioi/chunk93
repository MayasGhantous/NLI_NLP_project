  today is tuesday the 26th of may . 
  on this day in 1897 bram stoker published * dracula *, 
  404 pls, 
  it would be really funny if , instead of boosting ratings , they dropped so significantly across the board that it prompted a review for everything else . 
   and better yet , imply that you 'll replace it with your own take on seven sharp . 
  potentially hosted by paul henry , no less . 
  was in the herald article , where they actually did reporting instead of repeating the mediaworks press release . 
  did sound kind of like a rumour though, 
  if a sandwich has its contents on the box i expect it to have that as the contents . 
  i wanted ham and cheese , not ham , cheese and mustard . 
  if i wanted ham , cheese and mustard i would have bought a fucking ham , cheese and mustard sandwich . 
  opshop are a reasonably long running rock band from auckland , having formed in 2002 . 
  they gained widespread success with the release of their second album , * second hand planet , * in 2007 . 
  the album 's lead single , * maybe , * made them the first nz artist to reach the top of the itunes new zealand charts , beating out large international acts in the process . 
  they told reporters they were ` taking a break ' in 2013 , whether they will return remains to be seen . 
  the founder of the band , jason kerrison , was inducted into the nz order of merit for services to music in 2011 .

  must have missed that bit happening , what was the story about the whole going crazy thing ? 
  democracy is so overrated, 
  he stands up hand on heart in the middle of the day and sings * god save the queen * to the portrait at full volume . 
  planning a flying nun / dunedin sound megathread at some point , although i do n't know enough about it to give it the coverage it deserves, 
  i was going to do big energy in little spaces , but could n't find a music video for it ( just the album cover with audio ) so i went with this instead since it was closest, 
  i might be able to come , might not . 
  we 've got family friends coming around , but i 'm normally being antisocial anyway so might be able to duck out for a bit . 
  although it 's a couple days before two exams in a row , so i dunno . 
  what time are you going to be there until ? 
  okay , sweet . 
  they 've got a couple young kids , so definitely wo n't be here that late . 
  what 's the transport situation like ? 
  i do n't use public transport much , but have no other way of getting there if i 'm going to be drinking, 
  over in avonhead , about halfway between westfields and the airport . 
  pretty sure there 's a bus that runs from around the corner to riccarton road , just was n't sure what it 's like in the wee hours, 
  nah , better to ask him about it every day, 
  this many must be equivalent to about genocide or something , surely ? 
  what 's the indoor-fantail to death conversion rate ? 
  possibly one of the few decent things to come out of hamilton , katchafire are a prominent nz reggae band ( and the last one to feature in the nz music month series . ), 
  while still influenced by dub and similar genres like other nz reggae bands , katchafire is more influenced by proper reggae and a certain illegal substance , which features prominently in their music . 
  they have been active since 1997 , and continue to perform and debut new music to this day , most recently releasing a compilation album in 2013 .
