  good morning everyone , and welcome to thursday the 28th of may . 
  on this day in 1588 , the spanish armada ( consisting of 130 ships and 30,000 men ) set sail towards england . 
  it was later decisively destroyed by the english , thwarting spanish invasion attempts . 
  also today , in 1905 the battle of tsushima took place . 
  in this , the entire russian baltic fleet , having sailed from the baltic around europe and africa and across the indian ocean , all the way to japan , was annihilated in 45 minutes by the japanese . 
  also today , the first isle of man tt was held in 1907 , in 1937 volkswagen was founded and the golden gate bridge was opened . 
  happy 97th birthday to both azerbaijan and armenia , who both declared independence on this day in 1918, 
  terrible naval commanders and a desire for self-rule, 
  are you oliver queen ? 
  holy shit , $ 12 for a 14km taxi fare ? 
  1/3 of that costs probably close to $ 50 in chch, 
  seems like the last run is just past midnight , so that should be fine . 
  worst case scenario i just take a taxi or something, 
  yeah , although nero kind of ruined his name for everyone . 
  not definite , but more likely than it was - was able to shift the dinner to the night after, 
  i got to the bit where it said ` superman ' and realised it was n't real , saw your comment , went back to read it and realised it was ` spiderman ' instead . 
  i realised it was wrong by reading it incorrectly, 
  where i live got hit by a reasonably big earthquake a couple years back ( 7.1 magnitude . ), 
  what people do n't realise is how loud they are , it 's like a freight train driving down your hallway , and that 's without the sound of everything loose in your house shaking too, 
  i dunno , i 'm kind of glad the lhc is n't going to open a wormhole, 
  maybe it already is , and that 's why it 's only ok ? 
  i 'm at home all day trying to write 2000 words by 5 . 
  time to crank up the heat pumps :d, 
  shameless self-plug , but the mughals have a giant cannon uu that needs to be pulled by a couple elephants . 
  it 's stupidly powerful , but ca n't move unless it 's at full health and is fairly easily destroyed if you let melee units get at it, 
  that depends , how good are you at talking about socio-economic issues facing britain in the wake of the election with regards to european integration and the rise of scottish nationalism ? 
  `` i do n't want one , i 'll just have a bite of yours '', 
  technically , it 's got a politics code but it 's actually a european studies paper . 
  democratic and economic evolution of europe or something, 
  minuit were an electronic band from nelson , who existed from 1998 to 2014 . 
  they gained recognition beyond normal means with the inclusion of their music in the game * gripshift , * while other tracks have been featured in american tv shows bones and grey 's anatomy . 
  * aotearoa * was also used in tvnz waitangi day coverage and on the heartland channel . 
  beyond this , they toured regularly throughout new zealand and europe , as well as continuously releasing new content through the length of their period of activity .

  yeah , i 'll see what i can do . 
  managed to move the family friends coming over to the night after , so that 's not as much of an issue . 
  could always get a taxi part of the way and walk the rest , if it 's too expensive . 
  worst case scenario i just spend about an hour walking home , sure as hell not biking after drinking ( hell , ca n't even remember the last time i biked somewhere ),
