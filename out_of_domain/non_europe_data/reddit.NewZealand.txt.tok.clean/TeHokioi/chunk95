  damned if i know , probably people who think that their music taste is superior and anything else is rubbish who no-one should listen to, 
  that depends , are you in a lecture right now ? 
  holy shit , okay . 
  finished your essay ? 
  managed to fuck up , i 've only got like 300 words . 
  trying to write a paragraph now, 
  dammit 404 , even / u/appexxd would have done better than this, 
  have fun on your date !, 
  because you go on about it enough that i just assumed that 's what all your plans are , i guess ? 
  nah , just messing with you . 
  it was pretty much a complete guess given that it 's pretty much the only thing i know about you ( other than the whole family from hell thing , and your plans probably are n't running away since you 're so stubborn ), 
  i think the only thing to say at this point is ka kite ano and a very good evening indeed . 
  had to stop myself from bursting into tears at the end of the episode, 
  seconded . 
  all in favour ? 
  mods , why is there no john campbell flair ? 
  the motion carries . 
  you should , we need to have a flair for the first knight of / r/newzealand . 
  i 've also been trying to get an i-site flair since i give way too detailed responses to people asking for travel advice, 
  he already got most of his anger out in his op-ed in the civilian, 
  imagine if the three / four biggest parties were all centrist ... 
  i bet he had one typed up for each of the different leaders , then just clicked the right one when he heard who it was and posted it, 
   2011 rugby world cup, 
   nz v tonga : september 9 , tv one , 1,015,200, 
   nz v france : october 23 , tv one , 687,200, 
  why was the game vs tonga so much more popular than the final ? 
  ( or is that the first time we played france ? ), 
  sorry for posting it so late , was feeling shit this morning and then had to go to work . 
  since today is the second to last day , instead of focusing on just one group it 'll be a thread for any of the bands under flying nun records , or other dunedin sound songs ( was n't sure if chris knox counts as dunedin sound , so i went with flying nun to be safe . ), 
  feel free to post other songs from the label / genre , there 's bound to be a bunch i 've missed, 
  flying nun records is an independent music label from new zealand , and after being founded quickly became associated with the so-called ` dunedin sound ' genre of pop / punk / rock / whatever coming out of dunedin in the 80 's . 
  the label was for a period in the 2000 's wholly owned by warner music group , however the label 's founder bought it back in 2009 with help from neil finn and others . 
  over the label 's history it has seen dozens of bands and artists which have since become part of kiwi culture , and has become an integral part of the kiwi music scene .

  just something i thought of , maybe the figure does n't take into account everyone going down to bars / fan zones for the final ? 
  can we have something for lose streaks so i 'd have a flair i can get too ? 
  i grew up in nz too and i 've never come across them . 
  i mean , sure , you see a guy with patches every now and then , but never a full on group of them . 
  guess it just depends on where in the country you are , stay out of whanganui and you 're fine, 
  no , the context makes the comment make sense - he 's just correcting grammar, 
  sick and at work : /, 
  nz first , although i might be underestimating how conservative it is, 
   for example the buccaneers over the caribbean and the other sioux instead of teddyk 's sioux . 
  just fyi , neither of those mods are from jfd or tpangolin - they 're more civs and tomatekh respectively, 
  yep , that 's where all the videos i linked to are from, 
  already did dave dobbyn on the 11th, 
  what other way is there to finish a series on nz music than with poi e ? 
  sure , it 's on hold music a fair bit , but it 's a core part of nz 's culture . 
  it 's been really interesting doing this , seeing how people like to downvote music they do n't like , with a fair few of the earlier posts ( midnight youth , phoenix foundation etc ) staying fairly close to 0 with large amounts of votes . 
  over the whole thing i tried to present a variety of music to showcase how diverse nz music is ( in response to certain people who disagreed in that regard , ) and even now there 's still dozens of decent bands which i have n't had time to feature . 
  i 'd also like to give a quick shoutout to / u/nilnz , who has been making a [ youtube playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plnze8i2hhj43gymh-3w-t_yr7riubj43n ) alongside this feature with all of the daily songs on it . 
  i might create a new one tomorrow with every single song , not just the main ones , and maybe a couple extras thrown in that people have suggested but were n't featured . 
  finally , thanks to ( most of ) you for getting behind this , suggesting bands and posting your own personal favourties or connections which you have with the song . 
  given how subjective taste in music is , it 's a miracle something like this even worked at all .
