  some of those were featured as extra songs from artists - north by north was yesterday and slice of heaven was alongside be mine tonight as a dave dobbyn feature . 
  great list though, 
  except for the whole chola being a naval civ ... 
  direction alternates with days, 
  oh god this would be awesome . 
  hell , just have jarvis narrate the whole thing like that, 
  damn straight . 
  although i think the certificate needs some work , i 'd prefer a / r/newzealand coat of arms instead of the reddit coat of arms, 
  good afternoon , today is monday the first of june . 
  on this day in 1215 what is now beijing was conquered by genghis khan , and in 1812 the united states congress first debates declaring war on the united kingdom . 
  also today , the last serious heir in the bonaparte dynasty is killed during the anglo-zulu war in 1879 , with him died the chances of restoring a bonaparte to the throne of france . 
  finally , today in 1941 saw the end of the battle of crete , where allied forces ( including a significant nz division ) held off a nazi invasion for 11 days , during which time they inflicted heavy losses on the germans . 
  todays facts were brought to you by the end of nz music month : /, 
  not yet , but we should design one . 
  couple of garden implements , some moa , the bucket fountain, 
   ca n't think of anyone else who has fuelled as much discussion on this sub . 
  surely by that logic john key should get one too ? 
  not saying he should or anything , just pointing out a logic flaw . 
  maybe i 'm just bitter because hager was kind of a dick when i met him, 
  once we get a proper certificate maybe someone should tweet him about it, 
  he had nothing to do with it , david cameron on the other hand ... 
  do we award posthumously ? 
  because imperial has more measurements starting with f , and the f stands for *** freedom ***, 
  that seems somewhat excessive, 
   fervently obeying the posted speed limit, 
  you 're already doing better than kiwi drivers . 
  late november and december is exam season for high schools and is at the tail end of uni exams , while primary school does n't finish until mid december , so you wo n't face much competition from domestic tourists . 
  most places tend to get the busiest after christmas , new years is a big point for holidays as there are music festivals all over the country where students go . 
  around this point queenstown / wanaka will be absolutely chocka , i made the mistake of going into queenstown the day after new years one time and it took me at least an hour to get from [ frankton to queenstown ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/nie9z ) ( normally takes about 10 minutes ), 
  early december you should be right , it 's just a matter of timing your trip . 
  like , say for example you 're going to milford sound . 
  instead of taking a tour bus there , staying a couple nights in te anau either side means that you can get up early , and get on the road to milford sound before the tour buses arrive from queenstown ( tends to get to te anau about 10am ) , which means you have much fewer people to contend with and can get on one of the earlier sailings before the big tours get there . 
  except her birthday is april 21 ... 
  as long as you keep an eye out for people behind you , and pull over if there 's someone there and you can do so safely you 'll be fine . 
  oh , and do n't speed up when it gets to passing lanes unless you 're actually overtaking someone, 
  problem is that between christchurch and dunedin there 's not a whole lot to look at . 
  i mean , you go over a couple rivers here and there , and oamaru has some pretty cool old buildings , but there 's about three hours of straight roads surrounded by farmland with idiots left right and centre on the road . 
  if you had the time , i 'd suggest heading over to the west coast and going down to queenstown that way , before heading down central otago and out to dunedin . 
  takes longer , but it 's a million times better than going sh1 down to dunedin . 
  you 've still got farmland , but only about an hour of it and you 've got the mountains front and centre for that time . 
  plus you 'd get to check out whats left of the glaciers , go through haast and arthur 's passes and see nz how it used to be . 
  pretty much the west coast still has a bunch of the native forest which used to cover [ most of the country ] ( https://envirohistorynz.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/nz-forest-cover2-e1260780864370.jpg?w=510 ) - it was burnt by the maori to flush out moa and felled by europeans for lumber across a fair chunk of the country , but the west coast escaped the worst of it and there 's still a huge chunk of native forest along the whole west coast , whereas east of the divide you 'll just have farmland for the most part where it used to be, 
  ( just a note with that map , it does n't take into account european logging . 
  [ these ] ( http://files.umwblogs.org/citizenoftheworld.umwblogs.org/files/2015/02/06165757/changes-land-use.jpg ) [ maps ] ( http://www.seafriends.org.nz/issues/cons/mapsnz11.gif ) are tiny but they give some indication of how much forest was lost , especially in the north island . 
  oh please , i could do at least three times that . 
  wait , are we talking in one sitting ? 
  because i * could * , it 'd just take me a week or so, 
  please , caesium is where it 's at . 
  at least now the other companies know what to beat, 
  what i find funny is that little is pretty much tied with winnie in popularity . 
  almost expected to see aunty helen surge back into the poll, 
  movember 's not that bad, 
   any requests ? 
  we still need one for sir john , and i 've been trying to convince the mods to give me an i-site flair, 
  good morning !, 
  today is wednesday the 3rd of june . 
  on this day in 1839 the destruction of 1.2 million kilos of opium by the chinese provides britain with a casus belli to invade , resulting in the first opium war . 
  also today , in 1855 the last military battle fought on canadian soil to date was fought between canadian and cree forces , where the leader of the cree , big bear , escaped capture . 
  happy birthday to montenegro , who today turns 9 years old !, 
  they 're just jealous that they ca n't grow a 70 's mustache . 
  ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ can ^ ^ ^ either ^ ^ ^ :(, 
  if i can get a couple more done by then can they be included too ? 
  it 's 20x20 right ? 
  how about transparency ? 
  how difficult is it to edit ? 
  i could give it a shot in photoshop if you want , so the flairs look a tiny bit better without the background, 
  should be able to , it 'd just go back to white backgrounds . 
  or i could just handle it from now on , but that 's more of a mod duty, 
  i am :(, 
  maybe if some of the bigger economies took more interest in nz cricket it would be better ? 
  it 's not our fault we 're so small !, 
  what about an australia day / waitangi day series between us ? 
  pretty sure it hides posts made before a certain date , but not submissions, 
  yellow and black ? 
  but we have peter dunne ?
