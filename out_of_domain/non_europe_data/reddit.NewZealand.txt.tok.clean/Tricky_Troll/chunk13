  i have a pc too , but my friends are on ps4, 
  how would boosting it help ? 
  getting back in the jet after landing on the tower is the hard part . 
  anyway , anyone who plays bf4 would know that 80 % of games there is a sniper up there . 
  finally look him up on psn and battlelog . 
  you will see no ties to me or my friends . 
  ( i 'm assuming , i have n't checked myself . ), 
  battlefield was never marketed on realism , but instead , `` larger battles . '', 
  only retards think it is realistic . 
  the faa will be investigating this incident . 
  how do you even get a 2000m headshot ?!, 
  forget a 2000m headshot collateral !, 
  normal speed version : https://youtu.be/wl_9ymqmzom, 
  thanks , 
  0 , this is the first time . 
  maybe you are thinking of [ this ] ( https://redd.it/3wdont ) from a few days back , it was a similar stunt . 
  yes , i think you mean [ this ] ( https://redd.it/3wdfvt ) and thanks , 
  you do it first :p, 
  get the slam ? 
  that was a shocking pun, 
  i know , i 'm sorry :( i was too busy laughing at the fact that i got a squad wipe !, 
  i have been attempting that on a friend , i 'll be doing it some more , but it will be on a friend just to prove that it is possible first . 
  i think you are referring to [ this ] ( https://redd.it/3wdont ) i posted it a couple of days back , it is different though . 
  that was different , that one two days ago what this https://redd.it/3wdont, 
  that was also me , https://redd.it/3wdont, 
  did you know you can travel backwards while parachuting ? 
  just push backwards on the joystick or s on pc . 
  other than that it is timing of when you pull the chute and practice . 
  lol , at the start the comments in this thread were at -2 and -3, 
  i 'm trying , gon na test it on a friend first though . 
  well , actually ea added one of the bf4 maps and turned it into a golf course for one of their golf games ... 
  so it may just be possible in the future . 
  good point , quite likely to ko them i assume as i am aware of cases of people being knocked unconcious from a defib in real life as well as deaths . 
  it is why doctors yell `` clear '' so that others dont get shocked . 
  i like it !, 
  challenge accepted , it 's on my to do list of stunts . 
  you simply hold the enter vehicle button while in very close vicinity . 
  for jets you must be within a metre or 2 of the cockpit , wings dont let you in . 
  no , lol , it 's just that it looks like it since you can only see the sky and the jet , the jet is simply falling faster than me , and since you cant see anything else to judge my speed it is natural to assume that the plane is stationary and i 'm moving up to it . 
  correct  it took a few hours of testing in an empty server to get the right timing and what position i need to eject from the jet in . 
  it 's a tiny portion of the community that do it , i my self have only been killed by someone stunting once after 1000 hours and that was my friend , we were having a rendezook off so one of us was going to die anyway . 
  i 'm sorry , i was too busy laughing at the fact that i wiped a squad with a defibrillator !, 
  reason i did n't flare :, 
   i 'm sorry , i was too busy laughing at the fact that i wiped a squad with a defibrillator !, 
  it bf4 is in the near future and it is a chinese replica of [ arecibo observatory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arecibo_observatory ) so it is in use . 
  thanks , and it look like i 'm parachuting up because ... 
   it looks like it since you can only see the sky and the jet , the jet is simply falling faster than me , and since you cant see anything else to judge my speed it is natural to assume that the plane is stationary and i 'm moving up to it . 
  it 's not a repost ... this is different to this :, 
  wire we still doing this ? 
  yeah , you are n't the only one, 
   it looks like it since you can only see the sky and the jet , the jet is simply falling faster than me , and since you cant see anything else to judge my speed it is natural to assume that the plane is stationary and i 'm moving up to it . 
  yeah , we are , i 'm not involved with this one . 
  what 's your battlelog name ? 
  pretty much, 
  not this one . 
  maybe you are thinking of [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3wdont/still_amazed_that_i_got_this/ ) one, 
  i personally only posted each one once on / r/gaming and once on / r/battlefield _ 4, 
  haha , that sounds like a lot of fun !, 
   i 'm sorry , i was too busy laughing at the fact that i wiped a squad with a defibrillator !, 
  battlefield 4, 
  it is based off arecibo , it is a chinese replica set somewhere in the near future , totally fictitious though . 
  yep , 
  i did it twice in 3 days , i 'm the only person to have done it so far as i invented it . 
  how fast other youtubers and stunters in the bf4 community will show how easy/hard it is . 
  it is n't too hard once you get the right angle , speed and altitude to leave your jet at when you eject but working that out takes a few hours of testing in an empty server . 
  nah , most of the bf community stuck with bf4 , dice la the support devs really fixed the game up to the point that if it was released in it 's current state it would likely be one of the highest rated fps games of all time . 
  it truly is an amazing game now , a shame it had such a dodgy launch . 
  not quite , you were thinking of this one ... https://redd.it/3wdont, 
  battlefield 4, 
  i could n't stop laughing after that squad wipe , they would have been so pissed !, 
  ah , yeah , i 'm aware we 're wanting an at heli gunner . 
  omg , that is a really good idea !, 
  i 'll see what i can do ... 
  i feel the same way , all people who snipe from the back of the map die heaps because they dont move . 
  simply strafing between shots can easily half your deaths when long range sniping . 
  i 'm sorry but gfycat links do the best of all video platforms on reddit and they are limited to 15 seconds !, 
  rip alien contact . 
  the stealth jet is actually surprisingly weak against infantry for game balancing purposes , for example it can take up to 10 20mm cannon rounds to kill someone . 
  i ejected out of my jet , landed on a tower , killed 3 players with a defibrillator , jumped off the tower , pulled my parachute and got back in the jet and flew away . 
  not much to it really :3, 
  it is consistent on stationary targets . 
  that 's actually a nice compliment , 
  that was ... wow . 
  i 'll always love watching this one , good job bige !, 
  i did a regular rendezook with a grenade [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/4nxdqxdz9eq ), 
  i think slams + smaw will do just fine . 
  true ... 
  done both , 
  it is really peopular now , the support devs totally fixed the game and brought in free dlc . 
  the population of the game gets as high as 50k at times . 
  this is different to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3wdont/still_amazed_that_i_got_this/ ) , 
  staged ? 
  your evidence : coz there were 3 of them camping . 
  my evidence that it was n't staged ... 
  finding the campers is not the hard part , anyone who plays battlefield 4 frequently would know that most games of conquest on rogue transmission ( the game shown ) there is a player on one of the teams sniping from these towers . 
  so all i have to do is switch teams or join another server until i have a target/targets . 
  go on to psn and battlelog and you will find that the players i killed are not friends with me nor do we have any friends in common on either of the platforms . 
  you can also look through my recent battlereports on battlelog ( my recent games ) and you will find that that game was the only time i have played in the same server with these people . 
  i have completed dozens of different stunts on my youtube channel , you are welcome to check them for repeat names and i can assure you that there were no repeat names in my stunts . 
  ( my playlist of all my stunts can be found here if you want to check : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plzzscqe0cvracrms5evc840cq_-jdft5o ),
