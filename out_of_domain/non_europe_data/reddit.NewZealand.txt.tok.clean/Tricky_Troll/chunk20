  or will it forever be speculation and theories which fit best ? 
  so you 're telling me that to use the downvote button i do something other than click it ??!, 
  you 're more likely to get bitten by a german shepherd , chow chow and even a golden retriever . 
  according to the akc . 
  so their behaviour is certainly not abnormal . 
  they just do more damage when they are provoked . 
  any experienced , caring dog owner can own a pitbull and it will be as safe as the next dog . 
  dogs do n't just attack because they want to . 
  the issue is not the pitbull , it is the owner . 
  if pitbulls really are an issue , then you need to restrict them to experienced owners only , but i really do n't think that is necessary . 
  i 'm not saying it is n't a reliable stat , but a website called `` dogsbite '' is very likely to be biased . 
  then in that case , the problem is not the breed , but the owner . 
  the solution is regulations for who can own what . 
  i ( as stated before ) think that essentially making the breed illegal is not the solution . 
  people ( the owners and people in charge of making any regulations ) need to take more responsibility and stop expecting dogs to behave even when they 're treated like crap . 
  he is in a critical condition , does n't mean he wo n't die as a result of that . 
  lol , i want the best for him , just explaining that it could still fit in the category of `` watchpeopledie '' :p, 
  there is also the possibility of him dying from blood loss from a poorly placed iv line , but like your possibility , it is unlikely . 
  but was your sentence south american portuguese ? 
  so hurry up and put that z in as fast as you 'd put your dick in a hot chick . 
  on behalf of bono , i am proud to announce that you can not delete the free albums or vomit up the bono bread !,

  and the thumbnail has a girl wearing a bikini because that 's how clickbait works . 
  then what else can i do ? 
  with an unrelated thumbnail of a girl in a bikini, 
  my name is mclovin, 
  challenge accepted  the plan is me + a friend next to each other in jets , we both eject , swap jets , destroy jet on our tail , 
  i agree , that was weird how you got no points ... 
  yet no explosion on impact with the ground . 
  maybe your team commander did a proxy attack or emp drone a second before impact ? 
  extreme cqb situations with an as val or cz-3a1 or the p90 for it 's 50 round capacity . 
  otherwise , yeah , i think that they 're pretty pointless . 
  the tunguska is always ~ ~ stuck ~ ~ camping, 
  his recording was bugged , so they had recreate it . 
  that info was a total hoax , based on nothing . 
  anything but 2143 and i am happy !, 
  a third life crisis most accurate fraction to use without featuring on / r/theydidthemath ? 
  please !, 
  i need that mpx !!!!, 
  appreciate it !, 
  i do n't think that there is a `` best '' scout heli pilot . 
  sure , russianpaladin has the most kills , but by no means is he the best with capten_planets and dozens more top level players , i do n't think that anyone is the best . 
  the only way to tell would be to have a 1v1 dogfight competition where it is first to 20 wins to advance to the next round . 
  too many players are just unbelieveably good pilots . 
  good point , but that is the only statistic missing as we can see their average spm , kpm and k/d . 
  as i think that k/d , kpm , spm and the best dogfighter are the 4 ways to judge who is best . 
  i do n't like the whole futurism thing . 
  i like real guns , with real names and/or battles which have or may happen . 
  but when it is walking tanks and railguns and lock ons everywhere it just gets boring for me . 
  also , it is easier to lower the skill gap on a game with futuristic qualities . 
  eg homing shot in swbf makes no sense in a modern shooter . 
  i got it !, 
  thank you so much !, 
  is the rocket coming out of her ass ??!, 
  surely the wind would blow him off !, 
  as long as it is n't futuristic crap with a million lock ons , i 'm happy . 
  for me it is anything but 2143 . 
  i have had enough of futuristic shooters . 
  on the other hand , if we go back in time , there will be very few to no lock ons !, 
  so true xd, 
  exactly , same with the homing shot on swbf ( sure it 's star wars but it 's still sci-fi ), 
  i was supposed to say a sci-fi shooter , since i count swbf as a `` futuristic style '' because it involves technology which humans can not create at this moment in time . 
  oh , and i have never played cod for anything other than zombies or the odd split screen party game with friends . 
  just wondering , why is the btr better ? 
  and where does the chinese lav fit in ? 
  but the cannon/loadout differences are the same in game , right ? 
  i have played and seen enough sci-fi games to know that i do n't like sci-fi shooters . 
  p90 is still my fav for engineer . 
  nope . 
  i play with auto aim off . 
  and by the way , i never even noticed it was gone . 
  it 's funny how retarded pc players think that it works everytime all the time ** facepalm **, 
  i do perfoverlay.drawfps 1, 
  display fps , i think it 's exactly the same , haha, 
  but did you ? 
  yes ? 
  ok , well you will do what it is human nature to do and glorify it and remember it better than it was . 
  i 'm not saying it was a good or a bad game , all i am saying is that it is human nature to remember things being better than they were . 
  bfbc2 is a great example , many players say it was the highlight of the battlefield franchise . 
  when actually it was notorious for grenade spam and `` netcode '' sure it was a good game , but people exaggerate just how good it was . 
  same with 2142 . 
  i bet that you 're remembering it better than it was . 
  where am i going with this ? 
  you have probably missed or forgotten about many things which you used to hate about the game . 
  i do n't blame you , i will forever be that way about bf4 . 
  finally , just because i have n't played 2142 does n't mean that i can call whether i would like 2143 or not !, 
  why would that even matter ????!!!!, 
  i do not like futuristic shooters anywhere near as much as modern shooters . 
  would i still play 2143 ? 
  yeah , probably , unless they fuck it over like hardline then i would most likely play it , it would just suck in comparison to a would be 1944 , 1982 or bf5 in my opinion . 
  sci-fi is still sci-fi though . 
  wow . 
   square acres, 
  ** facepalm **, 
  that was a crazy smaw shot , but a rendezook means to get the `` zook '' kill and get back in the jet . 
  anyway , that was a really good shot . 
  jet limbo !, 
  how low can you go ? 
  i just wanted to kill the maa and so when i was getting shot at i hid behind the maa .
