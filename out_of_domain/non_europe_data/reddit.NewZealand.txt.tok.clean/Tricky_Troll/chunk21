  and yes , i use the minimap all the time . 
  if you shoot the slams directly with the smaw , sometimes the smaw deals no damage and so , the maa can get away with 16 health left . 
  i was trying to shoot the smaw so that it still dealt damage to the maa , but to also set off the slams , killing him . 
  fly at cruising speed , and hit the afterburners on second before you eject . 
  do not touch the left joystick/wasd keys until you start falling !, 
  otherwise the jet will fly in front of you and leave you behind . 
  and if you 're on console , you will have to get out of the jet and get back in , either by doing a `` rodeo '' where you ride the jet and get back in or you can land the jet , get out and get back in . 
  otherwise you wo n't super eject and so wo n't be able to get back in the jet . 
  no , because if you hit the slam directly the smaw does n't deal damage and so the maa only takes 84 damage from the slams and he kills me as i reload the smaw . 
  edit : downvotes ? 
  lol , it has happened to me time and time again :p, 
  he most likely threw a first aid pack at the pillars where the roof collapses , collapsing it , killing a teammate . 
  mean while , i would just shoot randomly into a group of enemies rather than picking them off one by one :(, 
  really ? 
  now do that with 20mm cannons ;p, 
  just going to point out that aa mine in your loadout which is just as bad as a stinger ... 
  1:38 levelcap is in you server . 
  lol , there are so many different combinations of i and ls to make the llllevelcaplll, 
  i play the game to have fun , is that not what a game is for ? 
  it 's what i payed $ 100nzd for . 
  for reddit karma ? 
  lol , nope , the likes and views on youtube mean more to me . 
  i enjoy editing and uploading youtube videos much more . 
  and ruining the fun ? 
  yeah , right . 
  i do n't waste jets that often . 
  i take out any enemy air vehicles before i attempt a stunt . 
  if there is a really good ptfoing rank 140 jet pilot i can take him out with the stealth , sometimes we 're talking killstreak stopped points of 200 + . 
  i would consider stopping a 20 attack jet killstreak to be pretty fucking valuable . 
  then keeping enemy jets down so that our land vehicles can get a break . 
  i love it how people think that rendezooks and stunts mean that you ca n't be using that jet properly . 
  sure , i will fail and miss the jet sometimes , but that only gives an enemy jet a 90 second window of freedom before i get ontheir tail again . 
  finally , the super eject can be used tactically . 
  got a jet on your tail ? 
  ca n't shake him off ? 
  super eject and your jet stalls faster than it can stall with a player inside , usually results in you being behind their tail after you stalled ( that is if you missed the rpg ) . 
  i too ... 
  how about active protection , it is extremely inconsistent now . 
  surely anyone who uses it can relate to what i 'm talking about . 
  evidence that the minimap is a huge advantage !, 
  he learned that wrestling is fake ... 
  correct, 
  read the description of the video , also that guy was on a show called tosh .0 about that video , haha . 
  i smaw what you did there . 
  wow , that 's pretty crazy !!!, 
  rename yourself : shittyversionofshittyjokesbot . 
  we need more heroes like you . 
  dawnbreaker is by far the glitchiest map . 
  wow ... 
  not really , but based on the location and chronological order of the multiplayer maps the 3 superpowers are in an all out war against each other . 
  the us attacks china from the south china sea ( ** paracel storm , naval strike maps ** ) as the us begins to gain ground on the chinese they also attack from the south west attacking just north of nepal making a front stretching from china 's south west all the way through to shanghai ( ** hainan resort/flood zone/siege of shanghai/dawnbreaker and the dragons teeth dlc ** ) in the east , pushing through the guilin mountains to the gobi desert ( ** china rising dlc ** ) . 
  russia meanwhile attacks china from the north ( ** golmud railway/lancang dam and rogue transmission a chinese replica of [ arecibo observatory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arecibo_observatory ) ** ) i assume china somewhere around this time surrenders leaving the us and russia battling it out in kazakhstan , china , mongolia and southern russia ( ** operation locker/zavod 311 ** ) finally , with the only dlc which seems to be in chronological order for the fictitious war , ** final stand ** sees russia battling the us in northern russia where russia uses experimental technologies in a last ditch attempt to try and push back the us ( their `` final stand '' ) before the us finally defeats them . 
  that 's what i always figured , and as for the setting of the game , it is officially a contemporary game giving no date , but i heard an estimate of 2018 . 
  also , this war is assuming there would be no use of nuclear weaponry . 
  thanks , 
  also , i believe that the russians were holding back the americans very well in their final stand until reports suggest that a team in la managed to remotely nerf the most powerful weapon the russians had left ( the rorsch railgun ) to a point where it was useless and the russians were subsequently defeated . 
  lag/latency . 
  one of you probably had a high ping . 
  does the kill feed say [ radio beacon ] or [ killed ], 
  speaking of which , apparently a soflam/pld + javelin at e ( the closest to the enemy base ) on hainan resort killed me flying directly above the us base at 300m altitude through my ecms . 
  i was n't even mad because of the teamwork , but it seemed pretty damn unfair and broken . 
  yep , skill  lock ons . 
  ** facepalm ** just because a game was well balanced does not in any way mean that the sequel will be any more balanced than a totally different title by the same devs . 
  how balanced 2142 was , has almost nothing to do with how balanced 2143 would be . 
  that 's disappointing :(, 
  also the name of the main theme song . 
  although not impossible that it is a hint to a possible 1944 , i doubt it . 
  that was impressive accuracy . 
  what attachments do you typically run ? 
  possibly a teaser ?

  thanks !, 
  btw it was a quad bike , the slam only deals about 30 damage to a tank : /, 
  edit : good edit on your comment, 
  yeah , true , but i only did it once . 
  it actually took me dozens of attempts , the mines seem to fall under the map 50 % of the time , other times tanks run over the mines rather than quads . 
  it was also common to get shot down while trying to take off again and landing the slams on the road is n't that easy either since the jet ejects you to the right slightly meaning that the slams too go slightly to the left of where your jet goes . 
  i know !, 
  i would only recommend that if you know that there are no aa or rpg using enemies there . 
  i generally avoid placing mines between the deployment and a base but rather on or between bases , but the way i delivered the slams made an exception for this . 
  what ? 
  like hardline ? 
  fuck that . 
  the timer in the wait screen is 10x more annoying . 
  i know where i want to respawn seconds after i die while the killcam plays . 
  why ? 
  because then i know where the enemy who killed me is and i can look at the map and scoreboard in the meantime . 
  teamkilling is the number 1 reason why i do n't play hardcore . 
  too many selfish assholes . 
  [ the book depository ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wytttlnk4g ), 
  good point . 
  not very often . 
  when you need to throw them across the map instead of drop them straight down to the ground . 
  ( m15 at mines drop straight to the ground rather than fly like the slams did . ), 
  um ... slams are quicker to place but do much less damage so i would say slams for a more aggressive player and at mines for a more defensive role . 
  tried it with a few buddies , i fly right under them ( they were on the rogue transmission ) and we were trying to get both mines and slams to stick for about 30 mins , but they just seemed to bounce off a flying jet . 
  as for what you suggested , i would have to land the jet to put the mines on , removing the epicness : /, 
  ok then , what could i do which is different ? 
  yep . 
  no locking on symbol ?
