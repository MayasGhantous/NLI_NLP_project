  must have been aimed at another vehicle and you saved his ass like the worlds best bodyguard . 
  yeah man , i love getting comments !, 
  :d it 's why i do it !, 
  you pretty much proved my point that there is n't much else to do . 
  oh yeah , that 's right !, 
  yep , and the one in the game is a chinese replica of it . 
  yeah , it has been getting more popular thanks to the continued support , extra features and extra free dlc which was never planned at bf4s release . 
  now that it is n't broken , it truly is one of the best fps games out right now . 
  possibly , but it would n't be very impressive since you have to land the jet to put them on . 
  i 'm fine if you have the option to skip it , but the timer in the bottom right before you could spawn pissed me off no end . 
  it 's like , oh , they 're taking b , let me just spawn there . 
  ** 8 seconds to spawn in ** by the time you can spawn it the enemy has b. 
  that 's totally different . 
  the sniper is n't complaining or making stupid noises for his teammates to hear . 
  he is as good as not being there but that is n't as bad as being there and being an ass to those who ptfo . 
  a guy making a scene at a restaurant is not comparable to a sniper at the back of the map . 
  one draws your attention and the other is sitting out of sight doing nothing . 
  totally different things . 
   would you pissed if you were at a fancy dinner and there 's a loud ass dude eating with his feet and throwing shit everywhere and someone told you '' he 's eating the way he wants to !, 
  the restaurant was assumed . 
  read the whole thread before commenting next time . 
  it 's in the same thread , fuckwit . 
  it was part of the thread . 
  i was discussing the thread and disagreeing you . 
  i ca n't believe that you were suggesting that i did n't know how to use reddit , lol !, 
  39,000 karma and you think i do n't know how to use reddit ? 
  ** facepalm **, 
  great point . 
  yeah , i saw !, 
  i was intentionally replying to you . 
  anything i reference which was earlier in the thread is relevant . 
  you 're mistaking a metaphor with the actual conversation topic which i was discussing . 
  you are next level stupid . 
  it would n't work because slams and mines do n't stick to a moving jet :(, 
  i also got 8 , but a month ago somebody got 9 on locker . 
  after almost 2000 suav kills on metro , i would say that more than 8 on metro wo n't happen . 
  locker has longer lines of people since the doors on metro split the group of players at the start of the match into 2 . 
  also , i used play with him all the time , he rarely plays anymore :(, 
  whenever we are both on we try to get a total of 12 or more as in i get 6 or more and he gets 6 or more in the same game , essentially demolishing the enemy team so the us can take b ( for once ) . 
  on a separate , but related matter :, 
  i know for a fact that tick rate aside , almost all pc servers are trash . 
  practically every single one fits in one of the following categories which i ca n't stand :, 
  instant vehicle respawn . 
  400 % tickets . 
  24/7 maps . 
  alternatively , on ps4 almost ever server which is on a custom rotation states that it is a custom rotation , and most servers are on the default rotation . 
  they are perfect on ps4 . 
  i am speaking within west us and australian servers with no settings on the server browser other than those locations . 
  do you mean the j20 jet ? 
  what in the fuck ?!, 
  or he may have rpged your tv missile , due to a glitch in the game , sometimes you are the tv missile and if it gets destroyed , you die . 
  i personally think that the p90 ( which you unlock by killing hannah in the final mission ) is easily the most powerful pdw and is borderline op . 
  it happens every time that the defibs are charged , but only when they are charged . 
  how do i go ahead with this , anything to do other than just click report on the video ? 
  he hit them head on , so the suav probably got destroyed by the 4th person , coming from behind this probably would n't have happened . 
  and i have been trying to get 9 + on locker recently ... , 
  ah , right , and is a youtube video copyrighted ? 
  should 've been running zunis :p, 
  i think that counter-knifing could work though , rather than the knife button to counter every time it is a random button . 
  ( that is assuming that they fix weird animations . ), 
  i would still be happier if it was removed though . 
  she was on crack . 
  problem solved . 
  srr61/m98b personally , fast bullet velocity and large magazines . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the m98b is one of the best ptfo snipers . 
  i can relate with my loading speeds for pc :( it 's why i mainly play ps4 at the moment . 
  got one , the problem is the other specs, 
  yep , battlefield has always been * marketed * for `` larger battles '' , not realism, 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  seriously , look it up , no battlefield has been * marketed * on realism !, 
  battlefield has always been * marketed * for `` larger battles '' , not realism, 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  ( it 's not downvoted anymore , it got to -4 though ) seriously , look it up , no battlefield has been * marketed * on realism !, 
  shit !, 
  i did too :(, 
  i know , the idea though is to `` ghost ride the whip '' so that it looks cooler and when the enemy sees the killcam they 're confused as hell . 
  i know !, 
  how come nobody has thought of or done something like that before !, 
  well , the fail was when the jet crashed rather than continuing to fly through the air , so i quickly decided to chase my jet . 
  it is because they are levolution objects , the cables on the 3rd tower which does n't collapse will destroy your jet because they are n't part of the levolution . 
  it would be a lot of coding to change that , so they did n't . 
  on pc you press c and on console it is click the right joystick . 
  works in all vehicles , even some gadgets like the eod bot and the suav . 
  battlefield 4 . 
  while it is over 2 years old it has an extremely large player base for 2 years after release due to continued support and free dlc . 
  yeah , i realise that now :(, 
  thanks !, 
  the top of the towers and the receiver in the middle are popular sniping ( camping ) spots , to get to the receiver in the middle ( which has a bit more cover than the towers ) the only way to get there by foot is to run along the wires . 
  most games there is someone ( or even a whole squad ) on either of the teams which is camping up there . 
  yes , which is based on [ arecibo observatory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arecibo_observatory ) the one in game is a chinese replica of arecibo . 
  yes . 
  it is the spawn invincibility . 
  the gun was the dlt , i think , but it actually deals damage when there is no spawn protection , lol . 
  i figured that would be even more over-use of it . 
  i would use the older themes like bf1943 , but when i tried that , youtube 's crappy copyright system detected it as the bf2 theme ( which is copyrighted and ca n't be used ) when i uploaded the 1943 version ( which is fine to use ) :( bf5 better have some good music !, 
  yep . 
  there are many things to get better at bf4 . 
  personally , i would watch youtube tutorials , but the best tip i can give you is to pay attention to the minimap !, 
  battlefield 4,
