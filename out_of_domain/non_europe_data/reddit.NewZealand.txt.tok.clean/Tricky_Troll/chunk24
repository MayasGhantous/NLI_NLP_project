  dayz is usually the game i play when i 'm sick of bf4 , haha . 
  maybe i should just forget about the game until 0.60 experimental . 
  that 's when i have the most fun because people are generally nicer in exp . 
  yes , but i do kill anyone who is geared or would kill me if they could . 
  the problem is that seemingly everyone would simply kill you given the chance whether you are ** geared or not ** , no matter how kind you are to them and how legitimately friendly they seem . 
  it just is n't much fun after a while . 
  it hurts the longevity of the game . 
  i gave him a weapon which if he attacked my with i could move away , turn around and shoot him , but nope . 
  the dayz desync comes in and finishes you off . 
  and we were stuck in a police station , what was i going to do ? 
  run outside into sniper fire to know if i can trust him ? 
  at that point we had been talking for 5-10 minutes before i gave him anything . 
  i guess that 's just my luck in this game then . 
  hence i gave him an axe rather than my red 9 , so that i could run away to turn around and shoot him , but the dayz desync fucked that plan up . 
  true , but if people would n't backstab others then it would be less noticeable :p, 
  yeah , i got my macbook for video editing my battlefield videos . 
  ( i play that on a ps4 because the bf4 pc servers are literally trash compared to console ones , quite a long , unrelated story though . ), 
  i get up to 45 fps at 900p and down to 20 in cities , everything on low . 
  i 'm still happy with my choice of computer . 
  fuck that . 
  that is n't anywhere near as fun . 
  as already mentioned , once he hit me with the axe , i had time to get away , turn around and shoot him , but his ping must have been through the roof and he killed me with an axe from another room . 
  also , we had a good conversation for 5-10 minutes and we had a common enemy/enemies so he seemed totally trustworthy . 
  that 's not true . 
  i bought this game for the pvp . 
  yet all of the best moments i have had are when players actually talk and interact with me . 
  thank you !, 
  i called it shit because that is honestly how it feels now . 
  and also because it would be controversial . 
  more controversy more comments . 
  i want a large discussion here . 
  in terms of zombies , the implementation of them when they are n't bugged will be interesting . 
  i 'm just saying that its got a better community than the players since all the crap players wo n't often go here . 
  i totally agree with those points too . 
  i will often run from kabanino to novy sobor to zelenogorsk and back to kabanino . 
  it seems to be the best path for finding other players when you stick to main roads by those towns . 
  `` wah , hugh , woooaah !, 
  experimental usually has much less of that kind of douchebaggery . 
  i stand by my point . 
  i never said the community of this sub was amazing . 
  i said that people here tend to be better because you get more experienced and frequent players here rather from that squeaker who bought the game just to earn people 's trust and then shoot them in the back and generally be a cunt about it . 
  yep . 
  it 's a hard balance between the players which want dayz like it was in the mod and those who want it to be another shoot em up . 
  sadly i 'm not wholly convince that it will become more survival based since most players just want to go on a killing rampage . 
  well , that 's not me . 
  i already stated that rp is n't fun because there is no pvp . 
  tip for reddit noobs like you : read the whole post next time . 
  edit : looked at your account , you 're just a wannabe troll and an asshole , lol . 
  where is the hypocrisy ? 
  ** you assumed that i do n't want others to kill other geared players , no . 
  i never said that . 
  ** i would kill most geared players or players who just want to kill . 
  anyone without a gun who seems trustworthy i will talk to , to judge whether i trust them or not . 
  i never said i do n't want geared players to not shoot other geared players , so there is no hypocrisy . 
  i 'm talking about not shooting fresh spawns/players without a gun . 
  still no hypocrisy there . 
  you clearly did n't understand what i was getting at . 
  i do n't know what someone really wants to do , so i talk to the fresh spawn and i take an educated guess on whether i can trust him or not . 
  i changed my flair as a result of this post , haha, 
  that 's what i meant/suggested . 
  well did you give them the money which they oh so desperately need ? 
  suav and a map like metro or locker to fly it skillfully on . 
  more povs here and the set up for the stunt . 
  including a pov of the guy who was on standing on top of the tank when it was launched : https://youtu.be/8-jp_hhshzk, 
  thanks !, 
  also , we have plans to do something very similar to that tank launch ... 
  maybe the hit boxes were out , it means that if i were to aim on the opposite side of the jet ( the top ) i would likely get a dust hit , i was still aiming at a target the same size . 
  also , my ping was 190-210 ( so that the guy in the jet had a low ping , you ca n't get back in the jet if your ping is too high ), 
  i do so quite often , it depends if i feel like it or not . 
  i paid $ 60 to have fun , not to do what my team wants me to do all the time . 
  edit : the deleted question was about ptfoing :p, 
  it 's fully intentional . 
  it is to counter for lag . 
  first of all , you have to be near the cockpit to get in , the wings or even the body of the plane wont let you in . 
  the reason you see people fall in front of the cockpit is because the server thinks that the jet is further ahead of where you see it to be . 
  so what happens is if my ping is greater than about 50 , and i land right on top of the cockpit i will slide off the back of the jet because the server thinks that the jet is further than i see it as being , meaning that it thinks i landed on the body of the jet , so it wont let me in . 
  so to counter for this , you fall in front of the jet so that the server thinks that you are right next to it . 
  the higher your ping , the more you have to lead the jet .

  wow , that 's pretty cool , lol . 
  ruin ? 
  ** ruin ???!!, 
  ** fuck , that is ** exactly why ** i still play on ps4 and not pc . 
  edit : pistol only servers or something similar is ok , but anything else is just shit imo . 
  the northern passage along by novod and severograd etc , the hills on either side pair well with towns in the centre . 
  also , anywhere with autumn trees , they add a great touch of colour . 
  glad i 'm not the only one who feels this way . 
  i 'm just not keen on any more than 200 % . 
  me too : /, 
  what do you mean ? 
  it is mine . 
  i came up with it . 
  it was inspired by ponylion 's `` peek-a-boo '' but the difference which made this different is that the person who detonates the c4 is the one in the jet , meaning that he has to do a rendezook to detonate the c4 . 
  i do n't know exactly , but it was about 6 hours over 2 days .
