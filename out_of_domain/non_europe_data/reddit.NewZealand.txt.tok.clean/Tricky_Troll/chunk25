  the worst part was down to luck since often the tank would be launched and flipped meaning that i ca n't shoot the jet . 
  on my youtube channel i linked ponylions version at the end . 
  i think that he took it a little too far , but 300 % tickets or more and instant vehicle respawn has to go . 
  `` bb gun '' that role is taken by the sporter . 
  yeah , in hindsight , you 're probably right :p, 
  really ? 
  does that happen occasionally or all the time ? 
  thanks for the great detailed reply !, 
  yes . 
  but i 'd rather be wearing the holster ;p, 
  you can if the plate carrier holster is not on the plate carrier , but i do n't think so ( would like someone to confirm ) if the holster is on the plate carrier . 
  i know that you cant put items in the pouches when stored . 
  rendesnipe attempt ... 
  seems like something i would do :p, 
  cool . 
  you consistency with those tvs was really impressive . 
  great stuff . 
  on metro you can use those signs and road cones . 
  you have to use a shotgun though . 
  anything else just gently pushes them . 
  no , but the plate carrier is compatible with a certain type of holster . 
  sony/microsoft might have changed a lighting filter or something similar to make it look nicer without the loss of frames , but i do n't know . 
  i personally think that the quality of bf4 on console is underrated , certainly for their relatively bad hardware . 
  also , 60fps cap *, 
  both bf4 and battlefront 3 get 60 fps on ps4 . 
  i was surprised by that too !, 
  possible , as i actually did n't get a trophy , but ps4 does n't record the trophy/message/notification pop ups, 
  resolution aside , i was surprised by how little difference there was other than the brightness . 
  it is classed as soldier collision , like fall damage . 
  my psn name is andy_98nz . 
  and it is simply a glitch where if you hit something or get hit by something going fast enough you die of fall damage '' it just so happens that shooting that sign with a shotgun launches it fast enough to deal `` fall damage '' to a player . 
  `` milk '' ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  that was impressive . 
  well , dice did announce that not all easter eggs have been found ... 
  oh , thanks , 
  not sure , it was a very vague tweet . 
  yeah , but sometimes you have to simplify for some people . 
  they are synonyms , the only difference is that one is a more widely used word . 
  you added nothing to the conversation . 
  thank you for wasting my time . 
  this happens extremely often where an enemy bails from their jet prematurely leaving it in a position where you can take it . 
  a jet steal can be crucial to bringing your team to victory . 
  i think that learning to do this jet steal should be something which every good jet pilot can do . 
  real fun with the suav happens on operation metro . 
  yeah , nice video , its a really satisfying thing to do . 
  because i am stealing the enemy jet meaning that they wont get another one until i crash it . 
  potentially meaning that they wont get another attack jet for the rest of the game , meanwhile my team has 2 attack jets . 
  ** edit : ** why the downvotes ? 
  are you downvoting because you think i am wrong and that if i steal an enemy jet it respawns even though i 'm in it ? 
  lol , i like your logic . 
  the word has the same meaning . 
  it can be used in that situation . 
  it 's just that it ** usually ** is n't used in that context . 
  words with one meaning ca n't be synonyms in some situations and not in others . 
  they are or they are n't . 
  you may be surprised but i have twice had people not know what i meant by `` discrete data '' and i had to simplify . 
  sometimes it is easier to simplify before hand . 
  everybody else ** who understands it , ** which is n't everyone . 
  that 's some crazy aim right there . 
  rip . 
  pks-07 x7 magnification sniper scope for russian weapons like the svd !, 
  the only thing which bothers me is when someone pretends that they are friendly and 5 minutes after talking or playing together they shoot you in the back . 
  that 's just for useless noobs . 
  kos is more fun and skillful than that shit . 
  not in all circumstances . 
  one time me and a fresh-ish player were pinned down in a police station with 2 or more players shooting at us . 
  we had a common enemy and he seemed like a legitimately kind player , we were strategising for 5-10 minutes , not once did he mention wanting a weapon or asking for one , i only had an mp5 and a glock , so i decided i would give him my splitting axe . 
  this way , if he did attack me , i would have time to get away . 
  ( i had a gorka helmet ) a few more minutes pass and he hits me with the axe , i immediately run out of the room and aim at the door ( which i just closed ) of the room he was in . 
  i backed into a corner where i could not get sniped from outside and i hear an axe swing and i 'm unconscious ... 
  he hit me about a second after i vacated the room which he was still in . 
  how is that my fault that i died ? 
  i had a plan if he hit me ( which only did n't work because of lag ) 2 . 
  i did n't give him my glock or mp5 so he really could n't do much to me . 
  but because of the lag i died . 
  ** how is that my fault that i trusted him and i died ?? 
  ** your comment is ** very ** situational . 
  thanks for the pro-tip !, 
  what i was getting at is that backstabbing is at the bottom of the list of playstyles for fun and skill required . 
  i personally like a mix of kos and rp/conversations . 
  i feel the same way , i 'm relieved that i saw nothing about ratios like kill/death ratio -- that would kill this game . 
  ( no pun intended ) i hope that players killed will reset at death , other stats i 'm not so bothered about . 
   9/10 fights you are going to lose because of lag, 
  that is one of the most ridiculous claims i have heard . 
  also , what was he bluffing ? 
  i stated that he did n't once methion or ask for a weapon . 
  they are n't for 0.60 , but it has been confirmed that they are coming and i am open to answers referring to things to be changed in subsequent updates . 
  it is a town north of novaya petrovka and it is the closest town to where the military base will be . 
  the base itself will be north west of north west airfield . 
  [ here you can see tisy in the top right and the site of the to be military base in the middle . ], 
  ( http://dayz.gamepedia.com/file:militarybasetisy_map.png ) this is northwest of novaya petrovka and nw of nwaf in the furthest nw part of the map . 
  try private hive servers . 
  ** way ** less hackers etc there . 
  as for glitches , use the old ui if you are n't already and give 0.60 ( the next update ) a try when it 's out . 
  i feel the same way . 
  stop camping in the maa . 
  please . 
  try using zunis as well , you 'll realise that you 're much more effective as a part infantry shredder , part aa . 
  ** edit : ** downvotes ? 
  lol , i wish i knew each of you who downvoted my comment so that i could laugh at your minuscule spm and kpm in the *** mobile *** anti-air .
