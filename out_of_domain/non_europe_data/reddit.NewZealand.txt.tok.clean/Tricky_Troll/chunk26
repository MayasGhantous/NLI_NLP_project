  `` play the game properly '' let me just remind you that it is called a *** mobile *** anti-air . 
  sitting on a hill at the back of the map is no better for your team than rendezooking , in fact , it is worse because i actually keep enemy jets down with my main cannons between trick shots . 
  maa campers just deter them from going to your corner of the map . 
  who i am or what i have done has nothing to do with my opinion and should not in any way affect yours . 
  fuck , you could be alan kertz , david sirland , ** any ** bf4 dev or literally anyone in the world and it would n't change my opinion or the way i interpret your argument . 
  my point is , why ca n't you capture bases * and * take out enemy air * and * destroy infantry in the maa ? 
  it is ** way ** more effective like that rather than wasting it like you do by camping . 
  any air vehicle can simply fly lower , or just avoid a/b and they will be fine if you 're sitting up there . 
  `` armfixerbot '' there 's a bot for everything these days !, 
  well that 's a different argument , if you responded like that in the first place then i would have said fair enough . 
  but you decided to argue the point that you were effectively helping your team ... now who 's being contradictory ? 
  based on my experience as a pilot , you are not keeping enemy air down above c and d. i am yet to come across and maa which sits on the hill with that effective range . 
  and this is a huge misconception . 
  i do not waste jets . 
  i take down enemy jets and enemy helicopters before i attempt my stunts , i 'm doing a much better job than some useless noob camping on the hill in his immobile anti air because i wo n't attempt a stunt if a jet is up . 
  i would much rather have a guy who takes down all enemy air all across the map by using a stealth jet like i do , or a guy who takes down enemy air and destroys infantry with the mobile anti everything . 
  or i could have the guy who sits on the hill , shooting down air over 2 , maybe 3 bases max ... 
  i know what i would prefer . 
  not the maa camper , he is *** way *** less effective . 
  you 're an idiot . 
  i take down all enemy air all across the map when i 'm in a jet rather than just over a little hill which is n't even an objective . 
  that win-loss is largely due to operation metro . 
  i switch to the us team each time so that i can get the biggest suav multikills which you simply ca n't get on the ru side . 
  it just so happens that the us team loses more than 3/4 games on metro on ps4 . 
  also , the quits are largely due to joining a game like rogue transmission , for the sole purpose of getting an extended rendezook , infantry rendezook or whiplash . 
  all of which require the levolution not to be complete . 
  if the levolution has happened , i leave straight away . 
  also , with high quits comes a lot of joining servers mid-game . 
  when you join mid-game , there is a high chance that you are put on the losing team to fill in the spot of that rage quitter . 
  finally , i am glad that i do n't care about my stats !, 
  * so i do n't see how this evidence helps your point . 
  * i did n't say i ptfo when doing stunts , i said i take down enemy air before i attempt said stunt . 
  big difference , but taking down enemy air , even while not ptfoing is much better than what you can do while camping in an maa at the back of the map , 100s of metres from any objectives . 
  and change your flair , it says that your battlelog name is the same name . 
  no it 's not . 
  change it so that we can see your stats , otherwise i 'll just assume that you are a hypocrite who is worse at ptfoing than i am when i 'm not even trying . 
  wtf , i do what the stealth jet is designed to do , and then have some fun in between enemy jets spawning . 
  i only needed your maa kpm as that is all i wanted ... it is 0.59 ... that is extremely low . 
  mine is 1.03 ... and i 'm not someone who plays the objective . 
  yet my kpm is almost double yours in the maa , yet you think that camping on a hill is the most effective way of using an maa ? 
  ** lol **, 
   so you admit to playing just to get the trick shots ? 
  team player bud . 
  when did i say otherwise ? 
  my motivation to play is to do something awesome or something which has n't been done before . 
  as you previously mentioned me saying , i play to have fun and that 's why i paid for this game . 
   you clearly used those 300 extra hours of gameplay well ( sarcasm ), 
  yes , i did . 
  i find stunts rewarding , not stats , so the way i see it , all of your hours were wasted . 
  my point ? 
  why are you saying i am bad because my stats are worse than yours , when i could say that you 're bad because you have n't done a rendebow or a rendewhatever . 
  that 's a stupid thing to compare because you do n't care that you have n't done a rendebow , just like i dont care about my stats . 
  the reason i wanted your stats was to prove ** that your kpm in the maa is lower when you sit on the hill than when you capture bases and play the objective in the maa like i do . 
  ** case and point . 
   waste another jet, 
  on average , the number of kills per jet used will about one death per kill . 
  i get more than just one jet kill each time i fly making my effectiveness at jets while not ptfoing better than the average jet user , and that 's when i 'm not ptfoing . 
  i care what your stats are in the aa because i was arguing that sitting on the hill is not the way to ptfo with it , based on your stats and commetns , youre someone who ptfos , then why the fuck are you sitting on a hill , then you said it is a great way to help the team . 
  i was arguing that this is wrong . 
  that is all . 
  for some reason you thought that i was arguing that `` you 're not allowed to do that '' no . 
  i said that if you 're someone who ptfos , the why are you camping ? 
  i would have said fair enough if you said that 's what i enjoy doing , but no , you argued that youre helping your team a lot . 
  where as i proved , that is where you are wrong . 
  what 's so hard to understand , you 're welcome to camp in the aa , just do n't say you 're helping your team as best as an maa can , because it 's not . 
  and i do n't point out people 's flaws , just their hypocrisies and contradictions . 
   congratulations , you can jump out of a jet and kill someone whilst your team is getting battered below you . 
  well done . 
  stop acting like i care , we already discussed this . 
  lol, 
  go away , it 's april the second here . 
  not at the moment !, 
  lol , it 's not long until 0.60 . 
  that 's a good trigger finger . 
  not this one . 
  try again . 
  no you are not . 
  ~ a new zealander, 
  nah , sheep shagging is for the welsh , you are clearly drunk ... as always .

  it is not . 
  i rarely come across anyone else doing it . 
  very few people do it . 
  maybe 90 % of games you wo n't see anyone trying it . 
  true ... 
  well ... actually ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwlctnomzsc, 
  ** skip to 14:35 ** , i was the guy who launched the c4 from my jet while the enemy jet was trailing behind . 
  my friends were in and on the tank . 
  there will not be a ps5 as in the `` next generation '' console in 2016 . 
  it will be at least 2017 or 2018 before then . 
  there maybe a ps4 .5 , but it will be like the slim version of the ps3 , really not that much better . 
  at best there * may * be 4k support in a ps4 .5 this year . 
  good purchase . 
  bf5 wo n't be for * at least * 6 more months . 
  until then there will always be plenty of full servers to choose from since the community is still going strong . 
  i 'm pretty sure that a death is only a death when you 're sent back to the spawn screen . 
  look at the scoreboard when you die , you do n't get another death until you are in an un-reviveable state . 
  it took us a couple of sessions to get them both , thing is that we all wanted to be the guy in the tank , haha . 
  it 's really fun once you learn how to do it consistently !, 
  no , i 'm complaining about shooting him out ... how does that even work ?
